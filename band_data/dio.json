        "\n\"Master of the Moon\" is the last album in Dio's later career 'trilogy,' and it is unquestionably his best. In fact, \"Master of the Moon\" comes very close to being my favorite Dio solo album of all time. It's tough for me to choose between this one and \"The Last in Line.\" It's also the last full length studio album I had left to review here to have Dio on vocals, so it's a bit bittersweet for me to be doing this. Craig Goldy returns after recovering from his injury that kept him off \"Killing the Dragon,\" however, Jimmy Bain doesn't stick around for this record, so Jeff Pilson is tagged in, who is also an old face from Dio's past. Dio had plans to make a sequel to \"Magica\" at some point, and there are rumors that he even recorded enough rough vocals prior to his death for someone to finish, so it will be interesting to see if this will remain Dio's final album, or if we may see a posthumous release at some point.\n\nThe first thing that most people seem to notice about this album is that the pace is a lot slower and more deliberate that most Dio albums. For me, as a doom metal fan, (even though I'd never call this a doom metal album) that's not a problem in the slightest. In fact, I think the slower pace helps Craig Goldy, because his riffs on \"Master of the Moon\" are unquestionably the best in his career. His riff work is easily better on this record than most people would expect from him. The closer \"In Dreams\" is a prime example. Both his intro riff and the main riff to the verses are catchy and have a lot of creativity to them. At the same time, they also leave Dio plenty of space to do his thing over. He walks that tightrope perfectly on the song, and Dio only complements him. Dio's emotional range is in full display here as well. Aggression to sadness; beauty to anger; his vocals hit it all across the track. The chorus melody is catchy enough to be memorable, but not enough to be annoyingly so. I often find myself humming it. \"End of the World\" is very similar. Although Goldy's riff isn't quite as good, his solo is one of his best. Pilson's bass work lays a great foundation, and Dio's range fills out the rest. He has some higher notes for his age both in his lead and backing vocals. \"End of the World\" has a playfulness and fun to it that's refreshing. It's also a rather 'poetic' song.\n\nThere is quite a bit that is darker and more chilling about \"Master of the Moon.\" \"Shivers\" is definitely one of the darker songs in Dio's career. Goldy breaks out another fantastic riff here that is dark and extremely threatening. It's a foreboding riff, and Dio's terrified vocals sell it even better. The song is almost like Dio is reading you a ghost story and warning you that it's real. The small lead flourishes after the chorus and the solo are that extra little icing on the cake. The chorus, much like the whole song, is so ominous. \"Shivers\" is definitely one of the highlights on the record. \"The Eyes\" is not quite as full on dark as \"Shivers,\" but it has a similar threatening aura. Goldy's riff, again, while not as good as the aforementioned track, does exactly what it has to to paint a picture for Dio. The mechanical/distorted calls of \"Eye\" behind Dio here and there are almost a callback to \"Magica\" too. They get their own unique 'solo' before Goldy's own guitar solo, which is a great change of pace. The final part of the song Dio chants over is the catchiest part, and while it takes slightly to long to fade out, it also helps add another layer the song really needed.\n\nThe title track is one of Dio's best title tracks, too. The title track is a great middle ground of all of his 'classic' title tracks. It's not as classic as \"Holy Diver,\" as catchy as \"The Last in Line,\" or as powerful as \"Sacred Heart,\" but it's a great mix of all of them. The chorus is fantastically catchy, and has that signature Dio-style melody that has been missing for quite a while. The whole song really builds to the chorus as a climax. The verses are crushing smashes from the band with Dio's vocals cutting between them. It has a bombastic and explosive feeling before the really memorable chorus. But for me, this album gets no better than \"Living the Lie.\" In fact, \"Living the Lie\" might very well be my favorite Dio solo track. And it's another one that's incredibly hard for me to point to reasons why. It's just...Dio doing his thing so beautifully. His melodies are everything. Every word has the perfect inflection and amount of emotion to it. He is telling a story with his voice alone. He could hum the song with no lyrics using the same emotion and melodies and still tell a story musically. Backing vocals are used exactly the right amount to intensity everything. Goldy's riff is great enough to be fun and memorable without detracting from Dio's perfect melodies. I can totally understand why someone might listen to this album and think \"Living the Lie\" is just another track, but there's just something almost undefinable about it that keeps me coming back.\n\n\"Master of the Moon\" doesn't really have a bad moment on it. Just slight missteps here and there. The opener \"One More for the Road\" is probably the biggest stumbling block to me. It's definitely not a bad track at all, but...it's just your standard Dio opener. It's the same formula for an opener that he has used since \"Holy Diver.\" Heard \"Stand Up and Shout?\" \"We Rock?\" \"Night People?\" Then you know what \"One More for the Road\" is going to be. Just swap around the lyrics and slightly change the riffs and call it a day. It's almost odd that Dio went back to that typical route when he'd gotten away from it for a few albums. \"Death by Love\" is the only other slightly below average track for me. It's a shame because it's another of Goldy's best riffs. He accents the perfect note during it to make it hit a little harder and give it a mysterious feeling. Dio's melodies on the song are just again a little generic, and the chorus is pretty flat. It's not a bad chorus, but it makes me go \"Oh. That's it?\" I think my opinion would be lower if Goldy's riff wasn't so good. It really is a riff of wasted potential to me. Even so, you'll find much worse in Dio's catalog than \"Death by Love.\"\n\nAnd with that, we close the book on my reviews of Dio's career. He was the one that opened the door to metal for me, so I consider it an honor and a tribute to be able to review his whole body of work in each of his three core bands. While \"Master of the Moon\" wasn't the last full album his voice would grace us with (that was \"The Devil You Know\"), this one wasn't that far away from it either. As far as Dio's solo career goes, I don't think it could get much better than \"Master of the Moon.\" I definitely think this is one that you need to listen to a few times to really get to click. The album's generally slow to mid tempo at best might be a deterrent for someone who doesn't live in a world of doom metal like I do, but if you're generally a fan of Dio, give this one a few chances and a bit of time to grow on you. Just because it's late in his life doesn't mean it's bad. Like the man on the silver mountain himself, this album ages with grace.\n",
        "\nDio's ninth studio album \"Killing the Dragon\" is in a really strange place to me. It's the middle album out of the 'trilogy' that made up the last part of his solo career, and it's not only the weakest of those three, but also in the running for weakest album of his entire career. Not only that, but this album was largely written with Craig Goldy, but due to a hand injury, fantastic guitarist Doug Aldrich stepped in to play on this album and the subsequent tour. Other than that, everyone who was on \"Magica\" remains here. A part of me wonders if the sudden change in the band's lineup had anything to do with the lukewarm and inconsistent songwriting that plagues \"Killing the Dragon.\" I wish I could make excuses for the album, too. I wish I could say \"Oh, the attempt was there but missed the mark\" or \"Well, they tried something new that didn't work.\" But no. There's nothing I can say to condone the failures of this record.\n\n\"Killing the Dragon\" has a decently strong first half, but then collapses with what is by FAR the weakest and most obvious bunch of filler tracks of Dio's life. It is almost staggering how blatant and obvious it is that so many of the later tracks are just filling space. There's no question that the title track is the best song the album has to offer. It's almost a shame, really, that they throw the one really great song at you right out of the gate. The main riff has a gallop to it and a flare of intensity. Dio's vocals are right behind it with that same strength and energy. He goes from that feisty anger to haunted and feigned fear with great success. Aldrich also displays a really impressive solo. The song just never backs down the entire way and does everything you can ask for. \"Rock and Roll\" is the only other track on \"Killing the Dragon\" that fully pulls its weight. Even then, I certainly wouldn't call the song a highlight by any means, but it enjoyably accomplishes what it sets out to do. Jimmy Bain has some of his better bass work here when he's given the chance, and Aldrich produces short, but biting riffs. Dio's melodies are the key there, and the chorus is extremely catchy. It's a solid song, but just doesn't have the depth to be much better than that.\n\nOn the first side, \"Scream\" is the only track that I think is just under passable. It's still better than anything on the second, but it's pretty stock. The bass work and drum beat are just the same kind of chugging that we've heard a million times before. Dio's pre-chorus is familiar yet fun, but the chorus is lifeless and doesn't hit as hard as it should. The verse melodies just kind of exist without doing very much as well. On a normal Dio album, this song would be what is considered the 'filler' song of the album. It's not horrible, but it's certainly nothing worth listening to with any frequency. If only that were the case, though. No. We then move on to the second half. \"Push\" is the single for the album. It gained a lot of attention for having Tenacious D in the music video. Certainly it can be expected that the single is going to be a little bit generic, right? The chorus is cliche and extremely whiny, and the riffs across the song are just plodding away. Dio's melodies are kind of rambling all over. It's pretty weak, but...a lot of 'singles' are watered down and generic. It can't get that much worse...right..?\n\n\"Guilty\" is just as generic and boring. Like many other tracks, the riffs are stock and weak; playing a note or two before just holding things down. The chorus once again is extremely whiny, and Dio even sounds bored singing it. I get second hand embarrassment just listening to \"Guilty\" due to how utterly wimpy and pathetic it is. It has no variety, no effort, and no emotional depth to it. You can't get much more of a cardboard cutout song than this. Or at least you'd think that until you listen to \"Before the Fall.\" This song makes me borderline cringe. Dio is just so whiny. This song is supposed to be something like a throw-back song that loosely describes his life. There are clear references of Vinny Appice joining Black Sabbath; having never heard the Ozzy era songs and having trouble understanding Iommi and Geezer's accents as an example of what the song is going for. And while it's commendable and understandable for Dio to make something of a 'reflection' track this late in his career, it's nothing but a self gratifying experience for him. Musically, it's insanely weak. The melodies are annoying at their best. So at the end of the day the song is nothing but a weak and annoying track that sounds like a man's complaints given song.\n\nIt's pretty hard to remember that \"Cold Feet\" exists. Some people try to save a strong song as the closer to their album. Dio has done this himself several times. He did not do that here with \"Cold Feet.\" Aldrich almost seems to be playing random notes to call a riff. There's no consistency and nothing chains together satisfyingly. The keyboards that come in after Dio's lines try to give it a somewhat 'classic' feel, but you can't add atmosphere to a song successfully if it has no other form of depth. And \"Cold Feet\" is Dio having cold feet giving any kind of depth to his song writing. It just does the same thing for four minutes. It's really bad. It's a true throwaway song. Much like \"Throw Away Children\" is. \"Throw Away Children\" is the most palatable song on the second half, but that doesn't mean it's any good. Simon Wright and Jimmy Bain do everything they can to get this song off the ground right with a unique start. Unfortunately, again, Aldrich's riffs are close to non-existent, and everything Dio is doing has been done to death both on this album and in his career. The children's choir at the end of the song adds a little bit more life to the song, but it's far too late to have an impact. You can't save a thoroughly uninteresting song with a 30 second slightly interesting outro. It's the best of the worst, but \"Throw Away Children\" still doesn't cut it.\n\n\"Killing the Dragon\" is a frankly unacceptable album. The later half is a staggering waste of time. If, for whatever reason, Goldy's injury hampered the songwriting, they should have just delayed the release of the record rather than rush it out. Dio has never before, and never after just deliberately slopped together cliche and generic song after song. The second half of the record is pretty equal to a track or two on an album like \"Sacred Heart\" where it's clear a quick song was made to fill a bit more time. There's no excuse to do that for half an album. The band wasn't even smart enough to spread them out between the songs on the first half that were actually somewhat decent. It was almost as if they said \"Eh. No one is going to listen this deep into this album anyway.\" If you've never listening to this record before, you are missing absolutely nothing if you stop after song five. Cherry pick one or two and stay far away from the rest. \"Killing the Dragon\" comes very close to being the worst full length record Dio ever put his name on, and it has absolutely no excuse for it either.\n",
        "\nAfter Dio had a second commercially low point of his career with \"Angry Machines,\" he took a good few years off to refresh and refocus. He returned in the new millennium with his eight studio album \"Magica.\" The record is a fresh start but features old faces. Jimmy Bain returned on bass, Craig Goldy returns years after his first effort a decade before, and Simon Wright is on the skins after his one-off shortly after Goldy's. \"Magica\" is a concept album that Dio himself carefully crafted. After once thinking that the high-fantasy scene was getting stale, Dio goes back to it even harder than ever here. In fact, he was so proud of the story, that the last 'track' of the album is just a spoken word track of Dio telling the story like a book on tape. Fun little personal aside; one of my best friends would often use this spoken word track to help him fall asleep at night because of how peaceful Dio's voice is and how atmospheric the backing is.\n\nWhile \"Magica\" is absolutely a fun and worthy addition to Dio's career, something always rubbed me the wrong way when it comes to this album that the music very clearly took a backseat to the story telling. Most tracks on the album have a mechanical voice that transitions from song to song to link the story and the music. While I've seen some concept albums do a worse job, it gets a bit tiring to always have a reminder that this is, in fact, a concept album. That being said, I don't think there are any tracks that are phoning it in, but I always find that quality suffers when you're trying to make music around words rather than the other way around. \"Feed My Head\" is the track where this is the most obvious. I don't think there's a more clear example of a 'filler' track that just exists to move the story along than this one. The song's opening riff doubles as the chorus melody, and there's absolutely nothing musically in between all of it to be enjoyed at all. It's just Goldy playing a few notes while Dio sings over them. It's not the worst thing Dio has ever done, but it's a pretty forgettable and dull track that serves little purpose beyond dragging the story along.\n\n\"As Long As It's Not About Love\" is the other track on the record that just misses the mark. Dio's vocal range and emotions at the start of the song are really, really impressive. He sells the start of the track SO well. However, once the band comes in, it just falls a bit flat for me. Goldy's riff isn't bad, but it switches the mood of the song without doing a very good job. The song takes a somewhat sinister turn, including how Dio changes the way he sings the chorus. For once, though, I think this song would have been better served as a traditional ballad. Dio has the power and emotions to carry it, as we've seen many times before. So what could have been a short and sweet ballad gets turned into a bit of an unfocused mess that doesn't quite hit any emotion the way it should. Again, it's far from an unacceptable track, but leaves a lot to be desired. The first real song on the album \"Lord of the Last Day\" does the somewhat sinister feeling FAR better. The riffs are simple but powerful, and the slow, marching tempo gives Dio plenty of room to float across with his melodies. It's a great table setter of a song that both advances the story and is musically interesting. Jimmy Bain also has some memorable, yet subtle bass work whenever the song gets a little space. It's a memorable bit of added depth to the song.\n\nFor me, \"Magica\" gives no greater joy than \"Losing My Insanity.\" It is the one and only time in Dio's entire life where he makes a fantasy \"Middle Earth\" sounding track. Dio has always had fantasy lyrics, but this song is his one time going full on musically with this kind of throw-back fantasy style. The slow building intro that gradually introduces majestic keys and then a firey electric guitar to match the acoustic hypes everything that is to come up. Dio's vocals are having so much fun without ever forgetting what he's trying to accomplish in terms of story telling. He has a great showcase of varying intensity and beauty throughout. There are few Dio songs that are just such a joy to listen to as \"Losing My Insanity.\" \"Fever Dreams\" is the other track from \"Magica\" I find myself coming back to all the time. Dio himself is really the one holding this track up. Goldy's riff isn't bad, but isn't quite anything special either. Dio's incredible range and variety of melodies all across this track is what gives it such life. His melodies have all of the emotions that the character in the story would be going through. In this one song they hit almost every range and emotion you can think of, and it's always a lot of fun. The chorus is also solidly catchy enough to put the cherry on top.\n\nWhile the rest of \"Magica\" is still very good across the board, not much more of it has the depth to really dig into. \"Eriel\" is one of Goldy's shining moments and has some smooth and memorable Dio melodies but overstays its welcome just a bit too much for me. It starts off with another great build that seems like it could be the start of an action scene before moving to a much more flowing style. It just is missing a bit of variety and change. I also appreciate how the album bookends itself. The opening \"Magica Theme\" is less complete, but gives the entire \"Lord of the Last Day.\" At the end, we get a more complete version of the theme, and a small reprise of \"Lord of the Last Day.\" It's almost as if those songs are tagging in and out to bookend the album. To people that are really into lyrics and story-telling in music, this album might be an even bigger treat, but those sort of things aren't what I listen for personally.\n\n\"Magica\" ends up being a really important album of Dio's career. It showed that Dio could reinvent himself. It showed that he could take what many might call 'old' concepts and make them new and fresh again. It showed that Dio could bounce back after a lackluster album stronger. And most importantly, it showed that Dio was still passionate about making music and was still having fun. \"Magica\" wasn't a paycheck album for Dio. It wasn't an album that he felt obligated to make because he needed to put food on the table. It undeniably has his heart and soul in it from start to finish, and I think that's the biggest reason why it's still held up so strongly by the fans to this day. Any gripes I may have due to the actual song-writing being slightly below Dio's standards is washed away by his passion. \"Magica\" ends up being a solid and enjoyable album that just misses the mark of being amazing. It might not be Dio's best work with all things considered, but I don't think there'd be any debate that it was one he was most proud of.\n",
        "\nAfter the aggressive \"Strange Highways,\" it's already a little eyebrow raising to see the exact same lineup release \"Angry Machines,\" which is an extremely different album. \"Angry Machines\" is by far the least popular Dio solo album, and while I don't think this record is a strong release, I would take this one over \"Lock Up the Wolves\" any day of the week. I might even take \"Angry Machines\" over one of Dio's later releases too (again, we'll get there.) This record dropped all of the anger and raw power \"Strange Highways\" had and instead tries to replace it with more progressive and industrial material. This album tries to throw in quite a few slightly odd time signatures across it, which is very different for Dio. Unfortunately, it doesn't exactly help to make this a better record. It's far from the biggest problem \"Angry Machines\" has, though.\n\nPersonally, I also think this album was the one where Dio realized he'd need to start changing his vocal style a little bit. I think signs of age start to show in his voice here. His voice sounds tired, weaker, and even has a bit of cracking here and there. I think this was the last of the youth in Dio's voice, and he'd have to start adjusting his voice with his age from this point forward. Not that Dio wasn't still awe-inspiring even in his older years, but I just think this record really starts to show his youth leaving him. Besides that, at the end of this album, both Tracy G and Vinny Appice would leave the band for the rest of its tenure. Tracy only had two albums, but it's a bit sad to see Vinny end his Dio solo career on this of all albums. Luckily, we'd get him back for the next Sabbath reunion, so he had one more album with Dio.\n\nThe opener \"Institutional Man\" was a great way to kick the album off. It gives one of the better examples of what \"Angry Machines\" was desperately looking for the entire way through. It has some odd time signatures thrown in and is filled with darker Dio vocals and some of the heaviest and crunchiest riffs Tracy has ever made. It's a slow and doomy track that is very satisfying the whole way through. It certainly is a different flavor of Dio that takes a bit of getting used to, but it's still a very enjoyable song. \"Double Monday\" is a short and sweet track with that same kind of fire-filled energy, although with a much faster blend. Vinny Appice's beats are really creative and energetic. He's the shining moment of this song. The song isn't really special in any degree, but the short run time saves it quite a bit. About half way through, it breaks into a more melodic acoustic section too. It's probably the most melodic and pretty moment on the entire album. You'd think it'd be unfitting, but it's spaced out nicely and doesn't go on long enough to be a detraction. It's a very fun, albeit less than special track.\n\nYou also can't talk about this record without touching on \"This is Your Life.\" This is THE quintessential Dio ballad of his entire career. His voice is beautiful, with just enough piano and keys behind him to give him weight without detracting from the beauty. Every word sung in this song is filled with that magic that Dio is so loved and revered for. \"This is Your Life\" is a reason why Dio is as special as he is. You can't point to this song and tell someone \"make one like this.\" It's something only he could have done. The song could have been someone's swan song before they retired or died, but for Dio, it was just another day at the office. \"Big Sister\" is my personal favorite heavier song on the record. Pilson's subtle bass work is very driving, and the entire time the whole band is there to elevate Ronnie with heaviness. Again, there are smatterings of keyboard work and odd time signatures here and there to give a bit more flavor to \"Big Sister.\" Much like with \"Double Monday,\" there is a short clean interlude that makes the track a bit more unique.\n\nPilson shines again on \"Dying in America.\" His bass work is not only really fantastic, but it also sounded very 'of its time,' which could be good or bad depending on what you think of mid 90's metal. Dio's vocal melodies are a bit sadder and more somber for the most part, and while I don't particularly think the song is special either, I think the riff under the verse melodies is very catchy, and the chorus has just enough fire behind it to make it one of the more memorable tracks on the album. \"Hunter of the Heart\" is another Jeff Pilson fueled track. Once again, he is the one to listen to on this song, like many on this particular record. \"Hunter of the Heart\" is rather bland besides Pilson's cool work and a decently memorable pausing chorus. Tracy's riffs aren't really anything special, though, and the track is rather standard and uninspired beyond those few cool moments. I wouldn't say this song detracts from the album, but it definitely isn't good enough to help silence the naysayers either.\n\nSpeaking of Jeff Pilson, he also wrote most of \"Stay Out of My Mind,\" which is very unusual for a Dio solo album. Unfortunately, it's not exactly a stellar track, either. It has some okay riffing going on along with the odd time signature approach they use often across \"Angry Machines,\" but it never really marches out of the starting gate. It does a lot of meandering and lasts WAY too long. There's just not enough substance on the song to hold it up. The most interesting thing about the song, to me, is the middle orchestral section. This section sounds EXACTLY like the kind of thing Dio'd go on to write for his concept album \"Magica\" that followed several years after this. It makes me think that maybe Dio got the musical ideas for \"Magica\" as far back as here a bit. \"Don't Tell the Kids\" is the lowest point on the record for me, though. Vinny Appice explodes with a FANTASTIC drum intro that fills the track with promise, but it's garbage after that. This is a faster tempo song that almost sounds a little bit more like the traditional Dio opener formula, but they just decided to do it second instead of first this time. The chugging power chords are beyond stock, and Dio's verse melodies are insanely unfitting. It sounds nothing like Dio'd ever come up with in the worst way possible. Not only that, but the song is also one of the one's where his voice sounds the most shot. The chorus is as unfitting and stupid as the verse vocals, so there's not one instance of this song after the drum intro that is remotely interesting or satisfying.\n\nNow, this review might make you think I made a mistake when I rated it. I know I didn't quite rip into \"Angry Machines\" as hard as I have other records but...that's the thing about the record. It's just bland and bad in a very muddled way. It's not really bad in a cringe worthy or teeth gritting way. It's bad in a way that a lot of mid 90's metal records are bad. The band was trying something new and it sounds off. Kind of like a dad that tries on 'hip' clothing. I specifically cherry picked the most interesting moments of the record, for better or for worse during this review. But most of what I DIDN'T expressly talk about is just there. Blandly filling the album's runtime. I gave you the Cliffs Notes of a rather dull album. That's why \"Angry Machines\" isn't my least favorite Dio album. It's a failed attempt at something different. That's the long and the short of it. It's not as stale and tired as \"Lock Up the Wolves\" was, nor is it as head-smashingly awful as a good chunk of a later album is.\n\n\"Angry Machines\" was very clearly a lesson learned for Dio. This was the first and last time he tried to 'get with' the times. A few years after this album, Dio would have a great comeback. He'd go back to his high fantasy roots, but at the same time change the band's sound and style so it didn't seem like he was merely trying to rehash the past. He'd bring back old faces that had fresh ideas. Meanwhile, \"Angry Machines\" isn't an album so bad that it deserves to be skipped over. There are smatterings of unique moments without much of the album being truly unlistenable. Just know what you're getting into when you listen to it. After all, if we ignore the lessons of the past, we'd be doomed to repeat them in the future!\n",
        "\nDio's solo band was put on hold post \"Lock Up the Wolves\" for him to briefly rejoin Sabbath for the incredible \"Dehumanizer\" album. However, egos reared their heads again, and after being asked to essentially play a supporting role for Ozzy on tour, Dio felt his dignity was robbed, and left Sabbath. As before, he took Vinny Appice with him, and they reformed Dio together with Jeff Pilson on bass and Tracy G on guitar to create \"Strange Highways.\" This album is in a bit of an odd place. The follow up to this album has a very bad reputation, so I feel like tons of Dio fans just skip over \"Strange Highways\" because they assume \"Angry Machine's\" bad reputation will hold true for this one too. \"Strange Highways\" is very different, however, and deserves a much closer look.\n\nStylistically, \"Strange Highways\" is a very natural progression coming off the extremely angry \"Dehumanizer.\" Dio is still as pissed off on this album as he was during his brief second run with Sabbath. Tracy G is also a fantastic guitarist at complementing this style. Tracy, in my opinion, is probably the best pure riff writing guitarist of Dio's solo career, but he suffers in other places. I don't think he's a versatile guitarist by any degree. He does one style and does it quite well, but I could never see Tracy G being a long term guitarist for Dio. He is quite formulaic in his transitions and solos. I think things would have gotten stale with him if he'd stayed on much longer than he did. Jeff Pilson is also a wonderful bassist, and a great addition to the band. However, this is really where I get to rest my case on what I said about Dio in my \"Holy Diver\" review. It's very obvious that he was trying to make this a follow up to \"Dehumanizer.\" Without Tony Iommi to elevate him, though, \"Strange Highways\" can't hold a candle to what it's trying to essentially one up. That's not to say the record is bad. Far from it. It's just that Dio absolutely was at his best when he had another legend that he could compete with directly.\n\n\"Pain\" is one of the most aggressive and pissed off songs that Dio has ever come up with. It starts with a great buildup and Dio pouring his all into the coming anger that the song will represent. Tracy G gives us a really smooth and memorable core riff as well. The track also has a wonderful balance of instrumental heaviness and breathing room for Dio's voice to shine through on. It might be the pinnacle track for this new lineup gelling and all meshing together. The opening track \"Jesus, Mary, and the Holy Ghost\" is another very memorable track for this lineup. For once, the very standard and done to death Dio opening track formula is broken here, and it really is for the better. This song is definitely a little bit of a quicker one for the album, but it still has a lot of room to show off the power and aggression that \"Strange Highways\" in general comes to represent. It's a great showcase of the new sound. Enough classic Dio sound to please old school fans, but it also never goes without the heavy nature either. I could do without the false ending with a middling fadeout over false animal panting, but it's a small blemish on a very good track.\n\nFor me, \"Blood from a Stone\" is the most overlooked and underappreciated track this Dio lineup has ever done. The core riff is catchy on top of the heaviness, and Dio pulls out one of his most memorable choruses. He still presents it with that throat ripping pissed off anger, but he adds the perfect amount or his normal singing voice and melody to it to make the chorus an extremely catchy and memorable one. There's nothing about \"Blood from a Stone\" that I think would make it a classic or a staple, but it's just a really enjoyable track in which everything just comes together extremely well. \"Hollywood Black\" has another really fantastic chorus. The song in general is a stomping grooving track that gives Pilson and Appice a lot of room to standup on. It builds up nicely, and the mixture of the chorus riff and Dio's melody over it give an electric chorus. It's sleek and a bit darker, but still quite catchy at the same time. \"Hollywood Black\" is a refreshing mix of classic Dio and the new style from this rejuvenated lineup. It tells just the right musical story.\n\nThe title track starts off with an acoustic and somber intro, which is pretty different from most of the album. It does a good job in making the title track feel special from the rest of the record. The remainder of the song features a fantastically heavy riff from Tracy G and a driving bassline from Pilson. Pilson really is the highlight here. He connects everyone together and keeps the listener focused between the rest of the parts. He and the crushing riff are really the meat of the entire song. I honestly think Dio is a bit dull on this particular track. In general, I find the title track takes a bit too much time to say its piece. It's a good song, but the fat needed trimming. Especially during the last two minutes. It could easily have been shaved down. \"Give Her the Gun\" also has an acoustic intro, but falls much flatter than the title track. It's a much more melodic song. Almost unfittingly melodic for what the rest of the album represents. The chorus kind of comes out of nowhere and doesn't really make any sense in terms of where it was placed and why. The song just kind of bounces between this melodic acoustic part and a sudden burst of dull heaviness for the chorus and doesn't leave much of an impact. The heavier parts feel really forced and don't have the punch they should have had. The song is also far too long on top of it. \"Give Her the Gun\" isn't an unacceptable track, but it is definitely a muddy and unfocused experience.\n\n\"Here's to You\" is the biggest headscratcher on the record. It comes out of the gate with a layered and celebratory chorus that makes it feel like it's meant to be a classic Dio sounding song, but as mentioned before, Tracy G is not the guitarist for classic Dio. Dio still tries to put a bit more aggression on the verses to make it fit the rest of the album's mood, but both the chorus and a lot of the melodies themselves SCREAM of older Dio and don't match up. Tracy's riffs flounder about. He seems almost confused trying to come up with a good part to fit what Dio presented. Luckily, the song is short, and the last new riff is probably what the entire song should have been like, so it's again not an awful experience. Just a bit confused. \"Evilution\" is another that is on the duller side on the record. This is another track that Pilson is really holding up, but a lot of the track comes out like a jam to me instead of a crafted song. Dio has some cool verse melodies, but the riffs behind him are pretty stock and dull. Again, the chorus just kind of comes out of nowhere and falls very flat. The song is probably the most formulaic and repetitive on the entire album. The whole thing only has two core parts and neither of them are particularly impactful. I don't think much would be missing off the album if this one was left on the bench during the recording sessions.\n\nAs a total experience, \"Strange Highways\" is another very worthwhile Dio album to add to his bag of tricks. Much like \"Dream Evil,\" there really isn't a terrible moment across the whole album. Even the worst of what \"Strange Highways\" offers is simply okay and a bit stock while never dipping below. It definitely felt like, whether intentionally or subconsciously, Dio had some old habits that snuck their way onto the record when maybe they shouldn't have. It was also pretty clear that the band needed to work out some kinks and adjust to each other. \"Strange Highways\" definitely has a bit of a 'getting to know you' feel to it. One would think that the follow up with the same lineup would have been tighter and fixed these slight hiccups. However, \"Angry Machines\" would go on to have the worst reputation of any Dio album, so something didn't go as expected. In any case, \"Strange Highways\" is a very good record and well worth your time and attention.\n",
        "\nAfter the lackluster third wheel of an experience that was \"Sacred Heart,\" Dio needed to come back strong. His fourth album \"Dream Evil\" is another home run for him, even though this album gets criminally passed over just because Vivian Campbell is gone. Craig Goldy comes in to replace him, and Craig is definitely my favorite overall Dio guitarist. His riff work is WAY better than Vivian's, and his solos are just as good, so he's a far better replacement in my eyes. The shame is, though, that Dio has stated that Jimmy Bain in particular (and possibly Vinny, too, at the time) didn't like Craig for whatever reason, and didn't think he was a good fit for the band, so this entire lineup is rather short lived, despite how good of a record \"Dream Evil\" is.\n\nWithout a DOUBT, \"Dream Evil\" takes on a much darker and more somber feel to it than all of the very energetic and high energy records with Vivian had. I think the songwriting on this album has more depth and variety to it, however, the slower pace and nature might take some getting used to for someone that is only familiar with the Vivian-era material. The other interesting thing about \"Dream Evil,\" to me, is that I don't think there's a single bad track on the record. However, at the same time, there are MANY songs across it that have small dips in quality or questionable choices to it that I think makes the album suffer a little. There is not one moment listening to this album where I feel the need to skip a song. However, there are quite a few moments that make me go \"ehhh...\" which is a bit of a strange feeling.\n\nWe'll take \"Naked in the Rain\" as the prime suspect. I LOVE the verse melodies across this song. They're dark and filled with that trademark Dio emotional drama. The verses are all filled with promise and lay wonderful building blocks to something special. However...the chorus is...pretty lackluster. The chorus doesn't fit the mood the verses built even remotely. It feels extremely random to me, and absolutely does not feel related to the verses at all. They feel like they're two entirely different songs mashed together. Like Dio had a chorus without a song to go with it, and also verses that he couldn't nail a good chorus for, so he threw them together. \"Overlove\" has the opposite kind of problem for me. Craig Goldy is on FIRE on \"Overlove.\" His riff along with Vinny's energy are explosive, and easily the best part of the song. That main riff and the unique clean intro are spectacular. However, when the verses come in, it's kind of...standard Dio melodies that, while not bad at all, are just kind of cliche and not on par with how great the riff behind them is. The melodies detract from the riff, and that's something you NEVER want to do. The chorus matches the electric nature of the rest of the song, so the kind of mediocre verse vocals from Dio stand out as being a real blow to an otherwise phenomenal track.\n\nNext, \"I Could Have Been a Dreamer\" is your very typical overly sappy song that screams \"SINGLE\" and \"radio airplay\" so intentionally that it hurts. The track certainly isn't an awful one, and the chorus is actually filled with a lot of powerful emotion from Dio that the keyboards really accent extremely well. The riffs to the song are just rather weak, and the verse vocals are really just filler to get to that chorus, so it leaves \"I Could Have Been a Dreamer\" as an extremely one dimensional song. Not offensive, but nothing special. The opener \"Night People\" is equally inoffensive while still being standard and unremarkable. This is your by the books Dio opening track that he has absolutely done to death over the course of these four albums. \"Night People\" follows the exact same formula as \"Stand Up and Shout\" and \"We Rock.\" Same subpar, but quick paced riffs, and same generic verse melodies that are just built to lead to a chorus. Once again, I don't dislike \"Night People\" at all, but I've just heard things so similar to it before, that it just feels stale even though it is a solid track standing by itself.\n\nTruly, the two standout tracks on the record are two of the more well known ones. The title track might just be Dio's greatest title track of his solo career. For me, \"Dream Evil\" as a title track is far better than both \"Holy Diver\" and \"The Last in Line.\" It is filled with terrific riffs, and Dio really paints a perfect picture of what the album is shooting for. His vocals are a little dark and a little bit ominous while not betraying his style at all. The chorus is fantastic and catchy, the solo is moving, and later in the song, the chorus line where Dio's vocals switch to a demonic effect followed by a strong fill from Vinny are just the kick the song needed to stay strong. \"All the Fools Sailed Away\" is in the running for my favorite Dio solo song. It has a bit of everything. The intro sets up a somber and dramatic foundation. It's one that only someone like Dio could really do justice. The core riff of the song is a slower one that isn't trying to take center stage, but also remains memorable, which is a pretty hard feat to accomplish. Keyboardist Claude Schnell, who has always had excellent work, but never really stood out more than was needed, has a really brilliant and memorable solo on the song. The chorus is the crown jewel of the whole product, though. It seems like every single time it hits, it just builds stronger and stronger. It starts with Dio and what sounds like light backing vocals. By the end of the song, there's a children's choir that is clear and building him up. The choir is always there on the chorus, but at the start, they could easily be mistaken for just Dio doing his own backing vocals. By the end, they are clear as day and adding a lot to the overall emotion of the chorus. It's an amazing track all across the board.\n\n\"Dream Evil\" ends up being an absolutely fantastic addition to Dio's solo discography that is very much overlooked because of a lineup change. There's no doubt that \"Dream Evil\" stumbles and trips quite a few times during its runtime, but never once does it fall. It is one of Dio's most consistent albums despite a few of these small missteps. It would also be the last album to have any semblance of the \"classic\" lineup. On Dio's next album, the entire band would be repopulated, but at the same time, every single one of the musician's on this album (baring Claude) would return later on in some form or fashion. Although, almost never at the same time again. Only once more after this record did any of the other three ever overlap again. \"Dream Evil\" is a unique record in the Dio discography both for its dark, dreary mood, as well as the consistency of the songs. It is an album that could never quite be replicated. It definitely deserves some \"Overlove.\"\n",
        "\nDio's fifth studio album \"Lock Up the Wolves\" is a bit of a black sheep. As stated at the end of my \"Dream Evil\" review, the entire lineup of \"Lock Up the Wolves\" is different than all previous lineups, but even more so than that, bassist Teddy Cook and young guitarist Rowan Robertson have one off appearances here, and would never appear on another Dio release. Simon Wright joins them, and even though he only did this one album at the time, he'd be back to be Dio's permanent drummer later in his career. He does his job as a drummer, but besides a small few moments of brilliance here and there, he's not really better than your average drummer. Rowan Robertson is a fairly competent guitarist for his age and experience when he recorded for this album. He has some cool riffs here and there, but he also is trying to fill some pretty big shoes that came before him that he just might not have had the ability to do. When I first saw the keyboardist for this album years ago, I had to double take. Jens Johansson?! Yes! THE Jens Johanson who'd go on to show his true skill in Stratovarius. This is before he joined Strato, and quite honestly, he might as well not even be credited on the record because he barely does anything on it. Dio got maybe the greatest keyboardist ever...and he is used less on this album than Claude Schnell or even when he played keys himself on \"Holy Diver.\" A true shame, but maybe Jens' legendary skill wasn't known yet.\n\nNow, when everyone talks about Dio's solo material, almost everyone you meet says that \"Angry Machines\" is the 'bad' album. And while I certainly wouldn't call \"Angry Machines\" a standout album (we'll get there), it is WORLDS better than \"Lock Up the Wolves\" is. This record is by far the worse album Dio's voice graces in a full time capacity. \"Lock Up the Wolves\" is not a downright dreadful record, but it is so boring and passed its prime. \"Lock Up the Wolves\" is like room temperature milk. Everything about it was dated and stale the very moment it came out. This album is almost like Dio parodying himself. There is not one moment of brilliance or Dio magic on this entire album, yet the entire record sounds like he is rehashing his older albums. It sounds like Dio is rewriting his old songs and just changing little things here and there. However, every song sounds extremely fatigued, lifeless and soulless. If Dio ever just went through the motions to record a record for a paycheck, it was on \"Lock Up the Wolves.\"\n\nNever have I been so bored to tears listening to Ronnie James Dio's voice and music as whenever I go back to this record. \"Why Are They Watching Me\" is the absolute epitome of a filler track. And having a filler track on a 'filler' album is even worse. A stock and standard hard rock riff greets us and just goes through the motions from there. As mentioned, Dio is pretty much just mimicking verse riffs he has used in the past, and the chorus is abysmal. To say it's a stupid chorus would be an understatement. It's meaningless, has no emotion to it, and goes nowhere. The song is beyond forgettable in every regard. \"Night Music\" starts with an alt-rock sounding intro that Dio sounds incredibly out of place on. The verses are sappy, dull, and once again, just sound like a rehashing. Robertson's riffs on this particular song really sound more like a jam. It sounds like he's just kind of trying out different things behind Dio and hoping they stick. Once again, the chorus is purposeless and goes nowhere. It's not a climactic chorus that is a culmination of what the song has been building to. It is Dio going \"Hey! I think these two words will be catchy if we sing them in this way.\" Not the worst track on the record, but another soulless and tired song.\n\n\"Hey Angel\" is your expected 'single' that Dio always tries to throw in there. But we are an extremely long way from \"Rainbow in the Dark.\" This is another example of Dio just taking two words, multi-tracking his vocals, and going \"That's all it takes to make a good chorus, right?\" Again, I'll point out that it's not satisfying, it's not the culmination of anything interesting before it, and it's not memorable. The riffs are also just your stereotypical chugging behind him. \"Hey Angel\" is boring, predictable, and easily one of the worst of the worst. It's another filler track desperate to be seen as a single. The title track is yet another unforgiveable mess. Dio has so many classic title tracks for fans to debate on. All four before this one have been extremely unique and memorable in their own right, and some of Dio's title tracks after this record are extremely underrated as well. But I can guarantee you when someone debates the best Dio title track, no one is going to throw \"Lock Up the Wolves\" into the conversation. Why? It's one of Dio's longest songs, yet it does nothing and goes nowhere. The over one minute intro doesn't add anything, and then the opening section that comes after it just flat out sucks. The band is playing a few notes before pausing and then continuing. When things like this are usually done, they're done to feel epic, powerful, or otherwise give a certain mood to a song. But the notes themselves aren't interesting, and the pauses are WAY longer than they should be. It's like the band tried to create anticipation, but the material just isn't good enough to make the listener care. Dio tries to create some emotion and passion with some cool screams after the chorus, but there's nothing that can save this overly long, repetitive, dull, rambling mess of a song.\n\n\"Born on the Sun\" seems to be trying a little harder than a lot of the rest of the album, but still has nothing to show for itself. Once again, in every single sense, this is a standard Dio song that sounds like it's copying past tracks. The verses and the riff fit a little better together, and Dio is adding some intensity to the song to give it a little of the intended fire, but it's a little lacking. And then the chorus hits, and everything about it sounds like \"The Last in Line.\" The actual riff itself, Dio's vocal melodies, and the beat behind them all sound like they were ripped directly off of his second title track. It's so blatant to me that sometimes I question if this was an intentional parody or not. The song had a few ideas here and there, but seemed hastily thrown together. The reason I mention the intentional parody is because the closing track \"My Eyes\" has very blatant and obvious references to some of Dio's past songs. References to \"Falling Off the Edge of the World,\" \"Man on the Silver Mountain,\" \"Heaven and Hell,\" and \"Stargazer\" are all made clear and deliberate, as examples. Now, despite these cool references, the song, unfortunately is WAY too sappy and quite repetitive, so I can't call it a good song. In fact, every time I hear it, all it does is make me want to go back and listen to those other songs. Whenever I hear this song, after the line \"Seen it from the eyes of a Stargazer\" I always wish Cozy Powell's infamous drum intro from that song started playing and led into that instead of continuing on with the rest of \"My Eyes.\" That's certainly not a good sign.\n\nThe one and only track I ever listen to off \"Lock Up the Wolves\" with any regularity at all is \"Between Two Hearts.\" It really is close to the only redeemable piece of material on the whole record. That's really because Robertson comes up with a really catchy riff that is just smoothness personified. The riff is slick and cool and lays a really good foundation for Dio to sing on. The song actually progresses decently nicely through its runtime, and it has a good handle on what it's doing right, so it ends up being an okay track on a lackluster album. The opening track \"Wild One\" is the only other song on the album I'd really give a pass to. Once again, Robertson has a pretty cool riff. \"Wild One\" is very much a standard Dio opening track like I pointed out as being done to death, but creative riff work really makes this one stand out a bit more. Maybe I'd like this song less if it was on a better album, but on \"Lock Up the Wolves\" this song is definitely one of the best there is to offer. If I was FORCED to pick a third track I'd give a pass to, it'd be \"Twisted\" for having a solid chorus over a catchy riff, but that's only if you forced me.\n\nTo me, \"Lock Up the Wolves\" shows that Dio needed a break. He was clearly bankrupt of ideas at this point, and was getting desperate. I honestly think Dio just made this album because he needed to make a living, rather than releasing this album because he genuinely thought it was brilliantly made. Luckily for him, Sabbath came calling right around this time, and it would be just the jolt Dio needed to get him out of this funk he was in. Not only did rejoining Sabbath for \"Dehumanizer\" light some fire back under him, but I also think the anger he felt about that whole situation spilled over into his solo band for another few releases until he got his legs back under him. While the call from Sabbath might have been just what he needed to kickstart the 'second half' of his career, if you look at \"Lock Up the Wolves\" at the time it was released, it certainly feels like he was on his way down. Fortunately, this was a one time flop for Dio, and he'd be back strong as ever soon.\n",
        "\nAfter the release of his first few albums, it seemed like Dio could do no wrong. His third effort \"Sacred Heart\" would come along to prove that he could take some missteps. It has been well documented by Ronnie himself that when this album was being made, Vivian wanted out. He thought he could go on to \"bigger\" things than Dio. Due to that, it is my speculation that Dio had to do pretty much all of the songwriting for this one by himself, without having someone to really bounce things off of. Because of that, so many of the tracks on \"Sacred Heart\" are so heavily focused on keyboard work and sickeningly sweet/catchy choruses that it degrades the entire experience. There is absolutely no doubt that the magic had dulled somewhat, and the band no longer had any heart to it. This album is a direct result of Dio trying to pick up the pieces that Vivian Campbell was leaving for him.\n\nLook no further than \"Hungry for Heaven.\" I certainly don't hate \"Hungry for Heaven,\" and for what it's trying to do, I think it's more successful than \"Mystery\" was on the prior album. \"Hungry for Heaven\" is another song that is crying for radio airplay. The keyboard work is over the top happy. It almost makes me full-on eye roll with how deliberately it attempts to be a happy and friendly track. Now...if just one song was like that, that can be understood, but then we can look at \"Rock 'n' Roll Children.\" You have almost the same formula on this track. This one isn't quite as sickeningly happy, but on both tracks, Vivian Campbell should not have even bothered showing up. His guitar work on everything other than the solo is completely phoned in. He physically sounds like he was playing these songs one handed while sitting in a chair yawning with the other. He was never a great riff writer, but here, there's no effort from him on display. Dio is truly giving it his all to salvage things, but there's only so much cheese filled keyboard focused stuff that a Dio album can afford to produce before leaving the audience begging for the end. \"Rock 'n' Roll Children\" is actually one of the BETTER tracks on this record, and even then, it leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nTruth be told, even when the album attempts to get heavier, and rid itself of being keyboard and cheese focused, it produces some of the worst tracks on the record. \"Fallen Angels\" greets us with one of the most pathetically generic hard rock tracks you'll ever find. This whole song sounds like something a dime a dozen hard rock act of the time would give us, not Dio. The riff is horribly generic, and Dio has a desperately cliched structure. The verse melodies are only one or two lines and then he quickly shifts focus to the chorus because that's really the only thing he had written for the song. The chorus is repeated so many times in this song, and it isn't even good. An absolutely forgettable experience. And if that wasn't bad enough, \"Just Another Day\" is absolutely one of the worst and most pathetic songs with Dio's voice on it. Once again, the main riff is just chugging chords with no emotion or energy to them. Jimmy Bain is actually trying really hard with his bass work, but that's the only passable thing about the song. Even Dio himself is just horrible on \"Just Another Day.\" The chorus is...ear-splitting. It's generic, it's sappy, it's cliche, and it goes absolutely nowhere. Dio is desperately throwing in the cliched \"It's alright, it's okay\" vocal lines that anyone uses when they have no ideas. \"Just Another Day\" is a laughable attempt to turn out one more song they needed to fill space on this record.\n\nThe title track is really the one and only track that I listen to from this record frequently. Every bit of passion, energy, and work went into this title track. \"Holy Diver\" was a biting, grooving title track. \"The Last in Line\" was a much more melodically inspired adventure. \"Sacred Heart\" is honestly a little bit doomy for a Dio song. The main riff is exceptionally heavy and ominous. Dio's vocal lines are magical, and he's really able to give his best because he has something to work with. The keyboards on this song are made to enhance the overall experience. They're there to add some stability, and come in to shine now and then when appropriate. They're not desperate for attention. The chorus is filled with power, and the solo is really fantastic. I honestly might like \"Sacred Heart\" as a title track more than the other two Vivan-era title tracks. \"Like the Beat of the Heart\" is the only other really solid track \"Sacred Heart\" offers. Once again, Vivian is absolutely phoning it in, but the keyboards help hold him up. Dio's story-telling and dynamic, varied voice saves this one from the same fate as most of the rest of the record. It also helps that \"Like the Beat of the Heart\" never lets one part overstay its welcome, either. The song should have only been a less than 3 minute 30 second song, but they have a quick false finish and than a rambling fade out that wasn't necessary. Again, I don't think this song is one of Dio's career bests, but it definitely is one of the best on this record.\n\nLuckily, I also spared you the effort of the cheese that is \"Shoot Shoot,\" too, which I don't recommend. \"Sacred Heart\" was far from the ending to the 'classic' Dio lineup both they themselves and fans would have wanted. I honestly think the only reason this album even gets half the notoriety it gets is because people attach it to the coattails of the previous two releases. \"Oh yeah! \"Holy Diver\" and \"The Last in Line are amazing! \"Sacred Heart\" too!\" It's a tag-along of an album. The third wheel that you feel obligated to invite to the party even though you really don't want to. \"Sacred Heart\" isn't a flat out awful release, but I'd hesitate to call it anything more than 'solid' at best. There are a few gems, but you're not missing much if you passed over this one. Luckily, Vivian was out after this record, and Dio would go on to bring in both a new guitarist and a new attitude for the next record.\n",
        "\nAfter the massive success of Dio's debut solo album \"Holy Diver,\" the same lineup would strike again with \"The Last in Line\" only a year after. Much as how I just don't understand how \"Heaven and Hell\" gets called better than \"Mob Rules,\" I also just do not understand how people consider \"Holy Diver\" to be a better record than \"The Last in Line.\" This record outstrips the debut in every single comparable way. Where \"Holy Diver\" was a quality record the whole way through, but never broke through that ceiling, \"The Last in Line\" has so many more memorable and consistent songs to it. Even though in my prior review I mentioned that the Vivian Campbell era lineup was one of the overall weakest in Dio's solo discography, I think \"The Last in Line\" is far and away the best album Dio's solo band ever made.\n\nWhere I complained that \"Stand Up and Shout\" was a bit overrated, \"We Rock\" fixes the speedy Dio intro song formula to a large degree. While I still think \"We Rock\" is a bit lacking, Dio's vocal melodies are really catchy, and the chorus is more explosive. Jimmy and Vinny are also both flying across this track, which adds a lot more depth to it. In fact, this album might be Vinny Appice's best overall drumming work in his entire career. He is thunderous all over the entire album. \"I Speed at Night\" shows some of his slamming chops and he also fires off some outstanding little grooves and fills. He is doing more than keeping the tempo for \"We Rock\" and \"I Speed at Night.\" He is the injection of energy to give these two quicker paced songs the flow they needed. \"I Speed at Night\" is signature Dio, too. It's just a really fun track with a fantastic chorus on top of everything else.\n\n\"Eat Your Heart Out\" and \"Breathless\" are two tracks that show that even the 'sleeper' tracks of the album are better than even some of the more memorable tracks on \"Holy Diver.\" \"Eat Your Heart Out\" has a teasing nature to it thanks to Dio's dramatic performance. It's another track that is just pure fun in the most metal way. Dio's layered chorus vocals add a bit more depth to the song, and make it more memorable than it might have been without it. \"Eat Your Heart Out\" is far from a legendary song, but it adds a lot of fun to the album, and that's all it had to do. \"Breathless\" does much of the same thing. In fact, if you listen to the chorus, and change the word 'breathless' to 'breakfast,' I guarantee you it'll be even more fun for you. I did it one time and literally cannot unhear it anymore. \"Breathless\" might have been an even more memorable track if Vivian was a better riff writer, but Dio's dynamic performance is able to save him and then some.\n\nAnd as I say that, the closer \"Egypt\" is definitely the best riff he ever wrote in his career. In fact, I wouldn't doubt if Dio asked him to give him something Sabbath-y for one song, and this was Vivian's take on Iommi. The only shame is that the intro riff only comes back one more time throughout the song, so it's actually almost a waste of the best riff of his life more than anything. Fortunately, the song is outstanding even despite the wasted riff. Dio's story-telling-type vocals are on full display here. The track is mystically fantasy fueled, and almost calls back to his Rainbow days in the way he lays the story out with his voice. This song gives itself a lot of room to breathe and experiment, and all of the chances they took pay off. \"One Night in the City\" is a pretty underrated track off the album, too. Fans of this album in particular give it the credit it deserves, but the track has enough depth to be given more attention. Vivian gives a solid opening riff that once again he wastes by barely utilizing beyond this intro. Again, though, Dio is there to save the day. His magical vocals shine by adding layers at very specific, deliberate times.\n\nIf I had to pick a weak point on the album, the only track I can really point out is \"Mystery.\" It's not that I dislike \"Mystery,\" but...even for me it's at the limit of my cheese tolerance. Through the opening keyboard work, it sounds strongly like it was supposed to be this album's \"Rainbow in the Dark,\" but while \"Rainbow in the Dark\" was able to walk that fine line between catchy and not being too groan worthy, \"Mystery\" dives head first into the sappy cheese filling. It's pretty clearly screaming for radio airplay, and the almost desperation to turn out a single from this record that is present on \"Mystery\" really ends up being a strike against it. Not the worst Dio has ever made, but I think to really get into \"Mystery,\" your cheese tolerance needs to be exceptionally high. I have a pretty high tolerance for it, but it overwhelmed even me.\n\n\"The Last in Line\" is one of the few albums that makes me hesitate in only rating albums in increments of 5%. I absolutely think this record is hands down better than \"Holy Diver,\" but at the same time...I don't think it's quite spectacular enough to sit at a 95%. So at the end of the day, I give this album the same rating I gave to \"Holy Diver,\" even though I think it's better. Both albums are consistent and quality records, but I think \"The Last in Line\" cuts to the chase and gets rid of some of the nonsense that \"Holy Diver\" had in it. Either way, Dio was standing strong with his first two records and still had one more album with his initial lineup to give us. Unfortunately, that last effort with this lineup just wouldn't have the heart these two had.\n",
        "\nIf you've seen some of my other reviews, it should come as no surprise that I'm a massive fan of Ronnie James Dio. However, that being said, I do have to admit that I am far more interested in his days with Black Sabbath and Rainbow than I am with his solo band. While Dio is a legend among legends, I do feel that he needed another of those legends among legends in the form of Tony Iommi or Ritchie Blackmore to help bring the best out of him. Almost as if Dio rose to the challenge to not be outdone by other famous figures around him. When left to his own devices with more 'normal' guitarists around him, his efforts are still fantastic...but not quite perfection like he had going with the other two bands.\n\n\"Holy Diver\" is no exception. It's a legendary album, and certainly deserves to be seen that way. For me, \"Holy Diver\" is consistently a great record...but never once does it hit \"outstanding.\" And that's not necessarily a bad thing! However, comparing \"Holy Diver\" to \"Heaven and Hell\" (even though I much prefer Mob Rules) or \"Rising\" isn't even close. The later two run rings around \"Holy Diver.\" For his first solo effort, Dio brought Vinny Appice with him from his Sabbath days, rekindled a friendship with Jimmy Bain from his Rainbow years, and recruited then newcomer Vivian Campbell as a guitarist. Again, this might be another shocking thing to say, but I personally find Vivian to be the worst overall guitarist Dio ever had. Vivian is a very good lead guitarist...but his ability to write riffs leaves much to be desired. Future Dio guitarists would pretty much all surpass him in terms of riff writing, and almost all would at least equal his lead work. \n\nThe title track to the album is actually one of the best riffs he has ever made. That riff is definitely the fuel that powers the engine for the song. \"Holy Diver\" is another track that I can't really say what hasn't been said before. Vivian's playing is dynamite, Vinny and Jimmy lay the perfect backbone and Dio's dramatic vocals make the song an experience. Vivian's solo is given space and breathing room to make it punchy. It's an absolute classic. \"Rainbow in the Dark\" is the other song from this debut that really needs no introduction or explanation. The keyboards walk a tightrope of being catchy and JUST happy enough to not fall over into 'too cheesy' territory. Vivan's main verse riff on the song isn't his best work, but it is a solid and energetic enough riff for Dio and the keys to be the star on top of. The track is a deserving fan favorite because of just how incredibly catchy, fun, and mystical it is. Almost funny to think that Dio initially hated the song and nearly destroyed the master tape to what would become arguably his most famous song.\n\n\"Straight Through the Heart\" might be my favorite on the record. Vinny Appice shows what an underrated drummer he is on this track. His intro is very nuanced, and non-drummers might not even really notice that. He is also sprinkling the song all over with tasty little beats and fills. The song also has one of Vivian's better riffs, and Dio is full of burning fire throughout. Every word is sung with deep emotion and passion. He uses sadness and anger in all the right ways to paint the picture. I also have a soft spot for \"Caught in the Middle.\" It's the pre-chorus that hits me hardest. It has a progressive riff, and some of Dio's most emotional and soaring vocals on the album. The verses are nothing special, but that pre-chorus and the subsequent chorus very much are. It definitely isn't the highlight of Dio's career, but it's impactful and memorable for me. Of course, \"Don't Talk to Strangers\" is another classic from \"Holy Diver,\" again, for good reason. It's a very beautiful and equally emotional track while still having a mysterious nature to it. It then evolves to being a very heavy hitting and aggressive track. Jimmy Bain has some of his best work here, too.\n\nOn the flip side, I could do without \"Invisible.\" It it the clear track to point to to talk about how bad a riff writer Vivian is. You cannot get more stock, generic, uninspired riffs as he showcases on \"Invisible.\" Dio doesn't really do much to save it, either. His vocals definitely are on the cheesier side, and although his passion is still there as prominently as always, since the guitar work behind him is so laughably bad, it makes it hard to take him seriously. This one comes off as cringy and forgettable at best for me. I will also commit the grave sin of calling \"Stand Up and Shout\" overrated. It's certainly not a bad song by any means but...it's another Dio fan favorite, and it just does nothing for me. It makes me think it's popular just because it is a quicker paced track and has a rebellious spirit that seems to embody metal fans. Luckily, it's a rather short track, so it's far from a detraction of the record, but it always left me scratching my head because I see nothing that special about it.\n\nWhen Dio left Sabbath on rather poor terms and decided to make his own band, he had a lot to prove. This album absolutely NEEDED to prove that he could swim in the waters of legends on his own, and wasn't just being kept in the game because of the legends he had partnered with to this point in his career. There is no doubt that \"Holy Diver\" successfully did that for him. While I much prefer him in the other two bands, I'd go as far to say that Dio truly became DIO on this record. He no longer could just be waved off as \"the guy who replaced Ozzy\" or \"Ritchie's sloppy seconds.\" He was a legend in his own right, and he could not and would not be denied.\n",
        "\nVivian Campbell didn't get on well with Dio, so he left the band after some hostilities and formed Riverdogs, where he wasn't that successful. However, Vivian always knew how to make profitable his stay in Dio's band, that's why he auditioned for Def Leppard and Thin Lizzy. Apart from that, doesn't seem right the fact that Campbell (his right maybe yet he's not elegant) didn't establish good friendships with Dio. They just never got along, then Vivian took advantage of Dio's legacy looking not very chivalrous for that matter.\n\nCraig Goldy joined in and understood Dio wonderfully, so a very strong friendship bond was born between them. Some will say he's less talented than Campbell but he fulfills his role as a guitarist. This album reached #43 on the American Billboard: it's late 80's, the goose that lays the golden eggs had disappeared and Dio had to be renewed. That was a tough road in their career, trying to sound like commercial bands but it mostly happened in 90s and it's another business. Dream Evil has a high quality appreciated throughout this whole trip, without fillers. There's a certain distance respecting the first two albums but it at least surpasses Sacred Heart.\n\nAll the Fools Sailed Away is probably the coolest one. There's a very slick keyboard and guitar interlude, with a very atmospheric solo that proves Craig Goldy wasn't really one-armed. Naked in the Rain follows the line of the previous track with its basic, primitive mid-paced. It shows off the rock essence and it's the most commercial point on the album. Dio's talent for vocals and his capacity as a composer helped him to gain audiences from different worlds and as a result, a large fan base professed genuine devotion to him. Also, Dio's ability to combine the easy-listening hard rock and European-style heavy metal adds actually points. In short, Ronnie was determined to apply the well-known maintenance formula: \"If it works, don't fix it\".\n\n\"Night People\" is built on a simple guitar base but with surprising solos that lead to the title track with a riff powerfully reminiscent of Rainbow's Man On The Silver Mountain, but with a more commercial twist outstanding a magnificent chorus. \"Sunset Superman\" has a keyboard-based intro that doesn't announce an as snappy song as it finally turns outta be. Jimmi Bain does some exceptional bass lines as stand out above the rest songs. Side A closes beautifully with the semi-powerballad \u201cAll The Fools Sailed Away\u201d with its dramatic, theatrical chorus like few others. It shines like a classic and one of the most consistent of Dio's career, without a doubt.\n\nSide B begins with a strong keyboard presence as Dio doubles his voice as he only knows how to do, while Craig Goldie proves he's far better on solos than on rhythmic riffs. \u201cOverlove\u201d returns the pulse and tension as one of the fastest, something you wouldn't say judging by the strange, bluesy intro reminiscent of some Blackmore's work. Then, the modest point on the album: \u201cI Could Have Been a Dreamer\u201d looks like an AC/DC school riffs with parts of Brian Adams-like. \"When A Woman Cries\" recovers the hard rock legacy with a beautiful keyboard performance, courtesy of Claude Schnell. People will say this album was an irregular moment for a career that supposedly never shone again as it really deserves, although it never faded away really.\n\nTime doesn't forgive and much less in the heavy metal business as there are many prepared musicians who push from below with the \"renew or die\" commandment. Judas Priest, Accept, Iron Maiden, Gary Moore, Whitesnake, Scorpions, Saxon had abandoned their classic sound in the mid-80s, orienting it towards American metal, so there was no reason to think Dio would resist it. In fact, there were two aspects that made us think Ronnie was going to take a break and not a change: on the one hand there was Campbell's farewell, a traumatic event comparable to what Randy's death meant for Ozzy at the time, and on the other hand, the fact their previous album was seen as a live album-like, which gave rise to think that Dream Evil would come with renewed sounds.\n",
        "\nThis is my first review on this website so why not start with the latest album I listened to.\n\nI am yet to hear all albums by Dio, but out of all the albums that I have heard, Master Of The Moon was by far the biggest letdown. My biggest complaint is easily the tempo of the album. Don't get me wrong. I have nothing against slow songs, but what made the other Dio albums that I have listened to so good was the combination between fast-paced rockers and slower, more moody tracks. Even this albums predecessor, \"Killing The Dragon\", had a solid mix of fast and slow. On Master Of The Moon though, the slow songs take up way more space than what benefits the album. The only songs on here that can be considered to be remotely fast is the opening track \"One More For The Road\" and \"Living The Lie\". Those also happens to be my favorite songs on the album. \n\nSlow in itself doesn't have to be a problem though. Strange Highways has a lot of slow elements but is still a phenomenal album. The key is to make the slower songs memorable and to stand out. That's my other issue with Master Of The Moon. The songs are just bland and unmemorable. On Dios earlier album the riffs and the vocals were memorable and easily stuck in your head. Here I struggle to recall anything from any song apart from the two mentioned above. The riffs feels tired and uninspired. Dios vocals, while excellent as always, doesn't have anything exciting and upliftning to work with. The vocal melodies are very bland and easy to forget. The only slow songs that I can tolerate is the title track and \"The End Of The World\". Other than that it's mostly a snoozefest. There are also a couple of songs that are simply bad. \"I Am\" has a horrible chorus that quickly goes from annoying to unbearable and \"Eye\" has a recurring guitar effect that not only is annoying but also overused on the roughest. If it wasn't for the fact that listened to this album for the first time yesterday, I would have skipped those songs fast.\n\nAs a whole, Master Of The Moon is a huge disappointment for me. Slow and tired songs filled with uninspired guitar rifffs and vocal melodies. There are 3-4 tracks that I consider to be pretty good, but they can't save the album from getting a mediocre score. On the other hand, there are few things on this album that I consider to be outright insulting so I won't go below 50 %. The production is still good, Dios vocal performace is still fantastic and the musicianship, even though it's tired and faceless, is still solid. There is nothing objectively wrong with Master Of The Moon but.. man did I expect more. As the swan song to Dios discography I consider it to be an anticlimactic disappointment. Luckily Ronnie James Dio got a better and more worthy swan song by doing \"The Devil You Know\" with Heaven And Hell.\n",
        "\nMore than a decade since one of the founding fathers of heavy metal departed this world to take his place among the legends, Ronnie James Dio\u2019s legacy as a prognosticator of all things metallic and fantastical, remains without question. However, for those of us whom predate the millennial generation, there was a time where this mighty teller of tales was considered persona non grata in the very nation that birthed him, as the nihilistic wave of grunge that swept in with the 1990s made no distinctions between the teased hair craze of Poison and Nelson and the original, hard-hitting heavy metal that originally kicked off the 1980s. The same fearless metal crusader that was filling arenas and doing battle with a mechanical dragon in the mid-80s found himself struggling to fill moderate sized clubs, despite the darker tone that would be struck by the harrowing anthems of Strange Highways and the sludge-infused, progressive experimentation of Angry Machines. Metal itself seemed to be in the proverbial wilderness insofar as the continental United States was concerned, with Ronnie James as its steadfast prophet continuing to preach the creeds of old.\n\nBut times were destined for a needed change, and shortly after the close of the 90s the once fallen star found itself shining brightly in the sky once more. Though a highly ambitious conceptual offering with symphonic trimmings dubbed Magica would signal a needed return to form for this outfit, it was the 2002 follow up Killing The Dragon that truly rekindled the old flame in the eyes of the public, hearkening back stylistically to the commercial heyday of the band when Vivian Campbell was rocking the six-string. Despite bassist Jimmy Bain being the only other original member in congress from said era, the brilliant emulation of Campbell\u2019s agitated shredding style and busy riffing by the newly acquired Doug Aldrich made Dio\u2019s 9th studio LP the quintessential piece of 80s revivalism graced by a few modern touches to reawaken the sleeping masses to what they had been missing for the past decade. Given the tone that was thus struck, it stood to reason that an accompanying live release marking this era of revitalization was in order, and a beast of one was accomplished in the closing weeks of 2002 in Evil Or Divine: Live In New York City.\n\nThe aforementioned extravaganza that was first offered up to the masses in the visual medium in 2003 has been given a fresh new packaging, complete with an epic depiction of long-time mascot Murray donning angel wings and doing battle with the prince of darkness himself. However, the true prize is to be found in the game of notes found within, chronicling the most epic performance ever given by an elder statesman of the metal nations in his early 60s. The tempo of things is generally fast and flashy, spearheaded by an assortment of swift numbers, the lion\u2019s share of which being from Dio\u2019s seminal LPs Holy Diver and The Last In Line, with Killing The Dragon ranking a close third. Blistering fits of high octane splendor such as \u201cStand Up And Shout\u201d, \u201cDon\u2019t Talk To Strangers\u201d and closing cruiser \u201cWe Rock\u201d bring home the intensity like it\u2019s going out of style, blurring the lines between the old school sound and its somewhat younger speed metal cousin. Even more moderately paced rockers such as \u201cRainbow In The Dark\u201d and \u201cHoly Diver\u201d come off as speed-happy given Aldrich\u2019s and drummer Simon Wright\u2019s highly animated performances.\n\nThe tempo factor is not alone in showcasing the band\u2019s efforts in turning back the clock just under 20 years, as the entire structure of the set itself caters heavily to the practices that were commonplace in Dio\u2019s performances during the mid-1980s. The practice of combining similar songs into medley performances sees a fairly unique coupling with the doom-leaning yet Rainbow-inspired \u201cEgypt (The Chains Are On)\u201d and the pounding mid-paced Black Sabbath epic \u201cChildren Of The Sea\u201d, while audience participation reaches its peak during the obligatory extended jam version of \u201cHeaven And Hell\u201d, though interestingly Dio opts to break with their 80s practice of omitting the up tempo closing section of the songs to truly climactic results. In fact, the only time where this performance totally falls into mid-80s orthodoxy is the rendition of \u201cMan On The Silver Mountain\u201d, which is played at a much faster tempo relative to its original studio version after the same fashion that both Vivian Campbell and Craig Goldie had performed it during their first respective runs with the band.\n\nThough no moment during this magical undertaking can really be overstated, it\u2019s difficult to avoid obsessing over the massive array of talent that is exhibited between the instrumentalists involved here. Following the mid-paced banger and radio hit off Killing The Dragon \u201cPush\u201d, former AC/DC drummer Simon Wright delivers a truly astounding drum solo performance, which also sees him cycling through a few moments of symphonic pomp in the background to showcase his ability to blend his frenzied fills and bombastic hits in with an organized, consonant backdrop. Similarly, the wild technical brilliance on display during Doug Aldrich\u2019s guitar solo break following \u201cMan On The Silver Mountain\u201d revivals the sonic mayhem that Craig Goldie trotted out during the Sacred Heart tour back in \u201986, cycling through multiple stylistic tropes while also making way for keyboardist Scott Warren to show his skills at playing Jon Lord to Aldrich\u2019s Blackmore on steroids. The only member of the fold whom seems content to play the support role is Jimmy Bain, but his contributions to the arrangement are highly noticeable despite the lack of overt virtuosity.\n\nAll that being as it may, this was Ronnie James Dio\u2019s hour of brilliance, and he delivered at every possible moment. While some may deride him as being the Mariah Carey of heavy metal given his propensity to highly embellish his own vocal lines and also ad lib streams of notes during the finales of every song, each little modification that he brings to the table proves more than fitting and further reveals a man that was fully tapped into the energy being sent to the stage by the audience and forthwith in projecting it back outward. The raw talent and energy on display is tempered by an earnest intent to put on the best show possible for all in attendance, and is always chased by a barrage of gratitude in the most down to earth fashion. It all culminates in one of the most poignant moments in metal history where a once battered and beaten hero has been given his long overdue welcome back into the festive hall that he once called home. It\u2019s a bittersweet homecoming as said metal champion has been gone from our midst for over 10 years, but a lasting testament to a genius who laid the foundations for the music that we all love. \n\nOriginally written for Sonic Perspectives (www.sonicperspectives.com)\n",
        "\nY'know, the past year has actually been pretty damn good for Ronnie James Dio. Too bad he's not alive to enjoy it. But over the past twelve months a total of eight of his albums have been re-released & remastered for a whole new audience. Each one a vast sonic improvement over the original release. Hot on the heels of the two Black Sabbath American remasters of \"Heaven And Hell\" & \"Mob Rules\", comes two live solo albums from the 00's, \"Evil Or Divine: Live In NYC 2002\" & \"Holy Diver Live\". I bought the last two together & just finished listening to \"Evil Or Divine\", an album I must admit I never bothered with when it was new mainly because of the live album \"Dio's Inferno\" 2CD set was only five years older than this one. First would be the packaging, now with full & alternative artwork, a new front cover art done by the same artist that did Dio's remastered solo box-set (don't worry, the original's inside still), plus anything visually related to that tour throughout. However, with these Digibooks, they insist on having sleeves hold the discs instead of trays, and yes, a CD can get damaged going inside and out. But the remastering is what's most looked at here, and again BMG Records has done Dio right. Loud yet not even close to brickwalling, Dio's voice sounds so clear and the instruments have great separation throughout. Yet another great performance of Ronnie's for the record books.\n\nHowever, I must admit, I have heard the Dio band sound better. This version of the band features only one original musical member, bassist Jimmy Bain, with the \"Killing The Dragon\" line-up of ex-Whitesnake guitarist Doug Aldrich, ex-AC/DC drummer Simon Wright, and future Heaven & Hell keyboardist Scott Warren. While this seems like a powerful line-up, and it is, I have heard other line-up's, both original & new, of Dio's family tree perform these songs more closely to the original than here and when they stray off the path, others have been more interesting and successful doing it. Not to say this live album is a stinker, it isn't, but with at least five different officially released live albums under the solo Dio name, others like \"Dio's Inferno:The Last In Live\" or \"Finding The Sacred Heart:Live In Philly\" might be a better starting point.\n\nAs for the set-list itself, it follows the usual Dio touring of three or four current album songs, with the best of the classic first three & a few Sabbath/Rainbow hits. What's cool about this re-release is this time you get the entire concert where the original 2003 release was edited down to just one CD. Now you get an extra track, the rare \"Lord Of The Last Day\", and Wright's drum solo. In fact, there's even two tracks just dedicated to Dio banter & even the chant of \"Dio, Dio, Dio!\" for an encore. Not really big bonuses there, but at least a little different and complete. So, if you still miss the \"big little guy of Metal\" and never listened to these newly remastered 2000's performances before, it's a nice treat to have in such clarity. Yes, Dio's coming back with a vengeance, and with these remastered reissues, Heaven nor Hell will stop him!\n",
        "\nFor better or worse, the mid 80s was the zenith of Dio's popularity as a force in the metal mainstream, achieved largely due to a more polished blend of past influences that first took shape on their sophomore outing The Last In Line and reached its full form with 1985's Sacred Heart. The sound of the aforementioned 3rd studio album was of a much lighter and streamlined character when compared to any past or subsequent studio outing by Ronnie and company, drawing heavy comparisons to the keyboard-steeped AOR sound that had become ascendant throughout the L.A. scene and had cross-pollinated with much of rest of the heavy metal world. The resulting world tour would feature one of the most extravagant stage shows ever conceived, selling out massive venues and solidifying Dio as one of the premier acts of the American metal scene. But naturally with a rise to great heights can come a great fall, and in their particular case, this would be the unceremonious exodus of original guitarist Vivian Campbell.\n\nTo say that Vivian had a massive number of loyalists within Dio's fan base would be an understatement, largely due to his highly unique blend of agitated shred guitar gymnastics and busy, yet traditionally rooted riffing. Even if Ronnie had opted to replace him with Yngwie Malmsteen, Brad Gillis, or one of any number of prominent virtuoso players featured on the recently released Hear 'N' Aid song, this crowd would have refused to accept the outcome. Nevertheless, the choice of Craig Goldy of Giuffria, arguably one of the lightest acts of the entire glam rock scene, was a curious one that must have confounded even Dio's most ardent supporters going back to the days of Rainbow. Given that Vivian's departure occurred in the midst of a tour that was seeing record turnout, a demonstration of Goldy's abilities was naturally in order to calm the fears of any doubters, and it came in the form of a new studio song accompanying a selection of live offerings from the first half of the Sacred Heart tour with Campbell still in the band.\n\nAlthough the resulting EP dubbed Intermission could be seen as a necessary way of easing fans into a substantial lineup change, its musical functionality is, at best, redundant. There are some unique nuanced in the performance of the live material relative to the Japan exclusive live video release Super Rock: Live In Japan, but an untrained ear could easily mistake these renditions for the ones found on said album, minus maybe a slightly lower audio quality. The usual flaws that persisted in Vivian's interpretation of Rainbow classics \"Man On The Silver Mountain\" and \"Long Live Rock And Roll\", namely the tempo being way too fast and his soloing coming off as a bit spastic (his one-dimensional air of agitated passion clashes with Blackmore's mellower original conception of these songs), which is mitigated somewhat by the songs being interwoven into a medley with \"Rock 'N' Roll Children\" and thus being shorter. For his part, Ronnie himself proves to be the key feature of these performances, engaging the audience with a barrage of cheers and ad lib shouts.\n\nUltimately, the main draw of this release is the exclusive studio song \"Time To Burn\", which features newcomer Craig Goldy assuming Vivian's role and showcasing why he's ultimately the better of the two. While the song itself is a fairly methodical and mid-paced anthem after the mold of most of the material found on Sacred Heart, it showcases a degree of poise and idiomatic soloing that is far more nuanced, and also more engaging. While Campbell would only occasionally veer into melodically consonant territory during his frenetic solos, Goldy tells stories with his lead work that builds off existing melodic material within the song and while no less technically impressive than Vivian's handiwork, proves to be far more memorable. It's a massive silver-lining on what is otherwise a middle of the road collection of live performances, to the point where this studio respite between both legs of the Sacred Heart tour could be treated as the Time To Burn single with an extended b-side. It's more a historical curiosity for collectors than anything else, and apart from the song in question, is not really an essential part of Dio's highly consistent catalog.\n",
        "\nThe legacy of the man on the silver mountain, known to the masses as Ronnie James Dio, is about as contentious as it is universally recognized. It is particularly so regarding the competing eras that took shape at the duration of the 1980s, with rival camps debating not only which guitarist was the better contributor to the Dio sound between Vivian Campbell and Craig Goldy, but whether or not the latter era was even legitimate. The sense of loyalty that certain old school fans have towards Campbell, in spite of the vast array of amazing songs that followed his exodus from the fold and decades of bad blood that followed, borders on cult-like. Nevertheless, the live releases that came about during both eras definitely betray two radically different stage personas and stylistic quirks, bringing some legitimacy to the rationale behind this schism between fans, and no clearer are these distinctions made than during the two legs of the Sacred Heart tour that ran from 85-86, each featuring one or the other shredder performing 97% of the same set in radically different ways.\n\nAlong with the Super Rock '85 In Japan release, the Like A Beat Of A Heart single represents the last rays of twilight in Campbell's collaboration with Dio, and even absent the visual indicators of the former release, it's pretty clear that Ronnie's original Irish six-string extraordinaire was cut from a more rock-based, working class mold than Goldy. There is a sense of looseness to how he works through the Deep Purple inspired crunch of the principle riff that points to more to the same NWOBHM feel of his Sweet Savage days, and the addition licks that he peppers over the extended outro of the song has more of a slovenly, late 70s vibe to it. Although the song itself functions as more of a keyboard-heavy variation/sequel of the punchy Holy Diver anthem \"Straight Through The Heart\" with some trace elements of \"Breathless\" off Last In Line, this particular performance is given something of an epic upgrade during its aforementioned outro, as Ronnie does his usual shtick of revving up the crowd before the band nails that classic free time wall of sound ending that was perhaps a bit overused during the height of the 80s metal craze.\n\nIf nothing else, this single stands as something of an outlier in Dio's catalog, featuring exclusively live content from three different tours, yet it stands as one of the more worthy ones to check out for those outside the completist camp who want a slightly better understanding of how the Campbell era worked in a live setting. The inclusion of the iconic opener off both the Last In Line album and subsequent 1984 tour \"We Rock\" along with the debut album title track on the '83 tour provide a timeline of growth and development during Vivian's tenure, each performance seemingly becoming slightly more fancy and tech-based, perhaps lending some credence to the complaints that Campbell would make later on that Ronnie wanted something closer to a Malmsteen sound, though his tapping of Goldy to replace Campbell tends to cut against that notion given the former's more disciplined, albeit still more virtuoso presentation. The author of this review's tendency to prefer Goldy not withstanding, this is a solid set of performances and definitely a good listen for any old school metal head.\n",
        "\nOne can\u2019t overstate the dominant role that Ronnie James Dio played in his tenures with Rainbow and Black Sabbath. He may have been on equal footing with legendary control freaks like Tony Iommi and Ritchie Blackmore, but they were clearly accommodating their writing styles to match his instead of the other way around. Guys like Ian Gillan and Ozzy Osbourne seemed content with weaving their vocal lines around long-winded jams, but Ronnie was the kind of singer to demand that the riffs be played around him.\n\nThus, it isn\u2019t too surprising that Dio\u2019s debut album is such a streamlined affair. Songs like the title track and \u201cDon\u2019t Talk to Strangers\u201d avoid running verse-chorus structures into the ground, but their arrangements still adhere to the vocal lines. There\u2019s very little wiggle room for the musicians to meander about beyond brief but flashy solo sections and climactic codas that are only extended when Dio is either ad libbing or, in the case of the outro on \u201cShame on the Night,\u201d has already finished saying what he wants to say.\n\nThankfully Dio surrounded himself with some extraordinarily talented musicians to keep this formula from reaching critical masses of self-indulgence. Bassist Jimmy Bain and drummer Vinnie Appice were reliable in their respective stints with Rainbow and Sabbath, and they both prove to be just as talented here. Appice puts more muscle here than he did on The Mob Rules and I swear Bain\u2019s tone is one of the most recognizable in 80s metal.\n\nGuitarist Vivian Campbell proved to be the group\u2019s wild card. Plucked from Sweet Savage and now criminally underused in the likes of Def Leppard, his tone gives the riffs on \u201cStand Up and Shout\u201d a razor-sharp bite, while his acrobatic leads give songs like \u201cInvisible\u201d a great deal of character. His performance is just as hungry as that of his mentor, but his contributions are tasteful enough to avoid stepping on anybody else\u2019s toes.\n\nThrough all this early 80s bravado, the band was smart enough to remember that the songwriting matters above all else. There may not be anything as epic as the likes of \u201cHeaven and Hell\u201d or \u201cGates of Babylon,\u201d but songs like the title track were clearly composed in the same spirit. \u201cRainbow in the Dark\u201d is a classic in all its cheesy, keyboard drenched glory, and even the straightforward rockers like \u201cGypsy\u201d and \u201cCaught in the Middle\u201d deserve attention.\n\nHoly Diver could\u2019ve easily been the power trip of a vocally gifted egomaniac, and it honestly may very well be one, but Dio\u2019s delivery is based more on confidence than outright self-indulgence. The performances are all worthy of note and there is a slew of timeless classics throughout, even if the presentation can be rather dated at times. Bands like Iron Maiden and Metallica were the real trailblazers of 1983, but I don\u2019t need to tell you that this is still mandatory listening.\n\nHighlights:\n\u201cStand Up and Shout\u201d\n\u201cHoly Diver\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t Talk to Strangers\u201d\n\u201cInvisible\u201d\n\u201cRainbow in the Dark\u201d\n\nOriginally published at http://indymetalvault.com\n",
        "\nRonnie James Dio's highly volatile early career finally found some stability when the critically acclaimed singer with the skilled theatrical vocals formed his solo band and released the iconic Holy Diver. The record has everything heavy metal stood for in the eighties and is rightfully considered a classic. The talented singer moved away from his early progressive rock soundscapes and doom metal stylistics to release an album focusing on consistent, fast and short anthems and slightly more elaborate mid-paced atmospheric tracks. The first category is best represented by vivid opener ''Stand Up and Shout'' that makes you want to do exactly this. The second type is exemplified by title track ''Holy Diver'' with its atmospheric introduction leading into a memorable anthem.\n\nEverything is focused on Dio's expressive vocals that work very well overall, especially in the often overlooked hard rocking ''Caught in the Middle'' where he finds the right balance between control and emotion. However, Dio also has the tendency to put too much emotion into his vocals when he is loudly singing ''uh!'' and ''yeah!'' on multiple occasions instead of giving his excellent backing band the occasion to shine as in the overtly dramatic ''Straight Through the Heart''. It's obvious where singers like James Hetfield got their inspiration and while Dio's signature sound is quite unique, it gets somewhat repetitive and tiring after a while.\n\nThe backing band shouldn't be overlooked. Vinny Appice's drum play is powerful and precise as he always finds the right approach to slow songs down or speed them up with his versatile performance. Guitarist Vivian Campbell comes around with incredibly catchy riffs that aren't a far call from Tony Iommi's skills as in the excellent ''Holy Diver'' but he also lets himself loose in some emotional yet skilled solos as in the brilliant ''Don't Talk to Strangers''. Bass guitar is performed by Jimmy Bain and adds the typical stylistic galloping sound to the record that infuses an extra dose of energy. Along with Dio himself, he is also responsible for the keyboard sounds on this release. This instrument wasn't very common for heavy metal records back then but is perfectly employed in small doses on this release as one can witness in the eerie opening passage of ''Holy Diver'' and the uplifting melody of ''Rainbow in the Dark''. Keyboard sounds have rarely sound as perfectly integrated in heavy metal records as here. The sound by experienced producer George Marino is very organic and manages to make every instrument sound present.\n\nFillers are nowhere to be found on this record. It must be pointed out that along obvious classics like ''Stand Up and Shout'', ''Holy Diver'' and ''Rainbow in the Dark'', there are many forgotten pearls to be found on this release like the emotional epic ''Don't Talk to Strangers'' and the melodic yet hard rocking ''Caught in the Middle''. The only songs that might not be excellent are the quite short and overtly expressive ''Gypsy'' that ends on a lazy fade-out after just three minutes and the over-performed ''Straight Through the Heart''.\n\nDio's Holy Diver deserves its status as heavy metal classic and hasn't lost any of its charm thirty-five years later. This record has stood the test of time and still represents everything heavy metal stands for. Let's note that the nine tracks sound even better live which can be heard on the remastered deluxe edition that includes the excellent bonus song ''Evil Eyes'' that should have replaced ''Gypsy'' and numerous live tracks but missed the occasion to feature an entire concert recording. Still, if you don't own this album yet, go grab this deluxe edition and enjoy some solidly crafted heavy metal.\n",
        "\nThe album reviewed here got such a wide circulation around the Bulgarian radio channels in 1987 that at some stage there wasn\u2019t a single metal head in the country who didn\u2019t have it in a safe place in his/her collection. Dio\u2019s \u201cThe Last in Line\u201d vinyl was readily available in the record shops before that, further adding to the guy\u2019s enormous popularity on the other side of the Iron Curtain. For some reason Dio, Black Sabbath, and Scorpions were not banned during the 80\u2019s so their albums were easy to find in the studios while Twisted Sister, W.A.S.P., Judas Priest, and Iron Maiden, to give a few examples, were featured prominently on the very top of those \u201cbanned bands\u201d lists. Ridiculous, truly ridiculous stuff, but what could you do; such were the times\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s quite ironic, in a sad way though, that it was the Epitome of Metal (R.I.P.) who tested the poppy, radio-friendly waters with \u201cSacred Heart\u201d, helping Motley Crue, whose \u201cTheatre of Pain\u201d was released just a few months earlier, in the establishing of the cheesy side of metal. Not a very dignified moment from the man\u2019s discography, but all was forgiven as it sold very well, the audience picked on those new melodic sounds way too fast, and didn\u2019t exactly stain the man\u2019s career. \n\nOnce the album reviewed here came out, everyone sighed with enormous relief as apparently the previous opus was just an isolated experiment as \u201cNight People\u201d shows too well, a bouncy boisterous opener with an open speedy swagger regardless of the tangible keyboard presence. The title-track is the staple for the band hit with a big commercial potential, nothing overtly cheesy here; and \u201cSunset Superman\u201d is the next in line exhibition of less bridled energy, a glorious rousing anthem that sees our small, vociferous superman shaking off the cheese completely, serving one of the finest ballads of the 80\u2019s right after, \u201cAll the Fools Sailed Away\u201d, a poignant composition, one of the guy(s)\u2019 highest achievements. \u201cNaked in the Rain\u201d is a heavy brooder recalling the man\u2019s days with Black Sabbath in an introspective epic manner; and \u201cOverlove\u201d is the exact opposite to it, a brisk fast-paced cut with lashing riffs and breezy screamy leads. \u201cI Could Have Been a Dreamer\u201d is a sure reminder of the poppy aesthetics of the preceding album, a relaxed \u201cdreamy\u201d (definitely not evil) piece bordering on the semi-ballad, totally cancelled by the excellent \u201cFaces in the Window\u201d, another prime heavy metal anthem with a nice memorable chorus and dynamic semi-galloping tendencies. Back to the previous saga\u2019s mellower overtones with the closing \u201cWhen a Woman Cries\u201d, this time a full-fledged semi-ballad, but a good enough epitaph to this enjoyable, diverse roller-coaster. \n\nDio tried to balance things to an extent here since the last effort was at least a positive commercial step, but at the same time he didn\u2019t want to delineate his core fanbase, and the result was this compelling \u201cevil dream\u201d, a sure-handed entry into the 1987 heavy metal catalogue beside Warlock\u2019s \u201cTriumph & Agony\u201d, Black Sabbath\u2019s \u201cEternal Idol\u201d, Helloween\u2019s \u201cThe Keeper of the Seven Keys I\u201d, and Udo\u2019s \u201cAnimal House\u201d. For one thing, Dio was the main contender to the Big Five (Scorpions, Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Accept), and he managed to preserve both his integrity and the high quality of his music all the way to the end of the decade, including on the slightly divisive \u201cLock Up the Wolves\u201d. The Voice of Metal seldom put a foot wrong although some consider his ill-fated return to Sabbath territory in 1992 for \u201cDehumanizer\u201d one having in mind the acrimonious circumstances under which he had to leave again although the former comrades joined efforts once more under the Heaven & Hell moniker many years later. Even on the more experimental efforts (remember \u201cAngry Machines\u201d) during the 90\u2019s he left his trademark stamp, and who knows how many more interesting works he was going to provide for the fans if it wasn\u2019t for his untimely passing. The music world was robbed off one of its greatest artists, off one of the most important \u201cevil\u201d dreamers in metal history\u2026 rest in peace, and\u2026 Up the horns!\n",
        "\nAngry Machines is often seen as the epitome of mid-90s metal desperation. It is likely the most obscure album that Ronnie James Dio ever released and is solely remembered as a time when one of the biggest metal legends was reduced to chasing contemporary trends without a sign of resurgence in sight. Angry Machines isn\u2019t a masterpiece by any means, but it is certainly enjoyable when one is in the right nihilistic mindset.\n\nThe blend of doom and groove metal on 1994\u2019s Strange Highways was already a major departure from the days of Holy Diver. Angry Machines logically continues this style with a deeper emphasis on the groove side as Dio\u2019s vocals are at their nastiest and Tracey G\u2019s guitar playing has a greater emphasis on pitch harmonics and crunchy mid-tempo patterns. There\u2019s also a hint of industrial influence in the more ominous keyboard work, vocal filters on songs like \u201cBlack\u201d and \u201cBig Sister,\u201d and the uncanny mechanical interlude on \u201cStay Out of my Mind.\u201d\n\nBut what really makes Angry Machines stand out in Dio\u2019s discography is the seemingly conscious attempt to avoid being catchy in any conventional sense. Strange Highways and Black Sabbath\u2019s Dehumanizer before it weren\u2019t exactly singalongs but there were still plenty of ear catching riffs and vocal lines on them. With the exception of the traditional speedy \u201cDon\u2019t Tell the Kids,\u201d this album\u2019s memorability is based much more on dissonance and unconventional structuring. For the most part. it yields interesting results, but then you have the songs like \u201cHunter of the Heart\u201d and \u201cDouble Monday\u201d where things seem to just kind of happen with no real purpose.\n\nFortunately, decent writing and good musicianship does mean there are still solid songs on here. While some find the stop-start rhythm on \u201cBlack\u201d off putting, I think it accomplishes what it sets out to achieve and wouldn\u2019t have worked on any other album before it. Also worth noting is \u201cThis Is Your Life,\u201d a piano ballad that completely breaks form and closes things in a surprisingly touching fashion. It\u2019s tragic that the track has only been noticed in the wake of Dio\u2019s unfortunate passing, but it\u2019s better than if it had slipped completely through the cracks.\n\nWhile the tweaks to Dio\u2019s style and songwriting formula on Angry Machines do make it a somewhat disjointed listen, it is hardly a disaster. The band\u2019s chemistry and intent to shake things up do make it much less phoned in than something like Sacred Heart but many of its strengths were done better on Strange Highways and Dehumanizer. It\u2019s not an album to be \u201crediscovered\u201d or vindicated by time, but hardcore fans who\u2019ve already gone through Lock up the Wolves and Killing the Dragon may want to give this another evaluation.\n\nHighlights:\n\u201cDon\u2019t Tell the Kids\u201d\n\u201cBlack\u201d\n\u201cStay Out of my Mind\u201d\n\u201cThis Is Your Life\u201d\n\nOriginally published at http://indymetalvault.com\n",
        "\nDio's third album is far from the potential that the band showed in previous releases, especially, since they turned the initial signs of creative burnout present in \"The Last in Line into a blatant lack of ideas. Even worse, the band had the very brilliant idea of aligning their compositions with some of the trends that invaded the glam scene during the '80s (e.g., uninspired and sentimental synth drunk songs, cheesiness everywhere, and all that crap that fit the standards that MTV tried to impose). All these, in an aim of selling as many copies as a glam band and reaching the audiences that were obsessed with the glam music. Unfortunately, the results were too different from their expectations.\n\nSomething was wrong with the band. Campbell and Appice did not sound like themselves, and it seems that they had their hands tied and their brains turned off by the discographic company. What results more unbelievable is to find out that the lyrics of \"Just Another Day\" describe the band's songwriting work on this album: songs that were not done for pleasure and did not have any magic (perhaps two songs marked an exception). Numbers like \"Another Lie\" and \"Rock 'n' Roll Children\" are average Dio numbers with some good moments here and there, but they do not end up providing the riffs and drumming that much of the fanatics of the band were used to enjoy. As mentioned, they are just average.\n\nOn the other hand, the album highlights are two. The opening track is pretty much a combination of \"I Speed at Night\" and \"Breathless\" from the previous release and is another number that addresses the obsessions that Dio had with rock 'n' roll. But nothing here would be as good as the title song. This epic mid-paced doomish number is a riff-fest. It is precisely the way in which the band should have written the songs. Think about a mid-paced Black Sabbath number from Dio-era and make it more melodic, and what you obtain is this song.\n\nAside from these songs, in the rest of the album, there is nothing above the average nor even as outstanding as the stuff in earlier efforts, and the songs are rather silly, even though much of the Dio's trademark metaphoric songwriting techniques are present here. They could be comparable to something like M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce having a bad day. The album is remembered as the beginning of a debacle from which they were not able to entirely recover. Nonetheless, the next releases would show some improvements (starting with the next release), and at the end, this is not as bad as \"Angry Machines\", but definitely a step behind.\n",
        "\nDio took the world by surprise with this album, and also took the band back to life after the decadent predecessor. In general terms, the album is still following the basic blueprint from previous works, but this time, Dio was more focused on providing it with a melodic vibe rather than on pretending to make aggressive stuff. The riffs from their new guitarist are still harsh and heavy as hell, and the drumming work done by Appice came back to life, but the choruses are not as aggressive as they used to be. Rather, they are more catchy and melodic, which results hard to believe considering how powerful and emphatic was his voice.\n\nDespite the fact that the Campbell's departure from the band was like a strong punch in the face for the project, Dio moved quickly and hired the young talented guitarist Craig Goldy. He had a somehow similar guitar playing style, though Campbell was more fluent (let's say, somewhere around all those guitarists who were part of Shrapnel Records). Nevertheless, Goldy was efficient with his instrument and able to play solos at an acceptable speed, and he also played tremendously harsh riffs in the Campbell's vein. Of course, there are many examples throughout the album. And for his luck, he was not disturbed by the excessive keyboards used in a commercial aim for the previous release, nor even limited to their narrow-minded songwriting work, as Campbell was in \"Sacred Heart\". \n\nAppice took his drumming back to the levels of intensity and dynamism that the fanatics of the band were used to, being \"Over Love\" his most significant moment. That said, the album features an excellent set of songs. \"Night People\" is the kind of song that would be recurred in the next following releases (for instance, \"Better in the Dark\") and is fast and efficient. The title-song runs slower and is one of the most melodic moments in Dio's vocal performance. Its riffs are memorable, and the song itself is such an excellent composition. However, no one around would expect from Dio such a frenetic speed metal track in the levels of \"Over Love\". Even though the ZZ Top-inspired intro riff was not precisely the most appropriate way to begin such an insane track, the guitar playing work afterward is quite efficient. The solo is quite crazy, and it would make you move the tapes/CD backward like twenty times so that you can enjoy it over and over. Other interesting highlights include cuts like \"Sunset Superman\" and \"I Could Have Been a Dreamer\". Both songs are part of the melodic orientation of the band and are average Dio, except for the melodic passages of course.\n\nAlthough it is not an essential album, it is for sure a symbol of hope for a project that was deadly injured. Fortunately, Dio did not apart from this path, and the next following albums would be as good as this one (except for \"Angry Machines\", which is the most forgettable release in their catalog). However, the band will make some changes in their musical foundation going forward. The next album will show a more doomish sound from which the drumming style of Appice would never move, especially after the release of the Black Sabbath album \"Dehumanizer\". Having said the above, what you should do at this point is enjoy the album and let the music run wild.\n",
        "\nDio's 1990 record Lock Up the Wolves seems to be a bit underrated by many metal fans for reasons I'm unsure of, but I can say with confidence that this is one of my favorites from the Dio band. This album saw a complete lineup change, including slick 18 (18!) year old guitarist Rowan Robertson and AC/DC drummer Simon Wright. While the band is completely different from that of the previous Dio records, they actually meld together quite well, bringing a straightforward heavy metal sound akin to the older Dio style but with a bit of a bluesy swing. The album reflects this heavily, as there is a strong presence of slower, more absorbed bluesy sections throughout. A few of these tracks lack aggression and edge, but there are also some fierce rockers to spice things up when needed. Lock Up the Wolves stands on its own quite nicely, and it's actually one of my favorite Dio albums. \n\nLock Up the Wolves features a mixture of styles ranging from fast and energetic like \"Walk on Water\" to slower and bluesy like on \"Twisted\". Immediately upon listening to this album, something will strike you: this 18 year old guitarist can play. In fact, he kind of steals the spotlight from Ronnie. His riffs are creative and possessive of a driving quality while also having a bit of an improvised feel. Instead of the riffs being static and straightforward, Rowan throws in lots of fills and licks in between, making for an interesting and exciting feel that suits this style of heavy metal very well. In addition, most of these tracks feature lots of different musical sections and some energetic hooks and solos that add some further spice to some already creative songs. The solos are also pretty damn impressive, and they honestly are the best parts of each track on here. He has a vicious sense of melody and his licks are always a bit outside-of-the-box in a really tasty manner that hammers everything home with a bang. \n\nSo with a powerful performance like that, the rest of the band makes sure not to let his talents go to waste. While there are a few tracks that don't impress me on high levels, the majority of them definitely do. Most of Lock Up the Wolves features an energetic and aggressive feel that was touched upon on the previous Dio records, but totally blossoms here. Tracks like \"Wild One\" tap into a loose and driving energy that reminds me of classics like \"Stand Up and Shout\", and even the less aggressive songs still tap into the bluesy and creative vibe emanated by this line-up. This record shines the brightest when the songs are more creative and loose, as portrayed on each of the best tracks. The lyrics are also a bit more personal and deep compared to the fantasy element that ran rampant on the older material, and the atmosphere is locked together by Jens' subtle keyboard work. Generally, this album is a bit of a deviation from the typical Dio sound, but it's pulled off spectacularly and even the weaker moments have their own charm. \n\nAs you might guess, these weaker moments lie in the longer, slower tracks on the album such as \"Evil on Queen Street\" and the title track, which are nice and bluesy but severely lacking in terms of overall creativity and drive. I can't help but feel as if parts of the aforementioned tracks and \"Between two Hearts\" drag on a bit too long, and with minimal creativity or musical expression, relying too much on atmosphere and emotion. This same approach works best on songs like \"Hey Angel\" and especially \"Born on the Sun\" which combine this slower, more absorbed feel with catchy licks and soaring vocals to propel them along. However, the tracks lacking this extra mile tend to feel a bit mediocre with their limited expression and musicality. This is most obvious on the long title track which just sort of meanders about for the majority of its running time with minimal changes and musical sections. \n\nAll in all though, Lock Up the Wolves brings a heaping helping of quality, especially on the best tracks which would stack up to be some of the best tracks in the entire Dio catalog - especially tracks like \"Walk on Water\", \"Wild One\", \"Born on the Sun\", and my favorite Dio song ever: \"Why are They Watching Me\". The bluesy take that is added in here is quite unique, and it's pulled off exceptionally. The star of this album in my opinion isn't even Dio himself, but Rowan Robertson, whose phenomenal soloing and ever-changing riff style is seriously note-worthy. Overall, things come together excellently, and despite some of the weaker tracks, this ends up being a very enjoyable and badass metal album. I'd definitely recommend picking this album up if you haven't done so yet, as this set of interesting and creative songs should definitely come as a pleasant surprise. It's really a shame that this young guitarist never really made more of a name for himself, but his work is at least immortalized on this album. Even if it doesn't sit among your favorites, this will definitely be a more than worthy addition to your collection.\n",
        "\nEnergized by the tremendous success of the brilliant debut Holy Diver, the band released a marvelous sophomore effort that kept the style and virtues of its predecessor (e.g., the fast drumming of Vinny Appice and the fierce, demonic guitar playing of Vivian Campbell), as well as the brilliant and complex metaphoric compositions done by the creative mastermind and virtuous songwriter Ronnie James Dio. Unfortunately, the band neglected to refresh the formula that took the previous album to an impressing success, and as a result the album shows a slight burnout in the same. Maybe the constant use of the words \"rainbow\" and \"stone\" in the lyrics is not a big issue as those words had been remaining as a trademark of Dio's compositions since a long time ago, but the musicians started to play some weird notes and songs like \"Mystery\" (a weird attempt to make a new version of \"Rainbow in the Dark\").\n\nNonetheless, the album is still one of the best heavy metal releases, and it is a well done effort. There are still solid numbers and epic pieces that became even symbolic among the listeners of this music. In general terms, the album meets the heaviness of Black Sabbath (from Dio years) and some melodic arrangements from Rainbow songs like \"Do You Close Your Eyes?\" and \"Gates of Babylon\". Once again, Dio opens the album with an explosive song that seems to be a tribute to rock 'n' roll, that is \"We Rock\". Its catchy chorus and intense, harsh riffs evoke in the listener a desire of shouting and rocking together with the crowd like in \"Stand Up and Shout\" in a slower pace, though.\n\nSimilarly to the preceding album, the second track is the title-song and the most epic cut in the album. The difference however, is that it is progressive and a little bit slower than \"Holy Diver\", like if it was built in the blueprint of \"Heaven and Hell\". But the epicness does not stop here. There are other more intense numbers like \"One Night In the City\" and \"Egypt (The Chains are On)\", which were filled with an atmosphere that recall a day walking on the streets in the Ancient Egypt era. Regarding \"Mystery\", let's just leave things at that. It is better to skip any comment on this song and at some point the song itself.\n\nDespite the fact of the album showing a burnout in the ideas of the band, it remains as an excellent release filled with epic and mind-blowing songs. Its superior production work makes this album an astonishing and heavy piece of thunderous heavy metal, but a painful truth is that it will remain in the shadows of its predecessor regardless how earlier the former obtained the platinum certification. Widely recommended for those who loved the debut album and/or are interested in the genesis of power metal.\n",
        "\nRonnie James Dio, the little big man who became world famous when eventually joining Rainbow, Black Sabbath and of course singing on the Roger Glover song \u2018Love Is All\u2019 from 1975 which pretty much everyone knows, including our parents. He who even managed to become a succesful solo artist back in the eighties. 5 albums of him I still hold dearly from which 3 are utter highlights. \u2018Dream Evil\u2019 is one of these three.\n\u2018Dream Evil\u2019 was his fourth solo album in the eighties, following the more rock than metal oriented \u2018Sacred Heart\u2019 and stylewise went back to the first two. \n\nWe have two speed metal tunes. Full pace and rocking like madmen, \u2018Night People\u2019 and \u2018Overlove\u2019 from which the first is the better and the second is based around an incredibly good rocking riff. Of course, like on previous albums, the title track is a doom metal song with strong catchy chorus. Now the big ballad here \u2018All the Fools Sailed Away\u2019 is pretty damn good. Sensitive, dynamic, great catchy chorus. One of the finest Dio ballads ever written.\n\n\u2018Sunset Superman\u2019 is one of my most favorite Dio songs. The chorus might be simple but it is based about a powerful riff and the true strength of the song comes from the verses which combine superior riffing with one of Dio's strongest vocal lines. \u2018Faces In The Window\u2019 is an upbeat metal tune. Great pace, drive and majestic chorus. This is exactly what made eighties heavy metal so great!\n\nAs we all know, the more rock than metal oriented material from Dio CAN also be good. On the \u2018Sacred Heart\u2019 album the songs \u2018King Of Rock And Roll\u2019 and especially \u2018Hungry For Heaven\u2019 proved that Dio can sound more commercial yet still be catchy as hell. Those were amazing songs! The more maintstream rock on this album comes in the form of \u2018I Could Have Been a Dreamer\u2019, and \u2018When a Woman Cries\u2019. Unfortunately \u2018When a Woman Cries\u2019 is a mediocre song and rather bad way to end an otherwise pretty perfect album. \n\nLast song I must mention is \u2018Naked In The Rain\u2019 which balances between rock and doom metal. All in all not one of the best songs one the album but once again a very, very strong chorus with which it earns its place on the album.\n\nProductional values are great, solid and really breath that \u2018late-eighties\u2019 atmosphere with heavy drums, wide reverb laden guitars and dense yet supporting keys. The artwork is more than superb and maybe even my favorite Dio album cover.\n\nWorst moment: \u2018When a Woman Cries\u2019\nBest moments: The rest of the songs, the overall performance by ALL members, production & artwork.\n",
        "\nThe band's frontman Ronnie James Dio was not precisely a newcomer in heavy metal music, as he was part of two of the most recognized bands thereof: Rainbow and Black Sabbath. Fanatics of such acts and the metal scene in general never overlooked his work, given the influences and the guiding principles he left for whatever relating to epic songwriting (a.k.a. dungeons and dragons), not to mention how memorable and powerful is his voice.\n\nDespite his unfortunate departure from Black Sabbath, the voice of metal formed his band, and for his benefit, he was able to recruit skilled musicians, including his former bandmates Jimmy Bain and Vinny Appice, as well as the Irish guitarist Vivian Campbell (Sweet Savage). Such a line-up guaranteed an auspicious beginning for Dio, and even better, it helped him move the musical direction in the way he wanted: walking towards the dungeons and dragons thematic. The result of all these elements altogether ended up in what is probably one of the most astonishing heavy metal albums ever brought in the metal scene.\n\nThe music displayed therein immediately causes an impact on the listener with the powerful, intense and speedish opener \"Stand Up and Shout\", which is a kind of cross-over between Sweet Savage's numbers \"The Eye of the Storm\" and \"Queen's Vengeance\" (the intro riff seems to take much after that of this number). You may imagine how explosive the number resulted; nonetheless, the band kept on climbing and somehow found out their creative peak in the \"Heaven and Hell\" reminiscent title track. The constant explosion of power-chords throughout the number, the dark stormy atmosphere, and the powerful Dio vocals make this song the most epic in the band's catalog.\n\nThe rest of the album does not move away from that direction. On the one hand, you have numbers which kept the line of heaviness drawn by the title song, such as \"Straight Through the Heart\", which although moving in a mid-pace, do not lose the punch that characterizes the whole damn thing while guaranteeing a dose of ass-kicking heavy metal. \"Don't Talk to Strangers\", on the other hand, keeps the epic spirit of the album with its proggy architecture, which moves from a sweet and soft intro to a heavier tune seasoned by the very aggressive soloing and riff set provided by Campbell.\n\nAlthough the album is filled with Dio's trademark metaphoric songwriting style, where things become interesting is in their most famous number, the melodic nostalgic \"Rainbow in the Dark\", which through metaphors displays the feelings Dio experienced when he left Black Sabbath (just to come back again to take this role 10 years later). It also represents an opportunity of reaching the masses, as it was able to balance the commercialism and heaviness without losing the latter, something that is not common, since generally, including commercialism in the formula results in a rather poor songwriting work.\n\nIts consistency and effective songwriting work have allowed the album reach high scales of respectability and good sales, ending up in an RIAA platinum certificate on account of its sales. Undisputedly, the album has enough merits to be considered the best album ever released in the metal scene, and few releases can reach the quality of Dio's debut. If you claim yourself a metalhead, this album should be part of your collection. If you haven't bought it, what are you waiting?\n",
        "\nOn May 16, 2010, Ronnie James Dio lost his battle with stomach cancer, ending his 5 decade career in music. The world lost a metal god that day, but Dio left us one last song off of his next-album-to-be. It seems that the album won\u2019t be finished now, unless Dio is the Tupac of metal, which would be fine with me. However, contained on this release is probably the last studio track we will get from Dio. Because of this I\u2019ll have to try to balance both reviewing this as a Greatest Hits, albeit a part two, and still give m thoughts on the new material.\n\nThis is a companion piece to \u201cThe Very Beast of Dio.\u201d That is actually the album that got me into Dio almost 10 years ago. That was a solid best of in terms of representing Dio\u2019s early career, but unfortunately lacked in terms of later accomplishments. \u201cLock Up the Wolves\u201d and \u201cStrange Highways\u201d only got one song from each, and despite having \u201cMagica\u201d and \u201cAngry Machines\u201d available at the time, both were ignored. And while this collection picks up at \u201cMagica\u201d and \u201cAngry Machines,\u201d the dismal representation of \u201cLock Up The Wolves\u201d and \u201cStrange Highways\u201d remains. This track list simply needs more Jesus, Mary and The Holy Ghost and Hey Angel. It also is a shame that between both releases, All The Fools Sailed Away is left off. Angry Machines also gets the short end of the stick, with only \u201cBlack\u201d and the obvious \u201cThis Is Your Life,\u201d although some may argue that this is for the best. This isn\u2019t a bad track list, but it feels lacking, and that quality songs that we\u2019re left off the first were ignored for some of the more \u201cjust ok\u201d songs from Dio\u2019s later releases. One thing I can\u2019t complain about however, is that I'm completely in love with \u201cAs long As it's Not About Love\u201d and \u201cThis is Your Life.\u201d\n\nOne thing I remember, is when this was announced and a lot of complaints were made about the art. People said it was tacky and cheesy. Welcome to metal, is it your first day? I think it reminds me the 70's unofficial Judas Priest covers vibe, like Hero, Hero, or the Rocka Rolla with the winged monster on the cover. There\u2019s sort of a cool kind of old school metal feel to it.\n\nAnyway, Let\u2019s discus the new song and bonus material. The next planned project for Dio was the follow up to Magica. Thats a good indication of what to expect from the song \u201cElectra.\u201d Don\u2019t expect a return of the classic Dio, because this song is not another \u201cRainbow in the Dark.\u201d It's on the darker side of Dio's musical spectrum, though not exactly the darkest he's ever recorded. The riff somewhat plods along during the verses, with Dio carrying the song vocally. His voice isn\u2019t as mighty as it used to be, but he still had some power behind it. It\u2019s very good for a 67 year old man. There are some rather upbeat synthesizer and guitar riffs in there despite the overall darker guitar tone and the more chugging riffs. It goes on for about 6 minutes and yet never feels over long. It really plays a lot like man y modern Dio tracks really. Old fans shouldn\u2019t feel cheated, but this won\u2019t convert anyone who didn\u2019t like Dio. If you enjoyed Magica and some of Dio\u2019s less upbeat work, say Dream Evil or Lock up the Wolves, this might be the song for you. In fact any Dio fan should probably give this a listen. It\u2019s not his best work, just a solid chugging Dio song.\n\nThe other two bonus cuts are \u201cThe Prisoner of Paradise,\u201d which I believe was a bonus track on some versions of \u201cMaster of the Moon\u201d and \u201cMetal Will Never Die,\u201d A David Feinstein song featuring Dio on vocals. \u201cPrisoner\u201d sounds like a weaker song from \u201cMaster of the Moon,\u201d not really bad, but not the best. Although not very well mixed, so it seems. \u201cMetal Will Never Die,\u201d while a cool thing to add on in spirit, is nothing to write home about. Its great Electra now has an official wide release, and when it was announced t here would be two other bonus tracks, I was kind of sure the other two bonuses would be \u201cHide in the Rainbow\u201d and \u201cGod Hates Heavy Metal.\u201d I thought maybe \u201cPrisoner of Paradise\u201d instead of \u201cGod Hates,\u201d but despite it being a popular guess, I think I was the only one who didn't expect \u201cMetal Will Never Die,\u201d since it wasn't technically a Dio song. It\u2019s kind of a shame that we got this instead of a Dio rarities collection. That would not only give the old fans something worth investing in, but free up space on this for a better \u201cbest of\u201d selection. The \u201cBest Of/New Material\u201d combo never works out as well. Still, it\u2019s not bad, and while I have my criticisms, it\u2019s solid enough to please most fans, and maybe interest those who never got into newer Dio to give some of his stuff a shot. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d want it to be anyone\u2019s first experience with Dio though.\n",
        "\nAfter the much heralded \"reunion\" of Ronnie James Dio (RJD) with Black Sabbath lasted only one album, RJD once again reformed his band Dio and released the angriest, hardest metal album of his career. This was soon after the Dio-lead Black Sabbath had released one of their heaviest albums, \"Dehumanizer\". In many ways \"Strange Highways\" is an attempt to one-up that Sabbath album and it's good but not \"Dehumanizer ll\" . \"Strange Highways\" is the forgotten Dio album released when metal was about to be knocked into a coma. This last album under his Reprise contract came and went in a hurry but, just as Mr Dio had predicted in an interview from 1994, this album has slowly been rediscovered and seems to be appreciated more than his best known work.\n\nThese were \"angry\" times. In interviews Dio indicated he was truly angry and that this was the prevailing mood of the day so it was a conscious effort to move away from the Dungeons & Dragons fantasy lyrics of yore into something more \"progressive\". He would take that further with the rare misfire \"Angry Machines\" two years later.\n\nFor the third album in a row the Dio band features a different guitarist. Craig Goldy took over Vivian Campbell on \"Dream Evil\", the amazing Rowan Robertson shredded mightily on \"Lock Up The Wolves\" and now Tracy G brings the doom sound to the mix. Though fan opinions are mixed on Tracy he is certainly closer in tone to Black Sabbath's Tony Iommi than any other guitarist RJD worked with. His lead work is darker, eccentric, with unpredictable harmonics, whammy bar effects and lots of blues-inspired soloing. \n\nThese are not the typically melodic melodies of the previous five LPs. There in lies the problem for me. The arrangements feature too many stops/starts and unpredictable bridges that just feel forced. Mostly down-tune, midpaced, atmospheric sounds, which resembles Sabbath more than \"Holy Diver\". Dio sings these songs harder/harsher with plenty of scorn in his voice. Right from the crushing opener, \"Jesus, Mary & The Holy Ghost\" it's obvious RJD is consciously going for heavy x3. \n\nIn the past RJD was \"off to see the witch\" but now, on the title cut of \"Strange Highways\", he's leaving this \"crazy world\" we live in \"for another institution\" and he's going to \"ride the wind on strange highways\". The theme of questioning current institutions recurs throughout the LP. The movie industry gets blasted in \"Hollywood Black\" for example. One of the more interesting cuts is \"Give Her The Gun\". Here Dio rages against child and/or human abuse by demanding the victims be armed to fight back!\n\nDio had the right idea releasing this type of record at the time but it didn't have much impact, only managing #142 on the Billboard albums chart. Like many veteran metal artists he was caught between being the \"old\" and the \"new\" of which Ronnie really didn't fit. His next album as Dio, \"Angry Machines\", made that crystal clear. Unsurprisingly, he experienced a resurgence when he return to his roots for 1999's \"Magica\".\n",
        "\n**Note: This is a review of the 2012 Deluxe Edition**\n\nAfter a huge success with \u201cHoly Diver\u201d, Ronnie James Dio and his newly formed solo band had to find a way to match that success and that came into the form of \u201cThe Last in Line\u201d. While a strong album in its own right, this album is just a step below the legendary debut. \u201cThe Last in Line\u201d, along with the aforementioned \u201cHoly Diver\u201d, and \u201cSacred Heart\u201d have recently been released as deluxe editions with improvements in sound and loaded with extra content. \u201cThe Last in Line\u201d comes with some live b-sides as well as a concert from the Pinkpop Festival in 1984.\n\n\u201cThe Last in Line\u201d mainly draws upon the formula from the debut. \u201cWe Rock\u201d could be seen as a brother to \u201cStand Up and Shout\u201d with its empowering lyrics and up-tempo joys. \u201cEat Your Heart Out\u201d is the child of \u201cStraight to the Heart\u201d and \u201cEgypt (The Chains Are On)\u201d invokes a familiar atmosphere and ends the album on a brooding note like \u201cShame to the Night\u201d did. Last, but certainly not the least, there is the epic title track slotted as song two.\n\nThe main problem with these comparisons is that the \u201cHoly Diver\u201d tracks are superior. That\u2019s not to diminish the merits of these songs because \u201cWe Rock\u201d is a sterling opener is a top Dio track and I actually find the song \u201cThe Last in Line\u201d better than \u201cHoly Diver.\u201d The lyrics in the chorus are some of the greatest examples of Dio\u2019s writing ability and his use of metaphors is truly impressive.\n\n\u201cMystery\u201d is the most commercial song and one of the singles off this album. The song remains one of my favorite DIO songs because of the enchanting keyboards provided by Claude Schnell and has one of Dio\u2019s best lyrics with \u201cIs the wise man always right? No, he can play the fool.\u201d The accompanying music video is also worth a look too. Dio gets to fight with a sword again and he makes awesome gestures with his hands.\n\nRounding out the territory is \u201cI Speed at Night\u201d complete with attitude and some resounding guitar work from Vivian Campbell. Thanks to the improvements in the sound, the jumping notes of Jimmy Bain can be clearly heard as well. \u201cBreathless\u201d stays on the mid-tempo, but floats in the generic realm and \u201cOne Night in the City\u201d has a cool riff to keep attention while Dio tells a story about a couple young kids.\n\nThe extras piled onto this deluxe edition are live b-sides of \u201cEat Your Heart Out\u201d, \u201cDon\u2019t Talk to Strangers\u201d, \u201cHoly Diver\u201d, and \u201cRainbow in the Dark.\u201d All are solid listens that don\u2019t deviate much from the studio versions and it is nice to have a live version of a song that is not talked too much about in \u201cEat Your Heart Out.\u201d\n\nHowever, the meat of the extra content is the concert from the Pinkpop Festival. It is an excellent set list, but unfortunately this concert seems to be a bootleg and there is this buzzing, static noise that permeates the sound. It is a big distraction, but if the ambitious listener can look past that then there is a load to latch on to. Dio\u2019s stage banter is in full effect and not cut out and there is a rousing version of \u201cHeaven and Hell\u201d that is over 13 minutes long. The band is in tight form and it is easy to surmise that they are enjoying themselves. A live version \u201cOne Night in the City\u201d is on here and that song is not heard much on the live stage and it\u2019s never a bad thing hearing \u201cMan on the Silver Mountain.\u201d\n\nAs with all the other deluxe editions, there are extensive linear notes on the development of the album as well as some neat photos of artwork and the band. The sound upgrade along with the bonuses should provide enough nourishment for a DIO fanatic, and while the sound of the extra concert is disappointing, this is still an entertaining deluxe edition. I suggest you don\u2019t be the last in line for a purchase.\n\nnicksmetal.blogspot.com\n",
        "\n**Note: This is a review of the 2012 Deluxe Edition**\n\nRonnie James Dio has a way of making a first impression. He dazzled listeners when he joined up with Richie Blackmore in Rainbow and then rejuvenated Black Sabbath\u2019s career with \u201cHeaven and Hell.\u201d The man had a lot to live up to when going solo and he did not disappoint with \u201cHoly Diver.\u201d The album is widely regarded as a classic and must have for any metal head and for good reason. This album, along with \u201cThe Last in Line\u201d and \u201cSacred Heart\u201d has recently undergone the deluxe treatment from the Universal Music Group and is loaded with some nice extras. Along with the original album, \u201cHoly Diver\u201d includes some live b-sides and also a live concert from the King Biscuit Flower Hour.\n\nThe main upgrade from the original release and as well as the 2005 re-release is the improvement in the sound department. Listening to this deluxe version almost felt as if hearing the album for the first time again. The instruments have a strong clarity and Dio\u2019s voice shines like a bright ray of sun. Vivian Campbell\u2019s riffs have an extra burst and the bass provided by Jimmy Bain have the edges rounded on and is clearly established within in the songs. The classic, iconic songs like the title track and \u201cRainbow in the Dark\u201d sound just as fresh as they did in 1983.\n\nAs for the other songs, there is not much more to say then what has already been said. Dio has a way of making the listener feeling empowered with his lyrics. No song embodies that more than the opener, \u201cStand Up and Shout.\u201d Filled with a rich, up-tempo riff, this song is the essence of making even the most pessimistic fellow to rejoice and raise your fist in the air.\n\nThe deeper cuts are also done very well as \u201cStraight Through the Heart\u201d shows Dio at his most demanding with a mean riff that slices to the bone. The final track, \u201cShame on the Night\u201d has some doom qualities and ends the album on a much darker note.\nThere is only one tune that does not live up to the billing at that one is \u201cGypsy.\u201d It is the least inspired and has by far the weakest vocal line and guitar playing. After the one-two punch of \u201cStand Up and Shout\u201d and \u201cHoly Diver\u201d, \u201cGypsy\u201d drops the bar down.\n\nThe second disc of the deluxe edition is where things become interesting. There is an alternative version of \u201cEvil Eyes\u201d, which would appear on the next album, as well as some live b-sides. However, the extras to sink your teeth into are the concert from the King Biscuit Flower Hour.\n\nThis concert is the Dio band in its truest form. They are young, hungry, with Dio trying to establish himself as a solo artist. \u201cShame on the Night\u201d sounds just as devilish as the studio version and serves as a calming effect after an energetic opener with \u201cStand Up and Shout.\u201d As the band was still in its fledlging stages, Dio dived into his past ventures with \u201cChildren of the Sea\u201d and \u201cMan on the Silver Mountain.\u201d The latter stands out because the band breaks into \u201cStarstruck\u201d in the middle and features impressive drumming by Vinny Appice. \u201cChildren of the Sea\u201d is my favorite Dio-fronted Black Sabbath track and Campbell does a stellar job capturing the somber spirit with his guitar work.\n\nBesides the concert are the song \u201cEvil Eyes\u201d and two live b-sides in \u201cStand Up and Shout and \u201cStraight Through the Heart.\u201d With \u201cEvil Eyes\u201d, there is not much difference in the version that would appear on \u201cThe Last in Line.\u201d There is a little more run time with the riffing on this take, but overall there is not much being missed. The live tracks are steady versions with \u201cStraight Through the Heart\u201d retaining its nastiness and \u201cStand Up and Shout\u201d is similar to what is heard from the concert provided here. This is luckily such a great song that it is not an annoyance hearing this song twice on the same disc.\n\nThis is the definitive version of an iconic album and is certainly deserving of having a deluxe edition. The advancement in the sound and the live concert are enough reasons to warrant a purchase. \u201cHoly Diver\u201d is a classic for a reason and this edition is the perfect opportunity to re-experience this great album.\n\nnicksmetal.blogspot.com\n",
        "\nElf...Rainbow....Black Sabbath....now Dio. \"Holy Diver\" proved Ronnie James Dio could now succeed without the Rainbow or Black Sabbath banner. In fact, it was the best album of his career. With his own band, Dio basically combined the epic, medieval imagery of Rainbow with the heavy doom of Sabbath to forge his \"own\" sound. Could he follow it up with something on par with the standard he set for himself? A bad second album is often the death knoll for a \"new\" band.\n\nWell, the answer is a resounding \"yes\". There was no \"sophomore slump\" for Dio on his second outing under his own name. Dio fans seem to rate \"Holy Diver\" over \"The Last In Line\" as the best Dio album but I consider them nearly equal when it comes to the LPs as a whole. The only real difference is \"Last\" has a few B+ grade tracks (\"Breathless\", \"Eat Your Heart Out\") while \"Diver\" was straight A's.\n\n\"The Last In Line\" is in many ways a clone of \"Holy Diver\". The line up is the same (Dio, Campbell, Bain, Appice), only with the addition of keyboardist Claude Schnell, who brings a different, if somewhat dated, synth to several tracks. It was Dio's first step towards the pop metal (not to be confused with 'hair metal') of it's followup \"Sacred Heart\". Just like \"Holy Diver's\" leading number \"Stand Up And Shout\", the first cut on \"Line\" is \"We Rock\", another fast fist-pumping headbanger. It even eclipses \"Shout\" in sheer force. That's no easy task. It's one of those universal anthems Dio writes to connect with the audience. In concert he used this to it's max. The \"we\" is everybody. WE all rock. It's our lifestyle. It's our identity. (One could contrast that to Queen's \"We Will Rock You\", which is more about the band Queen rocking you. Campbell has some of the fastest fingers in the business as evidenced by the ferocious, breakneck guitar hook, let alone his requisite solo. This cut became a staple of Dio's live gigs for the rest of his life).\n\nThe title track is definitely one of his absolute best tracks. It opens with a slow melodic intro but the hammer comes slamming down.. Dio roars in full chest voice followed by the lumbering bass & guitar riffs. The greatness of Dio's voice was his Freddie Mercury-like ability to hit his high register in full chest voice instead of going nasal, shrieking or slipping into falsetto.\n\nOne of many standouts is \"One Night In The City\", a midtempo number that briefly tells the tale of a \"dark child\" named Johnny and a \"princess\" named Sally. The lyrics are typically cryptic but it seems to \"recommend\" living for the moment or perhaps getting lost in the moment. This was 1984. It didn't sound so daft back then. It's the midpaced, doomy numbers like this or \"Shame On The Night\" from the preceding LP that really brought out the \"horns\" in Dio.\n\nJust like \"Holy Diver\" the imagery is pure Final Fantasy or D&D fiction. Still, \"Line\" doesn't feel quite as cohesive as \"Diver\" thanks to a decent but out-of-place \"breakup song\" (\"Eat Your Heart Out\") and the lyrics of the aforementioned \"One Night In The City\". Even the radio-friendly \"Rainbow In The Dark\"-clone \"Mystery\" doesn't fit seamlessly like \"Dark\" did on \"Holy Diver\".\n\nNow, in retrospect, some would say this is a positive as songs about rainbows, dragons, witches, demons and what have you made Dio a self-parody in time in the minds of some. Dio was hip to the joke as his retro-2002 album \"Killing The Dragon\" was a conscious throwback. His lyrics and use of medieval imagery to talk about the struggle of life issues was still fresh at the time. Over the years he's been asked several times why he continued to write in that style. To paraphrase, Ronnie usually said \"I like to give people some fantasy instead of just writing songs about love stinks or the world is going to sh**\".\n\nWhile Dio was often a fine lyricist the more important thing about this and the preceding LP is the musicianship. Hungry, aggressive playing by a group like themselves and each other (for awhile). Tight, clean production but hard, heavy with the two elements that separates one band from another. Not to lesson the important of a bassist and drummer to the band but, in metal, there's two things that stand out most and make it or break it with the average non-musician record buyer: A great vocalist (Ronnie James Dio) and a hot metal guitarist (Vivian Campbell). The Dio band had two of the highest caliber. Nevertheless, in order for the album itself to rise to the level of greatness, it has to have the songs.\n\nIt's been 28 years since this album was released and it has aged extremely well. Just this week I purchased a 24-Karat Gold remaster while earlier in the year European markets were treated with a Deluxe Edition of \"The Last In Line\", which included a bonus disc containing live B-Sides to the singles \"Mystery\" & \"We Rock\" plus a set of Live At The Pink Pop Festival recorded in 1984.\n",
        "\nRhino Records' \"The Very Beast Of Dio\" was the much needed first \"best of\" set in North America. It was rewarded with strong sales and became Dio's last God Certified Record (500,000 +) to date. It was a solid, but not perfect (the anemic live version \"Man On The Silver Mountain\" from the mini-album \"Intermission\" was chosen instead of the lone studio cut \"Time To Burn\" from that project), 16-song summation of Dio's major label years 1983-1992. While a proper 2 disc set of his Reprise albums from \"Holy Diver\" through \"Strange Highways\" is definitely called for Rhino instead released \"Stand Up And Shout: Dio Anthology\" in 2003, a decent but, again, flawed endeavor that tried to pack Ronnie James Dio's career from Elf, through Rainbow, through Black Sabbath with the band Dio onto 2 discs. Just not possible but a good try. The set sold poorly compared to \"The Very Beast Of\".\n\nIt seems unlikely Rhino will be issuing anymore Dio compilations so Ronnie & Wendy Dio's Niji Entertainment recently made a smart business decision to do it's own compilation of the Dio albums from 1996's \"Angry Machines\" through 2004's \"Master Of The Moon\" and called it \"The Very Beast Of, Vol. 2\". \n\nThe four studio albums and 1 live album released during this period received less distribution than the Reprise years so they are not and were not as easy to find as the major label period. In terms of quality I feel they hold up quite well to \"Beast 1\". Dio never made a truly bad album. Even the critically-lambasted \"Angry Machines\" needs to be revisited now that the dust has settled. Only two choice cuts are found here from \"Machines\" (\"Black\" & \"This Is Your Life\"), while a third, \"Hunter Of The Heart\", is the live version from \"Inferno: The Last In Live\". These are the best songs from the album but there's still great tracks to be found on that LP. \n\nThe next three Dio studio LPs get represented thusly: \"Magica\" (4 tracks: \"Fever Dreams\", \"Feed My Head\", \"Lord Of The Last Day\", \"As Long As It's Not About Love\"), \"Killing The Dragon\" (4 tracks: title cut, \"Along Comes A Spider\", \"Better In The Dark\", \"Push\") and \"Master Of The Moon\" (3 tracks: \"The Eyes\", \"One More For The Road\", \"Shivers\") and these were for the most part the best choices (the title cut to \"Master Of The Moon\" is a gem that I would've chosen over the generic \"One More For The Road\"). While more cuts from these four LPs could have been included Niji decided to fill out the compilation with some hard-to-find tracks. This is where they sort of dropped the ball. \n\nWhile \"Prisoner Of Paradise\" (Japan-only bonus cut from \"Moon\"), \"Metal Will Never Die\" (Dio's song found on a David Feinstein's solo album \"Bitten By The Beast\") and the single \"Electra\" (from the \"Tournado\" box set and allegedly from the planned \"Magica ll\" that never happened) are all great additions they left off the ferocious \"God Hates Heavy Metal\" (Japan-only bonus track to \"Angry Machines\") and \"The Code\" (Dio's vocal on The Rods' CD \"Vengeance\"), which would have really sold this set. As it is it feels incomplete. Three out of the five recent (or 6 if you could the \"Annica\" instrumental from Japan-only \"Magica\") tracks not found on proper Dio albums, which makes this a bit messy. Personally I already had 15 of the 17 songs on here so I'm grading this set as a whole for what *IS* included. It is a \"thumbs up\" and essential purchase for a casual fan and Dio collector. Notice I left one group out: The longtime fans who bought all the albums.\n\nFrom a marketing standpoint there's three types of potential consumers: 1) The casual fan who just wants the \"greatest hits\" so the bonus tracks are just more of them 2) The longtime Dio fan who bought every album but is not a \"serious\" collector (\"completist\") 3) The Dio completist who purchases every Dio release or alternate packaging because that's what \"serious\" collectors do. \n\nFan types 1 & 3 will welcome this set with no sweat but fan-type 2 might feel conflicted and and see this as a frustrating, difficult purchase. But let me ask you: Again, if you came across a bootleg cd containing three Dio tracks you don't have.... would you buy it? How much you think you would pay for it? Look, three Dio songs are worth the $10 list price (and by the way you can purchase those three songs by themselves as mp3's)\n\nI'm a fan \"type 2\" and I only needed two of the tracks. Glad to have \"Electra\" & \"Metal Will Never Die\". Still. I have to deduct 5% off the rating for two reasons: 1. A full rarities set would've been a better home for the three \"bonus tracks\" along with the others that didn't make the cut 2. The \"Magica\" tracks are taken from a concept album and feel a bit awkward lumped in with the others.\n",
        "\nI've read quite a few reviews slagging this one off as \"mediocre\" or worse but this is actually a step up from the lauded \"Killing The Dragon\" from 2002. \"Moon\" excels in terms of songwriting, vocals and the overall production. It's also an album with more variety than the deliberate throwback that was \"Killing The Dragon\". There's a satisfying mixture of Sabbath-like doom metal, some clever, melodic songs like the Dio of yore, and a little experimentation. \n\nOne thing is certain: Ronnie James Dio knew how to produce a big sound in the studio. The bass is fat, the guitars crisp, drums heavy and of course the vocals soaring. While the album's opener, \"One For The Road\", is a by the numbers uptempo track that's not in the league of other Dio kick offs like \"Stand Up And Shout\", \"We Rock\", \"King Of Rock & Roll\" or \"Killing The Dragon\", the disc strikes gold by track 2, \"Master Of The Moon\". A slow, heavy-bottomed doom track with a memorable refrain. Lyrically, it's full of Dio-isms about dreams, the night, shadows, darkness, in what appears to be a song about fighting conformity. Dio has said that, although he was never a lonely person himself, he preferred writing songs for the lonely; the outcasts. Despite the familiar lyrics the melody wins the day. Metal songs with an actual hook have become scarce.\n\n\"The End Of The World\" is another midtempo number with a guitar riff that sounds like it was nicked from an AC/DC record. A catchy, commercial guitar like that's refreshing to hear on a Dio album instead of the usual galloping speed metal guitar lines. Despite being melodically thin this one's sold by the voice. \"Shivers\", which follows, is the next standout. A humorous, yet sinister piece where Dio sings that spiders, rats, bats, graveyards, voodoo, black cats don't scare him but the antagonist, probably a cold-hearted woman, makes him \"shiver\". This proves Dio was hip to his tendency of self-parody and had a sense of humor. His tongue is firmly in his cheek here. The music is heavy and dark but that just punctuates the punchline. His voice again shows no signs of wear.\n\n\"Master Of The Moon\" was released in 2004 when both George W. Bush and the Iraq & Afghanistan wars were especially unpopular. \"The Man Who Would Be King\" is a thinly-veiled jab at Bush's America. Dio sings: \"We laugh at your religion/You people of the sand...forgive me father for the change we bring/All for the man who would be king\" then later \"Don't leave a body standing/Not the holy not the small/Deliver us from evil/If it's yours we want it all\". An unusually transparent song from Dio. Next up is the fan favorite, \"The Eyes\", a spooky, paranoid track with a robotic vocal effect croaking \"The Eye-yi-yissssss\" throughout. \n\nAnother nondescript uptempo rocker, \"Living The Lie\", fills up some space until the anthem \"I Am\" comes roaring with it's mighty refrain. Dio is such a masterful and charismatic singer he can take the simplest of phrases and ring every bit of power and emotion from them (\"I\", from Black Sabbath's \"Dehumanizer\" being a good example). \"Death By Love\" is retro-Dio that could fit snugly on \"Dream Evil\" from 1987. The closing \"In Dreams\" is another midtempo number with a soaring Dio vocal (just love the chest voice again. That's a powerful voice. No cheating with falsetto, nasal projecting or screeching. Dio is a meat and potatoes singer belting from the soul).\n\nAgain, \"Master Of The Moon\" succeeds because of it's variety. In many ways you get the full range of Dio on one disc. Like \"Strange Highways\", this is one of two underrated LPs in his canon. Just as \"SH\" has finally grown in stature and praise I predict the same will happen with \"Moon\".\n",
        "\nEvery once in a while, I get addicted to a song, and almost can't bring myself to listen to anything else. (Revolution is My Name, Electric Eye Peace Sells for example.) Rainbow in the Dark is more than that. This song is more than any passing interest, it is an incredible rock masterpiece. I really can't sum it up better than that. \n\nRainbow in the Dark starts out with a huge, epic guitar chord that flies in the face of pop-hook convention. Then it bursts into an intricate riff, and a keyboard line that you will be humming later on, guaranteed. Dio's vocals kick in soon enough, and his voice, as many loyal metal fans know, is enough to induce eargasms within a square mile. The lyrics have been considered cheesy by many more \"brutal\" metalheads, but they have a rather charming camp that I really can't help but enjoy. The chorus is great, and may likely have you singing along by the end. The solo blazes like all Hell, one of the best ever penned. \n\nGypsy isn't as good, but it has the unfortunate curse of being after the song Holy Diver (on the album of the same name) and Rainbow in the Dark (in the single version of that song). It really is underrated, and never had a chance to shine being outweighed by those two superior songs The lyrics are a little repetitive, but the riff is great, and of course Dio's voice could carry any song. Ultimately, not to be overseen.\n\nSo that's my review of Rainbow in the Dark, I can't recommend that song enough. However, I advise you to buy the entire Holy Diver album, because it really is an incredible masterwork. Don't miss out on all the other underrated gems.\n",
        "\nFirst off let it be known that this compilation only takes you as far as 1994 of Ronnie James Dio's storied career. It was released in 2003 so nothing from Dio's last LP (\"Master Of The Moon\") or the Black Sabbath reunion aka \"Heaven & hell\" could even be considered. This is Elf until the end of Ronnie's Warner Bros. contract in 1994 (the LP \"Strange Highways).\n\nIt's no surprise Rhino wanted another Dio compilation since 2000's mighty fine 16-track \"The Very Beast Of Dio\" collection sold over 500,000 copies in the U.S. (Gold certification in the U.S.). It was culled strictly from the band \"Dio\" and was the first North American \"best of\" (the import \"Diamonds: The Best Of\" had been available since 1994). Instead of doing \"The Very Beast Of, Vol. 2\", which they certainly could considering many many Dio tracks didn't fit on the first collection, they opted to compile Ronnie James Dio's career from his band Elf, through Rainbow, through Black Sabbath, through the Dio band. They decided to attempt this within the space of two compact discs (160 minutes max and Rhino admirably filled approximately 153 minutes worth).\n\nSo how did they do? Rhino usually nails it on their choices and they did pretty darn good on \"Stand Up And Shout: The Anthology\". It's obvious some knowledgeable people were involved with the selection. Of the 29 cuts here 3 come from the band Elf, three from Rainbow, eight from Black Sabbath and fifteen from the Dio band(s).\n\nDISC 1\nEven though the music of Elf, a bluesy, rock'n boogie band, isn't what Dio became famous for the Rhino team, for the sake of being thorough, picked three songs from two of the three Elf albums (\"Hoochie Koochie Lady\" & \"I'm Coming Back To You\" from \"ELF\" and \"Carolina Country Ball\" from the album of the same name, re-titled \"L.A. 59\" in the USA. Nothing from the final Elf LP, \"Trying To Burn The Sun\" is included). Personally, I would have rather Elf been excluded altogether and the collection begin with Rainbow, but that's just my take on it. The three Elf songs are cute but nothing special.\n\nNext up are the Rainbow years. Here is where Rhino makes it's first mistake. Not including live albums, Rainbow made three albums- one of which, \"Rainbow Rising\", is considered a Metal masterpiece. Rhino did pick one from each LP- three essential cuts, 'The Man On The Silver Mountain\", \"Starstruck\" & \"Long Live Rock & Roll\", but \"Sixteenth Century Greensleeves\" & \"Stargazer\" should have been included, perhaps in place of the Elf tracks. Or they could have cut one of the Black Sabbath tracks. Again, though, there's only so much space and Metal tracks are usually long so....it is what it is.\n\nThe Black Sabbath pics are nearly perfect. Three from \"Heaven & Hell\" (title cut, \"Neon Knights\", \"Children Of The Sea\"), three from \"The Mob Rules\" (title cut, \"Sign Of The Southern Cross\", \"Turn Up The Night\") and one from \"Dehumanizer\" (\"Computer God\"). In addition there's a rare live version (not from the the infamous \"Live Evil\" but from the 1982 \"Mob Rules\" tour) of \"H&H's\" \"Voodoo\" included. Nice as that may be they could have included another \"Dehumanizer\" track (such as \"I\") or one of the missing Rainbow songs instead. Afterall, this collection is not a \"rarities\" collection so baiting the hook with one or two is a bit obnoxious.\n\nDisc 1 closes with another rarity, a ripping version of \"Sacred Heart\" from the VHS-only (so-far) \"Sacred Heart-The Video\" release (rather than the mediocre 'Intermission\" EP- a stopgap 6-cut release foisted on the public between Dio's proper albums in 1986). A better rarity and better bait would have been the studio cut \"Hide In The Rainbow\", which was only released on \"The Dio EP\" during the \"Sacred Heart\" tour. The track has since been released on the bonus disc from the Deluxe Edition re-issue of \"Sacred Heart\"\n\nDISC 2\nRather than just copy the tracklist from \"The Very Beast Of Dio\" Rhino swaps a few tracks for a few not included on \"Beast\". \n\nFirstly, from the stone classic LP \"Holy Diver\" we are served up a healthy five tracks (title cut, \"Rainbow In The Dark\", \"Stand Up And Shout\", \"Straight Through The Heart\" & \"Don't Talk To Strangers\"), all but one (\"Don't Talk To Strangers\") of which were included on \"Beast\". From \"The Last In Line\" comes three cuts (title song, \"We Rock\" & \"Egypt (The Chains Are On)\"). The UK hit \"Mystery\" is dropped in place of \"Egypt\". Though a better song I think \"Mystery\" should've remained being it was so popular. Being that a live version of \"Sacred Heart\" was included on disc 1 two more obvious songs from the LP \"Sacred Heart\" are here (\"King Of Rock & Roll\", \"Hungry For Heaven\"). This is the second gaffe. The missing \"Rock And Roll Children\" (included on \"Beast\") was Dio's biggest hit single (#26 in the UK). \n\nAnother mistake comes with the \"Dream Evil\" LP selection. While the great title cut and \"All The Fools Sail Away\" are included the hit \"I Could Have Been A Dreamer\" is not. At this point it seems clear that Rhino wanted this new compilation to be somewhat supplementary to \"The Very Beast Of\". My theory is a bit stymied though by the fact the final two songs from Dio's final two Reprise LPs, \"Lock Up The Wolves\" & \"Strange Highways\") are the same as on \"Beast\", ie, the title track of each album. There were plenty of worthy tracks they could have swapped these for and been forgiven (\"Wild One\", \"Hey Angel\", \"Jesus, Mary & The Holy Ghost\", etc..).\n\nNow that they've released \"Black Sabbath: The Dio Years\" Rhino should do a 2 disc set on JUST the Dio band years. \"Stand Up And Shout\" was doomed from the start. Too much material for two discs. A good effort but ultimately flawed.\n",
        "\nThis 2 disc compilation is the first collection that covers nearly his entire career from his time with Elf, through Rainbow, through Black Sabbath, through Dio (band) to his last days with Heaven & Hell (Black Sabbath). Rhino's decent 2 Disc \"Stand Up And Shout: The Anthology\" stopped short at his final Warner Brothers LP (\"Strange Highways) but is a better overall (but still flawed) set since there's some glaring omissions on \"Mightier Than The Sword\" that were logically included on the Rhino set (\"The Last In Line\" being the most shocking). Only those not familiar with all the albums Dio was involved with will be pleased with this sampler. It does give a more comprehensive portrait of the man's career but it simply is not possible to fit all the essential tracks from Elf to H & H on two discs (not even three could cut it). It earns a point for including one track from his guest work on Roger Glover's \"The Butterfly Ball & The Grasshopper's Feast\" (\"Love Is All\") , which was ignored by the Rhino set but loses more points for omitting the most popular Rainbow track (\"The Man On The Silver Mountain\") and some essential Dio band tracks (\"Stand Up And Shout\", \"The Last In Line\", \"Hungry For Heaven\", \"Dream Evil\", \"Lock Up The Wolves\", etc.. Now, being that there was limited space only the absence of \"The Last In Line\" is completely unforgivable. They chose only \"We Rock\" from the \"The Last In Line\" album instead but since the disc clocks in at only 69+ minutes space was left for atleast one more track and \"The Last In Line\" is a no brainer!)\n\nElf was not a metal band but a boogie-woogie blues rock band so not much is needed despite three full albums being recorded by the group. It's not who Dio became and not what made him famous. Only \"Carolina Country Ball\" from the LP of the same name represents Elf of the 27 tracks offered here. After The Glover track that follows comes the Rainbow years- represented by a surprising 8 tracks. While the great \"Stargazer\", \"Catch The Rainbow\" & \"Run With The Wolf\" are here where is \"The Man On The Silver Mountain\" for crying out loud?!\n\nThe first two Black Sabbath stint is represented by six tracks (\"Heaven & Hell\", \"The Mob Rules\", \"Children Of The Sea\", \"Voodoo\", \"Die Young\" & \"Country Girl\"). This is acceptable even though \"Die Young\" & \"Country Girl\" could have been replaced with \"The Sign Of The Southern Cross\" & \"Turn Up The Night\" and made it slightly better. There's nothing from the infamous \"Live Evil\" set but \"Neon Nights\" appears later being the live version from Heaven & Hell's 2007 tour and subsequent album/DVD \"Live From The Radio City Music Hall\".\n\nNext up is the Dio band years. Not including the weak live EP \"Intermission\" Ronnie's namesake band released five albums before Ronnie rejoined Black Sabbath. Those five Dio albums are represented by a paltry five tracks. Two from \"Holy Diver\" (title track, \"Rainbow In The Dark\"). one from \"The Last In Line\" (\"We Rock\"), one from \"Sacred Heart\" (\"Rock And Roll Children\"), one from \"Dream Evil\" (\"All The Fools Sailed Away\") and nothing from \"Lock Up The Wolves\". Now while all five of these tracks belong here more tracks from these albums should have been chosen in place of too many Rainbow tracks (based on the premise something would have to be cut to make room).\n\nThe Black Sabbath reunion LP \"Dehumanizer\" is represented by \"I\" (not a bad choice even though \"Computer God\" is better) and then three more Dio band albums are completely ignored (yep, nothing at all from \"Strange Highways\", \"Angry Machines\" & \"Magica\") as the collection jumps to 2002's \"Push\" from the album \"Killing The Dragon\" followed by \"One More For The Road\" from the LP \"Master Of The Moon\". While these were the logical choices for the \"KTD\" & MOTM\" albums \"Magica\" deserved at least one track here (such as \"Fever Dreams\") instead of \"Shadow Of The Wind\", one of three tracks recorded by H&H for the \"Black Sabbath: The Dio Years\" compilation. Then comes the aforementioned live \"Neon Knights\", the penultimate track before we get to the fantastic final cut, \"Bible Black\". It was the best pick from an overall great album by Heaven & Hell, entitled \"The Devil You Know\" in 2009- one year prior to Ronnie James Dio's death.\n\nThe first lesson is that you shouldn't try to cram onto two discs a career that consisted of over 20 studio albums, many live albums and guest appearances. The second is that if you're gonna try find someone hip who will narrow it down to the bare essentials. Sometimes they got it right (\"Stargazer\", \"Heaven & Hell\", \"The Mob Rules\", \"Holy Diver\", \"Rock And Roll Children\", \"Push\" & \"Bible Black) and often they got it wrong (leaving off \"Man On The Silver Mountain\", having too many Rainbow tracks, the omission of \"The Last In Line\", \"Hungry For Heaven\" and nothing at all from four Dio albums: \"Lock Up The Wolves\", \"Strange Highways\", \"Angry Machines\" & \"Magica\").\n\nAll in all. Another incomplete \"best of\" comp that will have a short shelf life until someone does it right with a four disc box set.\n",
        "\nDio's first concept album. Being that this was released in 1999 that fact in itself is surprising enough since Dio has always been fascinated with epic tales of \"good vs evil\" and medieval, mythical times. Even though they may seem like it Dio's first three albums (\"Holy Diver\", \"The Last In Line\", \"Sacred Heart\") were not truly concept albums. They seem as such because of the similar \"dragons, witches, sages, demons, ancient times\" themes but, upon closer inspection they are really motivational and cautionary songs delivered with imaginary settings. Also, each of those albums had it's share of straight forward songs that didn't use ambiguous lyrics or cryptic messages.\n\nNow, \"Magica\", on the other hand is indeed a \"soundtrack\" to the \"Magica\" story, one which Dio recites on the final track. More on that later. Though there's some computerized vocal interludes sprinkled thoughout the flow of the album is not hampered by dialogue between the cuts (the full story is recited at the end). The lyrics do relate to the story without making them overly specific. \n\nFirst let me mention the cut \"Fever Dreams\". Craig Goldy has come up with one of the best guitar riffs ever (not hyperbole- it's awesome) heard for this cut (so good the mighty fine himself Doug Aldrich couldn't do it on the Killing The Dragon Tour a few years later!). This track smokes with a crisp Dio vocal and flawless rhythm beneath that Goldy riff. Masterpiece. I caught myself bobbin' my head and stomping my foot on this one. Here we are introduced to the hero of the story Eriel, who has his own song in his name. On \"Fever Dreams\" Eriel is being haunted in his dreams by the villain of the tale, Shadowcast. Honestly, I don't really care. The \"concept\" is just a cool bonus for when you want to concentrate on it. Another reviewer went into depth on the storyline contained in each song. Definitely worth reading. That said, I won't be doing that here.\n\nThe aforementioned song, Eriel, owes a debt to \"Holy Diver\" (which owes a debt to the bassline of \"Heaven & Hell\", only slightly slowed down). This piece definitely resembles soundtrack music to a theatrical event. There's a string arrangement and vocal section. Another standout is \"As Long As It's Not About Love\", which opens with acoustic guitar and builds with bluesy lyrics with two startling solos from Goldy. This track has become a favorite with longtime Dio fans. \n\nEven though the \"story\" is told within the songs the album closes with Uncle Dio reading you a story as if puffing a pipe by a fireplace. 18 minutes worth. THIS is how to do a concept album. No lengthy interludes between the cuts ruining the flow of the album. You have a choice you can just listen to a headbanging album and skip the last track or you can put on headphones and get lost in the story with one monster of a soundtrack. Essential addition to the Dio canon.\n",
        "\nAfter three (and a half) albums of \"medieval\" themes and metal anthems what does Dio do next? He stays true to his formula. Even his \"cuddly\" mascot \"Murray\" is back on the album cover (in the window). Despite the departure of guitarist Vivian Campbell, who left and later joined Whitesnake and Def Leppard, Dio creates an album that nearly matches the legendary \"Holy Diver\" & \"The Last In Line\". Campbell's replacement, Craig Goldy, filled the shoes with no problem.\n\nDio's fanbase had definitely shrunk by 1987 and with the release of \"Dream Evil\". Partly due to the mediocre live EP \"Intermission\" and MTV's all-embracing love for fluffy hair alleged \"hard rock\" bands like Bon Jovi & Poison. Still, the LP entered the U.S. Billboard Top 200 albums at a respectable #43 (his highest LP chart placement in the US was #23 with \"The Last In Line\") and was another Top Ten in the U.K. Unfortunately, the album exited the charts faster than the previous albums (but eventually received Gold record status years later).\n\nThough similar in it's more polished, slightly commercial leanings the album is a better overall work than \"Sacred Heart\". The reason? Better songs. No real duds. Dio had another creative spurt teamed with Goldy that produced melodic tunes like the title cut, \"I Could Have Been A Dreamer\" (his last track to chart in America- #33 Mainstream Rock), \"Sunset Superman\" and \"Night People\". It also contains the epic ballad \"All The Fools Sailed Away\", which certainly ranks in the Top 20 best Dio cuts. Many have noticed the guitar riff resembles the classic Rainbow track \"Man On The Silver Mountain\". Perhaps.\n\nDuring interviews for \"Dream Evil\" Dio admitted that \"Sacred Heart\" was an \"unhappy album to make\" because of friction with Campbell. He knew there was a couple tracks on \"Sacred Heart\" that he referred to as \"album helper\" songs, his euphemism for what we call \"filler\". He went on to say \"Dream Evil\" was a conscious attempt to \"return to form\". Irregardless of Ronnie's humility \"Sacred Heart\" was still one of the best albums released in that year. \"Dream Evil\" is just better. One can only wonder if had this been the follow up to \"The Last In Line\" would it have gone platinum and kept him on the A list a little longer? Whatever the case it was the beginning of his commercial decline with each subsequent Reprise LP selling less than the previous one. So less and less promotional effort was received from the label. It had nothing to do with quality though. MTV (temporarily) ruined metal.\n",
        "\nNobody was doing this kind of medieval-themed metal in the 2000s (that I'm aware of or care to know about) but RJD didn't care. He knows what his fans want and he delivers. Even though the \"Dragon\" is a metaphor it still sounds like he's \"off to see the witch\" again. That ominous keyboard intro is pure Dio. In \"Better In The Dark\" he sings \"Running with monsters in shadows/And monsters always knows it's better in the dark\". Then again on \"Along Comes A Spider\" he sings: \"Remember when you only needed no one/Everyday's tomorrow and it's alright/No confessions-not for you/Forget the things you've done/it's about what you do/The first time your superstitious/What's the gliding down/Along comes a spider.\" Dio's lyrics are usually open to interpretation and he uses sinister imagery as inference but he does speak of \"running with an evil woman\" and says \"But don't get caught next time/Along comes a spider/a spider/a spider inside her\". Succubus? So...\"Women- can't live with 'em can't....\"\n\nThe single, though a bit simplistic as regards the hook, was \"Push\", which earned it's own music video co-staring the obnoxious Tenacious D (sorry but Spinal Tap already cornered the market on metal parody and did so with wit rather than shock humor). It's nice that Jack Black showed his appreciation for Dio and even helped raise his profile a little higher but it's hightime he gave up this awful \"metal\" side project and stuck to acting. The fact the Tenacious D movie, \"The Pick Of Destiny\", was a box office flop should have been a sirenesque wake-up call. Once you become a parody of a parody you've officially jumped the shark. The movie has a few laughs but the best scene in the flick is the brief one with Dio although the song he appears on, \"Kickapoo\", is pure drivel. Meat Loaf also sucks (but he has balls (or is masochistic) to sing on the same track as Dio and thus effectively show how tremendously inferior he is vocally).\n\nI've read many comments about this being Dio's \"return to form\" but then what was \"Magica\"? And to be honest I consider \"Strange Highways\" and \"Angry Machines\" to be solid albums as well. I saw a video recently where the man himself called \"Strange Highways\" one of his best albums. Dio never made a truly poor studio album so there's no need for him to \"return to form\". The EP \"Intermission\" was the record label's gaffe. Dio wanted a 2 LP live album but got stuck with that head scratcher of a stop-gap release instead. \n\nDio's \"valleys\" were not too far from his peaks and the peaks are very high. Some albums are just better than others. \"Killing The Dragon\" has a few mediocre songs (\"Before The Fall\", \"Cold Feet\", \"Throw Away Children\") but all the ingredients we (Dio fans) want are here- that amazing voice, killer guitar riffs and fantastic imagery in the lyrics. It probably ranks in the bottom third of his ten studio albums but it's still a keeper. There's some real gems here other than the title cut and \"Spider\". Dio's always had a concern for the welfare of children (\"Who cries for the children? I dooooo\" from \"Stars\", anyone?) so the musically plain, \"Throw Away Children\" reeks of sincerity:\n\n\"Someone's thrown away their children\nYou can see them running from your smile\nSing for the runaway children\nThe throw-away child\"\n\n\"Someone's thrown away their children\nYou can hear them only if you try\nSing for the runaway children\nGoodbye\"\n\nAs a side note both \"Killing The Dragon\" & \"Magica\" are out-of-print but have been re-released together as a 2 CD set for the price of one BUT the liners do not contain lyrics or session info. Instead a long and tedious fanboy essay fills the booklet. So while I purchased that 2 cd set first I have gone to buy the albums separately.\n",
        "\nDio was at the peak of his popularity with the release of \"Sacred Heart\". Both of his first two LPs had gone platinum in the U.S. (1,000,000 + in sales) and were successful across the globe. Some sort of backlash was inevitable. Many were quick to pounce on the album for being inferior to \"Holy Diver\" & \"The Last In Line\". This is true. Whereas, those other albums had no filler \"Sacred Heart\" had it's share of mediocrity (\"Shoot Shoot\", \"Fallen Angels\", etc..). Additionally, the production is slicker and it's obvious the band was gunning for a hit. Most likely it was record company pressure. The Dio band's first two LPs were big sellers- going Gold within a year and eventually certified platinum as already mentioned- so likely record execs though if they could get a mainstream radio hit they could better the numbers. At the time it was in the insipid, sappy power ballad. Well, Dio wasn't going there thank goodness. I wonder if they tried to get him to write one?\n\nThe pop metal \"Hungry For Heaven\" had appeared on a movie soundtrack (\"Vision Quest\") and achieved heavy airplay on Rock radio. If ever there was a Dio song (along with \"Rainbow In The Dark\") that should've made the Billboard Pop chart it was this but no dice. It's just appalling that utter crap like Twisted Sister could get a pop hit but Dio couldn't. Actually, it's to Dio's credit- he was just too metal and history now looks back with disdain on TS and bands like Quiet Riot while the Dio albums still get respect.\n\nThat's the U.S. In The U.K., Dio was charting but it was a different single, \"Rock And Roll Children\", that was the hit. It managed a #26 placing on the pop chart. So, yeah, \"Sacred Heart\" and the following album \"Dream Evil\" were the closest Dio ever came to the cliche' \"selling out\". So perhaps there was more keyboard and more melody but that is not selling out. Just think of how nauseating Poison was/is and you'll release that Dio never strayed that far from his signature sound. He always had a sense of melody, not just songs with memorable guitar riffs (like the overly-esteemed \"Iron Man\" from Ozzy/Sabbath days)\n\nInitially, this slightly more polished strategy worked as this became Dio's biggest selling album worldwide. But, for some reason Dio's fanbase began to dwindle shortly after it exited the charts. It wasn't grunge, which killed metal's popularity years later. It wasn't that Dio's songwriting skills wen't bankrupt (\"Dream Evil\" was a step up from this album). It's true the EP, \"Intermission\", wasn't well received but that's not it. What was it then? MTV's parade of photogenic Hair Band \"Rock\" bands plain and simple. Crappy bands like Poison, Winger, Warrant, Europe took up all the air space until Nirvana put an end to glam metal the way punk crushed disco.\n",
        "\nThe jokey title of this review is slightly misleading but please read on..... By the time this album was released (1996) I had lost interest in Dio and all hard rock and had moved on to other genres of music like Blues and Soul so even though I saw this CD on the shelf at the now defunct Tower Records I didn't purchase it. Perhaps I would have have reacted negatively the way some Dio fans and critics did towards this LP but up until last month I had never even heard a single note from the album. I hadn't purchased a Dio-related CD since 1992's \"Lock Up The Wolves\". I figured my wildly eclectic tastes had just narrowed some. But, there were a couple times I was tempted to purchase one of the Rhino Records compilations (\"The Very Beast Of\" or \"Stand Up And Shout: The Ronnie James Dio Anthology\") but they were always missing some songs I liked so I think I may just have been waiting for some 2 CD \"Essential Dio\" set like tons of other bands have out there.(I like real officially-released CDs so even though I could've downloaded and burned my own \"best of Dio\" I never did).\n\nSomehow my interest in Dio resurfaced about a month ago. I remember not thinking twice when I had read Dio died of stomach cancer in 2010. I had the same reaction when Freddie Mercury died (more about Freddie later). Yeah, I was kinda bummed because he was at one time part of my life. Still, I didn't rush out and buy a Dio album and become suddenly nostalgic. I guess I truly had forgotten why I liked Dio. I wasn't a metalhead when I liked him. It was his his voice. Since I had become a Christian in the interim I may have temporarily bought into the it's \"demonic music\" or something. It's natural to become super self-righteous when you finally find God but then eventually you balance out and don't sweat the small stuff. Dio is not and never was a Satanist. He didn't believe such a being even existed, let alone a literal \"heaven or hell\". It was all just fantasy to him. He was quoted as being \"fascinated\" by the whole \"good vs evil\" concept. Really, who isn't? Dio used the \"devil horns\", witches, angels, demons & dragons as just fantasy- escapism- entertainment. The \"devil horns\" is just a symbol for heavy metal music not some kind of satanic sign of the cross-like ritual for satanism. There may be some bands out there who may truly be satanists but not RJD. He didn't like organized religion but was pretty much an agnostic from what I've read and seen in interview. (I feel like I'm trying to justify my acceptance of Dio's music despite the \"dark content\" but like I've said before it's no different than playing Final Fantasy 9. If any fellow Christians are reading this to each their own. Follow your conscious. Ironically, I think Dio would say the same thing!)\n\nI think my renewed interest in Queen late last year was the catalyst. I love Freddie Mercury's voice and early Queen (first 4 albums in particular) and bands like Rainbow, Black Sabbath and Dio do have a little in common with the musical grandiosity of the music and mythical imagery in the lyrcs. And of course their vocalists most certainly do have something common. Both Mercury & Dio can sing beautifully melodic and then hit the high notes with full voice on harder songs without screeching (Halford) or using falsetto. Two best Rock singers ever these two. Anyway, I read somewhere how someone was comparing Mercury's and Dio's voices and noticing the similarity so I went to youtube and listened to a few of the most recent Dio tracks (as part of \"Heaven & Hell\") and I was on the hook. I have now purchased every single Dio-related CD post Elf in the past month! I regret not keeping up with his career for the last 20 years. He really was at another artistic peak with the terrific Heaven & Hell CD \"The Devil You Know\".\n\nAs regards \"Angrey Machines\" there's no doubt a progressive and even \"grunge\" influence is going on here. Just not as much as they'd lead you to believe. Yes, some of Dio's vocal phrasing reminds me of Cobain (Nirvana) and \"Dying In America's\" guitar intro is almost identical to \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" but there's also some strong melodic moments. The final track, \"This is Your Life\", is an absolutely gorgeous song. If Paul McCartney were to write a metal ballad this would be it. The song and Dio's vocals are definitely one of the highlights of his storied career. The snarling \"Black\", \"Golden Rules\" & \"Dying In America\" have memorable refrains and Dio's voice is flawless. \n\nOverall, the tone of the LP is very angry, which was the prevailing mood of grunge & progressive metal. Even in interviews around this time Dio seemed more cantankerous than normal. He was still annoyed that Black Sabbath couldn't stay together after he rejoined for \"Dehumanizer\". While \"Strange Highways\" followed and was the heaviest, most doom-filled Dio album ever it still was Dio. \"Angry Machines\" wasn't the Dio of the early days where he was hard as nails for the fun of it. He genuinely seems pissed if a bit frustrated (\"Dying In America\", \"Don't Tell The Kids\", etc...) on this album. Keep in mind that this was his first independent label album (as his Reprise/Warner Bros. contract was over). I doubt he was happy going from platinum record days down to an artist with a cult following. Metal was decimated by Grunge. Dio's last major label (Reprise) album had only charted at #142 on the Billboard Top 200 Albums, a precipitous drop from the #61 debut of his previous record (\"Lock Up The Wolves\"). Not surprisingly, \"Angry Machines\" did not chart and was quickly relegated to the scrap metal heap despite being an above average album.\n\nTrue, there are a couple real duds here. \"Hunter Of The Heart\" lumbers along and goes nowhere. Same goes for \"Double Monday\" and the weak \"Stay Out Of My Mind\" (This track is the only track Dio didn't co-write. It was solely credited to bassist Jeff Pilson. Although, lyrically banal, I rather like the long quasi-orchestrated instrumental section in the middle of the song). \"Big Sister\" suffers from seemingly misogynistic lyrics.\n\nSo, in retrospect, I probably wouldn't have been keen on this album had I purchased it in 1996. I hated grunge and nearly all metal bands other than Dio anyway. I would have thought: \"What the hell? Dio's gone grunge? I hate that whiney crap\". But having just gotten this album a month ago I think it rocks and is a nice slice of variety in the Dio canon. But, yes, it is likely the \"least\" great of all his LPs\n\n(On a side not the Japanese version contains the extra track \"God Hates Heavy Metal\", which would've been a nice replacement for some of the other tracks on the album. I just made my own \"Dio Rarities\" CD with this track and many other non-album or import-only cuts).\n",
        "\nFresh from his stint with the legendary Black Sabbath (\"Heaven & Hell\", \"Mob Rules\", & \"Live Evil\"), Dio forms his own band and releases one of the best metal albums of all time. It tops even that acclaimed Sabbath LP \"Heaven & Hell\".\n\nDrummer Vinny Appice also left Sabbath with Dio and together they formed the band \"Dio\". Dio recruited former Rainbow bassist Jimmy Bain and after a long search settled on guitarist Vivian Campbell. Despite Campbell's subsequent fame (Whitesnake, Def Leppard), half of the songs on \"Holy Diver\" were already written when he joined the band. He did receive writing credit on four (\"Caught In The Middle\", \"Gypsy\", \"Shame On The Night\", & most notably \"Rainbow In The Dark\"). Then again there are only nine songs on this album, which was was common at the time and there is no filler whatsoever. How anybody that appreciates Dio could rate this any less than perfect is bewildering. Yes, \"Rainbow In The Dark\" is pop metal (hit #14 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock chart) with keyboards and saturated the airwaves and MTV, but why hold that against the album? It's a great cut. You need at least one radio single on each album and this one fit the bill. \n\nOf course the title tract (#40 Mainstream Rock), the ominous \"Straight Through The Heart\", and the fast and ferocious \"Stand Up And Shout\" are the real highlights, but every track is top shelf material. \n\nOn a side note, I did find the cover a little offensive. Like Alice Cooper, I am a Christian and I certainly wouldn't support anything truly \"demonic\". The truth is that this type of music is just fantasy in the Dungeons and Dragons or Final Fantasy mode. Dio was never a Satanist (and didn't exploit such imagery as much as the insipid phony known as Ozzy Osbourne) and in reality most of his songs have a positive message or a happy ending where good conquers evil. Dio himself downplayed the cover's \"demonic\" elements in the bonus interview on the 2005 remaster as \"fantasy\" and suggested one \"not judge a book by its cover\".\n",
        "\nLike many, I had grown accustomed to the Dio of \"Holy Diver\", \"Last In Line\", \"Sacred Heart\", & \"Dream Evil\", so naturally I was expecting more of the same. \n\nUpon first listen of \"Wolves\" I was so disappointed I was going to trade it in for credit at my local record shop. It sported more slower, bluesy tempos. Sure, these days I'm into blues, but back then I wanted my metal music fast and powerful. The occasional slow or mid-tempo number was okay if, and ONLY if, the singer was something special. There aren't any much more special than Dio. Other than Freddie Mercury I can't think of any rock singer that matches him. It's the \"sound\" of his voice, not just his range and powerful rasp. It must feel great being able to scream and stay on key.\n\nI listened a second time and songs like \"Wild One\", \"Hey Angel\", & \"Walk On Water\" got to me, so I knew I had to keep at least those, but I didn't have a cd burner or computer at the time so I would only be able to save those songs on cassette. Might as well be a bloody 8-track tape (cassettes were about to suffer near total death thanks to the compact disc). So because those three songs were keepers, I listened again several times as it was the only cd in my car at the time and I grew to love this album from start to finish. Dio's voice is amazing and even the slow, bluesier songs grew on me. \n\nThe title cut is epic. The sound is huge and the mix is perfect. Just like they whined over \"Dream Evil\", some have complained that Vivian Campbell's presence was missed, but I didn't notice. I play closer attention to singers than guitarists anyway. 19 year old Rowan Robertson shreds like an old pro here. There's other personnel changes. Gone were keyboardists Claude Schnell and Jimmy Bain (replaced by Jens Johanson), as well as drummer Vinny Appice (replaced by former AC/DC drummer Simon Wright, but he retains writing credit on \"Born On The Sun\").\n\nReading other reviews, I've noticed this album has aged quite well.\n",
        "\nIt's really sad that one band can make so many shit song for one studio album. Although this release doesn't seem promising, no one can expect it to be so weak. It has its moments, and that's all. You have to be careful to capture those moments with your ear, otherwise they will easily slip away in the sea of this mediocrity. In most cases song which has name like the studio album has to be excellent one. That's so true here, 'cause besides that one two more deserve attention: The Prisoner Of Paradise and The Man Who Would Be King. Master Of The Moon shows beauty of Ronnie's voice with amazing refrain, doom metal riffs are cool, backing keyboards make nice and enjoyable ambient even though they are not lead instrument. With Japanese edition you can reward yourself with The Prisoner Of Paradise. It's faster than Master Of The Moon, but it has similar structure. Drums, rhythm guitar, bass guitar and keyboards created nice tempo and built this pleasant song. Ronnie sounds great too. The Man Who Would Be King gives power ballad feel, but it's just ordinary song with variable tempo. That's because of progressive metal touch, and after ballad intro, song gets standard doom metal heaviness.\n\nThis one could have been excellent, 'cause intro is really nice, Ronnie sings great, it has well-done mood changes, but close to the end song becomes a bit boring. That ending part decreased its chances to be the third excellent song. It's very good anyway. They Eyes has nice drums, electric and bass guitar rhythm. That combination made really enjoyable tempo and ambient, but the rest is nothing special at all. One More For The Road has nice classic heavy metal riffs, and faster tempo. This song is not slow like many others, and it probably stands as opener of this release which supposed to amaze listener, and make him keen on the rest of the album, but it didn't happen. Ronnie didn't make some greater performances, besides the fact that he fits well in songs Master Of The Moon, The Prisoner Of Paradise and The Man Who Would Be King. Generally speaking guitar solos are not impressive at all. There aren't many memorable riffs, but power chords with doom metal distortion. Also, lyrics are totally weird. You need to have a Dio's book beside you in order to understand the meaning of the lyrics. I can recognize his topic about good and evil, but the rest is too complicated for ordinary people who can't guess what went through his head while he was witting the lyrics.\n\nGood sides of this release:\nBesides two excellent songs Master Of The Moon and The Prisoner Of Paradise, and one very good song The Man Who Would Be King. If you want to fill your collection with this release, at least somehow find Japanese edition.\n\nBad sides of this release:\nIf you're not fan of Dio, or you want to try to give this band a listen, avoid this release, and don't waste your money. Majority of these songs are faceless, and they can't offer not a single good thing. There aren't many songs which will blow your mind or make you bang your head. Guitar solos are average, no interesting riffs and lyrics are hard to understand or don't have deeper meaning. Generally, this release is boring, faceless, not exciting or interesting.\n\nHighlights:\nMaster Of The Moon and The Prisoner Of Paradise.\n",
        "\nThis album is quite difficult to defend, even being the die-hard Dio fan I am. There are many problems with this album -- it lacks a great deal of direction; its progressive nature breaks away from Dio's traditional themes; and it generally contains many \"unfavorable\" elements when it comes to metal (seeming to be influenced some by the Groove Movement). Anyway, I shall defend it as best I can...\n\nIn the album, there's no really poor performance on the part of the performers -- Tracy G, Jeff Pilson, Vinny Appice, and Dio himself all perform well, and it's not as though they're lacking in experience playing together; Strange Highways is, in my opinion, a challenger to the classic Campbell era albums. The problem is that many of the songs lack the strength and conviction of previous efforts. For instance, compare a song like Institutional Man to the semi-similar Hollywood Black -- Institutional Man is not only quite a lot more chaotic, but it also lacks the intensity and power of its counterpart. The thundering bass line is there, the chugging riff carries on, the drumming is on tempo as always, and the vocal performance is fairly similar, but when it comes together, Angry Machines just sounds feeble in comparison.\n\nThere are many saving graces and exceptions to this rule, though. Hunter Of The Heart and Double Monday are both powerful enough tracks to make their way onto Inferno in the following years, and Dying In America gives a well-made contemporary track for Dio. Also, the diamond in the rough for this album, This Is Your Life, is one of the classic ballads Dio managed to throw into the workings of every album. Plus, for those who bought the Japanese release, the track God Hates Heavy Metal has a very unique and enjoyable sound, despite its low production quality.\n\nOverall, the problem with Angry Machines is that there's too much fluff with all of the progressivism and \"groove\", which detracts from the quality of the songs that turned out well on the album. If it didn't have those qualities, I'd imagine it'd be about as successful as Killing The Dragon, which isn't saying too much, but it just goes to show the expectations of Dio's fanbase at the time.\n\nStrip off the progressivism, and Angry Machines is a fairly good album. I'd recommend it to anyone willing to take some time to learn to look beyond its flaws and love it for what it is.\n",
        "\nRonnie James Dio has always possessed an uncanny ability at turning the most mundane of ideas into pure poetry. Never was this more clear than when he penned the lyrics for the opening speed metal fest off of \u201cThe Last In Line\u201d that became the 3rd and final promotional single before said album\u2019s release. With a title like \u201cWe Rock\u201d, the unsuspecting newcomer would instantly expect a bunch of goofiness in line with what was being churched out by Warrant and Helix around the same time, or perhaps at best a semi-intelligent party song in line with Warlock\u2019s latest homage to Judas Priest. But after closer examination commences, what is discovered is a deep and philosophical anthem that highlights Dio\u2019s views on life, religion, and heavy metal.\n\nIn contrast to \u201cThe Last In Line\u201d and \u201cMystery\u201d, which indicate a complete move to a larger arena-like character of song creation, \u201cWe Rock\u201d maintains most of the heavier and aggressive aspects of \u201cHoly Diver\u201d. The atmosphere does lean a bit towards an arena character, but not much more than \u201cStand Up And Shout\u201d did, and the riff assault is a good bit meaner, drawing some similarities to contemporary albums like \u201cScreaming For Vengeance\u201d and \u201cPiece Of Mind\u201d. It has one of those choruses that will never leave the memory of whoever hears it, as well as a scaled back and accessible, yet still quite expressive guitar display out of Vivian Campbell, who had previously set himself up to be among the more insane guitar shredders of 1983.\n\nThe b-side of this now quaint little double feature demonstrates more of a modernization of an old approach more applicable to Dio\u2019s past work with Rainbow. The principle riff of \u201cBreathless\u201d is where the primary strength lies, as that hard pounding power chord approach that was first explored on \u201cSmoke On The Water\u201d and then perfected on \u201cMan On The Silver Mountain\u201d scarcely ever fails when it\u2019s employed. There is a simple charm to Ronnie\u2019s vocal interpretation, but for the most part, this is a plainer, mid-paced, rock oriented song that is primarily carried by a single, catchy theme. It\u2019s one of the lesser rated songs to appear on \u201cThe Last In Line\u201d, but still quite fulfilling in itself.\n\nIf nothing else, it can be observed that Dio, like most well established acts, don\u2019t simply decide to be a complete stylistic 180. A logical evolution of the band\u2019s sound can be established here as it moves away from the raw, hard edged, Sabbath-like character of \u201cHoly Diver\u201d to both the lighter and radio friendly \u201cSacred Heart\u201d and the complex and insightful \u201cDream Evil\u201d. But for those who are steady adherents to the regimented diet of all things heavy metal, it\u2019s just one more piece off of a grand cake that was the metal movement of the 80s. Eat in good health.\n",
        "\nAmong the more offensive charges that can be levied against any artist with a sense of pride is the notion that they\u2019ve created a work of \u201cpop art\u201d. This isn\u2019t something that is necessarily unique to metal music, as many psychedelic bands from the 60s and hard rockers from the 70s would also shutter at being lumped in with what is now considered pop music today. But upon closer review, pop music is something of a misnomer as a genre that seems to only be consistent in its application to songs that are popular. There\u2019s really no other way to categorically explain how Miley Cirus gets off giving the horns to her audience when comparing her teeny bopper bubble gum music with the man who originally popularized the hand gesticulation. Such is the predicament that Dio\u2019s \u201cRainbow In The Dark\u201d suffers from as it copes with comparisons to various pop/rock hits that were continually churned out by the sex, drugs and rock n\u2019 roll wing of the NWOBHM and the emergent L.A. glam scene.\n\nIn spite of the rather grim implications of even entertaining a comparison between any of Dio\u2019s fine creations and pop music, it is a situation that is virtually unavoidable. Amidst the incredibly repetitive, spacey synthesizer melody that probably inspired Europe\u2019s \u201cThe Final Countdown\u201d, a really infectious main riff with a heavy usage of scream harmonics that probably inspired Zakk Wylde\u2019s style of playing, things just can\u2019t help but scream \u201cplay me!!!\u201d to the radio stations. It\u2019s heavy, Ronnie\u2019s vocal delivery is hard edged and doesn\u2019t skip up on a really gravely bite, but it\u2019s the sort of song that anyone can sing along with and smile at, regardless of the poetic lyrical themes that probably continue to fly over the heads of most of the morons populating Blender Magazine and Rolling Stone. Like its name suggests, it is a song that sleeps snuggly within a highly noble contradiction, a heavy metal anthem that both suit wearers and leather toting rebels can appreciate.\n\nWhile the a-side definitely stands as one of the best known songs in Dio\u2019s repertoire, the accompanying song \u201cGypsy\u201d does well to display the versatility of this band going back to its infancy. Some parallels could be drawn between it and the more rock based songs on \u201cMob Rules\u201d, particularly that of \u201cSlipping Away\u201d and \u201cVoodoo\u201d, relying on a singular riff to drive most of the song and provide the foundation upon which Dio builds castles with his towering voice. Barring perhaps \u201cStand Up And Shout\u201d, this is among the rawest and most aggressive of Dio\u2019s vocal offerings. While perhaps not quite up to the task of dominating the airwaves as the title song of this single, this song could just as easily enjoy regular radio play amidst the slew of older metal songs from \u201cThe Trooper\u201d to \u201cWild Child\u201d that rock radio occasionally dabbles with of late.\n\nAlthough the enmity that exists between pop music and metal will likely never be reconciled, one could stop just slightly short of attributing that reconciliation to this song. Dio himself was toying with disowning the song after its recent birth due to its bare simplicity and somewhat pop-like nature (due in good part to the quirky keyboard part), but thankfully it became a staple of his universal appeal. Some may call such a notion the anatomy of a sellout, but by the same token, the makings of a conversion away from the dull, artificially sweetened mainstream to something with more depth can be taken from this song, and I can testify that this song played a role in my abandonment of the pop/rock craze of the early 90s that Nirvana and Pearl Jam ushered in. Thank God, and indeed, thank Dio for \u201cRainbow In The Dark\u201d.\n",
        "\nLegacies are most often misplaced, and even if a particular work could be seen as an intricate part of the artist\u2019s legacy, it is often blown out of proportion to the point of stealing the glory of other opuses under the craftsman\u2019s catalog. In many respects, \u201cHoly Diver\u201d as an album demonstrates the worst aspects of this overpowering exaltation, as many occasional consumers of Dio\u2019s auditory cuisines will pass up many subsequent works and refer solely to said 1983 classic, in addition to his Sabbath collaboration \u201cHeaven And Hell\u201d and his classic Rainbow collection \u201cRising\u201d. But in spite of all this, objectively speaking, every song found on Dio\u2019s first solo offering is worthy of extensive praise and wonderment.\n\nInsofar as the first single of Dio\u2019s opening onslaught upon the metal masses as the true helmsman, the a-side and title track of the debut shows a slight refinement of his 3 year stint with Black Sabbath. The similarities between it and the title song of \u201cHeaven And Hell\u201d leap out at the listener almost immediately, though the overall duration of the song tends much more towards a plainer fanfare rather than an extended epic, although the atmospheric keyboard intro could be seen as a parallel piece of epic composition to the acoustic outro of the 1980 Sabbath song. Dio\u2019s vocal presentation provides an even greater contrast, being a bit more menacing than oratory-like. Likewise, Vivian\u2019s lead break has a much more frenzied nature, though still retains enough melodic points between the barrage of flashy runs and wild pitch bends to keep from becoming a mess of notes.\n\nThe b-sides speak a little bit less to Dio\u2019s recent stint with Sabbath, but still have a familiar character in reference to his past. \u201cDon\u2019t Talk To Strangers\u201d has a similar atmosphere to that of \u201cChildren Of The Sea\u201d, but much like with the a-side, this song elects to go a somber route rather than an epic one. The acoustic intro seeks listens more like a fatalistic lullaby than the backdrop of a grand philosophical narration, and Ronnie\u2019s ironic sarcasm at the way society teaches us to treat each other puts the face of alienated youth on the general emotion of helplessness. The solo marks one of Vivian\u2019s crowning achievements while in Dio, shredding left and right with no regard to subtlety and only slightly more towards brevity. The other accompanying song \u201cEvil Eyes\u201d would later appear on \u201cThe Last In Line\u201d takes a somewhat different route, as the aggression is restrained a little more in favor of a catchy route in line with said follow up album, and Dio\u2019s voice is a little more operatic than gravely. It is very different from the other two, but as with all things, different does not necessarily mean more or less, in any respect.\n\nUltimately the notion that one album can be labeled as Dio\u2019s legacy is somewhat off-putting to anyone who has really familiarized themselves with the entire band\u2019s discography. It is somewhat understandable that many take this view given that these songs are highly accessible in comparison to the later 80s and 90s material, and it\u2019s also not nearly as posh as \u201cSacred Heart\u201d, but even the greatest of albums can be pumped up to the point of nearly bursting from the pressure of its own fame. Nevertheless, the greatness of \u201cHoly Diver\u201d is undeniable, and all who have any interest in one of metal\u2019s mightiest and now sadly fallen heroes should not be without it.\n",
        "\nThis is by far the best single I have ever heard (or probably will ever with Dio's recent passing). This album basically sums up why Dio is such an iconic and brilliant musician.\n\nRainbow In the Dark, although originally deemed by Dio himself to be \"too pop\", is now considered one of the hallmarks of classic metal. It starts off with a wonderful little keyboard riff and heads into a powerful guitar riff and the similarly powerful vocals Dio is best known for. Just the first line of \"When there's lightning...\" sends a shiver down my spine with just how kick-ass he sounds. Following two verses of pure metal, we get an insane solo by Campbell. Its speed and intensity just blow me away every time I hear it. It then goes into the third and final verse, and, when it climaxes, you swear the world will end due to an overload of godly sounds.\n\nGypsy is basically just a great 80's hard rock song. It's got a nice riff to it, a fast solo, and vocals that could tear through steel. Although it is not as good as Rainbow In the Dark, they balance each other out quite well.\n\nAnyway, I recommend this album to literally anyone. Go out, buy it, and then rock out for the rest of your days.\n",
        "\nUnless any \"Magica II\" recordings ever see the light of day, I guess this 2004 effort is the last studio album Dio ever released while its bandleader was still a part of this life. This was also the first album to feature guitarist Craig Goldy since \"Magica\" as well as the first to feature bassist Jeff Pilson since \"Strange Highways.\"\n\nWhile 2002's \"Killing The Dragon\" suggested that the group would be going for a lighter direction, this release returns to the doomy sound of albums past. The songs move at a slower pace and the atmosphere is overwhelmingly dark in a way that hasn't been seen since \"Strange Highways.\" But while that effort was driven by an angrier outlook, this album is often more laid back and driven by smoother hooks that have more in common with the 80's efforts. In fact, this album's style seems to foreshadow the attitude that would drive Heaven And Hell's debut/comeback five years later...\n\nThe band's performance also remains solid in spite of the changes. Ronnie himself puts on a fantastic performance though his singing became more noticeably subdued around this time. While a few skeptics would interpret this as a sign of weakness, it goes along with the music quite nicely and helps with the hypnotic feeling. The rest of the band is also pretty good though I wish the bass performance stood out more. Pilson is a good bass player but he seems to get the shaft in comparison to the popular Jimmy Bain. Must be the Dokken connection...\n\nThe lyrics also provide some nice moments of duality and appear to be more topical than previous efforts. While songs such as \"End Of The World\" and \"In Dreams\" are driven by bits of cynicism, there are some moments of determination in \"I Am\" and the title track. Also worth noting are the twists of \"Shivers,\" the paranoia of \"The Eyes,\" and the Iraq War fueled quips on \"The Man Who Would Be King.\"\n\nWith these changes/restorations at work, the songs still manage to put out some great variety. You've got a few fast rockers (\"One More For The Road,\" \"Living The Lie\"), sweeping borderline epics (\"Master of the Moon,\" \"The Man Who Would Be King\"), upbeat tracks (\"End of the World,\" \"Shivers,\" \"Death By Love\"), and a few more hypnotic numbers (\"The Eyes,\" \"I Am,\" \"In Dreams\"). I think \"One More For The Road\" makes for a particularly blistering opener though I also appreciate \"Shivers\" and \"The Eyes\" for the former's driving riff and the latter's spooky guitar effects.\n\nOf course, this album isn't entirely perfect. While the first half is mostly strong, the second half seems weaker with some songs like \"I Am\" and \"In Dreams\" coming off as slight filler. It's also another one of those albums that may get crap for being slower, but people should really be used to it at this point...\n\n\"The Devil You Know\" may be Ronnie James Dio's glorious swan song but this album manages to end the Dio catalogue on a pretty strong note. Definitely worth checking out though it may be a little slow...\n\nMy Current Favorites:\n\"One More For The Road,\" \"Master Of The Moon,\" \"Shivers,\" \"The Man Who Would Be King,\" and \"The Eyes\"\n",
        "\nPerfect Pop Singles: Vol. 14\n\nWhy It\u2019s Perfect: Ah, to be adolescent again. I\u2019m convinced that the reason traditional heavy metal so appealed to me at this age wasn\u2019t because it spoke of power and confidence I\u2019d never have, or because it made me different from my peers or any of that other rot. Sure, it\u2019s loud and aggressive, but loudness and aggressiveness are qualities expressed in the performance. It\u2019s texture, like biting into a crunchy cookie. The songs themselves are often quite tasty, with a geeky-gothic slant to their melodies well known to fantasy nerds and videogamers. The much missed Ronnie James Dio\u2019s Rainbow in the Dark is about the best example I know of moat metal with this confectionary blend down pat. First, take the goofiest patch on your keyboard and (badly) play a ridiculous lilting renaissance lick. Double it with huge driving guitars (abusing pinch harmonics), add caveman percussion, sprinkle sub-Tolkien fantasy lyrics and mix at a reasonably brisk tempo. It\u2019s a generic recipe, and one much inclined toward tedium, but Ronnie had a way of elevating this stuff with cheerful alacrity. Yes, he\u2019s got that majestic growl and a dreamy-eyed croon to match it, but any number of (mostly Italian) singers can capably imitate it these days. Ronnie was different because his genuine pleasure to be making fantastic metal came through in the passion and craftsmanship he always brought to his work.\n\nRainbow in the Dark is one of those times his effort was rewarded with a stellar product. His lyrics are his usual potpourri of clich\u00e9s, rhymes for rhyme\u2019s sake and oblique references, and they become downright hilarious when you consider that they\u2019re about Ronnie leaving Black Sabbath, but AAAANNNNYWAY he delivers them with awesome spirit, ringing high and clear as often as he does low and testicular (by the way, you knew Ronnie was phoning it in a bit whenever he just roared through a track instead of using his entire vocal repertoire intelligently) . Perennially disgruntled guitarist Vivian Campbell responded with some of his best ever axework, hitting every baroque angle of the riff and then sending out showers of sparks throughout his flashy solo. And that freakin\u2019 keyboard lick, bashed out by Ronnie himself, is the very definition of metal\u2019s camp appeal. There isn\u2019t a moment of intentional irony in Rainbow in the Dark, much as was the case with Ronnie himself as a musician. He was always sincere about making powerful, encouraging and above all fun music for his beloved fans. And \u2018fun\u2019 is what Rainbow in the Dark is, fun like Dr. Feelgood or even The Girls Just Wanna Have Fun is for people who think slaying goblins and casting spells would be more fun than getting drunk in a nightclub. It\u2019s perfect pop for unpop people. Thanks for it, Ronnie.\n\nDefining Moment: \u201cLIKE A RAINBOW\u201d [pause] *dinky keyboard riff* \u201cLIKE A RAINBOW IN THE DARK\u201d [pause] *dinky keyboard riff* \u201cYEEEEEEEEEAAAAHHHHHH\u201d\n\nI agree with that sentiment.\n\nOther Great Songs by Dio: Ronnie had, arguably, the longest apex period of any single metal musician. From 1976, when his band Rainbow released Rising to 1983\u2019s solo Holy Diver, he was unstoppable. Much of what came to define metal was created in part by Dio\u2019s various ventures. Singles like Long Live Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll (Rainbow), Die Young (Black Sabbath) and The Last in Line (solo) solidified his credentials, while album tracks like Rainbow\u2019s magnificent Kill the King and Sabbath\u2019s Heaven and Hell became FM radio staples. If you want some traditional metal, there\u2019s much to gorge on here.\n\n For previous instalments in this series:\nhttp://perfectpopsingles.wordpress.com\t\nhttp://rateyourmusic.com/list/Six_o_the_Clock/perfect_pop_singles\n",
        "\nAn interesting thing to note about Dio, is that unlike many metal bands of this era, who were obsessed with appearing as badasses, Dio appeared as a more realistic figure. It's rare you'll ever hear Dio sing about Satan, or sing about how great metal is, or about war and civil injustice. Dio instead focused on real emotions and the things that really kept him up at night. He hid these true feelings behind metaphors which were truly genius, so that the more articulate fans could pick out the real meaning, but the more typical headbangers could think his songs were really about dragons and the devil.\n\nThe whole album is filled with these genius metaphors, but the best example of it would have to be the second-to-last track, \"Rainbow in the Dark\". Here, Dio sings about how alone and torn he felt after having been kicked out of Black Sabbath in favor of Ian Gillan. It's an extremly emotional track and a true masterpiece as it (at least to me) feels like it was written for you. It's like you confessed your feelings to Dio, so he's saying \"Dude, it's all going to be alright\". The keyboards add to this greatly, opening with one of the most memorable keyboard intros metal has ever had. \n\nOverall, this is a great track from a great artist, on a classic album. Of all of the metal ballads, I think this is my favourite (even above \"Fade to Black\"). I suggest you buy this song's respective album as soon as possible if you don't own it already.\n",
        "\nI was barely out of my training pants when it happened, but I'm pretty sure there was a great level of disappointment when the Dio-led lineup of Black Sabbath went their separate ways after the release of 1992's \"Dehumanizer.\" Fortunately Dio was able to bring original drummer Vinny Appice back into the fold, recruit Dokken bassist Jeff Pilson and WWIII guitarist Tracy G, and went with a completely new sound with this 1994 effort.\n\nWhile \"Dream Evil\" and \"Lock Up the Wolves\" embraced a darker direction compared to previous albums, this album really drowns itself in nihilism and appropriately picks up where \"Dehumanzier\" left off. Most of the songs are executed in a fusion of doom and groove metal, the riffs tend to go at a plodding pace, and the vocals continue in the angry style seen on \"Dehumanizer.\" Of course, there is some variation seen in the tocken ballad \"Give Her the Gun\" and the upbeat \"Here's To You,\" which would sound pretty awesome in a concert setting.\n\nThe lyrics are also some of the most pessimistic that the man has ever written and mostly deal with themes related to alienation, dysfunctional relationships, and disillusionment. But as \"Dehumanizer\" featured a sole light of optimism in the form of the individualistic \"I,\" this album's biggest flicker may occur in the seemingly fan friendly \"Here's To You.\" The title track may also deal with the theme of individuality but it is overshadowed by the perceived nihilism of assimilation.\n\nBut as evidenced by the frequent references to it, I feel that this album's most obvious flaw is the similarity between it and \"Dehumanizer.\" It does have its own unique voice but several songs do resemble those of the past. The balladry of \"Give Her the Gun\" often reminds me of \"Too Late\" and many of the typical tracks on here remind me of \"I\" at times. It's still a pretty damn good album and worth checking out for fans of Dio, Black Sabbath, and any other kinds of doom metal out there.\n\nPros:\n1) A nice change of direction\n2) Strong songwriting\n3) Solid riffs and angry vocals\n\nCons:\n1) May be too plodding for some\n2) Eerily similar to \"Dehumanzier\"\n3) Not as accessible as other efforts\n\nMy Current Favorites:\n\"Jesus, Mary, and the Holy Ghost,\" \"Strange Highways,\" \"One Foot in the Grave,\" \"Give Her the Gun,\" and \"Here's To You\"\n",
        "\n\"Magica\" may have served as a comeback of sorts and may have brought Dio into the millennium with a bang, but this 2002 effort may be a little closer to a return to form in terms of style. It is also the last album to feature original bassist Jimmy Bain and the only album to feature Whitesnake/Burning Rain guitarist Don Aldrich.\n\nMusically, this album seems to completely overlook the evolution towards slower and darker material that began on \"Dream Evil\" and instead embraces a sound that seems to resemble that of \"Holy Diver\" and \"The Last in Line.\" The atmosphere is a little lighter than the last few efforts, most of the songs themselves tend to go at an upbeat pace, the guitar riffs are executed at a higher speed, the bass is present in Bain's signature fashion, and the choruses are at their most accessible. In fact, I think I like this even more than I like \"The Last in Line.\" While the second half of that album occasionally sank into poppy keyboard-driven territory, this album's lighter tracks such as \"Push\" and \"Guilty\" manage to retain an attitude in the midst of the shine.\n\nBut like the older albums that this release is emulating, there are a few moments of darkness that still manage come in and take center stage between the lighter affairs. The title track opens the album on a fairly epic note with a foreboding atmosphere to boot, \"Scream\" plays out a more focused version of \"One Night In The City,\" and \"Rock & Roll\" is a slower number that channels memories of 9/11 as well as the main riff from \"Kashmir.\"\n\n\"Throw Away Children\" is another dark tune but I feel that this song really deserves its own paragraph for it may be the saddest thing that Dio has ever had a part in. The verses feature a slow, building riff under a sorrowful vocal performance and the chorus soon brings in an unforgettable hook that is only intensified by the climax's use of a children's choir. If the climax of this song doesn't affect you emotionally in any way, there's a good chance that you may have no soul. End of story.\n\nWhen taking everything into consideration, this is a pretty hard album to find serious flaws for. There is a hint of the cheese that appeared on the old albums, but I don't think fans would expect any different. This is definitely an album for the fans and probably one of my favorites in spite of how late into his career it was released. Definitely a good first purchase for newer fans if you haven't already bought \"Holy Diver\"...\n\nPros:\n1) Great change of style\n2) Excellent band performance\n3) Good mix of dark and light songs\n\nCons:\n1) A slight hint of cheese\n2) May be too light for some\n3) A few lesser songs here and there\n\nMy Current Favorites:\n\"Killing the Dragon,\" \"Scream,\" \"Rock & Roll,\" \"Push,\" and \"Throw Away Children\"\n",
        "\nIt was back in 1982 that one of the greatest vocalists and personalities of heavy metal, R.J.Dio, was practically kicked out of Black Sabbath after being their singer for two excellent albums, Heaven and Hell and Mob Rules. Shortly after he formed his own band and his answer to Sabbath were two, also great albums, Holy Diver and The Last in Line.\n\nHaving found a steady line-up, Dio released another album in 1985, called Sacred Heart. All the members of Dio, referring to them as a band and not as a single person, were very good musicians with great skills, so this release was awaited by metal fans with big expectation. And even though it did not come-up to the standards of Holy Diver, they were not let down.\n\nDio\u2019s style hadn\u2019t changed and Sacred Heart followed the footsteps of The Last in Line. Ronnie James\u2019 abilities as a singer were not questionable and indeed, the short man with the magnificent voice is once again in great form. His unique vocals are a match for only a few other singers. He also wrote all the lyrics himself. The only problem of the album is that, not all compositions are of the same quality.\n\nIn here there are some heavy metal diamonds such as the opening track, King of Rock and Roll. A perfect introduction to the album that rocks your ass with a beautiful riff line by Vivian Campbell. Many rock fans know him from Def Lepard but his playing in Dio was superb. There is also the, known to all, metal hymn Rock \u2018N\u2019 Roll Children. The melodic keyboard lines add a wonderful feeling to the song. They are accompanied by the excellent drums of Appice and the strong bass performance of Bain.\n\nOne step below, are the songs Just Another Day and Another Lie. The first one is a fine piece of genuine hard rock/metal. With a little more than three minutes in duration, it is probably the fastest track of the album. The familiar vocals of Dio and the beautiful guitar solo place it among the top moments of the album. Another Lie is somewhat slower in speed but equally good. It has a nice break somewhere in the middle and an exploding finale. These two tracks complete, what we can say, the better half of the album.\n\nThe other half is filled with more mediocre though not bad songs. The self-titled song is the longest one, with six and a half minutes of playing time. A typical Dio melody is what you\u2019ll find in this one. It could be useful if you wanted to make a compilation of Dio\u2019s best songs but nothing more.\n\nAll the remaining tracks are there to fill the album. Stuff that you have heard in the releases prior to Sacred Heart. They are not horrible but it seems as if they begin to lose their inspiration as time goes by. Especially the last song, Shoot Shoot could have been left out. You can listen to them if you are doing something else at the same time but not if you want to be excited.\n\nIn general, Sacred Heart is a good album that has its great, good and bad moments. I was not disappointed but not thrilled either. I am sure that they didn\u2019t make new fans with this one and on the other hand their old dedicated fans did not lose the faith in this great band\u2019s abilities.\n",
        "\nBack at the 70\u2019s, Rainbow was the band that ruled in the rock scene. Then out of a sudden, their singer R.J.Dio was out of the group. It was a shock for the fans. Before they knew it, Dio joined Black Sabbath in the place of Ozzy Osbourne. A fitting combination that gave us to memorable albums, Heaven and Hell and Mob Rules. This huge singer and personality had proved that he did not depend on Blackmore. So, what kept him from proving the same thing to Tony Iommi when he was fired from Sabbath? He recruited three skillful musicians and in no time, Dio\u2019s first release came out at the disk stores, with the brilliant title, Holy Diver.\n\nHaving worked with those two monstrous musicians I mentioned earlier, Dio gained much in experience, knowledge and fame. On Holy Diver, Dio combine the sound of Rainbow and Sabbath and the result was an epic, hailed by the metal fans. Holy Diver is a metal monument and Dio\u2019s top achievement. With nine songs that stick to your mind, it is heavy and technical at the same time, thanks to the virtuoso guitarist, Vivian Campbell. His inspired riffs and divine solos give another dimension to the album. I must also mention the important contribution of Bain, the bass player and Appice, the drummer of Dio. Everybody knows how important it is to have a good rhythm section if you want to go far as a band.\n\nThe album begins in a thunderous way. The bombastic riff of Stand up and Shout gives us a fair warning of what is about to happen. Then the bass and drums come in to fill the picture and urge us to do as the title says; to stand up and shout with all our strength that heavy metal will never die as long as bands like Dio are here. Rock \u2018till you drop! The self-titled song is considered to be Dio\u2019s greatest hit. Don\u2019t mind the bit long introduction. Focus on the majesty of this remarkable composition. Beautiful guitar theme, nice breaks and Dio\u2026 my God what a singer!\n\nIf there are few tracks in here that are kind of poorer in quality, these are Gypsy and Shame on the night. Gypsy is a mid-tempo but mature song, typical Dio. I listen to it with ease. I can\u2019t say the same for Shame on the Night. It\u2019s rather slow and mediocre. It falls too behind compared to the other diamonds of Holy Diver. Don\u2019t let that ruin your whole opinion of the album.\n\nAnd now we get to the best song I think Dio have ever written. The one and only Don\u2019t Talk to Strangers. It is a song that will be forever a Dio classic, a hymn for heavy metal. Starting with a serene melodic riff and gentle vocals, it turns into a river of hot, boiling metal that flows in your veins. I get the chills whenever I listen to it. It reaches divinity. There are just a few other songs like this in metal. Perhaps Rainbow in the Dark could be a match but it loses by a breath. Another fantastic song, with awesome keyboards and a tremendous performance by R.J.Dio Unique in its own way. I have to say that the crystal clear production of Holy Diver allows the bass and the drums to stay at the front line.\n\nBut there is more. A hinch of perfection can be found in Caught in The Middle. Steady pace and a pure rock atmosphere are the characteristics for this one. It\u2019s a song that speaks Straight Through the Heart. Another great piece of work. The smashing drum intro by Appice gives you the first punch in the stomach before Dio unleash some streaming rock energy. Invisible, kind of sounds to me like the Holy Diver song, though not as excellent. Dio\u2019s angry vocals give life to this one.\n\nThe best leverage of Holy Diver is that it\u2019s a well balanced album. There are no fillers but songs that are heard with great pleasure. It\u2019s a colossal release, superb and one that Dio never surpassed. It turns out that what happened between Sabbath and Dio was for our best. Otherwise we wouldn\u2019t have gotten this precious asset in our collections. Don\u2019t you think so?\n",
        "\n\"Holy Diver\" may be seen as Dio's classic album and \"Sacred Heart\" may be their most commercially successful, but I always find this effort to be one of the band's most criminally underrated. Released in 1990, it has been constantly overlooked due to the music industry's changing times in spite of it being one of the band's strongest releases to date. It is also the first album to feature AC/DC drummer Simon Wright and the only one to feature bassist Teddy Cook, Stratovarius keyboard legend Jen Johansson, and DC4 guitarist Rowan Robertson.\n\nJust as \"Dream Evil\" was an expansion of elements on \"Sacred Heart,\" this album seems to expand on several things that were merely hinted at on \"Dream Evil.\" Despite the presence of the talented Johansson, the keyboards have been pushed into the background and result in a more sinister and less dated sound when compared to previous efforts. There is also a subtle blues/doom metal influence to be found and mid-tempo groove based songs like the title track and \"Evil On Queen Street\" are featured more prominently than in the past. Of course, the slower approach is nothing compared to what would come on the next few Dio albums and the frontman's second stint with Sabbath...\n\nEven with the slower tempos brought in, this album still has a great deal of variety and familiarity in the presentation of songs. Songs like \"Wild One\" and \"Walk On Water\" show off fast speeds in the vein of \"Stand Up And Shout,\" \"Born On The Sun\" is a triumphant number similar to \"The Last in Line,\" \"Between Two Hearts\" is a somber ballad with acoustic melodies contrasting building blues licks, and \"My Eyes\" shares an epic flair with some of the group's past closers. There are also no filler tracks to be found and every song is strongly written and performed.\n\nThe band itself pulls off a great performance and comes together as a unit in the face of the more legendary line-ups. Robertson is an excellent shredder comparable to Vivian Campbell and Craig Goldy and Wright is a surprisingly competent replacement for the great Vinny Appice. On the other hand, Cook's bass playing isn't as flashy as Jimmy Bain's and it'd be cool if the keyboards were a bit more prominent in the album's sound (This is the Stratovarius guy, after all...). And I don't think I need to say anything about Dio himself. He sounds as great as ever and these are some of his most intriguing lyrics since the \"Holy Diver\" days.\n\nEven though I have a soft spot for \"Holy Diver,\" I think this may be my overall favorite Dio album. It is an underrated effort that shows a band soldiering on in the face of a complete member/style overhaul. Too bad it's the only album to feature this line-up...\n\nPros:\n1) A great mix of old and new elements\n2) A darker, less dated atmosphere\n3) Excellent band performance\n4) Great songwriting\n\nCons:\n1) I wish the keyboards were a little more prominent\n2) Why didn't they do more with this line-up?!\n\nMy Current Favorites:\n\"The Wild One,\" \"Born On The Sun,\" \"Between Two Hearts,\" \"Night Music,\" and \"Evil On Queen Street\"\n",
        "\nA lot of people have been talking about Holy Diver since its first release in the year 1983. What rock fan doesn't know who Dio is? Even without the help of guys like Jack Black and his insipid musical endeavors, Dio is just a crucial part of rock and metal culture, with his iconic voice, mystical and imaginative lyrics and unstoppable charisma. He doesn't change, he doesn't sell out and he is always at tip top form on any album he is asked to sing on. Holy Diver is perhaps his most iconic point, and here I go, diving right in to review it.\n\nRight from the start, Dio wastes no time, barreling open with the ricocheting \"Stand Up and Shout\" motivating you to do what metalheads do best, and providing a thoroughly uplifting hook in the process. The sound is a very thin one, crisp and nimble, without any real crunch to the guitars, and there will probably be some days when you yearn for something a bit meatier and more fattening, but the charm is always there, there is no denying that. The melodies are agile and laid back, the riffs are classic slabs of rocking goodness and Dio's voice is as melodious and wondrous as it has ever been. It soars, it dives and it belts out some of the catchiest vocals you'll ever hear.\n\nThe title track is perhaps the most known song on here, with its hard rock groove and idiosyncratic lyrics being fronted by Dio's signature wail and creating what is one of metal's all time trademark tunes, right up there with \"Master of Puppets,\" \"Painkiller\" and \"The Number of the Beast.\" Yet, it's not even near the only great song on here, or even the best one: it's followed up with the AC/DC-invoking \"Gypsy,\" the catchy, infectious hook of \"Rainbow in the Dark,\" the melodious fretting of \"Caught in the Middle\" and \"Straight Through the Heart,\" the ominous and significantly more metallic \"Invisible\" and \"Shame on the Night\" and my favorite in the half-ballad \"Don't Talk to Strangers.\" See? I told you every song had something to offer. Next time you should just take my word for it.\n\nBut really, this album is just full of great moments as well as great songs. It lacks any form of pretension and doesn't try to do that much; it's only goal is to provide a set of good songs, which it does. Every song is instantly memorable and automatically replayable. The album is short and allows for multiple plays in a short period of time, if one so desired - which I usually do not; for any album. It's the little things that matter, like the build up in \"Don't Talk to Strangers,\" or the sheer mountainous heaviness of a song like \"Shame on the Night,\" which is especially effective at the very end of the album. How about the opening of \"Rainbow in the Dark,\" with its supremely catchy keyboard melody, and then the bouncy groove that follows? Or the intricacy of the guitar melodies in \"Caught in the Middle\" behind Dio's vocals? Every song has these subtle and yet simple things to them that make them insanely enjoyable. The hooks here are masterfully crafted, effective from just one listen. Sure, it isn't terribly innovative, but it's just such a damned crafty album - the hooks are devilish; they'll never leave you! Dio certainly knew how to work his target audience.\n\nAnd the fucking drumming, too. Vinny Appice is no stranger to the metal scene, and here he plays his heart out as if he were a man with ten hearts instead of one. His playing is acrobatic, dynamic and all around superb, backing up the songs on Holy Diver with insane precision and delicacy. Just pick any song here, and the drumming is out of this world. Would I lie to you? I don't think I would. Especially since I just devoted a whole paragraph to the drumming.\n\nRecently, it has been a trend for people to subject this great album a kind of revisionist scrutiny that leaves me quite confused. I see people on this website calling it overrated, calling certain songs 'filler,' and saying there are boring parts...what? Did they just not grow up listening to rock music? Have they some higher standard to which this kind of classic, rocking metal must conform? Really, there's no accounting for taste and all, but I just can't legitimately see eye to eye with the view that this and albums like it are overrated. They just...aren't. Even if you don't personally like this album, calling it overrated is about as silly as calling it underrated - it is what it is, and what it is is one of the classic metal albums. You can nitpick all you want and dissect every song, but it's missing the point, and I have never had a taste for such so-called scholarly reviewing practices, anyway.\n\nJust...the way I always think of this album is just that it isn't doing any harm. That can also be misconstrued as a bad thing in some cases, but here it's just different. Holy Diver is as honest and stripped down as rock music comes. It is teaching moral lessons and telling stories, veiled in a cloak of electric guitars and harmonious solo playing, and it is not attempting to do anything but that. There isn't any anger here, only a creative fire that needed to grow and be nurtured, and Dio knew it. Bashing this album doesn't seem very productive at all; it wasn't doing anything to you, so why would you do it? There is far too much value placed on dissecting every single last tidbit of a song - I just call it trying too fucking hard. I know it doesn't really apply to everyone, but really, there is some truth to the whole idea of people placing too much weight on how heavy or technical something is, and as soon as they can put aside those presumptions, they will be able to enjoy music like Holy Diver a lot more. Yeah, even I don't think this is as good as Heaven & Hell or some of the better Rainbow stuff, but that says absolutely nothing for the quality of this album on its own.\n\nI mean, it's Holy Diver, one of the easiest going and most simplistic Heavy Metal milestones you'll find. Yet we have endless cases of people who listen to this album expecting something other than what it is, which is basically a metal album from the days when the subgenre was just getting off its laurels to progress. It is an album that does not aim to offend a single soul, an album crafted from a simple and basic love of the rock and metal genres, of the sound of a distorted guitar, a wailing voice and a kick ass drum beat to go along with them, and the magic they produce. And that is a damn worthy cause.\n",
        "\nKilling The Dragon while Dio\u2019s original style is much more present than on previous releases the quality is a big step downwards. First off a great deal of Killing The Dragon is filled with pointless filler. The songs are much more repetitive especially on Rock & Roll easily Dio\u2019s worst song to date. The songs on average are longer than Angry Machines and Magica and add even more to the very repetitive nature of many of Killing The Dragon\u2019s songs.\n\nMost of the songs take the more mid-tempo/doom metal approach that Dio has been using since Lock Up The Wolves. The exceptions to the rule are the title track, Along Comes A Spider, and Push easily the best songs on the album. The production is very good but no production can bring the majority of these songs to life. The guitar work is very restrained and limits each song to a few simple riffs. Solos are simple and only highlight on the first two songs and Push.\n\nThe band member\u2019s performances are solid at best but certainly not top-notch. Dio\u2019s voice is showing his years and he just doesn\u2019t sing like he used to. Doug Aldrich is probably the biggest reason Killing The Dragon is so disappointing putting many uninspired leads and riffs in the album. The rest of the member\u2019s performances are solid and don\u2019t really contribute to the downfall of Killing The Dragon.\n\nAs said above Killing The Dragon is full of uninspired songs and weaknesses. The album length and song lengths are to long and could have been shortened to take away some of the repetitive nature of the songs. At the very least Killing The Dragon is made up of half filler and half solid songs, making it very uneven. Dio seems to be at a loss of direction and making things up as he goes along.\n\nKilling The Dragon is overall probably Dio\u2019s worst album to date and certainly not even close to a comeback album. Best songs are Killing The Dragon, Along Comes A Spider, and Push. I only recommend this release to diehard fans of Dio otherwise please stay away for your own good.\n\n-10 points many uninspired performances\n-10 points album length and song lengths are too long\n-5 points a large portion of Killing The Dragon is full of filler\n-5 points Dio\u2019s vocal performance is far from his early material\n-3 points loss of direction on Killing The Dragon\n",
        "\nMany consider Sacred Heart to be a step down from The Last in Line but I conclude the opposite. The Last in Line while having better standouts than Sacred Heart doesn\u2019t have as good of an overall cohesive structure. Like Sacred Heart The Last in Line is more speed metal based than Dio\u2019s debut album Holy Diver. The Last in line is less repetitive considering more focus on changing riffs than chorus based songs.\n\nThe songs range from mid-tempo traditional/power metal songs to the more speed metal numbers like We Rock. The choruses are strong as usual but like on Sacred Heart most of the songs are more lead and riff based than on Holy Diver. The Last in Line is a bit heavier than Dio\u2019s debut and on ever future release the albums would continue to get heavier. This time around The Last in Line epic number is the awesome Egypt (The Chains Are On) being easily one of Dio\u2019s most melodic and greatest songwriting accomplishments of his long career.\n\nRonnie James Dio\u2019s voice shines the most on the title track and Egypt (The Chains Are On). His performances on the rest of the songs are average for him but nothing special. Vivian Campbell guitar work is the highlight of the album and really shows his abilities to draw you in on his leads and solos. Jimmy Bain hasn\u2019t changed since Holy Diver his bass guitar is still audible and his performance is solid. Vinny Appice\u2019s drum work is more solid here than on Holy Diver unfortunately he doesn\u2019t really bring much attention to himself. A new member is present in Claude Schnell he shows that he is much better at providing keyboard atmosphere than Dio was.\n\nThe Last in Line unfortunately has its fair share of weaknesses as well. A few filler songs are present which really brings down the albums effectiveness. While the album standouts are pretty good they aren\u2019t as entertaining as on Holy Diver. Finally Dio\u2019s lyrics are easily some of his corniest yet and make many of the songs funnier than they are entertaining.\n\nThe Last in line isn\u2019t as good as Holy Diver but is certainly a solid follow up. Best songs are We Rock, I Speed at Night, Evil Eyes, and the album standout Egypt (The Chains Are On). I recommend this album to Ronnie James Dio aficionados and any fan of classic power metal.\n\n-10 points filler songs are present bringing the score down a lot\n-5 points weaker standouts and overall weaker album than Dio\u2019s debut\n-5 points some of Dio\u2019s corniest lyrics of his career\n",
        "\nThis album gets a whole lot of undeserved praise. From new fans to experienced metalheads, almost everybody seems to worship Holy Diver. The thing is, though, it\u2019s not all that great. Despite a few great songs and the phenomenal Ronnie James Dio, the album tends to plod along in generic \u201880s fashion. Of course, you have to give the band credit for what they do manage to achieve on Dio\u2019s solo debut, as these peaks are some of the greatest traditional-styled metal ever unleashed.\n\nThe band\u2019s legendary frontman as well as its rock-solid musical foundation makes for potentially engrossing music. And things go well for a few songs, after which it becomes apparent that Dio\u2019s solo band is no Black Sabbath. Great tracks like the opener and \u201cDon\u2019t Talk to Strangers\u201d are somewhat castrated by the more average songs like \u201cInvisible.\u201d And let\u2019s face it \u2013 there\u2019s nothing more annoying than an obviously talented band playing average music. When the music delivers, it delivers HARD, and so there\u2019s no excuse for the lack of continued quality.\n\nSuch monsters as the opening \u201cStand Up and Shout\u201d revel in the great, memorable riffs complemented by excellent backing bass, invigorating lyrics, and a truly powerful Dio. This song, for example, benefits highly from the rough delivery Dio exudes, a sharp contrast to his melodic style shown on his first Sabbath offering. He screams, shouts, and rallies with passion and luster. An excellently toned bass backs up the song, giving it a firm platform for blazing guitars and vocals. The title track, as well, implants a heavy dose of headbang fever. The fantasy-influenced lyrics contained within have become a staple of Dio\u2019s songwriting craft, and the truly classic main riff and powerful vocal melodies make for a well-rounded slab of metal mastery. Let\u2019s also not forget the immortal \u201clook out!\u201d in the middle. Two other songs \u2013 \u201cGypsy\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t Talk to Strangers\u201d also are top-notch, offering two different ends of the musical spectrum, that being a heavy, speed-addled rocker and a brooding, malevolent and eerie ballad, respectively.\n\nUnfortunately, the rest of the album cannot hope to compare to the glory displayed on the aforementioned four songs. Some tracks, like \u201cCaught in the Middle,\u201d open well with interesting riffs, but later become unimaginative and plodding. Some songs even have little to no musical appeal, like \u201cShame On the Night,\u201d an immediately boring piece of drivel with its light riff that just doesn\u2019t convey any real power and its sing-over-bass predictability. Mostly, though, the album is just plain average. \u201cRainbow in the Dark\u201d is all right despite its insipid synthesizer noodling in the beginning, but doesn\u2019t really go anywhere and remains just one song in an album of mid-paced rockers. This medium tempo just adds to the feeling of boredom prevalent in a lot of the album.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 when Dio and company get into it, the output really works. But songs with lacking conviction and power shroud those moments. As such, the album\u2019s typically average quality is its biggest downfall. Dio really can do much better.\n",
        "\nIf I ever needed a proper entry into the wild world of Mr. Dio, it would be this one, brought on to me by an old high school chum who said \"THIS is heavy metal!\". This was what followed after my ear drums took a savage beating with NILE's \"Black Seeds of Vengeance\", and was musically akin to jogging half a block after enduring a four-minute mile; not nearly as powerful as was let on. I understand the classicness of this album, especially the title track, but in complete and utter honesty this doesn't quite live up to its legendary hype.\n\nOf course, most of the attention is lumped into the title track, where the fans feel Dio hit his high note (how depressing to have had done so on the FIRST SONG...), an unloaded magnum opus that at best squirts water. Sure, the guitars have a good melodic hook, the keyboard intro is nice and epic, and Ronnie-boy letting loose the slightly captivating, sober drawls that made him such a hit with BLACK SABBATH, but the song itself just kinda plugs along, with three minutes of material stretched longer than it should. And unfortunately the rest of the album suffers the same fate, only at differing lengths. The over-all delivery is still competent and very traditionally 80s sounding, wherein the guitar lines meld with the vocals and simplistic drums quite nicely, but the music itself lacks the punch it should, and instead sorta beats the hooks and melodies into your head through repetitious chord arrangements, from the mild (\u201cDon\u2019t Talk to Strangers\u201d, \u201cInvisible\u201d and \u201cShame on the Night\u201d) to the extreme (the title track, \u201cRainbow in the Dark\u201d and \u201cGypsy\u201d). I\u2019m sure this was great in the 80s, but nowadays this comes off as slightly bland.\n\nSo all in all this isn\u2019t really a worthless album, just overhyped. DIO definitely had big shoes to fill in the albums hence, as it all comes back to this. As for me, I\u2019d like to thank Ronnie for the offer I unfortunately have to refuse, and will stick to some MERCYFUL FATE instead.\n",
        "\nMaster of the Moon is certainly a step up from Killing The Dragon in quality and songwriting even boasting a few progressive metal moments. Dio decided to bring some older ideas to the table this time around mainly the much more doom metal oriented tempo and atmosphere. Master of the Moon is probably Dio\u2019s most melodic and atmosphere oriented album he has ever released, even his voice is less of a focus here. Guitar work is also less of a focus, instead repeating slow-tempo and mid-tempo riffs drag the album along literally.\n\nThe songs themselves are filled with a heavier keyboard use than on any other Dio release. Melodic doom metal as said above is certainly the main focus on Master of the Moon and I can safely say because of this factor this is Dio\u2019s heaviest album to date. Most of the songs are solid unlike Killing The Dragon which had some really good standouts but a lot of throw away songs. Like usual Dio starts off a few songs in a ballad type format like on The Man Who Would Be King.\n\nDio unfortunately gives one of his worst vocal performances of his career he is old so I will give him that but he just can\u2019t compare to his younger self. Craig Goldy solos less here than on any other album with Dio and really doesn\u2019t use to many leads mainly slow and galloping riffs. Jeff Pilson bass is very audible considering the songs have a very low end bass feel to them. The rest of the member\u2019s performances are solid but nothing special.\n\nMaster of the Moon does have some big problems mainly in the enjoy ability factor. While most of the songs are entertaining they also repeat themselves to much and lack that epic sound that Dio is known for. Solos, leads, and choruses that were so important to Dio\u2019s previous albums are almost entirely non present on Master of the Moon. Finally no speed metal numbers are present which a disappointment is considering Dio always wrote strong speedy songs.\n\nMaster of the Moon while far from an excellent album should be praised manly because of the new take on Dio\u2019s sound and the heaviness which is unequaled compared to any other Dio release. Best songs are One More For The Road, Shivers, Living The Lie, and Death By Love. I recommend this release only to diehard Dio fans and doom metal aficionados.\n\n-5 points no speed metal songs present\n-5 points much more repetitive than on other Dio releases\n-5 points Dio\u2019s trademark epic ness is not present \n-5 points leads, solos, and choruses suffer on this release\n",
        "\nDio\u2019s Holy Diver while being a darn good release is certainly not a metal classic. I do agree that Holy Diver is certainly one of Dio\u2019s best albums containing some of his best songs. Filler is present on some of the songs on this album like the album low point Shame on The Night. Holy Diver has more variety than the average Dio release also and shows some of his best songwriting and choruses. \n\nHoly Diver\u2019s songs range from early speed metal numbers, classic mid-tempo metal anthems, and melodic power metal. Practically ever song is mid-tempo or slower besides Stand Up And Shout, and Don\u2019t Talk To Strangers both being some of the fastest songs Dio wrote in the 80\u2019s. Keyboards are used both by Ronnie and Jimmy providing a great atmospheric intro to the title track and some nice notes throughout Rainbow In The dark. Semi-ballads are represented in the beginning of Don\u2019t Talk To Strangers, and Invisible. Most songs on Holy Diver start with a strong lead than alternate between lead and main riff for most of the song.\n\nThe band\u2019s performance is very solid considering they all were experienced musicians at this time. Ronnie James Dio\u2019s vocals on Holy Diver are easily one of his best performances of his career showcasing his excellent range, melodic singing, and his ruff much more metal vocals. Vivian Campbell\u2019s guitar work is probably his best of the three Dio albums he plays on, he\u2019s well suited for crafting great classic metal leads and mid- tempo riffs that are either solid or excellent. Jimmy Bain\u2019s bass guitar on Holy diver is very audible and really adds a nice low end effect to songs like Holy Diver and Straight Through The Heart. Vinny Appice\u2019s drumming is his usual mid-tempo beats with lots of fills and hard hitting pounding.\n\nUnfortunately Holy Diver is not a classic metal album a few major problems really take away from this albums enjoy ability. First off as said above filler is present on a few songs like the majority of Shame On The Night (a bad way to end a solid album), Straight Through The Heart, and Gypsy. Holy Diver seems to be based around four songs Stand Up And Shout, Holy Diver, Don\u2019t Talk To Strangers, and Rainbow In The Dark. The rest of Holy Diver is not nearly as high quality as those four songs. \n\nHoly Diver is certainly a solid album albeit an overrated album. Best songs are Stand Up And Shout, Holy Diver, Don\u2019t Talk To Strangers, and Rainbow In The Dark. I recommend Holy Diver to any fan of Dio and classic metal but don\u2019t expect this release to be an all time metal classic because it is not.\n\n-5 points filler is present weakens quality of album\n-5 points Holy Diver is based around to much around the standouts and not around the overall quality of the album\n-5 points holy Diver ends on a low point with Shame On The Night easily one of Dio\u2019s worst songs\n",
        "\nDio\u2019s Sacred Heart is an improvement over The Last in Line in terms of overall album cohesiveness though it does lack as strong standout tracks. Sacred Heart is played in the same manor as Dio\u2019s first two releases containing the more traditional/classic metal vibe, with the occasional more speed metal oriented songs. The reason why I said Sacred Heart is an improvement over the Last in Line is because it\u2019s based more on the album as a whole then the individual songs. Filler is less prevalent but the standouts suffer because of this they are weaker than on Holy Diver and The Last in Line.\n\nThe band\u2019s performance is top notch, especially Vivian Campbell\u2019s (this being Vivians last album with Dio). Filler is present but every Dio album has at least some filler present. Keyboard usage is even more prevalent than on previous outings. The choruses are weaker too, and it seems that Ronnie wanted a much more guitar-oriented feel to Sacred Heart and it worked. Sacred Heart could have used a change of style or some new elements added which would have increased the entertainment value of this album. Finally the production is well done as usual, though it would have been nice to hear one of Dio\u2019s semi ballads on Sacred Heart.\n\nSacred Heart while nothing special is certainly a solid album with some very memorable parts to it. Almost forgot about the lyrical approach is the usual fantasy oriented trademark Dio lyrics with a usage of metaphors. The best songs are King of Rock and Roll, Sacred Heart, Rock \u2018N\u2019 Roll Children, and Just Another Day, Hungry For Heaven is also a standout because it has the best chorus of the album. I recommend this album to fans of Dio and traditional metal only.\n\n-6 Some filler is present\n-8 Standouts are weaker than usual for Dio\n-3 No new elements are added to the album\n",
        "\nWhen this live album was recorded Dio was into his sixtieth year, his performance is great especially since he is so old and still touring like a mad man, but his voice isn't in top form on all the songs. Evil Or Divine: Live in New York while being quite good especially for a live album doesn\u2019t really have any songs that haven\u2019t been on previous compilations or live albums by Dio except for some newer material from Magica and Killing the Dragon. The production is top notch and really makes this album shine, and the rest of the members are on the top of their game as well. Many of Dio\u2019s more speed metal oriented songs on here are even faster live especially We Rock.\n\nThe problems with this album sadly are partly because of Dio while for the most part he does these classics justice, you can tell his voice isn\u2019t what it used to be. Again the track listing is also a flaw the Rainbow and Black Sabbath songs have been played live enough and it would have been better if he pulled out some more classic Dio songs. King of Rock and Roll, Strange Highways, Lock Up The Wolves, and Sacred Heart are just some of Dio\u2019s classics that I would have enjoyed much more on this album. Another problem is that Evil Or Divine relies too much on material from Killing The Dragon which was a disappointing release, and worse not even the best songs off that album are even present. Unfortunately the main reason why Evil Or Divine relies so heavily on Killing The Dragon because this album was recorded from that tour. \n\nThe album highlight is certainly Doug Aldrich\u2019s excellent 9 minute solo which has multiple styles like blues, shred, classic metal, and even a hint of neo-classical metal throughout its duration. Overall a great live album that is quite enjoyable to listen to. The best songs are Egypt/Children of the Sea (A great mix of both songs), Don\u2019t Talk to Strangers, the Guitar Solo, and We Rock. I recommend this album to fans of Dio and any fan of classic metal looking for a good live album. \n\n-6 points Dio\u2019s somewhat erratic performance\n-7 Track listing could have been much better\n-7 Relies too much on material from Killing The Dragon\n",
        "\nDio\u2019s fourth album has proven to be an interesting turning point in terms of the band\u2019s history and sound. It was the first album to feature Rough Cutt guitarist Craig Goldy, the last to ever feature keyboardist Claude Schnell, the last to feature drummer Vinny Appice until 1994\u2019s \"Strange Highways,\" and the last to feature bassist Jimmy Bain until 2000\u2019s \"Magica.\"\n\nMusically, the album seems to take the keyboard oriented sound of 1985\u2019s \"Sacred Heart\" to a whole new level. While that album seemed to use the keyboards to create more commercial and, dare I say, fluffy textures, this effort uses to create a dark and foreboding atmosphere. These techniques are especially effective on tracks such as the epic \"All the Fools Sailed Away\" and \"Naked in the Rain.\" Of course, the commercial tendencies of the last album are still retained in the form of \"I Could Have Been a Dreamer,\" though the song itself is much darker than \"Hungry for Heaven\" or \"Mystery.\"\n\nAside from the keyboards, everything else is performed in the classic standard that we\u2019ve all come to love. The rhythm section is always solid and distinct, the riffs and solos are strong and memorable, and Dio himself continues to sing in top form. The songs themselves consist of speed metal tracks (\"Night People,\" \"Sunset Superman\"), dramatic mid-tempo tunes (\"Naked in the Rain,\" \"When a Woman Cries\"), and even a few bluesier numbers (The title track, \"Overlove\"). In fact, it makes me think of what Black Sabbath was doing at the time with vocalist Tony Martin...\n\nWhile Dio\u2019s lyrics have always been about sympathizing with the underdog and overcoming adversity, his specific themes seemed to have changed with this effort. While previous albums (Particularly \"SH\") dealt with themes related to fantasy and the supernatural, this tune seems to focus on more realistic ideas. Of course, there are still hints of cheese in the mire and it\u2019s still quite the challenge to determine the meaning of tracks such as \"Sunset Superman...\"\n\nLike previous efforts, this album\u2019s main flaw seems to be related to its dated sound. The songwriting itself is done in good taste but the keyboard layering and kooky sound effects may make this an intolerable listen for closed minded metal fans. Another thing I\u2019ve noticed is that a few songs seem to borrow from Dio\u2019s older material. The title track\u2019s bluesy main riff is rather similar to that of Rainbow\u2019s \"Man on the Silver Mountain\" and the structure of Overlove reminds me of \"Kill the King\" with its energetic guitar playing and soaring vocal lines. Fortunately, it\u2019s not that big of an issue as he\u2019s ripping off his own bands...\n\nAlbums such as \"Lock up the Wolves\" would expand on what this album only hints at, but it stands alongside \"Holy Diver,\" \"LUTW,\" and \"Magica\" as one of the strongest Dio albums to date.\n\nPros: \n1) An excellent band performance, with Goldy in particular standing out.\n2) Memorable songs and catchy hooks.\n3) An interestingly dark atmosphere\n\nCons:\n1) Occasionally dated keyboards/sound effects\n2) A few unoriginal moments\n3) An over-reliance on one-liner choruses.\n\nMy Current Favorites:\n\"Night People,\" \"Dream Evil,\" \"All the Fools Sailed Away,\" \"Naked in the Rain,\" and \"Overlove\"\n",
        "\nAlthough for the most part Dio\u2019s 3rd LP \u201cSacred Heart\u201d was a somewhat watered down follow up to \u201cThe Last In Line\u201d, there were many positive elements at play in the album. This was even true with regards to one of the more commercial/radio oriented singles from the album \u201cRock And Roll Children\u201d, though mostly from a lyrical standpoint. The riff material is extremely simple, even by the standards set by songs such as \u201cMystery\u201d and \u201cRainbow In The Dark\u201d. There are very few fills thrown in to vary the riffs, the keyboards have a strong enough presence to soften the punch of the guitars and the rhythm section, and all attention essentially focuses on Ronnie\u2019s vocal performance and lyrics. Although more descriptive than metaphorical, the universal message of overcoming society and rediscovering love for those who identify with your way of life is powerfully presented here, and even more so in the music video this spawned despite the obvious campiness of the 80s sound that both the song and the video embody.\n\nThe b-side here is taken from one of the later gigs that the band played with Vivian still in the fold, and the performance that he puts on for this Philadelphia Spectrum show (a frequent stop for this band) is among his better moments. He doesn\u2019t cut loose as much or take as many liberties with the solo as most of the ones who would fill his shoes do, but his performance is expressive and to the point in comparison to the original studio version he put together. Likewise, the consistent quality of Dio live performances by all in the band is very well maintained, though I think the keyboards are just a tiny bit too prominent on this version, though not nearly as much so as would be the case on the 1998 version that the band did with Tracey G on the guitar.\n\nIn much the opposite respect as the more pop oriented single that preceded this \u201cHungry For Heaven\u201d, the title song has a clich\u00e9 message which is presented in such a masterful and vocative way that it comes off fresh every time I hear it. I wouldn\u2019t quite put it above the title song on \u201cSacred Heart\u201d in terms of its musical content, which is definitely in tune with the formulaic minor key progressions of the time; the lyrical message is just a tiny bit stronger because of how universal it is. Not everyone can identify with a D&D take on overcoming hardships in life and taking chances, but I think that pretty much anyone can easily identify with the feeling of being an outcast.\n",
        "\n\u201cSacred Heart\u201d is often criticized by purists as being a wholly commercial endeavor. While I personally don\u2019t fully concur with this view being applied to the entire album, several songs definitely exhibit traits of a much tamer, keyboard oriented, and simplistic approach to songwriting. The most blatant example of this direction is found in \u201cHungry For Heaven\u201d, not only for the formulaic and already somewhat clich\u00e9 at this time approach to songwriting that sort of comes off as a simplified version of \u201cMystery\u201d with a slight Bon Jovi feel to the keyboards, but in a very rudimentary thematic message in the lyrics of living life to the fullest. It\u2019s essentially a positively based and less subtle version of \u201cDon\u2019t Talk To Stranger\u201d, dealing less with the fear mongering of authority figures and more with giving advice on how to better enjoy life.\n\nThe b-side \u201cKing Of Rock And Roll\u201d is something of an honest portrayal of the rock star as a powerful and influential icon for those who attend the concert, whether this is simply an ode to the awesome experience of a live concert or something deeper is anybody\u2019s guess. Much like the title track it takes a simplistic approach to riffing, but applies it to the harder edged, speed injected side of Dio\u2019s paradigm, sort of like \u201cEvil Eyes\u201d but without a lot of the turnarounds and a much less open ended chorus. All in all, it\u2019s among the strictest of Dio\u2019s speed metal songs, essentially skipping a bridge or interlude in favor of a basic verse to chorus with a guitar solo thrown in for good measure.\n\nThe principle flaw with this single, and more particularly the a-side, is the issue of staying power. \u201cHungry For Heaven\u201d is fun in the same way that \u201cLiving On A Prayer\u201d is fun when hearing it on those rare occasions when I give the radio a chance to redeem itself (it never does, for the record). But repeated listens see the song loosing its punch, for the most part because of there being no musical or lyrical surprises. It\u2019s a fun listen occasionally, but I often find myself skipping over it for more \u201cThe Last In Line\u201d styled songs on the \u201cSacred Heart\u201d album such as \u201cAnother Day\u201d and the title song.\n",
        "\nThis is something of an afterthought in the wake of \u201cLock Up The Wolves\u201d being released and a new lineup that seemed intended as a much more permanent affair than it turned out to be. It\u2019s a collection of 9 music videos done by Dio between 1983 and 1990, flowing more as a promotional video sampler than a compilation, and missing a few notable videos such as \u201cMystery\u201d and \u201cI Could Have Been A Dreamer\u201d. It features Ronnie doing a brief commentary before each video, and by brief I mean that he sums up the videos in a few short sentences and doesn\u2019t really go much into the background of each song. Those who would be interested in getting this VHS should thus come to it not expecting a series of humorous outtakes or interview-like moments where Dio says something really deep or thought provoking. Essentially it\u2019s the videos that do the talking, and naturally they vary pretty significantly in what they say.\n\nThings kick off with the first promotional music video from \u201cLock Up The Wolves\u201d in \u201cWild One\u201d, completely solidifying this video\u2019s nature as a promotional offering. It is among the most well produced and entertaining of Dio\u2019s various video offerings, featuring the band on stage doing what they do best, with a few nice scenes of some kids doing skateboard tricks on the street. The video transitions are extremely smooth and the band looks genuinely into what they\u2019re doing. Afterwards things jump all the way back to the beginning and we are treated to Dio\u2019s two most off-the-hook and comical videos ever. Although the video plotlines don\u2019t fit the song lyrics at all and Dio looks like he\u2019s doing a goofy parody of \u201cConan The Barbarian\u201d on the \u201cHoly Diver\u201d video, they are pretty fun to watch.\n\nFrom here on in, everything that follows is of a higher grade than the 1983 material, and basically falls into two categories. The first is the videos made up of concert footage in a montage approach, \u201cHungry For Heaven\u201d and \u201cStand Up And Shout\u201d featuring footage from shows done with Vivian Campbell, \u201cKing Of Rock And Roll\u201d taken from the famous show done at the Philadelphia spectrum with the giant mechanical dragon when Craig Goldie joined the fold. These videos give you a pretty good idea of the mannerisms of the band on stage if you\u2019ve never seen any of their live performances from 83\u2018-86\u2019 on VHS or DVD. Craig is clearly the more confident on stage of the two guitarists featured, although I will say that despite being a bit stiff in front of a crowd, he puts on an adequate performance and new misses a note.\n\nThe other category are videos with stories that mostly fit the lyrics of the songs. Although \u201cThe Last In Line\u201d presents a very bleak image combining a sort of futuristic 1984 tyrannical underworld and what looks like a depiction of Dante\u2019s City Of Dis, I chuckle every time I see people being tortured with electric shocks being sent to their heads via Vivian Campbell\u2019s guitar during the solos. \u201cAll The Fools Sailed Away\u201d has some nice imagery going on, but the 3 minutes of music that gets chopped off of this version really throws off the flow of the song. \u201cRock And Roll Children\u201d is basically the highlight video on here, though not necessarily my favorite song by this band, the theme of 2 people fighting against the world for what they want out of life really touches a note with me. I\u2019m not sure if Dio came up with the plotline of this video himself or not, but the way the encounters that the two kids have when they enter the nightmare world that Ronnie transports them to change their lives and appreciate each other is something that most everyone can identify with.\n\nIt\u2019s tough to say whether this can be qualified as an essential purchase or not, as it doesn\u2019t quite stack up to the content that you get with the DVD re-releases of Dio\u2019s famed concerts in the 80s or even the concerts themselves when they were in VHS form, but it\u2019s the only collection of music videos that has ever come out of this band. It all hinges on how much of a rabid fan you are of this band, whether or not you even bother with VCRs anymore, and what your tolerance level for 80s music videos is, as some of these videos take 80s clich\u00e9s to a level just a rung below on the corniness ladder from ones like \u201cSafety Dance\u201d and \u201cWhip It\u201d.\n",
        "\nThe mid-80s was essentially the peak of Dio as a commercial force, and like many who hit their zenith in sales, what follows is often a fall from the top. In the case of this particular outfit, what fell off was their original guitarist, who many hail as the greatest of all the ones that Ronnie has brought into this particular project. But before going, he left the old guard of Dio fanatics who never accepted anything past \u201cSacred Heart\u201d one more little gem before going the way of the glam rock switcheroo, and that is the famed \u201cHide In The Rainbow\u201d, a song written for the motion picture soundtrack of \u201cIron Eagle\u201d. This release is basically the first place outside of the soundtrack where this song could be obtained.\n\nFrom the airy, dream like keyboard intro, it is obvious that Dio was bound for a different direction, a direction that would yield the more mature though often misunderstood \u201cDream Evil\u201d album. Although the keyboard presence is equally as high in the arrangement as it was on \u201cSacred Heart\u201d, the riff work is a good deal heavier and a bit on the doom side. It\u2019s uncharacteristically slow and dissonant for most of this band\u2019s previous efforts, save perhaps for \u201cEgypt (The Chains Are On\u201d and \u201cShame On The Night\u201d, both of which were also included on here as b-side material. The resulting effect is a song and an EP that listens almost like a Solitude Aeternus release but with 80s sounding keyboards.\n\nThe only real flaw in this release is the inclusion of \u201cHungry For Heaven\u201d, which is much more of a radio oriented single sort of song and listens a lot lighter that the other 3. The lyrics are extremely straightforward and the various riffs and melodic material are pretty clich\u00e9 for the time period. Granted, the lyrics of \u201cHide In The Rainbow\u201d are pretty much a metaphorical description of the main character of the movie it was written for and his various trials and tribulations launching a one fighter plane assault against an entire military complex in the Middle East, but the flow of the EP is definitely interrupted by the outlying song in question.\n\nI rarely rant and rave about the differences between experiencing music via vinyl or compact disc, but I don\u2019t think you can really experience Dio until you\u2019ve heard at least one of his releases on vinyl. Of all the various vinyl releases that he put out in the 80s, this is the one that is probably the easiest to track down and is also the most worthwhile as it has a great song that can\u2019t really be found anywhere else save the \u201cDiamonds\u201d compilation, which is not widely available in the USA and will set you back a bit on import charges. It\u2019s most particularly a catch for all of you purists who can\u2019t stand Dio without Vivian, I\u2019m not crazy about his attitude of late, but I have to hand it him here, this is one hell of a catchy song.\n",
        "\nThis is one of very few cases where a slightly obscure song sampler approach to a compilation actually works quite well. In general these compilations tend to take an approach of selecting songs from eras that are mostly untouched and including less obligatory hits. Other Dio compilations that have taken this route will not base their selection off of a particular time period, thus throwing off any kind of potential consistency to the listening experience, and also include songs that are also found on virtually every best of compilation to come out under his name. This one does the exact opposite and limits itself explicitly to the work from 84\u2018-90\u2018, completely avoiding the \u201cHoly Diver\u201d album save for \u201cStand Up And Shout\u201d, which was adapted to music video format a couple years after the album came out, and also tilts heavy towards \u201cDream Evil\u201d and \u201cLock Up The Wolves\u201d.\n\nNaturally there are some flaws in the pacing of the album and the general flow of things stylistically from start to finish, as no two songs from the same album occur next to each other. Sometime the transitions are relatively smooth, such as the move from \u201cMystery\u201d to \u201cI Could\u2019ve Been A Dreamer\u201d, both of which play off a similar mid tempo idea set and sound close enough to each other in production to see like it\u2019s the same band. The same holds true for the move from the up tempo rocker \u201cOverlove\u201d to the more grooving and heavy edged \u201cLike The Beat Of A Heart\u201d, which has a driving riff feel not all that dissimilar from \u201cStraight Through The Heart\u201d. All of these songs could function well together had they been put on the same album originally and are very much underrated. Having said that, every time one of the \u201cLock Up The Wolves\u201d either precedes or follows something from one of the other 3 albums, there is definitely a large discrepancy in both the production character and style that almost makes it sound like two bands are part of a split album, but alternating tracks rather than being at opposite ends of the play list.\n\nThe true strength in this release is the large representation of the latter two albums in the time period covered. \u201cLock Up The Wolves\u201d in particular gets shelved as being almost akin to a misbegotten side project by some, particularly Vivian Campbell enthusiasts. The sad thing is that these people are missing out on great epic guitar rockers like \u201cHey Angel\u201d and \u201cNight Music\u201d, not to mention energetic up tempo riff and lead blazers like \u201cWhy Are They Watching Me?\u201d and \u201cWalk On Water\u201d. The whole album was essentially a rediscovery of that proto-metal form of hard edged 70s rock that was heard on the Rainbow albums that Dio appeared on, with a heavier guitar tone and a slightly more Van Halen oriented approach to lead guitar work.\n\nIf someone was in a position where they only wanted to get the obligatory classics by Dio on CD, namely \u201cHoly Diver\u201d and \u201cThe Last In Line\u201d, this could be seen as a cost effective way to experience some of the other 3 albums without getting too much overlap from what you already have. Granted, as far as I\u2019m concerned all of Dio\u2019s first 5 albums are essential listening for anyone who loves epic sounding heavy metal. The re-mastering of these songs has not robbed them of their initial charm, although it does help to bridge the massive gap between the sound of the 80s albums and \u201cLock Up The Wolves\u201d. Not an essential purchase for someone who already has the albums in question, but possibly something to pick up in a discount bin if you own the original pressings of the albums and are curious as to how their character may have been altered.\n",
        "\nDio has made a habit of constructing simple songs with a sort of subtle charm to them, many of them involving lyrics about personal struggle, non-conformity and individualism. \u201cI Could Have Been A Dreamer\u201d takes a less specific route than its equivalent on the previous album \u201cRock N\u2019 Roll Children\u201d and talks through a universal voice that all can identify with every time society tries to push them to think or act a certain way. It was particularly after Vivian\u2019s exodus from the band that Ronnie became a bit of a fan of using wolves as an adversarial symbol. In this case, equating society to a wolf pack mentality where individuality results in being ostracized and even exiled. The song itself is very formulaic, consisting of one driving main riff that is about as simple as they come and a chorus that is built off of two chords.\n\nThe accompanying b-sides are a bit more interesting musically, though lyrically the subjects tend to follow the same line of the individual or the minority versus the rest of society. \u201cNight People\u201d is cut from a similar brand of fast songs in the vain of \u201cKing Of Rock And Roll\u201d and \u201cEvil Eyes\u201d, but with a more minimal riff set that draws more from a Deep Purple/Rainbow influence and has a more atmospheric keyboard aesthetic to it. \u201cSunset Superman\u201d is one of the few songs from the \u201cDream Evil\u201d album that seems to reach back to the Vivian Campbell approach to riffing, although Craig\u2019s solo is much more epic and gradually developed. The keyboard intro to this is one of the most original sounding things to come out of Dio\u2019s career, starting off with a really pristine and lovely atmospheric aesthetic before descending into something a bit darker and forbidding. It bears some similarity to the epic musical storytelling of \u201cOne Night In The City\u201d, but is much faster and tighter.\n\nThere are still a few copies of this floating around in its original turntable form on eBay, so rabid vinyl fanatics and completists will find a home here if they so choose, but its not an essential purchase the way \u201cDream Evil\u201d is. This is the most underrated era of Dio\u2019s career as far as I\u2019m concerned, particularly amongst the critical field. Granted, you can\u2019t expect much musical insight out of the likes of elite music media tycoons like Rolling Stone magazine who essentially can\u2019t get themselves out of the late 1960s. But if you like good metal music, you don\u2019t need any sort of media outlet telling you how to think about music, so put in a copy of Dio and enjoy life and leave the cynicism to the people who still think that music is about anything else besides music.\n",
        "\nWhile most tend to remember Dio for their mid 80s material with Vivian Campbell blazing up the fret board and all of the fantasy theme trappings to boot, as well as the famed return of Dio fronted Black Sabbath with a new and heavier sound, the middle era of Dio after Vivian left the band is often ignored or not looked upon as favorably. This was not really much a result of the quality of the music declining, although some mildly noticeable changes in the band\u2019s sound began to emerge, but more of a strange yet all too familiar phenomenon where fans get attached to lineups of a band rather than the product they put out. Most who dismiss \u201cDream Evil\u201d as an afterthought have probably not heard it all the way through or had their minds made up the minute that Campbell\u2019s name ceased to appear on the album\u2019s liner. \n\nAnyway, after \u201cDream Evil\u201d fell a little short of the sales precedents set by previous albums, the band went into a state of limbo for a while. There was a period before the band completely collapsed where some songwriting went on and ended up occupying about half of \u201cLock Up The Wolves\u201d, but ultimately the character of Dio\u2019s sound shifted a bit due to the input of Rowan Robertson, who had a much more bluesy and classic rock take on riff construction and soloing than either Campbell or Goldie. Likewise, the addition of former AC/DC drummer Simon Wright brought a much stricter and more regimented sense of rhythm to the arrangement, as opposed to the freer flowing, quasi-jam feel that Appice had brought with him to the earlier Dio albums from his brief stint with Ronnie in Black Sabbath.\n\nThe resulting songs had the same epic quality in most cases, but were coated with more of a rock exterior rather than the fast metallic riff assault of the Campbell years or the somewhat slower and darker approach of Goldie. One of the best examples of this is the album track \u201cHey Angel\u201d, which is the lead off song and title track of this single. The opening riff definitely takes some cues from Accept, although the general feel of the song definitely has something of a \u201cHeaven And Hell\u201d era Sabbath vibe to it. Rowan definitely shows a bit of a tendency to develop his riffs and avoids playing the exact same thing twice in much the same way that his predecessors did, but there is a sense of openness to the chords that he uses which heavily contrasts with the other two. His solo definitely takes the road of gradual development, starting with a small idea and then working it up to a climax, rather than fast tracking to the impressive parts the way Vivian often would. In basically all respects, this song is geared towards the guitar, as everything else sort of grooves along and plays support. Even Dio\u2019s lyrics are very straightforward and lack all of the poetic themes that often accompany his longer, more ambitious songs.\n\nThe 3 songs that come along with this single are somewhat curious, mostly because they are cut from the same style of straightforward, verse to chorus approach to songwriting that Dio began adopting in 1984, but all of which sound completely different from the principle song. \u201cMystery\u201d and \u201cRock And Roll Children\u201d are heavily keyboard oriented and light listening compared to the heavy ended nature of Dio\u2019s new sound. \u201cWe Rock\u201d is essentially a speed metal song with something of an arena vibe to it; not too far out of character from the lead off song except in term of tempo. The only logical sense that can be gleaned from their inclusion here is that this era of Dio was being sold as a return to the form established before \u201cDream Evil\u201d, which is pretty far off from what the actual sound of \u201cLock Up The Wolves\u201d comes out as. There are maybe some commonalities with \u201cHoly Diver\u201d on a couple of songs, but the overall feel of the album has more in common with Ronnie\u2019s work with Rainbow that either \u201cThe Last In Line\u201d or \u201cSacred Heart\u201d.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing here that can\u2019t be found on Dio\u2019s various studio releases between 83\u2019 and 90\u2019, so tracking this down is only recommended for those who are completists and who prefer vinyl to Cds. It\u2019s an interesting era of this band, one that basically lasted for a year or so and then completely went away. The only thing of permanence to come out of this is that about 10 years down the road Simon Wright would become a much more permanent member of Dio in the absence of Vinnie Appice after 1999.\n",
        "\nHaving a large collection of cloned or otherwise useless compilations under your name is something of an occupational hazard if you\u2019re an established name in heavy metal. Few suffer from this dilemma more than the founders of the genre Black Sabbath and many of its members who since went on to their own projects, and although Dio has been an established name on his own, he has a fair share of pointless releases under his moniker. This particular release essentially functions as a poor man\u2019s \u201cStand Up And Shout: The Dio Anthology\u201d, as it covers most of the esteemed metal icon\u2019s career since the 1970s. They took the route of less Elf material and more Rainbow and Dio songs, which results in a much heavier and more progressive character, but botch the song ordering and essentially churn out a two disc version of most cheap song sampler versions of compilations that ought to go for $4 a pop at best.\n\nTo give you an idea as to how random this comes off at times, I invite you to listen to the song \u201cHoochie Koochie Woman\u201d from Ronnie\u2019s Elf days and then listen to either \u201cSign Of The Southern Cross\u201d or \u201cDream Evil\u201d immediately afterward and then tell me if placing a formulaic old school rock song with an exceptional vocal performance next to either a longwinded acoustic doom epic or a heavier and faster version of \u201cMan On The Silver Mountain\u201d with a 1987 production would make sense when listening to an album, compilation or not. There is very little sense of pacing going on here at all, apart from a compilation that tries desperately to sound unique from those that use either the tried and true chronological approach, or some variant of an album emulation approach where the songs are placed in a certain order to simulate the feeling of listening to an actual studio release. The only place where this even begins to succeed at sounding like the latter of these two approaches is at the beginning with \u201cHoly Diver\u201d, which has that pristine keyboard intro with the sound of wind in the distance, a perfect segue to any album.\n\nA positive aspect of this album that does make it a superior one to many single CD compilations is that the greater amount of space gave the compilers the ability to represent every album in Dio\u2019s lengthy career with his own band. Too often albums such as \u201cLock Up The Wolves\u201d and \u201cDream Evil\u201d are woefully under represented and sometimes not at all, but here everything seems to be equal, though there is a little bit of a tilt towards \u201cHoly Diver\u201d and \u201cThe Last In Line\u201d, which is typical of most compilations under the Dio name. The choice of \u201cEvil Eyes\u201d was a particularly interesting choice given that it essentially functions as the missing link between the two albums represented here, having the more keyboard oriented character of \u201cThe Last In Line\u201d, but also having a really hard edged riff approach that is fairly similar to \u201cStand Up And Shout\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t Talk To Strangers\u201d. The only disappointment here is that from the vast number of great songs off of \u201cLock Up The Wolves\u201d, they had to go with the obligatory title track, which is all but interchangeable with the similarly slow and doom driven \u201cShame On The Night\u201d.\n\nI give this album credit for making some interesting song choices and for attempting to differentiate itself from the rest of the point, but this is not something that I recommend parting with monetary wealth over. You get songs on here that you won\u2019t get on the similarly long compilation \u201cStand Up And Shout: The Dio Anthology\u201d, but you don\u2019t get any songs that can\u2019t be found on other releases, whereas with the latter you get more Elf songs that are hard to come by and a solid live version of \u201cSacred Heart\u201d. If you like anything by Dio from his respective work with Rainbow and Sabbath, save up your pennies and get one of his full length releases from his 80s back catalog, you\u2019ll thank me later.\n",
        "\nI\u2019m not sure who to feel pity for here, the poor dope who put this compilation together or the slightly poorer dope who would pay money for it. It\u2019s not so much an issue of the album in question containing bad songs, but more so that the sheer multiplicity of compilations out there possessing most or all of these songs is so numerous that the reason for putting this together eludes me. I could much better rationalize re-releasing one of the half dozen existing compilations, but I guess we\u2019d have less album cover artists coming up with new trifles to go with insignificant releases.\n\nThe primary redeeming factor of this otherwise universal failure is the pacing from song to song. Although there isn\u2019t a consistent chronology at work in the track listing, each one of these songs tend to flow well into the other. The choice of \u201cHoly Diver\u201d as an opening song is basically a good one as it starts off with a nice dreary keyboard intro that functions well as a segue to the rest of the album. Things get picked up a notch with the more intense and emotional \u201cDon\u2019t Talk To Strangers\u201d and is maintained through the energetic yet more radio oriented and simplistic \u201cRainbow In The Dark\u201d. \n\nThings basically taper off the further the listen goes until it completely falls apart at the end. The inclusion of \u201cJesus, Mary And The Holy Ghost\u201d is puzzling as the sludge oriented riffs and generally aggressive atmosphere is completely at odds with all of the epic sounding 80s heavy/doom metal going on throughout the rest of this album. It\u2019s followed by the king of all Dio fanfares turned 80s mainstream listening \u201cHungry For Heaven\u201d, the weakest song from the weakest album of the Vivian Campbell years, owing much of its inferiority to that dominant, Bon Jovi oriented keyboard part that all but completely dwarfs the guitars. It\u2019s not the worse thing I\u2019ve ever heard and is actually mildly enjoyable, but is among the last songs that I\u2019d pick for any Dio compilation.\n\nThe general lesson learned here is that if you want to make 10 otherwise decent songs sound lacking, jam them together onto a series of interchangeable best of releases, varied only by what album art is being used and how the clich\u00e9d summation on the inside of the CD insert is worded. Don\u2019t waste your time on this and definitely don\u2019t waste your money on this. I feel cheated just for having spent 4 paragraphs trying to say something remotely positive about it.\n",
        "\nToo many bands decline from excellence with a steady flow of greatest hits compialtions. Megadeth, Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, and Dio. But while often these compilations are boring, lacking new material and poorly made, Dio's \"The Collection\" is one of the few truly great exceptions.\n\nLike any good Dio comp, the early hits Holy Diver and Rainbow in the Dark start off the album, with the excellent Don't Talk To Strangers thrown in between them. There are several hard to find live recordings on this album, which makes it something worth looking for if you're a collector. The true gem of these is the live version of The Last In Line.\n\nThe songs are broken up so that they don't become boring, and the live tracks are well recorded. Throughout the album, you really feel like you're at a Ronnie James Dio show in the mid-eighties, singing along to every line of Dream Evil and throwing the horns. \n\nDio was a very good singer for Black Sabbath, and his current work in Heaven and Hell is also quite noteworthy. This collection helps you to get a feel for his solo career and lets you jump right into the covnersation. Pick up \"The Collection\" is you want the only good Dio comp.\n",
        "\nThis is yet another Dio compilation that I was able to rescue from the diabolical clutches of the omnipotent Walmart, and it was no small task let me tell you. Its tentacles were forbidding, its jaws deadly, and its prices were simply irresistible. I had called in my Democrat US House Representative to help me do battle with the beast and rescue this little trinket, but despite his fantastic rhetoric on the evils of unfettered capitalism and his expertise in the art of socialist sorcery, he succumbed to the beast and spent his entire wallet maintaining the decrepit state of the 3rd world, promising not to be as rough on the scale-covered corporate leviathan during his next reelection campaign in exchange for a meager contribution and a free trip to Thailand. But I was undeterred and fought gallantly and came away with my prize without giving my entire life savings to the insidious monster. \n\nJust like with the other treasure I rescued while fighting the insurmountable Walmart dragon \u201cThe Very Beast Of\u201d, I got my $3 worth. I should probably also note that although this was worth what I paid for it, unlike the other compilation I would not have paid $4 for this one. From what I understand the actual retail price of this collection is $6, which would be a pretty good deal for a collection of Dio songs, but not necessarily this one. It\u2019s biggest problem has to do with track ordering, but song selection also plays a pretty large part in making this one of the worst compilations to ever carry the Dio name, thus making this determined crusader for musical justice feel as if he had fought in vain.\n\nThere is no established chronology established here, nor is there any actual accounting for pacing and transition, but instead a completely random grab-bag approach to track ordering. It starts off with two obligatory \u201cHoly Diver\u201d songs, which can be found on basically any other compilation with songs by this band. It probably would have been a better idea to put the \u201cHoly Diver\u201d title song first since it has that extended keyboard intro, but most tend to be familiar with the straightforward crowd pleaser \u201cRainbow In The Dark\u201d so it\u2019s not the worst song to put at the beginning. Then we get a really random back and forth between the Vivian Campbell\u2019s pinch harmonic drenched mayhem and fill happy riffing in \u201cEvil Eyes\u201d and \u201cThe Last In Line\u201d and Craig Goldie\u2019s catchy minimalist riffing and expressive lead guitar storytelling in \u201cNight People\u201d and \u201cDream Evil\u201d. \n\nOne thing that I will definitely say to this album\u2019s credit is that they had the good sense not to just throw in a few token songs from Craig Goldie\u2019s and Tracey G\u2019s contributions to the Dio franchise and give the Campbell years their 6th time at the helm on a Dio compilation. Say what you will for the peculiarity of the song\u2019s title, \u201cSunset Superman\u201d is a brilliant riff monster with an excellent keyboard performance out of Claude at the beginning. Likewise, \u201cEvilution\u201d and \u201cHollywood Black\u201d run parallel to the dark Doom landscapes of \u201cDehumanizer\u201d, though Tracey G\u2019s lead playing tendencies go a little bit more towards Vivian Campbell. \n\nUltimately this is not worth seeking, the only reason I can think of why anyone would is because they\u2019ve only got $6 to their name, which begs the question of how they scraped together the money to get a CD player. Every song on here is a classic, but they do not paint an accurate picture of how Ronnie Dio evolved as a musician and composer in the way they are presented here. The content in the booklet is also woefully brief and unhelpful, reading like an over-generalized middle school textbook summary of a man whose career and exploits could fill the encyclopedia Britannica. In 2002 Dio killed the dragon, and in 2005 it resurrected to taunt our beloved hero once again.

        "\nThis little piece of bargain bin fool\u2019s gold was one of very few that I actually didn\u2019t purchase at my local farmer\u2019s market, but instead happened upon by chance at my nearest Walmart while shopping for some cheap items to keep those poor 3rd world child laborers in pocket change. Essentially when these super stores have trouble offloading their various compilation albums that nobody seems to want, they start a bin outside of the electronics section and pile the suckers in a rectangular bin with a nice little $3 a piece sign in the center. My curiosity brought me in contact with a couple of Dio compilations, of which this one was the truest to the concept of a \u201cBest Of\u201d collections.\n\nEssentially this album serves the purpose that \u201cDiamonds - The Best Of Dio\u201d would have if it had been released in the USA. It is basically dominated by Vivian Campbell era songs, although there is a much greater concentration of \u201cHoly Diver\u201d and \u201cSacred Heart\u201d songs, which give this album a really uneven feel if listened to straight through due to the radical shift from an aggressive form of early 80s heavy metal to a much tamer and keyboard oriented one in the mid-80s. Coupled with the fact that most of the songs selected from the latter of these two albums, along with a couple of selections from the one that preceded and the one that followed it such as \u201cI Could Have Been A Dreamer\u201d and \u201cMystery\u201d, this album is definitely tilted in a commercial direction. \n\nNow, a commercial direction works quite well if you\u2019re goal is a best of album, but then we have to account for the token songs from the 1990s \u201cLock Up The Wolves\u201d and \u201cStrange Highways\u201d, which are pretty dark and morbid sounding in comparison to the bulk of this album\u2019s contents. The cognitive dissonance that would result from a newcomer to Dio hearing this album is sure to be pretty strong, which leaves on wondering if maybe the purpose of this is to appeal to fans of the band who might be looking for a rarity or two. Unfortunately, all we are given is the live performance of \u201cMan On The Silver Mountain\u201d off the \u201cIntermission\u2019 EP that was the first to feature Craig Goldie. It\u2019s a pretty interesting reinterpretation of the song, being much faster in tempo than the original Rainbow version, but aside from some wilder soloing, isn\u2019t terribly different. If maybe they\u2019d put in something like \u201cHide In The Rainbow\u201d or \u201cTime To Burn\u201d, which never made it onto any of the first 4 albums, it would be more worthy of a purchase.\n\nUltimately the only thing that is really great about this if you look at it from the standpoint of it being introductory material for Dio newcomers is the booklet insert. It\u2019s loaded with information about how each of these songs came about and elucidates the nature of this band\u2019s glory days in the 80s quite well. This might be worth getting if you can find it at the low as hell price I found it at and if you don\u2019t yet have the money to start investing in the band\u2019s studio offerings yet, but there are better compilations out there that give you much more bang for your buck, especially if you want to learn more about the band beyond their most mainstream of releases.\n\nOriginally submitted to (www.metal-observer.com) on April 22, 2009.\n",
        "\nThe trend of bands performing entire albums in concert seems to be pretty popular these days (I have Jethro Tull\u2019s \u201cAqualung Live\u201d and 2 out of 3 of Dream Theater\u2019s \u201cOfficial Bootleg\u201d series), and Dio continues it with this 2-disc set where every song from \u201cHoly Diver\u201d is performed.\n\nDio\u2019s voice has its ups and downs. He\u2019s awfully hoarse on some songs on the first disc (the title track especially), but he\u2019s awesome on others (especially when you remember he\u2019s over 60. The band is in fine form throughout, with \u201cGypsy\u201d and \u201cShame on the Night\u201d containing drum and guitar solos, respectively, which are lengthy but remain interesting throughout. Disc 2 was my favorite part; it contains two songs from Dio\u2019s sophomore effort \u201cThe Last in Line\u201d, as well as covers from his stints with Rainbow and Black Sabbath. Another part I enjoyed was the end of the song \u201cGypsy\u201d after the drum solo; a pre-recorded version of Holst\u2019s \u201cJupiter, the Bringer of Jollity\u201d bursts out and the drummer plays along with it. It has to be one of the silliest moments in metal that I\u2019ve ever experienced, but I love silliness in metal so it\u2019s all fine with me. This wouldn\u2019t be the best place to start with Dio (stick to the original Holy Diver for that), but fans of his work will enjoy this album.\n\nOriginally posted at metal-jerks.com\n",
        "\nOne more Dio album suffering from the same problem all his other ones suffer from: the lack of variety. All the songs are too damn similar, following simple and overused structures (verse, chorus, verse, chorus, solo, chorus). On the other hand, Dio's vocals here are exceptional, very strong and powerful. He really adds something to the tunes, with his fantastic voice.\n\nAnyways, individually, there are not many stand-outs present here. I guess \u201cAll the Fools Sailed Away\u201d is the best song, being just a little bit more elaborated than the other songs. A decent ballad, at the end of the day. \u201cNight People\u201d is a good opener, great main riff. In fact, there are some worth listening riffs on the album, the title track has plenty of them now that I think of it. When the fifth track, \u201cNaked in the Rain\u201d kicks in, you'll probably want to stop listening to Dream Evil though, since this tune is more of the same. The same old chorus, the recycled riffs, etc, etc... The next four songs are very weak and basically... more of the same. Really, this album is just a mixture of songs that sound all the same. Please, we want variety. Production-wise, this album is almost flawless, great mixing with the keyboard playing adding a nice atmosphere to the whole record. The drums also sound great, despite the drum performance being a bit on the average side.\n\nSo, a pretty bad album, all in all. Still, there are some highlights and average songs, but I won't recommend this to anyone. Meh, if you're a big fan of Dio's work, I guess you'll enjoy this album, otherwise forget it. Imagine Holy Diver or Last in Line with weaker songs and you get a nice mental picture of what this piece is.\n\nBest Moments of the CD:\n-the beginning of the album, perhaps.\n\nPS. the artwork rules!\n",
        "\nDio, being the legend that he is in the Rock and Metal scenes, needs no introduction, and this, his fourth solo album, shouldn't need one, either. This was the first album without guitar virtuoso Vivian Campbell backing our favorite metal dwarf up, and here was ushered in Craig Goldie, who is no slouch on the strings himself. Fans of the previous Dio albums (and even his work with Rainbow and Black Sabbath) won't be disappointed by this one, as it is more of the same rockish, melodic Heavy Metal that the metal world had come to expect from Ronnie James Dio. His raspy wailing is in fine shape here, and he's backed up by acrobatic guitarwork and perky, upbeat drumming that makes this a very \"alive\" album. It does not offer anything really new to the standard Dio sound base, but that isn't what Dio was about in the 80s - he was just about making good, solid Heavy Metal to headbang to.\n\nThe material here is still very Hard Rockish, with a distinct synth presence, some vocal layering and a nice, laid back sort of groove, but that doesn't change the fact that the riffs here just rule. \"Night People,\" the creepy, atmospheric title track, the anthemic \"Sunset Superman,\" album highlight \"All the Fools Sailed Away,\" with its epic overtones and buildup, the groovy \"Overlove,\" which packs the best guitar solo here, and the excellent, catchy \"When a Woman Cries,\" which ends the album with a classy Hard Rock organ and a great riff. There's no excuse for not liking this one if you're a fan of Heavy Metal in the slightest. Mandatory.\n\nOriginally written for http://www.metalcrypt.com\n",
        "\nDIO's 1993 release \"Strange Highways\" is a real oddball in the bands back catalogue. All the previous efforts were straightforward heavy metal records with little in the way of surprises. This album must have startled a lot of fans when it was released. They were expecting another 'Holy Diver' or 'Dream Evil', but instead got a mixture of Black Sabbaths 'Dehumanizer' (featuring Ronnie James Dio of course), and Doom Metal.\n\nThe first noticeable point when playing this album for the first time is that the production of this record is massive. Turning up the stereo reveals a huge deep drum sound, which is nice and natural. The guitar sound is absolutely fantastic with much more gain than on previous DIO efforts, and fabulous tone. I was so impressed that I actually emailed Tracy G a couple of years ago to ask what gear he used on the album (Randall and Marshall Heads, an old Strat type guitar made by a friend of his, and a Boss Overdrive pedal). A great example of the heavyness of the guitars can be heard in the intro of the title track 'Strange Highways' with lovely open power chords. The guitar playing of Tracy G is unique and quite unlike any of the other DIO axe slingers. There is lots of use of the whammy bar and pinched harmonics. The solos tend not to be particularly fast, but then the music isn't. I think they are well written and memorable but I know plenty of people who dislike G's playing intently so it is best to judge for yourself. Ronnie sounds like he has come from hell, and I mean that in a good way! I have never heard as much aggression from his voice as on this album and there is loads of grit in his voice. \n\nThe songs on this album are generally mid to slow tempo, apart from the opener 'Jesus, Mary and the holy ghost' and 'Here's to you'. The choruses of the songs tend not to be as catchy as previous efforts, but this is no bad thing. Ronnie is playing a different game here. The songs are deep, dark and disturbing with sinister lyrics. 'Evilution' and 'Pain' are a good example of the sludgy, doom laden material that represents 'Strange Highways'. I can't over emphasize just how cold and dark this album is. \n\nI need to mention the album sleeve. Whilst the cover is quite good, the booklet is a joke. It consists of just 4 pages with no lyrics. Definitely one of the worst booklets I have come across.\n\nTo anyone thinking of buying this album, I would give it my full recommendation. If you dislike DIOs most well known 80s works, then give this a try as it is poles apart. If you love 'Holy Diver' etc, then be prepared for something a lot different! Personally, 'Strange Highways' is one of my 'Desert Island Discs'. Brilliant.\n",
        "\nI'm really amazed with the amount of positive reviews and with the average rating of this piece. Don't get me wrong, I really like this record, it probably is the best one Dio ever made (I don't have all his discography, so I can't say yet if it is his best or not) and it features some nice performances (everyone knows that Dio is a great vocalist and he quite possibly reaches his top with Holy Diver). So, why this record doesn't get a 95% or a 98% for me?\n\nWell, the reason is: the little variety. Unfortunately for Dio, that's one of the things I praise the most and this records lacks it and lacks it badly. Surely there are differences between the songs and you can distinguish easily one from another; but all of them follow some what similar structures and there is too much focus on the choruses. Now, the focus on the choruses isn't necessarily a bad thing; one song here and there featuring a powerful chorus is always a pleasant thing to hear. But a completely different thing is creating a record made entirely of straight-forward songs and there are few bands out there that manage to keep the integrity and the quality within those albums. As you can see, catchiness is a thing that you must use but not abuse, as it can, at the same time, bring your album up to the skies or bring it down, powerfully, to the ground.\n\nBut when this album is good, it is really, really AMAZING. Stand Up and Shout is a fantastic opener, being an early speed metal number, probably the faster song Dio ever released. The chorus is also fantastic (\u201cstand up and SHOUT... LET IT OUUT!!\u201d) and catchy, the intense drumming driving very well the song too. The title track is another highlight, a metal classic with a great main riff, courtesy of Vivian Campbell. After Dio, Vivian delivers the best performance here, his riffs and solos complementing perfectly the lines played by the other musicians. There is also an interesting use of keyboards (by Jimmy Bain and Ronnie Dio) and it works especially well with Rainbow in the Dark, which benefits from that unforgettable keyboard riff. Don't Talk to Strangers probably is my personal favourite here, mainly because it manages to be somewhat different from the other tunes: it begins very calmly, with those fantastic lyrics and then explodes into a mid-paced, heavier part, it is simply great. Invisible is also cool, mainly because of the guitar work.\n\nSo, after all, you might enjoy this record if you like straight forward metal with some nice, over-the-top vocals and guitars. The drums are not very creative, but still decent and precise, with Vinnie Appice being the sticksman. Anyway, there are some really good tracks here, like the ones I mentioned above, but all the other ones are very average and too focused on the vocals and choruses. Remember one thing: you need more than a good vocal performance to make a masterpiece.\n\nDespite all of my critics, Holy Diver is a very enjoyable album, but, as you can see, not the masterpiece that many claim it is. I wrote this review with that exact purpose, to show you that a masterpiece this isn't. If you also need an introduction to Dio try this, as it manages to be a lot more solid than its sucessor, The Last in Line. \n\nBest Moments of the CD:\n-the ending of Stand Up and Shout.\n-the real beginning of the title track (after that, a bit overlong, intro).\n-the build-up of Don't Talk to Strangers.\n-the keyboard parts of Rainbow in the Dark.\n\n\u201cDon't dream of women 'cause they only bring you... DOOOOWN!\u201d\n",
        "\nWhy Dio's solo band is so praised by the metal community, remains a mystery to me. Sure, I like this album and Holy Diver as well, but I can't understand why are those records hailed as absolute masterpieces of heavy metal. I really can't. Anyways, The Last in Line is a solid record, containing 9 typical heavy metal tunes. In fact, all the elements that made heavy metal what it is are present here: the stunning vocals, the astounding guitar solos, the heavy riffs and the catchy drum lines (plus the inaudible bass, but oh well...). \n\nRonnie Dio is, obviously, the man of the album. His extraordinary vocal approach absolutely dominates this record. From the screams of We Rock to the over-the-top chorus of Egypt (\u201cthe chains are ooooooooooooooooooooooon\u201d), The Last in Line proves that he was here to stay. In fact, he was absolutely reaching his peak by 1984, with a successful solo debut already released and with his past works with Sabbath and Rainbow still in the mind of many people.\n\nThe true pearl of this album is the title track, which is not only the best song of the album, but the BEST song ever sung by Dio (yes, I'm looking at you Heaven and Hell). It begins calmly but then becomes heavier and heavier, until Dio screams and the song turns into a bone-crushing, mid-paced number. The chorus is extremely well written and catchy and everytime I listen to the song I think that it is longer than what it really is; in fact, it carries a fantastic epic atmosphere that grabs you and doesn't let you go. Egypt (the Chains are On) is another epic song, but not as good as the title track. Nevertheless, the beginning is quite interesting, with some Egyptian influenced guitar lines and the solos are quite nice.\n\nThis brings me to another important element of the record: the guitar work. Where would heavy metal be without a good guitar riff? That's right and this record has plenty of them, courtesy of the awesome Vivian Campbell. We Rock is an example of his technical proficiency. While not as good as the explosive Holy Diver opener, Stand up and Shout, this track can be considered an early speed metal take, a song authentically made for the crowd interaction (yes, the live version of this song is even better than the studio version, so go get it!). I Speed at Night is probably even faster than We Rock and is an authentic forgotten classic, with that anthemic chorus (\u201cI just come seeking pleasure, I hate the light, I SPEED AT NIGHT... AT NIIIIIIGHT\u201d) and the powerful, fierce drum work, courtesy of the ex-Black Sabbath drummer Vinnie Appice.\n\nAbout all the other songs, there are not too many highlights here... Breathless is a typical Dio song, an average number. The same thing with Evil Eyes. Eat Your Heart Out is very forgettable, probably the worst tune of the bunch. However, there's something all the songs of this piece share: the catchiness. Every chorus will remain in your head for weeks which is a good thing, obviously, since it provides a certain durability to the whole listening experience.\n\nConcluding, the vocals and the guitar work, allied with the overall catchiness, are the most important elements of this album. Absolutely worth getting, especially if you are a fan of Dio's past work. However, if you are seeking for an introduction to his efforts, try Holy Diver: it is much more consistent and, in overall, has better songs. Nevertheless, worth getting.\n\nBest Moments of the CD:\n-the explosive beginning of We Rock.\n-the ending of The Last in Line,\n-the ending of I Speed at Night.\n-the first section of Egypt, with those fantastic oriental melodies.\n",
        "\nFirst of all, Dio is one of the most innovative, and recognized metal icons the world has ever known. \n\nGypsy: An excellent rocking song, along the vein of ACDC's Back in Black. A good riff, but the lyrics are not as good as some of the other songs that are on the full length, notably the title track, and lyrically probably one of my favorite tracks on Holy Diver; Don't Talk To Strangers. The solo isn't as good as it probably could've been, there really isn't much to this song, it's just a rockin' early 80's metal song. \n\nRainbow in the Dark: This is one of my all-time favorite metal songs ever. It's the epitome of metal; the killer riff...the amazing vocals, the synth. The amazing solo in the middle of the song. There is nothing lacking in this song. I bang my neck to this song so hard. Just when each verse starts and there's that pause....and then WHAM! the crash of the symbols, the breakdown on the drums....and then that riff starts all over again, and it's just perfect. The song crescendos to a shredding riff about 3 minutes in, and then a reprise of the first verse with a little more gusto....the song climaxes, and when begins to fade out.........it leaves any normal metal maniac scrambling for the rewind button to hear that amazing, fucking kick-ass song again!\n",
        "\nFor those of you out there who are learning to play guitar and are looking to start up and band and play gigs, or have already done so and have a few under your belt, there has likely always been that annoying person who always asks you to \u201cPlay Free Bird!\u201d. Personally I\u2019m not one to hate on a bunch of good old boys from the South who could appreciate a good long guitar solo, but there is more to rock music than just that damned song. Likewise, my biggest pet peeve about all of the live Dio releases coming out of late is that they all feature the obligatory classics.\n\nIf I had a dollar for every person who has said or written that \u201cHoly Diver\u201d was Dio\u2019s greatest album outside of Rainbow and Sabbath I could probably retire from giving guitar lessons and buy up all the studios controlled by the RIAA. It is blatantly untrue and most people who believe it haven\u2019t heard more than 2 or 3 Dio albums, one of which was probably one of Dio\u2019s later albums which are obviously shrugged off for not having the age factor on their side. Unfortunately, one of those people who believe this has not only heard all of Dio\u2019s albums, but actually created them all.\n\nRonnie has an attachment to Holy Diver mostly because it was his first effort as an independent producer who basically ran the whole show. While I can appreciate the empowerment that comes with being able to call the shots and not have to answer to some non-member of the band while in the studio, this does not make Holy Diver a superior album. Musically and lyrically it was fairly primitive compared to lyrically ambitious and sadly misunderstood releases like \u201cDream Evil\u201d and \u201cLock up the Wolves\u201d. I love the album, I listen to it frequently, but it is way overplayed and extremely overrated.\n\nSo we thus have another live performance of Holy Diver, which happens to have coincided with the re-release on DVD of the first two Dio tours with Vivian Campbell, both of which feature several of the same songs. If there is a silver lining into what is otherwise more of the same yet again, it is that Doug Aldrich, who lit up the stage during the \u201cKilling the Dragon\u201d tour, plays circles around everyone else who has every performed these songs. Peoples\u2019 jaws may drop when they hear the original recordings of the solos to these songs, but believe it or not, what is heard on here is twice as intense and technically extravagant than anything Vivian Campbell every could rip out, and in this case we also don\u2019t have to watch a tense shouldered statue attempt to look like he\u2019s in the zone while playing them.\n\nIn fact, if one went solely by the musicianship on display here and tuned out the fact that these songs have been played to death, this lineup of Dio is the best one to ever play live. Rudy Sarzo just flows up and down each bass string effortlessly and is even more animated on stage than Ronnie himself (though he\u2019s probably at least 15 years younger). Simon Wright makes a hell of a racket throughout the whole performance and Scott Warren is so animated behind that keyboard that I almost wish that Dio would let the guy use a keytar, despite how goofy it would probably look.\n\nAs far as standout performances go, \u201cGates of Babylon\u201d and \u201cSign of the Southern Cross\u201d are the best solely because they sound fresh for having not been heard several hundred times live. Scott Warren completely nails the beginning keyboard solo in the former, and although the latter doesn\u2019t have the serene acoustic intro, the atmosphere and Ronnie\u2019s vocals are incredible. \u201cOne Night in the City\u201d and \u201cWe Rock\u201d are also extremely well realized, specifically during the solos where Doug Aldrich takes a pair of rather short and dry lead breaks and turns them into high frequency, ultra-climactic wonders. I could make a strong case that Doug Aldrich is the guitar player that Vivian Campbell could\u2019ve and should\u2019ve been had he gotten over his own ego and personal insecurities as a musician.\n\nThis is a good performance, even a great performance, but I really wish that Ronnie would start putting some different songs into his set lists. Instead of playing his Rainbow stuff, he should take at least one or two songs from the \u201cSacred Heart\u201d and \u201cDream Evil\u201d albums, which are both excellent and have songs in need of more attention. If you\u2019ve heard or seen the Killing the Dragon tour live Dio releases, you\u2019ll probably like this. Dio\u2019s been around for quite a long time and he still gets the job done live with seemingly little effort, and I am hopeful that after Heaven and Hell does their album and tour that Dio will revisit it\u2019s later 80s material on their next tour.\n",
        "\nClassic 80s heavy metal albums tend to be overrated beyond belief. I could list a ton of examples here (including many that\u2019d put me on many metalhead\u2019s death-lists) but I\u2019ll refrain from that, you get the picture. \nOverrated is a word that doesn\u2019t quite fit to an album titled \u201cHoly Diver\u201d. It really does fill the shoes it\u2019s usually placed in and therefore \u201cHoly Diver\u201d is a landmark in heavy metal history. Dio has just left Black Sabbath after the release of \u201cMob Rules\u201d and gathered soon-to-be guitar legend Vivian Campbell, Rainbow-bassist Jimmy Bain and now also ex-Sabbath drummer Vinnie Appice around him to record a truly legendary album. \n\nBoth Jimmy Bain and Vinnie Appice deliver good performances on bass and drums, especially the latter does make \u201cHoly Diver\u201d quite a bit more technically demanding, compared to Sabbath\u2019s output around that time. Vivian Campbell is an excellent guitarist and while he\u2019d hit his peak on the next album, he already shows a lot of flashing talent on here. \n\nThe album kicks off with the fast rocker anthem \u201cStand up and Shout\u201d. It\u2019s almost speed-metal in execution and Dio\u2019s aggressive delivery makes this one a winner. Not my favorite song on the album by a long shot, but it definitely has the right power to be the opening track. \n\nNow of course I have to devote an entire paragraph to the hymn that is the title track. Many fans see this track as the highlight of Dio\u2019s entire career and I can clearly understand why. The slow synth-intro is probably skip-worthy after the thousandth listen, but the great main riff that opens the track is what truly makes this one a stand out. It\u2019s heavy and has balls the size of Jupiter. Of course, when Dio\u2019s voice kicks in, the aforementioned balls don\u2019t even fit into this galaxy anymore. Definitely one of the strongest songs he has ever done vocal-wise and the lyrics are in the same league. Dio has always been a great writer, but the lyrics on this album are almost out of this world. One thing that I have to point out though is the guitar solo, which could have been greater than it is. Don\u2019t me wrong, it\u2019s a good solo, but it doesn\u2019t quite match the level of all other elements in this track. \n\nFortunately, the album doesn\u2019t end here (some people seem to remember the title track, but nothing else). \u201cGypsy\u201d is one of the lesser songs on the album, but it\u2019s worthy nonetheless. It focuses more on a rather strange vocal performance (\u201cI\u2019m riiiiiding on the gypsy, the gypsy queeeeen\u201d) by Dio instead of riffs and we all know that this is never a good sign in this genre (even in Dio\u2019s case). Still, it\u2019s quite catchy and I wouldn\u2019t call this filler by a long shot. \n\nAfter this, the album reaches its peak by having 3 total winners in a row. \u201cCaught in the Middle\u201d, \u201cDon\u2019t Talk to Strangers\u201d and \u201cStraight Through the Heart\u201d are all awesome rockers (\u201cDon\u2019t Talk to Strangers\u201d has an awesome ballad-esque part as well) with lots of riffs, great vocal lines and awesome solos all over the place. Especially the first two of the mentioned tracks are at least equal to the title track, contrary to popular opinion. To me, these three tracks are the core and the overall highlight of the album.\n\nAfter that, the album does not reach that level of excellence again as \u201cInvisible\u201d and \u201cRainbow in the Dark\u201d are a tad unspectacular (apart from Dio\u2019s vocals, which do fire up the songs quite a bit) and the closer \u201cShame on the Night\u201d does plods a little in the verses. \n\nOverall though, \u201cHoly Diver\u201d is a classic heavy metal record and despite my few minor gripes, this is an essential listen for all fans of metal, hard rock or music in general. Heavy metal doesn\u2019t get much better than this, and said album is definitely one of the best in Dio\u2019s lengthy career. \n\nHighlights: Holy Diver, Caught in the Middle, Don\u2019t Talk to Strangers\n",
        "\nOn his course through the 90s, Ronnie James Dio has lost a rather large group fans. People didn\u2019t like his more experimental, and dare I say it, modern side he had adopted back in 1994 with the release of \u201cStrange Highways\u201d and which he further developed in succeeding albums. In \u201cAngry Machines\u201d, we heard Dio dwell in a sludgy, bottom-heavy grounds and even Magica was still caught in the web of this modern approach. While I\u2019m actually one of those people who think that Dio can do no wrong, I still very much embraced the return to the Dio of old with \u201cKilling the Dragon\u201d. This is one of those few albums where the \u201cback-to-the-roots\u201d term can actually be used in the appropriate sense.\n\nThe album kicks off with the mighty title track, which might actually one of the highlights in Dio\u2019s career. Driven by an almost Maiden-ish galloping main riff, Dio soars his way through the track (fuck, this man was 60 years old when this was released! Unbelievable) and gives one of the best performances in years. The lead guitar playing (courtesy of Doug Aldrich, definitely the most proficient guitar player that Ronnie ever had) is stunning, boasting with lots of emotion instead of a bazillion notes played randomly on the fretboard. Definitely one of the heaviest tracks in Dio\u2019s long career. \n\nOf course there are more killer tracks on this album; \u201cPush\u201d is another one of those awesome up-tempo rockers that just kick ass. Very uplifting lyrically, Dio shines again, providing an awesome vocal line for the intriguing chorus. \u201cThrow Away Children\u201d changes the pace & lyrical direction radically. It almost sounds like a \u201cDehumanizer\u201d leftover, but might be even more effective due to the very dark lyrical output. \u201cGuilty\u201d is a track for the true oldschool Dio fan \u2013 if the production was a tad aged, this wouldn\u2019t have been out of place on \u201cThe Last In Line\u201d, as it more than loosely resembles the melodic heavy metal ideas of songs like \u201cBreathless\u201d or \u201cEvil Eyes\u201d on said album. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t say that there is any filler material on here, but not everything is flawless on this record. \u201cAlong Comes a Spider\u201d and \u201cRock & Roll\u201d seem to lack direction as they (especially the latter) drag on for too long without any real highlights and the song-structures seem too predictable for repeated listening pleasure. \n\nApart from those two tracks, there is no real weakness to be found on this record and Ronnie James Dio proves again what he\u2019s capable of. Even today, he\u2019s still showing the youngsters how it\u2019s done. A recommended, no wait, a must-have (!) album for all fans of Dio, or heavy metal in general. \n\nHighlights: Killing the Dragon, Push, Throwaway Children, Guilty\n",
        "\nDio has been at it for a long time, putting out 10 full length studio albums in just over 20 years and putting on hundreds of concerts for thousands upon thousands of fans. Through it all, there has always been the ever-present \u201cHoly Diver\u201d album, which is the origin of the beast that we all know as Dio. \u201cWe Rock\u201d features the first 2 of Dio\u2019s many concerts on home video, 2 shows which have been out of print for quite a long time and are now available in a non-obsolete format.\n\nThe concerts themselves are loaded with plenty of treats for the eyes and ears. The Holland show features the band in a humbler format, with only a simple medieval castle structure for a stage visual and four musicians of the highest caliber putting forth an amazing show. The Philadelphia show reveals a much more elaborate tendency in the Dio experience with hydraulics controlled 3 headed cobras, miniature sphinxes, and an elaborate light show to complement an already elaborate and heavy set of timeless metal anthems. Those interested in further details on the contents of these performances are also encouraged to read my reviews of the VHS releases.\n\nAlthough the concerts are an absolute necessity, the true charm of this DVD re-release is the recent interview with Ronnie about the origin of the band and the history behind the timeless \u201cHoly Diver\u201d album. In it, he answers all the frequently asked questions associated with it: how did you look for musicians? What was that unusual method that you applied to the recording of the drums? Why is the album art the way it is? Why are your lyrics mostly fantasy based? Pretty much every question that you can imagine is covered. Through it all, you behold a humble man with a persona that is in direct contradiction to the bum rap that he\u2019s been given by some in the media as some sort of egotistical, evil little dwarf with a bad case of napoleon complex. For those of us who have seen him live and met him in person, the smell of bullshit is obvious, but for the rest of you, the interview speaks for itself.\n\nFans of Dio are requested, entreated, and hopefully persuaded to pick this up. If you buy one Dio performance on DVD, this is the one to get. I prefer the \u201cSacred Heart\u201d video myself because I like Craig Goldie better as a musician and a live performer. But this doesn\u2019t mean to downplay the obvious talent that Vivian Campbell has, a talent that both Ronnie and I can give credit where credit is due for, even and despite Vivian\u2019s lousy attitude towards the band that made his career.\n",
        "\nAlthough Ronnie Dio was already a rather well established force in the musical realm, when compared to his later tours, the original Holy Diver tour was quite a humble endeavor. The stage make-up is a simple gothic castle looking arrangement with no laser shows, moving monsters or knights, or any of the high budget marvels that painted the visual presentation of the \u201cLast in Line\u201d and \u201cSacred Heart\u201d tours. But in spite of the lack of a Hollywood looking performance, the sounds that are put forth match and sometimes surpass later live efforts.\n\nFor Dio purists, Holy Diver will always remain the crowning achievement of Ronnie\u2019s career outside of Sabbath and Rainbow, but for me it was the part of the rocket that gets out of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. It\u2019s probably not the best analogy because I don\u2019t think any Dio concert would be complete without a solid showing from his amazing debut, but the stuff on this album gets way too much attention at the expense of everything else. As such, I don\u2019t hold this concert with the same dogmatic reverence that many do, and don\u2019t like it any better or worse than all the other concerts he put to video.\n\nAs was the case with the Philadelphia video of \u201cThe Last in Line\u201d tour, Vivian Campbell is as stiff as Lurch on stage. Even in comparison to Tony Iommi, who is not animated at all on stage but at least plays like he means it, Vivian just looks like he isn\u2019t feeling it the way the other 3 are. He plays well, ripping out his signature solos from \u201cRainbow in the Dark\u201d and \u201cStraight through the Heart\u201d with a few innovative ad lib moments, but basically stands back and lets the other members work on getting the crowd jazzed up. \n\nThe two best performances on here are \u201cStraight though the Heart\u201d and \u201cChildren of the Sea\u201d. The old Sabbath classic just never fails whenever it\u2019s played, and on this particular performance Ronnie\u2019s voice is still capable of singing that soft intro without sounding gravely. The solid rocking riff monster from Holy Diver \u201cStraight through the Heart\u201d is always a hit live, no matter who plays it, but Vivian handles it the best, save Doug Aldrich\u2019s insane interpretation of it in more recent times. But the whole concert really is one big highlight in the long line of concerts on video in the metal world.\n\nMy closing thoughts on this performance is merely this; this was Ronnie\u2019s first test as a leader outside of an already established fold of musicians and he hit it clear out of the park. Even without the fancy stage show he owns the audience and brings them tenfold their money\u2019s worth. It\u2019s bitter sweet to see him and Vivian on stage together and actually acting as the friends that they once were. Vivian was nothing before he hooked up with Dio, and he went back to that when he left, and the unfortunate truth is that for the past 15 years or so the nothings of the music world are given a bigger platform than the kings of the art. Nonetheless, unaligned fans of Dio\u2019s music, along with all the others are encouraged to pick this up along with the Philadelphia \u201cLast in Line\u201d concert on the 2005 DVD release \u201cWe Rock\u201d.\n",
        "\nBack in the dark ages when metal was still about big hair and the thrash scene was mostly an underground beast, Dio was bringing great music to the masses in the same general fashion that he did while with Black Sabbath. The songs are complex yet memorable, all 5 musicians are animated and constantly pumping up the audience, and Ronnie is smiling the whole way through in that classic \u201cI like my audience so I won\u2019t do something stupid like look down at my shoes and act like I\u2019m pissed at the world or anything else grunge related. Dio\u2019s showmanship is in direct contradiction to the general 90s sentiment that a musician should simply \u201cbe themselves\u201d. \n\nWhenever someone suggests that musicians such as Dio, Kiss and all the others who put forth elaborate productions are fakes because they aren\u2019t themselves, I like to refer them to a classic 80s move called The Heavenly Kid. In a particular scene, a geeky kid who is getting help from dead father on how to be cool comes out of the dressing room in a fairly stylish outfit, but wonders if the outfit is really him. His father/guardian angel answers the question by saying \u201cYou want to be you? O.K.\u201d, and then snaps his fingers and instantaneously the geeky kid has absolutely nothing on in the middle of a department store. The kid immediately changes his mind and says over and over that he likes it until the outfit is back on him, definitely a golden moment. It\u2019s too bad that no one had the nerve to explain to the emperor of grunge that he had no clothes.\n\nBut I\u2019m digressing, the general point is that the show on here is elaborate, and the intricacy of it all is very purposeful. The hydraulics controlled 3 headed cobra, the miniature replicas of the sphinxes, and the pyramid construction of the stage all tie in heavily with the largeness of the album that Dio is touring on, \u201cThe Last in Line\u201d. And of course, the performance backs up all of the fancy stage props, particularly in the case of Ronnie and the others. The only real flaw in the stage show is that Vivian Campbell looks like the upper half of his body is made of stone. He plays the solos well enough and doesn\u2019t miss a single note in a single riff, but even the drummer Vinnie Appice looks more animated than he does.\n\nThe highlight of this show is the medley that extends from \u201cEgypt (The Chains are On)\u201d all the way to the end of the second reprise of \u201cHeaven and Hell\u201d, which occurs after \u201cThe Last in Line\u201d. On most of Dio\u2019s live releases the medleys are the low point because they often slash important parts of the songs, particularly the climactic ending of \u201cHeaven and Hell\u201d. But on this particular medley all of the parts are brought out and played a little bit faster than usual, but flawlessly.\n\nAlthough a rarity that is not readily available in VHS format anymore, this concert can be seen on the 2005 DVD release \u201cWe Rock\u201d, which also has the concert in Holland with all the Holy Diver stuff. The only drawback is that they cut the show opener \u201cStand up and Shout\u201d, but you get the Holland version of that in the other portion of the DVD so it\u2019s a small loss. Rabid fans of Vivian Campbell will be the most interested in this, but in actuality, this is something that ever Dio fan should have in their collection.\n",
        "\nIf I had to pick the one song that fully summed up the epic nature of Dio\u2019s music, the one song that truly captured the spirit of his lyric writing genius, \u201cThe Last in Line\u201d is most obvious choice. It takes the general idea of a slow quiet intro leading into a triumphant epic that started with Sabbath\u2019s \u201cChildren of the Sea\u201d and morphs it into something that is a little bit more riff happy, quite a bit more technically ambitious, and lyrically just slightly more rich in classic RJD metaphorical lingo.\n\nThe music video that accompanied it was indicative of the lack of cohesion between lyrical subject matter and video plotlines. The first impression that came to me when I read the words was a group of brave yet desperate warriors off to some mystic who would give them a special kind of power to defeat some terrible foe. When I saw the 1984 style totalitarian society with cyborg men herding youths like cattle, Vivian Campbell ripping out the solo while providing electricity to some sort of shock treatment device that is torturing two hapless victims (an accurate image of what his playing of late does to his former fans from his Dio days), and RJD saving the day with sword in hand.\n\nAnd if there was ever a song that underscored the tragedy of how Vivian Campbell\u2019s current outlook on guitar playing is, it can be heard in this song. The guitar solo to this astounding number is an achievement above and beyond what most at that time were doing. He constantly griped on and on about how he was under pressure to write something like Malmsteen, but when you compare how many people remember Yngwie\u2019s most famous solo \u201cBlack Star\u201d versus how many remember this solo, it\u2019s pressure that only existed in his own mind. I can\u2019t watch or read interviews with Vivian anymore; I just blast out this solo and forget that a few years after this he morphed into a complete cynical asshole.\n\nThe b-side of the single I have contains \u201cOne Night in the City\u201d, another epic classic from the same LP featuring some top quality riff work and a short, yet once again memorable solo. The lyrics tell sort of an original story of two lovers from opposite sides of the social spectrum and how they essentially abandon all that they have for each other. It\u2019s difficult to fully ascertain the meanings of some of Dio\u2019s songs because his metaphors can often mean 3 or 4 different things, although certain songs are more obvious than others.\n\nThis is definitely a collector\u2019s item for the insane Dio worshipper; I managed to pick this up out of bargain bin for 50 cents a few years ago and just found it laying around. Sadly I\u2019ve lost the album art, which is really nothing more than a different angle on the art for the \u201cLast in Line\u201d LP. Non-insane people, ergo people other than me, without any money to waste are advised to simply pick up that full length album and be thankful for it.\n",
        "\nAlthough more known as the epic composer who co-wrote Sabbath sagas such as \u201cChildren of the Sea\u201d and \u201cSign of the Southern Cross\u201d, Dio was known for occasionally writing something straightforward and, heaven forbid, radio friendly. At least for the year 1984, this was something that you would likely catch on a rock station along with other memorable mainstays like \u201cRainbow in the Dark\u201d and \u201cStand up and Shout\u201d, although the keyboard parts make it a bit fluffier.\n\n\u201cMystery\u201d carries all the usual poetic trappings that most of Dio\u2019s song writing contains. He has been known to occasionally write something that is a bit too clich\u00e9 to match his usual metaphorical stints. But behind the rhyme schemed philosophizing is a very standard set of riffs, almost as simplistic as repetitive early Zepplin songs like \u201cWhole Lotta Love\u201d or \u201cDazed and Confused\u201d. \n\n\u201cEat your heart out\u201d is the mirror opposite of the song before it, having a fairly intricate set of riffs and variations upon them, but lyrically being quasi-comical. The guitar solo is mostly played note for note from the original version, including the descending trill line that invokes Iommi\u2019s image, particularly the solo of \u201cLady Evil\u201d.  Unfortunately every time I hear this version, I picture Vivian Campbell on stage, playing well, but with his shoulders so stiff that he looks like his upper spine has been fused together. To this day when I see footage of him live with Def Leppard he still looks like the Tin Man on stage, it\u2019s actually quite amusing and can\u2019t really be excused as nervousness after more than 20 years of playing sold out shows.\n\nThis is a good rarity to seek out if you want to hear a pretty decent live version of a classic Dio song from the \u201cLast in Line\u201d album, but tracking it down may be difficult after 23 years. Barring the possibility that Dio decides to do a box set of all his singles from the 80s the way Helloween did, I doubt you\u2019d be able to find it. Unfortunately Dio had the tendency to simply put several songs from the same album on his singles rather than including leftovers that didn\u2019t make the cut so this may not happen either.\n",
        "\nFor a good many people the Sacred Heart album was Dio\u2019s last effort before losing the concept, whatever that actually means. For me it\u2019s just one more towering masterpiece in a career that would see a good deal of evolution that went beyond the 80s into the current day, with its share of ups and downs. The two songs found on this particular single represent the duality of the sound of Dio during the early years quite effectively; those being epic masterpieces and solid speed oriented metal.\n\n\u201cKing of Rock and Roll\u201d is speed metal in a sense, but it lacks the over the top double bass work that was stereotypical of the thrash scene and the newly forming German speed metal scene. It features a simple rhythm guitar approach with a quick pace from verse to chorus, the solo is short and an even mix of speed and melody, and the ending (or Coda) is dragged out so that Ronnie can showcase his ability to vary his lyrics in an almost ad lib fashion. There is a recorded audience to simulate a live performance, but in truth, there is very little difference between Dio\u2019s studio work and his live performances, something that sadly isn\u2019t always the case with today\u2019s metal bands.\n\n\u201cSacred Heart\u201d is basically a more keyboard heavy variation on the same formula that made \u201cThe Last in Line\u201d an instant classic. You can even hear variations in the rhythm guitar part that seems like they were borrowed from that song. Likewise, the solos are carefully crafted to stick in your memory, as if being a composed and elongated melody that you can almost sing along to, save the shred sections. The main riff that comes and goes from the intro to the chorus and back again at the end is unforgettable, even if you don\u2019t much care for Dio, you\u2019d know this song if it came on the radio, which sadly will probably never happen.\n\nBasically a collector\u2019s item to be sought out for vinyl enthusiasts, this single is a rarity that will no doubt be difficult and costly to obtain. I knew someone who had a hold of it a few years ago; though I have a feeling he probably numbered among the few hundred lucky enough to have a copy in tact. If you have a similar obsession for Dio as I do, this might be worth picking up, although it would probably be better to just get the Sacred Heart album on vinyl to kill two birds with one stone.\n",
        "\nDio's \"Holy Diver Live\" is by no means a landmark in music history. The album is average, and contains its good and bad points. The first disc is just as explained with the title. It's Holy Diver, in its sequential entirety (for the most part) played live, and the second disc contains some of Dio's tunes from Rainbow, Black Sabbath and his solo career. The songs should not be foreign to anyone following Dio. \n\nThe sound quality is good, with relatively very little to criticize. All of the instruments can be heard clearly along with Dio. However, the pyrotechnics can be heard at some points (especially during \u201cHeaven and Hell\u201d), and sometimes when the audience is supposed to sing the lyrics they can\u2019t be heard as well. The performance is excellent, save for a few points. Dio sounds very slightly hoarse on the \"title\" song but can still hit most of the notes. \"Gypsy\" was awesome, but would have been better if there was a seperation from the drum solo. The unaccompanied drum and guitar solos demonstrate talent, but are at the same time unremarkable. \u201cShame on the Night\u201d is almost seventeen minutes long on this disc, drawn out too far. On \u201cSign of the Southern Cross\u201d the intro is skipped, and the omission actually detracted from the quality of the composition. The live version of \u201cHeaven and Hell\u201d is about 12 minutes long, but works better than \u201cShame on the Night\u201d.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s well\u2026 average. Despite its drawbacks, it\u2019s still a great album to listen to. I can very safely say that if I were present I\u2019d have gladly screamed along with the masses. But unless you\u2019re a Dio fan already, you\u2019re not missing anything special.\n",
        "\nThe \"Holy Diver\" single is definitely one of the best singles that Dio has released in his entire career. It features three songs, the title track being the ultimate Dio classic that is loved by about anyone I can think of. Luckily, the other two tracks also belong to the greater side of Dio's back catalogue. \n\n\"Evil Eyes\" is one of the best tracks on the great \"The Last in Line\" album, featuring a nifty vocal delivery by the great dwarf that is Dio and some excellent riffing by the legendary Vivian Campbell. \n\n\"Don't Talk to Strangers\" is also one of the highlights on Dio's unforgettable classic that is \"Holy Diver\". It starts off in a rather balladesque fashion but soon explodes in a semi-fast riff with additional aggression in Dio's vocals. The lyrics are rather nice, even though I prefer the more hateful, politically charged lyrics in later albums. Vivian Campbell does a great job again; especially the part melodic/part shred solo simply smokes. \n\nI won't have to say much about the title track since it's one of the most well known songs in the heavy metal genre and arguably the best track in Dio's entire career. An eternal classic that doesn't need many words - simply a fantastic song. \n\nIf you are new to Dio, this is probably the best start - the single features one mid-paced and heavy rocker, a faster, almost speed-metallic song and a more balladesque track. A great combination that gives a nice overview about many defining aspects of the band. \n\nA classic single.\n",
        "\n\"Rainbow in the Dark\" is - apart from the title track - one of Dio's best-known songs and rightfully so. \n\nThe famous keyboard line in the chorus is not loved by everyone, the main reason for it being too loud that it buries the nice guitar riffs quite a bit. I'm not all that picky though, so to this fits just fine, since the whole \"Holy Diver\" album did mainly focus on Dio's fantastic vocals. Still, while the riffs themselves are memorable, I'd like to see them put in the foreground a bit more, since they are well written and so is the nifty solo-section - courtesy of Vivian Campbell.\n\nFor many, the Holy Diver - The Last In Line era was Dio's peak vocal-wise and I can see that right away (even though I do prefer him in Black Sabbath's \"Dehumanizer\") as he belts out some great vocal lines here, especially the chorus part does stick with you after the second or third listen. \n\nThe only thing this single (the album it was taken from as well) suffers from is the somewhat aged production. I'd love to hear this not only remastered, but re-recorded since it would bring out the songs strengths even more. \n\nLong story cut short, Dio's single \"Rainbow in the Dark\" is a very good classic Heavy Metal track and even though some hardcore fans overrate it beyond belief, it is definitely worth checking out.\n",
        "\nDio \u2013 Metal Hits is one of those cheap Flashback Records releases. Each Flashback CD only has ten tracks. However, Metal Hits makes up for this with good song selection. You get two tracks from Holy Diver, two from The Last in Line, three from Dream Evil, one from Lock Up the Wolves, and two from Strange Highways. I\u2019m glad that songs with guitarists Craig Goldy, Tracy G, and Rowan Robertson are on this compilation as Dio doesn\u2019t begin and end with Vivian Campbell, as great as he is, on guitar.\n\n\nPersonally, I think Dio\u2019s keyboard playing on \u201cRainbow in the Dark\u201d is pretty good but a lot of people say it is crap. I really like the bass lines on \u201cHoly Diver\u201d and \u201cThe Last In Line\u201d. Of course this package has the big three Dio hits I just mentioned, but the other songs are also worthwhile. The songs have good variety from the slow, doomy durge of \u201cHollywood Black\u201d to the more up-tempo \u201cNight People\u201d. Lyrically the songs vary to an extent but have similar themes about the individual, the outcast, the anti-hero, society in general.\n\n\nOverall, worth it is for six bucks (less than a dollar a song). For a cheap greatest hits package, it\u2019s generally well done. This album is an OK starting point for someone looking to get into Dio who doesn\u2019t have much cash on hand.\n\n\nFavorite Tracks: Holy Diver, Rainbow in the Dark, Night People, Last In Line, Evil Eyes, Sunset Superman, Dream Evil, Hollywood Black.\n",
        "\nHeavy Metal has always been a flexible genre, allowing for individual artists to explore a variety of topics and evolve the sound of their music in almost any direction. However, most acts truly shine when they decide to get back to basics and provide something that is aggressive, yet still maintaining the musicality necessary to keep it from being rubbish. And in the year 1994, creating music that listened like garbage was pretty much the order of the day.\n\n\u201cStranger Highways\u201d is a dark and nebulous album, touching upon a variety of different musical and lyrical themes, yet maintains a sense of simplicity that makes it one of the more accessible Dio releases, particularly among people who go for the heavier side of the genre. Most of the music is heavily oriented around the Doom style, relying on a slow tempo and a somewhat muddy guitar tone. Likewise there is a heavy emphasis on the vocals and a general sense of anger and hostility in Ronnie\u2019s vocal delivery, although it succeeds avoiding the Phil Anselmo caricature of a shouting fool. \n\nTracey G\u2019s playing is actually quite comparable to Tony Iommi, Ritchie Blackmore, and even at times Vivian Campbell, but his approach to riff construction and soloing is actually quite a bit more agitated than any of them. \u201cJesus, Mary and the Holy Ghost\u201d and the title track are probably the best examples of his rather unique approach to blending complex Neo-classical riffs with his dissonant riff drones. Other rockers such as \u201cFirehead\u201d, \u201cBlood from a stone\u201d and \u201cBring down the rain\u201d sound quasi-Rainbow inspired, although the atmosphere is not nearly as light and hopeful. \n\nAlthough mostly an album with slower songs and a good amount of socially relevant themes, the best song on here is the one that reaches back to Dio\u2019s better days in the mid-80s. \u201cHere\u2019s to you\u201d has a rather fun and fast atmosphere to it, reminding me of classic anthems such as \u201cWe Rock\u201d and \u201cStand up and Shout\u201d. It\u2019s also a necessary change of pace for songs dealing with such deep topics as the ones discussed in more Doom oriented tracks such as \u201cHollywood Black\u201d and \u201cEvilution\u201d, although that does not mean to suggest that either of these songs are bad. In fact, the only song that really doesn\u2019t listen well on here is \u201cGive her the gun\u201d, mostly due to the stupid acoustic guitar line during the verses which sounds a lot like stuff heard on a Pearl Jam album.\n\nFans of Dio will obviously like most of the stuff on here, particularly if the music on \u201cDehumanizer\u201d and \u201cLock up the Wolves\u201d. It is a good deal heavier than the latter and probably not as lyrically witty as the former, but it is a solid listen nonetheless. Fans of Dio who can\u2019t stand anything that Vivian Campbell isn\u2019t on are advised to check this out as Tracey G\u2019s style is not too far away from Viv\u2019s. Dio recorded lots of good albums since then so get your heads out of your asses and wise up. To all the rest of you out there not familiar with Dio\u2019s work, this will sit well mostly with Doom metal fans and some in the Progressive scene who like their music dark and angry.\n",
        "\nOne of the most painful things in the world is to watch a hero of yours fail in his quest, and that is what I felt when I first purchased this album 11 years ago. After coming off some gigs with my all Metallica cover band that didn\u2019t go so smoothly, I sought solace in the fact that Dio\u2019s 7th LP was out. My band mates at the time used to make fun of my fan boy obsession with the former Sabbath front man, referring to him as a washed up has been, and I had feared when I bought this album that that was what he had became, in only a short while after successfully bouncing back from the Sabbath debacle with a solid Doom Metal album in \u201cStrange Highways\u201d.\n\nThe principle flaw in this album is a complete lack of direction, something which is common in the genre of Progressive Metal, and technically Ronnie\u2019s status as a pioneer qualifies him as being part of it. Once we get about 1 minute into \u201cInstitutional Man\u201d we recognize that he\u2019s pushing a bit too hard for something new, in addition to drawing from some rather questionable sources. The beginning of this track sounds a tiny bit like Sabbath, but the muddy as hell tone sounds like a clumsy attempt at emulating a Crowbar album. The usage of odd time signatures doesn\u2019t mix well with the muddy guitars (I think Tracey G used a baritone guitar on here, which was also used on Sepultura\u2019s Chaos AD). Likewise the drums are not dense enough for a metal album, resulting in a quasi-punk sound unintentionally sneaking into the mix.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell the kids\u201d is a Pantera style speed metal song with good vocals, definitely a winner if you\u2019re a fan of songs like \u201cShattered\u201d and \u201cRise\u201d, and thankfully the muddy baritone guitar is not to be found on here. \u201cBlack\u201d is a doom track that is under-developed, not enough riffs to keep it interesting, and Ronnie\u2019s vocal delivery is all over the place. \u201cHunter of the Heart\u201d is an odd mishmash of old style Dio metal from the Holy Diver era and his newfound sense of tonality, resulting in something that doesn\u2019t stick in the memory at all, it\u2019s simply there and then gone. \u201cStay out of my mind\u201d is loaded with weird keyboard sounds and a small collection of doom riffs, although a bit too long for its own good, it\u2019s a wild mind job for anyone who likes Progressive sounding Doom Metal.\n\n\u201cBig Sister\u201d is a big loser; not a bad bass line, but otherwise it just plods along and occasionally switches feel before plodding some more. \u201cDouble Monday\u201d picks up the tempo a bit and we get something that sounds a bit closer to \u201cStrange Highways\u201d, definitely a keeper. \u201cGolden Rules\u201d and \u201cDying in America\u201d both repetitive Groove Metal tracks with somewhat interesting atmospheric intros, they\u2019re good for the first 45 seconds and then fall apart. And before we finally leave the weird ass place that is this album we hit the closing ballad/afterthought \u201cThis is your life\u201d, which not only is lyrically steeped in clich\u00e9 and musically derivative, but is 100% out of place amongst the previous 9 tracks of sludge driven Doom/Groove.\n\nWhen interviewed about this album, which was not received well by fans or critics, he stated that at the time he wasn\u2019t really even sure what metal was at that time. I can sympathize with him in that at the time I was completely baffled at what it was. Was it the repetitive bore fest of Pantera and the Groove Movement, was it the dark hell of post-Technical Brutal Death Metal, or was it the completely devoid of structure approach of many Prog metal outfits at the time? The metal movement had absolutely no unifying symbol at the time, only a bunch of tribal leaders trying to establish their own dogmatic styles and turncoats who wanted to sell records by playing Alternative Rock.\n\nDio\u2019s answer to this was ironically to take the catholic (small \u201cc\u201d, not the religion) approach and to simply embrace all of this, in other words he chose to be eclectic. And the resulting mess of contradictory styles and sounds is blatant, though more than anything a sign of the times. There is absolutely nothing wrong here with Dio\u2019s singing, Tracey G\u2019s playing (he gets ripped on for not being Vivian Campbell as Craig Goldy did, but he is good), with Jeff Pilson\u2019s bass work (this is the most active I\u2019ve ever heard him) or Vinnie\u2019s drumming. The problem is that the songwriting is devoid of any continuity, it\u2019s trying to be both everywhere and nowhere at the same time.\n\nFans of Dio will not be happy with this release, nor am I. When I buy an album with his name on it, I get something that listens well from start to finish; I don\u2019t have to use the skip button constantly. You\u2019ve got 3 or maybe even 4 songs on here that are good, but even they are a bit out of character for him. I can\u2019t endorse this album, although I continue to happily endorse pretty much every other release he\u2019s put out. Every band is entitled to a flop at some point, and Dio was fortunate that so far this has only happened to him once. If any of the songs on here sound appealing, shop for this at $3 or less.\n",
        "\nDio\u2019s \u2018Holy Diver\u2019 has always been one of my favorite metal albums of all time. Obviously, I assumed Dio\u2019s other albums must be great as well. So I picked up \u2018Killing The Dragon.\u2019 To tell you the truth, it was a big disappointment to me. No, Dio HAS written more good releases other than \u2018Holy Diver,\u2019 (\u2018Last In Line,\u2019 for example, is amazing.) But out of Dio\u2019s \u201camazing\u201d albums, \u2018Killing The Dragon\u201d is definitely not one on them.\n\nThe biggest problem on here is \u2013 yes, I\u2019m being serious \u2013 it\u2019s boring. That is something definitely not expected from a Dio album. But no matter how much I try and listen to this album, it just won\u2019t grow on me. I keep finding myself wanting to skip to the next track, hoping the next one will be better, while reluctantly waiting, also hoping perhaps that the one I\u2019m currently listening to will kick off and get a little better. It doesn\u2019t. \u2018Killing The Dragon\u2019 and \u2018Cold Feet\u2019 are Dio masterpieces. Great songs. But that\u2019s about it. Out of 10 songs, 2 are good. The rest are mediocre, boring, and unoriginal. I would\u2019ve expected something better from Dio.\n\nThe production here is amazing, so that\u2019s at least one great part of the album. The guitars and drums especially are mixed very well together, and neither one of them drowns out Dio\u2019s voice. His vocals can be heard perfectly (although, in most cases, you can hear his voice is slowly dying down \u2013 no longer the powerful vocalist that he was on \u2018Holy Diver\u2019 twenty years ago. Sorry Dio.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. This album is not horrible. As the title says, it\u2019s decent. It\u2019s\u2026 average. Better than a lot of newer metal releases, DEFINITELY without a doubt better than any metalcore crap, but being average also means that there is an equally big number of better albums out there. Get it only if you\u2019re a Dio collector. If you are simply thinking of trying out some of Dio\u2019s work, without a doubt get \u2018Holy Diver.\u2019\n\n-Marcin C.\n",
        "\nAs far as Greatest Hits compilations go, the earlier they are, the more coherent they tend to be. \u201cDiamonds: Best of Dio\u201d is pretty much Dio\u2019s We Sold Our Souls for Rock and Roll, containing all of the most successful and well known of his early years before he went into his more experimental mode in the mid 1990s. It is chronologically ordered (minus the placement of \u201cHide in the Rainbow\u201d) and thus it listens fairly smoothly and lacks the abrupt switches in style or sound that many greatest hits compilations tend to have.\n\nAs with any compilation, I was drawn to it when I first bought it because it had songs on it that I lacked, those being the Lock up the Wolves songs and \u201cHide in the Rainbow\u201d from the Iron Eagle soundtrack. As I still have yet to procure a copy of the Iron Eagle soundtrack, this album has not completely outgrown its usefulness; hence it is not a completely pointless purchase for even the more rabid Dio fans that probably were only lukewarm to the other stuff on the Iron Eagle soundtrack.\n\nHowever, much as is the case with \u201cWe Sold Our Souls for Rock and Roll\u201d, I have a complaint about the songs that were selected. The conventional wisdom at this point in time (1992) amongst the Dio faithful was that Vivian Campbell was what defined Dio, thus in the interest of keeping the fan base happy, the Dream Evil stuff (which is superior to all the Vivian Campbell era stuff in my view) has been given the shaft and most of the compilation is dominated by the first 3 albums. I\u2019m sorry, but \u201cAll the Fools Sailed Away\u201d and \u201cSunset Superman\u201d were far greater songs than \u201cHungry for Heaven\u201d, and the fact that the former was good enough to be adapted to the music video form confirms my suspicions. Much as the famed Black Sabbath compilation of 1976, this compilation is a reflection of a mindset that robs the history of Dio of perspective. Craig Goldy was responsible both for keeping Dio\u2019s most successful tour (Sacred Heart tour) from collapsing halfway through and was twice the showman that Vivian ever was, but apparently that counts for little according to the old guard of Dio purists.\n\nAs for who this album is geared for, it would mostly be old fogies who only have Dio albums on tape or vinyl and can\u2019t afford to repurchase the entire discography on CD. Younger fans that are getting into Dio and want to do research are encouraged to pick up a copy of the \u201cStand Up and Shout Anthology\u201d as it is far more comprehensive than this and doesn\u2019t rob anything from Craig Goldy\u2019s invaluable contributions to Ronnie\u2019s career. This one is slightly less expensive, and it is a better listen than the vast mountain of pointless Dio Greatest Hits albums out there that are seemingly thrown together at random, but it is woefully incomplete.\n",
        "\nHoly Diver\u2026 Dio\u2019s legendary debut album. This album is the definition of heavy metal. This album is flawless. This album is perfect. This album is amazing. This album is incredible. This album is epic. This album is classic. This album is astounding. I could go on for hours praising the greatness of \u2018Holy Diver.\u2019 Dio is a genius, and this is the album that forever earned him a place in heavy metal history.\n\nThe album starts out with the anthemic \u2018Stand Up And Shout.\u2019 The second I heard this song, I knew this album was gonna be great. \u201cYou've got desire!!! So let it out!!! You've got the power!!! Stand up and shout!!! Shout! Shout! Stand up and shout!!!\u201d\n\nDio seemed to put together all the good things he had when working on albums with legends like Rainbow and Black Sabbath, as well as the live contributions to Deep Purple, and more. This album has it all. Killer riffs, godly vocals, smart and intelligent lyrics, great and catchy melodies and choruses, perfect keyboards\u2026 not one thing on here lacks.\n\nThis album has no fillers whatsoever. Every song is a classic. All the way from the anthem for metalheads everywhere, \u2018Stand Up And Shout\u2019 to the darker \u2018Shame On The Night\u2019, \u2018Holy Diver\u2019 is a success. Best songs on here would definitely be \u2018Stand Up And Shout,\u2019 \u2018Holy Diver,\u2019 and \u2018Rainbow In The Dark.\u2019 \u2018Rainbow In The Dark,\u2019 for example, uses keyboards similar to how Rainbow used them in classics such as \u2018Stargazer.\u2019 The song is INCREDIBLY catchy\u2026 Dio\u2019s voice is perfect, and fits in with the music flawlessly.\n\nThe production on this album is also amazing. No instrument is too loud, no instrument too quiet. Dio\u2019s voice is slightly louder than anything else, and the drums backing up his voice add even more power to his booming, commanding voice. Dio is one of metal\u2019s greatest singers, right up there with Dickinson and Halford, and this album proves this point unquestionably.\n\nI barely ever rate an album a perfect 100, but Dio leaves me no choice. No matter how hard I try, I cannot find anything wrong with \u2018Holy Diver.\u2019 This is a classic that will be remembered forever, and a major milestone in heavy metal music. Anyone who doesn\u2019t own it cannot possibly consider themselves a metalhead.\n\n-Marcin C.\n",
        "\nEvery once in a while a greatest hits collection comes around that will be an absolute must have for any fan of a band, one that contains all the right amount of perks and rarities to entice the most hardcore fan, yet still contain all the necessary hits to rope in the casual listener. \u201cStand Up and Shout\u201d lives up to its name by shouting one thing to the potential buyer, \u201cIf you buy me you will get it all!!\u201d You get every era spanning Dio\u2019s career since the early 70s with Elf up until his last great effort in the 1990s Strange Highways.\n\nAs someone who was an already established enthusiast for Dio\u2019s Sabbath and solo work at the time, my main reason for getting this release was the Elf and Rainbow material, the former of which I was 100% unexposed to while the latter had only been touched upon due to live performances and one greatest hits compilation. \n\nThe Elf material, for its time, is quite an innovative fusion of blues and rock that requires a bit of historical perspective in order to grasp. When you consider that the heaviest thing going on at the time was Black Sabbath and that they were considered an aberration, this is quite hard edged stuff and a path can been seen to where Dio would grow into what he is now.\n\nThe Rainbow stuff includes the obvious tour favorites \u201cLong Live Rock and Roll\u201d and \u201cMan on the Silver Mountain\u201d, as well as the only slightly less well known \u201cStarstruck\u201d. Although these songs are all a great listen and rock hard, I had hoped that more epic tracks such as Gates of Babylon would have made it onto here, but of course those tracks are to be found on Rainbow compilations.\n\nThe Black Sabbath stuff is presented chronologically, which is a breath of fresh air as most Sabbath compilations are dreadfully unorganized. You have all the essentials from both the early 80s era as well as the strongest song from the 1992 reunion in \u201cComputer God\u201d. We also get a great live version of \u201cVoodoo\u201d from the Mob Rules tour back in 1982 that qualifies as a genuine rarity.\n\nDio\u2019s solo material has also been well organized and includes pretty much all the no-brainer tracks from the first two albums. We get a live version of \u201cSacred Heart\u201d from the famous tour that spawned the Video concert carrying the same name, definitely a great perk for the Dio fan that already has most of the discography. To my relief, the Dream Evil material was not given the shaft and the two best songs from it are found on here. Likewise, both Lock up the Wolves and Strange Highways managed to get their title tracks onto this compilation, rounding out the tail end of a career that spanned more than 20 years at that point.\n\nTo the prospective buyer who is looking for some stuff with Ronnie Dio attached to it that is not found on the LPs, as well as the fan of metal who wishes an introduction to the artist, this is the album to go for. It listens extremely well owing to it being well organized and all of the songs being digitally remastered, which is more than what I can say for the majority of the large amount of Dio greatest hits CDs out there. Get yourself a copy today and be prepared to Stand up and Shout.\n",
        "\nThe Sacred Heart tour was the biggest and most theatrically driven one that Dio had ever accomplished as a solo artist, spanning select cities from America all the way over to Japan. It was a time of consternation for Ronnie and his other band mates as Vivian Campbell left the band in the middle of the tour over what now appears to be insecurities about his own abilities. Some heralded this as the last part of Dio\u2019s era as significant players in the metal world; but all agree that regardless to what came afterwards, it was definitely a high point for the whole genre of metal.\n\nThe set list of this concert includes all the expected classics from the last two LPs and the Black Sabbath and Rainbow material. I\u2019m personally not a huge fan of the medley approach to the Rainbow material, and I often wish they would play the full song of \u201cHeaven and Hell\u201d rather than add that corky interlude about the two shapes telling Ronnie where he ought to be, but the performance on here is so spectacular that I don\u2019t mind it at all. \n\nThe best performances on here are clearly the material from the Sacred Heart album, none of which seem to enjoy regular live play nowadays due to constant demands for the Holy Diver and Last in Line classics, in addition to the obvious necessity of including new material from the release they tour on. \u201cKing of Rock and Roll\u201d is done masterfully and really gets the crowd jazzed up. \u201cRock and Roll Children\u201d is probably my pick for Ronnie\u2019s best vocal performance, which is fitting since it\u2019s his favorite song from the Sacred Heart LP. But the best overall performance for the band goes to \u201cSacred Heart\u201d. The theatrics on here are absolutely spellbinding: be it the brief storyteller prelude featuring Dio speaking of the magical realm beyond the rainbow bridge (reference to Bifrost no less), the state of the art for the time laser effects show, the hydraulics controlled Dragon and Knights, or all the extended play by the musicians in the midst of all of the things going on. \n\nAbove all, the one who really had something to prove on this tour was Craig Goldy, who had to step into the shoes of 3 album veteran and unlikely guitar hero Vivian Campbell (who has since become a guitar zero) and win over every fan that came to every concert. Not only does he accomplish this, but he eclipses Vivian in the live performance department with his more animated presence and technical ability. His attitude is the link that unites all of these elements into one astounding performance that establishes him as Dio\u2019s greatest solo project collaborator (I still like Ronnie\u2019s collaborations with Tony Iommi better), as he was a fan and admirer of Ronnie long before joining, much as Ronnie was before joining ranks with Ritchie Blackmore.\n\nI own both the VHS and DVD versions of this concert and although I am partial to the DVD because of the elucidating interview with both Ronnie and Craig, I do still occasionally pop in the old VHS for nostalgia\u2019s sake. If you like Dio, this is a must have, no question about it. If you can only own one concert on DVD featuring this band, this is the one to have.\n",
        "\nDio\u2019s career in the 80s after his brief though brilliant stint with Black Sabbath was hailed at the time as the continuation of the greatness that was achieved then. However, amongst Dio fans there is a pseudo-elitist bunch that constantly rips on the post-Vivian Campbell era as being sleep worthy. Newsflash, Vivian Campbell\u2019s entire career both before and after Dio was and is sleep worthy. When asked about his experiences with Ronnie he would constantly whine that he was under pressure to do something extravagant. When one combines this with his extremely non-existent stage presence and lack of showmanship, it becomes further clear that in addition to only being as good as what Ronnie could force out of him, that he lacked the soul of a metal musician.\n\nBy stark contrast, Craig Goldie is everything that a metal guitarist should be: a technician, an animated stage presence, and above all someone who loves the art enough not to complain about being pushed to improve himself. When you listen to the solos and the riffs on here, you hear all of this, along with a good sense of musicality shown in the idiomatic harmonies that are incorporated into what are otherwise great shred solos. In more recent times, while Vivian sees fit to hide behind the superior lead playing ability of Phil Collin in Def Leppard, Craig would help compose a brilliant trilogy of albums to bring Dio into the 21st century.\n\nFor those of us with musically inclined ears instead of unquestioning devotion to the past, this is Dio\u2019s high point in his career in the 80s. \u201cAll the Fools Sailed Away\u201d is a grand epic containing some of the most complex set of musical sections and transitions ever conceived by the evil little elf, not to mention among the most poetically complex lyrics he\u2019s ever penned. Claude Schnell shows his lead playing capabilities on here with a brilliant exchange with Craig, who pretty much owns this entire song when Ronnie isn\u2019t singing.\n\nThe song accompanying on this single \u201cOverlove\u201d is another beast all together. The intro sounds like a more up tempo and complex version of a late 50s early 60s blues/rock riff, although when the distortion kicks in it sound like an extremely fast version of \u201cMan on the Silver Mountain\u201d with some Shakespearean lyrics thrown into the mix. Vinnie Appice also makes one hell of a racket on this one, although his finest drum work would be found on other songs that would appear on the same album as this one.\n\nTo all fans of Dio, if you are of the older generation of fans and already own this, you will agree with me that there is nothing like experiencing Dio on vinyl. In addition to this rare little beauty, I also possess Holy Diver on vinyl, in addition to my CD copy. For those of you who have not had the experience of hearing this single, its on the Dream Evil LP, so just pick that up and enjoy 9 excellent songs from a guitar player that could teach Vivian Campbell a thing or two about rocking out.\n",
        "\nThe year was 2003 and Dio had been riding high on the waves of a Metal Renaissance that began in Europe and has gradually been working its way into the states. The subsequent tour following the successful and musically inspired album \u201cKilling the Dragon\u201d yielded an amazing set of performances, one of which I was lucky enough to personally witness from the 12th row at the Star Lake Pavilion in Pittsburg where they Co-Headlined with the Scorpions and Deep Purple (the last tour with Jon Lord on the keys I might add). For those of you who didn\u2019t manage to catch any of those shows, this DVD is a good substitute for the original experience, though obviously not quite as exhilarating.\n\nOne of the advantages that Ronnie Dio had on this tour over previous ones is that he had the most technically and musically proficient set of musicians behind him ever. Bassist Jimmy Bain holds the bottom of the arrangement strongly, as he has consistently done since he and Dio began their collaboration in Rainbow. Drummer Simon Wright puts on a hell of a technical display during his allotted solo time, making one wonder how he managed to keep those insanely simple beats when in AC/DC without having a breakdown. Scott Warren proves apt to the task of playing all keyboard parts previously handled by the likes of Jens Johansen and Claude Schnell. But the true technical wizard of the bunch proves to be Doug Aldrich, whose interpretations of the various solos coined by Dio\u2019s previous collaborators is rivaled only by his amazingly varied display during his own solo sections, hitting upon such contrasting styles as Classical, Rock, Jazz, and Blues.\n\nThe collection of songs on here draw from nearly every era of Dio\u2019s solo career except one, the Tracey G years, which is fitting as any metal artist would rather forget the era that those songs were written in, regardless to how good or bad each one was. The classics such as \u201cHoly Diver\u201d, \u201cWe Rock\u201d and \u201cRainbow in the Dark\u201d are all handled well, though \u201cThe Last in Line\u201d steals the show as always. The Magica material is done mostly well, although Doug\u2019s interpretation of the main riff to \u201cFever Dreams\u201d is a little bit sloppy. The newer material is in good order, \u201cRock and Roll\u201d being the highlight as it contains a brilliant aside on free speech by Ronnie before it gets started, as well as a stellar vocal performance.\n\nSome rather pleasant surprises that appeared on here include a revamping of the set list, which has changed little since the tours of the first two Dio LPs. They have opted to drop the \u201cLong Live Rock and Roll/Man on the Silver Mountain\u201d medley, which I personally was never really fond of as both of those songs would tend to be butchered in that format. \u201cHeaven and Hell\u201d is performed a lot closer to its original album version, which is another welcomed change as the whole \u201cBig Black Shape/Little White Shape\u201d interlude got old shortly after the Sacred Heart tour. We do have a medley in the form of \u201cEgypt (The Chains are on)/Children of the Sea\u201d, which is not a bad match and brings back two songs that have not enjoyed a lot of play in recent years.\n\nThe extras on this DVD include a rather humorous music video of \u201cPush\u201d, featuring Tenacious D doing a funny version of \u201cHeaven and Hell\u201d and Ronnie throwing his own brand of comedy into the mix. The fact that this video didn\u2019t enjoy much play on any of the various Music Video stations is telling about the moronic nature of the mainstream and its various media outlets, but for the perspective DVD shopper this purchase would be a key to liberating itself from the simpleton steeped airwaves. The behind the scenes footage is also interesting, as is the interview where Ronnie gives a brief retrospective of his career and his philosophical viewpoints.\n\nImplied in the release of this DVD is a plain yet subliminal message, \u201cGET OFF YOUR ASS AND BUY THIS\u201d, it is directed at all fans of Dio old and young. After 17 years there is a new version of the Dio live experience on the video medium and it is sure to please. To those of you who thought that Dio was a has been and that he would hang it up at the turn of the millennium, may you suffer and die listening to the audio of this DVD being played at full blast by your neighbors knowing just how wrong you were.\n",
        "\nThe primary characteristic of doom metal that separates it from all the other genres in the metal umbrella is a combination of socially conscious lyrical pursuits and an emphasis on a slow, heavy, and atmospheric approach musically. In this respect, Dio has not been a consistently doom oriented band, but on this album they come closer than they ever have without sacrificing the quality of sound. \u201cMaster of the Moon\u201d most resembles the musical complexity found on \u201cMagica\u201d, though lyrically it is closer to the darkness of \u201cStrange Highways\u201d.\n\nIf there is any real drawback in the approach taken on this album, it is the de-emphasis on the guitar as a lead instrument, something which is quite disappointing to me as Craig Goldy is my favorite guitarist of all the ones Dio has worked with since Sabbath. His solos are extremely short, they tend to focus on minimalist riffing, and they lack the flair and energy that was heavily present on \u201cMagica\u201d. Consequently, the songs tend to emphasize two aspects of the band more than others, and that is Ronnie\u2019s lyrics and Scott Warren\u2019s keyboard playing.\n\nAlthough mostly a slow and heavy album, Ronnie and the guys have not forgotten how to put out a couple of decent up tempo songs. \u201cOne more for the Road\u201d is a typical opening track, its fast and fun, reminding me heavily of \u201cKing of Rock and Roll\u201d, minus the lyrics which seem to draw a bit from the title track of \u201cKilling the Dragon\u201d. Lyrically this song is probably among the more witty compositions Ronnie has put forth, save \u201cTV Crimes\u201d off of Dehumanizer. \u201cLiving the Lie\u201d is also up tempo, but is not quite as energetic as the opening track.\n\nMost of the remaining tracks on here are doom oriented. Some tracks such as \u201cDeath by Love\u201d and \u201cShivers\u201d borrow heavily from earlier Dio material, the former being lyrically similar to \u201cOverlove\u201d off of Dream Evil, the latter reminding heavily of a couple of tracks off of \u201cStrange Highways\u201d. \u201cThe End of the World\u201d and \u201cI am\u201d are slower rock oriented and have some decent riffs, but are also mostly driven by Dio\u2019s vocal delivery. \n\nThe real standouts on this album are the remaining songs on here. \u201cThe man who would be king\u201d and the title track are quite catchy and lyrically thought provoking, although the former got caught up in the politics of the time and will probably lose its intended meaning over time. \u201cThe Eyes\u201d is the heaviest track on here and by far the spookiest sounding. The effects on the lead guitar sounds almost like a person nervously trying to form words to articulate the sense of paranoia found in the lyrics. \u201cIn Dreams\u201d is a solid track with a lyrical message about drawing borders between reality and the imagination, not quite as good musically as the other 3 standouts, but solid.\n\nAs to the political message of \u201cThe man who would be king\u201d, 2004 will probably go down in history as the year that everybody felt the need to express themselves politically yet didn\u2019t bother to apply any intellectual curiosity. Where Dio succeeds in separating himself from most of the halfwits who thought they knew what they were talking about (*cough* Green Day and Disturbed) is that he is intelligent in his application of poetic metaphors. However, much as is the case with Queensryche, he doesn\u2019t give us any clue as to what alternative we should take to Dubya and his brand of Nationalism. If he wishes to imply that electing John Kerry, Ralph Nader or some wacko Green party guy would make things any better, I am afraid I may have under-estimated his mind. But thankfully, I don\u2019t see him doing a lot of campaigning for politicians so I can give him a pass on what seems to be an absurd viewpoint, despite how annoyed I was at being preached at by the metal bands I love during that time period. Bush will be gone in 2 years and all you guys will have a new moron to complain about, this guy won\u2019t even be a memory in 4 years.\n\nIn conclusion, pretty good album, although not quite up to the same caliber as his last two. I recommend it primarily to fans of \u201cStrange Highways\u201d and \u201cMagica\u201d as it sounds like a combination of the two. Lyrically it is quite an interesting listen, although it is a tiny bit lacking in the riffs department and it is quite slow compared to your average metal album\n",
        "\nOne aspect of the live CD that is often ignored is it's function as a testimonial to the artist's ability to put on a great show. It is not a substitute for being at the concert, nor does it contain the visual aspect that a DVD would, but it is a piece of history preserved for the sake of those who could not view the tour in question. In the field of putting on a great show, Dio has never waivered, even as he enters his 60s he is still going on as strong as ever.\n\nHowever, even the greatest of performances can be tainted if the play itself is not of the highest caliber, and here lies the flaw in this album. This is taken from the trough of Dio's fall from significance in the realm of music (before the resurgence that occurred with Magica's release), the Angry Machines tour. As such, we have two tracks from Dio's weakest release, accompanied by an overloaded collection of early work from the first 2 studio albums and Ronnie's past work with Rainbow.\n\nAlthough all parties in question perform well, the lack of anything new or fresh on here is quite disappointing, though not unexpected. If you replaced the Angry Machines songs and \"Jesus, Mary and the Holy Ghost\" with songs from the Sacred Heart album, you would have the exact same set list that can be found on the Sacred Heart video. All of this screams out a single message, Dio is considered a has been and thus is limited to playing only the classics. \n\nOne advantage to this CD, however, is that because of Tracey G's radically different approach to soloing and his highly dark sound we get a radically different take on many of the older Dio material. \"Holy Diver\" and \"Heaven and Hell\" sound much more doom oriented than on any other live compilation containing these classics. \"The Last in Line\" has a more agitated sounding solo, probably because it's a difficult solo to pull off so Tracey retailored it to fit his own style.\n\nOut of all the material covered on here, the material off the \"Holy Diver\" and \"Last in Line\" albums are the strongest. The two best songs on here are \"Straight through the Heart\" and \"We Rock\". By contrast, the Rainbow material and \"Heaven and Hell\" are performed quite poorly. \"Man on the Silver Mountain\" is played way too damn fast, and up until Doug Aldrich joined the band for the Killing the Dragon tour, they never lived up to the dramatic studio version of Heaven and Hell. \n\nThe newer stuff is a mixed bag, owing mainly to inconsistencies between the 2 albums that Tracey G had played on before hand. \"Jesus, Mary, and the Holy Ghost\" is a stand up performance, well worthy of being the opener of the show. \"Double Monday\" is not bad, it's one of the less disjointed and confused songs off of Angry Machines. \"Hunter of the Heart\" is an utter bore fest, owing completely to it just being a lousy song. You could have Tony Iommi play this song and it would still suck.\n\nIn conclusion, I can't really give this live album a strong recommendation because of the large number of alternatives out there, particularly in the video format. The release onto DVD of footage from the tours of the first two albums would be preferrable to this, although more recent fans of Dio should probably pick up \"Evil or Divine\" on DVD. This CD may find a home with core Dio fans who liked Tracey G's playing style, but it's recommended audience is not large by any standard.\n",
        "\nRonnie James Dio hit the solo scene hard in 1983 with the release of 'Holy Diver'. After a fallout with Black Sabbath due to the mixing of \"Live Evil\" (1982), the band split in half and Dio took drummer Vinnie Appice with him to form the foundation for DIO. They recruited former Rainbow (whom Dio had been vocalist for in the 1970s) bassist Jimmy Bain and Sweet Savage guitarist Vivian Campell to fill those respective spots. Together these four would create a masterpiece of an album. It would be called 'Holy Diver' and was released in May 1983.\n\nIn my own terms, DIO manages to pull you in with the opening track 'Stand Up and Shout'. A fast-paced number which tells us to ignore the people who try to hold us back and express yourself as you see fit. The title track of 'Holy Diver' is up next and sends the message of not everything being as it appears to be in this world. The cover of the album shows DIO's mascot Murray drowning a priest but Dio has said many times, \"why is a devil drowning a priest?\" how do we know that the priest isn't drowning the devil?\n\nDespite having only nine tracks (though I believe the remastered version has extra tracks), the album really doesn't have a weak song. 'Caught in the Middle' is a great track with a nice melody to go along and a very catchy chorus line but what got me hooked on the song was the opening lyrics:\n\n\"Look deep inside of yourself, you might see someone you don't know.\"\n\nDio writes in metaphors and expresses it out into his music which works beautifully. He tells of his meanings for plenty of songs but everyone who listens to it can have a different view on what the song is about. What I take out of my favourite lyric in that song is \"Even the angels have a devil.\" 'Don't Talk to Strangers' tells us that everything you choose to do in life has a consequence. 'Straight Through the Heart' tightens the grip and brings forth another heavy and melodic song and as left evident by many Metal bands is hard to perfect, but DIO does it and DIO does it well. 'Invisible' starts off like a ballad and then rushes into the fast-paced music which is a common theme for DIO. 'Rainbow in the Dark' would have been suitable as the final track but it comes in and seems to me to be about loneliness and yet upbeat with the music and maybe that's why I enjoy it. 'Shame on the Night' closes this masterpiece and opens with the howling of a wolf and a creepy little guitar line before bursting into another wolf howl and the creepy music starts again. The bass line makes this song, I think. Dio's voice does as well. This song speaks about the dangers of the night.\n\nIt doesn't matter if you're a fan of Heavy Metal or not, check this album out. With nine tracks and not a single one lacking, you are bound to find a track that you like. This album is worthy of the word \"masterpiece\". If you like Metal, this is an essential album to have, no doubts about that.\n",
        "\nSoon after the release of their strongest 80s album \"Dream Evil\", the entire band that was Dio completely self-destructed, leaving singer/songwriter Ronnie James Dio on his own to pick up the pieces. Suffice to say, he did an amazing job and picked a great bunch of musicians to fill the void. Simon Wright is arguably the biggest surprise, going from the minimalistic and dry drumming style of AC/DC to a more technical challenge with Dio, and would prove to be one of RJD's more reliable bandmates in later years. Jens Johannsen also had found himself on his own after parting ways with Rising Force and appears on this album, although we see a more reserved and atmospheric set of keyboard lines out of him on here, rather than the shred lines he is better known for. Bassist Ted Cook is probably one of Ronnie's more active bassists and is a suitable replacement for ex-Rainbow member Jimmy Bain.\n\nHowever, the truly biggest surprise on this album is 18 year old metal newcomer Rowan Robertson, who would not grace the metal scene again afterwards sadly. This guy really wrote some impressive and memorable riffs, not to mention some rather dramatic solos. The best way I can describe his style is a combination of Eddie Van Halen and Rhandy Rhodes, complete with all the screaming pinch harmonic bends and blues driven licks.\n\nOne plus to this album is the rather sizable collection of faster tracks. \"Walk on Water\" reminds alot of classic Dio cookers such as \"Stand up and Shout\" and \"King of Rock and Roll\". \"Wild One\" features one of the fastest drum beats I've ever heard put out by Dio, not to mention RJD's vocal delivery is amazing, especially the high scream just before the solo.\n\nWe also have some great mid-tempo epics loaded with great lyrical metaphors. \"Hey Angel\" has a thick texture, particularly in the vocal tracks, and is loaded with driving power chord riffs. \"Born on the Sun\" is has alot of blues driven riffs, and is highly comparable to epic Dio classic \"The Last in Line\". This song has Rowan's best guitar solo, and has an amazing ending fade out, complete with a similar background choir drone that was found on the title track of the 2nd album.\n\nNot one to rely completely, Dio has a good collection of slower and more doom sounding tracks. \"Between Two Hearts\" is probably the darkest song lyrically on this album, depicting an abusive relationship involving some sort of celebrity I'm guessing. The acoustic guitar part is extremely gloomy sounding, and is contrasted with a down tempo blues driven section that moves equally slow. \"Lock Up the Wolves\" is another gloomy song with a good deal of blues in the riffs, although a lot more atmospheric due to some rather weird keyboard lines. Ronnie gives another rare performance where his range jumps into the quasi-soprano range from time to time, and helps to paint the illustration of wolves ready to pounce on their next hapless victim.\n\nThe highlight of this album, however, is the closing track \"My Eyes\", which includes on of the most memorable and poignant sounding acoustic guitar parts I've ever heard. The solo on this one is highly melodic, it doesn't have much in the way of shred licks, but what it lacks in speed it makes up for in sheer passion. This track is one of my 3 favorites ever by Dio for it's lyrics, which describe the deep and often somber experience of being cast out by society. It is a bit similar, in terms of lyrics, to \"Invisible\" off the debut album, though I would say it is less metaphorical and also alot stronger.\n\nThe rest of the music on here is solid, but not quite as amazing as the rest. If I had to pick a favorite out of the bunch, it would probably be \"Why are they watching me\". Pretty much your quintessential mid-tempo Dio rocker with a solid guitar riff and a rather weird keyboard intro. Lyrically it's a tiny bit corny, but it's easy to bang your head to and will please greatly in the musical department.\n\nIn essence, a solid release from a band that was not what it was before, and unfortunately probably never will be again. Out of the 4 musicians on here, only Simon Wright would have further appearances with Dio, starting with his year 2000 magnum opus \"Magica\". Jens Johannsen would go on to play the keys for Stratovarius, and the other 2 pretty much went off the metal radar and started doing their own thing. This album is recommended highly to fans of traditional 80s metal, and fans of shred and Van Halen might find some nice treats in some of these tracks. Enjoy!\n",
        "\nFollowing a high innovative and progressive sci-fi concept album in \"Magica\", Ronnie Dio set out to release a follow-up to keep the momentum that had been building since the disappointing \"Angry Machines\". With Craig Goldie leaving the band almost as quickly as he had re-entered it, Ronnie tapped guitar shredder Doug Aldrich to fill the vacuum. Unlike Craig's more minimalistic and hook driven solos, Doug's work on here is very reminiscent of original Dio axeman Vivian Campbell, particularly on the faster tracks.\n\nThe overall sense of this album is one of nostalgia. Most of the songs on here are highly similar to Dio's past work either with Rainbow, Sabbath, or on his own. Songs like \"Better in the Dark\", \"Throw Away Children\", and \"Along came a Spider\" have extremely spooky and doom-like intros. The lyrics are especially dark on \"Throw Away Children\", which is essentially a song describing the rather detestable condition that some children often find themselves in when their parents abandon them.\n\nMid-tempo rockers like \"Scream\" and \"Guilty\" are heavily similar to his earlier 80s material, particularly tracks like \"Eat your heart out\" and \"Breathless\" off of the Last in Line. The album's most well-known track \"Push\" has a highly memorable main riff, spearheaded by a more positive and uplifting message in the lyrics. \"Cold Feet\" sounds like Dio's Sabbath era music, the song that it probably bears most comparison to is \"Walk Away\" off the Heaven and Hell album. \"Before the Fall\" is a bit similar to Ronnie's more rocking work with Rainbow, and includes a rather intricant organ solo courtesy of his current keyboardist Scott Warren.\n\nThere are two amazing songs on here that can be labeled as stand out tracks. The title track has a rather spooky sounding keyboard intro, followed by a galloping guitar line that reminds a little bit of Iron Maiden. This song is highly atypical for Dio, and contains probably the most Vivian Campbell-like guitar solo of them all. \"Rock and Roll\" takes my pick for the best song on here both musically and lyrically. Although the main riff sounds a tiny bit Zepplin-like, the overall spirit of the music is highly riff driven. The quiet and brief intro on this is a staple of the Dio sound that has been with us since the beginning of the band, and probably will never go away. Lyrically this song has a special place in my collection, as it challenges the censorship-happy song police who can never resist exploiting the aftermath of a true tragedy in order to deny certain people their free speech rights.\n\nIn conclusion, this is essential listening for members of the traiditional metal crowd. Fans of progressive metal might want to pick this up to for the band's historical significance as an influences on the prog. scene, as these influences are on full display here. It's not \"Magica\" by any stretch, but it is an excellent album, well worthy of the price it retails for.\n",
        "\nDio's first solo album Holy Diver just plain and simple defines the words HEAVY METAL. Today there are so my sub-genres with the likes of Death, Black, Power, Progressive, Grove, Trash, Gothic, etc that many forget the plain and simple great \"heavy metal\" discs like Holy Diver. This disc is plain and simple HEAVY METAL with no frills. This is just fantastic guitar playing, killer riffs, God like vocals, and smart lyrics. \n\nThe reason I decided to sit down and write a review on this disc is for a horrific event that happened to me. I ended up with two mint copies of this CD and offered to give one for free to a friend of mine, a friend that is also a \"true\" heavy metal fan. My friend turned it down saying \"I respect Dio more than I like him\". I was flabbergasted! First of all who would turn down a free Dio disc and second how could anyone not like the album Holy Diver? \n\nI don't care what anyone says, if you like heavy metal, you are going to like this disc. Like I mentioned before, this album has fantastic guitar playing, smart lyrics, god like singing, and killer riffs. What metal fan doesn't like these things?\n\nWell, I for one love these things and Holy Diver was one of the pinnacle albums to make me become such a die hard metal head. Dio here proves his one of the kings when it comes to the genre.\n\nThe album opens with the fantastic rocker Stand Up and Shout. Right of the bat by this song you know that Dio is going for a harder approach than his Black Sabbath outings. Dio has always been good at starting his first solo albums (as well as the Sabbath discs he sung on) with great fast paced rockers. I sadly have never witnessed Dio live but I can imagine that this is a great live song. Then comes the grand title track with its moody, foreboding intro and then an explosive riff. The title track is one of the greatest heavy metal songs of all time...hands down. Other album highlights include Don't Talk to Strangers (which starts off with Dio's mellow singing and then explodes with another thunderous riff), Straight through the Heart, and perhaps Dio's best known song Rainbow in the Dark. Caught in the Middle, Gypsy, Invisible, and Shame on the Night are all weaker compared to the other tracks but they are far from terrible. Just great metal rockers. \n\nIf I were going on a life long space mission and I could only take 5 CDs with me to listen to for the rest of my life, Holy Diver would be one of the discs. This is just a pinnacle album that is a staple in every collection.\n\nOh, and by the way. If one of your friends offers you this CD for free (but then again, you should already have this in your collection), TAKE IT! If you don't like this CD...then I'm afraid to say that your a poser. STAND UP AND SHOUT!!!\n",
        "\nExpectation can often be the enemy of understanding, and conformity to conventional wisdom is usually the mother of all misunderstanding. For the heavy metal world, even when at its peak of popularity in the mid-1980s, there was always a feeling of going against the grain, despite taking varying degrees of inspiration from the mainstream. These are the circumstances in which an album such as Dio's famed or otherwise infamous third studio outing Sacred Heart is to be considered, an album caught between the worlds of mundane, hard rock living and the otherworldly one of fantastical storytelling, a middle ground that has long been confounded by those seeking to define its place in Ronnie James' auspicious solo career. Alongside a lyrical presentation that is a tad less heavy on grandiose metaphors is a more keyboard-oriented, AOR infused sound that is both appropriate to its 1985 year of release, yet also arguably a logical evolutionary step from the greater degree of pomp and circumstance brought into their sound on The Last In Line.\n\nSuffice it to say, this is a polarizing album within Dio's body of work, but also one where the line that separates the champions from the detractors are a bit less clearly drawn than expected. While definitely heavy on the keyboard presence, a bit more reliant on hook-oriented radio anthems than on adventurous songwriting, and about as close to a full on glam album as anything that Ronnie would ever sign off on, it is still well situated within the riff oriented and heavy-ended character that typifies his post-Rainbow work. Many naysayers have been quick to point out the more commercial character of this album as a whole, no doubt partially influenced by guitarist Vivian Campbell's desire for all the sold out arenas to turn into a correspondingly large cash haul, it is his signature guitar work that keeps this album entrenched within the heavy metal paradigm. Relative to past work either with Dio or prior with Sweet Savage, the flashes of scream-happy lead guitar work and busy rhythmic crunch is on the tame side, but still quite far from slouch territory.\n\nFrom a qualitative standpoint, Sacred Heart is a slight step down and arguably the weakest of this band's seminal offerings, which is ironic given that it boasts some of the most overtly fantastical imagery of any album ever put forth by the man on the silver mountain. The mighty dragon holding a mystic, heart-shaped charm before his chest amid a Latin inscription that roughly translates to \"At the end of dreams, I will prepare the sacred heart, the magic which opens upon the altar\" suggests a grand conceptual undertaking that, no doubt, inspired a number of subsequent storybook albums in the European power metal scene after the fact. Yet apart from the riveting title song, which listens like a more keyboard-drenched sequel to \"The Last In Line\", and the youthful rebellion story trope turned fantasy romp \"Rock 'N' Roll Children\" that runs along a slightly more Survivor-like AOR road to its otherwise obvious predecessor \"One Night In The City\", the high fantasy tale-bearing gives way to subjects more typically reserved to mainline hard rock territory.\n\nIt isn't so much to say that this album comes off as lacking in magic, but more so that the magic is of a more practical variety. There is no shortage of flash and flair when considering the busy speeder \"Just Another Day\" that cycles through a number of moments comparable to Sabbath hit \"Turn Up The Night\" and The Last In Line crusher \"Evil Eyes\", not to mention the punchy opening anthem \"King Of Rock And Roll\", featuring one of Vivian's more biting principle riffs and a witty array of lyrical quips out of Ronnie that some have imagined to be retaliatory jabs at his rival and frequently antagonistic Black Sabbath vocal predecessor Ozzy Osbourne. The pounding grooves and infectious goodness of \"Like The Beast Of A Heart\" listens like a slightly slicker and smoother rendition of \"Straight Through The Heart\", with Ronnie occasionally adding in his heavy metal rendition of Barry White via a voice modulator at key points. Truth be told, much of this album functions less as a sequel to its predecessor than it does a more streamlined revision of it.\n\nThough the hits outnumber the misses on this somewhat schizophrenic outing, there is some weight to the claim by this album's detractors that it is more a commercial venture than a truly coherent Dio offering. The borderline glam rock anthem \"Hungry For Heaven\", which secured a slot on the Vision Quest film soundtrack no less, is a case study in how to write a rock radio hit while still maintaining a guitar-heavy presence. It's an unusually happy and upbeat number compared to even the likes of \"Caught In The Middle\" and \"Mystery\", but Vivian's wailing guitar and Jimmy Bain's chunky bass lines give it the needed edge to keep things nasty enough, in much the same way that the concurrent offering this outfit made to the Iron Eagle soundtrack \"Hide In The Rainbow\" did. Sadly, this fairly effective adoption of mid-80s commercial rock is accompanied by a number of less lustrous material. While there is a sort of Deep Purple-infused charm to the rocking riff work on \"Fallen Angels\" and \"Another Lie\", they don't really cut as hard as \"Breathless\" or \"Gypsy\", and the closer \"Shoot Shoot\" hits a few solid chords but fails to really deliver a winning hook.\n\nBy the standards of an 80s rock/metal affair that's measured against the likes of Twisted Sister's Come Out And Play or Krokus' Change Of Address, this album is a titan among lesser mortals, but it definitely wants for something when compared to the rest of Dio's work from his early days with Rainbow up until Strange Highways. It maintains a strong base of support among the camp of Vivian Campbell loyalists, while those who took to the previous studio albums for their overall musicality and commitment to heavy metal orthodoxy tend to view it as a commercialized blunder that was rectified after Campbell's exodus from the fold. The truth is naturally in the middle, as the song for song results are a bit stylistically inconsistent, though few can deny the efficacy of the subsequent tour that saw this band undertake one of the most ambitious stage shows in metal history. Some may call it a bump on the road due to internal turmoil between the band's front man and its axe man, whereas this writer prefers to see it as a miraculously strong album considering all of the chaos surrounding it.\n\n(Rewritten on March 14th, 2020)\n",
        "\nNostalgia is an interesting beast, one that can make majestic mountains out of impressive (or occasionally unimpressive) hills, and can reveal certain detailing within the resulting horizon that has since become the subject of hindsight. The author of this review has himself shifted around a bit regarding the historical significance of several of his old favorite albums, not the least of which being the one that kicked off Ronnie James Dio's solo career, which has adorned his collection for more than 20 years. When asked about the very idea of being a solo artist, Ronnie was himself dismissive of it, asserting rather emphatically that he had always been a team player and one to give credit where credit is due concerning the musicians with whom he associated. While any prominent artist would be remiss to suggest that they alone should claim authorship over something that is a collaborative effort simply because the project bears his name, the modesty that Dio would display in this regard went a tad overboard and fails to really match the resulting output of Dio as a band.\n\nHoly Diver is a continuation in many respects, one that builds off of the astounding musical accomplishments by RJD while working with Rainbow and Black Sabbath. This stands in direct contrast to where Sabbath itself went at the same time with Born Again, an album that could be likened to a musical compromise between the Ozzy years of Sabbath, emulating said icon's subsequent solo work, and Ian Gillian's involvement also providing an incidental element of Deep Purple's sound, which did bring out some of the more epic qualities of the two preceding, Dio fronted albums. In fact, Dio's 1983 debut leans a bit heavier in the direction of the fast, nimbler, and heavier character of British albums of the early 80s that paved the way for thrash metal, as can be observed by the riff happy and aggressive character of Vivian Campbell's guitar work, which is the most distinctive feature of this album save Ronnie's soaring yet gritty vocal display. Indeed, the massive similarities in Campbell's soloing approach and the character of the songs themselves suggest that the front man for which this band was named was likely micromanaging the efforts of each instrumentalist supporting him in order to retain the strong points of Dio's tenure with Sabbath, though Vivian's playing also shares some distinct commonalities with fellow Irish ax man Gary Moore.\n\nThe musical affinity noted previously is arguably at its most blatant here than was the case on all subsequent Dio efforts, but also provides a blueprint from which the more distinct aspects of this band's sound would later emerge. The fast paced, almost speed metal oriented nod to rebellion and individuality \"Stand Up And Shout\" is a bit grittier and faster than \"Neon Knights\" or \"Turn Up The Night\", but it carries the flashy lead gymnastics of the latter as well as the stop and start transitional character of the former. Likewise, the dreary ballad turned fast paced rocker \"Don't Talk To Strangers\" could be subtitled \"Children Of The Sea\" part two, though it cooks a bit more and has a more real world oriented lyrical message despite the heavy use of metaphors. It isn't much of a stretch to draw similar comparisons between the mid-paced anthem to human relations \"Caught In The Middle\" with the similarly rocking, catchy and often panned love song gone wrong \"Walk Away\" off the Heaven And Hell album, not to mention one that would serve as the archetype for Dio's more radio-friendly single material while still carrying more of a hard-edged demeanor. Perhaps the lone Sabbath-styled offering here that doesn't really resemble Dio's handiwork with said band is the closer \"Shame On The Night\", which has a bit more of a bluesy-rocking meets doom metal demeanor that is more in line with 70s Sabbath, and on a side note, is credited with inspiring a number of more epic doom outfits like Solitude Aeturnus.\n\nNot to be tied down solely to the Sabbath years, Ronnie and company find themselves often emulating the exploits of his time in Rainbow, particularly on the more hard-rocking material found here. Crushing mid-paced anthems like \"Gypsy\", \"Straight Through The Heart\" and \"Invisible\" incorporate various aspects of Blackmore's riffing style as heard on the likes of \"Man On The Silver Mountain\" and \"Long Live Rock And Roll\" (two songs that would enjoy regular live play by Dio while touring during the 80s and 90s), though Vivian's more biting guitar tone gives it much more of a metal edge, and his noodling solos retain about as much of an Iommi character as they do on the rest of the songs on here. The latter of these three songs also presents a pretty blatant archetype of the more epic-tinged songwriting where a non-recurring atmospheric intro would be followed by a driving rocker, though \"Invisible\" proves to be more of a chunky, heavy-ended groove machine than a lofty nod to \"Gates Of Babylon\" or \"Temple Of The King\". Even though Vivian's playing proves quite versatile, he along with Ronnie's skyward vocalizations and Vinnie Appice's loose, fill-happy drumming style (very reminiscent of Bill Ward) even lean these songs in more of a Sabbath direction, whereas Jimmy Bain's bass work proves the biggest point of contrast, opting for something a bit more structured than Geezer Butler's traveling, almost improvised sounding bass work for something a tad raunchier but also a tad more disciplined.\n\nAs with any highly ambitious project, while the really interesting stuff tends to happen during the less radio-friendly moments, the most curious songs found on here are the ones that became both MTV and arena staples. The title song \"Holy Diver\" could be likened to an abridged reinterpretation of \"Heaven And Hell\", possessing the same sort of slow-paced galloping feel, but reversing the acoustic outro into a haunting keyboard intro and cutting out the jump in tempo. In essence, this is the same basic song, but featuring most of the emphasis on Dio's vocals and opting for a more standard structure. But ultimately the real point of curiosity here proves to be \"Rainbow In The Dark\", which is essentially the token Dio song that everybody knows and also arguably his only real foray into an 80s pop/rock song. RJD himself had stated that his exodus from Rainbow was largely due to Blackmore's desire to go in a more mainstream rock direction, and that this particular song came off as a little too close to that type of feel. Granted, due to Vivian's biting guitar sound and Bain's raunchy bass work, the song comes off as far heavier than anything that ended up on Difficult To Cure or Straight Between The Eyes, but if those things are taken out of the equation, it runs along fairly similar lines.\n\nThis album's status as a great album, nay, an iconic one, is not really a matter for debate. However, as with many first attempts, it does find itself being ever so slightly rough around the edges and a tinge out of focus. There isn't a single song on here that is found wanting, but as an entire album, it listens a bit more like a reworked compilation of RJD's past. Part of it is the fairly green status of Vivian Campbell, who attempts to throw everything but the kitchen sink at his prospective audience, and while making a good show of things, doesn't come off as disciplined and polished as the rest of the band. To a degree, it is understandable that this would be the go-to album for most metal fans as it is rawer and more aggressive than the rest of Dio's 80s output. Be this as it may, this band's greatest moments were always when staring off into distant magical horizons, and the sound that would be developed on The Last In Line and Dream Evil is where Dio truly came into its own as one of the best, if not the best heavy metal institutions of the 80s. Think of this as the opening chapter of an expansive fantasy novel, it breaks the ice and ropes the reader in, but ultimately doesn't represent the climactic point of the story.\n\n(Rewritten on September 23rd, 2017)\n",
        "\nAlthough the famed George Orwell novel proved a non-prophetic work by the time 1984 came to pass, an air of mystique lingered over this point in heavy metal's history, perhaps best underscored by the massive sonic undertaking that one of the style's founding fathers unleashed unto the masses. While many albums that hit the stands during the year in question touched upon the futuristic totalitarian themes that had permeated the western zeitgeist to varying degrees, Dio's heavily lionized sophomore offering The Last In Line stands apart as fully embracing the Dystopian imagery associated with Orwell's seminal literary work, all the while staying largely in the parameters of a typical 1980s offering. It is a multifaceted venture that finds itself hitting just about every major subject that was on the minds of the masses, filtered through the storytelling lens of heavy metal's most cherished bard, blurring the lines between science fiction, forbidden romance, the fellowship of the scene, living fast, and occasional musings into the events of ancient history.\n\nRelative to Ronnie James' recent past, this album stands as a substantial pivot point towards a sound more readily associated with the high period of 80s rock/metal. The addition of virtuoso keyboardist and Rough Cutt member Claude Schnell to the fold has served to further expand upon the impact-based, hard edged and riff happy template established on Holy Diver, bringing in a degree of depth and atmosphere that dovetails with the Rainbow days. But more significant than the lineup expansion is a far more refined and adventurous stylistic approach that results in an album that is more akin to an anthology of nine independent novellas rather than nine chapters in a singular book. To be clear, Dio never really delved into the arena of concept albums during the 80s as King Diamond did, but there is a unifying theme of triumphing over adversity that emerges with each successive song, barring the occasional interlude into more fatalistic territory, and the resulting musical complexity and intrigue is dwarfed only by the metaphorically rich lyrical content that accompanies it.\n\nTo say that this album is a bit smoother and more palpable to the mainstream of the day would be an accurate statement, but to say that it wants for anything in the aggression department would be a mistake. It's actually a testament to the uniqueness of the mid-80s mainstream that an album of this caliber was a regular staple of both MTV and rock radio, as it still carries many of the hard-hitting early 80s thunder that the American scene had imported from the NWOBHM, yet was a far cry from the posh, glam sound of the Sunset Strip. The guitar work of former Sweet Savage guitarist Vivian Campbell still possesses that nimble, occasionally proto-thrashing character that made his former band an inspiration to Metallica's early years, and proves the linchpin in giving a sense of chaotic spontaneity into what is otherwise a more disciplined and formulaic approach relative to Ronnie's past works. Likewise, there is a greater degree of adventurism to be found in Vinnie Appice's kit work and Jimmy Bain's bass lines that dredge out a latent jamming character comparable to Sabbath's Mob Rules.\n\nIn light of this album having a generally animated and swift character, the imagery of accursed souls rising from the dead to meet a grievous perdition with the Anubis-like specter of Murray (Dio's demonic mascot) adorning the cover could be construed as misleading, at least at first glance. The upbeat anthem of metal camaraderie and optimism \"We Rock\" has all the speedy flair and inspiration of \"Stand Up And Shout\", yet comes off as a bit less raw and more accessible to crowd participation. Likewise, the more rocking grooves of \"Breathless\" and the melodic grandeur mixed with proggy keyboard elements \"Mystery\" come off as tamer offerings more along the lines of what was getting Twisted Sister and WASP in the charts at around the same time. Likewise, the cruising riff extravaganza \"Evil Eyes\" and the almost equally busy anthem of love gone wrong \"Eat Your Heart Out\" come off as a bit mundane, though delivered with a high degree of artfulness and wit so as to stand out pretty far apart from a typical Motley Crue or Ratt offerings.\n\nHowever, there is almost an equal representation of fitting exercises of menacing or otherwise dark metallic splendor present on this album to justify its apocalyptic album art. The quasi-thrashing speed monster \"I Speed At Night\" is arguably the most insane riff display to ever come out of Vivian Campbell's arsenal, and when combined with a vicious vocal display out of Ronnie, culminates in somewhat quite capable of trading blows with Judas Priest's Defenders Of The Faith. The nod to Shakespeare's famed tale of forbidden romance told in an 80s context \"One Night In The City\" bears a faint similarity to \"Holy Diver\" in the riff and pacing department, but showcases a heightened degree of atmospheric development that could qualify it as a more ambitious sequel to said song. But the absolute coup de grace of involved performances and writing go to the unforgettable Dystopian title song \"The Last In Line\", and the slower marching homage to Rainbow's \"Gates Of Babylon\" in \"Egypt (The Chains Are On)\", each fully exploiting Schnell's keyboard expertise to masterful affect while still keeping a strong emphasis on impact.\n\nWhile in the grand scheme of Dio's highly prolific career this isn't quite their magnum opus, it stands as the greatest offering to include Vivian Campbell, both in this context and any other band he would be involved in afterward. It perfectly captures the duality of this band's rawer sound from the previous year and translates into something a bit closer to Rainbow's Rising, i.e. something that is boiling over with excitement yet also elaborate enough to come off as fresh and innovative more than 30 years after it was first conceived. It's in a class all by itself, drawing some occasional comparisons to the post-Randy Rhodes era of Ozzy Osbourne to an extent, particularly with Campbell's scream happy lead guitar work showcasing an uncanny similarity to what Jake E. Lee would bring to The Ultimate Sin and Zakk Wylde would continue with upon replacing the former. But when all is said and done, the measure of a classic is something that can't be mistaken for any of its contemporaries or immediate successors, and it doesn't get much more distinctive than this.\n\n(Rewritten on February 27th, 2020)\n",
        "\nThis is like Dio turning over a new leaf. Of course, Holy Diver and Last In Line were amazingly ground breaking classics with tracks that any live concertgoer could not get enough of. But here we see something that one would have expected to come much earlier just from the types of lyrics that Ronnie writes - a concept album. The best part is, that if you buy the album that coupled with the coverart booklet, there is a seperate booklet that folds out into this massive write out of the story. Likewise, the last track on this album is about 18 and a half minutes, with Ronnie narrating the story. This is much different from other concept albums out there, even though the type of lyrics definitely fit for Dio's music. But the whole theme seems darker and heavier, musically and lyrically, and he uses much less of the \"fire\" and \"higher\" and \"rainbow\" words that he used on past (and present) albums. In fact, the line \"Waiting for my turn to climb upon the cross. Maybe they'll forget about me.\"... It's what the man who wanted Ronnie to take his music in a heavier and darker direction had hoped for for years.\n\nThis album features Craig Goldy on guitar. Now, while Doug Aldrich can play remarkably fast (as can be told on the newest DVD Evil or Divine, or on the track Killing The Dragon's solo) and complexly, he doesn't have the heavy handed guitar work that Craig does. In fact, the only song that Doug screws up on the DVD is the main riff of Fever Dreams, it seems as if only Craig can pull it off. Craig, returning to the band for the first time since the Dream Evil album [and then later returning to do Master of the Moon], lays down some great guitar playing for this album. His solos fit perfectly, (most of them being melodic and very catchy) and while he may not have the chops that alot of other guys have, he definitely falls into the Tony Iommi school of being able to play and write what he does so well that it doesn't matter. On bass is Rainbow and Dio alumni Jimmy Bain, who lays down a very memorable bass line on Lord of the Last Day. Also in the band is Claude Schnell on keyboards, and drummer Simon Wright (ex-AC/DC) who came aboard around the album Lock up the Wolves and is still with the band.\n\nOf course, Ronnie's vocals on this entire album are just as good as they always are (live and in the studio). He is truly an immortal figure in heavy metal, and should be preserved as such for eternity. A definite addition to the so called 'Book of Heavy Metal'.\n\nThe album starts out with Discovery, which features these robot voices, and then it goes into the instrumental Magica Theme. Somewhere in there, Ronnie says the words \"Magica\" in such a perfectly chilling voice, it sets the tone for the album. The instrumental features some great keyboard and guitar rhythm and soloing.\n\nAfter this, the actual songs start with the best track on the album - Lord of the Last Day. This song is so evil, it's great. \"I love the night. So many shadows.\" It helps that this is a very doomy type riff, nice and slow to mid tempo. But better than that, are the vocals. Seriously, Ronnie is a genious, and also definitely took a turn for the better in his lyrics. After this comes Fever Dreams, Turn To Stone, and Feed My Head, which are all great tracks.\n\nThen come Eriel, which starts out almost like a Savatage rock opera, then rather than slamming into a heavy riff, goes into a mid-paced riff with more awesome vocals. Then comes Challis, which makes me think of Ted Nugent's Cat Scratch Fever, and it just is another twist in the songs on the album - though a good one.\n\nAs Long as it's not about Love is next, and followed after it is Losing My Insanity which has a split sound. It's a cross between medieval ministrel music and Blackmore's Night, and it's another great turn for the album. Lots of pinch harmonics in the riff that comes later. After this comes Otherworld (would be Annica if you have the Japanese CD, and it ALSO is a very good track and it's a shame they didn't put it on the US CD...), a decent track but nothing too exciting. \n\nBut then something new to finish out the album, the last two tracks are Magica - Reprise and Lord of the Last Day - Reprise. Wow, it's a great way to start and end the album with the best track on it! It's also something new in the realm of Dio albums. In fact, it makes it seem as if the whole album is one flowing concept medley based inside of Lord of the Last Day. And of course the last track is Dio's reading of the story, which is really an intriguing story of fantasy that sounds even cooler when you listen to him read it. It really sets this album apart from other Dio albums, and with Ronnie himself saying he intends to make Magica II & III as a double album (with Craig, depending on how soon he gets better), it will be interesting to see how that turns out and in what direction that will take the band [and if that will be when Ronnie retires].\n\nSo if you want to hear Dio turned darker and given a core theme to write new lyrics about, you'll probably like this album. In fact, I feel like this is a good point to go to from Black Sabbath's Dehumanizer in terms of giving a facelift to what you'd expect from a band. Also, coupled with a great story (and if you like fantasy or science fiction stories, you'll also probably like this), this album shows that Dio could overcome the skepticism that he wouldn't make a decent concept album. So if you want to jump into another Dio album, then either get Killing The Dragon or Magica - depending on whether you want more Holy Diver and Last In Line type stuff, or if you want something new and different... And heavy as hell!\n",
        "\nThis album features Doug Aldrich on guitar, who not only was Dio's guitarist during Craig Goldy's unexpected absence in 2002 but is also current Dio guitarist because of Craig's unfortunate accident in 2005. But that aside, this album showcases some of his best playing. The entire band was spot on this night, and the recording quality was exceptional. \n\nMy only bone to pick with this album is that 2 tracks from the DVD, Drum Solo and Lord of the Last Day were not on it. I realize that is for time reasons, but they could've easily swapped out Lord of the Last Day for Fever Dreams, since it's the only song Doug didn't quite pull off.\n\nThis album starts with Killing The Dragon, and as usual Ronnie's voice is spot on for a man of so many years. And Doug's guitar playing is even better than in the studio, especially with his killer guitar solo. Then you get solid blocks of Dio classics until you get to Don't Talk To Strangers. This is an amazing track, namely again because of Doug's guitar solo. Vivian Campbell would've shed a tear over how tastefully done Doug did this solo in the same phrasing as he did oh so many years ago. \n\nOne more track, and then you get Doug's guitar solo. Yet again, an amazing guitar solo. You can really tell that he is influenced by guys like Hendrix and Tony Iommi as you listen to the things he plays.\n\nThen another song, and then you get to Fever Dreams. This is where I am sad, becuase Doug kind of screwed up the rhythm and main riff to this song. That's why I think Lord of the Last Day should've been on here, since he didn't screw that song up at all. Needless to say, it's still not too bad.\n\nAfter that comes Holy Diver... Very well done, but it sounds like Ronnie is wearing down just a little (but he bounces back after this song, so no worries). The guitar solo here is too sloppy which is a partial detract. It sounds almost rushed.\n\nThen you get more solid Dio [and Black Sabbath] classics... Notable is Heaven and Hell with it's guitar solo and tempo change, as well as for the extra line of lyrics Ronnie adds in. \n\nBut the show closes with an amazingly upbeat version of We Rock with a great guitar solo with some added \"WE ROCKS\" and \"YOU ROCK\" at the end that make it classic.\n\nSo really, this is almost better than a compilation album, because you get to hear how good the band is in action. Unfortunately when you listen to the CD you can't see all the 'devil horns' that Ronnie flashes on the DVD that seal the deal, but the CD definitely proves that this band can rock hard and throw down with the best of them. If only they had thought a little more about Fever Dreams versus Lord of the Last Day, this album could've been perfect.\n",
        "\nFrom the moment the first guitar screamed through the speakers I new I was in for an aural onslaught of listening pleasure. It was clear that DIO has stepped up the big league in terms of production quality. A winner in every sense of the word and body.\n\nJesus\u2026.. The first track is brilliant, from the lyrics questioning Christianity, the structure of the song and the mood it generates. It blew me away when the guitar impersonated a saw cutting down the cross. The imagery created is first class.\n\nThe title track \u201cStrange Highways\u201d again takes you to the place Ronnie is writing about and the music is the sound track to the movie Ronnie is verbalising. It was at this point I started to think that this is close to the best album I have ever heard. \u201cStrange Highways\u201d gives us a glimpse into the madness that insecurities generated by adult figures can cause,. \u201cI am good for nothing, So they say\u201d. as well as the pressure of structured religion. Man I could really relate to this song.\n\nFirehead and Hollywood Black have the hole band kicking arse. Hard and Heavy. I have never been a big fan of Vinnie Appice (Drums) but he really comes of age. There is not the obvious mistakes that can be found on Mob Rules and Holy Diver. The guitars throughout this album bring the songs to life. I love it. There is so much energy, aggression and thoughtfulness that has gone into not only the guitar planning the songs and production in total. This album comes alive and can really take a hold of you, in more ways than one if you are not careful.\n\n\u201cGive Her A Gun\u201d, spews social justice and you find yourself imagining shooting the bastards yourself. It was so relevant especially with the gang rapes we have been experiencing here in Australia inflicted upon white Australians by the Muslim community. \n\nThe best track on the album to me though is \u201cPAIN\u201d I cannot remember the last time that a song meant so much to me before or since. A huge wall of sound intruduces the song, and like every other track on this album the guitars and bass pound your brain. I am beginning to believe that this album is the soundtrack to my life. It is dark! It is evil and it will get inside your head.\nNot for the faint hearted. \nThere is more depth in this album than his previous outings and I hope he continues on in this direction.\n",
        "\nWhen the word spread about Dio planning a solo project, anxiety aroused. The fans expected it to be just another solo record, filled with songs that did never fit the artist's original band. And so they got Holy Diver. Somehow the album was a meltdown of Ronnie's musical experiences in Black Sabbath, Rainbow, Elf, Elves and whatever his early band was called, spiced with some evolution. Instead of yet another let-down this year just after Judas Priest's and Black Sabbath's golden days, just before Iron Maiden's ditto, we got an album crashing down into our inner, most secrets circles of metal followers, smashing, destroying and wiping away whatever standards there had been before. Holy Diver was like the Flood, in its musically purest and most concentrated form. It literally slayed every album preceding it and wins over more or less every metal albums released afterwards. No band, not Dio, not Maiden, not Priest, has produced an equally great - or better heavy metal album - so far. They probably won't either.\n\nHoly Diver was recorded back in the day when one still had to take special measures because of the constraints of the LP format. One always puts the best songs on side A. While both sides are pretty damn flawless, A sure is the best side. That's where the title song is. As you all know, or should all know, it starts with a mystic, atmospheric intro like a weak wind blowing in a mist, then comes keyboards bringing a dramatic touch, sound effects somewhat like whales' communication - and then what's most probably the best song ever kicks in.\n\nLike most of the Holy Diver songs, Holy Diver itself is a classic. Even after all these albums, all these years it's the only song played at every gig. Let me try telling you why. This is the recording on which Dio does his best effort ever, sounds better than ever before and ever after. There's some serious passion, the man gives it all. But most important is the fact that this is most probably the point where his vocal cords were at their best.\n\nAnd then the guitars. While Craig Goldy never was a bad guitarist, he never was as good as Vivian Campbell. Especially when Vivian Campbell does his very best as he did on Holy Diver. Then Mr. G has a lesser chance than that of a snowball in hell, seeing he might play the stuff but song writing and throwing together riffs never were his strong cards. Oh yeah, riffs. Holy Diver is almost like a thrash record, coming to that respect. There are loads and loads with great, competent and varied riffs in here. Wobbling, hardrockish, fast, and circular - the man does it all.\n\nThe guitars are what many metalheads of today would call melodic, just because they aren't as overly downtuned as death metal guitars. But I assure you; no crunch doesn\u2019t exactly equal no good. Because this is good. Campbell never resorts to the easy ways, no power chords in here. At simplest he's tapping the melody or plays a slower riff. And then there are solos too. It's cool how they combine keyboard chords with the high guitar tones at times. Oh yes, the organic guitar sound of the eighties leaves nowadays' production models standing in the corner.\n\nJimmy Bain does the bass, and who'll complain? He's clearly audible, all time, and do most of the rhythmic work, especially in the two stompier tracks Gypsy and Invisible.\n\nVinny Appice, the drummer, is the last man aboard. Steady, no echoes, no double bass, instead something I love: A varied sound, having a big set, using different drums in nice rhythmical patterns, never louder than the guitars. The cooperation of drums and guitars is amazing. At times the guitars seem like flowing, levitating and dancing upon the power of the drums. This is especially true on the last of the three real classics' Holy Diver, Don't Talk to Strangers and Rainbow in the Dark.\n\nKeyboards are played by Ronnie himself, just accompanying the general sound, providing intros and effects at a few places, not like quite a few bands nowadays having more or less stationary synths (cough Iron Maiden cough Rhapsody cough) or more or less rely on them (cough Children of Bodom cough Bal-Sagoth cough).\n\nAnyone with heavy metal in his veins shouldn't have to read this (or other) reviews. He should already have the record in a prominent place, preferably an extra stereo so that he never removes it from the record player. Holy Diver is one of the few real essential albums.\n",
        "\nDio is like a machine going on for eternity, ever releasing records, ever singing like a god with built-in speakers and double amps. Master of the Moon is his best album for a long, long time and while it's not better than the debut and just questionably better than Last in Line, it's the release that's hardest to grow tired of. We miss the usual highlight (which has become synonymous with the title track), but then there have never been so few and so small fluctuations in quality between the songs before.\n\nThe sound feels like Strange Highways revisited, compared to Killing the Dragon the music is much slower, darker and heavier. Yet it doesn\u2019t lose the energetic, pumping beat to back it up. And that\u2019s what Master of the Moon is \u2013 a splendid, crushing beat back there, as well as guitars and bass that have been made more audible than ever before. It\u2019s rasping and hard, imagine the dark, pounding bass rhythms with gleaming power chords\u2026 It\u2019s nice to have Craig Goldy back again. He makes the guitar sound stay dark and heavy; yet let it change forms over the songs. It goes through the full scale from raw and menacing to somber and thoughtfully pondering to exploring, searching and feeling. And that\u2019s a hell of a difference when comparing with the dry stick that Doug Aldrich was.\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s a little too few riffs, but it just adds to the atmosphere. The tapping solos are simpler than what he uses to do, but oh, boy do they fit. Keyboards are just there to provide the sound with some extra atmosphere every now and then; they\u2019re more remote than apparent. The songs end slowly, fading away, keeping their punchiness, heaviness and catchiness all the way to the end.\n\nAs always Dio\u2019s voice makes for the most important and prominent instrument. One seriously starts wondering if he\u2019ll ever have a bad day, if he\u2019ll ever do badly. He didn\u2019t this time, after all. Instead we get what might be one of his best performances. We get the best range and power that metal can offer packaged in that tiny body. As with Strange Highways, the sadder and more introspective songs, give his voice this thick twist, bringing a mercantile of emotions into the listener\u2019s ears.\n\nMany have called Master of the Moon a doom metal album. It\u2019s exaggerated. Even End of the World, which basically deals with the doomsday, is more about sadness and fright than the final fall of the Earth. This is just some dark heavy metal, where \u2018dark\u2019 is just a describing aesthetic, no genre classification.\n\nI like it. Whereas none of the songs will ever take the titles away from Holy Diver, Last in Line, Rainbow in the Dark and so on, the album still is more quality-work than any of his earlier records. There could\u2019ve been some faster song, raising the tempo a bit, but the way it\u2019s now will definitely pass. There\u2019s more room for the melodies and rhythms to mellow, ripe, blossom than ever before \u2013 they can live their own life, in a sense. It\u2019s like Dio didn\u2019t feel that every song had to have a catchy chorus, like one can experience from a few of his earlier productions. They just happened to be this time. It\u2019s questionable whether Master of the Moon really is the best Dio album, but I know for sure that it\u2019s the hardest to grow tired of. I can spin this cutie an infinite number of times.\n",
        "\nAfter being exposed to a couple of songs by Dio them being \"Holy Diver\" and \"Rainbow in the Dark\" I decided it was high time that I buy an album by Dio. I was able to find \"Killing the Dragon\" for $5.99. Ironically enough the album was actually brand new, and sealed. Whoever got it must have lost the CD and didn't want it anymore.\n\nI must say that as a whole this album is pretty good and impressive. The guitars, bass, drums, and vocals combine together to make some impressive heavymetal with power elements. Unfortunately the first half of this album is plagued by bits cheesiness tossed all around. Seriously, listen to the song \"Killing the Dragon\" and tell me that does not sound like a song they would play for the intro of a cartoon show called \"Dragon Slayers\".\n\nHell, I can even picture the damn sequence being played along with music. It's not a good sign when you can imagine in vivid detail a song being played as a children's show tune.\n\nFrom \"Killing the Dragon\" to \"Better in the Dark\" these songs seem to suffer the show tune sound. Perhaps it's the overblatant happy beats in the songs that give the songs this effect. The guitars and bass seem to be tuned awfully high, and give these songs a sickenly happy feel to them. \n\nBefore the entire album turns into a syrupy cheeseball cutesy hugfest the song \"Rock & Roll\" comes on. The heavy/power metal is still here, but now the sounds are much darker and the guitars and bass sound as if though they have been tuned lower than previous songs. The vocals have also become more resolved and not as happy sounding. From this song foward all of the songs have gone from sickenly happy, to happy, to slightly depressing/happy.\n\n\"Throw Away Children\" has some of the best drum work on the entire album, and is another surpisingly catchy song.\n\nThe first half of this album gets an 80% the second half gets a 90% for an average score of 85/100\n\nSerious Metal: Rock and Roll, Throw Away Children, Guilty\nShow Tune Metal: Killing the Dragon, Along Came a Spider\n",
        "\nWhile having quite a cool cover, Intermission stands out as the most boring release Dio have ever done. It stands out as one of the most boring albums in my collection. Five live tracks, whereof one medley, performed well but recorded with more than lacking production and sound quality. While showing the Dio band\u2019s contact with the crowd, these tracks also show some unnecessary wankery \u2013 both with guitar and voicewise. It\u2019s actually more wanking than you\u2019ll find on an average live album. It was probably quite cool when he did it at the show, but here, on a recording it just turns out boring. You very seldom hear the crowd but not because they weren\u2019t enthusiastic, no because of the bad production. \n\nTime To Burn, the only new track, is a weak one. It sounds more rock than anything else. It\u2019s no pumping, it just plays from one end to another and you don\u2019t notice it was there. Nothing catchy, no incredible musicianship, no killer vocals\u2026 The song doesn\u2019t even progress \u2013 it\u2019s just plain boring. Then the medley kicks off and Claude Schnell, the keyboardist (also on Sacred Heart and Dream Evil) looses it. His keyboards don\u2019t sound and when they do it\u2019s not right either. He gets it back later, but putting such sloppy performances on a live release is kind of lame. All in all this EP is bad, unnecessary, and no one except a diehard Dio-fan will like it. Saying that, I am one myself and I dislike it. And the fact that an original pressing from 1986 could await me in the year of 2004, completely new at a major record dealer reveals everything. Buy the full-lengths instead.\n",
        "\nMaster of the Moon. A come back for Dio? No, seeing as how he is still up there in the metal world, and that he never has come down. Master of the Moon is a good album nonetheless. It seems as though Dio has gone back to his Doom side, which explains why most of the songs are slow.\n\nThere are two types of guitar riffs on this album. The frist type is the slow, doom like kind. There are a couple of songs that are super slow. Some examples are The Man Who Would Be King and The Eyes. These are your typical doom metal songs. Slow, crunching riffs, that are filled with evil. The other type of guitar riff is a medium paced guitar riff. These riffs are crunched with some pretty cool palm muting. The Shiver displays this style the best. In fact, these three songs I have mentioned have some pretty memorable riffs. Some other good riffs are the main verse to Living a Lie and chorus to One More For the Road. \n\nThere are some other driving forces to this album. Adding Jeff Pilson\u2019s style of bass guitar is a plus for this album. There are a lot of driving forces behind the bass guitar, some nice bass leads, and Pilson does what he does best \u2013support the music. The drumming is well done, and so is the keyboards. The only time that the keyboards actually leaped out at me was in the song The Eye. It does this cool effect now and then in the song that gives it some more characterization. \n\nThe best thing about this album is Dio\u2019s singing. The man hasn\u2019t lost it. Dio\u2019s voice is just like Dio on Holy Diver. So if you like Dio\u2019s style of singing then you will like this. The best way to describe this album is like tacking Dio\u2019s Black Sabbath work, mixing it with Killing the Dragon. So If you like the slow, evil, doom metal style of Dio, or you just like Killing the Dragon, then you will enjoy this new piece of heavy metal.\n",
        "\nYes, from the other two reviews you can probably tell that this album is goddamn slow. But Dio never did an entire album of \"Stand Up And Shout\"-type songs, there's always been your midtempo \"Invisible\" and \"Shame On The Night\" type songs, it's just that on this album these slower tunes are far more dominant than on Dio's classic material, and these songs are not quite as good as his mid tempo classics like (think \"The Last In Line\" or \"Egypt (The Chains Are On)\"). This one's also quite heavily keyboard influenced, but it's for the most part used to quite good effect- see title track. The biggest problem I have with this new Dio CD is not the lack of speed metal ferocity, when I want that I'll go to Sodom. The thing is, the guitarwork here is rather pathetic for the album of a Heavy Metal legend such as Ronnie James Dio.\n\nMany of the songs have a pretty solid base of guitar riffs and nothing that stands out as awkwardly bad, but nothing that blasts out and make you go \"Fuck yeah, that's metal!\" either. The guitars mostly stay in the background and don't do much at all, and there certainly seems to be something lacking all through the album.\nStill, songs like \"The End of the World\" and \"One More For The Road\" has enough solid guitarwork to keep the song rocking, it just isn't enough to create any metal classics. That's pretty much what this is, just another metal record among them. Nothing groundbreaking, no modern classic, just another fun addition to your metal CD collection.\n\n\nI'd start with pointing out the definite highlights of the album. Two songs stand out above them all - First off, the rocking opening track \"One More For The Road\" is possibly the fastest song on here, catchy as hell, vintage Dio, with his classic powerful vocals delivering punchy, memorable vocal lines that stick easily to your mind. \"Nice day for a crucifixion!\" Hell yeah, it is. And the other standout being \"I Am\", a midtempo track with an overall great mood and the catchiest chorus on here, a blast to sing along to. \"I am, I am stronger than the wind!\" Nice lyrics too, and overall a powerful track.\nAlso, \"Master of the Moon\" is pretty fun. The opening is bizarre with a bunch of different effects before the song starts going into an odd heavily synthesized vers accompanied with Dio's as usual very good and insightful lyrics, and overall this song has a pretty cool atmosphere and is a real grower. So is the whole album, in fact, it's gotten alot better since my first listen.\n\"The End of the World\" also kicks ass, and has one of those melodies that just Dio can make, that just somehow makes you feel real good, although the lyrics seem to have a pretty depressive perspective on rock n' roll these days, which makes sense since Dio somehow has failed to notice that it's all alive and well. But still, a damn good song. \n\nThere's quite a bunch of odd songs here, like the heavily synthesized \"Shivers\" and also \"The Eyes\", mostly remarkable for the bizarre and rather annoying guitar effects. These aren't bad songs, but rather mediocre.\nOverall, there's good stuff and there's less good stuff, but nothing I'd say is downright bad, except possibly the slow \"The Man Who Would Be King\", which just doesn't get anywhere, and features the most boring guitarwork on here.\n\nStill, hardcore Dio fans should get this, if you can tolerate the obvious lack of speed metal on here and give the midtempo tunes some time to sink in. Nothing extraordinary unfortunately with the tenth Dio studio album, the best part is probably the awesome album cover which reminds me of this old video game, \"Illusion of Time\", which kicks ass. But I'll find some more nerdy place to rave about that.\n",
        "\nFirst, let me say, there are no filler tracks on this album and second: This album will not grab you right away! Give it 6 or 7 spins and you will love it, not fasted paced, but certainly a masterpiece. Now to the review: \n\nOpening with \"One More For The Road\" which is a fast paced rocker. Fantastic start, and as stated by Warlord, it would be great opening live. The lyrics are about the Witch Hunts, but could easily be applied to modern day society with our eagerness to condemn people for crimes before trial etc. Just alternate interpretation though, as Ronnie himself said it was about the Witch Hunts. \n\nThen onto the title track. Have you ever heard a weak title track by Dio? No? Well then you may continue waiting as this one ROCKS! Strong Magica influences, and could easily fit on Magica II. Slow pace, fantastic song, great lyrics, everything is amazing (just like the rest of the album). I really like Jeff's bass on this song in particular though I think his bass is great the whole way through. \n\nTrack Three is probably the weakest in my opinion because the music isn't really doomy enough for the lyrics, and I'm not so keen on the AC/DC-ish riff (which doesn't dominate the second half, which I find much more enjoyable as a result). I say it is the worst, but it by no means bad, just less memorable than the others (but the end is great). It is a good song, but it just isn't my thing for one reason or another that I can't put my finger on. \n\nShivers is next and it has a great chorus. Slow/Mid pace with a killer riff and excellent keyboards by Scott Warren. The lyrics could be considered a bit cheesy I suppose, but I love them, especially at the end. An excellent track, and I'm sure it would be a strong contestant for best on the album. \n\nThe Man Who Would Be King is another slow paced song (good thing I LOVE slower paced songs) that deals with a certain American president we all know, but it doesn't have to be taken that way, as it could also deal with the crusades in the middle ages (as it was originally written). \n\nThe Eyes!! I was lucky enough to hear this song live in Glasgow on his tour an it blew me away. The studio version has the same effect. I'll have to agree with everyone else who has written a review and say that it is destined to become a Dio classic and hopefully a live show staple. Lyrics deal with a very paranoid person and the end is very geared toward live shows. Personally I think the end isn't as good in the studio version as it drags just a tad too long for me personally, but it doesn't detract from the song as a whole. \n\nLiving the Lie is another fasted paced song. Ronnie puts allot of effort into the vocals of this song and it probably has one of the most \"air-guitar\" solos on the album (at least I find myself playing along with it lol). Don't know what I can say about the rest of the song. Solid riff, great bass and drums, just an all round good song. \n\nI Am is the little brother of I from Dehumanizer lyrically, but not as heavy musically. Another Slow/Mid paced song with a really strong chorus and good solo by Craig. [As a side note, while all of Craig's solos are very good, very few of them jump out at you like Doug's, which I think is better, but if you listen to them you hear they are enjoyable!!] \n\nDeath by Love is another stand out track for me. Mid paced song that just rocks! I adore the riff and the chorus. The lyrics are very \"Lady Evil\" and slightly Alice Cooper-esque. I can't say much more about it other than I love it. \n\nIn Dreams is the closer and it is very good. It's much stronger than Cold Feet from KTD as a closer. It is not one of the best songs on the album, but still a very solid rocker and an excellent closer. \n\nIn closing I would say that MOTM is my favourite DIO album, and may in time overtake the Dio-Sabbath albums and Rainbow albums, but it has yet to do that. The secret weapon of this album is Scott Warren. He adds atmosphere to all of the songs and fits in very well. My compliments to him for a fine job done!!! I liked this album on first listen, giving it a place in the top half of all Dio's releases i.e. good, but not a masterpiece, but on second and third listens it jumped WAY up that list and is now the best of his releases with DIO. KTD was quite weak in my opinion with only 3 songs that held any interest, but I expected good things from this album and it payed off.A far cry from KTD and Sacred Heart (two rather boring albums with the exception of a few songs.) \nThe style is not really all that similar to Strange Highways or Dehumanizer, or even Magica or Dream Evil. It is just the combination of all of the albums he has ever done. It is, to my mind at least, a new sound unto itself, though if you didn't like the above named albums for their slower pace, then this may not be your cup of tea, though I'm sure you will still enjoy it if you pick up a copy and give it a few spins to get into it.\n",
        "\nRonnie James Dio is truly a living legend within metal, and \u201cMaster of the Moon\u201d is a milestone for the band. It is his 10th solo studio album and I certainly had high hopes for it \u2013 most thanks to the excellent cover and title. But sadly the music didn\u2019t reach my hopes; \u201cMaster of the Moon\u201d is a rollercoaster, ups and downs and plenty of strange twists.\n\nThe first track doesn\u2019t let you down for a second though. \u201cOne More for the Road\u201d is a middle-fast rocker, which is easy listened and fun. \n\nTrack number two is a much sadder story \u2013 the title track is actually really unbearable. It is slow, with taunting guitars, which tries to set a certain mood, but fails instantly. The vocals from Dio are also totally worthless \u2013 he sounds bored, which I become too, and I can\u2019t hear one interesting melody through the whole song. The guitar riffs continue in their slow, boring, uninteresting style and never stop to irritate me.\n\n\u201cThe End of the World\u201d is a much more joyful piece of music. It\u2019s slow, but still much better vocals, some nice melodies and the guitar riffs are set straight again. \n\nThen we hear \u201cShivers\u201d. I love this song \u2013 it\u2019s friggin\u2019 wonderful. The cool guitar/synth riffs which appear in the chorus are brilliant, and the regular drums and guitars give the song a very appealing drive. \n\n\u201cThe Man Who Would Be King\u201d starts with some singing and a piano, which sounds like David Bowie. Very good! Then comes the guitar riffs and the drums, which shows that we\u2019re going to hear a mid-tempo song once again. This is a very disturbing song to listen to; the verses contain boring riffs, pale drumming and weak singing, but the bridge and chorus is very nice with very good melodies. It feels like two different songs, the verses and choruses are completely different.\n\n\u201cThe Eyes\u201d is opened with some modern strange guitar sounds, and I hate it! They pop up now and then in the song, which otherwise is quite boring (my god, just boring songs on the album?). This song faces the same problem as the others: good choruses, but bad verses. I can\u2019t figure out why Dio does it so, but it\u2019s problem all right.\n\nThe album is saved by another fast song. \u201cLiving a Lie\u201d is started with great, fast guitar riffs. The whole song is great \u2013 this is Dio in his right element! He should skip all those mid-tempo stuff and just go straight for the fast stuff. This shows what he can do.\n\nTrack number eight is another mid-tempo song, which I by now have been fed up with. \u201cI Am\u201d is one of the better ones though, which finally sound like \u201cone\u201d song. It\u2019s not anything very memorable, but I still like it. \n\n\u201cDeath by Love\u201d is not very good either. A short description could be: boring, just like so many other songs on this album. By now I am really fed up with all these med-tempo songs, need I say more?\n\nThe album is closed by \u201cIn Dreams\u201d and can you guess what!? Another mid-tempo track, just as boring as any other. I just shake my head in disbelief. How can Dio \u2013 the metal legend \u2013 set himself in this position?\n\nI have mentioned one word more than any other and that is a perfect description of the album; boring. Most of the time there are boring riffs, no cool and rocky melodies and just a slow, dull tempo. It feels as if the album never really starts, it just stands still and doesn\u2019t reach anywhere. Even though there are one or two good mid-tempo and slow songs, most of them are not living up to Dio\u2019s normal standard. \n\nThere are some really good songs \u2013 \u201cOne More for the Road\u201d, \u201cThe End of the World\u201d, \u201cShiver\u201d and \u201cLiving a Lie\u201d, but only four songs can\u2019t save this album. I am disappointed, really disappointed\u2026\n",
        "\nStrange Highways has to be one of the most underrated and underappreciated Dio albums ever. Stuck in with Dio's so called \"political albums,\" the music never was served justice. People wanted songs of rainbows, and instead got songs about Dio's inner struggles. Who cares what the material is about; listen to the music, which is what I am going to look at.\n\nStrange Highways is a bit strange for Dio's own musical style. It centers around a more powerful, heavy guitar sound, giving it a very evil and wicked sound. In fact if you look at Dio's past work, nothing even comes close to being this heavy. That is for Dio's solo career. This album tends to take a lot of what is put out on Dio's Black Sabbath stuff. I am pretty positive that if you like Mob Rules and Dehumanizer, especially the latter, then you will like this album a lot. \n\nNow for the music itself. The guitar riffs shine extremely brilliant on this album. For the most part the riffs are typical slow, doom metal riffs. Even if the riffs aren't doom centered, they still have that presence of doom (evil) because the riffs are so heavy. This can be seen on songs like One Foot In the Grave and Blood From A Stone.\n\nOne concept that works well on this album is the drum beats intermixing with the guitar riffs, which is most often seen in doom metal. The fact is that this album gets it done. On the openining track and Firehead, this is seen orchestrated well - as well as Here's To You and many other songs on this album. \n\nThough there are no Dio hits on this album, that should not alter you from getting this album. This album is filled with awesome guitar riffs. The album is pure evil with its doom metal style. More like Dehumanizer than any other Dio album. Each song offers at least a good riff and or moment. Plus with the wonderful voice of Dio, what more could you ask for? Dio's voice is solid perfect on this album, in fact maybe better than some of his past material. I especially licked Dio's voice on Here's To You, which comes off super strong. \n\nGreat album, with a lot of great tunes, regardless if they are hits or not. Passing up on this album would be a mistake; for all Dio's fans and fans of heavy metal!\n",
        "\nThe mere fact that few would be able to recall Dio's more recent discography sure shows that the legend latest albums failed to to make much an impression. But a Dio fun never gives up. \n\nMaster of the Moon is an uncomplicated effort with direct songs and a straighforward production that I appreciated very much (because it is easy to get tired after so many overproduced metal albums). Dio's voice is high on the mix, but he is singing very well. The band is strong, but never occupy the spotlight. Craig Goldy's solos, for instance, although excellent, fail to impress those looking for guitar magazine pages. Simon Wright is very predicable, as always, but nonetheless a solid pair with Rudy Sarzo's bass wich comes very contained.\n\nThe album is short at 46 minutes (and there is a sensation that the last song was a filler to make it at least over 40). But the truth is: as the fashion points again to 40 minutes albums, the condensation certainly makes Master of the Moon better than it would be on a 70 minutes album. It is just a very decent effort, absolutely metal, loud, but at a slow place.\n\nOpener is the quickest one and after just a few bars you have the chorus, which means Dio was looking for memorable melodies. After the third spin, I could say that this objective is achieved and I kept Master of the Moon on my player for half a dozen more spins before offering the place to a newcomer. \n\nBY MetalBrazil\n",
        "\nDio really slipped and fell on this one. The production is thin compared to the legendary first two records, the songwriting is entirely hit or miss and the overall feeling is one of a cliched band that just happened to claim an amazing frontman. Needless to say, Dio showed his first-ever signs of weakness on the CD. It's not without it's merits, but compared the storied first-half of his career this record is a shocking dissapointment. \n\nThere are at least four killer tracks on this CD. \"King of Rock and Roll\" has some great riffs and melodies, the title track bears an epic feel, and \"Just Another Day\" stand out well enough...but the rest sounds weak and uninspired. Dio was often the best of the best, here he represents the most predicatable of the most predictable. Where he should have taken the reigns from Ozzy as the \"king of metal\" he released a record that put metal back at least five years. \n\nDio is a great musician but his solo career has been riddled with constant missteps and backslides into being in a total state of befuddlement as to what is his best and what is his worst. Often times he becomes so \"out of touch\" with his gifts that a record like this will appear and shock the world with how lifeless it is. This also marked the first time that sales for the Dio product would decline, as fans also noticed this lack of quality.\n\nDio will always be \"the man\"...but one has to screen his many albums carefully before he invests his hard earned dollar. If you're a Dio fanatic...the few excellent songs will be enough to keep you happy. If you're just a casual fan or a lover of 80's metal this might not do it. I'd even say \"skip it\" and pick up \"Holy Diver\" and \"Last in Line\" as those are vastly superior to this piece of partial-junk.\n",
        "\nAs an icon of metal, ol' Ronnie has his reputation set in stone. Nothing he could do now can damage his reputation or the admiration that the metal masses bear him. That lion-like roar is part of the essential DNA of the genre, an everflowing stream connecting metal's murky past to its foggy future.\n\nOn the flipside, alas, the image most people have of Dio is just as impermeable and changes little over time. Most people could care less about the crushing heaviness of Lock Up the Wolves and Strange Highways, the pure finesse of Dream Evil and Magica. For them, the buck stopped at Sacred Heart, or for the more cynical perhaps The Last in Line. As evidenced by this live set, Dio is very much aware of this fact.\n\nA pair of Sabbath numbers (nothing modern mind you), three Rainbow classics, and a Deep Purple cover round out a collection that highlights the seminal Holy Diver and Last in Line records, and not a lot else. Well, actually there are a number of songs from the generic Angry Machines record, but they're unremarkable to the point of being filler. In fact, it's possible that the only reason that the emphasis is so heavy on the old stuff is so that Vinnie Appice needn't bother learning any of the stuff done during his absence.\n\nWhile I can't entirely snub an album with over twenty-five years of metal classics in its grubby wizard's fist, the majority of the performances seem to lack fire and inspiration. Tracy G's guitar solo is truly 'boring as fuck', and the man absolutely slaughters \"The Last in Line\". The song can't be that tough to play, but is it so hard to stick to the damn song and not attempt to fill every single space with guitar squeals? Let it breathe!\n\nI have similar derision towards this version of \"Man on the Silver Mountain\". Dio (the band) has NEVER gotten this song right, as the band seems intent on upsetting the measured alchemy and pacing that made this song so perfect by turning into irritating half-thrash. Worse, the classic phrasing in this song is rendered obsolete and Ronnie is forced to sing in a way that just seems so,,, off. I've heard the Dio interpretation of the song many times, and I'm still unable to sing along with it. It just fails.\n\nI've gotta say though, the more rip-snortin' mid-tempo juggernauts in the Dio catalogue really pull their considerable weight here. \"Straight Through the Heart\" is a behemoth, \"Holy Diver\" actually plays to G's love of the squeal, and \"Jesus, Mary, and the Holy Ghost\" features a positively gothic performance from the main man (goblin?). Hell, even \"Double Monday\" works passably. Unfortunately this features one of the weaker versions of \"Heaven and Hell\" on record. The song should be one of peaks and valleys, but this one just plods until Appice decides to give the group a nice boot in the rear to get thigs moving. You really start to miss songs like \"Dream Evil\" and \"Lock Up the Wolves\" because I am convinced they would just explode on this stage.\n\nI tend to hate meandering jams on my live records, but \"Misunderstood/Catch the Rainbow\" is just perfect. Sensible guitar solo's, a really dreamy feel, and just a solid groove that gives Ronnie plenty of time to show off. Does he ever... this is easily one of his best performances to date, emphasizing the underused lighter side of his vocal repertoire, truly soulful and moving which, however effusive the praise laid at this or that front man's door, is truly a rare gift in the genre we all know and love.\n\nIn summation, Sabbath's Live Evil or Dio's recent DVD release would be much better representations of the band's live majesty. For the collector only.\n\nStand-Outs: \u201cStraight Through the Heart\u201d, \u201cMisunderstood/Catch the Rainbow\u201d, \u201cHoly Diver\u201d\n",
        "\nThis is hands down one of Dio's heaviest albums, from the drums, to the sludgy, chugging guitar sound, to the overall production which seems to emphasize the sheer power in each respective instrument. The band seems to favor a Black Sabbath-like sound in the way that it's slow, sludgy, somewhat hypnotizing, but monstrously heavy and very take-no-prisoners. I'm not suprised this album took that direction, since this album follows the Black Sabbath album \"Dehumanizer\", which saw Ronnie James Dio return to the Sabbath fold....only to leave again. So, alot of this material could've been on \"Dehumanizer\" and I wouldn't be suprised if the bulk of these songs were in fact, written for that album.\nHowever, with this new emphasis on heaviness, it does sacrifice some of the catchy melodies that were prominant in Dio's earlier albums. So, you have a heavier album, but not quite as catchy as, say, \"Holy Diver\".\nBut does this make this album bad? Why, no. It doesn't. As a matter of fact, i would easily put this up there with as one of Dio's best albums, along with \"Holy Diver\" and \"Last In Line\". Now, on to the music.\n\nHighlights include the haunting \"Jesus, Mary And The Holy Ghost\",\"Hollywood Black\", with it's grinding feel and again, the anger is very alive in this song. The title track is bar none the ultimate highlight of the album for me. It starts off, light, dreamy and very ballad-like, then suddenly, turns into a dark, dirty, ugly, slow and heavy rocker with some of Ronnie's angriest vocals ever. This song also has some nice bass lines from ex-Dokken bassist Jeff Pilson and some great riffage by Tracy G. Easily one of Dio's finest moments.\n\"One Foot In The Grave\" could have easily been a Black Sabbath song, with a very Sabbath-like melody and lumbering feelthroughout the song. Good stuff.\nAnd \"Give Her The Gun\" is a song that swings back and forth from gentle ballad to crushing rocker a few times throughout the song, but this is another one of my favorites off the album.\n\n\"Strange Highways\" is essential listening for any fan of Ronnie James Dio,but again, be warned, this is not the usual Dio album. It's got a heavier, more crushing,angry and sludgy sound than his other albums, but it shouldn't disappoint any of his fans, as this is one of his finest moments.\n",
        "\nRonnie James Dio is perhaps the greatest voice in metal, and by 1984 he seemed unstoppable. After three early metal classics with Rainbow (namely Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow, Rising, Long Live Rock 'n' Roll plus On Stage), a pair of what have to be considered Sabbath's top efforts in Heaven and Hell and Mob Rules (plus the magnificent Live Evil), and then one of metal's most incredible debuts with his solo band's Holy Diver, Ronnie could do no wrong. Well, we thought so anyway.\n\nThe Last in Line is by no means a bad record, it's just a step down from the truly magical string of releases I rattled off above. Actually, this is a very interesting album because it invokes an imaginary version of 80's metal that didn't really exist outside of this. This is basically THE generic metal record that people think of from this period, with tons of guitar squeals, air drummable fills, and fleet-fingered guitar runs, all fronted by a manlier-than-manly voiced bellower who splits his time between magic, sex, cars, and magic. Unfortunately as entertaining as that is sometimes, it doesn't make a particularly consistent or high-quality listen.\n\nStill, this album comes out of the gates as strong as any I've come across, implying that this Ronnie-come-lately(sorry) has subscribed to the Bob Rock school of ordering songs. Simply put, the absolute cream of the crop is thrown out early, providing a start that makes you think that the little (very, very little) rocker who could is gonna continue that unparalleled streak. \"We Rock\" is probably the best speed metal in the Dio catalogue, and an able follow up to the pedigree of triumphs like \"A Light in the Black\", \"Kill the King\", \"Neon Knights\", and \"The Mob Rules\". For 1984 this is actually pretty technically complex, probably one of Viv Campbell's best all around performances on that wonderful solo and tricky riff, with Appice and Bain rock solid underneath. It's your typical RJD lyric, but it approaches the point where his woeful poetry actually becomes profound and powerful (see \"Heaven and Hell\" or \"Long Live Rock 'n' Roll\"), although the brainless chorus chokes off that possibility. I mean, people have been calling themselves the bearers of the majesty of ROCK'N'ROLL (oooh yeeeah!) for ages, and the shtick has worn thin. Gotta hand it to Dio though for assembling a pretty brainy piece of music underneath the st00pidity, and if it's Ronnie singing I'll probably buy it.\n\nAlthough I rag on this album now and then, there is no denying the power of the title track. \"The Last in Line\" is not only the best song on this album, it's also better than anything on the godly Holy Diver record, and it's also better than anything he would write afterwards. THIS is a quality example of Dio's impassioned parables reaching for the stars and pulling them down to earth to power some of the finest metal known to man. That intro is pure class, Ronnie proving that he is a versatile singer and going all mellow with less of the self-conscious drama that he occasionally seemed to force in Sabbath. But you know it won't last long, and the build up to that glorious golden explosion is practically unequalled in rock music. Really.\n\nThe up tempo riff is a fine piece of metal, circling the vocal melodies, advancing and retreating before it rises up to do battle with Ronnie over that impassioned chorus. This is also a great example of when Dio uses keyboards in a non-ridiculous fashion, plunging along under that formidable riff rather than dripping sugar over it (no offence \"Rainbow in the Dark\"). The solo is less refined than most of the others here, but the raw edge and obvious chops help to push it up to a level with the rest of this masterwork. Still, the important thing is Ronnie here, and he is at his absolute scenery-chewing peak.\n\n\"Breathless\" is another speedy rocker, not quite \"We Rock\" but pretty good. The riff chunks impressively but generically, and the lyrics are just sort of there. Really Ronnie, these rhymes just sound forced. \"Cause you're Breathless, ready to burn/Breathless, the circle still turns/Breathless, willing to learn/You're Breathless\". The circle still turns? What the hell is that supposed to mean? Well, at least he doesn't talk about rainbows. Oh wait, he does. However, I love that intro which features some experimentation with samples, something Ronnie usually avoided. All in all, fun but sorta meh.\n\nI do really like \"I Speed at Night\" though. It's short (3:32) and extremely punchy, a very eventful roller coaster with another snarly Ronnie performance. The lyrics again make no sense to anyone but Ronnie, but one of the finest vocal moments comes towards the end of the song when Ronnie grits out \"You've got some stair to heaven, you may be right/I only know in my world, I hate the light!\" Hell yeah, that is metal to the rotten core right there.\n\nWe take an interlude from the speed metal with \"One Night in the City\", which proves once again that Ronnie is no William Shakespeare, particularly on this fumbled attempt to retell the story of Romeo and Juliet. Still, I applaud the fact that this sounds different, and this is a compelling argument in favour of the decision to hire a keyboardist rather than have Ronnie try to do it himself. On my first few spins I found it to sugary, but now I like the epic flavour and hard driving riffery that makes itself felt underneath the keys. I mentioned the silly narrative, but Ronnie rescues it with his usual serious delivery that undermines the camp value, particularly on the great break in the middle with the twinkly keys.\n\n\"Evil Eyes\" is yet more widdly speed metal, and contributes to the problem of songs sounding too much alike. This is a bit too heavy on the guitar squeals (did Tracy G sneak into the studio?!), and the chorus doesn't have a great hook. There isn't much to say about it. Oh, and he talks about rainbows some more.\n\nGah. The biggest misfire on the record, and the most blatant sell-out attempt in Ronnie's career thus far, though emphatically not the last. This basically attempts to rewrite \"Rainbow in the Dark\", but fails to capture either the whimsy of that iconic keyboard line nor the dark majesty of the riff. This song is pathetic in every way, and it isn't even catchy. The chorus is idiotic, the lyrics are poor, and Ronnie just seems to lack conviction. Amazingly, nothing about rainbows.\n\n\"Eat Your Heart Out\" is just hilarious. This is quintessential 80's cheese rock. I couldn't stop laughing at the chorus, and the lyrics are so ambiguous that you can't help but see why he never got critical respect. These are literally the worst sexual euphemisms I have ever heard. \"Locked away in your velvet jail\"? Come on Ronnie! Isn't Wendy ashamed of you? The solo is fine, but that riff is so unapologetically shlocky that it makes you wonder what everyone was thinking back then. Piss poor metal for the paralytically pissed.\n\nFinally we get to the album's, *ahem*, \"serious epic\" (Translation: Ronnie's latest \"Stargazer\" rewrite). Trouble is he seems to have forgotten that people loved that song because, uh, stuff happened. \"Egypt\" is saddled with a painfully dull riff, a majestically dissatisfying up tempo section, a gloriously meh solo, and a distinctly naff keyboard line. The song plods worse than \"The Sign of the Southern Cross\", and Vinnie is noticeably restrained on the drums. He REALLY needs to push this along with some cool fills, but he doesn't and the song just bogs. Also, the non-standard chorus doesn't work. It is an interesting idea for a song though, aliens influencing Egypt, but Dio fails to carry it off with any inspiration at all. Oh, and he talks about rainbows.\n\nAll in all, this album is very good in sections, mediocre in others, and is really worthwhile only for the first two tracks which are available on every Dio \"Best Of\", making this release for completist fans only.\n\nStand-Outs: \"The Last in Line\", \"We Rock\", \"One Night in the City\"\n",
        "\nHere is a band or a man in this case, who has had up to this point a long career of varying greatness, but most certainly sucess. What comes with sucess and careers of 10 plus years? Best of Albums! Here is Dio's attemp of a best of album that had some sort of desirabilty to buy and also put some cash in Ronnie's pocket. Well this will put cash in Ronnie's pocket since it adaquitly chronicles his career fairly, representing each album equally (resonably). Making this appealing for people who want a taste of the geezer midget Dio.\n\nThis compilation's greatest strength is also its greatest weakness. That statement sounds like a load of crap, but its most certainly true. Best of albums that are done in the style of this one are made to represent a bands career with their best songs. They appeal to people who want to know what the band sounds like but who can't download their songs or borrow records, so the option of buying a best of that has songs from the band's entire discography is a great alternative or solution. This album definatly appeals to that type of metal head. It meets the criterea of having the entire dicography chronicled appropriatly, taking the best tracks off each full length album. Dio does this very well on \"The Very Beast Of\", thus making this best of album absoluty perfect in accomplishing its goal.\n\nThis is also the albums crippling flaw. Between the tracks on this album of Dio's albums Holy Diver and Stranger in the Dark (both two great albums with great tracks from these albums on this best of record) this release is filled with the best tracks for the rest of his albums between the two mentioned. Sounds like a good thing, but even the best tracks between these albums [Last in Line and Lock Up the Wolves] range from average and boring to total garbage and wankery. The album only has songs worth listening to from Holy Diver and Strange Highways. Making the rest of the tracks worthless and not desireable to listen to after one listen.\n\nSo while this does capture the majority of dio's sound from 1983-1994, it captures alot of horrible songs as well, making this best of kinda useless. This album will get the heavy/power metal fan into dio's two good albums Holy Diver and Strange Highways, but you could of found that out by asking someone eh? Its just worth it to own those two good dio albums and leave this one on the store shelves. It does what its suppose to do, what its suppose to do sucks though.\n",
        "\nAfter an excellent debut, Dio roared back with this slab of Heavy Metal goodness. There are a lot of similarities to Holy Diver on Last In Line but there are some subtle differences too. The end result is almost equally as impressive though, and Last In Line stands as one of the highlights of Dio\u2019s career.\n\nThe first thing I noticed when listening to this release was the fact that the songs in general were faster. Holy Diver was largely a mid-paced CD, done very well mind you, but only \u201cStand Up And Shout\u201d could be considered fast. Last In Line proves that Dio can write faster Heavy Metal tracks such as \u201cWe Rock\u201d, \u201cI Speed At Night\u201d, and \u201cEvil Eyes\u201d, and succeed at them. Of course, the mid-paced song writing of Dio is in full effect on Last In Line as well. Basically, the title track is this CD\u2019s version of Holy Diver, being very similar in overall arrangement and atmosphere. Though the Holy Diver title track might be a stronger song than the Last In Line title track, it still stands as a highlight of the CD with its memorable chorus and progressive build up. \u201cMystery\u201d is also this CD\u2019s version of \u201cRainbow In The Dark\u201d. It has the same kind of keyboard melody driving the song and while not bad, \u201cRainbow In The Dark\u201d is superior. \n\nThe riffs by Vivian Campbell are very well done again, this time taking on more of an 80\u2019s Metal approach than the rock influenced guitar riffs we heard on Holy Diver. The result can best be heard on \u201cWe Rock\u201d and \u201cEat Your Heart Out\u201d which both have excellent pure 80\u2019s riffs; you just don\u2019t hear stuff like this anymore. Meanwhile, Campbell\u2019s leads are competently executed, though they\u2019re not as instantly memorable as they were on Holy Diver, however, \u201cEgypt (The Chains Are On)\u201d has one of Campbell\u2019s better leads. Likewise, the drumming is more dynamic, however, the bass doesn\u2019t seem as prominent, which is unforunate. As if there was any doubt, Dio\u2019s vocals are amazing as always. He sings with a lot of emotion and instantly makes every song have a memorable chorus, which is always important for this type of Metal. Also, while Holy Diver had a couple of songs that featured keyboards, Last In Line seems to use them more often as mentioned by another reviewer. They are really only up front in \u201cMystery\u201d, though, but can be heard in the background on most other tracks as they usually add just a touch of melody or atmosphere.\n\nLast In Line is very close to being as good as Holy Diver. It has some of my favorite songs from Dio but when you go on a song per song basis Holy Diver has more classics, however, the song writing is more varied on Last In Line, as the band mixes fast, mid-paced, and progressive tracks more diversely this time around. Anyway you look at it though this is a classic 80\u2019s Heavy Metal release: it has soaring vocals, excellent choruses, solid riffs, and explosive leads. Can\u2019t ask for much more than that. \n\nSong Highlights: We Rock, Last In Line, Speed At Night, Eat Your Heart Out, One Night In The City, Egypt (The Chains Are On)\n",
        "\nHere we have one of the founding fathers of metal, Dio, however this is an album without Vivian Campbell and you can easily tell, the solos are really nothing spectacular. It is a rather disappointing follow up to Sacred Heart and isn't even in the same league as Holy Diver. Most can tell that this is where Ronnie really began to run short on ideas. I'm not saying this album is totally worthless(the album cover is extremely eerie, but says nothing for the music), but about 80 percent of the album is repeated simplistic choruses, the most obvious major examples being Faces in the Window, When a Woman Cries, and Overlove.\n\nMost Dio albums tend to die out towards the end, but Dream Evil never really gets started. There are pretty much only about 3 songs here that I can listen to, those being Night People, Dream Evil, and All the Fools Sailed Away. The latter being by far the best song on the album with a very grandeur chorus and a really good solo and also decent riffs. Besides Angry Machines, I would view this as Dio's lowest moment.\n",
        "\n... but there are way too many post Last in Line, forgettable and mediocre Dio tracks to justify a newbie purchase. I mean, fuck, imagine the disdain of a wayward metalhead who hears \"I Could of Been a Dreamer\" or \"Rock'N'Roll Children\" and bases his opinions on that. MOST of the classics are documented here... Last in Line, Stand Up and Shout, Straight Through the Heart. But there are some glaring omissions... particularly Caught in the Middle and Don't Talk to Strangers. Sure, that would totally skew representation towards Holy Diver, but who the hell wants to hear Strange Highways or keyboard laden crap songs that sound more like Depeche Mode than the grand wizard himself?\n\nI'll put it point blank: everything after LiL and up to Killing the Dragon is worthless. A few standout tracks here and there (Dream Evil...) but nothing particularly good. Get Holy Diver instead! That's the REAL very beast of dio.\n",
        "\nRonnie, Tracy, Jeff, and Vinnie unleashed Strange Highways upon us in 1994, and then totally caught the metal world off guard yet again with ANGRY FUCKING MACHINES in 1996. People slag bands all the time for releasing the same album over and over, and people slag bands for radically changing their style. Well slag this one, because for what this album was intended to do...it worked. Awkward sound all across the board, dissonant riffs, random baroque symphonic pieces, and confusing social commentary! Its probably the only piece of 'musical art' that I value as an artful expression.\n\"Institutional Man\" is great and connects itself to Strange Highways very well. \"Don't Tell The Kids\" is as cynical as they come, and \"Black\" is pretty catchy albeit annoying. That's probably the worst song on the album.\n\n\"Hunter Of The Heart\" is pretty good, and the most accessible track on the album, but stuff like \"Stay Outta My Mind,\" \"Big Sister,\" and \"Double Monday\" keep me coming back because I still don't fucking understand the songs. But it just works, like \"Golden Rules\" flows through clean riffing, disjointed bridges, dio hooks, and screwed up solos....all with a very focused message. Whether you get it or not, the album is making a statement. \"Dying In America\" is brooding and fun, while \"God Hates Heavy Metal\" chugs pretty nicely. The ballad \"This Is Your Life\" is just damn beautiful and an excellent closer. I even quoted the song in my high school yearbook.\n\nYeah yeah yeah, its not classic dio. Oh no!!! He definitely didn't sell out, but still tried a new direction. And I like this more than Magica or Lock Up The Wolves. Great release that DOESN'T get its due respect.\n",
        "\nI would probably consider this about my 4th favorite dio album. He's been kind of riding a rollercoaster with albums and has done alot of experiementing, and there are actually a few superb songs on this album. I'll do a synopsis of a few of them, because many of them are just talking or instrumental.\n\nLord of the Last Day has some pretty competent playing all around. A nice song that doesn't really sound like something typical of dio. Its has a bit of a medieval feel to it, but isn't really too boring.\n\nThe only description I can give for Fever Dreams is \"Dio at his best\"! Perfectly written, worthy of appearing on albums such as Holy Diver or Last in Line. Not only a great song, but also has a mind-numbingly good solo.\n\nTurn to Stone, or as I like to refer to it, turn this track. Its a pretty uneventful track. Seems like Dio used this just as a filler. The chorus isn't too great and the instrumention is sub-par.\n\nFeed My Head is probably my favorite track after Fever Dreams. Lyrically not much, but it is Ronnie's best song vocally. Sounds like Holy Diver in the way that such bad ass drumming is being played as the song is ending.\n\nI don't know what happened, but I honestly don't remember Eriel or Challis. I've listened to this album several times and these two tracks just fail to stick with me.\n\nAs Long as Its Not About Love is probably one of dio's better ballads, but it doesn't stand a chance against songs like Don't Talk to Strangers, Egypt, or My Eyes. I personally find the lyrics to this track to be rather cheesy, but it is sung rather heart-felt at least.\n\nLosing My Insanity is a surprise. After a few uneventful songs, I didn't expect to be blown away by anything remaining on the album. This is another song that sounds rather special. I don't think this track would fit on another album, but it is a gem on Magica. Very great instrumentation.\n\nOtherworld once again seems like a track that Ronnie was running out of ideas when he wrote. Once again, he sings it magnificently, but the music is not very inspiring.\n\nMy main complaint about this album is the vast tracks that are only a little over a minute long with nothing new to offer. I also didn't like the fact that Dio included the who story of Magica as the last track. I guess he's assuming that most metalheads can't read, or are as old as him and can't see neither. Ronnie is still a great musician, but sometimes I wonder why he does what he does. The music for Magica is exceptional, but the concept of the album and the story itself are rather boring. I still like this alot better than Angry Machines, but Dio can do better still.\n",
        "\nA strange album - too short to be full length and too long to be an Ep, consisting of 5 live songs, which are admittedly very well done and prove that Live, Dio was a force to be reckoned with and one new studio track which falls a bit short and is rather unspectacular when compared to any of the previous albums.\n\nNot really a very convincing release (hell, they could have made it a full length album and put on another 5 or 6 live-tracks, which WOULD have been the right thing to do during this period in Dio's carreer) - but quite okay as it stands but more suited to collectors or die-hard fans than the \"casual\" Metal fan.\n",
        "\nThe fifth full length Dio album and for one reason or another also one of the least popular ones - even though in my opinion this is a large step forward compared to \"Dream Evil\" (on which Ronny & Co. somehow seemed to lack creativity, energy and ideas).\n\nMain and most interesting newcomer in the band is guitarist Rowan Robertson (only 19 when picked up by Dio) who gives the album a somewhat heavier and bluesier feel than usual (\"Twisted\" and \"Evil On Queen St.\") - it can be considered to be quite a shame that this collaboration ended so abrubtly because I really would have liked to hear more from this talented guitarplayer. \n\nAs far as i'm concerned this is easily one of the better Dio albums songwise - with excellent tracks as the fast opener \"Wild One\", the mid-tempo \"Born On The Sun\", the balladesque \"Hey Angel\" and \"Between Two Hearts\" and the excellent closing song \"My Eyes\". Well worth a buy if you are able to track it down.\n",
        "\nFollowing 2 years after the (incredibely underrated) \"Strange Highways\" comes \"Angry Machines\" - an album which, sadly, can be described as Dio pushing the previous album (musically and lyrically) not TO the edge but darn well OVER it - resulting in a free fall into mediocracy.\n\nSimply put, everything which worked so well for \"Strange Highways\" doesn't seem to be working on here - it seems as if Dio himself was unsure and confused about the direction to follow - resulting in an album filled with different ideas (some good, some not) but without any form of cohesion.\n\nIt starts well enough with \"Institutional Man\", a dark and plodding song and somewhat of a follow-up to the title-track of the previous record, and both \"Don't Tell The Kids\" (up-tempo) and \"Hunter Of The Heart\" (mid-tempo and groovy) can also be considered to be top class material but the rest of the tracks are just plain boring (\"Big Sister\", \"Double Monday\" or \"Stay Out Of My Mind\" anyone ? I didn't think so eh...).\n\nShame - but this album pretty much lacks everything which made Dio so great (save for the vocals, which are great like usual) - die-hard fans can pick it up (cheap though, don't waste money on this) to complete their collection, but the rest of you - steer clear !!\n",
        "\nDio's first full-length live album in 15 years time and what a dissapointment it turned out to be. \n\nFirst off there is the incredibely bad timing - this album is recorded on the tour for what must be the weakest Dio album in history (\"Angry Machines\") and with a guitarplayer whose style is largely incompatible with most of Dio's old material (not to mention the Rainbow and Sabbath tracks).\n\nThen there is the setlist - which passes up on no less than 3 complete albums and mainly consists of \"Holy Diver\" and Rainbow / Sabbath tracks, totalling 10 tracks out of 15 (not counting intro and solo's) which imo opinion is a complete disgrace - i'm sure plenty of fans would have rather heard \"Dream Evil\", \"Evil eyes\", \"Sacred Heart\", \"Lock up The Wolves\" or \"Born On The Sun\" than for example a \"Mistreated\" or \"Long Live Rock & Roll\".\n\nHowever it has to be said that the album isn't complete trash - the production is well above average, and like always, Dio's singing is top notch. It's just a shame that this album could have been so much more than what it actually turned out to be - as it stands it's just an above average record, only intended for die-hard fans of the band.\n",
        "\nI've been fan of Dio's work in Black Sabbath for a number of years now but I never could get into this solo stuff. I mean, I always liked the song \u201cHoly Diver\u201d (what Heavy Metal fan doesn\u2019t) but despite constant praise from a friend of mine, I never heard anything from Dio that really grabbed me. So it took me awhile but I happened upon Holy Diver used so I figured I didn't have much to lose, and at least I knew I was getting one good song. After many repeated listens over the past 6 months, I can only say wow! Holy Diver is definitely a keeper!\n\nThe two highlights of this CD are obvious: Dio\u2019s vocals and Vivian Campbell\u2019s guitar playing. Dio has an excellent voice that is truly unique and he sings with a lot of emotion on this release. Every song and chorus is memorable from a vocal standpoint and the melodic and driving guitars only add to the catchiness. Campbell is a solid rhythm player, laying down some good Hard Rock inspired riffs, with some really good leads. \n\n\u201cStand Up And Shout\u201d is really the only fast song on Holy Diver\u2026 it even has a strong Judas Priest feel. The rest of the songs, as mentioned, are largely mid-paced, with some progressive build-up here and there: see \u201cDon\u2019t Talk To Strangers\u201d. Other stand out tracks (besides the obvious title track) are \u201cRainbow In The Dark\u201d with its melodic synth and \u201cShame On The Night\u201d. Not only did doom masters Solitude Aeternus cover this track, but I think a lot of Doom bands in the vein of Solitude Aeternus took heavy inspiration from this song; perhaps as much as they did from any single Black Sabbath song with the possible exception of the song \u201cBlack Sabbath\u201d. Even though the songs are mostly mid-paced, the arrangements and vocal delivery make them all interesting and I will say that not one track sounds similar; this is also due in part to the unique atmosphere that always seems to surround Dio\u2019s work.\n\nI was very, very impressed with Holy Diver. It has even joined the ranks of my all time favorite Heavy Metal releases, and in just a short period of time. Any Heavy Metal fan who doesn\u2019t own this, I give you the advice to not do what I did and wait 8 years to buy this.\n\nSong Hightlights: All of them, although Gypsy is probably the weakest.\n",
        "\nI must admit that I?ve been looking forward quite a lot to Dio?s new album Killing The Dragon, especially since I?m still not very impressed with his previous release Magica, which although being quite a solid release and a definitive improvement over Angry Machines, grew boring all too quickly due to what seemed like a lack of fresh ideas and energy (and a utterly boring concept story to accompany all of this).\n\nThe biggest change between Killing The Dragon and Magica is of course the arrival of new guitar player Doug Aldrich, who replaces Craig Goldy, and manages to do an excellent job at doing so as well. Honestly speaking Doug is probably one of the better guitar players that Dio has worked with so far, and at least manages to recapture a small part of the old magic with his excellent playing and blistering solo?s. Of course it doesn?t have to be said that both Dio?s vocals as well as the performance of the rest of the band are first class like usual.\n\nMusically, this album reminds me most of a cross between Sacred Heart and Dream Evil, and holds up fairly well in comparison too. The main problem however is that once again, the main bulk of the material consists of slow and/or mid tempo songs, which grow tiresome after a couple of listens and makes you yearn for something a little bit more up tempo. \n\nThat doesn?t have to say though that Killing The Dragon is rubbish, and at least for me tracks like \"Killing The Dragon\", \"Along Comes A Spider\", \"Push\" & \"Throwaway Children\" (with a cute child choir at the end) easily beat anything Dio?s released over the past 6 years or so. A fairly solid but unspectular album as it stands, but it could have been so much more better with a bit more diversity brought in. Still certainly well worth having if you?re a Dio fan.\n",
        "\nSomewhere between the Black Sabbath reunion and DIO's rejuvenated touring in the late nineties, there is a lttle 1994 release called \"Strange Highways\". As fucking heavy as Sabbath (as seen in 1992's masterpiece Dehumanizer) but as non-cliche as DIO's politically assertive \"Angry Machines\". This album was the highest point in DIO's evolution. The formula of Holy Diver - Last In Line - Sacred Heart - Dream Evil was cracked a bit with Lock Up The Wolves, broken by a Sabbath reunion, and completely decimated in 1994. This album in three words, is: HEAVY. NASTY. AWESOME.\n\nWe have good ol' Ronnie leading the charge, accompanied by the best man besides RJD in the DIO lineup canon, Vinnie Appice on drums. Vinnie makes this album work. He CRUSHES that drumset on every song. Jeff Pilson of Dokken fame gives us the bass, and Tracy G lays down some of the heaviest fucking riffs AND solos to be heard on a DIO album since....well NEVER. Vivian Campbell NEVER played this angry and crushing. People say this album doesn't sound like classic Dio, much like how many say Judas Priest's latest hasn't sounded like classic Priest. They are pretty true, but for Dio's sake, he manages to pull this switch off to perfection. From an industrial tinged vox and groove in the opener \"Jesus, Mary, and The Holy Ghost\" to the sludge of the title track, this thing rocks. Personally, I feel Dio is more suited to this kinda of throaty screaming with trudging riffs, especially in this day and age, but alas he no longer does this. Songs like \"Firehead\", \"Bring Down The Rain\", and the holy fucking awesome and extremely underrated \"Evilution\" slays everything in the Dio discography with the exception of the classic 2. The socially aware and anti-religion lyrics are really refreshing, and the band is really tight right off the bat. Sadly, the rehash of this formula in 1996's Angry Machines didn't come out as well, but here it strikes gold. A must for any Dio fan and doom metal minion.\n\n\n",
        "\nThe album may not be one of dio's finest, but it is definately killing. The tracks vary from rock to metal, and tracks like Cold Feet, Guilty, and Before The Fall are absolutely nothing more but filler material. The riffing varies from faster to slower, technical to catchy.\nKilling he Dragon is opened by a slaying title track, with epic lyrics about... well dungeons and dragons! The following \"Along Comes A Spider\" is an awesome track as well, but \"Scream\" is a bit of a step-down. It's the first song on the more rock side of the album. Things get better again, with \"Better In The Dark\", which is more in vein of the first two songs. \"Rock And Roll\" has a very decieving name, because the track is as metal as it gets, and in my opinion, is the peack of the release. Part of it is also the best rendition of Led Zeppelin's \"Kashmir\" I've ever heard. After that the only trully good song is \"Throw Away The Children\", and all of the tracks apart from \"Push\" sound like filler. \"Push\" is definately a rock track, with a catchy riff and lyrics, but it doesn't stand up to the rest of the good tunes on the album. As for \"Trow Away The Children\", it has a slower, heavier riff to it, and a very catchy chorus, the song is close to being a ballad, I enjoy it a lot, especially the kid choir in the end (it fits perfectly :D). To sum it up, the best track is \"Rock And Roll\", the worst is \"Cold Feet\"\nOverall, the album sounds like something in between Magica and Dio's 80's material, and though the lyrics are certainly not the best by the man, the album is fairly good.\n",
        "\nThis album starts off extremely strong with the title track. I think this song will go down as one of the classics in his solo career. It's a razor sharp metal song with fantasy lyrics like we could expect from Dio back in the early days. Along Came a Spider is more of a rock song, but it sure as hell does ROCK! I have to admit that I was not listening to metal in the 80's, but I get the same feel from this album that I do from listening to his 80's material. I don't really care for Better In the Dark that much because the main guitar line sounds too much like a typical Motley Crue type hard rock riff. The singing is still good on it though, as it is everywhere else on the cd. Dio's voice sounds as strong as ever. Don't let the name of the song Rock & Roll fool you. It's possibly the heaviest and darkest track on the album, and has less of a traditional hard rock feel than many of the others. The chorus sounds like it would be a song that could go over really well with a live audience. Push is an example of a song for which Rock & Roll would be a more fitting title, but unlike Better In the Dark, this song kicks ass. Throw Away the Children is another slow, catchy, almost-ballad. Before the Fall is a song I like even less than Better In the Dark. The band tries to do something interesting with a little organ sound in the middle, but it doesn't prevent it from being a total filler song. Unfortunately, the next and last song is only barely better. It's really a shame that this album ends on such a weak note when it started off so strong. Overall though, it's the best thing Dio's put out since Strange Highways.\n"
