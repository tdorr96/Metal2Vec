        "\nSolipsism is a hell of a drug; being a legend in your own head, lord of your own domain, and having millions clamor your praise from end to end will give anyone enough of an ego to think they're untouchable.\u00a0 Just ask CM Punk, and like him Jari Maenpaa, the Finnish Metal Gabe Newell, sought to etch his name in stone by his own accord alone.\u00a0 Wintersun was a group he had such passion for, such attention given, and that first album, man...every Finn Metal weeaboo shot fifteen loads in its name, thereby giving the Ensiferum cast-off a second chance at stardom and enough pull in his scene to promise the second album to be one for the ages.\u00a0 So they waited.\u00a0 And waited.\u00a0 And got half an album out of it which is, admittedly, a very, very fine listen, before the nothingness and years passing by returned.\u00a0 That was, until a NEW ALBUM was announced that would be, in part, inspired by Vivaldi's \"The Four Seasons\", which honestly piqued my interest; to think, the once and future melodeath king would attempt to replicate good and proper classical music in his body of work.\u00a0 It seemed almost too good to ignore.\u00a0 So I, against my better judgment, went for it.\n\nAnd...oh dear...\n\nVivaldi's \"Four Seasons\" is a beautiful work full of differing moods, motifs and atmospheres befitting of the seasons each movement represents.\u00a0 \"The Forest Seasons\", on the other hand?\u00a0 None of it.\u00a0 Not one damned thing.\u00a0 I don't know how far along said inspiration went, but none of the grandeur and pomp of an orchestral work is present here save for the sampling (which, come on...even lesser-tier modern symphonic metal acts have that sound down much better).\u00a0 Even compared to the rest of Wintersun's discography it's pure zero; the first album was a mashing of genres that worked very well in spite of itself, and \"Time I\" was a deep and enriching listen, again, in spite of itself.\u00a0 But this is nothing.\u00a0 Complete and utter nothing.\u00a0 What the poor listener who caved in and helped finance Jari's continued descent into decadent megalomania got was four overstale B-Sides from the debut where there's a lot of noise and layers that have a hollow, flat mastering job that almost borders on a Loudness War approach and go absolutely nowhere.\u00a0 The small amount of tracks doesn't mean a thing when each song feels like it runs on and on for a week straight in a \"St. Anger\"-like level of stretching a few minutes of material into homeopathic depths that works so hard against your sense of patience.\u00a0 I mean, the hallmarks of Wintersun are still present -- choppy staccato riffs, layered synths, duality of harsh and clean vocals, samples here and there, using the same chord structures repeated a hundred times but layer it so much it sounds better than it should -- but it's all done with no passion whatsoever, no thought involved, like he just didn't give a shit.\u00a0 Yes, \"he\", as in a strange move the dude forsook his entire band and did this all himself, with a special guest appearance by a revived Angelo Sasso on klonky programmed drums.\u00a0 The albums preceding this had something to tell, a point to make, and this doesn't in any way, shape for form, and all the controversy behind it is incredibly telling.\u00a0 It's essentially shelling out prime steak price for a Big Mac.\n\nThis should have been, at least, a pleasant surprise; while everyone sits and waits way too long for the next half of \"Time\", this comes out of the woodwork to cleanse the palette, to placate the impatience, to show that the head honcho still sorta cares about his listeners.\u00a0 And it's such nihilistic trash, another insult, another jab in the eye and a tongue stuck out because surely there are still more people than the dude deserves supporting him and will do just that no matter what crap he shovels out.\u00a0 But that's the pisser of the matter, too; we don't need this, we don't need Wintersun anymore.\u00a0 In the 74 years since the debut we've had smatterings of bands pop out to steal the huge, booming metal spotlight and release works that are, at the very least, comparable to Jari's bread and butter: you want the hyperspeed folksy side?\u00a0 There's Autumn's Mourning. The fist-raising epics?\u00a0 There's Valhalore.\u00a0 The atmospheric, doomy stuff?\u00a0 There's Strunkiin.\u00a0 Shit, go back to Bal-Sagoth's entire discography or the past couple records of his old guard Ensiferum to scratch that itch, and then some!\u00a0 The point is, Jari can no longer think himself the untouchable king of epic metal when he continues to rest on his laurels and wait until 2144 to FINALLY release \"Time II\", as by then everyone will have passed on or passed him up.\u00a0 You just can't do that to your fans; make then wait and wait and wait, blocking the Nuclear Blast office number until you finally get your shit together, throw a bunch of tracks onto a disc and threaten to not release it until they pay fifty bucks for the Jeebus Version, all so you can build a studio to your liking despite having access to Finnvox.\u00a0 Seriously, Jari, fuck you.\n\nIn the end this should really be Wintersun's death knell.\u00a0 To cock tease this much, to demand money you really don't need for a studio you, again, don't need, and throw these table scraps at your ravenous fans in such a pissant way would kill far lesser groups, and for me I'm not willing to give this jamoke any more time and money I could use for something more important.\u00a0 Tell me \"Time II\" will re-invent the entire genre all you want, but I won't believe you.\u00a0 I'm done.\n",
        "\nI think that to accurately describe this album you have to really think hard about it. There are a lot of things to be said about it. I think the best place to start is the riffs. The first thing you hear when you play this album (assuming you play it in order) is the incredible guitar beginning to Beyond the Dark Sun. I think that that riff sets the tone for the rest of the album for the most part, although at times it's definitely slower than that. As with pretty much all metal, the guitar is unarguably the most important instrument.\n\nThe next thing that I need to talk about is the vocals. Jari has such an incredible voice, and the growls and clean vocals alike sound so good. His voice is sometimes soft and soothing and sometimes loud and booming. For example, in the track Sleeping Stars, in the part where the singing first starts it goes \"Oh sleeping stars, why are you so sad tonight, Oh sleeping stars, will you shine for me tonight\" in a relatively easy clean singing, and then it suddenly picks up and he screams \"OH SLEEPING STAAARRRS\" in full growl.\n\nAfter that, the keyboard/synth is a very integral part of this album as well. It would be good without it, but it wouldn't be the same thing. Both in the parts where it's the only instrument you hear and in the parts where it's in the background, it sounds great as hell. There really isn't very much to say about it though, other than that it is a major contributor.\n\nThis is the part of the review that I am the least happy about writing, but it needs to be said. While the sound is amazing pretty much throughout the entire album, that's not to say that it's not without fault.\n\nThe biggest complaint that I have about this album is that sometimes it builds expectations (sometimes for surprisingly long periods of time) but doesn't meet them. You keep thinking that it's going to go back to the main riff but it does something completely different. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but sometimes it gets annoying. Kind of like a musical version of if you think somebody is going to get to the point in a conversation but then they completely change the subject or just walk off. Fucking terrible.\n\nAnother issue is that sometimes I think he chose the wrong way to sing in certain parts. More specifically he growls when it would be more appropriate to use clean vocals and uses clean vocals when it would be more appropriate to growl. This doesn't happen too often, and it is a matter of opinion, but I think you will probably agree with me on that if you listen to it yourself.\n\nI feel that before I finish I should also mention the album cover. It is a beautiful piece of artwork, and I think it does the music justice. After all, it is a fairly iconic album cover.\n\nAll in all, the reason I give this a 95/100 is because while it's good, there is some bad mixed in. Fortunately, the good vastly outweighs the bad, although not so much that it's unnoticeable. I definitely recommend checking this godly album out if you haven't already.\n",
        "\nThis album is a lot of things, by proxy. A long-awaited album by fans of the debut self-titled album. An album by a man who left Ensiferum to pursue a project he believed would be better by comparison. Most of all, it is an album of polarizing appeal, easily having nearly the most reviews on this website at this moment in time. Personally speaking, I have a slightly storied history with this album, having found it through this site. It's taken me a number of years to figure out exactly what I feel about this album... but I think I finally figured it out.\n\nLet's start out with a basic point: For an album that took eight fucking years to produce, five songs clocking in to 40 minutes simply isn't enough. What could you have possibly been doing that would have taken so long to stop yourself from flat-out releasing this album? Adding more effects? Injecting more MIDI samples? Fuckin' raiding in World of Warcraft? There's no excuse! It infuriates me to no end that it would have taken so long to do this in the first place. Simple research would tell you that most of the baseline excuses they gave was hardware problems, that they weren't able to find good enough times to record, that Jari had fucking WRITER'S BLOCK. If you're gonna give people the excuse that the only reason they don't have an album is that you can't get the right supplies or think of good ways to write songs, maybe you should get your priorities straight and actually just focus on goddamn brainstorming.\n\nHow about the music, though? Took eight years to produce, right? It should be perfect! Absolutely ASTONISHING... yeah, you can sense the sarcasm. This album's main punchline is that it's filled to the brim with overproduced noise and orchestrations better found and better MADE in World of Warcraft... and I wouldn't be surprised if that were the case. It sounds like they wanted to point themselves towards an epic space fantasy adventure, but something like that would have been better done if it were a novel, wouldn't it? The only song that actually chooses to act on what they've got and do well with it is \"Sons of Winter and Stars\", and even then the lyrics just scream cheese to me. What are we talking about here, what's the exact point? What am I supposed to feel here, suspense? Who are we experiencing this through, and are we supposed to be experiencing this through something? Part of me wants to believe they were objectively trying to make songs about space vikings going through some metaphysical crisis on some fuckin' Space Odyssey levels of confusing... and I'll be honest, I've seen bands like Dethklok make songs about vikings and space and shit plenty more interesting than this.\n\nIt's almost insulting. As a listener, I expect better. This whole album feels like an ego project of Jari's own creation. I feel like he was trying to create a soundtrack for all his fuckin' epic space wizard LARPing sessions, but all this feels like to ME is a soundtrack to my now Time I-induced clinical depression. This album reeks of stupidity and I just can't stand it... which sucks, because I know Wintersun can do plenty better as a band. Their debut, at its very best, resembled something decent of its genre, and I feel like Time I could have been even better if they dropped its overproduced acts and overzealous attitudes.\n\nBut yeah... fuck this album.\n",
        "\nWintersun came out of nowhere with the release of their self-titled album. After his departure from Ensiferum mastermind Jari set about making his vision a reality and it did not disappoint. The levels of musical genius required to orchestrate a release on this scale are unreal, second to none. This album contains some of their most classic tracks, all unique and absolutely magnificent in their own ways. There are a huge number of elements going on in any Wintersun release so they are a difficult band to classify. Orchestras, black metal, power metal, even the occasional heavy metal lick sneaks its way into a guitar solo.\n\nWintersun is a really diverse album. It has a little more to offer in terms of variety than the later releases but this could be due to the longer period of time over which it was written and the increased number of songs on the release. The album changes pace a number of times but in a very methodical way that flows pretty seamlessly throughout. (This assumes you listen to it in the order it was intended Winter Madness at the beginning then Beyond the Dark Sun, etc.) There are so many phenomenal elements to this album, the orchestras, the intense and complex melodic passages made by the guitars, and Jari's vocals. While he hadn't yet arrived at a place of true technical proficiency in his voice at this time, the bro can sing. He does a really good job conveying emotion in his voice without sounding like he's in an emo-core band.\n\nAlso the solos in and of themselves are worth listening too. There is some serious shredding that takes place on this album and its off the chain. Winter Madness and Death and the Healing in particular have some absurd levels of face melting going on for several minutes at a time. Both of these songs are also very diverse and unique in themselves. Winter Madness is fast paced, in your face, and fairly chaotic and dissonant at times, while Death and the Healing is a slow and beautiful song. There's such a healthy balance of tracks on this album it can take a person on a journey while listening. The lyrical content as well serves as a huge conveyor of emotion. Songs like Beautiful Death and Sadness and Hate capture some of the heartbreak and tragedy of life, death, and relationships with other people and the world.\n\nThis album is a classic and a fan favorite for metal heads who dig that Scandinavian melodic metal sound. If you enjoy Ensiferum, Kalmah, Children of Bodom, etc. I highly recommend you listen to Wintersun. This album is unreal and an absolute classic and the bands writing and playing has only improved since then.\n",
        "\nHow does a fatalistic wretch caught in an unrelenting rut of cynical contemplation view the passing of time? This question is one that may well have been posed many times by philosophers, but it seems quite fitting that the relatively new school of extreme metal would be the one to offer an answer. The unique middle ground that the melodic strains of black and death metal occupy between melancholy and rage has been a fertile place for composing tales of woe, and more recently an atmospheric strain of the former camp has proven quite willing to stretch this approach into massive fits of musical meditation that preclude any degree of mainstream appeal. In the midst of all this, riding into the fray with a folksy, symphonic and epic gloss stands The Forest Seasons, the third studio offering of one of metal's most polarizing and least prolific characters Jari M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4. It should likewise be underscored that though this album bears the Wintersun insignia, the near totality of what constitutes this album is solely the handiwork of its helmsman, to the point of it being a de facto solo project.\n\nIt goes without saying that Jari has always been a man who goes off into his own world once the songwriting commences, but with this endeavor this idea is taken to its logical conclusion. Like a dreary bard afflicted with both a desire for death and an ironic status of immortality, his lyrics paint the picture of a vast forest that shares his disposition, locked in a cycle of death and rebirth where the light and warmth of summer brings only the anticipation of the eventual frost of winter, and the latter season's arrival comes like a supernatural coachman to shepherd the land back to the beginning of the same cycle. The surrounding musical and vocal expressions contain a curious mixture of symphonic flair, atmospheric nuance and eclectic stylistic devices that mark a drastic departure from previous works. The surprises are many, including but not limited to Jari occasionally employing a deeper death bark comparable to Amon Amarth's Johan Hegg to accompany the higher pitched Gothenburg growl meets blackened shriek and dynamic clean singing that have tended to be his trademark, but they go a bit deeper than a few individual ingredients and permeate that entirety of the album.\n\nIn a sense, this album goes further than the quirky gimmicks and world music elements that adorned Time I and seems to crossover from the symphonic melodeath realm into something more blackened and atmospheric. It bears a fair degree of similarity to some of the larger scale work of Moonsorrow and Falkenbach, tending towards a more moderated tempo, a varied mixture of keyboard sounds that occasionally even dips into ambient territory here and there, and forsaking a lot of the technical wizardry that adorned Wintersun's eponymous debut. Then again, a rather impressive and long-winded guitar solo finds its way onto \"Eternal Darkness (Autumn)\", itself a song that spends much of its time in the blackest territory of any offering on here, almost sounding like a more folksy and technically tinged nod to early Emperor and Enslaved with a higher fidelity production job. Yet, be it a string of fancy ax work on the aforementioned song or a highly distinctive acoustic passage to open and close the At The Heart Of Winter era of Immortal inspired \"The Forest That Weeps (Summer)\", this is music that tells a story, and all the surrounding elements meld beautifully into one cohesive whole.\n\nThough at first a seeming stranger to those who are initiated to Wintersun's earlier incarnation, The Forest Seasons is not entirely bereft of typical trademarks that have come to be associated with Jari's handiwork. Somewhere amid defying just about every expectation that one would have for his approach to songwriting with the ambient turned mid-paced and occasionally dissonant symphonic opener \"Awaken From The Dark Slumber (Spring)\", things take on a familiar tone during the latter half of its near 15 minute duration with a triumphant gallop and a familiarly folksy gang chorus of husky basses and baritones that bears an uncanny resemblance to several songs heard on Ensiferum's Iron. This gang chorus approach gives way to an even more massive sea of voices on the subsequent and slightly shorter ode to the winter season, not to mention a rather astounding and heartfelt solo vocal performance in a near-crooning tenor on the closer \"Loneliness (Winter)\" that also reminisce on some of the more brilliant moments of the debut. Ironically enough, the background vocals are the only area where Jari saw fit to include the other members of the band, making this all but a one-man project after the mold of esoteric atmospheric bands like Midnight Odyssey and Lustre.\n\nThere is a paradox to this album that likely did not escape notice to those who got beyond the hype and infamy surrounding its creation and the people involved, and that is the fact that it managed to garner so much of both in spite of being so geared towards the esoteric. This isn't the sort of album that one would expect to come with the backing of a label like Nuclear Blast, nor is it normally the sort of conceptual work that normally receives a bulky and crisp production. It is a highly ambitious offering that masks itself within a shroud of repetition and gradualism that stands in stark contrast to the shred-happy, blazing fast, progressively minded debut effort, opting for atmosphere and a subtle sentimentalism that comes off as being more nostalgic than impact-based. Any flaw that it has relative to past works is largely measured in a slight degree of over-ambition in the songwriting department, which makes this album far more of a grower and even an acquired taste. It isn't really accessible to those who prefer a more straightforward strain of melodeath with a symphonic edge as found in Eternal Tears Of Sorrow or Omnium Gatherum, yet is a bit too polished to really play to the lower-fidelity atmospheric crowd. It is off in its own world, a lonely forest in a parallel dimension where few venture, but those manage to do so find a place rich with scenery and images to fill their daydreaming minds.\n",
        "\nI have always been looking for something that is truly unique. Something that I have never heard before. Today, it often feels like everything has already been done, and it is so hard to bring something original in the world. Very few times you can listen to a piece of music and say \"This has never been done before\". When you listen to \"The Forest Seasons\" you will not be saying that, because you will just have to shut up and listen. \n\nWintersun's third full length album is finally here. Long have we waited for this one, so expectations are huge and controversy is all over the place. This is an album that is entirely different from anything that was ever done before, in every possible way. It is a game changer. Everything from the music itself, to the artwork, to the way the album was promoted and to the recording is new. So we can easily say that this album is original. And it's Wintersun material so there is no question that it will be good. But is it amazing? If you ask me it's perfect. We are definitely going to see lots of opinions, from lots of different people who expected lots of different stuff from the band, and I'm pretty sure nobody expected what they actually received. This is the kind of album that you should listen to with no prejudice. Expect nothing. Just play it and see what happens. It is that surprising. I would also like to state that I am here to talk only about the music and the way that it was built. The crowdfunding campaign and the promotion of the album are a completely different story. \n\nAnd as I start talking about the actual music, let the praise begin. The idea of the seasons concept has probably been done before. Yet this album gives a whole new face to it. It consists out of four huge epic songs, each of them reflecting one of the seasons. The songwriting is quite simple compared to previous Wintersun albums but it's still top of the class. The guitars bring long repetitive riffs on this one. The diversity of the sound is created by lots of variations on an instrumental idea. Lead sections bring forth melodic ideas, blending perfectly with the vocals and the instrumental background. Vocals show beautiful clean singing, lots of harsh vocals, massive choirs and Jukka's low heavy death growls. The orchestration is also a lot easier to grasp than what happened on the \"Time\" album. You will find that overall, this album is a bit tuned down from the extreme complexity of songwriting and in terms of sound mixing as well. \n\nIf you know something about Wintersun, you know that with this band everything was always huge. They have always had this powerful epic sound with insane layers of samples and orchestrations, heavy guitars, grinding drums and massive choirs. But the problem with this sort of sound is that it is very hard to achieve, and requires high end gear and big budget production. That is why we have always been forced to wait for years in a row for a new album. For now, the waiting is over. We have finally seen a new album and it is because it's not so crazy anymore. It is something more accessible, easier to record, mix and master, and while Jari is doing all of these things, there is still a huge amount of work into it. Therefore a different sound should be expected. The thing with this album is that in order to sound right, all that fancy science fiction gear and production isn't necessary. In fact, as Jari himself states, the music would suffer from it. Jari has a very specific vision for his music and for once in his life that vision was within his reach. So the sound created by this shift in perspective is a bit more natural. The guitars have a harsh muddy sound created with a Vox Tonelab amplifier and the bass follows similar sounds. The overall sound is quite harsh on this album. Even the orchestrations are quite harsh, especially on the autumn song. The heavy death growls just put the cherry on top of the cake. What is really special about this sound is that it can easily reflect different moods and ideas, so that the songs that are quite different from each other still have a common vibe and complement each other beautifully. \n\nAnd what a perfect way to bring together four different epic songs into a cycle of perfection. Each of these songs has it's own distinct personality. It's as if they reflect each season as a living entity, bringing it's own power to the forest. The albums starts with spring, in the song \"Awaken From the Dark Slumber\". This song has two parts. The first part is \"The Dark Slumber\" describing the sleep before spring. It is quite dark and brings a truck load of metaphors about Jari's personal life and about the world in general. The great thing about the lyrics is that they are quite vague and you can easily connect with them. It's even better if you know Jari's history and you can realize where they actually come from. Also if we look at it simply related to spring and nature it is amazing again. For the first part it's like life is trapped under the ground awaiting rebirth. I just love it. For the second part there is a shift in the atmosphere. Everything goes more energetic and powerful as the forest seems to come to life. This part just makes you feel like you're greeting a blazing morning sun while still keeping a cooling breeze around. It's just so fresh. Some cool instrumentals bring grooving riffs and pounding drums and a lot of reprises from the first part but with a twist in perspective added towards them. The song evolves to a clean vocal choir recorded in two separate octaves by Jari, Jukka and Teemu. This is probably the most powerful part of the whole album. Overall this song feels like breathing new life. \n\nThen the warm summer arrives with \"The Forest That Weeps\". This song is still big and powerful but takes a rather sad vibe as it anticipates the darkness that follows. It's very expressive up to a point where it feels as if mountains are singing, just as the lyrics suggest. This is the first song to be written from the album. And while Jari felt the inspiration while he was in a forest I'm pretty sure that this song added the forest idea to the album. Everything came from this song and therefore kept the same vibe alive. The music itself is probably the simplest structure that Wintersun has created. It is long and repetitive and that might not feel right, but I wouldn't change a thing about it. It sounds a lot like a glorious anthem. This feeling might be because of the massive choir recorded by Jukka and Teemu alongside lots of musicians, some of them from bands like Ensiferum and Turisas. Overall this song feels like looking into a sunset. \n\nAt this point, the album takes a turn for the dark side. The autumn song starts with a slow dark atmospheric sound that gradually evolves. The intro feels like a growing shadow engulfing everything in it's path. The song grows gradually up to a point where it brings a fast pace with lots of blast beats and tremolo picking on the guitars. This song is probably the most technical and virtuous on the album. And it is definitely the darkest song to come out of Wintersun. This is a Finnish autumn and therefore no sun is seen and lots of metaphors bring one idea in front of us. Death! It is another multi part song that describes several stages of death and it is partly seen from death's point of view. If you look at the lyrics you will know where this is. The third part of the song comes to a more melodic side and also shows us an epic guitar solo with fast shreds and sweeps. Jari stated that this song is also about his father's death. As his father died in autumn, a part of that made it's way into the song and I feel like the lyrics in the third part of the song are just about that. The song ends abruptly and unexpectedly suggesting that death comes without warning, and overall, this song feels like falling into a black hole. \n\nAnd finally, the veil of snow is cast upon the forest, and the best song of the album slowly starts to emerge. From an insane wall of sound that is instantly demolished, a pure orchestral melody peeks its way back into your ears. It feels like deafening silence after a war. All that noise and rage as well as the life that was born in spring is now trapped under the snow, and in the end you are the only one awake. This is a masterful way to end an amazing record. The song \"Loneliness\" is one of the most sorrowful songs that Jari has ever written. This song is slow and quite repetitive. A haunting orchestral melody is present throughout the whole track as the guitars kick in and the best clean vocal performance is heard. The lyrics to this song are philosophical and profound. It contemplates the past and it's filled with regret as nothing can be done to change what has already happened. I can tell that this song is also very personal to Jari, as his past shows lots of personal failures in his vision and in this song he seems to pour everything that he felt sorry about. Just listen to it. Overall this song feels like wandering alone through fields of snow. \n\nAnd on that note the cycle is complete. And it would be wise to hit the repeat button. After listening to this album for the first time, I felt like I need a slap in my face. You just get lost in the beauty of it. Come to think that it is written and recorded by Jari alone in only 9 months. The guitars, drums and vocals are actual recordings and the drums and orchestrations are sampled on this one. Quite a good job for a one man band I might say. And it doesn't stop there. The beautiful booklet of the album, with the most expressive and beautiful images is also Jari's creation. And they are actual photos taken with a professional camera, and edited to look amazing. When looking at Jari and at this album I see somebody with a \"Do it yourself\" kind of attitude. The forest seasons is a truly masterful album and when you think of the conditions available for it's recording it's even more impressive. I would ask myself how much genius did God pour into this person, but I always have to remember that Jari is God.\n\nEnjoy!\n",
        "\nWintersun's long awaited third full-length album \"The Forest Seasons\" has an absolutely spectacular background story. Through the course of this rocky endeavour we've learned (at least) two things. The first, and very encouraging thing, being that a band doesn't need an enormous fan base to make some serious dough in the modern music industry. In this perspective this is a story about a relatively small extreme metal band from Finland with loyal and dedicated fans making history together. Because no matter how you look at it, Wintersun cashing a check for almost \u20ac500k after two months crowdfunding is huge. It's the most successful indiegogo campaign of its kind and an unprecedented collaboration between a metal band and its fans - one for the books! Jari M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4 and his fellow band mates have managed to pull together an insanely successful album launch, con artists or not. \n\nOn the other hand we've also learned a second thing. There're a lot of dudes out there with severe anger-issues who really, really dislikes when a band asks for money. In every way this has been a successful enterprise, it has also been one followed by blunt hatred. Every video, picture and post has been drenched with hateful and ridiculing comments. The sad excuses of vertebrates engaging in this crap has worked overtime to ensure that Wintersun fails. They grinned scornfully when the campaign was launched and professed there was no chance in hell Wintersun would ever reach the goal of \u20ac150k. Well, it seems the laughter stuck in their throats with the huge success of the campaign. Yet the haters are not done. \n\nNow they turn their hate towards the album itself, the narrative being that this is a truly horrific effort, making all Wintersun fans who participated in the campaign utter fools for not heeding their prophetic warnings. The only problem is that this is, as noted by an almost unanimous metal press, complete bull shit. The album might not be the pure epic awesomeness as advertised in the campaign (what ever is?), but a very solid release nonetheless! And more importantly exactly what most Wintersun fans wanted.\n\n\"The Forest Seasons\" consists of four songs, each representing one of the seasons and thus created to generate a sentiment that suits with that particular time of year. This is done quite beautifully kicking of with a roaring and bombastic interpretation of spring called \"Awaken from the Dark Slumber\", followed by the pompously epic sing-a-long \"The Forest that Weeps\" and the dark, atmospheric black metalish \"Eternal Darkness\" and finally ending with the solemnly depressing winter song \"Lonliness\". \n\nThe album presents an overall more diverse soundscape compared to its predecessors ranging from epic bombasm via the raw and unpolished to solemn and beautiful. A perfectly balanced mix between old Ensiferum, later Dimmu Borgir and of course classic Wintersun. With that said \"The Forest Seasons\" is also quite repetitive within the songs itself reusing riffs at a level that sometimes becomes quite the stretch. Especially the darker tune \"Eternal Darkness\" suffers from this and might have been better of as a 5 minute raw explosion rather than being dragged out to 14 minutes. \n\nI like, however, the idea of creating longer and epic songs in general. For it is on tunes like \"Starchild\" and \"Sons of Winter and Stars\" that Wintersun has shined brightest in the past, and the concept works indeed beautifully on the remaining three tracks. While \"Awaken from the Dark Slumber\" and \"The Forest that Weeps\" are what you'd expect from Wintersun when it comes to musical style with their riff driven suit accompanied with lots of keyboards and choirs, \"Lonliness\" stands out breaking new ground with its epic extreme ballad format. Jari provides really nice vocals on this track as well combining harsh, angry growls with quite tender clean vocals. \n\nThe vocals on \"Lonliness\" aside, the individual performances is the album's true weak spot as it's really only one individual involved. A part from some backing and additional vocals by his men at arms, this is a M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4 solo effort which unfortunately means programmed drums. A shame, since the musical brains of Kai Hahto could've really lifted this effort to the next level. This is especially true for the already weaker track \"Eternal Darkness\" which get its fate as a mediocre track sealed by its tiresome blast beat loops. But then again, isn't this the whole idea behind the whole campaign? To secure the fundings to build a studio in order to be able to produce better things in the future? \n\nTo sum things up \"The Forest Seasons\" is a solid release. Nice riffs, epic feeling, varied soundscape and unfortunately little flawed by programmed drumming and a stretched \"Eternal Darkness\". The haters will keep on hating, but for me this definitely lives up to my expectations. I was never promised \"Time II\", \"a new \"Wintersun\" or crystal clear production. I was promised an epic album about the seasons of the forest produced with limited resources, and that's exactly what I got. As far as I'm concerned Wintersun can do what ever they want with the \u20ac50 I used to buy my \"Forest Package\", it was a well deserved gift and I'll have my wallet at the ready for the next campaign.\n",
        "\nThere it is - new officially released studio music by Wintersun and of course it's not \"Time II\". What, were you crazy enough to think 5 years and a lack of a \"proper\" recording studio are sufficient to capture the majestic epicness and beauty of the totally super duper epic ideas swirling in the head of Jari M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4? The sarcastic undertone aside, let's proceed with the review.\n\nI'm going to be honest - I did not buy this album. My listening experience is based on uploads to a certain portal with \"Tube\" in the name. The creator himself uploaded them there in full extent, saving me the trouble. Because seriously: if you permanently hear and see an artist obnoxiously begging you for money, you start to process, whether it is worth it to invest in what he is up to. Of course there is always a possibility, that the desired figures are somehow justified by the content he produces (or is going to produce), but after careful consideration I decided to refrain from buying the new Wintersun offering called \"The Forest Seasons\", and listen it through other channels instead.\n\nFirst thing that struck me was the riffing. Or rather a considerable lack of memorable riffs driving the songs. When I look back to earlier Wintersun works it has always been the opposite - the music was riff-driven from the get-go, with the rest attached to it. Of course the melody is being built by other means, but knowing how skilled and how proficiently Mr. M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4 is able to handle his guitars, this turns out to be a tad disappointing. Other than that the first two tracks roll along quite nicely. The ideas are there, the composition is all right, but it doesn't take long to recognize the writing pattern: first there's building up atmosphere in the first part of the song, then comes the obligatory breakdown calming things down and in the second part the main melody/riff is exploited. Rinse, repeat. Well, maybe apart from the Autumn song, which is a relentless assault of programmed black metal type blast beats on the listener's ears. Not only that, but the drums are way too high in the mix, which is really the thing that annoys the crap out of me in this song. It would be fine if the track was shorter, but having to listen to them for almost the entirety of a 14-minute long composition just gets you tired. Some good chants are present along the way and the mid-song appearing solo is also some good stuff, something more Wintersun-like. But lastly all this is not doing much for me, as the first part of the song simply discourages me too much. On top of that the ending is way to abrupt. This third track is the moment where the album loses momentum, ironically due to a fast-paced black metal-oriented song. The last track only strengthens that feeling, with its ballad-esque layout, but it is an \u201cOK\u201d song to end the album - although kind of bland, ultimately relaxing in a way. Nice vocals there Jari. It's something else, but nothing to be used too abundantly. Mr. M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4 should not rely on such songs to fill the playing time of his potential future albums too often - if there are any to come.\n\nYou might call it blasphemy, but listening to \"The Forest Seasons\", I sometimes feel like listening to a post-\"Spiritual Black Dimensions\" Dimmu Borgir record, if those were actually \u201cgood\u201d. You have the multiple melodic layers, pomposity, orchestration and so forth. Even the vocals (especially the clear parts at times), in combination with all the shit that is going on musically, kind of bring back memories of ICS Vortex efforts with DB. Since I brought around that comparison, let's put it that way: if you would put a DB sticker on it, I would be extremely surprised that the infamous Norwegians are able to produce such music. But it's not Dimmu Borgir, it's Wintersun, and since Mr. M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4 benchmarked his capabilities extremely high thanks to previous musical efforts, this self-proclaimed \"filler album\" before \"Time II\" (yea right, as if \"Time II\" is happening anytime soon, but that's beside the point) is simply not up to high Wintersun standards and feels rushed, despite all the efforts to make it not appear that way.\n\nIf you would strip it down to music alone, disregarding who created the album and all the fuzz that has been made before the release, it sort of grows on you after a couple of spins but all in all - \"The Forest Seasons\" as an album does not make the earth shatter. It's decent on the brink of being good, but lastly not working as a whole. It's really hard to put all the accompanying antics surrounding Wintersun aside. We all know all too well that Jari can do better but I think he got lost in his own crazy world a bit. Yet I'm not here to judge the person, but to rate the album. And the album is, in the end, somewhat enjoyable but it ultimately lacks consistency and focus at times. Filler it was deemed, filler it is. But not the worst one, I'll give it that.\n",
        "\nI'll just start by saying I like everything about this album. I've given it quite a lot of spins and I could barely find any faults at all. It is definitely an album that should be listened with no expectations or prejudice at all. It is completely different from all past Wintersun material or anything else I've ever listened to. And I have seen quite a lot of people being frustrated about the simplicity of this album, in comparison to their previous material.\n\nThe 4 monumental songs go through a very wide range of different moods from catchy riffs and soaring hooks (Awaken from the Dark Slumber) to apocalyptic black metal sounds (Eternal Darkness) or slow tempos filled with pain and sorrow (Loneliness). What I find truly amazing is how all the songs are so different from each other and stand so well on their own while still being perfectly fit to be on the same album and coming together perfectly. Every song represents a season and clearly exposes Jari Maenpaa's vision about it by creating a certain feel.\n\nThe spring song (Awaken from the Dark Slumber) is all about awakening as it's title suggests. The first part (The Dark Slumber) is quite dark and creates an image of total stillness, absence and emptiness. It's made to sound as if all life and all the elements of the universe are locked somewhere in a different dimension. Or at least that's how I see it. I think this is where you will find the best lyrics in the entire album, if not in all Wintersun discography! I was most pleasantly surprised by the choice of words \"There was no sound\", \"There was no light , \"There was no life\" ,\"There was no death\". I'm finding it quite hard to describe the feeling since it's quite abstract and deep but I see it as complete absence. As a result the second part, \"The Awakening\" seems even more energetic than it normally would since it describes this \"explosion\" of life, like everything bursts out of nowhere. This is the most catchy part of the album and it simply makes me feel alive in every possible way! It creates a huge contrast in comparison to the first part by using lively drums and riffs, soaring choir like key samples and Jari's punchy, energetic false chord growls accompanied by Jukka Koskinen's ground shaking low growls that seem to be a key element for the entire album and especially for the third song, Eternal Darkness (Autumn). But the best part is the choir on the chorus. That is just made for singing along and for goosebumps all over!\n\nAnd this brings me to the summer song, \"The Forest That Weeps\". The chorus is made entirely by a choir sounding as if the trees and mountains themselves are singing! And there's also that lead section in the middle that I found quite interesting. It's very energetic and I really like the way it evolves. This is probably my least favourite song on the album since it's the most repetitive but it's still a masterpiece in it's entirety. This and the spring song are to me the ones that bring the \"forest\" in \"The Forest Seasons\". \n\nThe second half of the album is not that much about the forest. The autumn song is actually the soundtrack for death! It is pure black metal and by far the most terrifying song I've ever heard. Also it is home for one of the most epic solos that Jari has ever written, easily comparable to the ones of \"Winter Madness\" and \"Time\". \"Eternal darkness\" might seem rather stale at first since the melodies are really hard to distinguish. All guitars seem somehow buried in the mix under the storm of blast beats and screams but after a few spins I could really get to hear all of it. What I can say is that this song takes patience. It clearly illustrates an evil omnipresent entity reversing all life. It is simply the opposite to \"The Awakening\". I think that the most important moments in this song are the creepy long intro, the guitar solo and the sudden unexpected ending when all sound stops.\n\nThe winter song, \"Loneliness\", starts slowly filling the gap left by the sudden stop of \"Eternal Darkness\" by slowly fading in with melancholic key samples. \"Loneliness\" is probably the purest, most emotional song Wintersun has ever released. That reflects mainly in the outstanding vocal performance of Jari Maenpaa and in the amazing lyrics. It is an ideal closure to the album and it sets a mood that will stay with you for quite a while after the album is finished. \n\nSomething truly remarkable about this album is how easily it creates the perfect ambience for the idea of the forest. It makes you sink into a different world and feel the connection with nature. And there are a lot of elements contributing to this feel. The mix is quite raw and muddy, obviously not perfect. At times certain melodies may be difficult to distinguish but this is exactly why it fits the album. It's not that hi-tech and science fiction and that I think makes the album sound more natural and brings life into it. The artwork also creates this feel, especially the bark texture on the wooden frames and the Wintersun logo. The booklet also helps you understand this vision of the forest and of nature since the pictures were actually taken in the forest that inspired the concept of the album.I also liked the idea of making every band member to represent a different season. The forest seasons is an amazing album anyway you put it and I would strongly recommend it to anyone. All the elements from songwriting and lyrics to the booklet and album cover are perfectly put together to create a very unusual experience and you should really enjoy every second of it.\n",
        "\nSo, here we are. Current metal's most polarizing figure Jari has finally released a new Wintersun album (let's say this is even less of a Wintersun album as Prometheus was an Emperor album). \n\nThe backstory of this release is well documented, discussed and still rising eyebrows, fists, insults, praises, tears and everything in between, so this is the very short version of it: Jari claims he can't deliver future releases (namely Time II) unless he gets a whole brand new studio all for himself, so he wrote this album to deliver it as a reward for the first of 3 crowdfunding campaigns he launched to reach the colossal EUR 750.000 he needs the whole building (the digital album purchase is EUR 50).\n\nThe main question was: will this album deliver in terms of quality to justify such massive crowdfunding? My short answer is NO.\n\nBefore getting into the album more in detail, I think it's fair to say that Jari is a very talented guy. He is a great guitar player, great singer on both harsh and clean vocals and in my book he has a very good ear for melody, as well as some fairly good written riffs.\n\nThe Forest Seasons concept according to Jari was to reflect every season with a song, all linked with the nature that surrounds him, so we have 4 tracks clocking over 10 minutes each. This is not a problem, when the music is written well enough to keep the listener interested on long pieces, which is one of the problems to be found here. \n\nProduction is on the plastic side of things. Drums are programmed (maybe bass as well) and up front of the mix. The guitar tone is kinda digital, especially the rhythm tracks that are a tad lower on the mix than they should. The one thing that sounds well is vocals. Keys play a sort of minor role on the album, since they are just supporting the rest. It doesn't help either that Jari did everything and the rest of the band showed up just to make backing vocals.\n\n Awakening from the Dark Slumber (Spring) starts the album in a very strong note. This song was written with dedication and has plenty of ideas, changes in intensity and the most important thing, Jari had a clear musical motif to work here, which he develops in a very good way; the basic harmonic structure is presented in the first half of the song and the whole progression is shown on the second half. The section that starts at 11:00 is just great. Everything from that point until the end was really well written, so the heavy epic break to the excellent galloping clean choir not unlike Ensiferum's first albums to the end. This track is easily the best of the album, actually one of the best songs Jari has done with Wintersun to my taste.\n\nAs much talent Jari has, he still has problems to write long and interesting songs in a larger amount, since the album from this point onwards is plagued by useless repetition of sections, which is very evident on  The Forest That Weeps (Summer) . Now, just like the Spring one, it has a clear motif to work, but Jari just repeated the same thing ad nauseam. The clean choir that serves as chorus is played like 10 times and it's epic effect disappears just after the second, maybe third time. Jari has a great clean voice and he deliver it with passion, but c'mon, this song could have been a 4 minute song and nothing would have been lost. The verse riff is pretty dull as well, so the sections between choruses are quite boring. The mandatory break at the middle of the song adds nothing and has little to do with the rest and then Jari repeated the clean chorus just for the sake of it.\n\nOne thing that on paper looked good was Jari's attempt to get a colder atmosphere more akin to black metal than melodic death metal. This approach is fitting for Autumn and he tried to get a dark and cold feeling with tremolo riffs and blastbeats, but the drum programming is too evident, flat and the riffs are just too generic. Things get slightly better once the mandatory slower melodic break enters, but the long guitar solo feels out of place and Jari, in a very Vital Remains/later Death way, copy/pasted the first half again just to get the song longer in length.\n\nAnd to finish, Jari chose to use a very cheesy, slow semi ballad where he experimented with clean vocals, getting awful results. This is his worst song ever which I won't hear ever again.\n\nSo, the album actually reflects well its background; it's an album released by Jari almost by himself to feed the crowd with something in the meanwhile he gets his top end studio where he can just walk on pijamas and record the best music ever written by any human being (quoting Jari from the Forest docu).\n\nI believe that the album had the potential to be actually great, but it was rushed, probably due the crowdfunding schedule. I also think he can reach totally pro results with the gear he already has. He just lacks the know how for mixing and mastering.\n\nWith the EUR 500.000 Jari got from the 1st campaign, they can record like 25-30 albums with the best production of the planet already. The next album better be a hell of an album and not just due the super glossy production it will eventually have (if he ever records another thing, he can just get away with the money, you know?), but also I hope Jari pushes himself to the limit and writes worthwhile songs. Lastly, if you have a band, FUCKING USE IT.\n",
        "\nOoh boy, this was always going to be a fun one! The incomprehensible farce that is Wintersun has been summarised by hundreds of reviewers the world over - but now it's my turn! It feels like a reviewer's rite of passage to lay down their opinions on this situation. Wintersun's 2004 opus is a remarkable piece of symphonic melodic death metal that begged for a quick follow up. Seven years later, the hilariously ironically-titled Time was released; a sophomore 'album' that only contained five tracks, two of which were interludes. At this point, Jari himself began to single-handedly ruin his professional reputation. Childishly arguing with his label; years promising people Time II (which is looking as likely as a new Tool album); and a funding campaign that was so unbelievable, Alestorm felt it was worth parodying. An incredible songwriter he may be, but I pray to Quorthorn I never have to work in a studio with this man, for fear he may crowdfund me to death.\n\nThe main reason for the crowdfunding venture? To raise enough money for Wintersun to have their own studio where they can produce music to the quality of which they will be satisfied. This begs two questions. Firstly, if they are so unhappy with their current recording situation, why are they content to allow fans to pay extortionate amounts (50 Euros!) for an album that has been recorded in said situation? But more bewilderingly, have you heard Time I?! The production quality is absolutely stunning! How much more can you possibly want from a studio? A fucking jacuzzi?! I understand those who may cry that reviews should be purely about the music - and to an extent, I wholeheartedly agree - however, Jari has made such a massive fuss over his recording methods throughout the years, he almost deserves to have it thrown back in his face. Call me a dinosaur, but I miss the days of 'write album - record album - sell album'. I hear some bands still do that somewhere... So this brings us to the present day - the release of Wintersun's brand new full-length studio LP: The Forest Seasons. It's...not good.\n\nComprising of four tracks, all over 12 minutes long, each representing a season of the year, The Forest Seasons sounded like a dream to me (Moonsorrow could've pulled this off magically!) - but this is the biggest disappointment in musical terms. No track is distinguishable as being representative of its assigned season. Perhaps you could argue that the blast-beat mania throughout \"Autumn\" is an allegory for the raging wind? Ugh, I'm really clutching at metaphorical straws here. \"Spring\" and \"Summer\" are almost duplicates, both possessing some of that Wintersun spark - especially during the choral choruses - but ultimately failing to detach from each other in terms of atmosphere. Writing about all four seasons brings Jari out of his comfort zone, as he is now required to write about weather conditions other than snow. Therefore, the lyrics become hideously generic. Faced with the task of avoiding words like 'frost' for spring, summer and autumn, he has instead resorted to the other characteristic Wintersun themes: 'sorrow', 'darkness', 'death'...yawn.\n\nBarely anything feels exciting. Hell, it's not until two and a half minutes into the second track that we hear something that can be loosely defined as a 'riff'. It's not as if the man can't compose! 2012's \"Sons Of Winter & Stars\" is one of the greatest metal songs ever written, period. Such density, so many layers, recurring themes and a sense of build-up and release that provides some of metal's most explosively emotional moments. So why does \"Spring\" consist of hooting owls for a minute, before whimpering into action with droning, simplistic 4/4 rhythms that last for almost the entire 14 minutes?! It's a pleasant enough sound, but not even a fraction of the excitement I know Jari is capable of creating. I can't believe I'm saying this - but Wintersun made an album of background music. In an almost comical twist, \"Winter\" turns out to be the most god-awful bore-fest of the lot - attempting to be reflective, but becoming totally self-indulgent. \n\nSo what does The Forest Seasons get right? Despite my criticisms of \"Autumns\" structural variation (or lack thereof), the constant blackened fury is a refreshing change of style. Jari's voice is, admittedly, incredible. His wailing in \"Winter\" is powerful at the top of his range; and each time he screams \"awaken from the dark, dark slumber!\" - it's reminiscent of the impassioned impact he had in Time I. Jukka Koskinen's deep growls are also one of the band's biggest assets, adding a basting of grittiness to the low end. But the biggest slap in the face? The production quality is sub-par. The guitars have no discernible bite, the bass is almost inaudible, the vocals are way too far forward in the mix, and the snare has no idea where to sit. For a man who prides himself (and subsequently made a fool of himself) over his producing work, The Forest Seasons sounds almost hilariously bad; not a funny kind of hilarious, more salt-in-the-wound irony. Too much has been said about this band over the past seven years, and I'm only creating a whirlwind in a maelstrom. The bottom line: The Forest Seasons is not a good album, and Wintersun are taking the piss. Now I'll let those words fade away into obscurity as they're clouded by the hordes of die-hards Jari has inexplicably managed to conjure up.\n",
        "\nTo make the intent of this review clear prior to delving in - yes, its circumstances (crowdfunding, back catalogue, Jari's attitude etc.) will come into its score. You may think this is unfair and if so, fair enough, but I consider it entirely relevant for reasons discussed inside the review. If you're wanting an entirely musical review, feel free to read another.\n\nHistory lesson for the unnuitiated: The debut album came out in 2004 shortly after Jari's tenure with Ensiferum came to an end, and has since become a highly heralded example of melodic death metal tinged with a variety of different extreme metal styles. Though it was very far from the almost playful viking metal tones of Ensiferum, it wasn't too dissimilar. Wintersun also incorporated elements of power metal, occasional blasts of black metal and a taste for symphonics that might make mid-era Dimmu Borgir blush. Yes, it was slathered in cheese, but that's more of an observation than a criticism. One of the real attractions was Jari's guitar wizardry, however. His over the top solo displays and memorable riffing made the record a very memorable, catchy and surprisingly diverse and unifying experience.\n\nTime was promised two years later in 2006. You can then pick from the list of about 84 different excuses, from noise outside of his apartment to 64-bit VST plugins (what?), but the album never came into fruition until 2012. Or at least, half of it (what???). It was really good, if divisive - the symphonics were hugely over-the-top and this was a turn off for many. But the ambitious and pinpoint focussed songwriting, the massive arrangements, the huge improvements to the vocals and the catchy riffs were all present and in spades and I was practically drooling for the second half to arrive. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me 84 times... well. Here we are. We're still waiting for Time II because he wasn't happy with how the first half sounded and wants to build his own studio to make it sound 'perfect'.\n\nThe Forest Seasons is basically a stopgap recording. I expect he's basically using it to fulfil his contract to Nuclear Blast [citation needed] so that he can then use the money from his crowdfunding to go his own way to make the albums he wants to. But here's the crux of the problem, and it's a huge problem - The Forest Seasons is crap. It cannot even dream of holding a candle to the regular Wintersun canon because it doesn't even make an attempt of it. It makes the points raised in the crowdfunding all the more confusing. He says he can't continue working in the current conditions and then delivers this stinker of an album after two great albums that came from the aforementioned unworkable conditions. There are practically no riffs, the symphonics are a mess and there is absolutely no focus of precision to any of these tracks at all. Jari and co should be schooling the rest of the bands they influenced by now and yet here they blunder around like a viking metal band that have just stumbled into Wacken to get drunk and sell merch.\n\nOkay, that was harsh, but it isn't far from the truth (50 euros for a digital package, and threatening not to release it at all if they didn't reach the Kickstarter goal? Fucking hell, guys.). They did, of course, reach the goal, and here we are now post-release. My above statements require some substantiation so here's my stab at it.\n\nDelving deeper musically, it's a trite premise but not one that can't work - a representation of the four seasons each clocking between 12 to 14 minutes, give or take. Jari made the transition between condensed and concise tracks to longer, more bombastic epics rather gracefully with the likes of 'Sons of Winter and Stars' so I had little apprehension going into this record. However, three of the four movements lack the pinpoint focus of Jari's previous works, each falling into the trap of attempting to build tension but instead simply plodding along in needlessly simplistic movements for far too long. Simplicity can work, but in these The Forest that Weeps is by far the biggest example of this issue, much of the first half of the track reserved for this uninspiring display; a wash of indistinct synth over the most rudimentary mid-paced one-note-power-chord fest that my mind is puzzled that Jari has even attempted to pass off as legitimate with a straight face.\n\nAwaken from the Dark Slumber and The Forest that Weeps (Spring and Summer respectively) both take nods from the Ensiferum days of Jari's canon, but don't really take enough of the energy and potency to really keep up. Be it the placement or the lack of buildup, or perhaps the lack of vigor overall in these tracks, but the placement of both the choirs in Spring and Summer just sound gaudy and garish. The clumsy vocal melody of Summer really doesn't help matters, either. A good portion of the first 6 minutes of The Forest Seasons' arguably most aggressive number, Autumn, is reserved for a riffless affair of indistinct synth washes void any memorability - something that Jari has never had an issue with in the past. The track approaches redemption when the lead guitars come back into prominence but the context of the album becomes very distracting at this point. In terms of rewarding song structure, instrument interplay, pleasing melodies, technicality or complexity, Jari has outclassed this in his sleep ten times over his past work.\n\nConsidering the above criticisms, then, it's odd that the most simplistic of the movements is the only one Jari really nailed on this offering. A slower, melancholic affair of slower riffs and atmospheric leanings with Jari's most ballad-like track to date. The progression and flow of this track seem natural and fitting, and one cannot speak highly enough about the brief but unexpected melodic riffwork two-thirds through to break up the slow, dirge-like pace. Further, it's by far Jari's strongest clean vocal performance to date, and a strong testimony to the idea that Jari does still have something to offer when he plays to his strengths. At least, rather than than heaping on the gimmicks that a gaggle of individuals wearing cheap Thorr's Hammer pendants from festival markets have deemed 'epic'. The stark contrast in quality extends to the production too - The Forest Seasons sounds brash and unrefined, with synths that go from sounding squashed and meagre to overpowering the next. Worse still, the rhythm guitar has absolutely no idea where to sit in the mix and the drums sound clinical and flat with a snare that sounds completely isolated from everything else, with vocals far too high, making every time Jari comparing himself to the weather in first-person (whilst screaming, to top it off) all the more cringe-worthy.\n\nThe Forest Seasons weaves so effortlessly between sounding on point and frankly dated in the blink of an eye, drawing from a creative pool that Jari long since forewent since even his Ensiferum-era. It's disheartening to see these tracks move through the motions like clockwork in such predictable ways doing everything that, frankly, you'd expect every second-rate viking metal band to be using as part of their bag of tricks. You can criticize Time I's stylistic decisions all you like, but The Forest Seasons in comparison is a regressive backtrack that all but forgets its predecessors compositional accomplishments; a stopgap recording that I'm frankly still trying to figure out what Wintersun is trying to prove with its existence. If the delays of Time I and the indefinite delay of Time II wasn't enough of an indicator, The Forest Seasons stands as a testament to the fact that rather than a brand new studio to record in, Jari and the gang need to go back to the drawing board with a fresh slate, a renewed vigor and an open mind to ever dream of being able to deliver on the ambitions they so clearly want to share with us. \n\nSure, it's a frustrating situation to judge an album primarily by the situation of which it was conceived. However, Wintersun have dug that hole of a situation so deep for themselves that they entirely deserve to be judged by it, and by this regressive stopgap recording with little to offer. Which worst of all, the band almost certainly know.\n",
        "\nWintersun are back with their 3rd full-length album and boasting a faster turn-around time than ever before. It only took 5 years this time, guys and gals! After the years and years of woes surrounding Wintersun\u2019s inability to complete a fully realized \u201cTime\u201d album, Jari and crew decided that, in order to please fans with their music while also gathering the necessary equipment, it was time to try out a crowd funding campaign complete with a new album, re-masters of old albums, some cool artwork, and, at the shining peak of the insane goal, funding enough for a monumental recording studio. Long story short, it succeeded! Jari and crew are over halfway to their dreams, and to celebrate, let\u2019s crack open \u201cThe Forest Seasons\u201d and see what music hides inside its gorgeous cover. \n\nRight out of the gate you will notice the epic song lengths. 4 songs. 4 seasons. 12-15 minutes a piece: let\u2019s get started on this monumental journey spanning 365 days. After the massive success of their first 10+ minute song: \u201cSons of Winter and Stars\u201d from \u201cTime I,\u201d I thought I was in for an epic treat, unfortunately, I was not met with immediate bombast, but, instead, many mid paced moments sprinkled with occasional genius. That\u2019s not to say that the songs are terrible, but they are not what I was expecting and a bit jarring. Jari mentioned in interviews that the album would be more geared to a less over-the-top endeavor, and this album is definitely more grounded. It has a black or doom metal vibe to it without being black or doom metal. I can appreciate the attempt here to have songs conforming to that type of structure; however, I believe it does not lend itself well to melodic death metal. Melodic death metal lends itself more to power metal and, well, death metal. That is, to say, galloping drums, blistering speed, technicality, and many twists and turns. \u201cThe Forest Seasons\u201d does not do this, and I think it suffers for it. It has the tendency to sit on one idea for too long and it becomes tedious. I think an idea like this can work, mind you, I just don\u2019t think it can work for this genre in more than short bursts. \n\nI\u2019d like to compare this album with another, somewhat similar album, and my personal favorite album: \u201cHyperion\u201d by the band Manticora. \u201cHyperion\u201d is an album I\u2019ve been meaning to review for years; I can simply never find the words to convey the absolute adoration I have for that album. Who knows, maybe giving it a short comparison here will help me finally write that review. I\u2019d like to talk about \u201cEternal Darkness (Autumn)\u201d off of \u201cThe Forest Seasons\u201d and compare it to \u201cA Long Farewell\u201d off of the aforementioned \u201cHyperion.\u201d One digressive point of comparison between these two bands is that I think Jari\u2019s clean vocals sound similar to those of Lars Larsen, vocalist for Manticora. Also, the albums in question are both their respective bands 3rd albums, though Manticora\u2019s turn-around time was just over a year rather than 5. The main, on topic, point of comparison is that these two tracks are the darkest and most bombastic of their respective albums. \u201cEternal Darkness (Autumn),\u201d to me, is the biggest offender of this repeating the same idea to tedium mistake that permeates this entire album. It all comes down to one thing: the blast beats. 4 straight minutes of blast beats at the beginning and end of the song gets tiresome. Quickly. And, after just one or two minutes, I\u2019m ready to shut the whole thing off. The main thing that bugs me is that this is a 14-minute song that feels like 25 because very little gets changed besides some background keyboard work. To make matters worse, despite feeling like 25 minutes, it is also as if there are only 7-8 minutes of real content here that get dragged out to absurd lengths. Getting bombarded with a wall of sound via blast beats with little change makes everything turn monotonous extremely fast. Manticora follows a similar wall of sound approach, but, instead, make quick changes, don\u2019t use blast beats, have an underlying keyboard with occasional front line melodies, and utilize an overall production that creates a palpable ooze of dark atmosphere. Not to mention they actually use bass guitar well and throw in hints of thrash and doom in tempo changes that refresh my interest constantly. Manticora turn \u201cA Long Farewell\u201d into the antithesis of \u201cEternal Darkness (Autumn)\u201d by making a 9 minute song feel like 6 minutes, while also boasting complex, tightly written content that feel likes there is at least 15 minutes of composition shoved into it. I would like to go on to compare every Wintersun song on this album to a Manticora song, but you get the idea and I gotta save some of my points for my actual \u201cHyperion\u201d review.\n\nDespite a warranted yet rather unfair comparison, there are moments I very much enjoyed on this record! Don\u2019t worry! Individual moments I enjoyed, while sometimes few and far between, are extremely enjoyable, and scratch that itch for a particular type of music that I believe only Wintersun can produce. For instance, \u201cEternal Darkness (Autumn)\u201d has a very enjoyable mid section. The fast section at about 5 minutes, while somewhat lacking compared to my favorite albums, does hit a nice mix of bombast and cool orchestration. We also get a near minute long guitar solo -- which is a Jari special at this point. I love it! I do wish he would give us more than one solo an album, though. The unreleased \u201cTime II\u201d song \u201cThe Way of the Fire\u201d has two solos, and they\u2019re both insane from what I\u2019ve heard from live recordings. Stop holding out on me, man! The ending of \u201cAwaken from the Dark Slumber (Spring)\u201d is another masterful moment and is essentially \u201cSons of Winter and Stars\u201d 2. It contains an amazing payoff to an already awesome song. There are also some great choir choruses, in general; any band can win me over with some sing-along power metal choruses. Another section that I enjoyed was the middle of \u201cThe Forest that Weeps (Summer).\u201d Here, the way they utilize a similar sounding riff works well, and there is enough different that it keeps my attention. This happens quite a few times, the mid-paced stuff isn\u2019t bad but it shows up a bit too much for my liking. Once again, a downside is it is slightly too slow and meandering. This album lacks the bombast the first two Wintersun records had in spades. I ache for the furious speed and melody of \u201cStarchild.\u201d \n\nThat leaves us with \u201cLoneliness (Winter).\u201d More like \u201cWinter Madness\u201d and less like \u201cLand of Snow and Sorrow,\u201d please. I don\u2019t mind a slow song, but I do mind if it\u2019s 25% of the album AND the closer. You\u2019re putting me to sleep here. I love your vocals, Jari, and the guitar melody near the end is great, but that amounts to 2 minutes of a 13-minute song. There is not enough here to keep me coming back, there is less here than \u201cLand of Snow and Sorrow\u201d and that song was 5 minutes shorter. \n\nI appreciate what Wintersun were trying here. However, I think it falls short in a number of areas. For every great moment there\u2019s a mediocre moment. Melodic death metal contrasts too much with black and doom metal to make song and album structures like this work. Most of the content of this album cancels itself out. I enjoyed Spring, especially the ending, I liked Summer well enough, Autumn was very polarizing but probably more good than bad, and Winter exists. I went in wanting to love this album, but it stumbles, trips and manages to fall on the good side of middling, boring albums. I hope everything works out for Wintersun, I still need my album versions of \u201cThe Way of the Fire\u201d and, hey, if I could get re-recorded versions of your Immemorial stuff, Jari, I will fund your next campaign! Here\u2019s hoping the next album is right around the corner, a bit shorter, and a bit more \u201cWinter Madness\u201d.\n",
        "\nCan you disscciate an artist from his art? This is a very difficult question. It's up to each individual to answer it. Jari M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4 is at constant war with his label, tries to lure fans into spending an exaggerated amount of money to support his megalomaniac visions and has offended numerous supporters with his questionable release strategies. The Forest Seasons is a very controversial release. Instead of the promised second part of Time, this record is more like a filler release which was nearly entirely made by Jari M\u00e4enp\u00e4a. He performed vocals, played the guitar and the bass, worked out the keyboard orchestrations, programmed drums and percussion and even took care of the mastering and production. The name Wintersun on the album cover is pretty much a lie because this is nothing but a Jari M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4 solo record. Many people didn't give this record a chance because of those controversial circumstances. Others genuinely hated the album. Some praised this release as a masterpiece. While reviews are always subjective, most people had a biased judgement of this release because of its release history and often failed to solely analyze the qualities of the final product. Just take a look at the numerous reviews on the internet. I'm aware that this is difficult but this is what I'm going to try now that this formal introduction is out of the way. I will dissociate the artist from his art.\n\nThe Forest Seasons is a positive surprise to me. The predecessor included two instrumental tracks out of five songs, sounded all over the place concerning the instruments, the production and even the songwriting and had massive ups and downs concerning its quality. The Forest Seasons has a simpler and more coherent topic, structure and instrumental guideline. The record has a great flow and rarely feels out of focus. There are no filler instrumentals, overtly overproduced orchestral passages and this album isn't the first part of something either. Each of the four tracks has some positively outstanding elements. The songs all make sense separately and as a whole unit. The opener \"Awaken from the Dark Slumber\" has an appeasing atmospheric overture that gets you into a hypnotizing and relaxing mood before the song evolves into a gripping symphonic extreme metal track that takes the better elements from both black and death metal with cold riffs and harsh vocals before the songs ends with an epic finale thanks to majestic choirs. In my book, this might be the best song in the history of Wintersun or even the greatest track Jari M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4 has ever written. \"The Forest That Weeps\" convinces with its vivid folk influences and epic choirs, \"Eternal Darkness\" surprises with the record's best guitar solo and an abrupt finale and \"Loneliness\" is a melancholic mid-tempo track that takes its time to develop a haunting atmosphere. All four songs are at least clearly above average and I would consider the opener a nearly excellent track and the closer almost on the same level.\n\nThe record also has a few imperfections however, especially in the middle section. \"The Forest That Weeps\" has an overlong and repetitive middle section despite being the shortest song on this release. The track would have sounded much more compact and impactful if it had been three minutes shorter. \"Eternal Darkness\" suffers from uninspired and clinical blastbeats throughout the track's most important passages. The record's biggest issue is the production. The drum computer sound is clinical and takes away from an otherwise vivid atmosphere. The lead guitar riffs are sometimes static and buried under the keyboard orchestrations. The production isn't as overloaded as the predecessor's but would have been much better with a more dynamic and organic sound. \n\nOn the other side, the choirs and orchestrations sound majestic and the diversified vocals sound very gripping, no matter if they are rooted in the black, death, folk or even power metal genres.\n\nAn additional positive aspect is the absolutely stunning cover artwork which is one of the most gorgeous I have ever seen. It really captures the four seasons and the spirit of nature. As someone who loves nature, I can really relate to the artwork, some of the lyrics and most of the music.\n\nFrom a point of view that solely focuses on the final product, The Forest Seasons is a very good album and a highlight for epic folk metal and symphonic extreme metal fans. It's a very creative, detailed and diversified album that does its ambitious topic justice and brings the different seasons and the spirit of nature to life. Only the flawed production and a few repetitions in the songwriting keep this record away from being a serious contender for metal album of the year. It's definitely a record to discover over and over again which justifies a purchase rather than just listening to it via Bandcamp or other legal streaming websites.\n\nNow, if you can't dissociate the artist and his art, I might understand that you wouldn't want to purchase this release. If you are however able to do so, I would recommend you to buy this gem.\n",
        "\nI am not a smart man. I'm no professional musician, so I have no idea how to write music at such a level. As a result, I don't know if this album was worth the near decade long wait. In fact, I'll never know - by the time I knew of Time I's existence, it had already been out for around 4 years. So Instead, I'll try to review this as a standalone album (even so far as to ignore it being a part one), and also try to ignore all the surrounding controversy, both back then and now (I have yet to touch The Forest Seasons).\n\nI'll get this out of the way right now: the production job is really good, creating a haunting atmosphere. All the instruments, both \"real\" and synthesized, are incredibly well balanced, with nothing sounding cheap. Another thing I need to praise is Jari's voice, both clean and harsh. I don't think it gets enough recognition.\n\nWith that in mind, the album does have one problem that becomes fairly substantial by the end: too much everything. This isn't too noticeable at the start of the disk (more on that in a bit), but by \"Time\" everything is fighting for the listener's attention, with melodies stacked on melodies stacked on vocals stacked on more vocals. What's bizarre is how \"Time\" is no more complex than \"Sons of Winter and Stars\" yet the former seems much more haphazardly put together than the latter. \n\nThat seems to be a reoccurring theme on this album: the first two tracks are ultimately superior to rest of the album - to the point of saving the album from mediocrity. Seriously, if you take away one thing from this review, it's that the first two songs are definitely worth a listen. The rest of the album isn't terrible by any stretch of the imagination, but it isn't fantastic, either. \"Land of Snow and Sorrow\" doesn't really go anywhere with what it has, and both \"Darkness and Frost\" and \"Time\" don't develop much, even with the melodies from the other songs (This may be why they have that \"bloated\" feel). \n\nI may sound like I hate this album, but I don't. I just heard about it, and listened to it. I didn't have an agonizing eight year wait. Instead, I had an above average symphonic melodeath EP. Is that a crime? I don't think so.\n",
        "\nIf you were ever wondering when metal would spawn its next cult of personality figure, Jari M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4 gave a resounding answer when he broke from Ensiferum and formed Wintersun. This man might be the most polarizing figure of heavy music in the past decade or more. Seemingly, there's no in-between once you get to know him. Once a person gazes upon Jari's goofy face and eminently punch-able smirk, it's love or hate.\n\nWell, almost. Whatever you think of Jari, there's no denying his technical talent on the guitar, and his vocals have graced some of Ensiferum's better moments. His ability to own a recording in all its parts from beginning to end is certainly laudable as well. Indeed, it seems some of Jari's strongest detractors have come to loathe him precisely because they used to respect his contributions to his former band, and on Wintersun's debut album.\n\nBut those early days are gone. Current-day Jari M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4 has drifted away from what many loved in the past, and, after several very public meltdowns worthy of Axl Rose, we are left with musical output at a snail's pace and an obsession for perfection that gets in the way too often. Even those who still wait for his next work with anticipation express frustration over his antics.\n\nAt the moment, though, the frustration and weirdness that comes from Jari's Helsinki apartment takes a back seat. All is forgiven. Perhaps not, but for the time being there is something real to rant about, or rave, depending on your perspective.\n\nListening through The Forest Seasons for the first time, I immediately decided to wait for a little while before putting virtual pen to paper about it. These are long songs, very densely recorded with multiple layers, and nearly impossible to appreciate at a first or even second glance. I wanted to have some time to sift through the different parts, and hopefully pick up on pieces that grow on me over time, as well as those that annoy me more & more with each listen.\n\nI'm glad I did because as I let this thing marinate for a little while, I began to fall into a middle ground that I think relatively few people reach regarding any of Wintersun's music. Recorded solely by Jari from an instrumental standpoint, and including his bandmates only for backing vocals, this is unlike either of the other Wintersun albums. And it's likely different than anything they will do in the future, unless Jari decides to simply record everything himself and use others as tour musicians. I find that unlikely.\n\nIndeed, this feels a lot like a solo side project. The drums are programmed, albeit very well, but certainly not as lively as a real drummer. The guitars, while multi-layered and interesting, all possess Jari's particular phrasing and inflexion, allowing for none of the dynamics that come from two musicians playing off one another. The bass simply follows suit because, despite what some may think, good bass tracks take skill that doesn't always translate from a guitarist.\n\nAll this being said, I get a good deal of enjoyment from each of these songs. I don't think of The Forest Seasons as a purely pretentious exercise. Each of the tracks give me an image of the season it represents, from the majestic passages in The Forest That Weeps, to Awaken from the Dark Slumber with its airy melodies that bring to mind frolicking through the wilderness. I feel the rage and foreboding of the oncoming Winter while listening to Eternal Darkness, and also the baleful wallow of despair present in Loneliness.\n\nI understand the detractors, but I actually like how these songs are put together. There is some monotony to wade through, no doubt. Jari loves to take a single riff and roll through 100 variations of it before moving on to something else. Needless to say, that can make listening to parts of this album a chore. But some of the changeups are pretty damn good. The melodic piece that kicks of Part II of Awaken From the Dark Slumber is fantastic. I even like the backing keyboards; it adds a nice atmosphere to the guitar melody. And the planned solo in Loneliness is an intricate example of what can be done when a fantastic guitar player reins in his skills a little bit and actually writes great music.\n\nThe best work on here is obviously Eternal Darkness. Angry, melancholic, and dissonant, it hits hard at the opening with a lengthy blast beat section, then turns toward a depressive mid-section. Powerful at times, and at others dissolving into chaos, the song also contains an amazing guitar solo that rips the flesh off your skin while also playing around with off-key stylings to keep things interesting.\n\nJari's vocals have never sounded better to me. He screeches and shrieks like a madman. Then he smoothly transitions to super clean lines, or raspy melodies. His clean work on Loneliness is some of the finest of his career. And the track he lays down on Eternal Darkness with Jukka's low register complimenting his main vocal line is suitably freakish to match the music. It's worth noting that this album utilizes Jukka's low growls much better than Time I. Jukka and Jari play off each other, sometimes emphasizing each other's lines, and other times pounding things home in unison. Pretty good stuff. I barely noticed it on Time I, but here it's a net positive for sure.\n\nTurning towards the negative, The Forest Seasons contains precious little technical guitar work when compared to the debut album. Even Time I contained more tasty riffage than this, and I thought it was lacking in that department. I just can't wrap my head around someone spending as much time as Jari does honing his guitar god skills and then simply holding it in his back pocket. I understand that endless noodling gets really boring really fast. I appreciate the restraint shown in Wintersun's last two albums, which tend to emphasize compositions over wankery. But good lord, the man can shred and he can write tight killer riffs with the best of them. To remove that key skillset from the music entirely is a crime. Let's face it, most of us came to the Wintersun table looking for red meat in the form of superior guitar work. Listening to The Forest Seasons is a bit like getting baked chicken breast instead. Juicy baked chicken breast, but chicken breast nonetheless.\n\nEven so, at the end of the day, I've been listening this for a week now and I'm still enjoying it. I'm going to need more of what made Wintersun noteworthy on the next album though. But for right now, The Forest Seasons is a pleasant little diversion.\n",
        "\nI'm not willing to put too much effort into more (justified) trash-talking of Jari's conman behaviors, but there is one thing that I have to point out at the start of this review, concerning the shoddy production job of this very album: \n\nI'm 100% sure that Jari has deliberately fucked it up (especially the rhythm guitars!) because by now, this man should be able to create a decent, tolerable guitar sound even without the gigantic means of a 750.000 Euro studio  at his disposal. He knows how desperately people want to hear blistering, cutting-edge guitar sounds out of his fingers and dialing in such a flat, mushy bedroom-black metal tone is surely one of his main attempts at blackmailing the Wintersun fanbase. \n\nSo what about the album at hand? No, I don't think it absolutely sucks or that The Forest Seasons is the worst thing ever created, but if you were hoping for Time II or something quite like it, you will be disappointed, as the orchestrations, epic soundscapes and the more intricate songwriting have been reduced by quite a margin. If you wanted to get your hands on it because you liked the Wintersun debut so much, you might be disappointed even more, because there's rarely any rapid-fire shredding or melodic lead guitar glory going here. \n\nThe Forest Seasons features soundscapes somewhere in-between these two albums, but without the synthesizer and ambience overkill of the former and sans the youthful fun and blistering drive of the latter. Instead, it tries to shift more towards a black metal influence (mostly prominent in the second, \"colder\" seasons of the album) which is a laudable move in my book, but Jari either lacks experience AND/OR passion for this kind of sound, because he clearly could not master the art of fruitful repetition here. The programmed blast beats (Kai apparently has no drumming credits on the album) in the Autumn section are tiresome and took approx. 5 minutes of mouse clicking \u2013 probably a truly exhausting copy & paste job of two samples out of a standard fare drum software. \n\nThis aching kind of repetition is a general problem that Jari spread across the whole album. As some of my fellow reviewers already pointed out, it feels as if he came up with material for a full 5 minute song and decided to repeat many of these ideas again and again and again just to fill up the empty space, instead of putting more work into it. This is the main reason why The Forest Seasons might work in certain environments where the main focus is put onto something else (workout, cooking, sex) but it surely is not strong enough to be an enthralling stand-alone listening experience like some of their older work (even though that is only truly the case for the Sonic Pump Studio renditions of Time II, since the mix is a lot better than on the actual album \u2013 have your own listen on Youtube)\n\nSince I actually do give Jari some credit as a composer (Death and the Healing is the blueprint for an excellent balladesque midtempo Wintersun song and definitely their only one I consider flawless) there are some exciting moments to be found. The second half of Loneliness contains pretty fine lead guitar interplay, echoing glimpses of earlier grandeur and the chorus of The Forest That Wheeps would be quite epic, if it hadn't been repeated ad nauseam by the time the elevating additional choir appears. The same annoying error appears on the opening track (Spring) as the mushy rhythm guitars (which sound like absolute shit) ride a decent galloping riff underneath a respectable, if overloud vocal performance by Jari. It's staggering that such a neat riff is - once again - ridden into oblivion.\n\nRegardless of your opinion on Jari M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4's agitated antics, The Forest Seasons is an album clearly intended to be a fill-in between two proper releases, designed to be a quick fix (talking about Jari standards) for Wintersun's rabid fans, trading in mediocre results for rapid money transfers. \n\nNow go ahead and throw your hard-earned money at him, will ya?\n",
        "\nI'd like to clear something up right away - under no circumstances should you buy this album new. Even if it was a good album I'd be saying to pick it up used or pirate it, because by buying it directly from the label you are supporting the petulant, entitled manchild Jari M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4 and all of his ridiculous antics. Buying this new means you are saying that the very notion of releasing an album purely out of spite because you couldn't have your own studio built for you, or releasing half of an album after 8 years, or refusing to release the music you promised until a studio is funded by your fans is somehow acceptable. \n\nBringing up non-musical matters in this case is not only absolutely fair but also completely logical, necessary and above all, honest. To 'focus on the music only' is flagrantly disingenuous, as this album exists entirely because of Jari's unbelievable sense of entitlement. He had no intention of recording this originally, but made it only so he could fund the construction of his own studio. Make no mistake people, this album is a stopgap released only so Jari could make more money to fuel his delusions. It is a piece of commercial fodder, and examining its musical contents reveals just how lazy and effortless it really is.\n\nThis album is in a similar style to his last album, that being fairly standard melodic death/power metal with a lighter but still prominent usage of synthesised orchestrations and an attempt at an epic atmosphere. This in theory is a good blend but it simply never comes together whenever Jari has a stab at it, because he never sticks to what he's good at: high tempo short songs loaded with excellent hyper-melodic riffing, blasting drums and incredible guitar soloing with an optional usage of keyboards as a background instrument. He can't pull off anything lengthy, slow or atmospheric because he can't write good riffs in a slower, more grandiose style or compose keyboard parts that are interesting enough to be the focus of the music, and these songs are no exception.\n\nEvery song plods along with below average and sluggish riffs that are totally boring and unmemorable, with similarly bland drumming. The attempt at a darker and more stripped sound here means virtually no good soloing, removing the only saving grace of his weaker material. This also means that Jari's substandard riffing has taken centre stage, compounding the issue of dull music by making its core completely unengaging. To make matters worse, while the keyboards are dialed back to a tolerable level they're never used to great effect, with very few notable melodies or effective attempts to accent the music, instead chiming along with no consequence. The vocals aren't up to the task either, as he sounds very bored when singing or growling. Even the worst of the last two albums had a better vocal performance from him, and it is a suitably boring performance for such boring and empty music.\n\nIn spite of the totally boring performances what kills this album is the approach to the songwriting. Given the mess that was Time I it is safe to say that Jari believes in the principle of 'more = better'. This seems to be the only way he can work a climax into a song, because to do so he'll just throw in some choirs and have more keys chiming. There's no actual dynamics here, at least not in the sense of building and releasing tension through appropriate usage of instruments. He just increases the volume of all the bells and whistles, and it doesn't work at all, as the music feels flat and dead whether it is loud or quiet. It's a completely artificial approach that demonstrates why more layers and gloss can't make up for good songwriting and atmosphere. There in fact is no atmosphere as a result of all the instrumental and structural deficiencies. The songs don't even feel evocative of the seasons they represent, which is simply laughable.\n\nAnother issue is that the songs are *far* too long - each song could have each section cut in half and the effect would be the same. To compound this issue, riffs are repeated too much and not varied enough and songs ultimately go nowhere by the time they finally end, because they don't conclude in a resounding or interesting way. However, the worst part is that it sounds as if each section of any song is just there so it ticks off a checklist. This is down to the fact that Jari can't actually write long songs, because when he does he throws any idea he can think of into a song without making it all flow properly or fleshing each idea out, and the end result are songs that feel like a collection of unrelated ideas. There's no rhyme or reason for a quiet bit or a choral part to be in the songs at all, other than because songs usually have them. Nothing really stitches them together, it all feels bizarrely disjointed and makes the songs tedious to listen to as they arbitrarily run through a set of tropes.\n\nIronically this album benefits greatly from not being recorded in a world class studio, because unlike Time I this isn't completely drenched in overdone keyboards and the music doesn't sound anywhere near as processed, digital and hollow. Instead it sports a typical modern sound, with slightly clicky drums and a fat and crunchy guitar tone. While the production means that the music doesn't jump out at the listener at all, by the same token it isn't obnoxiously noisy and actually has a relative sense of dynamics, which in turn makes it a little easier to take in. It must be stressed that this is all relative however - this is still a chore to sit through on account of the boring music as well as the abysmal song structuring. The album still has no dynamics in terms of mood or tension, only in terms of pure volume and layers. \n\nI think Jari has his priorities all wrong. Given the decent production achieved on this album a new studio isn't needed. Instead, Jari should use the money he extorted to hire some session musicians who can actually write some good music, because he clearly can't anymore. It's either that or he really didn't try with this album because as mentioned previously it exists only so Jari can take more money to release music he should have released 5 years ago, and that is perhaps the most revolting thing about this album. It is one thing to make an album that is a cashgrab, but it's quite another to make a cashgrab album that sounds like a cashgrab. It's completely dull and effortless music by a spiteful, bitter man. Hopefully after this dreck and the entire crowdfunding fiasco we can forget about this idiot forever. What a colossal waste of time this album is - avoid.\n",
        "\nIt is easy to be swept up in the polarity of opinions that have arisen through the antics of Jari and his crowdfunding campaign. For some, donating a large sum to a band they love does not seem excessive. To others, Jari\u2019s crowdfunding is a literal scam. Personally speaking, the subjectivity of music needs to be taken into consideration before rushing to judgement from either side. There are individuals that would never pay that much money for digital files for even their most beloved artists. Then there are others that would do anything to support an artist that they have grown to appreciate the most. Ultimately, no matter what you decide to feel about Jari\u2019s long periods of time between music releases (and yes, I will admit, his rather melodramatic monologues), two things need to be taken into consideration. \n\nFirst, Jari put Wintersun out there asking for donations just as many other bands do since the rise in popularity of crowdfunding. If you want to create an argument for or against crowdfunding as an industry, that is a valid and important debate. However, that leads to the second factor here \u2013 the debate on Jari\u2019s choice of crowdfunding needs to be separated from the album as a musical piece. I have read many reviews over the past two days that spend many words critiquing Jari\u2019s choices prior to release, then ends with, \u201coh, right, and the music is poor.\u201d I would be interested to read a review that is solely on the music, and I am going to presume others may feel the same, thus I will write a review of\u2026not Jari\u2026but of Wintersun\u2019s third studio album, \u201cThe Forest Seasons.\u201d\n\nI am rather impressed with the presentation of the album visually. The art is well done, with each rendition of a season artistically matching the tone of said song. Thus, I think it is important that anyone listening to the album at least try to find the photograph that shows each of the band members representing a season while listening to the corresponding song. I think it may help someone visualize what Wintersun was trying to portray, rather than trying to comprehend it with the music alone at first.\n\nSong placement is on point. Although it is true that the probability of this being successful may seem easier when there are less songs, the important aspect here is that change was necessary to fit the concept. If the bigger picture is not enjoyable to someone, that is understandable. However, Wintersun delivered on what they wanted. Spring felt like it \u201cawakened from a dark slumber,\u201d and winter felt cold and \u201clonely.\u201d\n\nSpring \u2013 \u201cAwaken from the Dark Slumber\u201d has the fast-paced melodic death metal tempo of Wintersun from many years ago. Considering the symphonic direction of Time I, I was not expecting to hear glimpses of old at all. Although not the most technically advanced song of all time, Jari\u2019s vocals keep the song exciting and upbeat. Summer \u2013 \u201cThe Forest That Weeps\u201d sadly brings the album down to low expectation. One of the most consistent aspects of reviews of the album is that guitar work is lacking, especially solos, and it is apparent in this song. Autumn \u2013 \u201cEternal Darkness\u201d is by far my favorite song on the album (however, considering it is one of the most unique/dark songs style wise for Wintersun, it makes sense that others may choose another song over Autumn). From the dark, ambient sound of the opening seconds, to the guitars being turned way down to create what I dare say a black metal atmosphere, the direction of Autumn is lovely. The layering of vocals as Jari screams, \u201cI am the immortal shadow, the ruler of dark dimensions\u2026,\u201d sent shivers down my spine. Winter \u2013 \u201cLoneliness\u201d sounds as if it was taken directly off of Time I. The dramatic vocal style may be a turn off to some, but it does go with the notion of a lonely, cold winter.\n\nAs a whole, \u201cThe Forest Seasons\u201d has glimpses of Wintersun of old, although not the most technically advanced album of the band. I believe this may have been done on purpose, however, even if not well received by some. The four seasons perspective was spot on. When not tainted by the polar opinions of Jari, this album is a decent piece of musical content.\n",
        "\nSo, I knew this would happen. I knew \"The Forest Seasons\", the newest offering from Jari M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4's band Wintersun, would garner a fair amount of negative criticism. Call me a fanboy, but I think this album was definitely worth the five-year wait since \"Time I\" came out back in 2012. I was, like most other Wintersun fans, really hoping we would get \"Time II\" instead but when I read earlier this year that \"The Forest Seasons\" was gonna be released this summer, I was still rendered extremely excited. Yesterday, I went and bought a vinyl copy of this album from my local record store, and I have been listening to it quite a bit this morning. I am on my second listen all the way through currently and while some folks may find this album a bit hard to digest, it speaks to me so naturally. This album surpasses \"Time I\" and unfortunately doesn't live up to the self-titled album from 13 years ago, but really, at this point, that would take a miracle for Jari to do. \n\nSo, this album was the result of the band's crowdfunding campaign (which raised \u20ac464,330) to help the band basically build a \"Wintersun headquarters\" because they couldn't mix \"Time II\" the way they wanted with their current set up. While I think that is a bit ridiculous, honestly, this album seems like it came out extremely well. I am still really hoping \"Time II\" comes out within the next 40 years but hey, I guess that will remain to be seen and I won't believe a thing until I have a physical copy in my hands.\n\n\"The Forest Seasons\" is divided into four songs that each represent a season. In terms of length, these songs range from lengths of 12 to a bit over 14 minutes. I've seen a lot of people complain about this but four-track albums with long songs isn't really an uncommon concept. See works such as Burzum's \"Hvis Lyset Tar Oss\", Drudkh's \"Forgotten Legends\", MOST of Wolves in the Throne Room's discography, Altar of Plagues' \"White Tombs\", etc etc... You get the idea. This formula also works fairly well for Winersun. \"Awaken from the Dark Slumber\" represents spring, \"The Forest That Weeps\" represents summer, \"Eternal Darkness\" represents autumn, and of course Loneliness\" represents winter. These songs also capture the atmosphere of all the seasons in sound form and they manage to capture exactly what the voices of these seasons would sound like if they could be heard. \"Awaken from the Dark Slumber\" is perhaps the most upbeat song here while \"Loneliness\" counteracts as the most somber and melancholic tune. The production value of this album is also extremely high. I've heard a lot of people talking about how this album's production was made to be extremely high quality at the expense of the songwriting but I really don't see that. I mean, I have a few tiny gripes about the album's songwriting, but they're fairly small and the production makes these well-written songs just sound that much better. I think the guitars sound somewhat flat at times, and for Wintersun, that's a bit of a shocker. Wintersun began as a guitar-driven band and Jari remains one of my favorite metal guitarists of all time, but since \"Time I\", it seems he has been more focused on the orchestrations and synths than guitars. Regardless, they more audible this time around and sound fairly strong if a tad flat. I noticed the first two tracks do not contain guitar solos and I instantly thought this would be another \"Time I\" where we would be lucky to get one solo. However, the second two tracks both contain solos, with \"Eternal Darkness\" containing the best of them. It is a minute-long guitar solo that showcases Jari's musical genius. Speaking of which, this track is my favorite of the four. Autumn is my favorite season and it's really cool how this has become my favorite song here. It starts off with a huge black metal influence in the blast beats, and evil-ish sounding riffs. Jari's death growls also are prominent in this song and are somewhat of a newer concept for this band. \n\n\"Awaken from the Dark Slumber\" is probably my least favorite track, and it's unfortunate that it was the one to kick the record off. It's not bad, at all. Actually, it's still a fairly well-done piece of music. My main issue is this one riff that while it sounds good, is repeated way too many times and isn't broken up with what could have been a welcome solo. There is a guitar lead in there but it never evolves into a real solo. Thankfully, it doesn't really drag and even the repetition really has more of a trance-like effect than anything. It's just not something one really expects from Wintersun. \n\nThese songs all have slower passages that can be complimented with acoustic guitar parts, such as the gorgeous intro to \"The Forest That Weeps\" which stands out quite a bit, but \"Loneliness\" really shows this. It gives off a very cold personification of Finland's cold and dark winters, similar to what \"Land of Snow and Sorrow\" from the last album was able to do. This song shows a bit of a depressive black metal influence in the intro before Jari comes in with a somber clean vocal performance. While this album overall does exhibit more of an epic melodic death metal style with some black metal influences thrown in, the folk metal side of Wintersun does pop its head in occasionally. This stands out in their discography as possibly the \"strangest\" album but not in a bad way. I noticed \n\nSo, what else can I say? \"The Forest Seasons\" is a solid album from Jari played and recorded all of the instruments on this album by himself. That's right, everything from the guitar, bass, synths, orchestrations, and drums which actually were programmed using a drum machine. This is similar to how Jari recorded the first Wintersun album, except Kai Hahto was present and recorded the drums himself using real drums. The drums here don't sound bad for being programmed and they don't really sound fake, but they also don't sound as good as they would if they were organic drums. It's a bit unfortunate but cool to see how Jari was able to implement the drum machine and make it sound effective. It's also cool to see how he still credited each member of the band in the album by assigning them all to a specific season, but if you actually read the credits, you'll pretty much just see \"Jari M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4\" everywhere. I'd like to see every member of this band working together on \"Time II\" (or whatever the next album may be) because I feel Wintersun has evolved into more than just a Jari M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4 solo project. Aside from the few gripes I've had with this album, this is their second finest recording to date, and I can't wait until their next album in 50 years! Haha. All jokes aside, thanks Wintersun for giving us this album. Keep it up!\n",
        "\nWintersun is somewhat of an institution these days, a band that has generated both hype and extreme hate, and both solely on how long it takes for main composer (I hate that I actually used this word for him) Jari Maenpaa to release albums. And not only that \u2013 but also simply how egregiously he whines and bitches throughout about how everything is against him and he can't make the music he really wants. Let me play the world's smallest violin!\n\nThrough this long lengths of time and manufactured self importance, he's sort of created a makeshift legend around himself, one which is not really deserved... and after all the fanfare and kickstarter fundraisers, we now have The Forest Seasons. How good is this album, knowing that it only exists so Jari can fund some studio to write the music he REALLY wants to write? It's about as good as any pointless placeholder ever was, I guess.\n\nThis is the worst kind of gimmicky garbage in metal these days... it's the oversaturated, over-self-important kind of tripe that thinks more layers is more quality and an abundance of folk and classical influences, however hamfisted, means intelligent and eclectic writing. It's just flat out sucky ass songwriting. There is zero economy or subtlety to this \u2013 everything just sort of hangs out like the guts on a disemboweled Walking Dead zombie, all the sympho-fanfares and trilling melodies and yowling harsh vocals anyone could want, but with no real sense in how these things are arranged.\n\nThese are very long songs, but only by virtue of the gratuitous way Maenpaa just shoves all these disparate parts together like pieces in an assembly line. Here's a quiet atmospheric intro part, then here's a blasting loud part, then here's a choir-laced section for no real reason at all, all of these things arranged like Lego blocks, perfunctory and arbitrary in their placement in the songs. There are no good hooks, no atmosphere built up through the repetition, no climactic focus at the end. Rather, every song just seems to be a potpourri of clich\u00e9 epic sounds put together with the finesse of a drunken Jenga game.\n\nIt's a commonly dished-out critique of some longer metal albums that they could be cut down by a lot, but I've never seen that as plainly as with The Forest Seasons - the length and grandiosty of these songs is a manufactured thing, solely padded out by how pointlessly and laboriously each song's parts are arranged one after another. If the writing had any economy or sense to it, these songs would each be half as long as they are. They still wouldn't be good. This is plainly, nakedly bad music to its core. It's music that exists on a motif of 'more STUFF HAPPENING = better songs,' and treats production values as the chief point around which everything else is hinged \u2013 why else would he put so much focus, for years on end, about how he can't make the music he REALLY wants to write without some big expensive studio priced in the hundreds of thousands? If the content of these songs was ever the focus rather than the production value, he's doing a great job hiding that fact. It seems his priorities are different.\n\nAnd that does bring me to the Elephant in the Room... this goddamn fundraiser circus and the idea that he can't complete his much-ballyhooed Time II without a huge studio all his fans should pay for if they REALLY support him. Apparently, he has enough material for multiple albums ready and written, but can't release them without this studio, and so he just kind of held it all hostage for years, like some mental abuser, telling his fans that if they really love him they'll throw bushels of money his way. Apparently, he could not release anything at all without some godlike, tricked out studio that would make most mainstream hip hop artists blush and go 'why do we need this much?'\n\nSome may call this perfectionism; I call it douchebaggery. Does he know how many bands put out albums on budgets nowhere even close to his? I get it, sometimes crowdfunding is necessary \u2013 but the simpering, dishonest con-man money-grubbing crap Maenpaa has been pulling is gross and offensive to any real artists who care about what they do and care about their fans. His constant excuses and the undercurrent attitude that he couldn't complete his work without bleeding his fans for hundreds of thousands of dollars is just completely antithetical to what art should be. Not to say any artist should work for free \u2013 but that if it becomes this much about the money, to the point that you flat out refuse to make anything at all and just coast on some make-believe hype, you are not being honest any longer.\n\nThe Forest Seasons is a bad album musically, and rendered almost completely pointless since it only exists so he could make money to use for other shit. And Jari is a pure artistic fraud. Fucking con man bullshit artist piece of shit. I hate everything about this.\n",
        "\nThere seems to have been a trend of hating on Wintersun that has developed over the years; it's most likely due to Jari's near pathological and compulsive perfectionism, which has lead to a series of high profile shenanigans and repeated delays with the whole \"Time I & II\" business, as well as the \"Wintersun HQ\" drama (full disclosure; I totally pitched in on that crowd funding thing...)\n\nSo where does that leave us with \"The Forest Seasons\", which is something that appeared surrounded by contradictions and drama? Completely ignoring all the nonsense surrounding Jari's compulsive need to set himself unrealistic goals, this is a good album; it's actually a fucking great album. It's different to previous Wintersun, but it's good nonetheless. Is it anything like their debut? Not really. Is it like \"Time I\"? Again, not really, aside from in terms of song length. However, it is still a great, solid album that is enjoyable to listen to. \n\nIf you go into this album expecting it to be this insane, delirious, almost religious hallucination/vision that rabid elitists have built \"Time II\" up to be, then you will be disappointed; not due to lack of delivery, but because when you reach that level of ridiculous reverence, then you will always be underwhelmed, likely in a similar fashion to Jari with every musical endeavor the man engages in. If however, you go into this with an open mind (I can already hear the elitists shrieking and writhing in fury/agony) then what you'll find is an album that offers many high points. \n\nThe riffs are what you'd expect from Wintersun; the trademark folk/power/viking/prog/epic/black metal song writing that we've all grown familiar with over the years; be it the fast paced, almost galloping licks on \"Awake from the Dark Slumber (Spring)\", the mid paced \" The Forest that Weeps (Summer)\" or the slower, pounding rhythms of \"Eternal Darkness (Autumn)\" and \"Loneliness (Winter)\", the traditional guitar work remains. There is a noticeable lack of blast beats throughout the album, although when they are present they are as good as ever and in keeping with the song, and it's even refreshing to see some more simplistic beats/drumming present (BLASPHEMY!!!) Keyboards are rife through the whole album, and are at times slightly overwhelming, although not to a degree that I found I couldn't enjoy it; they are still able to provide the classic sense of Nordic spacey epicness that is synonymous with Wintersun. \n\nThe only real criticisms I have are that (as mentioned) the sheer level of keyboardery can at times be overwhelming; it appears that Jari's approach to keyboards is \"if a little is good, then a lot must be better!\" although this for me was a very minor issue and was balanced out nicely by the overall vibe provided by the synths. My only other criticism is that there are only 4 songs (long songs, but 4 nonetheless) although in spite of their length, it never felt like a chore to finish it. \n\nOverall: It's a great album, if you allow yourself to accept that it's a great album rather than holding on to the deluded and unrealistic ideal that some fans/elitists have built up in their minds over the years of what any new work from Wintersun SHOULD be based solely on how long it has taken \"Time II\" to happen. Forget the drama, forget the shenanigans, forget the delays, forget the politics and just listen to the music, and I'm pretty sure you'll have a good time.\n",
        "\n... To hire a search team to go into Jari's ass and retrieve his head. \n\nCan you believe it has been 13 years since the last proper Wintersun album? Don't give me that \"But Time I\" bullshit, that was an EP and you know it. And so was Twilight Force's \"Tales Of Ancient Prophecies\" while I'm at it! But anyway, 13 years later, and a lot of drama has happened in the Wintersun camp. Ponzi scheme crowdfunding campaigns, \"he said, she said\" back and forths between Jari and Nuclear Blast, broken promises about Time II, but finally, after much delay, we have The Forest Seasons, changed from it's previous title of \"Not Time II.\" \n\nSomething about this album's conceptualization bugged me from the beginning, so forgive me if I seem to be a little biased here, but the idea of The Forest Seasons came off as \"just an album\" to use as a product for a hefty crowdfunding campaign so the band can create their own elaborate studio and fully realize the ideas they want to use for Time II, like their heart wasn't really there for this one because they couldn't add 30 layers of keyboard koto samples with the studio they have now. They worded it differently in press releases, something more along the lines of this being \"an album written with our current means of recording in mind,\" but they can't bullshit me. \n\nOddly enough though, in restricting themselves, Wintersun have created a more cohesive listening experience here on The Forest Seasons with more breathing room for your ears than the chaotic, keyboard-laden mess of Time I. Does that make it good? Oh God no, this album is a bore to sit through. But I'd be lying if I said I wasn't interested in what would happen if Wintersun continued with this direction rather than the pompous, bloated bullshit that will likely be passed between the two passages of \"Time.\" (cheeky....) With only four songs, one to reflect each season, one would think that time would be dedicated to make each song stand out with lots of ear-catching moments and not have them feel overlong. \n\nOr they could start off the album with an owl hooting for a minute straight among \"atmospheric\" nonsense. Man, I wish I was joking... Once \"Awaken From The Dark Slumber\" starts proper, a few things jump out at me. For one, Jari's harsh vocals sound really phoned in. They sound less like they're conveying the brutality of the elements and Mother Nature like they did in the olden days and sound more like a guy who's exaggerating stepping on a LEGO block. These songs also have no build-up or even really any hooks, save for the occasional choir which comes out of nowhere and adds nothing. Nor do they really capture the essence of the seasons being covered. In fact, the first two songs are pretty interchangable, resulting in almost a half hour of pure Wintersun on cruise control.\n\nBut things finally pick up with \"Eternal Darkness\" (a nod to the awesome Gamecube game? I can dream) which is a fucking 14-minute long Danny Elfman-inspired slab of symphonic black metal goodness. Nothing in this song is better than anything on the new Cradle of Filth (ehhh maybe the vocals), but on this snoozer of an album, it's a welcome detour into the macabre. It plays out like a less goofy version of Nightwish's \"Scaretale,\" and I actually like that song (screw the haters) so that makes \"Eternal Darkness\" a winner in my book. Easily the best song on the album despite also not quite building up to anything, but at least it holds up a wicked blast beat tempo for 3/4 of the song. \n\nBut then the winter song, \"Loneliness,\" snaps me back to the reality where Wintersun just isn't a good band anymore. This one is just a complete slog to listen to, sounding like a rejected version of \"Land Of Snow And Sorrow\" from Time I. Again, there's no build-up or anything so the song maintains this drudging pace for its entire 13-MINUTE RUNNING TIME. Come on, Jari, winter is your thing! This didn't have to be so boring! \n\nIf there was more material on here like \"Eternal Darkness,\" this album could easily be an AOTY contender. But as it stands, The Forest Seasons is two small steps forward and one giant step back, with overly long songs filled with not enough interesting stuff to warrant their lengths. And it's not that I need more time to soak in everything, they're just boring fucking songs. At this point, I'm convinced that Wintersun's self-titled was a complete fluke, or Jari's head is so far up his ass that he thinks everything he shits out is gold. 13 years and only one good album to your name? C'mon man, you think you deserve a $750,000 studio for ONE good album? You can piss right off, wanker.\n",
        "\nI mean, we all knew this was coming. I had to review this, screeching about Jari Maenpaa is pretty much my entire claim to fame at this point. So yeah, this is being written purely out of obligation, because I don't want to. Not because I have to eat crow over guaranteeing this would suck and I wound up wrong or something, because this does suck. It's just sucky in a slightly different way than usual.\n\nY'see, The Forest Seasons is, to put it lightly, boring as shit. There are a few neat things about it, and like always, Jari is at his best when he's just throwing caution to the wind and being as huge and grandiose as he possibly can, but the problem is that there are startlingly few moments like that to be found here. Don't get me wrong, this album is big, but it's not really exciting in any way. That's really the album's biggest flaw, there's just... very little here. The few good tracks they've put out over the agonizingly long years (\"Beyond the Dark Sun\", \"Winter Madness\", \"Sons of Winter and Stars\") all have a few things in common. They're all blisteringly fast, massively bombastic, loaded with either flashy guitar theatrics (\"Beyond the Dark Sun\"), over the top orchestrations (\"Sons of Winter and Stars\"), or both (\"Winter Madness\"). All the shitty songs (every other song Jari has touched since leaving Ensiferum) are plodding and dull and go nowhere. Full of sound and fury, signifying nothing, ya know? There are no good songs on The Forest Seasons. They're all the latter type of song that seems to just fucking drag on and on and on and never actually go anywhere or do anything exciting.\n\nI've always said the reason Wintersun is so frustrating is because Jari is seemingly incapable of writing to his strengths. He's really good at super fast and super melodic magniloquence. Similar to how Dio only works when there's some semblance of mysticism behind him, Jari only works when he's powering forwards with pomp and energy. What he's not good at is atmosphere. He simply has not managed to write a song throughout the two decades he's been in the spotlight that built itself on sounding like it was greater than itself. He tries to throw hundreds of layers of strings and keys and horns and anything else he can think of but none of it ever amounts to anything. Wintersun is deceptively shallow, and this album sort of lays it all bare for the listener to realize. Beyond all that flash and guitar wizardry, there's very little solid songwriting. \"The Forest that Weeps\" is a great example, as it's sort of a metaphor for the entire album. It boasts a choir section that features some heavy hitters like Heri Joenson, Markus Toivonen, and Mitja Harvilahti, but when you look at the rest of who is featured you see it's filled with nobodies like some random dudes who played in Norther, the bassist of Ensiferum who left around the time Jari did, and pretty much every single member of Turisas. That's The Forest Seasons and pretty much Wintersun's entire career in a nutshell. A couple great moments surrounded by a veritable horde of \"who the fuck cares?\" \n\nThere are good moments scattered around. I genuinely think the final two and a half minutes or so of \"Awaken from the Dark Slumber\" are great, and there's a fast section around four and a half minutes into \"Eternal Darkness\" that is pretty sweet, but that's like four minutes out of 54. That choir in \"The Forest that Weeps\" sings a really bland stanza that sounds like it doesn't fit into the song at all, and it's no better when Jari sings it solo. And rounding out the group is the token quasi-ballad, \"Loneliness\", that just drags the fuck on and on and progresses precisely zero inches from the starting line by the end. 90% of the album is mid paced and droning, even when the drums are blasting. I'll give the dude some props for stepping outside of his comfort zone and trying something new, but it didn't connect at all.\n\nJari is a bullshit artist of the highest order, but one thing he absolutely did not lie about was that this is a much more \"earthy\" and subdued album than the two preceding it. There's a surprising amount of meloblack influence (particularly in \"Eternal Darkness\") and it's much more guitar based than the booming symphonics we've grown to expect. And in theory, the idea of Wintersun ditching the overblown symphony is a really cool prospect, because \"Beyond the Dark Sun\" rules fucking divine and it's all about the guitars on that one. The thing is that the opener from the self titled is super kinetic and succinct. It had a point to make and so it made it quickly and effectively. Nothing on The Forest Seasons is done quickly or effectively. Everything is dragged on to marathon lengths, as all four tracks fall between 12 and 15 minutes, and it's just a chore to sit through attentively because it just sounds like he's throwing a surprisingly thin amount of ideas at you and just trying to impress you with the sheer amount of it. It's so odd, it's like the band is simultaneously doing too much and too little at the same time. It's darker than before, yes. It's heavier than before, yes. It's better than before? No.\n\nI genuinely can't decide if this is the best or worst Wintersun album, because it comes off as both. On one hand, the darker approach is a welcome change, as it sounds more sad and hopeless than the puffed up nonsense of their usual fare. On the other hand, it's pretty much boring the entire way through with no random highlights like \"Winter Madness\" to make the album worth coming back to. But in that respect, it means it's easily the most consistent album they've written to date, but that also means it's just consistently boring. What's more frustrating? An album full of lame songs with one or two great ones that end up being tragically miscast on an otherwise dull album, or an album that's consistently bland the entire way through and ending up pointless overall? I guess \"Eternal Darkness\" is alright but it's pretty much just a bizarro version of \"Battle Against Time\", with its endless blastbeats and tremolo picking, played twice in a row. It's almost commendable to cram so much content into four songs and yet make all of it so inconsequential and unmemorable. That was always Wintersun's problem, but they'd usually fluke out and nail it at least once per album. Not this time, this one whiffs pretty much the entire time.\n\nI'd say it's a shame, but not really. Wintersun continues to be this weird bastard hybrid of Nickelback and K-pop. Nickelback because they're not necessarily offensively bad, just really, unbelievably, excessively lame, and K-pop because it all sorta sounds the same and follows an obvious template with very few tricks, but fans are absolutely fucking wild in their unending devotion to mediocrity. \n\nWhatever, Wintersun exhausts me nowadays. This is what happens when all of your efforts goes towards production values (which are great, by the way) at the expense of songwriting.\n\n\nOriginally written for Lair of the Bastard\n",
        "\nAfter many years of waiting, Wintersun finally released \u201cTime\u201d in 2012. Well, actually, not really. Wintersun released \u201cTime I\u201d in 2012 and currently, we have yet to receive \u201cTime II\u201d. Come on, Jari. It\u2019s April 2016. By the looks of it, we probably won\u2019t get the latest installation of this album until 2020! But I won\u2019t hold my breath on that one. All gripes aside, I was extremely excited when this album finally dropped in October of 2012. I had gotten into Wintersun my freshman year of high school, and this came out during my senior year. That\u2019s only three years of listening to this band but even I was feeling the pain many of this band\u2019s longtime fans were feeling. I craved a new album. The day this album came out, I went down to FYE and picked a copy up for myself. Right away, I opened up the CD and put it into my car. Was I satisfied? Were my expectations met? I will now discuss the highly anticipated \u201cTime I\u201d from the Finnish legends Wintersun.\n\nI recall Jari saying he was experimenting with Japanese-style melodies and was planning on incorporating some on the album. Judging by the artwork, this had definitely happened. The introductory track to this album, \u201cWhen Time Fades Away\u201d, is a 4-minute instrumental piece. Basically, it is a folk interlude that really works with Japanese-style melodies and sounds almost like medieval Asian folk music. It\u2019s very atmospheric and quite ambient. There is another track titled \u201cDarkness and Frost\u201d that reaches 2 and a half minutes in length and pretty much follows a similar musical and formulaic idea. These short numbers surely are beautiful but when there are only five songs on the album, they seem to overstay their welcome a bit. The three main body tracks are \u201cSons of Winter and Stars\u201d, \u201cLand of Snow and Sorrow\u201d, and the title track \u201cTime\u201d. Clocking in at 40 minutes, it pretty much has an average runtime but still feels incomplete and I feel more could have been done during the extremely long wait for this album.\n\nAlthough the album feels like it could have offered a bit more, the music is still superb. It\u2019s not on the same level with the self-titled album from 2004, but it still has that cold atmosphere we have come to expect and the production this time around is even more huge and epic. Some may even say this is an overproduced effort but I feel it sounds wonderful. The music is not as technical this time around and in all actuality, far less guitar oriented. The guitar riffs are still there and heard quite clearly but they really give the epic orchestrations more room to breathe. My favorite song on this album is \u201cLand of Snow and Sorrow\u201d. The guitar riff is breathtakingly melodic and beautiful and the huge orchestrations provide a wall of sound that house these riffs. However, something definitely feels different about this song: where is the solo? Actually, there is only one guitar solo on the entire album, appearing in the title track. This isn\u2019t a big issue for me because I know very well that guitar solos are not needed to make a song sound good. In Wintersun\u2019s case, though, you pretty much expect to hear at least one per song. \u201cLand of Snow and Sorrow\u201d features a very sad tone and more of a depressing atmosphere. Actually, it is probably the saddest song on the album. \u201cSons of Winter and Stars\u201d is pretty much the opposite with a lighter tone and a more uplifting, positive sounding atmosphere. It\u2019s a good song as well, but doesn\u2019t have the same musical effectiveness as \u201cLand of Snow and Sorrow\u201d and, as I said earlier, this song also lacks a guitar solo, and for me, this song definitely could use one. \n\nNow, as I said earlier, the title track is the only one that contains a solo. It\u2019s a decent solo but pales in comparison to any of the solos we heard on the previous album. This song also contains a progressive atmosphere to it that the other two metal tracks don\u2019t really have. As for that aforementioned Japanese influence, this song seems to possess that as well, especially towards its end. While I love this song and how epic it is, I can\u2019t help but feel it just sounds\u2026incomplete. It\u2019s a great song but it feels like it\u2019s missing something and could be so much better.\n\nJari\u2019s vocals on this album are what we have come to expect from him with his time he spent as Ensiferum\u2019s front man as well as the last Wintersun album. Here, like on the last album, he alternates between harsh, screaming vocals and soaring clean singing. \u201cLand of Snow and Sorrow\u201d contains both styles of vocals but his cleans on this song are just otherworldly. His Finnish accent only enhances his singing here. The chorus of this song is one of the most memorable I have ever heard and will ring in your head excessively. Aside from the orchestrations, Jari\u2019s vocals have to be my favorite aspect of \u201cTime I\u201d. I never thought I\u2019d say the vocals and symphonic elements outdo the guitar on a Wintersun album but here, that is exactly the case.\n\nI realize a lot of people absolutely hate this album but there are definitely those who love it as well. I\u2019d say I like it quite a bit but like I said, with only five tracks, two of which being interludes, and 40 minutes, it seems to be lacking and incomplete. \u201cTime II\u201d will hopefully contain some awesome stuff because I feel a lot was left out on this album. It\u2019s huge, sure, but it should be so much bigger. Still, this is a solid release from one of the most important bands of all time.\n",
        "\nYou know those bands and or albums we get that are both considered legendary, timeless classics, but also seem to have a vast sea of people who dismiss them as nothing more than overrated, average crap. Wintersun is one of those bands, and this self-titled debut is certainly one of those albums. Released in 2004, \"Wintersun\" forever changed the metal genre. This album has garnered quite the reputation and thankfully, much of the reception this album has received is positive. This band was conceived while Jari M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4 was still the frontman for Ensiferum but he left due to conflicts arising from his busy schedule trying to juggle both Wintersun and Ensiferum as full-time touring bands. Of course, Petri Lindroos formally from Norther took over Ensiferum, and Jari stuck with Wintersun and remains the driving force behind this band today. This has to be one of the greatest metal albums ever to be created. It is one of the most epic sounding albums for sure, and the atmosphere it possesses remains unmatched by many bands that would follow. I am aware this album already has a prolific amount of reviews but I feel I compelled to give my thoughts on this masterpiece. \n\nHow accurately does this band's name describe the music they created on this album? Quite honestly, absolutely perfectly. The music here is freezing cold, but well-produced and very atmospheric. The album artwork depicts a warrior fallen in the snow, obviously dead. When you listen to the music here and gaze upon the artwork, it really does feel quite real. I recall the first time I listened to this album. I was in my freshman year of high school and one night, I was playing Age of Empires II while listening to some metal. I had my iTunes open on my laptop at the same time. I had actually gotten this album not too long ago at that point and just hadn't really chosen to listen to it, for literally no reason whatsoever. My music was on shuffle as back then I didn't have that large of a collection. \"Death and the Healing\" eventually came on. I was blown away by the beauty and melody I was hearing and quickly went to see what band it was. Upon finding out it was Wintersun, I immediately took my music off shuffle and commenced listening to the album from front to back. I was astounded by what I was hearing. \"Beyond the Dark Sun\" opens the album up and is probably the most aggressive song here. It's also the shortest and only 2 and a half minutes long. The songs range from that to 10 minutes with the epic closer \"Sadness and Hate\". One thing most people fail to note is how the songs increase in length with each track as the album goes on. This doesn't do anything for the actual sound of the music but it kind of give that album an \"epic\" feeling.\n\nSo yes, my encounter with this band was more or less fateful. Wintersun became my favorite band for years and this album remained my favorite album ever recorded as well, until I heard \"Colors\" by Between the Buried and Me. Even so, this album still remains one of my favorites even if it no longer holds the #1 spot, and is still legendary beyond belief. Jari is one of my favorite guitarists ever. His melodies and riffs are instantly recognizable and are the most important aspect of the album. It's quite obvious this is a guitar-driven release. Aside from \"Beyond the Dark Sun\", \"Winter Madness\" is perhaps the album's anthem or fan favorite. These songs are two of the faster tracks on the album, and \"Battle Against Time\" sets things off at a similar pace. For me, however, this album is at its best when the songs focus more on atmosphere and a slower pace, not to say the faster parts aren't atmospheric themselves; this entire album is extremely atmospheric throughout its duration. As I mentioned earlier in this review, \"Death and the Healing\" was my first song from Wintersun. This song to this day, years and years later, remains my favorite of the 8 songs. This song totals around 7 minutes in length and doesn't really change pace too much. This song contains no fast parts and remains mid-paced throughout its length. The riffs in the intro are some of the coldest I have ever heard and the orchestrations in the background only enhance the vividity of this song. There are also no harsh vocals in this song, allowing Jari to utilize his gorgeous Finnish singing voice. While the riffs are breathtaking, the proggy solo in this song is one of my favorites out of them all. It's also quite lengthy and manages to sound effective and technical without sounding like generic guitar wankery. \"Sadness and Hate\" is the other song on this album that pretty much maintains a slower pace but it's a bit harsher, with harsh vocals and an overall heavier sound. These songs do both emit an obvious progressive metal influence. \n\n\"Sleeping Stars\" contains one of the most melodic riffs on the album as well and has a certain ambiance about it that suits the ever-fitting album cover perfectly. The guitars may be the most important instrument here but they would not be nearly as atmospheric or effective without the lingering keyboard orchestrations in the background. Even when the keyboards are not being used, you can almost hear them ringing in your ears. The ambiance is greatly enhanced by this. This album is actually quite hard to fit into one genre. It tends to mainly fall under the melodic death metal and folk metal genres, but also implemented plenty of elements from black metal and power metal, especially the latter of these two. The incorporation of power metal into the riffs generally cause people to make allusions to bands such as Children of Bodom and Norther whenever they discuss Wintersun, and honestly, I don't really think this is fair. Wintersun is extremely different from both of these bands musically.\n\nThe drums in this album do what drums are supposed to do: provide musical and structural support to the guitars and the vocals. Kai generally alternates between blast beats common in black and death metal and mid-paced pounding. There is a bit of double bass that pummels the listener like a freight train. In terms of vocals, Jari uses both a style of screams that sound very influenced by black metal and an operatic, almost choir-like style of clean singing. Aside from the aforementioned \"Death and the Healing\". \"Sadness and Hate\" and the extremely folky segment of \"Starchild\" contain extremely powerful clean vocals. These aren't high pitched clean vocals either, and notably, there is no power metal influence in the vocals. More than anything else, Jari's cleans sound powerful and heroic. I could just imagine listening to this on a frigid winter mountain top gazing over a frozen landscape. Jari is not only one of the greatest guitarists in the metal genre but one of the greatest vocalists as well.\n\nMost people need no introduction to this album at this point. Wintersun truly has created a legendary album, whether or not your opinion of it is positive. I personally rank this in my top albums of all time within any style of music and was forever changed when I first heard this. I'm not going to say something cliche like \"Wintersun saved my life\", but this album certainly has impacted me in a highly positive way. \"Time I\" was finally released back in 2012 and while it's a good album, compared to this, it doesn't hold a candle. Any fan of melodic death metal that somehow managed to never hear of Wintersun would benefit greatly from doing so.\n",
        "\nWhen it comes to Wintersun, and especially Time I, the word \u201cpolarizing\u201d doesn't even begin to describe it. You'd be hard pressed to find a band that has such vitriolic detractors, and supporters so loyal. I have no doubt at least part of the reason for all the flak this album gets is because of all the drama surrounding it's production, and the eight years it took to make. That being said, if you don't like symphonic metal to begin with, there are a lot of things to dislike about Time I. It's bombastic, long-winded, and doesn't hold back with the symphonic elements. If it didn't hit just the right notes, I'd probably hate this album as much as the next guy, but Wintersun managed to reel me in with this one, and it is in my opinion one of the best in the genre.\n\nClocking in at 40 minutes with only five songs, Time I essentially consists of three main songs (Sons of Winter and Stars, Land of Snow and Sorrow, and Time) with \u201cWhen Time Fades Away\u201d serving as a symphony-only intro to the album, and \u201cDarkness and Frost\u201d as a soft instrumental break. Obviously these five songs are only half of what the band intended to release, but it surprisingly doesn't feel too short, and hey, I'd rather have five really good songs than ten bad ones. After the aforementioned intro, the album kicks into high gear with \u201cSons of Winter and Stars\u201d, a 13 minute song and the highlight of the album, with some of the best melodies coming from this song. The chorus is one the best I've ever heard, mostly because the song really builds up to it, not giving you the first chorus until almost 9 minutes into it, and when it finally hits, it quite literally send shivers down My spine.\n\nThe melody on Time I is definitely the most important aspect, as it keeps this album from being a huge mess of incoherent noise, and gives you something to latch onto and really feel, which is what a lot of symphonic metal bands forget to do (I'm looking at you, Fleshgod Apocalypse). Although I've heard this album referred to as \u201cblackened\u201d, don't expect to hear any black metal-like melodies, most of the melody on Time I is almost power metal-esque in that it's very vocal driven, and although I don't like to use the word, \u201cepic\u201d does describe it well. Most of \u201cSons of Winter and Stars\u201d is full of fairly uplifting melodies, while \u201cTime\u201d and \u201cLand of Snow and Sorrow\u201d (especially the latter) feel more melancholy and bittersweet, like thinking about good memories, but feeling sad that you can never relive them (Oh god I'm starting to sound pretentious Aren't I).\n\nTime I's vocals are pretty solid, with Jari's high-pitched harsh vocals sounding similar to Kalmah, not to high-pitched, but high enough that it's not a growl. These are swapped out about 50/50 with mid-range clean vocals that do most of the melodic parts, and convey a whole lot of emotion in the process. Neither style is used too much, and neither is used to little. I don't usually like it when vocalists switch between clean and harsh vocals (One other exception is Opeth) but it definitely works on this album, accenting both the more aggressive parts and the melodic parts well.\n\nProduction-wise this album is about average, focused neither on the high or low end, creating a fairly balanced sound and allowing the symphonic elements to shine without completely dominating the sound. There is enough emphasis on the vocals that you can clearly hear them at all times, whether it's the clean or harsh vocals, they're always a little bit louder than the rest of the instruments, but not obnoxiously so. There's definitely more focus on the symphonic side of things than on the regular instruments, with the guitar really just providing another layer of music, not really leading most of the album except for \u201cLand of Snow and Sorrow\u201d, although the only guitar solo on the album appears on \u201cTime\u201d. Though not the lead instrument, the guitar-work on this album is good, I hesitate to say great because it doesn't really get a chance to shine except maybe on \"Land of Snow and Sorrow\". The drums are utilized really well, playing blast beats sparingly, mostly sticking to rhythms that accent whatever the symphony is doing, and going really light on the fills. The bass is pretty much inaudible on the whole album, so there's not really much to say about that. \n\nTime I is overall an example of the more bombastic style of symphonic metal done right, with plenty of interesting song structures and ear-catching melodies to balance out the sheer volume of sound it throws at you. It's performed at a pace that doesn't drag, but doesn't go so fast that you can't tell what's going on. This really is not a first listen album though, and it'll probably take a few listens to be able to really follow and enjoy everything that's going on, but once you get through those first few test spins, it's an album that delivers on a very visceral level, on an extremely grand scale. Though not for everyone, it's absolutely for Me.\n",
        "\nThere are albums in certain genres that are pretty much superior to everything that has been done by other acts joined with them in the past. This album is one of them. Say what you want about it, but I see Wintersun's 2004 self-titled debut as an absolutely outstanding masterwork. In 2003, Jari M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4 of Ensiferum decided that he had too much spare time. So he decided to make a side project. That very side project went by the name of, \"Wintersun\". It has now become a front project (he left his main project), but this was during the days when it was his second priority. This is their self-titled debut and it's definitely my favorite album of 2004 (Next to \"Sonic Firestorm\" by DragonForce). The riffs are very atmospheric and melodic, the vocals are powerful and it has some very mature, complex rhythms. I can definitely see why so shortly after this album was made, Jari decided to leave Ensiferum and put his full dedication into this band. Now, let me get into explaining the title of this review to those who may be a bit confused about it.\n\n\"Wintersun\"...perfect title. Winter is a blistering cold time. It sends shivers down your spine. This album is chock-full of blistering riffs and vocals and guitar work. The sun is something that can be enjoyed when you're at a pool or something. The word \"sunny\" can normally be used when someone is explaining a time that they had that they enjoyed. This album can sound pretty happy at some points. But winter can be a dark time and so can this album. This may have been a stupid example, but it was the first thing on my mind after this album had stopped playing. Now, I'll go on to my interpretation of what genre to call this. There is a lot of debate over what to call this. There are a lot of genres incorporated in this album, but overall, I'd say that folk metal is the most prominent out of all of them.\n\nSome people have called this album black metal or death metal. Some have called it power metal as well. The most prominent black metal thing about this album is the vocals. Vocals don't create a genre. I guess that they also have a bit of a black metallic atmosphere, with the epic sound, but it's closer to folk. The most death metallic thing about this album is the drumming (which is definitely way closer to tech-death than just regular death). The closest thing to folk is the medieval-influenced sound, but folk metal can also have that. It does have a bit of a black metal-ish atmosphere, but the epic sound is closer to folk metal. Not to mention the riffs. They are all about the sound used those epic folk and power metal bands, such as Blind Guardian and Hammerfall. The most power metallic thing about this is that it has sweet and epic melodies. But the epic sound that this album possesses makes me feel as though I am surrounded by battles told of in folklore. Not to mention the epic fantasy lyrics used and the smooth, yet hard bass playing. That's just what I hear. You can hear something different. Now let's talk a bit more about the music on the album in terms of levels of greatness.\n\nThe album opens up with the main riff to \"Beyond The Dark Sun\". It's an epic, high pitched riff that's packed with energy and charisma. Jari kicks off the vocals with a low and soft speaking voice, which descends into ferocious screaming within the next twenty seconds. \"Winter Madness\" is probably the most rhythmically complex. It has some very well-structured drumming and it can have a lot of tempo changes, without being annoying. Isn't that something for you. It and \"Sleeping Stars\" are probably the most folk-ish songs on the album, or at least devoid of other genres. Sleeping Stars is a slow song, but not quite a ballad. It's a just-under-mid paced song. Oh, and by the way, that main riff...one of the best riffs that I have ever heard. \"Death and The Healing\" is the real ballad of the album. Sure, it can get a little cheesy, but I still find it to be enjoyable. The amount of cheese put on top is exactly the right amount. \"Beautiful Death\" has the deepest lyricism on the album for sure. It drives away from the fantasy and it really makes you feel the depression and anger that the protagonist in this track feels and is describing. It was able to make me feel extremely captivated. \"Sadness and Hate\" is the epic of the album. The epic and depressing nature of this track is completely off the chart. There is quite a lot of complexity within this track, yet it somehow manages to prevent itself from throwing the listener off. I really love the melodic riffs on this track, as not one fails to fully captivate me. The passion put into the chorus of this track is absolutely amazing. Nothing could complement it more than the lyrics. \n\n\"My eyes bleed for you, my star, my pride and the love of my heart.\nBut why did you had to fly so far? I raged and it tore me apart.\nI promise to you with sadness and hate,\nWherever I might go, you will know\".\n\nWhile the lyrics may be rather simplistic, they definitely give off what they mean to, which is pure depression. I am completely aware that I have just mentioned a shitload of tracks, but hey, it was necessary. However, I am not saying that any of the other tracks weren't good.\n\nThere are two things that stand out to me the most on this album. One of them is the drumming. It sounds a lot like Dave Mackintosh's early days in Bal Sagoth and also like the guy who did the drumming on Death's \"Human\". The drumming is very focused and technical, but it doesn't refrain from being powerful and aggressive as hell. It's a good thing that this album has blast beats because if it didn't, it would just get kinda flowery. It is also a good thing that the drumming has variety. This isn't the kind of music where you can just do one thing for an entire album. Sometimes it can work, but not here. Here, the drumming is extremely adventurous, which is for its own good. The way that it can change beat without annoyance is fantastic. The other thing that especially catches my attention is the guitar work. The leads are virtuosic and they don't just fuck around like some of those black metal and death metal solos do. However, I enjoy the rhythm guitar even more. These riffs are definitely pretty innovative. Sure, they have strong influences from other artists, but not to the point where they just start ripping off everything. They are picked through fast and they have a very big structure behind them. That was what stood out to me. The vocals were also well-executed. The harsh vocals really give that extra fierceness over the aggressive, yet beautiful music of this album. I once felt like the clean vocals were not quite as gripping as the harsh ones. This was until I had learned to let this album take me on a multidimensional ride and allowed myself to understand the many elements of this album. Due to this, I enjoyed the album quite a lot more.\n\nOverall, this is one outstanding piece of music. By far my favorite album in the folk metal genre. A lot of albums in that genre have seemed to get quite a bit flawed, but this one keeps away from that. I really cannot find anything that I can consider to be classifiable as a flaw, let alone even non-captivating. This is one of my favorite albums of all time, but even if you can fault this masterwork, this is for sure an record that you can definitely expect to immensely enjoy. This album has influenced many current artists. It isn't quite old enough yet to be considered a classic, but it will be considered to be a major one when it is. It is an absolute milestone in heavy metal music and the praise that people give it is deserved beyond words. It has been praised for a decade and I'm sure it will do the same for years to come If you ask me, it deserves what it gets and then some. If you are a fan of abrasiveness, along with complexity and epicness, buy this album. There is no possible way that it can disappoint you.\n",
        "\nWhere to begin with this. There's a lot to talk about with Time I. There's the history with this album being delayed, there's the compositions of the music that are absolutely massive to say the least, there's details in the music itself that make it stand out from other melodeath releases, and the list just goes on from there. I have noticed that this album seems to get a love or hate affair when it comes to everything that makes the sound enormous. Some have praised it for it's epic orchestrations and synthesizers that help add meat to the plate, while others have said that it gets numbing after a while due to how constant everything is going without leaving the listener much time to breathe, not counting the 2 instrumentals. I can certainly understand some of the things that people say when they're not a fan, but I, for one, love it. \n\nFirst off, let's start with the closest thing to a gripe that I have, that being the production. As far as how everything blends together to make a huge sounding release, it's fantastic. The synths, keyboards, and everything else sound great and make the music constantly interesting and sometimes beautiful. However, at the sacrifice of having all of these majestic sounds going on, the other instruments seem to take a back seat to them. The guitars are never absent enough to the point where it doesn't sound like metal at all, but there are times where you'll wish they could have been turned up a little when the synthesizers and everything else start to take over. The drums also could have been given a bit more kick, but they're still serviceable at providing a beat to carry the music, as any drumming on an album should. As for the bass, what bass? There have been times where I could have sworn I heard some bass during certain sections, but it's not something you'll hear for the entire 40 minute duration. With that being said, the music doesn't sound flat at all and it's consistently engaging, so I can't complain too much about how the instruments were handled in the mix, although it would have been nice to have some louder guitars, punchy drums, and constantly audible bass. \n\nHell, the music itself is amazing, so I can't just gripe constantly about how I wish certain things were handled. At the end of the day, \"Time I\" is a 40 minute experience that holds a surprising amount of replay value due to it's not too long duration and how well the songs flow together to make for what sounds like 1 long song and not just 5, hence why I called this album an experience. It's not just something you'll look at and say \"Hey, I like this one song. I think I'll listen to that\". It's something that you will be wanting to listen to in it's entirety because of how well the music flows. This is one of the most important things that a concept album should get right, and boy did Wintersun get it right. To be fair, I used to think \"Sons Of Winter And Stars\" overstayed it's welcome at 13 and a half minutes. Now, I can't really say that's an issue after letting all of the music sink into me. As epic as that song sounds and how nicely the preceding instrumental \"When Time Fades Away\" flows into it, that's still just 1 song. \n\n\"Land Of Snow And Sorrow\" is, to me, the best song on the album by far, and one of the best melodic death metal songs you'll ever come across. The melodies throughout are some of the best I've heard in metal, you just have to hear it to believe it. The 2nd and last instrumental \"Darkness And Frost\" comes in next and is pretty cool overall, which then goes into the album closer known as \"Time\". Aside from the last 3 minutes dragging out just a little bit, the song as a whole serves as an excellent closer with some of the best vocals that Jari M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4 has done. It's a huge song, but then again, so are the previous ones, so it's not saying much. It's great just like the rest of the album, I'll leave it at that since I can't do justice as to how great all of these songs are in terms of scope and quality. \n\nIt might not be everyone's cup of tea, but if symphonic melodeath is your thing and you somehow haven't gotten around to checking out Wintersun, you have been missing out. The mastering leaves a bit to be desired, but the music itself is still fantastic. Good thing that this album has quite a bit of replay value. Otherwise, the wait for \"Time II\" would be even more torturous.\n",
        "\nI am going to attempt to review what might be my favorite album of all time. I don\u2019t know if I have the skill to properly articulate how perfect this album is, but I will give it a shot. I am sure at the time, back in 2004, people thought it was crazy that Jari M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4 had left Ensiferum, at (in my humble opinion) a time when they were at their best, to record a solo project. But thank the one-eyed god he did because this album is an emotional and epic frostbitten journey. Wintersun\u2019s self-titled album combines the best elements of epic, melodic death, black, and folk metal together to create a true masterpiece of metal. This album is 10 years now and it stands out as one of the best of the 21st century. \n\nThe music on this album has a great deal of diversity \u2013 there are blazingly fast parts with soaring guitars showcasing Jari\u2019s skill as a musician, and there are slower majestic parts, layered with synths that provide a cold and lonely atmosphere. What it all has in common is Jari\u2019s masterful composition. These songs \u2013 short (like Beyond the Dark Sun, coming in at only 02:38) and long alike (like Sadness and Hate at 10:16) \u2013 are well crafted. They don\u2019t follow the general boring verse-chorus structure found in more generic compositions. These songs carry the listener along, through dead forests and up snowy mountains \u2013 Jari knows how to build up to, and reward a listener with a musical climax in each of his compositions. Wintersun is full of moments like this, moments that give you goosebumps and leave you craving for another listen.\n\nThe music often utilizes a black metal style tremolo picking combined with keyboards evocative of some of power metal\u2019s most accomplished acts \u2013 but without all the cheese. The drumming is top notch and includes blast beats that are used sparingly and appropriately (check out 00:50 on track 2, \u2018Winter Madness\u2019). Jari\u2019s harsh vocals are top notch. His screams are black metal worthy, yet the lyrics are fairly comprehensible. As in Ensiferum, one can expect moments of clean singing, sometimes even layered to create a more \u2018choral\u2019 effect. These moments are very well done and incorporated seamlessly into the composition as a whole (for example, see 03:25 on track 6, \u2018Starchild\u2019). Those fans of technical finesse and guitar virtuosity will not be disappointed with the album\u2019s guitar solos. Though they are complex and impressive to hear, they are not pointless expressions of guitar mastery. These solos fit very well on the album and accompany the rest of the songs well often providing the aforementioned musical climax. Here\u2019s a specific example of that: Listen to track 4, \u2018Battle Against Time,\u2019 starting at about 4:09 and listen to how well the song flows into the guitar solo and then back into the song\u2019s main chorus. \n\nThe music is the sonic accompaniment to the stories crafted in the lyrics. Jari has the chops to write quite good lyrics to go along with his music. The lyrics primarily deal with introspection and yearning to discover the meaning of life and death all with a backdrop of ice and snow and the coldness of the void of space. Jari uses a good deal of imagery to bring his epic to life \u2013 it is particularly impressive since he is a non-native English speaker. \n\nWintersun is epic without being too cheesy, virtuosity without being pretentious, enjoyable and accessible, yet layered and deep \u2013 worthy of multiple listens. This album is a classic, and even at its 10th birthday, it continues to stand the test of time.\n",
        "\nJari M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4 took 8 years to release this album, and it's only five tracks - let's cry about it together. Shut the fuck up and stop complaining about how long it took Jari M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4 to release this album. If you really were a fan of Wintersun, you'd know that Wintersun's peak time was in 2009-2010. Chances are you've heard of this band couple years back , due to great support given by Nuclear Blast. Do yourself a favour and go to their YouTube channeland let me know if you see one Wintersun video. There are literally none. Oh wait a second, they do. They've shared videos that were already uploaded by other fans. Videos that have hundreds of thousands of views, still not convincing enough to promote Wintersun? Nope, Deathstars is much more important. Nevertheless, I don't care how long it took Jari to release, it is not a great album. I don't even know what Jari M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4 was thinking when he wrote this music. Since when does Wintersun sound like fucking Agalloch and Empyrium? I don't know where Jari got the idea of having over 10 guests will make an album very special. Time I sounds nothing like the first album. Wintersun was a proper symphonic / melodic death metal album , Time I is a cinematic / film soundtrack album. Jari went from writing metal songs to writing film soundtracks. I guess this goes back to Jari being a typical dickhead. Finntroll need a guy like Jari M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4.\n\nThe songs on Time I are not really that bad. If anything, they are well-written and have very catchy melodies. So this is what money does to you. Jari has ten times better production than the first album but yet still it just doesn't seem right. Back in 2004 Jari wrote the album by himself and it sounded perfect. 8 years later he releases an album with different type of musical direction. Although there's one thing that hasn't changed. The stupid same musical structure over each song is still the same. Acoustic guitar for minute, mimicked riff kicks in, song turns into a jazz song, then back with the riff then keyboard tune that goes for fucking 3 minutes. You need to hear this album fully to actually enjoy it. It's like songs are sequel to each other. It's not a problem with me, but with the way Jari writes his music, that's where the problem is. The viking influences are still there with orchestral choruses, but again the two proper songs go for fucking twelve minutes. I can wait for those Epic moments , but Jari shouldn't make us wait. I paid thirty bucks extra for the limited edition with the so called Hidden Track. What an absolute waste of four minutes, where the song goes for like thirty seconds and the rest is fucking pure silence.\n\nThe two instrumentals are the other problem. Since when does Jari M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4 have instrumentals? It should be considered a sin for Jari if there are no solos/riffs in a song he writes. Guess I was wrong. These instrumentals sound something like Tarzan running around in a jungle. I don't understand the point of them, they are epic okay, but not the very type of symphonic metal. Winds of Plague had better melodies on their last album than Time I. I can't believe I just wrote that , but it's true.\n\nJari describes his own music as 'Extreme Majestic Technical Epic Melodic Metal. Sorry dude, consider that line dead now. The only extreme/epic thing left is Jari's vocals. The harsh vocals are very good, but his clean vocals are very questionable. They truly do suck. On Sleeping Stars, he echoed the fuck out of those clean vocals to make them sound good. Now it explains why his clean vocals suck. Jari M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4 needs to find himself a new label, cause I don't know what's going on with him and Nuclear Blast Records. They absolutely fucked everything up for Wintersun. Wintersun is just Jari M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4. Forget everyone else - those so called members of the band are just dropkicks hoping they'd make couple bucks off Jari. Jari M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4 is dumb enough to hire them for sessions, when he could really do it on his own a thousand times better. The first album speaks for itself.\n",
        "\nFirst of all, I believe that this album gets an unnecessarily bad reputation. As soon as Time I is mentioned, there are a number of negative words that instantly flow into people's minds, including, but not limited to, synthy, exasperated, too loud, programmed, over-produced, Jari-masturbation, and bland. Some of this is, of course, true; it is one of the synthiest albums I know. Where there might be a total of five or six \"metal instrument tracks,\" there could be upwards of twenty synth tracks, including synth patches from everywhere. I believe, in the final cut, there are over A THOUSAND tracks, the overwhelming majority being synthesized MIDI tracks. And I personally don't believe that Jari sat down at a MIDI-keyboard and played every synthesized note; I'm positive there was a significant amount of programming involved with the writing. I'm not all to convinced that the piano line at the end of Time is actually playable. Is this a bad thing? Well, it's up to you to decide if that offends you on an artistic level or not. The rest of the issues I brought up will be mentioned in the rest of this review.\n\nSo, let us look at this album as a whole. Here is how I feel the album was conceptualized: after the self-titled Wintersun, Jari just wrote a lot of music down. An awful lot of ideas. He put all those ideas together and made one thirteen and a half minute long song called Sons of Winter and Stars (I'll touch more on this song later). But you can't very well release a thirteen minute long album, can you? So he wrote Land of Snow and Sorrow off of the development of one riff, and tried VERY hard to re-create Sons of Winter and Stars with Time. But still, only thirty minutes. Gotta add some filler. So Jari took the first riff of Time and developed it into the track Darkness and Frost, and wrote the four minute long intro to Sons of Winter and Stars, calling it When Time Fades Away. And that's how I believe this album was made. The last three tracks actually feel quite natural as a whole, leading pretty well into one another, with similar feels and styles. Sons of Winter and Stars is truly the outcast of this album.\n\nBut, Sons of Winter and Stars is absolutely amazing, in my opinion. I love this song. I would buy the entire album based off of this one song alone. The only issue I see myself having with it is that it really seems like what I mentioned: a bunch of ideas just kinda put after one another in order to create a semi-cohesive whole. There's a clip online where Jari goes through the process of this song, and it truly is broken into many, many sections, based off of riff, or feel, or whatever. [In the words of Jari] there's the intro, then the Master of Puppets section, then the speed section, followed by the hairy riff, then the first verse, the progressive section, then the Killer riff, second verse, then the Devin [Townsend] section. That's only in the first part of the song. Besides being more or less in the same key (switching between C minor and F minor), there's not an awful lot of cohesion between all of these sections. \n\nLooking aside from that, though, each individual section is quite interesting. The \"speed\" section features an outrageously cool riff, and the Killer riff lives up to its name. It took me days to figure out the \"progressive section,\" with metre changes everywhere (but actually quite tastefully; it doesn't FEEL like there are an awful lot of metre changes. Dream Theater/Symphony X, I'm looking at you.). The Devin section is, not surprisingly, incredibly reminiscent of Devin Townsend-esque vocal layering, and to amazing effect. All layered voices are auto-tuned and quantized until they hardly sound real anymore, but let's face it, with this album, we can't be too much of a stickler on the use of technology, without throwing out the album completely. But the composition is downright INTERESTING! There's a lot of chromaticism, like the quite awesome use of the Neapolitan Db chord in the Devin/middle sections, some cool suspensions and playing with harmony to boot. You don't see writing like that ANYWHERE else in the metal world, and it is very refreshing! \n\nThe opening track, When Time Fades Away, gets a lot of flack for being far too long for an intro track. I don't agree with this notion; four minutes might be a little long but it doesn't feel long-winded or lazy at any point in time. It just functions as a lead-in to the star of the album. Land of Snow and Sorrow isn't bad at all, either, still featuring some interesting harmonic work. Darkness and Frost I find a little boring, just because the theme isn't developed very much, and Time is still pretty good. I believe the biggest fault of this album to be that it begins with the strongest song, peaking at the very beginning, and the next twenty minutes are just downhill. If it could be somehow re-worked so that the album ended with Sons of Winter and Stars, it would feel a lot better. \n\nAll in all, it's worth owning this album. I personally don't listen to it start to finish as an \"album experience,\" but I enjoy the three songs quite a lot in their own regard. And good lord, Sons of Winter and Stars is such a fun song to play guitar along to. I just hope that Time II is structured a little better. And I hope even more that in the future, Jari just hires a damn orchestra. Music as interesting as he's writing is worth paying a lot of money in order to create a proper scope. It's exceptionally good music, it just needs some work.\n",
        "\nFuck it, I'm doing it. I know, I know, I know, this has a billion reviews, and people have done negatives and ripped on it for all sorts of reasons, but still, no one has done it hard enough, so here we are. People are always finding something to appreciate, something to respect, maybe it's a song, or an interlude, or a simple appreciation of effort, but that just won't do. I say no more! Time I must be held accountable for its actions and be known as the complete musical and artistic atrocity that it is! This is the musical equivalent of a barbie doll having violent diarrhea into a fairies blender, and the artistic equal to someone smuggling an impressive volume of cut methamphetamine inside their urethra, and it is without a doubt the worst album I have ever sat through.\n\nUndoubtedly my biggest issue here is the dreaded synthphonics which fill every second of this cancerous lump. Symphonies and metal already have a strained relationship with anything even remotely resembling quality music. The reasons for this are pretty obvious, first and foremost being that most bands put literally no effort into combining the two sounds with any sort of care, meaning you end up with a bunch of strings and horns over the top of completely vapid, uninteresting chug riffs or gallops. The second reason is that many bands who do this seem to have a really low tier interest in classical music despite, you know, making their music focus entirely on it, meaning you're more likely to be getting boring film soundtrack tones rather than something intricate and carefully composed. All in all, the formula tends to be pretty bad as is, boring riffs and boring movie scores played in tandem. It's not exactly thrilling stuff, despite the odd one pulling something more compelling out of their ass.\n\nCo-existing with the bands which use real orchestras or realistic synths to attempt to recreate an authentic sound are the ones who play up their synthiness at the same time as removing the focus from the riffs, and there is no forgiveness for them. These sort of bands have all the same issues of mixing boring metal and boring quasi-classical \"stirring strings\", but they lack the texture or \"authenticity\" of it all. Instead of paying out the arse for a real symphony, or trying tweak their keyboard effects to make it sound like it features real instruments, synthphonic bands wear their fabricated nature as a badge of honour. They proudly choose the most digitized and barely approximate midi tones and slap them right up front, not aiming for the scale of a real symphony, but instead to obtain a smaller scale form of splendor. Many of these bands deliberately opt for an overall low gloss sound, using their cheapness as a form of minimalistic authenticity of its own outside of any sort of organic validity to the impersonated instruments, like Summoning for instance. The general idea does have a following due it reminding people of mid 90's RPG music, although since that style of music that ever appalled to me, so I utterly despise it with all my being, and any band who does it is bound to be a laughable joke of pseudo-epic garbage to my ears. So, where does Wintersun's fit in to all this? Simply, Time I is by far the most synthphonic album ever made.\n\nKnowing how synth focused the style already is, finding a way to be clearly more overdone than any of their peers is a tough ask, but Time I pulls it off with ease. Wintersun's second full length album is ridiculously committed to the cause of using blatant computerised replications of real instruments to create epic soundscapes over literally every second of the album. Fast or slow, bold or pensive, it doesn't matter, this album is drowning in superfluous computer sound. The big difference they've got in comparison to other poorly synthesized symphonic acts is how they've gone about it in a shiny, slick way instead of trying to capture some kind of goofy dungeon synth or video game retro vibe. It's disgusting. As in the very concept makes me feel sick in the guts. This is loaded to the tits with layer after layer of bad sounding digitized violins, horns, choirs, Japanese instruments, random beeps and laser sounds, and whatever else the band found in the hundred and eighty three midi packs they downloaded. Every element of the music sounds like it was played by pressing a key, even when it's a supposed to sound like a number of string instruments soaring off one another; every \"instrument\" here plays in tones, rather than notes or plucks or chords. This isn't aiming for some kind of retro epic, this is aiming for genuine, expressive and bold grandeur and it fails horribly based on how utterly plastic, glossy and downright fake it all sounds, as well as how badly it's all written.\n\nJust having a terrible sound is bad enough, but the composition here is embarrassingly poor too. The melodies created by the synths are simplistic and unmoving, made even worse by their pristine smoothness since they're a tone mapped to a button, not someone actually drawing a bow along a string, which keeps any character from reverberating through a single note. The band covers for the lack of individual quality by playing about eight of them at any given time and it's just way too much. The whole album is messy clusterfuck of vaguely similar melodies being played on a wide range of phoney instruments at the same time, with nothing in particular taking centre stage or developing into anything impressive. Everything stays at the same lacking standard of being a tedious melodic power or folk metal transposition, and any sort of attempted escalation or growth within the music is handled by just throwing a different tedious melodic power or folk metal transposition over the top. Individually every part sounds like shit, but as a whole the cacophony is downright annoying and it never fucking stops. I'd complain that the complete, unwavering focus on the garish and grating keyboard crap was drowning out the metal, but the metal here is somewhere between ridiculously 16th note abusing Euro power, rejected Ensiferum jigs, and vapid melodeath that makes the debut look halfway decent by comparison, so the fact they've buried the garbage is one of the few positive things I could say about the album.\n\nAlthough I've been saying \"Wintersun\" and \"they\" a lot so far, this is very much a case of one guy running the show. Jari wrote all the \"epic\" synthphonies, he wrote all the power metal melodies, basically anything which has been made audible Jari made, the rest of the band can go die in the snow as far as he cares. Jari is so arrogant that if he went the Amon Amarth route and made an action figure of himself, it'd effectively be a Mr Potato Head with his own face, except all the the detachable parts would just be smaller versions of his own face. I don't see epic landscapes when listening to this, I see a stuck up Finnish knob, sitting in a room with walls covered in self portraits, playing a keyboard. No, wait, I don't even see that. I see him in his face-room sitting on a computer, layering dozens of chintzy keyboard tracks together carelessly, crying at his own majesty. It desperately wants to be bombastic, but it comes across as something with scale of the most unadventurous bedroom bands just glossier and more expensive; as such the album is a 40 minute procession of abject failure.\n\nReally, it's disgustingly apparent M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4 is the only one who is given the right to stand out against the onslaught of impudent dreck. Usually with his vocals which are quite loud in the mix, but he also gets the odd power metal melodic lick and a solitary, lonely guitar solo. His vocals are not too bad by all standards when taken alone, highly clean vocal centric, but honestly this album is far more power metal than death so that's ok; his issue is how big he's trying to sound. There's no denying he's absolutely certain in the magnitude of the music, and he puts on the absolute biggest act he can, it sounds utterly ridiculous next to the smallness of the sound.\n\nI hate this to a point I can barely express it properly, the album infuriates me on musical and artistic levels, and I hate the sort of personality and attitude behind it. Time I is the musical equivalent of those mega-mansions Arabian Sheikh's live in, where they gold plate literally every item in their possession that is easily accessible, and drape anything that's too hard to melt ingots over in a tasteless royal blue. To Jari I'm sure this is a regal, classy thing, but to a bystander the whole product is nauseatingly tacky. I don't care that this took 8 years to make, hell I hope Jari takes a decade between every release so he dies an old man before he subjects us to much more of this shit, this isn't terrible because of hype, or wait time, it's terrible because it's obnoxious glossy droll incessantly trying to show you it's clever by demonstrating it has the skill to piss in its own mouth.\n",
        "\nNominated as one of the best in heavy metal history, if not in all of music's history, stands Wintersun's first album. Even through all this hype, I did not get what the craze was all about.\n\nThe album opens with \"Beyond the Dark Sun\", one of the best in the record. This song describes the instruments very well. Kai's drums are clean. For this genre, they feel perfect. On the other hand, Jari's guitars are pretty dull, especially after the third or fourth song. This fast-paced song also introduces to the concept of the album with shredding guitars and blast beating drums.\n\nJari's voice is something that should be discussed. He does both the harmonic vocals and guttural ones and it is clear he has a wide range. However, it all falls flat because the vocals lack connection to the songs. Jari sings whenever he feels like, leaving a bad structure to the song and sometimes taking the atmosphere of the song right out. Speaking of his vocals, his shriek gets pretty annoying and dull after listening to it for awhile, as does his guitar. The solos are everywhere and no riff or solo is simple; they are all complicated. It reminds me of Dragonforce where mind-numbing solos are everywhere, taking all the originality out. He is a very talented guitarist, but his solos feel so out of place, it is almost impossible not to get angry when one comes up, especially in the last songs where they hit the 8 minute marker due to the long solos. All the songs get needlessly long and flat because of both Jari's vocals and guitars.\n\nOn the drumming subject, Kai is also another talented musician, though he falls flat for the same reason as Jari does. His drumrolls are all too complex and everywhere, and sickening, especially in slow songs. His fast-paced madness works in songs like \"Beyond The Dark Sun\", \"Winter Madness\", and \"Battle Against Time\", mainly because of the fast pace, though in songs like \"Sleeping Stars\" and \"Death and the Healing\", it feels boring and needless. There is no time to breathe in this album. It is like Jari M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4's ego grew a conscience and created this.\n\nThe mixture of these three elements - drums, guitars, and vocals - makes the album dull and needlessly long with the last song facing the 10 minute mark, yet this is by no means saying that there are not good mentionables in this piece. \"Beyond the Dark Sun\" is fast-paced and a great song to hear if there is a short time on your hands. \"Winter Madness\" and \"Battle Against Time\", although having numb solos, are a blast to listen to. Also, \"Death and the Healing\" is also a pretty good one, if not for its solos.\n\nOverall, the album suffers a lot, especially from Jari. I wish that the next album will contain songs that are not needlessly complicated and long. It has some good candidates for a good album, but it all falls flat in the end. Fans of this genre will eat this up like candy, but I would not buy it for a full price.\n",
        "\nFirst up, I'd like to state that yeah, I know there's already 30 million reviews of this album and the last thing it really needs is another one. But when faced with spending your time constructively procrastination can be a powerful thing, so here I am, writing a review when I should be doing a summary of the Management and Discipline chapter in a book I'm reading. On with the review!\n\nThis album is a pretty cool one, kind of, sort of. Perhaps the best way of stating is that this could be that massive stone cold classic so many want it to be, but it isn't. It's like having to gorge yourself on on your favourite type of food for a week. It's like a cuban cigar that takes 24 hours to smoke through. To restate this in a really obvious manner: you can have too much of a good thing.\n\nJari knows how to write sweeping, grandiose melodeath/power metal riffs, he knows how to program sweeping, grandiose synths. This dude can do epic in his sleep. Unfortunately, he can't do subdued; or at least he can't slip it into a song. After eating a few mars bars, you generally tire of them. Similarly, you get tired of the midi inspired sugar kick here pretty quick. A headache starts appearing out of nowhere. Understandably, this is problematic, especially when there's about 35 minutes of it.\n\nSkip to a random part of any song, and it sounds fantastic. The guitars are all over the place but in a supremely consonant manner, and it's pretty cool to behold. I'm not much of a melodeath dude at all but it's fun enjoying this kind of stuff that's somewhere between Iron MaIden and Dragonforce. The synths fly and buzz around like bees made of cotton candy, the drums sitting there in the background but doing a bunch of fills and actually being quite underrated. It's vaguely baroque (I'm sure jari & his fanboys namedrop Vivaldi, Paganini etc. regularly), it's well played; sure the instruments sound generic (8 years and these are the best synths they found?) but they are playing cool parts! One would assume the fanbase of Time I is nerdy as it gets, in which case I'm sure I'm not the only one who's constantly reminded of that one righteously awesome video game moment. For a catchy abstract of this review, consider the line \"Time I is that super awesome video game moment for 40 odd minutes\". Final boss in Golden Sun 2, by the way.\n\nProblem is that it never ends. There is a rather brief interlude, but aside from that it's all systems go all the damn time. Everything just bleating away all the time, pounding you with this unrelenting bombast. You get numbed. You get bored. The synths and riffs stop becoming awesome and start getting really tiresome. You start to find faults, and there's a few of them; in the uncreative synth lines, in the way that the drums could be programmed and no one would have any idea whatsoever. In the fact that the album just never stops!! It really starts wearing you down, and it's not helped by the ludicrously overlong songs. Or by the production job that strips this of the few dynamics it ever had. So on and so forth.\n\nThis is not a bad album. But this problem is a big one. The best part of the album is the comedown at the end of the title track (and thus the end of the album), where we're left with a nice subdued soundtrack. It's really hard to describe just how much relief you feel when stuff drops away and it comes in. To conclude, giving this a listen won't kill you, and I'd argue that anyone who says this is actively bad is a bit of a killjoy. But dammit Jari, give us a break from time to time. Do an Opeth and drop a totally unrelated acoustic break into the sound. A field recording of you taking a shit. Anything!\n",
        "\nWith an 8-year wait between this record from the band's previous album, fans truly were in for a surprise for what Wintersun had in store for them. The wait, while a long one, was seemingly worth it. It seems like Wintersun are the Necrophagist of symphonic metal by doing up with this extremely long gap between this and their previous full-length. Basically everything that Wintersun garnered fans with before are bigger and better up front here. The guitarists don't provide much to the music in some areas, but while the group save themselves with symphonic passages, the amazing power metal-esque vocals basically take up all the music and bring the listener to a dreamland rollercoaster. \n\nThe songs are very long - heck there's only 5 of them with a 40 minute total runtime. But the interesting thing regarding even as far as that goes is that they still lead into each other like the album is one big song. Basically what Between the Buried and Me did with their Colors album is the same case here with track ordnance and construction. The mass of the band obviously desired to base the listener about with a cinematic audial presentation deemed great enough to the ears to please fans who have suffocated all these years for a new LP from their favorite group. \n\nNow I'll get back to the guitar work, while in some songs it's too slow or in a gothic metal/folk-metal esque radiance that only plays slow or completely non technical notes, they somewhat remain heavy as they are in this and the other genres I spoke of usually, but a downside to it all is that they're mastered really low in the mix while the orchestra elements and drums tend to want to take up all the lead. Kind of a shame for those expecting as much guitarwork as the band held on their previous LP. Now about the vocals, they're great and I mean really good. Jari M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4's voice when singing baritone is elegant as it is epic and the melodic death metal-style screams he also does in select moments are just about as amazing. \n\nThe whole center of this album seems to be led by symphonic passages and the vocals of the head of the band himself. While not a bad move, I can see why the record isn't for everybody according to the very mixed reviews it has received. Time I is a decent effort and does not disappoint (at least didn't disappoint me). Let's just hope Time II isn't another 8 years away.\n",
        "\nIt's not everyday I give an album a PERFECT rating on my blog and for Wintersun it's definitely a big return.\n\nAfter 8 years of waiting and endlessly searching on the net for articles about Wintersun's next record, it has finally been released and, my god, what a return!\n\nThis album is certainly a trip through space and time and many unique elements of Japanese music influences and speed metal added into one. This album had a lot to make up to Wintersun's self-titled debut and with dedication and 8 years, it surprisingly did. You can listen to this album from the beginning to end without a doubt with each song having its own form of element ranging from folk metal to melodic death metal to the crushing power metal that Wintersun has never failed to deliver to us. It honestly is a slap in the face due to its short track listing of only 5 songs and 40 minutes running time, which honestly feels like about 20 minutes. Its magical feel and atmosphere it provides to the listener who gives it a genuine chance will not be disappointed by its magical, fantastic guitar sound and its drums ,which honestly is probably the only minor flaw of the album. Sometimes you find that most of the other music covers up the drums, but it makes up for its uniquely clean vocals and harmonic 'orchestra' sound. \n\nIf I told somebody about Wintersun, I'd honestly choose this album to introduce them to the band, however it's not for everybody. It's not for those who look for 'brutal folk metal' or those looking for deep-themed Viking lyrics in their music. It's for those looking for something unique, yet sticking to Wintersun's signature sound, WHICH AT THE SAME TIME expands into different influences. \n\nI give this album 100% for its deep effort, amazing production, unique sound, and themes. Without a doubt, I couldn't give this album any lower than a 100% and I really, REALLY look forward to Time II due to Time I giving the listener a 'cliffhanger' to some extent at the end of the album. As you work, listen, or do any other activity and the last track has finally finished, you really do expect another one to come on, but those 40 minutes were just a WHOOOSH through a time tunnel of inconsistent adventure. \n\nWintersun is back and if I were Ensiferum, Eluveitie, or Moonsorrow, I'd be shitting myself.\n",
        "\nObviously this album is huge news, after waiting 8 years we finally have Jari M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4's latest addition to the metal world and the question on everyone's mind is: does it live up the the expectations? My answer is yes, everything about this album speaks of its carefully crafted nature, the layers of sound; orchestration, guitars and everything else so subtly built on top of one another to really give it a complex, layered and dense feel. These are some of the best orchestrations I have ever heard; with a lot of folk elements to them they instantly recall bands such as Ensiferum and Equilibrium. The real differences though arise in the composition of the metal parts.\n\n\"When Time Fades Away\" the opening instrumental is a bit long at four and a half minutes, especially when the album itself is only 40 minutes; it's still good though, it manages to stay interesting throughout the four minutes with a very haunting and melancholic yet epic atmosphere. The same could be said of the rest of the album, the intro builds right into \"Sons of Winter and Stars\"; this is an incredible song. It begins softly continuing on from the opening track and then explodes into a dense thicket of crushing guitars, bass and drums. This has become one of my favorite songs and definitely the best song of 2012; the constant change in dynamics and the switch between harsh vocals and clean is very well done. There are moments when it manages to be some of the heaviest, harshest metal you have heard and at other times it's as emotional as any ballad. The pinnacle of this thirteen minute epic comes towards the end, right after the soft emotional part it builds into one of the greatest choruses I have ever had the pleasure of listening too. \n\nThen we have a mid-paced beast of a song - \"Land of Snow and Sorrow\". This song has the least amount of harsh vocals in this album, but for the most part it doesn't need them. This song speaks of great pain and sorrow and really utilizes that haunting melancholic atmosphere I talked about earlier and turns it into a truly excellent ballad. Then we have another instrumental track, a bit unnecessary I feel, but it serves its purpose well and it's good so no real criticism there. \"Time\" the second epic of this album is another truly amazing piece, it picks up the speed a bit after 10 minutes of balladry and orchestral interlude, though it doesn't get as fast as \"Sons of Winter and Stars\". This one contains another great chorus sung with clean vocals and including the best vocals on the whole album. Even though this song is faster it still manages to be really sorrowful and dark really maintaining the feel of the whole album. \n\nOverall what really makes this album so good is a combination of the dark sorrowful atmosphere and the orchestration throughout which blends in with the metal perfectly. It's still metal, but very symphonic metal and it adds some progressive elements that really add to the feel. The vocal performance is also of the utmost perfection, Jari easily switches between clean and harsh vocals clearly drawing a line between the crushing metal and the melancholic emotional parts. The complexity is truly impressive and definitely helps to explain why Jari took so long with this album, I really hope Time ll can live up to the standard this has set because this is a truly superb slab of melodic death metal.\n",
        "\nEnsiferum's first album is a masterpiece and one of my favorite albums. When I found that the mastermind behind the album formed this band, I started watching and waiting to see what would become of this band like everyone else: waiting for this album. I felt like the self-titled was solid, but I thought eventually Jari would realize his vision he set out to achieve when he left Ensiferum. \n\n8 years later, Wintersun decides to greet you with a 5 minute intro. Please take note, Wintersun, that intros longer than 20 seconds are bad enough, but when you haven't produced anything in 8 years, making a 5 minute intro to start the \"album\" is absolutely absurd. Stop.\n\nOne of the 84 adjectives Jari uses to describe this band is \"technical\" and I'm glad to say that is accurate. This is extremely demanding on the technical end, very harmonically and structurally complex music. Of course, most of this is programmed music. This could explain part of the wait for this album. There's half of every musical instrument known to mankind being used. The overall feel of the music is I think what the band was going for and it's pretty cool in that regard.\n\nOther than that, I don't have much good to say about it.\n\nThe guitar tone is the weakest I've heard in a while. I listen to a lot of \"symphonic\" stuff with a lot of different things going on, but this is metal. Heavy fucking guitars...we need them. It's kind of important. The guitar is so far behind everything else it feels absent most of the time. Considering this band was kind of founded on guitar riffs, it's an odd decision to not only bury the guitar in the mix, but just fail to put any real leads on the album, especially considering Jari is a pretty damn good guitarist. The mix of most of the instruments is inconsistent and the whole things kind of blends into a goop of indistinguishable tones.\n\nAside from that, the songs' structures are too ambiguous for their own good. There are decent ideas throughout, but none are fleshed out and there is way too much \"ambient, winter-y, vaguely Oriental\"-sounding filler. Way, way too much. It's 40 minutes long and all of about 25 minutes is de facto \"song\". 8 years for 25 minutes of music.\n\nTime. Mine was very much wasted on this band.\n",
        "\nWhat can we say? The man behind Wintersun, Jari, is a dreamer and he is damn proud of what he has produced. Passion and effort were greatly applied here, so much so that Jari is not willing to ask a native English speaker to help him correct his lyrics, hence the lyrical slips such as \"I have awaken the darkness\". This music means everything to him and if he were to die right now, he might not feel as if there was \"so much left undone.\"\n\nOf the five tracks, there are two \"pairs\" of tracks on this album. The first two tracks form a nearly 18-minute anthem which can be divided into five parts. The elements of these parts (in order) are: entrancing, powerful, ambitious, peaceful, and then mighty. Darkness and Frost is an instrumental (as is the first track) and escalates perfectly into the final track, Time. Time itself is more of a one piece prog track as opposed to being split up into parts. And thanks for the solo. The screaming is as dark and clear as ever and the singing is very methodical and can really captivate an attentive listener.\n\nThe entire cd is mixed together into one huge anthem except the transition from Sons of Winter and Stars to the middle track (the oddball). My first listen to Land of Snow and Sorrow left me a bit confused. Being extremely catchy yet epic, I thought 'what is this slow mawkish track even doing here'? It took a few listens to start understanding it. Although being more mellow in comparison to the other more swift and variant tracks, this track shines as a plus. It is a song for true Wintersun fans, yet a track you could play for a Sabaton fan and blow him away.\n\nI am not quite sure exactly what took so long for this release, and frankly I do not care. There is a lot of other music to listen to. Maybe Jari could only write and record his music when he felt like it. However, that does not matter because the music is what it is. And it is awesome. Splitting the album into two releases in two different years was an attempt to get the band a bit more noticed. A brilliant idea, turning out to be a great success. I hope Jari is laughing at the critics who think they know him and his music better than himself.\n\nGood job man.\n",
        "\nAnother month comes, and yet another album that falls victim to being subject to too much hype has been released into the metal community. This particular album, Wintersun's Time I, has been many years in the making, with recording starting as early as 2006. This had been hyped up as being an epic album, with insane degrees of complexity, that would seamlessly fuse intricate symphonies with brutal guitar work and drumming, coupled with Jari Maenpaa's instantly recognizable vocals, both screamed and cleanly sung, to make the ultimate in symphonic metal releases. Unfortunately, things did not quite work out that way, and in my opinion, this is a poor release, which spends too long messing around with strange structures and the orchestral arrangements, and in this sense the songs became too over drawn out.\n\nThis album is five songs long, with a hidden track at the end, with two epics each lasting more than eleven minutes. The former of these, Sons Of Winter And Stars, is divided into four parts, each progressing the story a little more. This is the best of all the songs on the album, showcasing some gorgeous instrumental work, packing a real punch to it when it truly kicks in. The screamed vocals on here, however, are dreadful. They are overly raspy, and highlight the real problem with this release. Given that this is partially a melodic death metal album, one would expect at least a fair degree of heaviness. However, this album proved only one or two moments that are truly heavy and have a lasting impact, with many of the guitar riffs in particular feeling lackluster. The emphasis of this album is clearly on the symphonies themselves, as the true metal instrumentals are very weak and half formed. The drumming is sub-par, with a few quick beats that are bland, and the slower beats being a discredit to Kai Hahto's name, especially given how solid his performance on their self titled debut was.\n\nThe real success of this album is that it truly has an atmosphere of a land completely left to decay. Many of the songs have suggestive themes in their titles, such as Darkness, Snow, Frost and Sorrow, and all of these are fully realized within the overly complex instrumentals. Once again, it is the symphonies that hammer home these feelings, clearly having had a lot of time put into them. They are nothing when compared to such classics as Ride Of The Valkyries, but they are powerful enough in their own sense, with each instrument to be included having a good sense of depth to it. However, they are far from perfect, and are often far too long, impacting on the song's abilities to leave a lasting memory. The first listen to this album will almost certainly blow the listener away, but they just grow tiring upon multiple listens. Compare this to another band that has crazily long songs and a huge amount of style changes, such as Opeth or X Japan, and it becomes painfully obvious where the weakness lies. The songs on this release are, for the most part, overly long and never get straight to the point. No amount of precisely written symphonies can take away the fact that songs such as Land Of Snow and Sorrow or Time are just too long. Even Sons Of Winter And Stars tends to drag on as it goes through, without ever having a real feel of progression. They are good and epic enough in their own merits, but this does not make for a good solid investment in time, as proven by releases such as this one.\n\nWhen Time Fades Away is, in my opinion, the worst track on this album, for the fact that it is not a song in its own right. This just feels like an introduction to Sons Of Winter And Stars, which really does not need a four minute instrumental introduction to it, as it takes long enough to build up on its own. No amount of Japanese culture influenced melody can really take away from the fact that this song is pure dull, with no real sense of accomplishment behind it. This is a song that feels to have just been slapped on the album as an introduction, a way to build an atmosphere before the coming storm of the 13 minute epic that follows it, but surprisingly enough, this is the one song that FAILS to create any form of mood to it. This is the absolute most pointless song on the album, not fitting in with the categorization of metal that this album has had slapped onto it at all. This album has two instrumental songs, both of which really fail in their aims to create any form of atmosphere or sense of desperation that should accompany an album like this.\n\nThis is just another album that has suffered from being over hyped. By its own merits, this is a good enough album, possibly a 3. However, the fact that, going into this release, the listener expects one of the finest albums of the year and then are underwhelmed is just too great to ignore. The symphonies drag on too long, and the metal sections are just not enough from what the band's previous, self titled album would lead the listener to expect. This is the first in a two part release, with the second part due next year, and hopefully that will be a huge improvement, and focus more on the actual metal side of things than spending too long with symphonies. Even the soloing on this album is kept to a minimum, with there only being one memorable one throughout the entire album. This truly was a disappointing release, that is underwhelming in nearly every sense of the word, no matter how many glorious instrumental sections penetrate the listener's ears.\n",
        "\nIn honor of the recent announcement that Jari Maenpaa hates all of his fans and would like nothing more than to poo on the face of each and every one of you, I figure it's high time I actually get around to giving a similar treatment to his much lauded first labor of love. Just as Ensiferum was reaching peak popularity, a scheduling conflict arose between the band and Jari's pet solo project. He had to make a huge decision, and he decided to leave the band that was taking the collective metal fandom by storm and helping to give folk metal it's first huge boost in order to honor the studio time he had booked for Wintersun. I personally think this was a brilliant choice since I love Ensiferum and would love to hear them release an album more frequently than once every fucking decade.\n\nBut despite the fact that the absurd waiting period is nothing new for Jari's music (the first handful of songs written for this album came about in the mid nineties), this self titled debut is not the place to complain about such things. This is strangely ironic though, since the album feels like it takes four times longer to finish than it actually does. Yeah, this thing draaaags so badly that it may as well come bundled with an anchor. It's a little under and hour long, but part of me is convinced that that is only the case because it sucks so badly that it actually manages to warp the space-time continuum. I'd rather listen to Food for the Gods or Akhet Mery Ra, and those are both literally four hours long. I'm saying that without ever hearing those two albums, by the way, because they'd have to put a lot of effort into failing intentionally to be less interesting and more full of themselves than Wintersun here.\n\nOne of the biggest flaws with the album (apart from the songs themselves just not being very good) is the pacing. The eight tracks are arranged from shortest to longest, which I suspect was an attempt to make each new venture sound more epic than the last, leading to a giant, fulfilling climax with the ten minute closer, \"Sadness and Hate\". Really though, it just hammers home that each new song is going to be longer than the previous one, and it just ends up sounding stretched and forced. This means that even high tempo, blast beat filled numbers with tons of melody like \"Starchild\" just fade into the white noise that is the last 48 minutes of this album. It certainly doesn't help that Jari has continued with the whole irritating dichotomy that early Ensiferum suffered from here, which is that the slower, more grandiose songs are boring as fuck and the fast, melodic singalongs are hooky and infectious. So it isn't surprising that the only two tracks that are worth a damn are the first two (\"Beyond the Dark Sun\" and \"Winter Madness\"), which are unironically the fastest, shortest, and most to-the-point songs on the album. The former is an absolute riff monster with a pummeling pace and energy, while the former retains those qualities while injecting a lethal dose of melody, a great, singalong style chorus, and what is honestly one of my all time favorite guitar solos. This is the kind of thing Jari excels at, high speed power metal numbers with great hooks and a knack for condensing a lot of epic sensibilities into a short window.\n\nThe problem is that when he gets a bigger window, he continues to throw fucking everything he can find into the music and it ends up as a collection of dozens of unrelated ideas that don't at all mesh into a coherent song. I know I'm a hungry hungry hypocrite and all that, but this is all style and no substance. The vast majority of the last six tracks are an incoherent mess of melody and symphonics and super fast melodeath riffs and double bass and hilariously amateur local theatre style clean vocals and ballads and cookies and gummy bears and AAAAAAH. As a guy who is a giant fan of early Children of Bodom, this completely unrestrained and over the top blend of melodeath and power metal should theoretically appeal to me, but it's done in such a mind-bogglingly uninteresting way that I almost think this should be studied. It's a fascinating failure in that it manages to take a bunch of good things, use them far past their logical intended limit, continue to use them even when they don't work, and just mercilessly flog them until you forget why and how any of these elements were good in the first place. Just like the 2012-13 Lakers! ZING!\n\nTracks like \"Sleeping Stars\" and \"Death and the Healing\" just pull the goddamn dragchute on the album's pace. Slow songs aren't an issue, but when these two are both so dull and numbing that they could be considered a reasonable alternative to Novocaine and they both immediately follow an uptempo scorcher, it just makes you wonder why they were placed where they were in the first place. Oh wait, it's because that's how long the songs are and that was the only thing taken into consideration when arranging this. Which is a pretty huge issue because \"Battle Against Time\", \"Starchild\", and \"Beautiful Death\" all have a lot of potential as songs. They're either extraordinarily epic and melodic, or incredibly fast and melodic, but the trait they all share is that they're all about three minutes too long. Sections are repeated far too often and uninteresting melodic passages with about fifty different things happening show up and just wreck the atmosphere. \"Battle Against Time\" is like a four minute long continuous climax, and it builds up a grand journey that sounds like it would be goddamn awesome to experience, it's just unfortunate that there are three redundant minutes that add nothing at all to the song and instead just make it feel entirely too long for it's own good. This is frustrating because it just further showcases how flukey of a songwriter Jari truly is. Sometimes he nails it, other times he has good ideas but utterly fails to implement them effectively, but most of the time he just gets far more ambitious than he needs to be and completely misses his mark. \n\nAnd then there are the more ballady songs, and those are easily the worst offenders of this whole ordeal. It's bad enough that there are seventy six tracks of symphonics and clean vocals being layered on top of one another, but they don't succeed at what they aim for at all. They have no atmosphere, they just plod along with a ton of crap going on in the foreground and it just feels like all the synths and strings are trying to distract me from how bare bones the songs really are. It's like Cruella de Vil, with a gaint fluffy exterior that tries to cover up a frail, fragile base with glamorous excess. They're utterly inconsequential and just bring the album to a screeching halt whenever they appear. Even when they bust into two minute long sweeping solos, you can just imagine Jari (well... maybe not Jari, he's too in love with himself... so just imagine literally any other guitar player) sitting there with a completely uninterested look on his/her face as they shred these stale patterns over a completely lifeless track. I can find precisely zero \"majesty\" or \"beauty\" in these half-hearted logs of nothingness.\n\nDespite all the issues of the songs mostly being too long or too overblown to contain anything actually interesting, I can't help but feel like the completely bonkers track ordering is one of the biggest issues with the album. So, in the interest of science, I reordered it. I didn't edit down any of the songs like I'd suggested, but I may in the future. Try ordering the album like this:\n\n\"Battle Against Time\"\n\"Winter Madness\"\n\"Death and the Healing\"\n\"Beyond the Dark Sun\"\n\"Sadness and Hate\" \n\"Sleeping Stars\"\n\"Starchild\"\n\"Beautiful Death\"\n\nBy starting the album off with \"Battle Against Time\", you set the stage for a big epic, with the song's giant climaxes and clean chorus, it gives a bit of a taste of everything the album has to offer. Then we get a barnburner with another great chorus and a blistering solo, followed by a ballad, then the fastest, shortest song to lead into the longest track, which is far too full of itself but at least you aren't just praying for the album to end by the time it finally starts, followed the other ballad because it sucks but it at least keeps the flow going after the previous clunker, which actually sets the stage fairly well for the fast, long, abundantly melodic \"Starchild\", finally closing on the track with the most overtly epic atmosphere, ending the album on a strong, hard-hitting note of \"I'M NOT READY TO DIIIIEEEEEE\".\n\nThis is not perfect, as there's really no way to fix songs as boring as \"Sleeping Stars\", but at least it doesn't make every song feel like it's just taking ages to end, and it follows a more logical flow than how it's currently set up. If it were arranged like this, I'd still have all of the same issues with the album itself, but I could probably score it 15-20 points higher considering it at least wouldn't be as much of a chore to sit through.\n\nThe bottom line is that there are some good ideas here, but they're rarely implemented in such a way that makes them fit with all the rest of the ideas (good and bad) that are flying around the album. A huge portion can be described as the musical equivalent of Jari not understanding why a square peg doesn't fit in a round hole, and so he just starts bashing it with a mallet until the peg and hole are both damaged to the point of the peg being forced in. When Jari drops all the completely insane tendencies to just throw anything and everything at the listener and focuses his energy on strong melody or infectious hooks or straightforward metal, he can really nail it. \"Beyond the Dark Sun\" and \"Winter Madness\" are both fantastic songs, and there are some good ideas in a few other tracks that are just unfortunately arranged and put together like ass, while a couple others are completely unsalvageable trainwrecks. Add to that a terrible idea of flow and structure and then make it all spew forth from one of the most intensely unlikeable cocks in metal and you end up with a pretty shitty album overall. Jari Maenpaa folded with a focus and intensity normally seen only in successes. I'm not gonna call the fans a bunch of turds who are entertained by jingling keys and believe that something is majestic and beautiful simply because it has keys and they're told as such, but OH LOOK GO GET THE BALL! *throws tennis ball*\n\nPS - I hate how \"Jari Maenpaa\" is on the album art. God forbid somebody mistake this as a band effort instead of all coming from his one glorious, genius imagination. I hope he swallows a bumble bee.\n\n\nOriginally written for http://lairofthebastard.blogspot.com/\n",
        "\nAfter 8 years new Wintersun's album. Despite what track-listing says there are actually 3 songs instead of 5. When Time Fades Away is instrumental introduction for Sons Of Winter And Stars, and Darkness And Frost is introduction for Time. Intros aren't epic, but they serve good purpose for which they were intended. Sons Of Winter And Stars, Land Of Snow And Sorrow and Time are as complex and progressive as songs Starchild and Beautiful Death, but longer, and done in a little bit different style. The whole idea was not to make separate songs which will blow you away with speed, face-melting riffs and technical explosion of solos and drum-work, or beautiful and passionate ballads, but to make something that flows like a river does, and combines all of these elements. On its way there are parts where it runs fast, some chaotic parts with waterfalls and some tranquil parts on plains. When Time Fades Away is the spring of Sons Of Winter And Stars, and it flows through the ambient of orchestrations made in far-eastern style while crushing with riffs, machine gun-like drums and harsh vocals, drifting away into the complex structure of the song where orchestrations are very dominant, and chorus are epic. It's similar with Darkness And Frost and Time, but Time doesn't have bombastic aggressive parts like Sons Of Winter And Stars has.\n\nLand Of Snow And Sorrow reminds of Abandoned and Eternal Wait from Ensiferum's same titled album, because Jari contributed on those too. It's like combination of those songs with symphonic metal style, and with even better clean vocals. Refrains in Land Of Snow And Sorrow and Time sound extremely beautiful because of Jari's vocal colour and interpretation, while delivering so much passion with it. There's good riffage going in these 3 songs. Not one of them is much outstanding, but together they make great composition which creates, leads and follows the mood change of songs. Unfortunately guitar solos are very short and not impressive like on Wintersun album. Songs work well even without them, but they could have been present, last long due to the length of the songs, appear on many places, and be much more creative and interesting. Time has short guitar solo which just goes almost unnoticeable because of orchestrations, and lack of creativity. It's the way it is, songs are like heavy metal interpretation of classical compositions. They really go flawless, so you won't even notice how long they are actually while listening to them. The overall sound is maybe more magical than it really seems, specially when it is combined with Jari's good voice which makes the whole thing even more pleasant. It takes lots of listens to capture the essence of the whole album, because every single second is way too complex.\n\nThe reason why this album gets maximum rating is because there are 3 songs, and each of them is 5/5. Time factor, number of songs and overall length are excluded here in order to make review as objective as possible, no matter how long it took to complete this album. So, was 8 years worth this? It depends on the point of view. If you see it as new studio album, no matter how long it took to make it, then there's nothing significant to complain about here. If you want pure melodic death metal, or the Wintersun we all know, you still have Wintersun album. This one is done in symphonic metal style, fans of progressive metal can enjoy this too, but mainly it can please anyone who likes top-notch heavy metal music.\n\nGood sides of this release:\nComposition of songs is done extremely well, so you have a feel that songs are shorter than they really are, or you completely lose the sense of running time. They are done in symphonic metal style properly, although balance between guitars and orchestrations is a bit in favor to orchestrations. Songs reflect Jari's impression and point of view on time both musically and lyrically, and it almost looks like they're giving a dose of Finnish mentality, where the lands are cold, yet its people are worm-blooded, revealing cold burning flame within their hearts. Lots of solid riffs combined with clean guitars, and contrast of clean and harsh vocals perfectly picture that. Highly recommended for all metalheads.\n\nBad sides of this release:\nSongs lack guitar solos, but work well without them.\n\nHighlights:\nThe whole album.\n",
        "\nWintersun are renowned for the extensive production of their music - deep arrangements and layers of symphonic synths that create a massive, glossy sound that leaves an impression of the scale of the production. The guitar sound is chunky and mechanical, a percussive force of consistent rhythmic chugging that is polished to the point that it sounds synthetic - this doesn't have much to detract from as there aren't really any guitar riffs here, just underlying chugging for the vocals and synths. Overproduction is the main attraction here - the sound is massive but the music is boring, both quickly setting it apart. \n\nThe production and lengthy songs seem intent on making an epic, majestic piece, but it sounds only overbearing. Within the long songs themselves, there is no sense of dynamics, a constant deluge of synthesized symphonies that roar for a full 13+ minute song. The band has two settings: \"overload\" and \"interlude\", with two tracks of each and the finale alternating between both. The vocals, clean and growled, are always strained and overdone, forced and ill-fitted, over-the-hill like recent In Flames, not over-the-top like early Fates Warning. \n\nTime I is overcooked and overproduced to the point of being a spectacle, but there's not much substance here.\n",
        "\n\u201cTime, what is time?\u201d once asked Blind Guardian on their legendary Power Metal release \u201cSomewhere Far Beyond\u201d.\n\nSometimes, good things need some time to be done but this is not the case at all for Wintersun\u2019s new output that has been released eight years after their first strike following many complicated recording sessions, lots of strange announcements and wrongful promises and more and impatiently growing expectations from critics and fans. The difference between Guns 'n Roses' \u201cChinese Democracy\u201d and the new Wintersun record is that nobody really expected anything special coming from the one man project of Axl Rose but the record turned out to be quite decent without being a masterpiece while in the other case what has become a one man project of Jari M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4 was expected to be a masterpiece and is nothing but a big deception. After all the dramatic events over the last years, they could only fail. In the end, couldn't one have seen this coming?\n\n\u201cOnly time will tell.\u201d realized the British Heavy Metal flagship Iron Maiden on its dark \u201cA Matter Of Life And Death\u201d release.\n\nJari M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4 announced in fact that his new material was so complex that it needed new and revolutionary recordings procedures. This complexion led to a quite predictable result as the new overhyped record turns out to be completely overloaded. The guitar riffs feel lackluster and are buried under a too big amount of symphonic elements. Despite the length of the single tracks, they show no progression whatsoever. The calmer moments lack of emotions, the louder parts lack of energy and the productions is without dynamics.\n\n\u201cWe got a little time to make up our minds.\u201d stated the pioneer band of European Power Metal Helloween on the first part of their legendary \u201cKeeper Of The Seven Keys\u201d trilogy.\n\nDuring the whole process of that difficult birth that Jari M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4 gave to his new baby, he seems to have either worked too much on the tracks as they feel very complicated and inaccessible or not worked enough on them as they lack of consistency. The whole record has no catchy moments even though the same patterns are heavily repeated. Apart of the instrumentals, all songs vary from calm ambient or folk rock introductions to extreme symphonic metal or melodic death metal parts to calmer folk metal sections before the entire circle is repeated again and again and soon starts to get quite predictable. The few new elements such as the Japanese folk parts are overused in the genre and don\u2019t fit at all to the topic of ice and snow. That being sad, the song titles lack as much of originality as the tracks themselves do.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been here before, was it all just wasted time?\u201d questioned the German power metal band Edguy on their \u201cRocket Ride\u201d release.\n\nIn the end, there is nothing left to say but that this record collapses under its own pressure and feels directionless and overloaded. Maybe the sound would have been more mature and natural if the release would have taken less time. I can understand that the band finally wanted its material to be released but maybe they should have worked on something completely different and new as time went by. The plan to make two records out of one is a good commercial idea but artistically, it just stretches the whole chapter and people like me are not looking forward for the second part of this release at all. But maybe time will change things again and the band will actually revise its initial decision or work on their songs to make them sound more natural. As most of the reviews on here are surprisingly positive, they though surely don\u2019t feel the need to improve so that my expectations are very low for the upcoming release.\n\n\u201cTears of time \u2013 just an illusion.\u201d concluded the legendary German gothic metal band Crematory on their well entitled \u201cIllusions\u201d release.\n",
        "\nIt was almost inevitable that an album so delayed and so over-budget would end this way. Wintersun's highly anticipated sophomore album has been eight long years in the making, a time in which many other artists have split, reformed and released more quickly, but as the dust settles and the shock around the mere fact that \"Time I\" has actually been released subsides, we are left with extreme metal's \"Chinese Democracy\" - an album where the absence of any spontaneity whatsoever has resulted in an over-thought, over-blown, over-produced, disappointment.\n\nThe \"I\" in the title does indeed mean a \"Time II\" is soon to follow, but if that implies this is only a half-album then it begs the question why it is being released this way and fans are being asked to pay twice. The answer is no better if \"Time I\" is to be taken as a free-standing release of it's own because to have only 40 minutes of new material, approximately nine of which are atmospheric filler, is a very poor return for a band who released their stunning self-titled LP so long back. The intentions of Jari M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4 & co are evident from the outset of extravagant opener \"When Time Fades Away\", the album believing itself to be a film score rather than vehicle for high-quality metal riffs and in a trait which is becoming distinctly Finnish, whistles away with flickering lights, speaker-filling vastness and not a whole lot else in the belief that this 'epicness' is what will do. This slowly morphs into \"Sons of Winter and Stars\", a 13-minute track which I gather is being described as 'epic' by most - I would argue that while it moves through plenty of stages, very little of it is truly memorable nor on a par with the likes of \"Sleeping Stars\" or \"Starchild\" from the debut. In it M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4 displays some impassioned pipes but behind it are mediocre riffs displaced by an over-dependence on synth that will no doubt be pumped out in the live arena (for the effects of this just see Arkona, Turisas or Equilibrium live recently). Like the album at large, it is too sweet and synth-driven to hit home hard; the song is simply trying too hard to be 'epic'.\n\n\"Land of Snow and Sorrow\" is a bit more on-target with more decent vocal melodies but bogged down by over-reliance on that darn synth again. Leading into \"Darkness and Frost\", effectively another intro piece for the 12-minute closing title track which mixes acoustic strumming, techno synth and battle-ready drumming more effectively than it's earlier counterpart and which brings us to \"Time\". Notable for some truly horrible vocal howls straight out of production hell early on, it again produces much but little of it, save for the vocals and odd moments of guitar work, lingers in the memory. It too closes with two minutes of atmospheric outro, book-ending the album in long periods of substance-free dynamics.\n\nOverall, \"Time I\" can be said to possess none of the seismic riffs the debut did and has gone way too heavy on the futuristic keyboard effects and guitar tones playing boring riffs to elicit similar feelings of majesty and power. After so much time in production, too much has been attempted in the short span of this release with few moments of genuine greatness amongst them. Ultimately, if the band were not coming off the back of such a widely-loved record this one would not generate much love or admiration. Let's see where \"Time II\" goes off from here. \n\nOriginally written for www.Rockfreaks.net\n",
        "\nAs the dust settles, and the invariable weight of many an opinion ring resonantly in the rear-view mirror of my mind, I find a persistent, nagging curiosity towards exploring my own opinion of this phenomena entitled Time I. Both maligned and revered to astronomical proportions, what Jari Maenpaa\u2019s long anticipated return to recorded music seems to have garnered, in the end, is a universal sense of baffled incredulity. Indeed, 3 (admittedly strong) songs and 2 intros do not feel like whatever I myself was waiting for, and for all their splendorous trappings, I can\u2019t help but feel dissatisfaction. I understand that this is just the proposed half of Wintersun\u2019s epic return, but when the other half is not in hand, that sentiment rings hollow. After all, I have only what is in front of me to experience, and while there is certainly a plethora of quality and uniqueness to this pittance of epic bombast, it is still, at length, a pittance.\n\nTo begin, yes, I am among the many rabid supporters of the original self-titled Wintersun, and continue to hold it aloft as a king among princes in the melodic metal spheres. It is, in point of fact, one of my favorite records of all time, a sentiment many of you share, and an equal number of you seem to disdain more than a banquet of liver and AIDS. So, this heightened sense of expectation, bordering on pure, unrestrained exhilaration, at finally obtaining another window into Jari\u2019s fantastical musical universe, can be counted as prime influence for Time I coming up a bit short. Unlike many, however, I let the album sink in across both myriad repetitions and a suitably lengthy period of time, before setting my opinion in outraged or rabidly slobbering stone. Part of the trouble with critiquing music, I find, is that one tends to make up their mind hastily in order to put thoughts to pen, and then allow this cursory, surface perspective to forever dominate their thought process concerning the music in question. So, I took my time here, allowing my opinion to breathe and fluctuate, as the way I perceive something in an immediate sense is much different than the viewpoint gained by repeated exposures. And so I must, with finality, state that I do certainly like Time I, but with the caveat that it is also something of a disappointment, as it just does not feel complete.\n\nTo Jari and company\u2019s credit, the material here truly is majestic. Some sections more than others, given, but the plateau of quality is universally high, and in terms of pure musicality, the word \u2018masterpiece\u2019 isn\u2019t too far-fetched, particularly for Sons of Winter and Stars, which approaches a near-classical beauty for much of its almost 14 minute running time. The titular closer Time is close behind, and though I\u2019m not as intensely drawn to the bloated middle track, Land of Snow and Sorrow, it\u2019s certainly nothing painful. The general focus on Time I is far more synthetic (read: symphonic) here than we\u2019ve come to expect of the band, with seemingly limitless layers of interweaving keyboard lines making up the lion\u2019s share of any given melody. This is one of the reasons this supposedly took 8 years to develop, and it must be stated, it is indeed quite grand. The guitars do not do nearly as many cool tricks and solos as on the original record, but the compositional focus here is pretty different overall. There\u2019s not a lot of immediate hooking or punchy gratification, as there\u2019s a monstrously inflated sense of bombast that encompasses every corner of this audible world.\n\nIt\u2019s still Wintersun, of course, utilizing a potent and delicious mix of melodic blackened aggression and vibrant wintry aesthetics, somewhere between black and power metal in overall feeling, but more unique than that in delivery. When combined with Jari\u2019s strong growls and soulful warrior cleans, these forces work wonderfully together, and use the founding styles we all know so well to branch off into some very compelling new territory, experimenting with a lot of interlocking and flowing Japanese melodies, among others, strung together with a generally strong sense of narrative structure, lending true meaning to the term epic. While a record made up entirely of vast compositional vistas is not in and of itself a negative or positive, I felt that the album could have used some more diversity, perhaps in the form of some shorter, slicker numbers to balance it out. The lyrics and song titles are also interchangeable and rather meaningless, but the vague tropes of ice and snow and warriors and sorrow are just the level of cheese I expect out of the group, so I wouldn\u2019t call it so much an issue as an innate trapping. It\u2019s Wintersun, after all, in all its glory, and the things you either love or hate about them are generally magnified here.\n\nIn truth, Time I is quite conflicting for me, particularly as a critic. I really enjoy most all of it, and from that standpoint, it should achieve a very good score. However, I must jump back to a prevailing, rather pervasive issue with this album: it does not feel like an \u2018album\u2019. For all the marks Time gets for its musical achievement, I feel that Wintersun really shot themselves in the foot here, and missed the opportunity to make a better mark on history. I understand and sympathize with the concept of staying \u2018relevant\u2019 for longer, or wanting to fit a bit over 80 minutes into your work, but as history looks back upon this, I don\u2019t know if it will be seen as the bountiful epic it could have been. One amazing, complete album is far preferable to two strong, incomplete ones, and this is just icing on the cake of the problems caused by anticipation. To lay it bluntly: I have waited for this for eight years, and I simply do not feel satisfied with the result. It\u2019s simply not enough. The level of content, all of it undeniably great, is still paltry, in both its running time, and the innate overall pacing. 3 epic songs, though epic they may be, are still just 3 epic songs. All of them play upon the same emotions and compositional tricks, thus feeling more like a bloated EP than a vast, adventurous masterwork of a record. Wintersun\u2019s debut succeeded not only on the strength of its material, but on its incredible pacing, working its way towards the more grandiose material, and even then, it struck a good balance. Time I is all epic, all the time, which naturally lessens the impact this kind of material might have had if it fit into a more dynamic structural shell. For all the incredible quality of the individual tracks, Wintersun have hobbled themselves when it comes to presentation, which when it comes right down to it, is an incredibly important aspect of an album. \n\nI love Wintersun, and I desperately want to love Time I. In some ways, I do, as the sense of exhilaration and adventure is very profound at times, and songs are richly layered worlds that reveal more secrets with each listen. There\u2019s a beauty here that transcends metal and delves into classical, with distinct melodies dancing around each other, swirling into magnificent patterns that are very impressive and transfixing. Only 2 of the 3 songs really fully grab me, sure, but these two are of immeasurably immaculate quality. These fantastic qualities make the problems all the more debilitating, however. Imagine as though you\u2019ve been waiting for a bountiful feast for months, or years. You\u2019re absolutely starving, and when the food finally comes, it\u2019s unbelievably delicious, but they only allow you to fill your belly but a fraction of the way. Despite the inherently savory nature, you are left dissatisfied, and so it is with the new Wintersun. Making me wait 8 years for 3 songs, only 2 of which I really feel like repeating endlessly, is unbelievably irritating. Where did all the effort go, one is inclined to ask? Of an already succinct running time, does it really need such immense padding? Of the 40 minutes here, I\u2019d say only about 25 of it really feels absolutely essential. This is 2 incredible songs, after 8 years of effort. It\u2019s a very hard thing for me to compute, particularly as one of the Wintersun faithful. While making music is, above all, a very selfish thing (and if an artist creates not for the self, but for the opinion of others, he is not really an artist), is it wrong for a fan to expect more than this? I think not. \n\nWhile perhaps time will look favorably on, well, Time more so than I expect, at this juncture it is both questionable and lacking. It\u2019s a testament to just how incredible the existing content is that this will still receive a good score, but if Wintersun had just trimmed the fat a bit and released a full, well-rounded record, or even a double-album, I\u2019d reckon the vaguely empty feeling I have upon completing this journey would be a whole lot warmer. Perhaps it would have been best to wait for part 2, and rate them together, but as Wintersun have seen fit to release this as a full record, by itself, that is the standard by which it shall be judged, as will its successor. I really wanted to avoid this style of review, so over-utilized in critiquing this record, but at length, it\u2019s just so absolutely dominant in my thoughts. It feels, on a deep level, wrong to chastise a record for what it\u2019s not, rather than what it is, and based on expectations that I, perhaps unfairly, foisted upon it. Surely, in another universe, where Wintersun put this out as an EP between albums, it likely would score much higher, and it\u2019s oddly unsettling that circumstance colors my opinions so drastically. By all rights, I should judge this based solely on its own merits, and nothing else, but at length the dominant feeling I get from Time is one of incompletion, and so it cannot be ignored. The quality of music should theoretically never, ever be compromised by the method through which it is delivered, but Time has proven otherwise. If anything, I hope we can take this as a learning experience, as even though piecemeal content may seem like a good idea, it will inevitably corrupt the purity of the original artistic vision, and that is simply not a fair trade-off for any self-respecting artist. I still love you, Wintersun, and will still listen to sections of this miniscule album for ages to come, but please, please don\u2019t ever do anything like this again.\n\n-Left Hand of Dog\nhttp://reaperdivision.blogspot.com/\n",
        "\nAfter eight long and grueling years, the album that has been called the \u201cChinese Democracy of Extreme Metal\u201d is finally seeing the light of day. Marred by recording delays, writing blocks, equipment breakdowns, etc., Wintersun does not disappoint with \u201cTime I,\u201d an album comprised of the frostbitten and savvy mix of melodic death/symphonic/black/power/progressive/folk metal these Finnish juggernauts became known for with their previous release. Actually, it is quite inappropriate to have any sort of \u201cChinese Democracy\u201d reference to \u201cTime I,\u201d because this doesn\u2019t suck.\n\nThe album opens with \u201cWhen Time Fades Away,\u201d a grandiose and atmospheric instrumental exploring some of the exotic Japanese melodies that Jari Maenpaa, Wintersun\u2019s vocalist, guitarist and primary songwriter, mentioned would be present on the album. The introduction works right into the first \u201creal\u201d track, \u201cSons of Winter and Stars,\u201d a 13-minute epic that ascends the band into tantalizing, euphoric heights. The band can step from luscious melodic death metal with a progressive bent, into traditional Scandinavian folk territory, without missing a beat.\n\nMy only real complaint with \u201cTime I\u201d is that the symphonic elements, at times, overpower everything else that is going on. Wintersun\u2019s previous self-titled release was very prevalent with symphonics, but they added to the overall atmosphere without detracting from the vocals, guitars, etc. But that is just a minor flaw in an otherwise stellar release.\n\n\u201cTime I\u201d was well worth the eight-year wait. Unfortunately, I would say the previous Wintersun album beats out this one by just a hair, but \u201cTime I\u201d will make it on my top albums of 2012 that have been released thus far.\n\nKeep on the lookout for the second part of this album, \u201cTime II\u201d, in 2013.\n\n-Derrek Tipton\nOriginally posted here: http://www.bsudailynews.com/72hrs/this-charming-music-wintersun-and-ben-gibbard-deliver-decent-but-pleasurable-records-1.2784316\n",
        "\nSo yeah, we've waited 8 years. The only reason we haven't just forgotten about it in the waiting period is because we're constantly assaulted by fanboy news updates and articles like \"OMGZ WINTERZUN ALBUM GUN BE OUT THIS YEAR OMG OMG OMG,... oh wait, no its not\". As concert after concert is cancelled, anticipation grows, and even the cynical old metalheads are getting a little tingly in suspense, because they all are a little curious as to how the album is going to eventuate and how good the music is actually going to be. \n\nWelp, I think I speak for everybody when I say the excitement of anticipation far outweighs the quality of the album. Because yeah, it's shit.\n\nA few primary credits I can give are to such things as dynamism, productive quality, a few speckles of compositional integrity and guitar skills. Secondary credits I can give are to drumming skills, ability to make people wait for a really long time and having luscious, long hair well into their late 30's.\n\nHowever, the general overtone of this review was always going to be negative, so I'll get down to why this album is just a solid disappointment.\n\nFirst of all, there is TOO MUCH SHIT HAPPENING. All the time. There is just too much going on, too many layers, too many synths, too much volume and too much attack. Overhead layers of synth battle drums cascading over upper-level layers of choirs on top of hundreds of other layers of more synths, MIDI-tabbed harps and horns, seemingly endless layers of guitars and random splurges of vocal passages, with no break in between. It's an absolute assault on the senses, leaving no time to think about what is actually happening. By the time you realise you just heard Jari singing a melody, you're halfway through a bridge guitar solo while being pummelled by a thunderstorm of choir effects and orchestral synths. It's painfully overwhelming. Regardless of the 3 minutes per assault of introductory instrumentals, there seems to be no real journey with the music itself. I don't feel like I'm being led through any passage of time and winter sorrow (or some other cheesy essay variant of the words \"sorry\", \"winter\", \"stars\" and \"sun\") like I was promised. Instead, I was sleeve-tugged into a highschool students bathroom and presented a bloody tampon propped against the back of a urinal.\n\nOn a musical scale, the compositions are fairly sound. There are some pretty cool melodies, and the basic layout of the music is nothing short of awesome. This could still be a remaining factor is it wasn't being showered by a volley of fucking noise. \n\nAll this is in a sidestep of the obvious fact that, really, there are only 3 fucking songs on the whole album. Not just because it is part 1 of a 2-parter, but because the other 3 tracks are useless interludes and intros with even more garden sprinkler-style deliveries of diarrhea. Overlooking the fact that the album is mastered poorly (you can't listen to it on a stereo system, it's too random in audio dynamism), the instrumental areas are sub-par at best. There's nothing interesting about the intros, and no amount of layers of synths and MIDI sounds is going to magically change that fact. Taking a blob of semen and putting lots of glitter on it doesn't not make it a blob of semen. The sooner Jari realises that, the sooner he can run back into his hibernation studio and edit out the billions of layers he no doubt sticky-taped onto his second upcoming chapter of Time. \n\nContrary to what I believed in the past, Jari has actually revealed himself to be a sullen, arrogant idiot. Unbeknownst to him, what he achieved in his debut album \"Wintersun\" was actually musical fortitude and production of compositions that had merit and power. His achievement wasn't attributed to his audio engineering skills, yet he somehow tricked himself into thinking the success of his debut was based on obscure synths that he mixed into the background. Had he not tripped over his own saggy ballsack that slowly descended to old-man status in the time it took to mix and produce \"Time\", he would have stuck to making the compositions absolutely slay ass, rather than making it as \"epic\" and as atmospheric as possible. However, after 8 years of foreplay, what we got was just another flaccid entrance. Jari should know that you should at least take a viagra if you can't get it up, just like you can't trick metalheads who seek compositional integrity into thinking an analogous over-frosted cake with a poo in it isn't actually just a poo.\n\nI honestly feel like I've just basically been cheated. I hate to admit that yes I did spend the last 8 years of my life being a Wintersun fanboy, and yes I was and still am one of those people that herald their debut \"Wintersun\" as the pinnacle of musical perfection (for Melodic Death, that is, not all-inclusive), but now I just don't know. No band has ever held me in suspense for 8 years waiting for a follow-up, because let's face it, as we grow older, the rearing music we grow up to loses it's allure and we tend to mature.. But no, I stood stiff. I waited on edge for this fucking album to come out, even though I knew over-growing anticipation would outweigh the reward if I got carried away.\n\nWell, even if I hated Wintersun and only waited 5 minutes for the second album, I'd still be insulted.\n\nI probably could have saved a whole lot of typing and summed the whole album up with \"It was some good music with 500 hours worth of noise layered over it\", but I thought the backlash was so shocking that it merited an essay to dissect why it's so fucking offensive.\n\nI wrap up every review with \"all in all\", but this time I'll say \"nothing of worth\". \n\nI suggest anyone who's been waiting but still hasn't heard it (lol), just set the noose and start writing goodbye letters to your loved ones. This album is a carrot-speckled smear of shit, made only more unpleasant by the anticipation that preceded it.\n\n-Morbicae 2012\n",
        "\nUnless the time comes where post-apocalyptic music scholars are reading this and all other mention of the arduous wait associated with Wintersun's second album has been erased, I don't think it's necessary to offer a pre-amble about the ridiculous anticipation eight years of waiting have wreaked upon fans. Suffice to say, after so many delays, \"Time\" became rooted somewhere in between the status of legend and inside joke. Of course, with such expectations, people can be led to say rash things; initial media reports of \"Time I\" as one of the greatest albums of its generation appeared well-aware of the hype. I've given myself a couple of weeks now to digest it in all of its glory, and while the success of the yet-upcoming \"Time II\" will ultimately decide where this project rests in history, Wintersun have offered one of the most intense listening experiences of the year with this one. It certainly deserves the polarized opinions it has met, but there's depth and detail here to merit however long we waited for it. Love it or hate it, \"Time\" is finally here.\n\nThe first thing that really surprises on \"Time I\" is how much Wintersun have developed and changed as a musical outfit since the debut. Although the debut now passes me as one of the finest of its style, it was still rooted in a style and sound that would have been familiar to any fans of Jari's previous band, Ensiferum. Wintersun's direction on \"Time I\" may still be described with the same melodic, epic, progressive and symphonic adjectives as the debut, but everything is now larger than its ever been, to the point where it becomes difficult to fairly compare the two. Whereas \"Wintersun\" focused on the quality of its hooks and riffs, \"Time I\" is painted in terms of orchestration and atmosphere. Jari and his mates fashion a vast folk metal symphony of sorts, not in the traditional 'symphonic metal' sense, but there's not really another word that can aptly describe the complexity and subtle flourishes throughout the album. In news reports prior to the album's release, there was word that \"Time\" would feature hundreds of tracks at the same time, and though that was enough to raise a few eyebrows, it's readily evident in the music. Wintersun's music is still led largely by guitars, but \"Time I\" makes its mark by the amount of time and detail invested into the background. Cinematic orchestral flourishes match the intensity of burstfire guitar work, and frequent folk roundabouts give plenty of space for Jari to sport his arrangement skills. Even within an intrinsic 'background' element like the orchestrations, there are plenty of levels to dive into. Even to the attentive listener, \"Time I\" is an initially chaotic and harrowing experience. \n\nIn what I can only imagine would have been a mixer's nightmare from the ninth circle of Hell, \"Time I\" demands a listener's full attention. \"When Time Fades Away\" is a remarkably beautiful way to open the album, gradually adapting the listener to a steadily more intense and complex palette of orchestration. There's a definite East Asian motif here- certainly not something you would expect from Finland- although a minute into \"Sons of Winter and Stars\", the definitive Wintersun sound is at full blast. The riffs are not too fargone from what Jari was doing on the debut; they are fast, melodic, and open to techniques from many sub-genres of metal. Below these guitar riffs are what sounds like a thousand other parts, each grasping for their share of the mix. \"Land of Snow and Sorrow\" and the finale title track follow in the footsteps of \"Sons of Winter and Stars\", although each of these three are memorable in their own right. The fourth (and shortest) piece, \"Darkness and Frost\" is an interlude that also functions as the extended intro to the song \"Time\", it begins as an acoustic bridge and soon finds itself in the same sort of cinematic orchestration heard on the rest of the album.\"Sons...\" is arguably the best offering on \"Time I\", although the other two 'full' pieces are not far behind. \"Sons of Winter and Stars\" is a perfect manifest of where Wintersun are now as a creative act, throwing everything at the listener at full force, yet still finding time to offer a beautiful acoustic break towards the end.\n\nFor all of its cerebral orchestrations, the vocal melodies here are remarkable, and may be the most accessible thing on the record. Jari's black metal rasp is still used here, but there's a certain preference for clean singing here. Whether its for an epic chorus of pagan warriors or Jari's own lead voice, Wintersun's intense style manages to make room for these vocal arrangements. As may have been evident from the overblown production, Jari seems to be a bit of a Devin Townsend fan, and \"Land of Snow and Sorrow\" best illustrates this, occasionally featuring guitar and vocal elements that are virtually indistinguishable from Devy himself. It's a minor disappoint to hear a genius in his own right tracing the footsteps of another genius, but Jari's vocals have a great sound of their own. As a clean singer, he sounds much more confident here than he did on the debut. Thanks in large part due to the heavy symphonic focus here, his black metal rasps now sound less fitting, although it retains his distinctive snarl.\n\nIt's almost a granted truth by this point that Wintersun's musicianship is going to be through the roof. Besides Jari Maenpaa's not-inconsiderable skill with vocals and guitar, the rest of the musicians offer remarkable performances befitting a project of this magnitude. Special commendations go to drummer Kai Hahto, whose epic and aggressive technique backs up the metric tons of orchestration. Although the production is about as good as current technologies can allow for something of this density, some performances on this album can be difficult to hear. At its most symphonic, \"Time I\" pushes Kai's drum recording down to the level of the background, and bassist Jukka Koskinen can be even more difficult to hear, unless you know what to look for. There are times when I feel the debut's more concise and straightforward approach would have been better, but considering the scope of the instrumentation, it's no surprise that things get just a little murky on the production end. At only forty minutes, \"Time I\" is certainly shorter than most albums, although this slightly shorter-than-average length works to an advantage. Particularly on the first listen, it's quite a bit to take in, and it ends before the 'epic' atmosphere draws thin.\n\n\"Time\"s complexity is both its greatest strength and most inviting vulnerability. Depending on your tastes as a listener outside the context of Wintersun's debut, it's likely most who hear it will either love it or hate it. Although the depth here is virtually unsurpassed by any other album of its style, that complexity can feel overblown for its own sake. \"Time I\" achieves the feeling of an epic atmosphere like few albums have managed to do, but there's the sense that some of the overbearing density could have been done without. With that being said, repeated listens only make the album more and more satisfying of a trip. The initial experience is bound to be fairly disorienting, but there's so much to explore here. As I said towards the start of the review, it's going to be up to \"Time II\" to match the par that's been set, but there's no doubt that the sweat and blood that's evidently been spent investing in this project has paid off. Only coming years will tell if this has the same lasting appeal as its predecessor, but the music speaks for itself; Wintersun are now among the elites of their style... whatever their style might actually be.\n",
        "\nWintersun, for those of you who aren't already in the know, is a Finnish melodic extreme metal project started by Jari M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4 (formerly of Ensiferum) in 2003, with the first Wintersun album being released in 2004. This album was, and still is, one particularly prime cut of metal, defying the label of melodic death metal to incorporate elements of power, folk, neo-classical, black, and even progressive metal, all while having its own sound and songwriting qualities. After this, the band played some live tours, and went to record the next album, tenatively titled Time. However, during the process of the recording, everything that could possibly go wrong did. Production issues. Growing ambitions. Lineup changes. Jari's own battle with tuberculosis. Touring. So, after almost nine years of development, the first half of Wintersun's magnum opus-to-be, Time, was released to the public in October of 2012. So, after all the hype, not to mention the long-ass production time, is Time I an auditory masterpiece or the Duke Nukem Forever of metal?\n\nThe first thing to be noticed about the album is its rather short length of only 40 minutes. Obviously, from the name Time I, it implies that there'd be a Time II, and this album is effectively one half of a larger album. The second thing is the differences in sound. On this album, Jari utilizes a far more epic-sounding orchestra, complete with choir. The composition of the parts used in the song is, quite frankly, some of the best orchestral elements used in a metal album. It could be labeled as a real orchestra and choir, and it'd be completely believable. A lot of the melodies used in the album also have a bit of influence from Japanese folk music. There are only five tracks (plus a hidden track of the band members fooling around in the studio), two of which are instrumental interludes, so there are, in effect, only three real songs on the album. However, two of the songs are longer than 10 minutes, with the third approaching 9 minutes. It's a textbook example of quality over quantity, because every single song on this album is amazing. Yes, even the shorter interludes. When Time Fades Away ranks pretty damn high on my list of \"Most Epic Album Intros\", and it can certainly be admired of its own musicality, rather than just being a great intro. As noted before, Jari's use of the orchestral sounds throughout the album is so well-executed and detailed that it may very well be mistaken for a classical song. This fades into Sons of Winter and Stars, a 14-minute behemoth of a track that is also comprised of four sections, much like Starchild from the first Wintersun album. Jari is a hell of a songwriter, and it shows. The third section, in particular, shows how much his songwriting has evolved since the first album, with it being a soft, acoustic section that is extraordinarily well-executed for this type of album, and fits perfectly within the context of the song. The third track, Land of Snow and Sorrow, is essentially Death and the Healing, Part 2, but showcasing Jari's much-improved clean singing. His vocals do a stellar job of conveying the emotion of the surrounding music, which, after repeated listens, is among some of the best Wintersun songs composed thus far, IMO. After that, Darkness and Frost serves as a segue between the previous track and Time, the 11-minute title track of the not-quite-double-album. Darkness and Frost has an entrancing quality to it, with its backmasked acoustic background which builds into an epic orchestral arrangement, complete with what sounds like an army chanting in the background by its conclusion. Time rounds off the album, with another consistently excellent orchestration, a beautiful chorus melody, its shifting, almost progressive structure, and the only real guitar solo on the album. The song, and the album, ends on a musical cliffhanger for the next album, ending with a dark, almost ambient synth/orchestra piece that leaves the listener wanting more.\n\nThe album, as a whole, can be seen as both an album on its own, and half of a larger album. Some may be disappointed by the focus on the orchestral-qualities of the music and reduced amount of guitar heroics compared to the first album, but you can't argue with the results. Time I is, without a doubt, one of the best albums of the year, and that is really saying something considering both the lack of good metal albums this year and the quality of the music provided here. Again, quality over quantity. And once Time II releases (currently set to 2013, but god knows how many times it'll be delayed if this half is any indication), there'll be plenty of the latter as well. This album needs to be experienced by every self-proclaimed metalhead, or anyone with good taste in songwriting, or melody that also happens to have an epic-beyond-epic orchestral backing. Hell, even people without a liking for metal would probably love the interludes, at least. Simply put, the music is amazing, and once the second half releases, Time will most likely be Wintersun's magnum opus, and one of the best metal albums of the 21st century.\n\n[Adapted from the reviewer's own review at Fans on Fire Game Blog - http://fansonfire.blogspot.com/]\n",
        "\nThere is an open-ended character to the whole process of composition, in any craft, though perhaps mostly so in the musical medium. Styles are often determined not by little nuances in the instrumentation or implementation in the finished product, but by an overt divergence in audience priorities. Contrary to what some may suggest, the division that exists between pop music and underground music isn\u2019t necessarily a level of virtuosic talent on one side or the other, but in the level of intimacy that the man/people on stage share with their audience. It\u2019s a foregone conclusion that Jari M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4 has a relationship with his audience that is comparable to a tightly-knit cult, but unlike some other bands that out there, Wintersun has found itself developed to the point where it\u2019s compositional grandeur borders on the level of pomp and largess normally associated with the architecture of Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic cathedrals.\n\nThis analogy holds up with particular appropriateness when considering Jari\u2019s long-standing project \u201cTime\u201d, which has finally seen its public debut, at least in part. It carries with it the same level of colossal attention to detail that likely went into the construction of the massive structures of the medieval period both in western and eastern Europe, as well as the rocky production schedule and frequent adjustments that would have come with them too if the corruption of church politics during that era is likewise considered. All one need do is put the 4-minute plus overture \u201cWhen Time Fades Away\u201d on repetitive play and try to mentally deconstruct all of the melodic interplay and harmonic relations they all share, which culminate in a brilliant and highly unique convergence of European folk and Japanese atmospheric music. The sheer level of different ideas, all of them fit together into a cohesive whole while all being individually intelligible, reflect a heavy attention to detail that alone excuses the massive amount of time it took to get half of the story completed.\n\nOne could rightly question the logic of putting together an album that is built entirely out of long, drawn out epic compositions and brief instrumentals loaded with synthesized orchestrations and massive vocal overdubs, but this entire album functions on a level where logic has a far more limited role in relation to the emotions inspired by the starry winter nightscapes depicted both lyrically and musically. Both \u201cSons Of Winter And Stars\u201d and \u201cTime\u201d go through a series of contrasting sub-songs (the former is officially separated into 4 parts, while the latter functions this way in a more implicit sense) that feature Jari\u2019s signature songwriting as heard on the debut album, but in a more restrained way and alongside a much larger arrangement of keyboard sounds. At times it almost seems as though this band is veering a little too close to mimicking the orchestral bluster of Epica, but with a much more introspective lyrical approach, but Jari\u2019s virtuosic sensibilities manage to paint a picture equally as massive yet much more heroic and, ironically enough, fatalistic. This album isn\u2019t a call to action, but a call to dream, and urges for the most distant from reality-based visions possible.\n\nBut perhaps even more significant than any individual song or idea present in this grand conglomeration of sound is the significance it holds for Jari\u2019s insistence on creating long-winded terminology to describe his style. The constant cross-pollination of differing genres, including but not limited to: folk, melodic death, power, shred, symphonic and ambient metal all point to a rare form of eclecticism that manages to straddle all of these borders without losing itself and becoming inaccessible. Quite the contrary, this is among the most accessible albums out there with multiple songs clocking in at over 8 minutes, save an album or two in Pink Floyd\u2019s long past. Nothing on here comes across as being beyond the scope of a casual fan of melodic death metal, yet few could point to a single band as having crossed this many boundaries while still keeping the overall sound comfortably within the realm that the likes of Eternal Tears Of Sorrow and Kalmah tend to keep their audiences in.\n\nIt is a bit curious that in spite of the long durations, these songs actual listen as such in spite of themselves, rather than collapsing into a mess of abstract expressions. \u201cLand Of Snow And Sorrow\u201d actually goes even further still and runs contrary to the rabidly technical tendencies of Jari\u2019s work and listens like a down tempo, groove based modern metal anthem that has been dressed up with a massive deluge of keyboard sounds and vocals. It\u2019s recurring theme, which is repeated almost to the point of droning at the album\u2019s onset, is among the more memorable folksy themes to come out of the style since its rise to prominence in the later 90s, and even goes so far as to channel some of Jari\u2019s latent Ensiferum ideas at a few points. It is a bit different from anything Jari has written up to this point so it is understandable that some view it as filler, but it definitely grows on the listener after a few times through and proves to be the most distinctive song of the 5.\n\nThe biggest liability that this album has going for it, which is self-evident to anyone who has been following the band up until now, is the massive amount of hype and the split of this album into 2 much smaller, seemingly incomplete halves. Similar fates befell Judas Priest and Helloween in conjunction with one of their well-known 80s albums, resulting in 2 halves being successively released for the latter and a shorter single release with a bunch of left-over b-sides in the former\u2019s case, though neither suffered the 6 years of delays that this one did. The resulting feeling of incompleteness on here manifests itself as a simple half-cadence for the forgiving ear, but as a feeling of business-oriented profiteering to the less forgiving one. Ultimately the irony in all of this is that this has zero to do with the content found on here, and everything to do with the consequential cult character of Wintersun\u2019s audience and detractors, but it nevertheless will impact the album\u2019s reception, save for a few ambivalent types like myself who just like the music and couldn\u2019t care less for the peripheral things that go with it.\n\nThis is one of the best albums to come out in 2012, and when put together with its sequel (which we hopefully won\u2019t have to wait 3 more years for), may prove to be a step up from the debut, but by itself it \u201cTime I\u201d has a small lingering feeling of incompleteness that keeps it from being what it probably should have been had a few things happened differently. Perhaps at some future date there will be a limited edition where parts 1 & 2 will be merged into a finalized whole, but in the meantime, just ignore the hype and enjoy this album for what it is, a massive endeavor that manages to be catchy and intricate with hardly a clash between the two extremes it embodies.\n\nLater submitted to (www.metal-observer.com) on October 26, 2012.\n",
        "\nOh.... Oh, this hurts. Eight long, grueling years of agonizing waiting and the follow-up to the critcally acclaimed Wintersun debut is FINALLY here. Or at least, the first half of it anyway, because Jari Maenpaa thinks \"Time\" was just too complex for his fans to take in all at once (underestimating the fanbase's attention span, intelligence, and comprehension skills, already not off to a good start here...) so he churned out the equivalent of an EP to tide us over until Time II comes out in what I assume to be the year 2020. \n\nThis can't be it. This is a slap in the face to everyone who held their breath for any new material from the band. \"Sorry guys! The computers we have right now can't even handle HOW FUCKING COMPLEX AND EPIC THIS SHIT'S GONNA BE! THERE'S GONNA BE LIKE 200 TRACKS IN EACH SONG AND SHIT! JUST YOU WAIT, IT'S GONNA BE THE MOST EPIC, MAJESTIC, TECHNICAL, EPIC, MELODIC FUCKING ALBUM EVER CREATED! (see whut I did there? I made fun of the bullshit made-up genre that Jari created for his band, because the shit he makes just couldn't fit under melodic death metal, could it?) WE'RE WORKING ON IT, I PROMISE! \" And we fucking fell for it. \n\nBut being overhyped to shit isn't even this album's biggest problem. Nor is the meager length. They are huge contributing factors to why this fails so hard, but the biggest problem is that, of the 5 songs on here, two are intros, and only one actual song is worth your time. One. Fucking. Song. Eight years of waiting, and only one song on this album is worth a fuck. Don't get me wrong, that one song (the 13-and-a-half minute epic \"Sons of Winter and Stars\") is amazing, but it would have been better suited as a long-ass single, like Blind Guardian's \"And Then There Was Silence\" was. I would have gladly taken that to an incomplete fucking album. An incomplete BORING fucking album. How is it that this album somehow manages to be so short and yet feel so long at the same time? (and not in a good way...) The other two actual songs, \"Land of Snow and Sorrow\" (TWO songs with a title along the lines of \"Something of something and something else?\" REAL FUCKING CREATIVE, JARI) and \"Time\" plod on an on and go absolutely nowhere. \n\nOh, and did I mention that the keyboards and orchestrations ARE REALLY FUCKING LOUD? LIKE, ANNOYINGLY LOUD? AND NOT EVEN VERY WELL-ORGANIZED? And apart from \"Sons of Winter and Stars\" and the beginning of \"Time,\" there are NO death metal vocals on here? Look, I'm all for style changes between albums, but it kinda helps if it's done well. This is just boring symphonic metal with some slight folk-y influences that went the \"Unsung Heroes\" route of just tacking on death metal vocals to sound \"br00tal\" but not adding any emotion to it. On the first album, the death metal vox added a harshness to the wintry atmosphere. At times, on the debut, you could feel yourself stranded on a snowy terrain with the subzero wind passing right through you as you collapse to the ground and take your last dying breath, reflecting upon your unfulfilled life. Here... There's nothing like that. The clean vocals are just okay, but kind of lifeless. There are no really grabbing moments on this album at all. Sure, it sounds nice, but nothing blew me off my ass like many moments of the debut did, like the technical fireworks of the solo to \"Winter Madness,\" or the somber and emotional balladry of \"Death and the Healing.\" Instead of hitting you like a harsh snowfall on the debut, this album is more akin to the powdered fluff of a lukewarm winter day--- it just doesn't stick.\n\nI mean, nothing is inherently BAD about the album, but nothing is done particularly well, either. This doesn't sound like 8 years straight of songwriting and OCD-caliber perfectionism that Jari seems to have sought for. This album is Jari trying to be a composer and hardly knowing the first thing of classical structure or variety. Something tells me the Japanese-influenced intro and \"Sons...\" were absolute flukes of genius because nothing that comes after can even hope of living up to that glory. Nothing on here lives up to the promises. In the immortal words of Noah Antwiler (aka SpoonyOne), \"BETRAYAAAAAAAAAAAAAL!\" \n\nBut okay, let's say you weren't even aware Wintersun had just released Time I and knew nothing of the hype and promises. Could you go into this and draw enjoyment from it? Maybe a LITTLE more than I did, but I still can't see many people getting past the overly bombastic and pretentious and overproduced symphonics, the lack of substance, and the bloated artificial lengthening of the songs. I'm sorry, but aside from \"Sons Of Winter and Stars,\" this just isn't worth picking up. And for the love of all that is holy, WHERE IS \"WAY OF THE FIRE?!\"\n",
        "\nHere it is, people have been waiting for this for eight years. And let me be just go ahead and say that its well worth the wait. Now, I'll try not to be too effusive here. Wintersun is one of my favorite bands, but be assured that I am not biased with this review in any way. This is an effing masterpiece and deserves to be recognized as such. Now, the best way to go about reviewing this album is to be going by the track-by-track approach. Its such a short album anyway, and moreover, each one of its songs leads to the another, so I really cant see any other way of reviewing this. But first let me say something about the razor-sharp production values of this album. Jari Maenpaa claims to have mixed about two hundred tracks in each song, and frankly, I see no reason to doubt him. A hell lot of different things appear in every song, and to Jari's credit, he has arranged them masterfully. You get to hear bells chiming, operatic vocals, at least five folk instruments and of course, a wide array of guitar effects. This whole album is atmospheric as shit. Just by listening to those sounds make you feel like grabbing your shields and go about charging with your ax in the Finnish wilderness. In a lot of ways, it is reminiscent of the massively popular Elder Scrolls : Skyrim. I'm serious. The mixing of the track is impeccable too. How the hell did he manage to mix two hundred tracks in it, if it was not done to perfection then?\n\nFirst up is 'When Time Fades Away'. One of the finer instrumentals I've heard in about five years. This song sets the stage and gives a feel to the listener of what's about to come. This is just plain brilliant stuff. The same melody carries over to the next song 'Sons Of Winter And Stars'. Now, this is divided into four parts, so the songwriting is pretty complex. But that's expected of a band of this caliber. What's really impressive about this song is that it's a brilliant amalgamation of that impeccable atmospheric shit and solid riffing. A brilliant journey from start to finish. 'Land Of Snow And Sorrow' is the next one up. Its clearly made in the same vein as the first one. Epic and otherworldly tunes. A rarity in metal these days. The next one is 'Darkness And Frost' and this one is clearly inserted to build up the atmosphere for their title track 'Time'. But did I give the impression that this is a pushover? Hell no! this one is a brilliant song on its own right. That extremely infectious tune carries over to 'Time', and this is where the band gives its all. This is a perfect song in many ways. This song basically defines what this entire album is about. An ode to the rich culture of Scandinavia, and most particularly, of Vikings. Jari clearly loves them. Well...when you come to think of it, I do too. But that's beside the point. All you need to know is that this song is as epic as epic gets.\n\nI have three minor complaints with this album and hence the one percent deduction from a perfect hundred. Firstly, well, this one may be too trivial, but still...did you look at the names Jari gave to these songs? Made me cringe. The second and a slightly more important issue, is that in spite of Jari Maenpaa's enviable virtuosity on the guitar, he didn't give us any good, long solo. That's surprising. I'm sure we were all expecting another Winter Madness again. But he disappointed me on this one big time. There was a short, but very good solo on 'Time'. But it was too short. Just too short. Thirdly, the album is too small. Just forty minutes after waiting for eight years? Come on now! Moreover, there was no need to split his eight year's work into two. No one would have minded an eighty minute long album. I'm pretty sure we'd have all welcomed it. But it just seems to me Jari needs money, because I don't buy his excuse one bit. But the quality of the songs more than make up for the quantity, so I guess we can't really blame him too much. On a side note, even though the harsh vocals are the same after eight years (which is actually a very good thing, in case you were wondering), he really has seemed to improve his clean singing. I guess he realized just how good his baritone sounded and decided to make the best of it. Good for him. I'm all the more impressed.\n\nAll in all. This album is a pure masterpiece. Jari Maenpaa really understands the dynamics of a song and extorts every bit of brilliance out of it. This is literally masturbation to your ears. Just put on your headphones and crank up the volume. i guarantee you, you will be transported to another dimension, and for the next forty minutes, nothing else will matter. Yes, you will lose all track of 'Time' (good pun, don't you think, ah well...). This is basically the album I have been waiting for all my life, musically. I have explored everything, everything just to find myself this kind of a sound. It seems I finally got it. This is not Melo-Death. This is truly Epic Majestic Shit (or whatever he calls it). This has transcended the barriers of metal and folk, and has managed to fuse into something so unique that you remain mesmerized by its aural prowess even hours after this incredible journey. For this is no less than a journey, penned by a true poet. This is the new benchmark for Melodic Death Metal, and yet again, Jari Maenpaa is the man to beat.\n",
        "\nI feel like one of the few members of the metal community that wasn't blown away by Wintersun's debut. It felt like repetition taken to the extreme, and not much else. THIS, however, was actually a nice surprise. The monotony was taken out, and in its place is some pretty epic-sounding, bordering on power metal at times, music. The album itself contains much more complexity than its predecessor, and holds much more entertainment value. It's an album I can listen through more than once without sitting there asking myself, \"Why am I listening to the same riff over and over again? And while I find it annoying that the very mention of this release is enough to bring a steady stream of drool forth from the gaping mouths of Wintersun fanboys, this album is actually far more worthy of the hype surrounding it than the debut. Another major annoyance I have is that I can already picture the number of reviewers who will be gushing over this album simply because Wintersun made it. All the same, I was impressed with how far the band has come in their sound. \n\nCredit should definitely be given to Jari for the monumental song structures. Despite the length, the longest tracks on here don't rely on a single riff idea, repeatedly played in different ways, as a means to fill in time. Instead, the music manages to flow well while simultaneously steering clear of the nuisances from 2004. Jari mentioned that we would hear some Japanese-influenced melodies, and the opening track shows this style right from the get-go. While the instrumentation of the introductory song doesn't really show up much afterword, it's still a pleasant musical addition. Guitar-wise, Wintersun puts out some marvelous, melodic passages. Whereas, 2004 saw the debut being dragged down by its overly repetitive guitarwork, Time 1 shows us that Wintersun can use guitars to enhance the musical experience. \n\nVocally speaking, both clean and harsh vocals are done very well. Clean vocals can be rather hit-or-miss, but the ones used here are actually pleasant. They are the main reason that this album can feel a bit power metal-esque, combined with the speedy guitars. The symphonic and melodic death aspects are still present, and Jari's harsh tone doesn't become overbearing. \n\nIt took 8 years to make this album, and after listening to it, I can see why. Not only are the songs well-done, but the band also came across several setbacks in the process of the albums' creation. Some will complain that the album feels bloated, that the wait wasn't worth the result, or that it was merely a creation put forth in order to satisfy Jari's ego. Whatever complaints are put forth against this album, there is no denying that it is far superior to 2004's concoction in just about every conceivable way. I'm a little concerned if they can keep up the same level of quality for a second Time album, but Wintersun have proven that they have some surprises up their sleeve. Is this the best album of 2012? I don't think it is, but I do think it's one of the better releases of the year.\n",
        "\nI hate to burst the bubbles of the fanboys out there, but some of us have waited to hear this album for 8+ years and have seen numerous gaps of time without any news and cancelled shows with the promise that Jari was spending all of his time crafting the greatest thing he's ever done. We were promised almost unprecedented production values, rivaling what you'd normally hear from bands like Blind Guardian, with 200+ tracks on each of the songs. Time passed without any news of Time. One day, Jari says the album is finally finished, but will be released in 2 parts because Nuclear Blast says so. I immediately became incredulous, wondering why this album couldn't be a single release and expecting the worst because of the split. Surely something so epic in scale deserved to be presented to us as intended. However, I put this aside and figured that the music could speak for itself and should be good enough to carry two separate parts given how much time has gone into Time. All of these songs have got to be a lot better than some of the drudging boredom produced on the latter-half of the first album.\n\nAfter hopefully at least 1/10th of my lifetime has passed, this album finally graced my ears. The introduction track was beautiful, fulfilling the promise of Japanese stylized atmosphere Jari had mentioned back in 2004. This leads perfectly into one of the best songs Wintersun has ever released, if not the best. Sons Of Winter And Stars really does show a culmination of talent from the whole band and focuses on the dynamic sound and emotional journey which great symphonic background can bring to a band. This is far better than anything Nightwish or Rhapsody have been doing with their orchestrations as of late, which made me hopeful that this album might actually live up to the hype from its lengthy gestation period.\n\nThat hope died as soon as the next song played. Nowhere to be found is the inspired mixture of heaviness and orchestration featured on the previous track. Instead, we're regressing to a boredom not unlike the last few songs on the previous Wintersun record. This time it's worse, because the lack of real guitar riffs and solos leaves us to only focus on the sleepy, half-baked nature of the song. I began to feel crushed by the weight of mediocrity and the fact that the rest of the album was yet another intro/song combo of epic length only compounded my fears.\n\nThe album ends just as terribly as I began to fear in the middle. The boredom continues and nowhere do I hear anything nearly as well-written as should be expected from this release and the length of the title track becomes a chore to sit through unless your hanging from Jari's nutsack. There is finally a solo in this song, but it's not enough to save it from being quite possibly the most mediocre thing Wintersun has ever produced... and I daresay one of the worst things I've ever heard Jari be a part of musically.\n\nOverall, this is a very disappointing album. As I said, I approached this under the assumption that splitting Time into two halves shouldn't have any effect on whether the music is good or not. What we get is one amazing intro/song and then 3 more tracks which feel nowhere near as inspired and quite frankly are insultingly half-assed when compared to the 8 years given to writing and recording this material. The actual sound of the recording isn't terrible. The mix is good for the symphonic elements, but the guitars are slightly buried and the bass is difficult to discern among it all. The drumming is sufficient, though never anything more than stock beats to support the overall composition. Again, these things are disappointing given the length of time dedicated to this release, but at least it doesn't sound like it was recorded in Jari's bedroom.\n\nI am eager to hear what it is in store for Time II, as Jari has promised more riffs and solos on the second half, but I really can't expect a lot given what I've heard so far on this release. This is not the magnum opus we've all waited so long to hear. It's not even half of a magnum opus. This is a vast disappointment and anybody who disagrees is fooling themselves. Go back and listen to the first album. It's a much better use of your time.\n",
        "\nI'm just back from what seemed like a rejuvenating journey that apparated me to a time where the winter ruled our earth. Long story short, this is the best way I could explain my voyage of listening to the Finnish metallers' much awaited new album, \"Time I\". This album is Wintersun's second full-length album, originally scheduled for release in November, 2006 but then delayed six whole years because of its alleged \"complexity\" and it took Jari eight whole years to finally slam this masterpiece on the table. Needless to say, that Jari doesn\u2019t hesitate one bit, to experiment in this album and oh boy, doesn\u2019t he succeed!\n\nThe album contains five tracks with the second track having four subdivisions. It starts off on a high note, excelling in setting your hopes up sky high for the rest of the record. \u201cWhen Time Fades Away\u201d begins with a soothing, and endearing symphonic intro and delivers a great atmospheric feel to the listener. It makes you feel like the band is playing amidst a series of waterfalls and you\u2019re among them. Just when that symphonic intro seems to nurture your ears, a drum roll kicks in with a theatric feel to it. The song then gets a tad bit heavier just to descend back to its tranquil feel. Yet again, it\u2019s like you\u2019re lost in the Finnish woods, like in a movie. Just, phenomenal.\n\nThe second track, \u201cSons of Winters and Stars\u201d is basically divided into 4 parts, \u201cRain Of Stars\u201d, \u201cSurrounded By Darkness\u201d, \u201cJourney Inside A Dream\u201d and \u201cSons Of Winter And Stars\u201d. The song starts off with yet another symphonic intro that is knocked off with some sudden in-your-face mix of symphony, melodic death metal, and haunting theatrics. Like Jari said, each song has about 200 tracks in itself! Now 200 might just be a bit too much but its close enough! The song faces another transition into a rising riff, that riff when you know that something big is coming, and just then some pure Wintersun material is blasted in your face. Its like you\u2019re running into a brutal blizzard and the riffage feels like the strong, frozen wind is blowing against you. Jari impresses you with some very commendable harsh vocals. About half way through the song, it descends into an acoustic passage with some magnificent clean vocals by Jari, with a symphonic fill here and there. As expected, it rises back to the heavier side of the song and the immensely connective atmosphere created by the band makes you want to sing along to, \"We are the sons of winter and stars! We've come from far beyond time!\". This song is quite different from the predecessor as it makes you feel like you're in a Finnish war in the freezing winter! Soon enough, some incredible lead by Jari and Teemu hits your ears, something which most of us would be waiting for, moreover, but it remains just a flash in the pan. Nevertheless, the song ends on a high note with a totally brutal assault of an amalgamation of extreme metal, symphony and melodic death, something the band is known for.\n\nThe third track, \"Land Of Snow And Sorrow\" begins with a slow rising riff that is greeted with some symphony and then the mighty drums kick in. Jari's new found harsh, clean vocals are blended well with some operatic vocals in the background. This song too, has the tempo changing suddenly and the song drifts away swiftly into a partially acoustic passage, midway through the song.\n\nThe fourth song, \"Darkness And Frost\" is more like a bridge to the album. Like a warm, heavenly massage you get after all day's work. It is a small snippet with some amazingly intricate acoustic guitaring. The drums kick in, but moderately enough to balance out things equally. Its a perfect song for a victory celebration, like after a war. You might just think that this one deserves to treat you in the end, rather than in the middle.\n\nThe fifth and the last track of this 40-minute escapade from reality is \"Time I\". The song begins with a melodic riff, delicately carved to fit into the socket of some beautiful symphony. It gets heavier with the benchmark Jari scream which later on free falls into some bloody impressive cleans. The song then progresses to catapult itself to the heavy side with fast drum rolls, double kicks, and swift piano parts. It will surely make you stand up and scream along to, \"Time fades away!\". Halfway through the song, a much awaited guitar solo sets in and its short but long enough to amaze you. The guitar solo turns to its alter-ego, to pleasure you with a breezy and fast piano solo. The song drops into silence for a few seconds in the end, just to treat you with some peaceful, serene, Finnish folk tunes.\n\nAs you must have observed, this album was quite literally a roller-coaster ride that has covered all the aspects required in a masterpiece. From the slow, pleasant parts to the fast, frost-bitten brutality, the album has covered it all! It is so multi-genred that you simply cannot narrow this record down to one genre. The only setback would be lack of emphasis on bass, because the rest of the members seem to have unanimously put in effort, Jari Maenpaa obviously being the stand out performer. Apart from the well above exceptional instrumentals, it was pretty amusing to see Jari come out and sing cleans, be it harsh or operatic! What a talented musician!\n\nIf you're one of those people who always wanted to visit Finland, don't worry, because Time I is here to take you on a magical trip to yonder land! This obviously doesn't mean that the rest of them shouldn't listen to it though, because you'll be missing out on one hell of a ride! This album must be heard by the world, not just us metalheads. That is the magnitude of this album.\n\nHauskaa matkaa hevarit!\n\nOriginally written for Metal Wani : http://www.metalwani.com/2012/10/review-wintersun-time-i.html\n\nPosted by Wintersun - http://www.facebook.com/wintersun/posts/376913132387140?comment_id=2709428\n",
        "\n\"When time fades away [...] I'll never feel the same.\"\n\nYeah, that sounds about right.\n\nDo I even need to introduce anybody to Wintersun? I'm sure all of you know who Wintersun is by now. The debut album is one of the most preposterously, disgustingly over-hyped albums of all time. I can't go anywhere without hearing that album's praises, then subsequently being ridiculed and ostracized when I calmly and politely ask these fellows what kind of ass worm is in their brains to make them think Wintersun is the pinnacle, epitome, or glorious standard all albums should be held by as it bafflingly is so consistently considered.\n\nAs such, Time I is most likely the most anticipated release of this year. Most of you have probably been closely following every rumor about this album, losing sleep over it, and cutting your wrists every time the release date was pushed back. How many times was it pushed back, anyway? Three times? Five times? A dozen times? I lost track ages ago. I'm guessing you guys have a lot of unfortunate scars.\n\nAnd so, here it is. The album everybody waited eight years for is among us. And damn, this thing is fucking hilarious. Fans waited eight years for an album that is essentially only three songs long. Oh yeah, and while Wintersun was full on melodic death/power at super speed, Time I abandons most of that in favor of a hugely bombastic, symphonic sound at a much calmer tempo. So fans also waited eight long years for an album that is of a significantly different style.\n\nHahahaha. Hahahahahahahaha! M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4 may very well be metal's greatest troll. Either that, or he's really fucking ignorant. Did he seriously expect to pull this out of his ass after a damned eight year wait without his hardcore fan base usurping the Vikernes throne and actively searching down his house to set it on fire? I feel I should also mention fans have waited those eight years for only half an album, but I get the feeling the label is using this as a sales tactic due to the power behind Wintersun's name, thus making them more responsible for the double album idea than M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4 and co.\n\nRegardless, the fact remains: fans get an idea of what they want in their heads, then they get really pissed off when it's anything remotely different - and this album is definitely different. With this as given knowledge, it is here I point out that I actually like this album. That's right, it's better than that clusterfuck winter-on-crack debut. COME AT ME, BROS!\n\nOne of the things that really put me off about Wintersun was how stupidly chaotic it is (rather ironic, given the fact that \"Beyond the Dark Sun\" and \"Winter Madness\" are my favorite tracks on the record). Winter is the season for doom and dirge. Everybody knows this. The Wintersun debut, however, rarely keeps in line with its somber roots - instead, every time the album seems like it's meant to be thick and dramatic, Jari said to himself, \"THROW IT INTO OVERDRIVE!\" Combine that with the utterly random pacing of the album and the end result is a giant mess.\n\nThough Time I certainly contains many traces of the superspeed melodeathpower that made up the debut, it seems that, in his overdramatic journey up his own pompous ass, he almost entirely forgot about the raw intensity that (for some Godforsaken reason) everybody fell in love with in the first album. Instead of being raw and chaotic, Time I takes the journey all albums take when the songwriter consumes a timespan equivalent to the average lifespan of a child with Progeria to meticulously perfect every second of his work: it's overbloated, bombastic, and polished shinier than Rarity's diamonds. It retains its predecessor's spaciness, yet replaces the fury with a massively overdone, pretentious, neverending symphonic assault.\n\nIs this a bad thing? Well, if you're one of the people who was waiting for Wintersun II, probably. As a random passerby metalhead simply curious on what the ass an album that took eight damned years to create would sound like, I do not mind at all. From the opening strains of \"When Time Fades Away\" I knew this would be something I'd seriously enjoy. I recall reading in years passed Jari was working on Japanese harmonies for Time, and this beautiful opener guarantees this promise. \"When Time Fades Away\" soothes the listener with gorgeous oriental folk melodies that really do sound like they were polished for a whopping eight years. Both the Japanese harmonies and polished sound carry on into the first of the real three tracks, \"Sons of Winter and Stars\" - and not just into that, but into the entire album. The huge Japanese melodies and constant oriental vibe never departs. It brings to mind Whispered's 2010 debut masterpiece Thousand Swords, though Time I is far more symphonic and significantly less melodic death. Really, this oriental folk thing is just excellent and more bands need to do it. If anything throws this album into the \"fuck yeah\" category, its those Japanese melodies. They unite seamlessly with all the overbloated symphonies and make this album seem bigger than it actually is. Have I mentioned how pretentious this thing is yet?\n\nUnfortunately, the fact that this album sounds like it was polished for a whopping eight years is its most glaring drawback. Rather than spending those eight years coming up with more ideas and expanding the songs with more melodies, riffs, whatever, it sounds more like Jari spent a year or two actually writing the music then spent the remaining six or seven years just polishing and tweaking every note to flawlessness. Given when this album was supposed to be released, I wouldn't be surprised if that is exactly what happened. To sum it up, this album reminds me of Blind Guardian's A Night at the Opera or, in a far more recent example, Nightwish's Imaginaerum in terms of scope (and I can certainly see similarities in vision as well). However, try as though it might, it fails at captivating an epic, grandiose nature the way those two albums do. As such, it often doesn't live up to its ultimate potential. As example, \"Land of Snow and Sorrow\" (seriously, Jari, you need to get your head out of the snow pits and come up with more creative names than this) should be huge, bombastic, and powerful. Though it offers its share of sexy leads, entrancing symphonies, and never relinquishes its chilling atmosphere, it instead plods along, stretched thin through its own atmosphere. Put simply, these tracks are huge musical journeys, but they don't take us to fascinating, exciting places as often as they should be.\n\nOn the plus side, all the time spent shining this thing to perfection has resulted in a damn Wintersun musical. You can take that however you want, but I love it. Time I is truly flawless in terms of flow, redeeming the jumbled \"let's throw random shit anywhere and everywhere\" of the debut. No note feels out of place, because M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4 clearly spent a good six years making damn well sure every idea fit in perfectly. Each of the main three tracks is huge and progressive. They're also overwhelming in the amount of layers to each track - there's constantly a plethora of different elements twisting together, yet never seeming out of place or unwelcome. One can repeatedly dig further into each song and discover more intricacies to the music, reminding yet again that Jari spent nigh 1/4 of his life perfecting this album. \"Sons of Winter and Stars\" is probably the best example. The track is huge, thick, and goes through more moods than your mother during PMS; it definitely manages to succeed at them all. Hell, every track even segues together perfectly, giving the illusion of one, long song if you're not paying attention. There is also clearly some kind of underlying concept going on here, though I have no idea what it is (probably some story about some guys visiting an icy world of stars and dying in darkness and sorrow, because that's what all Wintersun songs are about, right???) I'd be more inclined to carry the concept unto its musical being rather than its lyrical being, but in both regards this album seems to be its own cosmic world. It is a world with endless, wintry landscapes to the edge of the horizon - on display are infinite wonders of frigid beauty, each beauty seamlessly woven into a tapestry of frozen time. Time I is timeless in its vision. It's just, well... it's fucking pretentious, that's what it is!\n\nSo, the bottom line here: Time I is a massively overdone, pretentious, neverending symphonic assault! However, as pretentious as it is, as overbloated as it is, as beautiful, atmospheric, and powerful as it is, it doesn't reach its full potential as often as you'd expect out of an album in the workshop for eight years. But hey, simply releasing this proves Jari is a giant Finnish troll, so maybe this is all a clever scheme to really freak out the Wintersun fans. Once everyone is alienated, he releases the true masterpiece next year. Yeah, yeah! And if not, well... Time will fade away. And though some may lose more sleep and cut more wrists in anguish of the eight year wait for an album they never wanted, I will revel in the fact the wintry light radiating brilliantly from the dimension of Time magnificently eclipses the dim, flickering glimmer of the chaotic dwarf planet debut.\n",
        "\nI love a good cup of dark roast black coffee, something strong simple and unceremonious to get me ready for the day. It isn't that I\u2019m opposed to the idea of adding cream and sugar; at times it adds to the overall presentation and enjoyment of my beverage, but more often than not it simply masks the bitter, natural flavor of coffee. When people put cream and sugar in coffee, it\u2019s typically because they feel that their coffee will taste like shit if they don\u2019t; they are correct because it is usually shitty coffee. Not everyone who drinks coffee actually enjoys coffee, there are some latte drinkers who would rather indulge in sugar, cream, milk and whipping cream to the extent that the coffee itself becomes an afterthought; rather than the main attraction. \n\nExtreme metal is a lot like coffee; it has a strong bitter flavor that many people feel the need to sweeten with sugary symphonic arrangements and overly melodic elements. Keep in mind that this isn't necessarily a bad thing. Summoning, for example manage to mix up a latte that\u2019s barely recognizable as metal, yet I can drink it daily without feeling bloated or unsatisfied. The best symphonic metal bands (in my opinion) are the ones that rely on strong riff writing and song arrangements. The symphonic elements in these bands are typically subdued and only used when necessary to add to musical climaxes or other areas where more texture or emotion is required. There are other symphonic metal bands that don\u2019t even bother writing riffs, the guitar simply chugs 3 cords in the background (in order to satisfy the pretense of being a metal band) while the symphonic elements are left to carry the music. \n\nWintersun are not the type of project that palm mutes 3 notes and calls it riffing. Jari puts time and effort into the majority of riffs he writes and it made the first Wintersun album a success. This album also has genuine riffs but they are buried deep in the mix and don\u2019t come through. This is not a production problem; this is an attitude problem. Jari seems to feel as if a metal album isn't enough, he needs to add extra textures everywhere and saturate everything to the point of absurdity and beyond. Jari doesn't want the listener to be impressed, he wants the listener to be blown away! It doesn't work because it doesn't bring anything new to the table. After listening to the first Ensiferum and Wintersun albums, you have heard every idea that Jari ever had. Sorry kids, drenching old ideas in superfluous, symphonic bullshit is not the equivalent of coming up with new ideas. (My favorite part is when he starts playing \u201cLittle Dreamer\u201d half way through \u201cLand of Snow and Sorrow.\u201d) \n\nWintersun have treated us with the musical equivalent of a venti caramel macchiato with an extra vanilla flavor shot, caramel syrup, whip and only a half shot of espresso. As soon as you take the first sip you are bombarded with delicious flavors and marvel at the effort put into the preparation of your drink, but after you've finally made it through the first inch of whipping cream and syrup you start to ask yourself: \u201cwhere the fuck is my coffee?\u201d Yeah sure, there\u2019s harsh vocals and double kicking, with the same triggered drum sound on literally every nuclear blast release but who cares.\n\nThe first song is like a think mound of sickeningly sweet whipping cream and the outro at the end of the last song is like the thick clump of sugar and syrup that always settles to the bottom of the cup. I don\u2019t want you do get the idea that this album is sloppy or poorly put together. Actually, it suffers from the opposite problem. This album is over produced, over saturated, overblown and under whelming. The previous Wintersun album also had its fair share of problems. To me, the first Wintersun album felt like the entire project was nothing more than a vehicle for Jari to show off how fast he could sweep pick, but was saved by the shorter, catchier songs like \u201cWinter Madness\u201d and \u201cBeyond the Dark Sun.\u201d The only short songs on this release are totally useless intros that fail at creating any atmosphere whatsoever. If you take the 2 and a half minutes of useless crap at the end of the last song and add it to the two useless intros you get a total of 9 minutes of stupid intro. For those of you who are a bit slow with math, that is 22.5% of the album. That is a lot of sugar for one cup of coffee.\n\nI am glad that there are no obnoxious, ostentatious and self serving guitar solos on this album, but I am afraid that Jari traded them in for something much worse. One is begged to ask, why are the songs so long? Does the song \u201cSons of Winter and Stars\u201d warrant being 13 minutes? Of course not! If the song was between 6 and 8 minutes it would probably be my favorite Wintersun song, it is very unfortunate. I\u2019m afraid that Time 2 is probably going to be even more overblown, pretentious and ultimately unsatisfying than Time 1, but hopefully Jari will acknowledge his potential and release the jaw dropping album I know he is capable of writing. Until then I am going to sit back and enjoy my coffee.\n\nOriginally written for abloodredpath.blogspot.com\n",
        "\nWintersun is a band that, in a way, didn't actually need to release another album past their first one. It belongs to this small number of bands/musicians that wrote a magnum opus, a 9th symphony, straight from the beginning. Jari could have rejoined Ensiferum or made other, easier (and faster!) projects that would have sustained him as a professional musician, leaving this album as a single offering of excellence and a producer of eternal fame. Instead, he's been struggling for over than 6 years to come with the sophomore album, striving to widen and perfect even further his vision; for that alone, he is a hero of some kind. There is no epitome of perfection in the world and even \"Wintersun\" has pretty obvious faults and weaknesses that might make one think \"what if..?\" However, it is a rational \"what if\" in the aftermath of a total spiritual success. With great and complex music such as Wintersun's, the threads of magic are not clearly discernible and one playing with them risks a lot. For every solution two other problems might occur, for every \"fault\" that is fixed an emotion might be subdued. Jari seems to have understood that. Time, coupled with patience is certainly the greatest advisor. \n\n\"Time I\" is an album that expands in many directions beginning from the debut, however the question is; does it stem from a similarly vibrant source of inspiration? Surprisingly, it also features even more obvious faults than the first one on the production side, that sometimes detract from the listening experience. Jari has took up the production and mixing himself in this record, a decision I applaud as it is the best option for composers of complex and elaborate music, as its nuances can hardly be understood by anyone except the composer himself. However, some of his decisions are peculiar (and they certainly are pure artistic decisions, he sure had all the Time in the world not to miss anything). While I'm theoretically very positive to albums that sport a wide dynamic range, \"Time I\" features severe loudness fluctuation that makes me either jump from my chair or reach for the volume control. I imagine that, in the course of increasing orchestral influence, Jari wanted to give the dynamics of a symphonic orchestra to his heavy metal band. The problem is that it's not always done correctly, or that it is overdone, it seems as the instruments are squashed of their natural dynamics typically for a modern metal production and then programmed to the desirable; it feels unnatural at times, like you can see Jari's hand moving the faders. Also, the drums are unexpectedly buried in the mix and the bass is often untamed (perhaps unlike the majority of Wintersun fanbase, I don't see so many Hollywood blockbusters as to enjoy hearing an earthquake in the middle of a song). Negatives aside, the production is still much more powerful, atmospheric and expansive than \"Wintersun\", largely because of the bigger prominence of various layers of synths and effects. It is actually a very bold and original vision that, if perfected in Time part II, will be something totally unique to the metal world, in which the orchestra had been always subdued in the mix and conservatively used as another synth layer. For \"I\" though, I wish Jari had a professional mixing assistant (or an opinionated mastering engineer) in his side that would trim off some of the excesses. \n\nLet's go at last to the music. There are no great stylistic changes comparing to the debut, to put it bluntly and non-poetically, it seems like an orchestral, pimped-out-in-every-aspect version of it. This might sound bad, but in reality it is what everybody probably expected and wanted, and actually is an amazing feat of courage and inspiration. The album's intro, \"When Time Fades Away\" is a foray into the epic midi territory that is on the same level with the music of some of the best game composers out there (and perhaps there's even an influence from the Japanese ones). The first real song, \"Sons of Winter and Sons\" is almost like Wintersun passed through the bombast of the \"300\" soundtrack or these \"Two Steps In Hell\" guys. These horns are sure damn loud, but the essence of Wintersun's music does not lie there. It is in their glacial, pure as childlike wonder sense of melody and harmony, in its frantic and inspired progressions, in these amazing climaxes of emotion. Is any one these here?\n\nAfter 2-3 listenings, the mind begins to recover from the shock caused by all the bombast and begins to notice all the small details, the second and third voices/melodic lines, being able to really go along with the song as an active listener. The answer is: YES. \"Sons of Winter and Sun\" is a triumph for the band and will always go along \"Starchild\", \"Winter Madness\" and I dare yet say, \"Way of The Fire\" as one of their greatest magic spells. The level of complexity and density has risen, as there is no single guitar line without its counterpoint, while in the background there lies always an orchestral arrangement playing, a traditional Japanese flute, harps, female voices, choirs. The themes of the album hardly are presented with repetition as in typical heavy metal fashion, but are adorned with constant variation, leading into each other almost in enthusiastic hastiness, before one has a chance to fully absorb them (thanks Zeus for the replay button) - as the melodic vocals of Jari are this time more prominent, together with the virtual orchestra they take many melodic lines away from the guitars, so it makes sense to talk about themes rather than riffs in this album. \"Son...\u201d alternates between destructive anger, angst, beauty, mystery, powerful determination, awe, enlightenment. It goes directly to being one of the greatest heavy metal songs of history for me.\n\nI never was a huge fan of the slow Wintersun songs, which says a lot about how much I love the fast ones. It perhaps has to do with Jari's background as a shredder, or that he simply needs more space to fit in his long evolving melodies, but to me, they are in the same level with Ensiferum's best songs, which is to say \"just good\" (Moonsorrow are the masters of slow and epic Finnish folkish metal, just so that you know). So when \"Land of Snow and Sorrow\" begins, my expectations are not the highest. It does not shatter them completely, but it manages to hold the album in a quality level. Here, the orchestral instrumentation backs off a bit and stays in the background as in the first album. Like the other slow songs in \"Wintersun\", it is almost mono-thematic and with the exception of the expected, but adventurous middle section (which reminded me a bit of Devin Townsend in the end, was curious to see if this influence would finally materialize) it is just nice to listen to. Even though I like the basic melody, one cannot expect to keep high interest by elaborating on it for so long, except if this one is Beethoven, say. Moderation isn't Jari's strongest point as a composer; however he's fighting it, understanding the need for a break in the intensity and pace of the album. In an eight-song album, this one wouldn't be a problem, but in this shortened to half 40-minute edition of Time, I feel I would have welcomed something stronger.\n\n\"Darkness and Frost\" is a short, two-minute introduction to the brilliant basic melody of \"Time\" and should have been left as one track altogether, meaning I have the feeling they were divided rather than intended as separate tracks from the beginning (hey guys, some of my favorite metal albums are comprised of four tracks!) So, \"Time\", here we go; the same-titled track of the original intended album, assumably the stronger or among the 2-3 strongest tracks of both Time I & II, it is hereupon that you are judged (at least until the second offering). I'll cut the drama short, there is enough in the album; it's the second fucking triumph of the album. This song features some irritating loudness fluctuation as well so I had to put headphones in quite loud volume at this point, which seems to be the correct way to listen to this album (I can't say about monitors as I can't put them as high in my apartment, but oh Jari, I sure hope you didn't mix this way).\n\nGet ready to be faced with endless layers of melody here, I am truly at a loss to describe the depth of emotion and the immensity presented. I will say that this song is perhaps his culmination as a composer as of yet. The song's also comprised of a small number of basic themes, but like the great classical composers, his treatment of them via massive orchestration and delicate counterpointing so masterful that one is swept by the flow, forgetting all about themes of structures or where exactly are we in the song, how long until it finishes and so on, living only in the Magical Now. Is this Wintersun's treatment against Time, to extinguish it, at least for the duration of this song? \"Time fades away - you'll never be the same\" - it seems like an obvious statement, probably juvenile in the context of the lyric sheet of a music album, at least for the \"mature\" or \"tasteful\" listeners, but Jari with his dramatic treatment returns to it the importance it deserves. Metal music doesn't need to use long words or Wittgenstein references in order to be philosophical, it just needs to address these eternal, simple questions with the immensity, conviction and depth that is needed for the listener to confront them and make them his/her own. \"Time\", the song, doesn't even need to burst into blastbeats or maniacal chord progressions to enchant us, the purity of its melodies, its glorious somberness suffices to lift up our souls into the skies. \n\nProbably Jari's greatest victory against time is that his music will be eternal, surely to be heard in the ages to come. Gustav Mahler has said \"Nothing will stand the passing of time, except this which has been perfected upon in every detail\". I don't know if this already has been the motto of Jari, but he sure works like he's known it forever. On the other hand, \"Time I\" is not entirely satisfying to listener, as it leaves one dry, ending at the moment the enthusiasm reaches its greatest peak. It doesn't really feel like an album, with its three songs and one intro and personally I will be ripping both albums and putting them in the same folder when \"II\" is hopefully released. I'm certain it will take about a year until I can really follow along to reach to the end without having it melt my brain, but until then it will at least feel better conceptually. Therefore, any attempt to make a comparison between the two albums should wait until then. It's also interesting to note that, for me at least, the essence of \"Wintersun\" lies in basically just four songs that transcend to reach the plane of divinity; with \"Time I\" I believe we already have two. \n\nThe greatest thing with \"Time\" is that is transcends expectation, it shows that there can be hope against the law of mediocrity, that there are people who can rise into excellence more than once in their lifetime, that can face the destructive winds of Time and stand strong. But, hey Jari, don't just chill and rest yet, you've got a second part to deliver (and please, be extra careful with these faders!). The rating is just for Wintersun standards - there's absolutely no one else in their league. Oh, and remember to listen to this with good headphones - and loud, please. \n\n\nOriginally written for http://questunknown.blogspot.gr\n",
        "\nWell, it is finally here. After eight long years, filled with anticipation and disappointments, the long awaited follow-up to the band\u2019s debut album \u201cWintersun\u201d has finally landed in our time. The ironically entitled album \u201cTime\u201d; This has to be one of the most anticipated albums of this year, at least to me, and after a few spins you can notice quite a change in the approach since their 2004 debut.\n\nIn this review I will try to neglect the fact that this was supposed to be a full album with more songs, but was split into two albums in the last few months because in Jari\u2019s opinion, \u201cthe music was too big for one album\u201d. I will neglect the fact that Jari has been a real dick concerning releasing this album, in order to perfect it to the ultimate form possible. I will ignore that and focus on the music itself.\n\nThe album contains only 5 tracks, 2 instrumentals: \u201cWhen Time Fades Away\u201d and \u201cDarkness and Frost\u201d. And 3 songs: \u201cSons of Winter and Stars\u201d, \u201cLand of Snow and Sorrow\u201d, and \u201cTime\u201d. \n\nThe music is generally much more atmospheric, depends on engulfing guitar riffs with a cocoon of synthesis and orchestration, you can also notice an influence of Japanese music, especially in the intro \u201cWhen Time Fades Away\u201d, the song \u201cSons of Winter and Stars\u201d and the end of the last song \u201cTime\u201d. The music also sounds a lot more epic with extra layers of different keyboard sounds, the album at some points sounds even too big for its own good, sometimes you can feel the extra use of layers is getting out of hand, but it\u2019s well controlled by the drumming of Mr. Hahto, the bass line and the awesome well crafted guitar riffs, but you can feel it\u2019s much different from before, which is really a double edged dagger, it\u2019s good at some points and offers a fresh breeze in the record, but on the other hand it can a bit boring and inconsistent.\n\nProbably the most surprising part of the album is the vocals, the vocals of Jari has improved significantly, it\u2019s more emotional and touching in the clean vocals domain, and it sounds more brutal and violent in the growling part, it really suits the whole atmosphere of the album and gives it a beautiful frozen flavor, it\u2019s like listening to a depressing Anime movie.\n\nAs a keyboardist myself, I must say that I am completely awed by the amazing talents I have witnessed in this album. The orchestration is incredible and flowing through the whole record, like a tapestry of darkness and beauty, it\u2019s weaved in a very professional way, crafted in tears and blood of years of work. Probably the most incredible keyboard gems are hidden in the song \u201cTime\u201d. It\u2019s flowing perfectly and flawlessly like a pure immortal stream. \n\nYou can easily notice that Jari and the others have really poured much of their emotions in this album, and it shows how hard they have been working. It\u2019s a really rewarding album. I must say that in many ways it managed to surpass its predecessor, but on the other hand you can notice that the guitars have been a little neglected in the mixing zone, I mean the riffing is very well written and molded, but it hasn\u2019t got its fair share and should have been given a little more attention, at some points in the depths of songs such as \u201cLand of Snow and Sorrow\u201d and \u201cTime\u201d it almost sounds that the album is entirely executed on keyboards until few riffs and solos kick in and change that idea, but you can still get that feeling.\n\nIn short, this record is an undeniable masterpiece and it was well worth the wait, but as long devoted fans of Wintersun we expected much more in the guitar department, I really hope to see more of that in the upcoming album Time II. \n\nWelcome back, Wintersun !\n\nOriginality: 8/10\nMusicianship: 7/10\nPerformance: 7/10\nSongwriting: 8/10\nProduction: 6/10\n\nScore: 72%\n",
        "\nIt\u2019s about TIME!\nYeah, yeah, that\u2019s a cheap derp joke, but I still think it\u2019s worth at least a little merit. Jari Maenpaa didn\u2019t really make a lot of friends over his desire for his perfection-to-the-point-of-obsession when producing \u201cTime\u201d, and many of us who\u2019ve been so blown away by WINTERSUN\u2019s s/t debut started to get more and more anxious over the years-on-end delays. Eight years. Eight fucking years. And the last few times something like this happened, the listening public got \u201cSt. Anger\u201d (1997 to 2003, a six year wait) and \u201cIllud Divinum Insanus\u201d (2003 to 2012, an eight to nine year wait), both of which ended up with their fair share of detractors in the end (though to be fair, \u201cIllud\u2026\u201d had its moments or glory, whereas \u201cSt. Anger\u201d was just a train wreck from front to back). Not that I\u2019m accusing \u201cTime\u201d of running the risk of being among the no hopers of yesteryear. But you know where I\u2019m coming from with this.\n\nSo here I sit, fingers at the ready, gearing up to enter the album\u2019s fray\u2026\n\nNo words. None. I\u2019m speechless, utterly and resolutely. I never thought an album this massive in its musicality could still be possible in this era. Based on pure atmosphere alone, \u201cTime I\u201d is overwhelming. The risk of being swallowed whole by the sheer amount of layers is there, but it\u2019s a willing sort of swallowedness, intentionally drawn into its enveloping grace. It\u2019s really a thing of beauty, (this of course being said without any shred of blind hero worship on my end), and the time I\u2019d spent listening to it was done so with a stunned sensation. This demanded my attention, and dammit if it didn\u2019t receive it. So, with all that said, was it worth waiting 8 years or so? Yes. Yes, yes, YES. From the creative aspect, much of the musical end of things is based on miles-thick layers of synth and orchestral movements that really move the listener, with the guitar and bass riffing merely running alongside them (that\u2019s not to say that the guitars are wholly useless here\u2026just not as important as many would expect, is all) and more singing/choruses than before; thankfully the years have been kind to Mr. Maenpaa\u2019s pipes, as nowadays his cleans much stronger and majestic than before and his screaming has more balls. And when they all come together, things go from section to section with a strong progressive vibe, truly taking in the spacey aspect Jari\u2019s been shooting for since the start of the project (pretty much in spite of its wintry/nature-based origins).\n\nThose who are here for either a replication of the first album or desire a more \u201ctraditional metal\u201d album will be horribly pissed off by this. \u201cTime I\u201d is here to bring you into a universe all its own rather than simply rock you. And it\u2019s within its own dimensional flux, where things veer back and forth at such a rapid pace, that one can finds its many, many little satisfying details. You\u2019ll think you know where the album is heading, you\u2019ll think you\u2019ve got Wintersun pegged, but time and again you\u2019ll end up veering off into worlds unheard (at least, by their perspective). Yet, with all that said, though, this is an album I don\u2019t really see appealing to everyone. Particularly those who hate the majestic/symphonic metal thing. And as I\u2019ve said before with regards to other albums/bands of this caliber, it\u2019s really their loss because \u201cTime I\u201d is an absolutely stellar disc that bursts at the seams with a \u201cWow!\u201d factor so few albums in recent times have been able to possess. No one track really stands out; they\u2019re all fascinating in their own respective rights no matter how you slice it. Stunning. Amazing. Awe-inspiring. That good enough for ya?\n\nIn the end, Wintersun truly outdo their first album in terms of overall solidity and ability to stun the listener. This is not an album to simply listen to or merely appreciate; this is something to experience, to live through, to traverse across over and over again. This is definitely a must-own album, and a clear forerunner for Album of 2012. Just\u2026wow.\n",
        "\nWell this is it, kids. The big one, the one you've all been waiting with bated breath for nearly a decade for. Jari Maenpaa's alleged masterpiece, the one and mighty Time. After leaving Ensiferum at the height of their popularity to focus full time on his baby, Wintersun, Jari has spent presumably all of his free time obsessively crafting this masterwork, this ode to the gods of music, this sonic journey through time and stars and snow. Tours were canceled, tentative release dates kept on being pushed back or passing by with nary a fart noise coming from Jari's general direction. This was poised to be his Use Your Illusion. He has a monumentally successful debut and then spends the next couple years being a reclusive perfectionist while meticulously nitpicking and perfecting his complex vision. I mean really, he describes the music as \"Extreme Majestic Technical Epic Melodic Metal\", which sounds like some ridiculous shit I would make up in order to make fun of it. Really, look at that profoundly superfluous descriptor and try to imagine what the fuck Wintersun sounds like. Clearly this is the work of a mad genius, the musical equivalent of Nikola Tesla for the new millennium.\n\nNow Time is finally, for realsies out and finished, and to the shock of precisely nobody, it's a goddamn insult.\n\nEight years. Think about that, think about everything that's happened in those eight years. The Chicago Blackhawks went from perennial whipping boys to Stanley Cup champions, Saddam, Gaddafi, and bin Laden were all killed, a black man became president of the United States, MutantClannfear lived more than half of his life, and Fall Out Boy's entire career happened. In all of this time, Jari assured us he was slaving away, doing his absolute damnedest to make sure he was getting his creation just perfect for all of us. This dude was acting like goddamn Howard Hughes, except he managed to skip straight to the piss-drinking insanity stage. There are apparently something preposterous like 200+ tracks on each song, the hypothetical tape would be fucking transparent if this weren't all digital. The problem is that he thinks he can be Queen here, and just capture this huge journey and set it to music that's as complex as it is accessible, that's as bombastic as it is grounded. If Jari Maenpaa is Queen, then I'm Roger Ebert.\n\nI could make stupid metaphors and similes until the goddamned sun implodes if left unchecked (I even passed on my overdone picnic analogy! Go me!), so I'm going to attempt to rein myself in here and explain why Time I is so offensive. And really, a huge component is the ratio of sheer amount of time it took to complete to the actual amount of content we got as a result. I can't get over the fact that after eight years of waiting, the band is actually going to play the Darelle Revis card and hold out on us after proving themselves precisely once. Wintersun's self titled debut is for some utterly perplexing reason heralded as a beacon of metal songwriting despite containing precisely two good songs followed by what feels like ten hours of Jari jerking off to pictures of himself. Based on that, fans have waiting patiently for enough time for a Great Dane to live its entire life for the follow up, and when that day finally, finally came, we were only given half of the final product. What kind of bullshit turd dicking move is that? After all this goddamn time, you expect me to lap up five measly tracks, only breaking the forty minute mark because the last song has three minutes of an unrelated instrumental transition track tacked on to the back of it and then promise me that the second half will be out soon? Bitch your word is worth about as much as the Hungarian pengo, I'll have kids in grade school by the time the second half of this album sees the light of day if your track record is anything to go by. Because hey kids, here's some random trivia you've all seemed to have forgotten, the first handful of songs written for the first Wintersun album were written... *drum roll* eight fucking years before the album was released. This obnoxious waiting period is nothing new for the band, Jari takes his sweet time when writing music. But hey, let's pretend for the sake of keeping this review on track, that Time II comes out within a month, does it still justify the piddly bullshit we have here for Time I?\n\nOf course not, I'd be cursing a whole shitbucket less if that were the case. The problem with this is that the preposterous waiting period doesn't show at all. At no point is there anything complex enough, or well thought out enough, or executed strongly enough for me to believe that two high school careers were spent honing it to perfection. Now don't get me wrong, this isn't a sloppy mess that sounds thrown together in the eleventh hour, clearly every moment was meticulously planned and orchestrated from the beginning, but it's all so mind-numbingly average that it becomes something worse entirely. I feel like the problem here is that Jari simply thinks he's much more clever than he actually is, so he spends an eternity putting together this masterpiece that turns out to be something Rhapsody could have sneezed out in between their cruddy albums in the mid 00s. Did anybody truly expect this to be life affirmingly great? Of course not, in fact I actually expected the music itself to be much worse than it actually is. I won't deny for one second that the music is well performed and actually showcases some very diverse dynamics, which is a complete rarity for anything within the confines of metal nowadays.\n\nThe first two tracks rank somewhere between \"very good\" and \"surprisingly great\", and are paced masterfully. This is a massive improvement from the self titled, which was paced like somebody sneezing and then watching their phlegm drip down a wall. The songs there were arranged from shortest to longest, which I suspect was an effort to make the album feel more and more epic with each new piece, but instead made it feel longer and longer each time and really hammered home just how glacial and dull the album truly was. Instead of blowing his wad early and then spending the next 45 minutes silently sobbing into his pillow, Jari instead actually builds up anticipation and releases it in a scarily brilliant fashion. \"When Time Fades Away\" ranks as one of my favorite intro tracks of the past decade or so, to be entirely honest with you. It's merely an intro and it's quite lengthy as far as instrumental intros go, but the fact that it slowly builds up energy across a very palatable melody just works in such a strikingly beautiful way. There's also a personal bias because ever since playing the old Playstation game, Tenchu, I've had an almost fetishistic affinity for traditional Japanese music. I fucking love the twang of the shamisen and the pleasant coo of the whistles, and so the prominent Eastern influence is a huge plus, and something that actually managed to assuage my seething fury at the relative brevity of the album itself upon first listen. The first proper song, \"Sons of Winter and Stars\", actually starts so smoothly that you can barely hear the transition between the intro if you aren't paying close attention, as it starts off with roughly thirty seconds of even more traditional Japanese music. It paints this vivid picture of a dimension spanning journey the listener is about to embark on, and bewilderingly enough it actually manages to deliver on this promise in the beginning. I touched on the dynamics earlier, and while I was slightly facetious about their quality (I do find the two extremes to be akin to Raiders of the Lost Ark in that the quiet parts are too quiet and the loud parts are too loud, and such ends up being distracting), it is nice to hear such thought and care put into the lesser aspects of the music. Despite the soul-melting length of the track (over thirteen and a half minutes) and an extended quiet passage in the middle, \"Sons of Winter and Stars\" manages to not get dull. The fast and bombastic parts are full of pomp and vigor, and as I've stated oodles of times in the past, that is when Jari is at his best. It builds to no less than two very satisfying and well executed climaxes that end up being very depressing in the grand scheme of things. That release of \"Embrace the STAAAAAAAHS\" is skin tinglingly great. This is what most people were expecting this album to sound like, and for the first quarter of the alleged full product, it actually does live up to the stupidly high expectations that I certainly did not have.\n\nIt's only afterwards that the album falls into the rut that I just fucking knew it would fall into. \"Land of Snow and Sorrow\" (can you tell that he names his songs with Wintersun ad-libs?) pulls the dragchute and spends the entirety of its duration just trudging along like a lost (and not adorable) puppy. Listen to that opening guitar line and tell me that he really needed eight shit spackling years to tweak that to perfection. It's a lazy, plodding, dull and uninteresting riff that just drives the exciting energy that the previous track just spent a quarter of an hour building up straight into the mud. The orchestrations that build around it are uninspired and predictable, and the pace never picks back up. Over eight minutes are spent on this lifeless, meandering snoozefest that never once ever attempts an epic moment. That pan-dimensional journey the album was alluding that we'd embark on? Yeah, this is where Jari just puts the controls on autopilot and fucks off to go eat some potato chips. Nothing happens, the riffs just plod on like a dozy elephant and the symphonics just kind of diddle around with their own thing, just being wispy off in the atmosphere. Imagine a version of \"Sleeping Stars\" from the previous album that's almost twice as long (while feeling twice as long as that, added on) with even less going on within the song. I can't get over how intensely boring the song is, this is why the album is so offensive to me. This is what we'd been waiting for? Where was the brilliance we saw in that opener? You're only going to present us with half of your vision, and as an added slap in the face, this dull pit of tripe is part of that? This didn't take you eight years to write, this probably didn't even take eight hours. This is insulting, and any fans lapping this up like good little minions are simply lying to themselves if you can find anything approaching good songwriting within. Go jump off the highest point of your house and land face first on something pointy.\n\nThe \"album\" rounds out with another interlude-full song combo, and this one holds nary a percentage of the vigorous ambition of the first set. \"Darkness and Frost\" (Seriously? What are some of the tracks on the second part of this bloated turd going to be called? \"Stars of Snow and Darkness\"? \"Winter of Stars and Time\"? \"Starless Winter Darkness\"?) is yet another competent Japanese influenced instrumental, though wholly lacking in the vibrancy and splendor of \"When Time Fades Away\", and builds up into the drudgery that is the title track. \"Time\" is yet another dull, spiteful exercise in how to show your patient fans naught but utter contempt. I could just copy and past my entire diatribe on \"Land of Snow and Sorrow\" here and the description would be just as apt. The main difference is that \"Time\" is based around a higher tempo and contains one of Jari's patented shredding solos, and even that ends up sounding lame and forced. I wasn't expecting another \"Winter Madness\", because that would be asking for the moon on a stick, but something a little more inspired than a warmup exercise would be mightily welcomed. The clean vocals come off as tired and obligatory, the strings are dull and inconsequential, the drummer is so pointless that he might as well not get any royalties from the album sales. There is a psyche-out buildup that leads to a loud orchestral part that somehow ends up sounding much less exuberant than the brilliance shown on \"Sons of Winter and Stars\", which I will continue to hold as the stick by which this entire experience should be measured by. The song is truly only roughy nine minutes long, but in order to breach the forty minute mark, what was clearly intended to be another standalone interlude was tacked on to the end in order to juuuuust push it over the mark. It's this kind of underhanded trickery that further fuels my virulent hatred of what this album stands for, which is a monumental lack of inspiration being mislabeled as visionary and consequently spoon fed to loyal fans as the answer to their prayers. And then fence sitters and vocal detractors like myself are also expected to hear an unheard of brilliance within Time and, if not promptly switch sides for the cheerleader, to at the very least understand what the die hard fans have been chomping at the bit about.\n\nFrankly, NO. This is overblown yet still undercooked. There's a lot of presentation with no flair. And apart from one example of Jari's flukey genius, the other two thirds of the album's content is watered down nonsense with no appeal. If you like this droning, plodding nonsense with weak symphonics, then by all means you'll eat this like candy. I wasn't expecting this to be as fast paced as I prefer Jari to be (\"Beyond the Dark Sun\" and \"Winter Madness\" are legitimately great songs from the previous album, and are unironically the fastest and most to-the-throat songs on the album), but I wasn't expecting it to mirror the new Ensiferum album. Yeah I said it. This is akin to freakin' Unsung Heroes. Both albums revel in the dull half of the early dichotomy that exemplified Jari's songwriting style on the first two Ensiferum albums. Time I spends a majority of the album on the slow side, and just like the slow half of the first Ensiferum album, it's fucking bloated and boring, and with the extramusical qualities being taken into account, it's an insult to those who've been waiting. Keep in mind, I'm not even a fan of Wintersun for the most part, so imagine how pissed off I'd be if I was given this dull, glorified EP as a reward for eight fucking years of faithful patience in the face of seemingly dogged contempt towards me.\n\nI compared this to Use Your Illusion earlier, based solely on the fact that the main songwriter became a screwy and reclusive perfectionist after one monstrously popular album, but the ratio of time taken to complete to utter disappointment ranks closer to Chinese Democracy. If you, as a fan, don't mind having your face spat in as long as you finally get to hear some new Wintersun material, then fine, go running back to your abusive ex, crying about how you still love him and you know he's sorry. For me? Fuck that, this is offensive to me on both a musical and non-musical level. The second half of this album better A) come out very, very soon and B) contain some of the most stellar material I've ever heard as an avid listener of epic metal, because what we've been given with Time I is fucking insulting.\n\nPS - Here's a nice visual metaphor to help explain why the production time on this album drives me as fucking crazy as it does. This is the longest review I've written to date, and it holds approximately 2786 words. If every single word in this review represented one day, it would still take another two hundred or so before the album was actually released. Seriously. If you think a 40 minute EP with only one good song and one beautiful intro is worth such an outrageous wait, then you're clearly insane and should see a doctor.\n\n\nOriginally written for http://lairofthebastard.blogspot.com/\n",
        "\nA furious, icy blizzard through space and time. Howling winds where there is no sound. Cosmic energies focusing around shining nebulas. Portals into unknown, hostile worlds. Galaxies weeping. Wormholes of pain and suffering. Beautiful death in -273,15 degrees. \n\nWhat I described above are images \"Wintersun's\" critically acclaimed (or accused of being highly overrated) debut album evokes in my mind. For me, these visions encapsulate the essence of this masterpiece. Only a handful of albums have ever reached the level of uniqueness, richness of songwriting and pure, blazing intensity that Wintersun's self-titled holds within it. It is a phenomenal mixture of some of the best features of metal music, all of them incorporated together with no cracks or shatters whatsoever. The mastermind behind this album is no other than the famed Jari M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4, former frontman of \"Ensiferum\". He has done amazing job by using his admirable talents in different areas of expertise: with several instruments, in songwriting and as a lyricist. He makes brilliant use of the neck-breaking fury of melodic death metal, the soaring melodies of power metal, the grand vastness of epic folk/viking metal and the blistering speed of melodic black metal, all this smoothly interconnected and iced with formidable technicality. The album raditates despair, fear, hate, melancholy and sadness through images of cosmic proportions put inside the mind of a human being. The lyrics stem from this context, creating emotional surges of the deepest thoughts of man. \n\n\"Wintersun\" is an ominous maelstrom that draws the listener deep into its bowels. It is also a representation of musical prowess that only a few can match in my books. From destructively fast solos to razor sharp riffing, from beautifully bleak and freezing keyboard melodies to impressive harsh vocals, from gloomy atmospheres to enchanting lyrics, everything is carved in the shape of colossal, ambitious and inspiring images. \"Winter Madness\" shows us perhaps the most technical and speedy side of the album with its hyper fast guitarwork and multi-layered melodies. It is a frosty anthem that paints pictures of merciless winters of the far north. \"Battle Against Time\" leans towards a different area of metal. The song's most remarkable characteristics focus around majestic, crushing harmonies of epic metal. Raging blast beats and ingenious guitar melodies are completed with bombastic clean choirs and the result is a massively cosmic sound. One of the high points of the album is also the slow, intriguingly wandering \"Death and the Healing\". It features only noble, clean vocals and offers the listener fascinating visions. The lyrics are excellently supported by long, intricate lead guitar passages that are woven around the main soundscape. Truth to be told, in my opinion every single track on this album is a masterwork of epic, melodic metal but \"Starchild\" has always been my favourite. This song kind of compiles every best bit of the album and reforms them into a new entirety that surpasses the rest of the songs. It has speed, it has the most memorable melodies, it has in-depth, spacey lyrics and it has great, diverse vocals through which Jari truly shines. Listening to Starchild is like diving through planes of existence on a journey to discover something about oneself and exploring the mind-blowing depths of the universe. No doubt one of the best songs I have ever come across. \n\nLike I mentioned before, each song on Wintersun is a highlight in its own right but I'll leave the secrets of the rest for you to discover. The album is a complex whole of magnificent elements brought together by the creative force that is Jari M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4. However, I also have to specificly mention the drumwork since it's the only thing not done by Mr. M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4. While this album was being made, behind the kit sat one of Finland's most respected drummers, Kai Hahto. His superb skills laid down the spine for the grandiose structures summoned by Jari and that is no minor achievement. All in all, I reside in the camp of those who worship this album and who are awestruck by its elaborate world. So why take 2% off of the rating, you might wonder? Some certain parts of \"Sleeping Stars\" fall a bit short of the gloomy excellence the song is mostly constructed of. Yes, it's that simple: the album has basically one little flaw. Thus it is almost as close to perfection as possible so reach out your hands and grab this album before the second one finally comes out!\n\nOriginally written for http://reflectionsinthousandlakes.blogspot.fi/\n",
        "\nThis masterpiece tells a story when you listen to it, but since albums can't write reviews - I will have to. This studio album has it all: heavy riffs, orgasmic melodies, inhuman technical guitar solos, progressions, ballads, harsh vocals, clean manly vocals (not like those clean pop parts in core music). Songs are aggressive, but very passionate, and every song is instantly memorable. They are all instantly memorable because: Beyond The Dark Sun is mind-blowing, fast and aggressive opener, with amazing sweep picking, crunchy riffs, fast tempo and monster drumming. That is the shortest track here, so naturally they made a music video. After it comes Winter Madness with insane guitar solo which is one of the best composed solos ever, progressions which are so very well done that you won't even notice tempo change, also this song has contrast between beautiful melodies and harsh vocals. Sleeping Stars is atmospheric song with amazing ambient. Very passionate one, with nicely done vocal parts and excellent lyrics.\n\nBattle Against Time with excellent sing-along refrains, insane technical guitar solo and great headbanging riffs. Death And The Healing is passionate ballad, done with clean vocals, otherwise it would be totally ruined. It has long amazing impossible-to-play guitar solo full of sweeps, shredding and arpeggios and lyrics with really deep meaning. Starchild is the most progressive song from the album. It has head-crushing riffs, tasty lead guitars, excellent lyrics, lots of tempo changes and some folk metal parts appear. Beautiful Death has powerful riffs, another technical guitar solo, great atmosphere and of course, genial lyrics, just like every song here. Sadness And Hate is a bit folk metal, even more than that part of Starchild. It's very calm ending song, to complete the perfection of this release. So, everything is memorable and interesting here. Riffs are heavy, very creative, memorable, powerful, and there are many of them in every song.\n\nProgression happen often, because of that every song changes its \"mood\" which makes progressive metal feel. Don't forget kids, J\u00e4ri M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4 is guitar god. Just listen to those amazing sweeps, arpeggios, tapping and shredding in Beyond The Dark Sun, Winter Madness, Battle Against Time, Death And The Healing and Beautiful Death. Those solos are godlike, with overdose of feel and passion, and they are impossible to play for ordinary people. Not just riffs and guitar solos, but Jari gave nice keyboard touch to fill the songs with enchanting melodies and sometimes appear in solos. They weren't necessary in solos, but it's not like keyboards in solos of Sonata Arctica or Children Of Bodom. There keyboards play more important role than guitars, and that really sucks. J\u00e4ri M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4 is not just god-like guitar player, but very intelligent philosopher. His lyrics can picture a man who was caught in a snow-storm, and his life comes to an end. I can almost see that man who fell in the snow, and starts slowly to drift into the world between reality and illusion. Also, Death And The Healing is genial song which describes how time flies fast, and how J\u00e4ri feels because of that.\n\n\"Time\" is dominant word and inspiration for most of his songs, even if we go back and listen to Ensiferum's songs from Ensiferum and Iron. Also, we all expect his studio album \"Time\". See? He needs lots of time to create Time... studio album. Not just J\u00e4ri does amazing job here, but the drummer Kai Hahto. He really knows how to beat the fuck out of the drums, rape those double bass pedals, to smack massive blast beats and play really fast. Some think this band (because it is their only album) is overrated. Is it so? Why do people always bash on talented musicians, and yet enjoy so much popular mediocrity. Almost every melodic death metal band I've listened to is crap. This one is very unique and very enjoyable with talent overdose. Is Jari overrated because of his endless talent? Because of his perfect creativity? Because he can write genial lyrics which actually mean something? Which band can make story like this, giving clear image of almost dead man's state of mind, his way of thinking in his last moments of life? Wintersun is the answer. You can almost feel how harsh the winter storm is, and how helpless is the protagonist. This is not a concept album, but a story about life and death, shown through those amazing songs, and still each song is for its own.\n\nGood sides of this release:\nThis is the best melodic death metal album, and this band is synonym for melodic death metal. So much talent and creative work here. If you see this album buy it, and help J\u00e4ri make more perfect songs faster.\n\nBad sides of this release:\nDo not expect other melodic death metal bands to be even close to Wintersun. This is the most perfect melodic death metal band. After them probably come Kalmah, but they stand no chance against almighty Wintersun.\n\nHighlights:\nEvery single song.\n",
        "\n'Wintersun' - Wintersun (7/10)\nArising to the attention of the metal world for his work in folk metal band Enisferum, singer and multi instrumentalist Jari Maenpaa already had a loyal fanbase before 'Wintersun' was released. With little idea what they would receive, the fans eagerly anticipated. While Wintersun is certainly more than a meager extension of the previous band, there are definately many of the things here, that gave Enisferum their fierce fanbase to begin with. Folk and power metal abounds here, with a little bit more heaviness than a typical metal fan may expect of either genre. What makes Wintersun and this debut so noteworthy is that it melds styles that surprisingly rarely cross in the metal scene.\n\nWhile melodic power metal is generally thought to be something that's left to the whims of operatic dropouts and screechers in the style of Rob Halford, Maenpaa takes the speed and technical considerations of the aforementioned style, and couples it with many traits one might expect from black metal. Blackened screams and heavy-as-hell guitar riffage seems to work magically with the generally lighter lead playing and harmonies.\n\nThe album flow of 'Wintersun' seems to be very much relient on a 'shortest-to-longest' format. Over the course of the album (which almost hits the hour mark) one begins to notice that the songs get longer and longer, going from a vicious two minute introduction to a drawn out and frostbitten epic finale that tops the ten minute mark. While this might be an interesting gag, it can make for an uneven feeling of flow along the way. However, 'Wintersun' is the sort of album that is better based on the quality of the songs themselves rather than the overall product.\n\nBesides the drums, this is Jari's show completely. He writes all of the music, and performs all of the instruments except the percussion, which is played skillfully in a black metal style by Kai Hahto. For anyone that is not a fan of speed in heavy metal, it is better to skip by this one. 'Wintersun' blows the doors off in terms of tempo, and more often than not, things are racing by at lightspeed with blastbeats, and fastly picked guitar melodies. This is an area of the music that is completely subjective however. The transitions from the heavy to lighter portions of music can be very rough at times, but the band's emphasis on heaviness in their power metal blend is very refreshing to my ears.\n\nWhile it is enjoyable to listen to such a powerful and energetic album, it can feel at points like there should be more variety. Throughout, it feels like very similar riffs are being used; and Maenpaa (while being a gifted metal guitarist) is pulling out the same tricks over and over again and expecting it to be just as impressive. All things considered however, this is a very competent debut album, and with a new highly anticipated Wintersun album arriving to shelves late in 2011, the sound of great potential is heard even more in this music.\n",
        "\nThere are only a few bands that already have a legendary status after their debut album. The stunning legacy and mystery that already surrounds the band's future output \"Time\" that has been delayed over and over again and seems to be a very one of the most epic, complex and complicated albums that have ever been created in the metal universe is comparable to the story of Guns 'n' Roses' \"Chinese Democracy\". That's why I wanted to take a closer look on this band and I must admit that the hype is exagerated.\n\n\"Wintersun\" deliver dark and very epic folk metal and their album goes from the shortest to the longest track. The musical and lyrical directions in general remind a lot of the Finnish metal legends \"Ensiferum\" and other folk metal bands like \"Tyr\" while the epic constructions are inspired by older bands with epic sounds such as the inventors of Viking Metal that are \"Bathory\" but they also take some bits and pieces from rather modern epic melodic death or folk metal bands such as \"Children of Bodom\" or \"Equilibrium\". \u00b4\n\nWhile this mixture is not truly original or innovating, the band proves that they are great and ambitious musicians and create diversified mixtures of all those influences. The main prioblem in here is that they exagerate a little bit and put sometimes too many overwhelming elements in their sound which is also a problem I have with bands such as \"Blind Guardian\" or \"Rhapsody of Fire\". Instead of remaining and focussing on a great melody they put too many ideas in one single song and that's sometimes a little bit hard to digest and asks several tries and a lot of attention. Technically, this band is brilliant and honours their multiple influences but the songwriting could be starighter and more coherent. Sometimes, I'm losing them in the longer songs and they don't get down to earth and to the point even if every song has some good ideas from long and epic narrative passages to violent melodic death metal parts. \n\nThis diversity only works completely well in the shortest piece of the record which is \"Beyond the dark sun\" and the band already puts ideas in this short and sweet song of two and a half minutes that other bands would put in three songs of about five minutes: power metal guitar riffs and keyboard interludes that remind of \"Stratovarius\", epic narrative passages that remind of \"Bathory\", catchy death metal vocals that remind of \"Children of Bodom\", slight folk tale melodies that use abnds such as \"Equilibrium\" and a general atmosphere that is similar to the first two albums of \"Ensuiferum\". The track is though shorte nough top remain catchy and addictable which isn't the case for the longer and longer tracks that put three times as much ideas in almost ten minutes of music. \n\nThere is one single exception on this album which is the last song called \"Sadness and hate\" that takes some time to focus on an epic and majestic atmosphere, simple but addicting melodies and a fascinating story with interesting lyrics. This best song is a great closure for the record and I hope that the band will create more epic songs in that style on their fortchcoming record.\n\nIn the end we have a very ambitious, epic and diversified record here that aims very high but that is too overwhelming, creatiev and megalomaniac at some points. While every song is interesting and has great passages, the tracks as a whole are sometimes hectical, confusing and simply frustrating. The shortest and the longest track represnet the two extremes and how the band should and could work in the future to create catchier tunes. Sometimes, less is more and structure and patience is better than exagerated intellectuality and pressure. For the next record, the abnd took a lot of time and I hope they trained their focus to elaborate their songs slower and further at the same time. Nevertheless, anybody that likes the bands I have all mentioned above will appreciate the record at least as much as a critical person like me and probably even more so that I can only suggest to give this record a try. This is surely on a way better level than other folk metal bands such as \"Alestorm\", \"Swashbuckle\" or \"Eluveitie\". If you happen to like epic folk metal but you find this stuff too hard I can suggest you to try out the latest albums of \"Tyr\", \"Turisas\" and maybe \"Heljareyga\".\n",
        "\nIt\u2019s not very often that I reward an album with a perfect score, but Wintersun\u2019s debut album really earns it. As we\u2019re all still waiting for over seven years for the second album to be on the way, just one glance at this record reminds us why the hell we still hope for that second album to come out. But most of all we want to know how the hell Jari M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4 can top this masterpiece of epic power metal.\n\nNothing but good words from me about this record. From the opening track \u201cBeyond the Dark Sun\u201d on you will be bombarded with epic chord progressions, strong melodies straight from the gut and in-your-face heaviness combined with virtuosic solos. Mr. M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4 sorted his songs from short to long and released them in exactly that form and surprisingly the winning formula of variation coincides. After the fast, epic introduction of \u201cBeyond the Dark Sun\u201d we get to know the heavy side of M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4 and the true nature of drummer Kai Hahto as furious blastbeats dominate the track, ironically topped with a melodic, icy ambience. M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4\u2019s screams sound very convincing and full of emotion; not something I often experience when hearing screams, growls or grunts. The great solo in the middle also deserves a little mention. From fast and melodic to heavy and aggressive to the third song of the album: \u201cSleeping Stars\u201d. As the title might suggest this song tends to be an epic ballad-ish type of song. Given that M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4 still uses his screams might indicate this is not truly a ballad, but we also get to hear him sing here and he does it alright. Too bad his singing voice is mixed a little to the background so it doesn\u2019t fully come to its right. With these three first tracks, we\u2019ve seen the many-sidedness of Wintersun and the next few tracks will blend these elements to longer tracks with worthy mentions being the epic ballad \u201cDeath and the Healing\u201d, the progressive \u201cStarchild\u201d, the blackened \u201cBeautiful Death\u201d and the beautiful album closer \u201cSadness and Hate\u201d. I could write another paragraph to describe each and every one of them, but it will contain the word \u2018epic\u2019 a little too many times. \n\nInstead, I\u2019ll focus upon what makes this album thrive so much. The concept of a dark sun, a winter sun, is nothing new within the Scandinavian metal acts, but I have rarely seen an album so obsessed by eternal winter, by epic darkness, that it actually brings a melancholic element to the band. Within this aggressive record of despair, grief, anger and regret there\u2019s a very strong longing for light; a desperate cry to reach the warm sun, which is a source of positive energy. I think it might very well be a feeling familiar to many inhabitants of northern Scandinavia and other countries close to the North Pole. For me, someone who doesn\u2019t know the effect of the dark winter sun in my country, the feeling is still familiar, but not the literal phenomenon. On pictures it always is a beautiful sight to see such an image, but in reality, such a long period of darkness affects your mood. This album totally captures that mood. Its melodies and sounds are beautiful, but in reality M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4 and Hahto want to make us feel like they do and the lyrics are as dark as the night. I think it\u2019s a really thrilling concept and they did a good job bringing that concept to a credible and terrific end.\n\nIn short, if you want an album that not only sounds original, but also has a thrilling concept combined with excellent music, executed by virtuosos, this album should be on your \u2018to-get\u2019-list. Today, almost five years after I discovered this album, I still listen to it and enjoy it to the full. I have different favourites every time I hear it though.\n\nStrongest moments: \u201cWinter Madness\u201d, \u201cDeath and the Healing\u201d and \u201cBeautiful Death\u201d.\n\nhttp://thecryreviews.blogspot.com/\n",
        "\nThere\u2019s just something about Finland that I don\u2019t think we Yanks will ever understand. More often than not, all those extreme metal bands that keep popping up like pimples on a pubescent\u2019s face from the thousand lakes are just excellent beyond excellence, coupling bone-shattering heaviness with heroin-esque addictive hooks that keep the listener mesmerized. There is something in the atmosphere, something appealing with a country that spends half a year under swaths of snow that makes for great, heavy, and catchy-as-fuck music.\n\nAnd the cream of the crop, all present BS aside, is this here Wintersun band.\n\nWintersun is, in my eyes, an amalgam of pretty much every great aspect of Finnish metal\u2026a feast of neo-classical/progressive/Viking/folky/melodic black metal done with that \u201cKaiitos\u201d-evoking touch. For all his perfectionism, this Jari Maenpaa fella can definitely craft some amazing music, and this is shown in the most absolute of spades on this album. While not stretching too far from his Ensiferum-ridden roots in the musical sense, Wintersun instead conjures up more of an image of wintry dominion and natural wonder versus the former-mentioned group\u2019s chants of Viking dominance (funny how certain bands can create a sound that\u2019s taken straight from nature with electronic instrumentation\u2026but that\u2019s neither here nor there). All this comes together as a double-edged sword of infectious melody and head smashing brutality the likes of which so few equals can ever come close to capturing, made all the more intriguing due to the fact that Mr. Maenpaa pretty much did all this by himself (except for the drum work); being able to bring to little those tasty guitar licks, powerful riffs, atmospheric keyboard lines, epic screams and booming choirs by one\u2019s lonesome is something that earns an A+ in my book, even if the wild abandon percussive rolls and blast beats come from outside sources. Every song on this disc is a invocation of extreme metal perfection\u2026that combination of seemingly contrasting styles pushed through a potent production wringer and shot forth with the madness and intensity of sudden winter gales; I truly don\u2019t see anything wrong on this, nothing that shouldn\u2019t be complete and utter ear candy to anyone in the melodic black/death metal world, where songs like \u201cWinter Madness\u201d, \u201cBattle Against Time\u201d and \u201cBeautiful Death\u201d shove more ideas at you than your poor, abused ears can possibly handle. Such is the never-ending insanity known as the most prominent self-titled album I\u2019ve come across, present and past bands included.\n\nIn the end the first Wintersun blew me the fuck away and has given the metal world the first entry of quite possibly the best Finnish metal band in recent years. The first album is so damned good one would have to wonder\u2026where the hell can it possibly go from here? How can it get any better than this? I guess \u201cTime\u201d will tell\u2026when it comes to pass\n",
        "\nIf you haven't already heard of Wintersun, I pity you. In 2002, Jari Maenpaa (not the proper characters, but oh well) left another band called Ensiferum to pursue his own goals as a musician. The result was Wintersun; a band that fused folk metal, black metal and melodic death metal all into one bundle of echoing beauty. \n\nTheir debut, self-titled album is loaded with exactly what you would expect from the above-mentioned combination of music; melodic riffs, insane drumming (thanks to ex-Rotten Sound drummer Kai Hahto), and a mix up between clean and harsh vocals. The music puts imagery right in your head and you can instantly tell what Jari was trying to depict with whatever song you're listening to. \n\nBut to go into further detail, the album has a fair amount of variety to it, albeit only having eight songs on it. There's the more intense, \"in your face\" type of songs (\"Beyond The Dark Sun\", and the aptly titled \"Winter Madness\") that are more up-tempo. Then there's the slower paced songs that are more oriented towards the beauty behind them as opposed to aggression (\"Star Child\", \"Sleeping Stars\"). The songs are anywhere from 3 minutes to 10 minutes in length, which somewhat compensates for the fact that there aren't many songs to be heard here. \n\nAside from the above mentioned, Kai Hahto really shows off his drumming abilities in terms of variety in style and endurance (the intro to \"Battle Against Time\" having a full two minutes of blast-beating). Jari Maenpaa handles the vocals, guitar, bass and keyboard roles on this album, and he is pretty skilled in all of them. He shows off his ability to lay down clean singing and harsh screams all in one song...even doing a growl in \"Beautiful Death\". His keyboards are very atmospheric and add to the theme of the song. The real part of him that shines here, however, is his guitar playing. Songs like \"Winter Madness\", \"Death and the Healing\" and \"Beautiful Death\" all display his abilities to fuse phrasing, dynamics, melody, and some pretty crazy shredding all into one beautiful solo. His solos are probably the highlight of this album. \n\nMy only real gripe about this album is that it's only eight songs long. I would hope that since alot of these songs were written YEARS before Wintersun was even formed that Jari would have more material. I would also rant about how only about half of the songs on here have guitar solos, but I suppose beauty is in the eye of the beholder.\n\nSo all in all, if you want some variety in your metal, yet you can't seem to stray from the more extreme side of metal, pick up Wintersun's self-titled album; especially if you're a fan of black metal, folk metal, and/or melodic death metal, because it literally has it all.\n",
        "\nI don't hate this album. In fact, it has some really good moments here and there, but those are diluted by the fact that Wintersun are a product of the frightening and growing trend of all style and no substance. Jari Maenpaa is revered highly by many people for reasons that I will never agree with. Yeah, he can string together a lot of riffs and keyboards and drum tracks and vocal tracks and screaming and everything else that he could possibly think of - seriously, man, where are the accordion solos, A Capella sections and rapping verses? I think you forgot a few things. But that doesn't mean I have to like it.\n\nThis album is basically just every In Flames/Dark Tranquillity kid's wet dream: flashy, overly sweet melodies, processed speed metal riffs polished to a sickening sheen and of course harsh vocals that, while competent and workable, wouldn't even scare away your five year old sibling, most likely. Why do bands like this even use harsh vocals to begin with, anyway? That's a good question that I think needs some answering. Do they just not want to take the extra time to find a strong clean vocalist to sing over their rather melodically inclined music? I mean, really, the basic function of harsh vocals in the first place is to act as an extra instrument of sorts, to provide atmosphere and help the music out in that regard - were they ever intended to lead the music in the same fashion as clean vocals? I don't think so, and it might just be personal taste shining through here, but that is about why I cannot get into the vocal stylings in most melodeath bands.\n\nSo, really, what can you say about Wintersun? It's melodramatic, it's jam-packed with ideas and you certainly can't fault Mr. Maenpaa for not trying - the effort here is obvious, I just don't happen to enjoy this very much. A few times I thought it was really getting good, like on the Children of Bodom-esque \"Winter Madness\" and the somber \"Sleeping Stars,\" but that never happened, as pretty much every other song on here is not good. This is very tiring music, very over-saturated, very much like a stick of cotton candy. It tastes good and sweet, but there's not much to chew on. This is music that basically just wants to be as extreme (not extreme like extreme metal though, just extreme like DragonForce's last couple of albums) as possible; nothing else. The creativity in the arrangements unfortunately lends nothing to the enjoyment of the music. This is basically just early Children of Bodom with dignity, and that just takes all the fun out of it; it's missing the point of early Bodom entirely.\n\nThese songs - yes, all of them except for the two I mentioned before - spend too much time being technical and fast and not enough with rich hooks and memorable guitar licks and everything else that makes metal such a pleasure to listen to. A lot of modern bands do this, and it never turns out good, and Wintersun have done nothing to rectify it. If you don't want anything else in your music but wading-pool-level theatrics and meaningless technicality, you will fucking love this, but me, I can't get that excited about it. Fuck, I don't even hate this or anything, but it's already annoying me more the more I think about it. Then again, though, I guess I shouldn't expect much from a guy who calls his music \"Extreme Technical Majestic Epic Melodic Metal,\" or some shit like that. What a fucking joke.\n",
        "\nHere, in Wintersun's debut album, I find a very solid and very good release. First of all, as far as songwriting goes, Jari really steped up his game. All of the melodies in all of the songs are pretty exceptional. Honestly, I would probably give the album a good 10 percent higher if I received a copy of only the lead guitar and the vocals. All lead guitar parts and melodies are extremely thoughtful, and even if they do sound similar from time to time, what band doesn't have similar sounding lead parts? You really can't find any. I could really go on all day about the power of these lead melodies. From fast paced in your face riffs like the one off of beyond the dark sun, to the slower and soothing melody of death and healing, the lead melodies took me into another world. \n\nJari suceeded in painting an atmosphere with these melodies. Jari was always very good with melodies. His work in Ensiferum completely backs this up. But unlike in his work with ensiferum, the melodies and lead parts were not only very interesting, but they also completely took me into another world. In Wintersun, the music certainly painted a clear picture of many different sectinos of an epic journey, similar to what listening to any moonsorrow album will do. \n\nThe big problem I found in the album though, came in the rythm section. Almost everything lead oriented was really spot on, but the rythm sections of this album completely lacked. The drumming was downright boring, the rythm guitar palm muted and tremelo picked everything, you couldn't even come close to hearing the bass because it was just following the guitars, and when the synth wasn't playing a lead, the chords just distracted me from really getting into the song. I think the problem here was that Jari did EVERYTHING. As good of a lead guitarist and vocalist as he is, he cannot write interesting rythms to save his life. In Ensiferum, Jari had other people to do this. He had a bassist, a rythm guitarist, and a drummer. Here, he did not have a bassist, did not have a rythm guitarist, and although he had a drummer I'm going to go out on a limb and say that Jari told the drummer exactly what to do because no good drummer should ever use blast beats as much as he did in this album. \n\nThe rythm section of really ruined this album for me, mainly because I really believe that a strong rythm is needed for any lead parts to really shine. In this album, there are multiple examples of where well written lead lines were boring and dull because of simplistic rythms. The opening riff to starchild is a great example of this. The leading riff is great, I love it, I learned it by ear and I play it all the time. It's fun, upbeat, interesting, and still very melodic. But if you listen to the drums, bass, synth, and rythm guitar, it just kills what the lead is playing. On drums we have a very fast tremelo double bass drum with some hits on the snare and symbols. Nothing is less interesting than listening to a straight tremelo double bass drum pattern for more than one measure. I love double bass, but it needs to be used tactfully. Listening to the same, fast, back and forth pattern instantly bores me. On the rythm guitar we have more tremelo, big surprise. Palm mutes, tremelo, switching notes as in accordance to the lead line. Now, this isn't always bad. This kind of rythm is actually very complimentary for the lead guitar at some points. But when the drummer is doing the exact same tremelo on the double bass, its just to dull. On top of all that, I don't even know if bass was recorded here. I can't hear it. Probably because its just following the rythm guitar. No surprise though, that's what happens when lead guitarists write bass parts. Then on top of all that, in the very light background we have this shrill synth playing these chords that just make me want to jump off a bridge. \n\nAnd that's just one example of failure in the rythm section. Those kind of things are all over the album. The drumming is plagued with blast beats and your simple average rock drum patterns, the bass is consistantly just doing what the rythm guitar does. And the rythm guitar is either playing tremelo or long held out power chords to compliment the leads. I really cannot find a decent rythm on this whole album, despite the genious that is the lead lines. \n\nSo after bashing probably the most important part of any rock album, you might ask, \"why the hell did you give this album an 80 percent?\" Well, that's because, despite the horrid rythms, I cannot get past the genious of the lead lines, vocal patterns, and composition of the album. This is probably the only album where the lead parts and composition is so good that it overshadows poor rythms. \n\nSo in conclusion, I would certainly suggest this album to pretty much anyone. Especially anyone that enjoys blast beats and mindless rythms (and I guarantee there are people out there like that). The leads and melodies are just so good that everyone should get a chance to listen to them, even if they dont like the album as a whole. I personally am very excited to hear Wintersun's upcoming release of \"Time.\" Hopefully, if Jari has a real bassit and rythm guitarist to work with, the rythms wont be so common and typical as if the guy who just put all that time into writing lead lines came up with something simple in a few seconds.\n",
        "\nOver the years, my musical interests have evolved slowly, but surely. It went from Slipknot and Korn to Killswitch Engage and modern In Flames. Alas, my tolerance for music with technicality rose and any album that can place excessive solos and guitar squeals in an efficient manner without sounding too audacious, I'd listen to it (production and vocals evidently coming in to play). When I hit this stage, my friends were constantly recommending Wintersun. I was being spammed with links to \"Beyond the Dark Sun\" on a daily basis. At first, the music came across as brash and full of abhorrent wankery, but in due time, I loved the song. It was time to get their debut.\n\nWhen I put it in, I was expecting the awesome riffing and technicality of the album-opener all the way through. While this is true, it's done in a coma-inducing manner. By that, I mean they copied every riff and drum pattern then pasted it on every song, threw in some symphonic sound effects to make it \"epic\" and added some awful clean vocals to top it off. The last track finished and I was just sitting there going, \"Was that one song?\" Jari and his fellow band mates are undeniably talented and the solo in \"Winter Madness\" is probably something all guitar players fantasize over, but it's not enough to save this album. Normally, I pan albums for the inconsistency that plagues a lot of albums these days, but Wintersun's debut is TOO consistent. An abrasive consistency, if you will. Every song is dragged on far, far too long with very, very stale riffing/solos. The sad part of this is that it was good at first. Imagine receiving oral sex from an extremely beautiful woman for 7 minutes (which represents the first two tracks), but she then tells you she has STDs (representing the rest of the album). It's an extreme disappointment to know that such talent went to waste with this record. Had most of the songs been cut in half and maybe added variety and added more crunch and bang to the guitars/drums, respectively, the album would be an absolute masterpiece. Unfortunately, uninspired and repulsive song writing gets the best of this potentially-amazing album and you're left to wonder what the fuck happened.\n\nMy unbiased viewpoint on this album should be taken into consideration before buying this. What you're getting is paradise that takes a quick turn into unrelenting disaster. I'll be checking out their next record, \"Time\", for the sake of these guys' talents, but something tells me the title of their next album is an indication that the songs on it will be much longer.\n",
        "\nI don't like Ensiferum, or their ilk of shallow saccharine folk metal. I don't like much power metal or faux-symphonic wank, and I generally don't like albums like this: unabashedly pompous, often flowery and straining ever-so-hard to reach the heights of epicness. \n\nIt should have been a mess... but it's not. It works. Somehow. It's hard to put my finger on it, but there's a level of composition skill and genuine expressiveness of emotion usually absent on these kinds of albums. Well, the term \"these kinds of albums\" is not very apt; there's nothing much that sounds like Wintersun's blend of prog, power and melodic death. But you know what I mean; those unabashedly pompous, often flowery and straining to be epic type of things. \n\nThe two openers are the closest to standard power metal. But the riffs, catchy as they are, are not easy to grab hold of. Unlike many power metal riffs, which start off catchy and get old really quickly, there's a depth and elusiveness to them. They kick, twist and writhe. The emphasis of particular riff doesn't quite fall where you expect it to; the tempo changes occur unexpectedly but not awkwardly. A large part of this is thanks to the excellent percussion, which is varied and expressive. For example, 'Winter Madness' opens with a power metal riff underpinned by blastbeats. Unusual in theory but it works. \n\nAnd the same is true for the rest of the album, though less rooted in power metal. But there's something else - that intangible quality of memorability and expressiveness which really does take this album to a level of epicness close to that intended by its writer. 'Sleeping Stars' embodies this. It's a Primordial-ish epic centred around a massive barrelling riff (though this is more of a lighter, proggier sound than Primordial's more doomish sound). Jari's vocals are excellent and diverse throughout too. \n\n'Battle Against Time' is probably the only weak track on the album. Aside from that, my only criticism is of the production which is a little too fluffy for my taste. I can understand how this can turn people off (and at the same time attract the dreaded newbie fanbase) but it's stomach-able for me at least. Asking for an symphonic, proggish epic without the fluffiness is probably like asking for french fries without potato, but I think a slightly rougher production could have been managed without sacrificing Jari's goals.\n",
        "\nWhenever a prominent musician decides to leave his current band and work on a wholly different project, it can be sure that their fans and detractors alike are braced to be cock-slapped with whatever fetid music they have envisioned; they descend down to another circle of hell all in the name of exercising their creativity. Wintersun's self titled debut did not have the same effect on the fanbase that Jari had gathered from his days with Ensiferum and as a whole has been warmly received by the metal community despite the fact it's pretty shit; most of the time at least.\n\n'Wintersun' is an oddity; at times it sounds like Jari had been listening to one too many Children of Bodom LPs (the early ones of course) and in other sections it is disturbingly reminiscent of Ensiferum, just without all the ghastly folk instruments pervading every square inch of the music. The two opening songs, \"Beyond the Dark Sun\" and \"Winter Madness\", are pretty fucking awesome; very majestic sounding melodic death metal. Again, the closest description I can think of is Children of Bodom's 'Hatebreeder' which is a compliment if you're thinking otherwise; there's nothing wrong with ball-bustingly fast riffs and solos with some exceptionally flamboyant but appropriate keyboards. Even the more melodic sections in \"Winter Madness\" seem to flow unhindered within the confines of the song and enhance it.\n\nAt this point of the album my cynicism gland kicked in and reminded me that the gentleman fronting this band had previously been in Ensiferum and thus, it was inevitable he'd cock this up somehow and by golly, he upped that cock with some legendary talent indeed. The remainder of the album can be split into two distinct species, songs that are; far too long or far too melodic.\n\nLet's tackle the first species of this decrepit pair; exceptionalis longus (note: I know absolutely no Latin. Consider this abuse of an ancient language as being artistic license or something). This creature isn't necessarily repulsive; at first glance songs such as \"Battle Against Time\" and \"Starchild\" hardly differ from the two aforementioned tracks and are quite enjoyable for the first four minutes or so. After this time though you've got the idea, and the riffs aren't being varied to such a degree to alleviate the glaringly obvious flaw that you've still got another three or four minutes of this to go. There are quite a few melodic and keyboard breaks throughout that have been wedged in as a rather limp-dicked effort at being epic, but hardly achieve what their entire purpose is based on.\n\nThe second species is far more numerous however and will at times exhibit similar initial attributes as the previous one; fast riffing, lots of decent keyboards and such (I was going to give this one a Latin name as well but it'd be the same as above except I was going to bastardise the word 'melodic'). Regardless, this species is far more guileful and will gush forth with a deluge of melodious keyboards and slower riffs that will send to sleep faster than a flunitrazepam martini (shaken, not stirred). \"Sleeping Stars\" and \"Death and Healing\" are the most devoid of any substance, being nothing more than an exercise in exhausting your patience by going through the typical melodic/ballad song structure. I can only assume that Wintersun are still trying to be epic but at this point in the album I'm finding my 1300 page book on university-level calculus to be far more enthralling.\n\nOn the whole though, there are just so many moments that are just irrevocably terrible; the (synth?) trumpets in the latter half of \"Starchild\", the stupid whispering over the ambient backdrop in the first half of \"Beautiful Death\" and the entirety of the song \"Sadness and Hate\". However if they aren't bowel-clenchingly bad then they're most likely to be completely redundant and in most cases they're detrimental to the overall quality, like a thorned appendix.\n\nI suppose the only real saving grace (besides the first two tracks) is that the musicians are extraordinarily talented and there are some amazing solos and lead work throughout the entire album. Even the faster riffs, despite their repetition and tendency to wear thin, are a great listen during the first couple of times they cycle through. The problem is that Wintersun suffer from trying far too hard to create an epic album when they could make an excellent, straight-up melodic death metal album; it would certainly be far greater than the usual gothenburg plague we've been weathering these past few years.\n\nThus in the name of wanking off to one's own superiority, we end up with Wintersun's self titled; an album that will appeal to if you couldn't get enough of early Children of Bodom and have an immense tolerance for soul-draining melodic songs/sections and keyboards. Also recommended for the hardcore BDSM crowd; the sounds emitted from this album will get your sub squealing louder than your other 'sounds'.\n",
        "\nThis is one of those rare albums that only happens once or twice a year. Something where you just think \"wow, where did this come from?\". Before 2004 there was absolutely no indication that this band would ever form, even though it had been in the works for almost a good 10 years. I was lucky enough to discover Wintersun back in the summer 2004, before the album release, on a sampler with the track \"Sleeping Stars\". I remember thinking how is it that a band this good is completely unknown to me and that I've never heard mention of them before. I could simply not believe that this was the first album of what was virtually a solo project.\n\nAnyway, these days Wintersun is well known in the metal community. The line-up has been augmented by Norther and Imperanon members, and there is a pretty respectable fanbase around the world. There are so many styles displayed on this album that it is no wonder that it was a ten year effort. There are also so many intricacies and small details in the music that three years later, I am still hearing small synth parts in the background on certain songs. This album has that much depth. There is such a high replay value on this album that it almost forgives the fact that the new CD has been delayed almost 2 years.\n\nThe main style of the music is fast and melodic metal with harsh vocals. But one should not that there are also excellent clean vocals, folk influences, black metal (though minimal), and progressive influences. A quick breakdown of the styles you will encounter on the tracks -\n\nBeyond the Dark Sun - fast, aggressive, melodic\nWinter Madness - fast, progressive, somewhat folky\nSleeping Stars - slow, melancholic, folky, epic\nBattle Against Time - fast, aggressive, almost vikingish at times\nDeath and the Healing - slow, melodic, clean vocals\nStarchild - progressive, technical, epic\nBeautiful Death - heavy, blackened influence, ambient (ending)\nSadness and Hate - slow, folky, heavy, melodic\n\nYou only get a small sense from the above list about how varied the album truly is. One need only look at the solos in Winter Madness, Death and the Healing, and Battle Against Time to see what a great lead guitarist/soloist Jari is (the sweep picking is inhumanly clean!). The genius of his songwriting and structures are seen on songs like Sleeping Stars and Starchild, where there is a longer story told in the songs, with tons of riffs that still form a coherent song. Other songs will show off Jari's vocals, be it the cleans on Death and the Healing and Sadness and Hate, or the harsh ones in Winter Madness and Beautiful Death. It would be fair to say that this cd displays mastery of vocals and guitar work in the metal genre. Did I mention that Jari also played synth and bass in addition?\n\nThe drumming is just as fantastic. When technical skill is called for, Kai Hahto delivers on all fronts, however he also has the restraint to never let the drums get in the way, especially on slower parts. The entire kit is used on almost every song, with so many good fills to transition between riffs that the flow of the album is completely flawless. The production is also great on this album. Very clear, but now so clear that it feels sterile. It is still dirty enough to make song s like Beautiful Death work, but still clean enough to make the guitar solos sound great. Mixing is also great, as I mentioned, there are many less important melodies and lines that can be heard in the background that are not very apparent at first, but after several listens are a nice enhancement and definitely help the replay value.\n\nThe style is itself hard to describe. Think Stratovarius meets Ensiferum meets Moonsorrow meets Yngwie Malmsteen. The riffs are generally very melodic with nice harmonies and several different guitar lines. Synth plays a small role, either backing the melodies with strings and choir, or doubling the lead guitar to create a different texture. The songs tend to follow a verse and chorus structure, but on several songs the verse and chorus riff never repeat, but are one continuous melody. On others the riffs are repeated but either have variations made to them or build up so that there is always something new happening. Interestingly, the end of Sadness and Hate is also a synth medley of several melodies from throughout the CD, a very good way of ending the CD.\n",
        "\nAlthough invoking the Viking rune of the sun and the winter that precedes Ragnar\u00f6k isn\u2019t in line with Finland\u2019s own collection of legends, they are a fitting title to describe the sounds canvassed onto this rather unique album. The artwork that introduces the prospective listener to it depicts a lone individual lying dead in the snow, his body positioned to reflect the final stagger of a broken soul condemned under a vicious winter sun. But the contents are what truly articulate this album\u2019s chilling sense of fate, futility, and the struggles of life.\n\nThe general flow of the album is a steady progression from simplicity and brevity to complexity and epic composition, as each track is progressively longer than the one preceding it. The longer each song gets, the more difficult the album gets to follow, as the songs\u2019 structures accumulate in complexity as well as duration. \u201cSadness and Hate\u201d has so many twists and turns that one could listen to it a dozen times back to back and still have a hard time recalling some of its many themes.\n\nAlthough Winter Sun functions as a full band, Jari M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4 plays all instruments but drums, which you wouldn\u2019t guess otherwise. The guitar sound is one of the most powerful and punchy I\u2019ve heard since MegaDeth\u2019s \u201cRust in Peace\u201d, and is not diminished by the occasional added effects. The leads invoke a variety of influences flawlessly, be it an impressive Yngwie-inspired Baroque style fill found early on in \u201cBeyond the Dark Sun\u201d, or the tinny exotic clean solo that closes out \u201cBeautiful Death\u201d. The keyboards go mostly for atmosphere, but are heavily present, almost to the point of giving the music a slight Sonata Arctica sound at times.\n\nThe vocals, likewise, give the impression of an ensemble of 6 vocalists as they vary constantly. The clean singing creates the perfect set of dialogues and foils for the heavily present harsh lead vocals, which don\u2019t limit themselves to atonal barks but also occasionally imitate Rob Halford and King Diamond. \u201cWinter Madness\u201d and \u201cStarchild\u201d have the most frequent dialogues and change-ups, all following suit from the rapid pace set by the music, the latter having an incredibly catchy yet somber chorus.\n\nIt\u2019s extremely tough to pick out one song as a favorite out of this extremely impressive set of atmospherically dense melodic death opuses. \u201cBeyond the Dark Sun\u201d takes the lead for the most powerful main riff, which I still can\u2019t get out of my head, and will likely be the easiest song to follow out of the lot. \u201cDeath and the Healing\u201d is definitely the most mellow and melancholy, while \u201cStarchild\u201d makes the most effective use of Jari\u2019s folk inspired melodies. To this day I still can\u2019t decide on a particular song as being above the rest, making track skipping a non-issue.\n\nFans of Ensiferum, In Flames, Into Eternity, Skyfire, Children of Bodom and Amon Amarth will all probably enjoy this album, perhaps in most cases more than said bands. It definitely has crossover appeal to power/thrash metal fans, as I was instantly taken in by this when I heard it. Although most will question the necessity of the former front man of a band starting a new one with a similar style, I think the more music of this caliber, the merrier.\n",
        "\nA very cohesive, well-polished, and masterfully performed record. Where to start? The riffs are fast, aggressive, and edgy, yet they are still melodic and folk driven. Jari, the mastermind behind the album who recorded all but the drums for it, seems to have found close to that perfect balance between extreme and melodic which so many other bands appear to be struggling with today. His vocals and impeccably clear, yet rough enough to not be \"poppy\" and his use of choral vocals and the mixing of screams with singing is great. Much diversity in the vocals, gotta love that. \n\nUnfortunately, not much diversity elsewhere. He seems to think that one riff can make about 2 1/2 songs worth of good material, which is definitely not the case. Some of the songs feel pretty rehashed by the end of the album (listen to the staggered riff in \"Starchild\" and compare it to \"Beyond the Darkened Sun\", you'll see what I mean). But, that aside there is much melody and cool stuff abound and the album is sure to please even if it does get a little repetitive. \n\nAnother cool thing about the album is the all around feel of it. The production is sleek, and very clean which gives it a cold and mechanical sound, which fits the theme of the lyrics, and the band name, quite well. On a side note, the lyrics are great too and really capture the struggle Jari went through during his band transition from Ensiferum to Wintersun. The folk melodies also remind the listener of Nordic tunes and winter etc. ; all in all it's a very cool effect. I also personally enjoyed the speed and accuracy of his playing; not all guitar players are created (or practice) equally and Jari most certainly is a master of the instrument. Along with the hyper-fast keyboard fills. Gotta love those.\n\nIn summation, if you are a fan of power metal of any kind, check it out and don't be afraid of the harsh vocals. If you are an extreme metal fan, don't be afraid of the melody and keyboards, there are lots of very extreme moments (and songs) and it's a very emotionally packed and aggressive album. And if you like both worlds like me, then are you waiting for?! Go buy this album now!\n",
        "\nThis is it? THIS is the source of all that hype? What's wrong with this world?\n\nEveryone was creaming their pants over this one, so I figured I'd pick it up to see what all the fuss was about. Well, several listens later, I still don't know what all the fuss is about. This album is painfully average all the way through, and while it's definitely worth getting, there's nothing here that justifies the kind of worship it's been getting. Jari should have stuck with Ensiferum. Ensiferum wasn't (and still isn't) all that great, but their stuff is a hell of a lot more fun than this.\n\nThe album kicks off with \"Beyond the Dark Sun,\" which opens with a speedy, \"melodeath\" riff. No need to pay much attention to that riff, you'll hear it again. And again. And again. \"Battle Against Time\" uses a modification of it, \"Starchild\" is driven by a choppier version of it, and so on. What drags this album down more than anything else is sheer repetition, so much so that the only headbanging you'll be doing is pounding your head against a wall.\n\nAnyway, \"Beyond the Dark Sun\" isn't too memorable, but it's a pretty nice, speedy little song, less than three minutes in length. Then every subsequent song is over the five minute mark, with all but two topping seven minutes and one lasting over ten. And there's no reason for that. Most of those songs could have been half their length, easily. But no, this is an \"Epic Melodic Death Metal\" band, and we all know that \"epic\" means \"long fucking songs.\" Not just long fucking songs, but pointlessly long fucking songs. And if you have to be reptitive to do it, then so be it, because the gods of metal do not smile on concision. Good lord. It's not artful, it's not \"thinking man's metal,\" it's just stupid.\n\nThere are many songs that are both long and deserving of their length. None of them happen to be on this album.\n\nThen there's the production. Now, I'm no stickler for rawness, and I don't mind slick production, but damn, this is TOO slick. There's absolutely no crunch at to the guitars, and the bass is just...there. But it sounds so \"cold\" and fits the mood, say the fanboys. Well, the fact is, it doesn't sound \"cold,\" it sounds mechanical and lifeless. There are some blisteringly fast parts to some of these songs, but the production manages to suck out all the intensity out of the whole thing. Some riffs on this album, for all their repetition, could be pretty lethal if the guitar tone wasn't so blah. The whole black metal obsession with underproduction is pretty moronic, but Jari really went too far the other way.\n\nWith all that said, it's not really all that bad. There are some pretty catchy parts, and it'd probably be a halfway decent album if the songs were shorter (or just better-written), the production better, and the content a little more varied. As it is, it's still a good listen, although it gets a little boring if you try to sit through the whole thing. Worth picking up, certainly.\n\nBottom line: If you've got the disposable income, there are worse albums to spend your money on. It's slightly above average folk-ish metal with some fairly blatant Children of Bodom influences, and it's definitely worth listening to. But classic? Perfect? Hah, no. Not even close. What the hell are you smoking?\n",
        "\nDoes the name Jari Maenpaa mean anything to you? Probably not. But if you're into metal, particularly power or folk metal, chances are you've heard some of his material. For Jari was once the frontman and guitarist of Ensiferum, one of Viking metal's most recognizable groups. Now, Ensiferum is quite obviously a very good band as proven by excellent offerings such as their s/t or Iron, yet despite this Jari still felt that his new solo project, Wintersun, was higher on his priority list. When the recording of Wintersun's s/t conflicted with the touring of Ensiferum, the guitarist/vocalist decided enough was enough and parted ways with his Viking metal friends. And he had to have felt his new solo work was stronger then that of the promising Ensiferum. And while this all boils down to personal opinion, I believe Jari made the correct decision for as good as Ensiferum might be, Wintersun is stronger.\n\nThe album cover off Wintersun's debut album portrays a cold winter night, probably in the wilderness of Maenpaa's home country of Finland. A figure can be seen lying in the snow, frozen in the snow. It's quite a mysterious, yet beautiful painting. The music on Wintersun is quite similar to its album art. Combining the likes of neoclassical metal, folk metal, power metal, black metal, and melodic death metal, Jari Maenpaa is able to create a sound that is both very bleak and cold sounding, yet at the same time, has a mystical attractiveness to it. The melodious guitars or keyboards, as heard in say Starchild or Death and the Healing, create an excellent, often epic atmosphere from which Wintersun can draw momentum from, moulding the song into a five to ten minute song in which Jari makes use of musical passages akin to progressive metal or the folk metal sound he played in Ensiferum. Armed with a plethora of long tracks, Jari has plenty of room to show his skill, both vocally, instrumentally and song writing-wise. Maenpaa has the whole harsh vocal aspect down pat, as those who knew him from Ensiferum would know. His shrieks convey the emotion and power required to make such a production successful, and along with the guitars and keyboards, they are very high in the mix. The clean singing, on the other hand, is not quite as refined. Unlike Jari's powerful screams, which command the attention of the listener, his clean vocals are more passive sounding and low in the mix. They don't impact the music as effectively as some of Jari's shrieks; they're just kind of there. They aren't all that bad, especially in a song like Death and the Healing, but they aren't as strong has the harsh vocals.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, the songs off of the Wintersun album display very strong song writing skills. The combined runtime of the eight tracks which are featured on the band's debut album is 54 minutes, including five tracks exceed the 7 minute mark. But Jari Maenpaa has done an excellent job ensuring that the several long songs are entertaining and exciting. For the various interludes, solos, and melodic passages are very tasteful and Jari rarely, if ever resorts to mindless noodling to get the job done. Death and the Healing is one song where this is the case. Made up of slower, depressing melodies which flow exceedingly well, the song creates an atmosphere reflected by the track's title. The calm, soothing melodies are especially fun to listen to and once again replicate the epic atmosphere that the album art stresses. Wintersun shows off some of its metal diversity with songs like Winter Madness and Beautiful Death. While both tracks are based around fast, up tempo riffing, Winter Madness is more of a nod toward Maenpaa's power metal background, while Beautiful Death better reflects the black metal influences in the band's sound. Fans of both genres should enjoy the emphasis placed on both sounds, as they are very well put together and enjoyable tracks to listen to. \n\nThough he was leaving a very promising Viking metal band, in recording this album Jari Maenpaa looks to have himself and the rest of the newly formed Wintersun quite the future. With influences ranging from folk metal, to black metal, to progressive metal, to power metal, the band's sound is very likeable and easy to get into. The music itself is very melodic and emotional, be it soothing or cold; aggressive or slower; harsh or calm; and encompasses a variety of atmospheres and themes. Fans of Ensiferum or Children of Bodom should give Wintersun a shot as should anybody looking to delve deeper in that of the respective genres in which Wintersun employs. Superb album all around.\n\n(Originally written for Sputnikmusic)\n",
        "\nWintersun caught my attention some time ago when I began finding interest in metal that focused on epic and melodic elements, and of course, this was what Jari M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4's reincarnation appeared to be. Aside from the cool artwork and gimmick, I was simply stunned by all the positive things said about Wintersun's self-titled debut. The never-ending worship convinced me this was an album of the ages, but my assumption was a grave error. There has been a lot of praise hovering around Wintersun\u2019s first CD since its release, but my experience with the album is far different from the majority. Some would say Wintersun plays an epic style of melodic death metal that warms the soul with its beauty, but the group is just a bland project attempting to sound wondrous without any structure or meaning in the harshest reality.\n\nThe biggest blunder here isn't the music, but the way the songs are written. M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4 can clearly perform multiple instruments with ease, but all his talent is simply buried underneath poor musical formation. With the exception of \"Beyond The Dark Sun,\" each track is forged upon a series of melodic riffs being used again and again, the same drum pattern with an occasional fill, and a few predictable leads. The time length for all but one of the songs reaches past five minutes with \"Sadness And Hate\" hitting the ten minute marker, which is simply ridiculous considering the dull structure of each track. The music itself seems very good at hindsight, but it just keeps going in the same boring direction until the listener is caught in a REM cycle. The only song worth mentioning is \u201cBeyond The Dark Sun,\u201d which contains rapid melodic riffs, rich keyboard harmonies, and blistering solos all performed at flashing speed. The remaining seven tunes transform into sickening abominations of repetitive music, dull vocals, and half-assed epic misfortunes that might induce a coma.\n\nI find it hard to digest the music, but the vocals lead to a massive bowel movement of messy composition and dreadful execution that simply destroys core parts of this album. Jari M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4 applies two vocal techniques throughout Wintersun's debut: shrieking and singing, but he manages to screw both of them up. Jari's shrieks are incredibly annoying and appear to be a bit forced considering the musical atmosphere. The clean voice sounds great, but it's typically placed in sloppy arrangements without any formulated patterns or texture. You can be the greatest vocalist in the world, but randomly tossing lyrics in the air isn't a smart thing to do, and that's exactly what happens here with M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4's singing voice.\n\nI\u2019ve listened to Wintersun\u2019s debut countless times, and I still don\u2019t understand why this record gets so much praise. I originally believed in all the hype Wintersun had obtained, but my view on the band has voluminously changed after hearing this disdainful record. It may be tempting to check this one out, but I challenge anyone who plans on buying Wintersun\u2019s self-titled CD to put their purchase on hiatus and consider different opinions.\n",
        "\nWhen I first heard this album by Finnish band Wintersun, born from the carcass of Ensiferum, I was immediately entranced by its brilliance. Wintersun is an album of incomparable depth, packed with variety and ear-bleeding brilliance on so many levels. It certainly ranks among the finest metal albums I have ever heard. It is all the more amazing then that this is the band\u2019s first album.\n\n\nWintersun is an exquisite composition of metal. It is extremely difficult to pigeonhole the genre into one specific category. There are strong elements of power metal in the music, with heavily symphonic keyboards and savagely fast drums and guitar riffs, but there are also many black metal style aspects to Wintersun, with its harsh vocals and heavy sounds. I have categorized it as Viking power metal, because of its style and lyrical themes, which evoke images of Vikings, the cosmos and winter. This album is an extremely unique offering, which is totally different to almost anything I have ever heard. \n\n\nFrom the first song of Wintersun, the brief \u2018Beyond the Dark Sun\u2019, the album drips with quality and imagination. It has a superb, epic sound, which at times is brutal and angry, as in the first two tracks. In other cases, such as the superb \u2018Sleeping Stars\u2019, the music is soaring, melodic, entrancing and bewitching. The lamenting cries of Jari M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4 are supremely passionate and remorseful, despite the harsh vocals, which is far more than can be said for the attempts of most such bands to achieve an epic sound. He also displays a fantastic singing voice, which is peircing and deep.\n\n\nThroughout, Wintersun is majestic and powerful, with incredible guitar riffs that actually sound like some kind of lonely Viking melody which was played on a wintery coast hundreds of years ago. This album invokes so much emotion and passion for a metal album, managing to get the balance between brutality and beauty just right. Wintersun continually segues savage war cries into heart-rending melodies, creating a sublime metal masterpiece. If you are a fan of metal of any kind, I recommend you buy this album now, and support a fantastic band.\n",
        "\nMost I've heard from so far mentioning Wintersun have originally been lead to hearing Wintersun through the separation of Ensiferum's genius, Jari, and Ensiferum. I feel alone in this sense, because I stumbled across Wintersun, completely oblivious to the existence of Ensiferum. This could be construed as sad, but fear not, there is back-story reasoning behind my lack of knowledge of Ensiferum, and that can be present in an upcoming new review for Ensiferum's debut album. \n\nNow to start. What can I say about this album, other than, perfect? \n\nTo start off with, possibly the most out-shot aspect of this album is the sheer faultlessness of the drums and guitars. This album is a symphony of crystal-clear riffing, flawless drumming, and untiring vocals, and it's surely noticeable to any skeptic of Viking Metal potential. It's not like any other typical melodic death metal band, simply because of the amount of folk influence that is present in this album. Quite obviously all the influence comes from Jari's Viking musical ways of life, seeing as he composes everything on this album, but adding to the super-aggressive drumming and riffing, and also the technicality of the guitar and keyboard solos to typical viking folk melodies creates only one thing in my books: Perfection. \n\nBeing a guitarist, I'm obviously going to look for stringed integrity in any music I hear, other than Black Metal, which is something I listen to for different reasons. But quite simply said, the guitar solos present on this album are simply superb, if not completely and utterly perfect. At impecable 3/4 pace, the guitar solos present a mixture of melodic arpeggiated progressions and red-hot licks that just really get your head moving in a hard head-banging circular motion. The riffs, also outlining the backing synths and vocals, create a much more aggressive approach to the melodic side of the songs. The tone of the guitar is very dry, yet fat, and every note is perfectly audio and lyrical in it's own sense, rather than the cacophonic guitar work of about 99% of all Death Metal bands. The thing I absolutely loved during my observation of this band's combinations, was that the drums accentuate the guitars, and at the same time, the guitars are accentuating the drums, all the while being sprinkled with the rusted melancholic aural orgasm that is Jari's voice. \n\nSecond of all is the vocals. Now, seeing as I had not heard any Ensiferum prior to hearing this mastery, I did not know what to associate the vocals with. But all I know was the mixture of very harsh high-range screaming alternating with high-range raspy power yells and choiric vocals created JUST the perfect atmosphere to accompany the Epic Melodic sound. Jari's vocal ability is quite diverse in fact, He has a very deep singing voice, can pull of about any type of scream, and has quite an impressive high-range singing voice. Again, another star on the black-board for these guys, right next to the perfection of the guitar work...Let's see if the other three star outlines can be filled... \n\nThirdly come the drums. My god. Wonderful. Superb. Bravo, Kai, bravo. You've outdone yourself. This guy has a very impressive endurance rate when it comes to blast-beating and double-bass. His gravity blasts and basic blasts are perfect. Adding to these most stand-out aspects, is that it's being played just the way I fucking love it: Hard and fucking fast. So much anger comes out of this guy's drum sticks, and it's so blatantly punching you on both sides of the head when you're sitting between two speakers that are bellowing out this musical mastery that is Wintersun. \n\nFourthly comes the keyboards and synths. Again, this is another set of instruments in the band that is at a perfect level; it's not drowning out the guitars, but the guitars aren't drowning out the kayboards. It's perfectly audible, yet still exaultedly accentuates the crisp crunch of the guitar riffs and solos. My favourite keyboard effort is still track 1, \"Beyond the Dark Sun\" at exactly 0:17 comes the guitar/keyboard dual arpeggios. Perfect. The guitar was still perfectly audible, and so were the keyboards, yet you can still easily tell the dominant force was the guitar, which is how it is supposed to be, unlike the right honourable epitomy of homosexuality, Rhapsody, who feel the need to drown out every soundwave of guitars with keyboards. Don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of Rhapsody, but god they piss me off sometimes. But anyway... \n\nAnd finally, the production and sound effort. Every deci`bel of every form of gain and frequency in this album is levelled perfectly. A lot of viking metal or death metal albums that I've heard have had red-line gain jumps, and they hurt your ears like fuck. Whether it be a high-pitched scream, or a distorted, over-forced flute solo, or just the guitar pinched-harmonics, whatever. This album has none of these problems at all. Every second of every track seems to be secured with an orange-line frequnecy level, which doesn't let anything jump out and anal-fuck your ear drums to the point of ear-perforation. Being a sort of self-proclaimed audio engineer myself, I generally look out for safe-level frequencies in metal albums. Because I do enjoy hearing, and too many bands I've listened to have nearly jeopardised this blessing. But no, this album is perfect sound-wise, and it has been mixed to my liking 100% of the way. \n\nThe about wraps up the review on the instruments and playing, and lastly: \n\nIn conclusion: Fuck yeah. \n\nI strongly recommend this album to everybody in existence, but seeing as 90% of those people are close-minded pop-heads, I recommend this album strongly to every metal head in existence. It is purely perfect in every way, and provides something for every type of metal head: The synths, keyboards, solos and double-bass supremacy for the Power Metal heads; the harsh vocals for the Death Metal and Black Metal heads, as well as the technical drum work and blistering guitar solos; the all-round folk influence for the Viking/Folk Metal heads (such as myself); and just the basic mastery that milks you of every drop of semen that you contain. Or for any other type of Metal head that actually has a brain...Or a sex drive. \n\nGet it, or die in eternal misery and pain due to your body's deprivation of this fine piece of ass...I mean art...by Wintersun. \n\nWintersun - Wintersun: 100/100 \n\n-Morbicae, 2007.\n",
        "\nIf you could only fathom how floored I was when I learned that members of Rhapsody and Ensiferum had joined forces with the one and only Yngwie J. Malmsteen, to bring forth the super group of all metal super groups. Later, it was brought to my attention that Children Of Bodom's very own Alexi Laiho had closed the books on his highly acclaimed band to hook up with none other than Finntroll. Such events will undoubtedly house some of the most spine-tingling music ever to be put on tape. Okay, so you caught me! Both of the previous statements were indeed falsified, but I meant well. At least now you have a pretty accurate understanding of what lies ahead when you listen to Wintersun's bewildering eight track debut album.\n\nThe self-titled disc is an unprecedented neo-folk shredfest from former Ensiferum main man, Jari M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4. Revealing just how adept he is, Jari wrote, recorded, and produced the entire record with no more assistance than a session drummer (courtesy of Rotten Sound's Kai Hahto) and his own staggering talents. He sings, screams, plays guitar and keys; Who knew the man was capable of so much? Certainly not this kid. I would have to reluctantly presume this is what initially led to his departure from Ensiferum. He clearly needed to focus his efforts on a band that would allow him to fully showcase his potential and ability.\n\nThere really isn't a whole lot about Wintersun that my doctored description doesn't already convey. Just take my word for it when I tell you that this is one of the most breathtaking debut offerings to grace the scene in a very long time. Between the headlines over at Nuclear Blast reading 'The powerful and majestic rebirth of former Ensiferum vocalist, Jari M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4!' and Norther vocalist Petri Lindroos joining Ensiferum to fill Jari's shoes as the momentary front man, this should garner up some much deserved attention for all three bands.\n",
        "\nFirstly, I would like to state that I am an advocate of folk and viking metal, and enjoy acts like Falkenbach, Ensiferum and Lumsk. Immensely.\n\nThis is something very different indeed.\n\nI first heard of Wintersun when I bought a Nuclear Blast CD in September '04, and when I saw the cover art for this album within the promo leaflet, I immediately fell in love with it. I'd start listing it as my favourite cover art all over the place despite having never heard any Wintersun material at this stage.\n\nI became determined to own the album after downloading Beautiful Death from Kai's website. Back then, I despised growled vocals and absolutely loathed all black and death metal. However, this was intriguing enough to get me to look into it more deeply. A harshly-sung song I liked? It was still something alien to me.\n\nHaving bought the album, I started to have one or two initial regrets - \"I don't even like death metal, what am I doing?\" - but once the CD arrived, I noticed the plain white slipcase with metallic blue text, and once again flared up with enthusiasm for Wintersun. I dashed to a computer and immediately ripped the CD.\n\nBeyond The Dark Sun is the shortest track on the album. However, it works very well, and has an excellent beat to it. The vocals at the beginning are simply Jari speaking, but they quickly evolve into fully-fledged death metal vocals, and his voice is transformed. This may well be one of the fastest and most catchy songs on the album, but the ending left me a bit cold... It's a long shot, but I'd love for an extended version of this song to crop up in the future.\n\nWinter Madness is very technical. The drumming, guitars and keyboards are all insane - The vocals are probably the harshest on the album, save Sadness and Hate. It wasn't my favourite track on this cd by any means, but that doesn't stop it from being a very nice piece of work. It's only about a minute twenty into the song that it really picks up, and the singing is clear enough for one to hear the lyrics properly. There's also a nice melodic, harmonious singing interlude that crops up occasionally. Not much else to say, other than that this song has one of the best choruses I've ever heard.\n\nSleeping Stars is the antipode of Winter Madness, in effect. The harmonised clean vocals are as prominent than the growled ones, but they're both still in there. It has a slightly symphonic feel to it, and it's very slow and epic in this manner. There are some great guitar spots in here, and it's quite a bit more rythmic (and less progressive) than some of the other songs here.\n\nBattle Against Time is, in my opinion, not one of the better tracks on the album. It's quite progressive, but this doesn't stop it from getting slightly boring at parts. It's also the only song on the album I couldn't really \"get into\"... Only really a listen for when you're bored of the other tracks.\n\nDeath and the Healing is *fantastic*, mark my words. It's a mellow, vaguely symphonic ballad about the cruelty of the wilderness, and - my favourite part of this song - it's sung entirely in clean vocals. This was the easiest track for me to enjoy when I first listened to the album. And the chorus is amazingly melodic and well-sung. The lyrics are kinda... Not as good as some of the others, but it's still one of the superior tracks on the album. One of the only memorable guitar solos is in here, too, and it's a wonderful one at that.\n\nStarchild... The only album divided into separate parts like any decent, age-long prog-metal piece. Each section sounds quite different to any of the others, and this is without a doubt the most \"epic\" song on here. Worth a good, long hour of listening and re-listening.\n\nBeautiful Death begins with distorted background noise, and then tells you loud and clear that it's going to be the most brutal song on the whole cd. At points, the singing is completely out of sync with the instruments, and it sounds really quite good. This song has more expressionless growls and screams than any of the other tracks on the CD.\n\nSadness and Hate is a stunning end track to what I consider one of the best albums of all time. It's packed with emotion, and gets better and better as the song progresses, climaxing with the expressionless, ambient soundscape that ended Beautiful Death. If any other song was ever so melancholic and had as much effort poured into it as this, I must hear it. Now.\n\nDefinitely a must-have for Ensiferum fans. Essential for prog-metal fanatics looking for something different.\n"
