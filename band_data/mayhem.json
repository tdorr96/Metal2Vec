        "\nI've slammed modern Mayhem before for being dull and one-dimensional, but it seems with this song that they actually got it right. The single begins with an interesting riff that harkens back to the band's hey day and delivers energy that is a positive shock considering Mayhem's abundance of creative stagnancy. As well as this, the song carries this energy throughout, with some ominous riffs that progress with increasing amounts of harmony in the song, and Attila's vocals have a noticeable amount of power behind them. There is a substantial point in the middle of the song where things slow down and the guitars play an isolated, depressive riff that transitions into a very strong section where the focus is on the impact without sacrificing the intriguing atmosphere of the songs. \n\nThe highlight of Black Glass Communion however, is quite easily Hellhammer's performance. Even though the drums have been known for being the best aspect of Mayhem since Gro Harlem Brundtland was Norway's prime minister, the drum patterns here particularly show an effective use of swing and articulation to contribute to the quality of the riffs without sacrificing the driving rhythm of the song. Essentially, Hellhammer's playing style is tight but loose here at the same time, and doesn't resort to mindless blasting (of course there is some for good measure). As a whole, this single stands out as captivating among a sea of comparatively dull-sounding music that Mayhem usually produces, and while the still flat production that limits the dynamics dampens the song, it's still worth listening to for some strong presentation of sinister and powerful black metal.\n",
        "\nMayhem are known for being consistently bad since the turn of the century with their sophomore album that brought nothing but dry, bland black metal in the purest sense, and it hasn't changed since. Voces Ab Alta reeks of a lack of development, with 2 riffs that repeat on and on, with the only change in the song being at the end, with a progression into a slower, more brooding section. However, these riffs are poor, because in black metal, what makes the music truly memorable and interesting is an invocation of emotions, whether it be depressive or fearful or simply beautiful. The guitar work in Voces Ab Alta fails on all of these fronts, delivering only SpOoKy riffs that are mind-numbingly dull and don't really vary in texture whatsoever.\n\nThis gives the single an extremely flat sound, which really isn't improved by the drums that quite literally consist of a continuous blast beat that only changes in tempo, again with the only deviation being at the end with some passable fills and patterns among the slower and more developed guitar outro. The flat production really doesn't help this at all, with an irritating clash of the rhythm and lead sections that result in a compressed mess and guitars that are raw in a bad way, lacking any form of character or sharpness which was what made early Mayhem so distinct. Giving this some thought, it's understandable why the band would want to distance themselves from their roots, but come on guys, don't do it this way.\n",
        "\nAs fascinating as the mystique, mayhem, drama, and the conundrum of suicide, cannibalism, Metal purist elitism gone wildly awry, the second most shocking thing about Mysteriis, is that this remains an incredible record that stands tall in its insatiable pursuit of atmosphere and brutality. Debuting with the legendary (and ridiculously innovative) Deathcrush EP in 87, the quality and progression within the brute force was glaringly obvious, and this long awaited and troubled (to say the very fucking least) release, once again is another astonishing force of Metallic grimness and brute force. Does it excuse all the silly ass drama that ensued before, during, and after it's conception? Nope, but the final product is incredibly cohesive, poignant, and really well crafted in it's madness, so I guess I gotta join the hype machine and admit, this shit shreds. With an especially spiritual, boisterous, and finesse vigor in it's craft, if we can get any positivity out of this bands ridiculous legacy, this record (as well as Deathcrush) should be it.\n\nBrick as fuck frost bitten tremolo riffage is blasting away before the record even begins, \"Funeral Fog\" is an intensely boisterous call to attack. Attila's sneers sound more like a plastered Dave Mustaine, totally feeble compared to his work on the phenomenal Tormentor tapes, but everyone else is firing from all cylinders. The slightly dissonant inclusion of melody layers the cacophonous chaos, and nearly every riff just steamrolls the previous one. The drumming is absolutely ferocious. I hype up the Napalm Death drumming (especially Mick Harris) any chance I can get. Well Hellhammer isn't only just as phenomenal, but the mothafucka lets it rip for five plus minutes, instead of those brisk under a minute blasts. Switching to a jaw dropping bleak arpeggio, the atmosphere in \"Freezing Moon\" is just monstrous, the ensuing syncopation recalls the awesome grooves of the Deathcrush EP, and the layered riffing Euronomous is an impressive blast of agility and ambience. The below zero atmosphere plunges further during the break, and yeah the solo is epic as fuck. Attila again being the weak link doesn't extinguish the inspired chaos. A dramatic sense of melody laced with dissonant fragments open \"Cursed in Eternity\", and Hellhammer's performance here is blasted with incredible endurance and detail to make the discord all the more appealing. The angular layers make the Voivod fanboy such as myself sufficiently satisfied, and the resulting leads are scalding despite all the frigidness. Another fully compact blast of controlled chaos, dig that dissonant jerk back into the impressive final explosion of speedy mayhem. A nice return to the angular riffage, \"Pagan Fears\" is driving and powerful from the get go, and Euronomous' style with another show stopping Hellhammer showcase of agility, keep this from being too monotonous. Again the riffs are solid as they are furious, and crafted with finessed changes and ambience, adding an abundance of mood and texture to the icy racket that many bands in the genre are incapable of producing.\n\nBlistering crashing again opening the second half just like the opening track of the first, the volution to the potent moody Bathory excursions recall \"Enter the Eternal Fire\". Matter of fact this is a good ,if not exactly great copy of that epic. The stinging droning leads are similar as well, although that head bang inducing mosh riff in the center is fucking fire, and the ensuing melodic passage is equally as epic, even drunken Attila almost doesn't ruin the vibe. Even the first stumble of the record has some ridiculously consistent section. A labyrinth of guitar lines open up \"From the Dark Past\", and again the Voivodesque dissonance meticulously appearing makes the blasting even more enthralling and powerful. The track kinda dwindles down after Hellhammer's legendary drum fill, but the energy and incredible playing persist throughout. Bestial Sarcofago levels of speed and mayhem burst to a incredibly crescendo as \"Buried by Time and Dust\" speeds away. Shriekingly atmospheric leads and explosions maintain the mayhem, and the gloomy atmosphere reverberates through the battlefield. And dig that final blast, dropping in like prime era Kreator, a definite highlight of the latter half. Damn I spoke to soon the iconic title track is a proficiently crafted constant barrage of power and ferociousness. The opening riff is chilling, atmospheric and angular, the remainder is a truly savage display of being evil and not giving a fuck, seriously Hellhammer and Eurononous make some of this shit look easy, but they craft in this pandemonium is structured and more intricately composed than it seems. Oh and Attila gets to sing. Don't worry the rest of the band ensure I don't have the stupid smirk off my face. Vargs buzzing bass reverberates as the archetypical melody of the genre calls the madness to a close.\n\nI'll still keep my Bathory, Bulldozer, Sarcofago, Tormentor and Hellhammer (the band ya dolt) records at the top of my Black Metal pantheon (although shoutout to Beherit, Blasphemy, and Darkthrone), but damn if this isn't a consistent and powerful release. Revolutionary in extrapolating the genre, and almost as impressive as the Emperor debut released a few months prior. Lacking the grandiosely orchestrated massive wall of sound, of In the Nightside, De Mysteriis nevertheless attains the surrealistic mystique and disciplined brutality on their own terms. The band fully accomplished their goal of making the most pure Black Metal experience on wax, just too bad that the bodies would pile up from all that progress. Ignore the rep (and the silliest music war next to the East/West Coast Hip Hop beef that happened soon after), and check it for yourself, then go backwards and seek out Deathcrush again. Hey I wrote the whole review without mentioning Varg, aw fuck... never mind. \n\nFave Blasts: Funeral Fog, Freezing Moon,Cursed Eternity, Pagan Fears, De Mysteries Dom Sathanas\n",
        "\nThis was probably what most of the fans of extreme music did not expect at the time - the true Mayhem hit in 1997 with something new! These \"something new\" is the ep entitled \"Wolf's Lair Abyss\" recorded in a changed line-up, where next to Hellhammer there were old friends, i.e. Necrobutcher and Maniac, and a completely new one for the band Blasphemer. In this line-up, the Norwegians recorded surprisingly fresh material, although still extreme in the old way. So with the darkness of \"De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\", but also with novelties (as a prelude to \"Grand Declaration Of War\"). Above all, it was supposed to create a music that would fit into the name of Mayhem. And it fitted, because it did not discourage the (transformed) band from further activities and did not cause too many threats from the most true fans.\n\n\"Wolf's Lair Abyss\" is - despite its modest volume - a clear step forward. There are, for example, a new style of guitar parts (more technical), as intense as Hellhammer's drumming on the debut, Maniac's crazy vocals (although a few clean ones also appear here - and for some it was too much!), transparent production or emanating from the music \"mechanical cold\". The upcoming new direction works great with songs like \"Symbols Of Bloodswords\", \"The Vortex Of Inhumanity\" (this one is just an electronic intro) and \"I Am Thy Labirynth\", but also where the band focuses on the extreme side, i.e. in \"Fall Of Seraphs\" and \"Ancient Skin\" - where blasting is perfectly intertwined with the aforementioned \"mechanical cold\". But that's the end of a broader description of \"Wolf's...\", because the whole ep is just 5 songs. Though maybe not just, but even 5 songs. Well, this music of the Norwegians here has descended into much less obvious regions, emanates more chaos and can boast elements that are quite rare in black metal (I am talking about all those avant-garde freaks in terms of vocals and electronics). Because this somehow had to prepare for the second, full album with many experiments. \n\nAfter the content of \"Wolf's Lair Abyss\" one can understand even more fully such a big stylistic leap, which took place 3 years later on \"Grand Declaration Of War\". This ep is a great link between the one of the most important Mayhem albums, and at the same time it shows the genesis where the Norwegians want to experiment very boldly. The risk paid off, although with a lot of controversy.\n\nOriginally on: https://subiektywnymetal.blogspot.com/2020/04/mayhem-wolfs-lair-abyss-1997.html\n",
        "\nMany interesting anecdotes are associated with \"De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\", but one of the most important is that this album became a cult before it was even released! Of course, the envelope and numerous personal scuffles had their way there, but most importantly, the music did not suffer any harm - unless we take a look into these absurd \"extremisms\". First of all, the style of Mayhem - although it may evoke pity (see above) - had its unmistakable style and its own idea for black metal. So it's no wonder they succied on a global scale. Different story is about much older \"Deathcrush\", whose cult seems to be a bit overhauled. Heresy? Well, maybe so, but before you start discussions in the private messages, keep in mind the level of Bathory's pre-87 'albums and \"Inri\" Sarc\u00f3fago from the same year. Compared to these releases, \"Deathcrush\" lags significantly behind. \n\nThis ep just (too) aged too much. On \"Deathcrush\" the music of Euronymous and his band was characterized by much less finesse and awareness of the thud that was created, and at the same time it did not have such power and ideas for the atmosphere as on their subsequent releases. To put it simply, this ep is a combination between black and thrash (and maybe death?) metal, very non-complicated songs, with usually quite fast drums, barely audible bass, hardly audible riffs and very noisy vocals of Maniac and Messiah (distant from what the first of them later lit up). Definitely the best here are \"Chainsaw Gutsfuck\", \"Pure Fucking Armageddon\" and the title track, the most catchy, heavily concert-like and captivating with youthful verve and \"underground-drunken\" atmosphere. In addition, the electronic, looped intro of \"Silvester Anfag\" is also nice, although it's a curiosity compared to the other tracks. \n\nSimple conclusions from these heresies. \"Deathcrush\" is a great piece of music with very raw and uncouth, extreme sounds. In my opinion, although on subsequent releases the Norwegians turned out much more intriguing than here, but by \"Deathcrush\" you can get to know the earliest times of the Euronymous band in decent quality. \n\nOriginally on: https://subiektywnymetal.blogspot.com/2020/04/mayhem-deathcrush-1987.html\n",
        "\nThe time preceding the release of \"Daemon\" is primarily a time of tribute to \"De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\" in the form of very numerous concerts. However, it did not end at the live concerts from this period. Well, one gets the impression that while composing the discussed album...the attachment to the sounds from \"De Mysteriis...\" remained as high and was the main idea of creating these songs. So the conclusions from this are simple, \"Daemon\" is the first safe and without major changes album, which was included in the discography of Mayhem. \n\nBut there's nothing particularly wrong with that! - not at the period of publishing this album. It's difficult to expect that the band will discover its new face over and over again, especially that it appeared several times in 00-07 years - and it's worth to add, that it aroused a lot of controversy. The music from \"Daemon\" suggests that looking for new stylistics for the Norwegians (and the Hungarian and the Englishman) are not particularly in the minds anymore. Fortunately, such a comfortable approach did not come into somehow weaker level of music. Songs like \"Worthless Abomination Destroyed\", \"Falsified And Hated\" (the best here), \"Malum\", \"Invoke The Oath\" or \"Bad Blood\" can be played blind (i.e. fragmentarily) and they will be liked, what's more!, surprisingly a lot is going on in them for the allegedly conservative material. \n\nThe conclusions from this are trivial. \"Daemon\" is simply a piece of very good black metal in the spirit of \"De Mysteriis...\", quite modernly produced (without as much dirt as before) and quite cleverly composed at the same time (because without auto-copies, which is not difficult in the absence of experiments and major news). Obviously, in its entire accident rate, \"Daemon\" may not be overwhelming or may be even boring at times, although the sixth Mayhem longplay is good, despite the fact that this release does not show the full potential of this band.\n\nOriginally on: https://subiektywnymetal.blogspot.com/2020/05/mayhem-daemon-2019.html\n",
        "\nIn my \"Ordo Ad Chao\" review it was said that the fourth Mayhem lp is the last such innovative and phenomenal material from this band. True, however, this does not mean that these gentlemen gave up their desire to publish good music. Well, on \"Esoteric Warfare\" they stopped experimenting radically. Personally, I don't really like this type of (too) conservative approach to composing new music, but I must admit that - ironically - it does not bother me with what is on \"Esoteric...\". It's because Hellhammer and the - again changed - line-up managed to create music without any sudden changes, which is not a stupid copy from previous releases and which still sounds strongly in its own way. \n\nWell, in the seven years between \"Ordo...\" and \"Esoteric...\" the band parted ways with one of the best composers who have passed through Mayhem - Blasphemer. Two guitarists, Teloch and Ghul, appeared in his place; and surprisingly, they filled the gap left by that musician quite sensibly, without trying to finesse their predecessor and any fervor (especially the second of them was in Cradle Of Filth). However, the most important thing is that after listening to \"Esoteric...\" you can clearly feel that a lot of time and effort has been put into it, so that it does not resemble older recordings - despite the \"familiar\" style. It's worth listening to the climates of \"Aion Suntelia\", \"Watcher\", \"Throne Of Time\" and \"Pandaemon\" or those songs where the band decided to use less obvious solutions, such as hammonds (!) in \"MILAB\" or bizarre effects guitar audible at the end of \"Corpse Of Care\" - very interestingly developing the earlier formula from \"Ordo...\". True, in the context of the previous album, it's not much, but in the case of the sound itself, which was on \"Esoteric...\" (i.e. very coherent!), such a modest amount of surprises seems to be fit perfectly and it maintains the overall atmosphere well. \n\nSo despite departing from radical experimentation, \"Esoteric Warfare\" is an album worth listening to. After Blasphemer's departure, the band maintained a very high level and managed to continue the well-known style in a meaningful way. And the fact that this album does not contain as much genius as on the previous ones, is a secondary matter. As you can see from my rating, you can easily find out about this \"problem\".\n\nOriginally on: https://subiektywnymetal.blogspot.com/2020/05/mayhem-esoteric-warfare-2014.html\n",
        "\nThe culmination of the best period of Mayhem - \"Ordo Ad Chao\". For many, such a theory is probably heresy and dilemmas, but not for me and the idea of my reviews. I will say even more, the Norwegian materials from the 00-07 years are better for me than the famous \"De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\". There is nothing to beat around the bush: after a fairly regular reactivation of the releasing new music, Hellhammer and the mixed-up line-up (most often before \"De Mysteriis...\") coped with the burden of their debut, and at the same time, they were able to achieve an equally phenomenal level, an example of which was the excellent and different \"Grand Declaration Of War\", \"Chimera\" and also...the discussed album! \n\nIn the first moment of having contact with \"Ordo...\", the fourth album from Mayhem causes a huge shock. Norwegians with the renewed presence of the Hungarian vocalist Attila Csihar have totally abandoned precision and sterile sounds in favor of...the most primal, even demo-like ones! Fortunately, the more \"buzzing\" sound did not come into simplifying the music or moving away to the regions before \"De Mysteriis...\". On the contrary!, the music on \"Ordo Ad Chao\" turned into a very dissonant-drone and broken atmosphere that can be associated with such acts as Portal, Deathspell Omega or even SunnO))). Besides, no wonder, with this type of avant-garde, a \"prettier\" sound could not really reflect the atmosphere of the entire album. \n\nWell, the atmosphere is what determines the genius of \"Ordo...\". The band has achieved such a stuffy, nervous and suspenseful atmosphere that this work can be considered one of the most intense and sick albums in the black metal trend. The words of praise are due to everyone in turn (well, maybe except for the barely contributing Necrobutcher - I recommend you to look at the booklet, which is what I'm talking about), starting from Hellhammer's talent, creativity and killer technique of Blasphemer, and ending, of course, of Attila's skills, who showed his all possibilities (especially from the shrill \"squeals\"). As for the tracks themselves, it would not be an exaggeration to mention the entire tracklist at this point, although...I would be lying if I had not singled out \"Deconsecrate\", \"Key To The Storms\", \"Illuminate, Eliminate\" or \"Psychic Horns\" (the end of this is incredible!) as those where the vocabulary to describe the genius of this music is simply running out. \n\nAs I mentioned at the beginning of the review, \"Ordo Ad Chao\" is the last such great and innovative cd by Hellhammer and the rest of the company. It's all the more impressive as it was already the fourth album that brought this group another series of changes, and at the same time one that was able to maintain a very high level of its predecessors. It's therefore hard to find a better end to your best publishing period.\n\nOriginally on: https://subiektywnymetal.blogspot.com/2020/04/mayhem-ordo-ad-chao-2007.html\n",
        "\nThose who absurdly accused \"Grand Declaration Of War\" of too much experimentation or some other kind of drifting beyond black metal standards, could easily check the \"Chimera\". Compared to the \"Grand...\", the discussed material is much more normal and extreme-oriented in its \"pure\" form, without avant-garde additions. Knowing me, it would be a great excuse to criticize and acknowledge it as a cheap copy of the style of \"De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\"... but not in this case! Well, the Norwegians, rejecting the experiments from \"Grand...\" once again managed to create a piece of brilliant and - paradoxically - clearly different from their previous cds of black metal music. \n\nThe novelties on \"Chimera\" are therefore dosed with much less momentum than on \"Grand...\", except that the music boasts much more extreme paces (one of the fastest in Mayhem's discography) and generally greater massacration (again, a matter of paces), on the other side, it surprises with clarity of sound, skillful matching of slower tempos, incredible ingenuity of Blasphemer and Hellhammer and disturbing, dehumanized atmosphere. The \"technicality\" and attention to details can also be pleasing as never before; in the case of \"Chimera\" all this fits together very naturally and without displacing the extreme side of this music. Best of all, the third Mayhem album is in no way inferior to the previous two - it's inventive and brilliantly composed enough. \n\nI have already mentioned the fact that they gave up the avant-garde and showed their class once again, but there was no mention of the \"hitness\" and extremely easy assimilation of this material (probably most of all). In this respect, every track on \"Chimera\" deserves a mention, both songs with blasts like \"You Must Fall\", \"Rape Humanity With Pride\" or \"Whore\", but also the slower ones like \"Impious Devious Leper Lord\", \"Slaughter Of Dreams\" or \"Dark Night Of The Soul\" (this one great speeds up). So there are absolutely no weaker songs on the \"Chimera\". All of them show perfectly that black metal can be technical, and at the same time, extreme and thrilling in all its glory. \n\nOriginally on: https://subiektywnymetal.blogspot.com/2020/04/mayhem-chimera-2004.html\n",
        "\nAfter the cult or - in general - the incidents related to the release of \"De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\", it's a wonder that Hellhammer gathered to join the pre-debut line-up (i.e. with Maniac and Necrobutcher) and a completely new one for Mayhem, guitarist Blasphemer to continue the band's activities. For many, the murder of Euronymous meant the end of the band's further activity and the necessity to stop releasing new music under this name; after all, most of songs from \"De Mysteriis...\" was composed by this Norwegian. It turns out...surprisingly in opposite way! First, it was shown by the very promising ep \"Wolf's Lair Abyss\", 3 years later, with much greater momentum, the \"Grand Declaration Of War\" which I am discussing. \n\nIt turns out that the renewed band of Norwegians has mastered the patents previously developed by Euronymous to perfection, and at the same time, paradoxically, they managed to depart into avant-garde and extremely dangerous regions for this genre - just like Satyricon and Ulver at that time. \"Grand Declaration Of War\" is a completely new quality for Mayhem, a manifesto album, and at the same time a shock against the background of the general, especially the most orthodox scene. The Norwegians decided to venture into black metal, totally dehumanized, crazy twisted, and sometimes even progressive - distant from the classic Satan worship, burning churches and running with axes in the woods. \n\nThe best thing is that the band lost little of its extremity during these drastic changes, and it brilliantly managed to get out of the situation with other, very unusual ideas for the genre. A lower extremity compared to \"De Mysteriis...\" (because this one roughly was only in \"A Time To Die\", \"In The Lies Where Upon You Lay\" and partially in \"Crystalized Pain In Deconstruction\") resulted in a much more solemn, war atmosphere, very brave experiments with instruments (in particular, the \"technicalization\" of riffs) or vocals in general (from black harshs, to those \"clean\", sometimes rebellious, and...vocoders) and solutions completely beyond black metal (as in brilliantly extended \"Completion In Science Of Agony (Part I)\" with noise-industrial insert or trance, trip-hopish \"A Bloodsword And A Colder Sun (Part II)\") or even ridiculing the listener (especially in the fragments with \"calm before the storm\"). Best of all, all this came into an exceptionally coherent and extremely original lp which from the beginning to the end, despite its eclecticism, is equally captivating. \n\nI consider the middle period of Mayhem, led by \"Grand Declaration Of War\", to be one of their best and definitely the most interesting albums in their discography. The Norwegians entered the year 2000 with a huge bang, at the same time successfully redefining their style and meeting the prevailing trends. It's a pity that it's not talked about much more often.\n\nOriginally on: https://subiektywnymetal.blogspot.com/2020/04/mayhem-grand-declaration-of-war-2000.html\n",
        "\nWhere to even begin with Pure Fucking Armageddon? It's one of the earliest demonstrations of Norwegian black metal from one of the most important, influential, and long-running bands of the era. And it sucks! Oh man, is it bad. Both in sound quality and songwriting - Pure Fucking Armageddon is such a fascinating bit of history, but nobody but the most masochistic black metal fan could consider this quality in any way. The production isn't so much \"bare bones\" as it is \"someone left a towel on the recording device\". The vocals sound like someone is blowing into the microphone; even some of the lowest-fidelity demos are somewhat intelligible. Not so much in these 27 minutes.\n\nThen on the other hand, the rehearsal tracks have the complete opposite problem. In sharp contrast to the muddled \"official\" demo tracks, the \"Mayhem\" rehearsal is extremely sharp, worse than Ulver's Nattens Madrigal. It's pretty shocking to transition from one side of the tape to another (and even worse if streamed). These rehearsal bits are less songs and more the band screwing around on tape. Diehard fans of Mayhem will likely find it fascinating to hear bits of studio chatter between Euronymous, Necrobutcher, and Manheim when they were kids - others will ask what the point was. Later rehearsal tracks are so indistinguishable from earlier on the demo due to the production fidelity that they approach Ildjarn-levels of incomprehensibility and sameness.\n\nPart of the \"point\" to this release is that it is rough. Mayhem (and early black metal) was about tearing down rules, destroying trends, and eschewing styles in the pursuit of transgressive intensity. In that sense, Pure Fucking Armageddon is an unqualified success. Whether or not you want to listen to that success is another story - yet we can certainly thank this demo for being such a watershed moment in the history of the black metal.\n\nIf you're interested in black metal's earliest days, then try out Hellhammer, Venom, Sodom, Bathory, Vulcano, Master's Hammer, Abhorer, early Burzum, and early Darkthrone. If you're interested in Mayhem's earliest days, then try out Deathcrush, Live in Leipzig, and De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas. Only check out Pure Fucking Armageddon if you want the very, very beginning - or if you just absolutely adore no-fi production.\n",
        "\nSo we all know Mayhem's story, right?\n\nFormed in 1984, played some Venom and Mercyful Fate covers in 1985, Released an EP in '87, got a mentally screwed up teenager to be their vocalist, played some shows, y'know all that.\n\nWell this is one of the shows they played with that \"mentally depressed\" teenager.\n\n\"Live In Zeitz\" was recorded at an unknown venue on November 24th, 1990, and was at first spread around by Pelle on tape, with self-created covers, before being widely spread as bootlegs on various tapes, CDs, and vinyl records. In 2016, Peaceville decided to finally officially release it after using a pretty shitty bootlegged recording of the show on the Live In Leipzig anniversary edition, and instead used a much higher quality master recording.\n\nNow, Leipzig is generally regarded as the definitive Mayhem experience, it's the album with the 2 most well-known members, it's the album with the most recognizable songs, and honestly, if you're reading this review, you've probably already listened to it.\n\nBut, I'd argue Live In Zeitz is BETTER, then Leipzig (ooh shocking), and I'll explain why, right now, in this review.\n\nFirst off let's get the elephant out of the room, this is a bootleg recording. It may be a higher quality bootleg recording than what was found on Live In Leipzig's 20th-anniversary release, but it's still a bootleg. As such the sound quality is not great and you aren't gonna get a super clean quality recording; but in all honesty, if you're listening to a black metal live recording from when the sub-genre was just starting out, you're not really expecting a high-quality recording, are you?\n\nStill, the production (and sloppy guitar playing) are the only things keeping this album from a 90% or above.\n\nBut hey, let's talk about some more positive aspects of this album. First off, they play the songs on this album MUCH faster then on Leipzig, which is one of my gripes of the leipzig album, and how they play the songs so slow. This album has probably my favorite version of \"Deathcrush\" ever. This is accompanied by Euronymous's guitar playing, which while sloppy, showcases that he has (well, HAD) ability, and was competent as a guitar player.\n\nBut we'll get back to that later, what I REALLY wanna talk about is Hellhammer's drums. Hellhammer is a fairly good drummer in my opinion, and I love his sound here. They sound much better then any other \"Live In\" release, and especially better than Leipzig's. It's pounding and powerful, the intro to Funeral Fog alone is a great example of how amazing his drum sound is here, nothing else really compares.\n\n\"Freezing Moon\" is performed fairly well here though I can't comment on it too much, as I've heard this song a billion times and I do prefer the Leipzig version of Freezing a little more. I do enjoy Euronymous's solo on it, however, along with Dead, who sings the song really great as usual for him.\n\nOh, right, Dead.\n\nSome have criticized Dead's performance on this record, mainly due to him being a bit inaudible at points, but that's not *too* important to me. Personally, I believe he does just fine here, I'm more focused on the instruments anyway (as I am with every metal record I listen to ), but I suppose I'll review his performance.\n\nDead does quite a good job on here, his vocals aren't the clearest they could be but I don't mind. Out of all of Mayhem's early vocalists, Dead was the \"best\" (AKA, he wasn't as terrible as Maniac, wasn't as weird as Atilla). As on every Dead release, he sounds possessed and evil, like a zombie screeching and growling its way through a graveyard. I commend him on this release, and as always it's a shame he could not live to make more music.\n\nNecrobutcher's bass here is rather drowned out by all the other instruments which is truly a shame. Usually, on black metal records the bass is a little inaudible, but you can make it out. Not here. Necro's instrument barely makes any sound when Euro's guitar, Dead's vocals, and Hellhammer's drums are playing along with him. This is a shame because I believe Necro is a competent bassist who does great on other albums like De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas Alive, and Esoteric Warfare.\n\nAll in all, this album is great, in my opinion. Despite some small flaws and the not-great quality, it's a damn quality listen and I recommend it to any Mayhem or black metal fan in general.\n",
        "\nPandemic times in extreme music are mostly a period of releasing eps, canceling tours and - as a result - all promises \"for a better tomorrow\". Due to the situation, Mayhem also reminded of themselves with the ep \"Atavistic Black Disorder/Kommando\" and...they might as well not do it! They created a surprisingly forced, clunky and cheap-profit-oriented publishing cd with an approach almost unlike them. What is worse, this ep, even as a minor curiosity, does not look more impressive - and I am writing it from the perspective of fan. \n\nIt feels like \"Atavistic...\" is just something like a collection of everything the band currently had - in the worst sense. Confirmation can be found in the first three songs. First in \"Black Glass Communion\" and \"Everlasting Dying Flame\" previously known from \"Daemon\" in the form of bonuses, then in the allegedly greatest attraction of this ep, \"Voces Ab Alta\" - originally unreleased. Unfortunately, all of the three share the same thoughtless focus on \"De Mysteriis...\", a moderately thrilling atmosphere and considerable conservatism. Admittedly, similar accusations were already made in my \"Daemon\" review, although there was no talk of something as inept and monstrously recreational as here, and the group still knew how to put older patents in a newer ideas - 7/10 did not come out of nowhere. \n\nIronically, this is not the main problem with \"Atavistic...\"! The biggest disadvantage is the second side of this ep, i.e. covers of punk classics (incl. Dead Kennedys, Discharge). The performance itself, of course, keeps the level (and is quite close to the originals), but well, it has nothing to do with the b-sides of \"Daemon\" or the band's style in general (even the more experimental one). The reception is spoiled primarily by two elements: melodiousness and/or \"political\" climate, which in my opinion do not suit to Mayhem very much (which was also not helped by the guest invitation of Messiah and Maniac - ex-vocalists of the group). One has the impression that the group recorded these songs completely just for a mockery or just anyway (i.e. without an idea) to make this material more attractive. The only question is whether it's worth disturbing the generally high level of discography in this way.\n\nOriginally on: https://subiektywnymetal.blogspot.com/2021/09/mayhem-atavistic-black-disorderkommando.html\n",
        "\nThis review is going to be a special one, since this is the 100th review I've written on this site, and I've came a long way in my music tastes since I joined here just a year ago. So for this 100th review special, why not talk about a band that was also the first band I reviewed? So much has been said about Mayhem at this point, I don't think I can add anything new into the Mayhem conversation. So instead, this review on their magnum opus \"De Mysteriis Dom. Sathanas\" is gonna be more of a retrospective look on the album, as well as a bit of its influence on the controversy black metal was going through in the early 90s.\n\nFirst off, the instruments. Mayhem's previous releases have varied in quality, from the rawness of their early demos to the death metal-influenced \"Deathcrush\" EP, and the aggression and darkness of \"Live in Leipzig\". With DMDS, however, the band had decided to take on a different sound for their debut studio album. The guitars are more clearer than in previous releases, and the riffs have less aggression and more coldness in them. The drums also beat in fast patterns, but they feel more controlled and have a more consistent sound than in previous releases. The bass is present, but it's mainly muffled, so it doesn't exactly do a lot in the mix. These instruments are combined to give the tracks a more cold and mysterious atmosphere, and it works well. One of the best examples of this would be with the \"Enter Sandman\" of black metal \"Freezing Moon\". While I personally prefer previous variants of this song, especially the ones in the \"Studio Tracks\" demo and \"Live in Leipzig\" album, the DMDS version is still amazing. The track goes for a more epic style, and it works well with the sincere riffs and the technical drum beats. Other great tracks on this album include \"Funeral Fog\", \"Life Eternal\", and the criminally underrated \"From the Dark Past\". DMDS goes for a more cleaner and ghastly tone than in the previous releases, and while some prefer the more raw production of their earlier works, I personally think the instruments sound great.\n\nBut one of the more controversial aspects of this album would be the vocals. Dead was originally going to do the vocals for DMDS, but after his unexpected (or expected) suicide, Euronymous recruited Attila Csihar for the main vocals. While Dead's vocals sounded angry and corpse-like, Attila's vocals sound slower and more haunting. A great example of this would be in \"Cursed in Eternity\". Here, Attila's vocals croaks his voice, and he mixes them with some agonizing screams and chants. This may sound bad on paper, but he gives his voice a grand personality on the track, and his usage of dragging out the syllables makes the vocals feel more powerful. Not only that, but Attila's vocals also flow very well on the instruments. The track goes for a more faster and chaotic sound, and Attila's terrifying vocals gives the instruments a more scary tone. For many people, Attila's vocals either sound good or sound terrible, and I'd say that they sound very good.\n\nSo far, I've covered the best aspects of this project, but as you'll see in a bit, it isn't perfect. Coming back to the vocals, there are a couple of times where Attila's croaking vocals can be a bit much, especially in \"Pagan Fears\". The track itself is fine, but Attila sounds more quiet, and his overuse of the croaks and grunts make him sound like he's mumbling. Another thing about the album is that \"De Mysteriis Dom. Sathanas\" is the weakest song off the album. It's not terrible or anything, but the guitar riffs feel a bit too similar to the other tracks on this album, and the drumming can be tedious at times. It feels more like a different band is playing DMDS instead of Mayhem. And lastly, I wished they put some of the songs off of the \"Deathcrush\" EP on here, like \"Deathcrush\" or \"Chainsaw Gutsfuck\". While it may feel out of place in the overall sound of the album, it would be interesting to see a more slower and atmospheric version of those songs.\n\nNow I'm not going to pretend that this record is flawless by any means, as it does have a couple of issues. However, it is still great most of the time. The unique take on the instrumentals works well, Attila has an amazing vocal performance overall (even if they sound poor a couple of times), and the lyrics are just as dark and mysterious as ever. DMDS would be the last hoorah for the classic-era of Mayhem, as Euronymous was murdered a year earlier and the controversies of black metal peaking during this time. While new Mayhem is still great, it still cannot compete to the greatness that is \"De Mysteriis Dom. Sathanas\".\n",
        "\nMy best friend and I just sat through this and almost died of laughter. How the hell was even authorized to be released?! Eisenhower's first appearance on color TV has better quality than this crap. If you buy this you should be killed. The band deserves no money for the sack of shit. The only thing it accomplished was making my friend and I compare it to terrorist videos from the early 2000's and saying how you can get better production on an audio recording on a Toshiba laptop from 2008. My dishwasher produces better drumming than the idiot who did the mixing for this. Honestly, it's a blessing that the video says what songs are being played, because songs like Funeral Fog and Deathcrush don't even sound like what they did when they were recorded. This is due to the guitars just being white noise, no riff is recognizable unless you're listening very keenly, and it shouldn't be that way. It gets so bad sometimes you can't even tell if Blasphemer is playing a solo or not. The bass is nowhere to be found until they start playing songs from the Deathcrush EP, and sometimes the bass meshes with the already horrible drum sound to make the same noise from the synths in a Miley Cyrus/Lady Gaga late 2000's pop song\n\nAs for the bands energy on stage? Maniac is a horrific vocalist, who is boring to watch, and even when he starts slicing himself, it just makes the video more unbearable. The other performances are what they should be, but there's still an absence of good energy on stage. Blasphemer and Necrobutcher are just phoning it in and playing normally. The worst part overall? The crowd cheers at the end of every song, which implies that this was a good concert. Honestly, if I want to hear popcorn popping at high speeds like this, I go to the Dollar General and buy some popcorn and put in the microwave, record it, and still get a better drumsound than this absolute pile of crap. Drums have never sounded this bad.\n\nSo all in all, this release gets a 0, as I can't see it being for anything but a one off thing to watch with a fellow metalhead or by yourself, it gets no worse than this bullcrap. I've never seen a live performance video this bad. You can find it on youtube, it's fun for a little while. You can even play a drinking game to take a sip every time Maniac does something horrific. Have fun with that.\n\n-Nolan\n",
        "\n\"De Mysteriis Dom. Sathanas\" inarguably is an opus magnum of Mayhem. It was released in 1994, after black metal had conquered the Norwegian media for well-known reasons, but the vast part of the \"De Mysteriis Dom. Sathanas\" material had been circling in the black metal underground since the late 80s in a form of demos, rehearsals, live recordings, so it's fair to call the album a one of the most important in the fundament of black metal.\n\nThe band started to work on the material of \"De Mysteriis Dom. Sathanas\" in the late 80s, after the vocalist and ideologist Per Yngve Ohlin, known as Dead, had joined in. The majority of the material was written by the guitarist and leader of the band, Euronymous. Some part was written by Snorre Ruch from Thorns (initially Stigma Diabolicum) or under his influence. For example, a one of the riffs of \"From the Dark Past\" was originally written for \"Into the Promised Land\" by Stigma Diabolicum, before it moved to Thorns and finally to Mayhem.\n\nThe material of the album is produced well, what is a bit out of the black metal definition, but luckily there're no signs of overproduction. In terms of songwriting \"De Mysteriis Dom. Sathanas\" is obviously a black metal blueprint. Compositions are majorly based on classic black metal tremolo riffing. The music is most often dynamic, but there's some diversity, changing of tempo and themes. The drums are technical and powerful. Well, Hellhammer is a respected drummer for the reason.\n\nAttila's vocals are very charismatic. They are specific and aren't similar either to Dead's roaring or to traditional black metal screaming, like in Darkthrone, for example, but Attila's style not only fit \"De Mysteriis Dom. Sathanas\", but make the music of it better. The vocal performance isn't even extreme, it's a sort of harsh throat singing, which sounds just enough sinister for such album.\n\nDead wrote the majority of the lyrics, after what he justified his stage name in 1991. The lyrics is dark, often quite abstract and philosophical. The straightly Satanic lyrics can be found only on the title composition. Dead was the main ideologist of black metal, he sent Mayhem to the darker side, after what the band evolved to its classic black metal sound. The solid part of the lyrics is Dead's thoughts about afterlife and it was a quite expected thing retrospectively from the person, who had been planning to commit a suicide.\n\nThe atmosphere of \"De Mysteriis Dom. Sathanas\" is dark, with a funeral touch. Actually, it's possible not to describe anything here. The lyrics tells enough. \"Everything here is so cold, everything here is so dark...\", \"Diabolic shapes float by...\", \"Darkness is growing, eternity opens, the cemetery lights up again as in ancient times...\" - the images of \"Freezing Moon\", the most cult composition of the work, will appear in front of listeners' eyes.\n\nThat's how \"De Mysteriis Dom. Sathanas\" sounds. It's pretty clear, why it was so influential even in the process of making. It's also clear, why it was being anticipated so much in the process of recording. It should be clear, why the album eventually became even more important, after it had been finally released.\n",
        "\nAh, Deathcrush. The album that every 16 year old metalhead girl, or every 35 year old overweight unshaven metalhead man, praises to the death. This record gets so much love from every black metal fan and their mother, just because it was the first Mayhem record, therefore the first trve epic kvlt Norwegian blvck mvtvl record, yeah whatever. That doesn't excuse half of the ep for being pretty much TV static. The first 3 tracks are great, I'll say that. I gave this one 4/10, 1 point for its historical importance, 1 point for the title track as a whole, and 2 points for that fucking riff in Chainsaw Gutsfuck, easily the best black metal riff of all time, except for Hades by Bathory. Seriously, Euronymous barely knew how to plug his guitar into an amp yet he managed to come up with that groovy 5/4 piece of musical genius. Anyway, I'm going to emphasise more generally on what I like about this EP, or at least side A. The intro is an electronic piece, and I actually like it quite a lot, it sounds medieval and unhinged, acting as a great opener for a wild and insane EP. Then the title track starts, the main riff is quite good, but what I really love about this song is the chorus section, where Manheim's double bass explodes into a maniacal pattern and there's a rapid riff buried under Maniac wailing \"DEATHCRUSHHHHHH\". It's creepy and deranged and I love it. Chainsaw Gutsfuck is even better, as that genius riff dominates most of the track, and it fits perfectly with Necrobutcher's chainsaw bass and Maniac's disgusting shrieks, he really earned the role of \"gutpuking\". Anyways, side A of Deathcrush is pure black metal heaven. Unfortunately, that's where the good shit ends, and even more unfortunately, there's still 10 minutes left to go.\n\nThe cover of Venom's \"Witching Hour\" is fucking dreadful. I wasn't exaggerating when I cried TV static in the beginning of this review. You can hear the main riff just barely under the thick layer of fuzz. The song is also less than half the length of the original. Why? Why is the song so short? Why does it sound nothing like the original? Why is it even on the EP? Why did Mayhem even record this, and how did they think it was a good idea to publish it? The whole idea of music is that you can hear the music. Necrolust actually starts off promisingly, but then it all goes to shit. Back to the TV static. The EP then takes a break and slows down with Weird Manheim. Again, why? Why does this exist? This dumb third rate piano piece shouldn't be on any record, let alone a fucking black metal record, Jesus Christ. I understand that Mayhem were probably fucking around and had to fill out space on the album, but what's the point in even pressing an EP when an entire side is just the band fucking around? Why not just release Deathcrush and Chainsaw Gutsfuck as a single? The record finally puts itself to sleep with Pure Fucking Armageddon, which sounds fun at first, but of course it is once again TV static.\n\nI'm sorry but I can't give this album a higher score when most of it is just terrible, as in literally musically incomprehensible, I cannot point out a single note on side B of this EP, except for the Weird Manheim song which sucks anyways. The production is completely awful, but at least the first 3 songs are actual songs, with actual riffs and actual structure. Although, I would like to hear side B of Deathcrush remixed so you can actually hear the notes, that would be quite cool. But for now, I'm staying far away from the majority of this album.\n",
        "\nNecrobutcher recently stated in an interview that Daemon is the first album that Mayhem has done in a long time with tracks geared towards the live performance. This is a refreshing truth. This record blows their previous release Esoteric Warfare out of the water and furthermore, it is quite possibly Mayhem\u2019s best release since their magnum opus Di Mysteriis Dom Sathanas. Until now, Mayhem felt like a nostalgia band. Apart from a few high quality tracks like To Daimonion, Whore and Illuminate Eliminate their post Euronymous work has felt underwhelming and weak. \n\nDaemon could not be a bigger step in the right direction. This record is full of tracks that are close enough to their classic work that they maintain that trademarked true Mayhem sound while touching on all of their work since, bringing the best elements of their evolution into the fold. This creates a refreshing and mature sounding record. The real stand out performance on this LP comes from vocalist Atilla Csihar. He has come a long way from his time in Tormentor and on Mysteriis. He shows vast range and provides the most unique and haunting vocal in all of black metal. Necrobutcher and Hellhammer also shine in many sections. \n\nThe album opens with a bang with The Dying False King. This track hits hard and sets the stage for what\u2019s to come. It is chaotic and feels like classic Mayhem without any bullshit, just big minor chords in fast succession with a blast beat. The album really picks up in the middle with Bad Blood, Malum and Falsified and Hated. These three tracks are all perfect cuts for the live show and I expect to see them in Mayhem sets for the remainder of their career. \n\nBad Blood begins with a promising riff that recurs after the verse in a very satisfying manner. The track has a jarring road map perhaps but it doesn't disappoint. Bad Blood's biggest boon is that it features an exceptional guitar solo that is both technical and emotional. While it relies perhaps a little too heavily on sweep picking, the moments where the shredding tapers back shows the guitarist\u2019s range. \n\nMalum, perhaps the finest cut of the record is both haunting and disorienting.The track begins with a haunting dirge with manic rambling from Attila behind. This lures you into a sense of dread before the track picks up. Its primary guitar lick harkens back to the band\u2019s early days with the deathcrush EP. It is a straightforward power chord riff but it doesn't feel derivative. The haunting operatic bridge shows immense range and reminds the listener of early Emperor. Here we return to a dirge style section that is larger than life and evokes the torture of hell. Perhaps the best moment here is the operatic, tortured, off key singing provided by Attila here. \n\nWorthless Abominations, the lead single of the record comes the closest to the rest of Mayhem\u2019s post Mysteriis era. It has the experimentalism of A Grand Declaration of War, without the glaring omissions of Black Metal tradition which lead to that album\u2019s downfall. The roadmap is bizarre but the blast beats and shrieking keep it grounded in black metal. It also has the Technical Black Metal elements that have spilled over from Esoteric Warfare with unique rhythms and crazy chromatic licks throughout. This track is an example of how the band took influence from their entire back catalogue to both showcase their evolution as a band but also to pull themselves out of the nostalgia band only category. \n\nOverall, this is by far Mayhem\u2019s strongest release in decades and we should definitely not overlook Mayhem as a band that has peaked and died. I expect that this record is a harbinger of great things to come for this band.\n",
        "\nThis album could be way better, it is historically important and it is a strong album but the main thing holding it back in my opinion is the vocals. They killed the album for me. I love the instrumentation of this album, especially on songs like \"Pagan Fears\" and \"Cursed in Eternity\" but the fucking vocals are horrible 99% of the time. Attila is the worst vocalist for the band in my opinion, for most people you love the vocals or you hate them and I most definitely hate them, there were so many options but this is probably the weakest link in the \"Classic\" Mayhem era, quite sad because it is the last album from this era. Now that I have explained what is wrong with the album let me get in the nitty gritty of each part and break this album down.\n\nThe instrumentation: By far the best part of the album, everything about this is near perfect. The album is well produced, everyone does well playing their instruments. I have pretty much no complaints in this regard. The riffs are cold as ever, the drums are on point and the bass on this album is audible. The bass did not sound too high in the mix but it was still there and had a presence unlike half of black metal music. I like the very raw stuff but it's refreshing to hear some bass every once and awhile. The tone on the guitar is just plain evil (Especially on parts like around 2:48 on Cursed in Eternity), there is a reason (mostly) everyone loves the albums Euronymous was a part of. Euronymous had some of the sickest tones and wrote some of the most memorable pieces of black metal, for example the famed \u201cFreezing Moon\u201d or \u201cBuried by Time and Dust\u201d. I would also like to say Hellhammer is a beast, he wrote memorable drums for this album and in my opinion they are just as great sometimes better than the guitars on this album. Normally I focus on the guitars but sometimes the drums just are some of the coolest shit I have ever heard. He does the classic blast beats but then he will do all these insane drum fills, then to top it off he is just a super technical drummer for black metal but not in a bad way. He is by far the best drummer as far as skill in black metal.\n\nThe vocals: What the fuck were they thinking, I mean that in the nicest way possible. The vocals are unique at least but they are not at all to my taste (with time they can grow on you but my problems still stand because they are just not right for the album). I can understand why some people like them. The best way to describe them is a growl, and they don't do the album justice, the only thing keeping the album from being in the 90's are his vocals, and I almost want to put the score lower but I wanted to be fair to the godlike instrumentation. They ruin the mood of the songs for me, they just sound ridiculous. The vocals make it sound like a joke, when you think of black metal you think of the shrills and possibly the occasional deep guttural .I think they should have had Varg do vocals. Hell if anyone else did vocals it would have been better but instead we have this, an album that could have been so much better if they had a different vocalist. Attila sounds like a frog getting boiled alive. That is the only way I can describe it, it is a low growl instead of a shriek like that of a Nazg\u00fbl. Really disappointing because it will be this grim onslaught of pure black metal and then he comes on croaking and moaning on the microphone, I know he can do better because I have heard him do better. It might just be because the vocals are kind of high in the mix for the style of vocals he was doing but I just don't see why he did not take the time and learn how to shriek, that might of been what Euronymous wanted though, to make a weird and out of the norm (even to this day) album and the vocals help make that come true. So in the end it's not all negative but I do think it could have been so much better if they used more conventional vocals or even just changed the mix of the vocals so they are lower and let the instruments do the talking instead of the vocals.\n\nI don't normally do reviews like this but I felt in this case I needed to. In the end it's not horrible, just disappointing, I can listen to it but Life Eternal and all the bootleg albums with instrumentals are much more enjoyable for me (I do wish the band would just put them out officially but I doubt they will). It's an important album for black metal, but it is far from the best and it is very over hyped. \u201cDe Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\u201d is just an album that is falling short of what it could and should be.\n\nConclusion: This is by no means a bad album, it's actually a great album. It has its flaws like any other piece of music or any piece of art. That does not ruin it at all and my main problem with it is the vocals like i stated, but at times they do work. I just feel it would have worked more often if it was delivered differently. The album is still a highlight of the Norwegian and early black metal scene, but it's not all it could be I guess you could say. No matter what my opinions are though there is no disputing that this is a stone cold black metal classic and will stay as such for as long as time remembers black metal. Thank you for reading my little review of this classic.\n",
        "\n\"Deathcrush\" became the first important release for Mayhem and also a one of the most important records for black metal, which had been in the process of formation by the moment of the appearance of this EP. Thus, \"Deathcrush\" became a one of the biggest bricks in the fundament of the genre and a one of the main triggering forces for the Norwegian scene, which would ultimately forge black metal. \"Deathcrush\" wasn't quite there by the today's standards of the genre, but it was moving in the right direction for sure.\n\nOn \"Deathcrush\" there are a lot of influences of such legendary bands like Venom, Hellhammer, Celtic Frost, Bathory. All of the mentioned artists were boosting up the level of extremity in metal music. The last thing was exactly what Euronymous had been targeting. Mayhem wanted to be as extreme, harsh and fast as it was possible. The band members were young, fervent and eager to protest against every living thing in the most extreme way. And they had done that. \"Deathcrush\" became a breakthrough in terms of aggression by the moment it was released and its aggression is very convincing even today, after extreme metal produced a lot of other masterpieces.\n\nStylistically the music of \"Deathcrush\" is raw and evil piece of thrash metal. Actually, there are slow parts on almost every composition, but all tracks have fast culminations, with rapid thrashy picking, which sounds just ferocious. The title track starts with the classic mid-paced riff, but then there are pounding speed-ups. \"Chainsaw Gutsfuck\" is majorly low-paced, but still its riffing is highly memorable and no less sinister than on the title track. Anyway, the culmination is absolutely wicked there, with wild guitars and blast beats. The bass lines sound no less catchy, than the riffing, especially on this composition. \"Necrolust\" also has a spectacular low-paced start, but this track goes wild pretty quick. It's the most crushing and insane composition of the mini-album.\n\nThere's a lot to say about the vocals. There are two vocalists here, Maniac and Messiah. Obviously, Maniac is the main one, he performs on \"Deathcrush\", \"Chainsaw Gutsfuck\" and \"Necrolust\". His style of performing brings the extremity of the work to another level. He provided piercing high-pitched shrieks, as if he is being burned alive or as if he is an insane murderer, who is chopping his victim in a state of maniacal delirium. The lyrics is a masterpiece of straightforward brutality and ugliness, that's why it fits the music for 100%. It's filled with violence, gore, necrophilia and stuff like that. And about what else is it possible to shriek in a such intense manner?\n\nThat's how legendary \"Deathcrush\" sounds. That's why it's legendary. It's filthy, ugly and crude. It expresses an uncontrollable wrath. It was aimed to be extreme and Mayhem succeeded with making it extreme.\n",
        "\nThis album is plain weird. It's so eerie and evil sounding. The aura of this album is so grim. The music is dark and depressing. I don't know how else to put this, but their concept on here was to put out something totally dreary. It's not like 'De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas' where it was fast and furious yet dark as well. They seem to have taken a new direction back to their old roots on the new one 'Daemon' just not on this album. It's got a strange production sound to it. I first heard it a while ago then it was left in my CD archives until recently. I wanted a better opinion of it since tastes change over time and I liked it.\n\nAttila is strange as usual in the vocal department and Necrobutcher/Blasphemer do a good job of riff writing. I think that they wanted it this way on here. I'm not sure, but it's not something to listen to on a depressing day. Hellhammer kicks ass as usual behind the set. He always kills it. Ever since their second album that's when I first took notice of him as a drummer. But the guitars are what I pay more attention to. On here, it's hard to find the concept with the riff writing. It seems as though they were looking for a different sound on here. Not the typical blood and guts Mayhem but weird Mayhem.\n\nThe production did do it justice and I'm glad that I gave this LP a fair shake. The music is just so darn desolate and dark. It seems as if the band wanted this as a mere concept album. And they did well in establishing a grim record. The intro is so eerie and evil it's enough to make the happiest person miserable. The album doesn't really officially start after the intro is done. The guitar riffs that Blasphemer dishes out are such that are dreary and disheartening. Attila slays on vocals, his strange voice make the album even darker. A lot of screaming and weirdness. The songs are not too long but they're good.\n\nSo if I were to pick an album from Mayhem that's one of the darkest, I'd say this one is close to it. They do a good job of keeping their music underground. I just went ahead and bought this years ago (2007) or thereabout. It has taken me several spins to get used to this concept album sound and think it worth a \"B' rating. I think you may be able to find this on YouTube, then you can check it out see if it's to your liking. Like I said over and over that this album is plain \"weird.\" It's cool though, the experimental process. And the guitar riffs are sweet as well. Really unique. Check this one out! Support the band, buy the CD!\n",
        "\nIf you know Mayhem, you would know that they have released a ton of live albums, each with their own varieties. I've already covered the infamous Dawn of the Black Hearts bootleg, so it's only fair that I cover this one as well (I might review the other live albums in the future though). Of all the live albums I've listened to in Mayhem's discography, I'd say that \"Live in Leipzig\" is their best one. I know I'm not the only person to say that, but to understand why people love this album so much, we need to focus on the music.\n\nOne of the first you'll notice is the quality of the music. Most of the live albums from Mayhem I've listened to sound like they were recorded on a Fisher Price cassette recorder, so the quality is usually terrible. Here, however, the sound quality is much better. The guitars and drums are more distinguishable, and the bass has more volume. The vocals are also much more understandable, as they aren't drowned out from the noisy instruments. However, there are still some occasional distorted moments, and there are a few times where you can't understand what Dead is saying. Then again, these moments are rare, and don't affect the overall quality too much.\n\nNow lets talk about the main elephant in the room: Dead. Pelle is considered one of the best members in the band not because of his musical talents, but also because he believed he was an actual corpse and did all kinds of crazy things. This does show in his vocal performance here. His voice contains groans and screams, making Dead sound like he's possessed. His voice fits well to the chaotic atmosphere. One of his strongest moments is in \"Freezing Moon\". His introduction, \"The freezing moon can obsess you\", sets the stage for the mysterious, aggressive atmosphere. His singing lines up perfectly from the fast bangs of the drums and the distorted guitars. Looking back at this song, I would've loved to see Dead's take on \"De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\".\n\nThe rest of the band's performance was also excellent. Love him or hate him, you have to admit that Euronymous was a skilled guitarist. The guitar riffs vary from fast and violent in \"Necrolust\", to slow and suspenseful in some of \"Freezing Moon\". They are also executed perfect with the extreme distortion. Hellhammer also had some of his best moments on this album also. The drums flow well with the themes, and have a strong beating sound that emphasize the atmosphere. Necrobutcher's bass play is pretty good, though there are a few moments where he has a hard time following the more faster moments of the album.\n\nLastly, in between the songs, we hear the crowd talking as the band test their tones and notes, as well as talk to the audience. It might not sound like a big deal, but they made it so you feel like you are in the concert. You would need to listen through the entire album with no breaks or interruptions in order to get the full experience. Some other live albums do this, but don't work as well as here.\n\nOverall, this live album delivers quite an amazing experience. Not only do you get to hear Dead sing most of Mayhem's songs at the time, but it also offers better sound quality, and gives these songs a new look and feel. While most other live albums of Mayhem fall flat, this one shines as the superior listening experience to Mayhem.\n",
        "\nIf you know anything about Mayhem, you'd know how this bootleg album came to exist. But for those who don't know, here's a summary: The band's vocalist Pelle \"Dead\" Ohlin decided to live up to his name by killing himself with a knife and a shotgun. Euronymous came across his body and then proceeds to buy a disposable camera from a convenient store, returns to the house, and then takes pictures of his body. He later got the photos processed and sent them out to his friends to show off how dark and edgy they were. While most of the photos were destroyed, one somehow managed to survive and eventually became the cover for this album.\n\nWhenever I discuss the album to my friends, they'd all say that it was awesome simply for the album cover. However, when I ask them if they even listened to the album, they admit they haven't. I decided to go out my way to buy the CD and listen to it myself to see if there's any musical value in it. While it's definitely not the worst live album Mayhem released (I'm looking at you, \"Live in Zeitz\"), at the same time, it's nothing I would want to get excited about.\n\nOne of the major drawbacks of this LP is the production. I've listened to plenty of black metal demos and bootlegs to know that the quality isn't gonna be the best. Even then, this bootleg is extremely distorted. Dead's vocals are barely audible, and are sometimes drowned out from the loud guitar. The drums just barely keep up with the more fast-paced songs like \"Necrolust\", and the bass is virtually non-existent. If the bootleggers had taken the time to at least remix the audio to make it more clearer, then it would probably be a lot better.\n\nThe songs themselves also sound a bit bland. Yes, it's cool to hear Dead sing the ghostly, epic song of \"Freezing Moon\" and the lyrically gruesome song \"Chainsaw Gutsfuck\". But as I've stated before, the quality of this bootleg is garbage, so the songs are all a distorted mess. Not to mention that they sound similar to their other projects like the \"Deathcrush\" EP. I would've loved to see the band go for a slightly different sound like in other live albums, but they took a lazy approach and didn't offer anything new in this album. Not that the songs are terrible, but if I was gonna hear Dead sing, I'd probably go for the more clearer \"Studio Tracks\" demo or the superior \"Live in Leipzig\" album.\n\nMy CD also comes with bonus tracks, which are Celtic Frost and Venom covers. However, these covers are completely forgettable. They are nearly similar to the original songs, and Messiah's vocals are a bit drowsy and bring down these already mediocre covers. Also, for some reason, the quality in these tracks are even worse. I assume that this was recorded earlier in their career since Dead isn't present in these songs.\n\nOverall, this bootleg album isn't as amazing as a lot of people make it out. Sure, the album cover is something to talk about, but these songs are like the others we've listened to in better releases, and they don't bring anything new to the table. And that's not including the fact that when Mayhem finally gave the LP an official release in 2017 titled \"Live in Sarpsborg\", they pretty much took this album and gave it a different name and cover. I love Mayhem, but I'd rather use this CD as a display item.\n",
        "\nMayhem is one of the most interesting black metal bands out there, and their EP \"Deathcrush\" does show. For those who want to get into the genre, this would be an excellent start.\n\nOne of the first things you'll notice when you listen to the EP is it's tone. It shows off in the self-titled song \"Deathcrush\", where the guitars have a distorted sound, and the drum vibrate with it's hard hits and kicks. The songs also have a semi-distorted aesthetic overall, which gives the album a slightly off feeling, like it's one of those tapes that you're not suppose to listen to.\n\nAnother noteworthy point of the EP is the vocals. Maniac is an amazing vocalist in this album. His voice gives off a loud, sharp tone with a brash, violent execution. It makes me think that he truly went insane while recording the songs, especially in the song \"Necrolust\", where his words are barely understandable (which is saying a lot) and practically shouts out the line, \"Come posercorpse and die again!\" like a literal madman. If Dead is considered the best vocalist in the band, then Maniac comes in at a close second.\n\nAnd the lyrics do fit the EP's aggressive tone, with topic of necrophilia, death, brutal murder, and Satanism to name a few. These lines may seem a bit bland on paper, but the way they are executed on the songs make them feel strong. \"Chainsaw Gutsfuck\" is an excellent example of this, as the distorted, harsh-sounding guitar riff and Maniac's lunatic voice empowers these lyrics.\n\nOf course, this EP is not flawless. I found the cover of \"Witching Hour\" a bit underwhelming when compared to Venom's. Venom's version had more of the power that Mayhem couldn't have accomplished. Plus, the graphic lyrics and brutal aesthetic isn't for everyone, but maybe that's what they intended. Wanting to be seen as outcasts from the heavy metal genre, the band chose to be different and did things to this EP that no one else was doing at the time.\n\nOverall, this is an excellent EP. Despite it's flaws, it still hold up as an extreme heavy metal album, and would be an excellent listen to those who want a more aggressive listen.\n",
        "\nWell, what can you really say about this album, when all is said by now? What makes the album so great is because a range of different people were involved in its creation. Anyone who thinks that Euronymous wrote all the guitar riffs and that Dead wrote all the lyrics has to reconsider. Although Euronymous is mostly responsible for the guitars, even Varg Vikernes, Snorre Ruch, and Necrobutcher contributed with guitar riffs. \n\nThe production is absolutely perfect, the guitars sound both crispy and juicy at the same time. Hellhammer said in an interview that they \"dubbed\" the guitars over and over with different effects to create that sound. I've always thought it sounds like the guitars are dueling with each other, and this could probably be an explanation for that. I would like to say some more about Euronymous performance here, because if you listen to every recording before this was made, he had a habit of being a bit sloppy while performing, even though giving 100%. But this one is truly a top-notch performance, sadly his last. \n\nHalf of the songs were written when the band had its classic, short-lived line-up between 1987-1991. These songs have a more death metal and thrash metal oriented structure, and with that foundation together with Snorre Ruch's more progressive playing style became a winning concept. Also Varg Vikernes contributes with some groovy bass lines that we probably would not have heard from Necrobutcher if he was in the band at the time. Attila's opera-like voice and unconventional vocals are so liberating from all the typical black metal screams out there. But I must admit that I had trouble digesting the vocals when I first heard them. It sounded like they replaced Dead with someone unable to scream / growl. But I was wrong. \n\nHellhammer's drums are absolutely phenomenal and superhuman, they sound so huge and that fat bass drum is just awesome. Note that this album was recorded in 1992, so there was no chance of him sitting behind Cubase using \"Drumkit from Hell\" program. It is human muscles that pump out blast beats sometimes closer to 2 minutes in a row. Also note that they manage to create an atmosphere without a single keyboard, as so many other bands in the 90's would do. When you think of all the tragedy that hit the band, you can't help but get goosebumps when you hear songs like \"Cursed in Eternity\", \"Life Eternal\" and \"From the Dark Past\". For a dark past it really is...\n\nAbsolute masterpiece 10/10\n",
        "\nIt\u2019s almost unfathomable that \u2018Grand Declaration of War\u2019 was only the second full-length studio album released by Mayhem. Despite \u2018Deathcrush\u2019 and \u2018Wolf\u2019s Lair Abyss\u2019 exuding the atmosphere and weightiness of full albums, they are alas considered mere EPs; and while \u2018Live in Leipzig\u2019 and \u2018Mediolanum Capta Est\u2019 are two of the greatest live albums ever released, they alas, are live albums. Such is the rich variety of Mayhem\u2019s discography. \n\nThere is no question that, even from the most cursory of listens, \u2018Grand Declaration of War\u2019 from the year 2000 is a revolutionary album. With Blasphemer and Maniac now well entrenched in the Mayhemic culture, with the successful \u2018Wolf\u2019s Lair Abyss\u2019 onslaught under their bullet belts (not to mention \u2018Deathcrush\u2019 for Maniac), they embarked on a courageous and imaginative songwriting process that would yield exquisite fruit that would challenge, confound, and reward in equal measure. \n\nThe most immediately evident aspect of the music is that it eschews entirely any traditional rock structures. The first track \u2018A Grand Declaration of War\u2019 begins with a martial guitar riff that grows in volume like an approaching futuristic army before Hellhammer\u2019s drum-rolls and militaristic percussion join to create a hyper-modern war-march. Where 'De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas' sat shrouded in the dark past and under the freezing moon, 'Grand Declaration of War' is a sharp and modern entity; a more contemporary type of evil for a new millenium. \n\nThe flow of the first track is cut short - Blasphemer\u2019s songwriting turning on a tack - to launch into the blast beats of \u2018In the Lies Where Upon You Lay\u2019, a stunning powerhouse of razor-wire shredding and counter-intuitive time signatures. And the album proceeds in this fashion, oscillating between intense speed, sultry slower passages and full electronic sequences such as in \u2018A Bloodsword and a Colder Sun\u2019 that is purely electronic, and \u2018To Daimonion Part 2\u2019 which contains several minutes of actual silence. \n\n(A note on track listing: This album is notorious for being almost impossible to follow in regards to track titles, especially in its second half, with some tracks seemingly broken up into different parts. While I am reviewing the original Season of Mist CD from 2000, I am also relying on the digital version tracklisting which is very helpful. I also own an original digipak version which I purchased second-hand and discovered that the evil Samaritan who previously owned it had done the hard yards and written the tracks out on a piece of paper). \n\nManiac\u2019s vocals are as varied as they would ever be, with spine-chilling rasps and screams juxtaposed with spoken word oratory, like some deranged demagogue making cryptic pronouncements of doom to a listening public. His voice and creativity here are profoundly effective in the context of what is happening musically. The lyrics are part Nietzschean philosophy, part dystopian predictions. \n\nHellhammer\u2019s drumming is also an important element here, like it always is. On \u2018Grand Declaration of War\u2019 the triggers are set to high, with his toms clicking and clacking like futuristic sounds from hell. The complexity of the arrangements written by Blasphemer are deftly handled by the great man, making this album one that 99% of the black metal scene simply could never have accomplished due to the technical complexity of the project. As always, Hellhammer is a joy to aurally behold. His cymbal and high-hat work is particularly impressive. \n\nA word on the recent release of the remixed and remastered version that includes sound replacement by Jaime Gomez Arellano (who ran Paradise Lost\u2019s \u2018Medusa\u2019 into the artificially muddy ground\u2026). Arellano was tasked with completely revamping the sound of the album, including replacing Hellhammer\u2019s overly triggered drums so that they sounded (in Arellano\u2019s words) \u201cmore like a real kit\u201d, as well as adding \u201cmore warmth\u201d to Blasphemer\u2019s guitar tone. He even \u201cbeefed up\u201d the bass sound. Essentially, the goal was to make \u2018Grand Declaration of War\u2019 sound less like the coldly atmospheric and savage beast, and more like any other metal album with today\u2019s technology. He succeeded, and the sum result was to nullify and surrender the cold metallic sound of a dystopian album in favour of warmer tones and less atmosphere. I own it as part of the collection and as a curiosity, but disdain it as the revisionist sabotaging that it essentially is. \n\nThe artwork on the original version is barbaric and mesmerising, with the dove caught in barbed-wire. The fold-out inlay is also excellent. My copy is signed by all four members after an in-store signing session back in about 2001 \u2013 a cherished memento (mori). \n\nOverall, \u2018Grand Declaration of War\u2019 is a challenging album, but so profoundly laced with imagination, skill and vision that it remains a classic of the black metal genre and one of Mayhem\u2019s greatest releases. As a follow-up to \u2018De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\u2019, it\u2019s a bold statement of confidence and individuality. While it doesn\u2019t quite have the all-inclusive atmosphere and mystique of its predecessor, it is nevertheless a classic. \n\nI\u2019ll finish with George Orwell\u2019s immortal words that seem to sum the album up: \u201cIf you want a vision of the future, imagine a boot stamping on the human face, forever.\u201d\n",
        "\nIn 1997 I was 17 years old and Mayhem were regularly featured in metal magazines once again, especially Terrorizer from the UK. I still have a copy of an issue of that publication from 97 with Mayhem on the cover. \n\nUnlike the controversies of previous years, this time it was about the creation of a new band and new music. The four exotic Norwegians staring out at me from the cover of that magazine represented the future, and at the time it was profoundly exciting. \n\n\u2018Wolf\u2019s Lair Abyss\u2019, evidently named at least in part after Hitler\u2019s Eastern Front headquarters, came only four years after the infamous turmoil \u2013 an unthinkably quick turnaround from band destruction to newly released material, especially by today's glacial standards of release. \n\nThe line-up was a stroke of genius. Maniac had re-joined after his work on \u2018Deathcrush\u2019 and, with longtime stalwarts Necrobutcher and Hellhammer, gave a sense of credibility and continuity to the ongoing project that was Mayhem. The only new member was Blasphemer, who was admittedly an uncertainty - could he maintain the magic created by Euronymous? Could one man carry that burden? \n\nLike a previous reviewer mentioned, \u2018Wolf\u2019s Lair Abyss\u2019 really does feel like its own album rather than an EP, despite only having a playing time of 25 minutes, such is the weight of its presence. The introduction \u2018The Vortex Void of Inhumanity\u2019, while sounding nothing like \u2018Silvester Anfang\u2019 from 'Deathcrush', serves a similar purpose to that piece in that it announces the band\u2019s (re)arrival, except this time with broad digital strokes and piercing electronic radio sounds. A new introduction for a new era that is forward-focused and unafraid of the future. Maniac announces that \u201cMilitant men in peaceful times attack themselves\u201d, and he would live up to those words with Dead-style self-harm on stage, a morbid correlation undoubtedly, yet I think a fitting one. On this release the intro is the sound of a sonic re-wiring; a restoration and reformation of the band. \n\nThe first track proper, \u2018I Am Thy Labyrinth\u2019, launches with a booming drum-roll into a quick-march classic sounding Euronymous-style riff before sliding into a blast beat that announces an intensity that would characterise the whole release. Maniac screams inhumanly and even presents some chant-like backing vocals during the track. It lays the new foundation for modern Mayhem.\n\n\u2018Fall of Seraphs\u2019 and \u2018Ancient Skin\u2019 feature some of Hellhammer\u2019s best off-kilter drum rhythms that are also emblematic of this era of the band, where a degree of technicality is injected into the Euronymous-driven template. Hellhammer is simply phenomenal, and it's clear that his technical dexterity contributed significantly to this band's success over the decades. He's playing is splendid. Interestingly, 'Ancient Skin' shares a similar riff pattern in its early stages to 'Funeral Fog' which preceded it and 'The Dying False King' which would follow. The three songs are dark, elegant and powerful. \n\nThe final track, \u2018Symbols of Bloodswords\u2019 contains a riff that would later appear on the more experimental \u2018Grand Declaration of War\u2019, connecting the two works, albeit fairly superficially. The band would later claim that 'Grand Declaration of War' was a thematic sequel to this EP, and it's not entirely clear why Mayhem would engineer such an awkward connection that has no real meaningful or need. Nevertheless, there it is. \n\nThe production, by the band with Knut and Garm from Arcturus - which I found somewhat surprising but there you go - is extreme and much denser and more chaotic than \u2018De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\u2019. The guitars are full and even dirty sounding, and Hellhammer\u2019s drums have introduced the triggers that would become his standard sound for the next several years. Maniac\u2019s screams sit on top of everything and complete the picture of extremity. It's amazing how unified this release is - the whole damn thing just works. \n\nIt was clear with \u2018Wolf\u2019s Lair Abyss\u2019 that Mayhem were committed to demonstrating that their existence was warranted. The inclusion of Blasphemer simply could not have been better, and Maniac's return was prophetic. While this line-up would go on to even better things with \u2018Grand Declaration of War\u2019, this EP is a grand statement of personal and philosophical artistry, and it propels the legend forward. Mayhem lives!\n",
        "\nIt's always galling to read reviews from people new to black metal and who have picked up a Mayhem album for the first time, only to find themselves surprised that the music isn't as attention grabbing as the band's history. \n\nThis leads to the inevitable 'overrated' claims, and an urge to diminish the band's musical output. Of course the band's history is a distraction, how could it not be? You think the Beatles' musical output wouldn't be overshadowed if Paul murdered Ringo and then John blew his brains out? You think people would still be talking about damned 'Strawberry Fields Forever'? \n\nI would argue that Mayhem's varied and complex musical output is the single greatest long-term achievement in black metal: from 1987's 'Deathcrush' to 2019's 'Daemon', the band, in its various guises, deserves great praise for a string of outstanding studio albums and live performance releases. \n\nThe third studio release to feature the blackly exquisite Maniac/Blasphemer songwriting partnership, \u2018Chimera\u2019 also sadly marks Maniac\u2019s final album with the band. It comes at an interesting time in the band\u2019s history, as well as black metal\u2019s evolution, with 2004 marking ten years since the release of \u2018De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\u2019. As the follow-up to the revolutionary \u2018Grand Declaration of War\u2019, I remember a palpable sense of anticipation when awaiting the release of \u2018Chimera\u2019, as the band\u2019s direction wasn\u2019t at all clear to predict at the time (and still isn't), and four years is a long time to wait when you're a man in your early 20s. \n\n\u2018Chimera\u2019 is more extreme, yet less flamboyant, than \u2018Grand Declaration of War\u2019. While that album was filled with experimental song structures and clean-voiced dictatorial oratory, \u2018Chimera\u2019 aims more for the jugular; it's fast, full and based around a more unified sense of tone. The electronics are gone, as are the post-modern gaps and shifts in the vibe. \n\nBlasphemer\u2019s riffs remain unmistakable, and as I was listening to it today it reminded me a lot of last year\u2019s Vltimas album. The structure of the riffs is very similar between these albums, and both bare the unmistakable Blasphemer trademark. He is a monolithic figure; a truly great artist. \n\nThe production on \u2018Chimera\u2019 is clear but with a degree of distortion to the sound that allows the frenetic and powerful songs to meet the listener up-close and with a brutal insistence. It\u2019s one of the most violent sounding albums in the Mayhem oeuvre, yet it retains the Blasphemer twisted riffage that takes the listener in unexpected directions. It is a very guitar-oriented sound, and the relatively complex riffs are punctuated by flourishes and decayed artistry that gives the tracks their flavour while never really allowing the listener to relax. It's a high-tension album. \n\nIn relation to performance, the album demonstrates the technical dexterity and musical flamboyance that Blasphemer and Hellhammer are known for, albeit with less experimentation than \u2018Grand Declaration of War\u2019. Necrobutcher\u2019s bass is in there somewhere, but it\u2019s certainly not prominent (except for the fantastic opening to \u2018Impious Devious Leper Lord\u2019 where it rolls along quite brilliantly) and it wouldn\u2019t really be until 2019 that he would stamp his presence on the sound once more. Maniac\u2019s vocals are simply phenomenal, as they always are, although he has eschewed the spoken word theatrics from \u2018Grand Declaration of War\u2019, instead locking into his emotive growls and a few snatches of whispered voices from hell. He sounds unhinged, as usual, but perhaps his narrower delivery is symptomatic of his impending exit from the band. \n\nThe songs are definitely excellent, although I must admit that it is not the most compelling collection that they would offer over the years. The highlight is undoubtedly the demonic \u2018My Death\u2019, with its haunting \u201cOdium humani generis\u201d chant that launches towards the end of a brilliant section of music starting around 3:30. It's a masterstroke and one of their greatest all time songs. Opening track \u2018Whore\u2019 is a lascivious fast-paced stab to the heart, while the final track, \u2018Chimera\u2019, bends and grooves its way serpent-like, even sexually, across a dark canvas. It\u2019s a brilliant song and even contains some subdued spoken oratory. Not every track is as spellbinding, however, and there are some stock moments that don\u2019t quite bring the magic to the same degree. I've often wondered why that is. Perhaps fatigue on the parts of both Maniac (obviously) and Blasphemer (evidently, considering where he would go with 'Ordo ad Chao'). \n\nThe packaging is certainly worth the purchase price. The cover artwork is from a 1922 silent movie and is suitably atmospheric, and my CD digibook version contains several fold out panels that contain some great band member shots as well as a hilarious movie-still of a group of nuns running for their lives. Tremendous. The lyrics in the booklet are very difficult to read but ok if you squint, and curiously there is a floor-plan of Hellhammer\u2019s drum layout which is pretty interesting, but a little too Tommy Lee in tone to fit the Mayhem aesthetic. \n\nOverall, I would doubt this would be anyone\u2019s favourite Mayhem album. It isn\u2019t mine. But it has its own identity and it\u2019s a powerful and compelling release to listen to and a welcome inclusion in the outstanding Mayhem catalogue.\n",
        "\nOf course, \"Daemon\" is not the second \"De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\" at all. Mayhem are Mayhem after all, so to repeat \"De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\" after such albums as \"Esoteric Warfare\" or \"Ordo ad Chao\" would mean taking a step back for them. But there was a long-felt need for the material like \"De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\" \u2013 the tour \"De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas Alive\" has demonstrated this clearly. Commercial profit, nostalgic charms, an existential crisis, the composer's passion, the appeals of fans (by the way, more often that not it's not so nice for musicians to hear \"your first album is the best\"...) \u2013 all this had to be given a vent. So, what would be the best solution for this? \n\nWell, on their new album Mayhem did the same \"trick\" as Metallica did on their latest album, \"Hardwired... to Self-Destruct\": echoes of the past are artfully mixed with modern techniques here. However, Metallica had a much wider scope of work: Mayhem are black metal and nothing more. Crudely speaking, \"Daemon\" = \"De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\" + \"Esoteric Warfare\". \"De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\" is primarily for listeners, and \"Esoteric Warfare\" is more for musicians. Crudely speaking. \n\nThus, \"De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\" is heard literally in every song. The \"Daemon\" material is mostly fast, aggressive and, of course, atmospheric: Mayhem spewed out vicious aggression from the very beginning, in the first song \"The Dying False King\" (music by Teloch), and pursued their point till the end. With some exceptions. If we disregard the polished sound, which is completely unusual and inapplicable for \"De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\", and therefore suggestive of some kind of \"plastic\" Mayhem, then most of the riffs were recreated in the spirit of this classic album. Right, more often than not they sound pretty convincing. This is not particularly surprising, taking into account that the new material was created during the \"De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas Alive\" tour \u2013 if you play just the same dozens, or even hundreds of times, sooner or later you will begin to think and compose in this manner. (On this album Ghul joined the current main composer Teloch.) \n\nBeyond dispute, a huge role in the \"resurrection\" of the spirit of the legendary album was played by the inimitable style of Attila's singing, in which maniacality / lunacy, screaming techniques, otherworldliness, guttural singing, and dramatism are mixed, and which is close to operatic singing style from time to time. The only problem is that with Attila's voice, anything will be like Mayhem, even Sunn O))). Regarding the operatic vocals, Attila uses this manner on \"Daemon\" more often than on \"De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\", however, not in every song (in the 1st, 4th, 7th, 11th, and 12th). Sometimes it seems that during the mixing his operatic vocals were put on the back burner a little bit, as, for example, in the very first song \"The Dying False King\". The technique that is uncharacteristic for Attila (more precisely, for \"De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\") can be heard only in the ninth song \"Of Worms and Ruins\" (by Ghul): from 1:24 Attila bellows out words in sync with the blast beat attack \u2013 as if spitting out words. In fairness, this is one of the wildest songs on the album, so it was logical to expect some uncharacteristic move here. \n\nIt is noteworthy that the songs that are most sustained in the style of the 1992-93 recording, are bonuses: \"Everlasting Dying Flame\" (by Teloch) and \"Black Glass Communion\" (by Ghul). Besides the fact that the riffs of the eleventh and twelfth tracks are more retro-styled than the rest, in \"Everlasting Dying Flame\" you can clearly hear the bass part completely in the manner of Count Grishnackh (as known, Necrobutcher himself did not take part in the recording of \"De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\"). The same melancholic, as if floating in a quiet backwater, bass guitar is present in the very first song \"The Dying False King\" \u2013 and this manner is not used in other songs on \"Daemon\". And in the finale of \"Black Glass Communion\" Attila sings almost identically, as in the last song of \"De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\". Well, they've made it very symbolically. To all effects and purposes, the decision not to include these tracks in the main material of the album seems quite reasonable: indeed, there was no need to repeat \"De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\" in such an explicit form. Well, for Mayhem themselves. \n\nConcerning other glaring retrospectives on the \"Daemon\" album, you should pay attention to \"Malum\" (by Ghul): there is a riff at 2:15, which sounds distinctly as it was copied from \"Pagan Fears\". After this riff, the composition also is progressing completely according to the templates of \"De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\". Ironically or insidiously, both songs \u2013 \"Malum\" and \"Pagan Fears\" \u2013 are the fourth on the albums. \n\nThe desire / demand to create an old-school-oriented album led to some \"incidents\". There is a riff at 3:15 in the third song \"Bad Blood\" (by Ghul) that sounds in the vein of the Swedish black metal school, something like early Dark Funeral. Too magnifical. And the fifth \"Falsified and Hated\" (by Teloch) begins (and then ends) with some riff of Emperor's \"In the Nightside Eclipse\". Too symphonic. Perhaps these two riffs are appropriate on this compromise (yep) album, but they are completely not in the vein of Mayhem \u2013 they give some optimism to the whole album sound and reduce to nothing the hopelessness of darkness. Throughout the album, you can hear some other \"strange\" riffs, however, these two songs attract the most attention. And \"Bad Blood\" is generally the most standing out from the entire album: even heavy metal riffs are used here, in addition, a guitar solo sounds completely unusually for Mayhem (both old-school and modernized), more importantly, absolutely not in the spirit of black metal. \n\nSo, if the riffs on \"Daemon\" are mostly old-school or close to this, then the structure of the songs, as a rule, already from the post-Euronymous era. An abnormal formation, this is what combines such different work as \"Esoteric Warfare\", \"Ordo ad Chao\" and \"A Grand Declaration of War\" (well, \"Chimera\" is irrelevant). The structure of the songs can even be called \"torn\" / \"jagged\": unexpected intermissions, sudden changes in rhythm, in season and out of season abstract guitar fingerpickings. However, the compositions are arranged cleanly, this \"raggedness\" does not cause discomfort. Moreover, due to the structure of songs, sometimes even a blast beat attack is perceived as some element of the avant-garde. \n\nIn some songs modernized Mayhem clearly defeats old-school Mayhem. So, the second \"Agenda Ignis\" (by Teloch) sounds overly avant-garde, especially when compared with \"De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\". The sixth \"Aeon Daemonium\" (by Teloch) begins with martial drums, a natural call to war sounds, but this is not a \"true\" black metal war, it is some otherworldly challenge, mysterious and schizophrenic. And the eighth \"Daemon Spawn\", one of the few slow songs on the album, including due to its avant-garde manner, turns out to be the most mystical composition. \n\nHowever, in some places the symbiosis of the riffs from \"De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\" and the structure of the songs of late Mayhem led to a strange, but quite natural result. This is clear as day that if you combine the \"true\" riffs with industrial-experimental techniques, you will get nothing other than Mysticum. An analogy with another Norwegian cult can be drawn too often: in the already mentioned \"Falsified and Hated\", the seventh \"Worthless Abominations Destroyed\" (by Teloch), the tenth \"Invoke the Oath\" (by Teloch) and the aforementioned \"Black Glass Communion\". \n\nIn \"Falsified and Hated\", in addition to the classic Mysticum's riffs and manner, coming at 4:49, the situation is aggravated by a periodically sounding part of the keyboards. And although the \"keyboard part\" is too loud term for the monotonous poking on the keys, these extracted sounds perfectly emphasize the development of the theme. But such a monotonous poking on the keyboards is Mysticum in all its glory, this is one of the \"schticks\" of \"In the Streams of Inferno\" (\"Let the Kingdom Come\" and \"Where the Raven Flies\", \"In Your Grave\" too, and schizophrenic ambient \"In the Last of the Ruins We Search for a New Planet\"). In its turn in \"Invoke the Oath\" to the accompaniment of an almost industrial riff, drums with a dry sound generate the rhythm that sounds like \"pum-pa pum-pa pum-pa\" (syncopated rhythm, if you need accuracy). But this is 100% Mysticum... \n\nWhatever the case, summing up, it can be said that by contrast with previous albums, there is no trace of innovation much less revolutionary on \"Daemon\". But the album was not created for this. Those who wanted another \"De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\" \u2013 they got theirs. Well, let it be! But \"Esoteric Warfare\" is better.\n",
        "\nThe mid 2000s was an interesting time for black metal, and I use the word \u2018interesting\u2019 to mean baffling. Bands like Blut Aus Nord and Deathspell Omega were breaking the barriers of second wave black metal to create dystopian soundscapes and sonic experiments that defied traditional rock-based structures, and lo, in 2007, it was Mayhem\u2019s turn to follow suit. \n\nI\u2019m implying a degree of plagiarism on behalf of the mighty Blasphemer here, but I think history has shown that he was more of a leader than a follower. \u2018Grand Declaration of War\u2019 is a brilliant album, and one that really laid the groundwork \u2013 admittedly along with others \u2013 that opened the gates to this sort of thing. Nevertheless, by 2007 there was a musical battlefield littered with non-traditional black metal releases. \n\nWhen Maniac left Mayhem after \u2018Chimera\u2019, it was the end of a supreme partnership between he and Blasphemer, and it was cause for deep mourning. I did take heart, however, when I heard that Attila was returning, but a return to a \u2018De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\u2019 style of songwriting would end up being deferred until 2019 when the man Teloch finally gave up being esoteric and started to get dark. Blasphemer had other ideas in 2007. \n\nAs outlined by my fellow reviewers here, \u2018Ordo ad Chao\u2019 (order to chaos) is a dense, anti-rhythmic and atonal work which transforms god-like Mayhem into an extended experiment. The production is dense, dark and smothered, and the music changes direction, pace and trajectory every few seconds. It is, essentially, Blasphemer\u2019s grand farewell and a middle finger to pretty much everyone, including Hellhammer who deserves a medal for being able to keep up with this multi-headed beast. His drumming here is nothing short of miraculous, and I can only pity the man and the hours of rehearsal this would have required. Far beyond poor old Necrobutcher\u2019s ken, Blasphemer handled most of the bass duties too. \n\nWhile the album can be enjoyed purely by listening to Hellhammer, Attila\u2019s vocals also offer some entertainment. He does a great job here \u2013 much better than he would on \u2018Esoteric Warfare \u2013 although due to the structure of the songs, it sounds more like a collection of vocal samples than actual tracks designed to communicate. It's a growl here, a shriek there, a groan in the next part. \n\nIdentifying standout tracks is a futile ambition, as every song sounds more or less the same despite the frenetic shifts constantly afoot. \u2018A Wise Birthgiver\u2019 is an atmospheric and sinister opening, beginning slowly and with a grand heaviness underscored by eerie guitar picking and sound effects. As a 27 year old having purchased this pretty much on release day, I thought, what the fuck\u2019s going on, my disc is broken. \u2018Wall of Water\u2019 retains some of the Blasphemer riffing style that has made him great, but it\u2019s folded into a dough of obscurity. The rest of the album follows this labyrinthine pathway, although a highlight for me is the final movement of 'Illuminate Eliminate' which is huge and epic. \n\nThe artwork is also worthy of comment. My CD version comes in a tin, and the jewel case is a deep ruby red. The booklet contains the indecipherable stream of consciousness lyrics and some distorted digital patterns that I don\u2019t find particularly intriguing, but I suppose are in keeping with the theme. \n\nSome people love this album and I can definitely see why. However, despite it having a certain majesty of the swamp when played loudly on a good stereo, I\u2019m generally not one of them. It\u2019s too-clever-by-half, and too much of a personal statement from Blasphemer that I just can\u2019t embrace honestly. There's never a dull moment, but it's all strangely dull. \n\nI admire this release, but I don\u2019t feel affection for it. That\u2019s probably the point, and Blasphemer leaves as a winner.\n",
        "\nWhen the mighty Blasphemer announced that he was leaving Mayhem after the artistic mess of \u2018Ordo ad Chao\u2019, it seemed that the most sensible thing for the band to do was to recognise that the end was upon them, and retire. \n\nHaving guided the band through the post-Euronymous period, Blasphemer was the architect of some brilliant releases, and together with Maniac formed a musical symbiosis that kept the spirit of Mayhem alive. By stepping away from the band he was leaving a plethora of \u2018what ifs\u2019 in his wake. \n\nIn comes someone called Teloch. The new boy faced a huge battle to maintain the standard and even forge new territory in honour of the legacy, and it was almost unfair that he had such huge songwriting responsibility placed upon his shoulders, as \u2018Esoteric Warfare\u2019 is entirely composed by the new man. It can be considered something of a hazing experience. Imagine being locked in a room and being told to write the new Mayhem album. It seems an impossible task. As the follow-up to the impenetrable (darkness) of \u2018Ordo ad Chao\u2019, where was he to go? What was he to do? Legend has it that the first version of this album was so poor that it was rejected by the rest of the guys. One can only imagine...\n\nAs I\u2019ve pointed out in my glowing review of \u2018Daemon\u2019, an album which mercifully reignited my faith in the band, Teloch has demonstrated a grand declaration of talent and is now one of metal\u2019s greatest creators. \u2018Daemon\u2019 is a masterpiece, yet that potential is unfortunately missing from \u2018Esoteric Warfare\u2019 and in 2014 \u2013 seven long years after \u2018Ordo\u2019 - things were looking grim for all the wrong reasons. \n\nFirstly, there is the bizarre confusion surrounding what \u2018Esoteric Warfare\u2019 even represents. The uninspiring brown artwork, the post-soviet lyrics, the foolish song titles such as \u2018VI.Sec\u2019 and \u2018Corpse of Care\u2019 - this latter apparently to do with former US Presidents burning effigies at their summer camp or something ridiculous like that. I can't have that correct. At any rate, it\u2019s all a strange mess of unattainable concepts that obviously mean something to the band, but to the listener are virtually incomprehensible. There is no grounding to the album, no sense of starting point. The inside of the booklet seems to be some kind of Gestapo manifesto, so I presume it\u2019s playing off some kind of Cold War iron curtain shtick. \n\nMusically, \u2018Esoteric Warfare\u2019 steps back from its predecessor\u2019s nonsensical anti-rhythms (thank satan) and puts forward at least a clearer sense of riffage that can be followed and potentially understood by listeners. I say potentially because it\u2019s still a pretty esoteric listening experience, and I wouldn\u2019t class it as a particularly enjoyable one. It\u2019s a musical mathematical equation that stops and starts more unexpectedly than my old lawnmower, tripping over itself as it strives to be impressive and clever. The songwriting is clearly playing off Blasphemer\u2019s \u2018Grand Declaration of War\u2019 template, yet unlike that brilliant album, here it doesn\u2019t quite work. \n\nThe razor-wire guitars seem to borrow sonically from Thorns\u2019 2001 album in their sterile harshness, and they essentially sound like the Moonfog albums from the early 21st century. It\u2019s a cold sound, rendered largely unengaging due to the lack of any real melodic moments. It's all strangely monotonal and one dimensional. Despite this, the riffs are played competently and it\u2019s clear that Teloch does have technical ability. \n\nHellhammer\u2019s playing is exceptional, as usual, although his thinly triggered drums rocket along with a pace that, when combined with the mechanical sound of the guitars, leaves little for the listener to get behind. Necrobutcher\u2019s bass is generally absent, and Attila growls confusedly across the whole thing. It\u2019s interesting to compare Attila\u2019s flaccid performance here to that of \u2018Daemon\u2019. Like the songwriting and production, he too moves far away from this limited roadblock of a sound. \n\nDue to the uniformity of the sound it is nearly impossible to differentiate between songs and I challenge anyone to be able to hum a single riff. The first two tracks are probably the best, with 'Watchers' in particular offering a hint of atmosphere, albeit a numbingly sterile one. \u2018Trinity\u2019 contains some effective air-raid siren sound effects, and \u2018Corpse of Care\u2019 descends into a slow nekro beat before picking up again into a business as usual quick march. The final track \u2018Aion Suntelia\u2019 is a delirious nightmare of sick rhythms and strange time signatures, and I don't mean in a good way. \n\nNow that \u2018Daemon\u2019 has been released and redeemed this band, \u2018Esoteric Warfare\u2019 can take its place in the discography as a strange quirk \u2013 an experiment that didn\u2019t quite work. In that context it's not the end of the world. In fact, it can be enjoyable to put on occasionally. \n\nUltimately, however, it\u2019s hard to listen to this for more than twenty minutes before taking the disc out of the stereo with a head-scratch and a yearning for some music that actually means something.\n",
        "\nIt has been unendingly fascinating and profoundly rewarding for this reviewer to follow Mayhem over the last 25 years. The chimerical beast has presented manifold forms and styles within the black metal template, whether it\u2019s the earnestly youthful nihilism of \u2018Deathcrush\u2019 or the too-clever-by-half mindfuck of \u2018Ordo ad Chao\u2019. \n\nIndeed, one of metal\u2019s most remarkable facts is that Mayhem has been darkly blessed with two stunning vocalist/guitarist duos throughout its history, being the Dead/Euronymous and Maniac/Blasphemer dyads. If the band only ever had one of these combinations I would consider them outstanding; having had both suggests a deal with the devil. \n\nIt was with significant disappointment, therefore, that the eventual exit of both Maniac and Blasphemer occurred. Yes, Attila returned for \u2018Ordo ad Chao\u2019, but when sole musical creator Blasphemer hung up his sacrilegious boots after that album I thought it might be time for the band to finally fold. After all, bringing in Teloch \u2013 the third guitarist and songwriter in Mayhem\u2019s existence \u2013 seemed like a bridge too far and a move that was doomed to fail. The compositional engine-room was drifting further and further away from the essence and purpose of the band. From a songwriting perspective, it was third generation Mayhem. \n\n\u2018Esoteric Warfare\u2019 was all the evidence I needed to have my suspicion confirmed. A sterile, alienating release, it made little sense sonically, thematically and lyrically. Yet history has now shown how Teloch has redeemed himself. \u2018Daemon\u2019 is a triumphant and august work that channels everything great about a Mayhem that I thought had been lost forever. \n\nFirstly, the darkness, the detail and the atmosphere of this album are the products of a songwriting talent and compositional understanding that deserves great praise. The degree of care and attention that the music has received is abundantly evident. There are so many elements in the sound that reveal themselves through repeated playings; nothing has been rushed and no corners have been cut. The mastering is sensible and tasteful \u2013 there is no chance of ear fatigue and it all sounds relatively organic and free from over-production. The layering, transitions, effects and subtle details in the musical landscape are the sign of a band that is serious about creating meaningful and lasting art. It is essentially the opposite of 21st century Darkthrone\u2019s throwaway weekend-metal releases, and it is an affirmation of true artistic achievement. I hope Fenriz has heard this album. \n\nOne of the unexpected points of interest here is the broad spread of songwriting credits. For the mediabook edition, with two bonus tracks, Teloch, the overseer of this anthology of anthems, has written the music for eight songs and the lyrics for seven, while Hellhammer and Necrobutcher both have lyrics credited to them. Second guitarist Ghul \u2013 who is actually former Cradle of Filth guitarist Charles Hedger \u2013 has written the music for four absolutely cracking tracks: \u2018Bad Blood\u2019, \u2018Malum\u2019, \u2018Of Worms and Ruins\u2019 and \u2018Black Glass Communion\u2019. He also wrote the lyrics for two of these. The sense of unity and shared vision here is refreshing and effective; there is a true sense of a band. \n\nThe performances are unsurprisingly excellent. Hellhammer is the master of his drumming craft, playing with flamboyance and precision, while to his credit the drums sound organic, powerful and not overly triggered. Teloch and Ghul outdo themselves with the serpentine technicality of these highly melodic riffs. The confidence and ability on show is mesmerising. Even Necrobutcher, whose bass has taken a backseat since \u2018Grand Declaration of War\u2019 two decades ago, finally comes to the fore with some heavy work that reminds of the glory days of \u2018Freezing Moon\u2019 and even \u2018Chainsaw Gutsfuck\u2019. The sections here when the music stops to allow the bass to drive the moment are a sign of powerful confidence from the band and adds texture to the soundscape. Atilla, meanwhile, is a man of many voices, and this is probably his best performance ever for the band. \n\nThe songs themselves are varied and engaging. \u2018The Dying False King\u2019 begins with an energised riff that reminds of \u2018Funeral Fog\u2019, while \u2018Malum\u2019 is slow, ponderously heavy and supremely atmospheric. \u2018Daemon Spawn\u2019, with its haunting introduction, progresses to a doom-march from the depths of hell with its powerful mid-paced refrain. \u2018Bad Blood\u2019 includes a dexterous guitar solo, while \u2018Of Worms and Ruins\u2019 launches with an imperious tremolo riff before evolving into blasting glory. Final track of the standard edition \u2018Invoke the Oath\u2019 employs some subtle yet effective additional percussive tones that contribute to an epic and unholy atmosphere. Both bonus tracks maintain the magick and really deserve to be on the album proper. \n\nThe artwork and packaging is also worthy of high praise. The mediabook with slipcase is stunning, with evocative artwork and lyrics inside the thick booklet. Like the music on the disc, no compromise has been taken with the packaging; the degree of care that has gone into the visual component here is exceptional. \n\nThere is no denying a palpable sense of the \u2018De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\u2019 style on 'Daemon', yet its distance from that classic ensures a paradoxical freshness and uniqueness. It's an evolution on from that album, not simply a copy. While not entirely perfect, and not quite as haunting as its immortal predecessor 'De Mysteriis', \u2018Daemon\u2019 is nevertheless as exciting as it was unexpected. \n\nA homage to the band\u2019s glory days, it is at the same time ambitious, modern and unique. I never thought I would see the day, yet here it is. It\u2019s a triumph.\n",
        "\nI watched the excellent Lords of Chaos last night that prompted me to check out Mayhem's music once again. I realized that the background story, legacy and image of the black metal quintet is actually much more interesting than most of its actual music.\n\nThe band's sixth studio record in its thirty-fifth year of existence convinces with bleak, desperate and mysterious atmosphere. The oppressive guitar melodies and the expressive guttural vocals are certainly the strongest elements. This release has a cohesive style and clear guiding line from start to finish. A few songs manage to stand out among the twelve tunes on the special edition. The bleak ''Falsified and Hated'' with radio play overture and mysterious melodies in the middle section is filled with numerous intriguing ideas. The heavily atmospheric closer ''Invoke the Oath'' would be the perfect soundtrack for any gothic horror movie. The diversified bonus track ''Everlasting Dying Flame'' with its sluggish pace and multiple vocal styles is this record's hidden pearl in my opinion. The other bonus song ''Black Glass Communion'' is also noteworthy for its dramatic short passage featuring classical clean vocal efforts.\n\nOn the other side, the songwriting is often really bland and repetitive as almost all tracks follow the same formula and ideas. The bass guitar very rarely stands out. The drum play is mostly just fast and only convinces in the few more atmospheric breaks. The cold guitar riffs often sound the same. The vocals don't always exploit their entire outstanding potential.\n\nIn the end, Mayhem is a brand, image and symbol for true Norwegian black metal and a band whose members were once pioneers with their revolutionary ideas. Nowadays, Mayhem is only one of many black metal bands. Daemon certainly checks all the cases for genre trademarks but overall fails to leave a deeper impression. The album rushes by and leaves the listener slightly disappointingly waiting for something more. Mayhem's historic significance is undisputed but nowadays, there are numerous more obscure black metal bands who perform with more bravery, creativity and emotions.\n",
        "\nSo the 'Henhouse Recordings' have been released on CD by good old Peaceville, just as I'd hoped.\n\nIt came out January 24th on CD, and several months earlier on vinyl. When I saw it on vinyl I was really hoping it would get a CD release, and like all patient maniacs it eventually came to me. It's a recording of a rehearsal from 1989 and features the mighty Dead, Euro, Necro, Hellhammer line-up, and seems to be (sort of) two run-throughs of their then setlist, as we have a few songs repeated. \n\nJust to save everyone the hassle of listening to it, the sound is pretty bad. I'm a perverted Mayhem apologist, but even for me this sound is terrible. Don't expect a great deal of sonic precision. It really is a tape-deck style recording. But what an atmosphere it captures. It's as if you're in the room with them, sitting in a corner, watching history. If you want to be there, this is 100%. If you don't, it's a tough listen. \n\nIt says a lot about the appetite for Mayhem CDs when this thing can be released on a decent label and people like me buy it. The reason it's taken 31 years to come out is because in the past people wouldn't have tolerated this shit. There aren't even any real liner-notes or discussion on Mayhem, because it's all been covered on the previous 3 or 4 live CDs Peaceville have released. I think Peaceville have given up and are now just releasing literally everything they have come hell or high water and can't be fucked interviewing Metalion and Faust about their first Mayhem experiences again. \n\nIt's still cool though. The talking between songs, mostly at the start of the disk, is interesting even though it's in Norwegian, as it's always special to hear Dead and Euronymous's speaking voices. You can't hear a lot of Dead's vocals on the songs, probably due to where the tape recorder is set up, but you can hear the (admittedly fleeting) between-song banter really clearly. \n\nI have so many versions of the songs 'Deathcrush' and 'Freezing Moon' by now, and these two songs appear twice on this disk! I think I probably have 21 unique versions of 'Freezing Moon' in the collection. I'm too afraid to actually do a full audit. \n\nBy far the most interesting aspect of the release is Track 7 (Untitled). Remember back in 1997 when you were listening to Emperor's 'Anthems to the Welkin at Dusk' and the booklet said that the intro to 'Ye Entrancemperium' was written by Euronymous? Well, here it is, Track 7 on this recording! It's the intro to this song, and it's actually the same speed, key and everything, as far as I can tell. Sort of amazing to hear that opening played here and I certainly wasn't expecting it. This is a really interesting inclusion for the collector. \n\nAnother valuable moment is when Dead introduces the second version of 'Freezing Moon' on the disk with his classic \"When it's cold, when it's dark...\" quote, albeit delivered in a spoken word style rather than growled. It's curious to realise that they did it during rehearsals as well as when they would later play live. \n\nThere's also a DVD with this release which I'm too afraid to play because I know I'm going to get some unwatchable grainy footage like the other live releases. The fact that live footage exists for all of these shows and rehearsals at all is a damn miracle. For this release, I'll save it for a (very) rainy day. \n\nIf I'm being objective, this wouldn't score very highly. But as an artefact of Norwegian black metal's rich history and a chronicle of Dead and Euro's work, this is a welcome addition to the surprisingly healthy reservoir of Mayhem material from the old days. You need to decide for yourself whether you need this or not. I do. Many won't.\n",
        "\nAs with my review of \u2018Deathcrush\u2019 - befitting my 25 year following of this magnificent band - I will eschew any asinine discussion of historical events, and any use of cultural commentary to downplay the album. I will instead focus on the musicality of \u2018De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\u2019, whilst considering its context.\n\nThe debut full-length album is an unmitigated success and one of metal\u2019s greatest accomplishments. Despite being released in 1994, it was recorded in 1992, an astounding reality when one considers the tone, style and structure of the album in that early stage of Norwegian black metal. It was ahead of its time, is of its time, and defies its time. It is universal. \n\nThe most immediately obvious aspect of the album is the production. The sound is darkness incarnate, yet there also a decaying warmth to the overall tone that provides a paradoxical sense of fire and ice. Pytten\u2019s production in Grieghallen is a masterclass in how to record black metal. Unlike the myriad of albums he recorded there, this one somehow transcends the crisp coldness that characterises early 90s Grieghallen black metal, and it takes on an undead life of its own. Devoid of keyboards, it is chilling to think that the sound of the album was achieved simply with guitars, bass and drums. \n\nEuronymous\u2019 guitars sound phenomenal. He performs with precision yet also a palpable sense of emotion, and the effect is one of consummate yet rebellious darkness. The tone is full and powerful. The style of playing, essentially invented by he and Snorre Ruch \u2013 although I believe Snorre gets more credit in this than is warranted given his meagre extant musical output \u2013 is at its peak on this release and sets the template for a genre. \n\nThe other genre-defining performance here is that of Hellhammer, whose unutterable drumming skill is complemented by a booming tone summoned from the depths; the product of Pytten\u2019s ingenious placement of the kit in the great hall. He is technical, groovy and hard-hitting; a seemingly paradoxical assessment, yet a true one. His performance far, far, outshines any of his contemporaries at this time \u2013 and perhaps since. \n\nReceived knowledge of the bass is that it was turned down in the mix for reasons I won\u2019t go into here, but I find this assertion hard to believe. The bass is full and clearly present, leading the way on tracks like \u2018Cursed in Eternity\u2019 and \u2018Life Eternal\u2019. The bass is superb and sounds to me exactly as it was intended, especially when it moves away from the guitar riffs and follows its own pattern and melody. \n\nThere is no getting around a discussion of Attila\u2019s vocals, nor is such a detour necessary. Yes, his style with its pseudo-operatically decomposed vocalisations is atypical, and comparisons of the same tracks with Dead\u2019s voice allow for easy, if odious, commentary. However, he makes these songs his own, and over time they have become inseparable to the tracks on this album. His creativity and courage to forge new territory assist in raising this album to a place of uniqueness. Attila plays a fundamental role in the genius of the album, and there is little point in hypothetical rumination about what-ifs and should-have-beens. \n\nYet all of this would be futile without songs. And songs we have. \u2018Funeral Fog\u2019 is the perfect opener with its urgent pacing and its gear changes, while \u2018Freezing Moon\u2019 remains black metal\u2019s single greatest moment and the pinnacle of what is possible in the genre. Its slow, graveyard lurch, its lyrical odes to the night sky, its acknowledgement of insatiable internal hunger \u2013 it is a masterpiece in every way. Other tracks are brilliant too, with the aforementioned \u2018Life Eternal\u2019 swinging melodically, and the closing title track offering a grandiose operatic ritual to the dark lord of us all. \n\nThe album cover is evocative and haunting, with the blue-tinged Nidaros Cathedral defying its Christian usage and appearing as a house of darkness; a palace of iniquity. Rumours of its intended destruction remain unverified. The cover retains its title as an image that defines Norwegian black metal. \n\nOne could go on writing reams of praise for this album, yet its true worth is in the playing and the experience of listening to it. It far surpasses anything recorded in 1992, and indeed it remains one of the greatest black metal albums of all time. And so it shall ever be.\n",
        "\nThere is a tendency for some critics to overcorrect in their attempt to provide what they perceive to be a level assessment of Mayhem's musical output. Accusations of 'story' over 'substance' have become the catch-cry of those who simply observe the 'story' in its various formats. For me, Mayhem's discography, both studio and live, is stunningly varied, adventurous and staggeringly effective across its various line-ups - even miraculously so. My 25 year following of the band is based on music, and I write not as a disinterested cultural observer, but as a lifelong and earnest fan. And the music began here. \n\nAfter the extremely rough demo tape that was \u2018Pure Fucking Armageddon\u2019, the first official release came as a watershed \u2013 an explosive combination of attitude and passion that became destiny. It is one of the most entertaining and impacting debut releases of any band.\n\nFirstly, it\u2019s incredible to think that \u2018Deathcrush\u2019 was released in 1987, the same year that Bathory\u2019s \u2018Under the Sign of the Black Mark\u2019 and Sarcofago\u2019s \u2018INRI\u2019 came out, making it essentially a first wave release. It needs to be viewed in this context, as the embryonic worldwide black metal movement took its first foetid gasps of air, with one rag-tag band from Norway spewing itself forth prior to a clear philosophical agenda that would later become True Norwegian Black Metal. Yet it is also the first chapter of this new movement. Like the medieval view of the Colossus of Rhodes, Mayhem straddle both sides of the vast harbour that is black metal. \n\nAt just over 18 and a half minutes in length, \u2018Deathcrush\u2019 is a surprisingly compact entity, yet listening to it yields a deceptive sense of completeness due to its variety, its production and also its extremity. The introduction, \u2018Silvester Anfang\u2019 by Conrad Schnitzler has become a classic foreboding passage, and I can still recall hearing it booming through the darkness at the beginning of the first Mayhem show I saw back in 2001. It\u2019s such a unique and haunting piece \u2013 almost impossible to describe in words \u2013 with its percussive rhythms and distorted pacing building and rising like an approaching devil from the pit. It\u2019s an inspired moment for Mayhem and a sign of the true freedom that characterises this release. \n\nThe metal tracks are vibrant, powerful and musical, and they seem to grow more entertaining as the years go by. The title track\u2019s main riff is part groove, part thrash, and reeks of attitude, and after the opening guitar salvo it bursts into life with drums and vocals beginning simultaneously to huge effect. Its mid-paced lashing of power is the perfect juxtaposition to the frenetic blast-led sections that follow. Maniac\u2019s vocal phrasing and pacing across the verse is idiosyncratic yet paradoxically perfect. \u2018Chainsaw Gutsfuck\u2019 chugs with sickening menace; Euronymous\u2019s guitar and Necrobutcher\u2019s bass combining as one sonic movement that funnels into the groove, while Maniac\u2019s voice bounces in pained synchronisation. \u2018Necrolust\u2019 with its two-hit introductory phase develops into a razor chug that in turn picks up into a distorted galloping riff; it\u2019s a work of deceptively simple genius. The off-kilter piano piece \u2018(Weird) Manheim\u2019 is an effective palate cleanser before \u2018Pure Fucking Armageddon\u2019 announces a loss of control: morally, musically and philosophically, and it is a fittingly morbid adieu.\n\nThe sound here is stunning. Euronymous\u2019s guitar tone is savagely superlative and merges like necromancy with Necrobutcher\u2019s bass work. Manheim\u2019s drumming reflects the overall attitude of the release with its refusal to conform to the more stylised thrash patterns of the epoch, and while it lacks the technical dexterity of Hellhammer\u2019s later mastery, it fits the \u2018Deathcrush\u2019 style with decayed aplomb. Maniac\u2019s voice is raw, youthful and savage, and although he will go on to refine it in later years, here it melds perfectly with the soundtrack beneath it \u2013 it is far more expressive than Messiah\u2019s contributions, although these too are effective in their context. \n\nThe evocative and iconic album artwork remains a cultural touchstone, and the story of the pink first pressing of the LP adds a sense of Spinal Tap light-heartedness to the social and musical context. The now legendary band member photos on the back are similarly iconic. \n\n\u2018Deathcrush\u2019, it its 1987 context, is a work of stylish extremity and groundbreaking endeavour. Today, it remains a glorious statement of rebellion and attitude. It's a great metal release.\n",
        "\nFirst of all, let me put this out there to be upfront with some that might not value my opinion based on the next sentence. I loved Esoteric Warfare. Quite a bit, actually. The previous two Chimera and Ordo ad Chao were solid, but my goodness was Grand Declaration of War absolute garbage. De Mysterious Dom Sathanas is infamous and deserves some praise. It has a great raw anger and mystery that's hardly matched, but Mayhem as a band has grown up. This album really carries the torch from their last album. There's a definite progression over the course of the band and I like to. The first song here is rather bland so maybe that one let me down just to build me back up because \"Agenda Ignis\" is one of the best on the album. Don't be discouraged by he first track.\n\nThe album overall has a little bit for everyone. There is plenty of Mayhems classic style in full force here. There's the more modern sound with a lack of guitars and creepy vocals and splayed out drums. There's the slower drawn out ringing chord sections, the big bombastic moments with the cleaner chant-like vocals. It's all over the place, and I love it for that. It touches on all of their career. There's even a callback to their worst album, A Grand Declaration of War at 0:51 on \"Agenda Ignis\" and another at 1:42 on \"Falsified and Hated\". There's a few more experimental sections like that, which help add some flair and help segregate these songs.\n\nThe guitars are as unique as ever. Rune Erikksen (\"Blasphemer\") brought his unmistakable sound to this year's supergroup Vltimas (a spectacular release) with David Vincent and Flo Mournier. I respect when you can have a recognizable play style like Rune that has stayed on in Mayhem. It's not just how he plays the guitar but the tone. It's not over-fuzzed or distorted which helps the segmentation of his chords, which he does frequently. The savage opening riff on \"Bad Blood\" could be lost if the guitar were over-fuzzed or the production too muddy. That track has riffs aplenty with a couple higher notes to spice things up right before it gets stale. The tracks \"Malum\" and \"Falsified and Hated\" starts off with an extremely Mayhem section that I adore. The two new boys picked up right where Rune left off and are doing great at it. Both Esoteric Warfare and this release have awesome riffs and hit Mayhem vibe dead center.\n\nThe vocals are in good form here as ever. There's experimentation, especially on \"Aeon Daemonium\", but it never becomes silly like on Grand Declaration of War. It has the right amount of boundary pushing. Similar to what's found on Esoteric Warfare. The patterns are great but Attila's unmistakable vocal sound is even better. The bass shines through fairly often but doesn't do much with it. I could at most points easily distinguish the bass but I started to ignore it. There's a section on the opening track where it breaks away. Overall the drums are fairly straightforward, but there are quite a few of the slower sections where he can experiment. \"Daemon Spawn\" has plenty so listen to that for a good example. This drummer shines when the music is chill.\n\nThe writing is some of this band's best material. Each song sounds incredibly distinct from each other. The bounciness of \"Falsified and Hated\", the evil aggression of \"The Dying False King\", the preparation of war on \"Aeon Daemonium\", the frenzied flurry on \"Of Worms and Ruin\", the mysticism of \"Daemon Spawn\", or the ferocity of \"Bad Blood\". The only song I say is a waste of space is \"Worthless Abominations Destroyed\". There are hooks aplenty from all departments and each instrument offers its own chunk to chew on. This band feels like they still have something to prove and I'm all in.\n\nFavorite tracks:\n-Agenda Ignis\n-Falsified and Hated\n-Daemon Spawn\n\nTechnical Skill: 81% Originality: 87% Song writing: 90% Production: 85%\n",
        "\nThis is the first Mayhem release that I've truly liked other than 'De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas'. Only a select few from this band that I enjoy, their latest 'Daemon' is a gem. It captures that eerie feel to it like the old, but is a little bit less grim. Being that Euronymous is dead doesn't matter on here, it's like a carrying off from where 'De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas' left. The whole album is good. The music, production and vocals are just purely likeable especially if you like dark black metal. Some bands are even more depressing to listen to and don't listen to this on a dark day of yours unless you want to be more depressed.\n\nAttila and Hellhammer are the backbone to this band/album. The guitars are good as well. The riffs are pretty original like the old Mayhem and this is why the album is so monumental. It truly is a staple in their discography. 'Daemon' is everything that I'd hoped it to be. Dark, depressing, eerie, original and grim. I actually just went ahead and bought the CD first without prior knowledge of how it would sound, in faith that it'd be everything I'd hoped for. And it was and is. The production is superb and the music just grapples it all.\n\nI'd say download it first on Spotify, especially because it comes with bonus tracks. The CD itself in full-length is about 49+ minutes. It's good the whole way through. I love Attila's original vocals still. It's so wicked. And the guitars are done with precision. The songwriting on here is great and the leads are awesome as well. Not letting up here, this band is the best when it comes to delivering great black metal. I'd say it's probably one of their best releases ever. It's a bold statement but it's what I'm hearing everytime I listen to this album! Everyone in the music community should support this band!\n\nAnyway, like I said, download it first and then buy the physical copy to show the band support. They really tear it up on here and despite the mood you're in I'm sure you'll like this. Every track is good. The intensity is there as is the unique vocals. The riffs are genuinely good. Probably a better riff-writer than Euronymous himself. But they're picking up where that album left off! Nothing can duplicate the early days but as long as they stay true to their roots, enjoy every minute of this one! They really know how to entertain with solemn music likeable to the select few. Own it!\n",
        "\nIt would be disingenuous to expect Mayhem\u2019s sixth full-length to achieve the classic sound of De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas, but the band also hasn\u2019t sounded this natural in a long time. The production is very well balanced, sidestepping the industrial precision of 2014\u2019s Esoteric Warfare but avoiding the lo-fi claustrophobia of 2007\u2019s Ordo Ad Chao. The guitars are earthy, the drumming sounds organic, and the bass maintains a sturdy presence throughout with the occasional shining segment.\n\nEven with a more orthodox style at work, any project with Attila Csihar on vocals is bound to make the most of his predictable unpredictability. The bulk of his delivery consists of his signature growling bellow but there\u2019s plenty of room for throat singing, distant operatic warbling, and contorted roars. The instrumental layers may be rather straightforward in comparison, but the guitars do a great job of serving up theatrical buildups and intricate riffs.\n\nSaid riffs aren\u2019t quite on the ear catching level of the classics, but the songwriting serves up plenty of memorable numbers. \u201cThe Dying False King\u201d wastes no time in setting up the blasting onslaughts to follow but \u201cFalsified and Hated\u201d makes for the best example thanks to its off-kilter sound effects. A more atmospheric direction is set up with \u201cMalum\u201d and \u201cAeon Daemonium\u201d that reaches its full height with the symphonic swells of \u201cDaemon Spawn\u201d and \u201cInvoke the Oath.\u201d\n\nOverall, Daemon isn\u2019t quite the second coming of classic Mayhem but it\u2019s their best album since at least 2004\u2019s Chimera. The album would\u2019ve benefitted from a shorter runtime and the ingredients are all pretty much meat and potatoes, but the performances are lively, and the songwriting is dynamic enough to keep from feeling stale. The black metal world has more revolutionary things going on elsewhere but it\u2019s nice to stop by and see the band still holding up nicely.\n\nHighlights:\n\u201cMalum\u201d\n\u201cFalsified and Hated\u201d\n\u201cAeon Daemonium\u201d\n\u201cDaemon Spawn\u201d\n\u201cInvoke the Oath\u201d\n\nOriginally published at http://psychicshorts.blogspot.com\n",
        "\nStanding the test of time is no easy task for a band. Lineup changes, shifts in the artistic direction, lack of creativity: the possible obstacles on the way are many, and the risk to fall in the realms of repetitiveness grows stronger with each passing day. This is nothing, however, when compared to the hardships Mayhem had to endure during their thirty years of existence. The death of guitarist, songwriter and founding member Euronymous at the hands of Varg Vikernes (who, for those who forgot, was handling the bass guitar duties during the recording of \u201cDe Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\u201d) sure gave an incredible dose of mediatic attention to this Norwegian ensemble, if we want to put it in a cynical way, but on the other hand, the event split forever the black metal scene, threatening the very survival not only of the band, but of the whole black metal movement.\n\nNonetheless, Mayhem survived, and, through numerous lineup changes and with each following release, they were able to carry on their ferocious and uncompromising brand of extreme music. So, here we are in 2019, and, twenty-five years after the release of their legendary first full-length, Mayhem are here to give us once again a lesson in how black metal should be done. Indeed, after an experimental and often debated phase of their musical evolution, the band opted for a \u201cback to the roots\u201d approach, and the result is Daemon, an album that stands as the direct successor of \u201cDe Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\u201d, and represents not only a monumentary opus in the band\u2019s discography, but also a real declaration of intents. \n\nAs I said above, \u201cDaemon\u201d opts for a direct and uncompromising approach, achieved through a style reminiscent of \u201cDe Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\u201d, but not without throwing in tiny but significative bits of innovation, that, matched by an excellent songwriting level, result in a ferocious and thrilling album, thus succeeding in bringing back to life the atmosphere of the true Norwegian black metal scene, while also carefully avoiding to end up being a carbon copy of the band\u2019s first works. Mayhem indeed prove to be amazing songwriters, providing a platter of ten (twelve if you get the bonus tracks edition) different songs, all pervaded by a strong sense of cohesion, while at the same time retaining a well-distinct identity one from the other. Guitarists Ghul and Teloch grace us with a real riff fest, and are able to keep things interesting through an intricate and varied guitar work, matched by an equally amazing performance by the legendary Hellhammer behind the kit.\n\nWe have indeed shorter and straight to the point songs, such as the album opener or the first two singles, namely \u201cWorthless Abominations Destroyed\u201d and \u201cOf Worms and Ruins\u201d, and some that are longer and somewhat reminiscent of the more experimental side of the band, for example \u201cFalsified and Hated\u201d, featuring a simplistic but incredibly effective and bone-chilling synth arrangement, or the vaguely post-black sounding \u201cDaemon Spawn\u201d and \u201cInvoke the Oath\u201d. Variation proves to be one of the keys to the success of the album: the songs usually avoid to adopt linear or traditional song structures, and tend to alternate fast sections, accompanied by furious blast beats and ferocious tremolo-picked riffs, to slower and calmer ones, capable of building up an ominous and absolutely evil atmosphere. In these terms, I feel like mentioning once again \u201cDaemon Spawn\u201d and \u201cInvoke the Oath\u201d over the rest of the platter, while the fantastic \u201cAgenda Ignis\u201d and \u201cBad Blood\u201d fall in more groove-oriented realms, matched by an incredible bass work by Necrobutcher, who is able to provide some absolutely catchy and refined bass lines in the process.\n\nOne final mention goes to legendary frontman Attila Csihar, who provides what is definitely the best studio performance of his career. Attila has always been a one-of-a-kind singer, especially among the black metal scene: his unique style consists in alternating agonizing screams to raspy vocals and almost operatic sections, something that could be assimilated to a sort of ritual chant of death. If his vocal performance probably sounded a bit too raw in the debut, here we have him at his absolute best: his screams sound piercing and demonic, his raspy vocals are perfectly controlled, and the intensity, the fullness and the diaphragmatic technique he puts in his operatic ones are nothing short of amazing. An absolutely polyhedral and unique vocalist, capable of shifting from the most ominous scream (or death growl) to the most astonishing operatic register, without losing even an ounce of his malignity. \n\nAdd now to the aforementioned elements and the fantastic performances of the musicians a perfectly matching production, capable of sounding modern yet at the same time adequately raw and evil, and which complements each and every element of the music: this is Daemon. Mayhem were able to craft the real successor of \u201cDe Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\u201d: \u201dDaemon\u201d is an album that will surely stand the test of time, and which represents one of the strongest additions to the band\u2019s catalogue. Possibly one of the best extreme metal releases of the year, surely one not to miss.\n\nOriginally written for: The Metal Observer.\n",
        "\nBack when this album was about to be released, the eyes of black metal fans were all on Mayhem after the release of De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas; everyone anticipating what the band\u2019s movements would consist of, daydreaming of what they would or could possibly come up with after their debut full-length. If any of those avid black metal enthusiasts expected Mayhem to follow in their own straightforward approach to Norwegian black metal as they presented on DMDS, thereby establishing the blueprint for thousands upon thousands of copycat bands to follow all over the world, they were about to be disappointed. However, those enlightened or understanding enough would surely realize the genius creation that Grand Declaration of War turned out to be, even if it would understandably take time for them to come to terms with its overwhelming amount of distinctive particularities. \n\nGrand Declaration of War is the sophomore Mayhem full-length album released in the year 2000. Coming six years after the release of their previous record, it clearly shows how the passage of time and the events taking place in the meantime affected and consequently altered both the band\u2019s style and sound. GDoW featured renowned Hellhammer on drums, founding member Necrobutcher on bass duties, Euronymous\u2019 replacement Blasphemer on guitars, and, most importantly, Maniac on vocals. This album is the strangest, most experimental Mayhem album to date, and doesn\u2019t run short on magnificent odd qualities across all its features that make it an extremely interesting piece of work which most likely still remains undeciphered and undoubtedly has never been matched by any other band in the black metal realm Mayhem are at the forefront of. \n\nEven attempting to label the genre of this record appears to be an unfruitful task, as it is not a simple or standard black metal album by any means. While it could probably most accurately be described as avant-garde metal and progressive black metal, passages of noise, droney ambiance, spoken word, and electronic bits, to name a few, are present throughout it, making it different to anything released by an otherwise black metal band before and after it. \n\nOne of the main aspects that set GDoW apart is the overall sound of the album. The guitars sound piercingly cold, they\u2019re high pitched and make for a very tense, sterile, artificial soundscape. The riffs have a militaristic or at least punishing approach at times, while being menacing or sounding decidedly stern in some instances. The aggressive irreverent new millennium attitude the band was going for at the time, which is surely one of the most interesting and often forgotten stages of it, is perfectly captured in this record. Not only thanks to the strident, often atonal melodies that plague it, but also to the magnificent, brilliant vocal work and cryptic lyricism by legendary frontman Maniac. \n\nManiac has most likely been the most interesting, thrilling, and strange or mysterious character the band has ever had among their ranks. It is said GDoW is his magnum opus within Mayhem, even though his later work on Chimera was fantastic, since the uncommon style of vocals and weird ways of reciting obscure lyrics that dealt with all sorts of anti-human, nihilistic topics truly shine through on this particular album, and account for both his and its brilliance. One of the best things about this record is the feeling the sermon or speech type delivery Maniac approaches his lyrics at times gives the listener when paired with the icy despotic compositions delivered across its 13 tracks (one of them in particular being complete silence after a couple of introductory lines). \n\nThe drum work on GDoW is perfect, as is always the case with Hellhammer. The drumming is precise to the point of it resembling some surgical performance of sorts, and it accentuates the riffs perfectly, constantly alternating between slower, more solid tempos and faster, more mind-bogglingly high speeds. The drums are what complete the decadent, warfare-like attitude that is present throughout the record, and only make this album more special and proficient. \n\nRegarding the basslines, they\u2019re the essential component to every Mayhem release. Necrobutcher is an apt bass player and his contribution is never over the top and never detracts, but instead always adds and will only be noticed for its positive effect on the ends of the mix, never the contrary. In this particular album, he shines through the most on the slower passages, keeping the tension up and furthering the grim seriousness of it.\n\nThis record is a classic masterpiece of warfare-like, brain-puzzling, enigmatic, intelligent black metal, and serves to prove Mayhem have never been followers, not even when they had it the easiest to simply be lazy, as much hate as this album brought them precisely for being too creative and groundbreaking. Every individual seeking to find out where the limits of the black metal genre lie should pay attention to this grand hateful, spiteful Meisterwerk.\n",
        "\nLike any other set in existence, Cursed in Eternity is oriented around compiling a bunch of rarities. The contents included are six picture discs, one 7\", three DVDs, four posters, and a book. At the risk of repeating myself, I'll go through all of the contents individually and as thoroughly as I can.\n\nLet's start small, the 7\" is the well-known Freezing Moon/Carnage studio demo. It comes in a little sleeve with old artwork drawn by none other than Maniac. It has the best sound out of anything else in this box, but it's still mediocre as far as I'm concerned. The guitars are quiet, and the drums overbearing, but this is the closest you will get to clearly hearing Dead's vocals. Assuming you haven't heard Morbid's December Moon demo, that is..\n\nAll of the picture discs are quite bad, both individually and altogether. The only records worth listening to are Live in Leipzig, Out From The Dark, and the 7\". Just don't bother with the rest of the records, they're not worth your time. Four horribly recorded live shows and two rehearsals, all of which have been out in circulation for a long time already. Three of the four live shows (the exception here being Live in Leipzig) are garbled spats of noise that only moderately resemble music. Out From The Dark is much better sounding, if not lo-fi. Sometimes Dead's vocals or Euronymous' guitar fades out, but nothing seriously impacting.\n\nThe DVDs are a mixed bag, leaning on the poorer side. On first impression, they're all quite neat, but that dispels when you try to watch them. The live shows have such questionable quality, it's all but guaranteed you won't be watching these for entertainment, just historical sake. Sarpsborg in particular is easily forgettable, despite its infamy as being the Black Hearts gig, as the screen is almost always pitch black. So black you can't see anything happening. Jessheim has visuals which immediately makes it better - not by a lot - but at least there are things to look at, right?\n\nThe last DVD, the Henhouse Rehearsals, is the best video on here. It sounds like complete shit when they play, worse than the live shows, but there's no real qualms with the video itself. You'll at least get to see a group of teenagers dicking around, pretending they're scary.\n\nThe most interesting part of this entire box set by far are the posters and 92-page picture book. I'm not kidding, either. Three posters are faithful reproductions of their original gig posters, and one is of Euronymous live. Meanwhile, the picture book is filled to the brim with historical information and rare, high-quality pictures that capture the spirit of the band much better than anything else in this box set. The book is easily the most captivating and interesting part of the entire box set, and is the only reason why this review has 12%.\n\nI question if this box set was trying to be bad or good. You won't be listening to the records or watching the DVDs more than once, and the book is the only saving grace. So, in closing, Cursed in Eternity serves no purpose other than to cash in on two dead guys that left this world 25 years ago. Personally I'm both surprised and disappointed this didn't come with a piece of Dead's skull with how much they've been cashing in on this guy's legacy as of late. But with this box set being out now, that's pretty much all they have left to market. After that Dead will be irrelevant.\n",
        "\nI have waited long enough to review this album, since I wanted to get all the possible facts for establishing its context of creation and release. Everybody focuses on the stories connected to Dead, Varg and Euronymous (including their somewhat unreliable interviews), but I have read less about the musical influences, which modelled to these compositions. Recently, I have listened to a lot of \u201880s black metal and read Necrobutcher\u2019s book, The Death Archives. Mayhem 1984-94, which I recommend to every fan of the band, since the dude is a very talented writer (and a quite humble and honest one as well). Now, I can safely say that I have reached a sufficient level of documentation to create this review.\n\nStarting as early as maybe 1987 and ending in 1992, De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas had suffered from numerous delays due to personnel changes, a lack of a constant rehearsal place, the band\u2019s poor financial situation (they lived on the brink of starvation), Euronymous\u2019 shenanigans, Dead\u2019s tragic death, and ending with Varg\u2019s misbehavior (that\u2019s a heavy understatement!). The people involved in the writing process were Euronymous, Necrobutcher, Dead, and Snorre Ruch, with the recording session comprising Atilla Csihar as the final vocalist, Euronymous on guitars, Varg Vikernes as the bassist, and Hellhammer, on drums.\n\nStylistically, trying to figure out the album\u2019s influences was a nightmare for me, since it sounded damn original for its late \u201880s compositional timeline. The only bands which came to my mind were Necrophagia, Stigma Diabolicum, and maybe Death and bands from the Brazilian scene. One could also point out elements from Bathory and Hellhammer/ Celtic Frost, while not completely overlooking the Teutonic thrash metal influences. Despite the long period of songwriting, it looks like the band had its sonic bibliographic list on an academic scale, with the key element being extreme, dark and atmospheric metal, giving the final sound a consistent abstract edge. In the end, De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas does tend to sound like an atmospheric dark death/thrash album, which I guess that could be a (superficial) definition of traditional Scandinavian black metal.\n\nTopic wise, I find it interesting that it does not represent Euronymous\u2019 view on black metal as he described it in interviews. Then again, what one doesn\u2019t really take in consideration is that the Norwegian scene in the early \u201890s was made of almost grown-up kids (almost), them being somewhat nerdy and fascinated about the occult, gore, and horror landscapes. Dead was the first one who put this vision on paper, not counting Necrobutcher\u2019s somewhat lackluster approach on Mayhem\u2019s 80\u2019s releases. Thus, Freezing Moon was born, and then the lyrics for the other songs followed suit, with contributions from Necrobutcher, Snorre Ruch and Attila Csihar.\n\nI want to return to the instrumental aspect of De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas for one interesting artistic coincidence. As a heavy metal fan, I tend to go back to listen some NWOBHM albums from time to time, because the connection between this album the British musical movement regards the chords used, which can be dissonant and grave. Compare Welcome to Hell with From the Dark Past, for example. Of course, Venom\u2019s take was on the catchy side, whereas Mayhem\u2019s was on the abstract, dark side. The entire album is full of segments of chords and intervals used for the same purpose, making it one of the most ideologically consistent metal release of all times. This however, can be a double-edged sword, making the songs seem to blend into each other, but that is just for the superficial, untrained eye.\n\nThe most controversial musical aspect of the album regards Atilla Csihar\u2019s vocals. I am still impressed of his Tibetan-like chanting, with the ocassional falsettos, but he really needed more exercise, because he sounds atrocious in Life Eternal and the title track. Also, the pop-ish \u201eyeyey\u201ds and \u201eyayay\u201ds are extremely annoying and out of place, so at the first tries, Atilla might ruin the listener\u2019s experience very easily. Even so, he is more original sounding then were Messiah, Dead and Occultus before him, who were pretty much Quorthon worshippers,with their own individual twists.\n\nIn the end, I will recommend this album to every fan of metal music, due to its consistent historical background, musical or not. It is one of the few albums which I can hear from beginning to the end without problems, even though Atilla is off-putting at times. I like the story it has, I like the musical stories the songs seem to create, I like the tight musicianship, I like the overall dark vibe, and I absolutely love the abstract art that is De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas. Kudos for Euronymous, Necrobutcher, Dead, and Snorre Ruch, who contributed to the creation of this masterpiece! I will always have this album in my blackened heart, as it shaped my musical views for the past half of my life!\n",
        "\nThis must have been a goddamn shock to the metal masses when it came out. Mayhem, the band that started the whole Norwegian black metal thing, whose demos are basically the genre's blueprints and whose full-length debut is seen by many as the apotheosis of the style, took six years to put together an album that in some ways can be seen as the antithesis of their original MO. Following in Celtic Frost's footsteps, Mayhem, in the space between two albums, went from shit-wrecking titans of trailblazing metal intensity to outside-the-box innovators of the utmost strangeness. \n\nGrand Declaration of War sets itself up as a massive departure from Mayhem's debut right away. This album is a bold statement, a refusal to bow down to the TRVE KVLTists who either wanted the group to disband or stay firmly on the traditional black metal pathway. The simplicity, repetition, and harsh, filthy coldness of De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas is gone. The album-opening title track for Mayhem's sophomore release is loaded with short, intricate, and jagged riffs that call early technically-minded bands like Atheist and Watchtower to mind. Further separating this album from the black metal most people were probably expecting is the clean production and the song's use of militaristic drumbeats rather than wall-to-wall blasting. The next two songs largely follow suit, with the anti-necro production revealing the precise nature of the riffing and the drums, which tend to follow a driving patterns reminiscent of a battle march, though there are some nice, intimidating fills and blastbeats as well.\n\nManiac's vocals provide a lot of the strangeness that makes this album so difficult to process. Black metal rasping is not the prime mode of vocal expression here. Instead, Maniac delivers a lot of his Nietzchean screeds through menacing whispers, dramatic speeches (which are more effective than you'd think), and in \u2018Crystalized Pain In Deconstruction\u2019, something that's only a hair's breadth away from being Norwegian-accented slam poetry. The second half of \u2018In the Lies Where Upon You Lay\u2019 even features some indulgent spoken word layered over some harsh vocals. There are also a few points where Maniac\u2019s voice is awash in digital effects that make him sound like a malfunctioning robot or like your dentist the moment before the anesthetic puts you to sleep. For the most part, the album switches between long instrumental passages (which often shift abruptly from one idea to another) and moments where the music is largely the same but with Maniac's ranting. \n\nThere are two duds on this album and anyone familiar with the GDoW probably already knows what they are. 'A Bloodsword and a Colder Sun' (which is unnecessarily split into two tracks) is a polarizing song and it's not hard to see why. The whole thing is built on an ambient trip hop beat and is devoid of all riffs. Along the way, there's some creepy whispering but this song doesn't offer much and has no business being a full five minutes long. Meanwhile, 'Completion in Science of Agony (Part I of II), the album's longest track, is made up mostly of slow, dull chord progressions, occasionally accompanied by one of several vocal styles, from a regular black metal rasp, to pitch shifted robotic vocals, to weird choirs. Despite being vastly different from 'A Bloodsword and a Colder Sun,' 'Completion In Science of Agony' is bogged down with the same fundamental flaw: going on too long while not featuring enough content. \n\nDespite a few rough patches, Mayhem\u2019s experiments mostly pay off. GDoW is a bizarre album that will surely be off-putting for some at first but will ultimately prove rewarding. The changes in the drums from militaristic marches to blast beats to complicated fills break up the album while providing plenty of momentum and the guitars churn out a number of enjoyably odd leads and well crafted, technical riffs. The band\u2019s commitment to strangeness was handled intelligently and, when Mayhem sticks to the more intricate side of their experimentalism, the results are fascinating and well worth your time.\n",
        "\nAn even blend of their last album \u00a8Ordo Ad Chao\u00a8 and \u00a8Chimera\u00a8 in that it combines the rawness and conceptuality of one and the more technical style of the other; Mayhem hits us on the head with their new release, the first in 7 years.\n\nFirst and foremost, no two Mayhem albums are alike. They may share some common elements like the 3 last ones, but there are no shared patterns between them. The style varies enormously, and they don't care about it, or whether the punters will dig it and massively buy their records. They can afford that luxury because they are not in it for the money, and a Mayhem fan will buy anything released by the band anyway, without even knowing what is inside. They are that good, plus, they enjoy \u00a8kvlt\u00a8status.\n\nThe lineup is classic Mayhem minus fantastic guitarist Blasphemer, a loss from which they will never fully recover. BUT, they replaced him with two ultra competent axemen; live Gorgoroth's axeman Teloch, and some Ghul guy, and made them write the music TWICE, because they didn't like what they had written the first time around. The result is fairly good, a mixture of the trademark open-chord power riffing -albeit twangier- with some more conventional BM tremolo-picked parts. It works, just do not expect your jaw to drop; this guy is filling the biggest shoes in the history of BM.\n\nThis album deals with the subjects of the cold war and mind control (roughly) but that's only the tip of the iceberg; their singer and lyricist, Attila , implies lots of underlying concepts and lets the listener connect the dots between what's evident and what's not so. But he is mainly obsessed with the concept of freedom of thought.\n\nSonically the first half of the album sounds muffled, making guitars, snares and cymbals lifeless. I equalized it parametrically from 5 kHz up to a great result. The bottom end is not as powerful as on previous albums, but is way clearer, plus, you get to clearly hear the bass guitar, especially on the last tracks of the album. On tracks 6 to 10 the sonic veil is lifted and everything starts sounding flawlessly. Some reviewers say Mayhem overused slower parts and that made the album \u00a8drag\u00a8. Well , not in my opinion. Even when it does feature slower parts that are, in my opinion, essential to the atmosphere, they quickly give way to violent, brutal sections, sometimes in such an abrupt manner they startled me in horror-movie fashion. The last 2 tracks are bass guitar-dominated (surprise-surprise !) \u00a8slow\u00a8 songs (well for Mayhem standards at least) \n\nDepending upon whether you buy the standard cd, the Japanese edition or the vinyl that includes the \u00a8Psywar\u00a8 B-side single, you will find two bonus tracks from the Budapest recording sessions, \u00a8Beyond The Event Horizon \u00a8 and \u00a8Into The Lifeless\u00a8. Most punters will tell you these are not good songs and bear no cohesiveness with those on the album, but I liked them way more than any on the CD; go figure.\n\nIn my humble opinion, this is my least favorite Mayhem album to date, and yet a hell of a good album.\n",
        "\nMayhem takes an esoteric, atmospheric turn without explicitly sacrificing much of the black metal. It's strangely progressive, but this isn't a forward type of progress, rather a complete side-grade.\n\nOrdo Ad Chao is an interesting display of misanthropy that is supplemented with an incredibly unexpected murky, if not fuzzy sound. Not raw, fuzzy. The drums pack a complete wallop at times and will unexpectedly present themselves in the corners of the mix while the guitars hiss and buzz at various speeds to create a very desolate, apathetic environment. Despite this, it can quickly turn into a chaotic spiral of aggression and violence, almost like a nervous breakdown. \n\nThis mix is a novel execution of low fidelity (for lack of better words) without actually creating a poor sound. The sound really harnesses emotion for once. From the sullen, militaristic intro (\"A Wise Birthgiver\") to the suicidal, womb-crawling \"Illuminate Eliminate\", Ordo Ad Chao is intensely psychological. \n\nTo top this all off, Attila's shrieks, shrills, groans and moans go hand in hand with this atmosphere. It's the perfect complement to Ordo Ad Chao's isolationism and misanthropy. Also a complete mirror to the cold and calculated behavior that Maniac brought with him, but it manages to build off of the modern philosophical and reflective edge that is characteristic of Maniac and new-age Mayhem as a whole. And looking at what came of Wolf's Lair Abyss and Grand Declaration of War, this is a step in the right direction.\n\nBut it's not all success. The stand-out problem of Ordo Ad Chao is the repetition. For an album which is so progressive, this is awful. If you get bored listening to this, you'll probably never know when a track has actually ended. In fact, even when you're enjoying it, you might fall victim to it. Every track of Ordo Ad Chao regularly employs the same tactics and techniques which just grows tiring after awhile. \n\nThere's a certain hot-cold feeling that courses through this entire album. It just doesn't know whether to be fast or to be slow. It comes off as misguided, blackened drone, or even background music at times. It certainly incorporates both elements, but never makes up its mind on any particular direction, musically. It just shifts gears too much.\n\nAnd the lyrics, the lyrics vary between apocalypse and misanthropy. Hatred of people, hatred of religion. That's all, really. They're weak and amateurish. They're wholly nonsensical, or dull and blunt. But by far, the worst offender is repetition, yet again.\n\nThe lyrics never deviate from the same topic. The human psyche is poked and prodded continuously, but Attila just riddles like a jester which makes it so difficult to actually break down what he's trying to say, or the points he's trying to make. I was left with questions that were never given answers because these lyrics feel incomplete or unrefined.\n\nBut all in all; it's certainly not what I would call bad. Reflecting on it in 2019, it easily has some of the most spirit in any new-age Mayhem release, and it brims with ingenuity and passion that was seemingly lost on their 2014 album, Esoteric Warfare. So, Ordo Ad Chao lives up to its title. It's a chaotic spiral of sound that is almost like an ancient storybook that speaks of evils and woes.\n",
        "\nOver the years, I forgot about this release, but nostalgia brought me back. Honestly, I don\u2019t like it, because of the shitty quality and musicianship. Mannheim was a very sloppy drummer, Euronymous still needed some guitar lessons, and Necrobutcher should have picked better lyrical topics. Of course, for \u201880s Norway, this band might have been something else, and these guys were just kids, and their musical vision was as immature as themselves. In other words, at the time, Slayer, Death, Bathory (of course!), Tormentor and so on, did it much better.\n\nFor a short release like this, not even reaching the 20 minutes mark, I cannot properly digest the content. As a whole, it isn\u2019t coherent and doesn\u2019t pass the test of the band\u2019s vision. It contains a militaristic intro, composed by Conrad Schnitzer; the outro is just childish garbage, and there is a melancholic interlude on a piano, which wows me concerning the band members many abilities, and frustrates me on the matter of their incompetence at mastering all of them. Scraping these three tracks, you get five main musical pieces, out of which one is a cover track and the other, a rerecording.\n\nVenom\u2019s cover is awful, with its increased tempo and out of place vocals. Yeah, Messiah was worshipping Quorthon, to say the least, a trait also picked up by Dead later on, both in a more atmospheric fashion than a straightforward one, but that song celebrated the occult vision on the midnight period, and there is none of that here. Pure Fucking Armageddon also doesn\u2019t have that alarmed tone, even with its excruciatingly retarded lyrics, with the more atmospheric vocals, very fast tempos and the too-brief-to-be-considered-necessary guitar solo. On a side note, why does nobody asks themselves what would have been DMDS with Messiah on vocals, since he is about as sinister sounding as Dead, albeit more tight? Oh yeah, there are no dramas, antics, and mental diseases involved in his story\u2026\n\nThe main tracks seem like leftovers from the Pure Fucking Armageddon session, although this sounds like a very harsh statement. Chainsaw Gutsfuck has the signs of good songwriting, with many transitions, tempo changes, gaining a progressive edge, while Necrolust builds up to an exploding apex, which is still fucking awesome. Of course, we\u2019ve been spoiled with numerous bootlegged versions of these tracks, with better musicianship, including Hellhammer, Blasphemer, and the reinvented Maniac, who will not shout (thankfully), but vomit shrieks over them. I skipped the Dead period, because the live renditions from 1990 are poor.\n\nIn the end, I will always go for the post-reunion renditions, since I like the better musicianship and the clearer sound. Yeah, it doesn\u2019t sound kvlt or nekro, but if I\u2019m going to review some music, I\u2019d better understand what the fuck is going on in there and I want my metal crushing it. Somehow, the album title is misleading in this department and, since almost everybody is speaking about it, this record is historically relevant, as it was between the Waves and all that, but who enjoys music for that reason? I don\u2019t, and if you want to at least try to understand parts of the history of black metal, hear this, but there are better recordings of these tracks, and there is better \u201880s black metal out there (but not without this much marketing). Just so you know\u2026\n",
        "\nMayhem has a long tradition of releasing live albums or compilations, but this one is somewhat special, because it is the first full-length live output with Atilla on vocals. The problem is that it does not sound like a live album, but like a remastered studio version of De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas. If someone would like to hear them live, but does not have the resources to go to their concerts, then they might sound boring (I will go into details below). The good part is also the sound polishing, since everything is much clearer, especially the vocals, compared to the original.\n\nFirst of all, I like this better than the original because of Atilla. Here, he sounds more coherent and less silly, without the extra pop gimmicks, way out of place. Then, the reverb he has on the mic gives a much necessary boost, to understand the words coming out from his mouth. Lastly, his clean vocals have improved, but his standard deep low voice is becoming an Abbath-esque croak. Of course, he is getting older, even though the guy is probably in the minority of the black metal vocalists receiving vocal couching early in his career.\n\nSecond, the idea of using two guitarists in Mayhem is for the best. They tried the formula with Blackthorn in 1992-1993, with Nordgaren in 1997, and with Sanrabb in 2004-2005, but it\u2019s a shame they weren\u2019t consistent with this formula. The riffs sound fuller, the tracks sound more aggressive and atmospheric, while the darkness is more suffocating than in the original, when the second guitar appeared sparingly. And of course, kudos for the sound crew for the recreation of the original production!\n\nAnother aspect I like about the live release is the increased tempo, with the increased musicianship. Let\u2019s be honest \u2013 Euronymous was not a very good live guitarist, compared with Blasphemer or Teloch. Here, everything is very tight, with Hellhammer pounding the drums with confidence and keeping the original details, before the editing process. Necrobutcher\u2019s bass gets a little in the background, but he is still as competent as he was in 1991, for better or for worse. Teloch\u2019s solo in Life Eternal sounds weaker than in the studio version, but then again, there it\u2019s overdubbed, so I guess I will give him a pass.\n\nThe downside for the album is a big one: if you haven\u2019t seen the video recording or are not interested in it (for some reason, like hearing the whole thing on bandcamp), then you should know that they\u2019ve cut the bits between the songs, and the crowd noise is almost absent. This neuters any chance of experiencing an actual live session, and Atilla isn\u2019t the type to interact during the songs. And even in the video, he whispers or grunts or mumbles some words, when samples are not present. One thing I miss about Maniac was that he had this genuine hatred and intense passion when introducing the songs. Oh, and another minus about the audio version is the absence of\u2026 the visual aspect: everybody\u2019s cloaked, except Hellhammer, for obvious reasons.\n\nIn the end, I recommend this for the visual experience and if you like professional live recordings, as it is their best sounding yet. But, if you want a more intense live album, better check Mediolanum Capta Est, where Atilla also sings on two tracks (track the bootleg for the second one).\n",
        "\nThis review is a form of protest of this release. The first band I heard and found that it was cashing in on bootlegs was Metallica, and I don't understand why a very poorly recorded and mixed bootleg from 1990 should be re-released as an official one, after the 1995 one. Even on YouTube, someone can find the music and the video recording hear it free. Another issue I have with this is cashing in on the deaths of Dead and Euronymous. For fuck's sake, leave the bygones be bygones and just release fresh content, instead of milking the past!\n\nNow, since this a music review, let us see why someone should buy this, besides the emotional blackmail concerning the fascination with the bipolar suicidal Dead and the megalomaniac sadistic Euronymous. Imagine that you never heard the superior Mediolanum Capta Est, De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas live album or the mediocre Live in Leipzig, but you know that this band basically created and shaped the Norwegian Black Metal scene and also contributed much to what was called the Second Wave of Black Metal. Again, leave the Dead and Euronymous tragedies aside. The first thing you will notice is the shitty recording, which makes everything sound blurry, at best. You will not find much aggression, atmosphere, darkness or melancholy at the first few listens. Then, you cannot evaluate properly the band performances, although Euronymous was a shitty lead guitarist back in 1990, not practicing his solos enough. Dead was ok, like a more atmospheric version of Quorthon from Bathory, playing the newer songs quite well, while not being very compatible with the earlier material. He was quite rigid, but when used properly, he would dominate.\n\nI will not comment much on the set list, since it has almost all the band's catalog by 1990, except for a few tracks. If you would want to compare this release with other live ones, this has nothing new to offer. Maybe the introductions of the songs by Dead sound better (check the Freezing Moon intro), but it is excessively little to throw money away. Of course, do so, if you want beer coasters, but better look for Live in Leipzig instead, or just a live release with the other two most important vocalists Mayhem had, if you value music over the drama behind it. In addition, support the band for the content it created, not for the cash grabs based on emotional blackmails and dramas!\n",
        "\nYou might perhaps have heard the story that in 1991, Mayhem's then-singer Dead committed suicide. It made some waves, you may have heard about it. His least favourite person in the world and band leader Euronymous found his corpse, wrists slashed and brains blown out with a shotgun. So, besides more esoteric stories such as cooking a stew from the brains and collecting skull pieces for necklaces, Euronymous decided the most logical course of action to take in that situation would be to take some pictures of the scene. And to not let those pictures go to waste, he'd send it to all his snail mail underground metal friends around the world. He was a sharing guy like that. He also liked to send tapes of various Mayhem live performances to those pen pals of his, because it's 1991, there's no internet but you know guys from the most obscure black or death metal bands ever around the planet, you gotta enjoy the whole thing and share the experience.\n\nSo one of those guys Euronymous knew was Bull Metal, then drummer of Masacre and Agressor, among even more obscure acts. And Bull Metal, no fool himself, looked at his received items, his tape of a Mayhem live recording, his photo of the dead Mayhem singer and after what I assume was some deep and thoughtful reflection, he added two and two together and said, hey, I should put those things together! Put the tape on CD, use the photo as a cover. And thus, the Dawn of the Black Hearts bootleg was born, one so infinitely tasteless and brilliant in equal manner that it remains infamous to this day. Bull Metal of course himself committed suicide a bit over a decade later and was found dead in his apartment, and in a cruel turn of events, no pictures were taken.\n\nFast forward to the year 2017, and I guess the rights to said tape of that live show Mayhem played in Sarpsborg, Norway in 1990 that made that most infamous bootleg ever somehow must have made it into the hands of Peaceville Records. And Peaceville really knew people loved Dawn of the Black Hearts. Because it's like the ultimate infamous bootleg ever. Something I think must have gone really slow on the brain side of things at Peaceville though, because I'm imagining it as a conversation between various label goons on how that bootleg got so famous and there was some back and forth between people trying to figure out the success story and why people went crazy for the record and traded it for insane prices at Discogs and eBay and whatnot, and somehow they arrived at the conclusion that it must be because of the amazing music it contained.\n\nOkay. Peaceville... that's not how it happened. That's not the reason. People love Live in Leipzig because it's a really great live record with Dead on vocals. It has lots of fuck-ups but it has a strong, sharp sound and just gets across the atmosphere of a Mayhem live show with Dead really well. The bootleg of the Sarpsborg show, that's a really, really, seriously bad version of that. The sound is horrendous, there's too much of a mess for much of an atmosphere, and it really just sucks. I don't know why this would even have to be explained, unless you lived under some kind of very well-insulating rock that kept you from the rest of the going-ons of the planet really well, but no one ever was into Dawn of the Black Hearts for the music. That's just not how the record got its infamy, that's just not how it trades for insane sums, that's not what it was ever about. \n\nYeah Mayhem was a cool band, they had cool songs, but people craving their cool music got and get their fix from far superior recordings. With any line-up. The Sarpsborg live recording is just fucking terrible, and everybody knows that. People bought the bootleg because of the front cover and nothing else, and still buy it for ridiculous second-hand prices to this day. Putting out a new version of the same godawful recording with the most boring cover ever, you really think there's any point to that? What's your next trick, a Black Sabbath best of with all their interlude songs like \"Fluff\" or \"Laguna Sunrise\"? There's just no one fucking interested in that, and the same with this pointless castrated Dawn of the Black Hearts reissue missing the one thing that people bought Dawn of the Black Hearts for.\n\nReally, if you want to cash in on a band's legacy then at least put some kind of thought into whether anyone might actually be interested in the cash-in you put out. This Peaceville brainfart isn't good for anything except I guess some \"how to fail at running at business\"-motivational speaker thing.\n",
        "\nYeeaahhhhh...It\u2019s not very good. With an almost entirely different lineup than on their previous album, I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect. Here we have many elements of their old black metal sound mixed in with some new...odd...hard to describe elements. I appreciate bands experimenting and expanding on their sound (especially in black metal), but this album is just a dud.\n\nThe main problem I have with this album is that it\u2019s not very inspiring or emotionally charged at all. The songwriting isn\u2019t that good. There are good riffs here and there on songs such as \u201cCrystalized pain in Deconstruction\u201d and \u201cA Time to Die\u201d, but overall, riffs are kinda average black metal riffs. There are no grabbing or memorable melodies throughout this entire album, so we aren\u2019t left with much else. The drumming is kinda odd and has a marching war drum feel to it oftentimes (I guess it\u2019s appropriate for the themes of the album), but overall isn\u2019t particularly good. As for bass, I can\u2019t recall a single bass part I really enjoyed.\n\nVocally, this album is rather mixed. Harsh vocals are great and evil sounding, but without much good music to back them up, they come off as somewhat uninspired. The cleans are horrendous without exception. The spoken word is unnecessary and a total waste of time. There are some whispered vocals on \u201cA Bloodsword and Colder Sun\u201d which is kinda an oddball track on an oddball album. It has a digital trance percussion thing going on, without much else. Once again, more odd experimentation with no payoff. Luckily, the primary vocal style are the harsh vocals. \n\nThe final surprise on this album is it has a substantially less raw production than on previous releases. I think this was a wise decision for this album, because raw production would have made this seem like an even more jumbled mess than it already is with its incohesive songwriting. \n\nOverall, I applaud the band for attempting creative expansion (in both style and substance), but they just fall way short on this release. If you are into war style marching music (not sure how else to describe it), and black metal bands that try putting an avant-garde twist on what they do, I\u2019d possibly suggest this album to you, but for old school black metal fans, or really anyone who doesn\u2019t meet the above criteria, I\u2019d recommend you save your time and keep away from this album.\n",
        "\nLet's call Mayhem exactly what they are: the most controversial band in black metal, if not metal as a whole. Dead's suicide, with a bootleg album cover and macabre jewelry in its wake. The murder of Euronymous. The international attention on Black Metal Norway in the early 90's that they were swept up in. Touring on reputation alone for years on end, without even having a full length out. They were one of the rockets strapped to the black metal genre that sent it to the next level, if not the biggest of the rockets. With a sophomore release in development for what seemed like forever, and two of the figureheads of the band in the grave, to be replaced by Maniac on vocals, and Blasphemer (of Aura Noir fame) on guitar, there was so much mystique and anticipation surrounding the band's future that it's hard to accurately put into words. And when the millennium turned, and Grand Declaration of War finally saw the light of day, I'm convinced the masses weren't ready for what they got, and still don't fully grasp what they have.\n\nThe elephant in the room here is that Grand Declaration of War is a completely different record that anything Mayhem had released before it. A distinct stylistic departure from its predecessors, it incorporates elements ranging from the traditional black metal they had become know for, to avant-garde rhythms and almost progressive builds, peppered with spoken word, ambient passages, and even the occasional electronic beat. It's bizarre to the absolute brim. But don't take these descriptions as criticisms. On the contrary, they collectively come across as something far more sinister than your calling card black metal record, even when you're one of the grandfathers of the genre. \n\nTo echo everyone who's ever spoken on this record before, Grand Declaration of War is Mayhem's grandiose dissection of Christianity. It's a full blown exhibition of sedition against the faithful, akin to a radical political rally. Maniac's aforementioned spoken word pieces are glorified calls to arms from a black pulpit, condemning the weak and cowardly to the sword. The lyrical content is complete and total war propaganda against the holy, in arguably one of the most aggressive displays you'll come across. And what's more, the actual black metal vocal performance is spot on. Razor sharp, ferocious, and straight to the throat. This is the proverbial blade that carries out the executions commanded by the edicts bellowed before it. The fluctuation between these boisterous speeches and ravenous screams is masterful. He is, in my opinion, the driving force of this record. The word \"declaration\" could not be more accurate in its definition than in its description of this record's message and presentation. \n\nThe songwriting aspect on display here is a plethora of twisted experimentation, as previously mentioned. The album opener, and title track, leads in like a grand march before a departure to battle, with drums beating in a ceremonial, militant fashion. From there, it's all over the board. You will absolutely get your fill of Mayhem's traditional riffwork (\"In The Lies Where Upon You Lay\", \"A Time To Die\"), make no mistake. While Necrobutcher's bass seems to be a key element that is drowned out at large, the rest of the band does its due diligence. Blasphemer lends some punishing guitar work, trading in the cold melodies of his predecessor with often monotonous tones, inspiring dread and desolation behind the messages spewn over it. Hellhammer's drumwork is a highlight, lending a tsunami of substance to all of the record's components, particularly Maniac's vocals. What's interesting here is that there are virtually no songs on this record that don't incorporate multiple approaches to individual structure. You're hard pressed to find a song that is \"straight forward black metal\". The spoken word is everywhere. Robotic intros giving way to riffs and blasts. Ambient pieces giving birth to blitzing howls. And they all, collectively, create this morbid show of anti-theistic magnificence and terror. Even those songs with electronic influences (specifically \"A Bloodsword and a Colder Sun (Part II of II)\", \"To Daimonian (Part I of III)\", and \"Completion in Science and Agony (Part II of II)\") add this gut-swirling feeling of dread to the music, almost as if this is foreshadowing the new evil of the impending digital age. All will be weaponized, and Mayhem is arming themselves with the lot. \n\nIt was once said that black metal was, at its core, a rebellion against what is conceived as normal. It was meant to be a departure from the mundane and repetitive nature of music and theme. It wanted to be different. Its existence was the incarnation of such. Grand Declaration of War is just that: a rebellion. A rebellion against its own. Where a vast majority of bands tried to follow the style of De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas, Mayhem chose to not follow the style of their own release. They rebelled against what they had spearheaded, throwing another wrench in the gears. And that, in its own right, is admirable. And what's more, it worked. \n\nGrand Declaration of War is not an album for everyone, but it really is an underrated and overlooked entity. It's Mayhem at their most daring. Their most avant-garde. Their angriest. Even after the mystique of this record had died down post-release, there's no mystique about its message: complete and total war against Christianity, by any and all means. \n\nMessage delivered.\n",
        "\nI\u2019ll get straight to the point in this review. No history or background is needed since anyone reading this probably knows all about whatever I can say about this album and this band. This album is simply perfect. It\u2019s so unbelievably good that I don\u2019t even need to play it to be able to listen to it in my head simply from the sheer amount of times I\u2019ve listened to it over the years. De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas is the album that 90% of all black metal bands ever imitate, aspire to sound like, copy, and worship in various ways. \n\nEvery single track from the eight that make up the 46 minutes and 1 second of running time of the album is perfect on its own. I honestly can\u2019t conceive a better way to present a black metal project than this release right here; it\u2019s genius. Not only are the tracks put together in an impeccable, consistent, consciously infectious manner to create the best streak of sounds to ever come from the black metal genre, but the playing on it, particularly the guitar section, of course, is absolutely top tier. \n\nThe cold, evil, dark, calculated, satanic, chilling sounds throughout the album are the most accurate depiction of what a standard black metal outing should sound and be like, since the songwriting is incredibly well polished, leaving no riff up to chance, the lyrics are truly grim and constantly evoke the darkest of images, and the calculated, orchestrated playing of every single instrument and manic, deadly vocal delivery have probably never been matched in a similar way by any other black metal band in existence. \n\nThe massive effort and thought that went into the making of this record shows and shines through instantly, as every second of running time is filled with something of interest, and even what would seem conventional nowadays in the genre was back then something groundbreaking and premonitory, this album being the very reason why what you\u2019ll hear in it strictly defines the standard, genuine black metal archetype. \n\nWhile the only band members at the time of the recording were Euronymous (on guitars) and Hellhammer (on drums), many more people took part in the making of this album. Hungarian vocalist Attila Csihar did the vocals, infamous Count Grishnackh handled the bass, and now long dead Dead handled the lyrics (aside from Necrobutcher\u2019s contribution on track 3, \u201cCursed in Eternity\u201d). If you think about it, even though it\u2019s been said to no end, it\u2019s not only pretty insane that the bass player on the record murdered the guitarist, but also the fact that the accomplice, Blackthorn, handled the songwriting, and that the lyrics being performed by Attila had been laid out by a by then literal dead man, so in a way Dead was speaking from the grave through the vocalist, something Attila (seemingly consciously) pulled off brilliantly. As much as his performance on the record has been the cause of controversy, Euronymous thought he was a fitting session member and liked his style, and he was Dead\u2019s favorite black metal vocalist when he listened to Tormentor\u2019s stuff, so it\u2019s up to no debate to me that the vocals are one of the single best parts about De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas, making it sound, not only dark, grim, and meanly evil, but also insane, mad, crazy. \n\nI could go on forever about the drums. The never-ending blast beats that plague pretty much every track on this album are performed excellently and brilliantly, as is the norm with Hellhammer, and no other record aside from subsequent Mayhem releases features such intense, crispy, cold sounding drums that fit the melody, riffs and vocals so fucking well. They really bring the whole album\u2019s contents to life, and as opposed to the countless copycat releases that would follow this record in efforts to imitate and plagiarize it, they are in perfect coordination with the rest of instruments, and never sound overpowering as powerful and vibrant as they sound, always serving as an extra and at no point whatsoever taking from the album. No blast beat shower feels as authentic as the one to be found here, as it\u2019s probably one of the most well performed and most well-known ones, alone for the fact that they simply set a precedent. The drums will stay stuck in your head forever. \n\nAs previously pointed out, the vocals are great. The points where the shrieks reach their peak, the croaky undertones invade the aural space, and the operatic screams ring out in perfect dissonance with the music, artistic mastery is achieved, as much as I enjoy the other vocalists the band has had. Attila deserves all the attention he ever got for his performance on this album, not only because of its importance and significance but because of how well they pack their mean, sinister punch, making the riffs and lyrics seem real.\n\nLast but most important, the guitar playing at the hands of Mayhem\u2019s leader Euronymous and the riffs on this album are what give it that extremely particular, brilliant, masterful aura of a slick, malefic, villainous lord being invoked by this satanic music, never again to be witnessed on any other black metal outing to date in such a remarkable way as here. The overall sound of this album is so well built and so intelligently put together that it leaves no room for any kind of nonsense, the sonic space being completely used to further instigate the listener to get into the space of the occult, the perverted, the rotten, the old, the devilish; this is Euronymous\u2019 magnum opus, and his utmost expression of his Satan worship the world will ever get, unfortunately. The solos that pop up on some of the tracks are all brilliant works of freezing, melancholic melodies that further the feeling of a demonic orchestra being commanded by the band\u2019s mastermind. It\u2019s chilling to see how the effect of all these compositions isn\u2019t lost no matter how much time passes, and regardless of what you put them up against, nowadays or back then, and no matter how many times you listen to them. \n\nThis is the perfect black metal album, not only for the reasons exposed above, but because it\u2019s impossible anything of this quality will be replicated or conceived again, as much as many bands may come close or try their best to create anything of equal worth. De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas is the most special full-length of not just Mayhem\u2019s discography, but also of black metal as a genre in general. \n\nR.I.P. Euronymous.\n",
        "\nA totally useless release from Mayhem to remind us that they still exist. It also reminds us they can't write any creative material for a substantial release.\n\nLive in Montreal sounds similar to the much better De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas Alive. I mean, the production is worse, but it's otherwise identical. Attila's singing still delivers a convincing and eerie atmosphere, which I will applaud him for, but the others fall flat with a damn passion on this.\n\nEveryone is fighting to be heard. Teloch and Ghul sound more like they're playing in Hellhammer's area, while Hellhammer himself consists of uninspiring robotic thuds, tucked away for some reason. As for Necrobutcher, he's forgotten on every live album anyway. No one cares about the bass at this point.\n\nThe songs themselves - Pagan Fears and From The Dark Past - are unexceptional, there's nothing noteworthy on either track. Furthermore, they were carelessly peeled off of one of the many De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas Alive gigs that was recorded back in 2017, reinforcing how useless this release is. Since they already have a live album of De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas, this set was emasculated. Simply transformed into a meager digital single.\n\nReally, there's nothing to be discussed! Live in Montreal is a bastard child of a digital single. It's not worth your time, because there's absolutely nothing interesting in hearing lower quality songs that can be heard in about two or three other formats already. De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas Alive gives you way more bang for your buck: six more songs to boot, and it sounds much better than this.\n",
        "\nLive in Jessheim is another one of Mayhem's bootlegs-turned-official releases - it's the fourth \"Live in\" release - that cashes in, yet again, on the prospect of Dead being the vocalist. At this point, Dead's history with Mayhem is an open secret among the band itself; it seems as if they pay tribute to his minor existence with these awful recordings.\n\nYou're getting what is expected of any old live black metal release. And, since this was originally a bootleg, a myriad of problems plague Live in Jessheim, too. Commonplace in this album is crackling, distortion, and cutting out. Live in Jessheim's darkest past as an illegal release makes listening turn into a game of deciphering. I don't want to decipher! I want to listen to this purported legendary Mayhem lineup, where Euronymous is ripping on his guitar, Hellhammer lays waste with his drum ensemble, and Dead pukes his legendary, martyred vocals. Instead, all I got was this stinkin' lo-fi bootleg to appease me, and to further the circle-jerk around Dead.\n\nLive in Jessheim is a little bit of a black sheep among the \"Live in\" series, though. For starters, Hellhammer's drums are drowned out by everything else. They're so quiet, they effectively cease to exist throughout much of the recording. You can hear bumping, but that's it. And the bass gets it worse, too. The bass isn't present in any capacity. Euronymous gets it good, but it still sounds horrible. It's speedy white noise. But you can still make out some of the riffs, which is better than nothing.\n\nWith all that out of the way, we can talk about Dead. Live in Jessheim gives Dead the best treatment out of any other band member. His singing competes with Euronymous' playing, but the near lack of drums does a damn fine job in actually giving you something that you can understand.\n\nYou're going to need to listen closely, but you can actually hear Dead sing the same exact songs from the past three \"Live in\" albums. Isn't that exciting? In fact, Live in Jessheim shares the same exact set list as Dawn of the Black Hearts/Live in Sarpsborg, and a near identical set list to both Live in Zeitz and Live in Leipzig. If you have listened to any other \"Live in\" release that features Dead as vocalist, you have listened to a debatably better version of Live in Jessheim.\n\nOh, but maybe you're content with hearing Dead introduce The Freezing Moon with the same sentence (\"When it's cold, and when it's dark, the freezing moon will obsess you!\") for the fifth, maybe sixth time? And maybe you enjoy hearing the same songs for the sixth time, too? Live in Jessheim is just for you. This album is masturbatory fodder for the obsessive Mayhem militant - no more, no less.\n",
        "\nOne of the things I like to do is think about is the prospect of time travel. I understand that it probably won't ever happen in real life and will remain relegated to the pages of fiction for all time. Some things just will never be real, let's face it. For the sake of argument, though, let's say it was real. Imagine being able to use a time machine and prevent the murder of John Lennon; the assassination of John F. Kennedy; preventing Adolf Hitler from achieving ultimate power in Germany; averting 9/11; stopping the genocide of the indigenous Native Americans. How about going back to 1984 to warn Euronymous about his own murder a decade later? Would black metal be bigger today if he wasn't murdered? Would Euronymous have Mayhem stay a \"trve kvlt\" band? Would Deathlike Silence Productions gain traction and become the biggest underground label in black metal history? Would Euronymous kill Varg first preemptively or stay on good terms with him?\n\nI really don't like alternative versions of history, but everything about this album and Mayhem's sordid past makes me think those things. De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas is such an overrated album crafted by a man who had some really twisted ideas at the end of the day. It's a good album, don't get me wrong -- a really good album, but I believe this album isn't as forward thinking or as innovative as some tout. Euronymous was a great guitarist who is credited with being involved in three significant pieces of black metal's early history, but the greatness of this particular album is overstated, in my opinion. Let's talk about it.\n\nFirstly, this album is a little too late to the party to be considered groundbreaking to black metal. This thing came out in the middle of 1994. Early, yes, and the official sound of what we recognize as black metal (second-wave black metal) was largely solidified thanks to this album. By that time, though, Burzum, Darkthrone, and Immortal had already beaten these guys to the punch many times over with albums that were superior to this. Det Som Engang Var showcased a real, forward thinking style of black metal and more with the follow-up, Immortal's first two albums are better and much more memorable, and well, does Darkthrone really need an explanation? Mayhem released a demo, one really good EP, a live album, this album, then nothing after that for a while. And, no, the bootleg doesn't count, as controversial as it is. \n\nSecondly, some of the songs on here aren't that great. A good example for me would be \"Funeral Fog.\" The first minute and a half of this song is unbearable. I feel it's unnecessary and adds padding to the song that could've been improved if they would've shortened the intro by a good minute. Honestly, the whole song is paced horribly from beginning to end. It's not a good way to start this \"legendary\" album off. \"Pagan Fears,\" on the other hand, isn't necessarily a bad song. It just goes on a little too long for what's packed inside and it just doesn't have anything that stands out except for Varg's bass. On top of some of the songs being less than spectacular, they're just way too long. Or at least they're performed in such a fashion that makes them feel like they're way longer than they should be. \"Buried By Time and Dust\" is the one and only song that doesn't sit at the five or six minute mark. Lots of these songs are great, but I will be damned if I don't point out that a few of them need to be trimmed by a few minutes. Some parts just drag on way longer than they have any right to be, making them feel like they're twice as long than the time they actually go on for.\n\nGoing back to Burzum, Burzum has plenty of songs that are twice as the songs on De Mysteriis, yet they don't feel nearly as long as these five and six minute long songs. That's because Varg knows what pacing is, he knows what variety is, and how important both of those things are to utilize when writing songs, especially long ones. Same applies with Immortal, Emperor, Bathory, etc. I don't know how Mayhem did it, but they succeeded in making songs feel longer than they really are, and that's crazy to me because they play as such breakneck speed the entire time. I don't think too highly of Darkthone or Exodus because, as great as they are, both bands suffer from the exact same problem to me. Well, one still does, and the other doesn't anymore. Fill in the blanks yourselves there, if you want.\n\nThe rest of the album does slant upwards in terms of quality after that, though, and is pretty awesome. \"Freezing Moon\" and \"Life Eternal\" are staples of the band's live sets with the latter being my favorite Mayhem song ever written. It's just such a good song with a great solid mid-paced tempo, top notch riffs, depressing lyrics from the late Dead, creepy vocals, and amazing drum work. There's one thing I will say about Mayhem and this album, and that no one will ever top Hellhammer's performance, especially on this album. He's right up there with big wigs like Frost and Faust as far as speed and technical ability go. He is ferocious and just has an impeccable sense of timing, rhythm, and control. Listen to the drum break halfway through \"From the Dark Past\" and you'll hear just what I mean. Or listen to the manic energy as he steamrolls over the title track. Or listen to the flawless fills he provides on \"Buried By Time and Dust.\" There's even a jazzy break in \"Life Eternal\" that's fucking gorgeous! A one-trick pony this is not. \n\nAnother good thing about this album is riffs, riffs, and more riffs. This album has riffs a'plenty. Really fast, breakneck tremolo picking and memorable riffs that'll always stick with me. Some of the riffs really remind me of Bathory's albums ala The Return...... or Blood Fire Death, just evil and nasty as hell. Thanks Snore \"Blackthorn\" Rush of Thorns fame for providing some of those awesome riffs you fell in love with the first time you heard this thing. The vocals are a mixed bag, but Attila certainly stands out. Although he wasn't the first to use cleans in black metal, he may have been the first to use uniquely ghostly operatic cleans because the end of the title track is without a doubt the most standout moment on this album with Atilla. I'd argue that if you're not fully accustomed to this kind of music, it will make you feel incredibly frightened. His style makes some of the songs feel significantly more evil than they do with Dead (no disrespect for the dead. Get it? Bad wordplay! MWAHAHA!), like on the title track or \"Buried By Time and Dust,\" where he sounds absolutely fucking nuts. Sometimes, they're just frustrating and obnoxious like on \"Funeral Fog\" where you can barely hear the guy, or on \"Cursed in Eternity\" where for most of the song, he doesn't deviate too heavily from this monotone drone-like croak, which just gets annoying as hell to listen to after a while. Like I said, mixed, but leaning more towards being okay in the end.\n\nI won't comment long on the aesthetics of the production, but I will say that it's produced great. I love the treble in there that's just enough to make it loud enough, but not too loud to the point that it drowns out the low end. I love that Varg's bass is in full display, and I love how it sounds mysterious and otherworldly, like a foggy mist is rolling around you as you're listening to it. I'm not quite in love with how the drums sound, though I don't know why I feel like this, but it's not a big deal to complain about, honestly.\n\nIn my honest opinion, this album is far from perfect. There were better albums released before this, and there were better albums released after this. However, I can't discredit this album for helping to bring black metal into the spotlight. This and albums like Pure Holocaust, In the Nightside Eclipse, Hvis Lyset Tar Oss, and Dark Medieval Times were just what the scene needed to expand and get out of the very dark, grim, and \"kvlt\" corner that Euronymous was trying to keep everybody in. It's a very historic release and Mayhem overall are a very historic band. Now I'd like to return to the question I posed in the beginning and expand upon it. Euronymous never got to see how big his band would become. How would he react to seeing Mayhem on the international stage in front of his own eyes? It's hard to say because he was such a divisive figure with extreme ideas that divided a lot of people and created lots of controversy. We'll never know for certain where he would've taken Mayhem after this if it wasn't yanked from his hands.\n\nI will say this, though. We definitely wouldn't have gotten Grand Declaration of War the way it is now.\n\nI like that album, by the way....\n",
        "\nHistorical band controversy and cryptic track titles aside, this EP is back to back one of the most legendary ones alongside Deathcrush in the genre of black metal for a multitude of reasons regarding the music alone. There's a logical explanation as to why this is pointed out as one of the best releases the band put out after Euronymous' passing and Blasphemer's arrival. \n\nWolf's Lair Abyss is an almost 25 minute long piece of fierce, relentless, unstoppable black metal executed in the most flawless, intricate, professional way possible, leaving no doubt to anyone who knows how to accurately and appropriately value this type of music about the band being more than just alive and well even after the untimely death of their leader and mastermind. As many other bands would've taken the easy way out and would have gone the easy route by simply quitting after releasing something as good as De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas and blame their discontinuity on an event that escaped their power while laying back and enjoying their legendary cult status and fame off of the surrounding controversy and popularity, Mayhem did exactly the opposite by unapologetically (and somewhat unexpectedly as well) releasing this thing. They surely and thoroughly provoked anyone who might have thought they were done for and over with to try and test their worth by unleashing a powerful, angry, mean-spirited, violent black metal attack like it had never been witnessed before by adepts of the genre and challenging their contemporaneous creators with more than enough credit to do just that. \n\nKeeping in mind how time has treated this and considering a release of around this length nowadays could easily be considered as a lazy full-length by modern black metal bands, it's noteworthy how dedicated enough they were to have the decency to not label this as a full album, but just as a small taste-bite of what was to come and what anyone who would follow the ride along had waiting for them (and they certainly didn't disappoint). \n\nThe sound of Wolf's Lair Abyss is extremely sharp, razor-edge, metallic, and heavy, while still sophisticated, measured, smart, and always stable. The guitars, controversially handled by then-newcomer to the band's lineup Blasphemer, are played extremely and almost (to a certain extent) soullessly well, something which might come as a surprise or even slight turnoff for certain type of listeners, yet it honestly does the opposite for me, as it allows the rest of the instruments and the vocals to shine through even more while giving the riffs total protagonism and not leaving any room whatsoever for any kind of sloppy playing or silly amateurish mistakes that would otherwise do nothing but take much useful and needed space in the overall general mix of sound. The bass is of course well played by legendary and founding member of the band Necrobutcher, and one can only wonder what his contribution on their debut album would've sounded like by admiring his work on this following EP. The drums are played restlessly and mindbogglingly fast by Hellhammer, undoubtedly one of the best drummers in metal, and it's crazy to see how well and perfectly he adapts to each and every tempo, be it slow or quite the contrary, without the bat of an eye. His playing is forceful and mighty while still being clean and sober, and there's not a single moment where any otherwise understandable human defects shine through in the slightest, borderline sounding like a programmed drum-machine at times. \n\nThere's not much one can say about Maniac's insane and inhuman vocal delivery throughout this release, since probably any attempt at labeling or describing it would run short, and one must listen to it to truly comprehend how his animal fury displayed on all tracks couldn't have been matched by anyone else taking his spot, effectively making him the ideal individual for this job.\n\nAll in all, as much as some would criticize Wolf's Lair Abyss for it representing the opening of a new chapter in Mayhem both lineup and style wise, I happen to believe this is quite the perfect outing, and I have no complaints about it or wouldn't want it to be different in any way, so this is one of those very few pieces I would label as perfect black metal.\n",
        "\nWidely remembered as the starting point for the establishment of the second wave black metal, Mayhem's debut reshaped the black metal concept that Venom created five years earlier with their sophomore effort. Unlikely to what the first wave offered, Mayhem provided an insanely fast and raw performance, emphasized by the tense atmosphere surrounding each song. Although in terms of songwriting, the band achieved climbing to higher standards of franticness and insanity, Mayhem failed at making a consistent work. \n\nThe attempts at reaching grindcore's bpm scales result pointless and needless. For instance, the title-track already offers a raw and uncontrollably savage mid-paced thrashy intro, but for whatever the reason, they saw including blast beats as a reasonable alternative. On the contrary, blast beats negatively affected the coherence of the songs. Further, the wildness they started offering with their mid-paced intros got buried at some point, and they make the songs a little bit dull. Perhaps, thrashy drums could have been a more effective choice in order to make the songs sound fucking insane. The same thing happens in almost all the release, in certain songs they are lengthier than in others.\n\nOn the other hand, their cover of the Venom's song \"Witching Hour\" works perfectly. It could certainly be their finest hour, as it is not so distant from Venom's idea, even though it is way shorter than the original song. This song is a perfect tribute to the band that widely influenced them: Venom. Anyway, for such purposes, a cover of Celtic Frost's legendary number \"Circle of the Tyrants\" could have been another great choice.\n\nThat said, the performance in this release is somehow good, but the inconsistencies did not help the band. Moreover, Maniac's vocals are not the most ideal for this release. Instead, it was regrettable for the band not joining Dead before, since his vocals were more fittable for an album of this kind. Mayhem's debut EP represents a good beginning for those interested in understanding the most relevant elements in the second wave black metal. Unfortunately, the band was affected by a bloody tragic set of events (e.g., Euronymous being murdered, Dead's suicide, etc.) marked the band thereafter. Therefore, the historical importance of this album should not be ignored.\n",
        "\nMayhem has always been the band that was more talked about than actually listened to. The story behind the whole Norwegian scene is intriguing and makes you think what goes through the artists' minds while writing music. We can all agree this band was in fact the central figure in the circle. The True Mayhem, the one where the guitarist took pictures of the vocalist's corpse and the bassist killed him afterwards, the one which set the standard for the second wave of black metal, is dead. In its place are nothing more than ashes, but a new fire is burning in the same fireplace, one that uses modern fuel to burn, although not as brightly as the one before. \n\nEuronymous was a very talented guitarist, as much as I don't like the guy for his personality (he was an absolute drama queen when it came to \"evil\" stuff) I absolutely aknowledge his musicianship. But the songwriting on Esoteric Warfare has nothing, and I mean NOTHING to do with the way \u00d8ystein sounded. Perhaps the only thing Teloch and Euronymous have in common is the very fast tremolo, but that's all. Teloch deviates a lot from traditional metal composing. His work is very dissonant, almost headache inducing. And while it may not be as dynamic as the stuff Gorguts put out it is genuinely atonal. Instead of relying on downtuning to bass frequencies to achieve an eerie sound the guy focused on very intricate, but not technical, fretting. The nightmare of every BM elitist. But I have to say I am very disappointed with Necrobutcher. The bass doesn't stand out anywhere on this record. Actually, Necrobutcher never did anything notable with his instrument, perhaps only on Deathcrush but even then his contribution was limited to simple, distorted bass passages. But what do you expect from a BM record, eh? On the other hand, Hellhammer is as amazing as he has always been, solidifying his legacy as one of the greatest drummers in the scene, able to keep inhumanly fast blast beats in time and for prolonged periods. And he shows that age never managed to lay a finger on him, his double bass here is primarily 32nd notes, compared to the common 16th notes used in extreme metal, a concert for this guy is equal to a whole marathon. And what is the case with Attila? Well, from the moment I heard his performance on DMDS some two years ago I immediately knew this is far from your average black metal vocalist. His techniques are for the most part uncommon, but there is a good amount of death growls on this record that are worth noting. His squeals resemble those of pigs being butchered alive and that is just part of all the things he does on this album. His traditional throat singing is also present, adding some sense of nostalgia. And all of these elements are mixed professionally and leave not even a memory of the lo-fi kvlt band Mayhem once were.\n\nThe song structures here are also very uncommon. I can even say there are some ambient passages here and there that contrast the very up-tempo ones. So there is some sense of diversity and while the record can in no way be called \"progressive\" it is far more meticulously crafted than other works from the genre. The drums and guitars don't interfere with each-other and the vocals aren't just ''thrown in there\" as with most lo-fi mixes. But one major complaint I have to make is that, while the album clearly has a direction, the songs are way too repetitive for my liking. It's the 21'st century, pretty much anything is done on guitar in metal, you really have to think outside the box to achieve something, and while Teloch did think outside \"the\" box he kept his head in a different one. Ironic but in no way fatal, because at least the guy had the courage to do something different than just mimicking his idols. The same goes for the other members, except for Necro, with whom I expressed my problems. \n\nAnd what advice do I give to the listener? Well, if you're particularly fond of old-school lo-fi BM then there's a very big chance you won't like this. If you're a dissonant maniac, listening to Gorguts and Arnold Schoenberg on a regular basis, you are going to fall in love with this record, but if you're like me, who enjoys basically everything, this will be a worthwhile experience but don't expect anything spectacular. Take your time, you might need 7-8 listens to comprehend it. And as I stated, the True Mayhem is dead, it has long been dead, ever since a particular somebody did something to somebody some day in 1993. What you are experiencing here is a bunch of musicians that present themselves as the brand \"Mayhem\", sell their merch, tell their story, but have absolutely nothing to do with that legacy. And it is better that way, the metal scene needs to go new directions, otherwise it is no different than pop music.\n",
        "\nAn introduction to Mayhem is not really needed for anyone with curiosity and the Internet available to them, so let's just say that the band's early career is much more famous and celebrated than anything that was produced while Blasphemer was the guitarist. Unlike with obvious black metal milestone De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas, this 2007 release is both not an obvious black metal album nor classic in the least, shying away from praise and bold statements as much as possible. It has taken me around five years of owning this album to even contemplate reviewing it, so that should be quite an indicator that it isn't an immediate effort, nor one that draws an instinctive reaction.\n\nHaving just had a quick blast of the Pure Fucking Armageddon demo, I can say that the production on this album is certainly not as poor as there, although this is only a little above general demo quality, using a lot of the sound to push forward distorted bass, the vocals, and the higher parts of the kit, which is fairly weird and unsettling, two words that were definitely on Mayhem's wishlist for 'A Wise Birthgiver', which opens Ordo Ad Chao with hulking ambience (and uncredited keyboards) that speak of nightmares to come. The other songs offer more in the way of proper black metal fare, but some of it sounds like it's been filtered through the minds of weirdos like Striborg or Moloch, going off on odd diversions into rhythmic suspense and twanging guitars. Everything remains very murky, guitars buried down with Hellhammer's kicks and toms, the blastbeats that erupt in 'Wall of Water' and 'Key to the Storms' coming across as though the drummer were trying to scrabble his way out through the bottom of a coffin and into the mud, from which the over-distorted bass booms like a blind mole attempting to surface.\n\nThe songs don't make any more sense than all that, Blasphemer tying the band up in knots as he pushes onwards with convoluted structures, turning back on himself after many of the fast riffs with deliberately awkward sections, those in the likes of 'Deconsecrate' stalling the song before making another attempt to push off, while others slip forward with apparently no effort. This makes for an idiosyncratic album, one which draws the presence of Attila Csihar deeper into the songs and supports his troubling performance in all its bestial mind-fuckery. The lyrics might be something other than what the band was using before Ordo Ad Chao but you won't be able to pay much attention to them, seeing as Csihar rarely pronounces a phrase audibly and he certainly sings nothing in a style that you'll be able to imitate afterwards. The growls and haggard moanings are really quite distinctive, worrying the listener through the slow early parts of 'Illuminate Eliminate', though it is the creature from the abyss that he becomes at the start of 'Deconsecrate' and late on in 'Great Work of Ages' that morphs those songs into jagged shards from a shattered psyche and pulls the listener through the gap of the odd production.\n\nAs such, what Ordo Ad Chao does successfully is to ensure that Mayhem's music remains extreme and without parallel, though that is at the loss of much of their previous imperial power and majesty, which returns at moments during the closing 'Anti' and 'Great Work of Ages', both of which are more traditional than the rest of the music presented here. Even after many listens to the album, you are very unlikely to learn all the twists and turns of its brief 40 minute length, nor would it be advisable to get to know it too intimately, since I feel that doing so would ruin the experience. That edge that some of these songs have - an edge of unpredictability, if we're going to put a name on it - is the all-important factor in making this a marginal success, although it's undeniable that the longer songs 'Psychic Horns' and 'Illuminate Eliminate' don't work all that well for their duration, while 'A Wise Birthgiver' proves a mere atmospheric intro, though one that does its job very well. Those busier songs like 'Wall of Water' and 'Key to the Storms' - with its bizarre ride cymbal fills - are more diverting, even if taking the album as a whole is the only way to go. Whatever the case, this is certainly a unique effort in the Mayhem catalogue and a bold step in a different direction for the band.\n",
        "\nMayhem, the band that lives in infamy, will always be remembered for antics over music. No other band I can think of held so much influence with so little material, for so great a time. Had Dead not committed suicide, perhaps the band might have released more material. One could say; however, the fact one member decided to murder the other held the band back. Yes, Mayhem are well known-even worshipped in the metal circle. \n\nDeathcrush is said to be the \u201crevolutionary\u201d first EP, that helped birth the black metal scene (along with Bathory). For the life of me, I cannot figure out why fans hold this album in such high esteem. From start to finish, this album is a shit show of half-baked ideas and technical inadequacy. Unlike some bands who have technicality, but lack song writing Mayhem displays neither on this album. Venom were horrible musicians, but wrote some pretty good songs-as did Hellhammer. Mayhem can make no such claim.\n\nConsidering the band had a limited budget, the production can be forgiven. In fact, it\u2019s not terrible considering the financial limitations. One cannot help but appreciate the band\u2019s enthusiasm on Deathcrush either, but unfortunately, this does little to help the music. Perhaps Mayhem should have waited a little longer to release any of their work until they had tightened up their musicianship and found a decent vocalist. \n\nThis brings us to the first problem: Maniac. There have been scores of awful metal vocalists over the years, but Maniac ranks among the worst. His tortured screams distract from all other, albeit limited, aspects of the music. Case in point: the title track. The song begins with a pretty solid riff, both slightly catchy and skull crushing; however, the suck factor rears it\u2019s ugly head the moment the vocals begin. The second vocalist Messiah is not great, but at least he doesn\u2019t completely destroy the songs. Lyrically speaking, this album is complete garbage. Thankfully, you cannot understand most of what is coming out of Maniac\u2019s mouth. \n\nEuronymous seems to be on the verge of developing talent. Listening to Mayhem\u2019s later work, it becomes apparent that while not super technical, Euronymous had a certain charm to his style. On Deathcrush, the genesis of such a style can be seen. The riff work is actually decent and fairly unique, if not overly simplistic. Nothing can really be said about the drumming, save for the fact that, mercifully, blast beats had not become the norm at the point the album was recorded. \n\nPure Fucking Armageddon and (weird) Manheim are the two highlights on the EP. Both songs appeal to the ear for different reasons. Neither can be considered fantastic, but they help keep the album slightly above horrid. Along with the occasional, decent riff, the EP is not a complete waste of time. If a person pays more than a couple bucks for Deathcrush; however, it is a waste of money.\n",
        "\nSo the most bootlegged album in the history of metal finally gets an official release. I am not going to make this review about the cover. Suffice to say I prefer the image of Necrobutcher on the front to the image of a deceased black metal legend. It does miss the additional tracks that were present of most of the bootleg versions. In the context of this release it just shows the live tracks the respect they undoubtedly deserve.\n\nThe tracks on offer here are more or less the standard set list for Mayhem at this time. As bootlegs go the audio is sufficiently good that I can enjoy the record without any persistent irritation. I consider this one of the best versions of these live tracks available. The band sound viscous and at the top of their game. A perfectly captured moment in time. Having collected all four of the recent live reissues I can safely say this rates very highly among them. All are taken from the best audio source available and ramped up to sound as best they can. \n\nAlthough I have spent most of this week listening to Mayhem bootlegs this one is truly special. A new perspective on tracks that I have heard many times. Necrolust in particular sounds filthier than usual. The quality throughout is such that one can get lost in Euronymous's exquisite guitar work. Necrobutcher and Hellhammer both play the performance of their lives and of course Dead's other-worldly vocals round that true Mayhem sound off perfectly. \n\nThis LP captures Mayhem as they wanted to sound at the time. This release can hold its own with any other Mayhem recording from this era. An absolute must for any black metal fan with even the slightest interest in the beginning of the second wave of black metal. A triumphant display of black metal from the true masters.\n",
        "\nTo be clear I am reviewing a bootleg. The sound on the record is dull throughout. The record has a layer of fuzz and an almost perpetual ringing noise throughout (possibly cymbals). Still, I didn't get the LP for the fantastic production job.\n\nDead's vocals are plainly audible which is not always the case on Mayhem recordings from this era. Hellhammer's drumming does not overpower proceedings either which is also not in keeping with other recordings of this era. This leaves some room to hear the guitar and bass better. For anyone obsessed by classic era Mayhem this is a worthy addition to any collection, for those who aren't Live In Leipzig would be a better place to start.\n\nThe band sound sloppy for the first few songs. Not necessarily a bad thing for a black metal band except Deathcrush and Funeral Fog suffer greatly in parts. According to the booklet this was their first show with Dead at the front. This may give a reason for the less than perfect start. They begin to recover with Freezing Moon and the subsequent tracks sound suitably intense and no more chaotic than when they were written. Carnage and Chainsaw Gutsfuck sound much as they were intended. \n\nThis concert's place in history is undisputed. It is to black metal what Woodstock was to hippies. To have been in attendance was surely a moment to treasure for those who were lucky enough to have been there. Its place on my turntable however is a little more contested. Although I love this era of the band there are already significantly better quality releases to catalogue those early years when they brought black metal kicking and screaming into existence. For completions sake the LP is worth it, and is entertaining, but I can see why it was not made in larger runs like the recent Live In Leipzig or Live in Zeitz reissues.\n",
        "\nThis album is praised with a reason. Every second of this perfection confirms its status of being one of the most influential and essential black metal albums ever. There is not a single thing that is bad about this album, whether we're discussing atmosphere, vocals, riffs or song structure.\n\nFirst of all, the atmosphere. Dark. Evil. Blasphemous. For me it was like being in another dimension where nothing but this brilliant masterpiece exists. Unlike many black metal albums (which are unfortunately becoming generic and just rip-offs of one another), De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas keeps the listener focused from the beginning to the end. It's astonishingly hypnotic because you can clearly hear hatred and evilness intertwined with the music. The lyrics, whose mysterious notes and darkness depict Dead's soul, are also an important component of the general impression.\n\nMost people complain about Attila's vocal style, and I really don't see a reason for that. His vocals fit this album perfectly, mostly because of the parts with operatic singing (such as in the songs Life Eternal and De Mysteriiis Dom Sathanas) that are irreplaceable with ordinary black metal shrieks. \n\nFurthermore, we should all hail Euronymous for the riffs he made. Not only do they sound inspired, diabolical and create a nocturnal, lurid ambience, they also smoothly connect with each other, giving a continual flow to the particular song and, ultimately, to the whole album. The style and structure of the songs doesn't diverge through album (with the exception of solos in Freezing Moon and Life Eternal); it mostly relies on riffs, but their variety doesn't let the album sound monotonous any second of it. Although production is not the highest quality, guitars and drums can be clearly heard so the sound is pretty much comprehensible.\n\nDe Mysteriis Dom Sathanas is a great example of Norwegian black metal and it is definitely an album every metalhead should check out. Although Mayhem has changed their style in later albums (which are great as well), there is no dispute over the strong impact of their debut album, which has, as one of the most important pieces in the history of black metal, undeniably contributed to the evolution of a genre.\n",
        "\nThis is included as a bonus disk in the Anniversary Edition of Live in Leipzig, and that's how I heard it as opposed to buying the vinyl or individual CD.\n\nIt's junk.\n\nYou know these songs by heart already. There's already been plenty of official releases featuring this lineup playing these songs - Leipzig, Dawn of the Black Hearts, Studio Tracks and Out From the Dark. Do you need a fifth album of Dead singing the same songs?\n\nThe quality is garbage and it's no wonder they sat on this for 26 years, because it should never have been released. For the first two and half tracks everything is muted. At the very beginning when Dead says his famous \"Only death is real\" you can clearly tell the tape recorder is in the next room and everything's muted by the walls. Halfway through track 3 (Funeral Fog) it bursts open - perhaps the cassette was physically carried - and now it's loud. But you can't even distinguish it.\n\nHonestly, I know every word to these songs just like you do if you're reading this, but I can't hear Dead 50% of the time. And I can't hear the guitar either. All there is is a big distorted jumble of what I guess is the drums and bass, but I can't make out any semblance of rhythm. This is more Merzbow than Mayhem, just static-y fuzzy NOISE. \n\nYou sit there listening, trying to pick out one of the famous riffs you know so well but all you're getting is a bunch of bullshit distortion and random hammering like a warzone.\n\nYet, I don't blame the band one bit. I blame the fans, who have spent 25 years bitching about everything they've done and masturbating to two dead guys who aren't getting any less dead. They only released this because they knew people would buy it - and I'm sure the \"everything after DMDS is The False Mayhem\" crowd will go wild for this, but that doesn't mean it's good. There's no use for this wall of white noise.\n",
        "\nMayhem is one of those bands that, to the ones in the know, really requires no introduction. One of the founders of Norwegian black metal, it and its sound were pivotal in the transition between early first-wave black metal and the second wave that came to dominate early 90s underground metal in Scandinavia and elsewhere. In this grand scheme, the Deathcrush EP played by no means a small part. Released in 1987, it\u2019s one of the earliest black metal releases by a band not named Bathory, Hellhammer, Celtic Frost, or Venom, and because of this, its impact cannot be understated.\n\nThe music contained here is raw. And I mean raw. The production is minimal, the recording is lo-fi, the guitar tone is basically non-existent, the drums are warlike and frenzied, the vocals are howled to the maximum, the lyrics are basic and gore-obsessed. This is extreme extreme metal. This isn\u2019t a release for the uninitiated. It\u2019s gruesome, it\u2019s visceral, it\u2019s brutal, it\u2019s downright evil. Where earlier bands flirted with a Satanic image and gruesome lyrics for their edgy appeal and played music that was basically thrash metal turned to 11, Mayhem look and sound like they sincerely feel the things they\u2019re screaming about. And that sincerity might actually hurt them a bit.\n\nThe lyrics, as I\u2019ve said, are gory. Really gory. But they\u2019re also really basic. This combination makes them come off, on paper, as really cartoonish and rather silly. I mean, yeah, they\u2019re gruesome and to someone who isn\u2019t used to this type of lyrical imagery, they could be rather disturbing. But, when that initial shock wears off, you start to see that the lyrics are kind of corny. The music is intensity defined, there is no question about that. And in its early days, extreme metal was all about intensity, but there\u2019s no denying that the lyrical aspect of this era of death and black metal was pretty amateurish compared to what would later be done in the 90s and beyond.\n\nAnd let\u2019s talk about the beyond. Black metal, as it\u2019s come to be known, doesn\u2019t really sound like this anymore. Thanks to the famously rampant branching off of metal subgenres, black metal is quite a diverse genre with a sound palette that goes beyond \u201ctremolo pick at 300 bmp with a blast beat behind you while you screech about Satan or winter for three or four minutes\u201d. And this diversity is something that I think is pretty well explored, if only on a rudimentary level, on this EP with the instrumentals. The opener Silvester Anfang sets up the album with almost two minutes of what is essentially a drum solo, with warlike tribal drums droning. At this point in the EP, if you knew nothing about it or the band, then it might be forgiveable for you to not know what it is you were about to listen to before the title track started. In that way, it kind of disarms you to the barrage that is the rest of the EP. Also of note is (Weird) Manheim, which works similarly, coming before the insane Pure Fucking Armageddon, with its keyboard playing giving a sort of spooky atmosphere before the assault. Also within the regular songs, there is a sense of dynamics, even if it\u2019s only with the tempo. Deathcrush and Pure Fucking Armageddon manage to maintain intensity and drive even when slowing down, and Necrolust has a brief section in the middle where the song actually speeds up and becomes more intense and energetic. And that\u2019s ultimately where the strengths of the release lie: energy and intensity, with a touch of variety.\n",
        "\nWhen I first listened to the debut EP \"Deathcrush\" by Mayhem, I wasn't overly impressed, nor did I get the hype. That being said, given time and repeated listens, the album will really start to grow on the listener. This is a blistering album and one that is hard to categorize. The album has elements of the first wave of black metal, death metal, and even thrash metal. One of the better ways I can think to describe this EP would be early Venom with the intensity turned up to max. \n\nOne of the criticisms of this album that a person will see over and over is that the production is rough and it is indeed rough. However, in this case, the rough lo-fi production works to Mayhem's favor and greatly adds intensity to the songs that might be missing with a more polished sound. If I had one critique of Mayhem's superb \"De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas,\" it would be that the album is just a bit too polished and clean. I'm not saying that album needs Deathcrush production, but Mayhem's raw \"Live in Leipzig\" shows what some of those songs sound like with a much less polished finish. \n\nBack to Deathcrush, this album starts off with the strange and haunting \"Silvester Anfang\" and then launches into the catchy and intense \"Deathcrush\" title track. There is absolutely no let up as \"Chainsaw Gutsfuck\" pounds the listener and leaves them convinced of Mayhem's unrelenting brand of extreme metal. These two tracks (w/ Pure Armageddon) really stand out from other extreme metal from the time and showcase the hunger Mayhem had to be the most intense band around. Unfortunately, the Venom cover (if it can be called that) \"Witching Hour\" is intense, but in a sloppy way. This track, in my opinion, is the weakest one on the EP. That being said, the following track \"Necrolust\" features catchy/brutal guitar riffing that gets the EP back on track and is probably my favorite track on the EP. To close out the EP, we have the haunting instrumental \"(Weird) Manheim\" combined (on the vinyl version I have) with the unrelenting \"Pure Fucking Armageddon.\" With Pure Fucking Armageddon it is like Mayhem wanting to make the most brutal and intense track of the time and it is certainly hard to argue against this track achieving that goal!\n\nIn conclusion, this is one of the most intense extreme metal releases of the 80s and of Mayhem's career. The lo-fi adds to that intensity and fits perfectly with the vocal performances of Messiah and Maniac. What is amazing is just how well this album still holds up and how brutal it still is. When it comes to Mayhem's career, this album is every bit as essential as DMDS and Live in Leipzig. If you are a fan of the 80s extreme metal scene and the lo-fi production other releases from this era, this EP is absolutely essential.\n",
        "\nThe suicide of Dead had several consequences. First of all, it was a tragic for his relatives. Additionally, it was a good opportunity for Euronymous to demonstrate his mental derangement. To make pictures of the corpse and to ship the particles of the brain all around the world is, sorry for being so burgeois, definitely sick. Finally, and now I come to the crucial point, the suicidal action of Dead opened the door for Attila to join Mayhem. And it was exactly the vocalist from the origin of Countess Bathory, who made \"De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\" so unbelievably perfect. His ingenious style combined all characteristics that \"normal\" singers try to avoid. \n\nAttila sounds sick, dangerous and tortured. Equipped with an enormous charisma, he manages every challenge and creates fascinating vocal lines in abundance. But that's not all. Attila also adds a solemn note in view of several parts where he delivers the strangest melodies that were ever spawned by a black metal vocalist. These are the moments when he reaches the maximum of infamy, perfidy and viciousness. To sound \"only\" evil is one thing, but to mix religious servility and pure blackness in an operetta-esque manner is something different. It is not hyperbolic to say that the vocal performance provided \"De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\" with a unique selling point.\n\nAmong other things, Attila's contribution shapes the grim title track. Of course, there are different forms of black metal and one cannot compare this monument with, for example, the mesmerizing \"Det som engang var\" (the song) or the symphonic sounds of the late Dimmu Borgir (and here is not the place for the debate whether this is black metal at all). The title track can also not be compared with Darkthrone's crude sounds on \"A Blaze in the Northern Sky\" and their following albums, because at that time, Fenriz was focused on creating a repulsive sound in order to shock the audience with this self-made ugliness. By contrast, Mayhem wanted the best possible mix for their artistically valuable output. In other words, Darkthrone intended to be the fist in the face of the mainstream, while Mayhem made a serious offer to everybody who wanted to dive into their cosmos of absolutely negative spirituality. However, what I want to say is that we have to be aware of the many faces of the genre. Nevertheless, in terms of extreme, furious, fierce, sophisticated and reckless black metal, the title track is the \"Angel of Death\" of this sub genre. A horrible atmosphere is combined with murderous guitar lines and the pretty unconventional song pattern invites the listener on a trip to the flaming pits of hell and back. Some Latin words, may they be grammatically correct or not, also strengthen the spooky scenario and the entire piece develops an unstoppable power. This song contributes the excellent and unique culmination of a masterpiece that has become essential for everybody who wants his voice to be heard in a discussion about black metal.\n\nYet the first piece of the album does not stand in the shadow of the title track. An explosion introduces \"Funeral Fog\" and its high speed part at the beginning seems to be the unofficial intro of the album. Icy leads sweep across the dreary landscapes until a sudden break kicks off the main part of the song. The Hungarian devil starts his demonic articulation and despite the relentless, anti-ambient approach of the opener, the song does not lack of mysticism. In particular Attila's conjuring \"Fuuuneeeraaal Fog!\" adds an extra dose of occultism. The profound mix features the malignant guitars in an excellent manner and without any kind of chaotic elements, an extremely dense sound pattern supports the gloomy atmosphere of the compositions. \"Life Eternal\", for example, holds inter alia an almost soft, melodic and slow-moving part, but in spite of this fairly introvert section, the feeling of discomfort remains omnipresent. Nevertheless, the full-length is characterized by its unleashed high speed assaults. This means, on the other hand, that ceremonial or restrained sections remain exceptional, although they unveil the band's talent for composing dark, sometimes mouldy melodies. However, one thing is certain. All these different parts blend seamlessly into each other and the songs develop their attraction continuously. Even those parts which are almost killed by Hellhammer's blast beats depict the dark essence of the sub genre, just lend an ear to \"Buried by Time and Dust\" in this context. It is almost too much of a good thing that the monolithic work also finds the right balance between homogeneity and variation. Mayhem avoid external influences without being caught in a self-made prison. Of course, the media hype, which was triggered by \"satanic\" crimes, was good publicity for each and every album of the scene, but this is not to say that the here reviewed work needed the mass hysteria. Due to its musical excellence, it stands on its own feet.\n\nLast but not least, \"De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\" does not only celebrate a black mass. Let me quote a title of the Belgian black metal flagship Enthroned, Mayhem's album sounds \"blacker than black\". With regard to the numerous line-up changes, it is only logical that the band never reached this outstanding form again. Compared with \"De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\", the majority of the further releases of Mayhem sound like a wet fart. On the one hand, this is regrettable, on the other hand, this fact underlines the singularity of the here reviewed giant. It is not the rawest genre release of all times, but it tramples every other album into the grave in view of its immaculate illustration of devastating blackness. Finally, it lives up to its name while revealing one of the best hidden secrets of Satan. We now know his most favourite album.\n",
        "\nAlong with the \"Deathcrush\" EP, \"Live in Leipzig\", and the \"De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\" album, this is one of Mayhem's essential releases. This is their \"Out from the Dark\" demo. What this is would be the band's final rehearsal with their deceased vocalist Per \"Dead\" Ohlin. It was recorded in 1989 but not released until 1996. This is not really one of Mayhem's most talked about releases but due to its historical value and quality, it really should be. \n\nThis compilation contains rehearsal tracks of songs that were already released in studio format, in the form of \"Deathcrush\", \"Chainsaw Gutsfuck\", \"Necrolust\", and \"Pure Fucking Armageddon\", as well as songs that would be re-recorded for their full-length debut, identifying as \"Buried by Time and Dust\", \"Funeral Fog\", and \"Freezing Moon\". These songs are were all done at the same time and all feature the legendary Dead on vocals. It really is a shame that he had to kill himself because as many would agree, he really was Mayhem's finest vocalist. He had this easily recognizable and classic black metal vocal style that would remain unmatched by either Maniac or Attila, although Attila is certainly a good vocalist and Maniac is, well...okay on certain releases. \n\nThe songs are really not that different musically on here than they were before, or would become on future releases for those qualifying tracks. The production is raw, which is to be expected from a black metal demo rehearsal. The vocals are a bit high in the mix, perhaps higher than they should be, but this causes them to be the highlight of the experience. Not only a highlight but they serve as a testament to Dead's legacy. He literally sounds possessed here. \n\nThe guitar tone is dirty and raw but at this point, Euronymous was a far more competent guitarist. They do not sound raw in the sense of being unlistenable but raw enough to not sound processed or fake. \"Freezing Moon\" perhaps sounded its most true on this recording and the melodies of \"Funeral Fog\" are as emotional as ever. \"Pure Fucking Armageddon\" sounds SO much better than either the EP or demo versions managed to. I really would have liked the band to include a rehearsal of \"Ghoul\" in the tracklisting because after that trash demo tape from 1986, we never saw that song again. It really would have benefitted from an inclusion on this demo.\n\nI can say that while this is not the best offering from Mayhem, it was likely the best they did with Dead. It's a really neat little addition to the band's dense discography and without it, aside from \"Live In Leipzig\" and perhaps \"Dawn of the Black Hearts\", along with some tracks here and there, we would not have had a true testament to Dead's legacy as a frontman. And a deranged frontman, at that.\n",
        "\nWhen it comes to Mayhem, I consider their essential releases to be the \"Deathcrush\" EP, \"Live in Leipzig, \"De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\", and the \"Out from the Dark\" demo. These four recordings show the band's raw early sound, one of their most controversial shows with Dead, their first full-length, and the final studio recordings with Dead, respectively. \"Pure Fucking Armageddon\" was the band's first demo from 1986. Here, we see some songs that would eventually be redone in a live setting or demoed studio tracks. Unfortunately, this demo does NOT do Mayhem any justice whatsoever in establishing them as one of the driving forces behind the Norwegian black metal movement. This sucks, bad.\n\nI am well aware that production in black metal at the time (well, mainly in the early 1990s) was essentially supposed to be raw and lo-fi. Even bands such as Hellhammer and Bathory that were already releasing black metal records around this time had far better production in terms of the music actually being listenable. It's raw but sounds good for the actual music. Such is not the case here. The guitars sound completely messy and seem to lack rhythm or any type of musical coherence because of this. I know Euronymous was a great guitarist, regardless of him being a decent human being or not. I feel that even he was cheated on this demo due to the production. The two songs from this demo that were not reworked in some fashion are \"Ghoul\" and \"Voice of a Tortured Skull\", the latter being a somewhat interesting instrumental intro that still manages to sound like complete butt. It could have sounded far better than it does here. Speaking on behalf of \"Ghoul\", I know this song is actually very good. Carpathian Forest did a cover of this song for their \"Morbid Fascination of Death\" album and managed to make it sound absolutely amazing. It's very sad when another band can make your song sound better than you. \n\nWhile I have listened to this entire demo, it was not something I could do in one setting. It is so horrendous, I had to split up my listening into intervals and go from there. There are apparently vocals here that are (rumored to be) handled by both Euronymous and Necrobutcher, Euronymous alone, OR Necrobutcher alone. Sources tend to vary on this topic. Either way, the vocals here, which are 100% distorted and buried, are horrible as well. They are completely incoherent and detract greatly from anything else that is going on here. There are no redeeming qualities in terms of vocals, or as we've noticed, any of the other instruments. \n\nSuch was the case with the classic \"Deathcrush\" EP, Manheim handled drum duties here. Hellhammer was not yet in the picture. I would say Manheim is a fairly competent drummer, at least on that EP. Here, his timing seems to be very off and the drums are played very sloppily. It's kind of hard to really tell most times, though, because the music lacks coherence most of the time as it is. The bass seems to be a bit prominent here which usually, I'd enjoy quite a bit. Necrobutcher is a very competent bassist and he's made himself known throughout Mayhem's career. Unfortunately, while you can hear the bass a bit and it takes over occasionally, it is very distorted and messy. Much like every other instrument here. \n\nReally, after listening to this demo, and hardly being able to even do so, I can say there really is no value whatsoever here. Sure, it may be the first overall release (\"Deathcrush\" being the first proper) by any band in the Norwegian black metal scene, but it is not essential whatsoever and fails to bring any musical value to the table. I thought maybe when the instrumental rehearsal version of \"Ghoul\" came on during the demo's latter half, thing would look up. Unfortunately, these instrumental rehearsals are still far too messy and incoherent. They remain to be the better side of the demo but still suck ass and hold little to no listening value. Seriously, just avoid this. I am aware it was Mayhem's first release and maybe holds historical value of some sort, but that doesn't matter to me if the music sucks.\n",
        "\nSo here we have another unearthed treasure from the classic Mayhem line up of Dead, Euronymous, Necrobutcher, and Hellhammer. Naturally, when this LP came out for pre-order, those sly devils at Peaceville had our money and here we are. Most die hard Mayhem/black metal fans know this was one of only 5 shows Mayhem managed to play live during this tour. We have Jessheim, Sarpsborg, Zeitz, Leipzig, and Izmir. All these shows were taped and (with the exception of Izmir, Turkey,) have surfaced historically in one form or another. \n\nFor a disclaimer, after hearing this release finally on LP, I am going to constantly compare and contrast it to Live in Leipzig. Now for the music itself, we have the normal Mayhem setlist sans \"Pure Fucking Armageddon\" but Zeitz holds the slightly more rare track \"Pagan Fears\" which turns up on Live in Leipzig. At this particular gig, you can actually hear a good amount of reverb from the room on Dead's voice, especially during the Freezing Moon and Buried by Time and Dust intros he did. The sound on this recording is above average but there are times when the band is going full force during songs, such as Funeral Fog or Pagan Fears, poor Dead gets drowned out in the mix. There is also considerably less crunch on Euronymous' guitar this time around compared to Leipzig. During some songs, you'll hear Necrobutcher's punchy fuzz bass and second guess whether or not Euronymous is playing because the mix is more ambient than probably how the Leipzig show was mic'd/mixed. There's not much else to say here about the performance, as any self respecting fan will know what to expect. It's necro as all Hell itself. \n\nNotwithstanding my opinions on the sound, this is still a mandatory listen. You get all four of the De Mysteriis Live tracks the band had constructed at this time plus the Deathcrush/Carnage crushers. You really can't go wrong. You'll hear the between-song banter from the crowd, Dead and Necro's intros, and the historical document that was the Zeitz concert. I will easily grade this above the Jessheim and Sarpsborg shows for the setlist and sound. I will say the atmosphere is quite eerie when this one plays. \n\nThe booklet Live in Zeitz provides is perhaps the main reason besides the music itself to get this release. In addition to the old photos at the Mayhem house, pictures from the Zeitz concert, and pictures of younger Pelle, you also get 7 interviews ranging from small to large from Metalion, Hellhammer, Necrobutcher, Samoth, Faust, Anders Ohlin (Pelle's brother), and Arcan Ogutverici (the man behind booking Mayhem for the Izmir show in Turkey). The foreward on how they tracked this guy down is as hilarious as it is educational. As you read, you'll find by luck they tracked him down on in the cache of a closed down Voivod forum. If that isn't necro-obscure I don't know what is. It also explains what happened at the Izmir show and why no soundboard tape has been found as of present day. The interview with Anders Ohlin also provides incredible insight on his legendary older brother and their early brushes with heavy/black metal.\n\nBottom line, Live in Zeitz holds its own as a lasting monument to the True Mayhem legacy. However, I have to stress if you're looking for the best sound quality of the recorded outputs with Dead, Live in Leipzig is without question the best live release. However, those who have been relying on the Dawn of the Black Hearts (Sarpsborg) and Jessheim bootlegs, this wipes the floor with 'em. With all the mysticism and terribly short outputs this lineup had back in the day, I give this one the stamp of approval. It is unfortunate this is not \"Leipzig quality/clarity\" but the strengths outweigh the weaknesses with Live in Zeitz. \n\nIf I could recommend the best releases with Dead/Euro/Hellhammer/Necrobutcher lineup, Live in Zeitz takes 3rd place in the line of [Projections of Stained Mind Studio Tracks], [Live in Leipzig], [Live in Zeitz], [Out From the Dark Rehearsal].\n",
        "\nI only give this 95% because it is a hard album to get into, and I can see why it has divided Mayhem fans so much. Even by Mayhem's standards this is an obscure and cryptic release. Bear with it, though, as it is very rewarding in the end. \n\nFirstly I must praise the overall structure of this. After the really solid but more \"straight black metal\" Chimera release they seemed to consciously return to more cryptic and experimental territory like they did on Grand Declaration of War, only this time the music is solely composed by Blasphemer. This album just flows really well, I think this is largely down to the perfect production, a sound so magical, distinct and perfect for the album on the same level as De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas and Emperor's In the Nightside Eclipse. This album just sounds pitch black, it's like being dragged into a black hole, and it has a muddier almost death-metal production sound a little reminiscent of Immolation almost (from Close to a World Below onward at least). Handling the bass as well, Blasphemer brilliantly utilised this in the mix, driving forward the exhilarating Wall of Water and punctuating the more dynamic and sparse tracks like Illuminati Eliminate and Psychic Horns. My only possible issue in terms of sound might be Hellhammer's drums, he performs well as always but I am just not sure about the production, apparently they weren't equalised, at times they sound almost distorted, but they still do the job. \n\nThis may be to many the best Mayhem lineup ever, with both Blasphemer and Attila united for the only release they did together sadly, and Attila brought with him along with his idiosyncratic and otherworldly vocals a focus on Illuminati and Masonic themes, which fits Mayhem perfectly. The lyrics are as obscure as the music, as to be expected from Mayhem.\n\nGiven their recent output and sub-par guitarists nothing would make me happier than Blasphemer returning to Mayhem, and he certainly went out on a glorious high note with this album, his guitar-work is flawless and awe-inspiring, the riffs outright weird, dissonant, eerie...There are so many magical moments on this album that just make it more rewarding with each listen. It is hard at first, and you do need to be in the right mood to just sit down and listen to it in its entirety, but once you \"get it\", it's up there as one of their best yet.\n",
        "\nI really tried to like this album. Deathcrush was good for what it was and is fun but there isn't much to it; every other Mayhem release however has been experimental, cryptic and mindblowing, and fresh each time. This, however, despite my trying to get into it and initial belief that I was somehow missing something and that this is actually another work of genius like Ordo Ad Chao eventually proved to be, is Mayhem's worst release yet, and the only one I have been disappointed with. They have even failed to provide an adequate if not brilliant album after a near-ten year studio absence. I understand that both Euronymous and Blasphemer raised the bar really high, so an \"ok\" Mayhem album would have done just fine.\n\nThere is so much potential for Mayhem as a band; recently they have been reunited with both Maniac and Snorre Ruch on tours, and as much as Maniac can fail to deliver live it would really make my day to hear both him and Snorre return to their studio releases, if only in guest roles. Likewise, for years this band was joined by Limbonic Art's Morfeus following Blasphemer's departure, which did give me some hope that this band still knows what they're doing and chose a similarly talented and ambitious guitarist to fill the role. After he left though, what are we left with? Teloch from an ok-but-nothing-special black metal band Nidingr and the guitarist from Imperial Vengeance (who?...). That Mayhem needed two studio guitarists for the first time in their history is not a good sign.\n\nThe album starts off, like much of this album I would argue, being driven forward by the as always strong rhythm section. Necrobutcher is Necrobutcher as usual, Hellhammer never disappoints, but the guitar is so mediocre, generic and uninspiring this is all that interested me, and to add insult to injury this has a horrible, modern, compressed sound as well. Nothing compared to Blasphemer's pitch dark, muddy production of Ordo Ad Chao that was almost reminiscent of Immolation's muddy, evil production sound in some ways. \n\nPsywar did make me anticipate this album, it's not too bad, but again nothing special. Another problem here is that as with other potentially promising songs on the album, I find Attila just isn't the otherworldly, eccentric vocalist he once was. His performances on both De Mysteriis dom Sathanas and Ordo Ad Chao were unnerving, timeless and almost operatic in places. In comparison here he seems really one dimensional, it sounds sloppy. Maybe guesting with overhyped drone bores Sunn O))) and being in a terrible US supergroup cliche, he has got lazy and uninterested in recent years. \n\nSome parts of this album can only be described as noise, messy compress tuneless garbage with Attila's sub-par screeches over the top. Just everything about this pales in comparison to everything that came before. With Burzum going out on a fairly high note in the metal department, Darkthrone returning to a more serious form with Arctic Thunder and even Satyricon regaining some dignity with their last album, it really is tragic to see Mayhem end up like this. I love and respect the guys in this band (from the classic lineup at least), bit I hope they ditch the useless guitarists and aim for something more worthy of the Mayhem name next time...\n",
        "\nThis EP seems to be the cause of some controversy among both fans of Mayhem (like myself), and fans of black metal in general (also like myself). This, from what I can gather, is due to the debate of whether or not Mayhem should have reformed after the notorious death of Euronymous (who was the former lead guitarist), among other factors such as the quality of the vocals. I mention this controversy only because it cannot be dismissed, especially in a critique of this particular EP. \n\nNow the actual music on this EP, you know, the thing a review is supposed to address, is very good. Starting with what is, in my opinion, an evolution of the songwriting seen on De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas. DMDS was fast, but it wasn\u2019t what I would call technical. This is not a bad thing, it\u2019s just an observation. The songwriting on Wolf\u2019s Lair Abyss, however, IS what I would call technical. This is reflected in the intense, multifaceted riffs, and even faster drumming than before. I really enjoyed this, and thanks to this EP, I\u2019m going to further explore Mayhem\u2019s later discography. \n\nNow onto the vocals\u2026 they\u2019re decent. Not the abominable ridiculousness that certain people claim it to be, nor is it to be put on a pedestal as the standard of prime black metal vocals in my opinion. They swing between being genuinely scary, and kind of funny. They\u2019re memorable, I\u2019ll say that much. If I were to criticize this EP further, I would say that the production is rather inconsistent from track to track. It never stuck out as being a bad thing, it is just something to take note of. It feels as if each track was recorded in a different session. However it is of consistently high quality, so that\u2019s a plus.\n\nOverall, I think this EP is a good entry in Mayhem\u2019s discography. Not quite as an introduction to Mayhem, but as an additional entry in a fan\u2019s collection. With memorable, technically proficient songwriting and riffs, vocals that work and are never distracting, and production that somehow manages to sound different from track to track, yet remains of high quality throughout, I think this has, and will please(d) its fair share of Mayhem fans.\n",
        "\nWe are all familiar with the infamous Mayhem. The first Norwegian black metal band, they quickly gained \"popularity\" in the late 1980s and early 1990s due to the slew of controversial events that surrounded the band at the time. From the arson of old Norwegian churches to the suicide of the band's vocalist Dead and the murder of guitarist Euronymous by former bandmate Varg Vikernes of Burzum, Mayhem had a lot going on from the years of 1990 to 1994. This album, \"De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\", is Mayhem's magnum opus and instantly recognized as a true classic in the black metal genre, for good reason. Songwriting for this album began as early as 1987 and finally it was recorded from 1992 to 1993. However, it wouldn't be released until May of 1994, as it was delayed to the aforementioned suicide of the band's vocalist and the murder of Euronymous. Dead does not perform on this album, but Euronymous does, and this marks another reason for the album's controversy. \n\nThe guitars are definitely the focal point here. Euronymous may have been an asshole and a pretentious cunt, but he was one hell of a guitarist. According to Fenriz of Darkthrone fame, Euronymous \"invented\" the traditional black metal riff. I'm not sure how accurate I find this statement but seeing how Mayhem was indeed the first Norwegian black metal band, this could definitely be argued. His riffs fit the music extremely well and unfortunately after his murder, Mayhem has not put out an album that matched DMDS in terms of guitar work. His riffs are extremely dark and ferocious but also contain a nice helping of melody, with tracks such as \"Funeral Fog\" and \"Freezing Moon\". Some of these songs do make time for guitar solos, such as \"Freezing Moon\" and \"Life Eternal\" but as we are all aware, solos are a bit rare in black metal. Most of these songs focus more on atmosphere, emotion, and darkness rather than on technicality. I would have liked to hear a few more solos but these songs are all amazing just the way they are. It is a well-known fact that no other guitarists Mayhem has had throughout the years have been able to capture the solo from \"Freezing Moon\" as well as Euronymous did here. An asshole? Yes, absolutely. But a damn good guitarist. \n\nAnother controversial point about this album was the vocal performance. After Dead shot himself, Euronymous recruited Hungarian vocalist Attila Csihar, previously a member of the black metal band Tormentor. I thought it was interesting how someone of Hungarian nativity made it on this album, but of course not in a bad way. Attila has played a huge role in Mayhem's career, later returning with the band and recording on the album \"Ordo Ad Chao\" in 2007. He is still with the band today. On this album, his vocal performance is either loved or completely abhorred. His style of vocals here is not the traditional black metal scream nearly perfected by Dead, but rather a more unorthodox, abyssal approach to this style of singing. He uses styles that resemble chants at times and even a resemblance of clean vocals on the album's title-track. His style can best be described as deep, inhuman, and maybe even \"strangely operatic\". At times, it's easy to hear his Hungarian accent and that really adds a sense of originality. A lot of people dislike his performance here but I personally absolutely love it, and to this day, remains one of the most unique and versatile vocal styles in black metal.\n\nThe controversy does not stop there. Another widely known fact surrounding this album is the bass performance. None other than Count Grishnackh (Varg Vikernes of Burzum) was responsible for the bass playing on this album. Necrobutcher left Mayhem in 1991 and therefore was replaced by Varg as a session bassist for the album. This is extremely ironic due to the fact that Varg would end up killing Euronymous, and really adds to the overall controversy surrounding Mayhem and this album. His bass playing is audible but apparently was turned down a bit in the final mix. It dances around the guitar riffs and can definitely be heard in the background. According to Hellhammer, the family of Euronymous wanted the bass to be rerecorded, as they did not want Varg to be involved with the same album as their son. However, he did not know how to play bass, so this never happened. To quote Hellhammer: \"I thought it was appropriate that the murderer and victim were on the same record. I put word out that I was re-recording the bass parts, but I never did\". So in the end, Vikernes remained on the final product, and this became another chapter in the dark history of early Norwegian black metal. \n\nThe drums on this album are extremely potent and in-your-face. Hellhammer is arguably the best drummer to come out of the Norwegian black metal scene, as well as black metal as a whole. His blast beats are furious all the while focused, and his double bass is pummeling. His work on all of these tracks is commendable, but the songs that really stick out to me are \"Funeral Fog\", \"Freezing Moon\", \"Pagan Fears\", and the title-track. He is a varied drummer, as well, and does not simply blast the entire time. He freely alternates between blast beats and mid-paced drumlines, sometimes slowing down to a doom pace during some of the slower sections on the album. His work here has proved historically influential and has led him to drum with other Norwegian heavyweights such as Arcturus and Age of Silence, as well as Dimmu Borgir and Antestor, performing as a session drummer. He was even a member of the Swedish black metal band Shining from 2001 to 2004, showing that his work extends even outside of Norway. \n\nThis album is just as important to the controversy of black metal as it was to shaping the sound of the genre as a whole. It is impossible to discuss this album without mentioning murder, suicide, and church arson, but at the same time, it's something that actually backs up the \"classic\" status that has been tagged onto it. This album will live on forever and will most likely prove to be a \"gateway album\" to the earlier years of black metal. If there was an album that fit the \"True Norwegian Black Metal\" title perfectly, this one would be it.\n",
        "\nWith all the sensationalism that sprouted out around the music, it's sometimes easy to forget just how good some of the Second Wave classics really are. To date, I still don't think anyone's managed to make an album as cold, dark and foreboding as De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas, at least not without extending past the boundaries of what true black metal is supposed to be. I still vividly remember the night when I heard it for the first time. I'm pretty sure I was 13 years old, and my exposure to the furthest reaches of metal was still fairly limited. I can still recall the night because it was the first time I was legitimately scared by the music I was hearing. Atila's operatic croons on the punishing title track sounded like a ghost was trying to communicate with me using the album as a medium. There is no rulebook on how to create that sort of effect in music. If it happens (and it almost never does) it's because the passion and feeling of the artist has been directly imprinted into the music. Listening to DMDS, I don't think Mayhem felt anything but hatred while making this album.\n\nFrom all I've heard of the guy, my views on Euronymous are pretty mixed. I suppose I can't have a real opinion unless I'd met him myself, but from interviews and anecdotes he tends to sound like an edgy adolescent who wanted to boost his sense of self-importance by provoking people. His \"anti-Life\" statements were more the means than an end, and there's not a lot of reason to believe he really practiced everything he would preach to anyone with a willing ear. If there's anything, on the other hand, that suggests he was serious about evil, it's DMDS. The atmosphere here is some of the most authentic that's ever been heard on a black metal record; you can't fake your way to making a sound like this. Euronymous' guitar tone is here is the most perfect I've heard in black metal. It's cold and fuzzy, but the sophistication of his riffs isn't lost in the production. His riffs are cut from all different speeds, and the sometimes abrupt way they're linked together in the songwriting keeps the listener from ever getting too comfortable with one pace. Euronymous was a more gifted player than most (only Ihsahn from Emperor could really compare) but he knew to keep the majority of his riffs quite simple. Simple, but never simplistic. The moods he conjures from his burstfire chord progressions are effective and timeless.\n\nDe Mysteriis Dom Sathanas may be Euronymous' vision, but the other musicians offered an irreplaceable role in making the album great. Despite such an extremity and hateful mentality, the most controversial thing about this album seems to be the throaty croak of Atila Csihar, who had previously done noble work in Hungary's Tormentor. I am positive DMDS would not have sounded nearly as good if Dead had been alive to do the vocals. However vital he was to the black metal image, Atila as a replacement gave Mayhem a dynamic voice that still sounds terrifying. His shift towards a quasi-operatic wail at the album's end was the thing that directly scared me. Like Nattramn from Silencer (albeit to a lesser degree) not everyone is going to be onboard with such a theatrical performance in black metal. It absolutely could have sounded like shit in the wrong hands, but I can't imagine DMDS without Atila.\n\nHellhammer's drumwork on DMDS is something that doesn't get nearly enough praise. A Euronymous-led Mayhem doesn't offer him the space to strut his technical skills fully, but a lot of the best riffs on the album are great in part thanks to the chemistry between guitarist and drummer. The way Hellhammer navigates the riff changes on \"Funeral Fog\" is a perfect example. A slight change of tempo makes a new riff feel like a revelation. Euronymous' riffs are the thing that made DMDS so influential, but they wouldn't have had such a palpable effect if the guitars had been the only ingenious thing to keep an ear out for on the album. Even Varg Vikernes' bass (however muted) rounds out the sound in a way that's rare to hear in black metal. However ugly the album is, it is damn close to some kind of perfection. If I was nitpicking for faults, I might say \"From the Dark Past\" and \"Buried by Time and Dust\" are a bit less engaging than the songs before them, but even then, I'm never thinking of faults or weakness while I'm listening to the album. Every track works as an appendage for Mayhem's atmosphere. Even today, when hundreds of bands have tried to follow them since, I've never heard anything quite like De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas. This is true anti-human music if ever I've heard it.\n",
        "\n'Live in Bischofswerda' is probably one of the worst, unprofessional and horrible metal concerts ever caught on tape. There is absolutely nothing good about this product. I can sum up the experience of watching this horrendous tape in two parts. First, I was shocked at how much a live video could suck, and then, I couldn't stop laughing realizing how ridiculous it was. \n\nLet's start with the vocals: what the heck is this piece of shit? 'Maniac' was barely sufferable in 'Deathcrush', but in this performance...boy, you better make sure your ear plugs are nearby! Ever watched 'Lord Of The Rings'? This is Sm\u00e9agol in disguise, gurgling the lyrics with zero accentuation while vomiting. While 'Attila' had some mysterious quality and unique approach, 'Maniac' just spit out the lyrics with the poorest diction possible and sounds utterly pathetic. \n\nBesides that, the whole production of this video is way too amateurish. The drumming is utterly flat. The recording quality is so cheap that the never ending blast beats sounds like a popcorn exploding in a microwave. You can barely distinguish between the cymbals or snare, everything just sounds the same and will make you want to hit the stop button as soon as possible. Bass guitar? Forget about it, utterly inaudible. Except for the parts when you'll hear some random farts in the background: these are actually the remnants of the bass that somehow managed to leak into the final mix. What about the guitar's sound? Well, don't expect much as well. The guitar's tone is so vague and way too castrated so even crushing riffs such as in 'Deathcrush' or 'Funeral Fog' sounds most of the time like random hovering white noise.\n\nMoreover, besides 'Maniac' which struggles desperately to actually create some sort of performance, the whole show looks like an anemic exhibition of static puppets. 'Blasphemer' and 'Necrobutcher' have no charisma at all and are simply boring to watch. The hung pig heads on the stage just makes this whole concert looks more awkward than it is and the random slow motion camera shots are just pathetic.\n\nJust ignore this release, it doesn't make justice for any of the original recordings. If you do wish to experience one of the most pathetic, bad recorded performances ever made, you can probably find this concert in YouTube and laugh a bit. Definitely don't waste a penny for this crap.\n",
        "\n\"If you don't believe in God, clap yo hands\"\n\nIf you thought that Pure Fucking Armageddon was a mess, you have definitely not listened to this demo. It is so lo-fi, you need to have a very demo-friendly ear (which most of us don't really have) to distinguish the damn guitar from the drums (except for a few moments, particularly on the outro of Transition. It seems like the whole demo was recorded with the cheapest microphone the band found, and in a garage which had the worst possible acoustics.\n\nNow, for the audible part of the music: the riffs are somewhat distinguishable from the other instruments, but are distorted so much they sound like a very Sloth-y fuzz. The bass isn't there, along with the vocals which need a very trained ear to be heard (and aren't that special either). The drums, like the ones played in every one Mayhem release, are far beyond superior, but they are also quite blurry and unheard in the demo.\n\nThe most dominant thing in this demo, except for the lack of musical professionalism, is the humorous and light approach to the music. Sloppy Dead Kennedys covers can be found here, with the usual sick Mayhem lyrics and Maniac singing a motherfucking chant from an advertisement of the Church of England. And it turns out to be the most metal thing in this whole mess. Listen only if you find this, or if you are a fan of super lo-fi black metal albums.\n\n\"If you don't trust the lord then clap yo hands\"\n",
        "\nAs opposed to some, I am not going to write about the history of the infamous band behind this masterpiece itself, since I am sure those looking for a review of this classic are already aware of all the craziness which took place during the few years following the release of this glorious EP.\n\nI will have to say though, Euronymous (or should I say \"Deathsaw\" here) was one of the most creative, innovative (maybe even a tad bit crazy) personalities in the black metal genre ever, and I will indeed mention I believe his satanic, murderous, evil persona helped spawn both this release and subsequent releases by other bands in the early Norwegian black metal scene which followed this one as well. Everyone in the scene ended up being influenced by both his style and his personal beliefs in one way or another, going as far as to change their musical style after being introduced to him and his dark, satanic \"world\" (compare the very first Darkthrone releases to those they released when Euronymous was in his prime). I hate with a passion how people nowadays tend to act as if Mayhem/Euronymous never even existed or influenced anyone; please.\n\nThat being said, I will now attempt to solely focus on the havoc that is the \"music\" contained in this EP itself as much as I am able to. This is basically the direct equivalent to a sonic, full-power assault on all who dare listen to this. I am not really even trying to exaggerate the rawness of this, but raw it is indeed. The guitar sound is akin to an actual chainsaw (get \"Deathsaw\" now?), the drums sound like firing heavy machine guns (Manheim \"Hellhammers\", anyone?), and the vocals, performed by Maniac (here \"Gutpuking\") and Messiah (\"Iron Lungs\", session) are just plain insanity. It takes a while to figure out what the hell (ha, get it) they are even trying to say, even if you're reading the lyrics while listening to the album, but when you do, you will surely understand why the band gained its notorious infamy; well, at least partly.\n\nRecorded at Creative Studios, Kolbotn, Norway, during February/March 1987, this record is the essence of a destructive, brutal, all-out battle. The songs on this EP are heavy, dark, strong, disgusting, and crushing. In fact, \"Chainsaw Gutsfuck\", has been rated on occasion as having some of the most gruesome lyrics of all music. \n\nOverall, this release is the sole essence of black metal, Norwegian or not. It embodies so well everything that would later become standard to the genre in such a refreshing, yet stale, shocking, yet repetitive, refreshing, yet abrasive, manner. From the hellishly fast drumming to the infernal shrieks which seem to pour out of an abandoned, lost soul; from the macabre gory lyrics to the extreme imagery; you name it: anything black metal is probably represented here in one way or another.\n\nI bought a copy of the DSP 1993 issue of the EP on a trip I made to Oslo at Nesebl\u00f6d Records, the current shop standing where the old Euronymous' shop Helvete used to be located at back when the Black Circle was a thing. Please forgive if this review were to be fraught with immature nostalgia in the slightest, for it was not intended, but probably still deserved.\n\nI recommend every black metal fan to avidly look for a copy of \"Deathcrush\", there is nothing quite like playing it loudly while your soul is showered away by continuous blast beats and your flesh is crippled by the piercing vocals. All hail Euronymous!\n\nOh, I forgot. The cover on this thing is a picture of two cut-off hands on exhibition in Mauritania. Cheers.\n",
        "\nPeople generally fall into one of two rival nations with this demo. One camp thinks PFA is \"kvlt as svit\" and love it, lo-fi quality and all. The other camp hates the thing. Personally, I think the album is more outdated than straight up bad and still has enough merit for any Mayhem fan who hasn't heard it to go and track a bootleg down - or the real thing if you have the money to waste.\n\nTo address the first thing everyone notices when they throw the thing in, this album sounds like you've stuffed your speakers with cotton wool. This both helps and hinders the demo in varying ways. The better sections are haunting. The intro for example is really helped out by the production and other tracks have weaved it into their atmosphere. At other times, it just sounds like no one knew what they were doing, which was probably the case in most places. That turns a lot of people off, but as a lover of bad production, I find myself strangely drawn to it. Even at it's worst, the demo never gets as bad as the Burzum demos do and that's always a plus. \n\nThe \"Fuck\" side is what you'd expect, E. coli raw black metal. If you've dropped \"Deathcrush\" into your toilet before, you know how this side sounds. The real standout is the title track \"Pure Fucking Armageddon\". It's messy, loud start is only overshadowed by Euronymous great riff work. It's a track that's stayed relevant in Mayhem's discography for over 30 years. In fact, most of the songs on this demo are really well written, they may lack the sorrow and cold harshness the band would pick up with later releases but tracks like \"Carnage\" have a fittingly violent B-movie feel to them that fits the satanic thrash metal approach of the demo. Oddly enough, the excellence of the song writing creates a little bit of a problem I'll talk about later.\n\nI'd say I like the \"Off\" side a little more. The tracks have more energy to them, there's no vocals and, weirdly enough, the production and mixing is better. There isn't a whole lot to say on it, it's just Mayhem getting ready and sounding great. If you just want to hear what a pre-Dead Mayhem sound like and want to headbang a little to some killer riffs, I'd skip the fuck and go straight to off. \n\nAnother highlight is the individual performances. When he isn't trying to swallow the microphone, Euronymous is at his peak with one of the best guitar tones he's ever had. When you can hear him, Necrobutcher is also on the ball. He didn't blow me away like he did on say, \"Live in Leipzig\", but he works off Euronymous really well and certainly gives his two cent to the wall of noise. Manheim is a drummer I've never thought was all that good. I could rant about the guy all day but here he's actually pretty good. Unlike on other releases, he can keep a basic rhythm and his kick is nice and meaty. The vocals are a different story however. To put it in the bluntest way possible, they suck. They're just an incomprehensible afterthought that drag everything down a notch.\n\nMixed in with these classics, PFA has a big stinker. \"Black Metal (Total Death Version)\" is garbage, almost unlistenable crap that goes nowhere and doesn't resemble Venom's classic at all, it's exclusion is another reason why I recommend the \"Off\" side. \"Ghoul\" is another track I don't care for at all, the drums and laughably bad vocals completely kill what should have been killer. I presume that Manheim found a killer tape of some African drums and decided to throw (forcefully inject) them in there for whatever reason. If all I can think about while listening to your Norwegian black metal song about a flesh-eating creature of the night is the sunny plains of Kenya, you failed as a musician. \n\nThe achilles heel of \"Pure Fucking Armageddon\" though isn't a bad track or it's muffled recording quality, it's that these songs were so great the band have recorded WAY better versions of them on other albums. \"Carnage\" is a dime a dozen as far as alternate versions go, as is \"Pure Fucking Armageddon\". Even \"Ghoul\" has a handful of re-recordings, all of which are tighter than the one featured here. That's this album's biggest problem, the band outgrew this demo and no matter how much I like most of these tracks, there are way better versions out there of them. \n\nTo finish, this demo is alright. If you already like Mayhem and want to see where they came from, you'll enjoy it as a work of it's time. If you're just getting into black metal, I'd recommend staying away till you've heard the rest of Mayhem's \"Euro-days\".\n",
        "\nOne thing that I personally feel is difficult to find in black metal are live albums: let alone good live ones. Fortunately, the infamous genre legends Mayhem have delivered in the form of \"Live in Leipzig,\" originally recorded in 1991 and issued in 1993 to commemorate the death of Dead, the album delivers many classic songs recorded by Mayhem prior to the year it was performed.\n\nThe album's vocals as performed by Dead are superb, and I would argue that the songs adapted from the band's prior album \"Deathcrush,\" are better on this album than on the 1987 version. Hellhammer's performance illustrates his mastery on the drums, especially for the album's final track: \"Pure Fucking Armageddon.\" Necrobutcher's bass is somewhat drowned out but nonetheless heavy (particularly for the beginning of Chainsaw Gutsfuck,\" and \"Deathcrush.\" Finally, Euronymous proves his skill with the guitar on solos throughout the album, and shines the most on \"The Freezing Moon.\"\n\nThe album itself in my opinion is a prime example of a live one. The conversations and cheering between the audience in the background, the introductions by Dead, the little guitar picking and audio flubs all add an ambiance to the album and make it all the better. \n\nThe songs are all spectacular; not a single weak performance. The best song and personal favorite would have to be track four: \"The Freezing Moon.\" As mentioned in the description of the band members, all of their talents pull through in the performance of the seven-minute and iconic song that has become a kind of anthem for the black metal genre. The particularly heavy showing of \"Necrolust\" and \"Pagan Fears\" tie in as the best songs on the album. \n\nThe only weakness comes in the form of the cutting out of audio. I don't mind the poor quality (in fact, that's one of the reasons why I love the album) but there's a problem with the introductions of some songs by Dead being cut out or inaudible (Buried by Time and Dust, anyone?) The most grievous issue comes into light with Dead's introduction to their nine-song performance. Usually before performing, Dead would say \"Only black is true, only death is real.\" Unfortunately, only the latter half of the statement by Dead are present in the album after getting cut off. \n\nDespite the little kinks here and there, I absolutely recommend this album to anybody who is a fan of black metal, Mayhem and especially solid and iconic live performances alike. Rest in peace, Dead and Euronymous.\n",
        "\nI was on the fence about listening to DMDS, if only because of my general disdain for a couple of the people involved, but it's reputation did precede it, so curiosity got the better of me. I mean, it had to be some kind of mega brilliance to, in spite of the events surrounding it, not only be praised, but called by some as \"the greatest black metal album of all time\", right? So I pop the thing in and... honestly? I get why people enjoy this record. It's not a bad record by any stretch of the imagination.\n\nEuronymous' guitar work has this fantastic chainsaw quality to it, although there are times when I feel the riffs drag a little longer than they have any business doing. Like on the opening track Freezing Moon, where we get like, two and a half minutes of quasi-atmospheric guitar work that screams for your attention. Varg is just sort of in the background as far as I can tell, the bass never really sticks out to me, although that is probably because Euronymous' technique is more interesting. Hellhammer's drumming is fantastic; This was honestly my first encounter with his work and I can see why people give him the praise they do. His technique is very thick and layered, combining brief little rhythmic bursts with a style that emphasizes speed more than most blast beat drumming. Then of course you have Attila Csihar, who may very well be the Freddie Mercury of black metal. He's able to go from glorious baroque opera vocals that you expect from Tony Award winners who make Scott Walker jealous to the nastiest, most skin-crawling, guttural black metal shrieks, which haunt you in your most private moments. It feels like a horrific, hell-born spirit just haunts this entire record, never letting you escape from it's dark clutches.\n\nIf it seems like I'm giving Atilla the most praise, it's because I am, and there's due course for that. In relation to my problem with this record, Atilla aside, this feels like a more cacophonous version of my favorite black metal record, Battles In The North. An album that I didn't need morbid curiosity for and an album that I enjoy front to back. The riffs are nasty, the drums pounding, the vocalist is stomach churning, the lyrics are morbid. I get the same vibe from these bands, which doesn't really help, since this was Norway in the '90s and the black metal scene was still very new, so for me to give a damn, I need you to sound more unique. The result is that I come away feeling like I just tuned in to The Attila Csihar Show, with the rest of the band as the supporting cast. It's a good show.... just not one I'm watching with enthusiasm.\n\nAgain, by no means is this a bad record, but because Atilla steals the show, and because this so early in the black metal scene, which consequently makes me demand unique qualities... I don't know, I just expected more. I think if they'd had Maniac on vocals this might've gone over better with me, just because then you wouldn't have someone overshadowing the rest of the band in it's early stages. Overall, it's a good record, but the deified praise it gets is kind of unwarranted.\n",
        "\n'De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas' is more of a monument than a conventional album. Recorded with help from Burzum's Varg Vikernes, yet released after he had murdered guitarist and Mayhem founder Euronymous, this album has a history all its own that draws as many (if not more) listeners than the music itself. As arguably the first true black metal band, Mayhem's debut full-length (lest we forget they released the famed 'Deathcrush' demo as far back as 1987) might supposedly be one of the \"purest\" black metal releases and among the most important from the Norwegian wave of early 90s bands. In a curious contradiction, it both is and is not pure, is and is not important, and is and is not a success.\n\nIn the first place, the music that appears on this album is certainly older than its release date. Some parts were recorded as early as 1992 and the style is much simpler than anything that came from the younger bands like Enslaved, Satyricon, and Emperor who would quickly transform black metal into an open-ended term that included folk and classical elements. The 8 songs here are predominantly blast-oriented, featuring blistering tremolo riffs, some crawling slower sections, and a focused, hateful delivery. Experimentation is not the order of the day, though it is vital to notice how many details Mayhem worked into a relatively simple formula. In some ways, every musician both helped to create and break away from the archetype of black metal, be it the frantically hammering tremolos and blasts that open the album or the otherworldly monkish croon that ends it.\n\nHellhammer's drums are absolutely colossal and the album owes a large portion of its success to his performance. His savage blasting takes a sizable percentage of the playtime, yet the fills that he adds to slow and fast sections alike are inspired and gain a cavernous resonance from the production. Listen to the closing minute of 'Funeral Fog' or the eerie breakdown in 'From the Dark Past' to witness his powers. The only other permanent member at the time of recording,\n\nEuronymous's parts are just as blistering as his partner's, though arguably more generic. Opting not to go for the frosty, trebly sound of the other Oslo bands, his churning riffs have more of a caustic quality to them, though also with a dark undertone like mountains opening or an immense truth dawning. The slower guitar parts are partly doom influenced as they were with Darkthrone and Burzum's early work and here they additionally sport some more ambiguous moments in 'Life Eternal', which floats and meanders like a trip down the Styx. His defining moment must be the solo in the equally ambiguous 'Freezing Moon', a solo that is steadfastly traditional in its execution, while lost and lamenting in its atmosphere, sounding like a piercing threnody to lost hope and damnation.\n\nShadowing Euronymous at every turn is the eerily mournful and wandering bass of Vikernes, which (despite the fact that it was purportedly turned down in the mix) is often very clear and would be a haunting presence even without the context. Not only at quieter moments, that bass moans through the guitar and the drums, creating ominous silhouettes and a lonely, empty feeling that sounds as if Vikernes were recording utterly alone. In 'Pagan Fears' and particularly 'Life Eternal', he plays out of step with the rest of the band, meaning that the hatefulness and relentlessness of Hellhammer and Euronymous is mixed in with an uneasiness that would seem to combine the physical and mental attributes of the typical black metal disciple. Perhaps all this could seem like reading too much into the performances, but the music is dense and potent with emotion when one looks closely.\n\nThe weird icing on this musty cake is of course Attila Csihar, who always produces the unexpected for any project in which he is involved. A million miles away from the typically tortured black metal scream, he groans and rasps theatrically and incoherently as if he really were a spirit possessed. His contribution is rarely in keeping with his bandmates, yet the unpredictability of his voice is just what such an album requires to keep it from becoming one-dimensional or flat. There are long periods in which he falls silent, then he will rise again like a ghoul, frequently dropping the volume of his voice to a barely audible moan, as intangible as the wind through the trees. The unearthly style is closer to animalistic or demented than demonic, which coalesces with the cavernous sounds of drums and guitars to make each song feel like a great secret revealed. The lyrics also draw from the same source, surprisingly steering clear of anti-Christian themes (Mayhem were involved in the church-burnings of the Oslo scene) and tending towards mystical revelations of impenetrable time and wisdom. The title track has an incredible quality of sounding like a vast initiation that transcends music with Attila's yawned invocations and leaves the listener cowering in fear and wonder.\n\nThe true strength of this album lies in those performances. The songs are all cut from the same cloth, excepting those less aggressive moments in 'Freezing Moon' and 'Life Eternal', but the individual contributions lift the sometimes basic songwriting to a higher level. When the musicians join forces for the furious pummelling of 'Buried by Time & Dust', the power is truly something to behold, though it is the frequent sidetracks that make this so rewarding to listen to repeatedly. When Hellhammer shoots out a thunderous fill, when Euronymous strikes a lightning bolt riff break across the silence, when Vikernes wanders unsettlingly away from the other instruments, when Attila splutters up another riddle, that's when this album really makes sense and shows itself worthy of the attention paid to it. There aren't any particularly weak moments since it is best experienced as an immersive whole, where the atmosphere can work its way into your mind.\n\nRegardless of its history, 'De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas' is still an essential listen for anyone even remotely curious about black metal. The bold statements that the songs at first appear to be steadily transform into varied and subtle hymns of mystery and age that sound as powerful today as they did when they were first imagined. In a way the only true Mayhem album, this shows that, even at the roots of the genre, there was a depth of thought and wilfulness to subvert that has been overshadowed by the surrounding events.\n",
        "\nI love Mayhem, I really do. As far as second wave black metal goes, they are possibly the only band that has done no wrong. De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas was my first black metal album, forever ensnaring me into the darkened musical caverns from which it came. However, this is just crap. This is a release which is absolutely pointless today, and would have served little purpose back in 1986. It may have heralded the beginning of metal's most infamous of all regional scenes, and ushered in a new wave of black metal, but even then this was supplanted completely within a year.\n\nI think this is supposed to be some form of black metal, or indeed music? I really can't tell, because the production is fucking abysmal, even by the standards of a late 80's second wave demo. Everything is smothered in distortion, resulting in a ludicrously loud crackling every time some sort of noise is made. In addition, the mix is completely off, to the point where only the drums are kind of audible, while the guitars and vocals are drowned out completely. Even worse is that the whole thing is very quiet, meaning hearing anything is a challenge unless the sound is turned up very high. If I have to turn up my sound to that extent to hear some music... then the production is an utter failure.\n\nI can't really discern too much from the auditory fits of nonsense that plague this, performance wise. There is this loud, highly repetitious thudding that is most likely some drums being hit. Behind it is some quiet rumbling that sound a bit like guitars, and behind those is some faint crackling that could probably be some sort of black metal rasp. From what I can tell, the drumming is extremely basic in nature, though it doesn't sound like blasting in the vein of 'Funeral Fog' or 'I Am Thy Labyrinth', to be honest. Even if it was, the blasting can't be heard, so they may as well have never happened. The guitar riffs are just as repetitive, and while this is fine on Deathcrush or even this band's debut, the tone here is so bad that the riffs become outright annoying to listen to. I can't even comment on the vocals, as I can't here enough of them to make a judgement. They are there, so hats off, I guess.\n\nSongwriting is never too much of an issue with black metal, and the songwriting here is actually quite good, in this sense. It features the same primitive, repetitive style that is heard on this band's '87 demo and debut, as well as the likes of Transilvanian Hunger. It is the sort that allows the songs to develop atmospherically rather than instrumentally. Unfortunately, it is all for naught, because the music presented here sounds terrible.\n\nThis doesn't even have the virtue of any tracks exclusive to this demo. Every track here, barring 'Ghoul' and the intro 'Voice of a Tortured Skull' has been re-recorded at some point with significantly better production and much tighter performances. The intro sounds like crap, and doesn't do a whole lot to conjure up any atmosphere, and 'Ghoul' sounds like anything else here - over-distorted, incomprehensible, incoherent rubbish. This release had a little bit of point back in '86, but now is completely useless, save for one iota of historical value.\n\nI know that this sort of raw and 'kvlt' production, so to speak, is considered the norm in black metal. And that is fine, I get the appeal. Hell, it is what makes black metal seem so hostile and desolate in atmosphere, but there is a limit to this effect. When the production obfuscates the songs to the point where they could be passed off as a recent Sloth demo, as in, pure noise, then it doesn't give that atmosphere. It just sounds rubbish, and regardless of what the band were playing, that is irrelevant. The sound produced in the end is what is important (for instance, who cares if the drummer blasts when you can't fucking here it!), and that is where this demo flops. This thing also proves that once again, production goes a long way, even on a demo tape of this nature. Don't bother with this; the historical significance alone is not enough to pick up such an abysmal and pointless demo by a great band. Go and get Deathcrush, which is this formula done right, to hear Mayhem at their rawest.\n",
        "\nThis is currently the latest Mayhem album, which shows that they simply don't know what they are doing, besides milking the hype and the kvlt factor of the band's history and fame.\n\nGenerally speaking, this is the usual Mayhem's post Wolf's Lair Abyss in terms of riffing, with the incessant blasting that plagued the aforementioned EP. Most of the songs sound really the same and since the band decided to use almost the same tempo throughout the album, it gets boring REALLY fast, thus the replay value is near zero. Also, the album is way too long for this style of black metal, clocking around 51 minutes of the same thing. Wolf's Lair Abyss was around 24 minutes and it's already sonically tiring, just imagine going through this album in just one listening session.\n\nHellhammer is playing blastbeats/fast double bass patters 90% of the time in mostly the same tempo, which is one of the main reasons this album gets tiring fast. The drum production is really dry and lacks dynamics, which only accentuates the impression of HH playing the same beats over and over again. His playing is tight, as expected, but not really inspired, giving the impression he recorded his parts without much thinking of the drum arrangements, trying to get rid of the recording process as quick as possible.\n\nThe riffing is also quite monotonous and it comes in basically two ways: is either a fast palm muted chug on the E string or it's a dissonant arpeggiated chord (which is almost the same one over and over). Bass can be heard but it does nothing really outstanding besides keeps the low end. Taking all these elements into account, the songs in terms of structure, sound and feel are VERY interchangeable and vapid, which ultimately means that there is near 0% of memorability in the whole album. The only way to distinguish a track from another is the placement of an odd clean guitar break, which can be found either in the middle or at the end of a certain song. Those clean sections are comprised by Teloch strumming one or two dissonant chords that are totally unrelated to the heavier parts. Those dissonant chords are really similar to the ones used by Satyr in his band since the Rebel Extravaganza days. The heavier riffs are also more akin to death metal than black metal.\n\nThe artistic merit of this album seems to be also near zero. EW brings nothing new to the table and all what you can hear here has been already done in better ways (even by themselves like in GDOW and some portions of Chimera). Attila is the only one who seems to care about delivering something worthwhile, since his vocals sound passionate enough. The rest of the band is just going through the motions: Teloch performing riffs with the same tired cacophonies in tremolo speed, while HH blasts just for the sake of recording something fast that will probably please and/or fool some Dead and Euro fans. Attila should find another band or return to Aborym.\n\nMy recommendation is to skip this one entirely, forget the logo pasted on the cover and give your time and money to something way more worthy out there.\n",
        "\nStudio Tracks is the only release of Mayhem (or should I say, The True Mayhem because of its historical lineup: Dead, Euronymous, Necrobutcher and Hellhammer. A lineup that would never be present again at a studio to record anything) that has Dead on vocals; this is the only release Mayhem has with Dead where the quality of music was recorded in studio and for that reason its better than a demo, a bootleg or a rehearsal; even when these two songs could be simple demos, the quality they have fits perfectly well with the atmosphere and with black metal genre overall: they are dark, mysterious, they create heavy and strange surroundings, like being locked in a weird place at night without escape. Both songs are sinister and, in my opinion, this is more than just black metal or old school (first wave) black metal; Sarc\u00f3fago's INRI, Vulcano's Bloody Vengeance or Necrodeath's Into the Macabre are considered black/death/thrash metal releases, and in these two songs I find darkness that, although it's not as extreme like the aggressive evilness found in those albums I said before, it is a more sinister darkness.\n\nIts all about the atmosphere these two songs create, Carnage sounds like if they had someone locked and they were about to torture him and after that they were about to do a kind of invocation; and, with Freezing Moon, we have the best version that could be found of this song, neither the version appearing in De Mysteriis dom Sathanas, nor the ones in Leipzig or Dawn of the Black Hearts are as interesting as this version is. Dead sounds just like if he was really dead, even when his vocals are not the harshest or the most shrieky in the whole black metal genre (although there is people who consider him the best black metal vocalist ever), they do sound like if Dead was sick or had an infection inside his body that gave him a strange kind of pain.\n\nAfter vocals, what sounds better is the drums, which aren't noisy and sound well and they get along with vocals, guitars and bass doesn't sound as prominent as vocals or drums do, and this could be because of the production of the songs, nevertheless, it's not a bad thing since all of this creates a heavy, cold and dark atmosphere.\n\nI consider this release a somewhat kind of black/death metal because guitars in the last 25 seconds of Freezing Moon sound a bit \"rotten\" (in a death metal way); same for Carnage, in the last 40 seconds of the song, it sounds a bit to death metal too, it could be used on a death metal song and it would sound interesting.\n",
        "\nIn an ideal world, no list of best metal records of all time should go without a prominent mention of Mayhem's debut mini-album, because its overwhelming quality is not a subjective impression but an objective fact. A record of this magnitude hadn't happened in its field until the point it was released, and it certainly was never reached in quality and impact, neither by the band itself nor the thousands that followed. Like an alignment of all eight planets in the solar system in one straight line, this record is one of the rarest of occurances where just the right elements were combined by just the right people in just the right way at just the right time. If perfection in black metal had a name, Deathcrush would be it.\n\nThere is something uniquely feral about this mini-album, as if the musicians involved had been set out into the wild at early childhood with a set of musical instruments, and this record was the result of their channelling the lifeforce of the rugged Norwegian landscapes and the essence of the hardships endured trying to survive in such an unforgiving environment on next to nothing with only their primal instincts and an iron will to endure as tools at their disposal. This record typifies the strength of character necessary to survive in the Norwegian outback far away from civilisation far more than any release made by a Norwegian band in the 1990s or later, because it is so much more primitive in nature, and much more in tune with just how inhospitable Norway is away from human settlements.\n\nAnd they really couldn't have picked a better introduction for the savagery they would unleash. \"Silvester Anfang\", as many of you know, is a piece by experimental/noise music pioneer and former Tangerine Dream member Conrad Schnitzler, who was contacted by the band for an introduction, and submitted this piece as his unique interpretation of the type of music they play on this mini-album. The result not only emphasises the feral nature of the music as a whole, but gives it a character far darker than the imagery I painted in my previous paragraph, as if this is not the work of human children set out in the deep forests for the entirety of their lifetime, but orcs from a fantasy realm such as Tolkien's, or, far more accurately, Morlocks from H.G. Wells' The Time Machine, living in the bowels of the Earth as the most brutal of savages, feasting on the flesh of their fair counterparts that once were their fellow human beings.\n\nThe thought of feral Norwegians recording a mini-album with no human contact prior, with the savagery of Morlocks, it gives me the chills, and so does the music found on this release. There is no other drummer in metal who's drumming I can describe as \"tribal\" as Manheim's, like the pounding in a death ritual of some rainforest tribe on Borneo. There's a certain marginally off-beat quality to it that makes it sound more like a group of individuals playing one part of the kit each rather than one person playing the kit alone. This tribal feeling is amplified by the heavy use of the toms, as well as the quality of the drum recording which has a strong feel of being done in a dense forest in the middle of nowhere. This really sets the tone for the feeling I described in earlier paragraphs, and it perhaps one of the defining characteristics of this record.\n\nIt is perhaps most fitting that the bass sounds like a form of war drum itself, having a quality more pounding and percussive than you would expect from a string instrument. Rather than a backing provider of melody as you'd find on any regular metal album around the same time in history, it punches the rhythms through your eardrums as if the instrument of a great orc army aiming to pound fear into the hearts of their enemies on the eve of battle.\n\nThe guitars themselves provide all the melody, and they are likely the element of the music most in tune with the analogy of feral children left deep in the forest with only a musical instrument and nothing other but their wits to survive. They grind at you like both the anguish felt by being abandoned and not knowing whether or not you'd survive each new day, and the triumph of having overcome this challenge. They are more than mere metal riffs, they are raw expressions of that raw, feral anger felt by such an abandoned child, and the strength of character it has built through mastering this most hostile of environments. In such a way, they are the most true metal riffs ever written, the most honest, the most brutal, the most unforgiving, and the most triumphant.\n\nVocally we are treated to shrieks and howls which round off the whole experience. Almost like an afterthought, they integrate smoothly into the inhuman inferno unleashed by the instruments they are backing. Like celebrations of the glory of the ritual performed at the hands of these inhuman creatures. It is the combination of all these elements into one grand performance that really matters. Something that transcends anything civilised, anything with the classic understanding of trained musicians in a disciplined environment. This is how music today may sound if all higher culture had never came to exist, and merely the technology for musical instruments had advanced. Music that forgets the last thousands of years of musical development and instead celebrates a ritual of the utmost primitive, and thereby utmost primal.\n\nOf the vague top ten in this review series, this is easily a contender for the top spot. One of the brightest (or darkest) beacons of what metal music is capable. \n\n\n--- Originally written for http://droneriot.blogspot.com\n",
        "\nWe know the Mayhem soap opera by now. The band\u2019s albums beyond \u201cDe Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\u201d are ambitious, but have mostly been overshadowed by the days of the Varg and Dead circus. Chalk up \u201cGrand Declaration of War\u201d as the most underrated album in all the quadrants, methinks, and \u201cChimera\u201d as rock-hard solid. \u201cOrdo ad Chao,\u201d a strange brew of odd rhythms and uncharacteristic black metal structures, sounded welcoming with the return of Attila Csihar, although the record\u2019s strange dynamics make it difficult to appreciate. I find myself polarized when listening to it\u2014amazed yet uninterested, beholden but confused. \u201cEsoteric Warfare\u201d has much in common with \u201cOrdo ad Chao\u201d despite having its own code. While somewhat different structurally, Mayhem\u2019s ability to create a rift remains its lone truth. The dudes clearly have no interest in rehashing any of their prior works, much to the disappointment of the demo-lauding goons, or settling in to a safe niche. \n\n\u201cEsoteric Warfare\u201d is in its own little world\u2014one owned by Mayhem, of course. The big elephant in the room is the departure of Blasphemer, who proved to be an integral part in the band\u2019s creative avenues during his tenor. \u201cEsoteric Warfare\u201d shows no drastic modification from Blasphemer\u2019s exit from the fold, however; little has changed, and it\u2019s clear the newcomers are mostly following his work. Mayhem did not abandon the off-kilter chords and straightforward death/black metal riffs on which latter-day Mayhem thrives, although I will note the biggest issue I have with this is the play-it-safe mentality. Yeah, it\u2019s Mayhem, and yeah, they\u2019re bonkers, but these death/black metal riffs sound like the average squad clocking in at nine and punching out at five. It doesn\u2019t help that Hellhammer, a proficient drummer, spends most of the album ticking away on digitized blasts. Odd sections aside, \u201cEsoteric Warfare\u201d is inoffensively monotonous. \n\nIt\u2019s not as hysterically random and incongruously structured as \u201cOrdo ad Chao,\u201d but it has its moments of inharmonious sensations teetering between the remarkable and the ludicrous. Songs not layered in constant grinding happen to make an impressive mark compared to numbers like \u201cTrinity,\u201d which end up sounding undistinguished. At least \u201cMILAB\u201d and \u201cPosthuman,\u201d the album\u2019s longer anthems featuring medial-paced sections, save the record from becoming an intolerable feat, and while I have no quarrel with the blast-laden parts, they are overused ad nauseam. Necrobutcher\u2019s bass riffs hold a prominent spot in the chaos, but his interesting parts are mostly covered by the huge production, unfortunately. I guess \u201cEsoteric Warfare\u201d feels like a nexus of the ideas of modern Mayhem carved into stone, be it bedlam or the obscured. \n\nAttila sounds like Attila: he gurgles, spits, laughs, shrieks, pukes, growls, does that weird half-moan narrative thing he does, and so much more. As expected, the best part of the album is his performance; his vocal styles, outstanding as usual, end up intermingling with the musical abstractions absurdly well, together forming a kind of dissonance that makes \u201cEsoteric Warfare\u201d nonfigurative, yet tangible. Chances aren\u2019t good critics of his usual recitals won\u2019t find themselves getting bugged shitless by hearing him croon and wail, but hey, do his eccentricities not parallel the world of \u201cEsoteric Warfare\u201d itself? Who else could come remotely close to enriching this band by fronting it, or even challenge the dominance he presents as Mayhem\u2019s vocalist? Not a grenade the run-of-the-mill banshee would jump on.\n\nI know my tone seems to lean more towards the negative side of the spectrum, but that\u2019s because \u201cEsoteric Warfare,\u201d though somewhat acceptable, is too scatterbrained and comes off sounding aimless. I prefer the parts that break up the wearisome blasting sections\u2014the discordant riff in the middle of \u201cPsywar,\u201d the industrial-grade parts of \u201cCorpse of Care,\u201d and the mid-paced \u201cMILAB\u201d come to mind. Well, at the end of the day, Mayhem is doing what Mayhem wants to; the ability to polarize is all that remains. Do I like this? I don\u2019t know. There is much to like, much to dislike, and much that falls to some unknown destination within the huge, abstruse void of \u201cEsoteric Warfare.\u201d \n\nThis review was written for: www.Thrashpit.com\n",
        "\nNot for one moment does this album consider to give you any rest. It's a non-stop wall of furious guitars ripping through the insane and unstable drumming, mixed over Attila Csihar's quite literally guttural vocals. \n\nOpening with a sanity-ceasing track, 'Watchers', it proceeds and progresses into crazier sounds of the songs 'PsyWar' and 'Posthuman', leaving you lost in the said 'wall of sound'. The guitars are technical in terms of black metal with chords scattered around the place, creating dissonance and an evil atmosphere suitable for the genre and the band's original sound. \n\nAtilla's vocals are worrying. Any second you feel like his lungs will burst in the middle of a song for the amount of effort he puts into them is horrific, exploring random techniques to create the most odd and eerie, yet original sound, and is one of the things that really makes this album this memorable. Another feature of this record that doesn't make it too easy to forget is some of the most insane drumming you will ever hear on a black metal record. Hellhammer's double kick is restless. Ripping in batch series or even constantly maintained for minutes, it's guaranteed that it will be one of the first things you'll pick up on in this album. \n\nIt surprises me how Mayhem manage to re-invent themselves within each record, yet remain close to their roots in one way or another. They re-invent themselves image-wise and music-wise and so far, other than 'Chimera', this is their best attempt at taking a risk by stepping in a different direction as a whole. This is a record you don't want to miss out on if you're looking into the more gimmick-ridden, extremely aggressive parts of black metal or even if you're simply looking into the genre itself.\n",
        "\n7 long years have passed since Mayhem\u2019s last full length sweep of decrepit blackened murk \u2018Ordo ad Chao\u2019 hit our speakers, covering listeners in a filthy napalm-like phlegm which ate deeply into the beings of those who were willing to let its dark expanses take hold. Twisted and drenched in its own filth, it was a large step away from the cleanly produced sterility of \u2018Chimera\u2019 before it, the return of Attila to the fold not only allowing his darkly toasted croaks to take the forefront once more, but also seemingly bringing back the unpleasantness in measurements of cubic fuckton.\n\nIt was a huge blow that so soon after what was widely considered to be one of Mayhem's best releases that guitarist Blasphemer decided to step down, some going so far as to begin questioning the bands future (let us not forget that although not part of the \u2018classic\u2019 line up, he was actually a member of Mayhem longer than Euronymous). Upon the announcement that Teloch was the man chosen to fill some of the largest shoes in extreme metal, I had a good feeling that Mayhem\u2019s future was in the right hands (as Nidingr, his other band, released one of my favourite albums of recent years with \u2018Sorrow Infinite and Darkness\u2019).\n\nThe announcement came that the new album \u2018Esoteric Warfare\u2019 was due to drop in 2014, with the 2nd track \u2018PsyWar\u2019 being served up as an aperitif to sate the years worth of hunger for new material. It was a promising beginning, a great song \u2013 but nothing was to prepare me for the sheer brilliance that this album contains. The foggy, sick miasma still pervades like a reoccurring nightmare from \u2018Ordo ad Chao\u2019, but the songs that make up this album seem somehow heartier, thicker and hard hitting in comparison. Perhaps it\u2019s the sheer factor of time working on this album, with every ounce of each members creativity being crystallized into its purist form, with titrated spite, coldness and bile having been fermented and concentrated into an explosion of jagged chords, foaming guitars and inhuman vocals, all bound by an ever shifting and unpredictable human metronome behind the drum kit.\n\nOpening with \u2018Watcher\u2019, you instantly recognise the insignia that is the Mayhem sound, starting with gentle sweeping chords that build quickly into a full battalion of thunderous passages which brim with noxious poison \u2013 it\u2019s remarkable quite how much chaotic Deathspell Omega styled churn there is in Mayhem\u2019s tumultuous musical breadth these days, adding further ugliness to their already turbulent outlook. The album crackles with a foreboding energy, feeding an ever threatening swarm of guitars and drumming into your psyche, punctured only by swathes of melody which colourfully sweep across the monochromatic landscape with vigor. The songwriting pulsates with venomous glee, writhing to its own rhythms. Twisting passages weave serpentine spells, blurring and focusing in turn to confound and disorientate.\n\n\u2018Trinity\u2019 opens with the infamous Oppenheimer quote of \u201cI am become death, the destroyer of worlds\u201d, pounding with a martial refrains, machine gun fire and air raid sirens, it highlights the fact that this is in fact a concept album about esoteric nuclear warfare, and it fits the soundscapes like a bayonet in the face. One of the most noteworthy of things with this album is Attila. His vocals have always been primal, inhuman at times \u2013 but he has truly outdone himself on this release. His vitriol is ever present, barely concealed even in \u2018MILAB\u2019, a track which takes a eerie turn to slower territories and sees his voice seething with a controlled simmer early on, before breaking every chain with some of the most inhuman shrieks and squawks I\u2019ve heard committed to plastic.\n\n\u2018Throne of Time\u2019 reminds very much of \u2018Wolf\u2019s Lair Abyss\u2019, pumping the chill factor up with shimmering discordance and exorcism-born vocals, chiming and ringing to carpet bombed drumming and finger shredding grimy bass work. \u2018Corpse of Care\u2019 and \u2018Posthuman\u2019 continue the tone with a slow churning aura, breaking into sporadic bursts of speed, irrepressibly schizophrenic and unyielding. All this leads into album closer \u2018Aion Suntelia\u2019, packed as it is with spooky alien synth, agitated rhythms and ever disciplined songwriting, building to a satisfactory (albeit, slightly anticlimactic) finish.\n\nMayhem will always have their detractors. Their influence on the Norwegian scene and the 2nd wave of black metal as a whole is as undeniable as the changes in line up and style are polarizing to their fan base old and new. One thing is for sure, \u2018Esoteric Warfare\u2019 exudes quality, and is unmistakably Mayhem. Stubborn and uncaring, yet filled with renewed strength and new beginnings, it embraces Mayhem of old, new and everything in between. Darkly arcane and rapt with a frigid non-indulgence, it marks their 30 years of existence with a monolithic exclamation point.\n\nOriginally written for www.avenoctum.com\n",
        "\nMayhem. The name is synonymous with the second wave of black metal in Norway, their history is often the topic of conversation when black metal comes up, from the suicide of Dead to the murder of Euronymous. Now, thirty years since its humble and dark beginnings in Oslo, the band are releasing their fifth album, entitled 'Esoteric Warfare'.\n\nFans of the bands last release 'Ordo Ad Chao' will enjoy this album, as it continues with the direction that was undertaken in that album. The overall theme is one of a progressive black metal direction. Whilst not as prevalent as on that last album, it is still a large part of the song writing on this album, and part of what makes this album as spectacular as it is. The writing creates a unique atmosphere, one that is eerie, chilling and yet draws you in and is immensely addictive. The guitars, bass, drums and vocals all combine to create an immense sound wall that hits the listener all at once and continues till the albums end.\n\nThe guitar part on this is fantastically crafted, new guitarist Teloch does a great job of filling in the massive shoes of Blasphemer. His lines are all at once atmospheric and aggressive, doing a great job of balancing the progressive side with the black metal, moving from dissonant chordal progressions to fast tremolo picked lines, whilst never sacrificing the atmosphere. The progressions never sound like a forced change, everything evolves perfectly, the songs develop and flow brilliantly, as seen on 'Psywar'. The shame here is the lack of solos, it would be great to hear Teloch let loose some solos, but the songs don't suffer without this. The drums, handled by the immensely talented Hellhammer are fantastic, going between the typical black metal double bass batteries to complex technical drum patterns. The man seems like a machine, never tiring and never missing a beat. The bass doesn't have much high time on the album, but it has moments where it shines, but tends to be amongst the mix.\n\nThe highlight of the album though is Attila's vocals. He's known for making a variety of different sounds and vocal displays on Mayhem albums, but on this album he takes it to a new level, utilizing more typical black metal screams alongside eerie growls, whispers, high shrieks, gurgles and clean chanting. Listen to 'Corpse of Care' for a good display of this. His voice compliments the music, just as the music compliments his voice, combining to make this album head and shoulders above what it would be with any other vocalist. His voice creates eerie atmospheres and makes the album the atmospheric masterpiece it is. The lyrics in this album mainly focus around mind control and its use in warfare, a good topic that differs from the stereotypical black metal themes.\n\nThis album is a fantastic display of progressive black metal and in my opinion, the second best Mayhem album after De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas. Anyone who is a fan of Mayhem's last album, or black metal in general should definitely add this to their listening list.\n\nOriginally posted on: http://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/62750/Mayhem-Esoteric-Warfare/\n",
        "\nIf you don't like this album - you don't like black metal at all. Sounds controversial? Maybe, but in my humble opinion Mayhem's first full-length is the milestone of black metal along with a few other masterpieces like \"Under a Funeral Moon\", \"Hvis Lyset Tar Oss\", \"Nemesis Divina\" and legendary Bathory's \"Under The Sign Of The Black Mark\". They all have that what real black metal is - cold, grim and evil atmosphere that is intensified by raw lo-fi production.\n\nBefore I discovered Mayhem I didn't listen to much black metal. Around early 1998 I was into thrash and death metal mostly. One day I read in some metal magazine about a legendary group in which one guy committed suicide and guitarist was murdered by the other black metal musician. Next day I asked a guy in a local heavy metal store about Mayhem and which album is the best. He told me that the one and only release that I need is \"De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\". Period. So I bought it...\n\nIn the first seconds of the opening song and I was shocked because I have never heard something like this. The sound was great in every aspect although it was little bit unpolished. What I love in this album is a drums. They're quite loud but clear and have organic, natural sound. Hellhammer did great job here. He is fast but very skilled, at least in black metal stage at that time. Guitars are rather typical for this genre - cold as ice, dark, almost out of this human world. The bass parts are audible so you can hear emphasizing some phrases. Most controversial thing on DMDS are vocals. They divide fans for those who love or hate them. Well, as you can conclude from my album rating, I adore Attila's voice here. This Hungarian demon has a very wide scale of singing because he use screams, howls, roars, whispers and long phrasing to create creepy and weird mood. Sometimes his voice sound like a monologue of a possessed preacher. This is almost a black metal opera. Incredible. Sure, I simply love vocals of other BM legends like Nocturno Culto, Varg Vikernes, Satyr or Abbath but Attila with his work on DMDS will be always my number one.\n\nEvery song here is great and has unique vibe. First two, \"Funeral Fog\" and \"Freezing Moon\" are probably most well known. They're like almost a black metal hits. I had a good time when my friends sang quotes like \"It's night again, night you beautiful...\" when we were drinking vodka by the bonfire in the deep, dark forest. Another highlight is \"Life Eternal\", the slowest one, at least in main part. When Attila sings about misery of life and triumph of death I'm thinking about Dead and his dreams about journeys to another world. Brilliant \"Buried by Time and Dust\" is the fastest and shortest song. Hellhammer did an excellent job here. He starts really fast but in the middle of the song his playing goes faster than before. Like a human machine gun. The final title track is the most mysterious and astonishing because of Attila's soprano-like declamations in Latin. You can almost feel unique atmosphere of some satanic rite in the old ruins.\n\nMayhem created a black metal masterpiece - very consistent, heartfelt, original and climatic. Also that album's cover with church hidden in the dark is announcing dark, gloomy and murky music. You can feel the stench of fresh opened grave. Unfortunately, Mayhem's potential and talent died with Euronymous. This is true as true Mayhem without Euronymous is dead.\n",
        "\nThe usurpers/copyright holders of the Mayhem brand are back again to further tarnish the legacy of the pre-focus groups and facebook era by shitting forth this latest abomination, entitled \"Esoteric Warfare\". After hearing the early 90's Tampa death metal riffing followed by the Sonic the Hedgehog level theme middle section from lead single Psywar, I was assured that there was going to be nothing esoteric or threatening about this release. Underneath the waves of clicking noises (drums) and tinny ceiling fan noise (guitars) over what I assume is Attila trying to pass a kidney stone in the background (vocals that are more obnoxious than previous performances), one can hear how inconsequential this release is in it's dearth of artistry or depth. This isn't Mayhem. This is \"The True Mayhem\u2122\", a band more focused on posting backstage drinking antics to the mobile uploads folder of their facebook profile than they are on music.\n\nWhile previous \"The True Mayhem\u2122\" releases Wolf's Lair Abyss and Grand Declaration of War were vapid media products released under the Mayhem brand, they at least showed that the band had the aptitude to fit in with the then current crop of Moonfog commercial black metal vapidity peddlers like Satyricon or Dodheimsgard. Here, I don't know why the band even bothered with recording this album or what they are attempting to accomplish with it (other than make money). Pseudo-black metal of the needlessly discordant variety similar to the Thorns full-length, and by that I mean that it's mostly foot tapping (when not blasting) mechanical rhythm riffs (similar to death metal) given a black metal garnish in the form of those minor chords and \"ringing arpeggios\" people typically associate with the genre. Songs are arranged in no logical sequence, going from random riff to random riff in a random order with incongruous tempo breaks all throughout. No effort was put into making these songs work.\n\nThis album is one-dimensional in the sense that if you've heard the singles Psywar and MILAB, you basically heard the rest of the album. Constant unnecessary detours, fast/slow change ups (plodding boredom to blasting pseudo-black) and random song conclusions show that Mayhem had no idea where to take any one idea. So, they took basic rudimentary \"extreme\" metal riff forms and gave them a surface level makeover to sound \"weird\" (that minor chord/arpeggio trick they use at the end of 95% of the riffs), hoping people would think it was \"different and unique\". Lyrics that show a fraction of the imagination of even the late 90's Maniac fronted releases show further vacuity. Songs are more rooted in social/psychological musings in Marvel Comics meme form than anything esoteric and the easy to grasp imagery ensures that no one is left scratching their head (lowest common denominator is where the big bucks are it seems).\n\nListen to an early 90's Norwegian black metal release and support good music instead. Purchasing this rubbish will only show that this \"The True Mayhem\u2122\" entity can further dumb down their music until even the new guy can afford spandex, fishnet mesh shirts, and trips to a beard stylist (look at the promo pics). Avoid this vapid trash at all cost.\n",
        "\nEsoteric Warfare is an interesting amendment to the Mayhem canon, a valiant effort to bridge the suppressed atmospheres of its predecessor Ordo ad Chao with the razor hewn traditional Norse black metal riffing the band helped pioneer through seminal works like De Mysteriis dom Sathanas and Grand Declaration of War, or perhaps most accurately the Wolf's Lair Abyss EP that so many seem to forget about. To that extent, I would consider it a mission accomplished, only with the caveat that I ended up finding one half of the equation a lot more compelling than the other. This is very likely my least favorite of the band's full-length works, but it does what a Mayhem outing should: dowse you in its evil clutches and remind you exactly who your Daddy is. And that's fucking Satan, if you have to ask.\n\nBut here, through Esoteric Warfare, the Norwegians channel the author of all sin through a curiously nuclear/dystopian theme which pervades the lyrics and artwork, like this unholy union of the Cold War and their creepy occult roots. It's hands down the most fascinating component of the record as a whole, followed by Attila Csihar's performance, in which he's whispering, mouth breathing, gargling, growling and otherwise sounding like his basic, decrepit, creaking-wooden-stairs self. Generally his more resonant and catchy lines come during segues from the faster action, and this is where I found a little disparity in the quality of what I was hearing. The muted, tremolo picked black/death patterns which drive the ferocity of the effort are sort of a bland strain of earlier Mayhem (Chimera, Wolf's Lair Abyss) with classic Morbid Angel, punctured and punctuated by slices of brighter, dissonant chords and partial arpeggios that were common fare for much of the Scandinavian black metal output of the mid through later 90s, or a faint few zipping, hypnotic lines cut through that remind me of the German band Endstille. Emperor and Satyricon also come to mind, but more directly these guitar progressions paired with the caustic, mechanical nature of the songwriting evoke Snorre W. Ruch of Thorns, Aborym, or Dodheimsgard's guitars in the techno-infused 666 International.\n\nThat's far from an unwelcome aesthetic, but unfortunately so many of the patterns just whip into the first frenzied patterns the guy can seemingly slide across on the fretboard, without much thought put into anything, and they become increasingly predictable as a footnote for an intense, agile Hellhammer performance which I found infinitely more interesting just on its own. Granted, the abbreviated leads and the higher range chords often sound efficaciously malevolent, and oftentimes clinical enough to match the album's lyrical style, but I'll be damned it there were more than a handful of fingers worth of rhythm guitars on the entire experience that I wasn't bored with. Most are just too predictable, and it gets to the point that even the primal, slow chugging in a tune like the unusual \"MILAB\" grows even more fresh on the ear. Speaking of which, that is one of my easiest favorites on the album, with its spidery bass lines, dissonant and disheveled architecture and really grasping the full range of Csihar's vile, filth smeared, unique presence, and ditto for \"Posthuman\", which captures an almost minimalist Voivodian atmosphere (not the only case here) until the noisy blast breaks; suitable for an album that many might describe as PostMayhem.\n\nSo I was really leaning towards these less structured moments on the album, and whenever they burst into another stock deathened black riff I just found myself phasing out. Maybe this was intentional, or maybe it's that the new guitarist Teloch was channeling a bit too much of his alma mater Nidingr, which has long thrived on this very same style of riffing, sometimes to its detriment. Either way, it gradually de-escalated my initial appreciation for the record's grimy intensity to levels of a more lukewarm reception. The production here is also pretty threadbare and dry sounding, which on the one hand makes much of the procession clear to the ear, but on the other doesn't exactly help give the rather averagely scripted rhythm guitars much meat or impact. I liked most of the lyrics (except perhaps \"Pandaemon\" which is just a shopping list/incantation of the names of various devils, demons and idols through religious mythology), and Csihar is just all over this, truly the Mike Patton of black metal. But apart from the themes and the potential of what Mayhem might have created within this wasteland of post-apocalyptic vision, I only ever found myself semi-satisfied. Never truly impressed.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nFrom the first notes of that familiar guitar tone (sans Euronymous' unearthly presence), you just know Mayhem is somewhere in your earshot. While I personally was reluctant, even fearful of hearing the latest record Esoteric Warfare I was 'emotionally' drawn to it. I go back with Mayhem's music over 20-years, and since I'm one of the few people that wasn't horrified and offended by the band's last effort, Ordo ad Chao, I felt it was in the cards for me to at least be somewhat impressed with the latest one. At least that was my hope.\n\nSo how is this latest effort from Norway's once-feared sons? Well, it's a definite grower, and once sprouted you'll really love it if your mind is set to, that is. Citing the indelible notion that nothing on this planet or any other will ever surpass De Mysteriis dom Sathanas, it's reasonable to realize that the band that created that masterpiece is long gone and this new, revamped Mayhem is what's here to stay. By no means is this a detriment or a 'settle-for' entropy; the band is solid with Atilla back at the vocal helm, and his presence on the new release is welcome and as chaotic as I'd hoped. That familiar growling rasp in the single \"Psywar\" is a definitive piece to the Mayhem puzzle that was sorely missing during Maniac's mundane return. Atilla took a lot of unwarranted guff for his vocals back in 1994, and to this day I'll never understand that because, in my humble opinion, that performance and the Silencer Death, Pierce Me effort are two of the most horrifying performances committed to metal tape. That said, Atilla's undeniable and irreplaceable presence here makes this music as violent and tempestuous as it should be.\n\nThis is a less evil and dark Mayhem, an observance sure to bother and confuse the latecomers and hangers on, but the satanic spirit gives way to a larger focus on the assault on the mind and the lack of control the individual has in such matters. For me, this is a much more accessible topic than the 'evil-church-burning- post-mortem-picture-taking, murdered' image that the band has cultivated, willingly or unwillingly, over the last two decades. Dare I say that this Mayhem is widely more cerebral? This album is a jaunt through the horrors of the mind, the lack of control within those chambers, and the total submission of personal will to the grand designers pulling the strings of the sheep. The lyrics, teamed with Atilla's up-and-down vocal shrieks and monotone whispering, are the perfect vehicle for setting the stage for this truly cerebral undertaking. I don't believe I'm overstating the notion that fringe players, kiddies and general folks not versed in Mayhem's players will never truly embrace this album. It taps into the recesses of the mind in such a way that its perfection lay nestled in its simplistic delivery and complicated arrangement. There is a paradox of emotions and ideas all over this collective, and upon a third listen I am totally engulfed in the greatness of it all. When you hear Atilla whisper or issue that trademark low summoning, I feel the agony of an exhaustive tug-of-war, only to be forced back into a mental skirmish when his screams and wailing set the stage for more irrational and frightening entanglements. When Mayhem went into this record attempting to jolt the listener into thinking outside the comfortable self-fashioned bubble of ignorance, they fashioned a provocative gem, dull and dusty with fear and weakness. \n\nGuitarist Teloch does a great job living up to the ghosts that surely follow him, and while that cherished period of Mayhem is long lost to arrogance and the whim of a narcissist he need not apologize to anyone, living or dead. The band does its job perfectly, creating a spacious chasm of wonder wrapped neatly in a crevice of despair and self-degradation that is always part and parcel with individual servitude. Esoteric Warfare is the album your heart and stomach find a perfect stimuli for your musical needs, while the mind delves deeper to its core and sees the horror of your personal subjugation. It's more of a musical blueprint for all that is uneven and amiss in your head.\n\nFor those able to ingest such depressing and diseased pictures, this album will no doubt complete your personal visuals. You may never be the same, and you can relish this thought while wondering who and what you are in the world.\n\n(Originally written for www.metalpsalter.com)\n",
        "\nMayhem needs no introduction, they've been around for 30 years now and they've changed the face of metal with their releases over the years. And here we are with the newest Mayhem album \"Esoteric Warfare\", and holy shit is this one wild! Mayhem have become known (even infamous) for their constant experimentation with the black metal sound on each of their albums. Even the debut featured vocals that were very different from the usual black metal sound, and this one is no different.\n\nOne of my favorite things about \"Esoteric Warfare\" is it's ability to blend the styles of just about every Mayhem album out there, while still maintaining it's own unique sound that sets it apart from the rest of their discography. The first song off the album \"Watcher\" reminds me of a refined, even more evil and maniacal version of \"Deathcrush\", especially in the chorus (thanks in art to Attila's blood chilling screams and shrieks). Other songs throughout have this feeling as well (\"Pandaemon\", \"PsyWar\"), and other songs reflect on their other releases as well. Many songs remind me of \"Ordo Ad Chao\". This you can hear in every song on the album to some extent, usually VIA the bizarre and off kilter riffs, the atonal segments and the experimentation with song structures throughout. Hell, moments of the song \"Corpse Of Care\" remind me very heavily of the song \"Deconsecrate\" off \"Ordo\", especially the vocals in moments. But don't misunderstand, Mayhem manages to blend their uncanny ability to mix their discography in with these new, different sounds (almost certainly thanks to the addition of the badass new guitarist Teloch). You can hear this most notably in songs like \"Vi Sec\", \"Milab\" and \"Posthuman\", these songs seem to carry a very dissonant and atonal kind of doom vibe going on, it almost in a way reminds me of the slow sections on the first two Bethlehem albums, except far more evil sounding. It's a very interesting album, you can point out the influences from previous albums all over, and you can also point out the new influences brought in from Teloch and Atiila very easily and they're all blended together in a way where they sound very organic working and moving as a single piece of music.\n\nI need to mention the band members contributions here, every member plays a very important role, each doing their part to make \"Esoteric Warfare\" one of Mayhem's all time best albums. Attila's vocals here are amazing! His vocals have a lot more of the old school black metal stylings reflected in them, his shrieks are fucking brilliant! They really add to this obscure, oppressive atmosphere that \"Esoteric Warfare\" seems to be drenched in. His range is remarkable too, he goes from the black metal shrieks to some awesome and crushing low vocals, to his abstract crooning (VIA De Mysteriis dom Sathanas) and some other bizarre hissing/croaking sounds that are pretty much something that can only come from Attila's mouth. Hellhammer really does an amazing job here too. He keeps changing up his style, it's really cool. His cymbal play is incredible, especially during the slower segments. Hs blastbeats are on point, not a single hit is ever behind or lacking in power, it's truly remarkable. \n\nNecrobutcher really outdoes himself here too. \"Posthuman\" and \"Milab\" both feature really badass bass riffs, the it's very atmospheric and hearing how awesome the bass sounds on here really makes you wish that it were a little louder in the mix for the other songs. (which is legitimately the only reason why I don't feel comfortable giving it a 100) And finally I need to bring up Teloch the newest member of Mayhem. This is his first album with the band and I truly hope he's around for many, many more. Teloch's riffs are amazing, they're dissonant, they're evil, they're brooding and they create the most oppressive atmosphere i've ever heard in a Mayhem album. Strangely enough the atmosphere that is brought up by these riffs and songs remind me of the movie \"Event Horizon\" which I find to be really awesome (Event Horizon is one of my favorite big budget films). Hell even the band hints at that movies influence on the album by titling one of the bonus tracks \"Into The Event Horizon\", which leaves be with very little doubt as to whether or not it's an influence there. Whoops, went off on a bit of tangent there haha, sorry guys. Anyways, Teloch fits the band really well, his riffs are atonal, brooding and complex, all while stylistically sticking 100% to the black metal sound, which I think is amazing personally, his ability to link together these riffs is borderline uncanny, I do kind of wish he had included a solo or two in there, but you don't really see those very often in black metal either way so it's not a major disappointment or anything.\n\nNow the greatest thing about this album by far is that fact that literally every song is fantastic, it's almost impossible for me to pick a favorite track, they all rival each other in their complexity, transitions and atmosphere. There is not a single wear track on here, even the bonus tracks stand out on their own merits. The bonus track on my copy of the album is \"Into The Lifeless\" which is a fucking great song, I feel like both that one and \"Into The event Horizon\" should've been left on as normal album tracks because they are really intense songs, especially for being bonus songs. \"Into The Event Horizon\" is (I think) a Japanese exclusive track, which sucks because I would love to own it on CD one day. It's probably one of the best songs in the album, with it's badass 2 minute buildup to a riff and blast beat frenzy that is chock full of that oppressive atmosphere Mayhem seems to have crafted specifically for this release. I'd personally recommend this album to anyone, people who love all eras of Mayhem, people who only listen to the demos, people who only listen to the last few records, every single type of Mayhem fan out there is 100% certainly going to find something to love off this record, and It's a damn shame that people are writing it off simply because \"Mayhem are past their prime\", because anyone who thinks that is a very, very bold moron. \n\nStandout tracks to check out (just in case you're not 100% sold): \"Watcher\", \"VI Sec\", \"Milab\", \"Posthuman\" and \"Into The Event Horizon\"\n",
        "\nMayhem, being the beacon and archetype of black metal in the 1990's, set a high standard for all of their releases to come. But after assigning such specific attributes to their brand of black metal, and attaining incredibly high expectations from their fans, they completely changed the game, and refused to write music in a way that would allow them to be measured by those standards. Every Mayhem album since 2000's Grand Deceleration of War has been met with ambiguous reception. Complaints went from being too experimental, to being too overproduced, to being too dissonant. While I've had a favoring attitude towards the last three Mayhem albums, I must finally admit to coming up with some honest criticism of Esoteric Warfare: it's too safe.\n\nSafe is an unfortunate word to give a band that's been rapidly changing styles for so long. Because I had expectation of being taken aback, not only by the riffs, but the style of music being played, I was rather let down to hear for myself that the album sits happily in between the two prior releases, Chimera from 2004, and Ordo Ad Chao, from 2007. Now, I love both of these albums, to death, but perhaps living the best of both worlds wasn't in Mayhem's best interests. The thing is, Esoteric Warfare takes pointers from both of those albums, and tries to accommodate everything without pushing the envelope one any one direction. It lacks the brutally disjointed, but headbangable riffs from Chimera, and the dark meandering trails in the forsaken realms of Ordo Ad Chao. The composition style, drumming patterns, and...humanish noises haven't really developed at all since we last heard them. The best I can say about this album is that it's another Mayhem album...Mayhem never just puts out another album.\n\nThe other gripe I have with this Esoteric Warfare is its presentation. Some ideas in the album's artwork, song titles, and lyrics are clich\u00e9d. \u201cNow I am become death, the destroyer of worlds\u201d...didn't we already hear that on an Aborym album? I don't know how much participation Attila had in deciding what went on Esoteric Warfare, but I'm inclined to believe that due to this sample, and a number of surprisingly industrial sounding lyrics and aesthetics, that his presence was felt here. And this shouldn't be a problem, because Attila has a legacy that matches the mystique of a band like Mayhem, but unfortunately, it really doesn't feel like a Mayhem album. Despite the drastic changes in sound and style over the years, the band still managed to take us emotionally into spaces of discomfort, and fear. With Satanism, mysticism, and hatred as typical themes, it's hard not to be awed by the attitude alone of a veteran black metal band. But since these concepts have been abandoned, they closely resemble most of the generic extreme metal bands putting out music today. And yes, I know that Satanism, mysticism, and hatred are already clich\u00e9 ideas for black metal, but I'd rather hear an intense and dangerous hatred coming from a classic band than hear said band try and fit into some really new style. Had you taken off the Mayhem logo and presented this album to me as a debut from a new American black metal, I probably wouldn't have second guessed it.\n\nWhat's good here is that Mayhem is still a bonafide black metal band. They're still heavy, they're as technical as ever, and they're still ripping through the tremolo picking and blast beats. But that's only a small part of the formula to success you see. An element of creativity must also exist, and I am both surprised and disappointed to say that Mayhem have finally missed the mark in this category.\n\nWritten for Papasfritasreviews\n",
        "\nI can never quite decide where Mayhem fit into the grand scheme of my musical taste. Sometimes, I feel that my listening was saturated by their music all too soon, as I listened to them a lot when I was getting into black-metal. At other times, I look upon them as a band which I legitimately under-appreciate; I can't remember, for instance, the last time I really sat and listened to one of their classics; De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas, namely - instead constantly leaning towards other albums by their peers, much in the way that I haven't listened to an album like Master of Puppets in years, despite its massive status. Nonetheless, I can certainly be considered interested when Mayhem announce a new album, and Esoteric Warfare, their first in seven years, is the first time that Mayhem have infiltrated the top-tier of my musical attention in quite a while.\n\nThe opening notes of the album set the tone for the rest very concisely. Dissonant, cataclysmic and oppressive - cold, inorganic, seeping unforgiving nihilism like so much radioactive waste. The artwork for the record genuinely paints a picture - pardon the pun - of the album's sound in this respect; it is black-metal infused with cold, metallic ominousness; music not of forests and mountains, but of bunkers, and the secluded work of nuclear armament. The record is immensely foreboding and hostile. Esoteric Warfare represents a progression of this style, which the band seem to have landed upon in its predecessor, Ordo Ad Chao. Despite being quite inspired, that album was a challenging listen owing to its production, which, deliberate or not, rendered the album a \"well organised collection of rumbles\" - the music demanded an almost exceptional amount of scrutiny and careful listening to glean pleasure from it. Esoteric Warfare retains the atmosphere for which Ordo Ad Chao was most praised, whilst having room to breathe; you can hear what's going on much more easily, which is a godsend. Granted, the murk remains, but much more carefully measured, and induced not by production, but by the musicianship itself, with a wall of harsh, mechanical noise punctuated by screeching, squealing guitar dissonance, like a tumble through the bowls of some vast industrial complex, made all the more harrowing and engaging by the records unapologetic quirky structure, with pauses and bursts of energy which jerk the music around ferociously, placed at times, where you don't expect them at all.\n\nOver the top of this assault, Attila delivers a typically absorbing vocal-performance, roaring, screaming, and delivering his trademark low, growling chants. His vocal approach is one which very much suits the direction in which the record heads - a traditional black-metal vocalist would have felt out of place on this, which is, after all, certainly not a traditional black-metal record - Attila's style compliments it perfectly. Indeed, Esoteric Warfare is a prime example of the fact that Mayhem have never made the same record twice; even with its similarities to Ordo Ad Chao in mind, the record, in its uncoiling, reveals itself to be a very different beast. Granted, this ever changing style leaves Mayhem as a band who possess no sure \"string\" of classics in the way that many of their peers do - instead leaving each album as an island, but likewise, it's almost impossible to deny that, for better or worse, Mayhem have never created a record which wasn't interesting, and this one is no exception - in fact, it feels among their best formed and most sonically rewarding works in a long time. At the moment, I'm tempted to weigh-it-in as being their best work since De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas, although I'm going to wait until the initial elevated mood of listening to a new album subsides before I call in such a judgement for good. Nevertheless, Esoteric Warfare is the first Mayhem album which has deeply impressed me upon discovering it, the only other being the Deathcrush EP - both of which I listened to and was impressed above and beyond the normal mental-hubbub of listening to a record.\n\nOf course Mayhem haven't made \"De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas - Part II\" - and I think for the most part hoping for such is naive, and even closed minded. Why should Mayhem create a record in the old style? A style which they helped to pioneer, but which has since, nonetheless, been adopted by a multitude of bands. It's worth remembering that at the time, Mayhem were creating something which very, very few were creating - and in this respect, this record harkens back to that; it is very different from their early work, musically, of course, but it is a return to the creation of music which very few others are creating, and it is within that sphere which the band seem to thrive. It's very clear, at this point, that Mayhem are a band who are creating the music which they want to create, and when records like Esoteric Warfare are delivered to us, we can be very glad of that indeed.\n\nOriginally posted on my reviews blog at heavymetalspotlight.blogspot.com\n",
        "\nEveryone must surely know the Mayhem back story by now so I\u2019m not going to try and outline it here but suffice to say for many reading this on Rockfreaks.net it probably dwarfs their knowledge of the band\u2019s music, even their \u00fcber-classic \u201cDe Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\u201d. Given that somewhat difficult past \u201cEsoteric Warfare\u201d marks only their fifth full length in the 30-year career of Norway\u2019s hugely controversial Mayhem and comes seven years after the strongly diverse \u201cOrdo ad Chao\u201d. The timespan between each record has allowed for each LP to retain a unique identity with the differences between each present through changing line-ups, production styles and song structures but throughout all Mayhem have never ceased to be a challenging black metal act true to the genre\u2019s fiery birth.\n\n\u201cEsoteric Warfare\u201d is for the most part a hyper-speed lo-fi album with little in the way of colour to mix the palette of highly strung layered guitars, Hellhammer\u2019s bombastic clattering and Attila Chisar\u2019s impressive range of vocal styles. The absence of guitarist Blasphemer, the writer of much of the band\u2019s recent era material, is keenly felt in the lack of dynamics that stretch across the whole album as the mid-level tone of his replacement Teloch just doesn\u2019t talk with the same vengeance as his predecessor. Add to this the riffs and patterns in the album\u2019s construction: things get off to a flying start with \u201cPsyWar\u201d and \u201cTrinity\u201d which both hurtle off the line at an impressive rate of knots but without giving the impression that they are truly heading to the level of greatness the Mayhem rests upon. By no means are they bad, but I would like to hear a bit more ingenuity in their composition, even if they are being played at 100mph as is the case. In fairness to Teloch the flattened production values, which at times remind me of Death\u2019s \u201cHuman\u201d in the way all instruments are squeezed together with only the odd chord notation breaking out from the breaches, offers little help in exploding these songs out from my speakers as I\u2019d like.\n\n\u201cPandaemon\u201d marks the first significant variation in rhythm as the choppy staccato tempos first truly enter the fray before they soon loom large across the landscape. It is all very impressive how the trio of Hellhammer, Teloch and Necrobutcher (bass) curtail their explosive performances with telescopic precision before realigning with the accuracy of a Swiss watch although I would be interested to hear how this works live. While the fast moments reveal the dominance of Hellhammer\u2019s percussion in the mix, especially his very clicky double bass drum sound, the slower turns push Attila out front and too much over Teloch in \u201cMILAB\u201d. Attila\u2019s display is, as usual, theatric - I can only think of Akercocke\u2019s Jason Mendon\u00e7a as a rival to the man\u2019s mixture of throat singing, deep growls and punishing screams, often all within the same song, which always leave the listener guessing as to how he will adapt for each upcoming section.\n\nIn \u201cVI.Sec.\u201d Teloch pieces together some of his tightest moments across the record as the track marks a point in which progress takes more varied turns, leading into a bleak \u201cThrone of Time\u201d before \u201cCorpse of Care\u201d and notably \u201cPosthuman\u201d offer breathing space from the artillery barrage to step up on the discordance which has always been threatening to break through. As the record closes off with \u201cAion Suntalia\u201d, notable for the minor psychedelic pattern interwoven with the leads and Attila\u2019s strangled screams, and the nuclear-charged power of \u201cWatchers\u201d, the draw closes on another difficult, yet rewarding Mayhem experience. Only comparisons to \u201cOrdo ah Chao\u201d are valid within this discography and I miss the greater diversity in toning and handling of the slower sections which that record brings, although \u201cEsoteric Warfare\u201d offers plenty for black metal fans with a penchant for speed over the more subtle atmospheres I personally prefer. This is a grey dreary landscape of thunderbolt tempos and pulsating percussion designed to decimate through any barrier of the kind Mayhem have been serving up for decades: it\u2019s good to have them back.\n\nOriginally written for www.Rockfreaks.net\n",
        "\nA couple of years ago I made a review about their previous effort which was their best ever since their debut album (screw Deathcrush). Since the release of Ordo ad Chao it has been...7 long years! I have to admit that not many bands spend so much time between albums. Anybody can give an example of a band that took a very long time before releasing a new offering, but then again Mayhem has always been the kind of group that would just tour heavily and record less. As such, this is the 5th album in...almost 30 years of existence? Yes, indeed!\n\nThose who liked Ordo ad Chao (including myself) will be delighted to find out that this opus follows a similar line. There is a slight difference though and that is given by the new guitarist, Morten 'Teloch' Iversen, a name known in the metal realm for his contributions and performances in Nidingir, Gorgoroth, God Seed or 1349 (live performer or guest member). Another minor detail stands in regards of production quality. Esoteric Warfare is a better produced album, but the superior production quality does not undermine that sinister atmosphere that was present on Ordo ad Chao. I might also say that the band adopted some influences from Chimera and slightly from Snorre Ruch's band, Thorns. It gives an industrial aura from the beginning until the end, however, it is scarce and can barely be audible. The guitar play that Teloch employs is very dissonant and it manages to carry on the legacy left behind by Blasphemer to a certain degree.\n\nMayhem is one of those bands that no matter how long you wait for them to release new material you won't be disappointed and the same issue applies for Esoteric Warfare as well. They also seem to keep the tradition of not making the same album twice pretty much alive. I do not know if this is the product of the many line-up changes within the band, but I do believe that the overall creative department that this band possesses is just remarkable. This new offering, while it is built on the skeleton of the previous output, does try to be unique on its own and it does succeed.\n\nFurthermore, while in terms of song-writing you just can't complain about a sort-of lack of professionalism from the band, I do have to admit that they perform pretty tight on this record. Especially Attila. With this record I do believe that Attila basically slapped hard the part of the fan-base that still misses Dead or even Maniac. He proves that if he wants to, he can sound like any other black metal vocalist while still retaining that part of his vocal range that gives an experimental aspect to every album he contributed. On Esoteric Warfare, Attila mostly uses shrieks and snarls rather than the droney vocals he used on the debut record or even on Ordo ad Chao. It is enough to listen to the opening track, \"Watcher\" or the follow-up, \"Psywar\" to be convinced that Attila means serious business this time. Check out the hellish screams throughout the track Watcher and you will be convinced that this guy is probably the most capable and unique vocalist the black metal scene ever gave.\n\nAs for the other members, you cannot end a review without talking a little bit about one of the best drummers the black metal scene ever gave, Jan Axel 'Hellhammer' Bloomberg. This guy remains the same drum machine as he was in the past. The drum machine comparison is not exaggerated at all. Check out \"Trinity\" to be convinced. Even though he is not in this 20s anymore, time does not seem to hinder Hellhammer at all. He also proves that when required, he can be technical too (\"Throne of Time\", \"Aion Suntelia\"). As for J\u00f8rn \"Necrobutcher\" Stubberud, though I never really felt that this guy has an important contribution in this band, he remains the same subtle bassist he was in the past. You have to concentrate a little bit to hear his bass lines, but if you do catch a glimpse of them, you will realize that they do have their own role to play throughout this record.\n\nTo end this review, Mayhem is back in top form. 7 years of arduous wait surely brought a high degree of expectations as many viewed them as being a shadow of their former glory, especially after the driving force that contributed decisively on the past 3 records decided to leave in 2008 (yeah, talking about Blasphemer). Teloch though seems to be the right man, at the right time, at the right place. Probably the 7 years wait was not due to the lack of creativity or willingness to record, but was due the band trying to cement their playing style. The record is as evil and obscure as you can get and it caries that Mayhem signature sound that among the over-saturated and ever-changing black metal scene, still remains the most recognizable sound. Mayhem is not only the creator of black metal, but with the subsequent release it also proved that they aim to be an innovator as well.\n",
        "\nA good deal has changed since 2007's offering Ordo Ad Chao. Most noticeably, Rune Blasphemer Eriksen parted ways with Mayhem in 2008. He wrote the music for the band, and in his place Mayhem have hired Morten Teloch Iversen from Nidingr. Other than that, the band is the same. J\u00f8rn Necrobutcher Stubberud on bass, Jan Axel Hellhammer Blomberg on drums, and Attila Csihar on vocals.\n\nThe record begins with recognizable dissonant chords, soon accompanied by machine gun drums. The whole band joins not long afterwards. Attila's vocals are here closer to typical black metal vocals than they've ever been, without that being a bad thing. He pulls it off very good. Actually, Attila's vocals is one of the records highlight. His vocal lines are intricate, and he utilizes many different styles. Inhales, exhales, drones, and he masters all of them quite well. The record plays on the same kind of \"alien\" song structure presented on Ordo Ad Chao, but in this instance it sounds rather more \"solid\". I was not a big fan of the last records' lack of something to grab onto musically, but here there's actually sections in which Mayhem downright groove. \"Melodically\", it's still the same dissonant overtones and intervals that you have to expect. Tritone isn't used terribly much, but chromatic intervals are in a vast abundance. As a result, the music can be predictable (even with its unorthodox, \"random\" structures).\n\nIn summary, Esoteric Warfare is a more accessible experience strictly musically speaking, and every member of the band is brilliant in their own right. I still have to drag my judgment slightly down, as I feel that Teloch writes better in Nidingr. Of course, I understand that he can't simply write a Nidingr-song for Mayhem, but I don't believe he's realized his full potential with Mayhem yet. (On the Psywar single is a song from the Budapest sessions in 2012; I actually think that song is better than some of the songs on display here.)\n\n\nHighlights: Milab, Corpse of Care, Trinity, Aion Suntelia.\n",
        "\nHey, kids! Ever wondered what \"Deathcrush\" would sound like if you threw a cassette of it into a clogged toilet, let it sit for a few days, took it out, dried it next to an open fire, took a piss on it, then played it back at half speed while wiggling your finger on the play button? Now I'm not sure how that would sound either, but my guess is......A LOT BETTER THAN THIS FUCKING SHIT!!!!!!\n\nNow before I tear this album a new hole, I'd like to address all of the butthurt fans crying out in sorrow, \"but Thrashterpiece! It's a demo! It's not supposed to sound good, it's supposed to sound br00tal and kvlt!\" Bull-fucking-SHIT! Almost every other demo I've heard in my entire tenure as a metal fan sounds 9,000+ times better than this. Sure, they usually sound like they were recorded in a fucking garage, but at least you could still hear what was going on. Not even Hellhammer's early 80s demos sounded this bad. Fucking hell, even full-lengths from bands like Bathory, Napalm Death, S.O.B., Cryptic Slaughter, Wehrmacht, or any number of 90s black metal bands are albums that are SUPPOSED to sound like ugly, mindless noise and all have infinitely better production quality than this hunk of horse shit.\n\nBut you see, those bands can get away with it because they use this so-called \"mindless noise\" to their advantage; they use the sub-par production value to give their albums a certain atmosphere, whether it be dark and foreboding or brutal and in-your-face. But there's none of that to be found here. Not a single ounce of atmosphere or charm to be found anywhere on this demo. Nope. None. Nada. Zip. Zilch. A big, fat, fucking goose egg.\n\nNow, this would usually be the part where I talk about the band members' performances, but what's the point when the whole demo just sounds like me letting out a nasty, wet fart after eating too much Thai food? Bottom line, every member of the band sounds drunk and/or high on paint thinner; the guitar sounds like ass, the drums sound like shit, the bass sounds like piss, the vocals.....WHAT FUCKING VOCALS? That's pretty much all you need to know.\n\nIn terms of songs, however, I will give this demo ONE iota of credit (yes, this is where the 1% comes from) - while the whole thing pretty much meshes together into 30 minutes of eardrum violation, if you close your eyes and concentrate very, very, VERY carefully, you might be able to kinda-sorta-not-really recognize a few actual SONGS buried beneath the muck. Yes, they are most definitely \"songs\"............I think.\n\nIt honestly wouldn't surprise me if this demo just turned out to be an epic troll, like if Euronymous or some other member of the band recorded their cat walking across a guitar and then tried passing it off as the most \"kvlt as fvck\" demo ever recorded. If anyone wants to hear Mayhem at their rawest and most brutal without crossing over into shit-tier territory, stick with \"Deathcrush.\" Sure, that album is still fast, sloppy, and poorly produced, but it wins by default simply because the songs sound like actual SONGS rather than someone throwing their guitar on the floor and recording the feedback with a handheld tape recorder.\n",
        "\nWhat a significant event in black metal history, is this work of pure crushing darkness, where hateful sentiments are promoted and evil is put on a pedestal for everyone to admire. The genius of those four (mainly) Norwegian maniacs can be admired during every single second of this record. \n\nNorway has been the cradle of many evil creations, such as Mayhem, Immortal, Satyricon, Emperor and the list never seems to end. Spawned by an unforgiving climate of freezing cold weather and depressingly long nights, this album comes as a blow to the inexperienced listener whose sole reason for listening this album is to kill some time while waiting for his mum to cook him dinner. \n\nThis EP is not for the weak and the fragile. After listening to this masterpiece your life will never be the same again. The lyrics just spit misanthropic hate, not just teenage cynicism. The song \"Necrolust\" encapsulates my previous argument in around three minutes. \n\nOkay, so the instrumentation overall was quite simple but simply dark and depressing, which would remain a trademark for Mayhem throughout most of their history. Simplicity is often misjudged as mediocrity but this album couldn't prove such statement more wrong. The song \"(Weird) Manheim\" starts out with a haunting, droning piano passage, which soon turns to a siege of angry pounding drums, fast unforgiving riffs, loud screeching vocals and surprisingly loud bass. Such an impressive feat in an otherwise mostly mundane genre cannot be quite considered as mediocre. \n\nThe song \"Deathcrush\" contains everything that this EP contains in a nutshell, providing the listener with three minutes of pure mentally deranged musical creation which causes the listener to question the metal health of the musicians behind this. Another song, which puts the question of whether the musicians behind this EP are sane or not back on the table, is the outro, one of the most ironic experiments which have been done throughout human history. The song contains quite sugar coated lyrics, hoping that the listener is happy and that's when the irony comes in. After listening to such a record the listener simply can't feel happy, unless he lacks emotions or he's a total nihilist. \n\nThe production on this one is quite muddy which is a good thing due to the nature of the content which wouldn't sound natural if the production would have been more clear. One thing which I totally despise though, is their failed attempt in covering Venom's \"Witching Hour\". Rather than an actual song, it sounds more like a block of noise which is simply incompatible with the rest of the album. Another thing which might not be as annoying as the previous con mentioned, is the superficiality behind the lyrics. Sure, they're brutal and very hateful but that's as far as it goes. The only challenge that it provides to the listener is to imagine certain scenes depicted in certain songs such as \"Chainsaw Gutsfuck\". \n\nI think that most people who enjoy listening to the fanatical genre of black metal have already acquainted themselves with this release since it's considered to be an essential among most of the die-hard fans out there. I have to warn you all, this not for the faint of heart since the musicians will try to pull out all the stops to get you snowed under with pure, mentally depraved music which will surely change your nature after a couple of listens. One thing that I'm sure of, is that black metal as we know it today and quite possibly, brutal death metal, wouldn't have been constituted by the same elements we're all fond of nowadays, if this release never existed.\n",
        "\nMayhem, as whole, is a vastly overrated black metal band. They have always contributed more to their genre through notoriety than through the actual substance of their music. Perhaps as a result of this notoriety, they were also incredibly disorganized and slow at getting their material released. By 1994, the year of the release of their oft-praised opus De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas, they had gone through four singers, two drummers, a bassist, and the band\u2019s two primary songwriters were dead. From the period of 1987 to 1994, they had managed to release only a single and a live album, featuring mostly the music that would later appear on De Mysteriis. By comparison, we can look at the timeline of their Norwegian black metal contemporaries Darkthrone. In the period from 1990 to 1994 Darkthrone had written, recorded, and released four albums, recorded demos for a fifth, undergone a radical change in genre, and shown no sign of slowing down.\n\nOne wonders if there would have been a follow-up to De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas at all if Euronymous had not been murdered, and if there was, how long it would have taken the band to get it released. Even with the reformed Mayhem that replaced Euronymous with Blasphemer and brought back previous members Maniac and Necrobutcher, it took the band another six years to release another full-length studio album. It turned out to be well worth the wait, for the band\u2019s 2000 release, Grand Declaration of War, stands as Mayhem\u2019s triumph, their best work and an essential listen for any black metal fan with an open mind.\n\nThe title of the album essentially says it all. This is Mayhem\u2019s formally announced war on Christianity, led by the lunatic general with the appropriate name of Maniac. On Grand Declaration of War, Maniac expertly leads his troops through a 45-minute battle of furious tremolo picking and triggered drums, addressing his warriors in myriad tones. Maniac really shines as vocalist on this album, showcasing his diversity with a variety of strong vocalizations. The styles featured on this album include a reptilian rasp, sections of eerie whispering, the vocalist\u2019s classic \u201cvomiting into the microphone\u201d style that had been featured on 1997\u2019s Wolf\u2019s Lair Abyss, and an interesting clean shouting style present on a majority of the album\u2019s tracks. Surprisingly, the most effective method of vocalization on this album is the last style mentioned. With the clean vocals, Maniac is able to create a powerful mood for the album, a mood that would not have materialized with harsh vocals alone. On the album\u2019s second track, \u201cIn the Lies Where upon You Lay\u201d, Maniac declares to his victim triumphantly \u201call your life is DEAD, priest!\u201d The clarity of the vocals in these sections contributes greatly to the atmosphere of the album, and when combined with the retching vocals, makes for a truly engaging listen.\n\nWhile the vocals are the key element to this album, there is some brilliant musicianship present as well. Blasphemer manages to create a dark, militant atmosphere perfect for the album with his tremolo-picked tritone melodies and minor triads played in his precise style. Hellhammer is as strong as ever, contributing to the chaos with his impeccable triggered blast beats. Interesting to note on this release is that although the production for this release is crystal clear, Necrobutcher\u2019s bass is almost completely inaudible, just as it had been on previous releases. Guitars are clearly the musical focus of this album, with bass given little to no attention.\n\nOne of the album\u2019s standout pieces, \u201cA Bloodsword and a Colder Sun\u201d, shows Mayhem at their most experimental. The arrangement begins with a spoken word introduction featuring dark lyrics, leading into a slow groove for the rest of the piece, a groove dominated by synthesizers, processed vocals, and electronic drums. The song serves to give the listener an interesting break from the black metal chaos that starts the record. \n\nAtmosphere really is a central aspect of this release. The band (minus Necrobutcher, as he can\u2019t be heard) works well together to present their message clearly, to give a sense of the hatred the band feels towards all things religious. Mayhem presents their declaration of war to a wide audience in the metal world, given the album\u2019s crisp production. It is also clear that every track on this album was given a large amount of attention and painstakingly perfected down to the last detail. Every aspect of the album serves a purpose, including the five minutes of silence present toward the end of the album. The silence gives the listener time to reflect on what they have listened to, and sets the mood for the two minute outro that completes the album.\n\nAll in all, this is a fantastic album, and the only truly essential Mayhem release. It\u2019s a shame that they were never really able to follow this up, with 2004\u2019s Chimera being decidedly mediocre and the inexcusably awful Ordo ad Chao in 2008 serving to destroy what little credibility the band had left by that time. I urge anyone who is interested in Mayhem to start with this release, and then give De Mysteriis Dom Satahans a listen. De Mysteriis is a certainly an important album historically, but Grand Declaration of War is unquestionably the group\u2019s creative peak.\n\nAlbum highlights: \u201cIn the Lies Where upon You Lay\u201d, \u201cA Bloodsword and a Colder Sun\u201d, \u201cView from Nihil\u201d\n",
        "\nUndoubtedly one of most heavily anticipated albums ever in the black metal scene (or what's left of it), this album has been a very long time in development, and serves to mark the first really cohesive statement of the new Mayhem, or rather, Mayhem without the steadying dark influence of its founder, Euronymous. How interesting that this album should come out now, when the black metal scene is definitely on the wane (stylistically, and in terms of enthusiasm, audience participation, and compositional originality) worldwide - as a sort of bookend, much in the same way that the album 'De Mysteriis...' could be seen as one of the scene's founding works of art ten years ago. Mayhem, as a band, survived the entire black metal movement, trend, and its subsequent exploitation, even while the two most important members of the group (Dead and Euronymous) passed into the next world before they even got to see the flourishing of what they had fostered. Ironic? So here we have what could be easily summed up as the ending salvo for the black metal movement, the last gasp, a dying final exhalation (although the band probably doesn't see it that way), a death rattle prolonged over the course of thirteen songs and almost fifty minutes. Is it worth listening to? I believe so.\n\nAlready this album has been attacked on a wide scale because of its stylistic departures from what Mayhem had accomplished in the past - people (self-styled metal 'critics', yawn) are saying that Mayhem has moved too far ahead of the scene's common grounds of evolution, too fast, too much, too soon. That's ridiculous - there are no limits on a band's sense of personal progression and evolution, other than internal cohesion and the legibility of the resulting material. What this album offers is not really that far advanced from the material they had showcased on their last release, 'Wolf's Lair Abyss' - it just pushes the ideas encapsulated on that (admittedly excellent) EP even further, to their logical conclusions. If you are confused by this, or fail to understand, go back and listen to that release and then compare it to the new one. The guitar sound, the riffs, the drumming techniques - are they that different? Has the progression here really been that radical? I'm sure that a fairly knowledgeable black metal enthusiast could have extrapolated the sense of that album's aesthetics and, using his imagination, come up with something in his understanding very close to the sound of this new album. Besides, with a band as enormously influential as Mayhem (and you can be sure they are aware of their position) would anything less than 'revolutionary' really be acceptable?\n\nMayhem have stripped their sound and sense of melodicism down to its very essentials, its basic elements, and rebuilt their approach from those characteristics - achieving a very machine-like, cold, ruthless, misanthropic, sterile feel to their music (much like the new Satyricon): a sense of melody and a concentration on building song structures that doesn't really offer any concessions to the listener. The guitar sound is remarkably lifeless, arrogant, robotic, and aloof. Playing this over and over, I never arrived at the conclusion that Mayhem were really trying to communicate anything to me, whether it was malice, hatred, anger, disgust, or whatever. The melodies on this album are all very small, shriveled, stunted, rambling, and without any sense of warmth - on purpose, of course. At their worst they seem to just be challenging technical exercises for the guitars (a little like Meshuggah), oscillating through preset patterns, following completely idiosyncratic themes of development. At their best they are beautifully depressing, isolated examples of musical solipsism - almost as if Mayhem are playing completely for themselves, and this album was captured through eavesdropping on their rehearsals. Much like the last EP, the music here really only serves to remind you of this band's complete separation from anything and everything, wrapped up in a cocoon of hatred, misanthropy, and despair. To listen to this work is to feel your isolation and loneliness made manifest.\n\nBecause this is a concept album of sorts, centering around the band's rabid hatred of Christianity, all the songs are connected not only through their internal stylistics but also through a very loose running narrative that stretches through the entire album. It is difficult to pick out individual songs and analyze them - this album is better heard all the way through, as a progression from the first moment to the last. The songs are more easily understood in that context.\n\nThere is a very strident sense of militaristic efficiency throughout this release, starting from the pulsing march of the first song, where the rhythms are meant to evoke a sense of a battle being joined, a war initiated (or at least declared), or a challenge being offered. Hellhammer's stupefying drum work is never less than perfect, and it sounds here like he has even increased his potential for speed while widening his range of rhythmic techniques. Never satisfied to just blast in a straightforward manner, his hyperactivity is translated here into multiple fill techniques (the sheer speed of which you probably will not believe), an original approach to changing patterns and beats beneath the guitars almost schizophrenically (but with a freezing precision that belies any sense of madness), and an effort to do as much as he can to expand the evocative range of the music. His contribution here is as great as it was expected to be, and shows very effectively once again why he is considered the best drummer in black metal.\n\nManiac has tried here to expand his potential for drama by using different techniques as well. Sticking most of the time to a mid-ranged shout or scream (when he's not reading off the lyrics like an apocalyptic apostle preaching to a damned congregation), his vocals, for the most part, fit in very well with the music as they offer very little in the way of emotion, even though his black snarls are some of the most bestial ever heard from this band, reminding me a lot of Attila's work on the 'De Mysteriis..' opus. If Dead's motivation in Mayhem was to 'create a style of emotionless, flat, singing' then Maniac is following in his footsteps in a professional manner, not abandoning his legacy, while trying to advance the possibilities his position offers him.\n\nAbout the inclusion of 'electronic influences' on this album: they are not as important in the style of this release as they are being represented to be. In fact, they are hardly ever present except on a few songs, and on those they are used to spread an atmospheric effect more than anything else. Yes, there is a 'darkwave' or 'industrial song', with a slow techno feel to it, but that is only one song out of thirteen. 90% of this album is pure new wave Norwegian black metal and features no keyboards or added industrial elements, and while stylistically it may not be what you would expect from this band if you only knew Mayhem from recordings that are now almost ten years old (this really is a completely different band, after all), it is directly in the pattern of progression that they offered for perusal on their last release, as I stated above.\n\nSo, in my final summation, I think this is a very worthy release - not really what I would have wanted from this band, but something that doesn't surprise me at all. I believe the logical outcome of a sense of aesthetics that calls for a blistering, isolating, misanthropic sound is a type of music that is more machine-like than human. That makes sense, doesn't it? I don't know how much farther Mayhem can press this sort of concentration and musical commitment, but right now this is state of the art (for Norway) and makes perfect sense in the greater scheme of things. I recommend listening to it, and I am sure it is going to be massively influential. \n\nUA\n\nErebus Magazine\nhttp://erebuszine.blogspot.com\n",
        "\nThis album seems like an afterthought with so much nonsense and controversy surrounding this band. Varg and Snorre murdered Euronymous, who was perhaps the most influential person in the black metal scene at the time. There is also all the other extracurricular activities these guys participated in. How much time do these guys honestly dedicate to making a quality album, when they are out burning churches? How about Euronymous running his studio, and record shop? Euronymous was also gallivanting hither and yon getting the word out there that band-mate Dead committed suicide, that they made necklaces of his skull, ate his brain, etc. He did this just to make Mayhem seem as evil a group of guys as they come. How is this leaving time for Mayhem to write a decent album? I don't think they really did have time, and I think the album suffered for it. Too bad Varg and Snorre didn't \"go big or go home\" by off-ing Attila as well as Euronymous. In my opinion, Attila was the weakest link in an album that could only be considered mediocre.\n\nThis album lacks character. The album sounds like pretty much every other black metal album available in the early stages of the genre. It is fuzzy, filled with tremolo picking, blast beats galore, and lots of double bass. What it also has a lot of, is Attila Csihar's annoying schizophrenic voice. His voice is excruciatingly loud on this album. This exacerbates his almost maniacal singing style, which ranges from grunts, gutteral growls, snarls, and incoherent mumbling and then an ejaculation that sounds like a bark (see 3:15 of Funeral Fog). This strange style of singing is detrimental in the sense that it does not add a degree of mystery, emotion, or even implied insanity. It takes away from what could have been a decent album. While I was listen to the album, I stop paying attention to the music, and instead try to figure out what the hell Attila is doing.\n\nWhen I do have a chance to focus on the music, there really isn't a lot there. Sure, the guitars are fast and there is decent drumming, but it lacks substance. It's standard chord progressions with massive amounts of distortion. The production is so muddy, that the chord progressions themselves are difficult to discern. There is a half-assed solo in Life Eternal (2:45-3:00) where it's a lot of whammy bar usage but not very technical. The drumming is competent, but soulless. It seemed like Hellhammer was blasting away mindlessly, because the drums sound extremely triggered. Double bass alternates with blast beats during the fast sections, and there is ample reliance on the ride cymbal during the slower sections. The fills moving from one speed to another appear contrived, and don't have much flair. They seem to be done only as a necessity. Varg is inaudible except for a few fleeting moments in the album, namely parts of Life Eternal (see about 1:15). Other than that, the murderer barely registers. \n\nDon't get sucked into all the shenanigans this band was a part of at the time of this album's release. This album has very little quality musicianship, atmosphere, and is overall boring. There are no interesting riffs, very little diversity, and what diversity there is, can be attributed to Csihar's squealing. The best I can do for a reference as far as the vocals go, is Niklas Kvarforth. If you like listening to this style of croaking on Shining's albums, then you're in for a treat. If you are more interested in listening to a quality black metal release that has historical significance, go with Enslaved's \"Vikingligr Veldi\", or albums 2-5 by Darkthrone.\n",
        "\nThis is probably the album surrounded with the most dramatic background of tragic happenings. Firstly, there was the suicide of Per \u201cDead\u201d Ohlin and secondly the murder of Euronymous. If you support Vikernes or Euronymous doesn\u2019t matter since it is irrelevant to the music of this album, however one cannot help to listen to and, God forbid, enjoy the content of this album without referring to the tragic emotional background in which this was created. Ohlin committed suicide before the album was released, but he did write some of the lyrics. He is best known for the lyrics of \u201cFreezing Moon\u201d. Euronymous was more directly involved with the album because he played guitar. In light of this, you can clearly see the direct connotation (Euronymous) and the more indirect connotation (Ohlin). Which is the strongest? I personally will go with the indirect connotation.\n\nThe indirect connotation conjures up the personality and subjective existential trauma of Ohlin\u2019s life. He was known as an outsider in the true sense of the word \u2013 quiet, with a morbid sense of humour, and obsessed with death. All members of this band can be seen as outsiders, but Ohlin was one in the original sense of the word and this had an indirect and very strong influence on the aura of this album. \u201cFreezing Moon\u201d addresses a very desolate, morbid, suicidal, and general outsider kind of concept which is almost unimaginable. The music is quite trance-like and also theatrical in the sense that the rhythm embodies a ritualistic aura that can be best appreciated by distant observation. This distance is deconstructed by the aesthetic features of the track that embodies a kind of darkness that manifests in the raw vocals, the repetition of basic, yet powerful guitar riffs, and a guitar solo that cuts through the thickest ice. \n\nIn comparison to the first track, \u201cFreezing Moon\u201d is much deeper because the first track is quite an overrated piece that contains mumbled vocals and music that is so poorly constructed that it is almost good in an ironic way. Don\u2019t get me wrong, \u201cFuneral Fog\u201d is not shit, but it embodies a certain element of the direct connotation in the sense that it is like a ghoul mutilating an already mutilated body. \n\nThe longer the album plays the rawer and darker it gets. The vocals are fascinating. Dissed by some for being overrated in general, you cannot deny that the vocals perfectly fit in with the raw atmosphere. The vocalist constantly switches between screams, mumbling, frustrated cries and unique growls. We can argue for hours about the guitar riffs, but the thing is that these basic guitar riffs embody a very strong theatrical element which is combined with an ever-changing aura that conjures up metaphorical storms in the mind of the listener.\n\nThe last few minutes of \u201cPagan Fears\u201d gets quite frustrating because there is no alteration in the riffs, but it feels like the band did this on purpose so that the listener has to cut through these dense waves in order to be blown away by the high speed introduction of \u201cLife Eternal\u201d. Hereafter, the track flows into a very rhythmic piece of music wherein the vocals contain an old school metal kind of feeling. The guitar solo on this one is very high-pitched, but also quite faint. It is interesting because it might joke around with the frustrations of the listener. In some way, a lot of the tracks on this album sound very much the same. I would not say that it sounds the same in a negative way, but it could get frustrating to some listeners depending on individual taste (as always). I personally would say that it sounds the same in the sense of Mayhem constructing a coherent style of raw black metal that contains a strong analogy.\n\nThis analogy manifests as something that causes the album to lay a cornerstone for the future of black metal in one way, but also a theatrical piece that is so unique that it is anti-theatrical in the sense that you constantly hear the muted voice of Ohlin in the background. This album is not rebellious; I would rather see it as a very sad, mourning piece that seeks to embody the spirit of Ohlin. The title track at the end of this album is, together with \u201cFreezing Moon\u201d, probably the most outstanding of the whole album with a very ritualistic sound in the sense that the guitar riffs sound like an orchestra from hell that spawns on the devil\u2019s playground. The distant demonic cry that the vocalist gives in the beginning of this track is very scary. The guitar riffs are mostly high-pitched and fit perfectly with the high speed, blasting drums.\n\nYou can be directly connected to an album and play the guitar along with your corpse paint and general spooky appearances drenched in myths, but in the end nothing will beat the indirect connection of the tortured individual that constantly embodies the metaphorical theater, just to flee from it again and rest on the freezing moon.\n",
        "\nMayhem are perhaps the most infamous black metal band out there for a variety of reasons. Inspired by the raw sound of Venom and the brash sound of Motorhead and, more prominently, Celtic Frost, bassist Necromancer, drummer Kjetil and guitarist/vocalist Euronymous came together in 1984 to form the band. This lineup was short lived, releasing the Pure Fucking Armageddon EP, before Euronymous shifted to primarily focusing on guitar. In his place as vocalist stepped in Maniac, and released the EP Deathcrush that sold all of its limited 1,000 copies. Following this Maniac left and was replaced by Dead on vocals and that was where Mayhem's more famous side came about. At first he would slice himself on stage and the band would have the impaled severed heads of various animals on poles but then tragedy struck when he was found dead with a shotgun wound and sliced wrists and Mayhem were without a vocalist again. In August 1993 tragedy once again struck, with Euronymous being murdered by band-mate Varg, who would become even more famous for his work with Burzum and later be imprisoned for 21 years for the murder of Euronymous. By this point it would have seemed likely that a Mayhem release would never see the light of day. Come 1994, people were proven wrong however.\n\nDe Mysteriis Dom Sathanas is considered to be both one of the most influential and one of the best black metal releases of all time as well as being hugely debated. With Hellhammer on drums, Euronymous' guitar work and Varg on bass coupled with the iconic and instantly recognizable dark and morose vocals from Attila, the band were geared up to release said album containing eight songs and whizzing past in forty six minutes. The sound of the album pretty much set the bar for any straight up black metal bands that did not feel the need to mess around with symphonies nor clean vocals, using flurries of lightning fast tremolo picking, crazily speedy blast beats and some of the most agonized shrieks laid to record from Attila. Closing the package is probably the finest black metal production job ever recorded. Many bands preferred the fuzzy, raw sound that could be gained from recording in such areas as a band member's garage, but Mayhem showed that a dark and atmospheric sound could still be garnered from the listener actually being able to hear every note crisply. The production job is not as clean as, say, The Black Album, and is still very dark and has a raw feel to it but instead of the guitars being inaudible over the frenzied drumming, every instrument is perfectly audible with some great tones to them.\n\nThe song craft itself on here is marvelous and the album itself is a masterpiece. The opener, Funeral Fog, stands out as one of the best on the record with its memorable and eerie nature and who could ever forget Attila roaring \"fu-nerrrr-al.... FOG!\" in that really strange, almost alien sound he has to his voice. Cursed In Eternity has some of the closest to traditional black metal shrieks found on the album, with Attila almost sounding like the bog-standard generic black metal vocalist on that song as well as there being some nice stop-start drumming sections half-way through the song on top of some really memorable riffing. However the real horrific beauty and genius of this album is found when it is left to play out in its entirety, instead of just skipping to one or two of the songs. The sound of this album is one of absolute brutality. Sure, it may get a little repetitive and samey with time, as with almost all black metal albums, but this is certainly one horrifying ride through the darkest corridors of the human mind. The atmosphere on display is one of foreboding as if the band are warning the listener to not try and understand why they do what they do, and to just go along with it, for nothing about this album makes any sense at all and yet it never fails to astound me.\n\nThis is one of the best if not the best and certainly the most instantly recognizable black metal albums of all time and, for once, is an album that actually lives up to its reputation. I recommend this to anyone looking for three quarters of an hours worth of raw, brutal black metal.\n",
        "\nThough I am a long-standing champion of Blasphemer-era Mayhem as THE worthwhile incarnation of the band, I cannot fully recommend their latest platter Ordo Ad Chao.\n\nUnquestionably their ugliest record since Deathcrush, the production of Ordo Ad Chao sucks and unfortunately obscures what made the last three Mayhem releases great: Blasphemer\u2019s riffs. Wolf\u2019s Lair Abyss stands as the best produced of the Blasphemer-era- that thing sounds rich, sharp but also dirty and evil- but even the too-clear triggered sonics of Grand Declaration of War and the pristine darkness of Chimera (both fucking brilliant albums) better suit the barbed wire and alien logic of Blasphemer\u2019s songwriting than the murky, drum-and-vocal-dominated mix of Ordo Ad Chao.\n\nI\u2019ll not spend all of my review on this superficial choice, but not in recent memory can I recall an album so injured by its production\u2014 it\u2019s like getting a Dio album with the vocals barely audible. Not cool & creepy like all those lo-fi bands I like (Horna, Moonblood, Clandestine Blaze, etc.) Ordo Ad Chao sounds like a badly mixed club show. I mean seriously, parts of \u201cWall of Water\u201d & \u201cGreat Work of Ages\u201d sound like the drummer and singer are rehearsing before the guitarist even arrived. Drum legend Hellhammer is in fine form (love that purposely klutzy drum fill at 4:15 in \u201cWall of Water\u201d), but any time he blastbeats, his snare hits covers up everything else\u2014giving the proceedings a slightly industrial vibe.\n\nOn Ordo Ad Chao we have the return of Attila Csihar to the microphone and the results are mixed. Although he is a unique vocalist- and in many ways superior to Maniac (see Attila\u2019s career highlight work for Keep of Kalessin)- his persona oddly pushes the world of Mayhem in an infantile direction. While Maniac\u2019s work on Chimera was unspectacular compared to his daring Grand Declaration efforts, he never distracted from the material; Attila\u2019s antics distract as often as they enhance Ordo. Though I prefer the quality of Atilla\u2019s screeching voice to Maniac\u2019s, his performance here varies from creepy to playful, that latter an unwanted element in Mayhem music. Also distracting is the outrageously flanged bass guitar, which is cool for a moment\u2026but after forty BWOWS! loses its charm (as it continually covers up guitar).\n\nA bigger issue with this album- in direct opposition to the minimalist Chimera- is that the songs are overworked, too intellectual and contain superfluous parts; see also Emperor\u2019s Prometheus. While every single song displays moments of Blasphemer\u2019s songwriting brilliance, every song has a section (or two or three or more) that is sub-par, doesn\u2019t flow or seems just plain irrelevant. The first minute of \u201cDeconsecrate,\u201d the last portion of \u201cGreat Work of Ages\u201d a shitload of the middle of \u201cIlluminate Eliminate\u201d should simply not be.\n\nUnfocused, badly mixed, erratic, but occasionally brilliant, the new Mayhem features an ugly sound that works against the backbone of the band: the riffing constructs of visionary guitarist Blasphemer. I wanted to love this album like the last three- all of which are completely different experiences- but I don\u2019t.\n",
        "\nMayhem have been through quite a lot since their inception in 1984. Led by the late, great guitarist Euronymous, they led the charges against all other forms of metal, creating among the ruins what became known the world over as black metal. Despite the many turmoils of the band, from Dead's suicide to Euronymous' murder by Varg Vikernes to the many church burnings (also committed by Vikernes), the band still knew how to make a good black metal album. While on recent releases they are becoming more experimental, quite possibly on the path to losing the sound that made them who they are today. Back in 1994, they created what is hands down the quintessential statement of the Norwegian black metal scene: DE MYSTERIIS DOM SATHANAS. \n\nThis album is darker than anything else produced during this time. Mayhem was always ahead of the scene, creating faster and much more evil material than their contemporaries like Darkthrone, Immortal, Ulver, Emperor, and the notorious Burzum, home to the aforementioned Varg Vikernes. While those bands all made excellent contributions to the scene, none of them had the same impact as this. It's an album like this that has everything that the bands these days have adapted for their own aural attacks. And we have Mayhem to thank for that.\n\nEvery aspect of this violent release is a marvel in low-production releases. The riffs are incredibly evil-sounding, and with the incredible skills of Euronymous and (apparent) session guitarist Blackfire, they are more destructive then ever. The vocals are completely inhuman, provided by none other than Attila Csihar, a talented vocalist who sadly deserves way more than he receives. The drums are quite literally light speed fast, thanks to the incomprehensible talents of Hellhammer, master drummer extraordinaire. The atmosphere is complete darkness, bringing to mind images of bloodstained ruins, churches ablaze, and the lord of lies himself. I find it incredibly difficult to imagine a way to attempt to replicate the tones and sounds on this album. They guitar tones are so atmospheric, it sounds otherworldly. Every instrument can be heard with clarity, making it more haunting, given that its mastermind, Euronymous, was killed before it was released, and here his murderer plays bass like no one's business along side the once-alive great guitarist.\n\nThis album is completely flawless. Every instrument is completely audible despite its lo-fi production. This is the definitive black metal album and it will remain that way for generations to come, forever influencing the young'uns in how it was done in Norway.\n",
        "\nI love Mayhem. I'm just gonna come out and say it, I love these guys, the true northern kings of grimness. But only for their earlier, more influential works, such as 'Deathcrush' or the soul-crushing classic 'De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas.\" The pure genius of this band lies in the grassroots uprising that was lead by Euronymous. From the infamous record shop Helvete to Euronymous' own record label Deathlike Silence, the path they took helped launch Mayhem into underground promince. Among their early releases, there lies a nearly unknown live account, displaying the band's true colors. Not only that, it's an excellent reminder of the legendary vocalist known simply as DEAD.\n\nDuring his lifetime (which was undeniably short), Dead proved to the metal underground that not only was he a capable singer whose voice was so demonic and tortured that its only rival was Quorthon's voice from Bathory's self-titled debut, but was also a trailblazing showman. There are also accounts of the many props he had and gruesome actions the man did on stage: wrist cutting, breathing the fumes of a bird's corpse, and the proud display of rotting pig heads on wooden stakes. No joke. Dead was truly out there, and the fact that he was the first to use corpsepaint further proves that his influence is and forever will be unrivaled.\n\nAs Dead's screams rings through this recording, it's the other members of the band who excellently compliment the destructive force that Mayhem has become known for. Euronymous's guitar playing is destructive and hellish, his tone fitting the riffs with incredible precision. Hellhammer's drumming comes as a brutal and equally percussive assault. While the bass can only be heard through noise-canceling, professional headphones (in other words, it's nearly completely inaudible), the quality is, I think, surprisingly good... for a lo-fi live album.\n\nThe songs on this recording are even more evil-sounding than ever. Some are taken from the 'Deathcrush' ep while others will soon reappear on the mighty 'De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas'. The creation and execution of these songs are impossible to beat, given the youthful angst-ridden energy of Mayhem's earlier works. The riffs may be primitive, but even today they are performed and have become live staples of the band's later-era concerts. \n\nThere's no denying it, this album is a brilliant hellstorm of musical violence. With an amazing band in their rawest form and a legendary, unbeatable frontman at the helm, this is Mayhem at their finest. But all in all, this album is solely Dead's show. This is unquestionably his finest hour.\n",
        "\nI am a Mayhem fan. At one glorious point in my life, I had in my possession every studio album Mayhem made, every live album, and several bootlegs as well. I know my fukken Mayhem. \n\nBut I can't see how anybody could feasibly rate this any higher than 25 or 30 percent. I don't know how anybody could logically think of this as an interesting side note. It makes me ashamed to say that I'm a Mayhem fan when it's clear some fans will eat up whatever shit the band made when they were young and didn't know shit about making a demo or playing the instruments right. I mean, where to begin? For starters, there is really not a whole lot of material here. There's a pointless intro (sounds like shit, does nothing for the demo), a half-assed cover of Black Metal, and 3 original songs, all three of which are played sloppily and it is apparent that every damn corner was cut in the production of this. Frankly, since Pure Fucking Armageddon (the song) appears in damn near every live album Mayhem made, as well as the Deathcrush MCD, there's literally NOTHING you would gain by listening to the version here. The production completely distorts the guitars and bass beyond recognition, and the drums sound like pots and pans, whilst all this is recorded from a tape deck. Carnage, as well, appears on many Mayhem live albums where it is performed much more competently and convincingly, and there is little reason to hear this version of Carnage -- you can't discern anything here, vocals included -- so the only remaining reason to even listen to this AT ALL, is Ghoul. And even still, it's not much to listen to. \n\nMayhem would end up becoming legends, but this is some real crap right here. Honestly, it's almost to the point where I'd rate a blank tape with a fart at the end higher than this. It's not kvlt, it's just a crap demo recorded in someone's garage with a tape deck by a band who needed quite a few more rehearsals.\n",
        "\nAlthough this album has 18 reviews or so, I felt obliged to add my own, especially after I saw the 77% rating for this album which is clearly TOO FUCKING MUCH. Now I'm not writing this review just to lower Mayhem's rating, but to express my disappointment in somewhat overrated Mayhem's present quality. Mayhem went well downhill after their not-so-significantly bad release \"Grand Declaration Of War\". Since then, they've been trying to recover their old glory on the \"Chimera\" album, and now this...\n\nWe all remember great songs from the \"Deathcrush\" ep or the \"De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\" album and where the heck did it all go? Well, you'll get the point after you listen to the riffage on this album. It's pure shit, it has absolutely no \"blackness\" in it, no inspiration, just something that tries really hard, but fails in every aspect of brutality and that martyr black metal sound. All of that makes the songs extremely dull. I would expect more from these black metal veterans, but clearly they've gone softer over the years as they're getting older that is. All in all, I give 5% to riffage because of its high mediocrity.\n\nThe vocals are, considering black metal, extremely good, although I prefer much \"dirtier\" vocals in black metal, but considering the passing of time and modernization and all, I think they're really, really good. Vocals pretty much depict blackness in its full dirty misanthropic form and they pretty much succeed in this part, so I give them 15%, although I guess they would sound better if the riffage wasn't so mediocre.\n\nAs far as lyrics go, they're pretty much standard black metal. Nothing more to say about them, although they vary from song to song from misanthropic to somewhat gloomy and apocalyptic . So lyrics get 10% for being plain okay.\n\nBecause of the bad riffage, bass lines follow in \"badness\". It's okay, but not...good, so the bass lines get 5% along with riffage. The drumming is for the most part pretty good, considering other bad stuff on this album, and keeps up a good solid rhythm. Smashing and bashing crashes and chimes, the drumming pretty much pulls this album out of shit. But drums are not \"the whole\" band, but a link in a chain, and a pretty strong link. So drumming gets 15% for making all of this sound better and for being a well-oiled machine.\n\nIf I was to compare this particular album to a chain, I'd say that the vocals and drumming are the only strong links with lyrics holding solidly to the other two very corroded, weak, and shitty ones. \n\nSo all in all, this is a plain mediocre album. It's worth listening to if you want to complete the whole \"Mayhem goes down on black metal quality\" experience. Mayhem is still an excellent and solid black metal band with live performances that go out of this world, and we still have high hopes that maybe, just maybe they'll go back to being \"pure fucking Armageddon\" once more rather than this.\n",
        "\nThis album needs no introduction. One of the most bootlegged and has an aura of controversy surrounding it. Mayhem's The Dawn of the Black Hearts was released in 1995. The recording (the main part) is a recording of a concert in Sarpsborg Norway, in February 1990. The album features what has been voted the most controversial album cover of all time. I will end the discussion on the cover there and move forwards on my thoughts on the album itself.\n\nTracks 1 through 8 are from the aforementioned Sarpsborg show. The main problem with the album is the sound quality. Through out the Sarpsborg part, you'll only really hear the drums and the guitar. While this isn't taboo for Mayhem recordings, it is really bad on this one. Most of the time, the drums and guitar make it hard to hear the vocals, and you wouldn't even know that their was a bass player. The vocal quality is slightly better. Dead drones in and out and this can get annoying. However, their are songs on which you can hear him quite well. As for the bass sound and quality, there basically isn't any due to everything else making it impossible to hear. Just because it's a bootleg, doesn't mean that the quality needs to be bad.\n\nNow for the individual sounds. The drums are very loud, and make it hard to hear a lot of the music. While this is typical old Hellhammer, it can get irritating. The guitar as always, is a shrieking buzzsaw. This is what Euronymous should sound like, even with crappy quality. As always, his rifts will make your head buzz, and his solos with send shivers down your back. Dead's vocals, the main reason somebody would want to hear this album, are not his best. While they are certainly better then his work on Live in Leipzig, his singing just isn't what it can be. It should be noted that on some songs, there's an eerie echo which enhances the dark atmosphere he sets.\n\nThe track listing is usual for the period. A few songs from Deathcrush, some from De Mysteriis, and Carnage. However, it's missing Pagan Fears, which seems to occur on a lot of live Dead recordings outside of Live in Leipzig. However this isn't reason for somebody to not enjoy the track list (unless you really like Pagan Fears).\n\nNow for the other recordings. In most cases, The Dawn of the Black Hearts has four tracks from a 1986 concert in Follorocken in Ski, Norway. These recordings feature Messiah on vocals and Manheim on drums. However, the copy I have features a few more recordings of Dead. Two tracks are the famous studio tracks that feature Dead. The the rest of the recording is of a 1988 rehearsal. I have already reviewed the studio tracks, so I'll talk about the rehearsal.\n\nWhile the Ski recordings are outright terrible, these might be worse. Besides the drums, you can't hear a damn thing clearly. And while the recordings are from 1988, it's just pitiful compared to the Ski recordings. The track list is the usual offerings from the Dead era and there is no need to go further on the subject of them, or this part of the album.\n\nAll in all, Dawn of the Black Hearts isn't the legendary record that people make it out to be. With piss poor quality (except for the studio tracks) it will take a lot of repeated playings to hear everything. While this is a definite buy for any fan of Mayhem, Norwegian black metal, or Dead, it is not the best.\n",
        "\nMayhem's debut record is a result of the underground scene creating many death/thrash metal bands. In 1986, while thrash metal was reaching Top 40 on Billboard, death metal, grindcore, hardcore bands appeared like mushrooms after the rain. The First Wave of Black Metal began to decline, bands such as Venom, Bathory and Celtic Frost haven't really been able to define this new genre. But, while image wise, Mayhem could incorporate elements from these bands, music-wise, Slayer and Kreator were the more sinister bands out there.\n\nIndeed, Kreator and Slayer were the main influences of this new outfit, but, sadly, no originality came from these guys. Or, at least, nothing original and memorable... Pure Fucking Armageddon, Carnage and Ghoul are all repetitive riff-wise and have flashy, wining solos with crappy gore lyrics and crappier English and fast and sloppy drumming. The cover song is a joke, I can barely hear something and it's too fast played.\n\nThe instrumentals are quite the same as the tracks with vocals, except for the track called \"Mayhem\", which is just a recording with the band waisting time. I think this is something like \"Listen to Nicko McBrain\" from Iron Maiden, just without any sense of humour (if you don't know Norwegian).\n\nVoice of a Tortured Skull is disturbing and the band tries something dark/ambient/drone music, but I'm not sure; hell, I don't think they are too. To bad they haven't exploited this style of composing, because they would have made some discoveries!\n\nAside from the terrible production, copycat riffs, shitty instrumentals and crappy vocals, I can not say this is essential. But this release does deserve some points for enthusiasm and the energy displayed...\n",
        "\nThis black metal band I feel doesn't really need an introduction since they've been dishing out metal for this genre as far back as their founding in 1984. The album is a true classic among the black metal community. Anyone who doubts this synopsis can pretty much stuff it because this release was so well put together that it deserves an honorary mention. I'm not a huge black metal fan, but this album has me hooked. It's one of those albums that you can listen to repeatedly and never get sick of because it's so original, fast, furious, evil, eerie and Satanic. That sums up Mayhem on here.\n\nThe music is composed of guitar frenzies featuring fast tremolo picking chords, slower eerie pieces, bass guitar parts that are dark and dreary and drums that keep up with the music. Pretty much all of the songs are very memorable and unique. Attila's vocals are so evil and possessed. Both guitarists Euronymous (RIP 1993) and Blackthorn dish out some great riffs that stick to the mind eternally. The guitar sound is so unique and creative. It's fast like I said before, but very well played out. The chords are mostly picked with fury and anger. No letup on that front.\n\nEven Count Grishnackh's bass guitar was audible here. The guitars aren't continuously playing fast, but they do have plenty of furious guitar work during most of the lengthy songs. Amazing what they put together I mean 8 tracks that clocks in around 46 minutes in length. They're really focus was I think on making the guitar the primary focal point of the album. It sets the tone for the dark vocals and Hellhammer's drum outputs. Really good tracks to download would be \"Freezing Moon\", \"Pagan Fears\" and \"From The Dark Past\".\n\nThe mixing and production are entirely solid on every aspect. You can hear the guitar melodies, bass guitar working, vocals well mixed in to augment the music, and the drums were very audible. There's nothing that went wrong here, everything was mixed in unison. There are no negative aspects to this release. It's one of the best black metal albums of all time. I say this because it's based on fact, not opinion. If you're a black metal fan and don't own this release, YouTube the songs that I mentioned and you'll want to pick it up right away.\n\nIn summary, here's a Mayhem album that stands out from all of the rest of them. It's their best album no doubt. Intensity was a huge factor here. But not every track like I said is extremely fast or extremely slow. There was one segment of the bass that was slow and played by itself without the guitars or drums, but it didn't last very long. Hellhammer blasts away here with great drum outputs that fit the music entirely. Attila's vocals were amazingly unique and dreary. It was perfect to have him on here to well fit the music. Own this album now!\n",
        "\nWhen anyone who is a fan of Mayhem and wishes to hear the voice of Dead (in song, although there is audio on Youtube of his speaking voice) usually buys either Freezing Moon, Live in Leipzig, Dawn of the Black Hearts, Year of the Goat (Morbid), or any number of bootlegs (or the Euronymous tribute album), so for any fan to try and find or own anything with a studio track of Dead's vocals, it's a pretty hard task. However, this tape features the only two studio tracks Dead has ever recorded.\n\nNow while I will admit Dead's Morbid days are better, he does have his moments with Mayhe where his voice is black metal perfection. This is not one of those. The quality of the recording is quite good for a studio recording in 1990. You can hear all of the instruments and vocals quite well (even if Necro fades out every now and then). It's a stretch to say that this is the best quality Mayhem recording ever as their newer releases are quite good (even if I don't like the albums themselves), so I'll go out on a limb and say these are the best recordings with Dead during his Mayhem years.\n\nNow while the quality is very good, it doesn't mean the songs themselves are any good. Now before you all start acting like a 12 year old girl who heard somebody say Justin Beiber sucks, I don't mean the lyrics, as they are two great songs. However, just the way they sound on this recording doesn't seem like Mayhem. It's not clean or polished, but it just doesn't feel like how most Mayhem recordings (even non-bootlegs) sound. I mentioned earlier on that this isn't Dead's best performance and it truly isn't. While he does sound like his usual possessed self and sets a very dark atmosphere, it just doesn't hold up to his other Mayhem recordings. I don't know if this is because it's not live or a rehearsal, but it doesn't sound like how Dead usually sounds. Other than Dead's vocals, the other parts of the songs fit very well in their sound. Hellhammer is quite loud on this recording and this helps in the thundering beats of the songs, especially on Carnage. Necro is his usual self, although you can actually hear him on this recording. Euronymous is also very good sounding. The solo in Freezing Moon is better then the one later on De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas, and the riffs on Carnage just sound awesome.\n\nAll in all, this recording of the only two studio tracks with Dead aren't the best. The quality is very good for this era of the band and gives a glimpse of what De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas could have sounded like (yes, I know almost everybody says this), and while the instruments sound good, Dead's vocals just seem so off. If you can get hold of these studio recordings (doesn't have to be on this recording, as they are on others), give yourself a pat on the back. It's the best era of Mayhem and this recording shows it, except for the vocals.\n",
        "\nMayhem's \"Live in Leipzig\" is the famous 1993 release that is only one of three official release featuring late vocalist Per (or Pelle) Yngve Ohlin, better known to the metal world as Dead. Released by several companies over the years, the album is one of black metals's finest moments. But does it hold up?\n\nFirst I'd like to discuss the quality and sound of the recording. Now with any black metal album, especially when it is of a Norwegian band, let us remember that distorted and low production where in. Rather it be because it is the way the album was intended to sound, or it ended up that way, is doubled with a live release. This is one of the better live albums from the time, however in between songs there is what sounds like somebody groaning. I do not know if this is a member of the band, the crowd, recorder, or just a random noise. As with any live release, the crowd is audible, but you won't notice it except for the time before the first song starts.\n\nAs far as sound goes outside of that mysterious groaning and the crowd, it's one of the better Mayhem release. Necrobutcher is the only instrument that you will have a hard time hearing, and this is due to the loudness of the drums, guitars, and vocals. However, you can hear him in the beginning of some songs and whenever the drums and guitars are not being played. Hellhammer, as I stated, is loud in this release and can be annoying at times when trying to pick out other aspects of the music. Other then that, it is some of his best, and I'd say it's better than his drumming on \"De Mysteriis Dom Sathans.\" Euronymous is as always good. The way he can shriek out the riffs and especially the solo (notably on Freezing Moon) will send shivers down your spine. And how can I forget Pelle's contribution. As always, it's Dead. His vocals here are reminiscent of his time in Morbid, meaning that he sings in more of a death metal style than what's heard on the \"Freezing Moon\" lp. Now you can hate me all you want, but this is not Dead's finest hour. He performs very well and as always paints an atmospheric picture for the listener, but I just think he could have done better.\n\nAs for the track listing, it's the usual for this era. Five songs from \"Deathcrush\" and four from \"De Mysteriis.\" This recording has my favorite version of Necrolust, as the guitar in the opening just makes me want to air guitar my heart out (yes, I know it's not very evil to do this. Forgive me). Other notable songs include Freezing Moon, Carnage, and Pure Fucking Armageddon, all of which literally live up to the name in this recording. \n\nAll in all, this is one of the best black metal albums and Mayhem albums you will ever hear. It does have its flaws (the main one being the droning sound and Necro being mute), it is still damn good. For any new fan of Mayhem, consider this your history lesson as you get the best of two great albums and all of the songs appear on numerous recordings. It is, as I said, one of few official releases that feature Pelle, and it is quite affordable to buy, so if you want to hear Dead, but this before any bootlegs or that album with that insipid photograph (but it's still a good album...well, the first part is). I suggest this to any metal fan, so go out an buy it my fellow evil doers.\n\nAlso because this is my first review here, please excuse if I did not write the album titles in proper grammar, as I'm having some difficulties with the tags.\n",
        "\nI cannot begin to describe how much I appreciate Mayhem. As many of us know, Mayhem is actually a band that spawned in the first black metal wave (most notably with an EP called Deathcrush), but their climax manifested in the second wave of black metal bands with a masterpiece called De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas, an album that will forever be credited as the most important and the most influential black metal album.\n\nMayhem, as time passed, had many line-up changes. Since Dead's suicide and Euronymous's death, most people though that they will never be what they once were. Wolf's Lair Abyss was a good start, but the experimental album Grand Declaration of War didn't produce any reaction... any positive reaction, actually.\n\nOrdo Ad Chao is probably the best work they ever did. This album, in my opinion, can be considered their maturity album. Fast and powerful blast drum beats done by Hellhammer that once again proves that he is the best drummer in the black metal scene, morbid and sinister vocals done by Attila that always amazes you - scream here, growl there, whisper here, this guy is totally unpredictable and truly a master among all the black metal vocalist. Clear bass lines done by Blasphemer (he claimed that Necrobutcher had absolutely nothing to do with the recording and production of this album) and a more modest performance done by Blasphemer at guitars that chose to reduce his guitar solos and riffs in favor of Attila's truly amazing vocals and for Hellhammer's drum solos.\n\nI was actually amazed hearing Mayhem fans (or former fans so to say, not that they ever were though) calling it crap because of the production quality. I'm sorry guys, but this is the True Mayhem, and true Mayhem plays True Black Metal, which should be in low production quality this way you can really feel that you've listened to Mayhem and that you listened to black metal. Anyway, placing production quality over artistic quality shows the fact that fans do not appreciate a band for what they write and compose, but from how good it sounds, which is really a shame and disrespect towards a band. \n\nThe fact that it is in low production quality gives the album a more sinister aura, especially when the instrumental is accompanied by Attila's voice. You can feel this like a chant and not much of a song, sorta speak. This is not an album made for headbanging. This is an album that needs to be listened to in complete darkness and isolation and the most important thing is listening to it many times in order to understand it.\n\nAnother thing I want to add is that I credit Maniac and Dead for their impressive vocals on other Mayhem works, but they pale in contrast with Attila. The guy can actually express emotional and spiritual states through his vocals, culminating with his cries in the song Key to the Storms.\n\nConceptually, unlike the old Mayhem albums, this one does not focus on Satanic, gore, or evil themes like we noticed in Deathcrush or De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas. It focuses especially on war, mythology, and misanthropy. We hear about a global flood in Wall of Water, though I don't really know if they were making a reference to the biblical flood or rather to a flood as a natural disaster.\n\nBy far, the best song this album has (not that the other ones aren't good, but this one makes its presence much more felt that the others) is Illuminate Eliminate. The song spawns for almost 10 minutes and you can also hear elements from doom metal and even progressive metal in it. Attila's vocals shine mostly in this song, expressing his emotions in a brilliant manner.\n\nThe last song, Anti, also marks the first video ever made by Mayhem, directed by Costin Chioreanu. Though the video does not really have any meaning since it only shows footage of a Mayhem concert, the song really has meaning. This song depicts the theme of war and makes references to Annunaki (check Wikipedia if you want to know more).\n\nOverall, a masterpiece. Though I mourn the departure of Blasphemer, I am sure that if, in the near future, Mayhem will release another album, I want it to be like this one - dark, morbid, and sinister. With Attila, Necrobutcher (though I don't really trust him when it comes to composing music) and Hellhammer will pull off something even better. Now with Teloch as composer, we might see another album in the near future. Hail Mayhem!\n",
        "\nMan, I would not want to be Attila Csihar's psychiatrist, nor would I even want to sit in on such a session. I'd quickly lose touch with all his various accumulated personalities, dizzied by his emotional contrasts. But then, I'm not really talking about an hour with a licensed shrink, but the 40 minutes one spends locked into the vices and disjointed devices of Ordo Ad Chao, the fourth Mayhem full-length in a career well over two decades deep. Attila returned to the fold shortly after the release of Chimera, Maniac off to pursue other interests, and yet again we are faced with a massive transformation in the band's core sound. If you thought the leap between Wolf's Lair Abyss and Grand Declaration of War was wide, then compare and contrast this one to its predecessor.\n\nOrdo Ad Chao is quite the antithesis of Chimera. Where that album boasted some punishing and slick production values, meaty guitar tones and violent yet dynamic riffing, this one sounds as if its being performed in the basement beneath you. Like you're a fly on the wall of some infernal, subterranean gathering. In fact, it might not be a bad idea to discount this as a Mayhem album altogether, but instead what might occur if a trio of known and respected Norwegian musicians brought a tape recorder along to an unfortunate encounter with a bag of bad mushrooms. Or, if you will, a deconstruction of the principles upon which the previous full-lengths were built. Up to this point, I realize I'm not painting a very positive outlook on this album, but in truth I did actually enjoy it quite a lot.\n\nOr 'not enjoy' it, depending on your perspective.\n\nCsihar was hardly a candidate for sanity on De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas 13 years prior, but the guy is simply all over this thing, as if it were some galleria of sickness. He very often seems to be improvising his lines, for how else could such a clutter manifest itself and still manage to seem authentic. In \"Key to the Storms\", he transforms from a sobbing, decrepit miser into a cackling lunatic. In \"Anti\", his guttural growls and heightened shrieks are enough to send anyone to the suicidal hotline. Wants us to hear every tremor upon his tongue. The schizophrenia and sadness presented through these eight pieces is a noted contrast to Maniac's more robust delivery on the last album. Sure, neither of these guys are the first you'd want to invite to a family dinner, but Attila's performance is far more scatterbrained and broken, which fits the music here like a needle to a vein.\n\nYet, while he's clearly the side attraction here, it's the music itself which takes center stage at the asylum talent show. Ordo Ad Chao is by far the least comfortable of Mayhem's records, in that it seems to shun the concepts of accessible melody and predictable structure altogether. Both the guitars and bass were performed by Blasphemer, and he seems to second guess himself through the whole runtime, offering sodden, dissonant grooves and brief spurts of razor tight tremolo licks that immediately pierce the surrounding atmosphere (as in \"Great Work of Ages\"). Even more bizarre: the drums. Hellhammer lays down a lot of grooves here, but he also bursts into some sick footwork on tracks like \"Deconsecrate\" and \"Illuminate Eliminate\" which is so damn dense and thundering that it almost explodes right out of the muffled, tenebrous mix that drags the entire album down into the murk of desolate, metaphysical symbolism of the lyrics.\n\nAnd that (the sound) will understandably prove a hurdle for most. Clearly we're looking at an entire different realm of aural transgression here, which bears more in common with most of the recent cavern-core retro death of the past few years than the black metal genre. In fact, outside from a few of the riffs and growls, it feels more like a somnolent, perturbing death metal journey than one we'd normally associate with Mayhem. The intentional under-wrought production is all too fitting to the composition, or rather the 'lack' of composition, and I can't see how else it would come across so harrowing and adventurous. Unlike other deconstruction's of sound, like 1349's miserable Revelations of the Black Flame, Ordo Ad Chao is almost hypnotic. A lattice of swollen, infected veins that loose pus into the listener's ears. A vortex of grime and agony. A welcome therapy for the mad, BY the mad.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nWhere De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas might represent that gang of greasy, intimidating 'cool' kids that hang out smoking cigarettes behind the ruins of your old town library, and Grand Declaration of War the crowd of nerdy, preachy PoliSci hopefuls at your community college, Chimera is the clean-cut heartthrob that you will most likely deem fit to bring home to Mom. That is, if your Mom is the fucking Devil, and plans on seducing and devouring such a wanton sacrifice. Mayhem have honed in on their production values this time out, and presented what must be their glossiest, most straightforward effort to date. The surgical precision of the riffing from the prior album are retained, and yet there's a backslide into extremity here that recalls the Wolf's Lair Abyss EP. The guitar tones are far thicker, and the vocals more ghastly and copious, abandoning the spoken word bits, and for many alienated souls, this might damn well have been the return to crushing form that they so desired.\n\nThat said, this album is not nearly so callous or grim as the band's early recordings. Mayhem are still taking some chances here, just not a lot of them. In truth, I'd say that Chimera serves as a solid 'point of entry' for fans of more technical, brutal death metal, or perhaps the more potent black/death hybrids. They'll appreciate its musicianship and dynamic range more than either the strangeness of Grand Declaration or the cold breath of De Mysteriis. The Norwegians make an appreciable showing themselves as individuals who have their fingers on the current, and can blast and burst along with the brightest, brashest younger demons in the field. I never really got the impression that they were going solely for that same, out of control momentum that they displayed on Wolf's Lair, but it's difficult to deny the pure bruising hostility of opener \"Whore\", or the bludgeoning speed and fire of \"Slaughter of Dreams\".\n\nStill, the moments here that I found most interesting were those where the band continued to explore their dynamic potential. Like \"Dark Night of the Soul\" with its dire, grooving inaugural riffs that reminded me of something Carpathian Forest might pull. Or the chants that break out in the middle of \"My Death\", perhaps the atmospheric pinnacle of the entire album. Or that majestic blend of deep percussive bombast and melodic bending that inhabits the warlike rush of \"You Must Fall\". For sheer punishment, it's hard to ignore the wealth of riffing present in \"Rape Humanity With Pride\", or the blitz of distorted bass grooves that set up the hammering entropy of \"Impious Devious Leper Lord\", which also features some clinical, creepy melodies at the half way point. I'd also be remiss not to mention the closer, the titular \"Chimera\" and its alternation between lurching rock grooves and spasms of tremolo and double bass.\n\nIt's not the best of Mayhem's albums, and admittedly, I like it the least of the four full-lengths to date. Half the songs don't really jump out at me, even when they've got 1-2 interesting riffs or sequences within. But as far as the general metal audience is concerned, who could give a shit about the raw aesthetics being heralded by most genre advocates, the production here will go a great length to compensate. This is the Mayhem album that will probably sound the best as it booms out of car speakers, pissing off parents, parishioners and high school principals. Dethklok fans will sport instant wood. It's not a record that one wishes to experience for its atmosphere, but the concrete rhythmic currents and slavish, churning Maniac vocals that drive it. It never sticks its neck out quite far enough that it's head could be chopped off, and to this extent, it's a success, although not an incredibly compelling one outside the lyrical sphere, in which it often feels the most deeply personal.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nFor Mayhem, Grand Declaration of War was THAT album. You know, the one that nearly every Norwegian band releases to the dismay of a fraction of its fanbase, provoking cries of alienation and disrespect, spurned lovers wiping tears from their eyes as they turn their backs on the present and commence endless cycles of fellatio with the past. Yes, THAT album. Sure, some might argue that this had already occurred with their previous EP, Wolfs Lair Abyss. Hell, a handful of people will tell you that they sold out on De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas, but I think at large, Grand Declaration brought a lot more change in the band's songwriting than any of their other major works. As for myself, it took a few spins to really let the album sink in, but I laud the band's ambition and experimentation here. As much as I do like it, I've never thought of De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas as a remarkable or top shelf album from this scene, so I've never had any aversion to their shifting compositional landscape.\n\nEssentially, this a grand, philosophical expos\u00e9 against Christianity, a Nietzschean rally against weakness, and I daresay a convincing argument. Maniac had decided to incorporate a wealth of spoken word passages that more clearly deliver the messages, and this was first distinction that the audience will be slapped in the face with. I rather admired the technique, it's sort of like a political and ethical speech set to metal, a Winston Churchill for the Abyss. Often these are set against a series of salacious, traditional rasped vocals for an odd effect, and I can see where this might turn some off. But if there was one gripe I actually had about Maniac's performance here, it would be the constant elevation of pitch near the end of many of his clean lines. It eventually grows a little cheesy and predictable. Where it actually comes across the most poignant is in the interlude track, \"A Broadsword and a Colder Sun (Part I of II)\", where he whispers the prose with some added distortion.\n\nBut this is not the only difference you'll find between this and the earlier albums. Blasphemer's performance is my favorite on the entire disc, and it's here that in my opinion the guy has really earned his keep with this band. Clinical, technical and incredibly dynamic, he tears along these varied courses with crisp, fulfilling tone, and it's fascinating to follow his the splicing of his rhythm tracks. There's a surgical penetration to this material that wasn't present on Wolfs Lair Abyss, and tracks like \"Crystallized Pain in Deconstruction\" and \"In the Lies Where Upon You Lay\" are saturated with superb riffs and nuances. In fact, I'd go so far that he's channeling a bit of tech thrash from the late 80s, ala Watchtower or Deathrow, and it runs marvels as a contrast to the pomp of the vocals. Probably my favorite guitars on any Mayhem album, to be honest. The rhythm section also deserves mention, particularly Hellhammer who proves he's as great at jazz or progressive rock percussion at blasting (I found Necrobutcher more interesting on Chimera).\n\nThere is yet another layer of experimentation on Grand Declaration of War, and that comes in the pair of two of the band's most eclectic cuts to date. On \"A Bloodsword and a Colder Sun (Part II of II)\" they create this mesmeric electro/industrial piece with whispered vocals, light thumps of bass and these great, fading and rising guitar patterns behind the pulse of the synthesizer. I can see half of their early 90s audience heading for hills within 30 seconds of the opening, but as a fan of all manner of electronica, I rather liked this even more than several of the metal tunes. \"Completion in Science and Agony (Part I of II)\" is another bizarre standout, a hybrid of black metal, classic doom and even some progressive rock, Hellhammer turning in beats that remind me of some of Fates Warning's stuff circa Perfect Symmetry with Mark Zonder. The vocals are freakish, a pair of arching and unnerving melodies in which Mayhem is joined by \u00d8yvind H\u00e6geland of Spiral Architect (and numerous other bands), and I really dug the minimal electroscape near the end.\n\nLike a white avian ensnared in barbwire, I found myself glued to this album's eccentricities, and took no real issue with its deviations from the predicted, or expected. Most of the larger names in extreme metal delve into the avant-garde, and Mayhem deserve some credit for doing such in a daring exhibition that no one had really tried before. Sure, progressive rock traits had been incorporated into other such albums, and spoken word passages, but never assembled with this precarious a balance. Grand Declaration of War is not perfect by any means. I've already noted how the spoken vocals can grate on the ears due to their pitch, and the guitars do not feel 100% inspired in their entirety, but nonetheless this is a curious collection of compositions that in no way plays it safe.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nIf this seems like an odd pairing for a split, then it's an even stranger listening experience. British nutters The Meads Of Asphodel have created a kind of concept EP about Islamic fundamentalists culminating in a cover of Hawkwind's 'Hassan I Shaba' that has been renamed 'Assasins Of Allah', which is fellowed by two historic black metal artefacts in the form of Dead-era Mayhem demos...\n\nThe Meads' 'Jihad' side of the split is a bold addition to their odd-ball back catalogue of demented black / punk / psychedelic / folk / medieval / whatever metal, but as with a lot of their material, seems to fall slightly short of the mark. On paper, their combination of different styles and genres presented with an almost Pythonesque look at historical conflict sounds like a winner, but all too often the band sounds like a slightly uninspired, mid-tempo not-quite-black-metal act with some obtuse field recordings chucked in. That said, they do have their moments of genius, and even at their most cringe worthy it's still inherently difficult to actively dislike this band. They definately remain interesting to listen to at any rate.\n\nMayhem's side is much, much shorter, but just bonafide classic material. If you're one of those people who consider Dead to be the archetypal black metal vocalist, I'm sure you'll leap at the chance to hear him shrieking over Freezing Moon. Whilst you all know exactly what to expect here, there's no doubting that this is definately worth the time of everyone with even a passing interest in the genre. \n\nThe problem is though, as a split, this feels very disjointed. It's as if two completely seperate EPs (or single, in Mayhem's case) have just been randomly placed together. But this is hardly a reason to complain, as the two sides can always be enjoyed for their own merits, and this weird combination of the two isn't without it's charms either. Certainly worth a listen, especially for Mayhem fans!\n",
        "\nI'm glad MA included this release despite it being a bootleg. The importance of this to the history of Mayhem and early black metal is as vital as the cover is disgusting and shocking. While 'Live In Leipzig' has a more appropriate and cool picture of Dead on the cover the sound on it is a bit thin and vocal heavy. While here you hear everything equally bad! Lol! The production is what a typical bootleg sounds like, pretty bad. LLN bad? No, not THAT bad. You hear the vocals and the intruments all on a similar level. But the ferocity sets this apart from the other recording with the classic lineup. While Maniac and Attila have their appeal and have done well fronting Mayhem for the next 20 years it still doesn't match Dead's vocals. He had it all as a black metal frontman. The intensity, the voice, attitude and most importantly THE LOOK. He was the prototypical black metal frontman. If there was a dictionary or encyclopedia that had 'black metal vocalist' a picture of Dead would most likely be next to that entry. \n\n'Deathcrush' sounds better, faster and more intense than any other version heard with Dead on vocals. I'm including 'Live In Leipzig', Zeitz (Germany), and the rehearsal in 88/90(?). Let's face it, Dead & Euronymous were Mayhem. The voice, the \"mascots\", the sound, lyrics, music, the idealogy of the band was their doing. They were the David Lee Roth/Eddie Van Halen, Lennon/McCartney, Morrissey/Johnny Marr of black metal. And the band lost them both inside the span of 30 months. It really should have ended there. But since so many metal bands go through lineup changes and some with practically complete changes (i.e. Decapitated, Vader, etc.) we tend to let it slide, but with Mayhem they get ripped for it more than any other metal band in history.\n\n'Chainsaw Gutsfuck' never sounded better than on this, it's slower and the drums are slowed down as well which is rare for Hellhammer since he likes to play the intro faster and more complex. In here he plays it exactly as Manheim played it which I prefer most and maybe Euronymous as well and possibly suggested that it be played that way too since we know Hellhammer is an excellent drummer and likes to play simple drum parts with more flair and virtuosity. But I'm a nut for the basic, hypnotic style of Manheim. The song that I have in mind the most from this is 'Carnage'. You hear Necrobutcher tuning his bass in the beginning and some rustling in the background which must be Dead and out of the blue he just screams in seemingly very genuine anger \"CARNAGE!\". No, \"this is carnage\" or \"the next song is about carnage\", nothing like that. Just a straightforward message.\n\nWhile Euronymous exaggerated and lied about Dead's attitude being \"trve and kvlt\" and \"he lived and died for the cause.\" The truth was Dead was a very fucked up, suicidal and disturbed man. Perhaps schizophrenic in that he would have random acts of violence and then just sit alone in silence. Was he dangerous to others, I don't believe so. But I am curious if he lived long enough to ever have a yoyo like Varg Vikernes cross his path. I'm certain the \"Count\" wouldn't ever want to get on his bad side. It was no act, it was real, all too real. But he never died because black metal was becoming popular and \"trendy\". He blew his head off because he simply wanted to experience death and all that possibly comes after it. He was just portraying the image of a man who was rotting, disintegrating which is why he never put on the corpsepaint to look precise or pretty. He literally was obssessed with death, dying and all of that stuff. People close to him all report the same story. He was genuine to the very end.\n\nUnfortunately there's only 8 songs on here from the Sarpsborg show, but it's status, importance and quality cannot be denied. This is a document of early black metal and a time when it was still raw, underground and dangerous. Fucking essential!\n",
        "\nIt is true that there are very few legit recordings with Dead and his tenure with Mayhem, however I personally believe that Live in Leipzig, despite being a live recording, is one of the most impressive live albums I have heard from Mayhem and in black metal and allows its listeners to experience Dead at his very best. \n\nOne noticeable trait that I noticed is that some of the songs seemed slightly slower compared to the album releases, however this added a sort of doomy, atmospheric sound to it, especially with the intro to the song Necrolust (despite it being slightly slower compared to its studio counterpart - Euronymous certainly knows how to liven the songs up with his trademark guitar speed and complexity). The track Freezing Moon is one of the most well-known songs from Mayhem and it certainly lives up to its reputation on Live in Leipzig, starting with a slow, doomy-sounding intro, then moving into its guitar-shrieking mid-section. The song concludes with an amazing guitar solo by Euronymous and the reuse the the mid-section to wrap it up.\n\nFor the drumming, Hellhammer does an impressive job keeping up with the speed with each song while adding an extra amount of complexity, favoring the use of his double kick, his crash symbol, and his high hats for multiple blast beats. Necrobutcher's bass guitar playing is easily recognizable, especially with the inclusion of the distortion for songs like \"Chainsaw Guts***\" and \"Freezing Moon\", adding a huge amount of power to back up both the guitar and drumming. The guitar playing by Euronymous is a perfect example of how Mayhem can live up to their musical reputation both in the studio and on stage. Every song on this album does not disappoint and Euronymous makes sure of that when playing at high speeds with extreme complexity and heavy distortion. Dead's vocals are by far the most impressive trait on this album, especially the use of his raspy, screeching vocals filled with hate and darkness and after listening to the first few songs, it was easy to understand how his technique became the trademark vocal style for black metal.\n\nThis album is one of the most amazing releases by Mayhem and one of the most important in its old history. If you are a fan of Mayhem and black metal, this album is highly recommended. However, for those who are concerned with the quality of the record, have no worry because it is a live album after all.\n",
        "\nMediolanum Capta Est is basically Live in Leipzig and Beyond, in that it was performed with much of the same material as the band's cult live. By this point, Mayhem still didn't have a large body of work from which to draw upon, and thus the content here is still primarily Deathcrush and De Mysteriis dom Sathanas, with a bunch of the Wolf's Lair Abyss songs added. The primary difference here is in the lineup changes: Maniac is handling the vocals in this Milan, Italy performance and Blasphemer has settled into his guitar role. So whether this is 'The True Mayhem' or 'The False Mayhem' is really up to each individual to decide, since I'm sure to some it seems the very pinnacle of blasphemy to even pay pittance to the Norwegians' continued existence.\n\nComparatively, though, I've got to hand it to Mediolanum Capta Est: it might not have that same, raw and authentic edge of Live in Leipzig or the bootleg The Dawn of the Black Hearts, but I think the sound here is a little better balanced in preservation. And then, of course, there is Maniac, who I simply find to be a more engaging front man, what with his cruel snarling diatribes and what I'd consider a more inspiring stage banter between songs, as obvious as it all might play out (perhaps less so to an Italian audience). I appreciate Dead's theatrical contributions to the whole genre, mind you, but it's Maniac and Attila that really broke me into this band through Deathcrush and DMDS, and their inflections that I prefer on the songs. That said, though, there are still a few issues with this record that hold it back from being one of the better lives in my collection: the guitars, while clear, still seem fairly repressed behind Hellhammer's pulverizing punishment and the ghastly vocals. And the bass under even that...\n\nThus, it's a little difficult to be blown over here, even if the track selection seems well rounded and the set flows well enough along. Wolf's Lair Abyss tracks like \"Fall of Seraphs\", \"Ancient Skin\", \"I Am Thy Labyrinth\" and \"Symbols of Bloodswords\" mesh rather well with the older, cruder material, not necessarily creating the sore contrast one might expect. But anyone not feeling that latest studio outing need fear nothing, since they break out \"Deathcrush\", \"Chainsaw Gutsfuck\", \"Necrolust\", \"Pure Fucking Armageddon\" and even the \"Silvester Anfang\" intro that was composed by Conrad Schnitzer. If anything, DMDS gets hamstrung here, with only two proxies in \"Freezing Moon\" and \"From the Dark Past\", but by this time I can imagine they were a little sick of performing that lot, and wished to favor the Maniac-fronted material. They also perform their compilation track \"Carnage\", which was also on Live in Leipzig, and they get Attila to join them on \"From the Dark Past\", which is frankly my favorite point of the set.\n\nHonestly, though I would recommend this over the more beloved Live in Leipzig, I cannot claim that it's in any way essential since the production doesn't really hit me with the same impact that I expect. The guitars are competent but a little washed out on most of the songs, and there's nothing all that exciting outside of maybe Hellhammer's bludgeoning consistency. Even Maniac does not sound at his most snide and raunchy here. In the end, as I would always recommend, just go pay the money to see the band if you're able. They tour often enough throughout the civilized world, but if you're not in the vicinity, then something like Mediolanum Capta Est is at least a passable replacement for the experience, if nothing special.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nAs one of the earliest instances of a proper black metal live recording, it's only natural that Live in Leipzig has developed somewhat of a cult respect among the genre's audience. It's raw, punishing and honest, and it captures one of the most infamous bands of its type during what some consider their halcyon days, between the disgusting and excellent Deathcrush EP and the forthcoming full-length debut De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas. That is correct, Mayhem had a live disc out before even one proper album. But what's probably even more appealing to many is that this is one of the more satisfactory efforts to involve the band's early vocalist Dead, who among other things was a crucial component in bringing over the whole 'corpse paint' look to the newly coined black metal genre, before killing himself in '91.\n\nI'll come right out and say that I've never been as much of a fan of Dead's voice as I have been of the sniveling Maniac or creepy Attila Csihar. It suits the music, especially this earlier material, but it's naught more than a grainy bark which often feels phoned in. It's quite 'everyman', in that I can't imagine an audience member being pulled out at random and not being able to match it. But that said, this is likely the appeal of the guy to so many fans of the band's vintage recordings. The other negative factor to Live in Leipzig is simply that the production is pretty cruddy. Yeah, it's totally authentic and sounds like a band pressing [RECORD] on the tape deck in their garage and basement. I understand the spirit behind it, and in no way is it the worst I've heard of its type, but throughout this whole album I felt like the riffs were taking a backseat to the drums and the vocals are often intolerably loud.\n\nThis can come across awkward when he's doing some lame inter-song stage banter and then the drums and guitars erupt, but there isn't really a lot happening in between tracks. Perhaps the most blood pumping intro is to \"Pure Fucking Armageddon\", which closes out the album. He at least seems to incite some reaction here. Another thing is that the guitar tone is pretty 'meh'. It definitely favors the slower material from the Deathcrush era to the later songs, where the faster flow of notes seems to be washed out by the drums, but it also rather sucks during the chug sequence of \"Necrolust\". However, this was November 1990 in a country not their own, so you sort of have to take what you can get. I can imagine that actually being there, with the severed pig heads, dirt and rotted chunks being hurled around would have proven more fulfilling.\n\nAs for track selection, you've got basically got the whole of the relevant, original material from the prior EP: \"Deathcrush\", \"Necrolust\", \"Chainsaw Gutsfuck\" and \"Pure Fucking Armageddon\" are all accounted for, in addition to the songs \"Buried by Time and Dust\", \"Funeral Fog\", \"Pagan Fears\", and \"Freezing Moon\" which would be included with the coming full-length. There's also a rare compilation track \"Carnage\" used in the set, and some versions also contain the studio version (and also a studio for \"Freezing Moon\" with Dead on vocals, if I'm not mistaken). At any rate, I've never come away from this album impressed. Like the band, and of course the track list was drawn from what must be their best material, but it sounds rather bland and I'm not that into the vocals. Live in Leipzig is loud, raucous and very 'real', but it's not one of the more compelling live records I've experienced.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nWolf's Lair Abyss was the first 'major' piece of new studio material to be released by Mayhem after the murder of Euronymous by fellow artisan of extremity Varg Vikernes, and thus it's no surprise that it is welcome with only a bittersweet reception. There exists a faction of the black metal underground which likely rues the continued output of this franchise, just as there would be with any act whose celebrity core had its candle snuffed out. Imagine INXS without Michael Hutchence. Or The Doors without Jim Morrison. Oh, wait, they both actually did that. So is it really a surprise that Mayhem would plow forward, and was it the right decision? The only one, in my estimation, who could answer that, would be Euronymous himself.\n\nBut regardless of where emotions run on this matter, Wolf's Lair Abyss exists. The band has never ceased the churning of its creative gears, as few and far between as their studio outings might have seemed for a while. This EP happened, and so did the three ensuing full-lengths that have arrived between the late 90s and today. So it's got to be judged on its merits alone, rather than on some subversive vengeance for the fallen who may or may not be aggrieved as to its actual contents and presentation. Some of the other core personalities remain in the rhythm section. Bassist Necrobutcher returned for this, and Hellhammer stayed in his drum seat. Mayhem introduced the young Rune Eriksen to the fold, who would remain through the release of Ordo Ad Chao in 2007. From a technical view, I'd say he does a decent job here, perhaps a more intensified version of the very style Euronymous was producing. His acquisition feels seamless.\n\nPerhaps the bigger surprise here was that the band reconnected with Maniac, who had provided some sick ass vocals on the band's legendary Deathcrush EP. He sounds as wretched as ever, even though I did not necessarily find the harried, blasting pace of these tracks as good a match to his suffocating rasp as the slower, earlier material. On some tunes, though, like the \"Fall of Seraphs\", both his gnarled and cleaner tones prevail. And did I mention the blasting? Because one of the most prominent characteristics of Wolf's Lair Abyss is just how much Hellhammer beats the everliving fuck out of his drum set. Seriously, his snare, bass and cymbals all tried to appeal to the local Union for their mistreatment, but there was sadly no clause for inanimate objects. That they're dialed up in the mix is one thing, but the sheer punishment this guy is meting out on \"I Am Thy Labyrinth\" and \"Fall of Seraphs\" is admittedly intimidating.\n\nUnfortunately, as fresh and violent as this music is, which feels like a steady flow of bitter effluvia after a stubborn stretch of creative constipation, it's not all that memorable. The bass is loud and atrocious, the vocals injected with the heroin heights of Maniac's personality, and it's appreciably 'extreme' enough to outpace even it's full-length predecessor. But aside from its belligerent, beatdown sheen, I did not exact much from its content. The noise/ambient intro \"The Vortex Void of Inhumanity\" with its horns and vocal samples was an interesting experiment, but not really conducive to the ensuing eruption of \"I Am Thy Labyrinth\". Almost all the riffs here seem rather predictable and uninspired, merely projected along the same course as the drumming.\n\nThere are some thrashing breaks in the material (\"Fall of Seraphs\"), and a few psychedelic, haunting streams of notation (\"Symbols of Bloodswords\"), but all in all, I've always felt like I was listening to an eerie vocal trip, a drumming tour de force, and not much else aside from guitars which feel functional at best. So, as explosive a proclamation as Wolf's Lair Abyss might seem upon initial contact, it's simply not enduring as their earlier works, nor as experimentally curious as their later full-length efforts like Grand Declaration of War. A rush of night, surely, but not one I could ever remember after the inevitable morning crash.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nAre you willing to exchange currency for slight variations of things you have already owned? Are you stuck forever in the early to mid 90s? Do you have a Mayhem hardon the size of a shadowy cathedral? These are all questions to mull over when considering a purchase of Life Eternal, which is a tape of rough mixes from the De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas sessions, originally made by Attila Csihar. If this were any lesser band, of course, something like Life Eternal would be almost guaranteed to be ignored, but Mayhem have the advantage of an almost Beatles-esque rabid following who collect bootleg recordings, rare and vintage clips and just about anything else they can get their hands on. Such is the reward for notoriety. Necrobutcher, Hellhammer and Euronymous could have recorded themselves chatting over beers at a noisy disco, or taking a piss on a camping trip while shooting the breeze, and people would pay for it.\n\nSo, at least with Life Eternal, there is some music to experience. Five cuts from the full-length album the band were about to unleash, with some altered vocals that didn't all make the final cut of the record. Side by side, there's not much of a difference in the actual music. You'll hear a click track here, where on DMDS it disappears. The guitars sound slightly more subdued than on the full-length, where they are more potent and bright. But the biggest deviation is likely in Attila Csihar's performance. The style is pretty similar, but his enunciation on several of the lines is changed. You might hear some more of his cleaner, low-end droning style than on the 'official' version of a track, and because the guitars are not as prominent here, he does stand out slightly more. There is also a brief drum intro to \"Funeral Fog\" which the band clipped off during the full length mixing and mastering, but it's all of about a second and really adds nothing...I can see why it was castrated.\n\nAll told, this is not something I really cared for. I enjoy Attila a great deal, but I'm not sure I'm willing to exchange his dialed up presence for the less resilient guitars, and even so, I never found the varied vocals to be all that more compelling than DMDS. It makes a lot of sense to me why these are not the versions on the final album, and thus it seems like no more than a means to rake in a few bucks with a limited edition release. Granted, with its DVD box packaging and other baubles, Life Eternal is a sure collectors' item, and a cool little 'peep' from Csihar's personal label Saturnus, which hasn't seemed. But for its musical value, it's a pretty vapid affair best suited to those that like to pore over the details, and in no way supercedes the quality of the tracks' inevitable evolution.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nTo deny the influence of Deathcrush upon the sum of second wave (and beyond) black metal worldwide would be like denying Elvis Presley's influence on the pompadour. It would prove too difficult to imagine one with the other, and black metal, like the vintage 50s haircut, just wouldn't be as cool without its fashionable progenitor. Now, I'm not saying that Mayhem had the 'first' black metal record on their hands with this, since bands like Venom, Hellhammer and Bathory had aesthetically beaten them to the punch there, but I think as far as most of that which would follow, this is an undeniable inspiration, the original schoolyard bully that whipped its students into a frenzy of blasphemy that has yet to subside. Deathcrush does embody all of the hostility and ugliness that the niche was intended for, and does it damnably well despite any flaws in its production or death of complexity in its crude songwriting.\n\nIf, for me, this EP is less than perfect, I can't really attribute the drawbacks to the Mayhem material itself. \"Deathcrush\" is a disgustingly excellent piece, with its punk and speed metal clamor of dire grooves and blasted dissension. Necrobutcher's bass-lines just ooze ominously from the pores of the drums and guitar, and Maniac is far too true to his stage name, perhaps the wildest of rasping metal vocalists to the EP's date and time. Honestly, I can think of only one that could compare, Quorthon himself, and Maniac STILL feels more bloody. Then there are the pair of 'necrophiliac' anthems: \"Chainsaw Gutsfuck\" with it's slower paced, bass-driven wrath, and its sibling \"Necrolust\", which starts at a similar speed but then picks up into raw, chaotic sewage so goddamn calamitous that it's a wonder Maniac can still ride atop its primordial mass. Like some ancient jockey who scored himself a woolly mammoth, its flanks pocked by spears and their resultant viscera. Then, of course, there is \"Pure Fucking Armageddon\", which explodes out of its opening bass-warp and feedback into a riff that makes you want to mosh the fucking devil under the dirt. Those first vocal lines (by Messiah) are among the more menacing I've ever heard in the whole genre...\n\nBut where Deathcrush threatens to dissemble is in its balance of entrails wrenching black metal with the remainder of its content. \"Silvester Anfang\", a marching percussive intro which the band scored out of correspondence with electronica legend Conrad Schnitzler of Tangerine Dream, might function as a dire portent of cadence, but it really doesn't flow into the title track, and I can't help but feel that something more effectively transitory would have just KILLED this motherfucker. The cover of Venom's Witching Hour (Welcome to Hell, 1981) is brutal and messy enough to fit in with their original tunes, but I found myself caring for nothing more than the vocals, through which Maniac manages to make Cronos seem like Tony Bennett by comparison. Also, \"(Weird) Manheim\", while a somewhat creepy intro piece with warped piano effects, just doesn't flow for me into \"Pure Fucking Armageddon\".\n\nThese ideas of using martial ambient and scary acoustic sounds to flesh out and diversify the track list are certainly influential, and it became a tradition for black metal bands to utilize the 'intros' with synthesized and orchestrated keys and strings, but here on Deathcrush they just don't work for me all that much. Had this been constrained to just the four original metal tunes, I'd find it difficult to find any fault to it. The riffs might not all be memorable, but the general atmosphere of Mayhem was fucking infallible, and the songs, despite their innate, rough and tumble amateur transitional ability, are all classics in their own right...still some of my favorites from this particular band.\n\nI think it's also important to distinguish that Deathcrush, while archetypal for so many other acts to follow, is not necessarily prototypical to Mayhem. This is not as structured as De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas by a long shot, nor is the musicianship and experimentation anywhere in range of their later works like Chimera or Ordo ad Chao. In fact, outside of the intros, this really isn't experimental whatsoever. These songs are about the attitude. The filth. Pissing in the cereal of all who would welcome offense. The lyrics are perverse, especially for the corpse copulation hymns \"Chainsaw Gutsfuck\" and \"Necrolust\". These offer a distinctly death metal aesthetic to the recording, and yet that too was a formative genre at this point. Cannibal Corpse hadn't even got out their first full-length yet. Certainly no \"Meat Hook Sodomy\" or \"Entrails Ripped from a Virgin's Cunt\" on the public conscience in 1987. We were all still shocked by Slayer.\n\nJudging such an indisputably important record as this one is not easy. For one, I actually admire that the band were big enough Tangerine Dream fans to enlist Conrad to contribute the intro. What an honor that must have been! But as far as \"Silvester Anfang\" itself, I fail to see what it adds to the record outside of maybe a brief, 'military' component that jives with the title (which conjures images of tanks, certainly). \"(Weird) Manheim\" I could just do without, and had these two pieces been omitted or replaced with something more fitting or abusively flush with the ensuing hellfire, I might rank Deathcrush a little higher. Regardless of this minor nitpicking, the record is still a classic, and though I like all of their later full-length efforts to varying degrees, I could never justly prioritize any of them over this martyr of moral corrosion. I mean, I love Attila and all, but really...Maniac...better than Elvis.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nLet me start by remarking that I\u2019m no Mayhem fan. In fact, I disrespect Necrobutcher and Hellhammer for reviving Mayhem in 95. Shitting on the legacy and legends of Dead and Euronymous by turning Mayhem into a commercial and mainstream metal band; Euronymous must be revolting and rumbling in his grave since this happened. Back then the music of Mayhem was in my opinion good, what they do now is average and completely overrated. (To avoid confusion to the dimwitted masses, I hate Burzum too).\nHere we have in my opinion one of the only two Mayhem recordings worth owning, the other being The Dawn of the Black Hearts; the reason for this is simple: DEAD!!! \n\nThe band performs two of their best known songs, recorded with the legendary line-up in a proper studio. This time you can really appreciate the abilities of the band as musicians. Euronymous\u2019 tremolo picking, Necrobutcher\u2019s pissed off distorted bass, Hellhammer\u2019s true blasting and most importantly the mighty legend, the myth, the original walking corpse painted freak, Dead. \n\nThe guitar tone is thin and eerie, sounds like bee swarm coming to sting you to death. The distorted bass creates a rumble in the background, the marching boots of a host of demons coming to claim you. The drums are a very antique and primitive war machine; perhaps a small tank to slaughter small villages, with rocket launchers and everything (cymbals). \n\nThe vocals are mid toned ghastly grunts or growls slightly on the high pitch end. Sinister, sick, possessed. Very\u2026 freaky. If I would\u2019ve heard this at age 9 or 10 I would\u2019ve probably shit myself, had nightmares and all kinds of weird crazy shit going on in my head. This very rare recording is the perfect example of why Mayhem were who they were during the late 80\u2019s and early 90\u2019s. Here you can actually appreciate the evil musical genius of Euronymous and the truly demonic vocals of Dead in all it\u2019s infamous and pompous glory and splendor.\n\nUnlike the aforementioned live recording, everything is distinguisible yet retains the dirty garage sound of the demo tapes recorded back then. I dare to say this is the best Mayhem recording of their career. Also the best performance or versions of Freezing Moon and Carnage out there, these are the originals, the true ones, the ones that made those songs anthems for black metalheads like yours truly. The true one and only jewel of the Mayhem catalog, actually buried and forgotten in time by layers of bone and dirt and dust and forsaken just in the memory of few demo tape and bootleg collectors since they never surfaced in a proper formal release, only as a demo tape as a promo sent to different zines and labels before Deathlike Silences came to be. \n\nNowadays only available in different bootlegs available in the market, most notably \u201cTribute to the Black Emperors\u201d split with Morbid (Dead\u2019s old death metal band from Sweden like most people know) By the way, Morbid's side of the split is their December Moon demo with Dead on vocals too.\n\nSome label should release this on vinyl or CD (or both!!) and make it available so to preserve these invaluable jewels and milestones of the curse of mental illness known to man as Black Metal.\n",
        "\nMayhem. Any self-respecting black metal fan knows the story of Mayhem. The whole deal with Dead's suicide and Euronymous's murder, but I know a lot of Mayhem fans who haven't heard this demo. This is Mayhem humble beginnings.\n\nI'm going to tell it like it is. If you don't feel the crappy quality vibe that a lot of black metal bands use, this demo will absolutely suck to you. It's probably the worst quality I've ever heard, except maybe for some Ulver stuff. This quality absolutely sucks. And I can see why it would turn some people off. On the other hand, I have no problem with horrible quality, so I appreciate this demo. It truly is pure fucking armageddon. You can make out the riffs and the pounding of the snare in the background. On this demo, the songs sound a lot alike because of the sound quality and have the same basic formula. The riffs are actually pretty decent, although crazy primitive. Unfortunately, the drums are basically just pounding the snare and the bass drum the whole time. As for Euronymous's vocals.. they aren't great, but you can't hear them unless you try, so it's nothing to worry about. The bass is also very prominent and good.\n\nThis demo has some awesome riffs and songs that will be remembered. The sound quality is terrible, and they sound like a bunch of pissed off teenagers, but it's a solid demo with some good guitar and bass work. If you can get ahold of it, I would recommend it, but don't go searching for hours.\n",
        "\nMayhem gets a lot more flak than they deserve, it seems that a lot of individuals think the band only gets attention because of the particular incidents surrounding its band members. However, the group was by no means untalented, and the music (at least the first few releases) slays.\n\nDeathcrush, their first EP, is a clear example of how much influence Mayhem took from groups like Celtic Frost, Bathory, Venom, etc. It's not the black metal that most would recognize -- that sound wouldn't really come into play until DMDS, many years later. This release is 18 and a half minutes of no-holds-barred blackened thrashy metal, but a lot fits into that short length of time.\n\nThis is not the \"classic\" Mayhem lineup. At this time, there was no Dead or Hellhammer. The original drummer, Manheim, still sat behind the skins, and Mayhem was still using two \"session\" vocalists. Euro and Necro rounded out the rest of the group for this release, and they do not disappoint.\n\nSo where to begin? The first track, \"Silvester Anfang,\" is an intro piece borrowed from Conrad Schnitzler of Tangerine Dream, showing a level of avant-garde. The martial electronic drumming creates a sense of forboding, leading the listener to press on.\n\nThe title track is up next. Killer riffing, killer thrashy breaks, and what sounds like blasting from time to time. The lyrical matter is gruesome, like a few of the other songs on here. Maniac, despite all the hating for later works, is on top of his game here vocally\n\nChainsaw Gutsfuck needs no introduction. Gruesome lyrics by far. Killer bass intro, which really leads to a mid-paced groove underneath Maniac's (admittedly easier to decipher) spitting out of unholy lines. Listen to the opening drum beat -- more of the martial tendencies we saw in the intro track, and that particular beat comes up before the third verse(?). About 2:40 in, the fast thrashy break kicks in, replete with blasting, and what sounds like a quick maniacal (see what I did there?) solo by Euronymous. As quickly as it starts, we go back into the groove, where the song ends. This track is one of the heavier of the album, and a morbid pleasure to listen to.\n\nThe next track, Witching Hour, is a cover by some obscure English group named Venom. As far as covers go, they can be either hit or miss, you can either ape the original artist completely, or put your own spin on it. When you put this track on, hold on to your balls. After some ominous bass tones, the band absolutely tear into the track, I would say twice as fast as the original. But what makes this track particularly memorable is the use of Messiah on vocals. Messiah, in my opinion, was terribly underused on this album. While Maniac seems content to scream to his heart's desire, Messiah's vocals seem to take inspiration from Sodom and/or Celtic Frost (including the uh's). The lyrics are spat out rapid-fire, but always intelligible. Maniac makes a few brief appearances here, mostly providing screams. There is another quick solo in the middle of the song, but the song's speed is the more important part.\n\nNecrolust was a song I always overlooked. A few more listens makes me wonder why I didn't think of it more. Heavy, with more mid-paced riffing, and the thrash elements are more prounounced -- I could see a group like Slayer or Megadeth covering this with ease. Maniac's singing is a lot more understandable here, with rapid-fire delivery reminiscent of the previous song. Once again, thrashy breaks and absolutely insane drumming from Manheim. The longest track on the album, but Mayhem fills up the time with memorable moments, including another atonal frantic solo by Euro.\n\nThe next two tracks would best be combined into one, and are in the copy I have. (Weird) Manheim is another ominous little instrumental, which sounds like either bass and piano or just piano. Like its name would suggest, it is a weird little ditty, but leads seamlessly into the next and final track (on some releases). Pure Fuckin' Armageddon is a short (2 minutes or so) tour de force of black thrash. Messiah returns to the microphone for this track, Euronymous shreds, Necro is somewhere in the mix, and Manheim alternates flawlessly between mid-paced grooving and primitive (but effective) blasting. Heavy, quick, and destructive. Still a classic, even after all these years.\n\nThere is an outro on some copies, which I have only heard on YouTube. It shows that Mayhem has a sense of humor, and isn't really afraid not to take themselves seriously. And really, early Mayhem was all about not taking themselves seriously, so this is a good fit.\n\nThe unsung hero of this album is Necrobutcher. Not the drunken buffoon we know and love from modern times, this is his album to shine, providing a solid foundation for Euronymous' riffs and Manheim's absolute crushing drumming. \n\nA lot of \"what-ifs\" can be asked after listening to this album, but to me, this is still one of the heaviest of its time, and its influence can still be heard today.\n\n10/10\n",
        "\nThe beginning song, The Vortex Void of Inhumanity reminds me of a King Diamond intro to an album. A collection of weird, bizarre noises, from lasers to trumpets, with the nefarious line \"Militant men in peaceful times attack themselves!\" However, you should forget this, this has nothing to do with the EP. This is just a prelude to the great things to come!\n\n\"I am thy labyrinth\" is my favorite song on this EP. The amazing drum fill in the beginning sets off a amazing tempo, forcing you to bang your head (I prefer windmill). Simple, menacing axe work, (The cliche E to F, to E to E flat) somehow creates a atmosphere that demands respect, and gives goosebumps. Maniac's vocals are insane, rasping and gargling like one who has been cut in the throat! The drummer (he must be ripped) pumps inhuman double-bassing and blast beats, adding further to the evil feeling. What really impresses me is the poignant, lyrics. They explore the concept of life, and try to comprehend many things ordinary mortals cannot. If there was no music, then one might have confused the lyrics as a article from a philosopher's book! The bridge is stunning, with a voice-over as Maniac screams the same shit along with the narrator.\n\n\"Fall of Seraphs.\" Again, intelligent lyrics impress me. Much more complicated riffs, but still an awesome atmosphere compel me totally! Maniac's voice here reminds me of Harry Potter using that stupid snake-language crap, but it still sounds insane! The song structure is more organized and complex, and Maniac is screaming his heart out, while using his creepy narrator voice again in utter agony. The drums really shine in this particular work. Another perfect song.\n\n\"Ancient Skin.\" Woohoo, more cryptic lyrics to contemplate and ponder about! By now, you should have realized that this EP is not something you can easily digest. It is not a guitar album, it isn't a drums album, it isn't even a lyrics album, it was just meant to head-bang until your wimpy head falls off. The entire work is meant to show the band's talent as a whole, forcing you to take in the amount of awesomeness all at once, that you might overlook some minor details such as a cool drum fill or solo there, but if you aren't head-banging, something is wrong with you.\n\n\"Symbols of Blood Swords.\" For the last time, amazing, awesome lyrics! The crushing drums, the decapitating guitar and bass, and Maniac make this a essential record to listen to. EP? Forget that simple term. Treat this 5-track masterpiece as a album, because it has all of the qualities of a kick ass magnus opus.\n",
        "\nI don't need to give a history lesson on Mayhem. Any metalhead worthy of his title knows about the infamous Mayhem. The main issue about this band, and this EP, is fanboyism. Are fan boys really going to defend their favorite band due to favoritism or defend it because it's good? Well, let's hope it's favoritism, because Deathcrush sucks.\n\nThe vocals might be the most atrocious part about this album. Well, the guitars may be equally matched with that title. The vocals are a bunch of screams, so it's not really singing anyway. Had I not been looking at the lyrics I would've had no clue that words were supposed to be sung. The first time I ever heard \"Chainsaw Gutsfuck\", which came on randomly a few years back when I was listening to music, I didn't know words were supposed to be there. I thought it was gonna be intense, but I sat there thinking \"What the hell was that shit?\". Four years pass from that day and I finally found out they were trying to say something. I can only slightly bare \"Pure Fucking Armageddon\" since it's the only song were those god awful screams aren't used, but that doesn't make those vocals any better. \n\nThe lyrics on Deathcrush are very weak. For example, \"Bleed down to the fucking core, You're going down for fucking more, Screw your slimy guts, Driving me fucking nuts\", that's from \"Chainsaw Gutsfuck\". I don't normally point out weak lyrics, but this EP is full of them so I felt it was necessary. The overuse of \"fucking\" just shows how uncreative it is to have written this song. Also, rhyming \"guts\" with \"nuts\" is very kindergarten and in a black metal song a line using the phrase \"Driving me fucking nuts\" just doesn't fit... at all. Or how about: \"A life that soon won't be\"? There's more they could've done than to use that bad line. Then we have some lyrics that try to sound extreme, which is pretty much the whole album. They use adjective like slimy to describe a grave. That makes as much sense as the line \"My brain is driving me insane\". Some of the content in the lyrics has been done before. The whole necrophilia thing was never \"hardcore\" and never will be. The whole EP may have been better if Mayhem worked more on the lyrics. It seems like other bands had no issue writing more grotesque lyrics than Mayhem.\n\nThe instrumentation is pretty absolute shit. The drums are irrelevant to the whole mix. It sounds similar to that of a child having a tantrum whilst banging on anything around them with drum sticks. The guitar is, well, I have no clue. I understand the whole small-time band poor-recording quality issue, but honestly the quality wasn't all that bad yet the guitar still sounded like gargled shit. I have no clue what Euronymous was doing but it sounded like he was just hitting anything on half the tracks. The only exceptions are \"Silvester Anfang\", when he doesn't even play, and \"(Weird) Manheim\", the only good track on the album; note that \"(Weird) Manheim\" is an instrumental track. When Euronymous is actually hitting something like on \"Chainsaw Gutsfuck\" it isn't all that impressive. The stuff played is pretty repetitive too. The solos, I think there's at least one or two, are terrible from what little you hear of them. The solos sound shoved to the back of the mix along with the bass. It does little to surprise me that the bass is in the back. It's pretty common.\n\nThe song structures on Deathcrush are very simplistic. It follows a verse-chorus-verse structure almost the whole EP. The band does, unnecessarily, stop the playing for a second or two just to play something faster. They do this a lot and it's not innovative nor does it make wanna prepare my headbang. It shows when they really ran out of creativity. Some bands can make simplicity and simple structures work, but Mayhem could't do that here. \n\nI'm not too certain whether or not there was supposed to be an atmosphere or mood on this EP. It seems too much of a complex idea for Mayhem at this point in their career.\n\nIt's a good thing Mayhem picked up the animal heads on posts, throwing raw meat into the crowd, a series of dead band mates, and other various shanannigans because there's no way this could've propelled such an infamy. Well, maybe an infamy of shit had they kept quality dumps like this churning out every year. Despite all fanboyism, which I thought would've actually been good this time, proved wrong. It seems the history of the band seems to shine more than this EP.\n",
        "\n\"Woeful people with pale faces \nStaring obsessed at the moon \nSome memories will never go away \nAnd they will forever be here\"\n\nPortraying the ungovernable raging force of darkness and the frightening reality of a grim end requires an artist's imagination perceptive of those particular features of existence in order to form powerful, representative shapes reflecting the responsive horror and dread of a human soul, and the intuitive insight capable of grasping the universal purpose of these dark realities, communicated in the ripping voice and violent terror that defines the sound of the transcendent music of cold black nothingness. Ominous legends of destructive power and evil, Mayhem destroys the commonalities of classic heavy metal in a process of sinister reassembly in shattered forms of its defining components, plunging the rearranged formation into the black abyss of human torment and fear, shredding all unfounded ideas toward pretense and glory in a shredding execution of hardcore-style abrasive motion intensified to the extreme of human speed and stamina. Lacerating riffs and fascinatingly inventive melodies in the speeding tremolo technique simultaneously assault and possess the listener in a relentless streaming determination toward the void of death... or \"Life Eternal\". Mesmerizing dissonant lead guitar from the deranged conceptual dreams of Euronymous screams for the beyond in anxious events of strikingly articulate expressions of desolate wandering and mournful yearning. Piercing and stunningly captivating, the guitar work on this album elevates a standard of desecrating nocturnal descent and nihilistic reduction in underground metal, in deceptively involved rhythmic combinations of inexorable, lawless, devastating riffs, dictating adversarial rhythmic constructions formed from severe, frenzied warping of traditional heavy metal and hardcore styles, and grounded in barbarian Hellhammer's coldly surgical and commandingly decisive performance of annihilative, simplistic percussive demolishing.\n\n\"Everything here is so cold \nEverything here is so dark \nI remember it as from a dream \nIn the corner of this time\"\n\nThe disturbed yet penetratingly aware thoughts of Dead are given a dynamic, wildly eccentric voice by Attila Csihar, an apparent lunatic whose tonally dramatic, provoking and distinctive vocal approach is ultimate in delivery and imaginative in arrangement. Not as haunting as Dead's enigmatic screaming, Attila's voice grates and unsettles through mid-line fluctuations of expressive tone, like a ceremony to ponder varying degrees of emotional impact rendered by the given subject, entirely severe and displeasing in tone, as it should be, and curiously meditative in articulation. These vocals are mostly preposterously maniacal and intensely confrontational, but in a few select places, particularly during the closing title-track, Attila's fearlessly theatrical singing expresses a mournfully reverent quality through chant-like ceremonial laments of a distinctly imperial character, evoking a strange aura of the esoteric against the unforgiving, dark and furious music.\n\n\"A dream of another existence \nYou wish to die \nA dream of another world \nYou pray for death to release the soul \nOne must die to find peace inside \nYou must get eternal\"\n\nThe production enhances atmospheric presence through an organic quality of cave-like instrumental resonance, which is given reasonable clarity and distinction in the sound, with notable features being the powerful presence of thundering sound supplied to Hellhammer's drums, and the definitively 'necro' tone of the guitars, which radiates a certain merciless frigidity. This cold and lifeless guitar tone is undeniable, and when mysteriously beautifully streaming and nostalgic melodies gradually emerge and take form through this tone in vividly harsh riffs, the sublime effect of dark beauty is inescapable. Speeding currents of detonating riffs conspire with pulverizing, slow cryptic reductions to awe and terrify in aberrantly defiling songs of simplistic, familiar structure, balancing each attribute of pattern definition toward its hope-crushing antagonism. This is a direct reflection of the thematic concentration, which is an exploration of those ideas condemned by the common mindset as 'evil' and 'dark', natural forces (nocturnal coldness) and oppositional thought processes (Antichrist) that threaten the established social order. These considerations are given a decidedly abstract and obscure character of expression framed in an archaic and primitive sound-picture; secret knowledge ascertained only by the authentically investigative and passionate spirits, denying the weak need of obviousness in artistic tangibility. In the simple formations of these savage, grisly, instinctual riffs of indefinite chaos, there is a tenebrous world of discovery into which one must enter and explore to ever grasp a complete understanding of the meaning of this darkly beautiful and violently alienated music known as black metal.\n",
        "\nNot that it's necessarily possible to 'objectively' review any work of music to a fault, but when you're up against something with the wealth of history of a De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas, there are even more considerations than usual. This is an album loaded with infamy, for reasons obvious to everyone. I mean, one of the members of the band killed another member. Churches were burned. Angels cried, and devils laughed their hooves off. Somewhere, a kitten or puppy was probably crushed, but nobody noticed. But let's look at the more 'positive' elements to its construction and release: it was fundamental to the careers of some of the most prominent figures in all of the black metal genre, considered so even in today's world.\n\nThere is really no comparable lineup to that of Mayhem's full-length debut, and there will perhaps never be. Sure, as far as individual talents are concerned, such collaborations have existed, but not with this level of name dropping. You had the band's leader/writer, the late \u00d8ystein Aarseth (Euronymous) on guitars. Jan Axel Blomberg (Hellhammer), drummer for many well known projects, handing out one of the most voracious beatings of his entire career. Varg Vikernes (Burzum), the most loved and hated individual in the entire genre, was bringing up the bass end. The prolific Attila Csihar slathering his unique, grimy vocals all over the rush of the rhythms. Perhaps the least noteworthy individual on the album is other guitarist, Snorre Ruch (known here as Blackthorn), but even this is a man whose underground credibility is well known due to his creation Thorns, which is perhaps the most recognized cult industrial/black metal act to date. Fuck, had they just added Fenriz on the cowbell, the record might have simply exploded, never to be experienced by mortal ears.\n\nYes, every time I read through that roster, I find it staggering to say the least, but it wouldn't mean a damn thing to me if the music wasn't there to back it up. So, does it add up? For the most part, yes, but in some ways, not. De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas is a highly divisive album, and understandably so, because all manner of personal opinions and investment in the history of its members will always rise to the fore, influencing the emotions of the listener. But in reality, it's just a very tight, solid black metal record that may very well be the best representation of the 'generic' album of its class. There is very little variation woven through the writing, and most of the tracks spend 5-6 minutes blazing through the same 2-3 hooks. About the only element that distinguishes it from the tens of thousands of albums to follow in direct worship would be the vocals of Csihar, which trade in the predictable rasping for a more ghoulish tone, as if some pale aberration were retching all over the carefully packaged contents of the rhythm section.\n\nThere was another album around this time that cast a similar shadow: Transilvanian Hunger, one of Darkthrone's numerous masterworks. Both albums are extremely straightforward, with very few surprises hidden amongst the pacing: blast beats and repetitious riffing. I would say that Fenriz and friends easily win out by comparison, because the songs are so much more raw, cutting and effective, with enough character that they completely overcome their perceived flaws. But De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas does feature a few elements you won't find there. I already mentioned the vocals. For another, the bass is much louder, an integral ballast to the forceful momentum of each track. This creates a more tangible, if less haunting emanation. The drums are likewise much stronger than Darkthrone. Blomberg is unquestionably considered the 'greatest' of black metal drummers, more through his history and projects than a technical measurement, but he's a living storm with Mayhem, just not one that kicks up much out of the ordinary. Surely, his work here is a template for the many thousands to follow, but I found his performance here more efficient than interesting.\n\nThe lyrics are actually quite simple. Dark images pandering to the most generic of concepts, like vampires, the occult, heresy, and of course that age old standby: death. They're rarely poetic or especially insightful, and they don't conjure up images beyond the expected, but I have to say that ultimately, they service the music quite well, even though so much of it moves at the same relative pace. But when you've got Attila involved, you can take even the most pedestrian and predictable of ideas and squeeze something memorable from them, and that is exactly what happens, as the prim prose is wielded like a cautionary parable from a perverse prophet of the shadows. A lecher. An unpleasant individual that is more apt to smell your blood from the pulpit and lick its lips than offer you the blood of Christ. I actually wish more bands had adhered to a style like this, perhaps not with the same impoverished tonality, but just given their style more character. As it stands, too many have fallen to the belabored rasping camp.\n\nAlmost all of the eight songs are straight charges, and all incorporate blasting in at least some capacity. That isn't to say they are completely monotonous, for many of the tracks do have slower bridges where the eeriness of the proceedings is amplified, like the spacious, droning segue which bisects \"Freezing Moon\", or the brazen tremolo picking meets Black Sabbath breakdown in \"From the Dark Past\". The most intense of the compositions is \"Buried by the Time and Dust\", which brakes for no myth or man, but fails to become dull thanks to Attila's incipient lunatic raving and the subtle twists in notation that Ruch and Euronymous evoke. But my favorites are probably \"Pagan Fears\", with its compelling, rocking motions, or \"Cursed in Eternity\", of which the rhythms remind me of Emperor's epic In the Nightside Eclipse, sans the symphonic elements. \"Funeral Fog\" and the closing, savage title track represent the next best crop of material.\n\nDe Mysteriis Dom Sathanas does suffer from a small degree of bloat, but that being the case, I still find it myself able to listen through all 46 minutes without complaining. The dark bombast of the album's low end rhythm mechanics provides enough of a fascinating foundation for Attila. The production in general is quite good for the time, especially compared to something with a shadier sound, like the early Immortal albums (which I enjoy for their own reasons). All told, I have never felt the same pining for this as I do for Ablaze in the Northern Sky, Det Som Engang Var, In the Nightside Eclipse, Pentagram, or Frost. I feel like its all too easy to let the roster speak for itself and sway the judgment of quality, but in fact, the music here is just not that impressive beyond the consistency of its delivery. Whereas most of those aforementioned records are brimming with astute evil or majesty through their very building blocks, this album always felt like it was relying on Csihar to perform the sacrificial rites, which he does. Mayhem had a very good album on their hands here, perhaps great, and it's one of a kind as far as their own discography, but personally I've never found it a top of the line experience.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nOkay the only point of this review is to deter people from getting sucked in and buying this album. I bought this for $2.99 at a used record store and upon listening to it the whole way through, I became infuriated and felt that I had been robbed. I blame myself, it's my own stupidity for not realizing what this is. U.S. Legions is nothing more than a guise to make money off of a name. \n\nThere is nothing of any redeeming quality on this album. The live tracks are played decently, Blasphemer's guitar is loud and up front right where it needs to be. I don't have a problem with his playing he does a good job. Hellhammer's drums sound awful. The whole kit is triggered and the whole time this is playing all you hear is CLICK CLICK CLICK. His toms sound like plastic tubs being whacked with sticks. \n\nManiac's voice is as annoying as ever, he really is the worst vocalist Mayhem ever had. He sounds like a cat being thrown into a fireplace. Maniac's clean singing is fucking horrible, he sounds like a second rate Marilyn Manson wannabe. Thanks to the production Necrobutcher's bass has been almost completely buried beneath the wall of guitars. \n\nThe set list is the usual stuff full of cuts from, Wolf's Lair Abyss, Deathcrush, and Pure Fucking Armageddon,. There are a couple of songs from the abortion that was Grand Declaration of War included too. The band seems to mail in their performance here, even the crowd doesn't seem that into it. That rock jam thing that Hellhammer and Blasphemer do in the beginning of \u201cChainsaw Gutsfuck' is a sacrilege, it's totally unnecessary. \n\nI am amazed that nothing from the seminal De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas album made it into the set list. I mean, at least play 'Freezing Moon'. Also, there is no 'Deathcrush' either. Those two songs are staples in their live set and there omission just makes this album that much more useless. \n\nNow, put onto the end of the live set are a few pre-production tracks from the Grand Declaration of War sessions. This is what made me purchase this album in the first place. See, I thought that maybe these songs would be different than the songs that made it onto the album. Nope, damn I can be such an idiot sometimes. These songs are exactly the same, it's just that the production is a lot more muffled. \n\nThis is probably the most useless CD I have in my collection. Mayhem has released way better live albums. Take for instance classics like, Dawn of the Black Hearts, Live in Zeitz, and Live in Leipzig. Even Mediolanum Capta Est are way better than this trash. I guess if your a completest than your going to pick this up. Otherwise avoid this like the plague.\n",
        "\nIf you know anything about black metal, you will undoubtedly have heard of Mayhem and their supposed classic \u201cDe Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\u201d. The hype surrounding this album and the people involved in creating it is phenomenal, reaching almost cult levels of fanaticism. Now I can\u2019t help but ask myself, what the hell is it all for?\n\nThis album is probably the greatest disappointment I have encountered in all my metal life. These are seven of the most repetitive, tone-deaf miss-compositions ever to befall my ears from any genre. I simply cannot understand why anyone would pretend to enjoy \u201cDe Mysteriis\u2026\u201d, other than because of the controversy surrounding it, and if that is the case it all seems like a juvenile bore to me.\n\nNow, before this begins to sound like a rant, I should mention that there is a modicum of talent present on the album, in the form of Euronymous and Hellhammer. The guitars and drums are the only noteworthy elements, salvaging this raucous joke from a sub-10% rating. Euronymous wrote some decent riffs here, making his untimely passing all the more tragic. One can only imagine what great things he could have done for the genre had he been surrounded by other talented musicians. There are many memorable sections on the album, showing his prodigal black metal vision. His slow power chords and excellent tremolo riffs would resonate in the genre for years to come. \n\nHellhammer showed much promise very early in his career with \u201cDe Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\u201d. The many double-times and excellent blast-beats feel almost prophetical of the great heights he would later reach as a black metal legend. Sadly, however, this is as far as positive aspects of this album go. \n\nAttila Csihar is a well-known name in extreme metal. He has had many notable vocal performances with talented bands such as Anaal Nathrakh, Keep of Kalessin and Aborym. One wouldn\u2019t have predicted this, listening to \u201cDe Mysteriis\u2026\u201d back in 1994, however. The vocals on this album are probably the main factor contributing to my disdain for it. It is a pitiful mess. Half the time he simply recites the lyrics in a rhythm completely mismatched to the music, to the point where one wonders if he was even in the same studio at all. The rest of the vocals are a horribly constipated gargle so torturous that I couldn\u2019t bear the whole duration of the album, having given up listening to it by track 3 the first time around. It gets particularly painful around the 2:00 mark on \u201cLife Eternal\u201d. \n\nThe fact that Hellhammer lowered Varg\u2019s bass after the all-too-publicized murder is barely noticed, because the bass is actually quite prominent on most of the tracks, but that\u2019s more of a curse than a blessing, really. The bass just makes the noise more indistinct with reverberating notes inharmoniously punctuating the music and ruining whatever good the guitars and drums were doing. \n\nI suppose this album was very scary and impressive in 1994, but I urge whoever listened to it at the time of its release to give it another go. This time, ignore all nostalgia about the excitement it caused when you first heard it, ignore all the controversy and hype, and ignore the elitist opinion. Turn your attention to the music alone. Then rejoice for all the choice we have today, and thank God that black metal doesn\u2019t sound like this anymore. \n\nI\u2019m certain the initial effect of \u201cDe Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\u201d was profound. I\u2019m sure everyone was very proud to be so dark as to be listening to a group of murdering, neo-nazi extremists. Today, however, there\u2019s just so much more out there. Amidst all the excellent black metal that released after 1994, this simply isn\u2019t good enough anymore. The production is praised undeservedly, with over-distorted guitars and irritating effects, over-accentuated drums and bass and an overall unpleasant noise, casting an unfortunate shadow over the decent guitar- and drumwork. Half of the musicians were untalented, and all of the hype was unnecessary.\n\nIf this wasn\u2019t such a revered album, so widely recommended, I would have stopped listening 3 minutes after it began. Since it is, I held on, trying to see the point, waiting for it to get better. It doesn\u2019t. The highlight is the minute before Attila opens his mouth on every song. Do your hearing a favor, and write this album off for what it is, a pointless waste.\n",
        "\nLike most things, the correct appraisal of this album is somewhere in the middle- it's neither a complete, inadvisable misstep for Mayhem nor a brilliant, forward-thinking masterpiece. However, I will say that it's significantly closer to the latter than the former, and though I'm loathe to use this argument, I would say that in many cases the album's detractors are significantly missing the point of the release. A discussion of why most poor opinions of this album are incorrect will actually tell you just what it is better than anything, so let's go on:\n\nThis is absolutely not 'De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas', nor is it in any sense of the word a traditional black metal album. Hell, calling it not black metal at all would be somewhat questionable but not entirely out of the ballpark of possibility. There's blast beats, some tremolo riffs, and some screeching vocals, but that's where the proximity to black metal really ends, and everything else on this album seems stitched together out of whole cloth. What the hell could the influences this album draws from be? Yes, electronic and industrial music is one of them, but not as great as one might think (contrary to popular belief, a single short trip-hop track does not in and of itself constitute 'trip-hop influences' on the level of the album); if Thorns' only full length album had been released a few years previous to this one, it would be an obvious candidate, but its 2001 release date puts it out of the scope of possibility. Early Thorns, however, is definitely one, as would some of the other strange outliers of the Norwegian black metal scene, but overall, 'Grand Declaration Of War' is one of the few albums where I can say that much of its content seems to spring entirely from itself rather than others. Regardless of your opinion on the release, it was, and continues to be, quite unique.\n\nOther reviewers have suggested that this was Mayhem's attempt to fully change black metal in the way that 'De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas' arguably did, and I'd say this is a distinct possibility: 'Grand Declaration Of War' is massively (and in many cases to a fault) forward-thinking and 'progressive', and you can see in the songs that Mayhem did their best to avoid anything approximating 'normal' black metal. Mayhem was on this release clearly attempting to sound ahead of their time, which comes through hugely on how dated much of the material on this album sounds; a decade later, there are moments here which are distinctly cringe-inducing with the benefit of hindsight, but at the same time, I can't help but admire the balls it took to write and record something like this as a sophomore full-length album, particularly for a band like Mayhem which could have easily written 'De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas' part two and still rolled in money. You have to respect the kind of nerve it takes to write something so unfriendly and possibly poisonous to their fanbase.\n\nI don't think there's a single 'normal' riff on this album; as much of a self-aggrandizing douchebag as Blasphemer might be, he most certainly pulled out all the stops on this album to make it sound as alien and unlike anything else in metal as possible. Few of the riffs are straightforward tremolo are thrash numbers, and those that are are envenomed by a completely peculiar and off-kilter sense of mischievous, demonic melody, the sort of thing the cyberdemon in 'Doom' would play if his left hand wasn't occupied by a rocket launcher. Flurries of arpeggiated chords are tucked into streams of tremolo or thrash rhythms, and even the thrashier sections are corrupted by strange, non-intuitive rhythms as well as more typical, rocklike ones. The actual structure of the riffs is a marvel; mostly non-repeating and extremely long in musical terms, the melodies go places that black metal rarely does and are thoroughly written to an extent almost unheard of in extreme metal. Say what you will about the quality of the riffs, but they're some of the most ambitious I've heard.\n\nThe quality of the riffs varies considerably; unlike a lot of people I find some of them perfectly hummable, the rockish main riff that pops up throughout the opening track being a major one, with isolated other instances existing elsewhere. They're extremely technical throughout and merge very well with Hellhammer's typically flashy and demonstrative, which is a little more unobtrusive on this album than usual given the music it's surrounded by. Hellhammer's kit is completely sampled on this album; it's played by a human but every voice, possibly even the cymbals, is triggered, making for something just as clinical as the ultra-clean production and guitar playing would suggest. The lack of warmth in the drum performance makes sense given the somewhat futuristic and sterile feeling the album embodies; it's a declaration of war, yes, but not so much 'Braveheart' as a forgotten, much more violent than usual short story by Isaac Asimov.\n\nA lot of fuss is made over the vocals on this release, and I'll admit that they're probably the weakest element here. Attila Csihar is really the only worthwhile vocalist Mayhem has ever had, and everyone else in the position of frontman is just varying degrees of bad, with Maniac being one of the worst. Admittedly, his black metal snarls aren't unlistenable; a tad weak and goblinish, perhaps, but I don't think the goal is for them to be particularly savage. The spoken word sections are pretty awful, though, and probably the cheesiest, most dated part of the album, sounding anachronistic even for 2000. Maniac's lilting, too-emphatic voice in these sections reduces monologues which might have been compelling if delivered by a better voice (such as Csihar's) to elaborate and straight-faced self-parody. Fortunately, Maniac is surprisingly quiet during most of the album, and the instrumental compositions can really be taken at face value.\n\nThe result of all this weirdness is an album without any real songs; I don't think it's entirely possible to listen to any one track on this release and have it retain the meaning that it would in the context of the album. Every track bleeds into the next as far as melodic sense goes, and Mayhem did succeed at creating something that really does feel like a complete work. Every track is just that: a section of something larger, which is a technique that seems mostly forgotten in the modern metal scene, and really, hard as it might be, the only way to listen to this release is to swallow it whole like a too-large pill. Of course, this does result in individual tracks which aren't particularly memorable- the tracks which stick to your head the most are either the openly idiosyncratic ones (the trip-hop tracks) or the excruciatingly embarrassing ones ('Crystalized Pain In Deconstruction' with what might be the worst monologue on the release). Enjoying this album tends to require some work on the part of the listener, so if you're going into it with the desire of getting something out of it, be prepared to use your mind and do some of the legwork yourself.\n\nThis album is, of course, not very effective as a black metal release, but that's not really its plan, or at least it's supposed to be such a massive reinterpretation of black metal convention that you can't judge it like you would 'Deathcrush'. There's little 'riffing' on this album, the song structures are linear and kind of amorphous, and the whole thing does have a somewhat pretentious 'performance art' aesthetic about it that I can imagine would be somewhat hard for many people to stomach. It's a listen for a certain mood; I can't put this on when I just feel like hearing something fun, but given the appropriate atmosphere (late night driving seems to work wonders for it) it's much more compelling.\n\nI guess this is the point where I say whether I like the album or not, but frankly I don't think this is a release that's intended to be liked so much as appreciated. I listen to this probably a tenth as much as 'De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas' but I can't say that 'Grand Declaration Of War' is really any worse for that fact. I even have trouble calling it a failed experiment because I have no idea what the benchmark for success was supposed to be with this release; if Mayhem was planning on redefining the whole genre of black metal, well, that didn't work out very well at all since nothing since has really sounded like this. If they were just trying to make something which sounds (for want of a better term) weird, well, it's definitely that. I think the truth, like the nature of the album itself, is somewhere in between; it's a serious album but there's more than a little playfulness to its construction, a tongue-in-cheek quality which both makes it easier to stomach some of the more bizarre elements and harder to take it seriously as a release by one of black metal's most enduring artists. It's SOMETHING, definitely, but I'm not sure I'll ever know what that something is.\n\nIn any case, you should listen to it at least a few times.\n",
        "\nWhile the failure of this album isn't really unexpected, it's still deeply disappointing; while cognitively I'm aware that there will never be a 'De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas' part two, I get my hopes up with every new Mayhem release that comes out. That in mind, a Mayhem release doesn't need to be 'De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas' to be good; it would just be highly encouraged. 'Ordo Ad Chao', however, is just bad all around, and is really the soundtrack to yet another one of black metal's original greats plummeting into a sea of mediocrity and self-parody, the start of which was pronounced as far back as 'Grand Declaration Of War'. On no album until this point, however, had the band managed to make an absolutely 90 degree drop in quality; there was a hint of a curve on 'Grand Declaration Of War' and a somewhat steeper one on 'Chimera', but 'Ordo Ad Chao' is just silly; it's really as though Mayhem is pulling a neo-Darkthrone and realizes that literally anything they release will sell thousands of copies, so why try at all?\n\nI guess I might as well come out and say that, unsurprisingly, the major bright spot on this release is Attila. His performance on 'Ordo Ad Chao' doesn't quite match up to the dark majesty of 'De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas', but it comes very close at times. The man's particular style of seemingly improvised grumbling and gnashing and wailing is, as always, completely unique despite the best efforts of others in the black metal scene to clone his sound. Attila carries the album as much as he possibly can, managing to add some level of gravitas to even the most explicitly and unflinchingly boring material found on this CD. He doesn't save the album, but he truly goes down with the sinking ship in a spectacular manner, and he's worthy of commendation if just for his bravery in the face of utter horror.\n\nApart from him, Hellhammer's drumming is good. And that's about where my positive comments on this album end.\n\nHints of it were present on 'Chimera', but on 'Ordo Ad Chao', it comes out in full force: Mayhem has become uncomfortable in their own skin and are looking elsewhere in the black metal scene for artists to emulate in hopes of retaining relevance. In this case, the artist chosen is Deathspell Omega amidst a whole host of other modern bands (generally the ones affiliated with the 'orthodox' style), who for some reason have been chosen to embody Mayhem's new sound. The results, as expected, are disastrous to anyone who enjoys Mayhem for who they are versus who they attempt to ape. Gone is the exquisite sense of melody and substantial thrash and heavy metal influences of even the previous full-length, and we're left only with an extremely boring array of generally atonal, lethargic tremolo riffs which lack even the most minor motion behind them. Throughout the album one gets the distinct impression that the band simply doesn't care (with the exception of Attila, of course) and is grinding out music for the paycheck.\n\nThis album is really remarkably immature on a musical level; it's as though the band has lost any sense of progressive or novel songwriting and is falling back into the sort of riff slideshow patterns one would expect from a random one-man black metal band in eastern Europe, not a first-tier artist. It's overly primitive, and not in a good way; just a lazy, careless way that shows a band which has both run out of ideas and is completely insecure with themselves. There's nothing else that explains such a dramatic and ill-advised shift towards the style found on this album: it simply has to be a matter of fear and laziness. None of the songs manage to go anywhere or convey any atmosphere between the sort of basic darkness that anyone with a guitar and functional hands can create, and even the most complex songs come off as underdeveloped and boring.\n\nA special place in hell, though, is reserved for this album's production, which is so bad in so many ways that it almost makes you think this album is a joke (if the songwriting alone didn't make you think that). At once too quiet and horribly clipped despite it, it's an obvious attempt to capture a 'raw' sound at a good studio, making for a paradoxically clean yet deliberately underproduced sound which captures nothing good at all. Perhaps the worst afflicted are the drums: they're a faint rumbling that very clearly clips and crackles whenever a tom fill or cymbal strike emerges. Guitars are a waffling wall of sludge without any treble, but the lack of a high-end doesn't make this sound heavy, as the dynamic range and overall tone is so compressed that even the most violent moments of this music (and there are very few) sound weak and lifeless.\n\n'Ordo Ad Chao' is an awful album which never should have been made, but numerous people will think that Mayhem are geniuses simply because they've managed to 'keep up with the times', even though in doing so they've sacrificed everything which made them wonderful to begin with. Don't buy this; I can't even recommend one download this in good conscience because anyone who's been into black metal for two years has heard all the ideas in this release executed better elsewhere. There's probably no hope for the band after this, so I consider this a farewell to one of black metal's once great artists, who like so many others fell into the abyss, never to return.\n",
        "\nHere it is, Live in Leipzig, one of the most kvlterally revered albums in the history of Black Metal. Opinion seems to waver between \"immensely overrated\" and simply \"immense\", but is it really any good? Does it deserve it's kvlt status?\n\nWell, the performance itself is competent. They play the songs well enough, and it is live, so the odd fluff is expected, but the energy they play with is simply astonishing. You really do just want to band your head, it's simplistic, yet effective. Really fun to listen to, and makes you just want to go mental. \"Necrolust\" is a definite highlight for me. The setlist is fucking exquisite, really something special. Essentially, it's a greatest hits set of songs from the \"unholy trinity\" of Mayhem albums - Deathcrush, Pure Fucking Armageddon and the as-yet-unreleased De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas, and it's a tr00sters wet dream. None of the over-complicated stuff they seem to load their setlists with these days (When I went to see them, they only played Deathcrush and Freezing Moon off these three albums), and the songs they chose from these three albums are AMAZING. Not only does it have my three favourite songs from De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas (\"Pagan Fears\", \"Funeral Fog\" and \"Freezing Moon\"), but it has pretty much the whole Deathcrush EP included as well.\n\nEveryone knows the real focal point of this album, though, is the vocal performance from Dead. He is a really good vocalist, and I absolutely love his vocals but... I prefer Attila's. On the Deathcrush-era stuff, Dead rips the songs up, doing a far better performance than Maniac ever could with the songs. His voice is so fucking powerful, but Attila's was more evil. Attila's voice genuinely fucking scares me to this day, his vocals on De Mysteriis were out of this fucking world and like nothing else in Black Metal, whereas Dead's is more of a generic Black Metal singer, but with more power. I love Dead's vocals but I still believe Attila is a better vocalist.\n\nOne thing I do like about this album is the production though, very fuzzy and raw. It's not polished in any way but still you can hear everything (vaguely) and it has a charm you don't usually get with live albums. Another thing I like about this album is that Mayhem have resisted the urge to edit it in any way possible. The only thing these guys have done to this recording is split the tracks, everything still there, from the fuck-ups, to the strange guy who keeps doing random death growls between EVERY song. It's all here and I appreciate that very much.\n\nHowever, there's one thing that always annoys me about this is the fact that it's a CD. If there is ANY live performance on this earth which deserves to be on DVD, it is this one. They had fucking impaled pig's heads and Dead cut himself onstage, for fuck's sake! Not only this, but I want to see the crowd going crazy, with mental pits and stage diving, like at every gig. Now I know that the only reason they've done that is probably because there is no video available but it really annoys me that I can't watch this as well. Like \"Unreal Estate\" by Entombed, this really doesn't work as well as a CD AT ALL, it needs a DVD release to get it's full rating.\n\nIn summary, then, this is an essential buy. If you weren't already salivating at the prospect of the only official release featuring Dead on vocals (Bar that single), then you will be hooked by the fact that this is a fantastic recording, truly amazing. This is Mayhem at grassroots level, at it's rawest form, and Mayhem was always designed to be raw. Although maybe not their best album (De Mysteriis still edges it a little), this is possibly the definitive document of Mayhem, by far Mayhem's greatest live album, and utterly essential.\n\nIf we ever get a DVD, rest assured, the rating will be no less than 95%.\n",
        "\nThe year is 1987, and the music scene is just beginning to roar in Norway. A small but legitimate band named Mayhem had sprung up, inspired by many NWOBHM and thrash metal bands. The demos they had produced had only become of interest in the small trading world, but this ep is really what brought Mayhem into the spotlight. Before the landmark 'De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas', there was Deathcrush.\n\nDeathcrush is a very appropriate name for such a release. The 'sound' of the album is indeed a deathcrush to your ears, but in all a pleasurable one. After the ominous 'Silvester Anfang' introduction clip (which is a very good introduction - like a march to war), the first track to crush you happens to be Deathcrush. This approach to black metal should be expanded on by more bands because it simply catchy, heavy, and in a sense fun. The riff work is fast and made up of a lot simplistic cords, but it doesn't take away from the music. It reminds me of a hardcore punk approach at metal. Assuming you misunderstand what I mean, the riffs are simple but the emotion and creativity from the musicians amplifies the sound of what they are playing. 'Chainsaw Gutsfuck' is a great song, but is a prime example of this. There's a lot of repetition and not a whole lot to the writing, but I headbang to it nonetheless. You can really hear the Venom influence in the music, just portrayed in a very primitive way. 'Witching Hour' (which is a Venom cover itself), and the song 'Necrolust' are great examples. They are really thrashy, stepping away from the overall black metal sound that early Mayhem carried. \n\nOnwards from the six string sounds, we have Necrobutcher on the bass. He's actually an underrated bassist, as his work is really good. Not only is his writing good, but whatever distortion he uses on this EP is fantastic. The over distortion really makes his bass sound ten times as heavy as a clean bass would sound. Plus, his bass sticks out in the mix and is very audible. Overall, this release wouldn't be the same without the bass tracks. Manheim is also a very prominent member on this release, as the drummer. His beats are mainly blast beats but with many fills throughout each song that sound amazing. Plus, he has his own song, (Weird) Manheim. After all of the musical descriptions, you have to mention the infamous Maniac, and the lesser heard Messiah. I'm not a big fan of Maniac, but I must say his vocal work fits the style that Mayhem was playing at the time. So, I have to say that Maniac positively effected the outcome of Deathcrush. Though, I am a big fan of Messiah, especially on 'Witching Hour'. Both of them were powerful vocalists, but Messiah should have had more prominence in the music.\n\nThough, there are a few extra perks on the side with the Deathcrush ep. The clips 'Silvester Anfang', as well as the introduction to '(Weird) Manheim' are special sounds in addition to the music. 'Silvester Anfang' reminds me of the snare drum the soldiers would play as they marched to war. '(Weird) Manheim' has an introduction that sounds creepy, ominous, and is probably the reason they added weird to the title. It sounds like it could have been from a horror movie, or something of that sort. Also, the lyrics are intense and bring some brutal and violent images to your head. 'Chainsaw Gutsfuck' reminds me of something a brutal death metal band of today would write, possibly Digested Flesh or Amputated Genitals. Here's lyrics from 'Chainsaw Gutsfuck' to prove my point: \n\n\"Bleed down to the fucking core\nYou're going down for fucking more\nScrew your slimy guts\nDriving me fucking nuts!\n\nChainsaw in my bleeding hands\nAs I start to cut you in two\nYour guts are steaming out\nAnd I just love the sight!\n\nMaggots crawling in her cunt\nI just love to lick that shit\nBury you in a slimy grave\nYou will rot forever there!\"\n\n...and there it is. Those are some 'fun' lyrics, aren't they?\n\nWell, I'm definitely not the first person to review this album, but I am one of many telling you to check it out. It's the beginning of the history of Mayhem, and a worthy sampling for black metal fans to hear. Anyone interested in primal, thrashy riffs with maniac screeches, this will intrigue you. Hell, some of you might even chose to look into for the Venom cover, that sure swayed me.\n",
        "\nIn the year 1984, a band called Mayhem was formed. The founding members were mere teenagers who were influenced greatly by bands such as Hellhammer, Venom, Bathory, and Celtic Frost. The so-called \u201cleader\u201d of the band, Euronymous, strived to create a new brand of metal, a genre that would fully embrace the energy of black magic and Satan. Then a vocalist in Sweden caught Euronymous\u2019s eye, a vocalist known as Dead. Dead was recruited into the band, and the rest is history. I believe we all know the controversial history of the band by now: Dead committing suicide, Euronymous collecting Dead\u2019s skull fragments, and Varg Vikernes murdering Euronymous. Murder here, suicide there, crazy stories, but is their music good? Is this band just another GG Allin, pure shock value, but horrendous music? The album, \u2018De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\u2019 was released in the year 1994, and it finally showed that this band was something more. In fact, they were something else entirely.\n\nThe idea of creating music that spoke of the Devil and black magic was a silly idea at first. At the time, it was already done to death by Slayer and Venom. So how could Mayhem do the same thing and think that they were doing something new? But when I listened to the album, I finally understood. The music was simple but memorable, and it created an atmosphere that was unlike anything at the time. Euronymous may have been an insane asshole, but he had a vision, a vision that was black metal.\n\nWhen Dead committed suicide, a new vocalist was needed. But who could replace him, and sing his lyrics without sounding too clich\u00e9 and silly? The answer was a vocalist named Attila Csihar, a man from Hungary. There have been countless arguments on who was better, Dead or Attila. I will have to go with Attila on this one. The man had a creepy vocal style that was unpredictable. He would sing here, growl there, shriek over here, and scream over there. It was something that Dead could never do, for he always screeched and growled his way through all the songs. But one still wonders, what if? What if Dead was given the chance to perform in the studio and record his vocals for this album? Would it have been better? No one will ever know. But what made Attila\u2019s performance excellent however, were the lyrics. Dead may have been dead at this time, but he still influenced the band from beyond the grave. For you see, it was he wrote the majority of the lyrics on \u2018De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\u2019; lyrics that spoke of death, insanity, and the macabre. They were excellent, and Attila singing them with his unique vocal style is what solidified the vocal delivery. It was a good choice to leave out the famous introduction of Freezing Moon however, for only Dead could deliver it flawlessly. \u201cWhen it\u2019s cold, and when it\u2019s dark, the Freezing Moon can obsess you!\u201d\n\nThen comes the guitar playing by Euronymous. Euronymous was no Kirk Hammet, but he wrote riffs that were filled with morbid energy. An energy that created the album\u2019s atmosphere. What made it so great was the fact that it was some-what simple, but it still did so much for the album. Simplicity is complexity I suppose, and he truly showed how black metal riffs should be done. Riffs that were simple, catchy, and memorable; riffs that characterized black metal perfectly. Euronymous was a ridiculous person, but the black metal genre would be nothing without his idiotic views that started it all.\n\nOne thing that surprised me was the bass, it\u2019s actually audible. Not only was it audible, but it actually adds to the black atmosphere of the album. I\u2019ve heard that the drummer, Hellhammer, lowered the basslines on the album after Varg murdered Euronymous, but it\u2019s still there. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the bass is not the first thing you will notice, but it\u2019s still strongly present. If the stories of the basslines being lowered are true, then I wonder what the album would\u2019ve sounded with the original mix.\n\nHellhammer is a solid drummer that gets the job done, but it\u2019s nothing intricate or complex. It is, however, unrelenting and persistent. Hellhammer is probably better than most in the black metal genre, but then again, an amazing drummer is not needed in order to create a good black metal record.\n\nThe thing that may surprise many people who have not heard this album is the production. It is not the usual shitty-bedroom fuzzy quality that black metal is infamous for. It is actually clean and balanced, each instrument and vocal lines are all audible and distinguishable. Yet it does not detract from the atmosphere that this album creates; it still compliments the Satanic black magic imagery that this album portrays, which ultimately proves that shitty quality is not necessary to create a grim, kvlt atmosphere.\n\nThis album is what solidified the Norwegian black metal scene. Several black metal acts had already released black metal albums before this album was recorded and released, but Mayhem has always been there since the beginning. This album is one of three albums that I believe best represents the black metal genre. If someone were to ask me what black metal is, I would simply give them this album. The characteristics of black metal are all here. Some may find this ridiculous, since so many have claimed that this album sucks and that it had done nothing for the genre. But the black metal genre may not have been exposed to the world had it not been for the controversial stories and events that surrounded Mayhem. The historical significance of this album is what makes it so hard to ignore.\n",
        "\nYou thought you liked De Mysteriis Domini Sathanas? You will fucking die this time around! THIS is what that album could have been. Sure it's only five of the songs in a random order, but it completely owns the 'real' versions of these songs. I'm pretty sure that I'm going to have to strangle Atilla for sitting on these songs for as long as he did - they're that awesome.\n\nThis, for all intents and purposes, is the exact same as the studio album. The only difference I can hear with the actual songwriting is the little drum piece to start \"Funeral Fog\". It's the same death metal tremolo riffs with just enough thrash influence as to remain interesting and worthwhile, but with the added bonus of actually being able to hear the guitars (and bass!) That was my major gripe with the original release - everything was buried under too much distortion, overloud drums, and you couldn't really understand what was being said. This appears to be a pre-production version of these songs as the vocals are subtly different, but Csihar is still puking out blasphemies and sounds evil as fuck.\n\nThe previously mentioned \"Funeral Fog\" is probably the highlight, but that might just be because it was the first Mayhem song I ever heard. \"Freezing Moon\" is also good and surprisingly better than the version from the 'Projections of a Stained Mind' compilation with Dead on vocals. The rest are certainly no slouch either.\n\nHeh, I wish the other three songs from the album were on here, but that would be have been a little much to ask for (it'd be kind of cool to comprehend Atilla singing in Latin, but that's another matter entirely). \n\nThis is completely and totally awesome. Far and away the best Mayhem.\n",
        "\nIt all happened sometime in 1988, when Euronymous recruited our beloved Dead from the local death metal scene in Stockholm, Sweden to join up in his band to create a new brand of extreme metal, to define what the future of extreme metal was to be, to bring forth all the morbid aesthetics created by their mentors in Venom, Bathory and Hellhammer to it's full fruition and summon the great beast of Black Metal from the dark fiery abyss of the six hundered and sixty six layers of hell.\nIt was all well calculated, and nothing juvenile. This was serious fucking business, and on the way they brought a few other comrades in the saturated and silly norwegian death/thrash metal scene with them to assist them in this task, and what we got was different blends and definitions of how it all could work out, to varying results. But, of course, Euronymous being the mastermind behind it all, knew that his own band Mayhem would maim everything in his way as he started to conjur up the material for their debut album, De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas, an album concerned on the secret rites of a rumoured book only existing in one copy where all evil and satanic rituals was printed, probably by Satan himself!\n\nAt the time that the ideas were developing in their dark subconscious, Dead decided to pass on to another bleak dimension of death, but not to the surprise of his friends who had seen this coming for a while. But because this things came to a halt for a while. Where could they find another vocalist with a great, if not greater, artistic vision? Where could another morbid mind hide itself? Why, if not in the land of the once great Kingdom of Hungary! The land of Elizabeth Bathory, the Carpathian Mountains, ancient castle ruins and bloody battles of the past, and perhaps the thing of of major relevance - once the country to which Transylvania belonged! Here recided another man who had been developing his own ideas under the monicker of Tormentor, and with the at release cult-classic demo \"Anno Domini\", basically a raw thrash metal album with black metal undertones, a great record which wouldn't pass the ever seeing eye of Euronymous, here is where Attila Csihar lived, and it didn't took long for Euronymous to get him to join him in his quest for eternal devastation and destruction of all that is moral and aesthetical pleasing! But I'll digress, and now go forward about what this album is all about.\n\nThose who believe they get this album at the first listen don't really know anything, those who feel a spark of inspiration and witness some sort of dark behind what you initially hear with this album are going along the right track, and then there are those like me who didn't hear anything special the first time arround, nor second... But, within our feeble minds and our hidden dark subconscious, some mysterious things was happening, the seed which had been planted slowly grew to infest our heads with all this morbid, weird tales, the haunting landscapes pictured in the simple, yet effective, lyrics created by our beloved Dead, the morbid - everything about this era Mayhem is morbid! - guitar tone, with it's raw, sharp, melodic ring, like the chime of a bell of doom, conjuring necrotic neurotic psychosis within the minds of posers, bringing forth evil tidings of a world approaching Armageddon! I could go on forever about the major importance of Euronymous performance, but it's outstanding and unmatched to say the least. But let's not forget the drums, ever pounding forward, rolling on like a beast hunting for it's prey. And then we have the thing which bring this all together, evil gestalt of Attila, the one who was bringing this shared aesthetical vision to the epitome of what could be created at the time - moaning, singing, croaking, growling and rasping forth the message of total true Mayhem to mankind, sometimes in a morose droning fashion only to suddenly cramp out a scowl that shills the marrow. Total necro! All in all a unique performance of vocals, only to be touched upon by a select few since that are cutting close in their own personal expressions. Bundled up together these key points make up a record which could reveal the mysteries of our Lord Satan to those who are strong enough of will and soul, evil enough at the deepest corners of their inner cores, blessed with a inner self of putried morbidity, to grow and bring menace upon this world of hypocrisy!\n\nThroughout the history of contemporary music, there are only a few records which manage with this task, to create an album which may grow within you, and which can lead to different interpretations every time when you listen to it, accomplished by layinger the music with a fuzz and ideas that might appeal to you in different manners each and every time, that invite you to be a part of the creative ritual, making the music you listen to not only a piece of music which you approach and witness, but where you yourself are one within the process of it all, emphasizing and arranging bits with your own emotional organs as your soul become embraced by the sound. Be ware, or it may consume you! But once again, I'll digress, and move toward the end with this review.\n\nThis was the album that defined it all, what black metal was all about. Some may say Darkthrone did, but Darkthrone did never understand anything about black metal, they were mere kids playing the game, not knowing what it was all about, puppets in the hand of Euronymous! This is what inspired people worldwide to bring the morbid art of black metal onward to something great, Greater, to deliver us from this mundande world to one full of peril and morbid sickness.\n\nThis is a dark piece of art yet unmatched in it's brave vision of how to shape your own destiny, to go into the dark subconscious and bring forth your most morbid thoughts and put an end to life as we know it, to broaden the horizons, to find a new insight of your own visions and dreams and bring forth a new expression within something which is already limited by it's own definition.\n\nThis is the dark legacy of Euronymous and Dead, a testimony of the morbid visions conjured by the black emperors of the sepulchral past. Here, gentlemen and zombies alike, we have perfection.\nDon't forget... When it's cold, and when it's dark, the freezing moon may obsess you!\n",
        "\nI had waited to complete (at the time, OAC hadn't been made yet) my mayhem collection, because I had heard bad things about Chimera. Sure, I had heard bad things about GDoW, but that was more due to the fact that Mayhem experimented a lot on that, and that usually draws flak from a closeminded fanbase. So for a while I stocked up on bootlegs and other knicknacks until I finally got around to downloading a sample from Chimera off of Mayhem's website. It didn't sound too bad, and I wondered where all the cries of \"sellout\" came from. I reasoned that Mayhem might have done what a lot of bands do when they make a shitty record, and that is put the best song on your site so people will think all the songs on that record are that good. I decided to get it anyways.\n\nWhat I initially thought about it was a fear that they had spent more time packaging it nicely than they did actually writing and recording. Indeed, the digipack was a 4-fold with pictures of all 4 bandmates mugging the camera. As well, the composite booklet made it hard to read the lyrics on some of the songs and looked kinda pretentious. Nevertheless, I plunked it in. Let me tell you, this is the first proper black metal effort they've done since DMDS. \n\nSpeaking of DMDS, I want to address something first. For the \"fans\" of Mayhem who want them to make another DMDS ad infinitum, I have a simple task: Go to your local record store that sells black metal (over in the SF bay area we have rasputin and Amoeba) and pick up a copy of this seminal black metal record called \"De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\" by the black metal heavyweight Mayhem. There, now you have another DMDS. That's about as close as you're ever going to get to hearing another Mayhem DMDS. Dead's dead, and so is euronymous, and they were the principle songwriters of DMDS (though Attila wrote some lyrics). Do you honestly expect them to make another DMDS? I will henceforth address Chimera as an album unto its own, and avoid comparison to past albums. Apples and oranges, fellows.\n\nAnywho, this album bitchsmacks you from the very beginning with meat n' potatoes black metal. That one, I suspect, was a middle finger to those who thought Mayhem had gone soft. Now that they got the blastbeats out of the way, it was time for another approach. It's in the next song, Dark Night of the Soul, where Blasphemer's genius starts to show. And to further the apples and oranges statement, I must illustrate Euronymous and Blasphemer's different styles. Note that I said DIFFERENT, not better or worse. Euronymous is a riff based writer. Each song is good because the individual riffs are good. Blasphemer is more of a holistic writer. He is a texture based writer, with countless seemingly amorphous riffs coming together to form a haunting picture. Each way achieves atmosphere, they're just different approaches. Dark Night of the Soul is one of the songs on Chimera that best shows that distinctive style. The cool thing is about it that it doesn't have to blast 100% of the time to sound evil. In fact, the relative doom-like slowness of the first half of that song only makes the fast part seem faster. \n\nManiac's voice, as well, peaks here. While he's still recognizably Maniac, his performance is a lot more forceful and venomous, taking on a noticable Dead influence, especially on My Death, Slaughter of Dreams, and the title track. His versatile performance greatly helps this album, as while it's not as outrageous as its antecessor in terms of tempo changes, Chimera doesn't settle into a rut, and it manages to be repetitive in the atmospheric parts and jarring in the transitional parts. While there are songs that are all slow (My Death, Chimera) and songs that are all fast (Slaughter of Dreams, You Must Fall), all songs are satisfactorily varied, in some degree. \n\nHellhammer's performance here is IMO his best. While it's not his fastest, it's the most consistent and professional. One complaint I had about OAC was the sloppiness of the drumming. Here, it's flawlessly played, yet still distinctively Hellhammer. If you've heard Hellhammer play, you know what I mean. Rounding out the lineup is Necrobutcher, who, for the first (and probably last) time, he's actually a significant part of the album. His tone is meaty as hell, and his performance here is greasy and filthy in all its low-pitched glory. As well, he's a driving force in songs like Impious Devious Leper Lord and the aforementioned Dark Night of the Soul. \n\nSo, really, once you drop the closed mind and try to accept this for what it is, it's really quite marvellous. It has a distinct atmosphere and it is a haunting one at that.\n",
        "\nMayhem is among my favorite black metal bands. I like nearly everything they have put out. Everything except this misguided heap of hooey. When I critique a black metal release, I judge it by intrinsic value of expectations and standards held by the genre. Which means when I hear a black metal band, I expect to hear black metal music. Grand Declaration of War fails as black metal and as something else. Whatever that else is that Mayhem tried to do with this album I do not know but it failed. \n\nThe first thing I will say about GDoW is that it is one big fucking tease. I will give it a little bit of extra points for the first four and half songs or so because Blasphemer does a good job with the riffs on those songs and Maniac sounds like he should. Wolf's Lair Abyss is one of my favorite EP's of all time and this album is supposed to be an expansion of that concept I gather. So, those first few songs do provide a decent continuity to it. They are respectable to good but not great. At best, it sounded promising. I guess this is supposed to be a concept album. But guess what? I don't like concept albums in black metal either. \n\nBecause of the relative merits of the aforementioned parts in the beginning, this will rate slightly higher than it deserves. That being said, considering this line-up of Mayhem contains the talents of the very worthy guitarist Blasphemer and the great Hellhammer, this sure is one empty war chest. How this album just completely plateaus into utter drivel is so infuriating that I would just as soon to forget the band released this altogether. It stops just short of being categorized into the Cold Lake class of what-the-fuck. \n\nWhatever message about nihilism and war the band tries to convey gets lost. It's no big deal at all. It certainly isn't \"Grand.\" As a matter of fact, if this is about destruction and combat, then this is one war I will sit out. Oh! What an un-lovely war! I will take my interest in war metal elsewhere, thank you very much. That was my first thought as soon as the song A Bloodsword and a Colder Sun Part II of...eh I lost count. The point is, this is where the record gets really asinine. Maniac just whisper sings in a suave style backed by a Devo-like electronic arrangement that reminded me of anything but fallout of war. Crystalized Pain in Deconstruction follows shortly after it. To say it's an improvement on the prior song isn't saying much but it is a little better. By this point though, Maniac just yelps out spoken word like inanities that becomes quite annoying. How he says, \"Where instruments of genetic distortion is me!\" is pretty amusing. This album could use a bit more instruments of distortion and less of the electronica, true. Then there is the Daimonion series of songs. The first one is just more of a rockish type bit with Maniac singing like Mark Mothersbaugh with the raped cat screeches behind it. However, let me skip down to the worst song of the album. Well, it's not actually a song at all. That's right, except for the spoken line at the very beginning, the song is just...yep, silence. Now I have heard this kind of thing done before in some other album by somebody but here, it is just a complete debacle. It is about four full minutes of dead air. I'm sorry but that is not content. How could they have thought this was clever? Ah, that's right, this supposed to be avant-garde. If that is avant-garde, then I'm Ava Gardner and I say that pretentiousness like this has no place in black metal from here to fucking eternity. \n\nThis album goes out with a whimper too. After that non-song (actually there are two of them with the latter being a full seven seconds of nil!) that is called Daimonion, it just ends with an inconsequential guitar chord by Blasphemer that seems tacked on from a demo somewhere. It fittingly sums up what this album is: A grand declaration of...nothing. Not war. Not annihilation. Certainly not combat. Just nothing. After the first shots are fired, you will find that it was nothing more than a negligent discharge. Stand down, it was just a drill.\n",
        "\nThis is the infamous Mayhem bootleg. Not only is it one of the only releases with the Dead on vocals, it\u2019s also the notorious release with Dead\u2019s suicide photo as the cover art. That combination alone was worth picking it up (or so I thought). After a few listens, I\u2019m unsure whether I\u2018m glad to own this or not.\n\nThis is really two different albums on one disc, so I will review them separately. However, it will, as a whole, receive one score. The first eight tracks were recorded at a 1990 show in Sarpsborg. Tracks nine through Eleven (track nine really is two songs - at least on my copy) were recorded at a 1986 show in Lillehammer.\n\nLive in Sarpsborg:\n\nThe set list is a pretty good one. At least in terms of my taste, they picked a good selection of songs. The album starts right away with \"Deathcrush\", which in my eyes is a perfect start. However, right from the get-go something is very clear: the production sucks. The production is alright considering it's a bootleg, but that doesn't mean that the sound quality is good - it isn't. A lot of the higher frequency stuff is lost (like most of the cymbals), but overall the levels of all the instruments seem to be pretty equal, which is almost astonishing for a record like this. Though, the bass is probably [easily] the least audible, but it's black metal, so that's almost a standard anyway. So while the production is bearable, especially when you consider that it\u2019s a bootleg, I want to stress again, the production is not good, and I do think it effects the quality of the album.\n\nMayhem's draw for me has always been Euronymous. I'm not really sure why either. I don't even think that he's really all that good. I think it boils down to the fact that he will occasionally throw some riffs out that just really excite me. Plus his willingness to throw in some solos (regardless of length or level of wankery) is also a plus. However, he doesn't get to wow me as much on this release, just because he's, generally speaking, harder to hear - everything is. Hellhammer, as usual for me, is pretty blah. The guy is obviously a really good drummer, but he just doesn't do anything for me. Necrobutcher just does his job; I can't compliment him or complain about him in any way whatsoever.\n\nOne of the main reasons I picked this record up was to hear Dead\u2019s vocals. A lot of people put Dead on this pedestal. Having only previously heard his efforts on \"Live in Leipzig\", I wanted to hear some more of him. While it is interesting to hear Dead's vocals on some of the songs he was originally set to do on \"De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\", I just don't feel like he's this amazing vocalist that a lot of people make him out to be. I didn't like his vocals on \"Live in Leipzig\" at all, and I think his vocals here are only a slight improvement. I don\u2019t know if I am just missing something, or if his reputation is more about his suicide than his vocal quality (I tend to lean towards the latter personally).\n\nLive in Lillehammer:\n\nThis part of the bootleg is hard for me to even review. The production is so crappy that all you can really hear is vocals. You can somewhat hear the music in the background, but for the most part is just sounds like a blob of sound. It's decipherable, but to me, it's not worth deciphering. The volume goes up and down, and the stereo aspect is nonsensical. Plus all of the songs are covers (which to me are kind of boring). To be honest I think this bootleg is considerably worse as a whole because of this half. I think I would have ultimately liked the release overall if the Live in Lillehammer material had been omitted. That\u2019s obviously, just my opinion though.\n\nOverall, \u201cDawn of the Black Hearts\u201d was a big disappointment for me. Frankly, I don\u2019t understand why people like this release so much. I might go as far as to say that I think people make themselves like it because of the cover art and because Dead does the vocals. I personally don\u2019t think it\u2019s very good. The quality of the recordings just aren\u2019t good enough to warrant a high score. I think Mayhem is just one of those bands that is meant to be heard live, and I don\u2019t think \u201cDawn of the Black Hearts\u201d does them justice. If you want to hear a good Mayhem live album, I would highly recommend \u201cMediolanum Capta Est\u201d. Unless, you really want this record for the cover art and/or to hear Dead\u2019s vocals (or if you\u2018re looking to complete Mayhem\u2018s catalogue), I would avoid this release at all costs.\n",
        "\nAfter some (forgettable) demos, Mayhem was going to record their first EP. They were growing as a band... in terms of popularity, because few things had changed since their awful demos. Yes, they sound \"better\", a little more compact and serious as a band, but there's anyhting else than evil lyrics and music? The answer is a resounding no.\n\n\nThe intro, Silvester Angfang, is like a military march, and as a military march, is goddamn repetitive to the level of being annoying. Two minutes were too much for it, if only they used the half of this song, my patience wouldn't ran out so easily. Deathcrush, the real first song, has a good riff, yes, but after that, the mixture between that guitar, some unheardable vocals and erratic blast beats turn the song into a disaster. Chainsaw Gutsfuck has a nice riff, truly dark atmospheres, but some annoying vocals which are the biggest problem of the EP. But in spite of that, the song is the best of the album for me.\n\n\nThe cover of Venom's Witching Hour is something really weird. If you said \"what a mess!\" while listening to the previous songs, this one will made you thinking seriously about the idea of throwing this EP to the garbage can. Seriously, a song was a classic of NWOBHM is now destroyed by some Norwegian kids who pretend to be \"evil\"... The next, Necrolust, is another average piece of \"evil death metal\", with nothing extremely interesting. Besides, this is one of the most repeated songs of the band's demos/ep's/splits/whatever. (Weird) Manheim is another interesting piece which shows us some ability to get dark atmospheres done right (they only needed more practice...), with a mysterious bass guitar playing some monotone notes. Pure Fucking Armageddon is just another mess, although they had done much better things with this song live. It has an interesting thrash metal riff, but nothing special. \n\n\nWell, that's all. This EP is a collection of the band's early work, so it hasn't anything new, with the exception of its annoying intro. Mayhem should thank all the media hype around them in the early nineties, because a band like this (with an urgent need of maturity and rehersals) would hardly succeed in \"normal\" conditions.\n",
        "\nPicture this, if you would\u2026 you\u2019re standing in a huge, black, room. Upon the stage there are pig heads on stakes, and a quartet of filthy Norweigan teenagers, struggling to get their piss-poor equipment set up for 40 minutes of the most brutal black metal you could expect to hear at the time. The ugly blonde one with a bunch of coal paint on his eyes steps up to the front and rasps \u201cOnly Death is REEEEEAL!\u201d Then it begins.\n\nI dunno what it is about low-fi black metal that seduces me and makes me forget what it is to appreciate recording quality, but it works. I can listen to this and see it all. Fuck the snare drum sounding like a piece of plywood on a brick, fuck the bass distorted to comedic-fuzz heights, fuck the guitar, being sloppily shredded, like a blind mans cheese, and fuck Dead and his vocals, that sound like a dying Alzheimer\u2019s patient gasping for her final words as she departs this earth. None of these things matter.\n\nThe grimness. The shallow, hateful, rasping undertone. The brutal pounding, the nasty aura, the disgusting ambiance. These are what matter. You aren\u2019t in a place where quality matters when you listen to this, you are in a place where all things black and filthy, all things that drip with distaste, disdain and despair, where all evil flourishes.\n\nIt\u2019s called grimland, population\u2026 well, I dunno the exact figure. But they\u2019re all wearing corpsepaint, that\u2019s for fucking sure! And I vacation whenever I can.\n\nThis is the first, the gate. If you wanna see if someone who\u2019s interested has the spirit to stomach the black metal genre, you need to make sure they hear this first. It\u2019s the gateway, and if you can brave these gates, a whole new atmosphere is there for the sucking.\n\nThe quality sucks, sure, but the songs are there! They are there in raw, prime form. Deathcrush is slowed to an unnatural speed, frowned upon by many, but come on! It sounds magnificent this way. That is a song that can crawl, and like a mighty behemoth, crush all those who stumble into it\u2019s sodden trail before it. Or something. Necrolust is always a step up from the Deathcrush version (I personally haven\u2019t heard a version past or present that tops this one). This was even the first you heard of Funeral Fog, a song that was recorded for De Mysteriis\u2026 later on, in a perfect, grimey way. But here, on this record, it\u2019s an abortion of sickly trance. It\u2019s sloppy, but by god, the song is there and kickin.\n\nFreezing Moon? You know, the one that we\u2019ve all heard 15 different versions of? Yeah, this is the only one worth remembering. Carnage? Well\u2026 listen to Pure Fuckin Armageddon, and listen to Live in Leipzig\u2026 tell me which you\u2019re more partial to.\n\nBuried by Time and Dust\u2026 here\u2019s about the only song that would move on to be reproduced in such a way to put this live version to shame. Not bad, just not as neatly polished, and Dead is not quite as suited for this delivery as Atilla was on De Mysteriis\u2026 Still, despite the imperfections (and, also, despite the fucked up buzz at the beginning and the dropped drumsticks in the middle), it\u2019s a great incarnation of this track.\n\nPagan Fears is good. Yeah\u2026 Not really much to say there.\n\nCHAINSAW GUTSFUCK! Now we\u2019re down to fucking business, friends. Another one from Deathcrush, slowed to a crawl, and my god, it\u2019s intense. It\u2019s sonic earfucking on a whole new level. Dead, unlike every other singer to perform this song, actually gets the fucking lyrics right! Yeah, listen, he does it\u2026 what\u2019re the fuckin odds? (Seriously, though, how fucking hard is it for Atilla/Maniac/Messiah/JoeBlackMetal to learn the lyrics to this song and not fuck them up live? Apparently very\u2026) Crushing bass, precise drums, brilliant creeping lyrics, a song that plods along to a fitting climax.\n\n\u201cCome on! Leipzig! Join us!!! Pure\u2026 fucking\u2026 Armageddon!!!\u201d and with that bold statement, we hear a closing to end all closings (get it? Cause it\u2019s, liek, Armageddon, and, liek, theyre ending teh show?! Lololz) and as they thrash through the final notes, you are left to bring yourself out of an aural, cranial, dank, grim, ghoulswamp of trance-inducing headrape and crawl your way out of Grimland. Nice? I thought so.\n\nWhich reminds me, the only thing I regret, is that they never played Ghoul. But we can\u2019t really hold that against them, now can we?\n",
        "\nThis is a compilation album, with tracks 1-7 recorded live and tracks 8-12 being pre-production tracks from \u201cGrand Declaration of War\u201d.\n\nThe first thing that stuck out to me on this release was Maniac\u2019s vocals. Throughout all my years of being a Mayhem fan I\u2019ve always just dismissed him as an inferior vocalist compared to both Attila and Dead. However there is something about his performance on this release that sticks out as intriguing to me. The introduction of spoken word passages are a nice change of pace and his shrieks on Deathcrush and GDoW material fit will with the accompanying music. His performance on \u201cFreezing Moon\u201d is absolutely dreadful though, you can tell he has no idea how to perform that song and mumbles incoherent shrieks the entire way though it.\n\nMoving onto the guitar and bass, Blasphemer and Necrobutcher both play fairly tight with not too many faults or playing errors. Again though, during \u201cFreezing Moon\u201d Blasphemer rushes to fast into it and destroys what ever atmosphere was left over after Maniac opened his mouth. His performance on GDoW material is more enjoyable, obviously more suiting to his playing style.\n\nNext we have Hellhammer\u2019s performance on drums. Although he is an extremely talented drummer, his reliance on triggers is a real set back. The constant \u201cclick click click\u201d underneath each song proves a little annoying. However his remaining drum work is performed mostly without flaw.\n\nI think this release would have been much better if they had included more GDoW material in the first live half. As it\u2019s both Maniac and Blasphemer\u2019s strong points, leading to a stronger and more enjoyable live performance. All in all not a bad release, of course it\u2019s unnecessary given that all these tracks have been released before and the 87\u2019-94\u2019 material has been played to death. I\u2019d recommend it to a newer Mayhem fan who is after a broadish variety of songs as an introduction to the band.\n",
        "\nMany will consider the GDoW period as Mayhem's weakest period, where they almost lost who they were and got caught up in a sea of pretentiousness. While I don't entirely agree with that, because I don't think GDoW is that bad, nor do I believe that WLA or Chimera were bad at all, this certainly shows the artistic decay of a once great band. \n\nFirst off, every Mayhem fan, whether he/she enjoys GDoW, should already have it. Mayhem release albums about as fast as old people fuck, so whenever a new album comes out, it's already in my CD rack. Secondly, the European/US Legions live CD's plain sucked. The songs were poorly chosen (do we really need the 1000th version of Freezing Moon? Do we really need the 13467548329075 version of Pure Fucking Armaggeddon? Do we really need to fill up a live CD with material almost solely from 1987 or 1986?) and the production, which all but muted the bass and took all the power out of the drums and guitars, was quite lacking. Plus, the fact that they released the SAME FUCKING CD (except for one measly song) twice, pretty much condemns this to the bargain rack. True Mayhem fans would've gotten Live In Marseilles, which, although it shared the same shit production, had a broader set list, with songs from DMDS as well as WLA, GDoW, and Deathcrush. \n\nHowever, let's set those two arguments aside. Both the constituents of this box set have been released in ample quantities before, and I'm sure there's not a dearth of people familiar with the material from the Legions CD's. For a box set to be really worth anything, there needs to be something new. It doesn't have to be anything big, really, it could just be a kickass poster and some memorabilia or knick knack signed by Blasphemer, or some previously unreleased live material, or hell, one of the better quality bootlegs from the Dead-era. But at least SOMETHING should be new. This is just a repackaging of already released material that every Mayhem fan worth his grit should've already had. It's a cash grab, nothing more, and it degrades the Mayhem name every time they put out something like this, because there is no other reason for this to exist. \n\nWhether or not the constituting material is pointless or not is irrelevant. European Legions could be auditory orgasms that make the listener shit bricks of gold every time he puts it in the CD player, and GDoW could be the next DMDS, but that still doesn't change the fact that this is the same old shit, just repackaged. All the fact that European Legions sucks does is lower the score that much more. Mayhem is awesome, but this is really just a cash grab.\n",
        "\nOrdo ad Chao.\n\nThis is an ominous piece of work, containing the oddest compilation of Mayhem's efforts up until this point.\n\nThough I was badly disappointed by its predecessor Chimera, Ordo ad Chao truly revived the Mayhem flame within me. This album carries a really fantastic atmosphere and a much grittier sound that gives off the idea it may as well have been made in the middle of the Second Wave.\n\nYou will not find catchy and \"progressionist\" riffs in here. The guitar work is certainly wrought with an obscurity resembling their very own \u2018De Mystheriis dom Sathanas\u2019. Starting off in 'A Wise Birthgiver' with a decrepit and atmospheric sound, Blasphemer's labor on Ordo ad Chao simply strikes me as odd - It is pretty much non-linear and follows weirded-out tempos, setting it's own pace. At times it can be slow and suddenly burst into crushing tremolos as those seen in 'Work of Ages'. HOWEVER, there are times when the distortion shifts and creates some pretty cool moments (0:50 of Illuminate Eliminate)\n\nThe bass lines are pretty much the responsible for thickening the sound and giving it an enthralling feeling. The bass doesn't stand out much more than the guitar, since they both act as secondary to the songs' purpose, which seems obviously to unsettle the listener with a truly dense sound.\n\nNow onto the drumming: It carries a very tribal feeling to it, adding to the whole ritualistic atmosphere on the whole CD. One thing I do have to say about the drum sound is the strange sound that the Ride Cymbal makes, since at times it is pretty much an odd bell (have you ever stopped before the tracks, when the train is close and there's that awfully annoying bell? That's the one!)\n\nLast, but by no means least, comes the time to discuss Attila's work. I absolutely praise this album's vocals, since they don't sound trivial or overproduced. This feels spontaneous, and there are many REALLY odd sounds that he makes that contribute to just how unsettling this album can be (The beginning and again at 3:50 on Deconsecrate). Making gurgling, screaming, breathing in, chanting, growling, whispering and so on... I applaud the vocal work in here. It's blaspheme, and totally amazing.\n\nThe only downside is that to truly appreciate this album and not finding it over the top and corny, you must listen to the WHOLE CD, not just bits-n-bobs. Give it a good spin one night and you will be truly enthralled.\n\nHail Ordo ad Chao.\n",
        "\nIn all honesty, this is just as amazing and essential as most people say, but for decidedly different reasons than they generally state. In my experience, there's really no other black metal band that has been able to capture the same mood and style portrayed on this record, and on top of this, that very mood itself was mastered by Mayhem in these eight tracks, so perhaps it's for the best that others aren't even trying. It's amazing how even at this stage in their career, Mayhem was busy smashing the conventions of black metal and displaying the true potential of the genre as an artistic force that nearly every other artist pales in comparison to. Mayhem are not at all the godfathers of black metal post-'Deathcrush', but instead are the wild, untamed masters at the edge of the genre who deserve more reverence than they truly get.\n\nI don't feel like going on for ten pages about how it changed black metal (since I don't think it really did much at all) or how awesome it is for whatever reason of the moment, so let's just look at a few specific factors that make this such a great and mandatory release:\n\n-Attila's vocal performance is bar none one of the best in black metal. If you dislike Attila's vocals, you have no business judging music at all. They perfectly fit the atmosphere and music that Mayhem created at this time. They're daring, unique, and flawlessly executed, and all those who feel that this album would be better with Dead involved seriously need to think about why they would prefer generic black metal vocals to one of the most stirring black metal performances of all time. Both strange and rich in tone and daringly operatic and melodramatic, Attila is really the critical force on this album that holds it all together. With any other singer, this wouldn't be nearly as great, because the nasal and harsh yet strangely unaggressive intonations of Attila form a magnificent contrast with the unique and utterly non-stereotypical black metal the band plays. His clean, definitively majestic wailings in the title track alone are enough to prove his quality as a vocalist and artistic force. While in many black metal bands the vocals are merely a backdrop of convention used to add rhythm, on this release they're absolutely critical to the success of the album as a whole.\n\n-The riffcraft is just flawless and has yet to be cloned in any significant way by another artist. Euronymous was making great, thrashy riffs and gorgeous tremolo-picked melodies as well as some fantastic lead guitar, and everything he does is just perfect on this album. There are no filler riffs. Each one is as incisive and amazingly catchy as the last, and most are far more complex than the majority of black metal from over a decade later. There's nothing to say about them; you listen, you understand.\n\n-The production is about as good as it could possibly get, with naturally produced reverb and probably one of the best drum production jobs in all of black metal. It captures the atmosphere of the music perfectly, with each instrument very clear and present, along with an awesome guitar tone that's ferocious and cold yet very melodic and tonal as well.\n\nReally, it all comes down to the atmosphere. While other black metal bands these days are all obsessed with war and Satan and nocturnal grimness and what have you, Mayhem went in a decidedly more gothic direction than that. There's still tracks about Satan and winter and stuff but they seem expressed in a somewhat more subtle, occult fashion. It reminds me of the first Gorgoroth album on some level, with a definitely different feel from other black metal from the same time period (and from the future), which seemed concentrated on conjuring a mood in which aggression was only a part, not the whole damn thing. It's just so obvious that much more time and effort was put into crafting these songs than the vast majority of black metal; I guess that's tragic on one level, but I guess you can't expect much more.\n\nAnyway, 'De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas' is just as good as everyone says. You should buy it if you don't currently own it. Fun fact: the opening two songs which everyone already knows by heart are easily the weakest tracks on the disc. When 'Cursed In Eternity' kicks in, you'll know where the good stuff is. 'Buried By Time And Dust', the title track... well, whatever, just go and get it.\n",
        "\nI'll start by getting production value out of the way. It's terrible. However, considering that the set was recorded nearly twenty years ago on equipment that, even then, would have hardly been state of the art, this seems like a facet not worth dwelling on.\n\nWhat does matter is the performance, and that does not disappoint in the least. Dead is simply amazing. As much as I enjoyed Maniac's vocals on the classic, Deathcrush, they are just blown out of the water by Dead's poorly recorded contribution. He offers up a growl that is hard to miss, and harder to forget. He is not performing for laughs, it couldn't be clearer, and that sincerity really plays into the albums favor.\n\nSimilarly, the rest of the band turns in a great performance as well, as they rip through a set littered with Deathcrush stand-outs and a smattering of songs later featured on the follow-up, De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas. Euronymous shreds from track one straight to the end, showing the same no-nonsense flair showcased in the first EP.\n\nHellhammer also gives a great, though somewhat workman-like, performance. It gets the job done, but he doesn't turn in some of the variation offered by Manheim on Deathcrush. That being said, given its a live recording, the drums are a lot more raw and hard hitting.\n\nNot much can be said about the bass. Simply put, you can't really hear what the hell Necrobutcher's doing. It should also be noted that this is not limited to some of the songs, or even most of them, but all.\n\nAll in all the first nine tracks of the album are really something special. Showcasing what was once an incredible band at arguably their finest hour. At the same time, you can't help but think what might have happened had Dead not checked himself out so early. A voice like that with some real recording equipment to capture it would have been a treat indeed, perhaps eliminating the misstep that was Attila Csihar, and the partial-birth abortion that was Maniac's return.\n\nThe final four tracks are pulled from a live set in 1986 featuring the same lineup as Deathcrush, which was released the following year. We have a handful of Venom and Celtic Frost covers, none of which offer anything much of worth, and certainly nothing more than the originals they are based on.\n\nHighlights : Death Crush, Funeral Fog, Chainsaw Gutsfuck\n",
        "\n\u201cOut from the Dark\u201d has an important significance in the history of Mayhem. This release is actually a recording of vocalist Dead\u2019s final rehearsal with Mayhem before he committed suicide. Now, this is a review of the music, not the history, so I\u2019m not going to go into the history behind this, but Mayhem completists really should consider this essential purely because of its historical value. Probably not a bad thing, because the music is pretty good on it as well!\n\n\u201cOut from the Dark\u201d is surprisingly well recorded compared to other similar recordings of the band during this era, so if you\u2019re turned off by bad sound, you shouldn\u2019t be worried too much about this one. The sound is raw but clear, and all the instruments are easily audible. The playing is quite good considering the many stuff-ups on live albums/bootlegs such as \u201cLive in Leipzig\u201d or \u201cDawn of the Black Hearts\u201d and the guitars in particular have a really raw, tone to them. What\u2019s perhaps most surprising, and certainly evident during \u201cPure Fucking Armageddon\u201d is that this is all the songs are very well structured. Even the normally wild and random guitar solo of the aforementioned song sounds natural and structured beyond what the band normally did live with the songs from the \u201cDeathcrush\u201d and \u201cPure Fucking Armageddon\u201d releases. Just to throw a spanner in the works, the solos have this strangely thrash like sound to them in regards to the guitar tone. Albums such as \u201cLive in Leipzig\u201d masked this perhaps important element to the sound of the older songs on show here in favour of a more chaotic and \u201cloose\u201d approach. The songs from \u201cDe Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\u201d are all played pretty much to the book, and really offer no variation in playing to what was being played by the band all throughout the late eighties and early nineties. This goes right down to the pounding drums opening \u201cFuneral Fog\u201d played by Hellhammer. Speaking of Hellhammer, his drum work throughout this release is solid, displaying a slightly more free and chaotic style than what he plays during present times, using heavy emphasis on his cymbal work. As for good old Necrobutcher, he just sits there and plucks away at that bass of his, not really doing all that much. Quite a letdown, because the best Mayhem releases feature the bass quite prominently, providing a solid and crushing backdrop to Euronymous\u2019 razor sharp guitar tone. The only time you\u2019re going to take notice of Necro is when \u201cFreezing Moon\u201d gives way to the bass break around the halfway mark.\n\nOf course, there\u2019s really only one reason why anybody would go out of their way to hear this (unless you\u2019re like me and go searching to hear and every version of a Mayhem song ever recorded) and that reason is vocalist Dead. To be honest, this is one of his more average performances. While he certainly screams his way through this album far better than his uninspired performance on \u201cLive in Leipzig,\u201d ultimately he just doesn\u2019t live up to the expectations I have of the man after hearing his other performances on other live albums and rehearsals. Perhaps part of the problem is the \u201cmixing\u201d of this, he sounds quiet on song songs, but far too loud on others. Whether this stems from Dead having trouble controlling his voice volume when doing his thing, or whether it\u2019s just due to the recording equipment used, I have no idea, but it is quite distracting.\n\nAs for the songs themselves, I won\u2019t delve too much into them here to be honest. All the respective albums will have a review coming from me where I shall explain my thoughts on them, but I honestly believe they\u2019re all good. As mentioned, the \u201cDe Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\u201d songs are all played to the book and the songs form \u201cDeathcrush\u201d and \u201cPure Fucking Armageddon\u201d are just about as well, bar a slightly less chaotic style and a more intricate drum performance than Manheim\u2019s work on the originals. The track list essentially represents a Mayhem set list at the time, with three songs from \u201cDe Mysteriis,\u201d three from \u201cDeathcrush\u201d and one that has appeared on both \u201cDeathcrush\u201d and \u201cPure Fucking Armageddon\u201d (if you\u2019re too lazy to browse Metal Archives, that would be \u201cPure Fucking Armageddon\u201d). All the songs are performed well, but nothing stands out as brilliant.\n\n\u201cOut from the Dark\u201d is an interesting rehearsal, there\u2019s no doubt about it. It\u2019s well performed and intense all the way through. If dubbed some crowd noises over this, you\u2019d have an easy time getting a newcomer to the band believing this is a live album. I like this release, but I don\u2019t listen to it often, there\u2019s just better Mayhem releases out there from this era (and others for that matter) that are better than \u201cOut from the Dark.\u201d If someone wanted a release to guide them into listening to Mayhem\u2019s Euronymous era, \u201cOut from the Dark\u201d would be a pretty good place to start. It\u2019s clean but raw, intense and features a good selection of songs. You\u2019re not going to find this to buy any more as it long ago sold out, however give it a download and a listen anyway if you\u2019re looking into the band, or are simply searching around for more Mayhem songs with Dead singing on them. Interesting historically, and a fine performance, but certainly not essential Mayhem.\n\nOh yeah, sorry for the cheesy title.\n",
        "\nNote: I\u2019m only reviewing the Mayhem side of the split, the Zyklon-B version may come at a later date.\n\nOh hell yes, the opening to \u201cNecrolust\u201d, a Mayhem classic in anybody\u2019s books. \u201cNecrolust/Total Warfare\u201d is a short split release between Mayhem and Zyklon-B, one of the premier black metal bands in the world and a short-lived \u201csupergroup\u201d of black metallers, whose only songs were three fast-paced black metal songs and this split\u2019s remix of one of them. At this point, I will be honest here; this reeks of cash-in. On the Mayhem side, we\u2019re given a previously unreleased studio recording of \u201cNecrolust\u201d recorded sometime after the band reformed, an interesting prospect to say the least\u2026\n\nSo if it\u2019s a cash-in, is it any good? Well, for the most part, yes. \u201cNecrolust,\u201d from what I can tell, was recorded during the \u201cWolf\u2019s Lair Abyss\u201d sessions; the guitar tone is almost an exact match. The song itself strongly lends itself to the line-up of this release, with Maniac\u2019s fast vocal delivery a highlight here. Blasphemer\u2019s guitar playing is spot-on as is Hellhammer\u2019s drumming, while Necrobutcher\u2019s bass work is largely buried in the mix (strange for a band that usually seems eager to emphasise the works of its bassist). On this recording, some weird reverb (maybe \u201cwah\u201d as well? I can\u2019t profess much knowledge in the realm of guitar effects unfortunately) effects are placed on the solo towards the end. Maniac\u2019s vocals also get the reverb treatment, to very good effect, echoing nicely after he spits out those awesome four lines in five seconds verses (as he should, this is fucking NECROLUST!). Perhaps my only misgiving towards this particular version of Necrolust is that it simply isn\u2019t as good as the versions on the \u201cDeathcrush\u201d EP, or live album \u201cMediolanum Capta Est.\u201d \u201cMediolanum Capta Est\u201d in particular emphasised everything great about this song; it\u2019s crushingly heavy and fast as fuck. On this split however, it\u2019s just that tiny bit too slow, and I have to say it, too clean and polished. \u201cNecrolust\u201d is best as a live track where the savageness and fury of both band and song can combine to turn this into the beast it is, this version lacks that fury.\n\nOn this release, Mayhem showcases a very good, yet not particularly needed rendition of one of the band\u2019s classics. Perhaps this was simply released to show the fans how Mayhem could still kick arse in the studio, but a more likely reason is that the label wanted a cheap buck, not to mention the collectors wanting yet another Mayhem release to fawn over. Ultimately though, and this is all that really matters, Maniac goes \"NEEEEEEEEECROOOOOOLUUUUUUUUST!\"\n",
        "\nThe strange and annoying opening track that is \u2018Silvester Anfang\u2019 is no way to introduce any metal album, let alone this one. Comprised of a weird drum beat and odd, unfitting keyboards, you want to press the \u2018next\u2019 button like you\u2019re swatting a fly. Thankfully, it lasts only 1:57 before giving way to what needs no musical introduction, rather a half-hour of praying to your God to pardon what you\u2019re about to do. Deathcrush was released in 1986 and it\u2019s hard to think exactly where Mayhem\u2019s style of music came from. Fast, ferocious and primitive guitars that sound like chainsaws; high-pitched shrieks; the bass distorted, prominent and every bit as evil as the guitars and the frantic drumming combine to create a sound that had never been heard before and has rarely been heard since. The riffs are of indescribable wickedness: never has such an ominous atmosphere been so effectively constructed in such simplistic music.\n\nVocals tend to be a pretty negligible aspect of black metal, in that they\u2019re mostly the same and tend to blend in with the background. That is not the case on Deathcrush: the vocals are as good as any other aspect of the music, that is, they are perfect. Mayhem were one of the first to use this style of high-pitched shrieking, which would later be used by the likes of Bestial Summoning, Nepenthe and Burzum. They convincingly pull off an insane vibe that many bands over the years have aimed for (most falling short of it). Lyrically, Mayhem focuses on death, gore and Satan, a combination that was not that cheesy at the time and even now amounts to good, unhealthy fun. Really, how can you not love a song name like \u2018Chainsaw Gutsfuck\u2019?\n\nThe punk-like attitude of the band, a \u201cyou don\u2019t like our music? Fuck you we don\u2019t care!\u201d attitude is great and the result is an EP that\u2019s as aggressive as anything before or since. When you look at the history of black metal, it gets a bit sketchy when you dig back past 1985, but Mayhem can honestly be said to have presented the most pure black metal up to about 1990. There is nothing else you could want in an EP, except perhaps for it to be longer. This is the be-all and end-all of black metal; it is everything that the genre ever aspired to be, everything that the genre can ever achieve, and was released a good 5 or 6 years before the black metal movement really kicked off. Deathcrush is an absolutely essential EP for any metalhead, or anybody interested in hearing the birth of a genre.\n",
        "\n\u201cGrand Declaration of War\u201d, the mere mention of the name provokes strong reactions throughout Mayhem\u2019s fan base and the whole black metal community. Liking this album is often attributed to \u201copen-mindedness\u2122,\u201d a sad fact indeed. \u201cGrand Declaration of War\u201d is not about being musically open-minded; otherwise I myself would not like it so much. \u201cGrand Declaration of War\u201d is not about YOUR OPINION, \u201cGrand Declaration of War\u201d is just \u201cGrand Declaration of War\u201d. There\u2019s nothing there to it, you like this album, or you don\u2019t. You might be a diehard \u201cTransilvanian Hunger\u201d love child, eager to suck the nipple of the style for eternity, yet still like this album. The next person who has the same musical taste may hate it. It\u2019s strange in that way, and, at least in my mind, misinterpreted. \u201cGrand Declaration of War\u201d appears to be something so abstract on the surface, and it very well may be. The thing is though, the abstractness is calculated, and it\u2019s there. You can\u2019t change this album, it doesn\u2019t care about you. It doesn\u2019t care about me. It doesn\u2019t care about any of us.\n\nAs said, \u201cGrand Declaration of War\u201d is downright abstract in its construction as an album. You\u2019ve probably read the previous reviews on this very website. An electronica song (NOT techno, but I\u2019ll get to that later), a song with two sentences of spoken word followed by silence, a track with a mere seven seconds of silence, and that\u2019s it. Indeed, as I type this the slow electronic pulse of \u201cA Bloodsword and a Colder Sun [Part II]\u201d is coming through my speakers. How could a band such as Mayhem make such an album? Heck, the same line-up produced the straight-forward, and damn dark \u201cWolf\u2019s Lair Abyss\u201d EP just three years earlier. If one could argue anything for this album, it\u2019s that it has vision. \u201cGrand Declaration of War\u201d is not composed as a series of songs, one after another. It\u2019s an album, somewhat of a concept album in actuality, which must be listened to as an album to appreciate. I was once conversing with a detractor of this album. Despite our differing opinions on the album, the one thing we agreed on is that this works better listened to in full. Perhaps the most interesting thing here is that the album is almost approached in a similar manner to how many noise and ambient artists approach their live performances. It has that \u201ccalculated improvisation\u201d feel to it and as the album continues on, it becomes more abstract, culminating in the \u201csilent\u201d tracks mentioned before, and the outro, \u201cCompletion in Science of Agony [Part II].\u201d\n\nThis same approach applies to the way the instruments are played and utilised as well. Often the rhythm of the songs is buried underneath multiple layers of guitars. That by the way is my favourite element to this album. The guitars almost seem to \u201cfly in,\u201d leaving the bass to continue the song as the guitars do their thing. Anybody who\u2019s heard Emperor\u2019s \u201cPrometheus\u201d album may have a general idea of what I\u2019m talking about, though on \u201cGrand Declaration of War\u201d it sounds much more natural and significant in its execution. The drumming varies immensely as well, from slow beats on \u201cCompletion in Science of Agony [Part I]\u201d (an amazing beast of a song, showing a combination of black metal and doom that results in one of the most eerie and COLD tracks ever heard by this reviewer\u2019s ears), to the powerful marching beats in \u201cA Grand Declaration of War\u201d and \u201cView from Nihil [Part I].\u201d Marching beats have always been a favourite of mine, and pretty much guaranteed this album a high score from the beginning, but on Grand Declaration of War this simple idea is taken to the next level. \u201cA Grand Declaration of War\u201d uses them in a more atmospheric manner, helping to build up for the rest of the album. To follow the concept of the album, the war is about to be declared, the band is preparing. Continue listening to \u201cView from Nihil [Part I]\u201d and the marching beats have taken a more prominent role, a call to war accompanied by the amazing spoken word performance of Maniac creating a truly war like atmosphere. This logically brings me to my next point, Maniac\u2019s vocals, which are a roughly 50/50 split of spoken word and traditional harsh black metal shrieking. Much like the rest of the album, you are going to like his vocals, or hate them. Maniac was often described as a charismatic front man around the time of this album\u2019s release, which shows in the album. The charisma is put to use in an absolutely stunning spoken word performance, bringing to mind a general marshalling his troops to war. \u201cView from Nihil [Part I]\u201d is the best example of this, it\u2019s almost disappointing when the spoken word and marching beats end to bring in the blinding speed the rest of the song possesses. Accompanied with the frequent use of the man\u2019s harsh vocal styling, the infamous \u201craped cat,\u201d Maniac provides a truly memorable vocal performance. Whether you hate this album or love it; THAT will be the thing you remember after listening to \u201cGrand Declaration of War.\u201d Lyrically \u201cGrand Declaration of War\u201d follows an aggressive anti-Christian theme/concept. The title is perhaps the best summary of the lyrics; it\u2019s a declaration of war against Christianity. The lyrics are well written yet incredibly (and genuinely) hateful. It may seem pretty clich\u00e9, but Mayhem actually sounds like they mean what they say here and later interviews with Maniac and the rest of the band most definitely confirm this.\n\nTo give a sort of summary to the individual tracks of this album (I tend to prefer the term \u201ctrack\u201d over \u201csong\u201d in reference to this album, for obvious reasons) would be difficult, and an injustice to the album. As I previously stated, this album must be listened to as a whole, not as \u201csongs.\u201d The album progresses quite logically, starting with \u201cA Grand Declaration of War,\u201d a track that falls somewhere between an intro and a traditional song. Marching beats accompanied by a raspy whisper set the mood for the rest of the album. It\u2019s one of my favourite tracks of all time, and the perfect way to open the album. This opens the floodgates and progresses into \u201cIn the Lies Where Upon You Lay,\u201d an extremely fast song accompanied by one of Maniac\u2019s spoken word performances. The shout of \u201cyour life is DEAD priest!\u201d is awe-inspiring, testament to the sheer hatred that Maniac holds for Christianity. \u201cA Time to Die\u201d starts turning the album more abstract. It\u2019s actually quite simple underneath all the guitars, but the speed is absolutely amazing in this song. It remains a live staple even in 2008, as it should be. Aggression is paramount to \u201cA Time to Die,\u201d which makes \u201cView from Nihil [Part I]\u201d even more shocking. In my opinion, this is Mayhem\u2019s greatest live song. When Maniac performed this song with conviction, it showed. Bootlegs and live albums show a crowd immersed in the energy of the song, and it\u2019s perfectly placed on this album as well. Once again, the album becomes more abstract here, with a transition through \u201cView from Nihil [Part II].\u201d \n\n\u201cA Bloodsword and a Colder Sun.\u201d The first part of this highly controversial two part piece is essentially a whispered introduction before sequencing into the cold electronic beats of Part II. Here it must be stated, though a song belonging to the \u201celectronica\u201d genre, this is most definitely not techno. If you\u2019ve been off put from listening to this album because you\u2019re expecting a bouncy pop song, then you\u2019ve been misinformed. In fact, this is one of Mayhem\u2019s darkest and most haunting tracks, but in context it is amazingly abstract and completely unexpected for a first time listener. You may have noticed that \u201cGrand Declaration of War\u201d is split into \u201cPart II\u201d and \u201cPart III\u201d (\u201cWolf\u2019s Lair Abyss\u201d is \u201cPart I\u201d). \u201cA Bloodsword and a Colder Sun\u201d is the first piece in \u201cPart III,\u201d and sets the standard for the rest of the album, which is Mayhem at their most abstract and, watch out here, experimental. This is shown further on \u201cCrystallized Pain in Deconstruction,\u201d which although a return to metal, is no less abstract or complex than its previous tracks. \u201cCrystallized Pain in Deconstruction\u201d features the most of the \u201cfly in\u201d guitar technique described earlier, so much it\u2019s almost confusing on the first listen. There is a good three guitar tracks, with the possibility of a fourth present in places in the song, lending it an extremely \u201ccomplex\u201d sound. It\u2019s almost strange how it progresses into \u201cCompletion in Science of Agony [Part I].\u201d The track before was aggressive, fast, yet we get\u2026 a doom song? Yep, it\u2019s slow and atmospheric, unheard of by Mayhem to this extent. It\u2019s probably the coldest song I\u2019ve ever heard, and sends chills down my spine every listen. It\u2019s haunting, scary and eerie. It\u2019s every synonym you can find in the thesaurus for those words and more. You might also like to look up the word \u201cawesome\u201d in your dictionary, because that\u2019s never fitted more to a song. Finally, \u201cTo Daimonion\u201d is presented. \u201cPart I\u201d of this three part piece is a somewhat \u201crockish\u201d song, it\u2019s puzzling like much of this album, especially coming off a song like \u201cCompletion in Science of Agony [Part I].\u201d \u201cTo Daimonion\u201d has, much as with \u201cA Time to Die,\u201d become a live staple for Mayhem well into 2008 (and hopefully well into the future!). \u201cPart II\u201d is where the abstract component of \u201cGrand Declaration of War\u201d finally presents itself wholly, with Maniac speaking \u201cI remember the future. A new beginning of time\u201d, then followed by nearly five minutes of silence. To top it off, \u201cPart III\u201d is just seven seconds of silence, and nothing more. I used to dislike this, it just seemed like a stupid wasted of a track; but when put into context, the idea just seems to work. The album closes \u201cCompletion in Science of Agony [Part II],\u201d an outro that rounds of the album perfectly. On a side note, the \u201cbonus track\u201d (found BEFORE \u201cA Grand Declaration of War\u201d on the CD, rewind the disc from the start to listen to it or download it from the band\u2019s website) is essentially a rawer version of this outro.\n\n\u201cGrand Declaration of War\u201d is a unique album within metal. Nobody, not even the band themselves is ever going to attempt to make this album again. It\u2019s calculated down to the finest details; just take a look at the cover for proof. On the first look, it\u2019s just a dead bird. But look at it closely, it\u2019s a dove impaled on barbed wire. Killing a prominent icon of piece with war time equipment? Great symbolism and it simply adds to the album\u2019s feeling before the first song even sounds. I love this album, you may or may not. I cannot give any comparisons to other bands or albums, because there is none. Don\u2019t approach this album with an \u201copen-mind,\u201d don\u2019t approach it with any opinion at all. Going into this album with any sort of expectation completely ruins the point of the album, if there is indeed one at all. I\u2019m glad I did this, I just thought \u201clet\u2019s give it a listen and see what it\u2019s like\u201d and then I listened to it. If there\u2019s one thing I want this review to convey to the reader, it\u2019s that point, because you\u2019ll be all the better for it. If you hate it, you hate it. If you love it, you love it. Perhaps the best way to experience this is first hearing it without even knowing what it is. Listen to the album, not the people nor the reviews. Listen not to other\u2019s opinions of this, go into the listening session with absolutely no expectations whatsoever, for good or bad, listen to the album, and make up your mind. Of course, that might render this review completely pointless but at the end of the day remember one thing; it doesn\u2019t care about you. It doesn\u2019t care about me. It doesn\u2019t care about any of us.\n",
        "\nThe title pretty much sums up the album - the next logical step for Mayhem to take after their masterpiece, which, mind you, is now a quite different band due to Blasphemer being the major songwriter here. Everything has been increased since their fist LP: the aggression, the heaviness, the brutality, the intensity, the technicality and the dark atmosphere. What you have here is 20 minutes of uncompromising black metal that takes no survivors.\n\nThe album begins with an electronic intro - a omen of things to come in GDoW - which, frankly, isn't that interesting and could be a minute or so shorter. After it finishes (or you press the skip button) you get the beginning drum roll of \"I am thy Labyrinth\" and the insane riffing starts hitting you mercilessly in the head. By the time the album finishes with the last chilling riff of \"Symbols of Bloodswords\", your neck will be begging for mercy.\n\nWhat is notable at first listen is the different production sound: the guitars are much more sharp and chilling, the drums are (badly, of course) triggered to hell and back, the bass has a more ballsy sound and generally, it sounds more cold than DMDS. Unfortunately, it does sound somewhat mechanical due to the drums, but it's not that big of a fault.\n\nStarting from the first moment, you get some aggressive riffing pounding on your face. The death metal influence is apparent here, especially in \"Fall of Seraphs\", which gives this album a quite vicious and brutal edge, while not losing its black metal roots. What is remarkable here is that some of the riffs seem to be \"borrowed\" from Euronymous, but this fact makes no difference - it is actually better that his riffs were brought to us in an album, rather than die with him. The riffing is considerably more technical than DMDS, without becoming masturbation at the least, and it being pretty catchy is a major plus. The guitar tone is quite good, too - a chilling, overdistorted sound, perfect for black metal. The bass work by Necrobutcher is pretty good as well: check out the middle break in \"Ancient Skin\" and the outro riff of \"Symbols of Bloodswords\".\n\nHellhammer gives a stellar performance here, with great hi-hat/cymbal work accenting the blast beats, which predominate the album. Occasionaly he bursts into some nice double bass, but the downside is, the bass drums sound too clicky and do not have enough bass frequencies. The snare sounds ok and the general mix is good, but the bass drum sound is unacceptable, and detracts from the listening experience. Other than that, he shows a great mastery of the kit, playing parts that compliment every guitar riff, while keeping obnoxiousness to a minimum.\n\nEveryone's beloved vocalist Maniac handles the vocals here, and he sounds nothing like he did in \"Deathcrush\". In this album, he started the anally violated feline vocals tradition. While his vocals are something that, with time, you get used to, the first listen might prove embarassing for some. Do not let him ruin the great riffing, though, and continue with listening the album. Here, he also starts showing signs of experimentation, featuring clean vocals (which, I have to admit, are very good) in every track, although nothing as obvious as GDoW. His lyrics are obviously influenced by Nietsche and are worth a read, too.\n\nOverall, the songwriting is great, with the riffs flowing into each other and the songs being memorable and not boring at all. The exception is \"Fall of Seraphs\", which meanders a bit in the middle sections, but the great riffs featured more than make up for that. The production is also very good, with the mix perfectly balanced, and, while not being raw, it sounds very dark and cold.\n\nIf you are interested in black metal with a hateful feel, a brutal edge and a healthy dose of catchy riffing, here's the EP for you!\n",
        "\nLive in Leipzig is one of those albums that has attained legendary status within the black metal community, and even within much of the wider metal community. Unfortunately, Live in Leipzig is mostly undeserving of the praise sent towards it, it\u2019s the worst thing the Dead-era Mayhem put out by far, and is a mostly boring and dull album. We\u2019ve all seen the \u201cDEAD IS TOTALLY POSSESSED ON LIVE IN LEIPZIG ZOMG!!!\u201d comments, and at times this is true, but for the most part, it simply is false.\n\nPerhaps the most important aspect contributing to the lifelessness of Live in Leipzig is the crowd and band interaction. On very few live albums have I heard both the crowd and band have so little intensity and excitement. Everybody here is bored, including the band. It shows, the crowd is barely clapping between songs and Dead tries a number of times to provoke the crowd into action (Notably his introduction to \u201cCarnage\u201d, \u201cARE YOU DEAD? HUH?\u201d). In turn, the band starts becoming lacklustre during a number of the songs on offer here. \u201cFuneral Fog\u201d in particular offers a somewhat hopeful beginning, before descending into mediocrity courtesy of Dead, his screams of \u201cfuuuuuuuuuuuneral fog!\u201d sounding weak and, to be frank, pathetic due to their delivery. If I want to hear Dead \u201cpossessed\u201d, as so many people put it, I\u2019ll go listen to Dawn of the Black Hearts or Live in Jessheim.\n\nThe rest of the band isn\u2019t on top of their game as well. A number of drum and guitar parts are screwed up by Hellhammer and Euronymous respectively, which while by itself isn\u2019t much of a bad thing, it DOES become bad when you\u2019re playing \u201cDeathcrush\u201d or \u201cChainsaw Gutsfuck\u201d at \u00be speed, resulting in any mistakes sticking out like a paintball on a white hat. While we\u2019re on that subject, why the fuck did they play the aforementioned songs so slowly? \u201cDeathcrush\u201d sounds like shit and \u201cChainsaw Gutsfuck\u201d is barely passable. The same line-up played the same songs on the same tour at regular speeds and sounded great; the versions on offer on Live in Leipzig are just shitting on the originals from the Deathcrush EP.\n\nThis album is often praised due to its \u201crawness.\u201d It\u2019s often recommended to new black metal listeners followed by such sentences as \u201c\u2026the sound may put you off though.\u201d I\u2019m sorry people, but you must be on some pretty heavy drugs because as Live in Leipzig is as clear as day. All the instruments are audible, from Euronymous\u2019 frankly AWESOME guitar tone, to Necrobutcher\u2019s guttural bass lines and Hellhammer\u2019s pretty bad sounding drums (which are a bit too loud in my opinion). Another unfortunate thing that keeps this album from being anything worth your time is the fact that the recording is not raw, but poor. A number of glitches are present throughout the recording, most noticeably the huge screech from the microphone at the beginning of \u201cBuried Time by Dust.\u201d It\u2019s disappointing to hear what is one of the better performances of this song ruined by a glitch stuffing up the intro.\n\nThe set-list itself is what is to be expected from a Mayhem show during the time period it was recorded in. Four songs from Deathcrush, Pure Fucking Armageddon\u2019s \u201cCarnage\u201d makes one it\u2019s many appearances (a live staple of Mayhem\u2019s since their beginnings really) and the remaining four songs are taken from De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas, an album still in the writing stages when this show took place. Nothing really stands out here with the glaring exception of show closer \u201cPure Fucking Armageddon.\u201d Somewhat of a rebel, the song jumps off the Mediocrity Train of Mediocre Mediocrity and becomes an unexpected standout performance. Indeed, this is one of THE finest performances of the song, where slowing the song back down to the speed it was played at on the original demo actually benefits it as that awesome riff at the beginning of the song is allowed to be heard and fully appreciated (anybody who denies the awesomeness of that riff should be shot).\n\nReally, let\u2019s look at Live in Leipzig critically. The band plays poorly, crowd and band interaction is virtually non-existent barring Dead\u2019s last ditch attempt at the beginning of \u201cPure Fucking Armageddon\u201d and the recording is littered with glitches and annoying sounds. \u201cDeathcrush\u201d got butchered here and the rest of the songs are not up to scratch (again, barring \u201cPure Fucking Armageddon). Live in Leipzig is a boring live album from a band and line-up that has made such brilliant material it leaves me speechless at times. If you\u2019re looking for Dead at his best, go download Dawn of the Black Hearts, Live in Jessheim or Live in Zeitz, it\u2019s just a damn shame the band chose to release the Leipzig show in its official form.\n",
        "\nIn my mind, a lot of the hate thrown in the Blasphemer-era Mayhem\u2019s direction is unwarranted. A lot of said hate is thrown at Maniac and his infamous \u201craped-cat\u201d vocal style, but I have a feeling most of it is just the Euronymous and Dead fan boys unwilling to accept the new Mayhem and who continue to ever fellate the Dead-era Mayhem simply because the principal members of the band are dead (pun not intended). Of course, they may simply not like the music, but I digress\u2026 \u201cChimera\u201d is often compared to 1997\u2019s \u201cWolf\u2019s Lair Abyss\u201d, and I can see that. I however view the album as more of a synthesis between \u201cWolf\u2019s Lair Abyss\u201d and \u201cGrand Declaration of War\u201d. Don\u2019t let that off put you if you hated that album for its eccentricities, \u201cChimera\u201d is very much a step back from that album. Essentially, this is \u201cWolf\u2019s Lair Abyss\u201d without the claustrophobic atmosphere and chilling production. In a way, it\u2019s almost a mechanical album, yet retains a sense of human aggression not seen since \u201cMediolanum Capta Est\u201d, or if we want to keep in the studio, \u201cDeathcrush\u201d.\n\nManiac\u2019s vocal performances during his stint with the \u201cnew\u201d Mayhem are often much maligned. Detractors who were previous turned off by Maniac\u2019s strangled vocals will be hearing a pleasant surprise on \u201cChimera\u201d as the man rasps, chokes and screams his way brilliantly through the album. Never letting down, his one mellow moment being a very haunting chant during \u201cMy Death\u201d. Yes, the clean vocals from \u201cGrand Declaration of War\u201d are gone. I personally enjoyed Maniac\u2019s performance on that album, however anybody who thinks such a clean vocal style could work on \u201cChimera\u201d is fooling themselves.\n\nThe sound on Chimera is brilliant. Cold and mechanical is what Chimera is all about. The bass is audible (and sounding great) and Blasphemer\u2019s guitars are brilliantly produced to bring out the magnificently written riffs. If you\u2019re not getting your face torn off on \u201cWhore\u201d or \u201cYou Must Fall\u201d, then prepare for twisted riffs that are sometimes, to be frank, fucking scary. Blasphemer\u2019s effort on this album is commendable, the utterly repulsive (in a good way) title track being particularly notable. The bass work on Chimera is also very nice, with the start of \u201cImpious Devious Leper Lord\u201d displaying a very disturbing sounding bass line for much of the song.\n\nUnfortunately Hellhammer\u2019s drums are still triggered which while not too annoying, does detract from the album. When he\u2019s playing slower, it does become a problem, because the same snare sound hits you powerfully, which IS annoying. When he\u2019s doing his good old blasting, it\u2019s not so bad, as with all high speed drumming it can become a slight blur which is actually a good thing as it gives more room for Blasphemer and Maniac to work their (black) magic. While we\u2019re on the topic of Hellhammer, does he take steroids? His ability to play fast for long periods of time with flawless accuracy is amazing and simply adds to the before mentioned \u201cmechanical\u201d feel of the album.\n\nLyrically the album is great. Maniac\u2019s well written anti-Christian lyrics manage to avoid the slum of more simplistic bands while avoiding the pretentiousness of bands like Deathspell Omega\u2026 At least for the most part. At times it does stray either way, particularly in \u201cWhore\u201d (that\u2019s towards the \u201cSATAN, I\u2019M HOME!\u201d side of the spectrum).\n\nUnlike \u201cGrand Declaration of War\u201d or the more recent \u201cOrdo Ad Chao\u201d (which has a lot of \u201cChimera\u201d sounding riffs on it, something that seems to have escaped many people), \u201cChimera\u201d is not so much an album that needs to be listened end-to-end to appreciate. Indeed, it\u2019s quite easy to pick out a few highlight tracks from an album which is a consistently great album. \u201cYou Must Fall\u201d is an awesome song, beginning with the album\u2019s fastest section outside of \u201cWhore\u201d and progressing into a very \u201cimperial\u201d sounding song. Don\u2019t take \u201cimperial\u201d as an Emperor reference though, because I mean \u201croyal\u201d, if you get what I mean! It\u2019s hard to describe really, but that song in particular is absolutely perfect and one of the first songs I heard from Mayhem. Obviously it made a good impression! \u201cMy Death\u201d is also worth a mention and is most memorable song of the album. A mid-paced song filled with chilling chants and evil riffs, \u201cMy Death\u201d is the song that best represents \u201cChimera\u2019s\u201d sound as a whole. Finally, the title track is an amazing way to finish the album, slowly plodding its way to the albums finish.\n\n\u201cChimera\u201d is an album that kicks some serious butt, there\u2019s no doubt about it in my mind. Ignore the naysayers of this album and listen to it yourself. This is an album that is brutal, yet twisted and is exactly what Mayhem needed after \u201cGrand Declaration of War\u201d. The songs vary in tempo, flit between atmospheric and outright aggressive and yet maintain a sense of cohesion sadly missing from many recent albums. Blasphemer may say he\u2019s disappointed with this album, but he shouldn\u2019t be as \u201cChimera\u201d proudly earns its spot in the Mayhem discography and even eclipses many of the band\u2019s other releases. \"Chimera\" ranks as one of my favourite releases in Mayhem's discography, right behind Deathcrush and earns that position for every moment during the album. It isn't perfect, but then, nothing really is (well, very little). This style would be continued in a more un-orthodox manner on \u201cOrdo Ad Chao\u201d, but do not mistake this as a simple embryonic form of that album as this is a full-fledged beast, ready to destroy you and spit you back out into the void.\n",
        "\nMalcolm Dome once said about Venom\u2019s At War With Satan, \u201cIt\u2019s the moment Venom reached for the stars. A glorious failure then? That\u2019s very harsh. Just make up your own mind.\u201d In a way, this single is much like At War With Satan. At War With Satan has great songs, no doubt about it, and so does this single. However, something just doesn\u2019t click when listening to either records. You\u2019re listening and thinking, \u201cFUCK YES, CARNAGE!\u201d and you\u2019re headbanging, but it\u2019s just not something you\u2019d listen to seven times a week (or even day\u2026). Maybe Mayhem WERE reaching for the stars, and that\u2019d be no surprise to me. For all his self-proclaimed \u201cCommunist\u201d leanings, Euronymous really was quite a greedy business man as far as I can tell, but just like many bands trying to make it big something is missing. Integrity maybe? Who knows, but there is something this record is missing\u2026\n\nThat something would be two things, one for each track. When it comes to Carnage, the aggression is missing. Listen to live versions (any Mayhem era) or the versions on the Pure Fucking Armageddon demo and you will hear one thing above all else: absolutely intense, raw aggression. That\u2019s what made the song great in the first place! Here the aggression is lacking, particularly in Dead\u2019s vocals. Now, don\u2019t get me wrong, they\u2019re great on this release, second only to his effort on Dawn of the Black Hearts (or maybe December Moon, but let\u2019s keep this to Mayhem), but it seems Dead is aiming for a more atmospheric effect here. While it sounds cool, everything but his screams of \u201cKILL!\u201d during the first two verses sound out of place. The other element contributing to this lack of aggression is the guitar tone. Again, it\u2019s nice, it\u2019s thick, but where the hell is the screeching solos from the live albums? Not to mention the riff at 2:10, which is normally one of my favourite riffs by Mayhem or any other metal band sounds weaker than it should. I\u2019m trying to headbang while listening to this part right now, and it just isn\u2019t working.\n\nNow Freezing Moon also has something lacking, feel. Dead\u2019s vocals are much more fitting on Freezing Moon, you can see here that Dead\u2019s vocals very much did shape the way Attila performed the song on De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas (though Attila really did take a largely different direction on that record of course and I\u2019d like to state that his effort during the last verse of the song is particularly chilling, saving this song from obscurity. So where\u2019s the feel lacking? The solo is the answer to that question. In my opinion, that solo (or should I call it The Solo?) was perfected on De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas, where the high notes sounded utter black metal perfection. Here it\u2019s in a more embryonic state and Euronymous seems to have made it a bit more, dare I say it, accessible than the band\u2019s live efforts at the time of the recording. On an interesting side note, listen to the Ha Elm Zalag bootleg and you\u2019ll hear probably one of the earliest recordings of Freezing Moon and the solo is a very much raw and ripping affair (recorded in 1989 if I remember correctly).\n\nSo this is the record that could\u2019ve gained Mayhem so much more exposure on a musical basis, but it hasn\u2019t. People of course still fellate this due to its status as Dead\u2019s only studio work with Mayhem, but it\u2019s quite simply poor compared to the band\u2019s other efforts. Not to say it\u2019s bad by any means, but for a band that has produced far more brilliant records (even in the Dead-era, just listen to Dawn of the Black Hearts and Live in Zeitz for raw black metal perfection) this isn\u2019t up to scratch. I\u2019ll give the points for the effort, and for the fact that these really are two brilliant songs, but it just could\u2019ve been so much better.\n",
        "\nHere we are 22 years following this release. Black metal has defined itself as an established genre of the extreme metal movement. 22 years later this band is hailed as one of the biggest influences ever to come from that genre. 22 years ago this was one of the harshest rawest most brutal sounding demo tapes ever, but now we consider this recording to be very poorly done and looked at with indifference or with disgust because of its nature. This is mayhem in its purest form. This is what happens when some kids in high school (or fresh out of high school) get together and start playing the most extreme stuff they can.\n\nMusically, I have to admit, that the title is extremely accurate. This record truly is Pure Fucking Armageddon by its own definition. The entire recording both in terms of production and music talent is chaotic to the most extreme points. You can tell this recording was probably more of a band rehearsal of 3 kids who loved bands such as Venom, Hellhammer, and Celtic Frost during the mid 80s, and you can hear a lot of the influence in the moments you can decipher the guitars and bass in this low end recording. Euronymous' vocals get a lot of negative feedback, and I must agree that they're far from the greatest vocals I've ever heard. He's definitely not as great as messiah and maniac would eventually be, but his vocals definitely fit the atmosphere in the sound.\n\nThe first side \"Fuck\" is in short a demo that was less widely released and acknowledged by the band. The recording is raw and brutal before these terms became acknowledged by mainstream metal and became another ambiguous label to define the scene itself. Everything on the Fuck side is pretty well done and really what makes the recording worth listening to. The songs eventually would become songs that still define Mayhem to this day 4 albums, 2 EPs, and plenty of live/rehearsal/rereleased material uncovered over the years that we've come across in later years. Even in their infancy they were quite tight despite the poor low end rumbling production that makes it indecipherable during some points.\n\nThe second side \"Off\" is a rehearsal track. It's quite obvious right when you reach the Mayhem track, it's nothing more than your average high schoolers putting together a rehearsal afterschool. Some will praise this like everything else because it's mayhem, though years later something like this would be considered downright laughable, irritating, and probably be a primary reason the band would never be acknowledged, but then again it's debatable whether or not Mayhem would be as well known, notorious and popular today had it not been for Dead's Suicide, Euronymous' murder, Helvete, and the live shows the band put on in their prime days a few years following this recording. The rehearsals sound quality is a bit easier to decipher and without the overdriven vocals over head you can make out a lot more which sounds pretty well done and very listenable.\n\nThere are many flaws with this recording of course, but it's a demo. It's worth checking out though many won't appreciate it. IF you listen to plenty of old tapes before and after though you begin to appreciate it more. This release is definitely a good indication of the underground back during the mid 80s. Could it have been better in both recording and execution? Of course, but given what they had at the time as a band, it's still definitely a well put together demo. It clearly defines what it means to be raw, harsh, and every other term and in a way is a masterpiece in itself in that aspect and is defines and paves a path that would forge for extreme metal in the next few years to come. If only we can go back 22 years ago in order to once again appreciate this often underrated landmark demo recording for what it was instead of focusing on what it is in comparison to now decades later.\n",
        "\nAgain, this was another release with huge shoes to fill. Hellhammer more or less single-handedly had to bring back together a lineup for the band following the death of guitarist/primary song writer Euronymous, a new bassist, and a vocalist which the band had been lacking. Hellhammer found Maniac who was last seen on Deathcrush, Necrobutcher from 80s Mayhem fame, and a new guitarist by the name of Blasphemer.\n\nIn all honesty with a lineup like that it would seem as if this EP had the potential to be another Deathcrush, but alas I was mistaken. Instead you have very standard generic black metal both in terms of musicianship and delivery as a whole. When I first heard Maniac's vocals on Deathcrush way back I thought they were some of the sickest vocals in extreme metal, especially for the time. I was really anticipating a similar approach, but instead his vocals aren't that impressive to begin with. The Musicianship itself is also nothing amazing. It's obviously no de mysteriis. \n\nWhile many of the guitar parts were written by Euronymous previously, the band lacks direction and imagination with their sound, and this whole EP has a feeling of generic and uninspired right from the useless irrelevant intro which doesn't add much all the way to the final track. The songs basically follow a set standard of playing without even trying to expand the sound. On top of that the production of this recording is way too polished for black metal, not cold or harsh at all, it was only a sign of things to come, and a sign of wasted potential from this group of members who other than Euronymous seemed like a revival of Mayhem in its glory days of the late 80s like my expectations were, but I guess all good things will pass right.\n\nThat's not to completely disregard this release. It's your typical black metal album, and given the EP length rather than letting it drag on forever with the same generic sound (like another norwegian band out there) and as a whole the album itself is flawless black metal, which is more than many generic mayhem/darkthrone/burzum clones that come out of the woodwork on myspace these days can ever dream to sound like. So this isn't all too worthless, I just wouldn't listen to it with expectations of finding something as amazing as their previous works, but even then don't let that discourage you. It's worth at least one listen to check out this album, and won't disappoint any fans of the band who haven't listened to it yet!\n",
        "\nAlright, all flaws aside (I'll get to those in a second), let's take a look at what we have here. We have two studio tracks that were recorded with Dead. Dead. Who was it? It was Dead. The guy who most folks end up talking about when they have a long-winded talk about black metal. I don't care where you start from, if you spend long enough talking about black metal, you'll always end up at Dead. So, love him or hate him, you'd better respect (if you're a black metal fan, at least) what he's done for the community. His image and vocals have influenced many that have come after him.\n\nThat being said, this is a treasure in it's valuable rareness. Not rare in a physical sense (many people just download it, and the songs are available in a couple of other places) but rare in what it entails. It's the testament to what could have been, if he had just chilled out about being dead. Why couldn't he have waited another year or two? \n\nNow, onto the music itself. Freezing Moon... well, it starts off great, but something about the first little bit makes you uncomfortable, and you aren't sure what. Then it dawns on you... the fucking drums! Each time the cymbal is hit, you shudder a little bit, because you realize the Bass drum and, well, the entire drumset to be honest tends to overshadow the rest of the instruments. The guitars come through, although you have to strain to hear specific strokes, but the bass guitar is virtually inaudible. I can't remember if Varg was playing on this one, or if he came later, but nice job, whoever you are! Nice job not getting your instrument heard!\n\nCarnage, it's the same thing all over again. And since that song tends to be more drum-heavy to begin with, well... forget about hearing too much else. \n\nBut despite the mixing problems, the instruments sound so clean, so precise, and so well-meshed. There is none of the \"kvlt as fvck\" mentality in this studio that leads them to betray all thoughts of clean recording, these guys actually tried like hell to make an accessible recording. Despite the flaw in the drums it came out wonderfully. And the follow up was just as great, although without Dead, I wonder how much better it could've been.\n\nAnd speaking of Dead, our black-metal-martyr, what about his vocals? Well, my friends, if you loved Live in Leipzig, then you'll more than likely be astounded by what he can do when he's not forced to cut himself for attention on stage... the vocals are fantastic. No drop-outs. Nothing uneven. Alot of people can't stand his voice as heard on Leipzig, but if they heard this, they might think twice about writing him off as \"overrated.\" \n\nAll in all, it's a great single, and it's a great piece of black metal history. It also can be used as an arguing point. \"Dewd, liek, why do u liek Dead so much?... he wasn't verry good, and he wasn't even on a album!\" You can pull this out and say \"Listen and recant, bitch.\" Because, after all, who wouldn't like to rub this in a naysayers face?\n",
        "\nMayhem has returned to bring us another piece of black metal art, this time with Attila handling vocal duties. Attila had not been with Mayhem for almost 13 years so his return was much welcomed. On this album, his vocals combine the deep growls of Dead with Maniac's high pitched shrieks along with his signature all too familiar sound. The final product is a blend of screams, cries, guttural growls and demonic spoken words. Fans of Attila will be very pleased to hear this album but if you were expecting something similar to De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas, you may be disappointed.\n\nThe music to Order Ad Chao is definitely very different from anything they have ever created. The riffs can be compared to some of the work heard on Wolf's Lair Abyss. Blasphemer's songwriting style has changed a lot since Chimera. Fast tremolo picking with the typical eerie black metal chords make up the sound of most of the riffs but the atmosphere of this album is purely evil and cold more so than any of their previous releases. This album does not contain any of the crunchy break downs that were heard throughout Chimera. The riffs which are very complex and tend to change drastically are usually used only in one sequence and are rarely repeated more than once in the songs. Mayhem changed drastically since Chimera because they went from using the verse/chorus structure a lot to not at all in Ordo Ad Chao.\n\nThe unpredictable nature of this album makes listeners constantly wondering what is next to come. Fans of traditional black metal may find listening to Ordo Ad Chao unpleasant but to others it just proves how talented the musicians are. Rehearsing to record this album must have been a pain in the ass! The quality of the recording is weak even in comparison to earlier Mayhem recordings. I was disappointed by this because it ruins powerful sound of Hellhammer's drumming. The distortion is very high and drowns out a lot of the toms and the double bass. Even though the recording quality is not as good as it could have been, the album is sure to go down in history as one of the most innovative and unique black metal albums of all time.\n",
        "\n\u201cDeathcrush\u201d is an extreme listen, there is no debate there. The level of systemic chaos that is exhibited at times on here crosses the threshold between being lethal and being outright ridiculous. I can only begin to imagine how people reacted to it when it first started to be circulated, which I\u2019m sure was comparable to the reaction that people had to Black Sabbath\u2019s first album or Alice Cooper\u2019s first few live gigs playing to a bunch of flower worshiping hippies. But there seems to be a good deal more to this than the extremity of the sound/noise ratio.\n\nMayhem\u2019s somewhat auspicious admiration of Conrad Schnitzler is very telling of the peculiar relationship that the genre they helped pioneer has with electronic and minimalist music. Perhaps my own dislike of many of the black metal genre\u2019s offerings stems from my inability to enjoy about 90% of minimalist music, let alone its modern tape splicing brethren such as Karlheinz Stockhausen and Pierre Henry. Nonetheless, the riff approach to thrash metal has some similarities to the minimalist sound, although most of my preferred thrash acts don\u2019t dwell upon one riff for most of a song.\n\nThere is some really great music just itching to come out of several of these songs, particularly the intro material that precedes the mad mix of blast beats and tremolo picked chords. The intro to \u201cDeathcrush\u201d is a solid mid-paced thrash riff that could please NWOBHM and Slayer fans alike. \u201cNecrolust\u201d is wild enough to make S.O.D. wince, yet still maintains a fair amount of organization. And of course the famed \u201cPure Fucking Armageddon\u201d lives up to it\u2019s name, basically a crazy barrage of speed and incoherent screams preceded by a somewhat Iron Maiden meets Pink Floyd instrumental prelude in \u201c(Weird) Manheim\u201d. (I have the version where the two are combined)\n\nDespite all this, there are some really serious flaws that drag this into the mud really fast. Although the drum production could stand to be cleaned up a good deal, the overriding issue here is Maniac\u2019s horrible vocals. I haven\u2019t really been too fond of his voice with regards to the other stuff he\u2019s done with this band, but here it\u2019s just downright awful. I\u2019m at a complete loss as to how someone can deride Attila\u2019s vocals for their Gollum-like tinge, yet can also think that this phlegm gurgling, choking on broken glass, collection of shrieks is praiseworthy. Not to mention that the vocal track has so much damn reverb on it that it\u2019s hard to heard any separation between the consonants and the vowels in this shouted mess. I guess the silver lining is that half of the songs on here are so pointlessly profane lyrically, to the point of absurdity, that you\u2019re better off not understanding what is being said.\n\nI do give this band a good deal of credit for creating something original and starting something that has produced a fair share of solid albums, but this brief collection of sounds just doesn\u2019t listen well enough to deserve the lavish praise that many have given it. \u201cDe Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\u201d is a better representation of an extreme metal album, while I could best categorize this as a half underground punk, half thrash metal crossover release with a real lousy vocal delivery. If you like metal solely for the aggression factor rather than for its intrigue (I don\u2019t), then this is probably worth getting, otherwise stick to their material with Attila and Dead at the helm.\n\nLater submitted to (www.metal-observer.com) on August 24, 2008.\n",
        "\nI don't really grasp why this is so revered. There's a point where incompetency is endearing or even respectable; some level of roughness around the edges or even outright drunken stupidity can be great at times. Incompetence being good, however, necessitates sufficient spirit and fervor to replace the absence of musical talent. 'Live In Leipzig' lacks both these qualities, so it's not even a sloppy yet forceful and raw look at early Mayhem; it's just Mayhem having a really off day live. It sounds like everyone was performing with a cold and for very little pay. Okay, Hellhammer seems to be sort of trying, but aside from him, no one even wants to be there. It's raw, yes; it's also mediocre and essentially pointless, except for lineup concerns.\n\n'Live In Leipzig' is primarily worshiped due to being the only full-length recording featuring Dead, who, as this live LP will show you, is himself much more worshiped due to shotgun suicide than any particular skill in vocalization. He's not a quarter of the vocalist that Attila would be on the seminal 'De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas'; he's not even half of a decent, standard-issue black metal vocalist. He's sloppy and droning, both of which are accusations that could be leveled at Attila; however, Attila's theatrical style added to the atmosphere of Mayhem's later compositions. Dead does nothing but limply groan over the instruments. The real thing that kills his performance, though, is a lack of power. Imagine a basic black metal vocalist- say Magus Caligula of Dark Funeral- performing as usual, but never letting his volume or intensity rise above a moderate shout. Terrible idea, isn't it? Basic black metal vocals require some viscerality to them to be convincing. Dead lacks even this, so what you have is an already mediocre vocalist practically falling asleep during his performance. Nothing more needs to be said about him; the best thing that ever went through Dead's head was the buckshot.\n\nThe rest of the band fairs slightly less poorly, but it's still bad enough to kill the release. Every track is, as those reading this probably know, packed to the brim with instrumental errors; the most obvious is the mangling of Euronymous' solo in 'Freezing Moon', which is the auditory equivalent of swallowing a lemon whole. In fact, moments like this turn it into something approaching a comedy release; Euronymous' guitar coming unplugged on 'Freezing Moon', Hellhammer losing a drumstick on 'Pagan Fears', the weirdly uneven, undulating production throughout; it's pretty funny, in all honesty. Speaking of production, it's not as bad as you'd think it is (though it is still pretty bad); you can actually hear everything, including the bass if you pay close attention. But overall, it's very weak and does nothing to cloud the lackluster playing of everyone involved. Is this supposed to be grim and raw? I don't think constant errors in playing are very raw, myself, but perhaps others have different standards.\n\nTo the album's credit, the tracklisting is essentially a full catalog of Mayhem's brilliant tracks at the time; however, a decent set list just makes the subsequent musical abortion all the more hilarious and vaguely saddening. I wouldn't say that this is an entirely worthless release; it's of great historical importance as far as early black metal goes, and it's pretty amusing all around. But if someone actually tries to call this release essential and groundbreaking, please laugh and walk away. Think about it: this was originally a bootleg that was later made into an official release. This means that the members of Mayhem actually sat down, listened to Euronymous' guitar get unplugged, and said to themselves, \"Yeah, yeah, this is the good stuff.\" And if that's not funny, I don't know what is.\n",
        "\nI bought Ordo Ad Chao in the summer of 2007 in Australia, and I would listen to it on the ships when we left ports, so I had alot of time to thoroughly listen to it. \n\nAs the months have passed I have read a fair share of negative reviews written in offense towards Mayhem, as if to sound the trumpets of a terrible injustice to the \"fans\" who scream for thier 13 dollars back. I just had to write a review. So to the naysayers, I will be targeting your thoughts and I will be praising this album. Dont continue if you hated this album. \n\nLets start off with the production quality. This seems to be the biggest complaint coming from these so called \"fans\". I'm sorry, if the production quality on a FUCKING MAYHEM album is more of concern than the quality of the music, then you should probably take off that Deathcrush t-shirt and give it to a real follower of the band. \n\nYes, the production is a full 180-degree turn from the pristine crisp sound of past efforts like Chimera and Grand Declaration Of War. Its a safe bet to say it was done deliberately. Its very low-grade, very murky and cavernous. In all honestly I think it fits very well. This is not supposed to be a happy, headbanger metal album. Its Mayhem returning to the older sound, and quite frankly we should be grateful. Not ripping on ex-vocalist Maniac, but lets be honest....Chimera had a total of 3 incredible tracks and the rest was as bland as whatever Satyricon is doing nowadays...yeah I said it. \n\nVocals. Amazing. Simply moving. To a true Mayhem fan, Attila's return almost brings tears to your eyes. His performance is nothing short of astonishing. I wouldnt have expected anything less than black metal's champion shaman, and his range is all over the fucking place. His signatures are all present, with some fresh sounds as well such as *spoiler* his hideous sobbing and crying on \"Key To The Storms\" and the 'so-gutteral-most-gore bands-give-up' low roars on \"Anti\". The lyrics are as chaotic as the album's title entails, ranging from suicide, chaos, Annunaki, and even a kickass concept of the world devouring itself in an end-all humanity flood in \"Wall Of Water\". \n\nBlasphemer's guitar work, contrary to the bullshit being said by trend-whore \"fans\", is absolutely brilliant. Snaking, listener-unfriendly anti-melodies and subterranean riffs interact to create a brutal, ugly and simply disgusting atmosphere that I find only comparable to \"committing suicide and dying in a sewer line\". Some of Blasphemer's most brutal guitar work is showcased on this album, ranging from chaotic Aura Noir-esque spaz outs to slow, dirge/doom/drone sub-textures that churn like nausea in the pit of your stomach. Bass lines were a little different this time around, with Necrobutcher adding some 'flange' lines in the mix, that make the atmosphere more punctuated. I think the centerpiece of the album is the track \"Illuminate Eliminate\". It has everything in it. \n\nThe drums. Hellhammer pulls off some of his finest and fastest drumming in the band. Blast beats are insanely precise and this time around the double bass rolls have exceeded all efforts. I can only sum up his kit handywork in one word. Insane. Seriously, just listen. \n\nOrdo Ad Chao in my opinion is Mayhem's finest record ever. Every Mayhem fan has his/her own preference on what constitutes their \"best\" album, but for me this is Mayhem's most mature and challenging album ever. Not only a harrowing return to form, but a hate-filled statement to the underground that the godfathers of the scene are still the champions. This album is not an easy listen, and not intended to be ready to digest. It takes a clear head, an open mind, and a TRUE appreciation of the band and its art to understand this album. This is the challenge that Mayhem have thrown out to the fanbase to filter out the trend whores from the die-hards, a rallying nightmare that only the strong are allowed to participate in. This is what makes Mayhem stand out still after 20+ years of terrorizing the genre of black metal. \n\nAll Hail Mayhem!\n",
        "\nThis review is from a black metal purist's perspective. I love black metal in its entirety and I do not appreciate the sort of stuff that the meads have created, they call it experimental black metal while I don't find anything black about their songs except some average harsh vocals with commercialy sounding atmosphere. I don't understand how they managed to release a split album with these legendary Norwegian musicians.\n\nThere're only 2 Mayhem songs which are 1000 times better and blacker than Meads' songs. Freezing Moon is a classic and legendary Mayhem song while Carnage is an average Mayhem song but sounds really good. On the contrary Meads songs are childish, they've mostly taken inspirations from bollywood music and famous main theme from \"O Fortuna\" etc, here and have added some Arabic lyrics to the songs with some clean passages of mixture of different subjects like politics and religion, their lyrics are their strongest point. \n\nMeads songs are mostly dominated by keyboards, average riffs and uninspiring drumming, but, nevertheless, they have 2 songs in this album that do not sound horrible at all, these are Assassins of Allah and Jihad - The grisly din of killing steel. These 2 Meads songs are catchy and sound pretty much like metal. According to their lyrical content their should have been lots of energy and spirit in these songs but it just isn't here. In a few words I can describe their music like this, extreme pop music (the word extreme is there because of the harsh vocals.\n",
        "\nI am not a fan of black metal's ideology per say, which most would say is inseparable from its music, and I think much of the self-importance that the entire scene seems to have in comparison to those who came before it of late is downright annoying. I do think very highly of most of the artists who are credited with influencing the genre; namely Venom, Mercyful Fate, Hellhammer, Bathory, Slayer, Celtic Frost, and a small group of 80s/early 90s death metal bands that could be connected with/morphed into early members of the scene. As such, I can have an appreciation for many of the albums under the black metal banner; one could maybe call it crossover appeal.\n\n\u201cDe Mysteriis Dom. Santhanas\u201d is one of those albums to has crossover appeal, mostly owing to its very clean production and strong sense of organization. It still listens like a raw, untamed monster despite this because of the stylistic devices which have since become clich\u00e9; namely the continuous tremolo picked riffs, seemingly perpetual blast beats, and goblin-like vocals. However, its charm is that it doesn\u2019t rely solely on these the way most of their imitators due and instead has a fair share of additional elements; the most striking of which are the fair share of complexities in the song structures and some quasi-virtuoso guitar soloing in a few of the 8 blacked chapters of this rather morose book of sounds.\n\nMany complaints by fans of the band were directed at Attila for an alleged inferior vocal performance to his predecessor. Unfortunately \u201cLive in Leipzig\u201d is the only release before this that I haven\u2019t heard so I can\u2019t make a judgment on Dead\u2019s vocals, but I can say affirmatively that he is way better than Maniac. The Gollum-like ravings, the almost Dave Mustaine-like mutterings, and the woeful Lord Dracula inspired baritone at the end of the title track are what keeps this album from venturing into well-produced ambient noise and thrash riff intros/interludes. \n\nIt's not much of a stretch to state that every song on this album is good and listenable by any metal standard, save perhaps too much repetition and limited variation keeping some of this from being as exciting as one would expect from a Venom or Mercyful Fate album. \u201cFreezing Moon\u201d is an exception to this tendency and elects to have a couple of down-tempo riffs introduce the song before launching into a mid-80s Slayer-like barrage of speed. It does well to keep from holding onto one idea or one tempo for too long, and Attila\u2019s vocals are dirty as hell but surprisingly in tune with the music. Euronymous plays a solid solo; not the most impressive thing I\u2019ve heard, but a decent offering in the style of Kerry King.\n\n\u201cPagan Fears\u201d has a lot of progressive death metal tendencies at the start, showcasing a pretty solid start up riff, but ultimately Hellhammer steals the show here with some extremely impressive fills and a solid display of inhuman endurance. It isn\u2019t really any wonder why he has been a very highly demanded drummer associated with over a dozen metal acts. \u201cFrom the Dark Past\u201d and \u201cBy Time and Dust\u201d both have excellent opening riffs, but the drumming tends to carry most of the weight afterwards. There is a general flaw in this approach to metal drumming, which is even more abused on the releases of all the 2nd and 3rd tier black metal bands I\u2019ve encountered. What you eventually get is the concept of up becoming down that was hinted at in Dante\u2019s Inferno. After encountering the Dragon and the 9th plain of Cocytus, Virgil and Dante reach heaven by continuing to descend until down becomes up. Likewise, the continuous repetition of the fasted humanly possible beats become so distorted that they blur into a slow, trance-inducing pulse that essentially works against the innate tendency of exposition, climax and denouement; which is what makes a truly great song. \n\nThis album is essentially the zenith of the original black metal movement stylistically, regardless to whether or not it conforms to or contradicts the earlier standards set by this band and the ideals of the movement, (it technically does both in various respects). Fans of mid-80s Slayer, Venom, Mercyful Fate and Hellhammer will find a lot to like on here, although the overused blast-beats and slight over-repetition isn't for everyone. I\u2019ve found it best to treat this as an experimental technical death/thrash hybrid, and I do consider it to be a cut above a good number of releases in the death/thrash style.\n\nLater submitted to (www.metal-observer.com) on August 24, 2008.\n",
        "\nSo this is the reunited Mayhem? Well, the line up is particularly different. Maniac coming back in the fold, along with Necrobutcher. New guitarist Blasphemer, who seems talked down upon because he isn't Euronymous. It is true he has big shoes to fill, and actually does quite good on this album, but he'd disgrace his performance here with the next musical abortion by this band. If they would have kept in this direction instead of opening a big jar of what the fuck on the next album it would have been great. The style is somewhat reminiscent of DMDS (which is no surprise since most of the riffs were Euronymous's anyway, but the delivery is a hell of a lot different. This is more sterile, and lacks an evil vibe, rather it is replaced with a more militaristic delivery. Mentioning that, Dead's lyrics are absent from here and Mayhem's lyrics are no longer \"dark and mysterious\", and have more to do with WWII than anything. \n\nAs said before this is much more sterile. Hellhammer's drums to be honest are overproduced, triggered, and well....kind of shitty. His performance is quite good, but the sound is too triggered for my tastes. Necrobutcher is nowhere as prominent in the mix as he once was, but you can still hear him. Maniac...wow, what a change. It takes some major adjusting to listen to him. A little different from the Deathcrush days. Sterile as it is, it almost works in the band's favor.\n\nThe intro is pointless and worthless annoying static that fails to create atmosphere and drones on way too long. As for songwriting ideas, that's the only bad thing I have to say. The rest is quite nice. Most of the Euronymous riffs, so you can expect greatness. The opening riff for \"I Am Thy Labyrinth\" is the same as the opening riff for Emperor's \"Ye Entrancemperium\". This was also written by Euronymous, respectively. The rest of the EP is pretty much just standard black metal. Maniac will often use somewhat clean vocals, and surprisingly they're not too bad. The rest is pretty much DMDS riffs with a different delivery. So there's not much since going on about it.\n\nThe highlight for me personally is \"A Symbol of Bloodswords\". Too bad this is the only thing they've done that was passable since they got back together. Sadly, they could only ride the riffs of a dead man for one EP, then decided to turn to complete dogshit. Oh well, Enjoy this one, it's not bad.\n",
        "\nThis EP was recorded in 1987, in a period in which the most important extreme metal bands were the early death metal ones: Sepultura, Death, Possessed and so on, so it was inevitable that these tracks here were still very influenced by that genre. \n\nEven not being the best tracks ever released by Mayhem, they are quite interesting from the point of view of the historical importance. The violence here was something new in this genre, and also the raw, low-budget production was an example for the future black metal scene. The tracks are full of Slayerish riffs, mixed with early death metal influences and a black touch. \n\n\u201cSilverter Anfang\u201d song is a quite funny intro made of strange drums sound that ends in the famous main riff of the title track. The up tempo parts are very influenced by the thrash metal, the guitar riffs are not so exceptional but with a great early Sodom feeling. \u201cChainsaw Gutsfuck\u201d is another raw classic, with a bone crushing bass inspired by early Napalm Death and Repulsion. The vocals are very raw, almost punkish, but they show the way to the future, evolving black metal screams. \n\nIn the great Venom cover \u201cWitching Hour\u201d, Mayhem show their respect and admiration for a band that would have been one of the major influences in this extreme genre. Here the vocals are less screamed, more in Venom style. Better to me, because sometimes those screams are annoying and boring in my opinion.\n\n\u201cNecrolust\u201d is pure thrash/death assault in the riffage and in the drums up-tempo. Sometimes I found a lot of influences from early Death or Possessed. The last song \u201c(Weird) Manheim/ Pure Fucking Armageddon\u201d is the most violent track here. The beginning is made of a strange piano sound and ends in a good mid paced riff that stenches of Hellhammer/early Celtic Frost, continuing with some primitive blast beats, drum rolls and up tempo. \n\nThis EP is an important piece of extreme metal; it shows one of the very first primitive mix of early death, thrash metal and a proto-black metal still under an embryonic form. An important lesson of history and an inspiration for lots and lots of other bands. \n\nMy mark is more focused on the importance of this album than in his pure musical aspect. Innovative but not excellent\u2026still very raw, and that\u2019s normal for a young band.\n",
        "\nI\u2019m not a big Mayhem fun. I always thought this band was far more famous for the facts that happened in the past (Euronymous murder and churches burnings) than for their music. The only album I love is \u201cDe Mysteriis DOM Sathanas\u201d and this EP is far less good.\n\nLet\u2019s start from the incredible boring intro made of some cybernetic noises and so on\u2026blah! Too boring and not even so obscure and evil\u2026The first song is in my opinion the worst one here. Terrible.\n\nThe first thing you can hear is the crappy, noisy, screamed to excess Maniac\u2019s voice. That makes no sense! You cannot understand anything!! I consider Attila the only good singer Mayhem had, and here I miss him a lot. Maniac\u2019s voice is like a cry of a baby mixed with a mad who\u2019s screaming something I don\u2019t understand.\n\nThe drums are incredible artificial and martial their his sound. It\u2019s not like in \u201cDe Mysteriis..\u201d where there was the perfect black metal drums sound. Sometimes the drums parts are so boring with a production that exalt them, despite the only quite good thing here: the guitar sound.\n\nHere the guitars are not so inspired like in the previous album (No Euronymous, No party!). There are only few riffs spread in the songs that are quite good (When they are not hidden behind those awesome screams from my ass and the pounding drums\u2026!)\n\nIn my opinion the good period for Mayhem lasted only for few years (the ones used in the production of \u201cDe Mysteriis\u2026\u201d) and yet from here those good years are over.\n",
        "\nYes, the production (or lack of) is horrific. Yes, the playing probably isn\u2019t all that great. Yes, Euronymous was an absolutely horrible vocalist. Does any of this matter? To some, yes it will matter, but the trick to this demo is to look past the production (and Euro\u2019s vocals), and at the music itself. Which, for it\u2019s tim,e is amazingly aggressive and showcases some of the best Mayhem riffs in their history. Not only that, but two out of the three full songs on here (excluding the intro and Mayhem) still appear in Mayhem\u2019s live set. What Euronymous, Necrobutcher and Messiah made here is an absolute classic, and one of the first releases from the just starting Norwegian black metal scene. It actually contains two separate recordings, the Voice of a Tortured Skull demo (tracks 1-5) and a rehearsal afterwards (tracks 6-9). It\u2019s kind of ironic that the rehearsal sounds clearer (and better) than the actual proper recordings.\n\nThe sound: Well, this is one of the worst part of the demo. Considering I can get clearer sound out of the microphone on my mp3 player, it\u2019s pretty damn bad. It\u2019s very muffled and very bass heavy. Depending on your point of view, you\u2019ll either discard the entire demo for this or you\u2019ll accept it as it is and get on listening. Once you\u2019ve gotten used to it, it really isn\u2019t that bad, I just wouldn\u2019t compare it to Grand Declaration of War anytime soon. To help, listen to the final four tracks off of Dawn of the Black Hearts. Then you\u2019ll think the recording quality on this is fantastic.\n\nThe Vocals: Now these are just horrible. Luckily they are only on the first five tracks. It\u2019s Euronymous on vocals, and let me just say, I\u2019m glad Maniac and Messiah did Deathcrush, because Euronymous can\u2019t sing for shit. They are mainly deep grunts akin to something found in brutal death metal rather than black metal and they are made even worse by the fact that they are extremely muffled. In the end, they just sound like a big hunk of bass. The lyrics are horrible as well, don\u2019t expect anything in that department.\n\nGuitar: Now this is really were this Pure Fucking Armageddon shines! The riffs on this album are fantastic. Besides that repetitive but undeniably awesome riff that forms the main part of Ghoul, we have the legendary Pure Fucking Armageddon riff as well as Mayhem\u2019s earliest solos in Carnage. Sometimes the guitar get buried beneath everything else, which is a shame, but they are still audible barring a few select parts.\n\nBass: Another shining part of Pure Fucking Armageddon is Necrobuther\u2019s bass. It has a really heavy and deep tone to it and carries the whole demo on its back. If the bass was not present, there may have been some more room for the guitars, but then the demo would have been lacking some serious grunt, particularly on Ghoul. At times it acts more like a rhythm guitar, playing the riffs while Euronymous solos during Carnage. At other times it just beefs up the sound of the guitar.\n\nDrums: There really isn\u2019t much to say about the Messiah\u2019s drumming on this album. They are very basic, and no where up to the standards that Hellhammer would later set, but they still fit Pure Fucking Armageddon perfectly. They\u2019re simple and rough, but that\u2019s the way they were meant to be! Actually the drums are at a very good level in the mix and don\u2019t drown out anything as they did on Deathcrush.\n\nSide Fuck: The demo starts off with a short intro by the name of Voice of a Tortured Skull. This intro is probably one of my favourite intros of all time. It has a very evil atmosphere and at times invokes thoughts and images of torture. Following Voice of a Tortured Skull is the classic Carnage. While in its earliest form here, the song has remained virtually unchanged to this day. It features the first Mayhem solos, as well as some solid riffs and bass work. After Carnage comes Ghoul, one of my favourite Mayhem songs of all time. It\u2019s so simple, yet it sounds absolutely brilliant. The riffs are awesome and it\u2019s really a shame that the song is basically forgotten, being left out of the live set. If you have more craving for this song, as I did, I would recommend finding Carpathian Forest\u2019s cover. Euronymous never stopped telling everyone who would listen how great Venom was, and here Venom\u2019s Black Metal song is covered as a \u201cTotal Death version\u201d. Basically its just a really fast version. It has no vocals (yay!), but sometimes it\u2019s so fast the song becomes a big sludge, and you cannot tell when the next part of the song starts. Then the title track, Pure Fucking Armageddon. This song, along with Freezing Moon has come to define Euronymous era Mayhem. After the brief whirlwind of chaos, the listener is treated to \u201cThe Riff\u201d. It\u2019s the greatest riff of Mayhem\u2019s career and one of the best riffs in metal history. Here Pure Fucking Armageddon is played at the right speed. On Deathcrush it was played too fast, and lost some of it\u2019\\s greatness. This was of course corrected on Live In Leipzig, restoring the song to it\u2019s former power.\n\nSide Off: Now we move on to the rehearsal side of Pure Fucking Armageddon. First up is a brief track called Mayhem, featuring the band mucking around a bit with some random drum bashing. It moves on to increasingly fast drumming with some screaming accompanying it. The final three songs are just different versions of Ghoul, Pure Fucking Armageddon and Carnage (in that order). The sound is a bit clearer, letting the guitar really raise its head and show the power of Euro\u2019s riffs and Necro\u2019s bass lines. Oh, and there\u2019s no vocals, which is a huge bonus.\n\nPure Fucking Armageddon may not the best sounding demo in the world, but it\u2019s one of the greatest and most influential. This demo was the start of Norwegian black metal, even if it\u2019s closer to thrash and early death metal. Underneath the crap sound lies some awesome songs and some even better riffs. Get past that sound and I\u2019ll guarantee you\u2019ll love this demo. This is metal in it\u2019s rawest form and it\u2019s a shame that modern bands cannot create songs of this calibre anymore. Don\u2019t pay for this though (unless it\u2019s the limited vinyl version, they\u2019re worth a bit of money), download it as you may not be able to handle the sound. Unfortunately Mayhem no longer offers it as a free download off of their website, so you\u2019ll have to dig around for it. This is black metal history, and if you\u2019re going to get any of the old demos from the big Norwegian black metal bands of the early 90\u2019s, get this one.\n",
        "\nIn the aftermath of their most avant-garde release, Mayhem decided to return to their black metal roots with \"Chimera\". For a large part of the fanbase, this was the right and obvious choice after the strange experimentation of \"Grand Declaration of War\". However, this album manages to have its own fair share of otherness, leaving mixed feelings after its listening. This one is a quite brutal, intense and technical black metal album, and this is not the \"brutality\" of norsecore we're talking about.\n\nFirst of all, the performance the band gives here is nothing short of amazing and rivals that of many death metal bands. Blasphemer's guitar skills really shine here, delivering complex and at the same time dark riffs at great speed. The bass is actually audible and manages to get the attention of the listener in songs like \"Dark Night of the Soul\" and \"Impious Devious Leper Lord\". Maniac is well, Maniac. His voice has worn out, but this actually seems to benefit the band, as his strangled-anally-raped-cat vocals are less prominent here, having been replaced by a standard rasp. Hellhammer is as always jackhammering his kit with non-stop blast beats, which get the job done but after a while become boring. Continuing with the tradition of his other albums after the band's reunion, his drums are awfully triggered (no trash-can St. Anger snare, but nonetheless very annoying drum sound).\n\nWhich brings us to the production values of \"Chimera\". Excellent performance needs excellent capturing too, and the band has done a very good job. The production here is one of the most clear in black metal and delivers us each instrument's sound perfectly. This, however, is what actually mortally wounds \"Chimera\". It fails to give the listener the passion and the atmosphere this album was meant to have. Gone is the rawness of \"Deathcrush\", the darkness of \"De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\", the claustrophobia of \"Wolf's Lair Abyss\". Overproduced albums don't go hand to hand with one of the defining elements of black metal: atmosphere. This was one of the previous album's faults too, but Mayhem seem to have learned their lesson with \"Ordo Ad Chao\".\n\nThe songwriting here, just like the performance, is top-notch for black metal. Although Blasphemer decided to follow a circular approach in his songs, they have some quite complex parts that give the album a progressive touch that nicely manages to save it from drowning in monotony (see Darkthrone). At first glance, this is not easily perceivable, but the band (or should I say, Blasphemer alone) has done a great effort in layering many sounds one upon another. Lyrics seem to have been written by Maniac, and they are his usual misanthropic ones, but this time they seem to have matured and moved away from the \"destroy Christianity\" point of view to deeper and darker thoughts.\n\nMoving to this album's failures and having already mentioned the lack of atmosphere, there is one thing that needs to be mentioned and that is a sort of \"pretentiousness\" that characterises this album. While the overproduced sound is contributing here, the fact is that the \"new\" Mayhem have tried to copy the \"old\" Mayhem to finally produce the longed \"DMDS, Part II\". The most blatant example is the song \"My Death\". While there is nothing wrong with this song and it's actually one of the best in this album, it is obvious that it's a failed copy of \"Freezing Moon\" a la \"new\" Mayhem. This pretentiousness flows through the album and ultimately destroys what could have been a very strong return for Mayhem.\n\nTo make a long story short, Mayhem did the right thing the wrong way. If you're looking for a \"kvlt\" Mayhem album, get \"DMDS\". If you want a \"new\" Mayhem album, grab \"Ordo ad Chao\". This doesn't make \"Chimera\" any less enjoyable, but it fails to come up to the standards of what the band wanted this time.\n",
        "\nNecrobutcher: Hey guys, I think there's a reason why we isolated some of our black metal fans from our last few albums!\nBlasphemer: Omgz! How?\nNecrobutcher: We used death metal production! Black metal fans don't like it!!1!\nBlasphemer: Onoez!\nNecrobutcher: So if we like totally make the production all raw stylez, they'll think we're kvlt again! lolz!\n\nNo really, they must have had this conversation. That would be the only justification for the inane production on this album. Sure, if this was a band starting out - they couldn't actually afford production, I'd be forgiving - but c'mon, this is Mayhem. They make thousands off each album. They're not exactly struggling musicians anymore.\n\nTo be more precise of the production: this is the sort of \"raw\" production that makes metalheads who listen to Dimmu Borgir believe this is what \"raw\" black metal is. If anyone describes this production as raw in a positive and honest context - please, go shoot yourself. This is not raw. This is the raw you get when you have a thousand dollar budget, and you twiddle some shiny knobs in your studio to make it sound atmospheric. I'm afraid that does not constitute as raw.\n\nFirstly, the song structures are boring. This is the song writing level that you would expect from a new band - or even a band made of young teenagers who want to write some fun, cheesy black metal. The riffs are uninspiring, repetitive (and not in the good drone way, either) - and the drumming is completely unimaginative. Which brings me to another point - what is with the drum production? Does having poor drum production turn you into a black metal genius? No, it doesn't. There are scattered moments throughout the album where it's just random, slow guitar and Attila doing \"weird\" vocal lines over the top. Look, if you think that's unique, scary, \"evil\" or atmospheric - you too can shoot yourself.\n\nVocally, it's typical Attila. I guess I can give him credit for the simple fact that he has a distinctive voice, which is commendable - but he sounds bored. They all sound bored. This is boring to listen to. The aggressive, thrashy passages that are meant to get you excited are weak. While writing this review I went through three songs, but I thought it was the same song. There is nothing memorable about anything on this CD. At all.\n\nI can not understand why so many people have given this such a high rating. If this was the first album by an unknown band, I can guarantee you it wouldn't receive such praise. But I guess since it's the \"true\" Mayhem going \"back to their roots\" that makes it fantastic or something. \n\nIf you like deliberately under produced, contrived black metal written by people who used to be influential in some way (which could be argued, Master's Hammer obliterates this band) then you'll probably lap up this album and gloat over the fact you own some \"raw\" black metal. If, on the other hand, you don't care for such folly - I suggest something more groundbreaking, original and interesting.\n\nI gave it 5 points for Attila, but his overuse of echo-ridden, \"creepy\" sounding vocals is just annoying. It's not unique, arty, scary or whatever else.\n",
        "\nFirst off let me say that for the circumstances, this is a wonderful album. Considering the fact that Mayhem didn't have the best sound equipment, the acoustics weren't so hot, and they had no intention of making this an official live album, Mayhem holds it together pretty well.\n\nThere are a few down sides, however. The guitar has so much reverb on it that you can barely hear the changing of chords, and when you can hear them, Euronymous misses some on a couple of the songs. The bass is so overdriven that at times it sounds like another 6-string guitar than a proper bass, and it is barely audible over the reverb. \n\nThe drums and vocals are spectacular, though. Even though Hellhammer loses his drumstick a few times and the drum beats aren't as loud as they should be, the drum parts on this album are some of the best Iv'e heard. There really aren't any words to describe the vocals. It seems like Dead had the ability to have demons possess him while performing. Tracks like \"Freezing Moon\" and \"Pure Fucking Armageddon\" show this very well.\nIv'e heard Dead perform much better vocals that on this album, though.\nHe was awesome during his days with Morbid and on the original studio cut of \"Freezing Moon\" on the CBR Compilation.\n\nOverall, because it is the only official Mayhem release with the classic lineup,\nany Mayhem fan should own it. But if outrageous guitar gain bothers you and your not big on Mayhem, it's not a must have.\n",
        "\nThey are back! With Ordo Ad Chao, Mayhem is telling the metal scene that they are back and ready to take their place as black metal elite. What we have with this album is 8 tracks of pure sonic darkness. I mean, this record is truly grim and fucking dark. No one with any sense expected Mayhem to come with such a ruthless assault.\n\nThe first thing that strikes you with this album is the production. It's easily the rawest Mayhem has been since the Deathcrush EP. But this is a different kind of raw. The low end is boosted pretty strongly, making the guitars take this truly filthy, heavy tone. It's easily some of the heaviest sounding riffs i've heard in black metal. The drums are something else, with the ride bell being louder than everything else, and the toms completely dark and grand. Attila sounds like a beast in this, with some of the strangest vocals in years.\n\nExperimentation's been a big part of Mayhem's repertoire the last 10 or so years of their career, and OAC is no different. They manage to combine an even more sinister version of Chimera with the epic feel of AGDOW. Songs like Illuminate Eliminate and Psychic Horns are some impressive, epic pieces of work, with winding riffs and dark, moody passages that hits you from all sides. Blasphemer is a master, dominating that evil guitar tone and contorting it to his will. Necrobutcher's bass is that much more important here, adding to that heaviness of the guitars. Mayhem hasn't sounded this tight since De Mysteriis for sure.\n\nAdding to that, there are serious headbanging moments during Wall of Water, and especially the last minute or so of Deconsecrate. Some of the most chaotic passages ever, Mayhem manage to bring up a black storm of riffing and still make it powerful and moving. Sadly, the album suffers its only drawback: it's too short. It seems like it ends way too quickly, and it seriously leaves you wanting more. This is one of those albums everyone will remember as Mayhem's true declaration of war.\n",
        "\nOrdo Ad Chao is Mayhem's 4th studio album, which for 24 years of existence isn't very impressive, but remember they've been very busy with EPs/labels/live albums/dying. Of those 4, only one is universally respected, 1994's seminal black metal album De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas. After that was A Grand Declaration Of War, an incredibly experimental album with vocalist Maniac. I personally thought it was a great record, truly original in a genre which was becoming stale, however it was very badly recieved, and Mayhem lost a very large portion of their fanbase. Since then more bands have been emerging and changing round black metal even more, and I think Mayhem perhaps responded to that with 2004's Chimera, which was certainly more raw and to the point, but still Maniac was on the mic, and honestly he wasn't very good.\n\nYou'll be glad to hear, then, that for Ordo Ad Chao, Atilla Csihar, vocalist on De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas has returned after some time touring with Sunn O))). Other than that, the lineup is the same as on Chimera, Blasphemer, Hellhammer and Necrobutcher. Some thought this album was going to continue on the slope that Mayhem were supposedly on starting in 2000, but after the announcement that Atilla had returned, hopes were getting high, and were sustained when they uploaded a song from the new album to their myspace.\n\nNow, to the actual album itself.\n\nIt's fucking evil.\n\nAfter a 3 minute track of what is essentially intro sounds, military snares and evil mumblings, the first song kicks off. From here you will have a lo-fi attack on your ears. The album has only 8 tracks, but also includes Mayhem's longest song, Illuminate Eliminate, clocking in at 9 minutes and 40 seconds.\n\nObviously the first thing people will notice about the album is the production, it's incredibly lo-fi, it's very raw but you can tell it was honed to precision, as you can hear every instrument well, there is no white noise and all the interludes have a lingering eerieness which, given crystal clear production would sound pretentious and rubbish (something which I feel plagued A Grand Declaration Of War).\n\nThere are many times where you doubt that this is really a black metal album. There are incredibly slow paced doomy riffs (enhanced no end by the unbelievably sludgy guitar tone), and moments where (no pun intended) mayhem breaks loose. Somehow, it is all pulled together by Atilla's vocals. You will hear him use his voice in so many different ways it's hard to count. There are very low rasps, very high screeches, a few gutturals, spoken word, melancholy cleans, sinister whispers, hell, Illuminate Eliminate even has something resembling a pig squeal. you name it, he's got it. He doesn't do this in the same way as, say, Dani Filth does (and admit it, he's got some decent range), every style he uses compliments the atmosphere and mood perfectly. If you read the lyrics while listening, yet more evilness jumps out at you, There's the standard fare anti-Christian lyrics (which are actually pulled off very tastefully), songs which hint at mythology and battle, and also some songs which sound like they are about spirituality and soul-searching.\n\nInstrumentally, this album is a mixture between all of their releases. As much as some of you would hate to admit, there are moments that could have come straight out of A Grand Declaration Of War, with the minimalism (Sunn O))) clearly rubbed off on Atilla) of some parts, and the pure demonic fury of others reminding me of Deathcrush and (to an extent) Wolf's Lair Abyss. I think some of this can be linked to Hellhammer's ever consistent drumming, he was always a great blastbeater, and his minimalistic drumming between actual song segments add just as much spookiness as the guitar.\n\nIn black metal, bass is never considered that important but Necrobutcher has held up his position well. With the very low-end production, the bass is clearly audible, but rarely noticeable as you are often paying more attention to Atilla or Blasphemer, but, despite his basslines rarely stepping away from root notes, his rhythm is perfect, if you can listen intently enough.\n\nBlasphemer has done an excellent job over Necrobutcher, tritonous little overdubs add more flavour to what is otherwise standard fare tremelo picked riffs that Mayhem have always used. Of course, they pull that off well too, but some of the lengthy tracks on Ordo Ad Chao couldn't be held together unless you were given more ominous melodies to keep you anticipating the next explosion.\n\nThere are moments, unfortunately where that next explosion doesn't come, and it can make you zone out a little, and you don't pay attention to all the work the guys have done to make this sound, in the words of Hellhammer, \"necro as fuck\", but some of these songs are fucking brilliant, either as classic Mayhem tracks or epic experiments, with some blastbeats thrown in for good measure. Best songs are Great Work Of Ages, Anti and Deconsecrate.\n",
        "\nI'll start this by saying that Wolf's Lair Abyss was the last album I really liked a lot from Mayhem. I thought GDoW was too technical for its own good (though it contained some good songs IMO) and that Chimera was too boring. This new one though, well, holy hell. \n\nFinally, after 3 years the new opus from legendary black metallers Mayhem has arrived. A lot has changed since Chimera, the last full length. Maniac is gone, Attila is back and the band seems to have found new life (death?) A lot of people were very excited by the return of Attila, myself included, and were anxiously awaiting the new album. When it comes to this band you know that a lot of time will be taken to create an album that is not only worth listening to, but that will be equally disharmonic and abrasive in nature. I heard Anti when it was first made public and was actually blown away by its sonic fury. The bass drums were honestly the fastest I have ever heard anyone play. The production was also something which stood out. It was necro and very, hmmm, muddy perhaps is the right word. Now I usually don't like a muddy sound but this was just completely awful (in a good way) and really commanded my attention. I bought this album just a few days ago finally and after listening to it maybe 5 times in total (which is not enough to fully grasp this record I will admit) I feel I can write a decent review. \n\nAs I said before the production is necro and even though this word is used way too much, grim. It's a nice change of style though from the usual crystal clear crap we hear nowadays. The instruments, especially the drums are very in the background it seems, compared to the vocals. The drum sound reminds me slightly of NeChrist, in that they sound almost hollow. Guitars are distorted to the utmost level yet the sound is really awesome. The bass is there and can be heard most of the time. I'm honestly having trouble writing this because I just don't know what to say about this album. I don't feel I should write a normal review, because this album is just not normal. Very hard to describe what I'm thinking in my head when I listen to it. I think that's the ultimate beauty in this album. It's so different from what is out there now. \n\nI'll move onto the vocals, probably the best part of the album. I loved Attila's performance on De Mysteriis and he has always been my favorite Mayhem vocalist, so it is no surprise that his work here is of the highest caliber of excellence. He uses his usual croaks and deep talking/chanting, but he also utilizes shrieks and screams occasionally as well, like on the Aborym material. He really has an incredibly wide range of styles. There is a scream which opens Deconsecrate (I think it's this one) which is so demonic and so cavernous that your blood will curl. Truly a masterful performance from one of the best in the entire genre of black metal.\n\nThe songs generally are slow, with some fast parts scattered around here and there, but the overall mood is very... doomy I'll say, with a sense of evil in the air. I get the feeling of being in a void when listening to this, like I'm in absolute nothingness. I'm sure they were going for something like this though when recording, but damnit if they didn't succeed. I think this album is going to literally take years before it can be understood and appreciated to the fullest extent. It's so complex and so mysterious that every listen will bring out something new which you didn't hear the last time. I'm not sure these songs will be adequate for the live setting, if only for the fact that none of them jump out and scream \"hit.\" They are not catchy and listening to individual songs will do no good. You must listen to this in its entirety. Anti may be the only really catchy song on here. \n\nThere is a CD-ROM track on the metal slipcase version I bought, but apparently all it reveals to be is the entire album on one 40 minute or so track. Also revealed is a picture gallery, which is empty. Not sure what that was all about, maybe going for more mystery. Anyway, I'm sorry I couldn't write a better review, but my thoughts for this album are very hard to put down into words. Let's say this. It's creepy. Cudos to Mayhem for really setting a bar for which others probably will never reach. Truly I feel this album is ahead of its time and will take years to catch up to. \n\n95/100\n",
        "\nAfter the release of Grand Declaration of War, Mayhem's fans were divided into several camps: the old-schoolers who already despised the thought of a \"new\" Mayhem and continually bashed anything the band had done since reuniting; the ones who absolutely loved the album, and were curious as to how things would progress; and the ones who were left scratching their heads. We will never see another GDoW, and Mayhem vowed that their following album would not only be a return to their WLA style, but some new things would be brought into the mix that would make Chimera an even more intense and bleak listen. So, did it work?\n\nYou betcha. Though it definitely doesn't recapture the hazy, nauseating atmosphere of WLA, nor does it hearken back to the ritualistic pummelings of DMDS, Chimera certainly is one hell of an album. It's clear to see from the opening track that it IS a black metal album, with a few unexpected twists and turns. Mayhem continually push the degree of speed and technicality that they can acheive as a band without coming off as pretentious, and a great deal of unworldly, pitch-black atmosphere is maintained. Strange-sounding guitar arpeggios and runs constantly pop up when unexpected, but it is actually a good thing in the way of songwriting brilliance and atmosphere. This is especially prevalant in \"My Death,\" a mid-paced, eerie journey through swooping riffs that flow in and out of the mix in disharmony and dissonance, accented by Hellhammer's rolling double bass and Maniac's layered whispers. A point comes in the song where everything morphs into a machine gun-like battery, followed by only a lone guitar line of evil-sounding chords and festering leads. Maniac ends the song in his signature clean chants, which is nothing short of paralyzing and fearful. Through the course of the song, Blasphemer continually weaves in guitar runs to add a jarring feel to the ritualistic feel of the song, and Hellhammer's drum work ebbs and flows through phases of merciless pounding and basic backbeats.\n\nThough none of the other songs are as forgiving as \"My Death,\" this is Chimera's best aspect. \"You Must Fall\" is a mind-raping descent into madness with barrages of lightning-speed blast beats, fierce vocals, and flurrying guitars, and many of the other songs follow suit. Some songs will astound with the sheer amount of insane speed while maintaining technicality in both the guitar and drum departments, but some room is left for the ominus nature of things, such as the zombie-like beginning riff of \"Dark Night of the Soul,\" or the manic ending of \"Slaughter of Dreams.\" As a unit, the band have stepped up their songwriting tremendously; the experimental nature has been almost totally ditched in favor of something that goes straight for the jugular. Some progressive touches still remain, as mentioned, but are never put in front of the nature of the music, which has taken a turn for the blackest road possible. The atmosphere given off certainly is darker than what the band have offered in the past, which is a huge plus.\n\nBlasphemer does some of his most genius composing here. All of the structures are meticulously put together, and great attention is given to sonic detail and atmosphere. He deftly switches gears from mechanical, atonal tremolo riffs to flurrying power chords and various technical/experimental touches all with the utmost of skill and ease. There are startling time changes placed in the structures where least expected, and all the while, touch is not lost with the amorphous, eerie, broken chords that gave him his signature style, such as the title track. This may very well be his most impressive recording, as well as Necrobutcher's; not only can he be heard, but his filthy-sounding bass brings a bit of old-school flair to a totally contemporary sound.\n\nThe other members also bare their teeth: Hellhammer truly lives up to his name, frantically switching gears from technical fills to teeth-rattling blast beats and double bass. He doesn't really have a boring moment here, as more attention is paid to dynamics and flow than anything else. The blast beats that start \"Rape Humanity With Pride\" will floor you, and his stop-on-a-dime finesse goes unrivalled. Maniac also stepped his game up, offering up some slightly more ear-friendly, but more ferocious vocals. You won't find the throat-shredding shrieks like on WLA, but he sounds cleaner, fuller, and more concentrated than on previous releases. As mentioned, there are some chanted vocals and spoken word parts, but not to the extent of GDoW; these moments help to take the band into even darker territory, and only thicken the atmosphere. Lyrically, things have a bit more old-school, revolving around themes of death, misanthropy, and darkness. It's never done in a juvenile way, nor is it done in a pseudo-philosophical way.\n\nChimera's production is suitably clean, and the album probably would have failed had it been otherwise. With the intricacy in the arrangements, it would have been hard to find a suitable \"black metal\" production. However, it's not as polished as GDoW, even with the triggered drums and scorching guitar layering.\n\nLike it or not, this is the new Mayhem; a true exploration of darkness in all its manners.\n\nHighlights: \"Rape Humanity With Pride,\" \"My Death,\" \"You Must Fall.\"\n",
        "\nThis review is wriiten by a person who:\n\n- thinks that \"Deathcrush\" is catchy, but ultimately forgettable.\n- considers \"De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\" a mediocre album.\n- very much enjoys \"Wolf's Lair Abyss\".\n- thinks that \"Great Declaration of War\" is a good, listenable album, nothing close to the atrocity it was proclaimed as.\n- was quite pleased with \"Chimera\".\n- enjoys Maniac's vocals.\n- doesn't like Attila's performance on \"De Mysteriis...\".\n- doesn't mind Hellhammer's triggered blasting.\n- prefers Maniac and Blasphemer over Dead and Euronymous.\n\nThis said, the new Mayhem album is in a league of its own. Maniac is gone, Atilla is back, and behold!...his vocals are excellent. Blasphemer's riffs are as good as ever, but this time they're more twisted, more doom/drone/noise-influenced, and more interesting than before. Hellhammer cuts down on blast beats and triggering and shows a totally new side to his drumming; looser and sometimes even devoid of an immediately recognizable rhythm and are, overall, aimed at evoking a dark, suffocating atmosphere.\n\nWhen I heard the final track, \"Anti\", for the first time (and was thoroughly impressed with it), I just hoped that it was not a pre-production version and that the album will actually sound as raw and filthy as the said track did. How relieved was I to hear the album with its cavernous lo-fi production! Surely it was recorded on professional equipment, but it does sound genuinely raw and unpolished. The guitars are full of the low end and are rather muffled, the bass is buried, and the drums are mixed in an odd way with the ride cymbal being the loudest element. This fits the music perfectly and shows that Mayhem can once again sound raw without falling into the \"St. Anger\" trap of blatant lack of authenticity.\n\nStrangely enough (or not), the two most important musicians on this album are the non-original members, Atilla and Blasphemer. They are the ones responsible for the music and lyrics and their performances are the most notable. The former shrieks, wails, cries, grumbles, and produces a wide variety of odd noises in a far more effective way than back on \"DMDS\". The latter, on the other hand, proves himself capable of creating disturbing, dissonant, and quite original riffs that are able to remain interesting despite being inherently rather inaccessible.\n\nIn conclusion, this is the beginning of a NEW Mayhem, a band able to stand on its own without a need for comparisons to past efforts. Not an easy listening, but a highly rewarding one.\n",
        "\n\u201cOrdo ad chao\u201d \u2013 from order to chaos. At last, Mayhem has done it, revived and reshaped the rawness of the glory years and provided everyone from fans to doubters the album that projects the band forward once again to the sharp end of extreme metal.\n\nThere\u2019s significance in the title. Initially announced as \u201cOrdo Ab Chao\u201d (order from chaos), the band revealed the true title closer to release. The change is appropriate: rather than compromise and try to restore some convention, predictability or \u201corder\u201d to their music to placate increasingly perplexed fans, Mayhem took the bold step, veered off and created something startlingly different yet again. From chaos to further chaos!\n\nMost Mayhem fans will agree that the last album, \u201cChimera\u201d, didn\u2019t quite cut it, although it pointed the way forward to an extent. Rather than restate the riff-heavy formula of \u201cDMDS\u201d or follow the misty mountain prog path of \u201cGDOW\u201d, \u201cChimera\u201d took the bestial blast of \u201cWolf\u2019s Lair Abyss\u201d, hammered it into layers and textures rather than riff-based song structures, gave it a super-clean and surgically precise attack and then \u2026 kinda didn\u2019t engage. It was as if the effort to slay with power and extremity couldn\u2019t quite gel with the pristine sheen of modern studio reproduction. If only Mayhem could somehow return to the necro sludge of the past without slavishly repeating old formulae \u2026\n\nWell they\u2019ve achieved it, and with integrity intact. The album\u2019s signature is principally in its low-fi sound. It\u2019s not the brittle attack of \u201cDeathcrush\u201d or the cavernous Grieghallen reverb of \u201cDMDS. It\u2019s definitely old school but \u2026 different. How did they do it? Did they use some low-budget demo studio or book time in Darkthrone\u2019s Necrohell? It sounds to me like Mayhem recorded in the best quality studio, then processed the tapes/files through the audio equivalent of PhotoShop, painting in the molten reds and basalt greys, grinding the mids and meat-tenderizing the bottom end, turning out the most satisfying leaden crunch. Hellhammer sounds like he borrowed Fenriz\u2019 toms, yet his cymbals shimmer through, like glints of sunlight through a volcanic cloud. Blasphemer turns down the treble to get closer than ever to Euronymous\u2019 classic somber tone. Necrobutcher disappears once more back into the mire, fusing with the muted kick drums to deliver a bass-heavy mix. Even the voice of newly-returned Atilla (no longer, it seems, spelled \u201cAttila\u201d) is made to serve the overall atmosphere, mixed down to compete with the backline.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that Blasphemer\u2019s influence as composer has pushed Mayhem towards more texture-based music, away from clearly defined riffs. The opening track, \u201cA Wise Birthgiver\u201d, is the shot across the bows, a true statement of intent. Rather than blow the listener away with a riff-driven metal overture, Blasphemer has chosen to create a dark, broiling vista, a first look into Mayhem\u2019s magma chamber of horrors. The second track, \u201cWall of Water\u201d sees the band get down to business with characteristically savage attack, rolling and careering like a black sea of lava. Atilla\u2019s voice is the perfect instrument to complement the murky mix, his theatrics \u2013 once reviled \u2013 now brought into play to shape, define and ride the music. Basal growls, strangled rasps, mournful tortured cries and his favourite demonic operatic howls \u2013 Atilla has expanded his repertoire since DMDS and his choice of vocal devices seems to match the music appropriately at every twist and turn.\n\n\u201cIlluminate Eliminate\u201d, at nearly ten minutes, is the longest track on the album and one of the longest ever recorded by the band. Again, it confidently shows which way Mayhem is heading \u2013 towards a more modernist symphonic approach, crafting longer atmospheric works built on shifting textural patterns.\n\nThe concluding track, \u201cAnti\u201d, is probably the closest to the older Mayhem in style. The pace is accelerated, driven by furious drumming and the whole band lets rip. Interesting, then, that label Season of Mist and Mayhem\u2019s website should pre-release this, the final album track, as a downloadable mp3 rather than another track more in the new mid-paced, moody style.\n\nSeason of Mist\u2019s packaging and the album cover\u2019s designers deserve a special gong. The limited edition\u2019s metal slipcase is impressive enough, but beneath it, the jewel case\u2019s slick and back tray reveal no text, logo or illustrations, only an expressionist spray of dark, igneous patterns, just the right visual representation of Mayhem\u2019s new music.\n\nI\u2019ve listened to the album half a dozen times and cannot fault it. Mayhem is minority music, so extreme that few will admit to enjoying it. This new atmospheric approach, yet another departure from the \u201cclassic\u201d DMDS sound and style, might possibly further alienate the (dwindling?) faithful. But, to me, \u201cOrdo Ad Chao\u201d is a modern masterpiece and, placed alongside the band\u2019s back catalogue, shows that, despite the serpentine and restless changes in style over twenty years, Mayhem answers to no one and continues to reign as the number one extreme band on the planet.\n",
        "\nMayhem is the first ever black metal band I got into back in the mid 90's. Mainly due to the stories I heard about them. I will always have a special place for the Dead-Euronymous era and I know nothing will ever out do their material. But I still liked some of Maniac era and now the Attila era. I didn't like his performance on 'De Mysteriis' except for the songs that I didn't hear Dead sing himself (Life Eternal, Cursed In Eternity and De Mysteriis). I generally don't like to give negative reviews of my favorite bands but when I eard this album I was pretty surprised. I didn't think Attila could please me as a singer but here he makes his material and he sounds good. His performance here is far better than on De Mysteriis in my opinion.\n\nOne of the first few things you'll notice when hearing this is the tune of the guitars and the atmosphere. It's noticeably darker and more \"necro\" sounding than before. I would even say that it's better than 'Chimera' as a whole. Attila really sounds comfortable with the band and really sounds fucking demented. His voice is not frightening like Varg's loud screams but he just sounds mentally unstable and schizophrenic. At times he'll growl, scream and even yell some \"operatic\" latin verses out loud. He's like 3 people rolled into one and all 3 personalities are trying to get out at the same time. Blasphemer's guitar sound and riffs are some of his best and less \"technical\" sounding, they're more straight up \"necro\" style riffing which is what I like best anyway. I think Hellhammer kind of holds back a bit here and doesn't show off like he did on the newe Dimmu album which is fine with me. Mayhem kind of drifted for a while there in trying to show off their technical prowess and strayed from the \"true\" black metal sound. As for Necrobutcher, he doesn't do anything remarkable but he never did in my mind anyway. He's a solid bassist and rumbles away with the rhythm as he does best so no surprise there. \n\nThe album starts off with an ambient like intro (A Wise Birthdgiver) and then hits us with 'Wall Of Water' and the guitar and drums go along nicely before Attila gets into his crazy mode and the song is a good beginning to the album, I'd even say that his voice resembles that of Horidus from Demoncy. The next track 'Great Work Of Ages' has a similar pattern to the prior track with the low guitar tone and repetitve drums, Attila once again whispers some incoherent babble and then yells some operatic stuff and then growls some other things. This track is a perfect example of \"schizophrenic\" side of Attila where it seems like 3 different people are doing the vocals. Illuminate Eliminate is almost a 10 minute track and perhaps the most weird one on the whole album and that's saying something. It's hard for me to describe this track but it's definitely the slowest one here. You just have to listen to it yourself. They save perhaps their most known track 'Anti' for last and it's on par with the rest of the stuff on here, all in all it's a very consistent release and perhaps the most unified and focused they've sounded in many many years. \n\n\nLike Marduk, Mayhem needed a shakeup at the frontman position since they were both starting to get a bit stale. So looking at all the Norwegian bands of the early 90's era it's kind of shocking to think that Mayhem (Gorgoroth also get the nod) have stayed closest to the black metal sound today. Darkthrone kind of sound like punkish black metal, Satyricon sound like black 'n' roll, Burzum is on hold for obvious reasons, Immortal and Emperor are doing comeback tours but before they split up they were mere shadows of their early days. I suppose Mayhem are a band that will always have a chip on their shoulders and always have something to prove to the public since no one ever gives them a fair shake for continuing without Dead and Euronymous. After hearing this I for one am glad they did.\n",
        "\nMayhem is the band's name and most definitely mayhem were the circumstances in which this first full-length album was recorded and released in 1993 which help to explain why, when you clear away the mythology, the rumours and other baggage around this record, you find a pretty good if not technically accomplished black metal album. Your first impression can be that the music is fast, furious and frenzied and all over the place and on repeated listenings you realise you have to accept it on its own terms as a raging vibrato guitar noise drone that complements the brutal drumming. The production of the record is quite basic yet fairly clear. Drummer Hellhammer thrashes away on the skins at several hundred BPM and guitarist Euronymous, accompanied by bass player Count Grishnackh aka Varg Vikerenes concentrate on whipping up the intense strings-based sandstorm drone out of which Euronymous may play a chilling, spiky lead melody that pierces straight to the bone. In those early days, singer Attila Csihar, who replaced Dead as vocalist after that fellow's suicide, had a, uh, less refined vocal technique than he does now but his dulcet tombstone tones lend a special brand of psychotic madness and darkness to the recording, and there are even moments of camp in his singing in tracks like \"Cursed to Eternity\". In the title piece he carries on like a demon-possessed Pavarotti howling the Latin lyrics. Csihar doesn't even pretend that he can sing as fast as the others can play so he proceeds at his own leisurely pace (though he manages to keep in time with everyone) and slavers over the lyrics with a relish that is almost cartoony and verges on the pornographic.\n\nPenned by Dead originally, all the lyrics are creepy and possess an obsessive quality: they draw little sketches of darkness and fear, and of the fragility of life and the ease with which it can end so quickly and so soon. The title track describes a sacrificial ritual performed in the dead of night. The simplicity of the lyrics masks very dark and troubled depths and a yearning for peace which, unfortunately for Dead (I've seen rumours that he could have been a borderline schizophrenic), only death could bring.\n\nThe album conveys an overall impression of intense and never-ending rage, psychosis and frightening evil. The production does not make the music as raw as it could be but all the same it is unstoppable with a life and force all its own, and this is perhaps the main achievement of the record. The style of music is free-flowing metal drone close to minimalism with no regard for song structures or other song-based conventions and in the early 1990s this would have been unusual. The musicians play so fast their playing becomes all intuitive and they seem to be possessed by an alien spirit. The ambience of the record is so sinister, even the spaces between tracks are ominous.\n\nIn its own way, \"De Mysteriis ...\" is an important piece of black metal history as the style of the music here helped to define black metal as distinct from other forms of heavy metal. It seems to be the only full-length album Euronymous made before he died (if the earlier \"Deathcrush\" is counted as an EP) and it happens to feature the man who would later murder him. (There is of course the story that Euronymous's parents tried to get Vikernes's contribution to the album erased. Certainly the bass parts aren't very high in the mix.) The album also helped to cement Attila Csihar's reputation as a singer of sinister repute and Csihar rejoined the band in 2004. The album's cover is of interest too as it features a silhouette of one of Scandinavia's largest cathedrals, Nidarosdomen in Tronheim, Norway, where the Norwegian crown jewels are kept. I have heard that Vikernes once wanted to blow up this cathedral but haven't seen any information to support this rumour.\n\nWhen you consider the unstable and tragic context in which the album was made, you realise it's a wonder that it ever got released at all.\n",
        "\nLike I'm sure a lot of you reading this will be, I was initally extremely excited when I first heard that Attila was returning to the Mayhem fold, and even more so when it was leaked onto the grapevine that he'd be bringing back some of the stygian darkness of his SunnO))) guest time back with him, after the rather sterile work of the 'nu' Mayhem in the last few years. However, my excitement dissipated considerably when I heard the song 'Anti', which closes the album, which was let slip by the label as promotion. I thought it was dull, emotionless, and out of context I had no idea how it could fit into an album that would be anywhere near as good as Ordo ab Chao was rumoured to be. Puzzlement ensued.\n\nSo, here we are a few weeks later, and the new album emerges whole. And it's fucking great. Not only is it the band's darkest and most coherent work thematically and sonically since DMDS, but the album has a geniune 'evil' vibe surrounding it, created by the angular and doomy riffs - a far cry from the occasionally extremely awkward sounding ones on the last album - and of course Attila's excellent (and utterly demented) vocal performance. Although it sounds like he uses his whole body, not just his fucking throat, on some of the songs. \n\nThe album makes infrequent and subtle use of non-distorted guitars and background soundscapes, with distinct drone and avant-doom influences on a number of the songs, most notably \"Wall of Water\" and \"Illuminate Eliminate\". The wall to wall blasting that typified Mayhem's post-Euro output is all but gone, replaced with a keen understanding of dynamics that permeates the whole record, resulting in a multi-faceted and extremely exciting listening experience. Which is not only great, but really surprising. Don't let your prejudices against the Blasphemer-era lineup ruin your chance of getting a fucking classy album.\n",
        "\nWhat makes this album special is the pure unadulterated black metal that these Norwegians managed to create. This album reeks of nihilism (a dead man\u2019s guitar hovering over the basslines of his murderer) and misanthropy with brutal riffing and drumming and the insane vocals. Besides that the circumstances in which this album was released with the murder of Euronymous and various other events in Norway makes this album an important milestone as this album was released at the peak of the Norwegian black metal movement. \n\nAttila\u2019s vocals are simply insane. Initially the vocals sound ridiculous but later as you get the hang of it, you\u2019ll feel that it is pretty much appropriate for the kind of feelings that this album attempts to evoke. These mad operatic vocals blend with the music to create a cold atmosphere. Themes of death, decay, the supernatural dominate the lyrics. The lyrics show extreme apathy towards life and all that it considered normal and construct a morbid atmosphere and finds beauty in it. \n\nThe riffs in this album are simple yet awesome as the songs are pretty much riff oriented. Do not underestimate these simple tremolo drenched riffs as they achieve cohesion with the vocals and the lyrics. The drumming is brutal and exceptional with machine like precision. \n\nThis album very well captures the aesthetics of black metal. It is cold, dark, misanthropic and brutal. Every song of this album is important to create such atmosphere. The sound is further developed from that in 'Deathcrush' as it is atmospheric achieves higher level of complexity. This is a monster of an album which set the standards for later bands. But I haven\u2019t seen a more nihilistic album than this.\n",
        "\nHow do you get an average album to be regarded as legendary? Simple. All you have to do is convince a band member to kill himself with a shotgun, make a necklace from pieces of his shattered skull (maybe get some rumors going about sampling some of the brain), then kill a second member with a knife. This is how Live in Leipzig, a terminally mediocre album, has been elevated to \"classic\" status in some circles. What really makes this album cult (or is it kvlt?) is that it is Mayhem's only \"official\" album with Dead on vocals -- I use quotes because it was in fact originally a bootleg that was later turned to an album. On to the review then.\n\nThe good thing here is the tracklisting. It has pretty much all of Mayhem's early mandatory songs. They logically kick off with Deathcrush and continue with the basics like Necrolust, Freezing Moon, Carnage, etc. No complaints in that department. The production, or lack thereof rather, is pathetic; however, I won't hold this against them since they probably didn't even plan on making it an official album, not to mention that we're talking about black metal here, so you can't really use poor production as an argument against the music. It is the performance of the band that really brings this album down. First and foremost, this sounds like a practice session. None of the band members are performing as well as they could. You want some examples of mistakes? Tune in to Carnage and listen to the riffs starting at 1:34 and you'll hear Euronymous missing some chords. Or go to Pagan Fears and listen at around 6:02. Hellhammer has apparently dropped a drumstick. I know that shit happens, and there is never a perfect performance by anyone, but here I feel like I am listening to some total amateurs. It's like somebody gathered some middle schoolers who were playing for the first time and handed them a piece of paper with tabs and lyrics and said, \"Here, play this.\" Necrobutcher is practically absent. He could have been left out and nothing would have been different. As for Dead, he's not bad, but he definitely doesn't offer what you would expect from someone who is hailed as the greatest black metal vocalist ever by a fair share of kids (again, see shotgun to the head). In fact, he sounds better on some of those practice session bootlegs than he does on here. At least on those he sounds insane at times, whereas here he sounds almost like he's not even trying. Do this: see if you can find Out From the Dark (Dead's last rehearsal). Listen to Chainsaw Gutsfuck. Then, switch to the version on this album. In which one does he sound possessed? (Hint: it's not the one played here). Not to mention the instruments, in Out of the Dark it's like they're grinding away at some corpse, while here they're trying to not forget what song they're even playing. Finally, what's with the slowing down? Deathcrush, Chainsaw Gutsfuck, they're too fucking slow. Is Mayhem going for some groove here? That's not to say that slow is bad, if the song is meant to be played accordingly, but knowing what these songs are supposed to sound like I can say that's certainly not the case here.\n\nAll in all, it's not a terrible album. I think they did alright on Necrolust, Freezing Moon (by the way you gotta love the vocal introduction to that one), and Pure Fucking Armageddon. And if you like Mayhem, you will like this album too. It's a live act, it's raw, it has some great songs, and it's much better than Dawn of the Black Hearts (although the cover isn't). But given its legendary status, one has to question its merits a little more carefully. To me, a band played a random show, probably drunk, and made a recording. It's not a failure, but it is overrated.\n",
        "\nWell, I bought this one because it's from Mayhem. But it doesn't satisfied me as it should. It's not a mystery for anyone that Mayhem went softer after \"De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\", but they still manage to get some good albums... but never with the same intensity as their early releases.\n\n\nThis one is from the \"Grand Declaration of War\" tour. The songs are well chosen, and good performed. The trouble, I think, is the direction. We're watching a live DVD, in front of a crowd, or just watching a band playing? No crowd shoots are found on this DVD. Just one or two, but you easily forget them. Of course that see Mayhem playing good stuff will always be great, but we're watching a LIVE show, where the crowd is an important factor. Without the crowd reaction, the show seems cold and dead. We could say that BM bands always had little crowds, but with a good direction, the shows are really great. Still they're some good shoots in this one, but the director's work is just average and doesn't make any good to a band like Mayhem.\n\n\nMusicianship is just good, no more, no less. The lowest point for me is Maniac's performance, he gets really tired after a while, and it's obvious, with all the cuts that he get with the barb wire... Blasphemer's guitar and Necrobutcher's bass are as good as always. The highlight is Hellhammer's drum playing, his technique is outstanding, sometimes he plays like a restless machine. \n\n\nThe stage is nice, with all the barb wire that Maniac use to cut himself, the guns at the side of the stage and of course, the pig head. It's great when Maniac stabs his knife in the head, and throw it to the crowd. The stage, at least, is nice, it fits good with the \"Grand Declaration of War\" concept.\n\n\nExtras are bad. Just short interview with the guys of the band, and a 'backstage' video with Maniac cutting a girl with a blade. It's funny to hear the guys singing 'He's a Maniac...', but the extras don't offer anything else.\n\n\nOnly the diehard fans of Mayhem should buy this DVD. It doesn't shows the full power of Mayhem, and it's directed in a very bad way, so you're warned. Better stay away from this one.\n",
        "\nCertainly, the first Venom albums are essential if you are searching a definition for 'black metal', and some records of Celtic Frost and Bathory too, who perfected all that dark force who developed later in Norway, in the early 90's, with bands like Darkthrone, and of course, all the legacy of a man like Euronymous, through Mayhem. Yes, it's true that the circumstances of his death overrated his figure a bit, but \"De Mysteriis\" influenced the whole norwegian BM movement. No band has reached the high levels of this album, and I think that never would be reached anyway. Beyond the cold and asymmetric rhythms and structures of the music, they settled a way of making black metal, copied by all the nordic bands that came after Mayhem, some of them at a good way, but other in a very bad way. Another topic is the Hellhammer's drum playing, that influenced everyone with his cold and mechanic style.\n\n\n\nAfter Dead's suicide, the hungarian Attila took his place as frontman, and really gave his personal touch to the music, wich proved to be the best choice at that time, in fact, everyone expected that Attila's singing sounded a little like Dead, and there's many similarities, but Attila's voice, cold and demonic, gave to Mayhem a different level, although sometimes it's a little exaggerated.\n\n\nThe bass lines were recorded by Varg Vikernes, also known as Count Grischnack, who later murdered Euronymous, some months after the recording of the album. In fact, Euronymous' family didn't wanted an album with Varg and Euronymous together. Hellhammer told them that he would re-record all the bass lines, but he lowered the volume of them instead, because he didn't know nothing about playing a bass guitar.\n\n\nThe first song, \"Funeral Fog\", burst in on a so intense way, bitter and cold, that with a few notes you'll realize what's to come later, not just in the album, with an entire influenced generation too. In general lines, it may seem that \"De Mysteriis\" is monotone, and probably it's true, but when you process the ambients and bitterness, you'll surely realize that you are in front of a masterpiece of BM music.\n\n\nWith \"Freezing Moon\" you notice some changes in the music, from extreme and raw to slow and with a cold tuning, \"Freezing Moon\" is one of the few songs with a guitar solo. \"Cursed in Eternity\" follows the same patterns, mechanic, dark, cold and of course nocturnal. \"Pagan Fears\" starts in a very catchy way, a good rhythm with nice drum playing, when after a while, the anti-rhythmic patterns start again, the exaggerated voice and the drums and guitars dicotomy. \"Life Eternal\" adorns the album with that melodic bass playing and the almost unnoticeable Euronymous' guitar solos, in a song that would be great influence for the epic (and viking) bands that came after Mayhem.\n\n\n\"From the Dark Past\" and \"Buried by Time and Dust\" are the less melodic pieces of the record, but the most intense ones. In \"Buried\", Hellhammer's drum playing is astonishing, he seems to be a restless machine.\n\n\nFinally, the title track, settles the intensity of the whole album, with that grim voices of Attila, although in this song, he does some clean vocals.\n\n\nFinishing, \"De Mysteriis\" changed the way of making extreme metal, and made of black metal, more that a music, a way to see life (or death)\n",
        "\nThis EP was the first recording of new material by the reformed Mayhem, with earlier Mayhem members, Maniac (Vocals) and Necrobutcher (Bass), along with there newly appointed guitarist Blasphemer. This is often considered to be part one of Grand Declaration Of War by the band, but luckily, they have very little in common with each other. This recording is in my opinion, the most vicious of any of Mayhem's material, and seemed as though this new lineup had plenty of new ideas and surprises waiting for us in the future.\n\nThe music is about as close as one can get to death metal, while still being considered black metal. Maniac's vocals are absolutely brutal, although this of course does not mean everything. Maniac's vocals here do indeed sound like a raped cat as another reviewer put it. Some seem to like his style, but I personally do not. His voice in my opinion ruins some of the music from being great. It's too bad that Attila did not participate here, as I imagine this release would have been much better if he had. But regardless, the actual music here is quite good. Especially the songs Ancient Skin and I Am Thy Labyrinth. Blasphemer puts on a good performance here, some of the riffs sound very similar to thoses Euronymous would have written, especially on Ancient Skin. The drums are of course fast and decent overall, not much else to say about them. There is a small amount of experimentation if you want to call it that, there are background spoken vocals on one track by Maniac, nothing really that adds or subtracts from the music, but hints at what was ahead I suppose. \n\nNot much else to truly comment on, due to the fact that there are only four actual tracks on here that clock out at less then twenty five minutes. I just believe this would have been infinitely better had Attila or someone new maybe took on vocals, Maniac's performance is the only aspect here that significantly lowers the score here. I would say it's worth the purchase and is the best of all the post De Mysteriis releases.\n",
        "\nAfter Grand Declaration Of War, and the negative response by many fans, the members of Mayhem chose to revert back to traditional black metal for there next release. Still under direction of Maniac, I had low expectations for this album. Upon listening through it, I found that it was an improvement (Although, it wouldn't have really taken much to improve from there last release) yet, still left me somewhat unsatisfied. This album seems to be very uninspired with no driving energy behind the music, and is just a bland listen.\n\nThe music here is certainly black metal, that can not be denied. One reviewer here claimed that this is mallcore, but I honestly can't see any traces of mallcore in this album at all. It's brutal and dark, with no experimentation in the least present on here. I would say this was a good effort, but as stated, lacks passion. It seems as though it may have even been rushed a bit. But regardless, the musicianship is of quality. Blasphemer once again surprises me here. Some of the riffs are quite catchy, especially those present on Whore and Dark Night Of The Soul. Some riffs though seem to be recycled, especially on some of the later tracks. Drums are also of quality, Hellhammer definately seems to be the backbone of this band still. Vocals are of course, performed by Maniac, and as I have stated in other reviews, I highly dislike his vocals most of the time. I will admit though, he seems to have improved a bit on this album, although is still nothing special, but doesn't sound too bad on some tracks. Definately one of the more tolerable performances by Maniac, at least in my opinion. Production is very good for a black metal album, which it is sometimes criticized for, but that doesn't really hurt or help the album either way in my eyes.\n\nThese lyrics are more interesting then there last two efforts. They are mainly about war, death, and misanthropy. They seem to try to be within the same vein of Dead's old lyrics. Although no where near as great, they are far more original then any of the other later Mayhem releases.\n\nI would say that this album is a bit underrated by some, and is by no means, a sell out or mallcore album as some claim it to be. This is straight forward, brutal black metal, with a few surprises. Yet this is also not anything to be remembered really, I would say it's just another average album as a whole.\n",
        "\nAs much I hate to seem like I am simply jumping on the bandwagon here, I must admit to this album being a major disappointment. As most know, after De Mysteriis was released, Mayhem as a band disbanded, obviously due to the murder of Euronymous, Vikernes being sentenced, and Attila's distance, Hellhammer was the only remaining member. He chose to continue the band in 1995, with past members, Maniac on vocals and Necrobutcher on bass, with a new guitarist, Blasphemer. After recording the vicious Wolf's Lair Abyss EP, this newly formed lineup seemed to be promising.\n\nThis album is very experimental, incorporating electronic and industrial elements, and other effects, along with black metal elements. Just not what you would expect from a band like Mayhem considering their past works. I think it was great that they decided to attempt at something original, I just wish they hadn't chosen this path. With Euronymous dead, Maniac seems to have taken creative direction.\n\nGrand Declaration Of War is rather vicious at times, especially with Maniac's black metal vocals, as they are quite brutal. This, however, does not mean they are good. I have never been a fan of Maniac's vocals, mainly because they are very uninteresting and uninspired, in my opinion. Vocals aside, Blasphemer however, does seem to be a suitable replacement for Euronymous, although not as good, does a decent and respectable job. Some of the riffs in the songs Crystalized Pain in Deconstruction, In The Lies Where Upon You Lay, and View From Nihil are decent. The drums are quite fast, and decent as well on some songs, yet at sometimes can be aggravating also. Some songs have passages where Maniac is talking, which I don't like at all. Perhaps the worst song on here is A Bloodsword And A Colder Sun, which uses odd whispering vocal effects, and all instruments are absent, replaced with digitalized beats instead, which is a disgrace in my opinion for such a band.\n\nThe whole album is a concept album, with lyrics about future destruction of the world, society decaying, war, and related topics. I wouldn't say the lyrics are terrible, just truly nothing new really. I assume Maniac wrote these, which is not surprising, as he is also not the most original in this department either.\n\nI've sure fans of industrial metal would enjoy this, but for traditional fans of black metal and earlier Mayhem, this is truly not for you. What saved this review from a serious low rating was some of the musicianship, namely by Blasphemer. The whole idea of this kind of experimentation by a band such as Mayhem though was a very bad idea. I am just happy that Maniac is out of the band now, and with Attila back on vocals, perhaps we can look forward to some decent material in the future.\n",
        "\nThis album is most known for the events surrounding it's release. Mostly everyone is familiar with the story already, not going to write about it. But judging by those who created this and all that happened, it is surprising this was even finished and released. With all considered, this is truly a landmark in black metal and extreme metal in general. The album is almost perfect in my opinion, and is a remarkable improvement from the material on Deathcrush. \n\nThis album can be best described as cold black metal with hints of death metal (Those, mainly being on vocals in certain parts). After Dead's suicide in 1991, Hungarian black metal vocalist Attila Csihar from Tormentor was invited to perform the vocals for this album. Although Dead unleashed some great vocals during his time in the band, I am definately more happy that Attila performed the vocals here. Despite his Hungarian accent that is sometimes noticeable, Attila is a great vocalist. Unlike most black metal vocalists, he incorporates much in his vocals. He growls, drones, grunts, screams, and even chants. His vocals are very interesting and are not of one single pitch or style like most black metal vocalists. His vocals adds a lot to the music, I would even go as far to say that I am glad Dead was not alive to record this.\n\nThe actual music is excellent. Euronymous puts on a great performance on guitar. As I've said, he was always able to create simple, yet catchy, hypnotic riffs. The songs all vary in tempo, and all tend to be very atmospheric. In many of the songs, there are extended periods without any vocals, which works in their favor here. Freezing Moon is a slow, heavy track, while, Pagan Fears is fast paced and vicious. The drumming here is also superior, Hellhammer showcases a lot of talent. His best performance being on the tracks Buried By Time And Dust and Freezing Moon in my opinion. Varg Vikernes does good on bass as well, although it seems to be lowered, I'd still prefer him to Necrobutcher as a musician anytime. The entire line up here was very talented and all seemed to work very well together. Just about every song on here is a highlight, although the best in my opinion would be Freezing Moon, Pagan Fears, Life Eternal, and the title track. The title track is especially a highlight, being the most epic, enhanced with Attila chanting in certain parts. I would say this is the best track on the entire album. The production is much better then on previous releases yet still retains the primitive, cold atmosphere intended.\n\nAs opposed to Deathcrush, I really enjoy the lyrics on this album as well. All written by Dead before his death, are very cryptic and dark. They mainly focus on depression, death, ancient times, and the occult. Very few bands can compare in this department. The lyrics are just perfect and fit the music very well.\n\nOverall, this is easily Mayhem's greatest work and it's just too unfortunate that such a line up that was present on here will never get the chance to work together again. It was very original for the time it was being produced, and influenced countless bands in black metal and metal in general. It was unique from anything released prior and still stands out in quality when compared to most that was released after. I would reccommend this to any fan of black metal, although any real fan has already heard it most likely. No one's black metal collection is complete without it.\n",
        "\n\"Deathcrush\" presents us with the early Mayhem, which played Thrash combined with the signs of what would become later Black Metal. The production is certainly raw, but you can't miss any notes here as in their earlier demos. Though the production isn't clear, this EP is far away from being a mess and overall the sound fits the music very well.\n\nThis EP contains eight tracks: four of them are actually songs the band has written, three are interludes and there is one cover for Venom's song \"Witching Hour\", which no doubt is a Black Metal song. Eight tracks in eighteen minutes is of course much too short, but I prefer it to be an essential short release than a long and tiresome one.\n\nThe first track is an instrumental intro played only by drums and percussion. It has a short theme which lasts for all of its two minutes, followed by some nice percussion hits. Outstanding in it's way, pretty nice intro. Then the first real song begins, \"Deathcrush\". It's built from ONLY three riffs which last for over three minutes but it really keeps one's interest for the whole song because they are fucking catchy in an extreme way, especially the main riff. This is such a catchy and easy song to play that there are more than a hundred bands which covered this song, you can even check it here, on this website. \"Chainsaw Gutsfuck\" is a less kick-ass song than \"Deathcrush\", but it's a pretty good one. It Contains three or four mid-tempo riffs on down-tuned guitar and the vocals also are a bit more relaxed. It's Not as brutal as the title track but this is another catchy song. \"The Witching Hour\" (a Venom cover) has the best vocals on this EP. There is an echo which increases the dark atmosphere and here it's Messiah's vocals which doesn't sound like he's being butchered while screaming [as how Maniac sounds]. \"(Weird) Manheim\" is a creepy and depressed instrumental by Manheim with a slow riff and creepy lead bass. Now, the outro is fucking weird, moreso than the previous instrumental. All the band members sing a silly text in a silly way: \"All the little flowers are singing, All the little birds are too, They are very happy, and we hope you are to.\" They repeat it a bit, each time becoming more aggressive, and in the end they scream something which I can't really identify. Genius or silliness? you decide....\n\nOverall \"Deathcrush\" is a pretty worthy release which built most from the catchy and simple guitar riffs by Euronymous. Get it if you find it because this is a pretty brutal and catchy release which you'll dig for a long time. Not their best moment of course, but an important level in the progression of Mayhem till they reached their Black Metal unique style.\n",
        "\nMuch has been said about Mayhem's debut release. Many fans claim it is a classic release and that no fan of extreme metal be without. One reviewer here even described this as near perfect. Yet, I fail to see the excellence of this EP. I think the majority of the reason this gets such great reviews is because of it's historical value. This was released in 1987, and very few bands were as extreme as Mayhem were here during this time. For this reason, and this reason only, does this EP retain such high scores and praise.\n\nMany insist that this is a pure black metal release, but that could not be any further from the truth. The only aspect of black metal present here is the harsh production, which is truly raw, to the point that it ruins some of the music. The music itself sounds like thrash with death metal vocals. The vocals are brutal especially for the time. Maniac performs the vocals here, and with everything else he has done with Mayhem, he sounds absolutely awful most of the time. His worst performance on this release is definately on the song Necrolust. Some tracks he doesn't sound too bad on, but the majority of the time, he ruins the music.\n\nSome of the actual music is decent. Euronymous seemed to be very good at developing very simple yet very catchy riffs. The riffs in the song Deathcrush are especially catchy. The first part of Pure Fucking Armageddon is fast paced and catchy as well. They get too repetitive for their own good sometimes though, and some sound very similar to one another. Some of the riffs in Chainsaw Gutsfuck sound similar to those of the song Deathcrush at a slower pace. The drums are played by Mayhem's original drummer Manheim. They aren't too poorly played yet sound terrible due to the recording production. \n\nOne of the worst aspects of this release in my opinion was the lyrics. The lyrics are very poorly written. Especially the lyrics to Necrolust and Pure Fucking Armageddon. The lyrics in Pure Fucking Armageddon are just words and phrases with no real meaning that seem like they were written by a group of middle school posers who think they are evil. It's definately good that Dead was brought into the band a year later and replaced whoever wrote these lyrics.\n\nBut despite it's faults, this EP has it's moments. It was undeniablely groundbreaking for the time that it was released. Yet it seems to be praised only for it's extreme nature at an early time, rather then the actual quality of the music. It has very little in common with any of the other Mayhem releases. I would reccommend the release that would come after this as opposed to this EP, but most people have already heard and embraced it. This is worth a listen but in my opinion, is nowhere near as great as most fans claim it to be.\n",
        "\nMayhem is the most prolific Black Metal band in the genre's history. They\u2019ve survived several shakes up in their formation and released quite a few successful albums and evolved their sound beyond what anyone could really imagine, but it all comes back to the bands first demo tape, \"Pure Fucking Armageddon\". \u201cPure Fucking Armageddon\u201d has the potential to be the definitive demo album for a black metal band but it falls short on so many levels that overall it's a huge disappointment.\n\nThe only positive thing at all about this demo is the fact that it somehow managed to land Mayhem a deal to record; otherwise \"Pure Fucking Armageddon\" is a flop. In fact it may very well be one of the worst demo tapes in metal history.\n\nTo be honest it sounds like this demo was recorded in a moldy bathroom and then defecated upon by a rabid dog before being \"mastered\" and sent out to the world for listening consumption; the vocals are almost absent spare a few noticeable screeches and wails because of the volume difference in the audio channels; the guitars sound hellish (not in a good way either), and the drums seem to overtake everything at some points. If there was a bass on this demo I had no idea because I couldn't even hear it, I'll assume there was but I cannot find any real evidence to support it.\n\nYou may be thinking, \"if this is such a bad demo why give it a 60?\" The answer is quite simple: when there are some actual moments of clarity and you are able to hear what the hell is going on in terms of the music its great. You can hear the brutality and veracity of Mayhem in their earliest days. That's why I give this demo a 60.\n\nAs aforementioned, \"Pure Fucking Armageddon\" has so much potential to become the quintessential Black Metal demo album but it falls tragically short because of its horrible recording quality. The saddest lines a reviewer ever has to write are these: \"what could've been\". So if you have this demo and listen to it, weep and just think as to \"what could've been\".\n",
        "\nMayhem has few original songs. Most of them are repeated in live albums and compilations. I think this EP is the most accomplished effort from this band. De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas is some overrated because all the Vikernes-Euronymous stuff, and most of the songs of that record were played with Dead in the Live in Leipzig album. And they sounded better with Dead instead of Attila, at least for me. Great Declaration of War is not the \"true\" Mayhem that you would expect. Chimera is a little boring, but still good black metal. Only Wolf's Lair Abyss can be compared with this EP. But Mayhem without Euronymous is not what they were in the past, and this record proves it. Just 6 songs (5, without the intro) that shows us the raw power of the early black metal in Norway, and of course all the darkness and evil of The True Mayhem. \n\n\nMusicianship is good. The guitar, bass and drums playing are outstanding. I get a little missed with Manheim's vocals, but they are still cool. Anyway, with that instrumental power behind him, Manheim's vocals gets solid and crushing. All the black metal scene on late 80's/early 90's was very competitive, and that fact forced the performers to be more and more brutal on their records and live shows. So we have the most insane, shredding and raw black metal bands and records of the whole black metal story, with Mayhem, Darkthrone, Gorgoroth, etc. When all the \"satanist case\" calmed down a little with Vikernes' jailing, the bands took separate paths on their music, including Mayhem, and some smaller bands disappeared from the scene. Also new black metal bands, a little softer and more experimental than their elders, got spaces in the mainstream, like Emperor, Dimmu Borgir and Satyricon. But none of them would ever reach the quality levels of the early black metal. \n\n\n\nThe album starts with \"Silvester Anfang\" an instrumental intro of percussions. It's boring and repetitive. It shouldn't last so long, with just the half is OK. Almost two minutes of wasted time. Next, we have \"Deathcrush\", the Mayhem's most enduring classic song. It starts with a cool, catchy guitar riff in mid-tempo. After a while, the rhythm gets faster and crazier. In the middle of the song, after the chorus, the bass player does the same initial riff, then mid-tempo and then fast tempo again, till the end of the song. I can't hear the Manheim's vocals clearly, as in the whole EP, but his screams are OK for black metal. The next track is \"Chainsaw Gutsfuck\" an amazing song that is also my favorite of Mayhem's repertoire. It starts with a slow bass riff, followed then by the guitar and the drums. It goes with the same riff, inspirated by Black Sabbath a little bit, without any important rhythm change. Cool song, anyway. \"Witching Hour\" is, of course, a Venom cover, just the half of the original, but with doubled speed. A little bit faster than the live version of Witching Hour, played by Venom in Eine Kleine Nachtsmusik. Here, the Manheim's vocals get a little more clear and understandable. It's always hard to cover a famous song, so think what about to cover a classic one. Cradle of Filth destroyed (that is the proper word for it) Slayer's Hell awaits and Iron Maiden's Hallowed be thy name. But Mayhem covers Venom's Witching hour succesfully. That's a great merit for the band: not just they are good with their songs, their are good covering everlasting classics too. The last song is \"(Weird) Manheim/Pure fucking armageddon\". The first part ((Weird) Manheim) is an instrumental piece of bass, of just 46 seconds. Short instrumental pieces are good, you must be an outstanding musician to play good and lengthy instrumetal pieces, like Iron Maiden's Genghis Kahn or Transylvania. Or you can create good atmospheres for the song, like Burzum. The next part is Pure fucking armageddon, a proper title to describe the song. Hellhammer's drums are just crushing and fucking brutal. Euronymous' guitars and Necrobutcher's bass complete the amazing instrumental arsenal. Manheim screams like a possessed demon. Pure fucking armageddon is a very good example to how to play true black metal. Not also that song, the entire album is an amazing show of true black metal. \n\n\n\nIf you want to know what true norwegian black metal's about, try to get this EP. Not try, YOU MUST have this one if you consider yourself a true black metallist. If you like anything brutal, well played and of course, true metal, you'll surely like Deathcrush. It's an important piece of metal's history, this shows us that the fear of the christian community about black metal and satanism wasn't so exaggerated. This is pure satanism, bloody gore, brutal and true metal. GET THIS NOW IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT!\n",
        "\nBleak and painful can only begin to describe the agony that this album bursts from its guitar drones, drum blasts, and howling vocals. Without a doubt in my mind this is one of the finest Black Metal albums released and should not be underscored for the dark history behind its creation.\n\n\nOn the surface \"De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\" seems like a typical Black Metal, \"Hail Satan\", kind of thing but you've got to delve beneath that facade. Sure there is the whole hail Satan thing and the paganism but that's the hallmark of Black Metal lyrics and music. This album is so well done in terms of sound. Each of the tracks has an ambient air to them that make it all the more \"evil\" sounding (after all that's what Black Metal is isn't it? Guys trying to sound as evil as possible). \n\n\nEuronymous' guitar playing is nothing phenomenal or earth shattering but it does deserved to be mentioned for its veracity. Every riff on this album is perfect, strummed in exact patterns, and technical with a hint of simplicity somewhere. Attila Csihar sends us back to the very pits of hell with his vocals. Some would say they get annoying or irritating at times. To me they fit the tracks and the rest of the ambient hellish noise perfectly. He is never too loud, never too rasped, just a fine Black Metal voice. Last but not least Hellhammer pummels away on his drum kit. The blast beats and cymbal crashes make it sound as if the entire world is falling down around you as you listen to this and if you even once deviate from the order of things all shall die. That's the kind of sound \"De Mysteriis Dom Sathans\" offers up to a listener. \n\n\nNow to the negatives. This is not a perfect album by any means. Is it one of the best Black Metal albums? Yes. But there are better. It very well may be the best Mayhem album however. The only real flaw I find in this album is that some of the tracks seem to be in the same key and even use the same riffs and note patterns, just a bit mixed up to add a bit of flavor to it. It's not a bad album by any means. In fact it is well worth you buying. I whole heartedly recommend picking up this album. It's a piece of Black Metal history that should not be forgotten.\n\n\nMayhem may not have a masterpiece on their hands but it certainly has changed to shape and way Black Metal music has been made over the past 10+ years and that is worth more than any masterpiece could bring.\n",
        "\nThis live album is the prime example of the \"true\" Mayhem in their heyday. Although they never recorded a studio album with the \"classic\" lineup, this live release, albeit very rough, shows the greatness of Mayhem's lineup during the early '90s. The album contains nine tracks of classic Mayhem, everything from the beginning (Pure Fucking Armageddon, Deathcrush) up to what would later become De Mysteriis classics (Funeral Fog, Freezing Moon).\n\nDead's vocals are second-to-none in terms of setting the mood for the music. His painful growls, combined with the rough atmosphere of the straight, raw live recording (no post-production or noise editing here), make this an amazing black metal listen. It isn't beautifully polished, it's like a live black metal album should be: raw and exactly as it was heard live.\n\nThis, however, brings criticism, even from me. In a couple songs it's apparent they haven't practiced enough, because several times Euronymous misses chords or Hellhammer misses beats. Each time they improvise and attempt to make it work (like any band playing live should) but it sort of ruins the mood and atmosphere created somewhat, especially if one is a musician himself or herself.\n\nDespite these shortcomings, however, Live in Leipzig is an amazing bootleg turned live black metal album. If this album were polished, with Dead's vocals, it would be the ultimate Mayhem release. On its own it still stands as a raw black classic.\n",
        "\nMayhem is a band that brings out so many emotions from black metal fans; love, hatred and disgust. We haven't even gotten into the content of the music yet. While I am in no doubt a big big fan of the Dead-Euronymous era and believe that it will never bettered, I do like Maniac as a vocalist as well. He's no Dead, but no one will ever match his look, style and intensity. I know some reading this may just cringe at that but I always found his voice to be original and his lyrics were some of the most thought provoking and yet anti-christian as well. He also definitely had stage presence. Here he delivers some of his most memorable vocal work.\n\nThe main difference in this live album from say 'Live In Leipzig' is that its more technical and a better recording. The band is tight and play their parts to a tee. Hellhammer is as usual excellent, Necrobutcher has improved immensely as a bassist and Blasphemer is a very good guitarist, he plays the Euronymous era songs almost as if it were his own, he's very adept and plays note for note every track pre-1997. This was recorded in 2000 during the 'Grand Declaration Of War' tour. I didn't care much for GDOW since it was too experimental and just wasn't \"black\" enough for my taste. But I must say that every single song from that album really shines in concert, no overdubbing, electronics, just straight up black metal. \n\nThe band does the Dead-Euronymous era songs very well and all is done with amazing technicality. But I actually found the GDOW tracks on this live set to be the most surprising, 'In The Lies Where Upon You Lay' is an all out assault from the band with Maniac doing a clean vocal \"preach\" to the audience with his philosophical statement and comes his usual growl. I always thought that was Maniac's best ability in which he could use clean and raspy vocals in the songs. He does it again in a 'View From Nihil' and 'A Time To Die'. I know many here dislike 'Crystalized Pain In Deconstruction' but this track is really a memorable one for me, that whole almost rap-like part in the beginning is really fucking cool and \"gasp\" original on their part. \n\nI know bm elitists will cry blasphemy but I don't mind when a bm band branches out and tries something a little different while sticking to their roots in the process. ( I absolutely applaud Mayhem for actually trying to go against the grain. Somehow these exact sdame songs didn't work for me on GDOW but when heard on this it just sounds more powerful, direct and unified. I guess the problem with GDOW was the production because had it been done under a 'live' setting that album would have been better received. Too much help from a studio can ruin an album. With 'Live In Marseille' there's no such problem here. It's a funny thing with Mayhem. I find that their studio albums never captured or matched the ferocity of their live gigs and to me that's an essential part of their excellence. I find myself listening more to this album, 'Mediolanum Capta Est', 'Live In Leipzig' and 'Dawn Of The Black Hearts' more than their studio efforts. For Mayhem fans, this is definitely worth getting and since there seems to be only 500 copies I get one soon. It's better than you may want to believe.\n",
        "\nAmong Mayhem's many releases between 1998 and 2001 that can be labelled as \"essentially worthless,\" this live album definitely qualifies as one of the shittier ones. If you're looking to capture the pure energetic essence of the band, pick up 99's Mediolanum Capta Est instead. European Legions suffers from all the symptoms that could possibly make a live CD terrible: bad sound, a rough performance, a short set, and a boring crowd. \n\nIt's easy to see just from listening to the recording that this whole performance was ripped from the mixing board, not the stage. Hellhammer's triggered drums stick out like a sore thumb, and as you would expect, drown out the rest of the band with their sterility. The snare drum doesn't sound bad at all, but the bass and toms sound terrible, maintaining that same goddamned \"click\" that we've heard a million times before. Blasphemer's guitar tone is grating and digitally overdone, and Maniac's vocals, unfortunately for us, come out to the front of the sound mix. As far as Hellhammer's performance goes, not much can be said; it's an \"instant gratification\" scenario, where you'll shit yourself at his technical proficiency and speed, only to later be annoyed at his so-called \"technical flair,\" which is just adding seemingly random fills to the song or playing the song at an absurd pace to the point where the whole band sounds poor.\n\nThe rest of the band aren't on top of things either; Maniac sounds dismal and uninspired, Blasphemer misses a handful of notes and fucks up solos, and Necrobutcher doesn't do much of anything. To add onto a terrible performance, Mayhem only play an 8-song set, which will leave most listeners feeling empty; and the crowd during this performance as almost as dead as the band themselves. You hear a few drunken yells of \"DEATHCRUSH!\" and requests for old material, and some scattered chanting of the band's name. Otherwise, you would think that this crowd fucking hates the band.\n\nHowever, some good aspects do come along. Firstly, the band finish their performance. Yay! But seriously, the pre-production tracks from the then-forthcoming album Grand Declaration of War are pretty cool. Though the production is significantly lower in standard than that of the actual album release, it's interesting to see how differently things were done before the songs were finalized. Some drum parts were done differently, Maniac's patterns and performance were in the evolutionary stages, and Blasphemer tends to layer the guitars in different manners. It's an intriguing look as to how the band evolved from the course of the demo tracks to the recording of the actual album.\n\nIf you want to hear the true fury of Mayhem in a live setting, pick up the aforementioned Mediolanum Capta Est, or Live in Leipzig. Avoid this album unless you're seeking it for collection purposes, and download the pre-production tracks.\n",
        "\nI'm giving this a 50 because even though it's the only studio shit Mayhem did with Dead, once the music gets fast (much of it is fast) all you can hear are the drums and vocals. The drums aren't mixed or mic-ed worth shit and they have way to much reverb. They basically push all of the other instruments out of the mix. It sounds like it was recorded in 20 minutes. No shit. It's awful. On a lighter note, it's wonderful to hear Dead sounding so clean. He doesn't exactly have a sound that's totally of his own, but there's something about his voice that sounds unique to him alone. It's like a black metal vomit, but with a sort of whispering feel and enough conviction to choke a horse. These two songs are a piece of black metal history, but it's kind of sad to listen to. I love Attila, but I would kill to hear Dead sing on \"De Mysteriis...\" That wouldn't make any difference though. In his own words he and what could have been are eternally \"buried by time and dust...\"\n",
        "\nWhether a person loves or loathes this release, there's no denying that it shattered barriers, for better or worse. Mayhem transcended not only their physical past, but also their musical past on this album. Maybe that was the point, though. \"Wolf's Lair Abyss\" showed us that Mayhem was an entirely new band, and most took to that EP rather fondly. But maybe we didn't get the message clearly enough; GDoW is Mayhem's proud proclamation of rising above the hordes of \"kvlt\" black metal to forge something entirely their own that not only set them apart from the rest of BM, but seemed to spawn a revolution.\n\nThe song structures and writing methods on this album are incredibly unpredictable and amorphous. Strange, dissonant guitars swoop in and out of the mix, and are often layered to create a certain apocalyptic ambience. Blasphemer and Hellhammer coincide perfectly to create jagged, unorthodox time signatures and rhythms, as on \"Crystallized Pain in Deconstruction\" or the middle section of \"In the Lies Where upon You Lay.\" It's safe to say that Mayhem use a very technical approach here, even on the simpler songs; For instance, while the second half of, \"View From Nihil, Part I\" may seem to be a straight barrage of blast beats, there are a ton of nuances in the guitar rhythms that make it a challenging listen. I truly believe that Blasphemer composed his most challenging material on this album, both listening-wise and playing-wise.\n\nHowever, the avant-garde nature of the album doesn't stop with just the structures of the songs. There is a high use of electronics here, whether it be the unsettling vocal effects, weird guitar splices and harmonies, or even ominus trip-hop beats. (The latter of which caught a lot of flack from reviewers.) Mayhem have been one of the few bands to correctly utilize these things to work to the advantage of the music, since it aids in creating a war-like, post-apocalypse atmosphere that permeates the whole album. Songs like \"Completion in the Science of Agony\" offer startling, eerie soundscapes with high experimentation while maintaining a degree of brutality. The experimental nature of the album goes even further with Maniac's lyrics and vocal performance. He still uses the gut-wrenching scream that he's become so infamous for, but there are just as many sections on the album that use spoken-word dialogues, synthesized vocals, and and a semi-yell, as seen on \"View From Nihil.\" Lyrically, it may be a bit on the pretentious side, but lives up to the album's name by making references to modern technology and warfare.\n\nGDoW's production is damn near flawless. Blasphemer's guitar tone is icy and seething, but maintains a good amount of clarity; Necrobutcher's bass lines are finally audible on songs such as \"To Daimonion\"; and Hellhammer's drums, even with being totally triggered, are flawless. HH's technical prowess is rivalled by few, as seen on the ripping \"A Time to Die\" or \"In the Lies Where Upon You Lay.\" The mixing job here is incredibly clean without coming off as sparkly or over-produced, which I think was essential in putting forth the aesthetic of the album.\n\nOverall, GDoW is a bit stuck-up and self-indulgent; but if you broke the mold of an entire genre, wouldn't you be the same way? Fans of experimental metal and tech-death alike will enjoy this album, or maybe just people looking for a challenging listen.\n\nFavorite tracks: \"In the Lies Where Upon You Lay\", \"A Time to Die\", \"To Daimonion.\"\n",
        "\nThere seems to be this epidemic among metal bands with putting out sub-par performances as a full-length DVD, and add in some totally unnecessary extras to \"enhance the experience.\" And Mayhem, of course, never being one of the bands you'd expect to release a DVD, fall into this category.\n\nI'll start off with the concert footage itself, which ranges from piss-poor to \"pretty damn good.\" The video quality is surprisingly clear for an underground band, and the camera positions aren't too bad either. Unfortunately, a little too much time is spent on Maniac's goofy ass, and we get to watch him carouse around stage with ridiculous \"corpse paint\" and rather... shall I say \"cockstar\" stage antics? Behind Maniac though, the actual musicians in the band are on top of things. (For the majority, anyway. A few fuck-ups happen, which I'll mention later.) Necrobutcher's bass, while largely inaudible, fills in the dirty bottom end; Blasphemer's guitar acrobatics are in full swing here, and for playing such technical material that *seemed* to be all studio polish, he delivers probably the best aspect of the show on the cuts taken from GDoW. Hellhammer's drums, as you would expect, are triggered to Hell and back. To tell you the truth, the drum sound is pretty damn annoying. Unlike a reasonable trigger sound on album, HH's live triggers are way overdone; the snare drum sounds like a Pepsi can being pounded on, the bass drum virtually has no \"bass\" to it, and the toms have that terrible clicky sound to them. Hellhammer's blast beats are hard to distinguish anyway, because he barely hits the damn things to make the beats clearer. Moreover, the overall sound is pretty bad. Drums and vocals are pushed to the forefront of the mix, and the vocals aren't that great to begin with. It's clear to see that Maniac had a little much to drink before the show; he slurs some lines, falls behind tempo, and even forgets or mixes parts up! (Seen on \"Chainsaw Gutsfuck.\")\n\nHowever, even with sub-par sound and a few sketchy moments, Mayhem manage to pull through a decent set list. Most of the material is focused on the GDoW album, and all the classics are thrown in for the sake of the fans. (The performances of \"Freezing Moon\" and \"From the Dark Past\" here are great.) Some moments seem rushed or forced, such as the rather sloppy and too-damn-fast-for-its-own-good rendition of \"Buried by Time and Dust.\" A few of the older songs have their questionable moments, but for the largest part of the set list, everything comes off alright.\n\nWith Mayhem climbing the ladder of age, there's not much stage movement here. Maniac is... Maniac. He does a few old-school things such as cutting himself on barbed wire and stabbing pig's heads, but his performance isn't great, and his skills as a frontman are questionable. (He does however, throw the pig's head into the audience on \"I am Thy Labyrinth\"... Pretty cool.) Necrobutcher seems to have the most get-up-and-go of all the others, which I find ironic; he doesn't do any great leaps, but he has his little fits of jumping every now and then on the older material. Blasphemer headbangs when he wants to, and when he does, it's only for a matter of seconds at a time.\n\nThe extra material is pretty much throwaway; there are interviews with each member, which aren't interesting at all. (Maybe except for Blasphemer's interview.) The supposed \"backstage footage\" is garbage. I won't even bother with it.\n\nLet it be known that this DVD is only for the most die-hard of Mayhem fans.\n",
        "\nAs much as I am a Mayhem fan, I have to agree with previous contributors that endless repetition of old stand-bys doesn\u2019t exactly smack of artistic integrity. Let\u2019s face it, Mayhem are as slow as a wet week (or year, or \u2026) at releasing new material and they and their label are fairly sure that hungry fans will lunge at yet another version of \u201cFreezing Moon\u201d to fill the gap until the next studio album. I have eight versions of \u201cFreezing Moon\u201d (go on, laugh!) \u2013 nine, if you count the Vader cover on the tribute album \u2013 and I know there are more out there.\n\nHaving said that, this album is not as bad as you might think. I have written elsewhere that it\u2019s probably the best single-album intro to the band you can get, offering a mix of the better songs from both old and new Mayhem. Regarding the studio work of the reformed Mayhem, I have to say that it is generally excellent and a worthy successor to the old \"DMDS\" classics. I know how much flak is fired at \u201cGrand Declaration of War\u201d by devotees of Dead and Euronymous, but I won\u2019t hear a word of it. In fact, if pressed to pick all-time favourite Mayhem tracks I\u2019d have to include \u201cTo Daimonion\u201d and \u201cCrystalized Pain in Deconstruction\u201d alongside \u201cDeathcrush\u201d, \u201cFreezing Moon\u201d and \u201cFrom the Dark Past\u201d.\n\nThe live cuts here are satisfactory, but less than stellar. \u201cMediolanum Capta Est\u201d is the album to get if you want intense \u201cnew Mayhem\u201d live energy. However it\u2019s the stripped back rehearsal versions of key tracks from \u201cGDOW\u201d presented here that prove this disc\u2019s highlight. I have to say I prefer these pre-production efforts, if only slightly, to the official versions. \u201cTo Daimonion\u201d and \u201cCrystalized Pain in Deconstruction\u201d, in particular, have a very tight, live feel about them and impress anyone I\u2019ve played them to.\n\nI was fortunate to pick this disc up second-hand quite cheaply. To my delight, having removed the clip case, I saw the slick was signed by Maniac. The shop knew neither band nor vocalist. My luck.\n",
        "\nThe Freezing Moon / Jihad split with The Meads of Asphodel is one of a few split discs in Mayhem\u2019s official and bootleg discographies. At first sight a seemingly unlikely pairing, the two bands share, to quote The Meads\u2019 website, a \u201cBlack Metal spine\u201d, in spite of their very different tastes in casual wear.\n\nThere won\u2019t be much argument that the two Mayhem tracks, featuring the \u201cclassic\u201d Dead / Euronymous / Necrobutcher / Hellhammer lineup, represent the epitome of Norwegian black metal. The production is minimal and swampy and the music chilling and supremely aggressive. Of all the available studio and live recordings of \u201cFreezing Moon\u201d, that offered here must surely stand as the definitive version. Appropriately Fenriz chose it to represent Mayhem on his excellent anthology of \u201cold school\u201d black metal. Dead\u2019s asphyxiated rasp, drenched in reverb, is both startling and arresting. \u201cCarnage\u201d, while less impressive a composition, is just as ferocious and captures the players at their ripping best.\n\nThe other prominent feature of \u201cFreezing Moon\u201d is the guitar solo, one of the very few in Mayhem\u2019s entire catalog. And what a great solo it is! With not a blues lick in sight, this appropriately short highlight demonstrates how much Euronymous had developed as a player from the drunken slush of the band\u2019s earliest efforts to 1990. The tremulous melody snakes its way over sixteen bars, building the icy tension to a spine-tingling climax. It\u2019s a fitting tribute to his predecessor that Blasphemer plays this solo virtually note for note (with the occasional extemporization) in live performance. Just for the record my favourite version of the solo (I have eight Mayhem performances of the song) is Blasphemer\u2019s break featured on \u201cMediolanum Capta Est\u201d.\n\nWhat grabs the attention initially with The Meads\u2019 tracks is the liberal use of samples and sound effects. The band describes its music as a \u201cunique myriad of colliding musical styles tethered to a Black Metal spine.\u201d It\u2019s an accurate enough description. But while Mayhem\u2019s two tracks can be seen as pure Norwegian black metal energy, The Meads of Asphodel\u2019s music doesn\u2019t so much attack as lollop along in an almost folky manner, reminiscent of Viking metal. The saturated guitars and death-grind vocals don\u2019t even come close to creating the black metal chill of Mayhem. It\u2019s engaging, entertaining stuff, but all too often borders on the cheesy. You get the feeling that the black metal elements have been deliberately given a back seat to the more theatrical aspects of the production.\n\nAnd it is quite a production. Spoken word snippets, extracts from country music and Carl Orff, splattering machine gun fire, explosions and rumbling tanks all combine to set the scene of total carnage. The band\u2019s clear intention is to pour scorn on religious extremism \u2013 in this case the fundamentalist Islamic jihad \u2013 and its mission to kill indiscriminately in the name of God. The message is clearly and cleverly conveyed. Whether the music stands up without all the theatrical trappings, however, is a matter of opinion. In terms of carnage, it has to be said, Mayhem achieves it brilliantly without resorting to a catalog of sound effects.\n\n100% for Mayhem, 70% for The Meads of Asphodel. A total mark of 85%.\n",
        "\nI couldn\u2019t sit idly by and leave just one review (as good as it is) representing this excellent live album.\n\n\u201cMayhem\u201d and \u201cexcellent\u201d, according to friends of mine, don\u2019t belong in the same sentence. How is it, they wonder, that someone like me who enjoys jazz, folk and world music can listen to this stuff. Mayhem first captured my attention simply through their incomparable savagery. Some bands might be louder, spit more blood and create gruesome video clips but for sheer musical axe-wielding bloodlust, Mayhem are the masters.\n\n\u201cLive in Leipzig\u201d is one of my top ten favourite albums of all time, and the only metal album. It\u2019s not the easiest to listen to compared with, for example, DMDS, but it is both an amazing document of a concert and the best example of a band that plays texture. That\u2019s how I think of Mayhem. It\u2019s not about songs as such, more about texture. It\u2019s like a landscape. Go play Burzum\u2019s \u201cHvis Lyset Tar Oss\u201d and tell me if that album could have been recorded anywhere other than Norway. \u201cLeipzig\u201d is less panoramic but it\u2019s a landscape nonetheless, a scene of barren devastation celebrating the stark beauty of decay and detritus. It\u2019s black beauty in its most visceral, undiluted form.\n\n\u201cMCE\u201d, if anything, is even more about texture, more abstract. The first tracks are nearly all Hellhammer\u2019s drums, the bass and guitar are mixed so low. The balance improves as the show progresses but the standout feature for me is Maniac\u2019s voice. I tire of all the critics who pan Maniac as a poor substitute for Dead. The two vocalists are worlds apart in everything but quality. Imagine \u201cWolf\u2019s Lair Abyss\u201d with either Attila or Dead at the mic. Forget it. Maniac\u2019s throat-ripping vocals dominate \u201cMCE\u201d throughout, his stentorian pronouncements between the tracks icing the cake.\n\nNeither the Leipzig nor Milan gigs are for the faint-hearted \u2026 which means, if you\u2019re a Mayhem fan, you will already have this album.\n",
        "\nMayhem are arguably the most prolific Norwegian BM band in history. We all know their stories of murder, arson, suicides etc. Can they live up to the hype with the music, the thing that counts the most? We will see...\n\nWell, here it is. The album that was 5 years in the making and delayed because of various reasons. When you first listen to this you will feel the cold coming through your speakers and the pure aggression of the riffs and drums. Euronymous was no slouch when it came to creating riffs that were from the depths of hell and songs like Freezing Moon and the title track are just that. Basically, when you listen to this album, you will understand where the band was coming from when writing and recording it. It really is something that not only the band, but Euronymous himself can be proud of and I'm sure they are. At the same time though, listening to this is emotional, due to the murder of Euronymous by Cunt Grishnack (yes I said it.) I have no love for Varg and he should be tortured to death for what he did. Ok, enough of that, back to the music.\n\nThe drums are at times insanely fast and other times are mid paced and full of intricate little fills, although Hellhammer is ten times better now than he was back when this was recorded. The vocals are actually my second favorite part of this record, next to the riffs, due to Attila's wonderful performance. We all have our favorite Mayhem vocalist: Dead, Maniac or Attila. I love Dead but Attila is just so much more versatile. He can scream but he also adds so much depth to the songs vocal wise with his weird, almost chant like vocal assault. He even adds some very eerie operatic singing to the title track. \n\nThe bass is, despite the story, still in tact and mixed in very well. During songs like Life Eternal the bass is doing a very cool little part that is damn catchy. Varg did a good job. Having listened to so much old Mayhem, at times I forget it's Varg and think Necrobutcher is doing the bass. Either way it still sounds great.\n\nWhen it is all said and done, this album is a very fitting testament to the enduring legacy of Euronymous, arguably the godfather of Norwegian BM. I know Euronymous is proud of this record and its lasting impact on the scene today. Hell, even Varg has said this is the one BM album he would take with him to a deserted island so it is obviously a classic slab of BM infamy. In closing, well there is only one thing I can say...\n\nHAIL EURONYMOUS!\n",
        "\nBrutal, relentless, uncompromising Mayhem! \u2018Chimera\u2019 lives up to the tradition.\n\n\u2018Grand Declaration of War\u2019, the band\u2019s first full-length after its late-Nineties reformation, disappointed and even angered many fans of the \u2018old\u2019 Mayhem who hoped for something like \u2018DMDS 2\u2019. This would have been ridiculous without Euronymous and Dead. Instead Mayhem took the bold move, with newly-included Blasphemer and Maniac, into progressive territory with \u2018GDOW\u2019, a modern metal masterpiece. The negative press and poor sales generated by \u2018GDOW\u2019, however, saw Mayhem turn back to the brutal assault of the band\u2019s first post-reformation disc, the \u2018Wolf\u2019s Lair Abyss\u2019 EP, as inspiration for \u2018Chimera\u2019.\n\nNow, it\u2019s said, that band is disappointed with \u2018Chimera\u2019. The press and sales have been no better than the last album\u2019s. So will \u2018Ordo Ab Chao\u2019 see a return to \u2018GDOW\u2019 experimentalism?\n\n\u2018Chimera\u2019 is far from rubbish, whatever you\u2019ve heard. It\u2019s probably the most homogenous, evenly balanced album the band has produced. The old bass-less, grating \u2018Leipzig\u2019 style is gone for ever, but the searing ferocity remains. On \u2018Chimera\u2019, you can even hear Necrobutcher\u2019s bass! In fact, it sticks out like the proverbials on several tracks. Blasphemer and Hellhammer have conjoined to create the most surgically precise attack ever. Maniac has morphed the asphyxiated black metal vocal idiom into his own unique style. His last Mayhem album, this may be his best. No, he\u2019s not Dead. Get over it! But neither was Dead anything like Maniac. Each brought his unique skill to the Mayhem mic and the music is the better for it.\n\nTo me, Mayhem is about texture. Poseur guitar solos, vocal clich\u00e9s and the other mannerisms of commercial metal are completely absent. Mayhem is about creating a dense, visceral energy that invades your senses. It\u2019s not about songs as such. To enjoy Mayhem, you just go with the flow. Viewed this way, \u2018Chimera\u2019 is a worthy continuation of the Mayhem tradition.\n\nWhere \u2018Ordo Ab Chao\u2019 will lead, we can only guess.\n",
        "\nThese guys started that whole Black Metal scene with this?! This dosen't sound like anything else from that scene really, or anything else Mayhem did as a matter of fact. Lucky for us! This is quite on the grim and kvlt side of things, but at least it has riffs. As mentioned before, the production blows ass, but all good Black Metal had shitty production. Hellhammer, Venom, Bathory, anybody? Oh, and for you that say Venom isn't Black Metal, Mayhem pretty much retaliates with a \"Fuck yes they are!\" as they cover \"Witching Hour\". The singer sounds like a shrieky Quorthon, although high pitched and more piercing, with his vocals reverbed out and pushed to the back. The guitar tone is pretty monsterous, and the drummer sounds like he's playing on cardboard. But hey, it works....although the drummer sounds like he dosen't even know what he's doing half the time.\n\nWe start of with an intro that is like marching snare drums, which is rather pointless. \"Deathcrush\" is pretty necro. Full of Death/Thrash riffs going between midpaced and fast, with some pretty over the top vocals. It's pretty repetitive, but it took me about 5 listens to realize that they were repeating parts, so I guess that's okay. \"Chainsaw Gutsfuck\" is a midpaced song with lots of nice riffs. It also shows that the bass is a very important part of this band. It's distorted much like Motorhead, and keeps the low end nice and thick. At one point it sounds like the drummer is doing blastbeats, but I honestly think he was just fucking around. Next is \"Witching Hour\". the most covered Venom song. Suprizingly it's pretty well done, although it's sped up about three times faster and the whole solo section that was really cool in the orginal isn't there. It's still quite a cool cover. \"Necrolust\" is easily the best thing this band ever did (other than killing themselves). Awesome Thrashy riffs and a very cool vocal pattern. \"Weird Manheim\" is a little interlude that sounds like an out of tune piano that leads into \"Pure Fucking Armageddon\", and holy shit! Listen to that first riff. Awesome Thrash right there. Then we go into some Death metal sounding stuff, but the drums kind of bury it. Then, before you know it.....it's over. I found the outro to be quite brutal, kvlt, and necro.\n\nThis sounds like a mixture of Bathory's \"The Return\" and \"Scream Bloody Gore\". It sounds different than the rest of this band's output, and that's a good thing! If you like Black Metal like Hellhammer, without keyboards, without grind-esque drumming, and most importantly with RIFFS. This is for you. RECOMMENDED.\n",
        "\nNo matter what comes of Mayhem in the end or what they go on to produce in the future, they will no doubt be a band who goes down in history as one of the most contoversial bands that has ever graced this planet and this album will remain a vocal point in Black Metal's history. We all know the events leading up to the release of the debut full-length album \"De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\" therefore there is simply no need to dwelve into those matters which occured over a decade ago once again. This album is a landmark in Black Metal history and consisted of one of the most promising line-ups that has ever existed up until this very day. Consisting of eight blasphemous tracks, this album totals at just over forty-five minutes. \n\nFirst, this album has a truly unique production. It captures the sound of instruments brilliantly. The production enhances the general feel of the music, which is notoriously cold, grim and blasphemous. Songs are primitive and chaotic in sound. Repetitive riffs, blast beats and haunting screams from Attila are imperative to Mayhem, especially the vocals. Attila creates almost operatic like vocals at times to portray the grim sound Mayhem are trying to create. The riffs create an ambient backdrop to the music and enhance the cold feeling atmosphere that the production and instruments have laid out. A highly melodic and ambient piece is what is created out of this. Connotations of death, destruction and violent chaos are the obvious themes running throughout Mayhem's music, and given the past history of the band its quite fitting. Dead's lyrical guidance is obvious on this album. Lyrically it suits the music perfectly and adds to that grim and cold sense of feeling that Mayhem portray through their music. Instruments are particularly well performed, controlled and repetitive throughout to create that desired affect on the audience. Tempos range from mid-paced to a much faster pace. Music is generally simplistic, but highly affective. A highly aggressive album packed with lots of punch and chilling atmosphere. There are slight variations in riffs throughout, but hardly at all. Guitars are generally highly distorted and have a fuzzy affect. Hellhammer uses a lot of double bass throughout the album, this intensifies the music. At times this can lack in diversity, but as with a lot of Black Metal it's not meant to be diverse, but instead simplistic and true to the roots of the genre. \n\nHightlights include: Freezing Moon, Pagan Fears and the title track.\n",
        "\n2000's Grand Declaration Of War signifies Maniac's tentative return to full time recording with Mayhem. The band's infamously volatile lineup is mirrored by the sheer unpredictability of this album, a composition with roots in black metal but with aspirations to something far grander.\n\nThere seems to be a climate in the black metal scene that causes key artists to transgress and produce recordings that are musically contradictory to the primitive nature of their past output. Recent avant-garde work from the likes of Arcturus, Burzum, Samael and Ulver are among the many examples of this. Mayhem could easily have traced a similar route with this piece of 'Post-Black Metal', but they can be commended for their retention of the brutal elements of their earlier works.\n\nMuch like Akercocke's latest output, they break the mould by introducing sprawling progressive elements into the nihilistic blast. While black metal is always physically demanding, this album also manages to engage the listener on a mental level. The tracks are still riddled with the standard BM rasps, but the band's inclusion of militant speeches and rousing narration conveys their intentions like never before. The military vibe of their new style is further enhanced by Hellhammer's sharp insistent drumming, tight prog-tinged riffing and occasional industrial samples.\nTheir disregard for traditional song structure is still present and is manifested this time around by the epic nature of the songs. This could be seen as a drawback as the music is very much album-oriented and not very accessible (puzzling stretches of silence occupy a number of tracks). However, a clinically balanced and tight production prevents its descent into a tangle of chaos.\n\nLyrically, the album attacks the herd mentality that the church represents, and it seems apt that Mayhem are very much going against the grain themselves with this album. Groundbreaking, sprawling nihilism for those with good attention spans.\n",
        "\nI picked up this DVD because it seemed like a good idea at the time. It cost me $24.99 CDN. It was not worth it. \n\nWith that out of the way, the DVD itself presents an assortment of annoyances as soon as one pops it in, most notably, an unreasonably long unskippable intro track that shows a dozen shots of Maniac with the intro of GDOW playing. There is little in the way of special features, a serious piss-off when the package adveristed 'band interviews' that turned out being 10 minutes of useless jabber.\n\nThe concert itself is not terrible, although they do miss a few key Mayhem classics (Funeral Fog, Necrolust, Ancient Skin). Production is focused on the higher ranges of Maniac's vocals, Blasphemer's tremolo picking and Hellhammer's relentless drum pounding, which sometimes leaves Necrobutcher's bass in the dust. Speaking of the drums, they are seriously triggered and sound kinda lame and fake next to the album production. The band do however tear through several songs with ease, my favourites being Freezing Moon, Symbols of Bloodswords and Carnage. Maniac's vocals seriously butcher some of this stuff, especially when I could just play Live in Leipzig to hear Dead actually put down worthy vocals.\n\nManiac also tries some stage antics, some of which are better than others. His barbed wire self-mutalation is amusing, but nowhere near as brutal as the things Dead used to do. oy. He also tosses the infamous pig's head into the crowd, as well as carries it around on a large knife...whatever. His face paint is terrible, but the rest of the band appear to be in their own mindsets and do their thing admirably while Maniac parades around the stage.\n\nDespite this seemingly critical pan of the DVD, most of the concert is pretty enjoyable, but it is seriously overpriced for something that probably took 20 minutes to put together.\n",
        "\nAn album with two separate bands, the established Mayhem and the up and coming Meads of Asphdel. This is a very interesting split. The Meads of Asphodel definitely steal the show, a rather tough act considering Mayhem is virtually a black metal monolith. Onto the album...\n\nThe Meads of Asphodel take the first portion of the split, their side entitled \"Jihad\". The intro track definitely sets the mood, along with the beginning of \"The Grisly Din of Killing Steel\". The intros are very Middle Eastern sounding, with some form of Arabic talking, missiles launching, church organs, and something that sounds like knives sliding off of each other. The music starts off with a killer riff, some awesome drumming, and very rough vocals. There are some reallly eerie keyboard sounds here, with a very melodic keyboard/piano piece over top. A really cool, almost techno drum sound is used towards the middle, with some \"O Fortuna\" symphonics. From the description of the first 3 minutes of the first music track, one can tell this isn't your typical black metal band. The song then almost sounds like the tape is slowing down, only to kick into another great riff. The style here is a mid-pace black metal, with chunky riffing, raw vocals, and relatively speedy drumming.\n\nThe production for the Meads of Asphodel is not the greatest, but come on, this is black metal, and the production rarely is. The guitars, like I mentioned earlier, are very chunky, and all of the riffs seem to have very good placement. The vocals are rather low in the mix, but it works well with his style of singing. His vocals are both raw and rough, but still quite understandable, to the trained ear. The drums are really good the whole way through, with some rather inventive rolls and fills. The keyboards are very eerie, and set a really cool tone (anybody ever play Shivers?). The music definitely has a middle eastern feel to it at parts, especially the sound samples. Merging two distinct styles, black metal and traditional middle eastern sounds is not done easily (Melechesh), but Meads of Asphodel pull it off very well.\n\nEach track is outstanding. Better production would not have hurt this release at all, but it's still awesome. The lyrical concepts are really cool, especially on \"Another God, Another Place\". The focus is on tolerance of religions, especially the anti-tolerance stance Christian religions take towards other religions. The line \"You think God only belongs to you, he doesn't. God is not an Israelite\" definitely gets the general theme of Jihad across. Speaking of \"Another God, Another Place\", there is an amazing section that completely fuses middle eastern sounds with palm muting and heavy drumming. An outstanding section!\n\nThe album then goes into an interlude track, that is very realistic and eerie at the same time. It sounds very warlike, almost like CNN's coverage of issues in the middle east, and it ends with an awesome radio clip of \"this land was made for you and me.\" It definitely helps highlight the sarcasm that is throughout much of Jihad's lyrics, as well as other releases from Meads of Asphodel. The last track for Meads of Asphodel is a cover of Hawkwind's \"Assassins of Allah\". The song is very stripped down, given raw vocals, and a lot of palm muting. Apparently the record label wanted more material for the CD issue of this album, so Meads of Asphodel went through this one fairly well. There's definitely more of the MIddle Eastern feel to it, and it fits very nicely along the other tracks. Overall, an amazing effort from Meads of Asphodel.\n\nFollowing Jihad is Mayhem's \"Freezing Moon\". It definitely would be difficult for any band to follow such an outstanding effort, even for Mayhem. These tracks are from the Dead era of Mayhem. The production is not good at all; the drums and bass are too high, the guitars are very hard to hear, and the vocals almost get lost in the mix.\n\nThe aggression on these two tracks (\"Carnage\" and \"Freezing Moon\") is exceptional, the playing (what I can hear of it) is very well done, and there are some really good high speed solos mixed in. I find it hard to listen to these two tracks, especially right after Jihad. The track \"Carnage\" is mostly fast riffing, the same drum beat, and a lot of speed, with cool solos. \"Freezing Moon\" is a little more drawn out, until about the two minute mark. Once again it's very fast drumming, fast riffing, and tortured vocals. There is a really cool slowed down part, with a very thrashy sounding solo over the top, where you can actually hear the guitars fairly well.\n\nMayhem's side is played very well, but like Meads of Asphodel, better production definitely would not hurt. Overall, Meads of Asphodel steals the show, and leaves Mayhem miles behind. Every track on this album is well written, and played well, but the originallity of the Meads of Asphodel is astonishing, and the mixture of Middle Eastern infuences won me over instantaneously. The high scores I give this album are mostly for the Meads of Asphodel. Mayhem played well, but just not to the level that they are capable of. Well done Meads of Asphodel! Mayhem recieved a decent score, simply because the musicanship and essentiality of this recording to Mayhem fans.\n\nRecommended to black metal fans. All Mayhem fans should own this. Meads of Asphodel are recommnded to fans of Nile, Melechesh, and Orphaned Land, simply for the fusion of Middle Eastern elements. Also anyone looking for black metal that is outside of the box!\n\nJihad - 98%\nMayhem - 87%\nthe scores were then averaged out... rounding up.\n",
        "\n...and I suppose that's what they were going for. The vocals were described perfectly as sounding like \"an operatic popeye,\" and they're rather weak, but vocals are never a large part of a black metal production. Yes, as other suggested, the guitars are a tad repetitive, but isn't that what made Varg's \"ambient black metal\" so wonderful? Except, in this case, rather than expressing loneliness or hatred, it's simply eerie darkness.\n\nI would go to the trouble I usually do to write a track-by-track review, but I don't think it was Mayhem's intent for you to listen to certain tracks more than others. It seems to be instead a work that you should listen to as a whole album, not skipping any tracks. This is probably because of the large emphasis on atmosphere in this album, like in most black metal. The band never loses focus on this atmosphere, but detracts with constant, hammering drumming that loses its effect after the first few tracks.\n\nThis album is enjoyable in the sense that it creates a dark atmosphere, and I don't think that the repetition detracts from the guitar lines. What stopped this album from being spoiled for me was all the negative reviews I had read prior to listening to it. So begin listening with not expectations at all, and you will be very pleased with what you find. I highly recommend this for black metal fans, or just fans of atmospheric music.\n",
        "\nThe other day, I decided I would buy a cd on a whim. I was at an FYE store and I was browsing the metal section when I came across Mayhem's \"Grand Declaration of War\", so I scanned it and listened to the sound samples. Having never heard anything by Mayhem before, I was surprised that it was not true black metal, like I had heard that they were. It sounded rather impressive, yet at the same time ... very weird. I noticed, looking at the case, that the booklet for the cd was only one page, so I was not expecting lyrics or anything special. Even though the case was not well-done, I bought it.\n\nUpon my first listen I seemed to focus upon the things I found to be original and impressive on the album. To name a few: the technical drumming, the fret-searing guitar work, the abrupt tempo changes, the experimentation, and the overall feel of the album. This cd sounds like nothing I have heard before. It IS black metal, but at the same time, it isn't. I took the cd out of my cd player with the impression that I had bought a cd that I would only listen to occasionally.\n\nThe next day I listened to it upon awakening. This time around, it seemed as though all of the things I found to be impressed by the last listen were overpowered by the things that are out of the ordinary, and in a sense, unnecessary. To name them: the clean vocals sound (to me) as though he is just yelling triumphantly, he doesn't seem like he knows english very well and it sounds like he is reading from a teleprompter, so it is an aquired taste. \"Completion In Science of Agony\" is a very long, drawn-out song that seems to go on forever, without much change at all. It gets boring over time and I think the cd would have been better without it. \"A BloodSword and a Colder Sun\" is the electronic/ ambient song that most people hate, I myself agree, but it is gloomy and dark, so it fits the album. Occasionally it is an alright listen, so it belongs on the cd. \n\nAfter those two listens I seemed to enjoy everything about the album. The vocals grew on me, and now occasionally crave them. \"Completion In Science of Agony\" is easily skipped, and \"A BloodSword and a Colder Sun\" is a good song to listen to occasionally. The fact that the lyrics are not enclosed in the case bothered me at first, but the internet solved that problem for me. I gave the album an 89 because: the sung/spoken vocals are quite un-nerving to the un-trained, and the album gets boring on tracks 6-9.\n\nOverall, I do recomend this album to anyone who is looking to broaden their landscape of musical taste. If you do not have an open mind, or only like true black metal, then you should probably steer clear.\n\nFavorite songs: \"A Time to Die\" and \"To Daimonion\"\n",
        "\nDid you ever made a declaration of love? How about a declaration of hate? A declaration of hate adressed to the whole humanity? Why am I saying this? Because this album is the most eloquent acoustic expression of hate, anger and misanthropy.Some of you are gonna tell me that I should look for the \"most hatefull\" album in discographies of bands like Napalm Death, Sepultura, Suffocation or Slayer.While, to those bands, the hate is the violent decomposure of violence, to Mayhem, it appears as a more intimate feeling. I was knocked down when I first listened to this album. The 4 songs are like a hurricane...maybe the only hurricane in black-metal.\nI haven't sensed so much anger spitted in humanity's face than in that short interlude from Ancient Skin, when Maniac declares with profetic, clean voice \"I've captured the moment given, I denied the sickening love, turned to the purity of anger\" This sounds very Nietzsche-like (\"humanity is sick with this unhealthy peace\").\nAl the 4 songs have an incredible weight, given by the intensity of the riffs and the heavy, very good drumming and a speed unexlored before, even by Mayhem. There is one song, Ancient Skin, in wich the band says \"This is who we are\". The song starts very fast, and a feeling of \"deja-vu\" takes place, but, after 1 minute, Hellhammer rises the tempo of the drumming, the speed reaches an unexpected high level, simultaneously with the transition to the very dense web of riffs (typical to this Wolf's Lair Abyss), preparing for Maniac's entrance. His part consist of the most violent vocals ever recorded on a black metal album.\nThis album fascinated me since the first audition. The intro - the breathing of a septic body and the trumpets annnouncing a new Era (in black metal), followed by the unleashing of high speed and immense brutallity and a very good instrumental technique. \nThis is the best black metal album ever made...\n",
        "\nEverybody in the black metal scene knows the story of Mayhem so I won't even bother retelling it. Aside from being one of the most bootlegged albums in metal history, Dawn of the Black Hearts is a terrific slab of legendary black metal with an incredible performance by Dead, easily Mayhem's best vocalist in my opinion. \n\nThe highlight of the album is definately the live performance in Sarpsburg, Norway, 1990. This part of the entire record has the best and most listenable production which is not saying by any means that it is clear because Dawn of the Black Hearts is as raw as it gets. However the songs played are mostly classics including \"Freezing Moon,\" \"Carnage,\" \"Funeral Fog,\" and \"Pure Fucking Armageddon.\" The songs relentlessly slay listeners as the legendary line-up plays their instruments like they're possessed. Dead's vocals are so aggressive and work perfectly with Euronymous' unique guitar playing. Hellhammer's drumming isn't as polished as what he does with the band today but it works to convey the atmosphere of the music, playing more primitively than the more mechanical sound that is found on newer albums like Chimera. \n\nIt is practically to impossible to hear anything on the next live performance on the album, taking place in Lillehammer, Norway in 1986. The sound is not really in the normal raw black metal vein, a better way to describe it is muffled. The tracks sound more like creepy atmospheric music that lead up to an actual song. The vocals are completely different, not even having that classic black metal rasp yet. Doing a cover of Venom's \"Black Metal\", it is interesting to see how the band evolved as time went on and became the powerhouse that they remain up to this day. \n\nNext comes the Pure Fucking Armageddon demo which originally came on tape with one side saying \"Fuck\" and another saying \"Off.\" Once more the band displays their classics that have been heard in so many different ways and versions. However, this demo is one of the first original versions of the songs and is recorded rawer than ever, almost hiding the vocals completely. Nonetheless, those who enjoy the great Mayhem classics should enjoy this. It is the basis of so much raw primitive black metal that has exploded in the scene today. Another cover of Venom's \"Black Metal\" is on the demo, played as a \"total death version,\" which basically means really aggressively. \n\nIf you are a black metal fanatic like me, getting this album is mandatory. It is a testiment of Norwegian black metal in its prime that not only serves as great atmospheric music, but a part of black metal history as well. Also, if you own Mayhem's 1990 Rehersal tape, you know what to expect from Dead's vocal performance and Euronymous' shattering guitar playing. Without this album, there is a huge gap in your black metal collection.\n",
        "\n\u201cDe Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\u201d is damn fine album, but it isn't exactly the best black metal album ever. The album contains Mayhem's fourth lineup change. This time replacing the now six feet under Dead with Attila. I do have to give Dead some credit though; he was the one that wrote the lyrics for this release. So how does this album fair? It fairs pretty good. Which mind you are a few steps below, \"This is the greatest black metal album ever!\u201d\n\nMany of the Mayhem classics that you've come to love and obsess over are here. Freezing Moon, Funeral Fog, and From the Dark Past just to name a few. The production is far better than the Promo 1987 demo. Some of you may have remember my review for it. Turns out it was a bootleg containing the only two studio tracks by Dead. Enough about the bootleg though. The lineup on this album may well in fact be Mayhem's best lineup. I almost hate to say this but in some aspects Attila was a lot better than Dead: more on that later. \n\nThe guitar riffs on this album done by Euronymous are pretty decent, however despite popular misconception Euronymous was not the great black metal guitar player that a lot of people made him out to be. The riffs he played were fairly simple, and in rare cases he would make use of the scales. It also appears that Euro was big fan of power chords. Normally this method of guitar playing would not garner anyone the award of the Guitar God. Euronymous does manage to play these simple riffs extremely fast, and switch from riff to riff on the fly which does require talent. His best guitar works happen to be on Freezing Moon, Funeral Fog, De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas, and From the Dark Past. The riffs on these songs are very catchy and hard to get out of my head, a definite plus. Unfortunately the guitar riffs for the other songs don't fair as well. Euronymous - 75/100 \n\nThe bass lines and bass riffs for the album provided by Varg \"I'm Killing Euronymous\" Vikernese are also catchy, and in a rare case some of the bass lines are actually memorable. When that happens with most metal albums it's considered surprising; when it happens with a black metal band it's almost enough to faint over.. Unlike, Euronymous though, Varg's bass playing never succeeds in actually making it front in center ahead of Euronymous's guitar playing. Part of the reason for this is because the bass was turned down for personal reasons. This is a shame, since in more than few cases the guitar riffs are not exactly that great and the drums become boring after a while. Varg - 85/100\n\nNext up is the drumming brought to you in part by Hell-\"I'm the normal one of the band\" hammer. The thunderous, artillery style drumming I've come to love from the Promo 1987 bootleg is back. This time mixed with some clearer production drum lines. Hellhammer manages to keep the pace and rhythm of the whole album which is very fast and loud. At times it seems that Hellhammer has to steal the spotlight from Euronymous. Which is a lot of times, it simply gets tiring after awhile. Hellhammer - 80/100 \n\nAt last the vocals provided by Attila are the best thing on this album. Earlier in the review I had mentioned that Attila's vocals are better than Dead's vocals. Here is why; Attila manages to change his vocals around in a theatrical sort of way. This brings out the full atmosphere of the album and almost makes it into an event. His singing, grunts, shrieks, screams, chants, yells and growls are all very damn good on this record; especially on \"Freezing Moon\" \"Funeral Fog\" and the title track. Dead's vocals on the other hand tended to remain within the same range. He sounded like a man shrieking while being tortured by demons in the depths of Hell. It gets boring after a while. Attila - 100/100 \n\n\u201cDe Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\u201d may be well in fact Mayhem's best studio album to date. The true Mayhem fans will already own this album, but for the new fans that are just now dipping their feet into the Mayhem pool they should skip over the newest releases with Maniac on vocals and pick this one up instead. Don't expect perfection though. Overall 85/100\n",
        "\nThis early Mayhem-demo compilation is probably the worst demo-tape I have ever heard! This contains both Pure Fucking Armageddon-rehearsal tape and Voice of a tortured skull-demo tape compiled on the sides \"Fuck\" and \"Off\"... The general sound on both demos are terrible and makes Deathcrush sound like a technical masterpiece. Vocals are horrible, and they are closer to death/grind vocals than black metal vocals.\n\nWhat about the line-up? The only member who plays in Mayhem today is the bassist Necrobutcher. We all know what happened to Euronymous, who is this time also handling vocals. There is this guy called Manheim on drums, so no Hellhammer yet.\n\nThe \"intro\" piece in the start of \"Voice of tortured skull\" is awful. I am not sure is it guitar or some malfunction on the tape. Whatever it is, it gives me a fuckin' headache! There are some screams and various other voices through the song. On \"Carnage\" there aren't so many creaks as on the first song, but the vocals are even worse. They sound like that they are recorded with rags in the mouth and then scratched the tape with the screwdriver. Only the lowest groans are on the track. \"Ghoul\" is a bit clearer but there are no improvements on the vocals. Mayhem knew what they were doing. True Black Metal. And what bands created it? Venom perhaps? That is why Mayhem makes \"the tribute to the gods\" by covering Venom. They chosen \"Black Metal\". Perfect song, Mayhem knew it. When I first heard this, I did not even recognized it as a Venom song. Mayhem boosts it's speed to the maximum, and there are no vocals on the track (Yeah!), but the pauses on the track sound like the band stops playing, but then suddenly starts again. The sound is a bit clearer on this track, but this pleasure is very short. The title track returns to the pure noise with suffocated vocals. It's the last song on the \"Fuck\"-side.\n\nThe \"Off\"-side, or actually \"Pure Fucking Armageddon\" is slightly better than the \"Fuck\"-side. Sounds are better and there are no vocals! At least I did not heard them. \"Mayhem\" is an odd individual to be an intro track. There are some strange noises including various voices created by drums and some kind of talking. It seems that these guys are having a good time. Maybe drunken sincerity? It ends suddenly and the compilation's better version of \"Ghoul\" starts. Now you can even have some kind of sense about it! \"Ghoul\" is not a bad song, it just sounded like one on the \"Fuck\"-side. \"Pure fucking Armageddon\" and \"Carnage\" are both here with the better versions. But it does not mean that they still sound well. They still sound shitty.\n\nThis demo is available for download at their official web site. No-one should not buy this! It's only a waste of money. If you can even find this...\n",
        "\nNo offense to retarded children, but that's what Maniac sounds like on this CD.\n\nThe two songs on this album are good instrumentaly wise. Blasphemer does an excellent job with the guitar riffs. He's almost as good as Euronymous, but not quite. Still the guitar work is catchy, melodic, and fits the tone of the music. \n\nThe bass riffs are actually distinguishable on this demo, and Necrobutcher does a fine job on this album. \n\nThe drums are on tempo, and very good. However after listening to the \"Promo 1987\" album I can't help feel but a bit disappointed. The drumming on this single does not have the thundering feel that the Promo 1987 had. Hell Hammer does make good use of using 16th bassline notes, adding the cymbol in during regular intervals.\n\nThen the downfall comes; the vocals. Normally I have an open mind about vocals, but this is what Maniac sounds like; he sounds like a fucking retarded child throwing a temper tantrum because he couldn't buy a toy. Seriously, I could go to a local Wal Mart; record a child having a temper tantrum; replace Maniacs vocals with that sound; and no one would be none the wiser.\n\nIf vocals make the album for you and you despise Maniac then avoid this album at all costs. If vocals are not a factor for you, but you hate Maniac then download the album. If you are a huge fan of Maniac then go ahead and buy the album.\n",
        "\nChange may not always be welcomed from veteran fans of any band, but let\u2019s face it \u2013 we should not live in the past. Generally, any good band will make an attempt to change their sound in order to not piss everyone off with repetitive aspects. The follow up to the very confusing and experimental Grand Declaration of War manages to improve upon what many fans considered to be a musical disaster for such a legendary band. Well, get ready for something a little different.\n\nThis album kicks ass in unimaginable ways with the precise drumming, thick and sluggish bass, crunchy guitars, and harsh growls with the occasional snarls. All of the songs are especially fast and pack quite a punch. In each power-swelling song you get to hear a great combination of fast and melodic chunk riffs as well as melodious and cohesive tremolo work. Eat your heart out, Euronymous.\n\nThere is a solid new approach for Mayhem in the production department...all of the sound is crystal clear. Part of me wishes that Mayhem would have incorporated a bit more of an unbridled feel of \u2018De Mysteriis\u2026\u2019in the production, but this manages to bring something different to the table. The obvious upside to good production is that you can hear more of every instrument and it\u2019s ensured that no instrument will dominate over the sound of another. Maniac has altered his designated vocal style again; instead of guttural and vomit inducing shrieks and screams, we get more of a higher pitched growl and snarl (a change for the better, I say). A lot of people despise Maniac, but I happen to like him for the fact that he has a very distinct vocal sound and doesn\u2019t copy the style of the typical black metal singer.\n\nFor once the bass gets a little more attention - a good example would be the nice little meaty sounding bass solos performed by Necrobutcher in the song \u201cImpious Devious Leper Lord\u201d. That is one hypnotic headbanging riff, and anywhere this album goes, Necrobutcher takes the stand to ensure that the music smashes the weak with the power of a comet and gives it the extra meaty taste. As usual, Hellhammer takes his standard position on the kit and delivers nothing short of an amazing performance. Hellhammer should consider becoming a lumberjack\u2026he could even replace the use of the chainsaw in the business. Either that or he should become a butcher \u2013 he would save the work force countless hours of slaughter.\n\nBlasphemer, of course, is on track with the skin tearing melodies and luster filled rhythm. There are some pretty cool melodies conjured by Blasphemer (My Death, You Must Fall), but of course, his writing style may get old after awhile. Blasphemer is a great guitar player, but he doesn\u2019t have that same spark in his playing that Euronymous had. Albeit, Euronymous wasn\u2019t a great guitar player, he could write some mean and memorable riffs \u2013 and the hooks in the riffs are what really make you go back for more. Still, this is impressive compared to Grand Declaration of War.\n\nI doubt that the veteran Mayhem fans would be able to stomach this, because it is far different from the Euronymous era Mayhem. But you know what? It\u2019s still a good album, because it\u2019s unique, possesses evidence of good musicianship and it\u2019s made by four very talented musicians. It may not their best album (De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas takes the crown for that title), but it\u2019s not a bad listen for any fan of black metal. Check it out sometime, you might find yourself impressed.\n",
        "\nLive in Leipzig is one of Mayhems greatest albums as it holds the best members of the band displaying their natural talents and pleasure in performing live. \nOn the bottom line the sounds on this album is less than perfect in fact they could be dramatically improved but that would defeat the purpose of this album and of the band. On the subject of the poor recordings if you are not into muffled screams and guitars black metal really is not for you. If they were to take a KISS way out and edit the album I believe that the content would also be edited the sheer ambiance you feel when listening to it. \nThis album may be the best Thing Euronymous and Dead left for us. The muffled masterpiece we have actually puts us into the performance and what they were like live. When listening to it you feel like you are amongst the pig heads and various other dismembered body parts. Not to mention the fact that it is Dead and Euronymous at the lead... It makes it all the better... This album is like the turn from when Mayhem went from the greatest black metal band of all time to Cradle of Filth sell outs. Dead's vocals and stage antics tremble through the music and rip into you like nothing else. \nThen of course there is Euronymous's guitars... It absolutely blows you away. Its powerful and completely raw. His guitar dictates through the album the ambiance of death and destruction. The talent of guitars Euronymous displays in this album is imitate and cascades to a new level just before its death.\n",
        "\nLet\u2019s just forget that the Mayhem logo\u2019s on the cover of this one, okay? There are probably some Phil Anselmo/Killjoy projects out there on Baphomet that feature more members of The True Mayhem than this album does, and they might very well sound more like Mayhem\u2019s old music as well (but I can\u2019t be bothered to check). \n\nI can only guess what the flow of logic was that brought the musicians here to the sound on this album, but I tend to imagine that they thought black metal needed a change and that under the Mayhem name they could make a ubiquitous statement. If they had just wanted to make some easy money off of their name, there are certainly much simpler and easier ways of doing it than creating a monstrosity like this thing: other Norwegian bands have proven that without a doubt. Also, it doesn't sound like a prank or a bunch of distracted creative doodling the way that DHG's 666 International album did, or others in that vein. Mayhem aren\u2019t fucking around here; for better or worse, they really are giving the old college try at somehow reinventing black metal.\n\nOn the odd chance that you know nothing about this album, here\u2019s a short list of the sorts of things you\u2019ll encounter over its running time: very clean production, dissonant technical black metal guitar (!), extravagant drumming and flashy blast beats, harsh vocals, shouted vocals, ranted vocals, whispered vocals (all courtesy \u201cDeathcrush\u201d singer Maniac), one vaguely trip-hoppish electronic track (that\u2019s right, only one, and no other techno elements anywhere, in spite of what you may have heard), a generally \u201cmodern\u201d aesthetic\u2026 yes, there\u2019s something here for everyone to hate. Furthermore, the composition of these tracks actively eludes anything resembling a \u201csong\u201d in the usual sense of the word, and they sort of blur into one another, each seemingly an evolution into the next, so any notion that you might end up humming them in the shower is right out. So, yes, traditionalists are annoyed and novelty-seekers are delighted. But that\u2019s predictable, and not a terribly difficult thing to accomplish. Obviously Mayhem knew that they were going to offend people with this one; after all, you can\u2019t make an omelet without breaking a few eggs, as they say, and if black metal is going to have some glorious artistic future that moves beyond its murky past, some people are going to get left behind. But now that the smoke\u2019s cleared, well, does this thing have any real answers or just a lot of hot air?\n\nWell, perhaps it\u2019s got a little bit of both. All of the general strangeness here I can swallow \u2013 you\u2019re going to have to go a lot weirder than this if you want to lose me. While there are some really effective moments in here, there\u2019s a stumbling block in the move towards a more theatrical, \u201cperformance art\u201d ethic in their aims and songwriting. Observe in particular things like the marching intro to \u201cView from Nihil\u201d, or Maniac\u2019s speeches amidst the songs, or the way the album as a whole seems out to satirize black metal convention. Much of it feels too demonstrative to me, frequently sounding less like musical compositions and more like experimental sound collages put together by avant-garde ambient or noise artists. The guitar work is sort of interesting in that it breaks out of the clich\u00e9s of rock-based forms into strange cascades of dissonance, but in and of itself, it often appears to say nothing \u2013 just \u201cwe have moved beyond black metal\u201d. It\u2019s less like listening to music and more like listening to some kind of comment *about* music. \n\nAs a follow up to the creative explosion that occurred in Norway in the early 90s, I don\u2019t think \u201cGrand Declaration\u201d is quite a move in the right direction. Nevertheless, the truth is that I\u2019d rather listen to this than most of what\u2019s come out in the wake of the Norwegian scene\u2019s collapse. What can I say? It\u2019s an ambitious album and an interesting listen, and unlike so many other bands, Mayhem can honestly say that they tried. I wonder if things in the black metal scene would be any different right now if this album had worked out a little better?\n",
        "\nBefore the Black Circle, before Deads suicide, before the murder of Euronymous, before the church burnings, before black metal as we now know it, there was Deathcrush! In 1987, the now legendary Mayhem birthed what would become one of the most influencial black metal albums ever. This album is almost entirely responsible for what we know black metal as today. Perhaps Venom coined the phrase \"Black Metal\" but this album (along with a few others) is what was really responsible for the genre from a technical standpoint. The simplicity, the atmosphere, the production, the agression, this is what black metal is all about!\n\nDeathcrush starts off with the song \"Silvester Anfang\", which is an instrumental track, not even metal actually, it is strange millitary style drumming. After that, the infamous track Deathcrush comes ripping in with its rigid, midpaced first riff, the hair on the back of my neck STILL stands on end when I hear the begining of this song. It later picks up to the hyperspeed chainsaw guitars. The bass guitar on this song is thicker than tar and the drumming is just so relentless. Another track which stands out is (Weird) Manheim, which is the creepiest, most atmospheric track on the album. It has a very eerie intro, made by a synth/keyboard. After the intro the track cuts into some extremely raw black metal, reminiscent of Bathory, but it has a certain \"chaotic\" feeling that Bathory was lacking. I wont dwell on the other songs much, theese were just the ones that stood out the most to me.\n\nBefore Dead took vocal duties, there was Maniac (who is now the current Mayhem vocalist). If you are familiar with newer Mayhem releases, but not this one, Maniacs vocals are significantly different. Instead of his current vocal style (which is quite horrid, in my opinion), he has a haunting shriek, simmilar to Varg Vikernes almost, which sounds as if it were echoing through the bowels of hell. The lyrics are also very different. Where Dead was writing is ultra-depressed and cryptic lyrics, theese are more straight forward and overly evil/taboo. Dealing with such subjects as necrophilia, murder and death. The lyrics seem to fit more for a death metal band, but hell, when this album was released, black metal didnt really even exist.\n\nThe production is one of my favorite parts of this album. While \"De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\" was fine and polished, this album is incredibly raw. It sounds as if it were recorded in a garage or basement. I, for one, prefer this raw production, as it gives the music a more \"realistic\" feel to me. The fine production of \"De Mysteriis Dom Sathans\" always came across as pretentious to me. For a band like Mayhem, a decent production job is along the same lines as betrayal (im not saying \"De Mysertiis Dom Sathanas\" was a bad album though). I mean, sure, the production isnt perfect on this album, but I have heard FAR worse production jobs in my day.\n\nThis is one of the most influencial black metal releases ever. There is no snobbish synth (by snobbish, I mean symphonic), no acoustic interludes, no folk elements, no bullshit. This is a pure, unfiltered, old school black metal assault. If I were to rate this album without looking at its influence on the entire genre, I would give it an 80, but since it was SO influencial, that brought it up to a 90. The only thing holding it back from being flawless is the length, its just not long enough!\n",
        "\nAs far as I recall, this was the first Mayhem album I had listened to when I first became curious as to what Mayhem was actually like. I remember from the first listen I was put off by everything about the album and quickly deemed that Mayhem sucked, simply because the poor production style was new to me. How wrong I was. After learning more about black metal in general, I decided to check it out again. At this point, I'm saddened that not many black metal artists are as good as early Mayhem was.\n\nThe only thing about the album that kind of put me off was the first track, \"Silvester Anfang.\" It's much better to listen to when played live to get the loud and audible properties, but on this album it sounds kind of crappy. Everything else about this album is no joke - the guitars and riffs are raw, heavy, and crushing. Manheim pounding away on the kit makes it all more enjoyable; because he doesn't just rely on speed...he actually drums very well and offers variety. There are times where the classic chaotic blast beats are implemented into the mix; adding another splatter of Mayhem\u2019s element of wickedness.\n\nIn my opinion, this was Maniac's best vocal work with Mayhem. His screams of despair fit the atmosphere of the music more than on any other Mayhem album. Maniac\u2019s gut puking screams suck you in and it's damn near scary how he can make the music very emotional and creepy with his wailing cries. Necrobutcher\u2019s bass is extremely fuzzy and heavily distorted, and surprisingly, its presence is shown immensely. It's kind of hard to catch at certain fast points due to the shitty production, but for the majority the thick pummeling sound stands out very well.\n\nThe other thing I didn't like was the short track list. I realize this is an EP, but I wish there had been more on this album. The catchy parts of this album seem more revolved around chunk riffing than fast paced semi-thrash riffs. It's got its pernicious and speed parts, but I find the chunky parts to be much more enjoyable. The influence of Venom shows highly, and not just in the cover of the song \u201cWitching Hour.\u201d Songs like \u201cDeathcrush,\u201d \u201cNecrolust,\u201d and \u201cPure Fucking Armageddon\u201d show definite signs of thrash influence with fast (yet simple) tremolo picking.\n\nEuronymous makes it all work nicely, actually. For such crappy production it still manages to offer a strong, desolate, and enjoyable experience. I'd recommend it to any and all true black metal fans who can appreciate real old school black metal. I kind of wish Maniac would use the same vocal style he used on Deathcrush on all other Mayhem albums he was on, because I think Deathcrush is his best vocal work. This is an important piece of black metal history; obtain this brutal and primitive EP whenever you can.\n",
        "\nAlbums appear and disappear over the years, very few of which can really be labeled as true classics; something that is of historical excellence and importance. You know those old albums you\u2019re always hearing about and how when you listen to them they match up to all of the hype? This rare gem is one of those achievements on every scale for its influence on large amounts of black metal musicians. It gained even more popularity due to Euronymous' efforts to look brutal by using a picture of his self-slain band mate for the cover. The presence of coherent and audible instrumentation is almost surreal, given the fact that the production is piss-poor. Who the Hell would have expected such an amazing musical deliverance in a bootleg, much less a Mayhem bootleg?\n\nThe fuzzy production doesn\u2019t offer a serene atmosphere, and before listening I imagined that the bass would be practically non-existent on something like this, since the bass usually ends up taking the fall in the occurrence of sub-par production, but everything is amazingly audible! Without a doubt, this is Mayhem\u2019s finest line-up; the raspy growls of Dead, the sharp and cold axe work of Euronymous, the pummeling and distorted four-string crushfuck from Necrobutcher, and the violent speed and precision of Hellhammer\u2019s drumming makes this one of the best BM line-ups in history. Lack of lucidity doesn\u2019t stop the guitar from delivering a stunning performance of heavy and speedy necro tremolo riffs as well as some punishing and thrashy ones. It\u2019s not too surprising that the thrash elements are there, considering Euronymous worshipped Venom. Just about every single Mayhem classic is on this bootleg \u2013 Deathcrush, Chainsaw Gutsfuck, and Freezing Moon being my favorite tracks on here; what more could you really ask for?\n\nI didn\u2019t even bother with tracks nine through twelve, because they are practically unbearable to listen to from atrocious production and equally shitty sound quality. Maniac doesn\u2019t even sound like Maniac on those tracks; he sounds like a teen who just entered puberty. The bass on these tracks is nowhere to be found and the drums tend to dominate the overall sound. Seriously, just don\u2019t bother with the last four tracks. Regardless of those tracks, this is close to possessing a title of \u2018masterpiece.\u2019\n\nThe new Mayhem may not be bad, but it\u2019s evident that they need to take a lesson from their early days and try to emulate the old material, because it\u2019s their best material. This is essential for black metal fans, hands down.\n",
        "\nMayhem is one of the most well known bands in Black Metal and with this album they have returned to a more hateful and aggressive style. Grand Dec was experimental, but they go back to the old style with this so to say. Is it good? Yes and no. It's good in the fact that the musicians themselves are incredible. Production is good, lyrics are alright, and the vocals are better than previous works with Maniac. It's not good in the fact that the songs can all sound the same after a while. They are mostly constant blasts with Hellhammer doing his \"all over the kit\" style as usual. There are a few songs that slow down, such as Impious Devious Leper Lord and Dark Night of the Soul, both of which have some good riffs. ...Leper Lord has a nice bass riff going during the verses and Dark Night... has a nice crunchy guitar riff.\n\nManiac's vocals have improved a lot in this album. Instead of that screechy indecipherable rasp, he utilizes more of a traditional rasp with a low end screech. Not what we're all used to with him, and he has greatly improved. \n\nIt's sad really what has happened to Mayhem. I won't call them \"The True Mayhem\" since they aren't, but what I will call them is very capable musicians and originators of Norwegian Black Metal. For a band that has been around since 1984, they can still put out decent material, but of course nothing will ever match the Euronymous era works.\n",
        "\nIn the cold depths of oslo, norway during the years of the early nineties spawned a revolution in black metal. A small cult scene influenced by early works of Bathory, Hellhammer, Venom, and Holocausto a generation of new bands spawned. Creating blasphemy and art that was more than just music. One of the leaders during the black metal revolution was Mayhem. A norwegian band that had been around since the early 80's. Known for releasing some of the most famous extreme metal releases, mainly noting \"Deathcrush\" and the infamous \"Pure fucking armageddon\" demo Mayhem's cult fanbase kept drooling for the time to happen when the band would release their first full-length LP.\n\nafter nearly a decade of line-up changes and history within the band include the suicide of singer, Dead, the graphic horrid live performances featuring the crazy vocalist mutilating himself on stage; Mayhem finally had the ability to write the long awaited LP. Mayhem frontman and final existing member of the original line-up, Euronymous, was killed shortly after finishing the recording. His guitar work featured on the album is timeless. Featuring some really dark and evilest riffs even in the time of black metal. Due to the suicide of Dead, Mayhem required a new vocalist who is known as Attlia Csihar, an operatic vocalist at the time a member of a hungarian group known as Tormentor, was asked to do vocals on this album as a session musician. What would be the work of this session musician ends up being some of the most diverse, and original vocals at the time in black metal. These vocals really stick out as an amazing tool in the aid of this album to make it more powerful and striking than imagined at the time. From the long howls of \"Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuneral fog\" on the first track of the album to the graveland-esque snarls. Along with Attlia and Euronymous drummer Hellhammer adds to kettle with some amazing drum work. Though lost in the traditional horrid black metal production the drumming itself makes your heart skip a beat each time and continues pummeling itself into your ears. Also we cannot forget the infamous bassist Varg, Known for burning churches and finally killing Euronymous back in 1993. Who's basslines are found to be almost inaudible but the very backbone of the heavy sound that is mayhem.\n\nDespite all the things that make this album a black metal classic this album does have a bunch of filler within the mix which is a bit depressing to see on a debut LP, but nonetheless a masterpiece that should be owned by anybody interested in the black metal scene!\n",
        "\nThis demo has sloppy written all over it! It is a mess, yes indeed. Oh my goodness, this demo is just horrible, plain and simple. Well, Mayhem definitely improved by the time they released Deathcrush. This demo is mostly comprised of instrumentals.\n\nThe only great thing about this demo is the Venom cover, Black Metal. No vocals on here. It sounds pretty sloppy. But it's pretty cool though.\n\nOh man, this demo is bad. I'm not going to lie. I was expecting it to have some substance. It really doesn't. It's almost inaudible to listen to. I do like track #6, Mayhem. It's not really a song. I hear the band members fooling around and shit. Then the drummer just randomly beats on the drums. There's no guitar to be found on this track. This is a very funny track to listen to, I enjoy it.\n\nAre there vocals on here? Or is it the guitar? I don't know, but if there are vocals. The vocals are inaudible as fuck! This demo is just a bunch of noise. It was poorly made.\n\nI really think Mayhem should of put a lot more effort into this one. It's a horrible recording, yes. But Mayhem was a relatively new band at the time. I'll give them credit for making a demo. There's really nothing special on this demo.\n",
        "\nBlack metal to begin with is known to have poor production, so that might make you think that a live album from a black metal band would have very poor production. This is not the case though with this live album, it basically sounds as good as a studio album with live effects thrown in, like the crowd and more of an echo to the instruments and the vocals.\n\nDead is definetly an awesome vocalist, he rips through the songs with his menacing vocals and never lets up, I like him a bit better than attila, and for a live performance, his voice holds up incredibly well.\n\nSome of the songs on this album are played a little sloppy, like in the beginning of 'Funeral Fog'. They may have messed up a few riffs, but it still sounds grim as fuck. Most of the songs they play on this cd are very good choices to play live. The highlights would be 'Deathcrush' and 'Freezing Moon'.\nFreezing Moon will forever be one of the most bad ass black metal songs there is, and with Dead on vocals, it is just that much more powerful.\n\nHellhammer's drumming on this album is amazing as usual, he keeps up with the rest of the band very well, and luckily the drumming is well heard on this album, so you can hear it in all it's black metal glory. The Guitar playing is well done, and just a little sloppy at times, but for the speed these guys play at, it is to be a little expected. The Bass can be heard pretty easily and is simple, but also well played.\n\nThis is A great live album to have by this band, it's fairly well produced considering it is live black metal, and the selection of songs is good. Any fan of black metal would do well to pick this up.\n",
        "\nAs the title says, I think this album is a combination of Wolf's Lair Abyss and De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas. It has all the brutality and speed of WLA while maintaining the dark sound of DMDS. A lot of people hate Maniac's vocals, but I think he has always done a great job, especially on this particular album. He has a more distinct voice and his vocals give a darker feel to the music than the previous albums he did.\n\nBlasphemer kicks ass also. Some parts of this album are just so goddamn technical that I don't know how these fuckers can remember all of this stuff! Like on \"Dark night of the soul\", it starts out kind of slow and haunting, but then it becomes extremely brutal and technical towards the end. Mayhem has become a band that has avoided being one-dimensional unlike many black metal bands today. IE: Darkthrone.\n\nThis album is not predictable at all and one can listen to it over and over. For the people who say that this isn't the true Mayhem, then what is? Even old Mayhem metamorphosized from being death metal to black metal: Deathcrush and De Mysteriis. Blasphemer is the guitarist Euronymous could never be, I must say. Rude, but true.\n",
        "\nThe Deathcrush EP...ah, where am I to start? I might begin with the musical aspects. This EP is filled with deathish thrash (or is it thrashy death), somewhat reminding of Celtic Frost (like the Necrolust intro...pure Celtic Frost worship) and Venom-ish rock n roll, like the Deathcrush main riff. The song structures are pretty simple, play midtempo for a verse, then go mad on the guitar and smash the hell out of the drums with fast 2/4 or semi-competent blastbeats, go back to the verse and then let the song die out in some sort of audio madness, like the outro of Slayer's Raining Blood. The band is not very tight, as I said before the blastbeats sound semicompetent, Euronymous plays sloppy and so forth. But now let's go over to the aspect that make this album brilliant...\n\n...namely that fucking eerie feeling over it. It's kind of emotional, for example when the song Deathcrush speeds up with that riff (so sad-sounding! unbelievably sad) and Maniac shrieks with his desperate voice...the vocals are great here, no matter what you say, and add up to a lot of atmosphere. The garage feeling on this EP adds up to the atmosphere too, and something you can't look past is that the guy playing these sloppy, sad riffs got murdered a couple of years later is eerie...truly eerie...of course it's got a comic element, like that outro, and the songtitles, but in some strange way they help out in making this record even more eerie. \n\nThe EP has it's drawbacks, which lies mainly in songwriting, but what the fuck, this is purely about atmosphere. As mentioned the playing is sloppy, but I think it is better that way, kind of like Hellhammer.\n\nOne note though: Something that might also add up to the atmosphere is that my philippinese vinyl sounds like shit, but that is for you to find out.\n",
        "\nAfter a two minute intro, consisting of gunfire, missiles launching, church organ music, and an Arab marketplace we are treated to... the most fucking strange music in the world, and why not! Of course, that's what we've come to expect from Meads, right?\n\nThe music is pretty much the typical riffy affair you'd expect from this band, but you also get strange breakdowns of Jihadic (is that a word?) music, religiously extremist chants and speeches, classical music performed as techno, and tribal drums with deep growled vocals. Very strange indeed, and also very fitting.\n\nThe music is also generally quite slow, but sometimes speeds up to add effect, as if worshiping Allah. 'Tanks In The Holy Land' is just one long soundclip of military movements, with what sounds like an Arabic chant repeating over and over. While 'Assassins Of Allah' seems to be praising those who suicide bomb in the name of their God. Very thrilling, and contraversial music from this British band.\n\nStand-out songs are: Jihad and Another God In Another Place\n\n\nNow, the Mayhem side leaves something to be desired, because the production is awful, and after listening to all of what Meads have done, it puts a huge wall up, and you expect more good quality.\n\nStill, they are Mayhem songs, and they are performed amazingly well, with great solos, riffs (which are really only just listenable), and amazing drumming. The vocals are pretty much typical, being raspy and very evil sounding.\n\nThere isn't really a stand-out Mayhem song, seeing as there's only two, and that's a shame, because they could've fit more onto here. But they're both really good.\n\n\nAll in all, this is a good split, with the better side being by the Meads, although it seems that this was released for Meads to break into the big time, and Mayhem helped them on their way. Good stuff.\n",
        "\nWow! How shitty is that production? Although the demo was much much much fuckin worse, basically with no production at all, so this isn't that bad right? \n\nIt's pretty sloppily played thrash in the end. Influences are definately early Bathory and Venom, with Hellhammer thrown in for good measure. The riffs are pretty catchy at time, like on the title track, with that amazingly catchy main riff and on Necrolust with it's headbanging power at the beginning. Fuckin classic there. The drums aren't bad at all really, although they are distant sounding pretty much throughout the entire record. The vocals are very harsh, way different from what Maniac sounds like today. The bass is like a roaring distorted buzzsaw. Check out that little bass solo near the end of Deathcrush(ok maybe not a solo). Pure ripping fury. \n\nWhen this was released, I'm sure people didn't know what the hell this was. Noise, garbage, anything but good music. When I listen to this today, I can enjoy it immensley and respect what these guys were aiming for then. This was probably the fastest, most brutal thing anything had heard back in those days. Buy this if you are not offended by bad production.\n",
        "\nBeing that this is the first Mayhem album without Euronymous, this is a fairly interesting one. This is proof that even without Mayhem\u2019s former \u201cleader,\u201c they can still manage to pump out some blistering and worthy black metal. This isn\u2019t as raw as Deathcrush or the legendary DMDS; the production is much more clean, dry and sharp. Maniac is back on vocals, and to say the least, his style is much different than it was on Deathcrush. Instead of his former Deathcrush style screams, he\u2019s got more of a guttural and gritty shriek going on.\n\nMany, and I mean many, will be put off by Maniac\u2019s vocals. Maniac almost sounds like he\u2019s got cicadas and beetles in his throat while he sings from his stomach. Some people may pick up on his singing right away, others may find it to be an acquired taste, and then the rest will despise his singing. At times Maniac\u2019s singing reminds me of Smeagol from Lord of the Rings, but I still manage to enjoy it when I\u2019m not thinking of those big bug eyes and that voice that calls out for his precious. Blasphemer puts on a satisfactory performance, but his guitar sounds a little rusty and anhydrous...but it does the job decently. Some of the material sounds rather DMDS-ish (Ancient Skin, I Am Thy Labyrinth).\n\nThe drumming is rather brisk, but it\u2019s much more varied than what I expected from Mayhem - instead of the majority of just blast beats there is a lot more interchanging between double bass, snare, and cymbals. Of course this is Mayhem, so all of the songs with the exception of the opening instrumental are fast and tenacious. The opening track is a bit too long, using a clip in length of a minute or less would have done the job instead of almost two and a half minutes of thick swirling wind sounds accompanied by some static. Not only that, but this is far too short (I\u2019ve seen the price on this album going for as much as a regular CD, which I find to be a tad ridiculous).\n\nIt\u2019s a worthy purchase for sure, but I have my doubts about it being worth the amount of an album, which uses up all of the space available on the CD. Get it sometime, but don\u2019t put it ahead of a kick ass full-length that you might be looking for.\n",
        "\nThis meteor of a live album starts off its heavy but calm rain of terror with the drum attack of \u201cSilvester Anfang\u201d. I used to dislike the song until I heard it performed live (it kind of sucks on the \u201cDeathcrush\u201d album). After this tribal and catchy track is done with, the real chaos begins with the classic song \u201cDeathcrush\u201d. Blasphemer is more on track with tempo on this album than Euronymous was on Live in Leipzig and doesn\u2019t leave any room for (obvious, anyways) fuck-ups. As it\u2019s been stated before, the drums can be dominant of the music (Fall of Seraphs is a good example of this) and drown out the other instruments.\n\nThe solo in Chainsaw Gutsfuck can\u2019t be heard at all due to the drums drowning it out. Even though the solo isn\u2019t that great, I happen to like it...and the drums ruin it. Necrobutcher\u2019s bass isn\u2019t much different - still heavily distorted, but much pushier and stand out on this album. You can hear it much better than on Live in Leipzig (probably due to the fact that the production isn\u2019t as bad), filling in the gaps and gluing the drums and guitar together. Another issue is Maniac\u2019s vocals.\n\nOf course you\u2019ll hear people complaining that his vocals suck and are indecipherable, but who the fuck cares? Maniac is perfect for Mayhem because black metal isn\u2019t supposed to look pretty. These growls and screams are the kind you\u2019d expect to hear from a hospital patient who is screaming when they\u2019re about to vomit - emetic and sickening. Maniac deals out the guttural and stomach churning vocals with ease - not a bad replacement for Dead. We also get to hear a guest appearance from Attila on track nine, singing along with Maniac using his deep and monstrous vocals.\n\nHellhammer is an excellent drummer and this album would be a good choice if you wanted to go about defining his skill on the kit. The drums are dominant in some songs, as I stated earlier, but not overly so that it\u2018s unbearable. The drums are part of what really makes this album a meteor of black metal terror - they crush all in their path with blistering double bass, crackling cymbals, and hammer smashing snare. This album is done with better production than any previous live albums...but I really have no feelings about that; I don\u2019t consider it to improve the sound, nor do I think it takes away from it. The improved production basically just makes it more tolerable for people who hate shitty production...but if you like both ends of the spectrum with production I\u2019m sure you won\u2019t really be bothered.\n\nIt\u2019s not as good as Live in Leipzig, but it\u2019s close behind. If you\u2019re a new fan go for Live in Leipzig first, wait a little while, then give this album a try (if you dig live albums, that is). Definitely a worthy purchase.\n",
        "\nWhen Mayhem's newest album, Chimera's release date was announced, I had some suspicions about it... I thought that it would be a general failure, like many \u201dcome-back\u201d -albums. But, when I \ngot it in my hands, I instantly saw that I was wrong. Chimera is a great return to standard black metal, unlike GDW.\n\nThe first thing I took in note in this album was it perfectionist production quality \u2013 all the songs are mixed with great skill, which makes the song lose a bit of the underground-feeling. Some may like it, some may not. To me, it doesn't make any difference. ;) A friend of mine, before listening the album, said \u201dBah, Mayhem sux, they can't play, even though they're COOL!\u201d and after hearing the first song, his opinion was the opposite (they were still cool, however) Hellhammer's, Blasphemer's and Necrobutcher's work is at it's best in this album. Maniac's growling (or call it snarling) is something between enthraling and hypnotic.\n\nThe album starts with Whore, which is a great beginning song, aggressive yet not too fast. I tend to detest too fast, I mean fast, black metal songs. Don't know why, perhaps I'm not a real black metal fan... who knows. Hellhammer's work on this song is great as usual, especially in the beginning. \n\nThen comes Dark Night of The Soul, which in my opinion is the best song in the whole album, it has a great riff and drumming. Then comes Rape Humanity with Pride, also a good song but not as notable as DNTS, great verses though. Then comes My Death, with aggressive drumming and nice riffs. You Must Fall and Slaughter of Dreams are also good songs, but in my opinion not special.\nInstead, the ending tracks, Impious Devious Leper Lord and Chimera belong to the album highlights, both with intense guitar and drumming work.\n\nI suggest that you either buy or steal this album, as it is most certainly worth listening to!\n",
        "\nEvery time I listen to this, I remember more and more how much of a bad ass singer Dead was. This live recording shows Dead in his prime. Instead of taking the path of the generic black metal screams, Dead takes the guttural, vomit inducing, and gut churning growling. This style makes it much easier to try to decipher the lyrics without losing its kick and brutality on this live recording. It's debatable on whether or not Dead was the ultimate black metal singer - that\u2019s up for each person to decide but personally I think he ranks high up there.\n\nThis is how a live album SHOULD sound - no editing, no dubbing, just live music. Although the drums sometimes dominate the music and make some instruments less audible, the music still stays on track and doesn't relent it's heavy and atmospheric assault. The bass isn't exactly out there, it's heavily distorted and fuzzy, but if you listen closely to the mix you can notice the pushy edge that it gives to the music. The guitar is meaty, heavy with slippery and slimy sounds to it. If you could turn the guitar sound into any material object it would be a piece of thick slime oozing down a clean wall.\n\nSure, there are some mess-ups here and there on some songs (tempo on \"Deathcrush\" for example) but that can be expected when any artist performs live. Generally, I don't think one would really be bothered by the mess-ups, most of them are very minor (tempo mistakes here and there, etc.) and the songs are still played in excellent fashion. Most of Mayhem's classic songs are played here and makes it worth your money to have an almost perfect set list for a Mayhem concert and listen to it live over and over again. The atmosphere of this live album is truly live and not messed around with. You can hear the crowd, feel the poor production, and such which makes a live album what it should be.\n\nSuch a shame that Dead went so early. Sadly, it should be expected that such a great vocalist was too good to last forever. Highly recommended if you are in any way, shape, or form, a fan of Mayhem.\n",
        "\n...and my opinion comes here.\n\nOkay, it's a mini-album. But it's a lot better to release a \"short\" (+20min) mini-album with all great tracks, than a full-length with crap filler-songs. Maniac's vocals are a controversial topic for a lot, but I think his shreaks are well suited for Mayhem's new style.\n\nThe album is well-mixed to create a great black metal-atmosphere. Raw, dark, hatefilled, dirty and a bit fuzzy. All instruments are well audible, the riffs are great, overall the music is very fast-paced with some slower parts, but the drumming sounds a bit machine-like. I happen to like all the tracks on this mCD. This is Mayhem's best and rawest release IMO, as I said on the topic.\n\nNoteworthy tracks : Ancient Skin, I Am Thy Labyrinth.\n\nThis would've deserved a full 100 points if the drumsound was a bit better. Once again, it's the best Mayhem-recording there is, and sadly they are going to a crap direction in their music nowadays; we won't be hearing Ancient Skin-like killer songs in the future.\n",
        "\nThe New Mayhem \u2013 essential black metal, or prettiest-looking coaster to come along in a while? I suppose that all depends on your perspective. For my part, it is at least worthy of some attention.\n\nThe first thing you notice upon getting this disc is the slick packaging. Usually the packaging is a superfluous matter on a black metal CD, but this is obviously a special case, so I feel I should comment on it. In case mine is different from yours, let me sum it up for you \u2013 mine is a quadruple-gatefold digipak with pictures of the band members on the inside. Very slick and professional-looking. The liner notes are crap, however, as they are made of some sparkly paper composite that makes it extremely difficult to read the lyrics. An entire page is devoted to showing how cool Hellhammer\u2019s drum setup is. *YAWN* How lame. Anyway, on to the music.\n\nThe production is amazingly clear \u2013 each instrument can be heard perfectly well, and they are all in fairly good balance with each other. However, the production is perhaps just a tad too perfect. There is no rawness to be found here \u2013 if this CD had hair, even its ass hair would be perfectly well groomed. This all lends a sort of facelessness, or at least a lackluster personality, to the music. Hellhammer\u2019s drums don\u2019t help, as they have an awful, triggered, clickety-click sound that only adds to the general lack of personality to be found here.\n\nThe skills of Blasphemer, Hellhammer, and Necrobutcher, however, are not in doubt. They are all amazing musicians, and they all deliver fantastic performances in their own right \u2013 but seemingly at the cost of artistic coherency. There are so many weird sounds and riffs here that the music seems as though it is trying to do a million things at once, and therefore comes off as somewhat pretentious and unfocused. Maniac\u2019s vocals are not much to write home about, either \u2013 his dry, raspy snarl is pretty basic, but it gets the job done.\n\nThis all sounds pretty bad, true. So why a 70% rating? Because it actually sounds fairly unique. Allow me to explain. I see two basic camps in black metal right now \u2013 on one side, there are the melodic/symphonic black metal bands which are experiencing a wave of popularity right now, and there are the ultra-raw, minimalist, hypnotic black metal bands which remain violently opposed to commercialism and popularity. Against this background, Chimera seems to stake out a third camp, an avant-garde, intellectual approach to black metal. Given Hellhammer\u2019s work with Arcturus, and Mayhem\u2019s previous effort, this isn\u2019t really all that surprising. The downside of this approach is that Chimera sounds fairly high-flown and pretentious, but the upside is that it actually sounds quite different than most currently-circulating black metal. This isn\u2019t really revolutionary, and I doubt many bands are going to follow Mayhem into Chimera territory. But it\u2019s something different, at any rate.\n",
        "\nI don't know what possessed me to buy this dvd with haste other than impulse a few months ago. I expected to see black metal performed in, black metal \"fashion\" per se no stupid theatrics, no lame backdrop etc. But i knew of Mayhem's new stuff sucking, cause Maniac decided it'd be cool to have spoken word chorus's and bridges. \n\nI can only sit though about 10 songs in the set. Most of the stuff off of GDOW seems to drag-along, no mistake about it Blasphemer is a good guitarist but has the wrong idea about black metal as far as mayhem goes when you go technical is doesn't work. Mayhem's known most for their morbid riffage(Deathcrush, Chainsaw Gutsfuk) and their primitive riffage and nonstop tremelo picking(Funeral Fog) with some but little to no melody. The newer stuff is more melodic, more intricate just as aggressive but its just not as faithful to the original style of Mayhem of old. \n\nManiac portray's himself as a fool throughout the concert, just walking around while the band is pounding and grinding away at the instruments. He just has no charisma and is not interesting as a frontman, his vocals are harsh(not that thats bad) and are hard to make out what hes saying live Dead was better IMO. Hellhammer's drums sound like shit, Necrobutcher's bass is nowhere to be heard and Blasphemer's guitar is the only instrument i had no problem's with.\n\nSo if your looking for a good concert to buy on dvd, buy Kreator's or Death's DO NOT waste your money on Mayhem's.\n",
        "\nAs much as I respect bands trying to stretch out and try something different due to being artists and all, something just ought not to be tried. Like this extensive experiment in electronica meets black metal, for example. I am not one of these closed-minded black metal geeks who thinks Mayhem ought not to have continued after Euronymous' death or for that matter that Dead was the better vocalist (he wasn't--all hail Csihar Attilla!), but I like to think that know a forced effort when I hear one. And this CD does not flow naturally at all. It feels more like a collection of isolated moments instead of songs, and that seriously affects its momentum. Just when you think it's getting a good riff going, it jumps to a totally unrelated part and then another, and goes on to totally lose my interest. It was interesting at first, but after a few listens it lost me.\n\nOn the bright side, Maniac shows himself to be quite the vocal chameleon on this CD, going from BM 101 screeching to chilling whispers to a pseudo-Southern preacher delivery, and does it all well. Blasphemer started really stretching out as well with dissonant Voi Vod riffs and the occasional wailing solo (like on \"Completion of Science in Agony\", with Maniac's searing screams of \"Yesss, yeeeessss, YEEESSSSSS!!!!!\" accenting it nicely), unlike the typical black metal tremolo picking, which only rarely shows up here. Hellhammer, well, he's Hellhammer, but so damn triggered they may as well have used a drum machine. Strong musicianship aside, though, that is not enough to save an album if the coherence is lacking, which it is in this case. I appreciate that Mayhem tried something new and different on this album, but damnit, it just isn't the same. Sorry, guys, though \"Chimera\" is actually a little better...\n",
        "\nOK, first things first\u2026AIIIEEEE! That drum sound! Somebody slap Mr. Von Blomberg with a sledgehammer for allowing that awful triggered sound to dominate this album and for the album to be released like that! It\u2019s even worse than Krisiun, for Pete\u2019s sake! Other than that, I cannot fault this album for its perfect production\u2014the guitar sound is full and crunchy, and the bass has an evil fuzz tone which is showcased on intros to both \u201cDark Night of the Soul\u201d and \u201cSlaughter of Dreams\u201d, and on that latter tune the bass dominates the verses as well. The title track ends the album with a lurching doom feel alternating with brief bursts of thrash, erupting into a frenzied blast beat middle part, and is one of the better tunes on display here.\n\nSong-wise, this album is better than \u201cA Grand Declaration of War\u201d because it is much more accessible than that album was, easier to follow and swallow. The songs are much more straightforward than the stop/start jerky feel that \u201cGrand Declaration\u2026\u201d suffered from, and the album flows much better for it. Terrifying blast beats run rampant and the double kick work is the fastest I\u2019ve heard since Pete Sandoval on \u201cOpening of the Gates\u201d on Morbid Angel\u2019s \u201cGateways to Annihilation\u201d, which ought to tell you something. That being the fact that Hellhammer still has it going on in the drum realm, no question there. \n\nManiac, well, he still sounds like Black Metal 101 most of the time\u2014high, raspy, and screechy\u2014but he does get in some sinister spoken parts and lower snarling as well. Still, he doesn't have the same level of character and personality as the likes of Isahn or Abbath Doom Culta, or even Dani Filth. \n\nBlasphemer really comes into his own on this album as a guitarist, too, as he cranks out an impressive array of riffing ranging from power chords to the usual tremolo picking to the dissonant little Voi Vod-sounding parts that littered \u201cGrand Declaration\u2026\u201d, to chunky palm muting, it\u2019s the Prego approach to riffing. \n\nThis is a good album, but overall, something is lacking, a little something indefinable...hard to explain. Parts of this album feel as though Mayhem are trying a little too hard to impress with how fast and extreme they can play, and it's too much of a good thing. It's excessive, and this is not always good. It's lacking more in the way of dynamics and feeling--it's TOO cold and calculated, not enough humanity. You can blather on about how \"black metal is about hatred and coldness, yattayatta\", but really, this album would sound more convincing if some real, unadulterated rage were present to go with the furious blasting and mad riffing. This is nowhere near as prominent as many other of the great black metal bands, and I think Mayhem need to either rethink their approach or call it quits, sad to say. As they stand right now, they seem particularly impotent, and this is not acceptable for an \"elder statesman\" band like them. \n\nStandout tracks: \u201cDark Night of the Soul\u201d, \"Rape Humanity With Pride\", \u201cSlaughter of Dreams\u201d, \"Chimera\"\n",
        "\nThis is one classic album. Sure, the production is poor as hell and sometimes it sounds as though Hellhammer is the sole member, but the raw power of the songs comes through much better than on the actual albums. Firstly - thankfully, Maniac is gone for the first 9 songs. That being said, the songs that appeared on Deathcrush (Deathcrush, Necrolust, Chainsaw Gutsfuck, Pure Fucking Armageddon) are done much better with a good vocalist. Dead's style is much more of a growl than a shriek, which I definitely prefer.\n\nThree \"new\" songs (at the time) are also included - Funeral Fog, Freezing Moon and Buried By Time and Dust. The latter is horrid - you can't hear ANYTHING except the drums. Funeral Fog is done amazingly, but I do prefer Atilla on this particular song. Freezing Moon is the best song on here, especially when everything cuts out except the bass. EVIL! A song from their demo days also appears, Carnage. Once again, the bass takes over right from the beginning and the song kicks all ass, especially with the raspy vocals of one Dead.\n\nIn addition to the above, there are also 4 songs from a concert in 1986 (well, 3 tracks, as the first two are part of one track). They are basically useless, as nothing can be heard above the static.Danse Macabre is nothing but screaming from the audience. Black Metal (Venom) is done half decently, much better than on Pure Fucking Armageddon at least. Procreation of the Wicked is an excellent Celtic Frost track, nothing special here. I never thought Welcome to Hell was a great song in the first place. Oh well, at least it's under the static here.\n\nGet this, it's next to impossible to actually find it. Just download the Mp3's and save yourself a hassle.\n",
        "\nAfter listening to this album a bit, I can see why many consider this to be an essential part of the modern black metal movement. The vibe and feeling on this album are amazing, if the playing isn\u2019t, and the production is actually slightly better than most black metal out there. And really, nobody else sounds like Csihar Attilla\u2014his inimitable deep, raspy, thickly accented moans, growls, and screams are unlike any other black metal vocalist out there. He sounds really, truly unhinged, like a mental hospital inmate who happened to wander into the studio and ended up having a total meltdown in front of the mike. Take notes, all you aspiring black metallers out there; this guy is the real deal, sounding genuinely more menacing and threatening than most. \n\nThe guitars and bass merge into a single ugly wall of fuzz, yet each has a distinct presence, and Hellhammer simply beats the living crap out of his kit (although he\u2019s not as tight as he\u2019s since become) with vigor and enthusiasm. The riffing is simple, but engrossing, and it seems that Euronymous knew his way around a riff more than some would imply, as they are actually well structured and catchy in their repetitive, minimalist flow, and his raw, caustic guitar tone really added to the feel of this album. \n\nEvery tune is played with all the ability they could muster back then, which makes it feel all the more sincere, and I guess this is what is meant by \u201ctrue\u201d in black metal circles. The fact that they put their hearts into the music is what makes this an undeniably powerful and still influential album, and you can sense that in every song. Definitely a keeper, and most definitely one of the most true cult masterpieces out there alongside the old Venom, Bathory and Celtic Frost albums.\n",
        "\nYou've probably heard the story behind this recording, so I'll spare you a history lesson and move right on to the music. Now then, this is the best lineup the band has ever had, performing ltheir classics live in concert. It's an eerie thing, knowing that two of these guys would be dead soon. Except for Dead, who was already Dead.\n\nOkay, that was really lame. But it is a good performance. The guitars are raw and brutal, and Dead's tortured shrieks fill the gloomy air, making for a spine-chilling experience. The performance is not the problem. It's the mix. In short, worst production ever. Actually, the production on the first eight songs, being recorded four years later than tracks nine through twelve, are a lot better than the last few tracks, recorded in 1986. The guitars on tracks one through eight tend to be obscurred by distortion at times, especially on Funeral Fog and Carnage, but overall it's not bad. It's the cover songs that blow the proverbial cock. THESE have the absolute worst production I have ever heard. The only thing audible is the vocals, and everything else is a muddy, dirty, muffled, wet ball of feces. You can't even come close to discerning anything from anything else, including the crowd noise. Totally unlistenable. But the 1990 performance more than makes up for it.\n\nThe setlist is fantastic. They play virtually everything they had at that point, including a few songs from De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas. Dead's vocals really add something to these songs - just listen to the way he introduces Freezing Moon. \"When it's cold...and when it's dark...the freezing moon will obsess you!\" Badass. The Deathcrush songs are given a better treatment with a good singer, too.\n\nAll things considered, this is not De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas. This is better. Fuck the lame production, this is heavy fucking METAL the way it should have been done on De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas. Listen to this, bang your fucking head, and disregard the covers. This is Mayhem the way Mayhem should always be heard.\n",
        "\n\"Deathcrush\" is one of those items which hold a godly status among the underground Metal adepts. Most times this blindly worshipping feedback appears to be determined by totally non-musical factors, yet Mayhem's second demo and first \"proper\" release stands high on the top of its unquestionable historical significance. \nThe year was 1987, and when anyone mentioned \"extreme Metal\", everybody would think \"Reign In Blood\", of course. At the same time, however, the forefathers of Black Metal were busy pushing the insane aggression of Thrash to new extremes, a courageous attitude which would ultimately give birth to two genres: Death Metal and Black Metal. \"Deathcrush\" is one of the most significative documents of this evolution. It's a short, hit-and-run, less than twently minutes slab of pure aggression, where classic elements of Thrash are defiled by what could be described as the seeds of Black/Death by today's standards, but out by a bunch of not excessively skilled musicians who definitely knew what they wanted. At the time, this sounded like pure insanity, and today, the effect still refuses to wear off. \n\nOddly enough, the albumm opens with a kind of \"melodic\" drum machine track named \"Silvester Anfang\", composed for the band by Conrad Schnitzer. Mayhem have always been weirdos, no doubt about it. But then the title track kicks in, and it's compromiseless Metal insanity. The first riff is actualy pretty interesting (and, most importantly, fucking cool) with its odd tempo; Euronymous basic guitar buzz is well backed by Necrobutcher's distorted bass sound, the result being a harsh bu rather thick sound. The drums, despite Manheim's rather sloppy playing (well, nobody in teh band really shines at this stage), have a clear and strong sound, which has just one drawback: it tends to drown out the guitars and bass... Maniac's vocals, finally, are full of reverb in true eraly Black Metal tradition, sound (thankfully) nothing like the gibberish puking he's been spewing out sinc etha band's reunion; he uses a very high pitched and insane shrieking (think of Varg Vikernes on heavy drugs), which fits the mood of the songs pretty well. Anyway, the song soon turns into a very fast blasting fest, with none in the band strictly following a precise tempo, but the effetc is damn shattering anyway... I wonder how people did react to this at the time. \n\"Chainsaw Gutsfuck\" opens with a slow distorted bass riff, soon joined by drums and guitars; this song is the slowest of the lot, and is built on an interestingly tempoed riff similar to the one used on the opening riff in \"Deathcrush\". Original and effective - who needs technical perfection when we have these qualities? \n\"Witching Hour\" is a Venom cover which best exemplifies how Mayhem crafted their unique sound by enhancing the madness found in their sources of inspiration... more in depth, the rendition of this song is FUCKING FAST (just compare it with the original and see for yourself... and keep in mind that the year was 1987). Original session vocalist Messiah appears as a guest on this one, and unlike on the \"Pure Fucking Armageddon\" demo, we can hear his vocals, which aren't that special (a kind of low and rather breathy spoken voice) but make a nice contrast with Maniac's banshee-like screams (don't miss that chilling \"Witching hoooooooooooouuuuuuuuuuurrrrrrr!!!!\" at the end!). \n\n\"Necrolust\"... this song alone pioneered a whole new style of playing. It opens with a little neat mid-paced, palm muted riff (Celtic Frost was the band's main inspiration along with Venom), but soon turns into a relentless assault of insanely fast riff. Ceaseless beats and razor sharp picking, and unearthly screams to top the whole thing - isn't it a bit the formula of modern raw Black Metal? \n\"(Weird) Manheim\" is a short and indeed weird \"distorted piano\" (at least it sounds like that) interlude which leads into the epitome of aggression... \"Pure Fucking Armageddon\". This song is just what the title says: after a short and great thrashy beginning, noise begins (of course not the shitty kind of noise). Definitely one of the (if not the) 100% compromise free slabs of Metal ever put together. Vocalist Messiah handles this one by himself, as he already did on teh demo of the same title... it's ok, vocals wouldn't really change the result here. And the year was 1987. Can you say \"unbelievable\"? \n\nThis, ladies and gentlemen, is \"Deathcrush\", and if you want to dig deep to the roots of extreme music, this is more than mandatory.\n",
        "\nThis is exactly that. There was no need to release not one, but TWO live albums of the same material. Ok, so they substituted Freezing Moon for Necrolust on U.S. Legions, but still, it's the same damn thing. Season of Mist is basically portraying themselves as greedy, money hungry slobs, which they probably are anyway. Sure the musicianship is great, but we have heard these songs way too many times before live, no matter how great they truly are. Sure, I love Freezing Moon just as much as the next guy, but do we need to hear it live yet again from the same lineup as Mediolanum Capta Est, where they played these songs previously. Sure there are two songs from GDOW played live, but that's it. They could have atleast included more of those songs, as they are more fresh than Freezing Moon or Carnage. The pre-production tracks are good, but nothing special. They just don't have the overproduced feeling to them and the techno. \n\nLive in Marsille is a much better purchase, as it has like 17 songs. This has a measly 7 live songs and like 5 pre-production tracks, which is downright atrocious. When will Mayhem get off their asses and finish Chimera? And you know what? When they release that and tour to support it, I bet you anything they will release atleast 5 live albums, all only having maybe 2-3 songs max on them from Chimera and the rest from De Mysteriis and Wolf's Lair Abyss. Shit, I bet Season of Mist won't make any money anyway off these.\n",
        "\nThese are the first two words that come into my mind whenever I think about this release. Let me explain you why: after something like 2 years after the previous live release (Mediolanum Capta Est) and just one more studio album, Mayhem (or better, Season Of Mist) fire out ANOTHER live release... which makes 3 official live albums for this band, not counting God knows how many bootlegs. This would be enough to make \"European Legions\" useless, but sadly the nonsense goes on.\n\nFirst, the tracklist includes only 7 live tracks. Considering that \"Live In Leipzig\" and \"Mediolanum Capta Est\" offered 9 and 11 respectively (hell, even bootlegs like \"The Return\" have a more lengthy tracklist) suspects are bound to rise immediately. This could be justified if the purpose of this release was to display the band playing the new material live, which they actually did on the tour. But there's something wrong, as only 2 songs (\"To Daimonion\" and \"View From Nihil\") come from \"Grand Declaration Of War\". The rest... \"Fall Of Seraphs\", \"Carnage\", \"Freezing Moon\"... wow, something we've never head before! Great songs, no doubt about it, but what's the need to issue them again when we could hear them played by the same line-up on \"Mediolanum Capta Est\"?\nThere is, however, something more: 5 songs from \"Grand Declaration Of War\" in pre-production version. Some might like them more than the overproduced album renditions, but still it's not enough to justify this release. And don't let the cool slipcase fool you - the actual cover of the album is the same dead dove laying in barbed wire we saw since the GDOW promos went out.\n\nI'm giving this release a 50 because of the great musicianship displayed by the band on stage and the excellent quality of the live sound. It could have been a great complete live album... another waste of potential.\nTo make it EVEN MORE absurd, Season Of Mist decided to issue another version of this release for the American Market, labelled \"U.S. Legions\", the only difference being the absence of the slipcase and the inclusion of \"Necrolust\" (another song we've never heard about) in the live set... obviously there's a price to pay to have one more song, so they took \"Freezing Moon\" out of the tracklist.\n\n...oh, I almost forgot the finishing touch: finally, in 2002, Season Of Mist released a full live cd, named \"Live In Marseille 2000\". It's the soundtrack of the excellent live dvd / vhs of the same name. Obviously it would be the only recent live Mayhem release worth having, so it was limited to 500 copies worldwide. But \"European / U.S. Legions\" will forever be available.\nDo the people behind record companies even LIKE the music they issue?\n",
        "\nDead said this phrase right before \"Carnage\", to cheer up the audience a bit, that were somewhat undifferent to the band playing (they didn't know exactly what they were missing).\n\nThe sound is so live and so honest that it 's actually a bootleg made official. Direct soundboard recording, no bullshit overdubs, in the great tradition of REAL live recordings (see also \"No Sleep 'till Hammersmith\" and \"Live in Viena '93\"). The performance is marvelous, if you can get past all the technical flaws, fuck-ups and dissagreements (tempo and coordination speaking) on the playing.\n\nGranted, this isn't the ultimate black metal recording, but it's pretty damn good, for what it is. It is one of the premier examples on how black metal should sound on a live environment: raw, perverse, raw (2 times), vicious, disgusting, raw (3 times). \"Deathcrush\", \"Necrolust\", \"Buried by Time and Dust\" are at their most menacing and sick. Dead's performance isn't the best, but he can scream his lungs out and does an honest effort to sing the classics, that should be enough for you. Even the bass is distorted as fuck and every instrument collide onto each other to form a huge whirlwind of sound. WWWHOOOSSHHHH!!! That's exactly how \"Funeral Fog\" sound here. If you can't take the RAW, then get your hands onto something else.\n\nHighly recommended for those interested on the band Mayhem and real black metal in general. \"Only Death is real\". Yes, we all know. But, \"Are you DEAD?\" (with silly accentuation). Wow.\n",
        "\nAnd considering that I'm not much of a fan of Dead's wailing and screaming as much as I adore Attila Csihar's sick and original singing. Interpretation wise (everything but the vocals): this doesn't sound far away from DMDS, specially Pagan Fears which sounds VERY similar to it's final version. The Freezing Moon, however, sounds more \"natural\" without the excessive reverb on the drums, more aggressive, IMO.\n\nBesides this, the only recordings I heard featuring Dead are Live in Leipzig and a few rehearsals I downloaded from the net a long time ago. These two songs feature the vocalist at his best: sick, furious, dark, evil sounding. For a lack of better comparison, a much more perverted sounding Nocturno Culto. \n\nIf you ever wondered the reason of Dead's myth, you should listen to this. Hell, he even surpasses Attila, which is not an easy task. De Mysteriis would have sounded much more killer if all the songs came from this sessions.\n"
