        "\nDark, progressive, dense, elaborated, epic, deep, surprising, atmospheric, risky, long, mature, heterogeneous, complex, powerful, unexpected, serious... They are all valid but insufficient adjectives to describe A Matter Of Life And Death. This album is the reincarnation of the innovative spirit of Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son in the current century; it has songs in the kind of Powerslave technicity, inherits the sobriety of The X-Factor, houses rhythms and hymns in the Brave New World vibe, and certainly goes a step further than Dance Of Death.\n\nIt's an arduous task to strip myself of veteran fanaticism in pursuit of objectivity when it comes to this group, but I'm being rigorous when I say that A Matter Of Life And Death is an excellent, profitable, and recommendable album from the beginning to end. Of course, this is not an easy album to listen to, is not also capable of fully convincing at the first attempt as it confirms their sound movement to progressive paths as we have never seen since then. This change towards more progressive paths was shown in Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son and then those first glimpses were perpetuated in their following installments until accentuated in Brave New World, expanded in Dance Of Death, and reached a climax in this one with the characteristic long songs, well-developed songwriting, complex instrumental passages and serious, committed lyrics. This album invites you to delve into it, to discover its infinity of details as manages to arouse more curiosity the more it's listened to. This is diverse and surprising as it seemed unthinkable to their ever-known sound, and this time it's expanded in a performance where their most hidden corners have been explored without losing an iota of their essence.\n\nThis album sits almost permanently at mid-paced, with sparks of speed and an odd show of forcefulness. It took the band's differential aspects to the extreme while the chord stretches up in order to give it the ambient. The slow moments are truly the slowest, most atmospheric, darkest ones they've ever recorded, and you can note it in the intros of These Colors Don't Run, Brighter Than A Thousand Suns, The Reincarnation Of Benjamin Breeg, Out Of The Shadows, The Longest Day, and For The Greater Good Of God. Tracks like the mysterious Lord Of Light or The Legacy magnify such a feeling a step further. In these examples there are precisely the exaggerated characteristics like the highly progressive instrumental cuts where we find unexpected surprises such as the interlude in Out Of The Shadows, completely different from what Maiden used to play.\n\nThis album is an enemy of hits, understood as short singles with singalong/jumping choruses for live shows. Different World is the exception as opens the album deceptively, transmitting optimism and joy, being the most accessible song in addition to its similar vibe to The Wicker Man. However, the whole album conception is quite different as is announced by The Reincarnation Of Benjamin Breeg, which is unfortunately the only one that Murray contributes here.\n\nSpecial mention should be made of Dickinson's vocals, successful in applying the most appropriate accent to convincingly express the lyrics he recites, which are backed up with the surprising exploration of unpublished tones so far. This fact is more than evident in the songs he has contributed, risking with his vocal cords where his palpable contribution brings them closer to a more typical sound of his solo project. However, Bruce is not the only one who manages to transmit these allegations to terrorism, war, and religion. The entire band are able to convey the same feelings, to set situations with a slow down or to cause a stampede on their rising riff. A clear example is The Longest Day, which transports you to the Norman beaches living the restlessness prior to disembarkation, as well as suffering the troop advances on D-Day.\n\nRegarding the production, there will be opinions for all tastes. I have a conflictive feeling. In my opinion, it is too linear, direct, and shallow to host this sort of content. On the other hand, this aspect can get good results, by not overloading such a dense album. It's really true that drums and bass stand out too much at some point, while vocals and some solos are too hidden, but overall it isn't a so exaggerated aspect to detract from the album. Without a doubt, A Matter Of Life And Death is as risky as its title warns and it\u2019s recommended for any fan who followed their evolution and doesn't deny Dance Of Death or the post-Birch sound. This is advisable for progressive music lovers who looked askance at the band.\n\nI know there are people who found A Matter Of Life And Death a boring album. But it seems an excellent, really unexpected album at this point in their career. It'll be hated or revered as is often the case with anything they produce, there's practically no room for indifference and compromise. With all that in consideration, I'm joining the veneration right now, which I've gladly settled in after several listens.\n",
        "\nThe British Iron Maiden, which has been in existence for 47 years, is one of the greatest legends of heavy metal music, and is also widely regarded as the biggest British metal band. It is perfectly understandable that we all have high expectations of true classics of music. Fans had to wait six long years for the Senjutsu album. Was it worth it, though, is Iron Maiden still able to live up to its legend and reputation? These questions probably troubled millions of supporters of the British formation from the very beginning. On September 3, 2021, a two-disc publication was released on store shelves, decorated with the characteristic image of the group's mascot - Eddie, by Mark Wilkinson. Of course, the album became a world bestseller, reaching the tops of 24 charts, and it also garnered extremely positive reviews. So how does the last Maiden album look like after more than ten months from the premiere? \n\nHonestly speaking - I was afraid of this effort. After reviewing the list of just ten compositions, the total time of which is 82 minutes, I felt something like a bit of consternation. For many years, Iron Maiden has accustomed their audience to multi-threaded, long songs that aspire to be progressive, but once again the band presented the audience with a challenge that not everyone is able to cope with. The album Senjutsu (in Japanese the title means strategy / combat tactics) is an album showing metal veterans as creators who have not yet fully said their last word. We have everything fans expect from them: sophisticated melodies, Dickinson's vocals, Harris bass parades, great guitar solos duels, excellent work of the rhythm section. In other words - the best that is and has always been with this band. Also noteworthy are the flavors that were extremely rare or never appeared in the band's work. The single, mid-tempo The Writings on the Wall surprises with Southernian themes and blues feeling, Time Machine is both progressive and hitting, in Darkest Hour we have an extremely solemn atmosphere and an almost classically blues solo by Adrian Smith. The complex, longest composition on the album, The Parchment begins like Ravel's Bolero to move on to slightly oriental riffs. A lot can be written about the individual compositions that fill the two CDs of the album. But why do this? However, it is impossible not to mention the fantastic, extensive Hell on Earth, which closes the album. Only Irons can create such emotions and this drama! \n\nAlso noteworthy are the pensive texts of individual compositions, which probably more than ever encourage reflection on the meaning of existence and the situation of the world, which seems to be heading towards the inevitable catastrophe. Only faith in a better tomorrow and hope for the awakening of mankind can save us from inevitable doom. Yes, Senjutsu is an album full of bitter reflection and even a kind of sarcasm. It is also an album the listener will need a little more time to appreciate. Certainly, those who expect the next batch of heavy metal noise will not (and were) not satisfied with it. But Iron Maiden has almost always been about more than just heavy metal. \n\nSo does the reviewed album have any disadvantages? Of course, there are several of them. First, let me talk about technical issues. Unfortunately, I am not convinced by the mix of this material, for which Kevin Shirley was responsible. Bruce Dickinson seems to be on the very first line once and the second next time, and so are the guitars. The producer of the band mentioned that he encountered some difficulties while working on this material and it can be heard that he probably did not always cope with them. Another drawback of the album is the excessive stretching of certain motifs, especially in the introductions to longer compositions. If they were to be shortened by a minute, the whole thing would be more neat. I could also write that Bruce Dickinson doesn't sing like he used to do 20 or 30 years ago. Remember that this is the first album recorded after the singer's fight with cancer, and the years of throating in arenas and stadiums have also done their job. Senjutsu is not Iron Maiden's vocal magnum opus, but also a cause for shame. \n\nIn summary, the fans received music that they will be able to enjoy after two years of being taken from the world by a pandemic, which arouses emotions and causes various reactions. We received an album showing the 47-year-old band as not entirely fulfilled and still full of some fresh ideas. As I said, Iron Maiden were never just another metal band, they always went beyond the rough genre pattern and thank them for that. I'm just curious how this material will turn out live? So far, we have heard only the first three compositions that are to be a foretaste of the album tour. I can't wait and you?!\n",
        "\nThere are bands that you cannot judge by general standards since they have set their own standards. This is why they enjoy being \"the titan\" or \"the giant\" band in the metal scene, but also the reason they face the most violent demise when they can't decide where to stop. Iron Maiden still is the no.1 top-class metal band that has ever existed on this planet no doubt, especially if we take the long 10 year period between 83 and 93 into account, the time they exposed their fans to constant and intense thrashing without mercy by throwing nine albums (seven studio and two live - Real Live/Dead One omitted) one after another that were worth a whole discography each. But since 1995, with The X Factor, Maiden began to suck, with Virtual XI they sucked more and by Brave New World they had become Charlotte The Harlot themselves. By releasing Dance Of Death, they are turning the copyright holder of many albums, The Iron Maiden Holdings, into 22 Acacia Avenue. This obduracy has led me to reject them vehemently. Don't get me wrong, I didn't like them at first. Little by little I was immersing myself in the turbulent waters of reality and I had no choice but to assume that this IS Maiden today. Perhaps that helped a bit, and albums like Brave New World and The Book of Souls overcome my misgivings.\n\nI think I got saturated with progressive metal. There was a time when it was the only genre I listened to, but there are sooo many bands, and there are so many other styles I love that it's impossible to cover everything. In the end I have stayed with the most similar: Dream Theater, Opeth, Symphony X and some more. Occasionally I use to venture into something new. But, it turns out that there are bands that manages to deliver a mixed bag of short heavy metal with long epics with the deserved \u201cprog\u201d label. Vektor is not the band with huge personality in the prog thrash scene, but they have details I like and they don't bore me outrageously like this band has been doing since 1995! With Cannibal Corpse I have tried several times but they never satisfied me precisely because I had listened to other bands that practiced the same style before and I like them better (Suffocation, Crytopsy, Benighted), and because still not entirely convinced by Barnes's vocals. Brutal Death is a genre in which I don't play too much, really. The three bands I've mentioned are the ones I hold in the highest regard, and I've barely felt the need to look further into them.\n\nI have nothing against the fans who enjoy their new stuff, and yes, the title of my review emphasizing how people keep getting fooled (or the once imperative title) was just a warning back then. There must be a tipping point that explains what the hell these guys have become. It's not much science my friend! I only know them by name, they aren\u2019t a saint of my devotion since I see that their pompous heavy metal is a style that never attracts me so much. For me, when heavy metal loses sight of aspects such as the hook, the technique, the melody or those things that make it more pleasant to my ears and concentrates on the punctual, it loses all the grace. For me, this century\u2019s classic heavy metal is the one I like the most and Accept, although they\u2019re not very original, are an amalgamation of bands I worship the most. They have their personal touch, they are quite technical, they add good melodies and some less conventional details. Of course, their style results interesting for fans of Satan, Running Wild, Rage, Borrowed Time, Brocas Helm and other bands of similar sound.\n\nJust take the above into consideration, and see what Iron Maiden are. The thing that sickens me most is the never-ending intros of tracks. A clean guitar begins the music, and sometime later Bruce Dickinson accompanies it, but they go on tingling there for minutes but still no hint on where the hell the fucking song may be. They wait until you begin to crawl in stomachache and then unleash the most boring, incompetently imitated Iron Maiden riffs one after one (well, those \"one\"s take a long time to end, anyway). This is what they call Maiden's new style, but a combination of new generation, depthless, standard music and poorly imitated old Maiden riffs cannot be considered a new style, a new direction, or a new whatever it is.\n\nI don't understand the emotion and enthusiasm of those who consider it a work of art, I would like to do an astral projection and explore their heads just to feel the same as them when they listen to this album and the others. I want to know what is the pristine, progressive, and powerful matter they find in their discs. And regarding the members, well, might be because of his age, or his loss of excitement, or the music itself, Nicko seems to have lost his energetic drumming and transformed into a standard drummer, even abandoning his trademark alien rhythms. Bruce Dickinson's voice is still good considering the general music scene, but music scene comparisons don't apply in this case. This is Iron Fucking Maiden, as Dickinson says. My thinking can be uncomfortable but I don't want to fall into the demagoguery of saying what people want to read. I always thought that IM is not only an indestructible machine, unique and unrepeatable but also part of our DNA, it is indissociable, but the \"end is always getting closer\" is a bit annoying, because that's the overall feeling they leave on every album.\n\nBut what disappoints me the most is guitar work. Here is where starts the solos getting more and more automatic, with just a few quality strokes from Smith and not much else. Murray is almost lost and Gers always playing his own erratic and imprecise solos. Those riffs simply don't have that kind of vibration within, the one we know well from the 1983-1993 era. Production is also bad, whose layers are not well achieved as in the previous, and the drum sound is less professional and sounded more modern in Brave New World. Though Bruce's voices were placed on an easier plane to enjoy, something that hasn't happened since the next album where his voice is overwhelmed by the sound spectrum. Getting old is no excuse, if you are old just quit it. This is not what people are expecting, and when you cannot meet expectations, you go, that's the rule everywhere. Few releases later the Iron Maiden logo won't be enough for many highly adaptive fans out there, and the violent demise I have mentioned earlier will take place in the form of \"one of the lamest NWOBHM albums ever\". There is a lot of difference between \"You remember Maiden? They fucked us up\", and \"Do you remember Maiden? They fucked it up\". Well, Maiden has obviously fucked \"it\" up. Since 1995 they have released irregular records, from which I only rescued some tracks but they still denote a great down in ideas and songwriting level; any comparison with their first seven discs is witless and it's something I've seen for as long as I can remember.\n\nThe proof is that I only played Senjutsu twice since I bought it. I admit I usually buy Maiden records for collector reasons and not for true devotion. Brave New World was an album I hated a lot, but over the years and without being it a marvel, I admit it is at least half good. You do notice the air of greatness in this one as soon as you hear it: there is energy, strength, and maturity as it advances slightly. Even Shirley's production, which didn't convince me at the time, sounds vigorous now, only because of all the bad things they've done afterward. Though being a song of extreme repetition both musically and lyrically, Rainmaker shines as the pearl within the shitty mud that Dance Of Death is, and can even be inserted somewhere in the playlist that contains The \"True\" Iron Maiden. Beyond I have written first that Rainmaker is the good thing about the album, it's fine. And do you know why it's fine? Because Iron Maiden is no longer a band, but a registered trademark, so get rid of this, and without modesty!\n",
        "\nThe best thing about Maiden is their fans... that's very clear. If you are not a very, very, very big fan (in which Harris belches and you applaud) it's impossible you think that their latest discs are bad. I dare say their reviews are actually better than the music. I just can't assimilate it, saving two songs Senjutsu is a true epitome of boredom and the ego of these guys: predictable, eternal, hookless, no great choruses, no great melodies, no classics. There are songs that never seem to end seriously and they repeat, repeat, and repeat themselves. Since they came back with Bruce, excepting Brave New World (and perhaps TBOS) without being this a marvel, their new style, progressive, melodic or whatever you want to call it, seems boring to me. Choruses like Can I Play With Madness are missing up, and for the record, I criticized that song a lot without realizing it was a real gem. No one would imagine that they became Iron Maiden\u2122. Boring, monotonous, and Dickinson, come on, the way he sings is just unbearable to me.\n\nIt's amazing how easy it is for some to give opinions and go coherent through life. First things first: if every new record of Maiden, Priest, Metallica, AC/DC, Mot\u00f6rhead, Scorpions, or any big-name from the 70s/80s is released, if a new band released a similar one no one would listen to them probably. But it can't be seen this way, because the context can influence. Yes, I mentioned Judas Priest my friend, because Firepower is another overrated album, when it was barely an improvement over Redeemer of Souls. Second, expecting Maiden to make records like the 80s is simply impossible; to begin with, because their great classics are already recorded, and because \"it has never been the norm for Harris and his boys to stay in a closed archetypal scheme and without freshness throughout their lives, just as they aren't one of those bands who release an album and put just two new songs on the setlist when touring\"... Yeah, I've heard enough of that, and what comes after? Their fans say that the misunderstanding of many about their musical line has an easy solution... don't listen to them anymore. I didn't like Judas Priest's direction on the last two albums (not even talking about what they did with Owens), but I respect their work because they are who they are, and I'm not saying that Priest's latest stuff are shit nailed to a stick, a stump, or whatever. And the same could be said of other consolidated bands.\n\nGhost Of Navigator and The Red And The Black alone are better than the whole Senjutsu, but if I have to choose: Stratego, Days of Future Past and The Time Machine. The rest seems very long and repetitive to me, and many vocal lines just follow the guitar lines, that is a lack of work and a very big infringement. I miss the melody, the joy, those great solo duels of yesteryear, and so. Harris should give Bruce more freedom to sing or do more upbeat stuff like on TBOS, or if he wants to keep the dark aura, well, at least make them faster. I am stubborn? Sorry Iron Maiden components if you are reading me and sorry to all their fans for saying I find this album boring. I have to admit that envy has taken over me and made me write these barbarities. I apologize from the bottom of my heart and I promise I will never utter such a string of outrages again... (Ironic mode off) I don't really care what position they reached, but better for them if they still can sell because their efforts are not in vain. They still retain a loyal fan base. Then at the concerts what happens happens, it's another story: they play the eighties classics and the reaction is imminent, the high is given and people sing the songs. But when they play endless songs from the latest albums: general indifference and low spirits. Do we draw conclusions or do I have to make a sketch for you? This album is as alive as a stone.\n\nI'm not going to get into silly comparisons with video games or puerile sayings. As for the album, it seems musically acceptable, though methodically petty. They are Maiden for sure and songs like Days of Future Past are proof that we can ask them for more than just a set of cut-and-paste of the last twenty years. Nothing extraordinary happens, they have settled down themselves a lot and they always play with the same method, that is, the members know each other inside out and that's why they record directly without preparing or rehearsing as they have done since Dance of Death. To say that they deserve praise for that is debatable, but they have spent half their career taking advantage of the BNW formula in a too brazen way. I think it's time for them to create something with its own entity (The Book of Souls was very close to this) as a final seal to an unmatched career, although stained.\n\nThe Book of Souls almost comes close to the decency of Brave New World yet both albums were barely half good. At this point they no longer have to prove anything, because their legacy is there, visible to everyone, but it seems that with each new creation the only thing they do is respond to themselves, not to people who are really looking for dazzling material. It's just another excuse to buy their beer, t-shirts, or any expensive accessory; and the fans are convinced just because they pay for a record or a concert ticket then they become small owners of everything this band do. And then, it seems quite cheeky to criticize Iron Maiden's albums and then praise other albums that may also arouse no kind of interest. For the derision of many, Judas Priest and Scorpions are also over, not only this band.\n\nIt isn't another album that reflects the permanent search or the exploration outside the limits without abandoning the Maiden essence. No way. My message to the Up the Irons-Men is to keep calm, I'm not being derogatory or hysterical with you. If the disc looks like a brick to me, I can say it, right? And if you didn't like Judas Priest or Scorpions, say so with no fear too. I don't expect Maiden to release records like the eighties, but they could manufacture at least decent records, period, without following the line of boring and soporific musicality. And inspiration is conspicuous by its absence. You don't have to be old to know what I'm talking about. Even if you are young you have enough knowledge to know when a song asks for one thing or another. This album seems like a half-polished jewel, with a lot of wadding, poorly worked rhythms, and exaggeratedly slow tempos, and I guess that a lot of drama is lost on these songs for this reason.\n",
        "\nThis is a somewhat mature version of their songwriting in the last years. This release won't conquer the listeners who simply don't understand their latest evolution which in essence defines those majestic (yet not flawless though) compositions that change traditional formulas for cinematic experiences. Considering that, the band advance and write another page that is an essential volume in this music understood as culture. The last three songs that last 34 minutes are a baroque whim of Harris, so he openly tells that we must take his style or leave it. All the interaction between one and other instruments can be enjoyed in a solid way. It has no commercial sound, although it's digestible and listenable at most. The strange, dark ending which sums up the last three songs takes a more interesting terrain: the heroic and gallant Death of the Celts with its friendly and fierce vibe; the closer epic Hell On Earth, another classic impossible to ignore; and perhaps the somewhat flawed aspect that The Parchment is, while it has Powerslavesque sound, I can't help but think that if Maiden went to a more arid territory that The Nomad from Brave New World was, I would enjoy it more. I mean, The Parchment sounds like a song running in dim light, it's like you slow down Powerslave to 0.75 speed. Of its 12 minutes, literally, the first 10 minutes are mid-paced and it only speeds up in the last 2 minutes. If we talk about a song that Steve Harris penned alone, the same who wrote The Red And The Black on the previous album, he's still owed me here. If The Parchment were faster we would be talking about a fast-paced piece that would urgently nourish a disc two full of ballads.\n\nThe music takes an exceptional rhythm base, with good performances of the always discreet McBrain and the golden assault of the three leads. Besides Harris' formulaic writings and the two ones he wrote with Janick and one with Adrian, there Adrian wrote three songs with Dickinson as if it was a once outlawed alliance, and the rocker, straightforward tracks have some well-fitting memory of Bruce's brilliant solo career. Meanwhile, Gers is capable to play those harmonies along with the darker solemnity of the bass lines, unleashing notably in that ending with three stops and 34 minutes of interesting music, perhaps relegating The Parchment as background music instead of an Iron Maiden song. Being Harris the songwriter and without Birch's suggestions, you can't expect anything else from a historical musician who stopped caring about certain things before many of his current followers were born, as he's 65 years old and has no interest in sailing in warm waters. His stubbornness served as an ethical safeguard in the band and it worked at some moments, but they need a new producer who can tell him NO occasionally. Stubbornness isn't a trait that improves over the years and it's strongly attached to the personality over time.\n\nThe sound is a beating in terms of gallop, yet I couldn't say it comes down to a talent matter because Shirley doesn't take credit for the good songwriting and consistency of the songs, and he was never a producer who performed well in certain points. The band actually play with agitated energy and insist on those overpowering keyboard layers that are hard to digest but are part of the sauce. It's an astonishingly diaphanous proposal that requires patience, and it's like a banquet that provokes dyspepsia with irretrievable consequences. No rapid digestion is allowed, the music forces you to the sonic immersion and demands before rewarding you. It's a game about fewer accessible sing-along hymns and more musical corners to delve into carefully. But in the midst of these complex songs and a more accessible first side, Days Of Future Past works as a digestif and decompressor in the middle of a record where Darkest Hour takes over, another dark gem a la Wasting Love where Bruce acts like a master of ceremonies over an emotional and majestic cadence. In terms of lyrics, it is one of those well-crafted war stories that also delve into the usual topics as always (war, history, legend, science fiction). Of Harris' four penned tracks, the one that sympathetically convinces me is Death Of The Celts as is impossible not to see it like The Clansman 2.0, despite its delicious sensation of mystery and the much-to-decode in the guitar leads. Gers' visible contribution in The Time Machine is a fine mutation evocative of To Tame A Land and The Edge Of Darkness, both in terms of tempo and the optimistic/dark mood that surrounds it.\n\nIt isn't loaded with fast-paced and happy folkish melodies like the previous release, and it neither looks like a dated album like The Final Frontier. Passing through Blaze's irregular sketches until Bruce's gradual return, The Book Of Souls improved The Final Frontier, therefore Senjutsu improved The Book Of Souls. It's the darkest thing they have recorded and seems like a demonstration of what Bruce Dickinson would sound like on the two Blaze albums. It's like a trip back in time where they recreate an assorted collage of their music but with an obvious emphasis on what their sound has been like since the reunion. It carries the adventurous narrative of The Book Of Souls, and the dark complexity of A Matter Of Life And Death. I comprehend there's no reason to applaud with anxiety everything this band do, but it deserves to be discussed that it's common knowledge that they are the AC/DC of heavy metal, and even in flawed points like The Parchment I still consider it a piece of enjoyable background music. These guys are just good at making music.\n\nThe overall dark mood is kind of predominant and it's less accessible than its twin raven A Matter of Life and Death. Perhaps at the time of the release my statement could be considered hasty and fanboy-ish, that's why I had to correct some points and conclude that this album has two weak points: the aforementioned The Parchment... and Stratego, a prolific song ruined by an underdeveloped production, although without keyboards that problem would be almost imperceptible. The Final Frontier was basically a catastrophe and over time I appreciated it more, although it's still one of their weakest efforts. The Book Of Souls amazed me because I celebrated that the creative well was far from dry. Senjutsu actually flirts with the pernicious facet of the excessive style that this band embraced long ago, and defies any conventional musical direction. People who haven't liked their latest albums won't go to change their minds with this one, but those who have connected with their music have time ahead to dissect it. The keyboards enrich the soul of some songs but sometimes the bad ideas are not entirely absent, so I reiterate, my only complaint is the production that ruins the brilliant Stratego, and The Parchment, which drags on too much but still works as background music and not as a genuine song of theirs.\n",
        "\nI've never been so pleased, yet simultaneously disappointed with an album release. A lot of folks have complained about the production of this record, but as somebody whose favorite Maiden release is their first, I wasn't personally bothered by it. In fact, I can appreciate the sounds of the drums, even if Nicko could have probably used an espresso before recording. There's some good and bad here. The members have clearly aged in this record, but they don't stumble completely.\n\nDisc 1 of this album is pretty solid. Not as good as Fear of the Dark or Somewhere in Time, but good all the same. It actually felt like somebody in the band was telling Harris that maybe these tracks shouldn't be so long, sort of. Length and pacing are still something of an issue. Time Machine, an otherwise solid track, really did not need the acoustic intro and outro. Lost in a Lost World was probably the only real dud in disc 1. Other than that, the tracks were solid.\n\nDisc 2, however, is a different story. Hell on Earth is perhaps the only track that's even somewhat decent, and even that track do with a trim. It's not that these tracks are long; it's that they are poorly paced. I have heard half-hour black metal tracks that didn't drag like this. Maiden has had this issue for a good while, where they clearly want to duplicate the success of tracks like Alexander the Great or Rime of the Ancient Submariner, but have no idea what made those tracks great. I cannot tell you how tired I got of tracks like The Parchment or Death of the Celts. The solos seem to go on forever, and it never actually goes anywhere. I'd go so far as to say that it's worse than A Matter of Life and Death.\n\nIron Maiden seem to almost get it, but fall short in one way or another. Really, I think the problem is Kevin Shirley, whom many agree to be more of Steve Harris' yes-man than his producer. Harris is a visionary, but even visionaries need to be reeled in from time to time. Martin Birch ensured that Maiden's records from '81-'92 would be legendary, and I'm sure he and Harris had some disagreements. But in the end, though, we all won. We need someone who isn't just going to worship the floor Maiden walk on; they're not being held to much of a standard, so that's the standard they're living up to.\n",
        "\nIt's true that this album is objectively and obviously several steps above its predecessors in terms of quality and ambition, but in my opinion, the only one that can be compared to this effort is The X Factor. Moreover, there's a certain consensus in putting Blaze's albums as the worst of their career ever, two albums that I do agree are especially weak, but in my opinion, The X Factor is well above the general mediocrity which their nineties albums are usually placed in. I make this note before entering the field of Brave New World, an album that deserves a cover letter to go back to its origins. To further emphasize the leap into the past that this album represents, both this Eddie and those that appear on the covers of the singles \"The Wicker Man\" and \"Out of the Silent Planet\" represent a clear return to the image of the epic, futuristic and abstract epics that illustrated their classic works. The lyrics also experienced a rather radical return in this sense, moving from social problems and other banal day-to-day concerns to fantasy, historical and literary themes that made them great in the mid-eighties. At this point, these guys were really serious about coming to terms with many of the traits that had made them giants.\n\nAdrian and Bruce are back, fine, but what about the dancer Janick Gers? Well, he entered in 1990 and since then he came to stay, and today he's still an important part of the spirit and personality of the band despite the hate he gets from some fans as they see him as more of a buffoon than a guitarist. Obviously, his style is dirtier than that of the elegant, precise Adrian, but beyond his evident quality as an instrumentalist, I think Janick's antics are charming and he really seems like a nice guy. I think that the game of the three guitars shone the most on this record, that may be a point in its favor but there are small factors that intervene and make this belongs below Dance of Death. Really, the three leads have some stellar moments and neatness that take their work to a new level. The base follows the same line with Harris more rugged, while the octopus McBrain, without being valued as he deserves, shows that he's one of the best classic drummers we can appreciate. And this is when I really have to talk about those who dismiss this guy for not using double bass drums. When they don't know what to say they resort to ad hominem fallacies and say he doesn't move his lazy butt. They don't notice that Nicko prefers the Heel-Toe, which is an old school jazz technique that allows him to make the bass drum sound as if they were two, with only one foot and executing a more complex hi-hat, and also because he couldn't execute the ride-snare combination on his own. Also with double bass drums, Maiden's style would change, especially with the bass.\n\nThe disc begins with a blow of force and dynamism. It's not exactly one of my favorite songs, and even after listening to the two openers of Dance of Death, I saw The Wicker Man as an expendable song. I feel it lacks \"something\" to finish being completely convincing, but I also think it's a perfectly correct track with some passages as brilliant as we've always been accustomed to. Both the opener and Out of the Silent Planet acted as singles and spearheads, and the latter has always been one of the most underestimated songs, standing as perhaps the greatest symbol of the progression and epicness that this album enjoys. It is true that the opener can be simple if we take as reference what they would do in the next years, but listening today it seems a fun, danceable, catchy, well-instrumented song with a more than remarkable choruses, although Out of the Silent Planet seems to bring back the spark of their golden years.\n\nBased on short and entertaining songs (this is the only album of the reunion where at least three songs have 4 minutes), we almost arrive at the second half in which we find more or less the same thing that we have seen since the Blaze era: well-constructed songs with epic nuances that show the most delicate (and not rough and scratchy) version of this band with more acoustic sections, synths, trumpets, kaleidoscopic melodies, among others. The Fallen Angel is my personal weakness as its fast-paced, sinuous approach has always seemed very attractive to me. People have a certain dislike for their long songs but I think they will be delighted with this one, and while I'm not classifying it as a masterpiece either, I can agree that it isn't the strong point of the album exactly. But as a whole it's a remarkably infectious song with more than interesting instrumentation with lots of hooks and especially inspired solos. The general opinion tends to condemn the title track, considering Brave New World as one of the repetitive moments, and while it is structurally fine to repeat the chorus four times, it certainly extends over and over again.\n\nAnother of the most stellar moments on the album are the epics The Nomad and The Thin Line Between Love And Hate, with a profusion of 100% Maiden melodies and a delicate spirit that magnificently alternates with brushstrokes of classic heavy metal, reminiscent of past glories and embryo of the great epics that we will find in the following albums. Contrary to the inattention typical of the past, or perhaps due to the demands of the script, on this album Bruce's voice is shown better, equaling or improving his aggressive and traditional air raid siren, and giving these songs unusual nuances. On the other hand, if someone thought that the keyboards were going to disappear from the band's music, they are wrong, because, in addition to the ambient/atmosphere provided by the keyboards, there are also extra elements such as the trumpets in The Nomad that give it the \u201czen\u201d touch in the middle section. Be that as it may, this is an excellent song with the potential to become much more than what the capricious and unfair underestimation has had in store for it. To say that The Nomad has middle-eastern patterns that evoke the Powerslave era is not a small thing really.\n\nAnother point worthy of discussion is the focus of this album. Some will say yes but no (or no but yes, depending on how you look at it). The modern production, the good acoustic passages, some very attractive melodies, and a general dynamism compensate for the inconvenient repetitive choruses. Although the modern sound has been developed since The X Factor, the use of resources that end up sounding monotonous and lacking in punch ends here, giving way to a more defined approach, perhaps evocative of the eighties but with a newly established identity which the following albums would derive from, with small variations. The three 4+ minute songs are the only posthumous contribution from classic Maiden, and curiously they are among the most eminent rocker song with interesting lyrics (it goes without saying this because they never fail in this sense), a nice 80s hard rock air \u2014both in composition and execution\u2014 and a quite fun groove. They are dynamic and endearing songs that will easily go down in their history. After the flat opener whose opening riff Maiden ripped off of Priest's Running Wild, certainly the crescendo that builds up since the second song objectively brings the best never-ending moments you'll find on the entire album.\n",
        "\nMany things changed after the overwhelming success of albums like Powerslave and Seventh Son of a Seventh Son. The 80s were a meteoric rise that turned these guys into one of the biggest bands on the traditional metal scene, and despite everything, it also brought with it increasingly iconic tours that made a dent in the mental, physical and functional stability of the band. As a result of this stress and growing musical differences, the guitarist Adrian Smith left the group after many iconic albums in which he contributed his unparalleled class and his particular compositional style, thus breaking the legendary lineup that had given them success thanks to timeless works that took them to the heavenliest plane of rock/metal world. That said, what merits does Dance of Death have to receive such a score? Why such an affront when it isn't an eighties effort? I say Jethro Tull because it's the band that most resembles Iron Maiden in the use of folk music on this album. Maybe they are used in other albums but it's much more prominent on this one. I could mention Uriah Heep, Yes, or Genesis, but Jethro Tull is the closest thing on this album when it comes to influences. There are those who are contemptuous and believe it's time for this band to play bagpipes and flutes because of how soft they sound. So for better or worse, I'm not that wrong.\n\nAfter the departure of Adrian and the dying years of the 90s, important changes took place within them. Without the opinion of the former guitarist, the band believed that the synthesizers and progressive dalliances they walked through in recent times had ceased to make sense in their proposal, so they recorded No Prayer for the Dying to make it rawer, direct, and eminently rocker than its predecessors. In musical terms, they believed they were on the right track until they decided to make a triumphant return in Brave New World, which is nothing more than a series of things patched up from those previous mistakes. Beyond the fact that we can appreciate that change more or less, and always keeping in mind the good eyes with which I look at it, I think that the main plus of this album is the abundance of indisputable singles and better-constructed epics, all of them with the potential to go down in memorability as a historical relic on a par with the eighty\u2019s classics. I appraise it as a very compact work that would possibly shine with outsized force if it were produced by Martin Birch, top and bottom, east and west, in every way if you will. If we compare it with the previous disc, for example, it is evident that there are no flawed songs like The Mercenary or the title track, so the songwriting here is kept at a much higher level and over time it was able to make it achieve a higher status.\n\nDelving into the content of the album, Wildest Dreams invites us to free ourselves emotionally to achieve our dreams. Perhaps compared to the previous album single, this one may be less appealing because the chorus is somewhat simple, but it far surpasses any lame single released in the 1990s. It gets better as you listen and the way the riffs are finished in terms of scale is from their typical school. The break in the middle part becomes more interesting as the guitars enter the background. It's a good start, not for nothing is the first single. Despite the weakness that many see in this single, I see it is a much more original cut with a melodic break that adds a lot of spice that makes it enjoyable; I still don't understand why many consider The Wicker Man superior to this being that it has a flatter structure with that opening riff taken from Priest's Running Wild. Anyway, I enjoy both songs, and the lack of one can be the strength of the other.\n\nRegarding the production, I find it quite peculiar and the most striking thing in the mix is the guitars. I could actually say that the guitars sounded \"fat\" in Brave New World but this album's real antagonist would be Seventh Son's guitars, because while in Seventh Son the guitars sound \"crystalline\" and \"slippery\" in your ears, in Dance of Death the riffs sound raw and have spines that literally scratch your ears. Then, you can find speed songs like Montsegur, which actually deals with the homonymous fortress and the massacres carried out by the Catholic Church against the Knights Templar; this got the heaviest riffs to start with accompanied by the totally aggressive vocals. The refrain \u201cat the gates and the walls of Monsegur, blood in the stones of the citadel\u201d can be disconcerting at first, as it is recited very quickly (you need lungs to do it) and at a fairly high pitch. But it has atypical structures even in details as simple as the choirs; followed by the chorus there is a kind of a second chorus in which a typically medieval riff stands out, then Bruce follows it with his voice at the same time. The medieval mystique and the folk scale \u2014that has never been heard in the 90s and has been heard in \"The Prophecy\" in the 80s\u2014 are heard in Montsegur.\n\nOnce again it is worth highlighting the solos by the guitarists, the galloping bass, and Nicko's imaginative drumming (perhaps the most inspired since Piece of Mind) which reaches its peak on the title track, the heart of the album. Here the narrative force of Harris appears accompanied by the peculiar style in which Dickinson narrates the story. He lyrically talks about a man wandering in the dark who is invited by ghostly figures to dance the dance of death, and who ends up wondering how he's still alive after that experience. Musically, it achieves a magical atmosphere thanks to the acoustic guitars and the help of the synthesizers. The song changes aspects when Bruce raises his tone which produces a small break and sounds like a melody with a medieval tint, increasing its speed in the final part. There are no choruses nor any verse that is repeated, then Dickinson follows the central riff with the voice at breakneck speed to close the story with a frightening feeling. In terms of vocal performance, most songs don't follow the melodic riffs/vocals pattern as if it were some kind of guide or help to the vocalist, instead, it feels like a more natural performance of conventional heavy metal than melodic Maiden properly.\n\nThe general flow is the best since their reunion, there are at least two songs per section where they offer a more rocker vein, like the first two singles, Face In The Sand/Age of Innocence, and Gates of Tomorrow/New Frontier. The last song has a great work by Nicko and Adrian Smith. This song talks about the danger of playing God and assuming uncontrolled powers. The chorus is very attractive, both because of Bruce's voice and because of the guitar melody that accompanies it. There is a great riff in the middle where the other guitars are intertwined, inspired by Spanish guitar melodies, which is also very popular and gives it a varied touch. This is the first song Nicko has written for the band, and although he's a good performer, his task as a composer has always been a great unknown, but he debuts with a good note. And by the way, we must add that no one would imagine that he was 51 with that double bass drum on Face In The Sand, another surprise with its beautiful intro that deceptively foreshadows something slow. What is also striking is the way Bruce sings in the pre-chorus where he reaches very high-pitched levels that give the sensation of reaching the limit. Probably the most underrated song that would work live very well, something noticeable in the choruses near the end of the song.\n\nJourneyman concludes as the third and last single that can also be described as a surprise since it's the first totally acoustic song they ever recorded, not to mention the orchestral arrangements that ornament here and there. Bruce gives a memorable lyrical performance. It doesn't have solos, electric riffs, great flourishes... but has a lot of feeling. One of the acoustic magnum opuses of the 2000s! It's quite a battle cry that will make you shake live and has a kind of \"subliminal message\" where Bruce whispers, which gives it a special touch. The title suits him very well since a kind of trip is recreated, where Bruce is the narrating partner and makes it totally clear that he knows what he wants, says what he wants, and nobody is going to change his mind. I conclude that Dance of Death is the best effort they have released in this century.\n",
        "\nIn the midst of a run of albums that seem to stretch songs and ideas just a bit too much, The Book of Souls seems to be Iron Maiden at the peak of their output and ability to create music that stands as exceptionally well-written and emotive enough to retain your attention despite the extremely long song lengths. I can say with full confidence that this is their best release since Seventh Son of a Seventh Son. With unparalleled riffs and melodies on this record that manage to stay consistent, it isn't really a competition with the exception of A Matter of Life And Death. Why do I hold The Book of Souls in such high regard? Well, right from the beginning of the opening track, it's noticeable that the band are now able to show fluent substance and fresh concepts without relying too much on over-repetition. If Eternity Should Fail is the perfect opener for this mammoth of a release, and it may be my favourite Iron Maiden song. The use of a flute and triumphant synths over a dramatic vocal delay effect immediately show the influence of the Mayans on this album's general theme. When the actual rhythm section kicks in, the track explodes into one of the absolute best examples of how Iron Maiden revolves a simple riff and gallop over amazing melodies. The chorus is excellent, the solos are amazing, and the spoken-word outro coupled with the acoustic guitar truly solidify If Eternity Should Fail as Iron Maiden finally nailing their ideas perfectly. \n\nWhile the rest of the album doesn't exactly match the perfection of the opener, this is to be expected. There is a surprising mix of shorter, catchier songs and longer, more ambitious songs on here, with Speed of Light and Death Or Glory acting as flashbacks to classics like Flight of Icarus and Tailgunner. These songs are admirable in that they show off great riffs with surmountable energy and a great atmosphere, adding to the songs' memorability. The production is very muddy, but the guitar tone has been severely improved, and there is a much wider range of dynamics with an EQ that gives each instrument more clarity. Steve Harris' performance in particular is a highlight, and while it's shocking that he only wrote one song, The Red And The Black, this track shows his skill as a bass player and composer. On the subject of this song, it is another highlight of the album, with an epic and consistent structure. Bruce's frantic vocals on this song, mimicking the guitar melody is utter perfection. Add a great wordless chorus to this, and you have a track that will be viewed in the same league as Rime of The Ancient Mariner and Hallowed By Thy Name in 10 years. \n\nWhile it does seem like the record's runtime is consistent with the massive gaps in quality between these songs, the music generally never falls below the standard of excellent, with the primary cause of this inconsistency being that the longer tracks naturally contain much more content, while the less grand songs definitely refrain from being filler, still nailing these key elements but in a more simplistic way. The album as a whole exudes a very heroic and powerful nature. With that being said, this is probably the only Iron Maiden album where the longer tracks exclusively are the highlights, but somehow the band manages to sustain this quality throughout songs that fall well over the 10 minute mark, and would be mind-numbing slogs had they been written at any other point in the band's career. There is an emphasis on rhythm in this album, the iconic gallop is present on every song and instead of the drums and bass following the lead guitars, it's something of the other way around.\n\nFeeling much less contrived than The Final Frontier, as well as featuring a major increase in the average tempo, there has definitely been rejuvenation in the writing process of the band's material. However, the closer and possibly the most iconic song on this record, Empire of The Clouds, is mostly slow. Just as If Eternity Should Fail was the perfect opener, the closer is perfect too. Empire of The Clouds is fitting as it symbolises Iron Maiden at the absolute peak of their progressive ideas and their most ambitious right at the end of their run of 2000s/2010s albums before Senjutsu would come along as a spanner in the works. Epic motifs and a prominent use of piano fill the 18 minute runtime of this song. The sheer scale of Empire of The Clouds in every aspect, from the lyrics to the huge dynamics to the constant change in atmosphere, make it a mind-blowing listen. The Book of Souls is amazing from start to finish, and while a few tracks overshadow the others, it proves to be one of the most interesting and thought-provoking metal albums ever made, never becoming boring despite being longer than the average film.\n",
        "\nThe Final Frontier is the anomaly of Iron Maiden's 21st century releases. Although it continues the trend of very long songs and passionate performances, there's a huge change in theme here, with a much less dark but still just as grand-sounding result, The Final Frontier should be appreciated for its great songwriting and sense of atmosphere, although it doesn't manage to carry as strong of an execution as its predecessors. Every track is fully fleshed out, even the shorter ones, but there is still a lack of direction sometimes, which causes a drop in quality as it's hard to follow the band's ideas, with an example being the awkward intro to El Dorado. In spite of this, they manage to keep it together most of the time, and incorporate all of the typical features of an Iron Maiden album. Satellite 15 usually catches a lot of flak for being too long and being a wasted build-up to the excellent title track, which I mostly agree with. It sets a nice creepy atmosphere but the song really should've been cut in half. However, the opening sinister melodies and crushingly heavy riffs over the looming rhythm are very enjoyable as it sounds like a completely different band is playing, giving the album some fresh ideas that I think they should've experimented with more.\n\nUnfortunately, after the title track kicks in, with its chorus repeats and power chord-ridden glory, the band falls back into the formula that they'd been following for a decade prior to this record. The majority of what you'll get with The Final Frontier is melodies ranging from decent to great; simple riffs, and a shitload of lyrics. Although this isn't close to Bruce Dickinson's best performance, you have to appreciate that there is a massive focus on the vocals here, more so than on past albums. There is a lot of straining, but most of the tracks are performed fine, with my only complaint being that the band implements overlong, melancholy and dragging sections too often. However, they manage to get it right with highlights such as Coming Home and When The Wild Wind Blows, both of which show that Iron Maiden can still write ballads with plenty of substance. Other tracks like Starblind use excellent clean guitars and keyboards to ornament the theme of space with a lot of atmosphere, as well as containing brilliant riffs that make this album worth its extremely long runtime. \n\nStill flexing progressive elements but with a more streamlined approach this time, many of the songs are well-structured in that they feature many twists over the core basic verse-chorus template, justifying their somewhat bloated lengths. Sometimes though, I do feel as though some of these middle sections and instrumental breaks should've been rewritten to be less redundant in places. Generally I feel like this is the weakest album that Iron Maiden have done since Virtual XI, because there are a lot of the inconsistencies even within the singular tracks; with an average song length of nearly 8 minutes a lot of the parts feel overdeveloped, as if there should be less content in the songs to make the substantial aspects more apparent. Take The Wicker Man for example, it has a very short solo/middle section between a simple verse-chorus structure, but is still a great song because there is a larger focus on the good parts, resulting in it being regarded as one of the best songs of Iron Maiden's post-Blaze era. If that was utilised in The Final Frontier, the album would have benefitted majorly instead of a constant use of long-winded instrumental sections that do little to improve the quality of the songs.\n\nAs for the production, it's slightly disappointing as the instruments sound quite muddy, and the vocals are buried sometimes. This doesn't necessarily ruin the songs, but I think they should've improved the mixing and given it more treble to improve the ambience. The Final Frontier is still worth a listen, but sadly there are some filler songs which should just be skipped, the most egregious of which being Isle of Avalon, featuring mediocre riffs pasted over a good-ish clean melody for 9 minutes. Don't listen to this expecting a return to the classic era of Iron Maiden, the band is still knee-deep in a primary focus on atmosphere and semi-successful progression at this point.\n",
        "\nContinuing the habit of very overlong songs filled with synths and many chorus repetitions, A Matter of Life And Death is the primary highlight of Iron Maiden's 2000s run of albums, due to combining the memorability and energy of Brave New World with the more passionate, drawn-out aspects of Dance of Death. This coupled with having the longest runtime of any Maiden album up to that point shows how the ambition and newfound maturity of the band peaked here. Firstly, the atmosphere on AMOLAD is identical to its two predecessors, as it follows the trend of live recordings, giving the record a raw sound which fits the songs well. The focal point is still on melody, with three lead guitarists and multiple colossal middle sections (see For The Greater Good of God) that sound fluid and very evocative. However, the ability to play good solos doesn't automatically make your music good, so the songwriting and overall execution of the material needs to be taken into account.\n\nWith this in mind, I will admit that the basis of the songs on this album is formulaic and repetitive. Almost every song is 7 minutes or longer, and each of them feature about 16-32 chorus repeats. Sometimes it does get ridiculous, and would easily get tiring when listening to record in full multiple times. That is the primary point of criticism from many people who dislike AMOLAD, and it's understandable if you're interested in a more simplistic, to-the-point approach or enjoy Iron Maiden's older music more. Despite this, I would say that the choruses on their own are strong enough to justify the length and repetition, similarly to Brave New World. The repetition is also rectified by how diversified the longer songs are in their tempo changes and massive fluctuations in dynamics, both of which are used to build tension, which is what makes these songs so great.\n\nThere are many examples of the band's newfound orchestral sound on tracks such as The Pilgrim, which is this album's equivalent of Iron Maiden's short singles that are noticeably more accessible than the rest of the record, along with Different World. Despite from this, The Pilgrim is relatively much darker and fits the theme of the album. The jovial melodies are still present, but there is a sinister undertone that carries the strength of the track. Juxtaposing this, exceptionally heavy songs such as Brighter Than A Thousand Suns and The Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg prove to be the highlights of AMOLAD, with the focus on the aforementioned tension building and the pure cohesion between the instrumentation and the vocals. With that being said, Bruce has some of his best performances on these songs, showing how well he's adapted to the general slower tempo of the band's more recent output.\n\nThe Legacy is probably my favourite track on the album because of how far it stretches the other songs' aspects and how it succeeds. The intro of the song particularly shows off a perfected atmosphere, with eerie synths and morbid acoustic chords. What's even more surprising about this track is that it was written by Janick Gers, who is usually seen as a throwaway member of Iron Maiden. A Matter of Life And Death is a much darker take on a modern sound, and consequently it stands as Iron Maiden's best release since the 80s. Instead of trying to capture their classic sound, the band went the complete opposite direction and still managed to create another masterpiece.\n",
        "\nI'll admit, while Dance of Death wasn't quite as good as its predecessor and has almost always ranked among the worst Iron Maiden albums for me, there's no denying that this is an excellent album. Simply put, it took the grandiose and drawn-out aspects of Brave New World and excelled in them, while unfortunately sacrificing some of the musical adequacy that made that album so amazing. To exemplify this, keyboards fill the bulk of virtually every track on Dance of Death. This shows that there is a heavier focus on atmosphere while holding back the riffs slightly, which is similar to Seventh Son of A Seventh Son as I mentioned in my review for that record. Utilising atmosphere definitely isn't a bad thing for Iron Maiden, since they've proven time and again that they can pull it off extremely well. Dance of Death has a unique, almost romantic sound to it that is absent from the rest of Iron Maiden's discography, which is complemented by this heavy use of keyboards, and in my opinion it results in the album having an amazing quality to it.\n\nHowever, the guitars haven't been completely neglected. This is Iron Maiden after all, the melodies as always are stunning, even more so considering the tone on this record which is more dry, but also more fluid and gives the performances more clarity, such as in the iconic intro of Rainmaker. Rainmaker in general is a supposedly standard song by the band at first, but the unorthodox motifs consequently make it one of the more polarising tracks in the band's discography. When I mentioned earlier that Dance of Death excels on a grand sound, this is actually undermined by the first two songs. These are short and to-the-point, and could easily fit on No Prayer For The Dying, Fear of The Dark or even Piece of Mind. With this in mind, I think that the band should've picked one of the longer songs as the opener, leaving the shorter and therefore less characteristic (relative to the rest of the album) songs in the middle of the runtime, especially since the rest of the record is exclusively 5-minute-or-longer, which does become very exhausting without breaks.\n\nNow, onto why Dance of Death kicks ass. The epic sound is on full display here, whether it be the eastern-sounding intro of No More Lies, the life-changing middle section of the title track, or the generally captivating atmosphere of Paschendale. Keyboards mesh with layered lead guitar tracks on top of the constant gallop of the rhythm section. While this can become monotonous, it's kept fresh by the very progressive nature of the songwriting (I'm not claiming that Iron Maiden is in any way a progressive band, but their 2000s material is undoubtedly very long and spontaneous in structure, ignoring the endlessly repeating choruses of course). As far as performances go, I think that this was the first Iron Maiden album to be recorded live. Taking this into account, each member is playing their heart out, and the instruments come together in perfect cohesion, most obviously on Face In The Sand, which is the best song on the record hands down for my money. The looming drums match flawlessly with the droning, ambient guitar effects and Bruce' vocals are mesmerising and passionate. \n\nOn the topic of the vocals, Bruce Dickinson manages to continue to hit insanely high notes on Dance of Death, as well as showing some of the most durable and powerful projection in his career, at least in the 21st century. For example, in Journeyman, another amazing song, he pulls off melodies in the chorus that could make anyone cry. Despite this, he does strain a noticeable amount on this album, more than before. Production-wise, this record is strong. As I stated previously, the guitar tone is fluid, and this is couple with the clear, ride-heavy drums. The keyboards are way up front in the mix with the bass, contributing to the grandness of the album. Iron Maiden are often criticised for the more raw production of their later albums, due to the live recordings and the somewhat half-assed management of Kevin Shirley, but I think it works well here to encapsulate the band's ideas and adjustment to a modern sound without being overproduced like a lot of projects of the same style.\n\nSo, Dance of Death is an anomaly in the Iron Maiden catalogue in that it manages to be creative and ambitious like its predecessor, but in different ways, utilising a more laid-back approach to the music to make room for the huge emphasis on memorable atmosphere. It's a great record and one that deserves praise not for being a step outside of the band's comfort zone, since it's pretty much in the vein of Iron Maiden's signature sound, but because it still managed to result in a lot of brilliant songs that are relatively unusual. Don't mistake the long song-lengths and repetition of lyrics for boredom, this album is a very rewarding experience.\n",
        "\nWith some slight lineup changes resulting in a colossal six-man lineup that the band has retained until now, Iron Maiden returned with somewhat of a return to their more triumphant-sounding 80's output. The band proves this immediately with the opening song on Brave New World, The Wicker Man. This song encapsulates everything good about Iron Maiden, but unfortunately this isn't retained throughout most of this record. See, despite being considered a comeback album with a classic lineup, Brave New World is an indication of the beginning of Iron Maiden's adventure into more progessive tendencies. Bear in mind, this isn't the mind-bending, Watchtower-esque style of progressive, but the long-winded and somewhat bloated style of progressive. This is noticeable straight away with an average song length of almost 7 minutes. While this might sound like a complaint, Iron Maiden proved within their first decade that they can write phenomenal songs that break the 6 minute mark, so in their 4th decade, you would think that this wouldn't be an issue.\n\nHowever, the problem lies in the over-repetition of the choruses. While this would become more apparent in later releases, it without a doubt plagues Brave New World incessantly. Still, the choruses themselves are great musically, but no one needs to hear \"We're blood brothers,\" 32 times in one song. Now, apart from the overlong sections, this album is essentially flawless. Bruce's voice is as powerful as ever, but he's adopted a noticeable level of maturity since Fear of The Dark, which may be related to his solo project, in which he was immensely active during the 90's. Like every Iron Maiden record, the lead guitars are incredible. Every track is filled with amazing melodies and developed sequences. With the aforementioned newly acquired maturity, the members show nuances and a certain amount of intricacy in the performances. This is especially evident in the excellent Ghost of The Navigator, one of my favourites from the album. The song shows the band's excellent use of dynamics and how they utilise song structure to be both accessible and ambitious simultaneously.\n\nThe production is brilliant, it gives Maiden previously unheard of ambience, which matches the orchestral sound when the synths are incorporated. Some people may disregard the use of keyboards, but in my opinion they hugely improve and ornament the music, especially during the intro to Out of The Silent Planet (one of the best things that the band ever committed to tape). There are some more mysterious and ominous-sounding riffs on this record, such as in The Nomad, which is reminiscent of Piece of Mind and Powerslave, contributing to the classic sound of Brave New World. Again, the lyrics and vocals are excellent. Bruce is at some of his absolute finest moments during this album, his performances on Dream of Mirrors and the title track are anthemic, and his tone matches the mimicking guitar melodies very well. Brave New World stands the test of time, there's a reason why many people see it as one of Maiden's best efforts. It's an outstanding release, and one that is extremely memorable.\n",
        "\nIt does feel like punching yourself in the gut whenever you are saying unfavorable things to bands that you admire especially when an album is regarded as one of the greats in the metal genre. \n\nIron Maiden is a band that needs no introduction. With their accolades, releases spanning to this day, live shows toured all across the world, they're not doubt one of the biggest, if not, the biggest and most successful band in the world whether you're into metal or not, Maiden have been a staple in music, as a whole. So, it does make me feel upset not liking a major album in their catalogue in Powerslave. \n\nThe thing for me is that I tried and I tried and I tried. I tried to listen to it here and there... multiple times... even twice in a seating to understand and see the album for what it is but I couldn't like this album as much. I think \"Somewhere In Time\" is SO MUCH better album than Powerslave, in my opinion.\n\nNow, there are 3 songs that I really love and sound fantastic and filled with energy and of course, \"Aces High\" and \"2 Minutes To Midnight\" and the third song that I love is the title track \"Powerslave\". Those are my personal favorites from the album. We all heard \"Aces High\" and \"2 Minutes to Midnight\" being excellent one-two punches as openers especially 2 Minutes. Everything about these songs feel upbeat, filled with energy and gets you headbanging and all the good stuff. \"Powerslave\" delve into the atmosphere of Egypt, as the album cover has stated\" is an absolute banger and the solos in the middle are just breath-taking.\n\nNow, the positives, somewhat, stops here for me and then the other songs happen. My biggest gripes on this album are two things... either the songs are unmemorable or it's too gallop-y to my liking and it can be quite a bit overpowering.\n\nFor the sake of the review, I might do a bit of a track-by-track of sorts to get the point across so, anywho... here we go:\n\nSo after the awesome track \"2 Minutes to Midnight\", we have the instrumental: \"Losfer Words (Big 'Orra)\". It's a good instrumental but not too memorable and the gallop-y/bass-y riff start to get overpowering from here. It's fine but for the most part, all you hear is \"glunkity-glunkity-glunkity-glunk\" moreso than having this instrumental sounds like a song. That's what I remember from the song more than it feels like a flowing one and once it's done, it feels very whatever. It's like having an examination in school or college... once you're done with the exam and another friends asks you about it, you're like: \"I don't remember much.\" and this is how I feel about this song.\n\nNow, we have the middle portion of the album with \"Flash of the Blade\", \"The The Duellists\" and \"Back in the Village\" and these songs do sound very same-y with \"Back in the Village\" is best out of the three songs. They're pretty much start with an opener riffs, \"glunkity-glunkity-glunkity-glunkity\" and Bruce Dickenson wailing uninspired choruses and still very forgettable. I swear, other Maiden albums have much better and more memorable songs all throughout but here, it's just very frustrating and even the lyrics feel very generic and like I said, \"Back in the Village\" music sounding a bit better than all three.\n\nSo, anyway, I got those out of the way and now, the biggest misfire of the WHOLE album with the 13+ minutes in \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\". I love lengthy and epic tracks and overtime, Iron Maiden made better ones in later albums in both \"The Book of Souls\" and \"Senjutsu\" but here, this sure feels very anti-climactic. It's starts fine with a rocky, energetic feel to it until the after the 5+ minute mark which we get a very slow part which is fine at first with narration and all and which feels like ships on water with broken sails but it goes on a bit too long. With whatever energy the song had from the beginning of this song, it is all gone and what's frustrating is that it doesn't gradually go up in speed to give us a kick-ass moment in the song... it just happens without any flair and then the song ends and the album, as well. No fire, no flair, no grandeur or anything that feels like an epic finale. This song sucks and the worst song on the album. It's like it took all of my frustration throughout the album and put them into one. I've listened to this album SO MANY TIMES and that is all I remember from this song and I tried. There are plenty of albums that I heard once or twice that had more impact in terms of lengthy songs... see. Moonsorrow. I know... different genres but they have 18 minutes songs that are memorable throughout and even later in Maiden's career had better lengthy songs that are way, WAY better see. \"Empire of the Clouds\". \n\nSo, anyway, it does pain me to write the negatives on this album because of the reputation that it has and it is regarded as their best album and the best in metal but to me most of the songs are forgettable, frustrating and as a whole, uninspiring for only like 3 songs. I guess, to me, this pharaoh is lost \"Somewhere in Time\"... give me that album instead.\n",
        "\nThe black sheep of Iron Maiden's discography, and the record that I have to agree is the worst, Virtual XI is unfortunately a result of creative stagnancy and failure to progress from their preceding effort. With that in mind, the album still doesn't fall entirely flat. There are a lot of hugely energetic and generally enjoyable songs here, only ruined by some overlong, gratingly awful songs that have stained Maiden's discography. Namely, The Angel and the Gambler and Como Estais Amigos never end, and are filled with mediocre melodies as well as abysmal lyrics. However, there are places where the guitar work shines, and Blaze's voice is surprisingly great. \n\nI have to say that the band made a good choice by opening the record with Futureal; a short, commercial song with some very interesting riffs and is energetic enough to make a good first impression. Like the previous album but executed differently, there's a noticeable retention of a slow tempo on Virtual XI. Most of the songs are meandering, relying heavily on a verse-chorus structure that sounds more watered-down than the band's average output. There is still a major use of synths on this record, but that's become a consistent characteristic of Maiden since Somewhere In Time, and have been prominent in every album since. Another annoying thing about Virtual XI is how awkward the performances feel sometimes, like the abrupt ending to Don't Look To The Eyes of A Stranger and the chorus of When Two Worlds Collide. This makes it feel as if the songwriting may have been rushed. \n\nOn the other hand, there are some very epic moments on the album that break out of this slightly uninspired style. The Clansman is a staple that the band still plays live, and with good reason. The song boasts the classic Iron Maiden sound, with a lot of amazing melodies and an innovative structure, although the chorus is still repeated ad nauseum, but if that's too much to deal with, then you would've turned the album off at track 2. With that being said, Blaze does hold The Clansman up reasonably well. That track stands as an example of what this album could've been if they had refined the less interesting songs and focused more on actual substance.\n\nVirtual XI is also similar to The X Factor in that it still attempts to create a melancholy sound, but it isn't pulled off nearly as well, and at times comes off as forced and lacks a sense of sincere songwriting. Instead of making truly desperate-sounding music using triumphant sonorities and grandiose articulation, this record feels mostly like the band going by the numbers and consequently the music suffers from a lack of direction. It sounds like I'm criticising the album heavily, and while it is heavily flawed, moreso than most Iron Maiden releases, there is some very good material on here that shouldn't be ignored.\n",
        "\nWell, the 90s weren\u2019t that great for the Irons, but at least they tried. Without a doubt, 1992\u2019s Fear of the Dark is their best effort (sorry but not sorry, X-Factor worshipers) from that unkind to trad metal decade, though not necessarily by a wide margin. This one still carries a lot of the flavor of its predecessor, the uninspired No Prayer for the Dying, albeit with several stronger points. For starters, the iconic title-track is hands down an all-time top 10 Maiden tune, whereas most songs from the preceding LP decidedly lie outside the top 50 (\u201cBring Your Daughter\u2026\u201d being the sole exception), taking into account the Irons full studio discography to date. Then there\u2019s the variety of the songs, we have a greater span of song lengths, tempos, themes and styles, as in Maiden\u2019s classic 80s output. And finally, the torch was passed from the great Derek Riggs to fellow countryman and at the time, relatively unknown, Melvyn Grant, who became the second artist ever to depict the perennial Eddie, in what remains one of Iron Maiden\u2019s greatest album artworks, and quite fittingly, the scariest ever\u2026 though I\u2019ll credit Riggs\u2019 Hooks in You to be darn close in that regard. The evil-tree Eddie is metal as fuck!\n\nFear of the Dark was a very lengthy release for its day and age, the first one for the Brits to be close to one hour in duration, released as a double LP in vinyl form. We have, for better or worse, witnessed much longer records being released by the Irons since then. With that runtime unfortunately, came the need to scrutinize more every song, to see and hear for ourselves if their inclusion was necessary or if they fit in the dreaded category of \u201cfillers\u201d. Iron Maiden\u2019s ninth studio album is sadly not without weak tracks, though none which would clearly qualify as filler. The mid-section of the record, starting with \u201cThe Fugitive\u201d is just not great, but neither bad. After that poor man\u2019s spiritual successor to \u201cThe Prisoner\u201d, comes the 80s Deep Purple-sounding \u201cChains of Misery\u201d, a little too simple, if not entirely devoid of catchiness thanks to its chorus. \u201cThe Apparition\u201d might be the worse track due to the construction of its sung parts, but has an interesting and compelling instrumental middle section. Of marginally better quality, \u201cFear Is the Key\u201d, \u201cWeekend Warrior\u201d and the album\u2019s second single, \u201cFrom Here to Eternity\u201d all are solid and catchy tracks will good moments, though none qualify as a Maidenian masterpiece. \n\nThe record\u2019s remaining 30+ minutes constitute its cream of the crop. Opener \u201cBe Quick or Be Dead\u201d, an ode to the brutality and cold-bloodedness of the stock market, is the closest Iron Maiden will ever get to composing a speed metal tune, even closer than any song of the DiAnno era. It\u2019s pretty bad ass, and I only regret to not being able to witness it being played live so far, I doubt I\u2019ll ever get that chance. \u201cChildhood\u2019s End\u201d is a soulful semi-ballad, a pessimistic but realistic take on Third World\u2019s children and their harsh reality, with an epic-feel that reminds me of the future Brave New World. \u201cWasting Love\u201d is a more traditional power ballad, both romantic but melancholic, and a first for the band. While it isn\u2019t as potent as many others from its time, it\u2019s sufficiently good, with an emotive guitar work by Murray and Gers on display, both in melodies and during the solos, and a great performance by Bruce. \u201cJudas Be My Guide\u201d, the shortest track here, is a song I\u2019ve come to rediscover and re-appreciate, as I currently find it quite catchy and underrated, with great melodies and chorus, despite its negative message. It carries some 80s Maiden feel, unlike the two remaining, longest compositions; \u201cAfraid to Shoot Strangers\u201d and the title-track. The former one, about the Gulf War, is another great addition to Maiden\u2019s war-themed songs, a topic they\u2019re pretty good at. It\u2019s the most progressive composition of the album, at almost seven minutes in length and traversing well-crafted different sections, and like \u201cChildhood\u2019s End\u201d, its keyboard orchestrations heralds the grandiose sound Iron Maiden would pursue more in future releases.\n\nFinally, the best for the last, \u201cFear of the Dark\u201d itself, is another masterful composition by the Irons that shares with \u201cAfraid to Shoot Strangers\u201d the use of ballad-esque, semi-acoustic calm moments, in this case bookending the main section, mixed with heavier ones. The lyrics about, well, the fear of the dark, are also quite relatable and spooky. It\u2019s one of the first Iron Maiden songs I ever listened to, and in fact, Fear of the Dark was the first album I ever experienced by the Irons. I still listen to many of its songs occasionally, by \u201cFear of the Dark\u201d is my favorite here by a landslide. I especially love it in live renditions, the one song I feel gets better and better on a live environment, with the crowd chants, and Nicko seemingly adding more and more accents and touches here and there. The formula for its composition proved to be so iconic and well-received, that the band had re-used it many times on many future songs, like \u201cBrave New World\u201d, \u201cOut of the Silent Planet\u201d, \u201cNo More Lies\u201d, \u201cDance of Death\u201d, \u201cBrighter than a Thousand Suns\u201d and so on. It has become overused, but still, it\u2019s a signature formula by Maiden, so nothing wrong if the rip off themselves. \n\nThe band as a whole remained quite tight, though I still feel Bruce\u2019s voice continued to deteriorate and became more strained, a process started in the previous album. He still performs good, just not as 80s good. Steve Harris co-produced the album with longtime legend Martin Birch, in what would be his last work. It was another impactful passing of the torch, but Steve learned from the best and has managed to do pretty good. The mix is quite crisp and balanced. The rhythmic section remained precise and interesting, while the guitars provide many great passages here. Though it\u2019s not among my favorite Maiden records in terms of quality, power and memorability, 30 years after its release, Fear of the Dark still has a special place in my heart. Oddly, the Fear of the Dark Tour would bring Iron Maiden to my home city of Guadalajara, Mexico, but I was too young and not even familiar with them when that took place. I still own the \u201998 remastered and expanded version of this record, and will depart from this life with it when the time comes.\n",
        "\nExit Bruce Dickinson, enter Blaze Bayley. Subsequently, the fans' reaction is a no-brainer. The next Iron Maiden album could be musically perfect, it could be Somewhere In Time part II, it could be the best thing pressed onto wax, but Bruce isn't on it, so fans are going to bash it into oblivion. Is The X Factor perfect? No, but it's pretty close, and while I am reviewing the album from a biased point of view, I will try to be objective when explaining why this record shouldn't be forgotten and disregarded. \n\nThe first thing I should probably cover is the very noticeable change in atmosphere on The X Factor. Despite containing an identical lineup excluding Blaze, the music has been severely shifted to sound much dark, much more progressive, and you could even say more progressive, almost as if the band's sound has matured. The lead guitars in Fortunes of War bleed melancholic wails, the orchestral-sounding middle section of Sign of the Cross is triumphant and huge. Seeming much more ambitious and daring, I think that the adventurous aspects of this album pay off more than well enough.\n\nThe production sounds very clean and modern, although I think the drum tone could be improved. Apart from that, the guitars have a massive, almost industrial sound that fits the style of the music, being that the band have restricted the amount of riffing in place of a more epic, grandiose result. Of course, this is different to a new level for Iron Maiden, and while it definitely does take getting used to, The X Factor is brilliant in its experimentation.\n\nBlaze sings in a lower register than Bruce, and I have to say it fits the songs much better, he is still very good at phrasing and mimics the melodies well. The music heavily relies on very epic and drawn-out choruses, with examples being Look For The Truth and The Unbeliever. With the hugely melodic sound of the lead guitars during the majority of Iron Maiden's discography, it's no surprise that Dave Murray and Janick Gers can utilise this to match the melancholic sound of the rhythm sections. \n\nA vast increase in average song length on The X Factor should indicate the more progressive nature of the songs before even listening to it. When the album does start, this is immediately confirmed during the slightly overlong intro of Sign of the Cross, which lasts for a good 3 and a half minutes. While this can seem daunting and certainly is overblown considering the traditional style of Iron Maiden, it definitely does help build tension, as this opening track is without a doubt one of the band's finest moments and is in my personal top 3 songs of all time.\n\nSign of The Cross' ambitious songwriting isn't its only interesting aspect though, there are some amazing vocal melodies and a colossal middle section, filled with eerie and triumphant riffs. Another very enticing thing about this record is how gut-wrenchingly heavy it is. While it still is standard Maiden and doesn't really have any up-tempo or intense riffs, The X Factor's huge sound makes the notes hit hard.\n\nThe other undisputed highlight of the album is Man On The Edge. When I stated that the record mostly refrains from being fast, this song is the exception, and shows off the band's incredible songwriting skills, as well as proving that they could still make short, memorable and addictive songs. When this is mixed with the dark tone of the album, the result is absolute perfection. With an unrelenting, dynamic sound and very gripping songs, The X Factor stands as a great album in spite of being largely ignored or vilified.\n",
        "\nWhen it comes to this release, the often argument is that there are some passages here and there that are truly acceptable, and only two songs are worth getting supposedly. The only thing I suggest is to download the digital copy of this album, replace the original song The Angel And The Gambler and get the 6-minute-single version instead. It's the only way to digest it better and I always thought that they should have put the single version instead of that endless 10-minute torture. I love this album, every time I listen to it I like it more than the last time. And the most satisfying thing is perceiving every metal nuance that Nigel Green polishes with his hands. At times, I dare to say that Nigel Green is more of a metal producer than Kevin Shirley. I really like Shirley's early work with this band, but his latest albums sound like dad rock. They're good, but they're too dad rock in terms of guitar tone.\n\nSince not everything has to be perfect then there has to be a balance. Virtual XI has little flaws in the songwriting department, but Nigel Green's freshness makes you want to revisit this album more than some from the Shirley era. The only ones who\u2019ll say this is bad are the classic fanboys who defend their husband Dickinson and aren't capable of giving Blaze Bayley the credit he deserves, a vocalist who in the short time he lasted in the band knew how to evolve and grow up as a musician. The song that tends to be overly mythologized is The Clansman, a Braveheart-based epic that wouldn't be out of place on any of their more brilliant albums, which is true because Virtual XI follows the same path as its adjoining albums.\n\nThis album doesn't commit the same sin that No Prayer For The Dying did with those flat, jovial, rocker songs. While the first two albums with Janick Gers were shitty rock albums, since The X Factor the band tries to recover complex compositions with greater continuity, perhaps kinda monotonous but entertaining all in all. Monotonous in the sense that some songs have predictable structures, and entertaining in the sense of having more hook and punch at a point where Janick Gers was already used to the band. In the songwriting department Mr. Harris is who fails here, at best. The first things that come to mind when you listen to Virtual XI are the nods to 1970s retro-rock in the style of Led Zeppelin/Deep Purple in songs like the mellow When Two Worlds Collide or the flawed The Angel And The Gambler. This last one improves significantly in the 6-minute-single version that can be considered the best option in a digital version of the whole release. The only thing we lost is the introspective choruses in the middle section (sadly) and some of the 70 repetitions on \"Don't you think I'm a savior\"... (for everyone's sake).\n\nAlong the same lines, Don't Look to the Eyes of a Stranger is much more tolerable, and this is where I have to answer why this album is similar to Brave New World. Unnecessary repetitions are present in both albums, not only the repetitions, but the general vibe in those albums are similar and the only thing that differentiates them is the closer and therefore the way it ends. You have the first single song and then you get into the complex compositions. Last but not least, both albums are written for the vocal ranges of their respective vocalists. BNW is epic and overly happy, befitting Bruce's voice, while Virtual XI walks the fine line between epicness and introspectiveness that characterizes Blaze's nebulous voice. When it comes to songs, Don't Look to the Eyes of a Stranger and Dream of Mirrors have an amazingly similar structure, with the usual slow intro and fast-paced rupture in the second half. These two songs are easily assimilated to that metaphor about the two worlds between reality and the glass of a mirror.\n\nEven if I put myself in the shoes of others, I may not say it's a horrible album, but probably the least memorable of their entire career. Not so much because of Blaze's voice, which is not disliked at all since there are those who play The X Factor over some of Bruce's albums, but because of the languor, lack of motivation, and lack of life that the band seems to show. Objectively this is not St. Anger and it's far from it, it's rather a strange facet you don't see every day. The sound is not very flexible but is a bit languid too. It doesn't have nor seeks the darkness that defined the gloomy The X Factor, yet it doesn't convey the light, joy, and immediacy of Brave New World either.\n\nVisually and aesthetically, they offer a mix between soccer (a concept they explored years ago in Weekend Warrior) and the Ed Hunter video game/virtual reality concept, although Eddie is really notable on the excellent cover, which is one of the least memorable for the simple fact of being very ignored, and frankly it's better than Dance of Death or NPFTD aesthetically. While it's true that Blaze had to face the band's lowest hours, it's understandable why they believe that The X Factor still sounds convincing, because the doubts he raised among fans after that album and the tour placed him in a somewhat disjointed situation. You will always hear the same opinions to the detriment of that or this release, but the balance tends to be placed more negatively on this one due to a certain lack of inspiration in the composition. For me, Virtual XI is not lost in a world of uncertainty with mediocre, apparently incomplete songwriting that was totally abandoned in the collective imagination. I think the above-described fits perfectly for No Prayer For The Dying.\n",
        "\nProbably the odd one out in the Maiden discography, being that the title track is one of their biggest songs, but the rest of the album is almost never mentioned. I feel like Fear of the Dark as an album still gets too much hate for being different to their 80's output. However, every track here is substantial to a point and warrants recognition as ranging from musically apt to masterful. Sure, there is one track on this record in particular that is a massive dip in quality relative to the rest of the album, of course being Weekend Warrior, with its irritating hooks and lack of inspiration. Other than that, I would argue that this record is amazing, it might not feature grandiose lead guitar work or iconic songwriting like the band's previous material, but there's an abundance of fresh ideas on Fear of the Dark that make it a more than great experience.\n\nFirstly, the more gritty atmosphere of No Prayer For The Dying is retained here, although the music is generally more eerie, with more reverb-centred guitars and more streamlined vocal harmonies that honestly improve the songs hugely. For example, songs like Judas Be My Guide and The Fugitive would otherwise be ok tracks, but Bruce's outstanding vocal performance makes those songs the classics that they are. There's a certain attitude to the music here, and it's noticeable across more of the runtime, it sounds like the band is paying homage to their more rock-oriented roots of Thin Lizzy and Montrose; holding the melody back a bit and focusing more on riffs and hooks. Regardless, this still definitely sounds like Maiden, and when the lead guitars do kick in, they bring some of the highlights of Dave Murray's career as well as Janick Gers'. If this isn't exemplified in the title track alone, the jaw-dropping solos in Afraid To Shoot Strangers prove that this was an overlooked record, and a victim of the band's forsaken 90's period.\n\nWith that being said, Afraid To Shoot Strangers could be considered a ballad, at least the first half. Fear of the Dark shows that Iron Maiden can write amazing ballads, as the band only really dabbled with the idea in 2 or 3 tracks before this, but maybe it's something they should've tried more often, considering how legendary some of these songs are. Of course, when reviewing Iron Maiden, the main focal point is the songwriting, and these songs are written exceptionally, with a contemporary commercial sound in mind but without resorting to bland pop rock songs, Maiden knows how to keep a track together and this record isn't any exception, since the album manages to sound catchy and consistent with varied structures despite the relatively short average track length. \n\nFeaturing one staple for the band and a few other somewhat popular hits, Fear of the Dark is immensely underrated, and I feel that there is a lot of material here to enjoy past what you might've already heard. Virtually every song is memorable and enjoyable. The main reason I gave this album a nearly perfect score is because of how consistent the band is able to keep the songs.\n",
        "\nIron Maiden is by far my favorite band of all time. I worship the ground that they walk on, and I will fight for their name for the rest of my life. That being said, I think it\u2019s my duty as a fan to weather my dissatisfaction when I\u2019m unsatisfied with what the band does. These expressions don\u2019t become clearer than my opinion on their 8th studio album, No Prayer For The Dying, from 1990.\n\nNo Prayer For The Dying was in many aspects an album of change for Iron Maiden. Created in the aftermath of their 1988 album Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son, which can be considered as the zenith of the band\u2019s creativity in the 1980s, No Prayer For The Dying can be described as the antithesis to that album. While Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son was an album built on progressive bombast and conceptualized themes, No Prayer For The Dying is more primitive and easy to comprehend. Gone are the long songs and complex song structures, appearent is shorter songs written in a more straight-forward, traditionalistic pattern. In many ways, No Prayer For The Dying can be considered as the album where Iron Maiden tried to get back to the musical style of their younger years, a style that culminated with albums like Iron Maiden and Killers. While there\u2019s nothing wrong with this approach on paper, the result was anything but successful.\n\nTruth be told, this album is awful. It lacks everything that I love about Iron Maiden, everything that made them my favorite band of all time. The biggest problem with No Prayer For The Dying is without any doubt the songwriting. Like I said, on paper there\u2019s nothing wrong with stripping down your sound and going back to your roots, but when you do it with ideas like this, you might as well stop before it\u2019s too late. Nothing on this album is memorable, nothing on this album is interesting and nothing on this album indicates that this is the same band that broke the boundaries of heavy metal the decade before. To think that this is the same band that made Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son always fills me with a large amount of rage. As a Maiden fanatic, I have always considered this album to be an insult to everything that has to do with Iron Maiden. Both the fans and the band itself knew that they could do better than this, yet they decide to waste their time, energy and talent on creating and releasing this subpar garbage. It's not only embarrassing but also unprofessional. I know many people gave up on Iron Maiden when this album was released, and even though I'm not one of them, I can fully understand why. \n\nAnother major highlight of awfulness is the vocals of Bruce Dickinson. Gone is the high-pitched, operatic air-raid siren, appearent is\u2026 I don\u2019t even know. His vocals is more mid-ranged than on previous albums, which in itself isn\u2019t a bad thing, but since he sings with a more raspy, dirty voice than before, he adds a large amount of cringe to the album. But on the other hand, it\u2019s not like a more traditional sounding Bruce Dickinson would have made these songs justice. The songs are crap regardless of how he sings them.\n\nSpeaking of the songs, there are only two of them that deserves to be talked about in a positive way. Those are the two book-end songs, \u201dTailgunner\u201d and \u201dMother Russia\u201d. \u201dTailgunner\u201d opens the album and is a fast-paced number with a fun chorus. It\u2019s not a great song, but it\u2019s a song that I can listen to and be satisfied with. Same goes for \u201dMother Russia\u201d, the album\u2019s closer and the closest the album comes to a \u201dMaiden epic\u201d. As an epic, it doesn\u2019t hold a candle compared to the ones that Iron Maiden had written in the past and would write in the future, but in the context of this album, it definitely deserves to be held in high regard. Sadly, the good songs end here. The rest of the songs varies from being mediocre to straight up embarrassing, culminating with abominations like \u201dHoly Smoke\u201d, \u201dThe Assassin\u201d and \u201dBring Your Daughter To The Slaughter\u201d, the last one being a new low for the band up to that point. I know it\u2019s one of the band\u2019s most famous songs but I don\u2019t care. I hate it, and it\u2019s a relief to know that the band has trashed it in terms of live performances.\n\nAs far as the musical performances go, Bruce Dickinson notwithstanding, they\u2019re as good as they\u2019re going to get. Steve Harris plays his bass, Nicko McBrain plays his drums\u2026 nothing new under the sun. Janick Gers, who with this album makes his studio debut with Iron Maiden, delivers some fast and entertaining solos, but doesn\u2019t have much to work with as a whole. Unlike many, I consider Janick Gers to be a vital part of the Iron Maiden organism and considering how far it has gone, it would be hard for me to accept Iron Maiden without Janick Gers. That has little to do with this album though. On No Prayer For The Dying, he\u2019s basically just there and does what he\u2019s been told. It\u2019s not an easy task to fill the void of Adrian Smith, and considering the circumstances, his performance is acceptable. \n\nSpeaking of Adrian Smith, he is sorely missed on this album. Perhaps not in terms of guitar playing, but definitely in terms of songwriting. He left the band during the pre-stages of this album and I don\u2019t blame him. If my band had gone in the same direction as Maiden did on No Prayer For The Dying, I probably would have called it quits too. Still, this album definitely would have benefited from having Adrian Smith\u2019s songwriting capacity. It is possible that the album would have been awful anyway, but the chances of a better album definitely would have increased. On the other hand, Adrian Smith\u2019s departure paved the way for the arrival of Janick Gers, so even in these dark, terrible times for Iron Maiden, there was something positive to talk about. \n\nOne may wonder if my opinion on No Prayer For The Dying would be as harsh if the album wasn\u2019t preceeded by Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son, arguably the band\u2019s most creative and ambitious album of all time? Yes. It would. Even on it\u2019s own terms, this album is garbage. It doesn\u2019t matter if I compare it to the band\u2019s other albums or not. It wouldn\u2019t have mattered if this was their first album, their 8th album or their last album. This album is trash regardless of how many factors I take into, or don\u2019t take into, account.\n",
        "\nWhen we talk about a classic record, many may miss an album like this. Surely, the choice of each person may vary, but the feeling this band produce in their fans goes beyond time. That's where the difficult, fussy definition of 'classic' comes into play. If you ask me, the answer is in the review title: it's a classic distantly akin to their eighties material. This may sound very oxymoron. This band are not just heavy metal or any banally attributed category/label, because the magic they discovered and the mystique they achieved was beyond anything done by any of their contemporaries, with the exception of the metal gods Judas Priest. Perhaps a banal label you can bestow on Fear of the Dark is hard rock, and you're welcome. If I want to talk about this is not because it's one of their best solid albums but because it was the moment they began to manifest a hopeful return to form. Beyond all, this album marked a special moment in my early years as a listener when I started discovering metal thanks to this disc, The Black Album, Countdown To Extinction, Metalium and so. Maybe this has nothing to do with the hypnotic power of the guitars, Harris's bass, Nicko's drums, and the majestic magnetism of the master Bruce as those are the variables taken into account when it comes to their quintessential classics.\n\nThe truth is that these songs helped me to enter the Maiden world, hence why my special affection for it. So, after a decade they had established among the best exponents of the NWOBHM. They left the great scepter imposed with their masterpieces and had the duty to improve the previous back-to-the-roots album... and they did. First, they improved the art cover with a creepy Eddie in which the band makes it clear that they were the indicated guides to enter mysterious lands, so to say. Cuts like Be Quick Or Be Dead gave the first blow of energy and quality, not in vain did they manage to become the most representative that have survived oblivion after 30 years without disparate results, to say the least. Structurally, songs like Afraid To Shoot Strangers lash out to leave everyone open-mouthed. Those songs were well done with a lot of sobriety compositionally speaking. Best leads supporting Dickinson's intense singing were destined to turn them into anthems. Also, I would like to give an unpopular opinion: Weekend Warrior is quite entertaining and rides on a fleeting, fast hard-rock riff that gives way to Bruce's rebellious lines whose impolite, long-winded solos cross each other in its middle part.\n\nReaching the top of the album, a stellar Dave Murray appears hovering over an emotional solo and satisfying this new batch of arena rock that caught many off guards. But apart from the arena rock vibe, as you go to the end of the album you realize that there are also competent stuff with the standard of this band, I mean, they could be 80s classics easily. They sound fresh, catchy, very well executed, and have the nerve of planting choruses with more glitter than sequins; they enter the first and are chanted to the lungs. To finish it, they had to give the final push with the self-titled song, which is their essence at its finest, a veil of occultism with voices from beyond the grave and a melody that makes your hair stand on end. It's a tense song, preoccupied with every detail that these notes produce in your imagination. Not surprisingly, they have surpassed the category of heavy metal and become the cultists of a unique and recognizable style. The rest of the songs are good on their own and would go on to develop well in their own right. In fact, all the songs are well developed to a greater or lesser degree and are evenly distributed in the tracklist. The bass lines are permanently functional and arrogant as always, but with fair reasons since there is no album in which the bass is a complaint.\n\nThe cadence of the guitars is combined with the rumbling powerful bass, added to the interventions that Murray and Gers combine; and along with Dickinson's incredible lines they build a story of curses and surprises; check and listen to the middle section of Fear Is The Key where with a magnetic touch and regular tempo we see McBrain with different eyes, who by the way also provides slightly more functional performances than in his later years. They were -and still are- the hidden yearning that each one of us felt for the unknown, and what a better way to reveal it through their exquisite music. Contrary to popular opinion, Fear of the Dark is a worthy release. The songs are so spectacular that the melodies and bass lines work as the perfect background for any creation. At this point, more than seven albums have passed and they made it clear that this album was painted to be an eternal classic. And there still were two more albums to experience during the 90s that in the end didn't reach the expected offer. Fear of the Dark is the end of a classic period that couldn't recover until Brave New World. After listening to the first two singles, we can think they won't invent any novel wheel indeed, but listening to this is also a constant scenic railway. Apart from two epics with long intros and higher instrumental developments, you can find much simpler cuts that don't need ornamentation or synths to shine on their own.\n\nThat's how they are, a band that transcended any elitist frontier. Nonetheless, I acknowledge its faults as The Apparition can catch you off guard with its lack of substance because it seems like an unfinished song. All in all, Bruce and the other guys continue to guard the spiked sarcophagus, despite not having a greater compositional brilliance. It's not better than their 80s classics, but it still holds the bar high, maybe in a less passionate way. There is nothing new at this point but they kept polishing their music despite the wear and tear of the years and the chaos of changing members. Maybe if they discarded The Apparition this could be nearly perfect. With its pros and cons, Fear of the Dark is an unequivocal testimony to a bygone era, the 80s, seen with nostalgia by some and clearly outdated by others. Your possibility of enjoyment rests on that version of the band which you identify with. If you like fun, light-hearted hard rock, the kind you feel like playing on while cruising the roads in a convertible, this could be your thing. If you're one of those who take themselves very seriously and think you've left that far behind, mate, go for Seventh Son, Killers, or Powerslave.\n",
        "\nBy far the most actively hated album in Maiden's discography (even the Blaze albums are ignored more than hated, whereas No Prayer For The Dying constantly gets flak), you probably had a tinted view of this record during the first listening. Firstly, I'm not going to state my love for this album just to be a contrarian and to piss people off, but I have a genuine appreciation for No Prayer For The Dying, while I understand why most seem to despise it, which is understandable, especially coming off the heels of Seventh Son, which may be the most praised release of the band's career. However, something about the music connects with me, and I would say that this album is a gem.\n\nWhile openers Tailgunner and Holy Smoke definitely do sound odd and a bit too jovial considering the dark tone of the rest of the record, I find the seemingly innocent and unorthodox riffs to be fun and memorable, especially in the context of the latter's silly music video. The album kicks off on a not-so-serious tone that is a great listen, but this is completely tipped on its head when the title track starts. I don't want to describe every track separately, so I'm going to sum it up by saying that the song No Prayer For The Dying changes the atmosphere completely, and the band retains this more sombre atmosphere for the rest of the runtime. \n\nThis record is still dripping in the epic and massive sound found on the 3 previous albums, but this is conveyed slightly differently. No Prayer For The Dying has more of an attitude, and some of the songs even sound punk-oriented. The band is still very cohesive though, and the powerful riffs mixed with the frail but passionate vocals on tracks like Fate's Warning and Public Enema Number One make for a very enjoyable experience. Again, there are some less serious songs on the second side of the album that sound out of place, but don't ruin the flow of the songs. \n\nA lot of the melodies on No Prayer For The Dying are simple and somewhat played out, but I still love them, and they definitely contribute to the more sorrowful sound that the band was trying to pull off. One complaint I have is that the lyrics on most of the songs are dumb, especially relative to the rest of the band's material prior. It's especially egregious when Bruce tries to perform the vocals as grandly as he normally does. There is a noticeable change in how the songs are written, which may be related to Adrian Smith's departure from the band. Although I think Janick Gers is a great guitar player (he's a true member of Iron Maiden, I don't care what the purists say), it can't be denied that Smith was a key songwriter for the band. The record consequently does suffer, but most of this is saved, since the lineup is still strong. \n\nNo Prayer For The Dying is an album that I feel is disliked for multiple reasons, but I enjoy these flaws, and there definitely is a lot of enjoyable material on here if you try to get past some of the more grating parts.\n",
        "\nI'm going to be honest, Seventh Son represents Iron Maiden at their absolute peak. Although I slightly prefer Somewhere In Time, this album is the band's best songwriting coupled with the perfect production that has been left virtually untouched since its predecessor. From the opening acoustic chords of Moonchild, to the same acoustic outro of Only The Good Die Young, Seventh Son doesn't let up its epic, grand aspects for a single note, it is 44 minutes of pure perfection.\n\nIt's interesting that the guitars on this record seem to be held back massively, as the band relies more on a dynamic approach, where the guitars mingle with the keyboards to create the perfect atmosphere over Bruce's haunting vocals. Considering Iron Maiden has always been a guitar-oriented band, it's surprising how well this works, although there are plenty of solos throughout the album that manage to generate the same level of brilliance heard in Powerslave, for example.\n\nSeventh Son is similar to the album that came before it, not just production-wise, but also when the songwriting is analysed from a standpoint of tension-building; the breakdown in Infinite Dreams is a great example of this, and it makes the music much more memorable. Even though this epic sound retains throughout the entire runtime, Seventh Son still isn't bereft of some amazing, shorter, more accessible tracks like Can I Play With Madness, and The Evil That Men Do, the latter of which being my favourite from the album by far, with its perfect pre-chorus and Bruce's perplexing vocal delivery, as well as containing one of the most powerful riffs ever written (during the time change after the intro).\n\nThere is a huge focus on melody over heaviness on this record, especially on the last half. The title track is a song that every metalhead knows, and boasts some of the most impressive motifs in Iron Maiden's discography. The lyrics revolve around a biblical reference that the album as a whole is supposedly based on, but not every track explicitly follows this. The Prophecy, a hugely underrated track, and The Clairvoyant both seem to cover different, but similar topics, and the music matches the grandiose lyricism too, featuring the aforementioned melodies that create a huge sound, which could be argued massively influenced power metal.\n\nSeventh Son of a Seventh Son is nothing short of a masterpiece, a complete essential. The songs are unforgettable, and the experience as a whole is one of the strongest and gripping in music.\n",
        "\nHappy 66(6)th birthday Steve! And The Number of the Beast is 40 years old! Unbelievable. Even when I cannot say I\u2019ve listened to it since when it was originally released, as this great masterpiece of metal precedes my own existence by two years. I can only imagine what it means for metalheads who were there, anxious to get it right after listening to the debut and Killers and knowing this band was destined for greatness, even after the departure of its first frontman. Were there many doubts Bruce would fill those shoes? Were those who though and foresaw he might actually surpass DiAnno as THE voice for The Beast? I\u2019ve never chatted with someone who happened to be alive in that situation, but I\u2019d be curious to know. My own first experience of the Irons came a decade and change later, around 1997 when Bruce was not around anymore. A friend lent me Fear of the Dark and I wasn\u2019t really impressed. But then, I listened and purchased Best of the Beast compilation and boy, oh boy! I was blown away. The songs from The Number of the Beast became some of my favorites, especially \u201cHallowed Be Thy Name\u201d.\n\nA few years later, I had collected all the 80s Maiden classics in CD format, the enhanced 1998 EMI reissues. The Number of the Beast became one of the most listened albums by me all the late 90s and remained so well into the mid-2000s, when my taste in metal diversified exponentially. How could I rank it now? Among my favorite 20 metal releases? Top 50s? I certainly don\u2019t know anymore, since I\u2019ve listened to so many great metal records, and every day I listen to something new. I don\u2019t listen to Maiden as much as I used to, not that I like them any less (especially their classics). But despite my musical listening tendencies what remains unquestionable is that The Number of the Beast is ONE OF THE GREATEAST METAL ALBUMS EVER CREATED. I can understand and sympathize with those that say that this isn\u2019t Maiden\u2019s best, if they chose any of the four subsequent LPs or all of them instead, or even the preceding Killers. But then, I can do likewise with those who say this is their best. Bruce Dickinson\u2019s debut is such a well-rounded piece of work that deserves all and any accolades I can imagine. The Derek Riggs artwork is iconic beyond measure, the music within just perfect. It was released in 19-fuckin-82, people! Thrash didn\u2019t exist at that time; can you fathom that? It\u2019s mind-blowing!\n\nWith all due respect to the ill-fated Paul DiAnno, Iron Maiden got really lucky and struck the jackpot by choosing Bruce Dickinson as his replacement. DiAnno served its purpose of leading the punkish-sounding and embryonic form of Maiden into the front stage of the NWOBHM, but Bruce would take them to the upper echelons of all rock music. The Number of the Beast is a bridge between the two eras, as it contains traces of both their previous works and uses formulas they would adapt and improve in future releases, as their music became more complex and ambitious. Iron Maiden\u2019s legendary third LP maintains the energic pulse of their first two records, in part because the potent Clive Burr remained behind the kit, but also because Bruce knew he had to shine with his new band and employed all of his vocal potency and strong charisma to succeed in it. The chemistry was of immediate effect, and Bruce delivered some of the best performances of this career in this record. The native American-like chants in \u201cRun to the Hills\u201d, the powerful, long notes on \u201cChildren of the Damned\u201d or the spirited show on \u201cHallowed Be Thy Name\u201d\u2026revealed a frontman on a mission!\n\nThe rest of the band only got better, or at least as stupendously good as in Killers. While the aggression and speed of the preceding work was toned down a little bit, the longer, more complex compositions more than make for that. In any case, opener \u201cInvaders\u201d, a track that has been pretty much ignored by the band in live tours, probably due to the fact that they played several other songs from this LP, quickly picks where the band left, a fast-paced proto-Viking metal tune with an immediate head-bang inducing set of riffs, and the signature pouncy \u2018n\u2019 bouncy Steve Harris bass all over it. Then \u201cChildren of the Damned\u201d sort of cools things off, as half a taciturn ballad about a wretched man, that soon transforms into a faster, heavier tune, and has a demonic tapping guitar solo, classic of the NWOBHM years when it was all the rage. Adrian Smith and Dave Murray stand omnipotent in this record, their dual guitar attack as prolific, enticing and savory as usual. Side A closers are a couple of six-minuters that show the recaptured intent of writing something more demanding and multi-sectioned, as in \u201cThe Phantom of the Opera\u201d. \u201cThe Prisoner\u201d and \u201c22 Acacia Avenue\u201d might not reach the heights of the 7-minute mini epic of the debut LP, but they aren\u2019t far.\n\nSide B starts with the iconic title-track. That spooky narration intro by the immortal Barry Clayton always manages to make my skin hair stand, no matter how many times I\u2019ve listened to it. \u201cThe Number of the Beast\u201d is undoubtedly great, a classic piece of prime heavy metal for the ages, almost rivaling the intensity of the similarly long previous title-track \u201cKillers\u201d and featuring similar guitar solos, two halves, one by Adrian and the other by Bill, but probably having a slight advantage in metal hierarchy due to its more innovative song structure and signature sections. Bruce\u2019s scream sets the tone as the songs continues its build up towards the forceful solos. Then, a fan favorite, \u201cRun to the Hills\u201d, the song most non-metalheads know from the Irons, in great part due to Rock Band (or is it Guitar Hero?). My own first encounter with it was one cold Saturday morning around \u201997 or \u201898, watching VH1 classics. I remember recording the video on a VHS with several other musical videos plucked from both MTV and VH1. The drums are classic, many would-be drummers emulating the tribal paths laid by the late Burr. I love the track, but I vastly prefer the Live After Death version, as I feel the solo is more explosive and the band simply managed to play it better and tighter, somehow. \n\n\u201cGangland\u201d is no filler either, but probably the least impressive song here. I totally love the Dream Theater version when they covered this whole record as a tribute, double the length and a jazzier feel. The solid \u201cTotal Eclipse\u201d b-side from the \u201cRun to the Hills\u201d single follows on my \u201998 CD, but I\u2019ll skip it here right to the tremendous tour-de-force that is \u201cHallowed Be Thy Name\u201d, which currently ranks as my second favorite song in all of metaldom, only behind Judas Priest\u2019s \u201cPainkiller\u201d. It\u2019s most certainly my favorite Iron Maiden tune of all time, and curiously, a song I don\u2019t really enjoy listening to live, as I think they never manage to capture the mystique of both Bruce\u2019s performance here and the solos put on tape, the total opposite to another of my 7-minute favs by The Beast, \u201cFear of the Dark\u201d which seems to be continuously getting better and better on live renditions. \u201cHallowed Be Thy Name\u201d is just too darn flawless and perfect, a monumental piece of pure heavy metal charged with atmosphere and passion. It has quite the emotive build up, since that ominous bell strikes your eardrums and Bruce\u2019s most dramatic act holds you by the throat. The whole band contributes to its magnificent crescendo, as the instru-METAL final act hits you like an electric discharge. I can\u2019t think of a strongest closer in like\u2026 any other album or discography. \n\n\u201cAs the guards march me out to the courtyard\nSomebody cries from a cell \u2018God be with you\u2019,\nif there\u2019s a God then why has He let me go?\nAs I walk my life drifts before me, though the end is near I\u2019m not sorry\nCatch my soul, it\u2019s willing to fly awaaay\u201d\n\nAWESOME! That song alone could entail The Number of the Beast the title of masterpiece. Why some people don\u2019t recognize this album as such is entirely beyond me, but to each its own. I\u2019ve been happy to own this record since day one and that won\u2019t change in this life and probably the next, when I\u2019ll find myself dancing to Eddie\u2019s tune on the fiery plains of Hell. Though Iron Maiden's modern output has been hit or miss after Brave New World, their 80s classics will always stand out as the cream of the crop among all of heavy metal\u2019s vast and prolific universe. Even after four decades, Eddie\u2019s reign in Hell still makes us burn in excitement, and we will most undoubtedly burn as such for all eternity.\n",
        "\nToday marks the 40th anniversary of Iron Maiden's third studio album \"The Number of the Beast\". And man has it felt like forever since it released. But then again, this record in particular is not only the album that changed Iron Maiden forever, but I'd argue that it's easily one of the most influential metal records in the genre's history. And how did that happen? Well, you thank Paul Di'Anno for leaving the band, as they felt that his high usage of drugs and alcohol was heavily setting back his skills, along with Paul himself lacking a desire to continue with the band.\n\nSo then along came Bruce Dickinson. Bruce was in Samson before he grew an interest in Iron Maiden, but had a strong desire to be the vocalist for them. And with Paul out of the picture, it was his chance to get in. Well, as we'd all know, Bruce was accepted in the band, and they would go on to record and eventually released their third album in 1982 to much critical acclaim. But seeing how this is the album that permanently cemented Iron Maiden as a legendary band, I know I can't just do a typical review here. So sit back with me, as we look back on this album in a retrospect and see what makes TNOTB so damn good.\n\nSo we start things off with the instruments, which is where things are already feeling different. In the last two albums, Iron Maiden went for a heavy NWOBHM sound that sounded pretty nice. Here, however, the band leans more towards a traditional heavy metal sound, which sounds amazing. The guitars have a more powerful boom in their sound compared to the previous records, so its execution is more stronger. As for the drumming, it's also been improved heavily, as Clive Burr's drumming has a lot of strength in its beatings, but also let things back a bit to give the other instruments some room in their sound, which makes it all sound balanced in production. Even the bass is exceptional, as it not only follows along the guitars well, but it also sets up a strong foundation that stabilizes everything. But what really makes them all work is the versatility of the tone of each song. Some tracks like \"Children of the Damned\" are more laid-back and mighty in its atmosphere, whereas \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\" is much more epic in its structure and gives off a more grand landscape in its sound. Even the weaker track \"Gangland\" still has excellent instrumentals, as the guitar riffs still ring out with such force that empowers the atmosphere. Every single track on this album is special in its own instrumental, and would all work together to create one epic tale of the beast.\n\nBut then we get to the vocals, which is easily the biggest change in Iron Maiden's discography. Now, with all due respect to Paul Di'Anno, it was probably for the best that he left Iron Maiden, because while he had plenty of great vocal performances, Bruce would take those ideas and only enhance them to be even better. His voice is a lot more melodic in sound, and flows even better with the tracks than Paul ever could, and nowhere is this more apparent than in their signature track \"The Number of the Beast\". This song is an instrumental marvel with its melodic and epic guitar riffs and powerful drum beats, and Bruce would only magnify this with his voice. He starts it off with some whispers that give him a personality of uneasiness, but as the song goes on, Bruce gets more confident, which plays off with the instruments as they get more vast and epic. And when it all explodes into chaos, Bruce shows this perfectly with his high screams that hold the flow of the instrumental tightly. And don't even get me started with his vocals on the chorus, where at that point, he perfectly embodies the trust he has in the beast and his number. And that's just one song out of eight. In TNOTB, Bruce improves upon the already great work of Paul, as he would give the voice of the band a more energetic and prideful tone.\n\nEven the songwriting is fantastic. The lyrical abilities in the previous two albums were nice, but here, they would get even better. Take the lyrics to \"The Prisoner\" for example, where this verse quotes:\n\nI\u2019m on the run, I kill to eat\nI\u2019m starving now, feeling dead on my feet\nGoing all the way, I\u2019m nature\u2019s beast\nDo what I want and do as I please\n\nThis verse shows that the prisoner has fled the prison, and is now having to kill just to eat. Like in the previous albums, they're simple, but the way it is worded makes the story feel more urgent, as the reader worries if the prisoner will get caught. But then we move on to this verse:\n\nRun, fight to breathe, it\u2019s tough\nNow you see me, aha, now you don\u2019t\nBreak the walls I\u2019m coming out\n\nNot a prisoner, I\u2019m a free man\nAnd my blood is my own now\nDon\u2019t care where the past was\nI know where I\u2019m going... out!\n\nBasically, the prisoner has now become a free man, as he runs in joy that he is no longer just another number in a prison system. The tone changes in the lyrics blend in smoothly, as the reader now feels great to see the prisoner free again. Furthermore, this goes hand-to-hand with the instruments and vocals well, as the energized guitar riffs and fierce drum beats further push the atmosphere of uncertainty of the escape, and Bruce's powerful vocals reflect the confidence the prisoner has in escaping. Pretty much all of the stories the album tells are simple, but effective in its narrative of the beast, and would flow well with the instrumentals and vocals.\n\nIf there were any doubts that Iron Maiden won't be successful and would eventually fade into obscurity, then this album would destroy any of that and officially push the band into stardom. The instrumentals are stellar with its more animated style, Bruce's vocals would only further magnify the power of the instruments, and the lyrics once again continue to tell simple, but great stories. This album would go on to be the blueprint for Iron Maiden's future works of epic and melodic heavy metal, and its influence in the band and the metal genre in general still stands to this day. When it comes to awakening the beast, \"The Number of the Beast\" is one beast you don't wanna mess with.\n",
        "\nIt's funny when the big picture is clear and you realize that the introduction of synthesizers barely excited the fans when the band surprised the world with Somewhere in Time two years earlier. This new change seemed to convince few at a time when huge thrash metal gems were being released in 1986, while on the other hand power metal was still in its infancy. However, 1988 was another year full of great thrash metal successes and more and more Iron Maiden seemed to become dated to the point that saying that Operation: Mindcrime of the same year is better than this one. I had also read someone who said that The House of Atreus I and The Spectre Within eat this album alive. I don't know how convinced they are of that, but I think some people are not in a position to speak because they compare totally different acts separated geographically by a puddle of water, sometimes by year, and especially by style. Because they are completely different styles. Not even the \"it's a concept album\" argument justifies bringing up such hateful comparisons. If you ask me, The House of Atreus I is the only competent candidate in this staging, because it's an album I appreciate very much, as much as this one.\n\nSeventh Son of a Seventh Son is brutal in the sense that, well, it sounds like a greatest hits album, and certainly Can I Play With Madness would make your grandmother dance. The previous album used synth guitars, but here the synths, or rather keyboards, are used in almost all the songs to give them that European touch. Probably this so-called concept album makes you assume that the album is a rock opera, with many characters, acoustic passages and pompous interludes worthy of standing up and clapping for a long time. But the reality is different, this album lacks a concept lyrically, but the lyrics are something I often ignore in music, from cheesy fairies to raping gore. Lyrics are the last thing I look at in a band, and ultimately bad lyrics can only disfavor a band if they suck musically as well. Some see this album as the twin brother of Somewhere In Time, and there's certainly no unanimity on which is superior to which, however, I don't see this album as a direct continuation of another work, but as a stellar work without failed attempts of experimentation. There is also a bit of power/AOR influence from the late 80s. Maybe if it was released two years later it would be a bit late, so it's a better fit as the immediate successor to Somewhere In Time.\n\nThere's a very particular anecdote regarding the songwriting that gave me mixed feelings. I don't know exactly why but for a long time I had the unconscious feeling that Only The Good Die Young wasn't quite a real song but a kind of outro more like. It's evident that is not the case, and with four and a half minutes it's a more epic, substantial song that still connects with the most distinctive elements to close this work with dignity, and not to mention that some think this song supposedly showed signs of what NPFTD would be, which is false for the reasons just stated. Instead of the historicist theme, this time they are based on a simpler narrative enriched with the power/folk-tinged riffs \u2014The Prophecy\u2014, the magnificent melodies, the acoustic games, and the progressive passages \u2014Infinite Dreams\u2014 that place this record as one of their highlights and as one of the most underrated albums of this stage. Despite the flawed concept in lyrical terms, the flow of the songs does work as a concept album: \"The Prophecy\" for example begins calm and angelic, and feels like a sequel to the monstrous title track that was denser and focused on a battle of solos that probably inspired songs like Hangar 18. \"The Clairvoyant\" brings the most characteristic sound of the twin guitars and also the combination of thick bass riffs and drums that has always given rise to a sound that no one else has managed to reproduce.\n\nRegarding the production, it's plausible the sound work of Martin Birch who give this album its own personality and identity, everything in its place and with good levels between each instrument, and many reverberations in the guitars that I definitely recommend since it feels more enveloping with the most polished rhythmic base. Bruce's throat is nice to hear despite showing signs of losing his operatic voice, although his innate qualities always enhance the more aggressive voice he has decided to adopt here. This album was the final card before many changes came, and it was also the final chapter of some traditions that never seemed to go away. Leaving No Prayer For The Dying aside, this cover is the last truly inspired artwork that the legendary Derek Riggs drew before the band decided to experiment with various artists in the future. In the cover art, quite surreal by the way, we can see Eddie with the always crazy countenance emerging from a glacial surface clutching a heart from its entrails whose physiognomy would be the suspiciously seventh son; then a green/red apple is also observed, which perhaps symbolizes the yin/yang with those colors given that good/evil is a recurring concept on the album. They're references that not many pay attention to but was always the grace of their albums, details in which you can sit and stare, and this one is not up to the previous two but still has subtle and interesting details.\n\nAs I said, despite being mildly influenced by the AOR and despite the attract-the-opposite-sex lyrics in The Evil That Men Do, during its release the band never offered (nor showed) an elegant, glamorous, and sexy image; because in no way there's any bad effort or sign to spoil it in a too soft way with Can I Play With Madness that almost flirts with the limits of pop. The closer may not leave you speechless after so much spoiled wonder, but it's an excellent ending with an irresistible chorus that when it ends leaves us wanting for more, and conveys the feeling of having heard one of those unrepeatable albums that many bands only manage to record once in their whole career. I know that before this they had published titles like Killers or Powerslave, of very high levels. But certainly, everything they did after this never reached such a compact, perfect level again. I couldn't single out one above the rest, but of course, this would be not only among their best but also among the best of 80s heavy metal ever. There are no such factors that conditioned its alleged \"condemnation\" to ostracism, no one even has to invent excuses like in 1986-1990 there were records during the heyday of thrash metal and power metal that unluckily overshadowed this. Taking away that senseless mental movie, this is a beautiful album inside and out.\n",
        "\nWhere to start with this complete magnum opus. How about with the context, just to emphasise how uncannily the making of this album was. After the World Slavery tour, the band was exhausted and Bruce suggested writing an acoustic album. Of course the fact that he has no writing credits on Somewhere In Time might be an indicator of what the band thought of that. With this exhaustion came a short break for the band, followed by the unexpected composition of their absolute best album in my opinion, and my favourite album of all time. Everything, from the inhuman album cover, to the futuristic theme, to the lyrics, to the synths, to the riffs and solos and lyrics and vocal delivery, I believe that this is probably the only fully perfect album. \n\nStarting with the songwriting, there is the same level of ambition that is found on Powerslave, but instead of being more balls-to-the-wall like that album, this album is more progressive and ambitious in the sense of musical pacing and tension-building rather than the content itself, which is still perfect. This is exemplified in songs such as Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner and Alexander The Great, which may be just about my favourite song of all time, too. These tracks are longer and naturally rely on huge build-ups that don't drag on for too long. The nuances and emotion in the solos of these songs and the record in general have been evidently written with thought, and noticeably harmonic and complement the rhythm section well. \n\nThe use of guitar synths as well as regular synths make the album sound far ahead of its time, not in terms of composition but in production, and it sounds perfect, especially if you manage to get a less compressed physical version, the production makes the record sound like an experience rather than a listen, and helps to make the songs extremely memorable. When this is coupled with the massive solo sections and during haunting spacey-sounding melodies (see the intro to Wasted Years), there is pure musical perfection, and it is addicting. I don't really want to compare the band to other acts, but how similar this album is to Screaming For Vengeance production-wise is crazy, but it is utilised in a completely different way to match with the more epic-sounding and less rock 'n roll-based tracks on Somewhere In Time. \n\nThe slower songs here show how dynamic Iron Maiden can be, particularly Wasted Years and Sea of Madness, the latter of which has a beautiful, unforgettable middle section featuring one of Bruce's undeniable highlights of his singing career. Most of the rhythms on this album are the iconic gallops that Maiden is known for, and is probably the most prominent characteristic of the album that makes it sound like heavy metal. However, I personally think that it is much better when the band picks up the pace and bursts out with a Deja Vu or something similar, which is when the melodies are at their most intense and most captivating, which continues my point of the memorability of the songs; they are not formulaic, by-the-numbers songs, but rather separate, life-consuming experiences.\n\nAdditionally, the anthemic feeling of the majority of these songs makes it confusing as to why this entire album has been neglected by the band in live performances, with half of the tracklist seldom played (they played Loneliness for one show, Sea of Madness for about half of the Somewhere In Time tour, they never played Deja Vu and they never played Alexander The Great, which is ridiculous). It would be awesome to see the band give this album at least some love for their next tour, but it's understandable the record has a very processed and layered sound that is hard to imitate live.\n\nI'm not exaggerating when I say that this is the single most important album to me, and one that deserves its legendary status. Somewhere In Time is something that shouldn't be ignored, there are many (relatively) deep cuts on here that are mind-blowing. The songwriting is perfect, the production is perfect, the riffs are perfect, the vocals, the guitar tone, it all contributes to one of the very few flawless records to ever exist, and is in my opinion the undisputed best album of all time.\n",
        "\nFirstly, I want to preface this review by saying that I'm a diehard Iron Maiden fanboy, if you couldn't tell by the title or my past reviews. Bearing that in mind, take any noticeable bias in this review with a grain of salt. Some people have bashed The Writing on the Wall for \"not sounding Maiden enough\", and these people (not naming any names) will bash anything Iron Maiden puts out regardless of what it sounds like. \n\nI guarantee you if this single was a by-the-book Iron Maiden song that didn't differentiate from the band's style whatsoever, then these same people would be ripping the shit out of it and calling it unoriginal. Nevertheless, those people can continue being close-minded, while the rest of the world either likes or dislikes new material for what it is.\n\nWith that rant over, I'd like to talk about how this song took me completely by surprise. It opens with an acoustic intro, which is something very akin to The Book of Souls, and seems to pick up where the band left off. Then, the mood changes completely, almost as if the band intentionally catches you off guard, and then plunges you head-first into some of their most bizarre music this side of 2000. The main riff is bluesy, encapsulating, and above all else, very fucking catchy. \n\nThe song picks up here and doesn't let up for almost 6 minutes, the guitar work is classic Iron Maiden with a southern rock-twinge, whilst still retaining the heaviness. The chords used may resemble the band's definitive sound, but it still sounds different to anything the band had previously written. The riffs are triumphant and epic, and once again are reminiscent of The Book of Souls, but they capture a much more old-school sound that could be considered more accessible, but the guitar work still kicks ass. \n\nThe most impressive thing about The Writing On The Wall is Bruce's vocals. Seriously, he's pushing 63 and can sing better than most 20 year old singers. Fucking phenomenal, he's the best vocalist in the world and he sings the lyrics like he knows it. He reaches high notes that most people 25 years younger than him would struggle with, and all of his cadences match with Nicko's ride-heavy beats. His drones during the chorus are classic, it has almost became a formula for him, and it works like a charm.\n\nWith very catchy and anthemic songwriting, as well as an unusual twist compared to Iron Maiden's typical style, this single is very enjoyable. You might not enjoy it if you don't like classic rock or only like morbid-sounding metal, but The Writing On The Wall, in my opinion, is a beautiful song, and marks a return after 6 years of stagnancy, apart from a few live albums.\n",
        "\nThe moment they decided to put their foot on the brake after Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, Arry's Institute no longer found works as extremely compact/accessible as those that were pulled from the sleeve in the eighties; then the musical differences between Dickinson and the other members of the band became more and more evident over time, carried along since the days of Somewhere in Time. After Dickinson's controversial and awkward departure from the final tour, Iron Maiden managed that important and critical transition to their new reality. While changing a vocalist is always very complicated for any line-up, in the case of this band it seemed like a truly titanic task due to the charisma, personality of Bruce, who despite not having been there from day one, he was always accepted, adored and embraced by all the band's followers. I'm not going to put the same peroration about Bayley's life in metal, so I'll be skeptical and to the point.\n\nGoing back to my juvenile impressions, \u201cSign of the Cross\u201d strikes me as a true masterpiece without question and accumulates more than enough merit to be considered a full-blown Maiden classic. The dark, haunting Gregorian chants are the perfect introduction to the equally dark and haunting entry of the bass/acoustic-guitar pair, soon accompanied by the whispering Blaze's vocals and, later, by the delicate but firm drum rolls, the severe and atmospheric keyboards, and the simple chords of the electric guitar (still with no distortion) that unite a growing succession of layers that captivates you without remedy. This intro, folks, is a fucking wonder.\n\nThe first three songs are arguably the best known, and what follows is where we really enter the darkest field of The X Factor. Although these eight remaining songs have truly brilliant moments, apparently many agree that they sin to repeat structures too much and even the inspiration is accompanied in irregularly. Acoustic intros, whispering vocals, somewhat soulless mid-paced, darkness, timid oh-oh-ohs and honeyed melodies will accompany us, starting with the pretty and sad \u201cFortunes of War\u201d. Its introduction is actually beautiful, and the succession of the somewhat bouncy passages that follows is interesting at least, despite they could've shortened a little in order to advance the entry of the verse. The chorus doesn't drive me energetically crazy either, but it does grab me emotionally because the intention of the song (and the album per se) is to create a depressing and pessimistic atmosphere. I get why people are not as fond as I do, and perhaps some songs are repeated insistently, surely, but when they start to put speed the things improve a lot. All this has my approval, despite some saying that anti-metal production makes the guitars sound bubbled.\n\nActually, there are songs that start with an interesting riff full of wah-wah that eventually links up with what seems a simple but very effective rhythm that accompanies the powerful voices, notably deep and different from Bruce's tonality that would never deserve to be compared. This formula is much more perceptible in \u201cLord of the Flies\u201d, the second single from the album after \u201cMan on the Edge\u201d, and they didn't have much choice as both are the only direct songs. In general, this album offers more than a successful chorus, some magnificent melodies and excellent bass, although most traditionalist fans probably think that the lack of punch is noted as far as production is concerned. Literary inspiration is common in Iron Maiden's lyrics, and they have the habit of releasing songs with interesting lyrics that don't save them from being bad often, but I can assure you that is not the case this time!\n\n\"Look for the Truth\" begins with an opening guitar somewhat akin to Guns N Roses's Civil War which has a wonderfully melancholic melody that grows and evolves with luscious drama thanks to Blaze's powerful, raspy demonstration. It strikes me as one of the brightest moments of the entire album. \"The Aftermath\" pulls some hard rock rhythms that remind me of things we had seen in the previous two albums but far improved thanks to the epic, powerful vocal lines: After the war / Left feeling no one has won / After the war / What does a soldier become?... Undoubtedly, it represents a turning point towards a remarkably atmospheric second half that gives rise to rhythms changes that are quite full of cohesion. I could highlight the other songs individually, but it would be too long. It's obvious they won't be considered the band's essential repertoire and rather go unnoticed as fillers, but you should give them a chance at least. The album ends with \u201cThe Unbeliever\u201d, a song that we could indeed classify as progressive in some passages and alternates complex, arrhythmic, unexpected sections with other powerful Maidenesque moments. It is a brave and daring cut that marks the path of what was to happen in the years to come and symbolizes what this record means well, both in itself and as a prop, turning point in their future career.\n\nStructurally, The X Factor is the first really long album and with it, they opened a door that has never been closed, so it has been the trend in their future works more or less. This album is based on mostly long, complex songs (they say progressive but I don't dare to put a label on them lightly) that alternates many acoustic moments (eight of the eleven songs begin with acoustic intros), changes, revisions, and no rush to finish. The result of this formula is a very long album that pleases passive and less restless fans but exasperates anxious ones who prefer musical synopsis. From all their modern records only The X Factor comes close to perfection. The reasons? Well, I think Blaze does best as a vocalist for long songs. The album's depressing atmosphere is much more consistent than A Matter of Life and Death as Blaze's vocal nuances are less happy than Bruce's on his counterpart album. This is my most sincere point of view, with no controversial intention because both vocalists perform very well, but Blaze did better.\n",
        "\nThe mid-nineties were not good times for Iron Maiden and heavy metal as we know it. The British institute had to deal with the extremely complicated replacement of their iconic vocalist Bruce Dickinson, while the style that made them great a few years ago began to lose the masses due to the unstoppable rise of alternative rock and the increasingly extreme and attractive variants for the new generations. Many of the classic bands that succeded through the 80s did suffer severe identity and popularity crises in the following decade, and the once-all-powerful Iron Maiden were not spared even though, a few years earlier, they were touching heavens on immense tours gaining the unconditional devotion of half the world.\n\nThen, the idea of linking soccer with the rise of computers may seem strange and not a brilliant idea, or at least it isn\u2019t enough support for a heavy metal album. Unlike The X factor, this album doesn't contain any of the completely dark atmospheres, but on the contrary offers somewhat happy epics that are the prequel to what we would witness in Brave New World. I don't know what Steve Harris was thinking when he released it, I mean, the idea around the album. It's not a long album in terms of tracks, eight is not bad. The problem may be its length, resulting in way too long songs in the whole equation. The clear, obvious (and worst at most) example is the single \"The Angel and the Gambler\": if I had to define it I would say that it is a bunch of good ideas killed by the almost 10 minutes it lasts. The main riff and the vocal melody don\u2019t look despicable to me, but that interlude is very tiring as the verse is repeated about 70 times.\n\nCuriously, it was published in the same year the World Cup France was held and it was the reason they wanted to extend the football concept with the album promotion. Perhaps among other songs, the one that is often considered totally dispensable is \u201cComo est\u00e1is amigos\u201d, where the band supposedly show the cerebral dryness at the songwriting level they were going through. But from my perspective, the closer looks like if everything on this album had been heard before, but better. The cover art, although different, is far from the mythical eighties that used to be loaded with incredible details. The lyrics have nothing to do with classics like Revelations, Rime Of The Ancient Mariner or Hallowed Be Thy Name, to name a few. Despite my unconditional love for this album, I must admit that the poor Blaze was beginning to show signs of fatigue that led to his final break as the tour was ending off. When Maiden dropped in popularity at this point, it led them to perform in venues with a few thousand people and cancel some shows in the US due to Blaze's vocal condition.\n\nThis was the first Maiden record I ever heard, so these are my juvenile impressions: it must be said that in Virtual XI we find more significant changes and novelties in terms of visuality, concept level, style, spirit and sound. It's not Blaze's voice this time. For this reason, and despite being what everyone tends to scrutinize and judge, on this album the vocal presence is less diluted between the instruments compared to The X Factor. Perhaps his voice overwhelms but it's not invasive either. Like the previous disc, they write the long and complex pre-No Prayer of the Dying songs, but instead of turning them epic and dressing them with luminous synthesizers and aggressive airy production, they opted for a jovial, introspective sound. It still has a dark aura, but while the band entered in a dark cavern with The X Factor, in this Virtual XI they practically see the light at the end of the tunnel, as if they were about to get out of it.\n\nI still carry it in the car and still don't comprehend all the beatings it receives 20 years later. Probably I do accept that \"The Angel and The Gambler\" is way too long and repetitive (but has good moments), yet the other songs are great and they're 100% Iron Maiden. By the way, despite the disrepute and inquisitorial practice that fell on Blaze for replacing Dickinson, his solo project still proves that he was a devoted, hard-working guy who knows how to do good heavy metal as God commands. He's not Bruce Dickinson, but he left a couple of very worthy records in the little passing he did in this band. Obviously it's not a masterwork, but it is an album whose bad reputation has no foundations that many believe it has.\n",
        "\nFor four decades, the trajectory of this band was based on a proposal that prioritizes the art principles over the industry requirements. During their ascent in the 80s, the band overwhelmingly embodied their identity with works whose creative quality were according to the vision that Steve Harris had regarding how heavy metal should sound in a context where the MTV empire seemed to decide his chosen ones categorically, as well as to ignore those who didn't meet the necessary requirements to be located on the top. Iron Maiden knew how to fight that battle but they also prevailed on their own way thanks to Rod Smallwood's hard management, the responsible dude for their rapid and concise rise to the Elysium of Metal and Rock. With the world at his feet after the overwhelming success obtained with Powerslave and the successful immortalized tour in Live After Death, Dickinson thinks it was the opportunity to replicate what Led Zeppelin did in Physical Graffiti; in other words, unleash his creative freedom. Nonetheless, Harris and the rest of the teammates thought it was a risky idea that could mean relegation. In those years, it was not for less in a context when reaching the top could be as simple as falling off the cliff. You never really know but I read in another review that Dance of Death was probably the closest thing to a Led Zeppelin tribute, so the time wasn't right yet. I'm glad to know that I'm not the only one who thinks this way, as it only reinforces my theory even more. Probably instead of this, we would have had a kind of early Dance of Death.\n\nA guitar intro with synth effects gives way to the martial rhythm and subsequent explosions: Caught Somewhere In Time begins this experience as strange as fascinating. This riff exudes drama at its finest amid the relentless gallop led by Harris and the ever-present, versatile Nicko McBrain. The axes Smith/Murray dispatch an anthology guitar work, especially in the solos section, where each one brings out their resources with a chilling category. Regarding Bruce Dickinson... well, there's little that can be said about such a vocal performance that prioritizes theatricality. Come on, it's a purely divine drama! By the way, if you compare this record with The Number of The Beast or any Samson album, the maturity the vocalist acquired at this point can be impressively stressful for many.\n\nThis is what heavy metal is: apart from being tough to polish and mold, any misstep \u2013despite good intentions\u2013 could spell the end. Faced with this crossroads, the band decided to work on their compositions more, strengthening elements such as the choirs and the accurate melodies that finally trapped their increasingly numerous fans. Of course, Adrian Smith and Dave Murray prove that the category is not acquired from scratch but is included in the DNA. Nor can we rule out the superb cover art by Derek Riggs, one of the greatest and best illustrators both on and off metal. By then, Maiden's covers have become an icon for metal starters as well as those just joining or still remaining outside the genre. Powerslave's superb cover already announced what the next album would be, with that series of hidden messages and curiosities that made its art unique. With the already consolidated band at the image level, Somewhere In Time presented an art totally dedicated to the fans, with a series of hidden messages related to both the band and literary references (Flight Of Icarus, 2 Minutes to Midnight) and films (Blade Runner, Terminator) that made up their universe, whose borders spread throughout the galaxy.\n\nWasted Years is the absolute hit and acquires this status on its own merit. I'm not really exaggerating if you consider that this band conceived their popularity based on live shows and their own essence. Bear this in mind, the media world offered a lot of money in exchange for the artists to simplify their music further to make it more accessible to people's ears. Just notice the superb intro by Adrian Smith \u2013with McBrain's drums and Harris's ubiquitous bass backing up as a cushion\u2013, is the living proof that honesty and virtuosity can go hand in hand and can even mark a moment in your life. It's a matter of reading the lyrics to better understand what maturity is: do realize that you're living the golden years, it's not worth digging into the past when the present is what matters. Truly one of their best singalong chorus, the kind where a crowded stadium sings it looking up at the sky and holding their fists high.\n\nThe flickered groove of Sea Of Madness is a clear sign that not many bands knew how to squeeze all the juice out in terms of speediness. This song is proof of a masterful versatility piece, making difficulty an easy game, and reaching directly to our senses with those richly nuanced choruses, always in favor of music. McBrain's drums acquire a fundamental role in this one. Leaving aside track-by-track for a while, it's time to talk about the production. Martin Birch was the man behind those memorable works with which, from 1981 to early 90s (well, latest 80s according to the diehard taliban metalheads), Iron Maiden dominated the 'Metal Planet' to the detriment of bands that, despite their reputation and greater trajectory, started to fall behind quickly (AC/DC, Kiss, Judas Priest, UFO). Sea Of Madness, without being such a well-known song, reflected the overwhelming power of an absolutely distinctive label regarding the heavy metal of the epoch. Guitars are the truly outstanding aspect of the production; for some tastes, it may sound less sharp than in Powerslave, but fortunately for others, it sounds less light and sugary than in Seventh Son. The synthesizers aren't even prominent and it was a brutal lesson to other bands on how to use this element properly despite this band were newbies with this new \"toy\", just like them.\n\nIn terms of musicality, the progressive and epic orientation highlighted in previous works confirms their unquestionable validity in songs like Heaven Can Wait, The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner and Alexander The Great. Perhaps these songs seem structurally simple on the surface, but they really explain their complexity very characteristic of a more experienced band at the time of writing. Technical expertise alone is not enough when creativity is decisive both in creating and razing the entire world. The chorus in the middle section of the closer \u2013after three and a half minutes\u2013 reflects their authenticity, destined to be erected as a hymn from here to eternity. Speaking of the entire vinyl, the B side reflects the more accessible side, although the other side is not far exempt.\n\nThe Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner is the most progressive and theatrical facet that can catch everyone who thinks that the secret to success lies in an arena rock song. Adrian Smith and Dave Murray wrote their names in stones thanks to the awe-inspiring guitar work. While K.K. Downing and Glenn Tipton were the pioneers in the twin guitars matter, Smith and Murray perfected the formula to the point of inspiring a whole generation of young people who wanted to play an instrument. The same goes for Steve Harris, a bassist songwriter whose devotion to Genesis and Jethro Tull would be illustrated in works like the album that concerns here. Also, if we take into account the lyrics based on Alan Sillitoe's work (English writer, one of the pioneers of the social protest novel during the mid-20th century), there's no other option but to fall in love with such a large sample of quality with which these guys validate their speech. At this point, they understood that heavy metal could go far beyond cliches.\n\nSomewhere In Time was a strange disc for a whole generation that never imagined the use of synthesizers. \"You can't play heavy metal with synthesizers\", Bruce Dickinson proclaimed it with authority in those days, when heavy metal truly established a series of golden rules that at the slightest attempt to do \u2013regardless of the intentions\u2013 could mean the punishment of his fans, resulting in a slow but painful death many times. But the already imposed dogmas mattered little and nothing, and Somewhere In Time swept away all existing prejudices. This album was one of the most difficult to conceive, due in large part to the growing and increasingly notorious creative ideas within the band, especially between the singer and boss bassist. Both Powerslave and Seventh Son represent milestones in their career that, until 1986, were a decade old. However, we often forget that between these two works there's a rather unique one, which will set the artistic direction that'll definitely separate them from the rest of the genre. They believed it was time to play in their own league without explaining it to anyone. The moment came and Somewhere In Time took advantage of this magically; a work that generated an unsuspected controversy, beyond its status as classic nowadays.\n\nThe true highlight is the epic Alexander The Great, which is based on the historical character who took the Persian Empire over and its surroundings, one of the largest kingdoms on the planet. His image has inspired hundreds of artists from all walks of life who paid tribute to him and/or immerse themselves in the mysteries that surrounded him as a conqueror and young military strategist. Musically, the band shows their virtues as a single force where the sum of all forces makes up an impregnable whole. Bruce, in the beginning, saw Iron Maiden a similar to his favorite band: Deep Purple. It is a somewhat risky comparison but no less true if we take into account that each musician, in a self-taught condition, ended up acquiring a similar reputation to that of any graduate of the best conservatorium. Hence why the closer is undoubtedly a bombastic ending that over the years has earned a well-deserved place as a fundamental pick ever.\n\nPerhaps their consecration with Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son relegated it to the background, to the point that the band \u2013especially Harris and, above all, Dickinson\u2013 consider this album a minor work, a statement reflected in the scarce inclusion of some tracks on the live sets since Dickinson's and Smith's return. Despite being a somewhat vilified work by its own creators, Somewhere In Time masterfully portrays the artistic vocation that still pulls the strings in creative matters. Even Derek Riggs portrayed that point of view directly inspired by the dystopian future that Ridley Scott brought to the big screen with Blade Runner in the 1980s. Somewhere in time, in the middle sea of daily madness that surrounds us, Eddie is still more alive than ever despite being close to retirement after a lifetime on the road. Where some see a waste of time compared to what could be, they make it clear that the golden years are lived today, yesterday and forever.\n",
        "\nI approached Iron Maiden\u2019s seventeenth full-length album Senjutsu in the same way as I approach all new releases from glorious bands of the past: with a mixture of hopeful excitement and reluctant dread that the new album won\u2019t be anywhere near the glory days of years past. In this sense, Senjutsu turned out to be a pleasant surprise, showing that, even though they are no longer the reckoning force of 40 years ago, Iron Maiden are still a relevant voice in today\u2019s metal landscape. This conclusion is even more surprising if one considers that I have not been impressed by any of the recent releases by the band, including the oft venerated Book of Souls. \n\nSo what\u2019s Senjutsu\u2019s secret? In two words: strong songwriting. Yes, it\u2019s that simple. Forty-one years on after they have started their recording career, Iron Maiden can still write memorable heavy metal tunes that are both fun and arousing. The songwriting formula hasn\u2019t changed much over the years: a powerful combination of galloping bass grooves, twin guitar leads and riffs, tight drumming, blazing guitar solos and Bruce Dickinson\u2019s soaring dramatic vocals that often double the main guitar melody. Fast songs alternate to epic, brooding mid-tempos (giving off strong X Factor vibes) and ballads, creating a varied tracklist that keeps things fresh and entertaining. Structurally, the songs are not too complex, despite the lengthy duration of some of them. There are extended solos and instrumental sections, and the lengthier songs feature multiple parts, but it is all very accessible and memorable, only tiptoeing on the line that crosses into progressive metal. \n\nSo far nothing new under the sun as far as any standard Iron Maiden album is concerned. The difference compared to the band\u2019s most recent records is that Senjutsu contains a handful of truly inspired songs, with memorable instrumental sections and great vocal melodies. Most of these tracks can be found on Disc 2 of this 81+ minute long double album. \u201cDarkest Hour\u201d is a sublime ballad infused with pathos and drama thanks to Dickinson\u2019s fantastic vocal performance. The emotional solo in the second half of the song is another unmissable moment of the track, and a true highlight of the whole record as well. \u201cThe Parchment\u201d is probably the best song off Senjutsu It is a strongly progressive piece, with some daring tempo changes, a spectacular instrumental section, and a fabulous doomsday verse that sends chills down my spine every single time (strong Seventh Son of a Seventh Son vibes here!), showing that Maiden can still bite when they want to. Album closer \u201cHell on Earth\u201d is another strong contender for best track of the album, twisting between delicate acoustic arpeggios and epic galloping guitar riffs. Disc 1 is slightly more average, but there are some glorious moments there too, like the title-track, a very catchy and easy-listening track that shows how consummate Maiden are as songwriters. \n\nSenjutsu also introduces a couple of unexpected sonic twists, like the surprising bluesy guitars of \u201cThe Writing on the Wall\u201d or the vaguely 1970s, Floydian intro of \u201cLost in a Lost World\u201d. There is nothing that truly innovates or changes the musical direction the band have been following over the past 40 years, but it is nevertheless refreshing to see that Maiden have not lost the appetite for subtle sonic experiments, seventeen albums into their discography. \n\nThe rest of the material is slightly less impressive, with tracks like \u201cDays of Future Past\u201d, \u201c\u201dThe Time Machine\u201d and even the slow winding \u201cDeath of the Celts\u201d coming across a somewhat too derivative and flat. This is probably the main gripe I have with the album: if instead of releasing a double disc of over 81 minutes, Maiden had applied a little more quality control and reduced the material to five or six songs for half the length of the LP, this could have been one of the strongest albums the band has released since the 1990s. Nevertheless, Senjutsu stands tall in the band\u2019s recent discography and represents a true return to form for Iron Maiden.\n",
        "\nOf all the albums in the massive Iron Maiden catalogue, it's not even a contest that this album, tied with Killers, are the fan favourites, and with good reason. While this remains to be my personal least favourite of the band's run of records from 1982-1988, it's still a colossal, unstoppable, near-perfect assault of melodic heavy metal, and everything from the album cover, to the production, to the lyrics, to the solos, to the riffs all kick ass. The production is probably what I should talk about first; it hasn't changed much since Piece of Mind, but the lead guitars do sound much drier, which certainly fits with the Egyptian vibe of this album.\n\nEven though the title track may be the only song that revolves around this topic, the entire album sounds very eastern and hypnotic in terms of sonorities, such as the intro riff of Back in the Village, the harmonies in The Duellists, the main riff of Two Minutes to Midnight, and the huge middle section of Rime of The Ancient Mariner, which I will talk about more deeply later on. But, the guitar tone is seriously crunchy in comparison to other bands of Iron Maiden's style at the time. \n\nThe melodies on Powerslave are excellent, if you were to ask me what my top 10 favourite Maiden solos would be, about 6 or 7 of them would be on here. During tracks like Flash of the Blade and The Duellists, the lead work is very melancholy, and similar to Still Life and To Tame a Land from the previous record. At other points in the album, the guitar solos are frantic, but are simultaneously beautiful, such as in Aces High.\n\nThe vocals on Powerslave might be Bruce's best performance, as he boasts some of his most insanely high notes in almost every track. His voice may have been shot during the World Slavery tour, but having to sing these hooks 180 times in a year would kill anyone's lung capacity. Nevertheless, his vocal work on Powerslave is incredible, and Dickinson is at his most dynamic. The drumming here is intricate as ever, and although Nicko McBrain isn't credited for any writing on this record, he definitely understands how to keep the songs together, and vastly improves the atmosphere of some tracks, such as the ride cymbal alternation during the tempo change in Two Minutes to Midnight.\n\nActual songwriting on this album is iconic almost entirely throughout, it starts straight away with 2 anthems that you've heard a million times each, and they are still phenomenal songs. When I was lucky enough to see Maiden in 2018, they opened with those two songs, which shows how prominent they still are in the band's legacy. However, I would argue that half of this record is very underrated, the instrumental Losfer Words is an odd instrumental, but it's still very catchy, and the melodies are very upbeat, it's not a track that I would listen to usually, but if I'm listening to this album, I never skip Losfer Words.\n\nFlash of the Blade, on the other hand, is a great song, the vocals are amazing, the main riff and the solo also heavily flex the band's influence on power metal. The Duellists is also incredible, if slightly overlong, but its middle section is one of the band's absolute finest moments. My personal favourite of the underappreciated songs on Powerslave is Back in the Village, a bizarre song that recalls The Prisoner lyrically, and honestly what makes this song so good is the rapid riffing style, although musically it may seem quite bland and formulaic, you can't deny that the energy in Back in the Village really makes the song what it is. \n\nFinally, the final two songs on the album may be the biggest examples of the ambitious songwriting of Powerslave. The title track is powerful, malevolent, ominous and touching at the same time. The vocal harmonies during the chorus are haunting, and give the song a very sombre undertone, not to mention that the riffs are amazing and the solo is one of the band's greatest. The closer, the monumental Rime of the Ancient Mariner, is a perfect example of how to write a long song. It is littered with dynamic, rich ornamentation, such as the quiet part, where a verse from the eponymous poem is recited, accompanied with the eerie creaking of floorboards, and the cawing of birds.\n\nThe band really nailed it with this song, and the orchestral feeling that some of the riffs during the middle section have really enhance the baroque atmosphere, and once again, Bruce's vocals are almost inhuman, and he definitely is the icing on the dramatic cake of this song. \n\nOverall, Powerslave is an essential album, it is like Defenders of the Faith's older, brawnier and also more handsome brother. It has everything that a fan of Iron Maiden would want, in every song. The only reason I don't think it is as good as some of the band's other records is because it just doesn't seem as infectious or memorable as Somewhere in Time, or Seventh Son, but this is only slightly noticeable, and really is subjective.\n",
        "\nWhen you like a band so much, there's a sense of pride and respect for all they've done. It's an accomplishment that you feel as your own. Since Maiden is my favorite band of all time, I'm even one to say that they mostly never failed. But as age and maturity followed on, I became more open minded to their albums that i didn't think so good of, but also more rational and critical of their career as a whole. \n\nThat said, i think they actually started off pretty well themselves, specially within their context. It was the beginning of the 80's and, with that, you could very much say that this is a 70's heavy rock album. After all, many of these songs were first written in the previous decade and, of course, musical tendencies and cultural conceptions are procedural, so much so that, in its core, their debut album sound much like the novelties and archetypes of the ongoing \"NWOBHM\", with reminiscences to punk rock, traditional hard rock from the 70's, etc. But, much to the band's favor, it's also a very wholehearted effort into something fresh and bold. There's a lot of bright and energetic ideas put into display here, some of which will be better designed and executed beginning from Killers, albeit some of them are already well played on this debut.\n\nThe variety, for starters, is tremendous. \"Prowler\" comes as a vivid rocker with great riffs, very heavy metal lyrics and a fun vibe to start from. Then, we're into a wildly different landscape with \"Remember Tomorrow\", with its darker aura, gloomy vocals and lyrics and a menacing guitar that cycles from a lower toned phrase to a screeching melody. The process is replicated throughout the record, varying from straightforward rockers to epic tales('Phantom of the Opera, an almost 8 minute-long dramatic prowess, among the best things they ever did) and psychedelic tunes like \"Stranger World\", a very underrated gem that reminds me of good old \"Planet Caravan\" from Black Sabbath. To me, only \"Charlotte the Harlot\" is not as memorable, but it's still a nice jam that introduces a lore piece on Maiden's discography that spawns a few other songs regarding this (in)famous prostitute, who no one actually knows if is really inspired on someone real, known by one of the band members. \n\nFormation-wise, \"Iron Maiden\" is the sole record to feature guitarist Dennis Stratton, whose presence, while fundamental to some good guitar leads, will also become a little forsaken due to Adrian Smith's recruitment for the next albums. Even so, he was consistent and made good, albeit brief partnership with Dave Murray, one of the two only remaining members from this \"start\"(the band had numerous other musicians from 1975's Christmas to 1979). Mr. Steve Harris, the captain of this ship and only consistent part of the band ever since it was conceived back in the day, already makes his point on this record but is a little shy compared to the following albums. He will, though, make a very fierce statement of his presence on the very first seconds of Killers, as most people can recall. Then we have Paul Di'Anno and Clive Burr, both of which will say their goodbyes rather soon, the lead singer being the first one to do so. Di'Anno is a very good singer on the kind of music Maiden was developing at the time. His powerful shrieks and upbeat musicality make for very good moments here, specially on the more relentless rockers. He will shine brighter, though, on Killers, which I'll not further detail on this review, of course. Clive Burr is a very underrated drummer and his star shines brighter on ulterior instances, but he already delivers his powerful blows on this one, really amping up the heaviness. On some other occasions. he's also fundamental to implement groove and rhythm to the more flickering songs. \n\nOverall, this record is both a very remarkable start, one that put Maiden under the spotlight even within a already booming scene, but it also states quite clearly they were in the infancy of their sound. There are no clear flaws, to me, on the songs or the formation chemistry(maybe a little on Eddie's less captivating looks), but we all know what this band is capable of and, listening to this today, as much as it's refreshing and better than a plethora of records, one will still be craving for more. Fortunately, these wishes are to be fulfilled.\n",
        "\nCyberpunk and the like are quite a thing these days, but the two cultural pieces i more frequently relate to \"future gone wrong\" aesthetics and theme must be 1982's flick \"Blade Runner\" and this 1986's gem of a record, the latter being strongly inspired by the former. The cover artwork, another stellar job by Derek Riggs, portrays Eddie as this vicious cyborg with nothing to lose and is filled with Maiden memorabilia for all those looking intently, just the way it did on the previous album. It also sports the dismaying fashion of a city corrupted by every output of the late stage capitalism, one which sprawled more fiercely all around and ironically preyed upon humankind itself. Maiden\u2019s artistic endeavor was never only about their music. It\u2019s the spirit, the album covers, the band members' charisma. So, when you buy one of their records and it comes packed with this inventive, blazing and colorful cover art, you already know you\u2019re on for a ride, one that you\u2019ll never forget. \n\nOne thing i can't actually tell is if there's a single, indisputable best album by Maiden, for their career is overflowing with magnum opuses, each and every one comprising some instant classics, but i think SiT is, all things considered, my strongest contender to that title. It's not even simple to point out the reasons why, since there's a lot of subjectivity to that, but there must be something here that tells what it is, since there are lots of Maiden fans who advocate for the same opinion. When a band is so strong and flowing with good chemistry, you\u2019re actually anticipating an ongoing evolution. To me, that\u2019s part of what makes this album so damn good. Ever since their debut, these guys have been setting their bar higher, going to new and successful directions with their music and, also, opening doors for their next step. \"Powerslave\", for example, brings songs like the self-titled and \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\", both of which are longer, more atmospheric and lyrically strong, features that are heavily present on Somewhere in Time and will become, actually, part of what Maiden builds their legacy upon. \n\nThe band formation is the same ever since Piece of Mind. A strong bond, both personally and professionally, will make up for very good musical results, most of the time. The guitar duo is sharp and delivers some of the most beautiful leads up to this point in their career, not to forget some very outstanding riffing. Dickinson is powerful and commanding as ever, just like the boss Harris, whose compositions are still at the top of the world. McBrain is never to be underestimated, his presence behind the kit always a tour de force. But it\u2019s not only the great synergy among these band mates that really excels on the music presented, it\u2019s the freedom to come up with ideas and turn them into memorable songs. The utmost example on this record must be Adrian Smith, who single-handed penned three(!) tracks, including the fan-favorite Wasted Years, a very wholesome musical journey that somewhat diverges from the more ethereal or dream-like layouts of the other songs, but also contributes to the major concept of the album. \n\nThematically, the album is conceived around the major plot of \"time\", which is heavily hinted by the cover art and the album title. It shifts from more futuristic, speculative approaches to more mundane reflections and it even delivers some history class in the form of a biopic. To greatly enhance the center concept as a whole, the music is extensively accompanied by guitar synthesizers, which are already present on the first track, \"Caught Somewhere in a Time\", a seven-and-a-half-minute long blazing roller-coaster that is very riff-driven, but is also filled by wholehearted leads, so beautiful and well-arranged. Dickinson and McBrain both deliver some of their mightiest performances on this album, the former very passionate and the latter boosting up the speed and grip of this song. Right after that, comes the aforementioned \"Wasted Years\", introduced through one of the most well-recognized guitar phrases of all time. It is, overall, a hard rock song, very 80's all around, with a chorus that fills up your lungs to scream, emotionally, like in a crowded stadium(and the actual experience of doing so is life-changing). From this point on, the album will be rotating from a very underrated song to a very well known song. \"Sea of Madness\" is one of the most underestimated pieces of art by Maiden, also composed by Smith. It is sorta dark and mellow, but also strong and of the heaviest songs on this album, with fast-paced riffs and a melodramatic, beautiful chorus(Mr. Smith really knows how to build up emotion). \"Heaven Can Wait\" is less ingenious but also harbors a very strong chorus, while the much less known \"The Loneliness(...)\" picks up from where \"Caught(...)\" left off, with an intense pace and lots of simple but effective riffs. \"Stranger in a Strange Land\" is the only other single apart from \"Wasted Years\" and has a very strong premise, also composed by Smith. The man was on fire! \"Deja Vu\" is both simple in melody and lyrics, but i love the leads and the chorus is quite catchy! To settle things down for good, comes the song that tells the tale of Alexander, the Great. The universally known conqueror has its life summarized through more than eight and a half minutes of full-throttle \"epicness\", with the band nailing everything with even more effort than before. It's a shame they never got to play this on live concerts. \n\nIt's quite difficult to talk about this album without actually covering up all songs. They're all very unique and have a personality so strong that every track comes as an unforgettable experience. It's one these rare records where the whole journey really glue your ass to the seat and everything is finely depicted and presented, like in a opera. Maybe the successor, \"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\", is at the same quality-grade, if not even more so. But SiT has this special magic not to be mimicked by anyone, even by Maiden themselves. If you like the theme and/or the band, this a go-to mandatory source of greatness, one that you'll fondly remember for a lifetime.\n",
        "\nIt was 1981 and Iron Maiden was a large band after releasing two very good albums. However, those albums meant how the band started to open up to the world with great songs like Phantom Of The Opera or Killers, but they were still premature to the true level they might arrive at. The distracted life of vocalist Paul Di'Anno started to jeopardize their continuous ascension seriously, something that the band's founding member wasn't willing to consent to. So the consequences were damn clear: Paul Di'Anno was expelled from the band. His replacement: the most powerful, energetic and dynamic voice called Bruce Dickinson, dubbed \"Air raid siren\". However, this album may not be meant a milestone in Dickinson's history, this album may be considered as an introduction letter to the new vocalist, as well as the birth of a renewed band.\n\nMore than any 80s band, Iron Maiden can be proud that they not only gave birth to a new dimension of music, they also made it clear what kind of audiences they will receive and assimilate. Their songwriting was so straightforward and their sound was so warm and welcoming that all these instantly captivated anyone else who still wasn't familiarized with them. They also can be proud of making an accessible -not simpler- stuff like this one, as they reinvented the wheel with this spectacular record. If there's an album that could be called THE metal album, the one that sums up everything and claim to be the best released ever, it has to be. Opinions will vary according to taste, but my taste is for total ass-kicking heavy metal and this is the epitome of it. Every song here is heavy as fuck, and we get albums like these to remember that metal can be heavy without being strident in terms of guitars, bass, vocals, etc. Sometimes, this album mixes light and shade, acoustic guitar with electric shredding. Anyone who thinks melodic means \u201csoft\u201d, would get a real shock from this album as the grade of musicianship is amazing from all members, and Bruce's singing is so pure at this point.\n\nInvaders is a sudden, no-holds-barred opener, and without notice, you hear the delectable bass before the guitar's attack. Sleek and sexy, 22 Acacia Avenue features Adrian's outro solo, and along with Steve's bass, they keep the action for six minutes without wasting any potential. The album ends with Hallowed Be Thy Name, another legend that presents Bruce's superb vocals before breaking off and speeding up the song; this song features a classic Maiden trick which consists in repeating the riff over and over until a saturation point before switching to another, something that works for them luckily. The solos are incredible and feature one of the best guitar abilities you\u2019ll see ever. The track-list is well put together, but my favorite master song is Hallowed By The Name, it's so well done and puts the cork on this album properly. Undoubtedly, everything on this record fits perfectly as the performers work in both songwriting and performance in a proper way. The record might not be the same without Dickinson, his voice is the revulsive one that this band need, and thanks to him they rise to another level at the top of the heavy metal world where Eddie would put his metallic ass in his throne, so he\u2019s right there since then. The beast roars!\n\nTo review an album like this becomes a difficult task, more so if you look at the weight this album had. At this point, if not y'all, the vast majority of listeners know this album from top to bottom and they truly know that it\u2019s not \u201canother album\u201d only. Beyond all, the bases of this album are razor/sharp guitars, shredding solos, brilliant bass, pounding drums and eargasmic vocals. It is a simple format perhaps but it works perfectly, you wouldn't ask for more in 1982, are you? Writing songs like these can turn your band into a megastar and there was something more behind the success matter. While The Number of the Beast is a disc of real importance in their ascent, is not the only one: Piece of Mind, Somewhere In Time, Powerslave and Seventh Son of a Seventh Son were also the milestones. In addition, anyone can choose his favorite album, but without this one your collection is truly incomplete, and I'm not talking about a simple heavy metal collection.\n\nOften overrated, often underestimated: it can be good or bad, whether it\u2019s fair or not. Undoubtedly, a decade of ingenious work: from a primitive filthy stage (this album belongs here), passing through the mid-decade without flaws in Powerslave whose evolved sound would collide head-on with the glacial purity of Seventh Son. More or less, you can define their career like this. It was a natural and logical evolution, and on this one everything sounds more compact, ferrous and consistent. Surely without looking for it, the kinda compositional rot that characterized the NWOBHM is abandoned; and The Number of the Beast is more audible than before notably. Guitars continue to be the predominant element in the mix through a truly passionate parade of crossover melodies. So forty minutes divided into eight songs, all of them crossed from end to end by that energetic, harsh singing that characterizes the new friend well. A true British howl, like a troubadour ahead of his time. Iron Maiden needed little else to prove their pedigree.\n",
        "\nFinally, it's here! 6 years later... After one of Iron Maiden's best albums in 20 years:\u00a0 \"The Book of Souls\", which\u00a0proved to be\u00a0a fun, heavy, and very ambitious double-album. After so much time listening to it, it's easy to mark the ups (like the great opener\u00a0-one\u00a0of the best from these\u00a0lads-, the title song and the 18-minutes mammoth that ends the album) and \"downs\" (although the album hasn't a bad track at all, there are 2 or 3 tracks that do not meet the standards of the rest). But now, in 2021, we are before another kind of beast. \"Senjutsu\" is another double-album, one that totally blew my mind: from minute 1 to 81:53. I have met another very long and ambitious album, but now\u00a0it's\u00a0more epic, dark and dramatic...and much more varied and \"easy-listening\". I must admit, I have developed a kind of addiction to this album...as it has never happened to me before.\n\nBecause of my age, this is the fourth Iron Maiden album that I have waited for. And no other record produced on me what \"Senjutsu\" did. This is Iron Maiden's best album since 1988's \"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\" without a doubt. It stands among the beast's classics, for sure. Top 6. The samurai-themed epic offers the great \"modern\" Maiden we\u00a0are used\u00a0to, but there are some little (and great) surprises, like the heavy roaring thunder called \"Days of Future Past\" or the dark, moody slow-march that gives the album its title... one of the band's heaviest songs ever. One of the most important and surprising things on the album is its variety, and no other Iron Maiden album since 1988 is so \"well-rounded\" and animating.\n\nThe album kicks off with a duo of heavy metal blasts which ends up being one of the best combinations of the record:\u00a0Senjutsu\u00a0is a strange choice to open the album, the strangest and less common track, but it's a modern masterpiece which shows that this 40-years career mastodon can surprise and sound different from usual... at some times it remembers to bands like Tool and has a strong Bruce Dickinson solo vibe. A very dark and heavy anthem, with a spectacular\u00a0Nicko\u00a0McBrain\u00a0crushing his toms like War or Ritual drums... It's a great surprise, even though you would be waiting for a 'speed change' sometime. After that great tension appears what could have been the opener for this album...\u00a0Stratego\u00a0features a very classic vibe (the nearest to the 80s you will find in\u00a0Senjustu), it's another gem from the best songwriting duo since 2000 (Gers / Harris)... this is an instant live classic, the gallop is a trademark, but has never sounded heavier and more focused.\n\nThen we have what I consider the weakest 'duo' on the album: the first single (The Writing on the Wall) which I consider my less-favorite track, although it has one of the best chorus and guitar solos on\u00a0Senjusu, and the first Harris' epic,\u00a0Lost in a Lost World, which sounds a bit elongated and holds too much similarity to When the Wild Wind Blows in some parts... however it's an entertaining song that could have been part of \"The X Factor\" album and its\u00a0outro\u00a0is just beautiful. After the calm\u00a0outro\u00a0we\u00a0encounter\u00a0a beast...\u00a0Days of Future Past, a very solo-Dickinson featuring Adrian Smith track which could have been part of something like \"Accident of Birth\", its chorus is one of the best, not only on this album but in several years. I\u00a0have waited\u00a0for a Maiden\u00a0banger\u00a0like this for a really long time!\n\nComing from 3 songs out of 5 with a high Smith / Dickinson imprint we find a very\u00a0Gers-esque\u00a0gem with\u00a0The Time Machine. I consider it\u00a0to be\u00a0one of the best songs on the album, although its epic beginning is somewhat recycled from The Talisman. The track itself has two really different 'moods': a happy semi-acoustic chorus (one of the best on the album!) that reminds me of happy-power metal (not for the speed, but for the climate and feel) and a darker verse with some great guitar melodies and the well-known gallop... If you don't end up screaming, 'I am not a preacher... I am but a man' you're not an iron maiden fan. After this epic and curious story, you will find a cinematic power-ballad,\u00a0Darkest Hour, a song that will keep growing inside you for a long time. At first, I didn't like it very much, but its beautiful chorus and guitar solos ended up enchanting me. Mr. Smith's work here is top-notch with one of the best solos on\u00a0Senjutsu.\n\nAfter almost 50 minutes of music, you could be near the end of any album today... but not with Iron Maiden, they were just warming up! Now, it's time for The Grand Finale: the trio of epics of Mr. Steve Harris, the one and only soul of this band. The trio begins with\u00a0Death of the Celts\u00a0which feels like a spiritual successor to 1998's The\u00a0Clansman: it stands as a very similar song, although it never reaches the top-level of the old gem, it lacks its power and explosion. The best in this 2021 Celtic epic is the main role of Harris and his\u00a0bass\u00a0melodies throughout the entire song. After an elongated folk-oriented\u00a0outro\u00a0(we all know that cutting some of these long intros/outros\u00a0would be better for the overall result, but Mr. Harris disagrees) comes one of the most captivating intros Iron Maiden has created in a long time,\u00a0The Parchment\u00a0develops as the most-epic and ambitious composition on the album, an instant anthem for the band, one that takes you in a ride through the desert (seriously, listen to it with headphones in a dark room... that's just something else) before exploding and unleashing a classic Iron Maiden speedy, perfection. This Asian-themed masterpiece would be the best of any Iron Maiden album since 1988... but not in\u00a0Senjustu, no! Here there is even time for more\u00a0epicism,\u00a0emotionality, and magnificence... here comes\u00a0Hell On Earth. Charming melodies, attentive lyrics, outstanding vocals, and a giant chorus combine to give birth to a stadium buster, a must for upcoming tours (minute 4 to minute 6 might be one of the best moments in Iron Maiden's history). The best Harris solo composition in 33 years isn't anything new, but a mind-blowing, stunning and exciting anthem that works perfectly as an album closer, it has everything an Iron Maiden fan expects.\n\nWhy is\u00a0\"Senjustu\"\u00a0better than its predecessors? Not only because of its top quality-level, creativity, and inspiration, but because of its drama, variety, and focus. It's an 82-minutes epic journey but, it's way stronger as a complete creation than any other of the albums since their classic gems. It feels shorter than \"A Matter of Life and Death\" and \"The Final Frontier\" without actually being... and that's a very important feeling. This will age as one of Iron Maiden's best albums ever. Hopefully not their last, but it would be a huge career\u00a0final.\n\n\n\nUP THE FUCKIN\u00b4 IRONS!\n",
        "\nIron Maiden seemed destined for success, regardless of who their singer was. With the tightest rhythm section in heavy metal (and arguably of all time), the band underwent a major lineup change with the addition of Bruce Dickinson. And man, was this a brilliant decision. Bruce's voice can command a song single-handedly, with his incredible range and power, he makes anyone want to suit up for battle just by listening to a classic-era Maiden song.\n\nThe A-side of Maiden's most esteemed album runs a little bit thinner than the B-side, but it's still incredibly strong. It just didn't have the hits. \"Invaders\" has such a catchy hook with the guitar flourishes, and it's really a perfect introduction to the album, even if it's one of the weaker moments. I think of it more as a prelude of what's to come. Bruce's vocal prowess is really what drives this album, and he carries the anthemic \"The Prisoner\" as well. Much of this album has a soaring ambience to it, due in large part to Adrian Smith's leads. \"The Prisoner\" is a good example of this as well, and the triumphant, multi-phased solo here is a PERFECT complement to that infectious \"I'M A FREE MAN\" on the hook. This is probably the catchiest song on the album (though some of the B-side gives it a run for its money).\n\nIf there's one distinction between the A-side and the B-side of this album, though, it's that the A-side is more rhythm driven, while the B-side works more off of the riffs. Clive Burr's drumming is all over \"The Prisoner\" and \"22 Acacia Avenue,\" although the latter works off a haunting guitar melody too. The cymbals are just placed at such perfect times all over this thing, you can really hear all five of the band members firing on all cylinders here, and it helps in understanding why this album turned out to be such a masterpiece.\n\n\"The Number of the Beast\" was a ballsy move for one of the biggest bands in the world at the time, writing about the devil in such blatant terms. But Bruce nails the hook with so much ferocity and the riffing is so catchy that Satanic-Panic advocates probably couldn't help but leave it off the list. This song just has everything, and even though the riffing on this side is what makes it transcend (see \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\" and its precision-playing on a slew of riffs that all hit incredibly hard), Steve Harris still has prominent and effectual bass playing across the entirety of the album. In fact, his writing and playing is probably what took Iron Maiden to the next level, coupled with Bruce's singing. This is the album that the band mastered catchy songs with fast but controlled playing, and paired it with some of Adrian Smith's most memorable solos. Everything comes together for the band.\n\nThis is probably my favorite metal album of all time, and its blend of speed metal, proto-power metal, and pure heavy metal made this album a capstone for the NWOBHM movement, and arguably the pinnacle of the metal genre as a whole. It's up there with the greats, and a timeless record for sure.\n",
        "\nSomething that seems a useless exercise is when someone tries to get out of the map when it comes to an intimate cultural fact as music itself. However, when you travel to the heart of a group like Maiden, the danger is the opposite as long as you wish nothing's left you outside. I suppose there are many of us who thinks that when we talk about this band we also talk about ourselves, also about who we are and what we were, or where the hell they've gone for so many years (\u201cSo, understand, don't waste your time\u2026\u201d). Usually, it's spoken about the band's difficult years, then, there are not very loved classics like Sabbath's Born Again or Dio's Angry Machines. I have long dusted each album with a happy melancholy, so melancholic that I dare to write this dedication about Fear of the Dark, another one that has been abused by critics. The album that too many stones are thrown at. Too many.\n\nFear of the Dark was released in the 90s when heavy metal started to suck, or at least that's what pessimists say. Grunge started to take off but metal hasn't a too bad time, nor that decadent. Arguably, black, death, power, viking and doom metal were untouched, so heavy, thrash metal were hardest hit undoubtedly. Weekend Warrior, The Apparition, Chains of Misery, From Here To Eternity are rock songs you would never expect from gods Iron Maiden, where Bruce shows his roughest voices in all expressions. The opener, the title track, Afraid To Shoot Strangers, Judas Be My Guide are the ones that least deviate from the Maiden vibe and I understand why they're preferred and acclaimed often. Janick Gers may not be on Adrian Smith's level but he offers crunchy solos that any 90s rock band can wish.\n\nThese guys are still here, Senjutsu impressed me, but they are still here, although it's impossible to know for how long. Or even for what. It's always like that, but only after a certain age, you discover it's true... that everything was serious. Each new Maiden album opens so many floodgates and writes on so many pages of me that I can't help but wonder what it will be like for others, especially for young fans. How do they see the times they haven't lived? What do you think when you listen to the classic records, and then you contemplate pictures of those glorious tours when others saw men transmuted into gods? I don't know how far they perceive that the past is what it wasn't for some and what it won't be for others, again. But all this defines how we actually perceive Iron Maiden in 1982, 1992, 2003, 2021, the year you choose. Because it seems paradoxical yet. Probably these new generations can understand better the sound that defines an entire era, the last one whose artistic manifestation navigates away from these songs. Old people walk, we youngs trace their steps, each one in their own way. And those who saw Fear of the Dark released at the time would never imagine they'd see the band's goodbye to their original DNA, that\u2019ll metamorphose into their current progressive facet inevitably (or pseudo-progressive, whatever you want to call it).\n\nNotably, they improved their songwriting respecting their previous work. Sometimes people think we shouldn't fool ourselves with the improvement either, but I do affirm they've reached another compendium among the classics, and this perspective abounds in the oriented hard rock songs especially. This album sparks good vibes from the beginning. The artwork far surpasses the poor sketch presented by Derek Riggs and to make matters worse, it's the last one with the original logo until appearing in The Book of Souls again. Also, as if wasn't enough, the opening \"Be Quick Or Be Dead\" is absolutely brutal and makes you want to listen to this, so you want to keep discovering if they returned indeed; even if someone says it's not worthy of fireworks, but it's undeniably that the band want to recover forms and structures of the past. For this return, there has been an absolutely determining factor, a guarantee that proves it's another album sounding like them: Dave Murray and Bruce Dickinson. Yet downgraded, the prodigal son returns to give the hallmark they had lost, because this band is a compendium, is a set... is a puzzle that doesn't fit if a piece is missing.\n",
        "\nCall me a heretic or whatever you want, I\u2019ve always loved Virtual and I also like their 90s records. They don't have to sound like the great classics because Blaze's voice is nothing like Bruce's and that's a determining element when a band writes songs I suppose, but saying they're bad is a huge difference. It's another style, another way of making music, and what characterizes great musicians from my point of view is being able to do or compose different things from time to time.\n\nMany claim they were at the lowest point in their career when they released this album as they had to promote this on TV. Despite that, it continues to be what it is, a misunderstood album trying to find the key that would bring them back to success and path of great albums supposedly lost in that moment. After The X Factor, it wasn't really difficult to release a record a little more entertaining than that one. To begin with, they correct one of serious errors, such as the excessive length and the number of tracks as there are only 8, including the unpresentable less lucid one that heavy metal has ever seen: Como estais amigos. But they had the decency to put it at the end, at least.\n\nAnother aspect they solve is the slowness and exasperating ploddingness that The X Factor showed. Here the songs have less melancholic melodies, although with a less brilliant quality production than the 80s ones. The best songs on the album are undoubtedly The Clansman and When Two Worlds Collide, especially the first one that recovers the little 80s spirit. Taking that out, the album shows a great simplicity, and sometimes the essence and genius reside in the simple. Virtual XI reminds the No Prayer For The Dying routine, whose songs don't surprise you if you've been burning out a 1982-1988 marathon, but if you haven't listened to them for a long time, it will entertain you pleasantly.\n\nDespite not having exceeded the length of its predecessor, truly the excess of minutes ends up weighing down their real possibilities. Similarly, a less self-indulgent view would have served to rethink whether it was worth including \"Como estais amigos\" which sounds tedious compared to the rest. This is an album full of ballads, if you hate that style, this is not for you. Except for the last song I think it's a good album. Over the years, the band has not lost attitude. Even with their controversial '90s records, they still were a heavy machine live, and Blaze still yelling like a real calf as long as the riffs set the tone. Perhaps others perceived that something was missing, something that has made four 90s albums considered bland and spiritless works. It's true they've been albums that had a decent response and helped them to maintain a status, and despite everything, many vehemently affirm that no album can\u2019t surpass the 80s worst ones, whatever it is.\n\nThis record has aged so well, it was released in the same year I was born. At the time I didn't give Virtual XI a chance, but today I really like this disc, it seems a sonic delight melodically. However, I think that Bayley was never technically up to this band, and perhaps for many gives the feeling that he turns off the brightness of these songs. If was another singer, perhaps this record would be more representative for the masses, but Blaze's tones fit the upbeat, melancholic vibe of their records and especially on Virtual.\n",
        "\nIron Maiden have taken a lot of shit over the years, that's not really news to anyone. For at least a couple decades, pretty much nothing but stinker albums, at a frustratingly consistent pace.. 2016's The Book of Souls was seen by some as, if not a come back, at the very least a pre-comeback album, a kind of stepping stone on the path back to greatness. And while I personally feel that Maiden haven't released a good album since 1986, they have unarguably released a few good songs since then. I'm not sure if Stratego is one of them.\n\nThe song isn't bad. Lets start with that. Its not bad. It has some good riffs, very cool guitar harmonies, and doesn't overstay its welcome. I can't overstate that last point, because overstaying their welcome has been one of Iron Maiden's biggest song writing flaws over the years. \n\nBut as the song goes on, it starts to feel like a rehash of past Maiden material. Specifically a weird blend of Running Free and Wasted Years, along with some guitar harmonies that could very easily be pinched from the Powerslave album. It's not egregious, but it is noticeable, and it reinforces another problem of the song, that being that it feels tired. The band sound like they're running on empty. If this track was 20 or 30 more bpm faster, it could have some real power, but as it is.. it's kind of boring. Like I said earlier, it doesn't overstay it's welcome, but it is.. boring, uninteresting, and tired.\n\nBruce Dickinson's lyrics are the usual mix of fart huffing nonsense and random history facts that I've come to expect from him. I've not got much to say about them. His fanboys will think he's still got it. Everyone else will know otherwise. Blah blah blah blah blah.\n\nAll in all, Stratego doesn't exactly inspire confidence in the new album that it's supposed to be promoting. In fact, it doesn't inspire much of anything.\n",
        "\nThis disc supposes one of the essential albums to define what heavy metal really is, especially when it comes to understanding the transition from the New Wave Of British Heavy Metal. Perhaps it may not be the perfect album for some metalheads since there is a whole legion of detractors of \"Invaders\" and especially \"Gangland\", a song that Steve Harris himself assumes was not very successful in including it instead of Total Eclipse. All in all, this is an album that came at the right time, breaking out with force thanks to the fact that it was the first album with the recently incorporated Bruce Dickinson on vocals. Although the legends had already started with their first two releases years ago, this was the album that made them grow, making known itself to an ever-increasing masses and more eager to have Iron Maiden playing in their city, a business which manager Rod Smallwood knew how to take advantage of.\n\nFocusing on the remastered sound, this is the edition they released in 2018 in CD digipack format. In general, few details have been polished, with both guitars and drums being more enhanced. I love how the riffs sound cleaner and better as long as each detail can be appreciated, as well as each figure, each nuance they included in the original vinyl. Clive Burr's performance has also gained protagonism, with a crisp drum sound highlighting some details. For example, the timpani hits in the middle part with the guitar solos are much more present than the original vinyl and thus, there are many more details that manage to rediscover an ever many-listened album like this one. It was when they finally decided to walk away without shame or shyness from that sound that compared them to neighborhood bands. Regarding cover art, each Eddie character was immersed the band's world whose evolution brilliantly summed up the concept of each one.\n\nI'm left with many feelings, all positive, I think it's one of the best records in music story and it's definitely my favorite from this band. Bruce Dickinson's voice seems simply spectacular to me. Steve Harris does an excellent job with his instrument and shows why I consider him one of the best bassists ever. Guitars are indescribable, all the melodies, all the solos and absolutely everything on this instrument show off that Adrian Smith and Dave Murray were definitely stood out at their best. Clive Burr does it spectacularly, he always sets the beat perfectly with his skills and also left some of the best drum intros. Everything on this album is excellent and 39 years later it still is remembered. I always try to do a track-by-track in my analysis, but this time results a bit difficult since I love each song and I highlight absolutely all of them. In order to not break the tradition, I'm going to highlight the title track, 22 Acaccia Avenue and the one I always mentioned as my favorite ever, Hallowed Be Thy Name: it begins slowly, in crescendo and reaching the moment when the metal-throat roars in a whirlwind of notes as the melody envelops you and squeezes you, like the successful lyrics about a prisoner's thought before being hanged.\n\nIn addition, we can't limit ourselves to the musical description, this should also make us reflect on a lot of things. There are several interesting questions, for example, what their trajectory have been like if Paul had led a more \u201cnormal\u201d life so as not to get fired? I believe -in my humble opinion and not detracting him- they hadn't gone so far as I consider Bruce better adapted to the times that were to come. Also, could Iron Maiden exist as we know without The Number of the Beast? I think not, as this is like the original version of the Bible. What about Mr Harris? Everything this man writes seems destined to burst the sales charts, and despite his almost superhuman capabilities, not all of his works obtain the same reception from specialized critics. But if there is a story that has really raised their popularity to the highest level, this disc is, without a doubt. An epic listening that includes the vast majority of Eddie's adventure through the street punk/metal vein as well as the end of the NWOBHM as such. While this is a milestone in heavy metal, their next album would be the true 180\u00b0 change in their music stamp that would identify them to this day.\n",
        "\nMaybe many consider it a weak album yet it isn't a that weak effort as Virtual XI. Looks like it has a lower level respecting they used to offer. Although we find flashes of interest here and there, it still struggles in their discographic magnitude. For many, this album supposedly help them to regain their lost credibility because of the fact that Iron Maiden has entered into a creative crisis difficult to solve. This album has series of songs headed by the endlessly chanted title track, one of the most beloved ones and a recurring protagonist in most legendary moments in concerts. It's a track with many changes and twists, full of choreable melodies that delight live. Be Quick or Be Dead is a fast-paced thrashy song released as the first single. From Here To Eternity, a punkish piece (though still sounds like Iron Maiden, of course) that can be reminiscent of their first two albums style. Afraid to Shoot Strangers is one of the remarkable songs that chronics the dilemmas and thoughts about soldier's minds on the battlefield. It's a deep and very interesting song I use to listening to and it grows up as a forgotten classic.\n\nFear is the Key is more progressive and developed when it comes to instruments and songwriting levels. The lyrics are an interesting reflection about the social impact that AIDS had on sexual relations, written when the death of Freddie Mercury was known as a result of his disease. Bruce Dickinson had said: There's a phrase in Fear Is The Key that says: \"Nobody cares until someone famous dies\". And that is sadly true. As long as the virus was limited to homosexuals or drug addicts, no one gave a shit. Celebrities started to die so people started to worry about it.\n\nNo Prayer For The Dying had had a very poor response in sales as the specialized press criticized it harshly, pointing out it was -I share the same opinion- a low level with songs that seems to be fillers compared to Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son, considered as a high-level masterpiece by many. Nonetheless, this was the last album Martin Birch produced and the first not-designed cover by Derek Riggs. Times were coming to change for them, culminating in Bruce Dickinson's departure. There were years when grunge started to explode and after a somewhat lucky stuff Iron Maiden released this album that saved their reputation and kept them among the greats of rock in the world metal scene. The band plays with more rocker compositions as long as they can maintain their essence. It doesn't mean they're quiet songs, on the contrary, speed may be a little slower than in others, but melodies are really dark and Bruce's raspy voice gives it a really underground packaging.\n\nIn this one they return to their classic sound and it's less flat than their previous album. The opener and the closer work amazingly live and have everything you need in order to move your neck. Despite the hard rockish-oriented line, it's a pleasure to hear how the music blends with the grunge-like vocal lines. This record marked the end of Bruce Dickinson's stay at Iron Maiden. In March 1993, with his mind and heart far removed, Bruce Dickinson announced his departure from the group. Relations between the singer and the band's leader Steve Harris had frequent periods of tension but get worse at this point. In fact, one of the journalists invited at the album presentation party in London did note the estrangement of Dickinson with the rest as he didn't even pose with members for a photo.\n",
        "\nIt is clear that the name of Iron Maiden is respected and revered as few, so it shouldn't be enough to elevate to the category of work of art whatever they do. First, I must tell you that I'm a great fan of this band, so the dose of objectivity you won't find here. Overall, objectivity is nothing more than reading what they want to read. But I give you my word that I've listened to this album many times, too enough to give an opinion worth taking into account, trying to get away from a devotion that goes beyond what is strictly normal, and I admit that with no blush. I'm surprised by the controversy that The Final Frontier sparked at the time. I'm not surprised, I rather find it funny that they say that they are nothing short of slop by now, at least it often happens in environments closer to the forums than to real life, even sometimes getting into ridiculous disputes receiving insults from naughty bAd bOyS.\n\nThey can speak badly or well, but for those who seek controversy and pay attention to the scores only, without going deeper than a couple of listens in a tea time, I must tell you that if you don't like the album, throw it in the recycle bin. So, things are clear: I liked this album. Less imaginative records, less imaginative reviews, you'll see that in my less inspired AMOLAD review. Ok, this work closes their third decade and I think it does it in a correct way. Of course, it isn't and won't be a classic like their eighties works, but it follows a logical evolution respecting the three previous ones. Regarding the ranking and to make it easier for you, I must say it might be below Brave New World and Dance Of Death, but far superior to AMOLAD, despite the latter having catchier epics and a more cohesive dark vibe.\n\nThe Final Frontier truly recovers the spark and fire of BNW and DOD, it also hasn't the faulty structural songwriting of AMOLAD as there are shorter songs. Even somewhat repetitive songs like Isle of Avalon are still much better than Brighter Than A Thousand Suns. \"Satellite 15\u2026 The Final Frontier\" is probably the most controversial of the whole album. Yes, for many this intro is really heavy. If the album was conceptual, we'd understand it, but four minutes could be an acoustic torture for many, especially when the intro is embedded in an as devastating beginning as the song itself. It's perhaps their best opener since Sign Of The Cross. Someone said that this band always did the same, but here Smith begins with elegance-made music. Wonderful start.\n\nA Matter Of Life And Death supports many elements that continued to be used in The Final Frontier, but at the same time, here they've looked for more direct cuts, easier to the ear. AMOLAD production didn't convince me so much, but here it's neater and more compact, although without reaching the BNW one. Songs are neither plodding nor progressive, they're songs with long instrumentations yet I haven't seen much unnecessary lengthening. Then, fair work has been sought between three guitars, each one with his elegant Maiden brand delivery. Smith highlights the songwriting a lot, as their sound actually falls on that of Harris, who despite participating in many songs, the leader is still in an uninspiring transitional period as he has only signed a complete song.\n\nRespecting the previous work, this album is not that dark, nor that plodding musically speaking. It's more accessible, less convoluted, and with constant references to the classic records we have in mind. The lyrical level is still very high, although this time they have used more metaphors and abstract resources. Anyway, it's a real pleasure to discover them with the music's general concept. I've really noticed a strange trend. Iron Maiden are bigger now than they were in the 80s, but at the same time, more and more people deny them, and sometimes it even seems that you have to apologize to them for liking this band's latest stuff. Be yourselves, listen, stop being enlightened and form your opinion. It's clear that this album doesn't resemble their 80s classics, but they don't intend it either. This band has evolved towards a more complex style, more convoluted if you want, they're not so direct anymore.\n",
        "\nI found it ironic when a reviewer said the last three songs take thirty minutes to listen to and so it was tedious, being the last three tracks the most inspired part for me. I also find it very extremist to finish off with a verse at the end just to make it about the fans. Well, when I heard this the first time I would probably have written a perfectly scored review, praising and using all the adjectives to glorify it until I discovered The X Factor. That album is a true masterpiece and Blaze's voice fits the dark theme more than Bruce's.\n\nI like this album but I see it far below their previous two albums and whatever they did afterward. There are songs that despite being long they have very inspired songwriting. I don't know if the band took a long time to compose those songs and they said at the last minute \"we'll put the last three ones in order to surprise the fans\" or maybe they wrote those songs first and then they managed to compose the other songs to fill the album. I'm surprised when someone said that Maiden has been doing the same thing ever since No Prayer for the Dying and nothing has changed since then. That's false at least for the half album. Let's talk about the good points first:\n\n\"Different World\" is short and not tedious at all as it works well as the single; \"The Pilgrim\" is doing great at 5 minutes with fast hook and catchy chorus; \"For the Greater Good of God\" has 8-9 riffs and not 3-4 as a contrarian said, to have 9 riffs is really good for 9 minutes in order to accumulate the epic tension through the whole, I remind you it's a heavy metal band, if you want lot of riffs in 3 minutes go listen to Necrophagist or some technical death metal band or speed metal in any case. How difficult it's to satisfy the eardrums of those elitist geek gamers! I'm also a stinky geek gamer, but I'd rather be all that than an elitist pseudo-intellectual hipster pretending to make history on a review site; \"Out of the Shadows\" is a decent ballad reminiscent of Remember Tomorrow from their debut while \"The Legacy\" is one of the best dark tracks ever written and the acoustic section is one of the most creative on a par with The Prophecy's outro from the Seventh Son album.\n\nIf I got carried away with just how the songs actually work, I'd give 50% to this, but it's not that bad either. The most tedious points on the album are Brighter Than A Thousand Suns and The Reincarnation Of Benjamin Breeg. The first one has a well-crafted solo and is broken with a fast-paced hook in the middle part, it actually has good ideas but has two minutes to spare; while the second one has a two minutes intro and I keep wondering until today if it was really necessary, but I love Bruce's vibratos here. These Colors Don't Run and Lord of Light are just ok. The Longest Day is the complete opposite to the annoying chorus of \u201cBrighter Than A...\u201d as it has catchy and pleasant choruses, and when you listen to it you wish it never ends!\n\nThis is by far the least imaginative Iron Maiden album since the meeting, with faulty structural songwriting. To give you an idea, The Red And The Black has made me headbang more than any of these songs, that 2015 song shreds any epic on here. Rest assured, I'm not that tough with this album, it's just not a regular visitor to my player. The album highlights are vocals, guitar solos and bass lines; I think the drummer is the most comfortable member here as he never leaves his comfort zone. The record ends with three tracks where the power takes another step out of the previous monotonous long songs, offering powerful and heavy quality riffs that prove the band still does what they set out to do. A Matter of Life and Death looks like a live recorded album and the band apparently wanted their own, which could be successful if it were more imaginative like other live records like Pink Floyd's Ummagumma. Why look at other bands? Seventh Son's Moonchild was recorded live (unedited track by track) and it went very well.\n",
        "\nSeventeen records, almost half a century. Like the latest song says, let's get the time machine and go back to 2003: we found eleven songs and 68 minutes of good music. It was recorded in London and was the first face to face with David Patchett's controversial artwork, which fairly surpasses the apocalyptic Eddie of Virtual XI with a dangerous version of death, this album's essence. It was said that the true potential of the three axes Smith/Murray/Gers had not yet been unleashed in Brave New World, something in \"Dance Of Death\" has really reached maximum points.\n\nDance of Death is a successful continuation of the previous album, but with different writing and sounds, closer to the intermediate sound of Somewhere In Time and Piece of Mind. Words like \"death\" or \"dead\" appear on almost every track, so choosing the figure of Eddie with a scythe is totally on the mark. Cover's quality is quite an important downturn respecting what we were used to, if it can be compared with the ones Derek Riggs did for Powerslave, Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son, or Melvyn Grant's magnificent one for Fear Of The Dark.\n\n\u201cRainmaker\u201d has extraordinary melodies and follows the dynamics of Wildest Dreams, although it transmits more force than the opener. Bruce gives a fantastic intonation and at times it's reminiscent of \"Deja Vu\" (Somewhere In Time). \"No More Lies\" is the first of the four epics and follows the outline of Steve Harris' songwriting. The entry of Dickinson's vocals gives the song more body and he follows the guitar/bass rhythm until exploding by the beating of instruments. It's actually successful with the orchestral arrangements as the song picks up a galloping difficult to ignore. \"Gates Of Tomorrow\" has rock roots and double vocal layers are very prominent in a different tone as well as the highly catchy chorus. It's a 100% Maiden song and its verse is more repetitive, which shows they have been looking for a more direct-singalong song, as opposed to the title track.\n\n\"Paschendale\" is based on war stories. Adrian Smith places us in World War I, in the Belgian city of Passchendale (the real name is written with two \"s\"), where a soldier witnesses the massacre remembering his comrades fallen on the battlefield. For first time Adrian writes a frankly innovative epic while Nicko's hi-hat gives it an overwhelming air along with the guitar melody. There are some orchestral arrangements that give it a sensational, movie-like grandeur. This leaves a battle, danger, chaos feeling hardly achieved until then. It requires very attentive listening and it ends in a brilliant way. \"Age Of Innocence\" shows concern about the world march, the changes in a city like London in terms of alarming points of public insecurity. Lyrics emphasizes the need to choose wisely and take advantage of opportunities when you are growing. It begins in a familiar way similar to UFO's Doctor Doctor they covered, with a sweeter chorus and a sound effect in vocals that give it its own personality. There's some good work from Nicko's double bass drum with some fantastic rolls. Who said he was lazy and didn't use it? By the way, Murray's riffs are also outstanding.\n\nThere's a significant change in songwriting. Harris had a prominent weight in other works, but in Dance Of Death he takes a back seat. He writes the incredible \u201cNo More Lies\u201d but he's dedicated to supervising his colleagues' writing. Songwriting has fallen on the three guitarists, especially Janick and Adrian, who don't disappoint and show they have fresher ideas than Harris himself. McBrain makes his first contribution after 20 years since his join, while Dickinson makes an impressive contribution and makes it sound like his solo albums at times. Although he doesn't write, no one can doubt his total dedication to the band. Gossips say he may be saving things for his solo career.\n\nIt's impossible to dismiss this for the enjoyment of someone and the despair of others. Kevin Shirley's inevitable production and his analogic wall sound have convinced me over the years just as Senjutsu has done in few weeks. Dance of Death overflows power and is a delicious sound experience thanks to the rhythmic base that Harris/McBrain has been developing since 1982. I keep dropping dates as if they were temporary beacons for a simple perspective matter, but also in case the vertigo of time vanishes when I conjure it. You don't lose anything by trying.\n",
        "\nSeventh Son of a Seventh Son reaches a high stratospheric bar whose own creators couldn't reconquer anymore. 1990 was a year when Harris and co. presented a more elemental, less epic disc than the mythical Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son. This time they use a rough, rocky formula that mixes up a bare intention to back to the roots partially. Adrian Smith's departure was the most palpable reason for such minimalism, a guitarist who contributed so much, enjoying those elegant moments from his warm rock roots and not forgetting those so inspired moments of versatility and sophistication he signed in the songwriting. Fortunately it wasn't Adrian's exclusive work, but even so, the void he left was noticeable as he was a fundamental piece in the mythical quintet.\n\nIt's true that something's missing: here the mythical use of riff/melody that used to enrich the songs results in more minimalist songwriting, covered by simple riffs that captures almost the whole music, and this formula would be repeated in Fear Of The Dark. It's pleasant to say that in such riffs they continued to carry on the melodies, solos and lines that show the early Maiden face, with a capacity to convey feelings. These feelings are divided into ten pieces worthy of being defended before popular opinion. On this album Bruce maintains the powerful choruses that lift you to heaven, a power that many didn't grasp away. His voice's still a very evocative prelude to the solos that recall the hardened lifestyle of the mythical \"Wrathchild\", in a time when Eddie used to roam in dark alleys. Mild substitutes like \"Tailgunner\" or \"Holy Smoke\" know how to bring raw stuff back in moderate doses.\n\nAs always, the sound is especially good. The downside of this work is the recent breathing-down-the-neck two complex albums with technically worked tracks like Somewhere in Time and Seventh Son of a Seventh Son. Now, they're betting on thinning songs with fewer arrangements and virtuosity in order to bring back the strength of their first albums. The title track is perhaps the zenith as it degrades and electrifies in the same way Revelations get rage in order to open the solos, then it steps on the gas until emerging from a devastating riff where Janick intervenes to bring it the climax. This album\u2019s main flaw is the absence of bombastic songs that have been perpetuated in the band's catalog, like the ones Fear of the Dark has.\n\nIt was one of the few albums I bought on tape first and on CD later. I especially relate it to one of my first summer jobs when I was filling out Excel sheets for hours on end, with my Walkman and my select cassettes. I listened to it most often and, consequently, it earned a place in my teenage heart and made each and every song as internalized as their other classics to this day (many of them, probably more). So it isn't too difficult to defend this against those wicked ones who insist on ranting about as if they were giving birth painfully. Whether without Smith, without the sumptuous epic of Seventh Son, or the sublime echo, elegance of Somewhere In Time, this album (as the ones they released in the 90s) is still redeemable as they actually shook me. It's simple in its forms, but deep in its own essence.\n",
        "\nA Matter Of Life and Death is most likely the best album since the last universal Maiden classic Seventh Son of A Seventh Son. There is a reason this is the only album they have played in its entirety, and it is because this is just great song after great song. \n\nThe flow of the album is pretty smooth and there are no particularly tedious or filler songs here. Starting with \"Different world\" a short, straight-to-the-point song in the line of \"The Wicker Man\", with a powerful and effective main riff and harmony guitar work very reminiscent of classic Thin Lizzy. \"These Colours Don't Run\" has a quiet intro with the main lead guitar melody over it, and morphs into a mid-pace tempo build over the same instantly memorable melody. Lots of very interesting dynamics between the vocal melodies and the guitar parts through the whole song, and the instrumental midsection has a classic Maiden sing-along moment that is pretty moving. \"Brighter Than A Thousand Suns\" is one of the more progressive rock-influenced tracks on here. The keyboards give a certain dense atmosphere especially during the chorus, and the song features some of the heaviest riffing Maiden has produced to date. \n\nThe shorter 80's Maiden-flavoured \"The Pilgrim\" and the epic \"The Longest Day\" are more straightforward, with once again, well-done dynamics between the guitar and vocal lines. The chorus on \"The Longest Day\" is probably the most outstanding part of the track, along with the instrumental middle section which reminds me of the most epic and sublime passages of songs like \"Alexander the Great\". The ballad of the album \"Out of The Shadows\" follows the line of other Maiden ballads like \"Children of the Damned\" and the less celebrated \"Wasting Love\". Once again with powerful vocal performance during the chorus, and a certain early prog-rock vibe a-la Wishbone Ash in the instrumental section.\n\nWhile most of the songs are long, the best parts of the songs are not prolonged too much, which is a problem with many songs on all the albums since Virtual XI. Take for example the \"The Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg\" and \"The Legacy\", both long songs but structured in a way that none of the parts are repeated ad-nauseaum. It is not a riff salad nor does it feel like they don't know when to end the song or when to start a different part or tempo change. Another example of this is the song \"Lord of Light\", with a quiet, dark intro that gives way to one of the few \"galloping\" moments of the album, as well as one of the heaviest. The tempo changes are smooth and do not sound like they are trying too hard to sound \"prog\" here they show us how to make a long song without having to repeat parts over and over again nor to use way too many different parts that don't really fit into the song's flow. The only exception and perhaps the weakest part of the album is found in \"For the Greater Good of God\" which while it has pretty well made and moving melodies and dynamics, especially during the instrumental break, the verse, and chorus are repeated a little bit too much. \n\nSome have criticized the choice of a rawer, live-sounding production since \"Brave New World\", but it gives the instruments and the whole performance a deeper, fuller sound and you can still clearly hear every instrument. The classic crisp, metallic Steve Harris' bass sound coupled with the pummeling drumming makes the album sound even heavier and works perfectly with the overall darker sound of the album. The 3 guitarists' sound is massive and still has that magic and the unique sense of melody that made this band a favorite in the metal genre. \n\nHighlights: The Longest Day, Brighter Than A Thousand Suns, The Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg, Different World.\n",
        "\nI'm still in that very small group of people who hate this album. I remember when the damn album was released. I listened once and refused to listen to it again. Well, 15 years later I did the same and it didn't grow on me again. If this paradigm of their turbulent era was already marked by a random luck, this album finally broke the unity and cohesion which paint a true dark panorama itself, and not in a good way.\n\nI'm a huge Dream Theater fan; I love long songs IF they need to be long. None of these songs have to be 4 or 5 minutes long. They just don't. They have 3 or 4 riffs and then it\u2019s all repeated 7 thousand times. I just don\u2019t get it. How can such a might band have fallen so far? Steve Harris always said he loves progressive rock, showing bits of it in Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son that cooled down and warmed up the hearts of old, new disciples respectively. In 2006 Harris went even further and displayed an equaled darkness as we saw in the misunderstood The X Factor.\n\nThe first thing that comes to mind is how they actually managed to make Dance Of Death work. Sure, the songs were long and had a fair few slower sections, but the songs were catchy, and the fire was still there. On this album, the fire is gone. Despite such a drastic change in their sound, it's incredible that the same opinion fronts remained intact, divided between the ones who say \u201cmore of the same\u201d, accompanied by the pejorative \u201cwhat have you done?!\u201d. Then we saw the arrival of the gloomy release and I don't need witnesses to perceive what I write. I gladly take my opportunity to express my disagreement.\n\nAs someone pointed out, they were never going to exceed the expectations set by Powerslave, Seventh Son of a Seventh Son or Number of the Beast, but they didn\u2019t have to. All they had to do was release another album full of decent songs like they have with Dance of Death and Brave New World. Instead, we\u2019re treated to this plodding, behemoth of an album that would feel more at home as a 70\u2019s rock album, than a 00\u2019s metal album. It addressed the unreason of war and soldiers' thoughts on the battlefield, all summed up in a pompous-philosophical abyss of darkness, making it an almost conceptual album where Harris synthesized them with more dedication. His favorite one when it comes to framing dramas with his music.\n\nI can understand the complaint that they are indeed getting on in years, but come on. If they can still do a two-hour set of songs like Run to the Hills, Number of the Beast, The Trooper and Aces High, then they can surely write another album with a similar feel? They\u2019ve managed to keep the same sound for so long, surely it could\u2019ve held out for at least another album? Apparently not. Because everything on this album reeks of \u201cWe can\u2019t do it anymore\u201d. Even the production is not as high-quality as everyone claims but almost sounds like they deliberately wanted a return to 80\u2019s production, with no bottom end (even though the bass is annoying, the loudest instrument) and only the most basic of drum tones.\n\nSorry, but as a devoted Iron Maiden fan, I expect satisfaction, and I was not satisfied at all by this album.\n",
        "\nIron Maiden's 14h studio album is different from their previous efforts in that it features themes it sticks with for the majority of it's runtime, the themes are of course war, religion and life's difficulties. These themes and masterful songwriting are what make this album what it is, with it's eerie and foreboding lyrics, accompanied by greatly-woven passages and melodies, \"A Matter of Life and Death\" takes us through a dark ride of mostly 5+ minute songs that take their time to build upon their meanings, but deliver a satisfying outcome by the time they are done. \n\nThe two shorter tracks in this album are of course \"The Pilgrim\" and \"Different World\", two songs that while short, deliver some classic-tier melodies and lyricism, not to mention very catchy and good choruses, though if you want a chorus to be repeated quite a bit of times you might wanna listen to \"Brighter Than a Thousand Suns\" which is a fantastic song about the creation of the nuclear bomb with one major issue: the chorus lines repeat many times.\n\n\"Out of The Shadows\" and \"The Longest Day\" are two songs that while they have a good meaning and are overall decent songs, repeat themselves a bit too much for my taste and are what I would call the weakest tracks on the album. Not all is bad however, and as mentioned before the themes of these songs are quite good, \"The Longest Day\" being written about the now famous landing of the American troops into Normandy on June 6th, and \"Out Of The Shadows\" dealing with life overall since the moment you're born.\n\n\"For The Greater Good of God\" however is without a doubt the biggest, darkest and best song in the album, clocking in at almost ten minutes and dealing with the clear theme of how some people use religion as an excuse to harm others, all while asking many existentialist questions, the song is an absolute masterpiece, with it's many well placed solos, symphonic passages and great choruses, makes it one that is often played live more than 10 years later, which only proves the legendary status the song has gained. \n\nFollowing that, we have \"The Legacy\", \"The Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg\" and \"Lord of Light\", which are all great songs in their own respects, but the standout is of course \"The Legacy\", a song that seems to be divided in two parts, in the first one a \"narrator\" seems to be talking to a man on his deathbed who has caused the death or many others, while the second part of the song urges the listener and humanity overall to find a way to understand each other better to avoid more unnecessary death at the hands of war, all the while explaining that there are some who will always try to start more of them, because they \"Benefit from death and pain and despair\".\n\nWhile I must say Dance of Death is a good enough and solid record, no songs other than a couple are what I could call an \"Iron Maiden staple\" or just \"great songs\", Iron Maiden's 14th studio record however, is filled with them if you care to listen to it more than a couple times. Highlights: \"For The Greater Good of God\", \"The Legacy\", \"The Pilgrim\" and \"Brighter Than a Thousand Suns\".\n",
        "\nSix long years. That's how long we've been waiting for the new Iron Maiden studio album. During these years, the gentlemen have not been idle: they managed to do a tour promoting the previous album \"The Book Of Souls\", play a retrospective tour \"Legacy of the Beast\", release two concerts from these tours and ... enter the recording studio. According to reports, the album was ready for release in 2020, but all plans were thwarted by a pandemic. Not wanting to wait in uncertainty for the next years, the band finally decided to premiere their new work in autumn 2021. And thank them for that! What is \"Senjutsu\"? Certainly not what it should be according to Many hardlining fans who have yet to realize that the 1980s is long gone and are unlikely to be back. A lot has happened since the last sound of \"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\" of \"Only The Good Die Young\", and most of all: 33 years have passed. Iron Maiden A.D. 2021 is a completely different band from the one from 1988. Different, doesn't mean worse. Simply different. And I am talking not only about music, but also about the approach to composing, arranging, recording and also about inspiration. Under the banner of Iron Maiden, rebellious, angry young men no longer record, but mature, older guys who do not have to prove anything to anyone anymore. They do it because they can. Because they want to. \n\nBecause they still have something to say. Because no one will tell them how to do it, and even if someone told them, they would do it their own way. And this uncompromising attitude remains unchanged in this team from the very beginning. Steve Harris's team has never looked at trends, critics, or even some fans who over the years, following a strange, twisted logic, felt that they demanded such-and-such sounds and songs from the band. On the one hand, \"Senjutsu\" brings well-known sounds and melodic flow, on the other hand, a few surprising twists and solutions. The title track, which opens the first of the two albums, is something that Maiden has never seen before. A cylindrical, based on \"war\" drums, a deep number with a disturbing, dense atmosphere, interrupted only by a melodic, slightly lighter chorus and wonderful, aggressive solos. Subconsciously, you expect a breakthrough, a change of rhythm, a crazy gallop in a moment. But none of these things. \"Senjutsu\" glides like a roller, surprising with its rhythmic consistency. In this situation, a nice contrast is the second track, the single \"Straty\", in which the gentlemen show that they still remember how to play a dynamic, galloping number in the old style. This is, of course, first and foremost a show by Steve Harris - Nicko McBrain, but it also captivates Bruce Dickinson, who builds very interesting vocal harmonies. Together with Janick Gers' singing guitar, he builds a mystical verse that will soon turn into a hit, hard-to-throw chorus. Also great is \"The Writing On The Wall\", the first number to see the light of day, announcing the new album. In contrast to the previous two numbers, it captivates with its familiar, bluesy sound, \"light\" riff and a wonderful solo by Adrian Smith. Despite the apparent idyll, this track also has a certain dose of mysticism and anxiety, which accompany this album basically all the time. \"Lost In The Lost World\" is the first of four epic and long works by the band's leader Steve Harris. It is already a track much more confusing and complicated than its predecessors, but again, surprising, for example with a calm, balladic intro, in which Dickinson once again plays with vocals and harmonies. The next in line \"Days Of Future Past\" is a bit more traditional, Maiden rocker, maybe not very innovative, but definitely thrilling. At this point, it should be appreciated that the gentlemen do not try to be original or assume that each number must surprise with something. The awareness that a traditional metal banger is still in the price adds flavor to the whole album. A certain dose of surprise appears in \"Time Machine\", the issue of which is only seemingly \"tongue in cheek\". \n\nFor the time not sure which time, Dickinson, who clearly spent a lot of time in the studio, consistently pampers his parts, comes out with great vocals. This is something new, which was not so easy to experience on the previous Maiden albums recorded after the reunion. The second album starts with the gloomy ballad \"The Darkest Hour\" and I honestly admit that it is next to \"The Parchment\" one of the most demanding moments of the entire album. Here the atmosphere of \"Senjutsu\" definitely thickens even more, bringing to mind the darkest depths of \"The X-Factor\" or \"A Matter Of Life And Death\". Sometimes you get the impression that Blaze Bayley is about to come to a guest session behind the microphone. Even Smith's guitar, usually nonchalantly hippie, weeps miserably, only to deliver a long punch with a cylindrical riff or brazenly boost the pompous chorus. \"The Death Of The Celts\", following Harris's epic show, with loads of airy Celtic melodies and sublime fragments. The whole composition hovers the spirit of the older brother entitled \"The Clansman\", but in no case is there any quotation or self-plagiarism, as some would like. In the next, already mentioned, \"The Deparchment\", the group's operating brain returns to a heavier atmosphere, although it begins with an acoustic introduction, in a rather non-obvious formula. It seems to me that this is the most critical moment of the disc, a complicated, non-obvious track, wonderfully chaotic in its complexity, full of twists and spontaneous changes of melody and pace. It is also the only number on the album in which Harris let the three guitarists have a full blast, of which, surprisingly, the least active and expressive seems to be the one who lasts the longest in the band alongside Steve - Dave Murray. Murray will occasionally pop up with his characteristic, solo \"drill\", but it definitely gives way to technically flawless Smith and crazy, unpredictable Gers. In general, I have to admit that Gers is a silent star of this album for me, a gray eminence that, acting a bit on the sidelines, gives individual compositions a characteristic color. \n\nThe whole album closes the last of Arry's epic works, \"Hell On Earth\", which is a kind of grand finale of \"Senjutsu\", created with incredible panache. It's a track full of great melodies, beautiful guitar harmonies, solos, tempo changes and of course great vocals by Dickinson. And seriously, I am impressed with how Bruce successfully managed to get out of a difficult task after all. How aware of himself, his abilities and limitations is the 63-year-old singer. How he can turn his disadvantages into advantages, how he perfectly makes up for some shortcomings with technique, ingenuity and emotions, which he uses flawlessly. \"Hell On Earth\" is his icing on the cake, listen for example to the final release, in which he builds an incredibly melodic phrase against the background of a calm, murky background. Only great masters sing like that! As for the end of the album, it was held in a great style. The truth is, however, that Maiden have always been able to spectacularly close their releases - \"Empire Of The Clouds\", \"When The Wild Wind Blows\" or much earlier \"Rime Of The Ancient Mariner\" or \"To Tame A Land\" are just some of the many confirmations this thesis. \n\nFinally, a few words about the production, for which the band's longtime collaborator, Kevin Shirley, is again responsible. \"Caveman\", as his colleagues affectionately call him, on the one hand he did a job that was standard for his previous achievements, but he also took a step forward. He managed to capture the specific atmosphere of the album, which is ubiquitous in practically every single sound, he found and gave these pieces a common denominator, joining the puzzle together. We would like to remind you that Maiden recorded this album \"on the fly\", composing and finished things immediately recording. Shirley had to listen carefully to the musicians' ideas and skillfully add two and two. It turns out that he made no mistake in his complicated calculations. At the same time, he kept the crystal-clear quality of the sound of individual instruments, intentionally thickened McBrain's drums, added some fat to Smith's sensual riffs and Gers' melodious licks, while relieving Harris's ubiquitous bass progress, and in addition he carved a monumental, harmonic block of vocal gold with Dickinson. Importantly, Shirley remains himself in the production of Maiden's albums and does not try to force the band to redirect to the waters where they sailed in ancient times. Based on the developed scheme, it adds new elements, improves the existing ones, and as a result achieves a quality that only eminent malcontents will turn their noses to. After the first listening sessions, \"Senjutsu\" leaves the listener in a rather uncomfortable position: twisted like a meticulously prepared pretzel, with a face difficult to define and great flushing on the face. \n\nThis is an album in its own way cheeky and arrogant, created with full awareness of the approaching criticism from Orthodox fans, but also the oncoming wave of admiration from people who have left their minds open. Iron Maiden pays tribute to the stainless rock classic on their seventeenth studio album, while respecting its rich past. The musicians also definitely show that, with the visor raised, they look at the present and the future that lurks just around the corner. The current Iron Maiden is a mature and noble band, wise and experienced, while maintaining the characteristic burr and youthful insolence that characterized their music and conduct almost from the beginning. All this allows them to keep a kind of freshness and stand out from all other out-of-date and old-fashioned rock stars, silently cutting off coupons somewhere on the outskirts history. \"Senjutsu\" is another, next to many Maiden monuments, which builds the immortality of the team, which is whether it will or not, at the end of its career. Listening to these new sounds, however, I'm sure this is by no means a farewell to the fans. These six guys have too much fire to just get off the stage.\n",
        "\nI find little ups and downs in their modern stage and I'm capable of breaking a spear to defend them, and I safely say that this album brings together a dystopian atmosphere totally consonant with the artistic cover art and the lyrical, instrumental qualities that accompany it. Repeatability is masterfully handled as it's offset by the sparkle of their golden years and they truly capture the freshness never seen up at this point, and we're not talking about a four-year gap but just over a decade. After Virtual XI, who would deny this is amazing? Many consider Brave New World an album \u201cfrom another league\u201d or the \u201conly good album\u201d to date, but it's true that here these guys raid into safe terrains previously seen: it combines the Powerslave aura with the X Factor gloomy vibe, without being as technical as the first or as slow as the last. The closer probably sums up this statement, it's the song where you wonder what Bruce would sound like on The X Factor. Yet simpler, songwriting is exceptionally well constructed for the most part and it's noticeable thanks to Adrian Smith, the one we missed so much and who brings his distinct, elegant deliveries.\n\nProduction supposes the premiere of Kevin Shirley and he truly brings lot of freshness to their sound. It's not certainly similar to their 90's records at all since it doesn't have the flat sound of NPOD, the decaf one of FOTD, or the somewhat brightless one from Nigel Green's era. This beginning of modern Maiden maintained the affection of old fans, the welcoming of new ones and the repudiation of the ones who wanna rub you in your face with the \u201ccome on, they have their manual on how to record albums and blablabla\u201d speech\u2026 Call it crab if you want, this is the Iron Maiden brand and obviously any band has their parameters/rules/approach to composing albums and I already see that in bands like Motorhead, Sodom, Accept, etc. They apply the same guidelines for each new album without sounding bad, the same goes for this band. As for the songs, some may be long and give the feeling of being progressive, but this is only half true: seems the band is merely trying to extend the hook on here and didn't extend beyond the \"progressive\" concept. Arguing about whether Maiden is progressive metal or the arguments around it became tiresome and very cliche. Even \u2013when it comes to this band\u2013 gives me the impression that the \"progressive metal is not all about repeats\" speech was spread like wildfire and repeated by word of mouth as a doctrine, and I've listened to it for as long as I can remember.\n\nI'm the first person who'll tell you Iron Maiden is NOT a progressive metal band, and as long as you discuss that, I won't discuss it with you. To summarize: almost everybody knows that, and I don't write in capital letters because don't wanna show pedantry. While Steve Harris said his all-time favorites songs are Supper's Ready and Thick As A Brick, he certainly grew up surrounded by songs by The Beatles, The Who, Simon and Garfunkel, The Doors, and Jetro Thull; Harris is convinced that \"Blood Brothers\" is closest to Jetro Thull influentially speaking, and considers this track as \"progressive\". Let's see how true it is. Supper's Ready, the Genesis song that Harris loves so much lasts 23 minutes and is divided into seven parts. Harris' influence on his band is basically: a single Maiden song = a part of Supper's Ready. If you compare the whole song to a Maiden one, it's like comparing a pitbull to a poodle. Again, I'm the first person who'll tell you they aren't progressive, and there are actually at least two or three songs per album that truly touch the exosphere (not even the troposphere, not that close) of the progressive metal world: Infinite Dreams in Seventh Son, The Red and The Black in Book of Souls, to name examples.\n\nSongs that can't be considered progressive even remotely are The Wicker Man, The Mercenary, The Fallen Angel. Now put aside songs that might seem to be longer but still not a nuisance due to their solid writing: Ghost of the Navigator, Out of the Silent Planet; the first one has the typical gallop which verse is accompanied by melodic guitars and it's their true first ever in crescendo song in the modern era and it aptly conveys the lyrics that reminds Rime of the Ancient Mariner, but it's taken further metaphorically. Now, the long ones that present minuscule problems: Brave New World and Blood Brothers, both are about a minute long but they aren't \"a la No Prayer Of The Dying doubled-in-length song\" as some claim, it's okay to demerit saying it's repetitive and whatever, but comparing to NPOTD proves that you haven't really heard that album to come to that hasty conclusion. And finally, songs that barely reach the progressive exosphere: Dream of Mirrors, The Nomad, The Thin Line Between Love And Hate... curiously located in the second half; they try to prove something out of the ordinary and they truly deserve to be that long. Dream of Mirrors masterfully exhibits the dystopian new-age mystique in all its glory and has it all: captivating acoustic opening section, epic choruses, and a fast-paced hook at the end. The Nomad shines on its own with the Powerslave aura while that trumpet synthesizer could sound like The Final Countdown if they gave it more prominence, something fortunately didn't happen. The Thin Line Between Love And Hate seems like a high-school-love-song but it's the most different overture on the whole album, also best solos for my taste and with several guitars layers from the middle of it.\n\nOverall, Bruce's voice sounds like old days and he's not overshadowed or purposely buried under guitars as can be noticed on latest releases, and his vocals take on a new-age nuance at the most, never seen on any other album. Perhaps the timing is what should've been taken care of in the first half in order to avoid the barrage of criticism that continues to slide until today, but results would be the same, as this was just their gradual return. For the score I guess you think I consider this superior to The Final Frontier and The Book of Souls, but Brave New World is the most accessible, least experimental album in their modern catalog. Maiden isn't progressive and never will be, so what? It's a personal tag Harris keeps to himself and progressive connoisseurs who love this band never assume that.\n",
        "\nAfter the successful reunion of the original members and the permanence of Gers, they would once again return to the studios to record Dance of Death. It generated high expectations thanks to the praising that previous album gathered, and without a doubt these guys would be able to continue maintaining the streak with this album simplifying and compacting the songwriting more, which isn't bad, but here the choruses are less repeated than BNW as the previous managed to maintain the repeatability, dystopian atmosphere masterfully. This time they incorporate folk/speed elements not seen in many years and could be said that with more colors taking away the grayish/middle-eastern patterns that characterized the predecessor. There are fast tracks like the opener, an acoustic track like the closer, remarkably well-built epics and a production that initially received complaints about being somewhat dirty (in a bad way) but the version I review here is the remastered one, where the most notable thing is how clean bass sounds and how crisp, enhanced the guitars actually sound which consequently the solos gained more life. Some consider this musically less memorable than Brave New World for presenting shorter tracks, but that's a very wrong perspective. I consider it a little better for the way they venture here to explore fields that were never repeated on their other post-2000 albums.\n\nThe opener and Montsegur work well as speedy meats; I highlight the vocal interpretation in Wildest Dreams as a festive, carnival one while Rainmaker is melodically catchy and that's why both songs actually share in common the longing of many who finally want songs of this caliber that rarely achieve to be short but with lot of substance. Montsegur, Gates of Tomorrow and New Frontier are criminally underestimated as they're one of the few fast-paced thrashy songs they ever offered in this contemporary era. At this point I think they'll never compose something similar again, without a doubt they're strong tracks worthy of a moshpit. No More Lies, Dance of Death, Paschendale are the typical epics in the same level as their golden age ones; they all stand out yet No More Lies could be the least impressive as it progressively advances with the cymbals and keyboards accompanied by Bruce reciting in crescendo those verses very reminiscent of the Virtual XI era, the truth is it breaks after 2 minutes until reaching a frenzied, more lively soloing and when I heard it the first time I actually thought would end in an exhausting way, but what I feared didn't happen. The closer Journeyman seems a bright, cheerful kind of Opeth\u2019s Harvest to me.\n\nTalking about Dance of Death is talking about a classic that has grown over the years. The faulty cover is not that inconvenient, although I've seen so many alternative covers. There's one that I liked, it depicts Eddie with four hooded guys floating in the living room and also another with a blue color palette, more a cartoonish style. Supposedly the designer asked not to appear in the credits because it was incomplete and he was embarrassed to credit the work, but Harris liked it so much so he decided to use it anyway. Sometimes I don't understand the poor decisions this sir makes, and we have to deal with. When I started listening to them eleven years ago I said they had completely lost the north since this LP, I thought ...\u201cthe opener has a novice riff and almost a pop rhythm, heavy metal for dummies, is this Maiden? And those chorus taken from some Brazilian carnival, wtf?\"... Hence why I said carnivalesque, and finally, you got me here. Also believed the cover makes me lose the desire to hear it and the content is even worse. Anyway, the idea is inspired by The Masque of the Red Death, which was brought to the big screen in 1964, seems a great literary reference.\n\nIn terms of production it is a true advantage to have Kevin Shirley since he manages to provide a rougher sound and makes the guitar tone rub against speed metal as well as folk metal (MINIMALLY, not much, more reminiscence than anything). Shirley doesn't seem so bad to me but for those detractors, Martin Birch was also a great producer but his time was not always rosy: I always thought that his production in Fear of the Dark could be much better and Seventh Son, which still consider a masterpiece, must have had less smooth guitars for such a riff feast, yes, they can be crystalline but must also have strength. Seventh Son really sounded better on vinyl but with headphones it was something else, and Dance of Death works on any platform. This album presents evenly distributed songs and takes a more direct approach compared to Brave New World, and perhaps there's a dissonance between the lyrics and the music as could be said it's a dark album, with haunting lyrics full of stories, bloody and deep thoughts, but with festive, proto-folk melodies, epic for the most part but dark as in Paschendale. Twenty years after Piece of Mind, this once underrated and reviled classic is here to stay.\n",
        "\nThere are two types of people when it comes to a new Maiden release. Those who have decided beforehand that it is shit because it wasn\u2019t made in 1984. And those that will defend and love it invariably because Maiden is Maiden. Some will feign a sort of middle ground where they pretend to judge it on its own merits and keep an open mind to positives and negatives, but this is false, they always fall into one of the two aforementioned categories.\n\nSo, this here review is written by one stringently adhering to the second category and proud of it. Maiden, needing no introduction, wrote and recorded their seventeenth album way back in early 2019 and just decided to sit on it for two and a half years, so we had to go seven years between releases since The Book of Souls (2015). Now Senjutsu enters the ring and the mythology.\n\nAt eighty-two minutes it follows the double album formula set by The Book of Souls all those years ago, and they are eighty-two minutes that feel so very much shorter. The title track and opener might be the oddest one of the bunch; cooking slowly over eight minutes it evokes the Japanese setting as battle approaches, Nicko McBrain bringing the war drums to life while the keyboards evoke the Eastern feel. Though the solos are banging it might be a tad too long and at times even too slow.\n\nEnter Stratego, a shorter and quicker number that relies heavy on the melodic guitars and Harris\u2019 iconic gallop and lead single The Writing on the Wall which has already become quite famous for Adrian Smith\u2019s incredibly effective bluesy tone, slapping some Lynyrd Skynyrd into the Maiden sound. My point is, versatility. The naysayers claiming Maiden are repeating the same thing over and over might want to actually take a listen. The Time Machine is where Janick Gers\u2019s folksy side comes into play; playing a bit like The Talisman off The Final Frontier (2010) it\u2019s one of the livelier songs on the album, Gers pulling a massive solo.\n\nLess cluttered - the faster numbers seem more in line with the slower ones - Senjutsu ends up way more cohesive than its immediate predecessor, basking in a melancholy glow that brings emotions of A Matter of Life and Death (2006) and The X Factor (1995). The atmosphere lies heavy, church steeples and war mist thick across the production, helped along by the prevalent use of keyboards as a mood setter along the melodic riffing and iconic Harris bass gallop.\n\nMight be obvious, but the longer tracks (Harris penned, duh) end up stealing the show in a manner, the closing trilogy being much talked about already; Death of the Celts evoking a slight The Clansman feeling while The Parchment is an eastern tinged spiritual successor to Sign of the Cross. Hell on Earth closes, and I\u2019ll likely revisit that one in a few months. Focus isn\u2019t on big, bombastic choruses - although those are of course there - but rather an introspective feel, often leaning on Harris\u2019s own dark side and on the theme of war, here told in less personal storytelling than on previous records and more on the grand scale.\n\nThey say Dickinson\u2019s voice has aged like a fine wine, but fine wine wishes it would age as well as Dickinson\u2019s finely tuned tenor, having lost none of its potency or gravity over the years. The man handles the brooding epic of the title track and the higher moments of The Time Machine and Days of Future Past - with its classic Smith riffing, reminiscent of The Wicker Man - with as much gravitas as he did the now classic Brave New World (2000) epics.\n\nLikewise the guitars are masterfully executed, rolling in classic Maiden style dual riffing and moving to progressive quirks in tracks like The Time Machine and Hell on Earth, Harris\u2019s thick bass setting the stage. Maiden bring to life their latest opus in vivid strokes of darkness and shades of the human mind; grand songwriting and masterful musicianship marks Senjtsu a milestone in their near 50 year career. One for the ages.\n\nStandout tracks: Stratego, The Time Machine, The Parchment, Hell on Earth\n",
        "\nThe literal translation of the Japanese word Senjutsu is \"tactics\" and, in a broader sense, \"art of war\". It isn't a random nomenclature: at this point it can be said that there's an \u201cIron Maiden tactic\u201d and the members, apart from being musicians, are artists who fight decade after decade in order to conquer the ground on the music battlefield, always carrying forward the heavy metal flag. It is the seventeenth studio album and great news for lovers of the genre: the opus lives up to the group's career and extends their legend with a counter-fashions record.\n\nThe sextet plays by heart: everyone has \"their\" moment in the LP but, as always, the collective prevails over the individual. The director and father of this creature is Steve Harris, and apart from playing the bass like few others, on this occasion he was in charge of keyboards, the production (with Kevin Shirley, who has already worked with other musicians of the likes of Rush, Jimmy Page, Aerosmith and Joe Satriani) and the songwriting of most songs. This task was shared with singer Bruce Dickinson and guitarists Adrian Smith and Janick Gers.\n\nThe title track opens it with a succession of drumbeats and guitar distortions, while the metallic bass beat strings off and the privileged Dickinson's voice is multiplied in various layers. That cover letter automatically confirms that the \"Iron Maiden tactic\" is warming up, but is not yet at full capacity. It's \u201cStratego\u201d the one that brings out the cataract of resources at its disposal: the instrumental conversations, the epic solos and, especially the catchy refrains on galloping -sorry for the play on words- of the cavalcades of many ropes that surround the band's power. \"The Writing on the Wall\" is the complete proof of their state of being in force: it's released in 2021 that could've seen the light in the '80s, '90s, '00s and even in the '10s. Achieving your own style and a safe but never boring place, is one of their greatest merits, a medal that very few active groups can wear. And, as if wasn't enough, it has an animated video clip where the band laughs at the American decadence and also at the British one, surprisingly.\n\n\"Lost in a Lost World\" begins with a Dickinson's lament echoing over a mattress of keyboards, acoustic guitars and backing vocals that are interrupted with distortions and drums, while it ends with a slow cadence but with bass as the protagonist, this time. The last two songs on the first side are \u201cDays of Future Past\u201d and \u201cThe Time Machine\u201d, declarations of principles in the face of extreme commercialization of the nostalgia concept. \u201cDarkest Hour\u201d starts off the disc two as a ballad with beautiful sea sounds at the beginning and end. Immediately afterward begins a succession of longest songs: \u201cDeath of the Celts\u201d, where Dickinson adds unusual raspy lines in his register; the mostly instrumental \u201cThe Parchment\u201d, almost thirteen minutes long!; and \u201cHell on Earth\u201d, impossible to listen to without imagining it being performed live, after so many months which hell seems to be, indeed, on Earth.\n\nThis release expresses a continuity respecting the previous album, The Book of Souls, for the aesthetic construction of its cover art where Eddie emerges from a stripped, dark background clad in a blood-soaked samurai uniform and holding a huge sword with a carved dragon. True to the band's style, many tracks exceed six minutes and some even double them. In a music market that seems to discard everything that isn't brief, immediately consumable and forgettable in most cases, Iron Maiden continues to make its own way. Senjutsu is the demonstration that all past times were not always better for bands of the magnitude of Iron Maiden: the present can be so good and, why not, the right scenario to wait even more a future that we imagine is way closer.\n",
        "\nI'm not dissapointed, and I'm not suprised. Not dissapointed, since I knew newest Iron Maiden effort- Wait, turn back. That would imply the band actually gave a quarter of a fuck while making this album. Okay, let's go back on track. I knew newest Iron Maiden release will be a snoozefest incarnated, almost comparable to Season 3 of Stranger Things, when some plots are interesting, but it's overbloated with filler that conviently catches up to create a Frankenstein of a main plot. And I'm not suprised that Iron Maiden fanboys, who held up the band to absolutely no fucking standards, are now proclaiming this pretentious trainwreck as a masterpiece. It's been this way since 2000, so why stop now?\n\nI don't even know when to start. Good stuff? That's gonna be short, since there's barely anything good. 'Days of Future Past', despite its dumb title (yes, I know X-Men were first, I don't care, it was stupid back then, too) might be worth listening more than once. It's no 'Alchemist' from 'The Final Frontier', but it's at least a proof that there's still just this little amount of steam left in those guys. And it's not suprising that it is the shortest song on the album.\n\nEverything else though - just to quote iconic plumber Mario, \"NO!\". The production, perfomances, the SONGS - all of it is a complete dumpster fire. I don't even know what's the most egregious part - but the first that comes to mind is the drummer, Nicko \"I can only play one pedal\" McBrain. I was tolerating this guy in Maiden for long time, but enough is enough. He became lazy, he refused in his 39 years of being a Maiden member to IMPROVE his skills and since Maiden fanboys are just as much in denial to acknowledge this, this is how he plays - just one same-y galloping that has quickly overstayed its welcome. And don't pull up age-card. How Tom Hunting in his almost 60s and fightning a cancer can still play like a goddamn beast that he is? Or what about Dave Lombardo, Gene Hoglan, Mikkey Dee? Hell, I bet my ass that Charlie Watts would kick McBrain's lazy ass and told him to step up the fucking game. Trust me, if Nicko would re-learn how to play fast, the songs would be much quicker, shorter, and Bruce Dickinson's pipes wouldn't have to be strained as much as they are. Normally I don't do that, but it's astonishing how much of an improvement these songs are if you temper with YouTube's speed settings.\n\nAlso, mr Harris, do you have any plans to hire an actual producer anytime soon? While not all of albums' production or songwriting faults are up to Kevin Shirley, I can most certainly blame him for being a goddamn yes-man and having no courage to step up and say \"Guys, this stuff doesn't work, let's do it differently\". Some fans may think producer's job is to just mix instruments, but what about Bob Rock? Wasn't he the one who had the balls to say to big Metallica that whatever they were doing was shit? Yes, Black Album and basically all precedent albums were mediocre at best. Still, Bob Rock was more of an actual producer than Kevin Shirley will ever be. Why don't you just hire Andy Sneap? You've heard 'Firepower', you've heard 'Blood of the Nations'. Maybe he could breathe some fucking life into this band and told them to make shorter and more coherent songs.\n\nBut, it's not entirely Nicko's lack of skills, producer being a yes-man or even Harris' ego that made this, and all previous albums, a disaster. It's you, Maiden fans. You've held them up to no standards, you've praised their lack of effort put into anything IM made since 'The X Factor', YOU, made Iron Maiden a lenient band that plays music that might as well be played in elevator. This isn't proggressive, repeating the same fucking riffs for over 10 minutes OR MORE is just that - repetetive and boring as fuck. You want truly proggressive metal - try Opeth, try Edge of Sanity, Queensr\u00ffche, King Crimson, and stop pretending this overindulgent, pointless crap is proggressive. I won't tell you to stop listening to Iron Maiden's last albums, you will do you. But then don't act fucking suprised when you pop up this site and notice someone giving 10% to this effortless crap and even DARE to think this person is not the \"trve\" Maiden fan and just doesn't \"understand\" the genius of this music. You've held them up to this \"standard\" - this is what you get. I'm done with Iron Maiden. With anything released post 1997 they couldn't prove they deserve the attention and high marks they get. They still have old records which are brilliant, but as for their reunion albums - they can shove 'em.\n\n\nPS. Maiden, you have no right to call your boring 11-minute gallop 'Hell on Earth'. Not after Mick Gordon showed everyone how to play a demon-slaying song going by the same name. Imagine if Death Angel would play cheesy KISS-rock and title that 'Dream Calls for Blood'. That would be an embarassment.\n",
        "\nA new Iron Maiden album these days is pretty much more than an album. It\u2019s a whole experience, with the band throwing in its visual additions, themes, all kinds of stuff. And of course the lengths have only gotten more gregarious and ambitious as time has gone on. On Senjutsu, it seems the longer the song is, the more I like it.\n\nThere are some shorter tunes of course. Singles \u201cStratego,\u201d with its strident gallop and arcane lyrics, is satisfying, while \u201cThe Writing on the Wall\u201d is an apocalyptic fable done up with a Wild West musical theme. Both are enjoyable if the safest songs on the album. \u201cDays of Future Past\u201d is a classic Dickinson rocker, with a jubilant chorus hook and a great Adrian Smith guitar base \u2013 this might be their best shorter, compact song in ages, actually. Bruce just sounds so excited, and that riff is so damn good. The Kevin Shirley production is what it is \u2013 an Earthy, vibrant but kinda raw sound for a band like this. I prefer it over something too fussy and clean any day.\n\nBut much of the rest of the album is much longer and more ambitious. The opening title track is a real left turn for the band \u2013 almost like the \u201cSatellite 15\u201d opener off The Final Frontier except carried to a whole 8-minute dirge. It\u2019s got formidable, almost tribal drums imposing on the eardrums (Nicko McBrain is in top fucking form on the whole album really), some regal lead guitars snaking around, a riff that struts at a funeral pace rather than gallops. Bruce on the vocals sounds like a narrator of the apocalypse. It immediately gets your attention. Maybe it\u2019s a bit too obtuse of an opener for such a legendary band, but I am one who tends to admire this kind of audacity from big names \u2013 the band isn\u2019t fucking around. This song is an ear-catcher and it works to establish that this is more than just a legacy band paying lip service.\n\n\u201cDarkest Hour\u201d is a Dickinson ballad that sounds close to what he was doing on his later solo albums. It\u2019s got some beach-y atmospherics opening and closing, and some patriotic British lyrics about Winston Churchill and his troubles. I might not usually like that kind of shit, but Bruce is a strong, evocative writer, and I like what he was doing here. His voice is in top fucking shape. The guy has been my favorite singer for years and he delivers here. His tone and phrasing and emoting are unparalleled. This is just such a seminal fucking song.\n\nOthers like \u201cLost in a Lost World\u201d with its odd, philosophical lyricism and long-winded structure, and the bombast of \u201cThe Time Machine,\u201d come off as refinements of what Maiden has been doing for the last decade and a half \u2013 while I liked almost everything they did on the past few albums, these songs come off as more economical, and they eschew the occasional repetition that drew critiques pretty often. It just feels like the band has always been looking critically at themselves, working hard as any artists should.\n\nBut the album functions as a legit whole, and it does eventually get to its climax in the final three 10+ minute songs, all written by main-man Steve Harris. Harris has gotten flak over the years for the long-windedness of his songs, the constant quiet intros, all kinds of things. I think if the songs are good then so be it. It\u2019s very difficult to find a rock band that truly innovates after 40+ years \u2013 but honestly, this trilogy of songs is pretty goddamn great.\n\nIt\u2019s Maiden doing what they do, but at an elevated level where they just cast off the restraints. It could\u2019ve been done poorly, but I think the album holds together as a unit. \u201cDeath of the Celts\u201d is the most traditional one, with the galloping grandeur and Bruce intoning some somber war-torn lyricism. But the others distinguish themselves. \u201cThe Parchment\u201d is a long Middle-Eastern dirge that has Bruce\u2019s vocals just meshing in with the massive, hazy groove of the riff and rhythm, no distinct chorus or anything \u2013 it\u2019s not a friendly song, and instead evokes a massive, weary journey. It works because it never panders. This is Maiden at their most ponderous and evocative, and the atmosphere and feel of it are so weighty you could reach out and touch them. It\u2019s imagination on overload. I love it.\n\n\u201cHell on Earth\u201d starts and ends slow, but it has quite a great, emotional narrative kick to the writing. All of the last songs do that. I enjoy how Maiden, or really just Harris in terms of the writing, leaned so far into this storytelling, bard-like vibe. \"Hell on Earth\" has some really epic, fatalistic lyrics, and numerous sections that just bleed with catharsis and vibes. Every part of it sounds like a rightful conclusion, from the two distinct epic choruses to the lyrics, spinning an abstract tale of the ending of things and some possibility of redemption. It's a sweeping, arresting piece of music.\n\nThey might not ever write another song as wild and feral as \u201cAces High,\u201d but modern Maiden has been very good for the more tempered, long-winded, narrative structures, a band that has leaned into its age. I\u2019ve found much value in the literary lyricism, spinning its tales of apocalypse, and the music that just lets this great old band play, with these generous soundscapes letting them groove and rock out in their inimitable, patented style. It\u2019s good shit. I can get lost in it, in the wistfulness and epic nature of everything they do.\n\nIf you only liked their more direct early material, Senjutsu might not be for you. But if you\u2019re open to this more gracefully-aged beast of a band, still rife with tasty guitar harmonies and massive hooks and choruses, then this album should satisfy in abundance.\n",
        "\nAs a chilean I was totally unaware that there are people who hate the new Iron Maiden, especially in the Anglo-Saxon world. Well, I don't really give a fuck though. Fortunately, I'm in that select group of people who love the new Maiden, so a plus point for me. At the beginning of the millennium and after the announcement of Blaze's departure, many wondered who would be the one that will bring the band's voice back to life... what no one expected was that the always characteristic \"beast's voice\" would return with great force, accompanied by a guitar we all missed then, that of Sir Adrian Smith.\n\nIt represents the band's first studio album featuring three guitarists. The title \"Brave New World\" and the album cover art are inspired by Aldous Huxley's novel, which narrates a dystopian futuristic world. If I've been fell in love with this record, it's because it was their first to get it when I was in high school. When I didn't to used to get English, I always thought it was a romantic album that talked about couple love and things like that (especially the closer one). Then when I analyzed the lyrics carefully I came across much better things as it only earned a place in my bookcase and conclude that the purchase was worthy.\n\n\"Ghost of the Navigator\" is another golden classic and begins with a chorus that'll be sung later. This song is perfect from every angle as the three guitarists play \"on the wall\" and make this song more powerful. Bruce's vocals have bass and treble tones that jaw drop while Harris' bass is very marked. Steve Harris knew how to work very well with all the resources while Janick Gers knew how to make understood himself better as the third-guitar-songwriter he is. The title track \"Brave New World\" is a good cut but also less popular than their other classics. \"The Nomad\" is definitely the least popular song on this album, but it's understandable. After listening to so many hits on an album, there will always be a song that isn't as catchy as the rest, right? But being less popular doesn't detract from how beautiful it is. The guitars return again to an Egyptian inspiration as the classic Powerslave vibe.\n\n\"The Mercenary\" has the straightforward Maiden style that never fails. Bruce sings once again with his bass tone and in a very spectacular dry style. \u201cHave you ever felt\u2026 the future is the past? But you don't know how? A reflected dream of a captured time Is it really now? Is it really happening?!\u201d\u2026 Now I remember so precisely the time I analyzed this song, simply put, spectacular where it's seen. It's another perfect combination of elements that place Steve Harris on the altar of the best songwriters who ever live on this earth. \"The Fallen Angel\" is another great gem that honestly should enjoy more popularity, it feels like a mosh song where everyone jumps with no ending during those 4 minutes that this song lasts. The album closes up with \"The Thin Line Between Love and Hate\", a very rare one compared to the rest since it starts slowly without the typical intro vocal lines (the others had the Dickinson spark that gave them color). But what I have to say is that this song reminds me a lot of Bruce's solo career, but okay, you need something different to close an album, right?\n\nThis effort is a gem from head to toe, the songs are excellent and Bruce's voice is very mature. You can tell that the band put the three guitars together correctly and they knew how to take advantage of each aspect. Even if they don't use keyboards with the same power as on efforts like Seventh Son, the band still sounds very, very consistent on this record. The atmospheric solos couldn't be more exciting on here, as they fade to give way to a warmer, calmer melody that then is played by Bruce at his maximum intimacy, pronouncing each song name in order to unleash another passage of solos in charge of the newborn trio of axes, where at times a magical melody intervenes. Dickinson re-articulates his emotional vocal lines, fading away under the heavy hiss of Nicko's cymbals. To top it all off, Dickinson's climax healthily breaks the album's spell with a humorous ending phrase: \"Oh, I fucking missed it!\" and \"Get that on tape\", followed by laughter in the studio. It seems that gave them for saying it with the still open microphone, then was funny and left it. These Maiden\u2026 are still like children.\n",
        "\nThe first thing to notice on this album is the fact that it doesn't imply any substantial change or transformation respecting the evolution they were having about twenty years ago since the day when The X Factor was released. We can find songs and each one keeps the purest essence of the characteristic Iron Maiden sound: refrains, melodies and guitar riffs respectively.\n\nOn one hand, the tendency to compose more elaborate, denser songs are reinforced, with more complex instrumental transitions as well as longer duration. The last three songs are written by Steve Harris and exceed ten minutes. On other hand, they still are appropriate songs for live concerts, straightforward and impressive ones at first listening, more to the liking of anyone who loves the eighties. There is a proto-progressive synthesis that gathers up many details and many nuances that remind their greatest songs toward the evolved style since their post-Fear of the Dark efforts. I think Kevin Shirley and Steve Harris tried to cover up each song with enveloping atmospheres on here. In this case, the bass fulfills an important role as it surrounds the intro with intensity, accompanied by acoustic guitars and Brucey vocals. They are details that become soft at the beginning but then evolve into a highly inspired crescendo as the song gains solidity in terms of instrumentalism. These techniques add more strength and energy that subtly fade away in a suggestive, attractive manner.\n\nThe opener \"Senjutsu\" has many of those aforementioned elements that mark the hallmarks of this release. It begins with a percussion emulating a kinda ritual dance, which goes in crescendo until breaking and becoming a heavy metal mid-paced effort in a dense way as bass and drums stand out in the first line. \u201cStratego\u201d brings back to the 80s as a faster, catchy track that can work in live shows very well. \u201cDays Of Future Past\u201d seems even better to me as is built on a powerful, melodic guitar riff where Nicko looks demolishing while Dickinson sings high tones and gives such a strong performance which in my honest opinion this one should have been the single instead of Stratego. Beyond these two storms of pure heavy metal, \u201cThe Writing On The Wall\u201d is what most predominates, whose melodies are the true Maiden brand and guitar solos are truly exceptional.\n\n\u201cThe Time Machine\u201d is somewhat similar to Stranger In A Strange Land as Bruce rather recites alongside the acoustic guitars and evolves into an act with overloaded guitars, gaining in intensity and speed. \"Darkest Hour\" is barely considered a power-ballad but at times it could feel similar to Revelations or Wasting Love yet this one has a harder middle part, and the accompanying sea-seagulls soundtrack only finishes off an evocative ending. \"Death Of The Celts\" is a The Clansman-like in its beginning and progression as stands out epic airs and folk nuances. The amazing bass lines work well along with the best guitar solo ever that echoes Transylvania. The beautiful ending where Brucey recites the last beautiful folk verses just remember the same minstrel Bruce who sang Paschendale. \u201cLost In A Lost World\u201d begins with some bass lines that remind Hallowed Be Thy Name but it's just an illusion as it roams in dark territories musically speaking. \"The Parchment\" features well-structured ideas, great solos, and a high exotic setting. There are well-worked melodies on \u201cHell On Earth\u201d and it has about two to three minutes to spare.\n\nSenjutsu results in a strong effort without losing the freshness and original ideas. These guys haven't set any limitations themselves as they were capable of recording such a high-level release, a level that can be demanded to the trajectory of Iron Maiden. Perhaps straightforward songs are missed, like \u201cDays Of Future Past\u201d, and maybe greater capacities for synthesis when it comes to longer songs. Overall, the final result can't disappoint this time. This is one of the records that reveal new details and call us to enjoy it again every time it's listened to over and over.\n",
        "\nSince the irregular release of The Final Frontier, it has been taken for granted that Iron Maiden have entered in the last stretch of their career despite the fact that Bruce Dickinson has actively, passively repeated that the band \"won\u2019t withdraw in fucking life\". If Senjutsu were to become their last studio album, it truly represents a more than worthy farewell for an authentic institution that has been active for more than four decades, in addition to having created some of the most fundamental works.\n\nThe British sextet returns with a new job that tends to continue to create the album they wanted and not the one their fans were asking for. It is a tremendous lack of realism to claim a forty-minute record composed and executed with the same nervousness and guts from a youngster in his early twenties, from this band of 21st century. Even knowing they can wink at what they were decades ago, they truly never lost the perspective that their career is built forward and never backward. With no sentimentalisms or attempts to win over new audiences by getting on the train of latest trends, should be positively valued that they haven't given in to be something they're not and they've never wanted to be.\n\nStubborn, loquacious and conservative ones, Senjutsu tries to follow up the coordinates they've been traced since Dickinson's and Smith's return. It doesn't imply it's not an album with no certain risks, because there are. The opener \u201cSenjutsu\u201d takes McBrain out of his comfort zone and it results as one of their most forceful starts ever; the first premiere \"Writing On The Wall\", with its acoustic overtones, this mid-paced seems to be back from everything as a twilight piece with western airs that opens up new colors in an album plagued by variety. Another considered risky decision is to have yielded the final section to Steve Harris (\"Death Of The Celts\", \"The Parchment\" and \"Hell On Earth\") whose length exceeds thirty-four minutes, an idea that could've resulted in an unbalanced work but in view of results, has ended up being a great success.\n\nAlthough The Book Of Souls had a few shorter songs, the new album is much more demanding as it contains seven songs that exceed the seven-minute barrier which tries to generate a certain atmosphere and long developments as The X Factor (reviled but now vindicated). With that said, it tries to test out the patience of those who seek the immediacy of their first years. Nonetheless, Senjutsu will continue to feed the rejection that Kevin Shirley provokes in many fans. Despite having resized their sound after the chiaroscuro era by Nigel Green, his work was questioned for having taken away the band forceness: the sometimes exaggerated volume of McBrain's drum set or the abuse of reverb in some Dickinson's lines ends up sowing another doubt: How would they sound in the hands of another producer? How would it sound like if Harris weren't so obstinate? This is what contrarians use to question.\n\nRegardless, Senjutsu stands out itself: it demonstrates much more variety and ambition as it's perfectly balanced between the dark drive of The X Factor, the epicness of Powerslave and the freshness of Brave New World thanks to the unanswerable tracks that grow with each listening. The melodic, galloping and extremely catchy \u201cHell On Earth\u201d is one of the best songs written by Harris in decades: a delicious closer that, along with the oriental touch of \u201cThe Parchment\u201d, certifies that his effort by concentrating his solo material has worked. Smith/Dickinson songwriting tandem is as solvent as ever thanks to the concise \u201cDays Of Future Past\u201d and \u201cDarkest Hour\u201d, this last an exciting mid-paced song full of sobriety that remember some section of Wasting Love. Don't forget either the tremendous melodic hook of \u201cStratego\u201d \u2013impossible to get the chorus out of my head\u2013, a single that, reinforcing the consistency of the first half, manages to redeem Gers from his sins.\n\nAnother great plus for Senjutsu is the very high level of interpretation; after two decades, it is perhaps the album where the potential of three guitars is effectively most developed, allowing Dave Murray, Adrian Smith and Janick Gers \u2013a graceful trio whose effectiveness seems to be renewed with the passage of years\u2013 have enough space to develop harmonies, arrangements and solos like never before, in years. The production also highlights the superb work of rhythmic base formed by Harris and Nicko who approaching seventy years doesn't seem to diminish their effectiveness or energy either. And what about Dickinson's superb vocal performance, which scares away the health problems that accompanied him lately: apparently, there will be Air-Raid Siren for a while.\n\nExcessive, demanding, bombastic and very, very elegant. Senjutsu fulfills its most basic objective: to reactivate the war machine of these sixty-aged sirs who preferred to continue at the foot of the battle with a record that enhances their legend even more.\n",
        "\nThis isn't a concept album but the cover art and the flow of the songs give the feeling that it is. They present this effort as a risky proposition with an opener that drowns the listener with bustles of Harris' fingers and a quasi-spatial suspense atmosphere as if it was a fragment tape of Star Wars, enriched with the instrumental journey On The Run-like, their homologous version, obviously without being the super hit that the Pink Floyd song was. This album may not be essential and is the last thing you want to hear from this band, especially if you\u2019re the one who listens to them frequently, but if you don't wanna hear repeated concepts ad nauseam and look for something novelty, this album is for you.\n\nThe musicians display superb aptitude and this meets Maiden's high standards in terms of composition. The production is overall good and guitars are unusual devastating ever seen then. The first half is more straightforward and rocker, while the second half has the typical quasi-progressive structure with long songs and in crescendo acoustic intros. The quasi title track is probably their least accessible opener, even less so than Sign of the Cross. \"Satellite 15...\" begins with a proto-spatial synopsis evoking somewhere outer space where Eddie is manning a ship that'll imminently go astray while drums enter and make you enter in a trance and suspense as the sharp melodic guitars simulate a sort of signal intervention. Aside from the instrumental descriptions, this could work as an instrumental album, not to mention that Bruce Dickinson chimes correctly on every song and shoots the tone he should hit. The opener lasts almost 9 minutes and the song is actually rocker alongside the whole first half, so the inclusion of the intro with the title track was successful because it prevents the bad habit of skipping the intro just to listen to the crux. The band was intelligent in this aspect because it invites the listener to experience the semi-conceptual, cinematic sensation since they were aware that it wasn't a sort of Ides of March + Wrathchild and therefore it wasn't suitable to separate them.\n\nContrary to popular belief, that the band started to decline here, this album is still capable of running well as long as we don't come across musically predictable songs. Perhaps many don't understand. Bass lines and guitars are heavily favored by production that for the most part serve their purpose. The first 5 songs feel safe perhaps because they have a more basic rocker structure but, there are divided opinions and you will never please the most demanding listener:\n\n- Hell no, they start in an acoustic and slow way, do they want to replicate Fear of the Dark over and over? It's too hard for them to make songs like The Trooper or Aces High?\n- Hell no, they're too short/straightforward and have very basic structures, do they want to fool us and return to their past glories only to offer a poor man's Aces High as we see on The Alchemist? Maybe a pig in a poke?\n\nAnother thing to note about the first half is that it doesn't get heavy to listen to. We went through a quasi-thematic opener to a single with devastating riffs but above all, what the five tracks share in common are the convincing solos without getting wanker since they don\u2019t suffocate you in a way as if they were obviously improvising or as if they haven\u2019t written the solos well.\n\nRegarding the second half, we may find more predictable stuff with the typical \"intro-riffing-chorus-solo-climax-chorus-outro\" structure, but there are also songs that feel incomplete and not well cohesive altogether. Others are incredibly good, fighting for the podium among the all-time greatest. \"Isle of Avalon\" and \"The Talisman\" portray exactly the typical song featuring long suspenseful intros to give way to the heart or crux of it, but they're not the same darkish intros as on previous album, they're not a-la-Fear of the Dark intros, and that's worthy to be applauded. Although they present good ideas, it's tolerable once or twice in the same album as long as we assumed that the opener already offered this concept. Both songs work fine but Isle of Avalon feels repetitive and wanker; it actually breaks out at minute 2:40, and while presents great ideas and killer solos, it would be better if they cropped the intro (I repeat, it's damn good) and overdevelop the songwriting in order to be cohesive, so it would easily be the modern homolog of The Duellists. My final verdict about Isle of Abalon, they actually had to omit 5:46 to 7:00 without going through the same vague passage and end it up. The Talisman presents the same problem but it's not repetitive and the vocal lines are well accompanied by both rhythmic, melodic guitars. The last two songs are incredibly good and provide an astral, psychedelic journey, especially The Man Who Would Be King.\n\nI remember when this album came out, I remember when someone said \"it's horrible, I won't see any fan saying in 10 years: I wanna hear some Maiden, gonna play Final Frontier right now\"... Anyway, don't know if I'm the only rare guy for writing the review while listening to this. The Final Frontier always seems \"Modern Maiden meets Jugulator + Agent Steel\u2019s Order of the Illuminati\" to me. This is considered the worst album since post-reunion but in short, that is not an impediment to enjoy its semi-spatial journey since the novelty factor is what does this album special. This album is not self-plagiarism or an enhancement of something they had already done. Each listener has their parameters to measure or to qualify but mine doesn't always stick to negativity even if many believe it is an improved offer of something we've already seen. Beyond that, I used to hate this album when I was 16 as had a hard time digesting it, but now I enjoy it.\n\nThe bad: the huge difference in terms of sound/songwriting in the last three tracks, which are incredibly good and with more developed ideas than the rest songs.\nThe good: the running time of the first half which brings simpler, less heavy songs to listen to.\nThe incredibly good: The Talisman, despite its first two minutes of boring intro; The Man Who Would Be King; When The Wild Wind Blows.\n\nMy suggestion to make this album perfect:\n- Further development in \"Isle of Avalon\" and reducing its timing (could be the modern homolog of The Duellists).\n- Take away those 50 seconds of intro to \"Starblind\" in order to straight to the point as Back in the Village.\n- Cutting more the acoustic intro of \"The Talisman\".\n- More homogenized production. The last three songs have an impeccable sound, worthy of studio, but songs like Starblind sound as if it was recorded when the producer woke up on the wrong foot. All this is what Martin Birch would actually suggest if he continued to produce with them.\n",
        "\nNicko McBrain co-wrote the song \"New Frontier\", doing his first participation as a songwriter. Once again, Dance of Death returned with more costumes in their live show as Bruce Dickinson wears theatrical masks and a cape as he moves around the stage. He finally dresses as the austere reaper for each final chorus. All the magic, all the passion, all the illusion or all the disappointment that their music can generate in a broad sense can be seen reflected in the fact that this band can't leave anyone indifferent. Everyone thinks it's a foolish thing to not recognize we're facing the banners of the genre: some dinosaurs that refuse to extinct, a reference for thousands of fans. Since there and knowing this, any criticism is absurd (we all have our own) and perhaps therein lies the greatness of this band. Words are unnecessary, so\u2026 to the point.\n\nThe anecdotal thing was to find the traditional British infantry costume, worn during the First World War where Dickinson performs the death on Paschendale during the live tour. Regarding the lyrics, the title track refers to a late-medieval allegory on the universality agree about death: no matter one's position in life, the Dance of Death unites everyone. This big picture is also known as a macabre dance. Then, there are songs that are capable of starting in a very aggressive, fast way whose melodies unfold toward a more chorus style in order to invite the audience to jump up, such as \"Monts\u00e9gur\", maybe not as famous as others singles but this one has very elaborate parts that'll make you enjoy from beginning to end.\n\nTitle track \"Dance of Death\" is a classic that has grown over the years and stands out several choruses, both in the beginning, middle and final parts. The bass is spectacular and the three guitars give it a lot of body while Bruce's voice is very well crafted. Not much else to discover here, it's a perfect song that'll always be played live wherever you go. \"Gates of Tomorrow\" repeats the formula again without getting tired, the powerful guitars that drive both song and chorus are spectacular and it deserves more popularity, a pity that the album itself suffers a lot of negative perceptions just for the not very visually pleasing cover art.\n\n\"Paschendale\" is another classic, who doesn't recognize that famous intro? Has very well-placed elements at the precise moment with those keyboards that make it super fresh. \"Face in the Sand\" reminds me of Blood Brothers at times and Nicko's double pedal makes it pretty damn impressive. Even so, I get the impression that Nicko can prove much more but he has to settle up for the line the song follows. The cohesion of three guitars is another proof of how they've been able to take advantage as ever. \"Journeyman\" is an acoustic song that closes the album very well; the lyrics are beautiful and have philharmonic elements that are pleasant to listen to but in the mix, I feel Bruce's voice very low... perhaps I'm getting deaf from listening to very loud guitars, especially in this album when they feel more mature as these guys have been doing in their post-2000 plates.\n\nIn summary, a sober album that despite lasting more than an hour it's still short and entertaining. It surely lives up to the best albums, surpassing even Brave New World in terms of musical patterns and novelty, but just barely. Time will tell where Dance Of Death occupies in their successful catalog, but it will certainly be at the top. Harris' bass is still there, but with more controlled volume; Nicko has lost his temper, he's no longer as calculating and methodical as before; the guitars are spectacular, the labyrinth of solos that entangle all it leaves no doubt that the three axes are in their place and in their style as the great masters they are. \n\nI think it's the album where Bruce's voice has achieved higher levels of quality; if that was already difficult to achieve, the siren doesn't lower its timbre though. Continuing with details, the inner libretto is fantastic, you can see the band's photos in an old mansion dance room, where each musician poses thoughtfully while figures of transparent women appear here and there... very artistic. The cover art, well, Eddie would have been cooler without that string of polygon-filled weirdos characters.\n",
        "\nBecause it worked pretty well the last time, that means we should do it again, right? Hopefully this trend doesn\u2019t continue. With a couple weeks since Iron Maiden\u2019s latest release, it\u2019s pretty obvious that I\u2019m far from the only one with the popular opinion that Senjutsu is way too damn long. Though that\u2019s somewhat the elephant in the room, I do find a decent amount of this to be very worthwhile. With that said, a decent amount of it also is not worthwhile. This is what the layman calls a mixed bag, I suppose?\n\nFor the most part, the general strengths lie in the first disc. \u201cLost In A Lost World\u201d and the previously released single \u201cThe Writing On The Wall\u201d not only showcase exactly what Steve Harris and co. have been doing wonderfully for years, but they\u2019re also a step away from the tradition. Ever since the latter came out, I had hoped that the entire album would have this western-tinged feel with acoustic guitars and the dry atmosphere. Too bad, because that execution was wonderful, and was pulled off very well. The general progression and upbeat feel is wonderful. Looking at disc two, \u201cDeath Of The Celts\u201d is the standout in the epic pack of long tracks. All of the instrumentation actually serves a solid purpose and fits well with the lyrics and general wavy delivery. The phases that it runs through are all wonderful, and never does it feel forced or overcooked.\n\nUnfortunately, I can\u2019t say the rest of disc two does much of anything for me. For the most part, it\u2019s a lot of rehashed things that range from fine to just flat out boring. There are good ideas, such as the suspenseful tactic of \u201cThe Parchment,\u201d but man did that one ever dry up after the first five minutes or so. Disc one has some of this, though less prominent. The opening title track is potentially the most underwhelming track on the entire run, and opening on that was a bad sign. At least songs like \u201cThe Time Machine\u201d and \u201cStratego\u201d have the same energy that made Iron Maiden so special in their time, with galloping leads and beefy chops. They just didn\u2019t stand out as much in the realm of memorability.\n\nThere are some notable things about Senjutsu as a whole which help smooth over some of the spotty songwriting. No Iron Maiden record has had this much synth that actually takes foreground since Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son, and I really dug the tone of those themselves. Maybe I\u2019ve overlooked it before, but its presence seems higher this time around. The rhythms as they are also just help with some of the run-on solos. To the opposite end, though this was inevitable, Bruce\u2019s age shows more significantly here than any other record. Somewhat goes without saying, but this is the first time that I think his vocals actually bogged things down in some areas; even The Book Of Souls really didn\u2019t sport this issue, but I\u2019m a bit more partial to that one. Perhaps a blasphemous statement for some, but it can\u2019t be overlooked.\n\nSomething I\u2019ve always appreciated was that the band always took their time to crank out a new album instead of releasing a new one every other year. Some are still going to jive better than others, and while this was a good enough release, I can\u2019t say it\u2019s exactly strong. Obviously I think the next album should cut back a bit on the time; quality over quantity. But I also would be thrilled if Bruce and co. completely shifted things the way they did with \u201cThe Writing On The Wall\u201d and gave us an entire album like that.\n",
        "\nAfter months of silence, with rumors about a new album recorded in Paris, we were invited to the \u201cBelshazzar's Feast\u201d, an elaborate strategy to introduce to the first single. Then came an announcement with the true title album, release dates, the video-lyric single and the whole album release, but not before releasing several pills such as the song titles alongside their length, composers and cover art. These givens always arouse the most diverse, heated debates among followers and not-so fans. Once with the album in our hands, one thing is clear: if someone thought they're going to move away from the creative trail they were walking in 21st century, you're very wrong. Those extended developments, the acoustic intros, the long songs (sometimes misunderstood as progressive) that accompanied them since the distant \u201cThe X Factor\u201d, are present in detriment of straightforward songs we miss sometimes. That doesn't mean I prefer one over the other, as I understand that both prototypes of songwritings are protagonists in their history. I'd like to hear a beginning with fast-paced drums a la \u201cBe Quick or Be Dead\u201d, but I admit \u201cHell on Earth\u201d is still accurate as it has managed to stand my hair on end like Harris hadn't done for years.\n\nThese guys definitely do what they want. They write songs the kind they want and record them in the most comfortable way and of course there will be somebody who likes it more or less. However, their status as a cult band and playing to ever-growing audiences gives them the privilege of being able to bill what they want without depending on anyone, neither fashions nor opinions outside their inner circle. Creativity or the result of a brand that works, edit what you edit? Each one will find their answer. Of course, folks can't help but be thrilled by McBrain and Harris's eternal galloping, the recognizable guitars of the three friends or Dickinson's lines.\n\nSenjutsu surprises with a prevailing mid-paced oblivious to what we can expect on an Iron Maiden album. Everything is marked to the taiko beat, the Japanese drums that appear as an introduction marking the beat which everything will develop then. I like the bridge and chorus, both not exempt from epicness thanks to Bruce's performance, whose vocal melody stands underneath while the guitar is accompanying. It's an eight-minute journey that ends up with the first galloping of the well-known Stratego, a very old-school song whose classic three-chord sequences in stanzas and refrains are colored by the guitar melodies, in this case, bent. The Writing on the Wall enchants off with the western vibe thanks to the distinctly country guitars of Adrian Smith alongside the plethoric Dickinson's vocal lines who face it firmly with his characteristic timbre. The videoclip has multiple references to their history, the horsemen of the Apocalypse and the ironic English humor which they're so given to criticizing and caricaturing themselves (as well as the love they profess for their country and the institutions that represent them) are a marvel that further magnifies such a cool composition. I've been listening to it since it came out and I can say that the more I do, the more I like.\n\nLost in a Lost World has a ballad-like beginning with Bruce singing very sweet (watch out for those delicate choruses that crown off each end of the verse) that later turns into a very rockish hook, with a somewhat simplistic yet recycled riff. Days of Future Past has Adrian's stamp since the characteristic main riff where he draws ties as a complement to the fundamental chord, passing by that verse rhythm and palm muting in order to invite his mates to play it in their own way. They truly add melodic nuances that ultimately complement the so characteristic sound of the three guitarists as always. The interlude with the three chorus notes is highlighted by the synthesizer which results in curiosity just before facing the final chorus.\n\nIf the previous one had the characteristic Smith style, The Time Machine has that of a Janick Gers who proposes a recycled The Talisman intro that turns into a curious semi-acoustic chorus, to say the least. Then the song takes another course, tempo and time signature, with the characteristic gallop appearing as the absolute protagonist. Darkest Hour is yet another example of their love for history, literature and cinema; proving that they know how to bring all the drama it contains within rock and heavy metal. From the most balladic part until how they charge up emotionally (picking up speed and then losing it), the superb solo guitar work is the most outstanding in years (especially just before reaching the last chorus) and it's also remarkable the tremendous rubric when Dickinson puts himself in the shoes of Winston Churchill.\n\nArry stuff almost reaches 35 minutes and they're the zenith of Senjutsu. As always, for someone it'll be an unbearable annoyance or a blessed glory for others. It's clear that the bass player feels happy composing this type of epics and he finds the ideal scenic motifs to represent them. Death of the Celts has a folk touch melodically interpreted on the well-known resource of tonic, fifth and eighth arpeggios, with certain reminiscences of The Clansman in its development. The Parchment, as if Harris was inspired by Maurice Ravel's Bolero, caught my attention for the way the instruments enter as the bass and synthesizer get in line first. They use the guitar melodies again as the common thread, using them to color the voices and others to mark the step between each part, something understandable if we see how it results too heavy for some listeners. Finally, what I consider the best beast, Hell On Earth is overwhelming as Harris has signed one of his best solo projects in the last 25 years, highlighting his beautiful melodies while Bruce grows every time he does his appearance. Nothing new, but a good one. Very good indeed. So much so that if it was their last album (hope I'm not ominous about this) it would be a magnificent icing on their career.\n\nAnd this is ultimately Senjutsu, another debtor album that the band has been in this not-so-new millennium, with both rock and heavy metal overtones. Both speed, aggressiveness and freshness gave way to measure and good taste long ago, but it's about how to enjoy both, with the musical protagonism centered on Harris (outstanding), Smith (contributing some novel notes) and to a lesser extent Gers (very archetypal). I miss some song with the Dickinson stamp (he contributes impressive lyrics though) or Murray. But that, hopefully, we'll have in the next chapter of this story.\n\nProbably the hit they were looking for. We went through albums with ups and downs and apparently they hit their mark by achieving the music they wanted, but applying a refined formula which results in greater variety and cohesion. For me, these same mixed feelings happen to me with Deep Purple since both bands have their identity stamp and no one can replicate or imitate them. They also have in common that, despite the passing of years, still know how to entertain us with their music. Although Infinite will never surpass Burn or Machine Head, in the same way Senjutsu never get over Powerslave or Seventh Son of a Seventh Son.\n",
        "\nLet's get started with the obvious, the production is awful. Particularly on most of the first half, for a band that says the debut album isn't produced great they sure don't mind the state that this album is in here.\n\nI got a bit excited for the first track Senjutsu when I heard the keyboard, but that excitement was only a mere second before I realized it was buried in the mix. Same applies for Stratego which WOULD be rated higher if not for being the worst produced song on the album. The Writing On The Wall is where the production \"improves\", meaning it's more tolerable on the ears but still is strikingly not very good. This track also possesses a tendency that is present through most of this album, it repeats the chorus way too much and could easily be made into a shorter track. Again Shirly with no control of this band. The rest of side one apart from the side closing track isn't worth mentioning, bland but not unbearable.\n\nThe last track of side one and the first of side two are my favorite songs here, The Time Machine and my favorite track Darkest Hour. The synths on most of the first half of the albums got repetitive quick with little change, for these few tracks they greatly improve the atmosphere. Darkest Hour is possibly my favorite due to it sounding VERY similar to the Bruce solo track Tears Of The Dragon, it's too bad Bruce didn't keep it to himself for a solo record. After that prepare to nap HARD, because 3 more tracks to go over ten minutes is what you'll be getting.\n\nThe Parchment is the worst track on here and maybe my least favorite Maiden track of all time. It 100% has everything that is wrong with modern Maiden. From being the LONGEST track at 12 minutes, to having everyone perform a guitar solo that turns into white noise, and to top it all off lyrical sections that repeat over and over again. This truly hurt to sit through, and the other 2 tracks that share it's long run time don't get much better.\n\nThis is a huge disappointment. I really enjoy parts of the sound displayed on this album but the lazy excuse of production and song length kills any hope this album had. Going for a 3.5 rating despite feeling way to generous with that rating, I'd gladly relisten with a remix of this record but until then this will be yet another let down from one of my favorite band's of all time.\n\nHighlights:\nDarkest Hour\nStratego (Despite it's awful production)\nThe Time Machine\n\nLowlights:\nDeath of the Celts\nHell On Earth\nThe Parchment\n",
        "\nHeavy metal flagship Iron Maiden has been on autopilot ever since singer Bruce Dickinson and guitarist Adrian Smith rejoined the band twenty-two years ago. The gaps between albums successively increased from two years over three, four and five years to six years as we speak. Album tour cycles were followed by historic or compilative tours. The six records released since then offered a balanced mixture of atmospheric and progressive epics with shorter traditional heavy metal songs. The albums got always longer and the last two outputs have been double records.\n\nWhen purchasing Senjutsu, you should therefore already know what to expect from the ten new songs. Among the epic songs, opening title track ''Senjutsu'' oozes with cinematic atmosphere and seemingly progressive structures that the band has actually been exploring for more than two decades now. The track offers a few fresh surprises however in form of more dominant keyboard sounds and varied drum patterns that show Nicko McBrain's best album performance since A Matter of Life and Death. While the song doesn't offer huge surprises, it's certainly contemporary Iron Maiden at its best and should please fans of old and new date.\n\nThere are actually quite a few similarities between Senjutsu and A Matter of Life and Death. ''Darkest Hour'' for instance is a gloomy ballad with melodic, reduced and simple guitar tones, atmospheric, decent and warm keyboard sounds and relaxed samples of wave sounds. Bruce Dickinson manages to unfold his emotional vocals splendidly in this slow-paced tune. The track recalls the menacing undertone of ''The Longest Day'' as much as the melodious passion of ''Out of the Shadows''.\n\nThe shorter songs on this album are also the strongest ones. ''Days of Future Past'' is a concise song that fans have been craving for as it combines fast verses with a mid-paced chorus you won't forget anytime soon. This is an excellent candidate for the next single and future live shows.\n\nFirst single ''The Writing on the Wall'' comes around with an inspired music video and interesting instrumental passages in form of the slow, epic and cool folk sounds in the introduction. Despite its cinematic approach, the song features all classic heavy metal trademarks such as melodic double guitar leads, dominant bass guitar passages and tight drum play. The track never overstays its welcome and is crowned with a passionate chorus that proves once again that Bruce Dickinson is still one of the very best heavy metal singers in the world.\n\nMy personal highlight remains second single ''Stratego'' that is based upon a galloping riff but explores melodic blues rock guitar sounds, decently employed keyboard sounds enhancing the mysterious atmosphere of the track and strong vocals in a charismatic chorus that makes for the band's greatest single since ''Different World''.\n\nAs much as this record works well in the context of Iron Maiden's trademarks established since the beginning of the new millennium, it also has several flaws that need to be pointed out. Several tracks recall songs the band has recorded in the past and lack charismatic, fresh and unique approaches.\n\nThe songwriting is at times by the numbers, It has become so predictable that it is occasionally dull. This is most obvious in Steve Harris' tracks as the closing three tunes overstay their welcome and aren't distinctive enough from one another.\n\nWhile Bruce Dickinson delivers the goods on the vocals, Nicko MBrain offers his strongest performance in a decade and a half and the use of keyboards adds unusual soundscapes, the other instruments fail to leave deeper impressions. The bass guitar patterns remain unique but always sound the same as Steve Harris fails to explore new grounds. The guitar play involving three musicians isn't exploited to its full potential as the record is missing some truly passionate solos or technically impressive passages.\n\nThe production might once again be discussed controversially. I would say that it sounds more organic, epic and atmospheric than on the two immediate predecessors but other fans might call the guitar sounds and keyboards too melodic and complain about the lack of tightness in the rhythm department. In my opinion, the production is acceptable but a tighter mastering could have made a very good heavy metal record an excellent one.\n\nAt the end of the day, most people can agree that it's a great thing that British heavy metal flagship Iron Maiden is still releasing new music so late in its outstanding career. The band could simply sit on its laurels and focus on occasional touring cycles but the sextet instead came together to record eighty-two minutes of new music released in a clever way throughout the past few months. Even though Senjutsu might be considered a slightly below average release in Iron Maiden's impressive discography, the sextet's seventeenth studio album is still a very good heavy metal album that is dynamic and entertaining while occasionally lacking an adventurous spirit.\n",
        "\nFinally, it\u2019s here! It may have been six years, but it seemed like an eternity for a lifelong Maiden fan like me. When I first listened to The Book of Souls, I was impressed that sixty year old dudes can still pull up amazing songs like Red and the Black or title track, but still considered TBoS their weakest release since the reunion. Senjutsu literally blew my mind on the very first listen. I definitely won\u2019t go as far as to say that this is their best album (that spot is reserved for Brave New World), but I\u2019m pretty sure it could end being my top5, right there alongside Piece of Mind and 7th Son.\n\nNeedless to say, Senjutsu offers us everything that we, the fans, were looking for \u2013 shorter tracks, longer epics, beautiful melodies, gallop, aggressiveness, powerful lyrics\u2026 The only thing that lacks, the thing that the band seems to have (more or less) forgotten since the 80\u2019s is dual harmonies. I would\u2019ve loved if they incorporated a bit more dual guitar playing in triads in the newer albums, but hey, nobody\u2019s perfect. Still, parts of Stratego and some other songs do seem to emphasize these dual attacks in certain parts.\n\nFirst track \u2013 Senjutsu, is, in my humble opinion, a very strange choice. Not only as the opener, but also as the Iron Maiden song. It\u2019s least Maidenesque of all the songs on the album, and on the moments it sounds like something that could\u2019ve been found on a Tool release. Even though it is indeed an interesting piece of music, I found it the least likable on this record (and that\u2019s saying much!). The whole song basically sounds like an intro to Stratego \u2013 one of the best songs the band has put out in ages. Gers and Harris is personally my favorite songwriting duo, and they never fail to deliver instant classics like this. First thing I noticed in both first and second track was that synth following the vocals somewhere in the background. I\u2019ve heard a lot of complaints regarding that particular thing, but I actually find it pretty cool, it especially goes well with the whole Japanese/Eastern vibe that is present throughout the record. I already see the band performing songs like Writing on the Wall and Days of Future Passed live. They both capture amazing energy, as the Smith/Dickinson songs always do. Writing on the Wall reminds me of songs like Mother Russia or The Legacy, in terms of riffage and harmonies. Days of Future Passed is a classic rock banger, something that could easily be featured on albums such as Piece of Mind or Powerslave. The biggest surprise on the CD1 was the first Harris epic \u2013 Lost in a Lost World. Apart from the fact that it features probably the best outro we\u2019ve ever heard from Iron Maiden, the track is very dense, there\u2019s a lot of stuff going on, and the instrumental section is pure gold as well. I was pretty skeptical towards this track, as the early reviewers considered it to be among the weakest songs on the album. Time Machine is another instant classic, there are some obvious Gers influences in the track, even the intro is made with the good old formula already tested in The Talisman. Amazing guitar melodies, wonderful vocal delivery from Bruce, oriental sound, a true Iron Maiden song!\n\nMoving on to the second CD, we have a power ballad called the Darkest Hour. After giving the whole album 9 or 10 listens, it really grew on me. Lyrically it is very strong and the chorus is beautiful. Smith\u2019s solo is among the best on Senjutsu, and those licks in the last chorus are so sweet. The only thing I would change \u2013 the verses are kind of unevenly sorted in this song. There are too much verses in the first part of the song, and almost none in the second. It\u2019s a reoccurring problem in modern Smith/Dickinson collaborations, but I don\u2019t think of it as a huge problem, it is just something I\u2019d like to see less of. Now, the three Harris classics. First of all, their positions on the album are spot on. Building up from the least to the most energetic one, it really could feel like a 35 minutes long Harris masterpiece. Steve shows us once again why he is the biggest musician in the whole genre. Death of the Celts is already proclaimed to be The Clansman\u2019s younger brother, and I agree with the analysis. It uses a similar scale and follows the similar song construction. I can\u2019t go without mentioning that I think those kind of songs sound remarkably better when sang by Bruce in comparison to Blaze. The journey then takes us to the Parthian Empire. The Parchment is the longest and most epic of them all. It sounds like a clash between old and new Maiden, as if Powerslave Eddie and Grim Reaper Eddie from Dance of Death married and got a child. The Parchment, just like Powerslave, uses the same Phrygian E minor, with a borrowed major 3rd from the dominant Phrygian scale which gives it that specific middle-eastern vibe. This is one of those song that only get better towards the end, and it finally peaks with the Bruce\u2019s last word that\u2019s echoing as the band returns to the slower theme from the intro. And finally, a true gem, what is in my opinion the single greatest song on this album, possibly one of their best ever: Hell on Earth! From Nicko\u2019s and Steve\u2019s rhythm attack, to Bruce\u2019s crystal clear singing, adorable melodies, thoughtful lyrics and amazing intro, this song is everything that we were searching for. I already see the crowd going nuts as soon as the first notes of Hell on Earth kick in. What still doesn\u2019t fail to surprise me is that, even though the track is 11 minutes long, it seems like a blink of an eye. It really hypnotizes and consumes the listener, and when you wake up, the song has already faded out.\n\nOverall, this album is pretty damn strong. It\u2019s way darker than the more recent ones, so that is probably why people tend to think of it as similar to the X Factor, but apart from the obvious darkness, this album beats X Factor out of the water in pretty much every way. Not to mention the fact that DIckinson's voice sounds better than it did on TBoS. Lyric-wise it might just be their best since Brave New World, and they generally sound way more creative and inspired than they did on The Book of Souls. I\u2019m very glad that Steve is not afraid to write longer and proggier songs \u2013 Lost in a Lost World intro sounds like something that could\u2019ve been on a 70s Yes record, which is something I, as a huge prog fan, approve of. Even though, we can\u2019t ignore the elephant in the room \u2013 mix on the first 7 songs is pretty bad. I\u2019ve listened to this album on multiple devices with multiple equipment, and I always got the feeling that Bruce is pretty low in some songs, especially the title track.\nSo apart from the production that wasn\u2019t amazing (except for the last three songs, where it magically became better and clearer) and the fact that the title track could\u2019ve been a bit shorter, this is an excellent piece of art. Up the Irons!\n",
        "\nFirst things first: for the first time in 31 years I once again love the majority of songs on a new Maiden album! Also: The artwork is their best in 21 years.\n\nOnce of the reasons I rarely play 21st century Maiden is: Has anyone else ever noticed since Martin Birch was no longer Maiden's producer, Dickinson's vocals have never sounded as good again as they did during his first run of Maiden studio albums? Yes, of course there is the aging but also it is no secret Birch always pushed Dickinson to do another, possibly even better take. He pushed Dickinson to perform even better than he thought he could. \n\nLet's just ignore the Nigel Green era since those albums sound muffled and feature a different vocalist. But from 2000 onwards it has been Kevin Shirley producing the albums and for 21 years now I do not like the overall sound of Maiden's studio albums with him at the helm. The guitars are always too muddy. As if they're sloppy. I'm missing that staccato attack which for instance Powerslave did have. No honestly, if I play the new song 'Stratego' right after, let's say, 'Flash of The Blade' from the earlier mentioned Powerslave, the production is simply.... bad! Muffled, sloppy, the drums being just too loud, the vocals seem unmixed, demo-ish. Doesn't anyone else hear that? I can't be the only one, right? How come songs from 'Book Of Souls' sound so much better live? It simply means the album had a bad production.\n\nBut the main reason: They just don't write such great songs anymore as they used to. Let alone albums I can listen to as a whole. Too many songs are overlong and their albums lack a fair amount of short bursts of energy to even things out. Of course I understand even after Di'Anno & Burr were out, we could never expect another 'Purgatory' but still, even one of their overall slower albums from the old days (Somewhere in Time) at least has the very energetic 'Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner'. For the past 2 decades (or perhaps even longer) the band just hasn't been able to pull a new Aces High, Trooper or Moonchild out of the hat anymore. \n\nTheir shorter singles the past decades are bordeline rock, midpaced humpty dumpty. Come on! Yuck! 'Wildest Dreams', 'Rainmaker', 'Different World' and 'Speed Of Light'? They make 'Man On The Edge' sound like bloody thrash metal. Seriously, I just can't stand those hardrock singles they've been releasing these past 20 years. 'Speed of Light''s chorus even sounded as if Dickinson was out of breath while recording it.\n\nThis new album once again has one of these throwaway songs. It's 'Writing on the Wall', which will be removed from my playlist swiftly after I've written this review. It is bad for all reasons I've given in the previous paragraph and I've even written a separate review on the single anyway. So, sod off, song. \n\nTheir second single 'Stratego' didn't entirely convince me either when I first heard it but fair is fair, the song is a slow burner. It has started to grow on me. But I do have to try to ignore the muffled flat production. To get an idea how SLOW this album is. 'Stratego' feels like one of the fastest song but it actually is slower than 'The Evil That Men Do' (1988). 'Stratego' however is a pretty decent song, stylewise it could've fitted easily on Seventh Son or No Prayer.\n\nA standout? When at the 1:10 mark guitars and drums come in, 'The Time Machine' sounds like.... nineties Skyclad. Yes, seriously! But of course with a more melodic vocalist. Obviousy. By hearing it, I now realise how much I've missed good old Skyclad the pas 2 decades. 'Time Machine' is definately one of my faves on the album.\n\nThe closing 'epic song trilogy' is a mixed bag. 'Celts' is good, 'Parchment' is outstanding but I'm having trouble enjoying 'Hell on Earth'. The first 6 minutes are okayish (not outstanding) but then the songs gets slower, slower and slower and I tend to lose interest every single time.\nThe same issues I have with 'Hell on Earth' go for 'Lost in a Lost World '. Mediocre song with a few good ideas for a 4 minute song. But even then it would have been a mediocre filler. Unfortunately it goes on for 9 and a half minutes. It is so tedious!\n\nThe jury is still out on 'Darkest Hour'. I know some people love this 'semi-ballad'. I do find some parts enjoyable but it sounds like an improved version of Wasting Love to me. The improvement being not having such a cringeworthy chorus.\n\nAll in all, Senjutsu is by far Maiden's slowest and darkest album and I love the character it has. I even dare say it is easily my favorite maiden albums since Brave New World. Especially 'The Parchment' and 'Senjutsu' are two dark epics. Are they 'epic' or dark soundscapes? Who cares, they set the mood and drag you in. That is what music is supposed to do: Drag you in! Even my wife entered my room telling me these songs grabbed her. And she was in another room!\n\nBut the fillers (Writing on the Wall, Lost in a Lost World, Hell on Earth) make the album 30 minutes overlong. I honestly would have prefered a 50 minute album with the remaining 7 songs. Also in that case it could have been a single-vinyl release for a more decent retailprice. Because 50 euros for a new vinyl release? Not happening. Not now. Not ever. Such a shame.\n\n\nStandouts:\n- The Parchment\n- The Time Machine\n- Senjutsu\n- Stratego\n",
        "\nIron Maiden has been hiding this album from us all for two years, knowing that it was recorded in 2019 and released this last Friday, holding us since The Book Of Souls wanting new Iron Maiden music and that was six years ago, but the day finally came and in September 3rd of this current year, 2021, most of us got a very unique feeling in our ears and our hearts. To begin with, I'm going to say that The Book Of Souls was better, I was impressed about how they could put out such an amazing album as their previous record after almost four decades of being legends of heavy metal, but Senjutsu isn't bad at all, it's actually a really good album! I still stand with my statement that Bruce Dickinson sings much better right now than before. Of course, Bruce's voice has been getting raspier due to age and in some Senjutsu tracks, like Stratego, it sounds a bit buried, but the vocal skills are still clean and perfect, like in The Number Of The Beast from 1982. \n\nAs you can read, I gave this album a slightly higher rate than a seven and a half out of ten, a decent grade for a very decent album, very enjoyable and with a magical touch, let's speak about that real quick. I have enough balls to say that Senjutsu is Iron Maiden's most experimental album. Why is that? You might ask, whether if you disagree or if you can't understand why, well, I will explain. The most impactful aspect of Senjutsu for me are the inclusion of folk music elements, the clearest examples are the evident Japanese music elements in title track, same with Celtic music in the track Death Of The Celts, which is one of my favorites, and to finish, we have the first single that was the first thing we heard from Senjutsu a few months ago, and it's Writing On The Wall, you can tell the clear country rock riffs in the guitars, if we can consider country music as some kind of folkloric music from United States. Iron Maiden warned us in a video they posted on their YouTube channel, precisely Bruce Dickinson said that we were about to hear stuff that we'll react by saying \"hey! This doesn't sound like Maiden!\" And they were right, while I'm not surprised by that, I'm surprised by how they could do that effect, remembering many bands that attempted to sound different and messed it all up.\n\nAnother thing I absolutely like from Senjutsu is that for me it feels like they've included things there that remind me of other songs. There is a middle section in the title track that the drumming made me think of the middle section in If Eternity Should Fail, from The Book Of Souls, for some reason I don't completely understand why. Then we have Stratego, the classic Maiden fast song, I mentioned how Stratego's vocals sound a bit buried but the solo, in the other hand, is pretty memorable, it reminds me of some tracks from the album Brave New World, especially in solo sections. The intro riff in the song Days Of Future Past gave me absolute Powerslave vibes, resembling the intro riff from the classic song Two Minutes To Midnight.\n\nLet's briefly talk about my favorite song off Senjutsu, that one being Lost In A Lost World, and I can see from the times when I've done my research, that it's currently mentioned as the fanbase's favorite or among the favorites from the new album, I of course understand why. I love the slow and groovy drum beat there at the first part of the song, let me also tell you that Nicko McBrain performed awesomely good in Senjutsu, then comes a second section where the song becomes faster and more hyping. When I was listening to that part I absolutely knew that it was going to be my favorite. I would like also to mention how much I liked Death Of The Celts, it was so good that it never felt for me like a really long song, nah, since the first listen, the whole 10 minute track was for me simply a generator of pleasure for my ears, like I got used to it from day one, unlike many songs that are pretty long but once you've memorized them it doesn't feel too long. Again, let me say one more time how much I loved those Celtic folk metal vibes there.\n\nJumping right into my conclusion, I'll proudly say that I wasn't disappointed not even in the slightest, what I got was what I was expecting, not something superior to The Book Of Souls but something that would satisfy my expectations. The way it ends is perfect, that very feeling of tranquility that Hell On Earth, the last track, gives you when the album ends is simply amazing, it's not an abrupt ending, it's a guitar that kindly tells you that your journey through Senjutsu is coming to an end and that the album is over. Iron Maiden is still impressing me after many years, and at this point I doubt that they'll put out a weak album until the inevitable day where the band decides to imminently dissolve. It's of course not the best Iron Maiden album but I guarantee it's an album that you'll remember for a long time, of course making it one of the band's most memorable records. It's another proof that 2021 is being amazing when it comes to new metal music.\n",
        "\nPiece of Mind seems to be the black sheep of the 80's Maiden albums. I say this because the first two albums have a huge following, TNOTB was their best-selling and still is their most popular record, Powerslave is probably the most beloved by fans, and of course Somewhere in Time and Seventh Son are hailed as masterpieces. With that in mind, Piece of Mind rarely gets talked about in comparison to the other 80's records, but I personally think it is one of the best. It used to be my favourite album of all time, and it's still top 10 of all time easily, because this entire thing just fucking rips, even Quest For Fire is incredible. \n\nThe songwriting has become slightly more ambitious compared to Number of The Beast, and it will continue to progress later down the line, but most of these songs are written eloquently and performed intricately. This was Nicko Mcbrain's first performance for Iron Maiden, and he plays his heart out. Whereas the previous record had a very melancholy overtone, Piece of Mind sounds a lot happier, of course with the exception of the iconic Revelations and the mighty To Tame A Land, which is my personal favourite from the album. Every solo is on point, Adrian and Dave may be at their best here, in terms of lead playing. \n\nSo many tracks on this record are anthemic, particularly Where Eagles Dare, and two songs that everyone knows, Flight of Icarus and The Trooper. Almost every riff on this album is triumphant and strong, but there are also more dynamic and varied parts, like the call-and-response vocals during the pre-chorus of Die With Your Boots On, and the aforementioned Revelations, which is almost entirely acoustic. Bruce's vocals are great, he hits some of his absolute high points throughout Piece of Mind. \n\nThere is also an addictive, somewhat passionate sound to the record, that isn't present in the rest of the Iron Maiden discography, it sounds like the band is completely enveloped in the music, and they capture the atmosphere of the songs perfectly, which may be why I hold this album in such a high regard. To exemplify what I mean, listen to the intro of the severely underappreciated Still Life. The lead guitars have a bluesy groove that the rest of the albums don't have, it makes the music sound warm and inspired.\n\nThe songs are catchy here, the chorus of Sun and Steel shows that, and despite what people say about the last few tracks on here being filler, I would argue that there is a lot of substance to be found in these tracks, although side B definitely does not have the same effect as side A, which is comprised of entirely unforgettable arena-friendly tracks. Don't get me wrong, I still love side B and may even take it over side A depending on what day it is.\n\nThe production is heavy and in your face. I've heard some people complain that the guitar tone is dry, but I think it sounds fine, and the lead guitars especially stand out. The drums of course sound excellent, and you can clearly hear Steve Harris' bass. Piece of Mind is absolutely essential for any heavy metal fan; it's accessible, it's consistent, and impactful. The excellent songwriting and almost unmatched performance make it one of the best albums ever made.\n",
        "\nLike 'The Book Of Souls' before it, Iron Maiden's new album 'Senjutsu' is an unnecessary double album. Not to bash the albums, as 'The Book Of Souls' is my favorite post-'Brave New World' Maiden release and 'Senjutsu' is quite good, but the former would have fit on one disc had its worst song been cut. With 82 minutes of playing time, 'Senjutsu' required even less pruning and Steve Harris' solo compositions are always too long these days anyway. However, particularly the first disc of 'Senjutsu' contains some excellent material that should please everyone who stuck with the band for all these years.\n\nAt this point, Steve Harris is like a writer in need of a good editor. Nothing on 'Senjutsu' is anywhere near as awful as 'The Red And The Black' or 'When The Wild Wind Blows', but even his best solo composition here - the brooding, vaguely Middle-Eastern sounding 'The Parchment' - is far too long. This is often caused by sections that are repeated too often, but his obsession with cyclic songwriting also means that you can see the final minute of each song coming from a mile away. It's either exactly the same or very similar to the beginning without exception.\n\nHaving said that, most of Harris' songs have a dark vibe reminiscent of 'The X Factor' that suits them. Adrian Smith easily contributed the best material though. The semi-ballad 'Darkest Hour' initially felt too long, but grew on me through Bruce Dickinson's best vocal performance on the album and a fantastic guitar solo section. Opening with the title track seemed like a strange choice, as it constantly seems to work towards climaxes that don't come, but that's exactly what makes the song so engaging. That and the interesting rhythms. 'Days Of Future Past' is a short, unpretentious rocker.\n\nSmith's other composition 'The Writing On The Wall' is the most atypical Maiden track on 'Senjutsu' with its long atmospheric intro full of acoustic and clean guitars creating almost a western vibe. It isn't until Dickinson's voice enters that it starts to sound like Iron Maiden. More typically Maiden is 'Stratego'. The melodies are slightly more melancholic than on their classic work, but the gallop is there and it has a great chorus. Out of the other tracks, 'Death Of The Celts' - clearly a sequel to 'The Clansman' - is probably the best with its dramatic atmosphere, although 'The Time Machine' contains some cool guitar ideas.\n\nMaking 'Senjutsu' a two-disc album does emphasize how much better the first one is. None of the songs on the second disc is outright bad, but most of them are overlong and 'Hell On Earth' just misses the mark despite some good melodies. Scrapping some songs and sections to make it fit on one disc would have definitely made 'Senjutsu' a tighter and better listening experience, but it certainly beats out the uneven 'The Final Frontier' and the tired-sounding 'A Matter Of Life And Death'. For what it is though, 'Senjutsu' is quite good. Better than most bands this far into their career could wish to be. And it's housed in by far their greatest album cover since Derek Riggs stopped making them.\n\nRecommended tracks: 'Senjutsu', 'Stratego', 'The Writing On The Wall', 'The Parchment'\n\nOriginally written for my Kevy Metal weblog\n",
        "\nWhen it comes to evaluating great bands, we'll always find fans completely committed and others eternally disappointed. My review is nothing but a reflection of a fan opinion who fights against himself for some objectivity, so giving a tempting perfect score is costing me a win. I'm really surprised by their firmness and the fidelity to the chosen style. Dickinson's voice doesn't seem to change and the post-apocalyptic video single is interestingly well done.\n\nIt is produced by the well-known Caveman Shirley, yet Steve Harris still the one who directs and marks the band's sound. Bruce Dickinson continues to maintain a spectacular vocal level despite the physical ailments suffered in recent times, showing why he was, is, and will be one of the best vocalists ever. But none of this will work without the solidity of McBrain, Murray, Smith and Gers. Many think that after 40 years Iron Maiden can do whatever they want, but the eternal dilemma is there: the struggle between the commercial desires and the creative desires themselves. In fact, most popular albums of \u201cmodern\u201d music manage to capture the best of both worlds.\n\nSurely the band has tried to achieve this balance in this disc. Have they succeeded? The title track \"Senjutsu\" starts off with strong timpani in a very powerful, epic way where all the elements seem to fit perfectly into a long yet way too heavy song. \"Stratego\" is a shorter one with the characteristic galloping and a conventional structure that facilitates easier listening and it's choosable for the next live setlist. \"The Writing on the Wall\", the first single accompanied by an impressive music video, presents a somewhat different sound that turns the mystical, epic stuff into a kind of soundtrack of a western movie. According to some opinions, many attribute this sound to the possible influence of Richie Kotzen on Adrian. We truly find such an engaging song that served as the perfect cover letter for this work.\n\n\"Lost In A Lost World\" looks like a two-in-one mid-paced song as it kicks off with clean guitar sounds and adorned vocals that somehow gives an enigmatic look. Then these guys arrive to kick off altogether without getting tired despite lasting almost 10 minutes. \"The Time Machine\" shows off the more progressive side with those choppy rhythms, upward changes and Bruce assembling lines that get solid until reaching the most melodic chorus.\n\nOn the second CD Bruce and Adrian show something that we weren't heard in the first half, overall, good use of ambient sounds. Regarding the last three songs, the started fan can notice the feel of monotony as they have the \"intro-outro\" structure that takes a bit longer to reach the galloping rhythm. Nonetheless, the keyboard contributes a lot without detracting the songwriting and they grow as the minutes go by, where the band displays one of their great ROCK moments in capital letters. Keyboard serves as a prelude to Bruce's singing with the instrumental melody and it grows in intensity as the minutes' progress.\n\n\"The Parchment\" starts off with a slow bass intro as the guitar joins to wander alone for a long time, then the Egyptian riff comes as the bestial axis of this brutal song. Combinations of vocals and instruments at their best are interspersed throughout 12 minutes, crowning off as one of the great cuts of the album. \"Death of the Celts\" has The Clansman moments in the first 4 minutes, then the remaining 6 minutes are reminiscent of Losfer Words in that instrumental part where musicians show their creativity and skill. This song definitely blew up my mind.\n\nSenjutsu follows the vein of the last albums in a more refined way. I guess almost everyone will agree that this is surely their best work since their meeting, yet people will say that there's a sense of abuse of progressiveness that takes away any sign of classic heavy metal on this release. Unless you have lived under a rock, you should know that this band has been keeping their own musical pattern for almost three decades and they're no longer those twentysomethings guys who still write The Troopers, Aces Highes, Clairvoyants, Moonchilds, Wrathchilds and everything else you still waiting for. Yes, the review title was to bring you here.\n\nThis is a quiet and very emotional album, to do enjoy the many nuances hidden in each song. It'll be difficult to choose out an anthem, and maybe many tracks can't be part of the new setlist, but if they plan to tour playing the whole album, will be worth enjoying, even if the experience is not 100% Maiden. This is the 17th album by a band that has been defending their flag for 40 years, and where someone finds exhaustion and fatigue, these guys only see challenges and the desire to do more.\n",
        "\nThe album begins with the title track, a slow, atmospheric epic with an instantly memorable riff and even more memorable chorus and vocal lines. The tribal drumming is something we have not really heard from Nicko before. This song as an opener is a great first impression of the album and makes a very pleasant contrast with the next song, \"Stratego\", a galloping, a faster song with a strong mid 80's Maiden feeling, and the western flavored \" Writing On the Wall\" which may be the most innovative song along with the title track. \n\nThe next song is the first of the drawbacks. \"Lost in a Lost World\" starts with a nice vocal melody over a simple acoustic guitar strumming, but morphs into a weak and tedious amalgamation of stuff they have already done in the last 4 or 5 records, like \"The Wicker Man\" riff during the chorus or the first riff after the intro which is a riff from 2003's epic \"Paschendale\". It's just a very redundant song that adds nothing to the album. Fortunately, the good flow of the album comes back on track with \"Days of Future Past\", a short rocker with a powerful riff during the verse and a very well done chorus. The \"Time Machine\" is a prog rock-influenced epic that reminds me of something Yes would have done in their early days. The middle section is quite energetic, just a really enjoyable moment of the album. Say all you want to say about Janick Gers' silly stage persona, but he is a great songwriter and this song is another example of that. \n\nThe ballad of the album \"The Darkest Hour\" starts with a quite melancholic and sublime clean guitar intro under a lead guitar melody, but the most remarkable part of the song is the chorus and Adrian's lead guitar work. Of the 3 guitarists, Adrian seems to be the one whose playing has become more inventive. It took me a while for me to get into this song, but after multiple listens I think this is a great ballad.\n\nMoving on to the last 3 epics of the album, which were the songs I was waiting for the most to hear. \"Death Of the Celts\" is clearly \"The Clansman part II\", but it still is not a blatant copy of that song. The issue that I found in this and the next of the songs, the darker sounding \"The Parchment\" and the galloping, uplifting \"Hell on Earth\" is the unnecessary repetition and prolonging of some parts of the songs. Other than that they have everything you would expect from a good Arry's epic: triumphant melodies, solid rhythmic attack, and Bruce's performance in these last tracks must be the best of the whole album. Steve Harris seems to be back to perform a bit more elaborate bass lines and his keyboard work really gives the album a unique atmosphere and makes the epicness stands out more. \n\nOverall this is a more consistent, creative, and engaging album than The Book of Souls and it certainly flows more smoothly and does not feel like an exhausting listening despite it being over an hour long. It would have been better if they had trimmed some songs a bit, but the musicianship, songwriting skills, and overall magic of this band still made this a very enjoyable and memorable album for the most part. \n\nHighlights: Hell on Earth, Senjutsu, The Parchment, The Time Machine.\n",
        "\nIt seems like it was forever ago that Iron Maiden released their 16th studio album, The Book Of Souls, and to some extent you can argue that it was. 6 years have passed since we last heard new material from arguably the world\u2019s most notable heavy metal act, and it would be fair to say that the world has gone through a lot of changes since. Going through the traces of a pandemic that never seems to end, political worries around the world and regular climat issues\u2026 It\u2019s definitely a different world (pun intended) that Iron Maiden operated in when they decided it was time to release their 17th studio album, Senjutsu.\n\nThe arrival of Senjutsu can be described as a bit of fresh air in a world desperate for something to grab. With all the uncertainties in the world, it\u2019s stimulating and relieving to see that the Irons haven\u2019t been musically affected but instead continues as if nothing has ever happened. Senjutsu can be described as a continutation of the musical journey that the band started with the return of Bruce Dickinson and Adrian Smith in 1999 as all the trademarks of modern Iron Maiden are in place: Extended song lenghts, progressive tendencies and unconventional song structures. This is a recipe that has divided Iron Maiden\u2019s fanbase for over 20 years and judging by the content of the album and the already existing reviews, Senjutsu is unlikely to change that. \n\nDoes this continuation mean that Senjutsu is an uninnovative, safe and predictable album? Yes and no. As I have already said, the trademarks of modern Iron Maiden can easily be found. One of the album\u2019s singles, \u201dStratego\u201d, has a distinct, classic Iron Maiden sound, complete with a steady galloping riff, memorable vocal lines and a chorus to die for. Being 1 of only 2 songs that clocks in below the 5 minute mark, the song definitely stands out as one of the highlights of the album and one of the best short Iron Maiden songs in the last 20 years. Elsewhere, \u201dThe Time Machine\u201d can be described as a vintage modern Iron Maiden song with it\u2019s acustic intro, memorable vocal lines and awesome, \u201dcrowd-jumping\u201d middle section. The fact that something so familiar can sound so fresh and inspiring is a perfect example of how well Iron Maiden has aged musically.\n\nDespite all these familiarities, there is still room for some exploration into new musical realms on the album. The lead single of the album,\u201dThe Writing On The Wall\u201d, has a somewhat folky vibe, and while not completely sold on it at first, it has grown on me and become a solid, enjoyable track. Another odd ball is \u201dDarkest Hour\u201d, which can be described as a semi-ballad similiar to \u201dWasting Love\u201d from Fear Of The Dark. While not paying that much attention to it at first, I have started to appreciate it and to understand it\u2019s purpose. Containing perhaps the best lyrics on the album and a strong chorus, \u201dDarkest Hour\u201d feels like a more mature, serious version of \u201dWasting Love\u201d, and it\u2019s nice to see that Iron Maiden still can write some mellow, softer tracks once in a while. \n\nHowever, the experimentation and willingness to try new things doesn\u2019t become clearer than on the album\u2019s title track and opening track, \u201dSenjutsu\u201d. I have to give this song a separate section because all I can say is\u2026 WOW! Buildning on the japenese themes surrounding the album cover and the album\u2019s overall concept, this song sees Iron Maiden taking more of a doomy, militaristic approach. It\u2019s dark, it\u2019s sinister and most of all: It\u2019s heavy as hell! As soon as the first riff enters the loudspeakers, you can tell that there is some serious stuff going on. All the mockery is gone as Steve Harris, Bruce Dickinson, Adrian Smith, Dave Murray, Janick Gers and Nicko McBrain are back to once again make a musical stand. The galloping drumming of Nicko McBrain has been thrown out in this song and replaced by a drum pattern that gives the impression of marching into battle and defending your territory. \u200bThe lyrics are thereafter and nothing describes the atmsophere of the song better than this part. \n\nBeat the warning the sound of the drums\nSet the beacons afire for them all\nCall to arms all the men far and wide\nHave to fight now for dynasty pride at stake\n\nThe invaders repel from the north\nKeep out nomads who come from the plains\nNorthern grasslands awash with them all\nBlocking the tribes that invade from the south of us\n\nSenjutsu may not be the most immediate and upliftning album opener of all time and has already created division among the Iron Maiden fans, but if you read the lyrics and places the song in the context of the album, you can easily understand why it's the first one. It sets the tone perfectly and makes the listener uncertain of what to expect. I have given this song infinite praise and I will continue to do so. This is not only one of the band\u2019s best songs in the last 20 years, but also one of their best songs overall and their best album opener since \u201dThe Wicker Man\u201d. It\u2019s absolutely phenomenal!\n\nA separate section also has to be made for the album's last 3 songs. What makes Senjutsu stand out is the amount of tracks bassist and band leader Steve Harris has written on his own. After only writing 1 song per album by himself on the last 5 Iron Maiden albums, he wrote 4 on Senjutsu, thus cementing himself as the band's creative force. 3 of these songs are over 10 minutes and also take up the last 3 slots on the album, thus leaving the last 30+ minutes of the album on one songwriter\u2019s shoulders. Luckily, Steve Harris is a genius and he knows excactly what needs to be done to make these epics work. They all have their own identity and are all formed around different sounds of the Iron Maiden spectrum:\n\n\u201dDeath Of The Celts\u201d is more or less a Clansman-clone but without the sing-along chorus, and while the latter is notable for it\u2019s instrumental prominance, \u201dDeath Of The Celts\u201d is more notable for it\u2019s vocal performace, at least as far as I'm concerned. That's an uplifting surprise and makes the song a nice complement to it\u2019s older brother. This is arguably Bruce Dickinson's finest moment on the album and will most likely be well-recieved live. \n\n\u201dThe Parchement\u201d has a sound that takes the listener back to The Book Of Souls with it\u2019s dark, epic atmosphere and melodic mastery. The vocals in this song is absolutely phenomenal and the words are sung with a precision that is almost scary. This is probably my favorite song on the album together with the title track and a modern day Maiden classic.\n\n\u201dHell On Earth\u201d closes the album in a saddened and atmospherical way. It takes the listener back to The Final Frontier and it\u2019s closer \u201dWhen The Wild Wind Blows\u201d, but it does so without sounding like a straight rip off. The intro/outro in this song is perhaps the best moment on the album and the vocal delivery by Bruce Dickinson is also a major highlight.\n\nI have to give Steve Harris a huge amount of praise for these 3 songs. It\u2019s remarkable how he, after all these years and all these epics, continues to put out new epics like they are on the assembly line. That\u2019s a true sign of a genius and a well-accomplished musician and songwriter. Bravo Steve!\n\nAs a whole, Iron Maiden have once again proved that they are musically relevant and capable of delivering quality heavy metal despite the fact that they are 40 years into their career, They continue to age but they do so in a worthy and sophisticated way, acting like true role models for younger bands. Even though Senjutsu is more or less a continuation of what the band has done in the last 20 years, the music is of such high quality that it still feels like a fresh, unique listen. It tries some new things here and there but it always stays in the traditional Iron Maiden realm and gives us some new classics in \"Senjutsu\", \"Stratego, \"The Writing On The Wall, \"The Parchment\" and \"Hell On Earth\". If you want Iron Maiden to return to the 4-5-minutes, straight-forward heavy metal anthems that made them a heavy metal staple in the 80s, Senjutsu probably isn\u2019t an album that will suit your preferences. However, if you (like me) appreciate the band\u2019s musical evolution and delve into more progressive and complex territories, Senjutsu will serve as a nice addition to the other 5 albums that the band has released in the last 20 years.\n",
        "\nIt is something of a remarkable triumph, that after 17 albums and consisting of basically the same members for the vast majority of their existence that an album of his quality can result. The 80s were the bands peak in terms of both creativity and performance but unlike many bands that have been around so long they have not taken the same steep nosedive when writing new material. They are not running on empty. Their music has changed and adapted over time, borrowing bits from older ideas and adding to that new ideas. The post reunion material certainly having a focus of longer tracks with more drawn out instrumental sections.\n\nI have often found post 1999, that Maidens music runs the very fine line of over indulgence and competent necessary writing. There has been a growing weariness in their compositions, that you just wish it would end. A song of good ideas and melodies stretched beyond the run time the track required and Book of Souls was a culmination of that. An album that could have lost 15 minutes or so from its total run time across multiple tracks.\n\nThat is not to say this album does suffer some of those issues, it does meander and at times sections do feel dragged beyond reason, though it certainly does less so compared to BoS or TFF. A major positive however is that they finally managed to remember to actually write choruses and not just repeat the song title ten times and call it a day. For the Greater Good of God might be a good song but holy fuck does it suffer from that shit chorus, as do many of their most recent works. Not the case here, every track has been crafted lyrically in whole.\n\nThe two lead singles are probably the two of the weaker songs. Writing on the Wall, had a southern twang that just didn\u2019t sit right with me and felt like it needed to be played at 1.25x. Not a bad song but didn\u2019t blow me away. Stratego was just an average track, not bad but the type of song they have done before and better. This is a faster, shorter rock number that even without looking at the credits I would have guessed Janick had a hand in, which is not a put down, it just has his feel.\n\nAs for the rest, there is a mix of previous albums. It feels like a culmination of everything before. The two stand out tracks are Hell on Earth and Darkest Hour. Both sit at the opposite ends of the spectrum. The former is a massive track that starts slow and soft before jumping into the stereotypical Maiden gallop at around the 2 minute mark, melodic guitars and vocal from Bruce that follow the guitar melody. The song is simply superb, the intro is a little long, 30 seconds less would be perfect. The solos are tasteful, the lyrics angry and pissed off and Bruce's delivery matches the content. Their is a bitter-sweet melancholy to the catchy melody and if this is the last Maiden album and this the last song what a fucking track to end with. It is one of the greatest they have ever written.\n\n\u201cI hope to see you all again on the other side of this Hell on Earth\u201d\n\nDarkest Hour is a ballad and will for that reason be maybe the most divisive track, but it is simple quality. Bruce takes his vocals back a step and just sings, just clear powerful singing. He doesn't go into overdrive on this track and he does not need to. They lyrics and guitars do the necessary work to drive the point home. \n\nThe title track is good, overly long and could have been trimmed a bit, the drum work in the opening though is fantastic. The slower, more sinister dark tone is out of character for Maiden but this set the mood for the album. It is basically X factor fused with A Matter of Life and Death. Lost in a Lost world is a good track, solid guitars and lyrics. The opening vocal passage has a unique for maiden Moody Blues style vocal laying effect that I have never heard from Maiden and weirdly it works. The simple acoustics over the top really help keep the section clean before the overdrive comes in. Time Machine is a track that I don't quite like. It isn't horrible but just doesn't do anything for me. Death of the Celts is ok but feels like it isn't really needed. I don\u2019t think anyone was asking for Clansman 2.0. The original was already a good track and this does not improve upon it. The similarity is unavoidable and for what is offered up here there is no reason for it to be 10 minutes long. It wanders around without a destination and after 10 minutes the journey better be worth it, it isn't. Days of Future Past is a great rocker, would have been my personal choice as the lead single and is sorely needed. With so many longer tracks breaking the album up with shorter to the point songs really helps those longer tracks not feel a slog.\n\nThe Parchment if not for Hell on Earth may well have been the highlight epic, but it is outshone by the far superior closing track. The ending section is wonderfully done and the track feels like it was intended for Powerslave. The entire vibe is that, of a long lost cousin from the former 1984 album.\n\nIt will require standing the test of time but I feel after repeated listens that this might be the bands best post reunion work. Standing up against the 80s era will always be hard but this album does a good job of being noticed among a long catalogue of great material.\n\nHighlights: Hell on Earth, Darkest Hour, The Parchment.\n",
        "\nI never thought I\u2019d see the day \u201cA Matter of Life and Death\u201d was overthrown as the best reunion era album but it has finally happened. Senjutsu, with all its color and flavor, is a little bit more consistent and way more varied in mood changes. In terms of composition it is far more well thought than its predecessor, it seemed like BOS studio sessions were uninspired as they developed all their ideas from scratch in Guillaume Tell\u2019s facilities. This time they had the main motives and themes already written and they just put them together structure-wise with Arry in the studio. The viral promotional campaign for the first single was brilliant, as was the singles\u2019 selection. The Writing on the wall and Stratego are probably the weakest songs on the album but after listening to them a couple of weeks before, it was way easier to digest them alongside the rest of the tracks.\n\nAs a whole, Senjutsu is a tribute to Iron Maiden\u2019s entire career but still sounding fresh and vital as you can expect from the greatest heavy metal band ever, the genre\u2019s epitome. It is heavy and technical, full of proggresive undertones and some references to their previous albums, not rehased though. Adrian Smith\u2019s guitar work and soloing is top notch, after listening to Smith/Kotzen\u2019s album I knew his interpretation was going to be absolutely fantastic as he is in top form and both albums were recorded a few months away. He shares composition credits with Brucie on the first single, \u201cDays of future past\u201d -the heavy rocker of the record- and \u201cDarkest Hour\u201d which is kind of a dark power ballad. Davey isn\u2019t credited on any song but you can hear his leads accompanying the vocal melodies throughout the whole record, and his soloing is as inspired as it was in 1983. Janick wrote \u201cStratego\u201d and \u201cThe Time Machine\u201d with Arry, his trademark acoustic intro style can be noted on the second and his intense, out of the box riffing is fully heard on the first; as well as his crazy soloing. \n\nArry monopolized song credits probably because he arranged every track\u2019s structure but at the same time he let the other member\u2019s ideas flow and his own songs are simply amazing. \u201cLost in a lost world\u201d for example, features the traditional \u201cquiet intro-verses-instrumental break-heavy part-solos-quiet outro\u201d structure, marvelously done. The use of witty bridges is remarkable and distances Senjutsu from its predecessor, which was certainly flawed. There aren\u2019t bass solos or particularly interesting bass fills by themselves but the use of the acoustic bass and the composition in general is out of this world. Bruce\u2019s vocal performance is monolithic, titanic, gigantic. Vocals are so epic that at times it feels like they are bigger than the songs themselves. Lyrics are so touching that they would make you wanna cry as you try to go along with them. Despite being 70 years old, Nicko\u2019s performance is brutal. \u201cSenjutsu\u201d features tribal rhythmic arrangements like I have never heard before. Overall I would say this record was thought and written for the loyal hardcore fanbase, those who equally enjoy The X Factor and Powerslave\u2026 this one goes to all of us. UP THE IRONS, DOWN TO HELL!\n",
        "\nWho would have thought that Iron Maiden would still be releasing albums almost 50 years after the band's inception? Even more: how can they still release quality material that sounds inspired and doesn't plays it safe?\n\nMuch like The Book of Souls, Senjutsu is a double album full of progressive heavy metal epics, with shorter songs here and there in order to make a much needed break in intensity. Thankfully, the bleak and serious tone in the album is consistent, unlike the previous album and its \"happy\" numbers (Speed of Light, Death or Glory), which completely ruined the overall concept.\n\nThe atmosphere and sound here ranks amongst Maiden's darkest, being part of some sort of trilogy formed by The X Factor and A Matter of Life and Death. Furthermore, the band refuses to play it safe, even if the now classic \"Harris epics\" are still relying on a similar formula. There are new things here and there, making one admire Iron Maiden for not releasing a \"back to the roots\" record or that kind of albums most veteran bands release late in their career just for the sake of releasing something (and making money).\n\nThe title track has that kind of attitude. Tribal drumming that might remind one of Tool, droning guitars and soaring solos make Senjutsu one of the band's best album openers ever. Stratego follows, with Iron Maiden's trademark gallop rhythm and one of the best choruses on the album. Then we have The Writing on the Wall, a really strong and catchy single that incorporates some southern cowboy-esque acoustics and some amazing solos by Adrian Smith and company.\n\nLost in a Lost World follows with an intro that seems out of Pink Floyd's Animals. The song has a sound that gives a strong The X Factor vibe, and the ending is amongst the band's most sensible moments in years. Then we have Days of Future Past, another one of the \"shorter\" songs that I hope becomes a live staple in future tours due to its heavy riffing and anthemic chorus.\n\nThen comes The Time Machine, which might be one of the best Iron Maiden songs ever. My only gripe with it is its intro/outro, which sounds like a rehash of The Talisman from The Final Frontier. Remove that and you have a monster of a song, full of progressive twists and turns (that middle break with the pitch-shifted guitars!), with Bruce Dickinson giving an breath-taking performance, coupled by excellent guitar work (Janick Gers deserves far more credit for his role in the band!).\n\nAre we already on CD2?! Unlike The Book of Souls (which felt bloated), Senjutsu flows really well, every track placed strategically (pun intended) to make the experience feel like a concept album (something which Bruce tackled in an interview a couple of days before the release). Darkest Hour is the mandatory epic ballad track, including samples, chorus infused arpeggios (love that 80s goth vibe!) and heroic solos.\n\nSenjutsu's last three tracks are your typical \"Harris epics\", the ones he's been writing since The X Factor days and have that kind of structure: clean intro with arpeggios and the such, heavy sections, an heroic chorus, solos, crazy instrumental sections, twin guitar harmonies, back to the chorus and then, the intro as the outro. While this three last tracks lack in the \"experimentation\" of most of CD1s tracks, they make up with their high quality.\n\nI've always thought Primordial had an Iron Maiden vibe (specially in their most recent albums). Death of the Celts proves that I wasn't wrong, with melodies that give that folky feeling, similar to Virtual XI's The Clansman. This epic undoubtedly feels quite similar in theme and composition to that Blaze Bayley era song (too bad there's some serious clipping in the middle section...).\n\nThe second epic, The Parchment, starts with an ominous Middle-Eastern flavored intro that suddenly breaks with some riffing straight out of A Matter of Life and Death. It is the album's longest track, and the way it twists and turns justifies its length, with some introspective and emotionally charged middle section lead by Bruce's layered vocals, climaxing in one of Senjutsu's best moments...\n\nBut man, THAT CLIPPING IS ANNOYING!!!\n\nLast track in the album is Hell On Earth. And I just hope they play this live, because it's among their finest songs in recent years. A drum fill signs the charge into a heavy gallop rhythm full of excellent riffs and guitar melodies. Despite being 11 minutes and 19 seconds long, this epic has the same energy as the shorter tracks in the album (Stratego and Days of Future Past). The anthemic chorus begs to become a regular in the band's setlist, and the intensity of Bruce's raspy vocals in the final sections is simply extraordinary. Too bad it ends too soon, leaving one wanting more from this fine-aged Iron Maiden.\n\nRegarding the performances, they are top-notch as always. Bruce and Nicko McBrain (specially Nicko) are the stars of the album. Bruce is 63 and has survived tongue cancer: his voice has aged, but he still gives a compelling performance, sounding mature and self-aware of his limitations. What about Nicko? Well, he is the undisputed star of the album thanks to his tom heavy performance (especially on the title track), thunderous fills and tremendous energy. Hard to believe he's the oldest one in the band at 69! My absolute hero!!!\n\nSo, why not a higher rating? Well, besides being an excellent but not perfect album, the thing is it sounds AWFUL. Seriously: the mixing is a train-wreck that feels muddy and unpolished. No, really: IT IS THAT BAD. Nicko gave the performance of his life, but those toms sound so mono and lifeless that kill the overall intensity. Guitar are sometimes so loud they bury Bruce's vocals. And don't get me started on those synths... Such a shame this guys don't have a decent production job since ages, because there's really some quality material here, but ends sounding like some raw mixes with no dynamics.\n\nThe absolute worst thing about Senjutsu? That gloomy sadness that plagues one thinking this might be Iron Maiden's last album ever. Same thing happened with The Book of Souls, but they proved us wrong. I just hope there's more Maiden for years to come, even if there's no more touring. They have their spirits high and they are still trying new things, even if not completely breaking the formula. I worship this guys since I was a little kid and I have seen their live more times that I can count. Knowing their end is getting close is just painful...\n\nLooking on the bright side, Senjutsu is a great addition to Iron Maiden's catalogue, full of surprises that, far for reinventing the band, keep the wheel spinning with new ideas that make one realize their fire is still well alive. I just wish this guys were eternal!\n\n(Originally published in rateyourmusic.com)\n",
        "\nIron Maiden is old. They've been around for forty-odd years, and have been generally pretty awesome for the most part. Of course, for a career that long, it's pretty hard to maintain the same energy. In their early years, they had insanely catchy 3 or four minute songs like \"Run To The Hills\" or \"Aces High\". This album is a landmark in their career, showing that they basically aren't going to be 80's Maiden ever again. The songs here are long and complex. If the twenty minute \"Empire of the Clouds\" wasn't indicative enough of Maiden's new direction, this sure is. \n\nLyrically, this album kills. Iron Maiden has never really been weak in this field, but it's nice to know they aren't faltering any time soon. However, there's still an issue in the vocal department. Bruce, while being a legend, is nearing the end of the road here. While not as shameful to his legacy as Joey Belladonna or Danzig is, he's definitely weathered. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, it compliments the apocalyptic feeling on The Writing On The Wall quite well. And his voice is still powerful, but those high notes are gone.\n\nMusically, the album is... fine. There's a whole lot of synth and strings in this, giving it an almost symphonic metal edge. The riffs are pretty sub-par for Maiden standards. Granted, The Writing on the Wall has a pretty catchy riff, but the weight it has goes away once you realize it's just Momma's Little Baby Loves Shortening Bread. The solos are pretty awesome, taking their time to build. The songs are all structured quite well, but they all kind of blend together. It's basically your choice of epic, depending on what story you want to hear. There are two \"normal\" songs on the album, Stratego and Days of Future Past, but they don't really achieve anything new. \n\nLooking back, Maiden's first epic, \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\" worked so well because it was the big closer for the album. It had an impact. If you have an album of epics, there's nothing really to make them special. I'd say it's worth a listen if you like Prog Maiden, but don't expect to be blown away.\n",
        "\nWhen I first heard Iron Maiden were releasing another album, my heart skipped a beat. When I found out it was a nearly feature-length double album, my heart skipped a beat again but for totally different reasons. I don't think 'Maiden do long albums very well because they're often as unfocused and bloated as my reviews. Sadly, Senjutsu is no exception.\n\nInstead of writing new material, 'Maiden seemed to have completely cannibalised their sound and regurgitated two discs-worth of completely derivative crap. Death of the Celts feels like a rehash of The Clansman, in fact Senjutsu on the whole sounds a lot like the bastard offspring of Virtual XI and Book of Souls which are easily my two least favourite records from the band. I wouldn't mind much if I felt these songs were an improvement over that material, but in every case they're worse - less catchy, less lyrically nuanced and mixed far worse. Songs drag on for upwards of ten minutes (which somehow is less egregious than Book of Souls), plodding about at mid-tempo with very little real direction. I'm pretty sure some of these songs are only this length so each guitarist gets a solo, as if this album was the result of several personal contracts. \"If Dave gets a solo, I want one too and I want it on the same track right after his!\" The whole band sound tired and bored on nearly every track, which is about the worst thing you could ever say about an Iron Maiden album.\n\nThe production overall is bad. Everything is noisy, muddy and distinguishing different instruments can be a challenge at times, particularly during the louder moments. The only exception is Steve Harris' bass which was obviously going to be easy to hear given he has a co-producer credit. Right now, I'd honestly say to hold off on buying a physical edition of this album till a remaster comes out. The synth is awful and Harris should have hired a session musician rather than recording all the parts himself. Not only is it brutishly simple and out of time in places, it adds nothing to these songs. Cuts like The Writing on the Wall don't feature it at all and are much better for it, while the title track ends up stunted and cheesy. Dickinson's vocals are a step up from the band's previous album but that's not saying a whole lot. He seems to be really struggling with the material here in a way that's painful to listen to. He's trying to sing like he's 30 years younger and failing miserably at it, which is upsetting to hear. \n\nI'm sorta stunned at how bad this album is. Sure, I didn't enjoy Book of Souls but it was at least polished and the rough vocals are excusable given it was recorded around the time Bruce Dickinson was being treated for tongue cancer. I guess you could say the pandemic affected Senjutsu in the same way but then why didn't they wait till they could finish the album properly? Go back in the studio (when you can), bring a session player for the synth parts (or better yet leave the fucking things off the record since they're so paper thin and inessential anyway) and take a couple of days to hammer out any problems in the mix. I doubt a band like 'Maiden would lack the resources to do something like this. As it stands, Senjutsu feels like a collection of studio outtakes or a well-recorded demo and isn't at all on-par with the band's output. The idea of some poor sod hearing about Iron Maiden, seeing they have a new album out, listening to this and then dismissing the band's whole output as a result is more than a little sad. Overall, I think that's the word I'd use to sum this album up: Sad.\n\nFans are likely to have a grand ol' time with Senjutsu but for everyone else this album is nothing more than a test of patience with no reward at the end, other than that you can go put Killers on afterwards.\n",
        "\nAfter several years, finally a new Maiden album that many are looking forward to, as well as Judas Priest, Helloween and other bands that have been satisfying us with something new and fresh. On this occasion, this disc is an improvement respecting The Book of Souls and shows a band in a good shape yet the disadvantage lies in the band's creative freedom as is the album with the most contributions from its founding leader since The X Factor, and Dave Murray doesn't participate in. The band's creative freedom also comes down to the production as many presumably think that the responsibility falls on Kevin Shirley, but this man only fulfills his contract and he's at the disposal of boss Harris, so folks, this is another album with the Maiden sound or the Harris sound better said. It's not the producer. You can change the producer but the result will be the same because it's what Harris wants to sound, but the production is still better and convincing than The Book of Souls and The Final Frontier. Gone are those times when Martin Birch contributed to the sound without Harris' dominance.\n\nIn terms of songwriting, songs seem slow at first glance but they lash out frenzied riffs and killer solos when you least expect it. The title track features an outstanding performance by McBrain and looks like an evolved, mature version of Childhood's End and it's by far the best opener since Different World, worthy of a thriller movie soundtrack. \"The Writing On The Wall\" has a little Mother Russia flavor mixed with southern American music and the usual modern formula which has been working since 1995 to some degree, but what really stands out is the flawless ending soloing that generates the same climax as Flight of Icarus. As this band uses to release singles which are the worst songs, my expectations for this album were high, and they didn't disappoint me. \u201cDarkest Hour\u201d is a power ballad that works well structurally for the timing it has and the natural ambient effect kindly reminds the Bathory\u2019s Nordland stuff. On the opposite side \u201cDays Of Future Past\u201d is the focused rocker stuff you're looking for in the pack.\n\nThe last three tracks signed by the bandleader are a fabulous feast reminiscent of the Blaze Bayley era and yes, these songs would fit more on The X Factor than AMOLAD properly, as the last one lies on epicness while The X Factor lies on darkness and melancholy, the predominant vibes on Senjutsu. \"Death Of The Celts\" and \"The Parchment\" (Powerslave, anyone?) have the ability to keep the 90s dark style and they generate enough tension on a par of songs like To Tame A Land, for example. \"Hell On Earth\" will remain in the collective memory as another underrated epic like When The Wild Wind Blows. Normally when it comes to songs exclusively written by Harris is when I am calmer since most of the time they don't disappoint, but surely there will be anyone who says otherwise, although the background of what I affirm is more positive than negative on this scale and on my book. Despite the fact that the last three songs take 34 minutes of listening, they were a pleasant satisfaction since they far exceed the last 30 minutes of the three homologous predecessors. In short, if you're not ready for the Harris trilogy, stay away. If you're the one who longs for the 80s, what are you doing here at this point of the championship?\n\nThe songs have a mid-paced tendency without getting boring as they're finely amalgamated with more dynamic solos than on the previous album. Gone are the repetitive chorus too. Incidentally Smith's solos are a lot better and Gers is such an underrated songwriter as we can see on Stratego and Time Machine when he shows off those riff breaks that make way for a faster hook, proving once again that his energy is essential not only live but in the studio as well. Maybe the production may not favor vocals in some moments since it seems to lack clarity in the mix along with instrumentals. It's also necessary to emphasize that Bruce is no longer the Bruce of the '80s -despite returning with long hair now- so his limitations can be noticeable as usual, nothing new under the sun; but I was really amazed by his performance in Time Machine. Guitars, drums, keyboards and bass are the real stars. Senjutsu takes the musical orientation of The X Factor combined with few folk elements that aren't excessively obvious or excessively epic as on Dance of Death. If this is the album that this band will farewell with, I'm glad for them. A worthy and deserving final battle cry.\n",
        "\nIron Maiden is a name that has become synonymous with heavy metal, and this eventuality is nothing if not totally deserved. Since the dawn of the 1980s, this play it loud and proud institution has not only proven a standout participant in the then burgeoning British heavy metal scene, but has been at the forefront of expanding its possibilities and arguably become the unwitting forefathers of several derived sub-genres. Since their eponymous debut first made waves in the underground and provided a unique bridge between the rocking 70s and what was to follow, they have masterfully blended together a sense of stylistic conservatism with a heightened sense of adventure, often veering well outside the rules of what constitutes radio-friendly material while still retaining a sense of melodic accessibility that has seen then continually filling larger and larger venues in subsequent years. Now more than 40 years deep into their musical journey and showing little signs of slowing down, another grandiose excursion into the world of epic storytelling set to metal has been unleashed to put the rest of the metal world on notice.\n\nHaving set the bar quite high on their 2015 double album The Book Of Souls, which delved into the mystique of the ancient Mayan civilization, it is only fitting that a similarly large scale endeavor with an exotic subject matter function as its successor. Thus stands the hour and 21 minute goliath that is Senjutsu, an even more ambitious and slightly more focused return to the double album format that flows like a veritable tsunami of sound from one riff to the next. In all respects, it ups the ante on what has been a generally consistent, prog rock-infused niche that has been Iron Maiden's signature sound since Bruce Dickinson and Adrian Smith returned to the fold in 1999, delivering a punchy metallic edge that amounts to the heaviest sound heard since the mighty Brave New World first ushered the band into the new millennium. The periphery of the album's production has also seen a noticeable uptick, as Steve Harris' penchant for adding additional texturing via keyboards has seen its a sizable increase that is at least on par with the quasi-symphonic detailing that adorned 1995's The X Factor.\n\nThe passing of time, Bruce Dickinson's recent bout with cancer and the world events that have shaped the beginnings of the current decade have done little to stymie this outfit's spirit, and it shows at every point in this massive and finely tuned metallic machine. Taking a page out of the theatrical character of how The Book Of Souls introduced itself, the opening crusher and title anthem \"Senjutsu\" opts for a dense atmosphere with a thudding drum drone that paints the picture of a grand battle in medieval Japan about to commence. Driven by a chunky, bottom-heavy riff set at a medium pace, this is the sort of song that functions both as a battle anthem and a warmup session, taking the danker and more mystical feel of Dickinson's most recent solo work and merging it into the Iron Maiden template seamlessly. Bruce's vocals, while a bit deeper and more measured, deliver the needed power to bring this song well past the finish line, while the lead guitar work that filters in and out has a highly spontaneous and organic character to it, almost to the point of sounding improvised.\n\nWhile this is an opus that mostly consists of wandering and long-winded compositions that rival the most formally adventurous likes of \"Rime Of The Ancient Mariner\" and \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\" during Maiden's formative days, this band of blokes has not wholly forgotten the fine art of churning out a moderate length banger. The gallop-happy cruiser \"Stratego\" has a slightly more patient and calculating approach to an up tempo rocker, stopping short of the velocity that one would associate with \"The Trooper\" or \"The Evil That Men Do\", but carrying a level of intensity similar to the former and a polished, keyboard-adorned gloss that is comparable to the latter, not to mention a truly wicked guitar solo display out of Ritchie Blackmore disciple Janick Gers, whom assisted Steve Harris in penning the song. Another slightly shorter and even swifter number composed by the same duo in \"Days Of Future Past\" hits the ears with a nice chunky metallic riff set reminiscent of \"The Wicker Man\", but with a denser atmosphere and slightly more elaborate presentation. \n\nBut when push comes to shove, this album is a bearer of large scale storytelling set to music, and a song failing to break the seven minute mark is more the exception than the rule. Lead single and somewhat southern rock meets prog rock banger \"The Writing On The Wall\" sort of bounces back and forth between being a banger and an epic venture, starting on a dreary acoustic intro that's fairly similar to the one that introduced the similarly apocalyptic \"The Book Of Souls\", ultimately landing on a rocking groove that channels elements of Bad Company and Thin Lizzy, all the while maintaining that signature Maiden aesthetic. The gloomy atmospheric turned animated folksy bluster of \"The Time Machine\" carries strong commonalities to a number of noteworthy moments on Dance Of Death and The Final Frontier, while the sorrowful nod to WWII and ballad \"Darkest Hour\" reminds heavily of the most poignant moments of A Matter Of Life And Death, and in both cases the result are songs that take the best elements of said albums and bring them into greater focus.\n\nIn true Iron Maiden fashion, regardless of era, this album's biggest and brightest moments are delivered when the name Steve Harris stands alone in the writing credits and the song lengths become their longest. Playing up an even denser than usual atmosphere and some brilliant vocal layering on the part of Dickinson, the 9 minute journey into unknown lands dubbed \"Lost In A Lost World\" listens like a darker and more developed sequel to 1992 classic anthem \"Afraid To Shoot Strangers\", and sports the most exciting lead guitar exchange heard out of this outfit's elite trio in 20 years. But it all comes to a head with the massive, half hour plus trilogy that closes off the album, which sees Harris throwing just about everything at the listener but the kitchen sink. Whether it be the folkish musings amid the Scottish highlands and Irish moors \"Death Of The Celts\" (which reminisces occasionally upon the unsung 1998 classic of the Bayley years \"The Clansman\"), the slow-coasting and eastern-influenced metallic stomp of \"The Parchment\" that feels like a partial nod to the glory days of Dio-fronted Rainbow and Black Sabbath, or the swift and triumphant melodic splendor with frequent atmospheric breaks that is \"Hell On Earth\", the entire package is a testament to Harris' brilliance as a composer.\n\nIt is often used as a means of derision to assert that a veteran outfit is simply living off their past accomplishments, but despite Iron Maiden being a band that relies upon the familiar in order to expand outward, the final result of this endeavor is a masterwork that builds upon the accomplishments of the past as much as it draws from them. It's a testament to them truly hitting that sweet spot between tradition and evolution that their detractors have accused them of repackaging the same sound over and over while simultaneously complaining that they aren't putting out another Number Of The Beast or Piece Of Mind. This is an album that, while not necessarily better than the timeless classics that were unleashed in the 80s, can stand toe to toe with them and showcase a different approach to heavy metal that focuses a bit more directly upon its 70s rock roots. If it proves to be their final word in a studio capacity, it will be a fine ending to a story that has encompassed most of metal's history, though one can only hope that these mad lads still have one more in them. Tactics and strategy may be the preference of seasoned warriors, but it is often those same veterans who tend to carry the day when the battle ends.\n\nOriginally written for The Metal Observer (www.metal-observer.com)\n",
        "\nThey say every journey starts with a single step, and music, or more precisely metal in this case is no different. I remember listening to Iron Maiden\u2019s \u201cFear of the Dark\u201d when I was 11 like it was yesterday, for it was that song that sparked my love for metal as a whole. From that point forward the British titans were almost all I listened to for the next two years, before I took a detour into other genres *cough* nu-metal *cough*. Following that though I got back into the good stuff, and the band got back into rotation as if they never left. Picking a favourite album from these guys is the equivalent of having to pick a favourite child (it\u2019s actually rather easy to do the latter but we don\u2019t talk about that), but after a great deal of thinking I settled on their fifth album, the amazing Powerslave.\n\nThis is probably the first Maiden album where the band came 100% into their own and perfected their craft. For all it\u2019s worth, the band\u2019s previous two albums, despite having some excellent songs were also dragged down by filler (see \u201c22 Acacia Avenue\u201d off Number of the Beast, or \u201cStill Life\u201d from Piece of Mind). Here though? There\u2019s not a single moment that goes to waste. Even the short instrumental \u201cLosfer Words (Big \u2018Orra)\u201d kicks ass, despite its brevity and lack of lyrics. Powerslave is probably one of the few, if not the only Maiden album that is absolutely bereft of filler, and it really shows. Every gallop and dueling guitar lead is exhilarating and propels this album\u2019s enjoyment factor into the stratosphere.\n\nPowerslave is also where the band managed to hit a perfect balance between their shorter and their more epic side. You get legendary gallop fests like \u201cAces High\u201d and \u201c2 Minutes to Midnight\u201d, which have stood the test of time and have been setlist mainstays for the past few decades, as well as more long winded and grand compositions like the title track and the sailing \u201cRime of the Ancient Mariner\u201d. All of these tracks are filled to the brim with catchy riffs, exciting choruses and all around fantastic songwriting. I\u2019d be remiss not to talk about the title track specifically, which to this day stands as my favourite song the band has ever written, with its ominous Egyptian atmosphere and steady mid-paced gait making it one of the best heavy metal songs of all time.\n\nAnd how could we possibly forget about the vocals? Bruce Dickinson absolutely nails it here, as he did for every single album they put out during the 80s. His iconic delivery and wailing has resulted in some of the catchiest songs I\u2019ve heard in my life. I shit you not, I regularly catch myself humming and singing a lot of these tracks to myself even after going for long periods without listening to the album itself. If that\u2019s not a testament to how catchy the vocal lines and hooks are I don\u2019t know what is.\n\nThe production is also another reason as to why the album sounds so good, besides the compositional skill itself. Everything sounds bright and full, with the guitars having a sharp sound that is supplemented by the plunky bass, while everything is propped up by the punchy and driving sound of the drums. The mixing is also flawless, with everything being perfectly audible at all times and never struggling to be heard. It\u2019s just a complete joy to listen to, and the fact that they managed to get such results while avoiding sounding saccharine and sterile is commendable. \n\nPowerslave is awesome. It\u2019s an album that has been with me since the start of my journey in metal music and its importance to me cannot be understated. I\u2019ve enjoyed it regardless of what phase I was in musically, whether that\u2019d be black metal or something else. Many albums have come and gone through the years but this one has stood the test of time and has stuck around for the past 10 years. Here\u2019s to 10 more.\n\nHighlights: Aces High, 2 Minutes to Midnight, Powerslave, Rime of the Ancient Mariner\n",
        "\nI suppose the thing that most confuses me each time I put on Fear of the Dark is how I'm waiting for the first bad song, and...well, that wasn't too bad...that was better than I remembered...some salvageable parts here...and so on. I mean that, despite quite patently not having the choicest selection of Iron Maiden highlights, this ninth album from the Londoners doesn't stray as far from the path as some would claim, nor does it entirely fail in its more experimental detours. The largest criticism that I can level off the bat would be related to the length of the release, totalling almost an hour across 12 songs, something that would grow to become a severe issue ever afterwards. But, let's face it, if each song lasts less than 5 minutes on average, a bad cut or two doesn't matter so much as if some of them are 10 minutes long.\n\nIn its own way, Fear of the Dark seems a very logical step further into the '90s for Maiden, broadening the quintet's range to include some other textures from more basic (stadium) rock, punk and post-punk, plus a dash of radio friendly stuff that sees moments turning closer to pop than these guys otherwise came. Obviously, all that gets mixed quite well into the old brand of romping melodic metal, and the highlights tend to remind more of classic Maiden of the previous 5 years, though the new features add some intrigue that probably wouldn't be there if rewriting 'Run to the Hills' and 'Aces High'. Allow me to be instantly hypocritical, however, by saying that 'Be Quick or Be Dead' uses that 'Aces High' format to blast the album off to an excellent start, tapping into some of the fiery speed metal from Powerslave and packing great soloing and a steadier chorus alongside a real humdinger of a riff - one of Maiden's best off any album. In general though, the pace very much relaxes for long periods, 'Afraid to Shoot Strangers' for instance hugging balladic territory for half its length and setting itself up as a different version of \"heavy bass presence and moody vocals\", which is one place I get post-punk vibes. Why Fear of the Dark gets away with this can be seen in the second half of this 7 minute song, where Dave Murray and Janick Gers are allowed to play leads and a nostalgic melody in far more energetic style.\n\nOf course, a part of me keeps trying to compare this release to Maiden's latter day exploits, where the pace never really picked up past a steady lope and the solos hit that sweet spot much less. In the first place, with Murray still stuck on his trademark style - which I count among the most instantly recognizable and pleasing in metal - most of the leads can guarantee success, while Gers on his second album probably helped stir up the writing to bring in those new features. 'Fear Is the Key' shows just how differently Maiden were approaching songs, marrying another Egyptian-sounding melodic theme to pretty complex rhythms, which swagger around in the song's opening parts and then twist drunkenly while Bruce Dickinson creates an almost improvised vocal interlude with plenty of character and feeling, switching back to soaring leads that retain the desert style. These peculiarities turn up more often than you'd think, with the \"regular\" tracks actually numbering very few, maybe only the opener, the title track, 'The Fugitive', and 'Judas Be My Guide'. 'Childhood's End', intriguingly, plays classic Maiden with riffless melodies and shuffling drums for the chorus. On the one hand, the production never allows the riffing to hit all that hard, chalking up the first way that this proves less of a heavy metal album, while the smaller quantity of focal riffs during 'Childhood's End', 'Afraid to Shoot Strangers', 'Wasting Love', and 'Weekend Warrior' sort of compromise by aiming more for mood than heaviness anyway.\n\nOn the other hand, several of the songs just don't work very well. I find 'Wasting Love' in need of a name change to 'Wasting Time', while the slightly awkward rhythms (read: much less fluid momentum compared to earlier Maiden) in 'The Fugitive', 'Childhood's End', and 'The Apparition' also limit the enjoyment of those songs, as they seem to get stuck around transitions and lack a bit of a finishing touch. Although I mentioned that the brevity of each individual song helps matters, all those numbers just mentioned drag a bit, while only the sub-4 minute trio in the album's second half actually save their mediocre potential by true economy. Of those, 'Chains of Misery' rocks the gang vocals most of all, which had really come into the sound for Fear of the Dark and contribute to some of its punky/rocky character. Again, Dickinson's charisma does all sorts of favours for that one. Odd in a way that the main sticking points highlight the rhythm section in my view, since they formed such an important basis of the band up to this juncture: the rather dull beats that Nicko McBrain wheels out on the rockier songs contrast Steve Harris heading in another direction, whose moody introductions and verse parts to the balladic songs (very clearly evident in 'From Here to Eternity') work alright yet distract from the drama too often.\n\nI've got down to my conclusion without mentioning the title track almost at all, and that's because I've heard so many tremendous live renditions of it that comparing to this slightly flat but very serviceable recording will certainly put it in a negative light. Truly, 'Fear of the Dark' is the only instance of more progressive songwriting here and it unsurprisingly runs longest too, in addition to standing out in terms of the melodic suss and storytelling lyrics. A deserving classic, but mixed among too many different things that sometimes don't work to let the album of the same name approach classic status. Indeed, I find almost every cut interesting, occasionally despite the clear flaws in decision-making or production, and so it's nice to visit Fear of the Dark when feeling that all the early albums have become too familiar. I'll take this over post-2010 Maiden.\n",
        "\nIt would be fair to say that the 5 (soon to be 6) albums that Iron Maiden have released since the return of Bruce Dickinson and Adrian Smith in 1999 have been met with divided opinions among their fans. While some have welcomed the addition of a 3rd guitarist to their music and appreciated their delve into more progressive territories, others seem to prefer Maiden being a 5 member band and playing shorter, heavy metal anthems in the same way that they did in the 80s. My preferences when it comes to Iron Maiden have always laid towards the former. I see Maiden as a triple-guitar attack as much as a double-guitar attack, I have always identified myself to the trinity of Dave Murray, Adrian Smith and Janick Gers more than to the earlier version of the band where the latter is absent, and I have always seen their progressive leanings as a natural step in the bands musical evolution. One can argue that this evolution culminated in 2015 with the release of their 16th studio album: The Book Of Souls.\n\nThe Book Of Souls takes Iron Maidens progressive leanings to infinity and beyond. For the first time in their 30+ years long career, the band decided to scrap their old formula and release their first double album. Clocking in at over 90 minutes and containing 3 tracks over 10 minutes, including their longest song to date, the 18-minute epic Empire Of The Clouds, The Book Of Souls remains their longest album to date, and regardless of wether you like it or not, you have to admit that it takes a lot of balls to release an album of this size this far into your career. However, releasing a double album is always a risk. The risk for a bloated, pompous mess is always there and you have to be very alert and very smart if you want an album like that to work.\n\nLuckily, Maiden are Maiden and their smartness shines through The Book Of Souls from the first song to the last. Unlike other metal bands who have released albums of this size (Judas Priest, Dream Theater, Blind Guardian), Maiden didn't go for any bloated, rock-operatic approach when they wrote this album. Instead they used their traditional tools and wrote songs in the same way as they have always done. No short interludes, no 20+ number of tracks and no exaggerated, orchestral arrangements. Just 11 songs of pure and simple Iron Maiden music! For that reason alone, the album never loses neither steam nor focus, making these 90 minutes feel like 50-60 minutes, Already there Iron Maiden showed that they were capable of releasing albums of this size.\n\nThe songs on this album never cease to amaze me. One of the main strengths of this album is that it contains a lot of variety, both length-wise and genre-wise. You have 3-4 shorter, straight-forward rockers like \"Death Or Glory\", \"Speed Of Light\" and \"Tears Of A Clown\", you have a semi-ballad in \"The Man Of Sorrows\", you have 2 lenghy epics in \"The Red And The Black\" (13,5 minutes) and the title track (10,5 minutes) and you have a full-blown mini metal-opera in the afro-mentioned \"Empire Of The Clouds\" (18 minutes), which happens to contain strings and a piano-driven base played by none other than Bruce Dickison himself. There are also a lot of tributes to tales of old on this album. The title track, for example, has a second half that seems to be taken right out of Powerslave and the intro to \"Shadows Of The Valley\" is an obvious nod to \"Wasted Years\" from Somwhere In Time. As a whole, all these factors contributes to create a 90+ monster that pretty much sums up Iron Maiden as a musical act. This album can easily be seen as an Iron Maiden candy bag. There are a lot of flavours and if you listen you will probably find at least something that suits your taste. \n\nFor my money the highlights of this album are the big boys! While the shorter, straight-forward songs are good and serves their purpose, this album wouldn't have been worth a s**t for me without it's epics. Both \"The Red And The Black\" and the title track are among my favorite Iron Maiden songs of all time. The first one is more or less a melodic party with a lot of guitar harmonies and a very memorable sing-along chorus. I absolutely adore the part where the title is sung, and the drawn-out instrumental phase in the latter half of the song can easily be described as a highlight in Maidens career overall. The title track has, as I said before, more of a Powerslave-ish vibe and contains some really cool, melodic breaks and an absolutely sledgehammer main riff. Considering it's Iron Maiden we're talking about, it can only be described as a dark and brutal riff! Holy shit! \"Empire Of The Clouds\" is more of a novelty song for me than a pure highlight though. Even though I don't listen to the song that often, I definitely respect it and think it earns it's place in the cataloge of Iron Maiden, and when I actually listen to the song it always hits VERY hard! I just need to be in the right time and place to have that effect!\n\nDespite all the praise I'm giving I will admit that the album has it's flaws (length is NOT one of them!). According to the members of the band, the album was written very spontaneously and you can clearly notice that in some of the songs. \"The Great Unkown\" has a lot of cool riffs and vocal melodies but it abruptly ends before it goes anywhere, leaving a sour taste and a song that feels like a wasted, disjointed mess. There are also a few awkward passages in \"The Man Of Sorrows\" that could have been easily edited after taking a closer look. The opening track,\"If Eternity Should Fail\", is probably my 3rd favorite song on the album after \"The Red And The Black\" and the title track but even that song is drawn back by some major issues. That spoken outro is absolutely awful and should had been left of the album at all costs. And why doesn't that song have a proper guitar solo? It feels empty without a solo and it makes the song lack that \"it\"-factor that some other songs on the album have. That's a real shame because the song is an absolute monster apart from that with it's moody, synth-driven intro, awesome melodies and barnstomer chorus. The production has also been criticized for being muddy and noisy, and while I don't mind it I can at least understand those who criticize it. There are parts of the album that I feel are way too muddy for their own good and could have benefited from a more pollished approach. On the other hand, there are some parts of the album that I think sounds absolutely amazing and where the production really benefits the song. So it's a mixed bag for me when it comes to the produciton. I like it more on some songs than others. \n\nDespite all these issues, I still think Iron Maiden shall be praised for this album. Considering how hard it is to make a double album, I find it absolutely mindblowing that they managed to do it with such a successful outcome. The best songs and parts on the album compensates for the issues tenfold, making The Book Of Souls a very impressive album that benefits from it\u2019s enormous length and manages to feel shorter than it actually is.\n",
        "\nDespite being overshadowed by more far-reaching works in their career, this album is worth getting. It has given me great moments, and Iron Maiden is one of those bands that is not worth a compilation to have the best of them because many wonders are left behind, so this album should also have its place on the shelf of everyone who likes good British Heavy Metal that the '80s gave us, and... why not? also the '90s.\n\nThe good: Be Quick or Be Dead, Afraid to Shoot Strangers, Childhood's End, The Fugitive, Judas Be My Guide and Fear of the Dark. Judas Be My Guide is one of their best compositions from their classic age and it has never possessed the status as Can Play With Madness have enjoyed, which always seemed like a song that could've be played in bumper cars. The most curious thing is \"Be Quick Or Be Dead\", which presumably started from the success that Judas got with Painkiller. It's like a way to go beyond what the public thought about them in the nineties, not because of any particular similarity with Painkiller, but because of the desire to be a harder composition than expected in the band's catalog. Ultimately, the intention was to create the thrash song climate at the time, but spiced up and modified to the unique Maiden style.\n\nThe average: From Here to Eternity, Fear is the Key, Wasting Love and Chains of Misery. They're very funny songs and Fear is the Key is more listenable because of its middle eastern riffs and solos, but they could have do it much better (listen \"7;00 From Tashkent\" by Artillery, for that matter).\n\nThe bad: Weekend Warrior and The Apparition. These ones are easily their worst and futile songs ever, they're bad hard rock songs which try to sound like AC/DC and they're pretty annoying to hear. I never understand why this band release their remastered records but they don't remaster \"Sanctuary\", \"Twilight Zone\" and \"Total Eclipse\". These songs fucking rules. Instead, they should remove the two worst, useless songs ever from this album in the new versions, with this tracklist:\n\n1. Be Quick Or Be Dead\n2. From Here To Eternity\n3. Afraid To Shoot Strangers\n4. Fear Is The Key\n5. Childhood's End\n6. Wasting Love\n7. The Fugitive\n8. Chains Of Misery\n9. Judas Be My Guide\n10. Fear Of The Dark\n\nFull-length: 49:03\n\nIf they release a new version with 10 songs I would give 88% to this. This is the record where Maiden became darker, rockier and more carefree than on previous outcast No Prayer For The Dying. I really love Dickinson's cruder and harsher sonority here, more torn in his manner, a look that sparked bad thoughts and wagged stupid tongues that \"Bruce was done\". I think it was a failed attempt by Harris to reach an hour full-length like Metallica's Black Album, released a year earlier. But with 49 minutes he could deliver a stellar work, maybe not at the level of their 80's stuff but that's not matter because is just like Priest's British Steel, also considered a classic in \"miniature\", for not living up the 70's albums, so yeah, Fear of the Dark is Iron Maiden's British Steel, with the difference that Priest's album doesn't includes awful fillers.\n\nIn my opinion, the least brilliant disc from their classic age (1980-1988 and 1992) without including NPOTD. It's like the unwanted baby by a couple in crisis but in the end they decide to have. A very complicated disc, but you know, Iron Maiden is a band for everyone, and with an era for each person. Privileged and sons of bitches, the ones we still enjoy them.\n",
        "\nThat's what I thought when I read the track \"Death or Glory\" and the simplistic black cover art. By the way, that song is the only one that doesn't convince me at all, so yeah, could have been almost perfect if not for that futile filler. No, I don't think that Empire of the Clouds is a masterpiece at the level of Rime of the Ancient Mariner, and no, I'm not a fanboy who \"defends the indefensible\". It's just a nice experience to listen to this album because many problems that other albums suffer had been fixed here. One of those problems was the excessive use of acoustic intros which I had a hard time familiarizing with, case of Brave New World, A Matter of Life and Death and to a lesser extent, The Final Frontier.\n\nThis record clearly reflects how they learned from the mistakes of previous years. The instrumental parts are much more varied and entertaining than in Brave New World and the choruses, although they are repeated X4 excessively, at least they have more elaborate lyrics than the simple ones in Brave New World (again). There's no \"In a brave new world\" thing over and over. One thing that did not convince me a bit is the production, since here they try to sound too heavy, more than they ever can do. There are riffs and moments when the guitar tone wants to sound like AC/DC, Metallica's Black Album or Megadeth's Cryptic Writings. This album could be a masterpiece if it has the same sound and mixing as the last three tracks on The Final Frontier, which are eargasmic to me.\n\nRegarding the songs, some results a real surprise for me, and others a small disappointment, like the opener \"If Eternety Should Fail\", which should have been more dynamic, compact and with faster choruses. Bruce really sound tired here. By the way, those who say that Iron Maiden covers Iron Maiden only for the wink to Wasted Years in \"Shadow of the Valley\", I must tell you that it is a simple detail, since there is nothing in the later content of the song that reminds the single of Somewhere in Time. The other disappointment was \"Death or Glory\", a song with the most clich\u00e9 title and lyrics you can find anywhere; it's like Judas Priest's \"Heavy Metal\" (you don't say). They really should have discarded this futile filler and saved it as a draft in order to improve and release it in a single or compilation.\n\nThe biggest surprise are the three amigos epics because they have constant rhythm changes comparable to Infinite Dreams. \"The Red and the Black\" and the title track are easily classics, while \"Empire of the Clouds\" offers a cinematic experience, although if you cut the riff repetition a bit, the running time would be 15:20 instead of 18:05, but overall, it even isn't that long. I don't think is that great, in fact, I enjoyed Final Frontier more at first listening. It's already often said but they could really cut back some riffs. On the other hand I like their proposal to go against the current. Many bands would like to release such album, so ambitious, without failing miserably. We have Maiden for many years to come, that's for sure.\n",
        "\nI was listening on youtube shuffle and this song came along. Didn't gab my attention much until the vocals came in. Before that happened I thought I was listening to some Aerosmith or Bon Jovi b-side. You know, some American rock band doing a cowboy thingy. Could work though, 'Wanted Dead Or Alive' was awesome. But this song, not great, just nicely meandering.\n\nAnd as said, then the vocals came in and I immediately thought 'Dickinson made another solo album?'. So I turned on my screen and holy shit. This is Iron Maiden? Well, that is underwhelming. \n\nI am a HUGE 1979-1988 maiden fan and during the nineties each album had at least 3-4 songs I really loved (not Virtual XI though, only 2). But after Brave New World my love has been waning with each consecutive album. And I reached that point back in 2010 that my love pretty much stopped. And so I stopped buying their albums the moment they came out. Eventually I did buy 'The Final Frontier' but at a discount many months after its release. And I played it twice in the past 11 years. 'Book of Souls'? I listened to it once, online. So yeah, for me Maiden is a memory of days long past.\n\nThis new song just isn't great. It is just okay. Not because it 'should be' a speedy song like Aces High, Purgatory or Man on the Edge. Nor is it bad because it isn't an epic like To Tame A Land or Alexander The Great. No. It is bad because it's something (cowboybluesrock) which others have done infinitely better, like Bon Jovi, Aerosmith, Cinderella, heck, ZZ-Top! And Maiden used to be a band who created their own sound and were also better at it than others. So for me, this is 'not worthy'\n\nOn a positive note though: The middle section section however does attempt a bit at 'taking back the music' by bringing 'cowboy-vibe' back to Irish melodies. So kudos for that. Secondly Dickinsons voice is started to sound very aged. His tone is lower. And on this specific song it is quite suiting & soothing.\n\nHowever, I'm gonna play 'Wanted Dead or Alive' now.\n",
        "\nThe new Iron Maiden albums are about as divisive as any new albums from huge long-standing bands tend to be. Personally I think the last couple have been fantastic, with richer and more challenging songwriting and more epic, sweeping melodies than any point since their heyday in the late 1980s. They\u2019ve been long and unwieldy at times, sure, but I don\u2019t believe that has to be a bad thing so much as just a feature of how they are. This new single \u201cThe Writing on the Wall\u201d is more of what they\u2019re good at.\n\nKicking off with a Western-style guitar lick, the tune morphs into a simplistic, headstrong rock riff and then Bruce comes on the vocals howling about dystopian conditions and Biblical despair. It\u2019s not their most complex tune, but they\u2019ve always put out the most straight-ahead songs as singles anyway. The song rolls into a simple midtempo groove with instantly memorable hooks and a great chorus \u2013 it\u2019s not come out of my head since I heard it, and there\u2019s the band\u2019s usual sense of the epic about it. It\u2019s them doing what they do and I dig it.\n\nThe video merits some discussion \u2013 a Mad Max-style tale, it shows a wild, rugged desert future where the inequality in society has the leaders living in shameless luxury while everyone else is starving and destitute. The heads of all the major nations are going to this rave-like thing called Belshazzar\u2019s Feast \u2013 a Biblical story, but turned here into an allegory for the corruption and inequality of the modern world, the haves and the have-nots. It\u2019s capped off with a new samurai Eddie slaughtering all of those assholes. I think it\u2019s a killer video \u2013 though some have rightly pointed out Bruce\u2019s support of Brexit makes it all a bit hypocritical and I can\u2019t argue with that.\n\nMaiden albums have become larger-than-life productions these days, and they don\u2019t seem to care about trimming things down too much. But I think they know what they\u2019re doing. Bring on the new album.\n",
        "\nI'm not gonna give some peptalks here, let's just get into this.\n\nIf you think it's a bold title for a review, I suppose it is. After all, on this record Maiden are allegedly stronger than ever, Bruce Dickinson and Adrian Smith are back, baby! And Janick Gers get to actually stay, creating one of the not-so-many sestets in popular music. And it really shouldn't.\n\nFirst thing out of the way - the songwriting is atrocious. Most of the songs are monotone and unless they get some cool riffs you can bang your head to, they will bore you to death because Iron Maiden thinks progressive metal is all about repeats. And believe me, most of those song have so many riffs repeated it's like relieving the 'Groundhog Day' in form of music. From 'The Wicker Man' up until 'The Thin Line Between Love and Hate' you'll be left wondering why does this album takes up to 67 minutes, when it could've been reduced to 52 or so and lose... nothing, really.\n\nLike, is there a reason 'Dream of Mirrors' is so long? Not only after \"heavy\" intro does the song soften up a lot for over 3 minutes, it doesn't get any better than this. While it's nice that the songs speeds up only 6th minute in (it's something after all, I guess), it couldn't also last long without those repeats. And since there is no good riffs to support it, and what's worse - no good melodies to support it - you'll just ask for this shitshow to end. The same with 'The Nomad', despite the effort to achieve this cool 'oriental' atmosphere, the fact that this song is kept at the same pace throughout its runtime of 9 minutes is just ridiculous. I mean, 'Dream of Mirrors' at least attempted to spice things up. Sure, its slows down after a 4 or 5 minutes. Too bad that this moment is also dragged down to hell. 'The Thin Line Between Love and Hate' is downright forgettable and only the end is worth listening to. 'The Wicker Man', 'Blood Brother' and 'Out of the Silent Planet' are plagued by both boring repeats of choruses/instrumental sections that lead nowhere and some of the worst and most cringe-inducing melodies ever recorded by Maiden. This trademark guitar play was always somewhere between great and not great (for every 'Hallowed Be Thy Name' we got fucking 'Can I Play With Madness'), but those are easily the worst IM harmonies ever.\n\nNot that there are no good songs on this album... Or rather - almost succeded attempts at making those. 'Ghost of the Navigator' wouldn't be so bad, if its main riff wouldn't be a straight rip-off of 'Don't Talk to Strangers' from Ronnie James Dio's solo career. It's not even the first time, since 'Stand Up and Shout' riff was used for '2 Minutes to Midnight', although that riff was created even ealier than these two. Anyway, it's almost hilarious how Maiden had to look up to Dio's solo career to get good riffs. Title track seem to be rather okay, even with the fact that chorus could've been axed in half and only benefit from this process. 'The Mercenary' could be a good heavy metal attack, if it actually stayed in the fast pace for longer than 20 seconds. Seriously, the amount of times the songs slows down kills all the momentum this song is going for. Both 'Dream of Mirrors' and 'The Nomad' have some good ideas, and with few cuts here and there, they would be worth praising they receive.\n\nWhat also bothers me is the whole 3 guitars thing. I guess Harris didn't have a gut to let go of a man who has been a part of Iron Maiden for almost a decade. But it would be far better for both IM and Janick Gers if he left and join a band where they would actually put his skills to use. Iron Maiden doesn't seem to grasp the concept of utilizing 3 guitarists, because not only the Kevin Shirley's absolutely dismal production gives them no chance to shine (and of course Steve has to go overboard with his bass, as if it would kill him if he didn't have a spotlight right on him for 5 fucking minutes), but also riffs, harmonies and solos are mostly uninspired, they lack catchiness. And when they're attempting at doing so, we end up getting 'The Wicker Man' which is the worst Iron Maiden opening song so far. I don't mind cheesy material if it's done right, like 'Army of Darkness'. But this beats 'Can I Play with Madness' in terms of being straight up appalling, which is something I didn't thought I would ever say. I really don't think having 3 guitars benefited Iron Maiden in anyway - in fact, it's exactly opposite. You can hear it well on concerts, where Janick's renditions of oher guitarists' solos are absolutely the worst - especially 'The Trooper', that song didn't had a dual lead for a reason!\n\nBut even if you would do all the necessary cuts and tweaks, there's one other problem - Bruce Dickinson. I have no idea how come he could have fallen so low from great 'The Chemical Wedding' into this nonsense. Not only he's wailing pathetically to the point where he ends up being a self-parody, like in 'Brave New World' (the song), 'Blood Brothers' or 'The Wicker Man', he's very often sounds like he's running out of breath. Sometime it really feels like he's trying to keep up with the rest of the band, but can't by any means. I mean, it's a studio performance, how could anyone allow that to happen? Ronnie James Dio managed to keep his voice mostly intact over his entire career. Erik A.K. Kutson from Flotsam And Jetsam, despite going through notable downgrade in voice scale, sounds amazing on latest 'Blood in the Water' singles. I don't know if it's a matter of practice, or Bruce being such a busy man in both music and all the other shit he's doing, but those pipes of his are rusted and ironically, Blaze Bayley's more restrained and lower pitched perfomance would actually work much, much better. I'm not sure if Iron Maiden should get a new vocalist, since they probably won't bother with making new albums, but this shit shouldn't be acceptable. It's been a problem since long time, but IM fanboys being IM fanboys, decided to deny reality and keep thinking Bruce Dickinson is and always will be the best vocalist of all time.\n\nThe same goes for this god-awful album. Was the homecoming of fan favorites' band members enough to fool everybody to think this record is any good? With all those unncessary drawn-out moments, horribly cringe-inducing melodies and painful vocal perfomance this should never get the rating of over 80%. This album sits around with the worsts, along side 'Virtual XI', 'Book of Souls' and 'A Matter of Life and Death' which I still can't finish to this day. Iron Maiden can do better, but because people didn't want them to improve upon this, is why this reunion mostly sucked balls.\n",
        "\nIron Maiden are legends. That's a fact, and there's really no denying here. Along with Black Sabbath, Judas Priest, Motorhead and Saxon they shaped heavy metal into what we see today and whether you wanna argue which band is better - none of them is, they're all equal opportunity badasses and putting down one over other is just dumb. They all have their share in making metal great, so really, what's all the fighting?\n\nIt's also a fact that all of them had their \"moment of doubt and pain\", as The Rolling Stones used to sing (or they still do? After all those 60 years?). So no, dear fanboys, none of their discographies are perfect, and whenever I see a comment on YouTube like 'X band never disappoints', I have a feeling like this someone is either a blind fanboy that will buy everything, or just hasn't listened to the entire band's catalogue in a long time. I love AC/DC to death, but I can't deny their music is simplistic as fuck - that's just part of their charm, you either like it or not. And I'd also be the first to dig deep into earth to bury every copy of horrendus 'Fly on the Wall', 'Blow Up Your Video' or 'Stiff Upper Lip' - they're simply dull records and 2 or 3 good songs is not enough to keep them in my library. And for those who say \"Oh, it's Brian's fault, AC/DC would never release a bad album with Bon Scott'\" - they would, sooner or later. It happens to every band, eventually.\n\nBut there are differences between bands that manages to get their groove back - Death Angel after disastrous 'Act III' and mediocre 'The Art of Dying', Exodus (those lucky motherfucker even did it twice), Flotsam and Jetsam (also twice, and they didn't took the shortcut of splitting up!) or Motorhead (I lost count how many times they bounced off rushed and uninspired garbage albums) - and those that don't, like Slayer. Or Iron Maiden. I know I step into some rocky territory here. But before I rip to shreds the most overrated album in the entire Maiden's catalogue, I have to kind of explain why the not-so-well received 'The X Factor' is both the most genius and dumbest thing Iron Maiden did.\n\nParadox, eh? But there's no better why to describe it. 'The X Factor' is a mine of great ideas and songs that could be awesome of their own, but they don't really work when blended together. To put it this way - they would be remember much better, if they weren't so damn similar. 7 songs out 11 (or 9 out 14, if you find 'I Live My Way' and 'Virus') starts of with an somber intro. And since 'Lord of the Flies' and 'Man on the Edge' are the only faster songs on the entire record - it really becomes quite repetetive. And it very often doesn't serve anything, aside from making songs longer for no good reason. Cut the intro off 'Look for the Truth' and the song lasts for 3:32 minutes. I CHECKED. It's ridiculous. But somehow this album isn't the worst offender (even with stupidly long 'Sign of the Cross', which I never saw the appeal of) in that department - the worst is yet to come.\n\nAnd because of that, there's very little place for the tracklist to truly shine. I can't deny those song have great riffing, solos and this was the last time Nicko's drumming was any creative. And the song themselves also are far from being bad - 'Blood on the World's Hands' is quite effective and the intro itself is short enough to be memorable and not bore me to death before real song appears. 'The Aftermath' tooks a unique approach, varying between somber moments and heavier ones, which keeps listener engaged throughout entire thing. Similar can be said about 'The Unbeliever', even if the brigde drags a bit, the song has more than enough of hook to not be boring. Also worth noting is Harris' more personal stuff in 'Judgement of Heaven'. Other songs have also some great moments and melodies, but because they feel so similar, it's hard for me to highlight any of them.\n\nThe bonus edition provides two faster songs, 'Justice of the Peace' and 'Judgement Day'. How come they didn't made the tracklist? I mean, yeah, this album goes for darker and more depressing tone, I get it. It works sometimes, like 'Judgement of Heaven', 'Lord of the Flies' or 'Blood on the World's Hands'. On the rest of album though - not so much. And since we already have likes of 'Man on the Edge' or 'The Aftermath' which sound more close to Iron Maiden's typical fun song (unless you read the lyrics, but let's assume for a minute you don't care about them), having them both on the album replace some of those other songs would benefit 'The X Factor' a whole lot. I know there's a clear vision for the album, but that vision works only on couple songs.\n\nWith that all said, I think this album would work better, if it was structured like this:\n'Lord of the Flies'\n'Judgement Day'\n'The Aftermath'\n'Judgement of Heaven'\n'Man on the Edge'\n'Blood on the World's Hands'\n'Justice of the Peace'\n'Sign of the Cross' (debatable, I decided to cut some unnecessary repeats in this one, so for you it can be a closer to entire album)\n'The Unbeliever'\nYou can also squeze in \"I Live My Way' or 'Virus' (although this one also suffers from stupidly long intro) if you want, and there you have it, 'The X Factor' at it's best. There was no need for the likes of 'Look for Truth', 'The Edge of Darkness' or '2 A.M.', sometimes less is more. But only sometimes, dear Onslaught.\n\nSo I think that sums up my biggest issue with this album. As for some obligatory comment regarding Blaze Bayley - I think he does a serviceable job here. He's just not given much of room to work here, and if you listen to his solo efforts, he definitely excels at lower tones. But this is where another paradox walks in, cause it sounds like he sings his way, but Harris also wants him to incorporate some of Bruce's style to it. There's a lot of 'ooooh's in here and they mostly seem forced and unnatural. I mean, it's still better than Dickinson nowadays. Are Maiden fans in denial about Bruce's painful wailing?\n\nIn conclusion, 'The X Factor' is wasted potential. With better tracklist, throwing out repetetive songs and section out the window, and putting less pressure on Blaze, this album could have been the third best of Maiden's discography. As it is, it still stands among the better ones, but it's held back by things I already spoke about. It's also an album with best production in Maiden's catalogue, it's more raw and heavy rather than soft and lacking impact, especially in drums department. But it's also plagued by Loudness War. Because of course it had to, it looked too good to be true.\n",
        "\nI don't think there are any words in the English language that can describe how influential Iron Maiden is. Ever since they gained mainstream success with their 1982 album \"The Number of the Beast\", the English band has come out with hit after hit, impressing many with their versatile stories that range from a battle in \"The Trooper\" or some space themes in \"Speed of Light\". And yet, they all began with this humble little album known as \"Iron Maiden\". Their eponymous debut may not be that impressive at first, and you may find it to be pretty weak. However, the more you listen to it, the more you begin to appreciate it. While it isn't flawless, it still remains a strong album overall and a great start for this iconic band.\n\nWell, where do we start with this project? Well, we do begin the album with the track \"Prowler\". The track itself seems like your typical NWOBHM song, with some hard-sounding guitar riffs and some basic drumming skills. However, when you look a bit deeper into the instruments, you start to uncover some great stuff. The guitars have a very powerful sound that gives the riffs a tough, yet playful sound. The drumming may not seem that special, but the beat patterns are very energetic and set the basis for the other instruments. The bass, while not that prominent, still follows a similar flow to the guitars and also works with the drums for bringing in the foundation. All of this is combined to make an excellent track. In fact, each track has its own specialties that makes it sound special. Whether it be the more dark and gloomy atmosphere of \"Remember Tomorrow\" or the more relaxed and nostalgic tone of \"Strange World\", no track feels like a repeat of the other. They may not seem that impressive at first glance, but looking further in them reveals some of the best instrumentals heavy metal had to offer at that time.\n\nBut while these instruments are great, they need a great vocalist to back them up. This is where Paul Di'Anno comes into the picture. Now Di'Anno's time in Iron Maiden was very short. He was only involved in \"Iron Maiden\" and their next album \"Killers\" before he left the band. Now, I like Bruce Dickenson and all, but Paul had a certain charisma that gave his vocals a very unique sound. One of the best examples of this would be in the track \"Phantom of the Opera\". The track itself has a very upbeat and epic tone to it, and Paul reflects that. His voice is very vibrant and dynamic enough to make his talks of not falling for the Phantom feel serious. Not only that, but his voice flows perfectly to the instruments and further enforces the crazed atmosphere it's going for. But when Paul isn't being uplifting, his more chill personality is great, especially in the track \"Strange World\". There, his singing is very melodic and gives the themes of being in a dream a more sincere tone. It also reflects the very soft and calming instruments very well, and further executes the grand and dreamy atmosphere. Paul Di'Anno's vocals may have been a bit weaker in \"Killers\", but here, they're fantastic to listen to.\n\nAnd then there's the lyrics. Now if you're hoping to find some amazing poetry of history that Iron Maiden is famous for, then prepared to be disappointed, since they haven't exactly reached there yet. However, the lyrics they have here are just as powerful. For example, in the track \"Running Free\", this verse quotes:\n\nJust sixteen, a pickup truck, out of money, out of luck.\nI've got nowhere to call my own, hit the gas, and here I go.\n\nThis verse sets up the story of a 16-year-old who has no home and only has a pickup truck, so he has no other choice than to drive away from his place. The lyrics themselves are pretty basic in terms of storytelling, but what makes the lyrics great is their execution. The overall atmosphere of the track has a more abrasive and rebellious tone to it, and it reflects well to the character's desire to \"run free\". Paul's vocals are also great, since his expressions of anger and rebelling enhances the character's personality. Just about every lyric on this album is like this, where the basic stories are further enhanced by the instruments and vocals. The lyrics of \"Charlotte the Harlot\", however, are a bit weak, since the more cheerful tone is slightly off-putting to the darker themes. Nevertheless, the lyrics are great overall.\n\nSo when all is said and done, there's a good reason why this album is highly praised. The instrumentals have a very unique sound and Paul's vocals are an absolute marvel to listen to. Virtually everything about this album is special, and while it does take some time to understand it all, you'll eventually realize that Iron Maiden still had a distinctive sound in them, even when they were just getting started. Nowadays, everyone seems to know the lyrics to \"The Number of the Beast\", but if you haven't checked out their debut album, then be warned: Wherever you are, Iron Maiden's gonna get you, no matter how far.\n",
        "\nWell, here in Mexico we say dos metros bajo tierra (two meters underground) to refer to someone's final resting place, or more accurately, the actual depth of said resting place, as six feet under would equal 1.83 meters. The differences between the International Metric System and the British or American ones can be head-scratching at times\u2026 but most definitely, not as maddening or logic-defying as Iron Maiden's decision to TOTALLY SUCK during the 90s, starting with this utterly unjustifiable \u201cback to basics\u201d attempt of an album, No Prayer for the Dying, released two year and change after their last monumental masterpiece, Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, in what proved to be one of the most contrasting and unexpected downfalls in the history of metal music. Sure, this record isn't THAT bad, but compared to the unparalleled hot streak of Maiden's gems during the 80s, the juxtaposing of it feels like going from Sabotage to Never Say Die or from \u2026and Justice for All to Load with no stops in between. \n\nFor a band that was at the top of its game in such a monstrous and epic form, this feels (and surely felt) disastrous, though in 1990 mainstream metal was still in pretty good shape, so Maiden fans probably could cope with this trauma by picking, say\u2026 Painkiller (released a month before this) or Rust in Peace (released less than two weeks before) or any of the Irons previous offerings. The loss of Adrian Smith spelled calamity, despite the fact that Janick Gers found himself like a fish in the water in its place, and that in the 21st Century the band managed to get both of them plus Murray together. But something was amiss, and the towering and glimmering column of energy and genius started to plummet quickly back to the ground. Perhaps the band decided back then they have had enough of the proggy side of metal. No Prayer for the Dying sounds like an album recorded by an alternate universe version of Iron Maiden that never found its stride, popularity and creativity, and instead, after their first couple of groundbreaking works, had or chose to diminish back into an inconsequential pub-consigned outfit. \n\nMaiden's eight LP is a mix of some good ideas that lack development, and some really bad ideas that feel imported in nature, all wrapped up by a production that's kind of dry and compressed. And this time, there's a smudge in their otherwise perfect performance. Bruce's vocals\u2026 what the hell? And I know I'm not the only one in saying and thinking this, but his voice CHANGED during the 90s. He used a raspier tone and his screams sound weak and even falter at its end. Just listen to the one at the 2:52 mark on \u201cHooks in You\u201d; sounds like an unfortunate hobo being mauled to death by an escaped zoo cougar. On the other hand, he seems just fine on some tracks, like the sustained notes he sings at the end of \u201cRun Silent Run Deep\u201d. This issue would be continued in 1992's Fear of the Dark, the subsequent Maiden live releases of the 90s and even in some of his first solo material. My guess is, something truly affected his vocal chords those years, and he regained his better form for The Chemical Wedding onwards. \n\nThe rest of the Irons perform just fine, but there're painfully few amazing moments found here. In fact, I consider the\u2026 \u201chighlights\u201d of this LP to be vastly inferior to anything they released previously, those being war-themed opener \u201cTailgunner\u201d, the title-track, which seems like a blueprint for some future Maiden tracks featuring keyboard orchestrations, my beloved/hated \u201cHooks in You\u201d and Bruce's signature composition with the band, \u201cBring Your Daughter\u2026 to the Slaughter\u201d, featuring stellar singing and cool atmospheric passages. Those tracks have several degrees of charisma, and that is found in some parts in other tunes of this album as well, but the inconsistencies are too many. For instance, \u201cAssassin\u201d starts really promisingly, but then you reach the appalling chorus\u2026. damn! The \u201cbetter watch out!\u201d chants sound like they were recorded by some random-picked Premier League drunk hooligans after a match. Maiden gang shouts were never their forte, but had some quirky appeal to them. This one is plainly pathetic. Closer \u201cMother Russia\u201d seems to be an inferior abridged version of \u201cSeventh Son of a Seventh Son\u201d as it tries to recapture the proggy aesthetic, but it isn't too convincing, the pace of Bruce's singing making it sound weird.\n\nSpeaking of inconsistencies, I remember looking at a poster of the \u201cHooks in You\u201d cover artwork by the great Derek Riggs as a 6-year old in a record store, featuring the hook-handed, leather jacket-clad Eddie which seems to be about to rip someone's entrails out. It gave me nightmares, along with some of the classic 80s/90s horror flick icons, but the song, which I listened a good decade after that, actually sounds like a Bon Jovi track. It has some catchiness to it, I won't deny it, but it's a far cry from classic Maiden. Most tracks are enjoyable to a degree, with cleverly written lyrics, but musically they feel like demos or incomplete ideas rather than fully fledged Iron Maiden songs. That would be somewhat corrected for the more varied Fear of the Dark, though the inconsistencies would remain. Whether by design or by a subconscious collective desire to dial it down to 7, No Prayer for the Dying is a tremendously frustrating head-scratcher that constitutes an unwarranted surplus in their early discography.\n",
        "\nI've heard many people say that The Number of the Beast is overrated. Sure, everyone is allowed an opinion, but the importance of this album to the band and the genre as a whole is undeniable. First of all, this was the album that introduced Bruce Dickinson, who is the band's definitive frontman and served as a massive cornerstone of Iron Maiden's legacy, and some of his best performances are on this record. Although the singles, Number of the Beast and Run to the Hills, are quite overplayed, the rest of the album varies from moderate hits to hidden gems, and everything has its place. Despite Gangland and Invaders being some of the band's most hated songs, I personally think that they're both fitting; short but catchy, and considering they're sandwiched between a chain of 6-minute heavy metal behemoths, it's understandable as to why they're forgotten by most. All of the songs have fantastic riffs, incredible solos, and unmatched songwriting. The Number of the Beast can therefore be seen as an extension of Killers, but with a more refined and less repetitive twist. The album is very commercial, admittedly, but commerciality doesn't decrease the quality of the songs, they were still crushing for 1982, back when hairspray, makeup and cheesy generic synthesizers dominated rock/metal. The production still holds up today, the guitar tone is one of my favourites in the Iron Maiden discography, being somewhat of a mix between Killers' wild and vibrant tone and Piece of Mind's crunchy, dry tone. Clive Burr's drumming has been diminished a little bit compared to Killers, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing, since the pattern of the songs has shifted and they're longer songs on average, there isn't a need for insane fills and gallops throughout every song. His playing is still tight, and some of his finest moments are on here, such as the drum intros to Gangland, Run to the Hills, and The Prisoner, and the last minute or so of Children of the Damned.\n\nAdrian Smith and Dave Murray's playing has significantly improved, although they've been adequate players ever since their teenage years in Urchin. Adrian Smith in particular varies his solos much more, like the tapping in Children of the Damned, and the bluesy twist in the solos of 22 Acacia Avenue. When I mentioned earlier that the songs are longer than on the first two albums, most of these tracks are about 5/6 minutes long, and the band doesn't waste any of the runtime. Some of the tracks have an incomprehensible amount of changes. 22 Acacia Avenue has about 30 sections, and that's why it's one of my favourite songs. It's like a different type of progressive, there are so many solos, acoustic parts and riffs that make the songs very memorable. Run to the Hills is one of the biggest metal songs ever written, I don't think I need to explain that. The song is just so classic, the riffs are unforgettable, the mid-paced gallops and monstrous chorus make Run to the Hills a brilliant song. The title track is probably the song I enjoy more out of the 2 singles, and it would be the band's definitive song if it weren't for the title track from their first album. Everything about the song is great, from the intro riff, to Bruce's godzilla screech, to the solo section, to the chorus, it's the recipe for a perfect metal song. But the absolute highlight on the album is Hallowed be thy Name, which is virtually universally praised as the best Iron Maiden song, and one of the summits of heavy metal music.\n\nThis album is influential for a plethora of reasons, its melodic powerfulness, the brilliant song structures, the talent from every member, the virtuosity of the solos, the classic feeling of cuts like The Prisoner, and the passion that was clearly put into it. Every metalhead has listened to this album, some love it and some hate it, but it still unequivocally stands as one of the most significant milestones in music.\n",
        "\nThis album is world-renowned for a reason, although despite Killers being a huge record and known by virtually every metalhead out there, you never really hear any praise for the individual tracks, maybe except for Wrathchild and Murders in the Rue Morgue. So to redeem this, I'm going to be talking about most of these songs and how they were put together to make one of the best albums ever made. Firstly, this was the first album to feature Adrian Smith on guitar, and you can really tell, his solos are vibrant and way more powerful than Dennis Stratton's. Dave and Adrian work much better as a duo, and some of their absolute highlights reside on Killers. The production is fantastic, everything is layered well and the guitars sound much more explosive than on the band's debut. Despite the obvious improvements in production and musicianship, I don't love this album as much as its predecessor, but it's still an awesome bundle of some of the best music you will ever hear.\n\nThe songs are progressive and impactful, apart from tracks such as Drifter and Another Life, which carry the repetitive influence from the first album. Most of the songs are brilliant, with of course Wrathchild being a classic, Murders in the Rue Morgue has some incredible solos and a very powerful intro that really gives you a hint as to what's to come from Iron Maiden later on. Genghis Khan is a vicious instrumental, and a very shitty nu-metal band by the name of Papa Roach built their entire career from ripping off the outro riff, but then again nu-metal itself is a paragon of unoriginality, so I'm not surprised. Innocent Exile and Twilight Zone are catchy and infectious, and the title track is one of the band's most respected songs, it also branded Iron Maiden as a pioneer of speed metal. But I'd say the best songs are at the end of the album, the last three tracks in particular, since Purgatory and Twilight Zone are some of my favourite songs of all time, and when I was 12 I had a serious addiction to Drifter. In fact, the only track on the entire runtime that I would say I don't love is Prodigal Son, I just think it drags on for too long.\n\nWhat makes this album so great is mainly how unique and gripping the songwriting is, and some of the best riffs and solos ever written are spread throughout the record. Every song has something special about it, and everything has its purpose; it's very hard to find filler on Killers, but that can be said about any Maiden release, really (oooo I have a controversial opinion, get over it, no one cares). Clive Burr is a machine on the entire album, his performance is constantly airtight and you can tell he's very skilled at his instrument, the fills are crazy but clean, and this is especially noticeable on songs like Innocent Exile. Paul's vocals are more diverse and iconic this time around, he really uses his wide range in tracks like Twilight Zone and Purgatory, and his voice is passionate and well-articulated. Steve Harris primarily shines here because of his songwriting more than his actual bass-playing, although Innocent Exile and Wrathchild have some of the best bass intros known to man. Steve wrote most of the material on Killers, a trend that is followed through in the band's discography, and I don't even know how one man can write this many good songs in barely 10 months. Dave and Adrian's guitar work like I mentioned before is prime, and the way they intertwine their solos is flawless.\n\nAnyway, any metalhead can listen to this and enjoy it, most metalheads own it and the ones who don't aren't doing their job right. Killers is an essential album and I would recommend it to anyone with working ears.\n",
        "\nIron Maiden is my all-time favourite band, and I will proudly fanboy them until the day I die. First of all, this album was the first Iron Maiden album that I listened to, and arguably this is the album that single-handedly turned me into a metalhead, so it holds a pretty special place in my heart. For 1980, this was extremely complex and intricate heavy metal, but still it never gets boring, whether you prefer the shorter, punkier 3 minute cuts, or the epic 7 minute anthems, this record has plenty of variety and still keeps things fresh, it holds up fantastically more than 40 years later. The production might be a bit one-dimensional, which is especially noticeable on songs like Sanctuary, which sounds quite dry, and I think this record doesn't have the production-wise touch that its successor had, so it doesn't have as much of a classic melodic heavy metal feeling as Killers. Despite this, the lineup worked with what they had, and the result was phenomenal. The drums sound great; the guitars a little bit thin, but honestly I've grown to love the sound, or maybe I've just listened to this so many times that the old-school crunch of the guitars is burned into my brain.\n\nThe performance from every member is tight and about as virtuosic as metal could get in that period. I don't know what Dave Murray was on at the time or even nowadays, but he is my favourite guitarist of all time, and the single reason I picked up the guitar. All of his solos are perfect, the melodies are fantastic and sound way too ambitious and smooth for a guitarist in his 20's. Clive Burr was a beast; his beats were machine-like and I don't think he misses or botches a single note during the entire 40 minute runtime. Dennis Stratton does a good job on rhythm guitars, but of course Adrian Smith is light years better, a necessary lineup change that happened a few months after this was released. Paul's voice is great, he may not have had the piercing range that Bruce Dickinson has, but Paul Di'anno definitely could sing. Steve Harris is probably my biggest influence as a songwriter, his basslines are amazing, and he plays with his fingers! That makes his brilliant playing even more impressive, considering how fast some of the riffs are, particularly on Transylvania and Phantom of the Opera, a song that I wanted to talk about for a minute. \n\nPhantom of the Opera is a masterpiece, the track has an exceptional amount of sections and solos that all blend together unanimously, and regardless of whether some of the material is primitive, the fact that any band could have a song like this on their first album is a feat in itself. The song is emotional, driving, consistent, addictive and memorable, the haunting melodies sound epic and even medieval, this song really is a timeless classic that any metalhead should recognise. It's outstanding. This sense of melody and articulation is carried out in other great songs such as Strange New World and Remember Tomorrow, some more of my favourites. These tracks are just insanely beautiful, and underrated too. Some of these songs were just written to be played live, you have the massive Running Free, Charlotte the Harlot, and the title track, which I was lucky enough to see them perform in 2018 in London (best night of my life). These tracks are fast, thunderous, anthemic, powerful, and although they have a very classic rock and roll vibe, they were very heavy songs at the time, in a time before Bathory and Hellhammer and Possessed and Sepultura and Exodus and even Venom. I think the reason these songs stand the test of time so well is because of the colossal impact and influence that they had on the genre.\n\nI think the majority of the album is a great blend of old school metal and very melodic, potent twists. Even on the first song Prowler, the band presents an original style of songwriting that was unheard of that the time, no other band was doing the things that Iron Maiden did, even Judas Priest was just starting to figure it out, and all of the other bands in the entire world were just playing rock, riff after riff and chorus after chorus, and that isn't an exaggeration. Priest and Maiden really were the first bands to incorporate kickass melodies in their music that really hit hard, with this album possibly being the first of its kind. Anyway, I don't think I really need to say more. With its perfect bridge between riffs and melodies, I think this is an essential for any metalhead. If it bores you, that's fine, I'm sure there's a Limp Bizkit or Black Veil Brides album you can go listen to.\n",
        "\nWhat you hold in your hands is one of the greatest records of all time. I can recall a time when even the weird indie kids in my hometown asked me if anyone liked this release because they thought it ruled--and to be honest, even they were right. The power of Killers is too undeniable.\n\nKillers is often remembered for its more radio-friendly hits--\"Wrathchild\" and potentially even \"Purgatory,\" as both are incredibly brilliant. Yet the real heavy metal genius lies in songs like \"Innocent Exile\" and \"Another Life\" where hallmarks of the genre's bright future are laid. They don't make them like this anymore for a reason--Iron Maiden was able to exist in a world where was nothing but open fields, and they grasped the future tight in their grip and opened up a new space for many to grow in. The hallmarks of the genre had not been laid and d-beats, harmonic flair, and even tightly written ballad-esque songs like \"Prodigal Son\" have their place. While I wouldn't call this track my personal favorite, it goes to show that Iron Maiden represented true heavy metal revolution away from hard rock--they had begun to hone in on what was a powerful and crisp sound.\n\nIt's easy to wax nostalgic about what Iron Maiden WAS at one point in time, and despite them having both the genius and the luck to pioneer what they did in the early 80s...it stands to say that no album like Killers could be written today. There is always potential for better albums to be released, new grounds to be found. But in terms of the influences--Thin Lizzy, Wishbone Ash, Sabbath, Priest, and alongside contemporaries Mot\u00f6rhead, Killers is something else entirely and one that will continue to create metal bands long after its creators are dead and gone.\n",
        "\nI was surprised to read many negative things about this live album even before it was released and when people could only listen to two singles. Some people claimed that no one needs yet another Iron Maiden live record. Others mentioned that the band sounds old and tired. There were complaints about Bruce Dickinson's vocals that were apparently out of tone and rhythm. Some fans criticized the lack of power regarding the thin guitar sound. I read that Nicko McBrain's drum play was too simplified and slow. The production was criticized overall and especially the lack of live atmosphere. I heard that there were almost no interactions between Bruce Dickinson and the Mexican fans.\n\nBollocks! This is Iron Maiden's best live album since Flight 666 eleven years ago. The set list is absolutely brilliant and features timeless classics such as ''Run to the Hills'', more obscure epics such as ''Sign of the Cross'' and even a song that has never been published on any live record before with ''For the Greater Good of God''. The band has excellent chemistry and performs with a balanced mixture of passion and precision. Bruce Dickinson's vocal sound incredible for a singer who was sixty-one years old when this show was recorded. His interactions with the crowd are dynamic as can be witnessed in album highlights ''Where Eagles Dare'', ''The Clansman'' and ''Iron Maiden'' in particular. The production is raw but this suits a heavy metal live album that should never sound too perfect and polished.\n\nThere are only very few elements to criticize. The crowd sounds a little bit quiet from time to time which is certainly not due to a lack of motivation since unofficial footage from the shows proves how enthusiastic the Mexican fans were. My best guess is that I wasn't planned to even release an official live album back when this was recorded and that it was only done to offer fans something to listen to in a time when live concerts and festivals can't take place which is a very generous gesture.The guitar sound could be a little bit more powerful indeed and especially the rhythm guitar work is lacking some punch. I would have liked to hear some more interactions between Bruce Dickinson and the fans and don't understand why they have been cut between songs as this element is certainly a strength of energetic live records.\n\nIn the end, Iron Maiden's Nights of the Dead, Legacy of the Beast: Live in Mexico City is a very decent live album that convinces with excellent band chemistry, an entertaining and dynamic lead singer and a diversified and balanced set list. In addition to this, the detailed cover artwork and colourful booklet look absolutely gorgeous as well. In my opinion, this is the band's best artwork since Best of the Beast released nearly two and a half decades ago. This album might not compete with the band's greatest hours as witnessed on Live After Death when the band was at the height of its career or on Rock in Rio when the band was energized by the return of singer Bruce Dickinson and guitarist Adrian Smith. However, this album sounds much better than lackluster compilative efforts such as A Real Live One, A Real Dead One or even the average previous live album The Book of Souls: Live Chapter. This release is pretty much on the same level as En Vivo and Death on the Road. It's not an essential live record recommended to any heavy metal fan but it's most certainly a must have for any Iron Maiden fan out there. This album proves once again that Iron Maiden has always been and still is one of the greatest live bands in the world.\n\nNow that this point has been made clear again, the band should think about releasing the new studio album it has apparently already recorded some time ago but delayed due to the Legacy of the Beast tour and the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. AC/DC have shown how to deal with the situation. They have sat on their new album for nearly two years but have decided to release their new album after the first wave of the pandemic. Iron Maiden should release its next studio album regardless of potential Legacy of the Beast tour dates once the second wave of the pandemic will be over come spring or summer next year. I can't wait to hear what these legends have been working on as this sextet is still the most relevant heavy metal band out there. Up the Irons!\n",
        "\nWhilst the 1980s were synonymous with excess, it\u2019s fair to say that the 90s were guilty, even if that excess manifested itself in largely different ways. If the 1980s had cocaine and massive false knockers, then the 90s held their own with 25% extra cans of lager and all day breakfast in a tin. Fear of the Dark suffers from two particularly 1990\u2019s excessive traits and ones that have always been irksome for me as listener. Firstly, the band were clearly struggling to muster up enough material to fill a CD (CDs were relatively expensive at the time and bands thought it best to give the listener maximum value for money, despite the fact that most of them struggled to write enough quality material to fill both sides of an LP) and, obviously, the quality suffers for it. Secondly, the album suffers from its \u201cearly digital\u201d recording quality, as despite the largely stripped down, raw material present on the album - Fear of the Dark finds Maiden with their most polished, gloopy sound ever \u2013 apparently their first foray into the world of digital recording. \n\nThere were certainly other digitally produced metal albums prior to this one \u2013 Manowar\u2019s Fighting the World and Judas Priest\u2019s Turbo being two early examples \u2013 and, yet, even more than half a decade later Fear of the Dark suffers from a similar set of problems. Rather than gelling together, the sound is way too separated, too shiny and, particularly, the rhythm section suffers for it (why are Nicko\u2019s drums so boxy? Why is Steve\u2019s bass afflicted with a pristine-yet-grating tone?). Ironically, however, guitar harmonies seem to blend into a mush rather than having a more clearly distinct contrast between the two lines (for a point of reference, you could always hear who was playing which part on the Dave/Adrian albums of the 80s). Sonically, the tones here probably are closest to, say, Somewhere in Time and whilst that production job fits the space-age grandeur of the said album, here it makes me think of those rather ropey mid-to-late 80s AC/DC albums that just strip the band of their raw energy. It is noteworthy that the band universally praised this somewhat sickly, syrupy sound \u2013 apparently it\u2019ll sound \u201cbetter on the radio\u201d than the highly appropriate sound on No Prayer for the Dying (Martin Birch\u2019s last proper Maiden album, as he seemed to be in more of an executive producer role here). Really, I\u2019ve always felt that there is a great disparity between the sound of this album and the material contained herein. \n\nOf course, if Fear of the Dark\u2019s problems were limited to a slippery production job and an excessive running time, we\u2019d be in for a much more enjoyable album. Honestly, as most people will know, the album\u2019s variation is synonymous with inconsistency. Whilst songs like \u2018Be Quick or Be Dead\u2019 or \u2018Childhood\u2019s End\u2019 might make you forget that you\u2019re listening to a subpar album from a top class band, \u2018From Here to Eternity\u2019 will make you rue the day Steve Harris started listening to AC/DC. That\u2019s certainly worth discussing, too, as while Fear of the Dark and No Prayer for the Dying are closely related albums, I feel that the 1990 release rocks in a significantly better manner. No Prayer\u2019s sole AC/DC worship number, \u2018Bring Your Daughter to the Slaughter\u2019, is actually a song I really enjoy; it\u2019s more like Maiden paying homage to 80\u2019s horror and Bon Scott era AC/DC with a macabre and tongue-in-cheek twist (the song plays with imagery from the Nightmare on Elm Street films as well as the pre-menstrual anxiety girls feel before their first period \u2013 which is definitely quite unique). Here, however, the hard rock songs stink of overcooked Brian Johnson late 80\u2019s AC/DC (remember Blow Up Your Video? No, me neither). That is to say they\u2019re incredibly stale sounding and have no redeeming darkness to them. \u2018From Here to Eternity\u2019 \u2013 woefully positioned as the album\u2019s second track for no apparent reason if not to cause the listener great harm \u2013 is just incredibly unconvincing. Harris had no business writing hard rock and Bruce\u2019s tones on this album come across more as \u201ckaraoke night Ian Gillan impression\u201d rather than the work of a first class singer. \n\nElsewhere, the hard rocking manifests itself in a different manner; \u2018Fear is the Key\u2019 has a kind of Zeppelin-meets-Rainbow stomp (tellingly Janick\u2019s guitarwork pays homage to both Page and Blackmore) that ends up being more Kingdom Come than anyone would probably like. Furthermore, the middle section with its \u2018lies and lies\u2019 part reminds me of Tubbs from The League of Gentlemen when she describes seeing a train track for the first time. Clunky arrangements and risible choices seem to be a running theme here. \u2018Wasting Love\u2019 is desperately trying to come across as heartfelt and its theme of \u201ccasual sex is hollow\u201d is quite interesting, but the song never seems to break out from its perfunctory ballad role, especially given the really uninteresting chord choices (although that it\u2019s Maiden playing a ballad is something quite unusual for the band). Still, it\u2019s nice to hear Janick playing such a measured, melodic solo. Of course, within this first category of hard rock songs, \u2018Weekend Warrior\u2019 is the absolute worst, almost like a precursor to \u2018The Angel and the Gambler\u2019 albeit with fewer repeats. Iron Maiden writing The Who-esque rock stompers about football hooliganism sounds like a shit idea on paper, and in practice it\u2019s even worse. Of course, Bruce Dickinson is a thespian who spends his free time writing ribald limericks (or whatever the fuck his books were) and has no place singing about football and his performance on this song resembles that of a cartoon duck \u2013 if you pay close attention, you can actually hear him spiritually leaving the band. I don\u2019t know, leave singing about hooliganism to Cock Sparrer. \n\nOur second category is the \u2018metallic yet not quite there\u2019 which range from pleasant to frustrating. \u2018Afraid to Shoot Strangers\u2019 seems to be the model for much of Harris\u2019s later, gloomy mid-tempo writing. Its execution seems to be very bare-bones (exemplified by the hollow sounding production) and the fast parts seem to be lifted straight from \u2018Hallowed Be Thy Name\u2019 (which were also ripped off on No Prayer for the Dying\u2019s title track). In short, it\u2019s Harris\u2019s limited vocabulary as a writer coming back to bite him. \u2018The Fugitive\u2019 (doesn\u2019t that remind you of an earlier Maiden song? No? Never mind) follows suit from various fillers on No Prayer\u2026 and seems to follow the typical \u201cwriting songs about the last film I saw\u201d, which seems to be Harris\u2019s default position at this point in his career. Is the film any good? The song\u2019s really not up to much. \u2018Chains of Misery\u2019 is much more entertaining \u2013 if only for its surprisingly uncomplicated and straightforward drive. Actually, more so than anything, the song\u2019s bouncy and fuss-free formula remind me a bit of Helloween \u2013 even if it\u2019s chorus is a little more \u201cLA\u201d than the Germans ever managed. Quite refreshing actually, especially given the fact that it doesn\u2019t outstay its welcome. \u2018The Apparition\u2019, in contrast, is pure stodge \u2013 leaden and midtempo, boring chord choices with Nicko\u2019s surprisingly dull drumming (what happened \u2013 he doesn\u2019t really do many interesting fills on this album, does he?). Definitely one of the unremarkable songs in Maiden\u2019s discography. \n\nThirdly, you have the actually rewarding songs from this album, the ones that really justify its place in your collection. Despite my gripes with this album \u2013 and, well, let\u2019s face it all post-1988 Maiden \u2013 I feel that this \u201cnew darker Maiden for a new decade\u201d has its strengths and, when it works, I like it a lot. \u2018Be Quick or Be Dead\u2019 showcases Gers\u2019 strength as a riff-writer \u2013 he and Dave actually write some very good stuff on this album, despite neither of them being as prolific as Harris or Dickinson \u2013 and it has a raucous and vicious vibe that very few Iron Maiden songs have. Certainly, one of the songs that really fit Bruce\u2019s newly adopted vocal style. Despite my criticisms of a lot of his writing around this time, \u2018Childhood\u2019s End\u2019 still shows Harris\u2019s simple galloping formula can work \u2013 given an inspired format. Very simplistic, but rewardingly bleak. Given the hollow, pornographic clarity of the sound you really notice the subtle undertones of keyboards on this album, which makes for a pleasant listen on occasion. \u2018Judas Be My Guide\u2019, of course, is every Maiden fans \u201cunsung classic\u201d choice and with good reason, it has an excellent pacing and, similar to \u2018Chains of Misery\u2019 and Dave\u2019s uncomplicated writing style and brevity (a concept the band often struggle with) wins big in my book. Catchy, well-paced, with a good sense of forward momentum and plenty of great leads \u2013 it\u2019s something I wish the band would do much more often. Weirdly, despite there being 3 live releases surrounding this album, the band couldn\u2019t put this on any of them!\n\nOf course, the title track is masterful and one of Harris\u2019s definitive classics, but even here some of the flaws that hinder the album still come to the fore. In contrast to the live versions of the track, it appears a little too laidback and the contrasts between the opening and the verse are less dramatic. Similarly, the solos work much better when they\u2019re full of that raging intensity as they tend to be live. Nonetheless, it\u2019s still a brilliant song. It captures that childish fear of night time, the urgency on which you rush yourself home on dark nights and that time you really regretted taking that short cut through the park (how were you to know it was cottaging season?). It\u2019s a relatively simplistic epic, but I think that works in its favour \u2013 absolutely gripping writing and I love the, well, dark atmosphere it has (again, I really wish they had been able to translate their \u201cnew dark Iron Maiden\u201d into a wholly successful album at some point, alas). \n\nOverall, however, despite ending on a triumphant note, the overall impression Fear of the Dark leaves is of bitterness due to its inconsistency and the sense that a great band were all too happy to coast on by rather than making a few more risks along the way. Bruce Dickinson recently described his exit from the band in 1993 as like \u201cleaving a safe job\u201d and, definitely, you can feel that inertia creeping in here. There\u2019s a stagnation and a safety to this record that I don\u2019t really appreciate, despite Fear of the Dark having some clear strengths. One can only imagine Bruce putting on a brave face whilst having to stare at Nicko\u2019s nose during breakfast and dinner (egg and chips again!) or listen to Steve write another song with that chord progression\u2026 he knew he\u2019d have to go somewhere else if he was to flourish (and even that took some stumbling at first).\n",
        "\nThis record is extremely dynamic and well-structured for 1979. Despite being a heavy metal demo, the audio quality is amazing, and captures the raw emotion of early Maiden without overdoing the grittiness. There are some minor differences between these tracks and their more recent counterparts, for example, the tempo in Iron Maiden is slower, but the tempo in Invasion is much faster compared to the Women In Uniform version.\n\nRegardless, the songs on here are of course great spins, it's Iron Maiden after all. Iron Maiden is the band's theme song, and it is just as energetic and empowering as the album version of the song, including many sections that blend into pretty much proto-speed metal. Prowler is of course another fun song, everyone is just playing their hearts out, and you have to give huge respect to Steve, Paul Di'anno, Paul Cairns, Dave and Doug for being able to pull off such a good performance on a demo this old. Invasion is the punkiest from the EP, and it's such an addictive track. The fast-paced bridge and belligerent chorus along with the blazing drum intro and lyrics weirdly similar to \"Invaders\" from the Number of the Beast album, it stays strong and makes this EP flawless in terms of songwriting.\n\nThe production, as I've referenced multiple times already, is outstanding for its time, but Steve's bass is a little quiet, and and Paul's vocals sound a bit tinny, and his vocal range isn't as dynamic as on later material. Dave and Paul Cairns' guitar tones also sound thin and surprisingly different from the other versions of the songs, almost as if it's in a different tuning.\n\nThis is the only Iron Maiden album to have drummer Doug Sampson in the lineup. Additionally, contrary to popular belief, Dave Murray didn't actually double-track the guitars on this EP. Paul Cairns was actually the second guitarist for this record, although he wasn't credited.\n\nOverall, the songs are great and you should definitely give this one a spin if you haven't heard them before, although their later versions admittedly are much better. The only drawback on this EP for me is the production, which even then isn't completely terrible. 8/10.\n",
        "\nIron Maiden's Ed Hunter is a compilation released to support the tour of the same name that saw singer Bruce Dickinson and guitarist Adrian Smith join the band again. The twenty songs chosen for this compilation are based upon a voting by fans conducted on the band's website. This compilation also includes a video game that honours Iron Maiden's cover artworks and takes about two hours to complete.\n\nThe main issue with this compilation is that an excellent greatest hits album had only been published three years earlier with Best of the Beast. Many songs on both compilations are identical and the band had only released one new studio album between the two compilations. While Best of the Beast included an excellent new song with ''Virus'' as well as some forgotten pearls from the early years, Ed Hunter mostly focuses on singles and classics without too many surprises.\n\nHowever, some choices are rather weird. It's difficult to imagine that fans would chose recent single ''Futureal'' over the band's epic masterpiece ''Rime of the Ancient Mariner'' for instance. It's similarly hard to figure out why fans would prefer rather unsuccessful single ''Man on the Edge'' over the beloved ''Alexander the Great'' that so many people have asked the band to finally play in concert. The impression I get is that the track list has been adapted to the setlist for the tour and that management absolutely wanted every single album to be represented on the compilation instead of really aiming for the most popular songs.\n\nThe video game wasn't even great by the standards back in the day. It has multiple bugs and looks like a cheap shoot 'em up from the early nineties. It might have been a curious little gimmick for die-hard fans back in the days but as a video game, Ed Hunter is certainly below average to say the least.\n\nDespite all those negative points, it's needless to say that the song material on this compilation is great and finds an overall solid balance between hit singles like The Trooper, fan favourites such as Fear of the Dark and a few forgotten pearls in the key of Stranger in a Strange Land.\n\nIn the end, Ed Hunter might have been an interesting gimmick for die-hard fans back in the days but the fact that the excellent compilation Best of the Beast had only been released three years earlier makes this one rather useless. The compilation hasn't aged particularly well either and is only interesting for avid collectors nowadays. The band should stop releasing so many repetitive compilations, below average video games and even predictable live albums until today to finally offer some new material more than five years after its most recent studio album.\n",
        "\nNot many hard rock and heavy metal bands in the eighties enjoyed the commercial success while not deviating an inch from what they wanted to do the way that Iron Maiden did. All of the albums they made in that decade are considered heavy metal classics, but the complexity was never away from their music. And while the band would become more adventurous with varying degrees of success later on, \u2018Piece Of Mind\u2019 was the first album on which Maiden really dove head-first into longer songs with more complex structures. It\u2019s not their most consistent album, but one of my favorites nonetheless.\n\nEvery Iron Maiden album from the eighties has a perennial classic that is still frequently played live and in this case, that would be \u2018The Trooper\u2019. And rightfully so, because its characteristic harmonized guitar theme, goosebumps-inducing solo section and Bruce Dickinson\u2019s stellar vocal performance make it an incredible track. The thing is that the deeper cuts on \u2018Piece Of Mind\u2019 are at least every bit as good, although the album does take a bit of a dip after \u2018Still Life\u2019. Alternating longer, quasi-progressive tracks with shorter, catchier tracks also extends the attention span here, even though the former are easily my favorites.\n\n\u2018Where Eagles Dare\u2019 is a serious rival to \u2018Moonchild\u2019 as my favorite opening track Iron Maiden ever did. New drummer Nicko McBrain is introduced by means of a fantastic drum roll, after which an amalgamation of \u2013 for the time \u2013 crushingly heavy riffs and what might just be Dickinson\u2019s best recorded performance to date makes this a top 10 Iron Maiden song for me. Compositionally, I really like how the song doesn\u2019t have any guitar solo, but opens up to have a completely different atmosphere during the section where normally the guitar solos would be. Steve Harris\u2019 songwriting triumph.\n\nDickinson contributed his first solo composition on \u2018Piece Of Mind\u2019 and surprisingly for a song written by a lead singer, \u2018Revelations\u2019 is one of the most proggy songs on the album. The song features some great start-stop riffing and some well-placed tempo changes, as well as a handful of incredible melodies. \u2018Flight Of Icarus\u2019, which he co-wrote with guitarist Adrian Smith, is a more accessible track and though I think the chorus is repeated a bit too often, the song is an excellent exercise in dynamics with a fantastic finale. \u2018Still Life\u2019 was always one of the hidden gems in Maiden\u2019s discography to me. Its atmospheric nature may not be for everyone, but it\u2019s still an excellent, multi-faceted Iron Maiden track.\n\nAs stated before, \u2018Piece Of Mind\u2019 is not perfect. \u2018Quest For Fire\u2019 and \u2018Sun And Steel\u2019 reek of filler, though the latter has its moments, and \u2018To Tame A Land\u2019 spots a few really cool bass riffs, especially in how the bass carries many of the melodies, but falls short of Maiden\u2019s other closing epics. Harris really crammed too many words into too little room. Overall though, \u2018Piece Of Mind\u2019 is an incredible piece of eighties heavy metal with a perfect production. The guitars have just the right amount of crunch and the drums sound far more natural than on many modern metal records.\n\nRecommended tracks: \u2018Where Eagles Dare\u2019, \u2018Revelations\u2019, \u2018The Trooper\u2019\n\nOriginally written for my Kevy Metal weblog\n",
        "\nIt's quite common to hear people say that this album is the band's best ever, and it's easy to see why. It's intense, features some of the guys' most demanding playing (especially Bruce), it's gorgeous and exotic in presentation, both aesthetically and musically, and it came out when Iron Maiden were ruling the world, exposing themselves to thousands on the grueling World Slavery tour. But I don't think it sits head and shoulders above the rest of their discography, it fits snugly among its predecessors, but not over them like many believe.\n\nIt certainly starts off on the right foot, with \"Aces High\" and \"2 Minutes to Midnight\" quite possibly being the greatest one-two-punch opening in metal history, the former typifying the intense, hectic sound of the album, while \"Midnight\" manages a solid compromise between Maiden's shorter, more accessible songs and their monstrous epics. If someone asked me 'Who's Iron Maiden?', I'd show them this song. The album stumbles slightly with \"Losfer Words\", the first instrumental since \"Genghis Khan\" and the last one they've done since. Obviously something's missing (the lyrics), but the nice melodies in the \"chorus\" make up for it. The song isn't offensively bad or anything and it does change things up a little bit.\n\n\"Flash of the Blade\" lures you in with the tapping intro, straight into its lyrics based on the legend of St. George and the Dragon. An underrated track, buried underneath greatness. The second half, however, stumbles with \"The Duelists\" an unremarkable song that goes on too long. The chorus isn't very memorable and I find myself tuning out on repeat listens of the album. \"Back in the Village\", admittedly, kicks ass musically, but the lyrics come off as silly, even more so than usual, and can distract from the awesomeness if you're paying attention, otherwise you're too busy admiring the crazy riffs to care.\n\nThankfully everything comes to a head with the final two tracks. The title track injects some exotic, Egyptian flair and could easily have capped the album off by itself, but after it comes the legendary \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\", a leviathan of a song, clocking in at 13 minutes and 34 seconds, but not that you would've noticed, for it seems to be over in no time. It's so well paced and enthralling that it's stunning. It's pacing rivals that of \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\", and puts every longer track on \"Piece of Mind\" to shame. It's incredible and may very well be Iron Maiden's crowning achievement.\n\nWith that the album is over, and we're left with yet another amazing release from Ed and the boys. With its soaring highs it's no wonder people love this album so, however it stills suffers from a couple of weaker tracks that hold it back from true perfection. Even diamonds have flaws, but that doesn't mean they aren't glorious.\n",
        "\nThis one gets its fair share of criticism for not being as progressive as previous albums, but I have never been that concerned about Maiden's musical direction. I guess it's because I wasn't around during the bands classic era, so my experience of this is different from those who were anticipating Seventh Son of a Seventh Son part 2. In recent times I've managed to listen to all of their albums and while this one's clearly weaker than some of its predecessors, it's still a rock solid addition where songs are very memorable.\n\nThis was the first of their '90s album with Bruce Dickinson providing vocals; the other being\u00a0Fear of the Dark. I prefer\u00a0No Prayer for the Dying as it has a significantly shorter running time. It has some catchy guitar melodies, some good leads from Dave Murray and Janick Gers, which never hang on wanky excessiveness. Steve Harris' bass is always prominent and feels important to so many of the songs structures, and a good performance from Dickinson. If you compare this album to what their understudies were doing, it does sound dated, although, other's were at their peak while Maiden had stalled. To their credit, they weren't copying new styles or trends; they were doing their brand of metal, which sounded more like a version of themselves from a decade earlier.\n\nAlthough this album doesn't have the progression and experimentation of\u00a0Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, the opening song 'Tailgunner' has Maiden's distinctive galloping riff, melody and atmosphere. It serves as the high energy opener, much like what 'Aces High' did for\u00a0Powerslave. There's also the overt humour in the line 'Nail that Fokker,' which doesn't sound disrespectful, even though the subject reflects the indiscriminate bombing of German cities and the use of a nuclear weapon on a civilian population. The 'Fokker' joke works, whereas the 'Enema' part in the title of the song 'Public Enema Number One,' is just silly though. The song itself has an interesting lyrically theme and meshes guitar harmonies really well with Dickinson's harsher vocals.\n\nThere's such a good collection of cuts, including the title track with its harmonies, then the sudden shift up in gear. I don't know if this was a regular for live sets, or even used for that matter, but it definitely has an arena vibe about it. And, I don't have an original version \u2013 I've got a remastered copy, which from a production standpoint has a really natural feel about it. It's very clean, measured, but still has a grittiness. And, Nicko's snare rocks \u2013 it really rocks \u2013 like a traditional hard rock sound. 'Fates Warning' also rocks. In fact, the vocals and instruments are perfectly weighted, like a great live performance, minus the audience. They blend their metallic sound with the rock elements very well, then you get more atmospheric cuts like 'Assassin' and 'Mother Russia.'\n\nThere's only one song I rather dislike and that's 'Holy Smoke,' with its really corny lyrics and awkward sounding chorus; aside from that, most of the lyrics and music pass for decent. This is one of the first albums I heard from Maiden and one which persuaded me to delve into their extensive body of work. I respect and often quite like some of their albums \u2013 even the not so classics like this one.\n",
        "\nWhen you look back to Iron Maiden\u2019s long career it\u2019s interesting to see how far Maiden has come and how much the band has evolved since those early days. Nowadays I feel the debut and sophomore album is more or less overlooked by the albums that quickly came after but that doesn\u2019t change their respective qualities and the influence these albums had. Iron Maiden\u2019s self-titled debut exhibits all their distinct sounds and rhythms that they would evolve as they went along but what makes this album, and their second, really different is the huge punk influence seeping through all that galloping rhythm. A big thanks to the more punk influenced sound is the addition of Paul Di\u2019anno with his raspy, rougher voice. \n\nSpeaking of Paul, I feel like he\u2019s the perfect fit for this album. His guttural singing adds power behind the more punk fashioned songs such as \u201cRunning Free\u201d and \u201cProwler\u201d. Paul isn\u2019t all rough and tough though as he can still show a more gentle singing style in \u201cRemember Tomorrow\u201d, \u201cStrange World\u201d, and parts of \u201cCharlotte The Harlot\u201d as those songs change up the tempo so it isn\u2019t a constant speed fest with some slower melody\u2019s to add variety to the overall record. \u201cIron Maiden\u201d is an excellent showcase of Paul\u2019s talent and range but I feel as though his performance in \u201cKillers\u201d is overall a more fully realized performance. \n\nReally, all the performances from the band are fantastic here which is surprising how tight the band was, especially for a debut. Dave Murray and Denis Stratton are able to interchange between punkish speed and the slower melodic tunes greatly influenced from early NWOBHM (early Judas Priest is a good example). Clive Burr is a excellent drummer as he offers some dynamic and tight drumming in songs such as \u201cTransylvania\u201d and \u201cPhantom Of The Opera\u201d. Finally we get to the big man Steve Harris utilizing his galloping bass lines that has influenced and still influences generations of bassists all over the world. Just listen to \u201cPhantom Of The Opera\u201d or \u201cIron Maiden\u201d and tell me that he doesn\u2019t have a distinct sound all of his own because it is nearly impossible to come to that conclusion, especially with this album. \n\nSome say that the drums and guitars what really defines Iron Maiden\u2019s trademark sound but I feel without Steve and his progressive rock influenced bass lines that their distinct gallop wouldn\u2019t have as much of a punch and it certainly does punch here on \u201cIron Maiden\u201d. Everything that would later be refined and expanded upon in future releases is all found here on this debut while also giving us more punk influenced song structures and vocal performances not found much on following albums after \u201cKillers\u201d. A highly influential and classic release that still holds up to this day, \u201cIron Maiden\u201d is distinctly Iron Maiden that offers Maiden lovers, Metal lovers, and music lovers enough to satisfy all.\n",
        "\nThe most recent Iron Maiden record is the only one that I can tell the story about my retrieving it on release day. How I had to run between classes in college to get to the mall and back in time before the next class started. But I'll spare you the rest. With five years to let this beast of a double-album digest, it removes all sense of bias. Despite The Book Of Souls being the longest record by Steve and co. to date, I actually think it managed to pack in a better ratio of good:boring songs than either of the records preceding it. Because of it's immense length, I've probably only heard this in full about five times, with a visit each year, and it certainly holds up every time.\n\nContinuing on doing away with quick catchy openers, \"If Eternity Should Fail\" is still an incredible opener, keeping things epic and intricate while maintaining a strong chorus that hooks you in. On the opposite side of the opposite disc is where this is drawn to the greatest length the band have ever reached, with the infamous \"Empire Of The Clouds.\" The piano lick at the beginning hooked me from the start, and that pattern is what grasps the attention from beginning to end. The way that it goes through phases like multiple songs is incredible. Everything from the softness of the first six minutes, to the chaotic and discomforting center, to the resolution at the end takes Iron Maiden to new heights.\n\nBut in between these massive bookends lies plenty of different approaches. There are admittedly some boring snoozers that you have to sit through, which is basically a promise on such an effort. I find songs like \"The Red And The Black\" to be way too blown up for their own good, not utilizing the long runtime to any real advantage. \"The Great Unknown\" is a great letdown, aiming for that slow crawl with a resolving chorus that just doesn't land. Songwriting aside, there are also times where the mix feels a bit off, with Bruce's vocals struggling to top some of the layers of guitar. Nothing overly offensive of course, but I also can't ignore it. \n\nThankfully, there are also some that are as memorable as they were the first time I heard The Book Of Souls. \"Tears Of A Clown\" is one of the most overlooked Iron Maiden songs ever, and I stand by that. You get your catchy bangers that rely on mass appeal, like the simplified \"Speed Of Light\" with its chorus and blunt riff work. \"Death Or Glory\" also opens the second disc with the same bombastic energy, despite how simple it is. The title track is also a pretty triumphant tune and manages to remain interesting, pulling off what \"The Red And The Black\" strives for. The dispersed solos and fret-hungry backing carries everything sturdily. \n\nSo really, it's a bit of a mixed bag that mostly has good rather bad. I think a lot of the ideas on this record were showing themselves in the three albums preceding it, and this is where all of those came together. This is not a record that you play on repeat. This is a record that you listen to once in a blue moon, take it all in, and then shelf it for a while.\n",
        "\nPerhaps best known as the second of the two albums featuring the oft-maligned Blaze Bayley on vocals, 1998\u2019s Virtual XI saw Iron Maiden at an odd stage in their career. It\u2019s a more upbeat listen compared to the brooding nature of 1995\u2019s The X Factor and seemed to hearken back to the days of Somewhere in Time and Seventh Son with its heightened keyboards and sci-fi aesthetic. The resulting release is almost universally regarded as one of the worst under the Iron Maiden banner, but I would argue that it is more of a mixed bag than an outright disaster.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, there are some great songs on here. \u201cFutureal\u201d and \u201cThe Clansman\u201d in particular have since been deemed good enough to play with Bruce Dickinson singing them but are fantastic staples in themselves, the former predicting \u201cThe Wicker Man\u201d with its rapid-fire delivery and the latter delivering a mix of rousing chants, charging gallops, and fluctuating atmospherics in classic Maiden epic fashion. \u201cLightning Strikes Twice,\u201d \u201cThe Educated Fool,\u201d and \u201cComo Estais Amigo\u201d are much more acquired tastes in comparison, but still manage to revisit that X Factor moroseness with an almost hopeful spirit.\n\nBut on the flip side, the album is frequently crippled by its compulsive repetition. \u201cThe Angel and the Gambler\u201d is the most infamous and egregious instance of this in action, as the inherent cheesiness loses its sense of fun when the chorus is repeated over twenty times in a near ten-minute runtime. Elsewhere, \u201cDon\u2019t Look into the Eyes of a Stranger\u201d plays like an evil twin with its heavy symphonics drawing tension that is ultimately exhausted by the stretched-out structure while \u201cWhen Two Worlds Collide\u201d has its anthemic quality undermined by its forced climax. The moods never feel too off-brand for Maiden, but the underlying hollowness in these structures is always noticeable.\n\nThe musicianship further reflects this sentiment as the signature Maiden tropes are all there but lacking their usual gumption. Steve Harris\u2019s bass is at its usual level of prominence and there are plenty of the expected guitar harmonies, but they come with a sense of fatigue. Blaze ironically seems to be the one putting in the most effort, offering more energy compared to his performance on The X Factor though struggling with the higher range that has come with the adjustment. Thankfully, the solo albums that he\u2019s released in the time since his departure demonstrate a greater mastery of the material of this range and tempo.\n\nIn hindsight, Virtual XI feels like a prototype of Brave New World and the other albums of the subsequent reunion era. Its style consists of a similar mix of old and new elements with songs ranging from upbeat anthems to contemplative epics, albeit with underdeveloped writing and a less fitting vocalist. Considering how several of BNW\u2019s songs were allegedly written during these sessions and how the band has performed songs from this era with Bruce at the helm, one wonders how this material would\u2019ve panned out with careful editing and more charismatic vocals behind it.\n\nVirtual XI isn\u2019t a St. Anger-level dumpster fire or an underrated classic, but it may have been the album that the band needed to make to stay afloat. It\u2019s a very flawed album but in the right mood, I think it can be enjoyable.\n\nOriginally published at Metalhead World\n",
        "\nThe album that came out shortly after my discovery of Iron Maiden took a lot of what muddied A Matter Of Life And Death and improved upon it. Though The Final Frontier isn't a huge step-up, I do feel that the band further recognized what it takes to fully capture a progressive metal album. That does admittedly leave a lot of room for hookless songs, but it isn't really an issue here until the second half. The first half is pretty stellar, as a matter of fact.\n\nFor one thing, Bruce and co. finally abandoned the idea of dropping the standout direct banger in the beginning, and instead did the opposite. The \"Satellite 15\" intensity rides on for several minutes before breaking into the \"Final Frontier\" half to set the stage. Truly, that was a triumphant way to open the record. In general, they also did a lot better than the last album with making the majority of the songs overly long, and one of the longest ones happens to be a favorite of mine. \"When The Wild Wind Blows\" closes the album with immense amounts of emotion, being the only track on side two that really feels like it packed its full potential.\n\nTransitions can also make or break an effort like this, and The Final Frontier has that down far better than before. The way the opening track slips into \"El Dorado\" was impressive as is, and the bass gallops add so much more life to it. You've also got your tracks that suck the emotional blood from the other melancholic veins, and squeeze them into a small syringe. I'm looking at \"Coming Home,\" as this one is as accessible as it gets, and basically sold me from the start due to its touching memorability. \"Mother Of Mercy\" teeters on this line too, although that one is admittedly watered down and relies too much on chorus density.\n\nIt's unfortunate that the beginning momentum ran out of gas around the halfway point. This is an easy step up from what came before it, with evident improvement in songwriting. But I do wish that there wasn't so much void fill that I basically have to sit through until the fantastic closer.\n",
        "\nAlthough this is far from the first Iron Maiden record to drop loads of progressive musicianship, this is the first one that basically makes that the priority. If nothing else, A Matter Of Life And Death is the third one in a row to follow the re-branded aesthetic that they took on in the turn of the century. Hell, it even starts off the same way, with a track that's significantly shorter than the rest, and wears its catchy colors on its sleeve. This goes by the name \"Different World,\" and just like before, it's a fantastic tune!\n\nSadly, I can't say that the rest follows suit. There's a fair amount to grasp onto for the remainder of the album, but full songs that are incredible from start to finish are rare. In fact, the only other one that really jumps out at me is \"For The Greater Good Of God.\" This tune truly extracted what made the preceding records great and stuffed it into this long epic near the back. The basslines and general songwriting is immaculate, and the way that the intro and outro are weaved into an overall powerful body are incredible. It gives me chills.\n\nThe rest of A Matter Of Life And Death is simply a game of digging up the fossils, meaning the strong moments. \"The Longest Day\" is a fine example, as it has a very sturdy backbone but needed some clear trimming, and the vocals got rather tiresome. In fact, that's a general issue overall. Though Bruce's voice is still spot on, he doesn't seem to reach for the extremes he hit before, and some of the more operatic parts just wear the songs down. Even ones that aren't as long, like \"Out Of The Shadows\" don't allow the repetitiveness to paint nearly as pretty of a picture. The moodier songs like \"These Colors Don't Run\" or \"The Legacy\" are filled with memorable licks, but they almost feel recycled from the Brave New World sessions. Some of the epic building lost flavor, and the softer instrumentation and vocals in \"The Reincarnation Of Benjamin Breeg\" are underwhelming.\n\nWhat it ultimately boils down to is that I think Iron Maiden took the progressive / epic / overly-long-song element and ran too far with it. Steve Harris may have some monstrous bass work, and the songs might have a lot of advanced technique. But the trade-off was dropping the memorability, and adding in too many sections that could have otherwise been tossed, or were previously recycled. I'm not gonna say that this is a bad album, and two of the songs are phenomenal. The rest can be tougher to sit through if you're not in the right mood.\n",
        "\nLet\u2019s set the album artwork aside and focus on what matters. Dance Of Death has had a very mixed reaction by the fans since its release almost two decades ago. Although I think it gained some more respect over time, it still takes a fair amount of criticism. To put it simply, I like to think of it as Brave New World part two. It doesn\u2019t hold nearly that level of mind-blowing songwriting, but the style itself is very similar.\n\nFirst and foremost, Iron Maiden managed to inject loads of hooks into the songs here while still keeping the general longer, epic basis for the most part. That\u2019s primarily what the previous disc was crafted on, and it shows here as well. \u201cNo More Lies\u201d is an easy example of this, considering its use of buildup and theatrics while injecting such an earworm of a chorus. Admittedly, that\u2019s a simplistic one-liner that probably could have been improved upon. Closer \u201cJourneyman\u201d is very similar in that sense, and I think both of these songs heavily represent my one gripe about this album; the repetitive factor isn\u2019t used nearly as well as it could have been.\n\nThink, both aforementioned tracks are stellar songs that I enjoy listening to, but could have both been trimmed significantly. Looking at a shorter banger like \u201cRainmaker,\u201d these songs would have done better with their same attitude but executed in the vein of that one. It\u2019s stellar from start to end, and the guitar attacks and vocal clarity back each other perfectly. Some of the middle tracks that don\u2019t quite hold as hot of a flame are also guilty of this, but for the most part are enjoyable enough.\n\nOn the other hand, Dance Of Death has a bunch of songs that reside on the longer side that are absolutely flawless. \u201cAge Of Innocence\u201d still holds the title of one of my top ten Iron Maiden songs ever written, and I stand by it\u2019s stellar verse building and beautiful chorus. \u201cMonsegur\u201d injects nautical feels with its guitar tones, and the writing here is fuming. The soft crawl of the title track even has a pretty remarkable approach, and I dig this one.\n\nHad it not been for a few gripes that held it back, Iron Maiden would have coughed up another record that even beats certain classics. But everything besides that is still incredible, and I\u2019m glad that this record has a solid amount of fans that back it. If you\u2019ve been skeptical to check this one out, I highly recommend it.\n",
        "\nGreetings, fellow metal brothers and sisters! After a year and change I return to this satisfying activity of writing reviews, once again. Before I delve into less known releases and some commissions (for which I'm very grateful), I'll begin to regain my healthy reviewer shape by hitting this 20-year old classic! Man, it feels like ages ago. I clearly remember the ending of the past millennium. There was no COVID-19, but people were more or less equally afflicted with the paranoia of computers' apocalypse, the fear of reaching those dreaded double zeros. More discouraging still, nu metal was all the rage, but my love for Metallica, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Blind Guardian and Immortal among others, shined brightly inside my heart, and fueled many afternoons of sketching medieval knights and outer space monstrosities. I used and abused Napster to scan and explore my ever-broadening panorama of music past and present, metal, prog and classic rock mainly, totally dismissive of the trends at the time and totally unaware my beloved Four Horsemen from the San Francisco Bay Area were already plotting to burn down the mp3 Eden. But thankfully, another of my favorite legends was preparing to make a monstrous comeback.\n\nBrave New World took the world by storm. At least my world, and the one of many metalheads and rockers around the globe. This Iron Maiden incarnation not only brought back THE VOICE of the Air Raid Bruce after making amends with Steve Harris, but also managed to retain all three Iron Maiden guitarists of their best eras, a Gers-Murray-Smith six-string King Ghidorah. This lineup was like a dream come true, and at least on paper the potential was tremendous. I pre-ordered this album at my local CD store since I knew it was in the making, and went to get it the moment I was told it had arrived. The cover artwork was a modern take on Eddie, even more modern looking than the Hugh Syme version on the disappointing The X Factor five years prior. I was surprised to learn that Derek Riggs himself had returned as the creator of this Iron Maiden cover after a decade of stepping out in favor of other artists. To be honest, I've never been a big fan of his digital art and I think he should've stuck to his airbrush mastery, but I concede he nailed it here, collaborating with a superior digital artist in Steve Stone, to give new life to our beloved Brit zombie, with his recognizable visage formed by clouds, gleefully peering over a futuristic London. \n\nCoincidently, I had red Aldus Huxley's dystopic milestone for the first time a few months before I even knew the existence of this Maiden reformation, so everything seemed in its right place as I started reading the lyrics from the booklet. The beautiful title-track, strangely placed third on the playlist, captures both the tragedy and depth of Huxley's work. The lyrics of the whole record seemed a bit more poetic and metaphoric this time around, more adventurous, mature and less narrative than in past Maiden works, with the exceptions of the character-themed \u201cThe Mercenary\u201d (perhaps inspired by Predator movies?), \u201cNomad\u201d and \u201cFallen Angel\u201d. Nothing bad with either of those writing styles, but the new approach was another pleasant surprise. The album and average song length were also unexpected, but the explosive first seconds of \u201cThe Wicker Man\u201d, made it crystal clear to me that this was going to be a great comeback. You can see by my scoring, that my mind hasn't changed to this day, 20 years after its release. \n\nThe production values are superb, no doubt a fine example of the 21st Century advancements in sound engineering. Steve Harris growth as a producer since he first ventured into that field with 1992 Fear of the Dark paid off, as this was at the time, the best post-80s produced Iron Maiden work, with a crisp an modern sound, without the volume abuse some metal works of the new century would be known for. All instruments are distinct and powerful. The guitar tone is marginally more airy and less heavy than on their Blaze Bailey material, and this approach benefits the calmer clear melodic guitar lines found on many tracks, and the overall polished aesthetic of the record. There're even some mild symphonic flourishes here and there, more noticeably felt throughout the elegant waltz-like cadence of the excellent ballad \u201cBlood Brothers\u201d. I\u2019m not particularly fond of the 9+ minute compositions here, which I consider the weakest from this still top-notch comeback effort. \u201cDream of Mirrors\u201d has some great musical passages but suffers from over-repetition of the chorus while \u201cNomad\u201d has better lyrics, and feels like an attempt by the band to recapture the Middle-Eastern mystique of \u201cTo Tame a Land\u201d, but ends up a bit overlong. My preferred cuts remain in the 6-minute excellence of \u201cOut of the Silent Planet\u201d, \u201cGhost of the Navigator\u201d and the titular composition. But there's not a bad tune in here, and I certainly wouldn't remove any from the album. \n\nThe re-born sextet sounds as cohesive as ever, with everyone not named Nicko McBrain bearing songwriting credits. And while the combined power of that beloved trio of guitarists doesn't equate a mind-blowing effort guitar-wise, it is more than satisfying. The riffs are pretty solid and more importantly, those beloved signature Maiden melodies are everywhere to be found. To be honest, they could've managed perfectly with only two guitars, but the tunes are well layered and composed, there aren't any excesses or flaws in that department. The rhythmic section is just as good as the guitars, if not better. Harris stylish pounding and leading bass lines are nurtured by Nicko's ever-creative percussive arsenal. His single bass drum patterns sometimes work fast enough to fool you into thinking he's finally added another bass drum to his kit. He sounds way better than the sum of his best 90s moments, with the only probable exception being \u201cBe Quick or Be Dead\u201d.\n\nBut of course, the final and probably utmost ingredient that makes this sound like a real Iron Maiden record is the returning voice of Bruce Dickinson, and in great shape again. I don't have anything against Blaze, but he was just not enough of an adequate replacement. He lacked the tone and personality, even if he tried really hard to fill those immense shoes. But the mediocrity of 90s Maiden wasn't just his fault. After two unspectacular releases before Bruce departed, the Irons somehow felt they had to go along with the heavier, plodding trends of groove metal and grunge with The X Factor and then tried to correct the course with the meandering, uneven and failed Virtual XI. Brave New World doesn't features this pressure in wanting to belong, it's just the natural evolution of classic 80s Maiden, it is what they do best. IT IS classic Iron Maiden of the new millennium, and after two decades of renewed classic heavy metal and modern Iron Maiden (some of which hasn't been this good, truth be told), its promise of a bright future has been fulfilled and remains true to this day.\n",
        "\nThere is no overstating just how important 2000\u2019s Brave New World has become, not just to Iron Maiden\u2019s legacy but also to heavy metal in general. The album saw the return of guitarist Adrian Smith and lead singer Bruce Dickinson after years away from the band and proved to be commercially successful with songs like \u201cThe Wicker Man\u201d and \u201cBlood Brothers\u201d since becoming live staples. It seemed to be an inspiration on multiple fronts, setting a standard for other old-timers to follow with their own comebacks and inspiring a new generation of younger listeners to explore classic metal. In its own way, I wager that Brave New World has become just as influential as the beloved 80s relics that it was hearkening back to.\n\nWhat\u2019s funny about this revitalization is how Brave New World\u2019s musical template really isn\u2019t that different from the two efforts that Maiden had released in the late 90s with Blaze Bayley on vocals. The overall atmosphere is rooted in the brooding melancholy seen on 1995\u2019s The X Factor and the sci-fi touches of 1998\u2019s Virtual XI with the songs carrying out a similar mix of upbeat anthems and progressive excursions. Rumor has it that \u201cThe Mercenary\u201d and \u201cDream of Mirrors\u201d were allegedly being written when Blaze was still in the band, and their structures make the assertions incredibly believable.\n\nI think the musicianship is what makes this album so endearing compared to those efforts, placating old school listeners with name recognition while also trying out new ideas. This was the first effort to feature their now iconic triple guitar attack as Smith works alongside Dave Murray and Janick Gers to craft layers of interweaving harmonies and gallops that are intricate without getting too dense. Dickinson\u2019s approach has also changed over time; the days of his ear-splitting siren are long gone, but the wizened wail that he picked up during his solo career is utilized with world-weary yet commanding conviction. And like every other Maiden album, Steve Harris\u2019 bass playing is the clanky glue that holds it all together.\n\nIt also helps that the songs are just awesomely written and executed. Despite starting off with a riff pulled straight from Judas Priest\u2019s \u201cRunning Wild,\u201d \u201cThe Wicker Man\u201d is a vibrant opener that plays like a 2000s answer to \u201cTwo Minutes to Midnight\u201d as it effortlessly flows from its blazing verses to the chugging, chanted chorus. \u201cThe Mercenary\u201d and \u201cThe Fallen Angel\u201d subsequently channel this attack with equally engaging results while other tracks like \u201cGhost of the Navigator\u201d and \u201cOut of the Silent Planet\u201d are played with life-affirming fervor. On the flip side, the title track and \u201cBlood Brothers\u201d carry out their anthemic hooks with somber overcasts while \u201cDream of Mirrors\u201d and \u201cThe Nomad\u201d do well as the album\u2019s token epics. I especially love the Seventh Son lyrical callbacks on \u201cDream of Mirrors.\u201d\n\nBut for everything that Brave New World has going for it, I must admit that it isn\u2019t an entirely perfect album. Its hour and seven-minute-long runtime can be cause for concern, and the reliance on chanting one-line choruses can get rather repetitive. This album was also the band\u2019s first collaboration with producer Kevin Shirley, whose raw, muddy touch has become a point of contention on subsequent releases. That said, I find myself unbothered by these factors; the songs don\u2019t really wear out their welcomes due to the efficiently varied pacing, and the production reinforces the aged, earthy vibe that comes with the reunion. These factors would be more pronounced issues with some of the albums that came in its wake, but this one still feels fresh twenty years later.\n\nWhile Brave New World isn\u2019t the greatest Iron Maiden album ever, it is the first of the era that millennials such as myself have come to identify as \u2018my\u2019 Iron Maiden. I imagine it was a joy for old fans to see the band come out strong after a decade of uncertainty, but it was just as enjoyable for those of us who weren\u2019t there during their glory days. The expanded lineup brought life to their familiar formula, and their signature blend of hooky, complex songwriting is given extra pathos that could only come with focused experience. This is the Iron Maiden that I have come to be nostalgic for, and seeing \u201cThe Wicker Man\u201d performed in concert gave me the same exhilaration that others get from \u201cThe Trooper.\u201d It is a true testament to their enduring legacy, and a reminder of no matter how old a band gets, an album with the right circumstances behind it can help shape a generation.\n\nHighlights:\n\u201cThe Wicker Man\u201d\n\u201cGhost of the Navigator\u201d\n\u201cBlood Brothers\u201d\n\u201cDream of Mirrors\u201d\n\u201cThe Fallen Angel\u201d\n\nOriginally published at Indy Metal Vault\n",
        "\nYes, actually, it is that great. Up there with Heaven And Hell as one of the greatest comebacks ever written, Brave New World completed the ideas that were presented back on The X Factor, done in a far more fabulous fashion. Make the emotion feel real, bring back our buddy Bruce, add endless hooks, and you've got yourself an album. Yeah, it surpasses the hour mark, but there isn't a second of wasted time, and it's all used with variance that keeps the attention for the whole duration.\n\nMassive levels of emotion that Bruce and his now three guitarists manage to cast in such an advanced set of writing is what the beauty of Brave New World boils down to. Getting the elephant in the room out of the way, \"Blood Brothers\" reached grand heights, a seven minute ballad that will forever be one of my favorite songs the band has ever written. But looking at some of the lesser talked about tunes, \"The Thin Line Between Love And Hate\" was such an immaculate choice to close us off with. The guitars cry with affection in a clean atmosphere, complimenting the chilling vocals tremendously. Considering the song's length, they make it feel brief.\n\nOn the other hand, Brave New World allows room for some straightforward riff-monsters that sit alongside classics. Opener \"The Wicker Man\" wastes no time with this in the slightest, delivering a solid narrative with concise precision. The melodies in the solo are some of the best, despite being simpler compared to others here. And then you have the title track, one that combines this with the aforementioned emotion, telling the tale of the classic story. That soft intro lick will be iconic forever, and its gradual crawl with suspense is immaculate. \n\nThe pattern is that the longer songs build well off of the shorter ones, giving the album so much fluidity. \"Dream Of Mirrors\" is a solid example of that, and I see this one as stretching the ideas on the title track to solid lengths. It has such calm breaks that are nothing less than soothing, paired alongside an explosive chorus where just the right amount of repetition is used. Common with everything, the guitar tones are even sharper than before, and the descending rhythms that are a recurring theme here intertwine with the proggier takes. You can find that in \"The Mercenary\" quite quickly, another one of my favorites.\n\nBut really, I could name almost any as one of my favorites. It's quite obvious that Brave New World is one that I'm most passionate about, and I could honestly go on forever. This is only topped by Piece Of Mind and Powerslave in my book, and the fact that it's twenty years old new is mind-boggling. Everything Iron Maiden did after this album was a similar approach with its own twists, some working better than others. If you only listen to one \"newer\" album, let this be it.\n",
        "\nReally, Virtual XI is a confusing effort. The one to precede it was glowing with signs of what was coming in regards to more progressive songwriting. That would have been such a smooth transition after jumping singers, but here we are causing a bit of a ripple in the timeline. Being twenty minutes shorter and a slightly less niche, I must admit that I enjoy this better than The X Factor, but not by a whole lot. \n\nThe openers pretty much give you everything you're going to get. \"Futureal\" is a fun enough song, bringing back the galloping energy that wafted from the '80s classics. The melancholic vibes have been turned off, the simplicity went up, and the famous basslines are here in full-effect. That pretty much sums up about half of the songs, though, leaving little in the vein of setting them apart. The hooks aren't in you (ha), and the only other thing worth mentioning is the longer, somewhat epic sounding songs.\n\nYou can gather that all in the second track \"The Angel And The Gambler.\" This one draws in some synth-borders to hold it up, and for the longest time I would enter this album convinced that I've just been missing everything. The truth is though, the same thing applies to these songs as the more down-to-Earth bangers. More importantly, the repetition gets old very fast, and this track in particular won't make that easy to miss. So essentially, you've got long epics that hardly stand apart, and short blasts of heavier writing that don't stand apart. No Prayer gets a lot of criticism for the latter, though I find this to be the disc where that's a true problem. Much like the previous effort, Blaze's voice also annoys me, especially as it's unable to work up to the same degree of punchiness as the instrumentation. Maybe Virtual XI isn't terrible, but you're certainly not missing anything if you skip it.\n",
        "\nOver time, Iron Maiden's tenth studio album has gained a bit of a cult following, making itself higher up the ranks for some people. Albums like this ageing well is always interesting, and I see it in the similar vein as Halloween III. A drastic change can be a good thing, and The X Factor is very much a step out of place. Weirdly, it follows the bloodlines that made Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son more than anything, almost skipping the past two efforts and replacing Bruce with Blaze. Really, I have to appreciate the fact that this disc has its own identity.\n\nBut that doesn't necessarily mean that I like it. What I see it as is getting nothing from something. There's plenty of substance to fill the massive space of seventy minutes. The riffs are certainly there, but ultimately the music feels too transitional, being what takes us to the brilliance of Brave New World. So when you peel back the layers, you're left with songs that are overblown with air. Take opener \"Sign Of The Cross,\" there are licks that sit quite well and ultimately it has a solid backbone. But really, did it need to exceed eleven minutes? Hardly. I won't even deny the amount of emotion that's in this and some of the other songs. But they don't really deliver. \"Lord Of The Flies\" is the same way; strong foundation, too much damn air. The chorus did not need to repeat as much as it did (a problem that didn't go away in future attacks).\n\nThe shorter songs present the same issue as well. \"Man On The Edge\" is a far more straightforward number, yet goes stagnant so quickly. Notice how it's almost like I'm going track by track? Yeah, that's because you can gather the idea as you go, and there's nothing that stands out on its own. Part of this is a bit more personal, and that's that I have a hard time digging Blaze Bayley's vocals. Even his solo work and other efforts outside of Iron Maiden never sat well with me. He does have a good voice with some solid range, but there seems to be a significant lack of push. Thus, a lot of the life is lost that we previously had.\n\nI spin this disc just about once a year to give it a new try, and I just can't dig it like I dig other albums. Nothing about The X Factor is really bad, and there's obvious foundation. But I can't say the songs themselves are memorable in the slightest, despite the repetition. I think of this as similar to the Seinfeld episode \"The Parking Garage.\" Loads that they could have done with what was handed to them, but they kinda.... didn't.\n",
        "\nThough I completely understand where a lot of the turnoffs are for this album's predecessor, I will never understand the attacks that bestow Fear Of The Dark. There's no nostalgia rooted in this, if anything a bit long, but a bit long full of strong songs and perhaps a few fillers. But as any songwriter knows, not every song is gonna be a damn anthem, and fillers can potentially be fine. But much like with No Prayer, this is very much a \"collection of songs\" that are more webbed than linear, pumped with adrenaline and emotion depending on the song.\n\nEmotion comes through in the quick doses of speed and the longer songs themselves. I won't pretend that either are intricate, but both yield some of my favorite Iron Maiden moments ever. \"Afraid To Shoot Strangers\" is the latter, utilizing a slow and somber base that gives way to a very colorful lick that drives the entire song before the eruption at the end. A longer tune that needs all three of its phases. To the opposite end, \"Judas Be My Guide\" is possibly one of my favorite songs by the band in general. It's fast and choppy, but the melodies throughout and the passion in Bruce's voice through the chorus gives me goosebumps. Even the short bridge that rides on the higher frets is superb and untouchable.\n\nTo the opposite end, you get your blitzkrieg warfare that drops itself immediately in \"Be Quick Or Be Dead.\" This one could almost be a thrash metal song just from the attitude and grit alone. The infamous title track combines everything that I've mentioned thus far; emotion, slow licks, speedy kicks, harder attitude, intricacy, and phases that make it a wonderful classic and live staple. You'll get drops of strength in the lesser known tracks, too. See \"Wasting Love\" or \"Childhood's End,\" some that hardly get spoken about but allow for stomping passages and plenty of range to take from.\n\nBut like I said, I won't pretend that Fear Of The Dark doesn't have some obvious filler. \"From Here To Eternity\" is an obvious one, with its rock 'n roll basics and hokey lyrics, or perhaps the watered-down \"Weekend Warriors.\" Even \"Chains Of Misery\" casts a lot of the same silly energy as \"Hooks In You\" from before. The thing about all of these songs is that they're still entertaining. They're ear-worms, and ultimately are only really guilty of being below the bar that Iron Maiden have set for themselves previously.\n\nDespite some weird writing here and there, and perhaps some inconsistency, this is a fantastic fucking album and one of my favorites. None of those things bring anything down significantly, and if nothing else, give the record some more identity of its own. I'll take fillers that stand out over intricate tunes that feel lifeless any day (see the next record for that).\n",
        "\nMy first encounter with Iron Maiden occurred in 1993, the very first year of my meeting with hard rock and heavy metal. I was 14 then and though they were not my first discovery within The Genre (AC/DC were, Metallica and Maiden would follow a couple of weeks later), they are and will probably remain my favourite band, ever. So what would come more naturally to me to start writing my first reviews on the Archives with a Maiden odyssey? Not original at all, I know, as many reviewers here have adopted this same chronological approach. But while one may argue the world doesn\u2019t really need another series of Maiden reviews (it seems there\u2019s something serial about them\u2026), hasn't the British legend become the greatest metal band of all time on which a lot of us, fans and other metalheads, are tempted to give our personal opinion? I have got to confess now that, and it's the less I can say, I'm not a huge fan of what they did after Fear of the Dark, that is, the Blaze Bayley era as well as the post-reunion stuff (we\u2019ll fix this later\u2026). Anyway, I think Maiden deserves another such effort for what they did for heavy metal, and for every one of us who grew listening to, singing and playing their songs, reading their lyrics, scanning their album covers, collecting their rare records like treasures\u2026 and for finally contributing to make a bit of who we are. End of the myth\u2019s praise. Now let's go back to the beginning with the band's first album, which is just blowing 40 candles.\n\nIron Maiden is more often associated with its \"classic era\", well-known for crafting this melodic, subtle and kind of \"cerebral\" heavy metal, switching from imaginative yet sharp rockers to long epic numbers, supported by Bruce Dickinson's soaring and expressive voice, Steve Harris' inimitable galloping bass, Dave Murray and Adrian Smith's mastery of duelling guitar architectures, and Nicko McBrain's dynamic and refined drum work, all together forming this singular alchemy which is the very core of Iron Maiden's spirit. Not exactly like this, (but not exactly unlike this either\u2026), Iron Maiden's first and eponymous album, released in April 1980, is loaded with the ardour, the raw power and the carelessness of youth, that the band would sparsely lose with the tides of time. At the crossroad of, back then, rising heavy metal, decaying punk rock, evergreen hard rock, and added to the stock hints of progressive rock complexity (that became one band's trademark\u2026 for the best and the worst), Iron Maiden is an undisputable milestone of the so-called New Wave of British Heavy Metal, this loose term that tries hard to unite under one banner many dozens of bands that were emerging at the same period. I remember an old interview of Pearl Jam's frontman Eddie Vedder describing the feeling he and his contemporaries had in front of the wave of energy and freshness that was early Maiden. And it remains a mystery to me how this album, although sounding dated (even maybe by 1980 standards because it has more of a mid-late 1970\u2019s feeling) still manages to sound so refreshing even after all these years! \n\nIron Maiden confirms and refines what the band had built on their Soundhouse Tapes demo, adding even more intensity and balls to it. Whereas the NWOBHM at its early stage was mostly constituted of heavy rock acts (Quartz, early-Saxon, Diamond Head, Holocaust\u2026.) or sometimes straight-forward metal (Angel Witch) on which the punk rock invasion had left more or less of its footprint, Iron Maiden's debut perfectly epitomises the movement in all its aspects, while having an identity of its own that distinguished them from the bulk. The rhythm guitars hesitate between a hard rock and heavy metal distortion, this being mostly due to their raw and crunchy texture that marries so perfectly with the crackling sound. The same factor works to emphasize the punky feeling that infuses throughout the album, though Harris hates to admit it. The credit for this goes as well to Paul Di'anno's raging voice and occasionally high-pitched screams which suit perfectly the overall mood, and to the sense of urgency instilled by Clive Burr's nervous drumming. In that way, the album cover picturing the mascot Eddie as a kind of punkish zombie as well as the more concrete lyrics totally convey this nocturnal and dangerous feeling of East London's streets imaginary at the end of the 1970's. Add to this a touch of progressiveness and classy hard rock inherited from their heroes Genesis, Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, Wishbone Ash, UFO or Thin Lizzy among others, and now you get an idea of the magic formula.\n\nAll these ingredients are gathered to make a well-balanced and brilliant album. What you mostly get here are frantic hard rockers boosted with a good dose of metal heaviness and punk energy, catchy yet finely elaborate melodies and articulated breaks, such as \"Prowler\", \"Sanctuary\" (the choice of adding it as the second track on the 1998 remastered edition definitely benefits the dynamics of the whole album), \"Charlotte the Harlot\" and the smashing eponymous \"Iron Maiden\". You get softer moments too with the almost psychedelic ballad \"Strange World\" and the power ballad \"Remember tomorrow\", where the clean guitar arpeggios and bluesy solos showcase Paul Di'Anno's voice which turns surprisingly emotional and melancholic, pretty much in the way Judas Priest had done before them with \u201cDreamer Deceiver\u201d or \u201cBeyond the Realm of Death\u201d. Hopping boogie moments help frenzying the mood too, notably thanks to Clive Burr's swinging and groovy drumming, such as on the catchy single \"Running Free\" or the speedier \"Charlotte the Harlot\" again. And you get of course pure heavy metal attacks, on which Judas Priest appear again to be an obvious yet diluted influence, with the instrumental \"Transylvania\" and even more the epic track \"Phantom of the Opera\", both more oriented towards fantastic imagery, and where the heavy and tremolo picked riffing contributed to pave the way for the thrash metal scene about to emerge.\n\nSpeaking of \"Phantom of the Opera\", I\u2019d say this track is a concentrate of what you can find on this record: gritty vocals, aggressive heavy metal riffs with casual punkish rock n' roll vibes, harmonised duelling guitars lightnings or abrasive and dreamy solos flashing above the clacking bass and the bouncing drums, all this while the paces and moods keep changing in a kind of progressive structure. This track is the prototype for all epic songs Maiden would compose later and the closest here to their defining style. I must focus at this point on the central role Steve Harris plays here, driving the whole thing with the maestria of an orchestral conductor. The bass is unusually loud for the genre and manifests its ubiquitous presence by all possible means, from straightforward lines to purring solos, arpeggios, breakthroughs in the treble territories, supporting the harmonies like a third guitar or sticking to the drum fills like machine gun. It has this finger slapping sound to it that characterises Harris\u2019 singular signature. The fact that he\u2019s the band's main composer is doubtlessly the reason why Iron Maiden sounds so singular in the heavy metal spectrum.\n\nI don't notice any real weak moment in this album. It\u2019s almost perfect for what it is. Even though \"Running Free\" and \"Transylvania\" may sound just a little bit less interesting to me, they still are great fun tracks that totally fit the atmosphere of the disc. It\u2019s intense and flows like a continuous assault from start to finish. Time passes so quickly that you can't believe it's already coming to an end when the anthemic dual guitar melody of \"Iron Maiden\" suddenly rings out. Iron Maiden is a fantastic album that sounds like they really didn\u2019t want to be fought! Along with the next one Killers, it remains a bit apart of the band\u2019s discography because Maiden would never sound that rock n\u2019 roll again, moving towards more fancy horizons. But this is what makes it a unique piece of which I've never got bored for almost 17 years.\n",
        "\nIt\u2019s been difficult to review this one for years, because for me it was the genesis of where I began listening to metal. I remember getting this in 2005 and knowing pretty much nothing about metal or its history \u2013 my parents weren\u2019t into this stuff and my friends, at like 13 or 14, knew only as much as I did really. So I just had to go off of what it sounded like, and build my knowledge of the genre after that, piece by piece.\n\nI\u2019m not going to do the usual bullshit thing where I introduce you to this thing like you\u2019ve never heard of the band or album \u2013 we all get it by now. Instead I\u2019d just like to talk about what I remember hearing this the first time and what I\u2019ve thought about it since.\n\nI probably chose Iron Maiden as the first band to get into for the usual reasons; the cover art, gaudy and badass and comic-book-y. What I remember was just being blown away by the raw, warm guitar sound, the energy, and how different all these songs were. You got the rock-based screamers like \u201cProwler,\u201d which is still such an adrenaline-fueled blast to crank with the windows down while driving. But then what to make of the almost religious, sacred-sounding \u201cRemember Tomorrow\u201d with its mellow parts and the choirs at the end as the heaviness ramps up? It\u2019s free-form, rule-breaking shit, and a beautiful song, more importantly. They couldn\u2019t have done anything like this by the time Powerslave defined them as a band fit for stadiums and history and fantasy-based epic metal.\n\nThey throw in a big epic with \u201cPhantom of the Opera\u201d that has all kinds of odd little twists \u2013 the odd, jaunty, funky sort of bridge with Di\u2019Anno singing \u201cKeep your distance, walk away, don\u2019t take his bait...\u201d is just so weird but delightful. The song evolves into the kind of rolling, intense epic Steve Harris and co. would become known for later \u2013 this was the primordial, Ur form. It sounds fresh and free-form here, but Harris was already dipping into the kind of idiosyncratic style he\u2019d expound on later, with the wordy, breathless lyrical delivery, the big trilling harmonies, the jovial, clicking gallop of his own bass playing underneath like a skeleton.\n\nYou can hear the difference between this and bands who weren\u2019t gonna make it. It\u2019s just in the expansiveness of the ideas and the conviction with which the band attacks them. What I remember when I first heard this was the energy, the ferality, the direct ass-kicking of a lot of it. \u201cRunning Free,\u201d \u201cCharlotte the Harlot\u201d and the title song are just bursts of energy. I was so uneducated about so much of music then, but I knew I wanted something like this, with real power behind it. Di\u2019Anno growls like a street urchin. You get the cool, ultra-catchy riffs \u2013 Harris had a great ear for hooks from the start. Now years later I can hear the originality of it. This wasn\u2019t just expounding on Sabbath and Purple and it wasn\u2019t just everyday pub rock stuff. They pulled in prog rock and all kinds of stuff for a freak-chimera of an album. Then later they\u2019d mold that into a sound that everyone else would call \u201cMaiden-esque.\u201d\n\n\u201cStrange World\u201d is a hippy-dippy acoustic ballad. People who heard this after the other, more established Maiden albums might not even recognize the band on this one. But it\u2019s that kind of ingenuity that keeps this sounding fresh all these years later. It\u2019s such a weird album by this band\u2019s standards, and history has only made it even stranger in the way that Maiden has become an institution with a defined image and style. Yet this is a recording from before all of that happened.\n\nIn some ways, it\u2019s impossible to review this in an accurate way anymore, without having to take on the whole weight of what this band eventually became. It was the first stone of what would become a temple. Other bands were also very good, some of them totally unknown for no reason other than chance, but Maiden just had all the right shit together plus they were in the right place to explode the whole scene. So it goes. It\u2019s irreversible now.\n\n40 years since this thing came out. And 15 since I got into it. Time sure does fly.\n",
        "\nFrom what I've gathered, almost every Iron Maiden fan has one record that they like a hell of a lot more than most of the other fans, and mine is easily No Prayer For The Dying. Considering what came before it, the band made a very dynamic shift in sound. One would probably foresee something even deeper into the realm of progression follow, rather something that hearkens back to basic song structures that build themselves off of catchiness. But does that mean that the songs are bad?\n\nOf course not! And viewing this in the opposite vein of the predecessor, I find it to be solid in its own merit; simply a collection of songs that aren't meant to flow as a whole piece, rather '70s rock oriented into heavy metal riffage and tone. So it shouldn't be out of place for this to be packed with softer songs, and I dig that. The title track is one of these, building itself on softer licks without much bite. Opener \"Tailgunner\" lays on a bit more power, but there's still a much more welcoming aura than much of what the band did prior. \"Run Silent, Run Deep\" takes this same aesthetic and bends it into the form of something a bit more minor in groundwork. I love all of theses songs, and am glad that something like this came for a quick run.\n\nHowever, that doesn't mean there's nothing with a greater kick. Calling anything from this \"classic\" seems like it'd be a stretch, but \"Holy Smoke\" is the closest thing to that. The writing on this one is probably the only one living up to previous efforts, and the lyrical content and execution are incredible. In contrast, you have songs like \"Bring Your Daughter To The Slaughter\" that are watered down to large degrees, but I still can't help but call it an earworm. There's some goofiness to be found in \"The Assassin\" from hokey lyrics, and \"Hooks In You\" is admittedly insipid trash. So I get where some of this has its hits from fans. But, as someone who enjoys little breaks like this in an overwhelmingly advanced discography, saying I dislike it would be a flat out lie.\n\nObviously, No Prayer For The Dying isn't really the album that comes to mind when I think of Steve Harris and co. There's some bare-boned tunes that I understand why they get the hate they get, and they just happen to please me. But I do think there're also some strong numbers that get overlooked. Though there are plenty of albums that the band put out that I prefer to this, I do thoroughly enjoy it all, despite some shortcomings.\n",
        "\nAnother common favorite disc we have reached. Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son always somewhat confused the hell out of me. You\u2019d think Iron Maiden\u2019s shot at doing a concept record would have been one of their biggest steps towards progressive song structures in their entire career. But that\u2019s just not the case, and instead it actually just completes the ideas tampered with on Somewhere In Time. Throw a linear story into this, and you\u2019ve got yourself an album!\n\nWhen I say that that\u2019s weird, I\u2019m considering what most of the music is built on instead. You\u2019ve got even more synthesizers than before, which shows up instantly on the \u201cMoonchild\u201d opener. The vocals and hooks are now even catchier, feeling even more welcoming to your normie radio schmucks. By the sounds of things, we\u2019ve got an Iron Maiden disc of cheesy radio rock songs with loads of synth, and they just happen to fall into a concept, right?\n\nThe answer is an obvious no, and that\u2019s truly what I love so much about Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son. The bigger tracks like \u201cThe Evil That Men Do\u201d and \u201cCan I Play With Madness\u201d are laced up with gushing harmonies and straightforward, banger riffing. Yet, they have such a compelling energy to them that they fit in so flawlessly with the surrounding tracks that are a bit more in-depth. Closer \u201cOnly The Good Die Young\u201d even manages to seal the deal nicely, snapping the rhythms into place with a sense of build-up to prepare the powerful chorus.\n\nOf course, this wouldn\u2019t be anything without your epic adhesives to keep everything intact. The title track is the elephant in the room here, being their second longest song to date behind \u201cMariner.\u201d But I think \u201cInfinite Dreams\u201d gets unfairly overlooked and is like our sequel to \u201cRevelations.\u201d I say that because of its irregular structure and the soothing leads in the center of it. This, along with others on the B-side may not be \u201cepics\u201d as we know them, but they yield the same layers that smoothly contrast our accessible hits. \u201cThe Prophecy\u201d takes the title tracks mass and folds it back into \u201cThe Clairvoyant,\u201d another classic that\u2019s greatly loved. And before you know it, you\u2019re at the simple banger that closes us out.\n\nReally, this contrast that I keep going on about is what I believe drives Seventh Son up so many fan lists. There are so few records out there that combine aspects from opposite ends of the proverbial spectrum so well, and then package it into a neat concept as such. Bruce and the boys may have peaked prior to this, but I\u2019d be a fool to not call it essential anyway. For some, it\u2019ll be a grower.\n",
        "\nIt's weird. Somewhere In Time is widely considered a shark jumping record, but looking back I'm not sure if I feel the same way. It did capitalize on a lot of what the band were going for previously, perhaps more so than ever. And yes, it's when synth became an ingredient. But as far as the songwriting itself goes, I actually don't see it as something that's too far removed from what Iron Maiden had been working with for a couple years prior. The songs continue to have that conceptual feel, just perhaps made slightly less radio accessible (save for \"Wasted Years\"). But ask yourself this; have they ever really been a \"radio\" band?\n\nThe answer is an obvious no, yet adding synthesizers didn't even give it that appeal. So how different can it really be? Like \"Wasted Years\" and other bigger cuts from before, they use harmony to their advantage, and maybe that was upped here. \"Caught Somewhere In Time\" hits you with this right off the bat. But stuff like this aside? Somewhere In Time is still just as masterful with guitar solos and advanced rhythmic / lyrical build as ever. The only thing that was truly dropped was certain degrees of rawness in the instrumentation and production alike.\n\nWhat I really love is how much energy some of the more overlooked ones contain. \"Deja Vu\" is a song that falls victim, likely due to it being less complex and a bit out of place. But it's a relentless ball of energy that drives the gang chorus power to levels that none of the other tracks touch. \"Sea Of Madness\" may come close because of its descending nature causing a similar effect, but it's still done differently. I will give that one credit for nailing the quieter bridge with thumping bass so well. I'd hardly call \"The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner\" overlooked, since it appears to get tons of love. Considering how immaculate the instrumentation is here, however, I'm amazed it isn't as giant. Those melodies in the intro, and the shifts in moods without error are untouchable.\n\nBut in reality, I will admit that Iron Maiden did fall just the slightest bit short in terms of memorability here. It's surrounded by what are commonly the two highest-ranked albums, so that likely has something to do with it. Don't read me wrong; it's a spectacular fucking record, one that certainly tops off Killers. I just find myself returning to it ever-so-slightly less than most of the other classics thanks to how close they all come to perfection.\n",
        "\nWhat many consider the greatest Iron Maiden effort, Powerslave took the groundwork from its predecessor and engaged the songs through raw rhythms under tight leads. No loose ends go unattended here, and the way that something packed with many different subjects under what feels like one tale is remarkable. By that, I mean that the band jumps from songs about WWII artillery to ancient Egyptian folklore while emitting the exact same energy. At the end of the day, that's why I believe Bruce and co. were able to craft their first massive epic on the back end of this so smoothly. It drew the energy from everything else and applied it to an immaculate work of poetry.\n\nBut this lies more in the deep cuts. \"Aces High\" and \"2 Minutes To Midnight\" are fantastic tunes, but they're quite obviously written in a safer format. The instrumental \"Losfer Words\" replaces vocals with instrumental melody that's possibly catchier than a lot of the other tunes. The band displayed an ability to time the rhythmic breaks exceptionally, syncing the advanced drum work up with the hooky leads perfectly. Do I even need to mention the bass, and go on about how Steve Harris amps this up even more?\n\nMoreover, the contrasting factors of this disc are compelling. Looking at \"Back In The Village\" and the title track, the two are literal opposites. But they back eachother up in a way that makes the album continue the excellent flow. The former is crafted on fuming speed metal riffs, while the latter takes treachery to the next level by dumping on firm and menacing slower kicks. If those work together as one massive track, \"Rime Of The Ancient Mariner\" is like your sequel that smashes both ideas together and weaves in heftier leads.\n\nOddly enough though, my favorite track from Powerslave is one that almost nobody talks about. \"Flash Of The Blade\" is such a criminally overlooked tune. The backing vocals trading off with the lead vocals in the chorus are icing on what is already a perfect cake. Much like \"Revelations\" on the previous record, some of the best lyrical competency shines through on this. Every note on the guitar is also catchier than it has any business being. I chalk this up to the simpler nature of the song, while once again, giving off the same vibes as the other more complex ones. \"The Duellists\" was a smart follow up, as the writing is similar, but the solo dives far deeper into pool of progression.\n\nThe fifth Iron Maiden album deserves all the praise it gets. I easily put it at number two following its predecessor, and while I may like Piece Of Mind better, this one's an easier one to swallow. The flow is smooth, the execution is sharp, and the writing is spectacular. An obvious classic that's talked about so much that I'll be shocked if you even made it to the end of this.\n",
        "\nBelieve it or not, I\u2019ve gotten a fair amount of slack for selecting Piece Of Mind as my favorite Iron Maiden disc, despite it being the one that established that classic lineup and whatnot. It\u2019s also pretty famous for being the first album to truly reflect the band as a whole, doing away with any scraps of the foundation that was built by the band three years prior. Nah, they hadn\u2019t fallen into the pool of epic supergiants, nor was anything overly progressive yet. But everything else hit advanced levels that Iron Maiden had never truly replicated in a way that still felt fresh. The lyrical themes that the band would continue on with for basically the entire run was greatly amplified here as well.\n\nBut much like \u201cPhantom Of The Opera\u201d on the debut, \u201cRevelations\u201d smokes the living hell out of anything the band has written. Think about it; this captures the entire dynamic that made Bruce and co. so great in the first place. The guitar leads and soft rhythms in the bridge-breaks are some of the smoothest and soothing melodies ever written by anybody. The erupting heavier chugs that cake on Steve Harris\u2019s bass backing fold into the mix flawlessly, creating enough of a body before any vocals are even added. Now bring on Bruce\u2019s exceptional lyrics and poetic flow with clean clarity in delivery, and you\u2019ve got a God-tier track. But even after that, the slow build to the solo and heavy riffing that has an unmatchable sound gives even more character to this.\n\nHey, that\u2019s just one fucking song! While nothing else may match that, the rest of this cuts it apart and does something in common with it somewhere. Let\u2019s look at some of the ones that critics like to nail hard. \u201cSun And Steel\u201d or \u201cQuest For Fire,\u201d for example. Compared to the bulk, these are rather simplistic and maybe even silly. But the melody is strong, the rhythms are beefy, and they really fulfil most of what a classic metal song should need. The former uses gang harmony to its advantage for extra oomph. I compare these to the likes of \u201cFuture World\u201d by Helloween (which is funny, because nobody seems to slam that song). \n\nTo the same point and a different end of it, \u201cFlight Of Icarus\u201d hardly had a different approach, and that one\u2019s an obvious giant. So take this aspect of the album as you will. If nothing else, it adds variance. Not every song is going to be an anthem (which, if you\u2019ve ever written music, should be obvious). Returning to tunes with a harder grip on technicality are other classics, and the band was smart to open with \u201cWhere Eagles Dare.\u201d This song loads on so much energy not only with the sound effects and drawn-out riffing, but Nicko\u2019s drumming. Opening on that little pummel may have been ballsy, proving the man to be worthy. Similarly, \u201cDie With Your Boots On\u201d extracts the guitar structures and throws it on the forefront, containing banger solo after banger solo and endless riffs.\n\nYou may have noticed that Piece Of Mind feels front-loaded, since all of the technical advancements reside (mostly) on the A-side. It\u2019s as if after \u201cThe Trooper\u201d they decided to dial back some of the complexity. But to me, that makes for a more digestible progression. \u201cStill Life\u201d following it allows the harmony to ease its way in before hitting the outlier track that is \u201cQuest For Fire.\u201d The chorus there is a rather powerful one, and the drum-backing on the verses add so much life. What also tends to get overlooked is \u201cTo Tame A Land,\u201d the closer that actually returns to earlier form. The opening sequence of those dialed-back lead passages grow into a hefty bulk, and then slowly back down to close things out.\n\nI totally get why people would pick other Iron Maiden albums over this one. They\u2019ve achieved so much in such a massive period of time, but I think this was where all of the greatest aspects of said career came together on one disc. The second half of this gets unfairly overlooked. There may not be any \u201cRime Of The Ancient Mariner\u201d\u2019s on here, but equally as good ideas are dispersed all across the board.\n",
        "\nMore than anything, I view The Number Of The Beast as the proper follow-up to the debut, for no reason beyond it being a greater reflection of that album. It\u2019s a nice power-loaded disc that still heavily crafts itself on the NWOBHM influence while managing to hint at the future. And the truth is, this is the only Bruce-fronted album where I can picture Di\u2019anno singing the songs and it still sounding right. Songs like \u201cThe Prisoner\u201d and \u201cTotal Eclipse\u201d ring in that same early energy, following similar guidelines and attitudes to what other acts like Saxon had previously laid down.\n\nBut setting that aside, I think there\u2019s a mini-epic feel to a lot of this that showcased early signs of where Iron Maiden would go for future efforts. \u201cChildren Of The Damned\u201d will always be one of my favorites for this reason. The clean intro with loads of melody, molding into a steady bulk is all part of a build-up factor. The ending of this one is so explosive, peak eruption being the start of that tap-happy solo played in high octaves. \u201c22 Acacia Avenue\u201d is similar in its own unique way, as it delivers the same taste but by shifting attitudes from welcoming to threatening. These songs get overlooked thanks to the famous supergiants on this album, but they\u2019re easily some of the strongest.\n\nThe point of all of that is that they work as the perfect evolution of tracks like \u201cRemember Tomorrow\u201d or \u201cStrange World\u201d off of the debut. I\u2019m not saying these songs are better, but they\u2019re the perfect bridge between those early classics, and true epics like \u201cRime Of The Ancient Mariner.\u201d That said, the famous classic \u201cRun To The Hills\u201d rejects all of this, keeping things as straightforward as possible. This works to contrast others like my personal favorite \u201cHallowed Be Thy Name,\u201d which was the greatest push towards that sound that The Number Of The Beast would ever show. But I hardly think I need to go on about that.\n\nMy only complaint is the weak opening. \u201cInvaders\u201d is like the annoying younger brother of \u201cRun To The Hills,\u201d but you have to include him anyway. It\u2019s executed the same way, only reaching the blitzing speed right away rather injecting a slow intro. Worse things have happened, but I\u2019ve always felt this one rather hollow compared to everything on this album. This is a stellar record, though. Like Killers, it\u2019s an essential piece of the puzzle. But a bit of a personal opinion, I think Beast lives up to its hype a bit more.\n",
        "\nIt\u2019s not a good idea to judge the quality of an album based on how great the records surrounding it are, which is a fairly common problem that I encounter. That said, if everything else that a band does in an entire decade is easily superior, then it would make sense for it to fall lower on the ranks. What this doesn\u2019t mean, however, is that it\u2019s bad by any means, and Killers is one of my go-to examples of such a thing. The second Iron Maiden disc is a well-written, sweetly polished, and tight second-serving of riffs and licks from Steve Harris and co. But I do think that it lacks some attention to hooks and memorability.\n\nDon\u2019t think this means there aren\u2019t obvious bangers, which goes without saying for such a classic effort. \u201cWrathchild\u201d and \u201cMurders In The Rue Morgue\u201d will never not be earworms that are basic essentials to every fan of the style. However, I actually think \u201cAnother Life\u201d is a less obvious selling point. Much like the layering on the debut, this one creates surfaces smoother than stainless steel, especially when transitioning from the intro to the first blast of lyrics. The most superior track is probably the title track. Not only is it bouncy and swiftly executed, but the bridge\u2019s stellar combo of bass, rhythm, and drums is out of this world. Simple, but done exceptionally, and even more-so when the solo is placed overtop of it.\n\nBut the thing about Killers is that there aren\u2019t too many other tracks that I\u2019d consider strong deep cuts. \u201cGenghis Khan\u201d is a famous instrumental that I never found much magic in. The hooks are dulled down, and every time I listen to this one, I forget how it goes upon returning. The longer intro with acoustics on \u201cProdigal Son'' would have made a better instrumental alone, especially with bass presence grand enough to replace leads. In general, I\u2019d also say that a lot of this is moment driven, meaning there are banger parts that stick out but few songs that hold the weight for the entire duration. \u201cTwilight Zone\u201d is oddly rock \u2018n roll oriented, which seems out of place but is solid enough. And I do enjoy the falsettos in the chorus, something that Paul Di\u2019anno didn\u2019t tackle too often. Even \u201cPurgatory\u201d follows this example, where the \u201cplease take me away\u201d bridge is immaculate, but the rest of the song doesn\u2019t match that level.\n\nAs I\u2019ve said, this is a good album. It\u2019s an essential part of the genre\u2019s history, and it has more precision machining done than what I can say I expected the first time I ever heard it. But I think it\u2019s pretty top-loaded, and the last couple of songs don\u2019t hold the same value that the rest does. Take that as you will. I\u2019m glad that it does more for so many others than it might for me.\n",
        "\nJust so you know, \u201cPhantom Of The Opera\u201d alone rolls the entire Killers record up and smokes the hell out of it.\n\nHaha! No, seriously though, Iron Maiden is an obvious classic that sits right alongside Angel Witch in the same year as the pinnacle description of what NWOBHM was all about. It\u2019s easy to go on and on about this record. Whether it be the punchy and crunchy riffs of \u201cProwler,\u201d the aggressive front of the title track, or the beautiful intricacy of \u201cPhantom Of The Opera.\u201d But there is something almost magical about the debut that I just don\u2019t think was ever truly replicated, even by the band themselves the following year. Sure, Slayer and Overkill capitalized on it with Show No Mercy and Feel The Fire. But that\u2019s obvious evolution that still isn\u2019t quite the same. The fact is, it isn\u2019t about the rawness that everyone for some reason complains about, or the attitude that was repeated time and time again after 1980.\n\nInstead, the details lie in the fact that all of the rusty coating and straightforward punches were executed with immaculate layering. Looking at one of the more overlooked ones \u201cRemember Tomorrow,\u201d that song relies entirely on proper buildup, riff placement, and volume adjustment. That soft opening lick almost feels empty, even as Paul Di\u2019anno lays on sad sounding vocals. But then the main riff comes in and breathes all of the life into it, so that when the verses return, the cooler emotion feels more in-depth. \u201cPhantom Of The Opera\u201d is just a longer version of that, adding all of the tone-shifts and progressive pace-jumps that it\u2019s famous for. The vocal harmonies, the bouncy bridges, and the basslines all pop to the levels they do because of how they\u2019re placed, and this will forever be one of the greatest songs ever crafted in heavy metal.\n\nThis is not to say that songs like \u201cProwler\u201d or \u201cIron Maiden\u201d don\u2019t hold a flame. Those are the perfect bookending tunes that sandwich this powerhouse of a record together. Essentially acting as a backbone, they enclose the chaotic structure of this and don\u2019t allow anything to overflow. They\u2019re what likely leave the hardest impact to the newcomers. \u201cTransylvania\u201d dissolving into \u201cStrange World\u201d is another feature that flows so naturally despite the differences, that it brings Iron Maiden ahead of its time. Much like \u201cRemember Tomorrow,\u201d \u201cStrange World\u201d allows the somber feelings to capture you through a combo of unstructured melodies and straightforward softees. I\u2019d say that it executes that idea even better though.\n\nAll this really means is that the debut record mastered advanced songwriting without needing good production, real structure, or for these purposes, class. It\u2019s a pretty dank album in its own way. Steve Harris and co. wouldn\u2019t reach their truest potential for a few more albums, but out of the first couple, the debut had an ear for songwriting that the others just didn\u2019t. It\u2019s one of my favorite examples to bust out when proving that stellar songwriting outdoes mediocre production or cleanliness issues.\n",
        "\nAside the splendid concert movie and documentary Flight 666, Visions of the Beast is the only DVD released by British heavy metal veterans Iron Maiden which I own and consider worthy of attention. I prefer to listen to live records rather than watching lengthy concert films, so a DVD release needs to offer something special to make me consider purchasing it. This certainly is the case here.\n\nThe reasons are quite simple. This release offers value for money with two discs, forty-one clips and nearly four hours of entertainment. The music videos in chronological order help discover or revisit the band's career from first steps such as the short and energetic ''Wrathchild'' to more ambitious epics with progressive notes like ''Infinite Dreams'' and then from transitional and experimental efforts such as ''Virus'' to the band's current era as a sextet with ''Brave New World''. This release also includes some tracks that can't be found on regular studio albums such as the underrated Skyhooks cover ''Women in Uniform'', a live version of ''Afraid to Shoot Strangers'' featuring Blaze Bayley who does an absolutely splendid job and the short version of ''The Angel and the Gambler'' that is much more concise, energetic and memorable than the longer album version.\n\nThis release also has a few minor flaws. The music videos Iron Maiden has made are often poor efforts that consist of concert footage interwoven with some footage from a history channel as it's the case for ''The Trooper''. The new Camp Chaos versions of different songs are filler material as the space on the discs could have been used for more live footage or perhaps a look behind the scenes of different records and music videos.\n\nStill, anyone who wants to discover Iron Maiden as well as any true fan who desires to revisit the band's career in an entertaining way, should get her or his hands on this release. The cover artwork and slipcase rate this output up as it looks wonderful in any collection. Iron Maiden hasn't produced too many music videos in recent years anymore but I would certainly encourage and purchase a second part of this output covering the releases from the new version of the Run to the Hills single and the Dance of Death record onwards.\n",
        "\nLOG #1 - 10/02/2153\n\nI doubt anyone will ever listen to these audio logs, but in case this mission is my last, I need to leave behind a legacy. I am Space Captain Tanuki, and I was instructed to locate a legendary artifact crafted by the wisest forefathers of... 'heavy metal', whatever that is. HQ told me it wasn't actually made of metal, but plastic; a circular data retention device called an 'audio compact disc'. The given coordinates have led me to a derelict space station somewhere far from the sun. Supposedly the group responsible, going by the alias \"Iron Maiden\", were originally from Earth. Evidently their egos have distended their works to the furthest climes of our galaxy. I don't feel a great deal of optimism about all this, I must confess. Captain Tanuki, signing out.\n\nLOG #2 - 10/03/2153\n\nWell that didn't take long. I've come across something that fits the description: plastic square casing, sci-fi album art, yellow font... This has to be it, right? Judging by the thick, burnt-smelling dust coating this thing, I reckon no one's listened to it, or even discussed it in music forums, for many years. Very strange. I'm sure the mission debrief said this was one of the strongest offerings. I don't think I should listen to it. I don't even like holding it; something about it is giving me the creeps... Christ, one hour and sixteen minutes? Okay, I'm definitely not listening to it today. I need some time to think about this. Captain Tanuki, signing out.\n\nLOG #3 - 10/10/2153\n\nI shouldn't have listened to it. \n\nLOG #4 - 10/11/2153\n\nOkay, I've had some time to calm down and gather my thoughts, and I've determined the first four and a half minutes of 'Satellite 15... The Final Frontier' represents everything wrong with modern Maiden. The introductory passage of this song is longer than 'The Ides of March / Wrathchild' combined, and it accomplishes absolutely nothing. The maddeningly wasteful vortex of thrumming guitar feedback and quasi-tribal beats is mercifully interrupted by Bruce Dickinson belting out a series of mostly acapella verses that reek of self-indulgence. The higher notes aren't even hit cleanly, becoming adenoidal and fading into nothingness. When this song actually becomes a song, it abruptly morphs into rhythmic, moseying dad rock that's as vapid and predictable as X-Factor duds like 'Look for the Truth'.\n\nI hold 'The Talisman' in slightly higher esteem; it has some well-intentioned dual guitar leads to spice up certain movements, and I found the last guitar flourish in particular to be a laconic, aptly mystical way to close up shop. But let's read between the lines for a second. I'm complimenting Iron Maiden for their guitar harmonies, not because they're ambitious, or so zany and ingenious that no other band could ever think of them, but because they occasionally break up the mind-numbing, repetitive garbage that encompasses them. That, my friends, is what we call a back-handed complim-\n\nLOG #5 - 10/11/2153\n\nDamn, just realized my last log cut off because it was too long. God forbid I spend too long talking about this drivel, while these geezers help themselves to eight-plus minutes for their two-riff songs. Now I'm trying to remember what I said. Something about a lead in 'When the Wild Wind Blows' sounding exactly like the lead in 'Mother Russia', which is hilarious because that was from No Prayer for the Dying; widely considered Iron Maiden's first bad album for being too lo-fi and low brow. But when an identical melody is utilized here, it's considered another great progressive masterstroke.\n\nI'm in a really bad mood now. All that false intel. All those snide assholes back at HQ sending me on a mission to locate this boring piece of crap. They're probably all laughing at me back on Earth. Man... I feel... really sleepy all of a sudden. I think this place, or maybe this music, is getting to me. This space station feels colder and colder. I don't know if I can sleep tonight. Heh, I guess I'll just have to put on 'The Man Who Would Be King' to help me with that, now won't I? I swear this album has more wanky acoustics than Ashbury's Endless Skies. *Yawn*. At least that album was... friggin'... badass, though...\n\nLOG #15 - 10/32/2154\n\nWas I asleep? How long? Looks like my biometric scanner's broke. Date's wrong, and I think my lower pulse rate set my distress beacon off. I told HQ I didn't need it. Even if I got into trouble, no one would find me here. No one would click on an Iron Maiden review in this day and age. I just need to... just need to... go back to sleep. Let's listen to The Final Frontier again. That worked... that worked really good last time...\n\nLOG #1 - 13/33/2153\n\nDistress signals repeating? Thought I nailed them shut. Shut? Can't ignore it. I can hear them still? How odd. Need sleep. Good sleep. 'Coming Home' was good. Had its moments. Back to sleep.\n\nLOG #*\u00e5}\u00e6 - [!/n\u00e9/7\u03a6Gg\n\nRepeating? *Unintelligible* why repea...? So tired... can't... just wish... was... I was listening to... Somewhere in... Ssshh...\n",
        "\nIt's very rare for me to call an album overrated, as I'd like to think I'm pretty good at understanding why classics are appreciated so much. For example, even if Master of Puppets isn't even close to being my favourite thrash album of the 80s - or heck, even favourite Metallica album - I can still appreciate its place in history and understand why it could be hailed as a classic. After all, it's a thrash metal record that was appropriately able to break some mainstream ground, and it had fairly matured lyrics. The songs had an epic feel to them, and the variety was quite high for thrash. I may not find it to be a mindblowing masterpiece, but I can see why others would see it as so. In other words, I don't think it's overrated. \n\nSeventh Son, unfortunately, is one of those albums I would call overrated. It's currently the highest rated Maiden album on Rate your Music, and top 3 on this site. It's widely appreciated by both critics and fans, and is often regarded as their best album in its entirety, along with Powerslave and of course Number of the Beast. So dare me to be one of the few to not fallate this album? \n\nFirst of all, it's important to note that while the album clearly flows like a concept album, the band denies it as one. Which I'm glad they don't, because the Seventh Son theming is honestly a bit underwhelming. Aside from the title track and the Prophecy, the rest is mostly just Maiden doing what they do with different production rather than a truly immersive experience. Which leads me to the very first issue I have with the album: many people say that this is Maiden's most immersive album of the 80s, but almost half the songs here are clearly geared towards radio play. I'm not saying that catchy songs are a bad thing, but it does mean that compared to Powerslave or Somewhere in Time, this immersion can't even compare when a few of the tracks feel like they don't even belong in the same (nonexistent) story. \n\nYou could argue that they were looking for a sort of balance between the two, which is a fine argument. But that also leads me to the next point - those catchy songs themselves. Obviously the \"catchy songs\" can only be defined so objectively, so for now I'm going to single them out as \"Can I play with Madness,\" \"The Evil that Men Do,\" and \"Only the Good Die Young. \n\nImmediately the odd ball one here is Can I Play with Madness. It's not awful, but I won't lie: it sounds like the very thing that inspired No Prayer for the Dying, which is widely considered Bruce's worst Maiden album. The vocal style, poppy melody, guitar riff, everything. It doesn't help that they kind of just forgot to write an outro for the song, as it just sort of ends with a very out-of-place return to the intro. Again, not a bad song. Just a little weird and leaves on an unnecessary cliffhanger \n\nAs for the other two songs: They're good, but do they really compare to the other album's top catchy songs? Do they compare to the self titled (Running Free, Iron Maiden), Killers (Wrathchild, Killers,), NotB (Run to the Hills, Number of the Beast), Piece of Mind (Flight of Icarus, The Trooper), Powerslave (Aces High, Flash of the Blade), or Somewhere in Time (Wasted Years, Sea of Madness)? Do they really? Maybe for some of them, sure, but I fail to see how they could best ALL of them. \n\nThen there's the rest of the album. Aside from the obvious outlier of the title track - which is phenomenal and well deserving of its praise - what else does the rest of the album accomplish? Moonchild is a decent intro, but does not particularly have as many impressive performances or hooks as their other openers, Infinite Dreams sounds almost derivative of their other soft songs (Remember Tomorrow, Prodigal Son, Children of the Damned, Revelations, etc) without adding much new or exciting, the Prodigy feels like it literally only exists to add more atmosphere and nothing else, and the Clairvoyant - while a good song, sounds a bit like a poor man's Heaven Can Wait. \n\nSomewhere in Time is hailed by hardcore Maiden fans for having some of the greatest guitar work of all time, but it also still had a very cohesive atmosphere and flow much like Seventh Son did. Number of the Beast has their catchiest and most iconic choruses. Powerslave was their most adventurous 80s album. Seventh Son tried combining all four of these things into one, and while from a technical it hit the spot, it resulted in underwhelming songwriting. I guess if you don't care for the actual quality of the songs themselves but rather what they bring to an album in its entirety, you could make a case for it being their best. But even then, it's not as catchy as NotB, it's not as adventurous as Powerslave, and aside from the title track, it certainly is not as instrumentally compelling as SiT.\n\nBut hey, if it's your favourite Maiden album, you do you. Even if I don't understand it's appeal, I'm not going to stop others from enjoying it. And It's still a good album, don't get me wrong. But I do hope that someone can eventually shed me light as to why this is somehow even close to their best stuff. In the meantime, I'm gonna put Somewhere in Time back on.\n\nFavourite tracks: Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, The Evil that Men Do, Only the Good Die Young, the Clairvoyant\n\nLeast favourite track: The Prophecy\n",
        "\nMaiden bravely weather the 90\u2019s storm? Steve Harris expands on his vision whilst not bothering to expand his musical vocabulary? Maiden fail miserably without Bruce on an album/era that\u2019s not worth revisiting? Is it simply three good songs (front-loaded, too) and then a bunch of miserable, tortuous drivel? Whatever the case may be, I tend to think of this one as the most interesting post-classic Maiden album and certainly the one that tend to spin the most, even if this is more out of curiosity rather than wholehearted enjoyment. It seems that this somewhat glum, soul-searching album holds much more interest than the \u201call-together-warm-safe-coziness\u201d of the reunion era and certainly outstrips the abominable, reheated chorus-onslaught of Virtual XI as far as quality goes.\n\nOverall, I tend to view this album as well-meaning, if flawed, but that well-meaning nature usually wins me over in the end. If I think of Maiden in terms of food analogies; their 80\u2019s output was a vast array of culinary delights in varied flavours and style, each memorable and delicious, No Prayer for the Dying was an overcooked and stodgy English breakfast that didn\u2019t quite sit well after the meal\u2019s completion (a solid 6/10 \u2013 the bacon was at least right), Fear of the Dark was a greasy and oversized fast food meal, complete with excess grease and a chef whose heart definitely wasn\u2019t in it (even if his salvia was). The X Factor, then, is a home cooked meal, prepared by a divorced dad; he\u2019s not necessarily a good cook \u2013 the wife always took care of that \u2013 and the table conservation goes on awkwardly for eons but he\u2019s at least trying. \n\nBefore we get to the most striking change, I do find it interesting that this album takes the band down to a more workmanlike level, an everyman appeal that perhaps taps into something noticeably more 90s. It\u2019s the shift from the more grandiose themes of the Dickinson era \u2013 time travel and high-flying science fiction are evidently missing from The X Factor\u2019s lyrical repertoire \u2013 to more earthy, corporeal approach. Interestingly, I always felt that Steve Harris\u2019 reading material never strayed too far from the English secondary school curriculum (one can imagine him being a solid B student, engaged and interested in lessons\u2026 but all too keen to escape and play football as soon as the bell went [no extra reading for Steve]). You get Lord of the Flies, Heart of Darkness via the way of Apocalypse Now and definite references to some of the First World War poets. Clearly, Dickinson took his private school Crowley-isms and more astute references to Blake with him, leaving Steve and the boys to their less lofty inspirations. Hell, I can just imagine Steve Harris\u2019s writing process for this record \u2013 a divorced and shaken 30-something sits alone at home surrounded by over-due VHS and well-thumbed copies of some books he\u2019d read when he was back at school. Compared to some of the more cinematic stuff on, say, A Matter of Life and Death and Dance of Death, a lot of the songs here tend to be first person narratives of men who\u2019d fallen on hard times and I imagine Steve Harris was feeling a great deal of empathy with them. Of course, with those aside, this feels like the most personal Iron Maiden album. \u2018Look for the Truth\u2019 and \u2018Judgement of Heaven\u2019 both share a confessional tone and \u2018Look for the Truth\u2019 is a pretty successful romp based around some Wishbone Ash-inspired writing (\u2018Look for the Truth\u2019 outright rips off \u2018Warrior\u2019 from the 1972 classic, Argus\u2026 which the band had previously borrowed from on \u2018Revelations\u2019 and would further borrow from on the album\u2019s subsequent track, \u2018The Aftermath\u2019, fuck\u2019s sake). \u2018Judgement of Heaven\u2019 strikes me as weird and significantly less successful, it seems to be a sort of confession of Christian thought and almost seems as if suicide is to be avoided not just because of it being an \u2018easy way\u2019 but also due to the fact that you\u2019d be damned to hell. \n\nAnother slighter shift here is Steve Harris manning the production himself. Whilst Martin Birch is credited as producing Fear of the Dark with Steve co-producing, it seems to me like it mostly Harris given that album\u2019s somewhat unappealing slickness. The X Factor is an improvement in terms of moving away from that greasy, smooth sound, but its production is hardly first rate. The instruments are separated in a garage-y, manner and none of the individual instruments sound particularly exciting. It\u2019s fairly raw \u2013 well, in comparison to Fear of the Dark or Somewhere in Time, but I hesitate to call it \u2018live\u2019 sounding as Maiden have always sounded much more exciting than this in the live arena. You can almost hear the band saying \u201cWell, we\u2019re going to be playing smaller venues on this tour, so we won\u2019t be spending money on a big-name producer\u2026 and has anyone got My Dying Bride\u2019s phone number?\u201d. In short, it hardly seems like a fitting production job for one of the biggest metal bands in the world, even at the height of a significant downturn in the metal economy. \n\nSimilarly, not quite appropriate for a metal band of this stature is Blaze Bayley\u2019s ability to cut it as a Maiden singer. Whilst Harris never wrote too many great melodies post-\u201888, Blaze does have a pleasing character to his voice and obviously he fits the band\u2019s sound. The problem, then, lies with the fact that he is sometimes a bit pitchy and stiff. There\u2019s a quite pleasing moment at the end of \u2018Judgement of Heaven\u2019 wherein he gets to cut loose a little and \u2018The Unbeliever\u2019 has some vocal fire, but elsewhere he\u2019s often too rigid and it\u2019s almost as if he\u2019s looking over to Steve in the control room whilst he\u2019s singing to ensure that he got everything exactly the way it has been dictated to him. This, combined with the fact that these vocal melodies often a little trite \u2013 too many \u201cwhoa, oohh, ohhhs!\u201d and vocal melodies that seem too constrained. I often think that Maiden tend to undercook some of their vocal lines, just so that they retain the interest of that Maiden superfan in Argentina who, despite speaking four words of English, can sing along with the entire Maiden back catalogue. Maybe Harris thought he was still working with a world-class vocalist who could really sell these choruses? At any rate, it certainly was something that the band didn\u2019t improve on after this album, but The X Factor could have been a significantly better album, not with Bruce Dickinson or a clone on vocals, but with a little more time spent developing and expanding vocal lines to fit Blaze\u2019s strengths. \n\nAnd yet, despite my criticisms, there are some appealing moments here. The first three tracks all don\u2019t fall into the pitfalls of Harris\u2019s limited writing style and are quite a bold move for the band. Firstly, I love the fact that \u2018The Sign of the Cross\u2019 introduces a new singer in the most low-key manner possible. Blaze seems to introduce himself in solemn, crooning tones that echo the song\u2019s monastic themes very well. It\u2019s a highly atmospheric piece that builds towards a confident and rousing conclusion. \u2018The Lord of the Flies\u2019 and \u2018Man on the Edge\u2019 both highlight Gers\u2019 strength as a writer and prove that the band could play in a darker style whilst retaining their energy. I listened to all three in a graveyard recently and they fit the mood very nicely. \n\nWith this surprisingly confident start to the record, then, it\u2019s always frustrating that its next two thirds are largely full of plodding and tortuous material. \u2018Fortunes of War\u2019 is not without its charm, but it\u2019s the band embracing a formula that they would mercilessly drill into your forehead for the next twenty-five years. Steve Harris clearly likes his bass to be heard loudly as demonstrated by \u2018Blood on the World\u2019s Hands\u2019 awful, acoustic bass solo (!!) intro. And, as previously mentioned, the band manage to shamelessly rip off Wishbone Ash in not one but two songs that are right next to each other. \u20182 AM\u2019 is about as interesting as its lyrical themes; with any serious thought it would have been left off the album and the band\u2019s lack of chordal and melodic variation really hammers home how bare-bones and dull this song is. \n\nEssentially, with The X Factor you get the feeling that the band could have made a more successful album if they had edited the fucking record, shown a bit more restraint in some areas and more inventiveness in others. It\u2019s a sort of interesting quasi-failure that could have been so much. Maiden embrace a darker style and ditch the inauthentic Dickinson-goes-AC/DC style of the previous album? I would have certainly been keen on that. But what with a lack of main writers with the clout to carry this band and one main writer who just does not know when to edit himself, it was doomed to being a murky mire of tired ideas and tedious structures. It\u2019s definitely interesting, but it doesn\u2019t often get played more than twice a year. I think the record is enjoying something of a renaissance in some quarters and I\u2019d be willing to wager that if you go into any JD Wetherspoon on the night of a Maiden gig in your city a couple of Eddie-aficionados might name this as one of their favourites (be wary, however, if they also frequent British Lion gigs and appear to worship absolutely fucking everything Maiden put out).\n",
        "\nIt befits the nature of this review for me to start off by saying that \u2018The Wicker Man\u2019 is the most common Iron Maiden song for me to be singing at any given moment. I really love the way the band build up steam in the verses and let it all go through the fairly careful solo section, plus that amazing folky melody. On the flipside though, the chorus is too repetitive and the instrumental tones a bit clunky. Give me a live version of \u2018The Wicker Man\u2019 and it\u2019s among my favourites from these long-standing Brits. However, I have rather mixed feelings about Brave New World generally.\n\nI\u2019ve been listening to this first offering from the revamped sextet line-up for over a decade now, and I can\u2019t shake the feeling that it sounds the most doddery of all Iron Maiden\u2019s releases. Call it what you like - Kevin Shirley's live and scratchy production job, three guitarists trying to gel with a domineering bassist, the giddy joy of being reunited - but the album sounds like the product of old men. Unlike later efforts like The Final Frontier, it doesn\u2019t sound like the product of confused old men, though the way the pieces of the album were assembled doesn\u2019t show the songwriting in its best light. Focus in on this summary. Songwriting: pretty good. Sound: pretty bad. Sort of like Pagan Altar wrote an album, left the lead guitar as a blank sheet, and then sent the ideas to Steve Harris on the back of a three-wheeled delivery truck. Which is where Harris recorded it, by the sounds of things.\n\nA mitigating factor for Brave New World survives in the way that the elderly sound and themes at least made Iron Maiden seem like nice blokes. Something truly hopeful spills out of \u2018Blood Brothers\u2019 and \u2018Out of the Silent Planet\u2019 that appeals on the grounds of producing basic happiness, which is arguably the reason why metalheads are listening to Iron Maiden in the 21st century. Except for a couple of obvious attempts to write quicker material, Brave New World is a massively slow album, ushering in the annoying habit of writing a clean introduction for every epic and giving Nicko McBrain time to take a sip from his pint between each snare strike. Very few moments of anger or heaviness slip through the genial relaxation on display. Even the guitar solos, which often reach the greatest peak of intensity on Iron Maiden songs, fluctuate between inspiring and pleasant.\n\nI\u2019ve criticized Maiden in the past for exactly this kind of looseness and lack of focus on trimming songs down to their vital parts (especially on the more recent albums), but I feel it works out alright here. The nine minutes of \u2018Dream of Mirrors\u2019 does indeed take most of the morning to listen to, yet I feel comfortable locked inside that velvet-padded cell, Bruce Dickinson crooning out mild philosophies for a while before things pick up into epic gear, after which we surprisingly shoot into double time and McBrain shows us why it wasn\u2019t a good idea to keep him on the snare before, because it sounds horrible. You\u2019ll note that it\u2019s a mixed experience, though one that\u2019s largely met by positive emotions.\n\nI know that I\u2019ve mostly bitten my tongue about the style Iron Maiden chose coming into the new millennium. I\u2019m not a big fan of all the epics and filler sections that clutter up certain songs, most obvious on Brave New World from the three long songs that finish the album. If I had a magic wand, I would crop out either \u2018The Thin Line Between Love and Hate\u2019 or the title track, the latter largely because it suffers worst from repetitive chorus syndrome, a disease that plagued the Londoners back in 2000. Despite not quite being my singalong preference, \u2018The Fallen Angel\u2019 manages to solve all those complaints with a simpler approach, while the two longest songs (\u2018The Nomad\u2019 and \u2018Dream of Mirrors\u2019) possess intelligent structuring and strong choruses, leaving me feeling pretty good about both. Overall, you\u2019ll never convince me that latter day Iron Maiden is anything special, but I\u2019ll agree that Brave New World is a fairly enjoyable album.\n",
        "\nThere's no better indicator of how Iron Maiden grew as a band than by looking at Eddie. Eddie would eventually become a pharaoh, a puppeteer of Satan, and some sort of cyborg bounty hunter, but on Maiden's debut, he's some scraggly looking ruffian who looks like he'd approach you on the street with his dick out. And what do you know, there's a song about that on here.\n\nThis is Iron Maiden at their rawest and most primitive, with generally simpler songs than they would become known for in the future. Nonetheless, a few songs still contain the seeds of Maiden's proggier, more epic side that would fully come to fruition once Bruce Dickinson joined. But as its own entity, this album is still fantastic. The songwriting is on a level that so many of their NWOBHM contemporaries never came close to, thanks to the ambition and skill of Steve Harris. The guy just knew how to make a melody stick in your head. Take the title track, for example. It's bursting with the kind of energy and flashiness that makes this album a little different than most metal that came before it. The chorus somehow manages to be upbeat and catchy will still haing all the cuddliness of a porcupine covered in hypodermic needles. Dave Murray and Dennis Stratton make one hell of a guitar duo here. Even on their first album, it's apparent that guitar harmonies are an integral part of their sound. They elevate \"Running Free\" above being just a fun, simple metal anthem into something with a bit more pizazz and individuality. Which brings me to my next point: the clues of what was to come.\n\nEven this early on, you could tell that Harris wanted to expand his horizons into more complex songwriting. And thus, we ended up with \"Phantom Of The Opera.\" The whole song plays out like an opera, with dramatic swells and riff changes to match. The longer songs never overstay their welcome or seem self indulgent, and it seems like something a lot of NWOBHM simply weren't doing. Another great track that is different than your typical Iron Maiden song is \"Strange World,\" which tries out a more psychedelic sound that never really took hold in their later work. It's mostly an excuse for Murray to show off his soloing prowess, but I'm not complaining.\n\nAnd although some of these songs aren't as grandiose or ambitious as Maiden's later work, they're no less compelling or powerful. Paul Di'Anno's voice is very well suited to the gruffer style of music. He could never pull off the songs that Dickinson does, but Dickinson can never do Di'Anno's songs justice. He can also do a pretty solid croon when he has to, such as on the quasi-ballad \"Remember Tomorrow.\" Harris was already making the bass into one of the primary elements of Maiden's sound. His style is as melodic as ever, cutting through the grittiness of the guitars.\n\nThe band themselves has stated their dissatisfaction with the production, but I actually think it works well. The bass has an almost piano-like ring that provides an excellent foundation for the rest of the band, and Murray and Stratton's guitars have all the necessary beefiness to power the riffs.\n\nIt's pretty rare that a band starts off this good. Although it may not be the most quintessential Iron Maiden album, it's probably one of the best.\n",
        "\nIn my journey through the Iron Maiden albums I knew one thing. I knew that Iron Maiden could never make a truly bad record. As I am going through their discography I have found Maiden to be pretty overrated, but I always understood why they're regarded as the best heavy metal bands of all time. I have come to the conclusion that they are not my cup of tea. With saying all that, I don't even think die hard fans would like this album as much. I'm not saying \"No Prayer for the Dying\" sucks, but it's obviously not the same standard as the last seven albums. I mean, you have to think about it. Iron Maiden put out seven albums before this. They're not all going to be winners. In my opinion, they dropped off a bit after \"The Number of the Beast\" only to pick back up in \"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\". Maybe I shouldn't have assumed that Iron Maiden found their perfect sound on their eighth album, but I did have somewhat higher hopes for this one. However, the final product was a huge step back. \n\nListening to this with 2019 ears, all I can think about is how dated this album sounds. I always defended the previous Maiden entries by saying that you can listen to any of them now and still be blown away by the musicianship. On \"No Prayer for the Dying\", it really sounds like it came from 1990. The production value doesn't have that pop like previous albums. Everything sounds so watered down. It's a shame because the talent from these guys is obviously high. On this release, Dickinson sounds tired and the solos are a mess in certain songs. In the title track, \"No Prayer for the Dying\", the solo honestly sounds random. Dave Murray and Janick Gers are great musicians, but the guitar work on this song is painful to listen to. When the solo does come on, it sounds like it was added in post and took five minutes. It reminds me of a \"I can make this random series of strings sound fast and good\". A lot of the solos on this release feel like they were meant for speed when the vocals are slowed down.\n\nMost, if not all, of the songs are played at a pretty slow pace for Maiden. I was actually kind of taken back by their simplicity. It's kind of the reason why I gave this release the score that I did. My past complaints were that Dickinson desperately tried to keep up while the rest of the guys played at a fast pace. On \"No Prayer for the Dying\", I feel like the guys had to slow down for Dickinson's singing. It's probably not the case at all, but that's what it sounds like to me. The mediocrity on the album is astounding and that doesn't only go for the instrumentals.\n\nThe lyrics on this album are just plain bad. The worst case of this is the song \"The Assassin\". The lyrics to the chorus on this album are\n\n\"Better watch out, cos I'm the Assassin\nBetter watch out, Better watch out\nAssassin\"\n\nHonestly, this is insulting. Iron Maiden has shown that they can write really good songs if they wanted to. Eight albums in and they write this kind of garbage. It feels like a high schooler scribbled that on some paper while he was bored in class. For Christ sakes, a song is called \"Public Enema Number One\". It doesn't sound like it, but even that song has some better writing than this. Don't get me wrong, it's not all bad. \"Run Silent Run Deep\", \"Mother Russia\", and \"Tailgunner\" are good examples of lyricism on here. The rest is hard to read. \n\nOverall, it's not a super shitty Iron Maiden album. I know that Maiden is not capable of writing complete trash. This is just almost straight down the middle for me compared to the others. On the other hand I know that this is Maiden's eighth album, so I can't judge it too harshly. It's completely decent for what it is and I know people will really like the slowed down instrumentals and Dickinson's raspy singing. Coming from a casual Maiden listener however, I'm still pretty let down by this. \n\nRecommended songs: \"Holy Smoke\", \"Hooks in You\" and \"Mother Russia\"\n",
        "\nI almost gave up on Iron Maiden because the last few releases have been surprisingly mediocre for me. I started to question my musical taste and wondered if it's just me that feels like Iron Maiden is a bit overrated. \"Piece of Mind\", \"Powerslave\" and \"Somewhere in Time\" did absolutely nothing for me. I'd see these amazing reviews for those albums and felt like maybe \"The Number of the Beast\" was just a great album by an over-hyped band. I then sat down today and listened to \"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\" and my mind changed. This is the Iron Maiden I enjoy. \n\nMy favorite thing about \"SSoSS\" is that it slows things down a bit. I know I praised \"The Number of the Beast\" because of its speed, but it really worked for that record. That album is about devil worship and the music and singing by Dickinson go hand in hand. He does so well with keeping up with the music. Then you have other releases where he sounds like he's struggling. On \"SSoSS\" the instrumentals are slowed down letting Dickinson sound more natural. Even on the quicker songs the lyrics are trimmed down a bit. The not-so-bloated lyrics lead to a way better listening experience. I feel that way because this album is their shortest since \"The Number of the Beast\". \n\nThis album is only 44 minutes long, compared to \"Somewhere in Time\" being 51 minutes. Those seven minutes may not seem like a huge difference, but believe me, it is. The last couple albums, especially \"Somewhere in Time\" had me looking at how much time there was left on some songs. I don't want to do that while listening to an album, let alone reviewing it. I don't want to be bored while listening to the biggest heavy metal band of all time. These last few releases completely lost me in that aspect. \"SSoSS\" only had me do that once and that was on the title track. I mean, it's a ten minute long song. I get why I felt bored, but the song should not be ten minutes long. That's the only time I was really trudging through. The rest of the album is definitely decent with the song lengths. \n\nNot only are the song lengths improved, but the general song writing is as well. As I said before, Maiden loves to write bloated lyrics that just repeat themselves. They have a nasty habit of telling a story and ending it half way through the song. The last half would be dedicated to solos and repeated choruses. \"SSoSS\" almost entirely improves on that. They do repeat choruses, but man are they written well. I think my favorite instance of such is on the song \"Can I Play With Madness?\" where Dickinson repeats,\n\n\"Can I play with madness? The prophet stared at his crystal ball\nCan I play with madness? There's no vision there at all\nCan I play with madness? The prophet looked and he laughed at me\nCan I play with madness? He said you're blind too blind to see\"\n\nI'm not sure why I prefer the repetition on this album than on past releases. I think the lyrics are more fun and the subject matter is appropriate for how the instrumentals are being played. This is especially true on the song \"Infinite Dreams\". It is my favorite song on this album. The reason for that is how Dickinson sings with the instrumentals. I found it very refreshing and honestly think this song sticks out more than 90% of songs on the past three releases. Generally speaking, the riffs on \"SSoSS\" are simple, yet extremely effective. \"The Prophecy\" has some of my favorite examples of this. No Maiden song is boring instrumentally. These guys continue to kick so much ass and are so talented. It's really a treat to listen to what they come up with. \n\nA lot of things stuck out on \"SSoSS\". That ranges from Steve Harris' bass and the weird synth guitars they introduced on the last album. I think that works better here than it did on \"Somewhere In Time\". The one thing I wish didn't stick out was the lack of rhyming. Maybe this is a nitpick, but while reviewing the album I am fully paying attention to the lyrics. When listening to a heavy metal album, I enjoy that over the top rhyming. It makes the songs sound catchy and memorable. I struggle with this on every release of theirs. Maybe it's not just a Maiden thing, but it sticks out to me. If you don't know what I'm talking about, here is an example.\n\n\"Suffering and pain impending disaster\nSouls crying the devil's laughter\nHeard the cry of the seven whistlers\nLucifer smiles looks on and waits\"\n\nSo, in the first two verses, the last words are \"disaster\" and \"laughter\". It almost sounds like a rhyme, but flows fine with each other. Then the next two verses end with \"whistlers\" and \"waits\". It's in the same group of lyrics and just bothers me that the last two verses don't somewhat rhyme. Yeah, yeah, it's a nitpick, but I honestly can't stand it. It takes me out of the album.\n\nIron Maiden was on a steady decline from \"The Number of the Beast\". Their first two albums were gaining some momentum, they peaked with \"Beast\", and then started going down hill. I questioned myself a lot while writing those reviews. I know that sounds over dramatic, but it's true. After listening to \"SSoSS\", I feel like a little bit of faith for Maiden has been restored. I feel that there might be more albums of theirs I'll enjoy as much as this. I doubt they'll write another \"The Number of the Beast\", but I'm still trying to keep an open mind. This is definitely a step in the right direction and helps me understand why people call Iron Maiden one of the best heavy metal bands of all time.\n\nRecommended songs: \"Infinite Dreams\", \"Can I Play With Madness?\", \"The Prophecy\", and \"The Clairvoyant\"\n",
        "\nIron Maiden is known to be one of the best metal bands of all time. Without me even listening to their entire discography, I would tell people that. Call me a band wagoner or a poser, but I kind of just assumed Iron Maiden had this amazing disco that no band could even touch. I mean, they have been around for such a long time and so many different people have favorite songs and albums. It wasn't until I sat down and actually listened to Iron Maiden that I knew how wrong I was. I have been reviewing all of Maiden's albums and I see review after review that each album is a masterpiece in it's own right. Besides \"The Number of the Beast\", I haven't found that masterpiece. I'm on Maiden's sixth album and only one of them is worth remembering. \"Somewhere In Time\" seems to be the worst out of the bunch.\n\nFor a while, Maiden seemed to be on the upswing. Their first two albums seemed like Maiden was working out the kinks. They wrote the almost perfect \"The Number of the Beast\" and things started going down hill. Iron Maiden started having a certain style of mediocrity. Each album sounds almost exactly the same and I feel that \"Somewhere In Time\" is a \"best-of\" of that mediocrity. I sit down and read each lyric for each review I do to fully encapsulate myself in the album. This is the first album where I started skipping the last one-two minutes of each song because it's so damn repetitive. Each song on this album follows the same routine. Maiden lays out a series of lyrics, there is a chorus, another series of lyrics, a chorus, a solo, and then the chorus repeated three-five times. It's unbelievable how repetitious this \"legendary\" album is. I could forgive it if the songs popped or had something unique to them. Usually the solos would be a nice break from the constant galloping riffs, but none of the solos stuck out for me.\n\nI'm not saying the musicianship is bad here. I don't think I could say that and be taken seriously. I'm saying that this album is not the usual recipe for a good Iron Maiden record. On past releases I can kind of forgive the repetition of the songs because the guitar solos or the bass really stuck out. On this record, the bass and drumming stick out, but maybe not enough. I can hear the great bass by Steve Harris and the always insane drumming by Nicko McBrain, but it doesn't do enough to pop. I feel like the sound quality is kind of watered down here somehow. I just can't quite put my finger on why that is. It just sounds a bit different than past releases. With how long each song is, that sound quality stuck out like a sore thumb. The shortest song on here is around five minutes. I feel like Maiden wants these epic and long songs, but when you mix repetition in there they get boring quick.\n\nSomething that hasn't changed is the way Dickinson sings. Ask me a few years back and I would tell you that Bruce Dickinson is the reason why I remember Iron Maiden. He is a fantastic singer, but the lyrics do not match the singing. For the last couple releases, I feel that he is constantly trying to catch up to the rest of the band. He has high pitched singing when there shouldn't be. On the song \"Deja-Vu\", the lyrics are,\n\n\"Ever had a conversation\nThat you realize you've had before\nIsn't it strange\n\nHave you ever talked to someone\nAnd you feel you know what's coming next\nIt feels pre-arranged\"\n\nOn each last line he goes high pitched when on the previous two sentences he sings normally. It is probably a nitpick, but it just doesn't sound right. He can't even properly pronounce words. While higher-pitched, he must rush through the words to keep up pace. On \"Heaven Can Wait\" he just repeats\n\n\"Heaven can wait, heaven can wait\nHeaven can wait, heaven can wait till another day\nHeaven can wait, heaven can wait\nHeaven can wait, heaven can wait till another day\"\n\nover and over again. It sounds so whiny and I kind of hate it. Bruce is easily one of the best singers in metal, but I now remember him for a different reason. I now remember him for constantly trying to catch up to the rest of the band with super fast, high-pitched, lyrics. It's a mess. The only songs I truly liked on here were \"Wasted Years\" and \"Alexander the Great\". I feel like both songs offer premium Dickinson and are just overall great. \"Alexander the Great\" is probably the most fun I had on here. I am a sucker for these super long, story-driven songs. However, on each album that list of songs that I enjoy is getting lower and lower.\n\nEven after writing this review, I still don't get it. I feel terrible giving such a low score to an otherwise praised album. Am I missing something here? Is there something I am not paying attention to? I see people calling this album a masterpiece and how Iron Maiden does no wrong. I get that everyone has the right to love and dislike anything they want and I'm not bashing anyone. I just want to know what makes this album so special? I'm not going to completely take a dump on this record because even bad Maiden is still not trash, but \"Somewhere in Time\" is definitely my least favorite record in their discography so far. \n\nRecommended songs: \"Caught Somewhere in Time\", \"Wasted Years\", and \"Alexander the Great\"\n",
        "\nI'm starting to see a trend in this Maiden albums as I am writing these reviews. It appears that I like Iron Maiden a lot less than I thought I did. I originally went out to listen to all these classic Maiden albums mainly because they are regarded as one of the best heavy metal bands of all time. I legitimately thought I was missing something before. \"How do I not know many of their albums or songs?\" was what I kept asking myself that lead me to write these reviews in the first place. So far, the only thing that impressed me to all hell was \"The Number of the Beast\". That album is the closest thing I'll get to perfection when it comes to Maiden I'm assuming. I always heard that \"Powerslave\" was better than \"Piece of Mind\" because they cut down on the annoying filler, but in \"Powerslave\" they went one step forward and two steps back. \n\nI actually had super high hopes listening to this. The first four songs are absolute bangers. \"Aces High\" and \"2 Minutes to Midnight\" are the absolute best songs on this album. Their catchy lyrics are matched by the amazing musicianship of the rest of the band. Bruce Dickinson sounds unbelievable on these two tracks. These songs are always on Iron Maiden's best list and I can see why. I honestly thought going forward would be even better because I'm basically unfamiliar with the rest of the album. \"Losfer Words (Big 'Orra)\" is a fantastic instrumental song that really showcases that after five albums, the band has not lost its touch at all. In fact, it's really the greatest thing Maiden has going for them. Finally, \"Flash of the Blade\" comes on and I have to say, I really loved this song. The chorus is fantastic and will definitely be in my head for the rest of the week. I think what really works in this song is that Dickinson's voice is utilized perfectly here. The lyrics don't go too quick (like the rest of the album) and it is very unique compared to the first three songs. Long story short, it's just a super fun song to listen to. Unfortunately, this is where my excitement dropped off.\n\nI understand that there is one more song on the A side, which is \"The Duellists\", but I find it easier to separate this album half and half. You see, \"The Duellists\" starts a trend in this album where Dickinson becomes extremely fucking annoying. It pains me to say this because I consider him one of the best vocalists in metal. I'm not sure what it is, but I feel like on every song after \"Flash of the Blade\" contains this super whiny, high-pitched, singing that I couldn't stand at all. On \"The Duellists\" it's tolerable, but it's even worse on \"Back in the Village\" That chorus is so cringey and high-pitched that I needed to take a break from listening to this thing. The chorus is unlike any other part of the album in which it's just flat out bad. The repeated lines, \n\n\"Back in the village\nAgain in the village\nI\u2019m back in the village again, yeah\"\n\nis now burned into my head for the wrong reasons. This very much could be the worst Maiden song I have ever listened to. Fortunately, all is not lost because you have the rest of the band banging it out like they do on every album. The lyrics and vocals just sound terrible on here. Things start to get a bit better from here though. The title track, \"Powerslave\" comes on and I was a bit disappointed. While the song sounds unique and fresh compared to the rest of the album, there is something else to be desired. Maybe it is the fact that it's over seven minutes long, and I grew tired quickly. The chorus is sung wonderfully and the instrumentals have this super fun Egyptian theme going. The galloping guitars actually work on here. That brings me to the final song, \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\" and boy is this a long ass song. Clocking in at over thirteen minutes, this is a behemoth of a tune. It has a very awesome sounding story at the price of pure boredom. There is a three minute break where the song comes to a crawl because there is some spoken word stuff. I wouldn't have minded this tune normally. I love when Maiden tells a cohesive metal story, but this is just way too long. \n\nOverall, this album is a disappointment if I am being honest. After the first four songs, it goes down hill fast. On the second half of \"Powerslave\" it just sounds like Dickinson is hitting TOO high of notes for the songs and desperately trying to keep up with the fast paced instrumentals. He is a great singer and the rest of the band are fantastic at what they do, so this seems like it should be an immaculate album. Unfortunately it suffers from very poor song writing and questionable vocal ranges. It is better than the filler album, \"Piece of Mind\", but that's honestly not saying much. \n\nRecommended songs: \"Aces High\", \"2 Minutes to Midnight\", \"Losfer Words (Big 'Orra)\", and \"Flash of the Blade\"\n",
        "\nSince writing my reviews for Iron Maiden, I have now listened to them go up and down like a roller coaster. On \"Iron Maiden\", the instrumentals were phenomenal, but the lyrics were dated. On \"Killers\" there was a lot of filler, but the repetitiveness of the lyrics improved. On \"The Number of the Beast\", Maiden improved on everything and put out probably the best heavy metal album of all time. On \"Piece of Mind\", they put out \"The Trooper\". When looking back to this album, \"The Trooper\" will probably be the only song I truly remember.\n\nNow, I knew Maiden was not going to top \"The Number of the Beast\". That album is damn near perfect in my eyes. My past with \"Piece of Mind\" is basically the song, \"The Trooper\". It's been played to death, I know the lyrics, but that's pretty much it for the album really. I have listened to it in its entirety before, but nothing ever stuck out to me. I was hoping revisiting this album would change that. In my review for \"Iron Maiden\" I said I preferred this album to that one. I unfortunately can't agree with that any longer. \n\nThis album was sort of a chore to listen to. It started off well enough with one of the better songs on the album, \"Where Eagles Dare\". Bruce sounds fantastic on it and the chorus was super catchy. It's a solid first listen to the album, but then things quickly turn south. \"Revelations\", \"Flight of Icarus\" and \"Die With Your Boots On\" all lowered my enjoyment song by song. They aren't bad songs by any means, but they really made me look at the time seeing how long until the end. The problem is that there is so much filler in these tunes. This filler is what Maiden improved with on \"The Number of the Beast\", but returns on this album. The second song on this album, \"Revelations\" is close to seven minutes long and I have to tell you, it's no \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\". Those longer Maiden tracks are interesting because they tell a cohesive story. It's the Maiden I love, but this? Maybe I just don't \"get\" it, but what the hell are they talking about in this song? Honestly, I have said this in every Maiden review, but the only thing to look forward to in these songs is the musicianship itself. Every song on every album is just performed wonderfully. I absolutely have no issues with anything maiden has written music wise.\n\nAlright, maybe the B side will be better. Immediately, \"The Trooper\" starts playing and I have to tell you, this song is damn near perfect. I'm not sure if this song has been ingrained into my brain after all these years, but it's definitely the best song on the album. It's on the shorter side and the lyrics are super fun. The song is about a man charging into battle with a bayonet. It starts off with the person charging and ends with them dying. It's absolutely great in all aspects. \"Still Life\" comes up next and while the song is a bit slower, the lyrics and Bruce's singing make this one very fun. It's something that will stick out and have you humming the following day. \"Quest for Fire\" is bizarre because Maiden talks about early man searching for fire and they throw in dinosaurs, so fuck it. The problem with this song is that the \"story\" Maiden tells ends half way through the song. After that, they just repeat lyrics and throw in a solo near the end. It's the same formula for almost every single song. Maiden sets up an interesting premise and then they just repeat the damn chorus. On \"Quest for Fire\" the song ends half way and then they repeat, \n\n\"Drawn by quest for fire, they searched across the land\nDrawn by quest for fire, discovery of man\"\n\nIt's a cool song, but they could have expanded on the lyrics when writing. I could think of a thousand badass subjects to sing about while talking about the quest for fire. \"Sun and Steel\" is god damn forgettable and easily the worst song on this album. It takes 10% of a story, about a child killing someone at the age of 13 and then becoming a warrior at 16, and then beating it into the ground with repetitive lyrics. \"To Tame a Land\" is this album's \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\". It's a seven minute song about a planet called Dune? I'm not sure if this is about the movie Dune or something they made up. The first half of the song is interesting, but eventually it falls flat. I honestly listened to this song about 10 minutes ago and the only thing I kind of remember are the goofy names to the places they were singing. \n\nI wanted to stay away from talking about each track, but hot damn this album is all over the place. The lyrics are half-assed in most songs and the repetitive lyrics return from Maiden's early days of writing. I just don't get how THIS is the follow up to \"The Number of the Beast\". \"Piece of Mind\" isn't this super shitty album though. There is some good on here with the musicianship of everyone, including the newest member Nicko McBrain on drums. These guys play and sing with such passion. It's a shame the lyrics are too forgettable. The solos are always fantastic on a Maiden record and I appreciate how the bass is crystal clear. Bruce rarely disappoints, although some of his high notes on here are a bit too high if that makes any sense. I really wanted to love this album, but now the only thing I know this album for is \"The Trooper\" and \"Quest for Fire\" when they sing about dinosaurs. \n\nRecommended songs: \"Where Eagles Dare\", \"The Trooper\", \"Still Life\", and \"To Tame a Land\"\n",
        "\nI was super excited to write this review if I am being honest. After reviewing the previous Iron Maiden albums, I knew what was to come. The Iron Maiden that I have grown to know and love was because of this album. This is one of the few Iron Maiden albums that I always went back to and knew what it was all about. After really focusing on the lyrics and paid extra attention to everything else it has to offer, I say with confidence that this is, so far, the best album Iron Maiden has written and executed up until this point in their career. \n\nI don't want to compare this masterpiece to previous albums, but if I must then I would say it has many improvements over the previous efforts. Gone are the extremely repetitive nature of the lyrics and the 70s rock vibe from \"Iron Maiden\". The song writing on this album is miles away from the previous two efforts. I don't hear any references to pick up trucks and I feel that the style of those previous albums are completely wiped away. Paul Di'Anno is gone and Bruce Dickinson has snatched the reigns of lead vocalist and it is very much for the better. Paul Di'Anno had improved drastically on \"Killers\", but I think Bruce is a much better fit for the band. Bruce proves to be one of the best metal vocalists of all time. This album being his first one with the band is ridiculously impressive. Besides the vocals, I feel like the overall quality is better on \"Killers\" as it pains me to say.\n\nThis album has some insane guitar solos and the bass and drums is as impressive as ever. Unfortunately, I feel that the quality of the sound has degraded for me. The solos were almost crystal clear in past albums and here it seems to all blend together with no extra emphasis on what is playing. Maybe it is just the version I listened to, but I just feel that the solos were more focused on previous efforts. With that being said, Maiden has written some of my favorite riffs on this album. The solos for \"The Prisoner\", \"Run to the Hills\" and \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\" are some of my favorite riffs of all time. I said it before in past Iron Maiden reviews, and I'll say it again that this album is worth it for the musicianship alone. Each riff is a masterpiece and fits each song perfectly. \n\nThe lyrics are another example of maturing Maiden. This album is surprisingly dark. It focuses on raping and pillaging, devil worship, prostitutes (Charlotte the Harlot returns!), and being sentenced to die by rope. This is the epitome of heavy metal devil music and I fucking love it. The lyrics are so much fun and really bring you to another world. They paint the perfect picture of each song in your head. When I am listening to the title track, \"Number of the Beast\", I can see the fire the man is talking about. I actually feel how the prisoner feels in \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\". It's just a wonderful album filled with even more wonderful lyrics. \n\nThe speed on this album is another thing that is an improvement over past efforts. While \"Killers\" and \"Iron Maiden\" had its fast songs, I think this album takes the cake. Not only is the music fast, but Dickinson sings fast as well. It gives off a huge rush that you just want to drive 100 miles per hour to. The intro song \"Invaders\" gives exactly what you want to hear for an opening track on this new and improved Maiden. I didn't mind \"The Ides of March\" has an instrumental intro on \"Killers\", but I think they took notes from \"Iron Maiden\" and wanted something a little more in your face to get you in the mindset for all the shinanigans of the rest of the record.\n\nOverall, there isn't too much to fault on \"Number of the Beast\". The only thing I would really bag this album for the sound quality and the song \"Gangland\". I don't know what it is about that song, but it's probably my least favorite on the album. The lyrics are written well, but I don't think it flows all too well. \"Number of the Beast\" is easily one of the greatest heavy metal albums of all time and everyone should listen to it. If you haven't listened to Iron Maiden and think it's just old school dad rock then I would really reconsider your life's choices. \n\nSongs I'd recommend: \"Invaders\", \"Children of the Damned\", \"The Number of the Beast\", \"Run to the Hills\" and \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\"\n",
        "\nOn my quest to see if Iron Maiden is really this legendary metal band, I am now on their follow up to their self titled debut. \"Killers\" is an album that I once again never really paid attention to all the way through. Going back and looking what Iron Maiden has to offer, I figured this album would be a step forward from their solid \"Iron Maiden\". Instead, I received an album that seems to JUST get beaten by their debut.\n\nThe first thing I noticed on \"Killers\" was the improvement of Paul Di'Anno's vocals and the lyrics as a whole. \"Iron Maiden\" suffered from a lot of filler. With only eight songs, a lot of the tracks were filled with \"yeah!, Oh, Yeaheah!\" There is some of that on this album, but not nearly as obnoxious. The song structure is infinitely better on \"Killers\" and the lyrics didn't repeat themselves nearly as much as the previous effort. \"Iron Maiden\" had this really 70s rock vibe that I dug to an extent. Even though I enjoyed it, I really wanted to hear that dark Iron Maiden lyric style that I am kind of used to. Instead of hearing about pick up trucks, I wanted to hear something darker and interesting. I did get that on \"Killers\" which was a relief. This album is filled with stories about murder and getting murdered. Hell, even Eddie on the cover here is killing someone. The lyrics were only as good as Paul's vocals which improved dramatically. There weren't many high pitched and elongated verses. Instead, he sang a bit faster and it made the songs flow better. None of this would have been possible without the epic musicianship of the rest of the band, however.\n\nSteve, Adrian, Dave and Clive all do an amazing job on this record. Steve's bass is prominent throughout the entire album and Clive Burr's drumming, especially on the song \"Genghis Khan\" is down right incredible. Adrian and Dave return to form as these monster guitar players that really hold this album together. The instrumental tracks on here, the intro \"The Ides of March\" and \"Genghis Khan\" are almost worth the album price alone. The playing on those tracks is absolutely unreal and I don't usually like intro tracks. Overall, top marks from everyone on here.\n\nSo, you may be asking, why give this album a 76%? Well, I have to say that with all the fun lyrics, the songs were a bit on the boring side to me. On the A side of this album, it seemed I really enjoyed every other song. The intro track, \"The Ides of March\", \"Murders in the Rue Morgue\" and \"Genghis Khan\" all kept me captivated and wanting more. While songs like \"Wrathchild\", \"Another Life\" and \"Innocent Exile\" all seemed to have this..blah sound to them. When the lyrics were on, they were definitely on, but when they dipped in subject matter, it lost me. \"Murders in the Rue Morgue\" tells this super fun story of someone who stumbles upon a murder and how he must escape to the border because the police think he did it. It's an awesome concept that painted a picture in my head of what the song was about. Then you have a song like \"Prodigal Son\" that completely lost me. I didn't know what the song was really about and it's slower and longer than \"Murders in the Rue Morgue\". On the B side, I really only loved the title track, \"Killers\". It's odd that I love the musicianship so much on this album, but the songs didn't really do much for me. \n\nOverall, I'm kind of shocked with this. On paper, I should have enjoyed this much more than I did. While I did feel like the song structure, lyric subject matter, and overall musicianship improved on \"Killers\", I felt like I enjoyed their self titled album a tiny bit more. I feel like it doesn't pull me back in for repeated listens. The songs that really kept my interest did so because of the content or the fact they were instrumental tracks. This album is not terrible by any means, but I may skip it in the future if I am ever this far down Iron Maiden's discography.\n\nRecommended songs: \"The Ides of March\", \"Murders in the Rue Morgue\", \"Genghis Khan\", and \"Killers\".\n",
        "\nI've always loved the idea of Iron Maiden, but really never gave their catalogue enough attention. Of course I have listened to \"Number of the Beast\" and \"Piece of Mind\", but the rest of their discography was really distant to me. That's why I wanted to change that. I've always heard from people that Iron Maiden is one of the greatest metal bands of all time, but are they really? I decided to start from the beginning and wanted to see how these guys evolved over time to truthfully answer that question. \n\nI own this album on cd and decided to sit down and really give it a listen. The first thing that pops into my head is that classic, crazy, Iron Maiden guitar sound. There is no doubt in my mind that I am listening to an Iron Maiden album. The guitar work on this entire album is god damn incredible. For being Iron Maiden's first release and from it being almost 40 years old, it aged extremely well. In fact, all of the musicianship on this album is fantastic. From the drumming, to the guitar and bass work is truly stunning. The only thing I'm really not sold on is the original vocalist, Paul Di'Anno. Now, maybe I am just used to listening to Bruce Dickinson, but I feel like, even though this is before Bruce joined the band, Paul Di'Anno is doing his best Bruce impersonation. I know that sounds odd, but it doesn't come off as natural to me. I feel like every song could have been elevated from Bruce singing. I hate to compare vocalists because this is Paul's album that Paul sang on, but it stuck out in my head too much while listening. \n\nThe lyrics on this album is also something I was surprised about for a few different reasons. On the first song, \"Prowler\", I was shocked to hear typical Maiden guitar sounds, but the lyrics felt like they came straight from 70's rock and roll. Other songs that are similar are \"Charlotte the Harlot\" and \"Running Free\". As soon as I heard the lyrics, \"Just sixteen, a pickup truck, out of money, out of luck\", my brain switched to 70s rock mode. It was a really cool experience to listen to these songs and I felt like I had the most fun with them. Maybe I had fun with them because I'm not personally used to hearing Maiden this way. I can't say the same for all the songs on this album because some of them, frankly, were a chore to get through. \"Remember Tomorrow\", \"Phantom of the Opera\" and even \"Strange World\" had me looking at how long was left on each song. These songs are on the longer side and I feel like they all offer way too much filler and repeated lyrics. The worst case of this on the album is the title track, \"Iron Maiden\". It's a song that is similar to the songs I mentioned that gave me a 70s vibe, but the lyrics repeat way too much for my liking. The song \"Iron Maiden\" is only three and a half minutes, but the same two verses are repeated throughout the whole thing. I like them on their own, but to be repeated throughout the whole thing? It's like Maiden wrote out some fun lyrics and said, \"Let's just keep this\". \n\nOverall, I say this is really a strong start for Iron Maiden. This just feels like first album material besides the guitar work. The riffs are absolutely incredible and definitely the highlight of the entire thing. The vocals and repetitive nature of the songs are distracting though. I'd probably pick \"Piece of Time\" and \"Number of the Beast\" over this debut album, but it's still a solid start to a legendary band.\n\nRecommended songs: \"Prowler\", \"Running Free\", \"Transylvania\", and \"Iron Maiden\"\n",
        "\nIt\u2019s 1990, you\u2019re entering a new decade as the (arguably) biggest, most successful metal band on the planet- the benchmark for others, if you will- and you have the \u2018new guard\u2019 nipping at your heels (Metallica and the like), what do you do? Add to that losing one of your primary guitarists/songwriters? Well, if you\u2019re Iron Maiden, you pick up a new guitarist, stick to your (tail) guns and do what you do best; be Iron Maiden.\n\nI remember when this came out (I\u2019m starting to show my age here\u2026) and at the time much of the music press were beginning to question whether Maiden had an answer to the younger bands that they influenced. There was talk of whether they could actually do a show without all the props and special effects and still \u2018bring it\u2019 live. As hard as it may be for the young-ins nowadays to believe, people actually DID question Maiden\u2019s relevance coming out of the 80\u2019s, just like they did ten years later at the turn of the century. Such was the impact that thrash (and, on a smaller scale, death and grind) had on the metal scene in the late 80\u2019s/early 90\u2019s.\n\nTheir answer was this album.\n\nGone were the guitar/bass synths from the last few albums. Gone were the slick production values that helped propel them to their rightful thrones as \u2018the band to beat\u2019 in the 80\u2019s. Gone were the laser light shows and crazy props that popularised their stage shows. What we were presented with was a band that basically rewound the clock on those advances to prove a point to any and all critics that dared to question whether they still had it in them to compete with the more aggressive bands they created in the wake of their success. They had no intention of being steam-rolled without putting up a fight. Whether or not they succeeded is up for debate (and personal taste), but one thing is for certain, this is one hell of a scrappy album regardless.\n\nExit Adrian Smith; enter everyone\u2019s favourite whipping boy Janick Gers. As much as people don\u2019t want to admit it, he did inject some much-needed new blood into the band. This guy possesses one hell of a fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants/about-to-fall-off-the-rails-at-any-time playing style that added to the whole middle-finger-in-your-face attitude that they were aiming for here. This guy\u2019s solos have always had an element of danger to their sound, almost like he\u2019s attacking you every time he goes off on one of his wild tangents. Not that I think many complain about his playing style more so than his stage antics. Say what you will about that, but one thing is for certain, he brings the fire on stage, adding that crucial dangerous vibe that many criticised the band for losing in the back end of the 80\u2019s. \n\nAs for the music on the actual album itself? It\u2019s Maiden, through and through, just a roughed up sounding one that hasn\u2019t existed since the \u201980-\u201981 period. Not that they completely dismissed everything they were known for; there is a (loose) theme to this album that seems to be forgotten. \n\nPrayer. Hope. Praying for the death of the past, praying for a bigger, better future.\n\nPeople have to remember, the Berlin Wall just fell, signalling an end of the Cold War. Those of us old enough to remember growing up and living during that era were terrified of WWIII breaking out between the world superpowers. Decades of that fear and tension had just ended. It was time of cerebration, of finally being able to put those old dogs down for good. Hence, at least the way I view it, why there are some light(er)-hearted songs on here (\u2018Holy Smoke\u2019, Hooks In You\u2019, \u2018Bring Your Daughter\u2026\u2019) mixed with the thought-provoking (\u2018No Prayer\u2026\u2019, \u2018Public Enema No. 1\u2019, \u2018Fates Warning\u2019-*a highly underrated song*-) all culminating into one of their best closers ever in \u2018Mother Russia\u2019. To me, that one song ties the entire album together. A true tear-jerker (seriously) that\u2019s sadly fell victim to the past (oh, the irony). \n\nThat\u2019s not to say that everything was great, however. \u2018Tailgunner\u2019, although kickass, is \u2018Aces High\u2019 part two, \u2018Hooks In You\u2019 is \u2018Charlotte The Harlot\u2019/\u201922 Acacia Avenue\u2019 part three (?) and \u2018Run Silent, Run Deep\u2019 is your stereotypical Maiden war tune that they\u2019ve been doing forever. There is definitely an aura of revisiting the past going on here, I can\u2019t deny that.\n\nIn the end, \u2018No Prayer\u2026\u2019 can\u2019t possibly compete with what they did before (and what honestly could) but as a middle-finger to those claiming they were washed-up/done? They succeeded, for the time being at least. They succeeded on a much higher scale ten years later. \n\nRegardless, time should\u2019ve been kinder to this album as it\u2019s been to others in their catalogue (\u2018The X Factor\u2019).\n\n(Personal side note: I was at the opening of their North American tour in Halifax, Nova Scotia- with Anthrax opening- and can attest to their \u2018rebirth\u2019 stage-wise with Gers on guitar. The way they all ran around the stage with reckless abandon was insane. They definitely blew Anthrax off the stage, more than proving that they could put on a show without all the \u2018distractions\u2019 they were getting accused of. Funny how almost thirty years later, they\u2019re still doing that too\u2026)\n",
        "\nAmong the more long lived and still largely unsettled debates within metal's history is the depth of the relationship that the NWOBHM shared with its late 70s rival punk rock. Though conciliatory tone has been struck by a few individual bands on both sides of the divide, your average punk rocker is quick to point out that, among other distinctions, heavy metal often embraces the technical excess of the earlier progressive rock sound. This proves to be a bit of a conundrum wherein the Paul Di'Anno era of Iron Maiden is concerned, given that his vocals and image definitely blurred the lines between punk and heavy metal, which arguably clashed with Steve Harris' ambitious songwriting and the heavy level of technical proficiency readily displayed by all instrumentalists in congress. Though several songs that cycled through Maiden's eponymous debut and some that ended up as b-sides on corresponding singles carried this curious tendency, it is the band's lone cover song single Women In Uniform that arguably settles the question of where Maiden ultimately stood on this issue.\n\nIn contrast to the original Skyhooks version, which came out of Australia in 1978 (when punk was arguably at its apex) and had sort of a straight up, fast rocking character in line with its day, Iron Maiden presents a far grittier and more dangerous rendition on several fronts. Though a few well placed harmonized guitar notes and a flashier demeanor does much to put the classic Maiden spin on things, Di'Anno's deeper inflections and crackling screeches are what seal the deal, and while having something of a more improvised feel compared to the original, has a degree of precision and poise that's a bit too calculated for a typical punk outfit. By contrast, b-side and unsung early Maiden classic \"Invasion\" is where the vocals and a more rustic yet driving feel would be a dead-ringer for a typical up tempo punk rock song, though once Murray and Stratton start cutting heads, it gets a little hard to find any guitarists in the punk scene of yore that could hope to compare. Likewise, though Di'Anno's live rendition of \"Phantom Of The Opera\" carries the drunken and nonchalant feel of a punk show, the underlying musical intricacies scream progressive rock like a banshee getting a Polish bike ride.\n\nAt best, the author of this review can chalk up the collective attitude towards punk rock among Maiden's 1980 lineup as one of ambivalence, but given that his first encounter with this single was via bonus material on the 1995 reissue of Killers and he's been routinely contradicted by others who were there back when Di'Anno was still in Maiden's fold, it's far from a settled matter. All the same, it can be agreed upon that the primordial days of Iron Maiden and, by extension, the entire NWOBHM, was a highly interesting time where borders seem to be breaking down a bit more quickly than being built. By contrast, punk rock has largely clung to a parochial approach where a lot of the detailing that makes for an involved listening experience is cast aside as pretentious showboating, something that was not in Maiden's thought process going back to the very beginning. Though dated by almost 40 years of evolution in studio technology, these songs hold up extremely well to this day and offer an important lesson to the rock music world at large that a hybridized approach is a key ingredient in innovation. It's no accident that Maiden became the hottest selling name and the biggest crowd draw of the NWOBHM, and it was equally apparent why even before Adrian Smith and Bruce Dickinson joined the fold.\n",
        "\nIt\u2019s pretty rare when an album ticks off all the boxes for things I love about metal, but Powerslave somehow manages to do it. Powerful vocals? Check. Amazing riffs and catchy guitar harmonies? Check. Bass that is not only audible, but actually does more than just play the root notes? Check. Lyrics that tell interesting stories? Oh, you better believe that\u2019s a check.\n\n\"Powerslave\" is Iron Maiden at their absolute best. Their songwriting was in top form, and I think that having the whole band contribute to the songs this time around, instead of having Steve Harris dominate the songwriting, helped bring in a good mixture of sounds to the fray. You have the dramatic, more epic songs that display Maiden's more technical side, with the kind of grand, ambitious songwriting that they've pursued more in recent years. The music can get pretty damn technical when they want to, e.g the lightning fast pulloffs on \"Back in the Village.\"\n\nOn the other hand, there's the more straightforward songs like \"Two Minutes To Midnight\" and \"Flash of the Blade,\" which are no less catchy or well written than some of the more proggy songs on the album, with great riffwork. I must say, out of all the songs that use the same iconic riff as \"Two Minutes To Midnight,\" even the ones predating it like \"Flash Rockin Man\" or \"Gangland,\" Maiden pulls it off the best, with some bitingly anti-war lyrics adding to the song's dramatic atmosphere. There's even Maiden's last instrumental piece, \"Losfer Words\" (geddit?), and even without Dickinson's powerful voice, the song is still intriguing and fun as hell to listen to, with catchy, uplifting guitar leads that refuse to leave your head. Really, if there's one word to sum up the music here, it's catchy. Every song here will stay with you after one listen, thanks to the irresistible riffs and vocal melodies.\n\nAnd then there's the title track. My god, what a monster of a song. Dickinson really outdid himself on this one, telling his tale of a Pharaoh on his deathbed coming to terms with his own mortality. Eerie phrygian melodies add to the ominous atmosphere of the song, and let's not forget about Steve Harris' melodic bassline underneath the guitar solo, almost acting as a solo in and of itself, a la Geezer Butler in War Pigs. But the solo itself is no slouch, and is a great showcase of Dave Murray's bluesy, melodic leanings.\n\n\"Powerslave\" benefits from a crisp, clean production job. It's not too glossy, but the guitars are clear and cutting, the bass is warm and audible, and the drums are solid as a rock. Dickinson's voice in in top shape here. He's able to hit the high notes with ease, and he's more than capable of adding a good amount of grit and snarl to his lower register to make things sound a bit more aggressive or sinister. \n\nIf there's one nitpick that I have with this album, it's that \"The Duellists\" isn't quite up to snuff in terms of songwriting with the rest of the album. The riffs are a bit basic and uninteresting, not as catchy or gripping as the rest of the album, and the middle guitar break that takes up nearly half the song goes on too long for my liking. If the whole song had been kept down to 4 minutes, But other than that, Powerslave is an absolute treasure of an album, and in my mind it set the gold standard for heavy metal.\n",
        "\nBit of a history lesson; my entry into the metal music world was not by way of the \"classic\" acts so many of my peers were exposed to years and years back. Nope; I was instead brought to the distorted world thanks to the thrash and groove metal scenes, only to seek out things heavier and darker down the line with death and black metal. The reason I bring this up is that, when I first came across Iron Maiden, I was balls-deep in extreme metal and I...just plain didn't like it. They just didn't have the punch, the panache, the goods, if you will, and even today I feel that were I to give them a spin back when I was first getting into metal I'd be a lot more impressed and, quite possibly, a fan from then to now. First impressions really do count for a lot, as Warden Darling once said. But that didn't happen, and it didn't matter what they did I was not sold no matter how many people thought I was a damned fool for thinking so (no apologies, ever).\n\nSo, 20 years hence, with my musical tastes far more expansive than when I was a suggestible twit, I tried to give the Maiden a second chance, starting with the very first album of theirs I'd heard. And well...I'm still not impressed.\n\nFor what it's worth, I'd never found Iron Maiden all that great on a stylistic level. The main problem with this, as seems to be the case with the group in general, is that everything seems fine and dandy for the first few songs, but by the time you get to track 5 or so you've already gotten their full musical scope and the rest of the album peters out through rearrangements and rehashing of said ideas up to that point, and this is clearly the case with \"Killers\"; fun for a little while, but ends up gassing out halfway through and sounding too uninspired for its own good by way of running through progressions and riffing schemes you've already heard. Not a whole lot really throws you for a loop beyond that first glance and listen. That being said, though, it's not entirely a worthless release; Harris and co. churn through those tunes like they're doing a six minute mile, with energy to spare and a voice loud and bright. Song structures are a little more varied beyond the \"verse-chorus\" appeal, tempos shift here and there and things can go from speedy to groove-laden at a moment's notice, more often than not cleanly and without sounding forced. This may be a metal album, where the guitars are gods among mere mortals, yet strangely enough the bass seems to get the majority of the facetime from end to end. Blame it on the songwriting credits or whoever really formed the group or whatever else, but regardless the music itself is plentifully excited (yet not exciting), almost like \"Killers\" is so damned glad to be there, to be jammed at loud volumes for your enjoyment.\n\nHowever, as stated before, there's only so much of this kind of sound one can take, especially when it really does feel like the Maiden boys don't have it in them to spread their creative wings beyond a basic and rigid musical formula (then again, they've built an entire career on that notion, so what do I know?). The arrangement scheme isn't always the same thing twice (for the most part), but all the band's incisive playing can't cover up seeing chord progressions coming a mile away. The utter predictability of the material itself is, easily, the worst thing about this; there was never a time in which I was thrown for a loop nor was blown away by an unexpected change, and each successive time I heard the same change-ups, melodies and key shifts I was ready to scream. It can get so frustrating, so fist-clenching, to know how a song will unfold before it hits and therefore leaving little to no impact upon arrival, and maybe I was expecting more than what was provided (that's very well possible), but for all its gloss and through-the-wall energy \"Killers\" still left me quite cold. The harmonies are very nice, the performance beautifully and professionally tight where it counts, but It has no menace, no sense of emotional connection, and no overt heaviness or further expansion of original ideas for the most part. If nothing else this is the best example of the one-dimensional trad. metal trope; it's good for one particular thing, and has very little else to offer if one is looking for a different sort of experience. It could be that was the point all along, but when you want to dine on something far more substantial, don't fill up on bread.\n\nIn the end, and despite my recent honest attempts, I'm still not sold on this, or Maiden in general, much as I am sure many out there would claim I sooner turn in my \"Metal Card\" as a result of such an opinion. I will not deny their importance in the metal world at large, nor their influence on so many other groups I am currently a fan of, that I cannot take away from them. But as an entity all their own? Unimpressive. Still.\n",
        "\nMaiden Japan is an extended play featuring four or five songs recorded in Japan. Its rarity, unique cover artwork and line-up make it one of the most interesting releases in Iron Maiden's extensive discography.\n\nIt's a shame that the band has never officially released the full concert. You can easily find it on the internet and it's mindblowing. The band performs with energy, flow and pace. Clive Burr's drum play is precise as a clockwork and this release shows why many fans have prefered him over Nicko McBrain who has talent and charisma but less feeling and accuracy. The bass guitar is particularly dominant which is an element that has always set the band apart and Steve Harris' energetic play is even more striking on this live album than on the first two studio records. Guitar duo Dave Murray and Adrian Smith already shows great chemistry and finds the right balance between heavy riffs and progressive stylistics, between fierce energy and melodious harmonies, between fast and short sections and more elaborate balladesque passages. Paul Di'Anno is in great form and performs the faster tracks with charismatic energy and the mellower tunes with feeling. In addition to this, he is a great entertainer and communicates briefly but efficiently with the fans. The enthusiastic Japanese crowd only adds to the fascination of this legendary live release as the fans are as energetic as the crowds the band played for in Europe and North America at the time.\n\nFour songs are included on all versions of this release. ''Running Free'' is catchy, energetic and to the point which is why the song is still performed live occasionally even though its style is quite different from the band's eighteen-minute long progressive metal epics nowadays. ''Remember Tomorrow'' is a track with a mysterious and melancholic vibe that is best described as power ballad where the phenomenal guitar play and the versatile vocals can shine. ''Killers'' is one of the few more elaborate tracks in the band's early years and convinces with gloomy atmosphere supported by unchained screams. The song makes you feel as frantic as if you were really being followed by a serial killer. It would still blend in very well on any soundtrack for a horror movie or video game. ''Innocent Exile'' is a simpler heavy rock song in the key of the opener. It's not a particularly memorable track and actually clearly the weakest of the bunch but since it has only been rarely performed by the band, it's certainly quite a gimmick to listen to it nowadays.\n\nSome editions, such as the Canadian release I have come across, include a fifth song in form of the short, energetic and bass-driven ''Wratchchild'', a classic that is still played live on numerous occasions but which I have always prefered with Paul Di'Anno's raw vocals over Bruce Dickinson's more melodic approach.\n\nNothing on this powerful live document indicates the tensions that started to grow in the band or the bad performances by the singer related to bad habits. Maiden Japan is the testament of a band that has peaked really quickly, sounds hungry and seems ready to conquer the world. Nobody could predict that the line-up would fall apart only a few months after the release of this often overlooked gem.\n\nLet's hope the band will release the full concert in remastered form one day. Since this hasn't happened in nearly four decades, make sure to track this gem down if you are a fan of hard rock and heavy metal music. Try to get a version of the five-track release that offers more value for money. This is the strongest release of the band's early era with singer Paul Di'Anno.\n",
        "\nIron Maiden's Live After Death is one of the most iconic live records ever released by a metal band. This starts with Derek Riggs' phenomenal cover artwork which is continued on the back sleeve and even in the booklet. The artwork is colourful yet gloomy, detailed yet coherent, imaginative yet true to Iron Maiden's identity. It's simply one of the greatest cover artworks ever crafted. \n\nThe authentic, direct and powerful production of the ambitious live record wrote history back then and has stood the test of time by today's standards. This is a live record that truly sounds alive.\n\nThe track list offers the best cuts from Iron Maiden's critically acclaimed first five studio records. Every song is outstanding and most of them can still regularly be found on the band's set lists to this day. \n\nThe shows were also absolutely stunning with gigantic backdrops and imaginative decorations that brought the legendary world of Ancient Egypt back to life. \n\nThe performances are also great even though Bruce Dickinson was apparently having a cold when the shows were recorded. If he is able to sing like a god when having a cold, imagine how great he must sound under perfectly healthy circumstances. The instrumental work is out of this world. The bass guitar is dominant and galloping and there is no doubt on my mind that Steve Harris is the greatest bass guitar player in the heavy metal genre. The drum play is very precise yet filled with passion and finds the right balance between emotions and technique. The guitar players complement each other perfectly and find the perfect balance between emotional solos, gripping riffs and calm and progressive transitions. The chemistry between the five musicians of this classic line-up is outstanding.\n\nThe only reason why other live records like Rock in Rio and Death on the Road could be considered equally great is because they include songs that are less spectacular on the studio records that have been transformed into powerful live anthems. This makes Iron Maiden one of the most efficient live bands of all times. However, it's difficult to compare this element to Live After Death because the songs chosen for this record were already great on their respective studio records and kept the momentum on this live release. Still, Iron Maiden found a few elements to rate some songs up. The proto power metal opener ''Aces High'' is cleverly complemented by the addition of Winston's Churchill's legendary We Shall Fight on the Beaches speech. ''Revelations'' is performed faster than the studio version and the fan participation makes the track even more emotional. ''Running Free'' comes around with great interactions between lead singer Bruce Dickinson and the participative crowd and makes this classic track an unexpected party anthem.\n\nIn the end, I just can't find any reasonable flaw here and would make the bold statement that Iron Maiden's Live After Death is the best live album I have ever heard in my life so far. Any rock or metal fan of any age, background or preference should know, own and regularly listen to this brilliant live record. Up the Irons!\n",
        "\nFirst things first: it's definitely not Blaze's guilt that I don't like this album very much. The fact is that I always divided \"The X Factor\" into two parts, the first three songs and the remaining 50 minutes. In other words, the fascinating triple strike at the beginning is followed by an actually entire album without any remarkable highlights. However, let's start chronologically with the opener.\n\n\"The Sign of the Cross\" has everything that it needs to be considered as a real Maiden classic. It holds a great song structure, fascinating melodies, more than the usual opulence, well designed rhythmic changes, stimulating pictures that are created by the fantastic lyrics, dramatic sequences, an unforgettabe chorus, expressive vocals and ... (please add whatever else you expect from a great song of the British institution, I am sure you will find it during these exciting 11 minutes of art). Due to the fact that I always respected Maiden without being a real fan, my personal favourites might differ from those of a true supporter, but in my humble opinion, a lot of their more famous songs from the first seven album stand in the shadow of this large-formatted opener.\n\n\"Lord of the Flies\" and \"Man on the Edge\" do not possess this extraordinary touch, but they can rely on good guitar lines, catchy choruses and in the case of the latter on an energetic, speedy rhythm. Some dudes blamed \"Lord of the Flies\" for its ostensibly primitive \"oooh-oooh-oooh\" vocal lines, but I disagree. Maiden are famous for mastering complexity, but they also always had some straight tunes like \"Running Free\", \"Invaders\" or the phenomenal \"Sanctuary\" that had better things to do than to strive for complicated patterns. It always depends on the mix. So after having listened to these three tracks, I was very optimistic and I thought that the only major flaw of \"The X Factor\" is its very repugnant artwork. Little anecdote, one of my friends, who had also bought the album, threw the booklet immediately into the bin, because he could not endure the sight of this shitty picture. Full understanding, brother!\n\nWell, I quickly realized that the full-length had more negative surprises than only the picture of the tormented Eddie. An endless stream of vapid, relatively slow-moving songs follows \"Man on the Edge\". Some of them are equipped with absolutely pale and miserable choruses, for example the uninspired \"Fortunes of War\". Some other have at least a certain number of decent sequences (\"Look for the Truth\"), but a lot of comparatively soft instrumental sections kill any form of vigorous expressiveness. The longer the full-length lasts, the more it becomes clear that Maiden suffered from a strange kind of collective identy crisis - and no doctor was available. Instead of coming to the point, the guys formed overlong tracks without rhyme or reason. Tennis players would speak of \"unforced errors\" when listening, for instance, to parts like the senseless bass introduction of \"Blood on the World's Hand\". As a result, this partly dark track lacks compactness and falls through the net. But it's a general problem - too many soft sections hurt the power and the flow of an album which is simply too long and, sorry for that, predominantly boring. The production is okay, Blaze does his best and Maiden songs always have a certain substance, but the complete absence of thrilling moments during the last 50 minutes constitutes an evidence of incapacity. As much as I regret it, songs like the faceless and uninspired \"2 A.M.\" should never have seen the light of day. \n\nFrom my point of view, the first songs save this album as far as possible. Especially \"The Sign of the Cross\" marks an essential track for the followers of Harris and his comrades. One of his previous comrades, Blaze Bailey, has recently said in an interview with the German magazine Deaf Forever that he loves both albums, but I am sorry that I cannot share the point of view of this upstanding artist. \"Virtual XI\" is no miracle of technology, but it sounds lively and offers coherent tracks, while the here reviewed work appears as an enormous but ill-coordinated monster. Anyhow, as mentioned before, the engagement of Blaze was not the reason for the pretty weak result called \"The X Factor\".\n",
        "\nIn 2010, Iron Maiden were living the dream. Since the return of Bruce Dickinson and Adrian Smith in 1999, the band had released three albums that were more or less heralded by their fans, with many claiming that \u201cthe band was back\u201d - though some were less enthralled. Brave New World was a fantastic introduction to the new Maiden style, Dance of Death was an experimental continuation of that style, and A Matter of Life and Death was a heartfelt album and a fortress of new material. Indeed, there were many who considered these albums better than anything the band ever released previous, despite some claiming that Maiden was dead and the band would never be able to return to the greatness of the \u201880s material. The hardcore fans - people like myself, though I wasn\u2019t into the band at the time - said they were nuts, because their three \u2018reunion era\u2019 albums were awesome and showed a maturity the band had never reached until that point.\n\nSo needless to say, when Iron Maiden announced their fifteenth album, expectations were high... especially given that it had the ominous title of \u2018The Final Frontier\u2019. Would this be the last album we\u2019d ever get from this British metal institution? Spoiler alert: It wasn\u2019t. But no one knew it at the time, so if this was in fact the end, it better be pretty damn good. This album would need to deliver on all fronts. There was no room for failure - Steve and the gang would need to release something no less short of a masterpiece.\n\nBut they didn\u2019t.\n\nThe Final Frontier isn\u2019t a particularly bad album, really. It has many cool ideas within its ten tracks and I often find myself going, \u201cHey, this is pretty good!\u201d But then it moves on to a more bland spot and I find myself just listening along again, not into it much. Actually, the problem with TFF is that it\u2019s not one of Maiden\u2019s most inspired efforts, and when inspiration hits, the execution doesn\u2019t pay off.\n\nTake for example the opening \u2018epic\u2019 - two four minute tracks stitched together into an eight minute number called \u201cSatellite 15... The Final Frontier\u201d. \u201cSatellite 15\u201d is a completely different kind of thing for Maiden, with some atmospheric instrumentation before Bruce\u2019s vocals kick in. While it\u2019s nice, it should\u2019ve been shortened; after a while it becomes boring. Luckily when \u201cThe Final Frontier\u201d jumps in, the album really gets going with a fine song. While the lyrics aren\u2019t Maiden\u2019s best, it\u2019s a monster opener. That said, it can\u2019t compete with \u201cThe Wicker Man\u201d or \u201cDifferent World\u201d, but it\u2019s still pretty nice.\n\nHowever, you can tell right from this first song that there\u2019s something... off about this album. The instruments are okay, but the vocals aren\u2019t. Something off about Bruce\u2019s voice. Is it down to bad mixing or is he just not giving his all? I think it\u2019s a mix of both. It sounds distinctly different from the three previous albums and the following one, The Book of Souls. It really doesn\u2019t sound like the passion is as present here, and while he hits the notes excellently, there\u2019s little more than that.\n\nBut never mind the vocals - the lyrics took a dive here too. \u201cThe Man Who Would Be King\u201d is a sheer mess lyrically. It keeps talking about a man who apparently took someone\u2019s life and now facing the consequences, but there\u2019s either too much prose or too little because it\u2019s pretty much horseshit. The music isn\u2019t much better; the build up promises a lot that the rest of the song can\u2019t give, the instrumental is just too weird for Maiden, and the verses are terrible. Still, the chorus is surprisingly great and the ending is pretty nice. Which goes back to what I said earlier - the truly inspired moments are good, but the bad ones overshadow everything.\n\nBut even worse lyrics can be found in the album\u2019s third track, \u201cMother of Mercy\u201d. An interesting beginning which moves into a heavier bit (during which the guitars remind me of Chuck Schuldiner, go figure) and then nothing truly good comes out of it. It\u2019s just bland and unmemorable. People think it wouldn\u2019t be out of place on A Matter of Life and Death thanks to what it\u2019s about - war - but thank god they didn\u2019t release it on there. The worst line on the entire album (and one of Maiden\u2019s worst ever) is \u201cMercy\u2019s\u201d dumbass thing: \u201cI don\u2019t hold with bad religion.\u201d What the fuck is that supposed to mean? How do you separate good religion from bad religion? I\u2019m so confused and the goddamn thing won\u2019t even explain itself. Eugh.\n\nThose two songs are pretty abysmal and luckily the rest are all fairly enjoyable. \u201cComing Home\u201d is a heartfelt ballad from a starry-eyed Bruce about the band\u2019s touring, though not as great as many say. \u201cThe Alchemist\u201d is a cool rocker that\u2019s pretty fun, but can\u2019t compare to most of the other ones they\u2019ve released over the years. As for \u201cIsle of Avalon\u201d, this epic is possibly the proggiest song the band has ever released, and many have compared it to Rush. While everything is good on paper, the heavier bits could\u2019ve used some better singing on Bruce\u2019s part, or overdubbing... something at least.\n\nBut there\u2019s one song that I think defines the album\u2019s \u2018actual inspiration with questionable execution\u2019. That song is \u201cStarblind\u201d. The lyrics to the song are fantastic and some of the best the band have ever released. It\u2019s a song about breaking the grip of religion on your life and a cast-down of self-important religious leaders who use their influence to damn those who don\u2019t follow in their path. \u201cThe preacher loses face with Christ\u201d is a line that I think is pure brilliance. But while the lyrics are incredible, the arrangement and the music backing it isn\u2019t so much. The bits that follow the chorus sound as though they\u2019ve recycled \u201cInfinite Dreams\u201d, and while it\u2019s not terrible, the song as a whole feels pretty stitched together. If it was more acoustic-based with some better production to bring out the electricity of an electric guitar running overtop the acoustic one, it would be a fantastic, beautiful composition. But it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s a song that\u2019s taken forever to grow on me and while I really want to love it, it\u2019s just not a perfect song.\n\nBut enough griping, the album isn\u2019t all bad. The Final Frontier holds three songs that really are great. The first of these is \u201cEl Dorado\u201d, a great choice for a single and a true adventure-feel song though the lyrics are instead about bankers and people being fucked out of their money. A deserved Grammy win, definitely. The second great song here is \u201cThe Talisman\u201d, an epic sea-faring track about pilgrims in search of a new land having to battle storms, wind, rain, and the unimaginable. Bruce actually sounds great on here and it\u2019s definitely one of his finest vocal performances ever. Finally, the album\u2019s epic closer, \u201cWhen The Wild Wind Blows\u201d is an emotional song that sounds like a typical Harris epic - but boy does it work. By the time it ends, you\u2019re left thinking that the album was worth listening to after all.\n\nStill though, with better singing from Bruce and some more planning before recording, The Final Frontier would have been a much better album. But unfortunately, it only comes out as \u201cokay\u201d. And okay is not Maiden standard. The worst Maiden album after Killers, and a definite pothole in Maiden\u2019s 2000s material, but luckily the band would iron it all out with the fabulous Book of Souls.\n\nIf only this one would have been as good.\n",
        "\nMost people find that they have a band they love so much that they consider said band their all-time favorite. For me, that band is Iron Maiden, and I love almost everything they\u2019ve ever released. However, even your favorite band sometimes does something you think... eh, really could\u2019ve been better. Sometimes they release something that\u2019s outright terrible. In other words, there\u2019s always going to be a least favorite album from your favorite bands that just doesn\u2019t stack up well against their other releases. And in Maiden\u2019s case, the most typically criticized, disliked, and oftentimes outright loathed albums are the ones released in the \u201890s, particularly the two with Blaze Bayley on vocals. But I\u2019m not one of the detractors; The X Factor and Virtual XI are two of my favorite albums ever and I love them to death. No, for my money the single worst Iron Maiden album, bar none, is their sophomore effort from 1981, Killers.\n\nNow firstly, bad Maiden is still heads and tails over many other artists. All of Killers is still fairly good. I can get into it when I\u2019m listening to it. But... then I listen to pretty much any other album and I enjoy them so much more. The problem with Killers is that most of the songs here sound like leftovers from another recording session that were rightfully cut. And I say most because, going by the 1998 remaster, there are 5 good songs, and 6 bad ones. This is an imbalance I have never been able to find in another Maiden album.\n\nSo let\u2019s start with the positives - the five good songs. \u201cThe Ides of March\u201d and \u201cWrathchild\u201d are a perfect opening shot, \u201cMurders in the Rue Morgue\u201d is my favorite song from the Di\u2019Anno albums, \u201cGenghis Khan\u201d is a fantastic instrumental, and \u201cKillers\u201d is an awesome, schizophrenic composition. I have no qualms with any of these. They\u2019re all enjoyable songs that showcase the band\u2019s songwriting prowess quite well even stacked against the rest of their discography. It\u2019s just that... I\u2019d rather listen to them outside of the album usually than with the other six songs. These five would\u2019ve made for a nice EP, but instead they\u2019re included alongside some songs that don\u2019t showcase Maiden\u2019s strengths, but rather their weaknesses.\n\nOne of those weaknesses is the fact that there is a shitload of repetition on this goddamn album. Sure, people criticize the repetition on the Blaze albums, but while \u201cThe Angel and the Gambler\u201d does repeat its chorus far more than one would expect, there\u2019s more to that song than \u201cDon\u2019t you think I\u2019m a savior?\u201d It actually tells an interesting story. The songs on this album can\u2019t even do that. \u201cAnother Life\u201d repeats itself thrice and each time we get no farther than the first. Shit, I memorized the lyrics on the first listen. \u201cInnocent Exile\u201d repeats the first verse twice and then does something different afterwords but... the song itself is even worse than \u201cAnother Life\u201d. Simply put, I don\u2019t need music that does the same thing over and over without anything else that\u2019s interesting. At least \u201cTAATG\u201d has that. These don\u2019t.\n\nMeanwhile, the production on this album is... not nearly as good as so many people say it is. Most people say it\u2019s a great step-up from the debut album, which had almost no production at all. But that\u2019s where I disagree. I like the \u2018bad\u2019 production of Iron Maiden because it brought out the rawness of the record and did the songs\u2019 styles justice (even if Steve doesn\u2019t think so). Killers, however, has undeniably better production, but it doesn\u2019t fit the material. Instead, it makes the entire record feel sleezy. I don\u2019t like sleezy Maiden. They aren\u2019t that kind of band, and these songs would sound far better with production more in the vein of the debut\u2019s. Sure, it\u2019s more listenable when you\u2019re using headphones, but one shouldn\u2019t sacrifice the songs just for that. Production needs to fit the material, and this stuff just doesn\u2019t work.\n\nOn the other hand though, the material is about as bad as the production. Take \u201cProdigal Son\u201d, for instance. This is actually a song with some pretty interesting ideas and some cool solos - and actually one of Paul\u2019s best vocal moments on the entire album. But everything else falls flat. It\u2019s stylistically similar to \u201cRemember Tomorrow\u201d and \u201cStrange World\u201d from the first album, and while it\u2019s slightly better than that first song, it fails in comparison to the latter. There\u2019s just nothing much worth noting from the song except that it\u2019s the longest one on Killers - and I don\u2019t really wish it was. Oh well.\n\nNow while \u201cProdigal Son\u201d has admittedly good Di\u2019Anno singing, he isn\u2019t perfect on this album. Also thanks to the production, his voice often comes off as sleezy as the guitars. And when he does those falsettos - god oh god! Please don\u2019t, it isn\u2019t pleasant. I know that some people enjoy those, and to them I say, you can have him, but I\u2019ll stick with Blaze.\n\nBut when it comes to bad songs, two of these take the absolute cake - \u201cDrifter\u201d and \u201cPurgatory\u201d. Outside of a few downright horrendous non-album tracks, these are the worst songs Maiden have ever released. Both have stupid lyrics with stupid music backing them and stupid singing voicing them. \u201cPurgatory\u201d is one of the album\u2019s most beloved songs, which I don\u2019t get whatsoever. Those lyrics are absolutely terrible. \u201cAll my love\u2019s inside of YOOOUUU!\u201d What the fuck does that have to do with Purgatory?? And Drifter is just as bad. I don\u2019t listen to Maiden for these silly love song type things; they\u2019re usually shallow and completely shitty and when this band does it they come out horrendous. And meanwhile, there\u2019s a section in \u201cDrifter\u201d\u2019s instrumental that i consider the worst moment in Maiden\u2019s discography. It sounds like goddamn circus music. What the fuck happened there? Eugh....\n\nI know I\u2019m really not in the majority with my views; many see the album as a classic Maiden release that they love and cherish and consider one of the band\u2019s best. Well if you payed attention to this review, I have absolutely no clue why. To me, most of this album is sloppy b-side fodder-type songs that just don\u2019t cut it for me. Maiden have almost always been a cut above the best with their songwriting, proving to be some of the most intelligent in the business. But you wouldn\u2019t know that listening to this album. It\u2019s really scraping the barrel when it comes to the content, and thank god the band picked up greatly with the following album, the classic Number of the Beast. But nonetheless, this assortment of tunes really could\u2019ve benefited from better planning, writing, arrangement, singing, and different production. It\u2019s just not up to par with the rest of their discography. At times it can be enjoyable, but by and large it\u2019s just nothing special. In fact, the album has tainted my appreciation of the cover itself, go figure.\n\nIn short, this is an extremely overrated album and not nearly Maiden\u2019s best. While some of the songs are quite good, most of them aren\u2019t. The other fifteen albums by this band are much better than the tripe found here. But hey, you may like it far more than me. That\u2019s cool. You listen to this one; I\u2019ll stick with The X Factor.\n",
        "\nThis band has been one of the popular bands of the 80s, and Killers is some pretty cold hard proof. They have always made music that stands out from the rest of the metal pack, giving a very unique listening experience. For me, this was my fifth pick up from Maiden, but it really should have been my second one. Killers and The Number of the Beast are pretty good introductions to the band, but No Prayer for the Dying is the one recommended for the newbie. Maiden 1990's offering brings to light a whole new display of endurance and aggressiveness skills. This album builds on the street landscapes presented in albums such as Killers, but also somewhat throwback to an older sound.\n\nIt is a beautiful, rich combination of rawness and simplicity. Killers and the debut were released ten years before, so it's quite amazing to see again this kind of songwriting. This is much more in the vein of straightforward heavy metal like the debut, instead of the epic stuff they have come composing, and this is what Iron Maiden do best. It is, in fact, their best 90s album along with Virtual XI. The production is not as cleaner like Seventh Son, but it's a sound they could use with for the next albums; unfortunately, that was not developed and only stands up on this record.\n\nFrom the first note played on this album, you can tell you're going to be in a rip-roaring ride. You should know, by now, not to expect anything serious this time. Gone are the emperors, cyborgs and mystic characters themes. When the guitar riffs stand out, they're very prominent, but when they don't, you can still enjoy them at all. The solos are all impressive, as they range from utter wankery-fest to sliding along with the song perfectly. The lyrics are street as hell, and the raspy vocals truly seem to fit the thematic, but that matter doesn't make a difference really. Songs are catchy, and most likely you'll have them stuck in your head as much as you hum the choruses. Janick Gers' doodle solos show how skilled he is with his instrument, and is pretty damn addictive.\n\nThe title track offers some nice lead and riff work from Janick Gers, he has always been one of my top rhythm guitarists, and his playing sets the tone for this song, as well as much of the rest of the disc. It also features some nice bass runs from Harris and some pretty over-the-top drumming from Nicko. If you have a sense of rhythm, listen and see what I mean. After a while this can give the songs a very plodding, boring feel, as if they're not going fast enough, or don't have enough energy. The Assassin is a prime example. However, due to some good guitar and vocal work, this problem can be resolved, as pre-chorus shows. The last song is a mini-epic starting off slowly, speeding up during the verse and chorus, and having a slow section in the middle of the song, laden with keyboards, which blasts out with a majestic solo again.\n\nAs a whole the album ends satisfactorily and strikes out compactly. A great Killers sequel! Even so, No Prayer manages to release some of the rawest, pure songs I've heard in quite a while. Very raw and thrashy, which is the main thing that keeps the attention of listeners and will avoid leaving you still. But still, the raw and almost grungy feel is something you just gotta like in metal. To finish it off, this disc is just something you either like or dislike, even if you're not a big fan of raspy productions. The raw production in combination with the bluesy tunes instantly makes this a distinctive point.\n",
        "\nMaiden were riding high after the Seventh Son of a Seventh Son release. That record cemented their position in the top metal elite and made them into one of the popular metal acts since then. However, internal strifes started to plague the band, which led to the departure of vocalist Bruce Dickinson. However, they eventually accepted Blaze Bayley into the fold and retreated to the studio to record, this time, their second offering. The only thing that slightly bothers me about the lyrical content is that it often begins to fade into a reconciler air, just for one song here. This is not a drawback for the band, however. \n\nThe lyrics are extremely well-written, and leave a lot open to interpretation, yet kinda repetitive. One could easily construe many songs as a simple personal growth, and that doesn't bother me at all. The X Factor actually ranks as my least favorite Iron Blaze album, because while it has a few flashes of brilliance, the band still focusing too much on dramatic, layered vocal lines and too little on making a meaty album with catchy songs, something which truly happens in Virtual XI. What didn't work on The X Factor is working on this album, which is strange when you consider how similar the two albums actually sound at times.\n\nBlaze\u2019s performance is good; he sounds very pissed off and that is great, a huge improvement compared to the previous release and seems to stick his lower register, trying to not overextend his range. He also seems to have injected a fire into his vocal style that wasn't there previously, carrying to a raw aggressiveness. Murray shows a clean lead guitar and lots of blistering solos. What about Gers? He is by far the best performer on this album. Nicko\u2019s drumming is semi-godly, with a great use of insane fills, then you find lots of matched bass lines which adds some good licks here and there, giving as a result, a great performance from a great bassist leader.\n\nThese 8-10 minutes long songs seem to be ranted to no end before the popular opinion, but I don't feel they deserve this. They begin great, the opening melodies have a very strong, epic feeling. The first minutes of the songs are some of the best ones, even then, they managed to carry the song. They gain to maintain the epic feel which opening created, and that is such a plus. Songs are more expressive and more honest than any Maiden work since then. A fresh and unique offering that takes the darker styles to their logical path, although some would say the wrong kind one.\n\nThere are things I liked about the album, and mostly in packaging. The art and title, regardless they're not what I expected from Iron Maiden, I take that as a surprise in some way. The single \"The Angel and The Gambler\" shows a beautifully rendered art which reminds the Gamma Ray ones. With the album's full release, I laid eyes upon a covered that does, in my opinion, live up to any of the 80s covers, as is for the fact that Maiden is heavily influenced by bands like UFO. Regardless the questions surrounding the cover and title, I will support the band until they're starting to play again the 45-50 min full-lengths instead of the \"progressives\" ones they're doing now.\n\nSo, this album has songs with really cool moments. Is not that repetitive like their new albums with annoying and poor moments, which manages to ruin their songs that could've been all-time Iron Maiden classics, on this one they still can take the bombastic choirs further. It'll be interesting to see at least one album with the same Virtual XI sound. I think and hope, that it'll be heavy, of course, if they want to release their last gasp.\n",
        "\nFrom the very moment I began my journey into the realms of metal music, Iron Maiden has been presented as a pioneering stalwart in the era of NWOBHM. The band was an underground sensation delivering two phenomenal albums to begin their career. Their fusion of punk with catchy soaring riffs became the iconic sound of this colossal band. Moving forward to the next record, the band members felt the need to go in a different direction to rise to the top. We all know what happens next; Paul Di'Anno is dumped for the operatic Bruce Dickinson and the rest is history. However, it's high time we come to the overwhelming realization that The Number of The Beast is not the paramount classic so many have claimed it to be. Yes, this record helped launch their career but it can be argued that Iron Maiden was riding a tidal wave of popularity as a result of their previous efforts. The third album was going to sell no matter how much forgettable material was imbedded throughout the record. \n\nI know what you're all thinking, \"How can you deny Number of The Beast as a classic!\" and before you blow out the few remaining cells you rub together in your cerebrum to formulate half-intellectual thoughts, let me state my case against this album. I cannot deny that some of Iron Maiden's finest work was constructed for this album. The infectious anthems of \"Run To The Hills\" and the title track are undeniable classics that will be lauded by generations to come. The harrowing epic known as \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\" is in my humble opinion the finest composition in their illustrious career. On these standout tracks the tandem of Adrian Smith and Dave Murray shine. These tracks are rife with scorching leads and galloping riffs that would become the signature of Iron Maiden. In his final performance for the band, the late great Clive Burr turns in perhaps his finest effort. Intricate drum patterns that not only assist Smith/Murray but even takes charge at times. These memorable performances, however, are unable to save this album from its low points. When looking over what remains from the highlights there is very little that can be deemed as noteworthy. I'll admit that \"22 Acacia Avenue\" is an above average track but nothing else by any means succeeds to pique my interest. \n\nWe begin with the fast-paced \"Invaders\" equipped with simple but catchy hooks and while I understand that Maiden was going for a more accessible sound this time around, the track falls flat as mere filler pop. What follows is truly irksome as Maiden decides to kill all the momentum with a slow saccharine power ballad \"Children of The Damned\". This pop ballad meanders around a bit before picking up the pace near the end, yet it's a directionless waste that lacks any of the rawness of ballads in prior or later works. Tracks like \"The Prisoner\" and \"Gangland\" have similar issues, they aren't bad songs per se but they lack any conviction. It's overly accessible filler that markets well to a large demographic and leaves no lasting effect. I even find Bruce Dickinson somewhat annoying on theses weaker tracks. He's more nasally than usual and it takes away all the power in the performance. Bruce is a phenomenally talented vocalist but it's on tracks like\"The Prisoner\" where his few weaknesses are more apparent rather than his strengths. As I've stated earlier, I biggest criticism isn't any of the individual performances but inconsistency and dull songwriting that plagues the majority of the album. Iron Maiden is capable of mixing accessibility with the rawness of their earlier work; they successfully did it on Powerslave. On Number of The Beast, however, Maiden is aimless and erratic with an unhealthy amount of cheese. \n\nI probably wouldn't be so harsh on the album if it wasn't constantly ranked near the top of metal's all-time greats. THIS? This is the finest hour for Iron Maiden? Not only did Iron Maiden's previous and later works surpass The Number of The Beast but even the albums that are considered weak by the Maiden faithful trump this supposedly seminal record. I have great respect for the members of Iron Maiden. Steve Harris is a genius and Bruce Dickinson is an incredibly gifted vocalist but given that we know their capabilities, I believe it's only fair we hold them to that standard. 3 great tracks and 1 descent one out of 9 does not make a monumental release. The record is far too inconsistent, especially for an album considered to be Maiden's best by many. As I've stated before, there are some fantastic songs here but a large section of it is rather mediocre. And if we're being completely honest, \"Run to the Hills\" is also a little overrated. I don't need to hear it ever again. It puzzles me why this album is constantly deemed as this grandiose classic when Maiden have written far better works and people only remember a handful of songs from it. The real shame is that this era of Iron Maiden sported some of the most talented individuals and they concocted this turgid carcass of an album.\n\nFreedom of individual thought is most important to me and I strongly encourage those in the metal community to do their own research and come to their own conclusions. Perhaps you still consider this an extraordinary record and you're entitled to that opinion as long as it's your own. Critics and metalheads alike have praised this album without giving it a thorough analysis; blindly concurring on its greatness because Iron Maiden is exempt from any criticism. No band should be granted that privilege and we shouldn't believe Number of The Beast to be good because everybody says so. We in metal demand the freedom of expression and individual preferences but the great hypocrisy is we sometimes expect everyone to like the same things. Love it or hate it, you should form your own opinion of this record.\n",
        "\nThe release of Iron Maiden's Live at Donington is quite questionable for several reasons. First of all, two other live records, entitled A Real Live One and A Real Dead One, had already been released in the same year. This release feels like the band or its label was simply attempting to milk ist cash cow.\n\nSecondly, these two previous live records included many songs that are also included on the set list played at Donington. This release doesn't include any rare tracks or other surprises.\n\nThirdly, the album was only released in limited quantities as if the band knew it wasn't going to equal its previous live records. The whole release strategy seems unconvincing as if the band itself didn't value it enough.\n\nFourthly, the poor cover artwork recalls bootlegs and indicates that this is a quite cheap release. This could be acceptable for an ordinary heavy metal band but for an iconic heavy metal band like Iron Maiden with its unique mascot Eddie, it just doesn't feel right at all.\n\nFifthly, the performance of the band is underwhelming by its own elevated standards. It's obvious that the band was about to break apart as charismatic lead singer Bruce Dickinson would leave the band about a year after this concert was recorded. Even though his interactions with the crowd are solid, his singing performance sounds slightly lackluster and his speeches are often overlong and pointless. The sound of the concert is an issue as well. The guitars sound too thin for a heavy metal release. The drums sound somewhat dry and thin even though they are performed accurately. The bass guitar sounds best here but is too domineering in the production if compared to the other instruments. \n\nNumerous tracks sound powerless such as \"The Number of the Beast\" that is lacking the gloomy grit of the original studio version, the horrible aqualung performance of \"Afraid to Shoot Strangers\" that would be performed much better by Blaze Bayley a few years later and the surprisingly uninspired rendition of the anthemic \"Fear of the Dark\".\n\nHowever, there are also a few positives about what might be Iron Maiden's weakest live record ever. First and foremost, one should purchase the remastered version because it has a much more beautiful cover artwork as well as an extensive booklet and a multimedia section with four video clips from the concert, photo galleries, a short biography and a few internet links. \n\nSecondly, the set list includes at least one track from every single studio album released up to the point when this record saw the light of day. Therefore, this album could serve as some sort of greatest hits compilation and would be an apropriate introduction to new fans if it were only performed better. \n\nThirdly, a few tracks are actually performed rather well. The fan interactions during \"From Here to Eternity\", \"Bring Your Daughter... ...to the Slaughter\" and \"Heaven Can Wait\" are quite enjoyable for instance, These often overlooked live songs should be performed lagain by the band these days.\n\nIn the end, Iron Maiden's Live at Donington is passable but only just. It's by far the band's weakest live album to date. I would only recommend it to avid collectors and faithful fans. If you still want to pick up this average release, make sure to buy the remastered version at least that offers a nice artwork, an extensive booklet and a few extras in the multimedia section.\n",
        "\nThe highlight of Iron Maiden's first live record in almost nine years is the crowd. I've never ever seen or heard a group of fans as enthusiastic as the two hundred fifty thousand people at the Rock in Rio festival. They go completely crazy during the best version of the anthemic \"Fear of the Dark\" that sends constant shivers down my spine for eight unforgettable minutes that I could listen to over and over again. The fan participation is also outstanding during less renowned tracks like the energetic rendition of \"Sanctuary\" where lead singer Bruce Dickinson interacts brilliantly with the unchained crowd. \"The Clansman\" is performed with boundless passion both by the singer and the crowd as they transform a rather calm and introspective epic into a thunderous and passionate anthem.\n\nThe energetic crowd clearly has a positive impact on the whole band as well as Iron Maiden delivers one of its best performances ever. After the catchy and powerful opener \"The Wicker Man\" that is celebrated as much as the band's classics from the eighties, I was already out of breath. Things get even better with the passionate rendition of \"Blood Brothers\" that make for an emotional and haunting experience about loss and togetherness. My personal favorite is however the incredibly atmospheric yet particularly dynamic rendition of \"Sign of the Cross\" where one can see the whole band jumping around and going crazy just like the incredible crowd. Believe me, it's impossible to to sit or stand still while listening to this unexpected highlight.\n\nThe band performance is energetic, the crowd is the best I've ever encountered and the production is vivid, raw and direct. It's difficult to say whether this live album is better than the legendary Live After Death release of the eighties that had an even better set list and more beautiful stage decorations. However, Rock in Rio's fan participation is so outstanding that you won't have a choice but to purchase this incredible release. Up the Irons!\n",
        "\nIron Maiden's Death on the Road was a very important record for me because it was released around the time I really got into heavy metal and discovered this band. I remember purchasing this album a few days after its release with a girl who was rather into commercial rock and punk music and she couldn't believe that this album contained a song breaking the ten-minute mark. I listened to this release over and over again over the weeks and months that followed and it also got some airplay in my favorite metal pubs. One of these pubs still has the beautiful cover artwork of this release on its back door. As you can read, I have a special connection to this album but did it stand the test of time? Yes, it did!\n\nThere are several elements I expect from a convincing live record. First of all, the set list should offer a solid mixture of new song material, some classics and a few hidden gems. That's exactly what we get here. This record includes an epic campfire rendition of the enchanting \"Dance of Death\", sends shivers down the spine with a sinister performance of the anti-war epic \"Paschendale\" and surprises with an intense version of the intelligent acoustic ballad \"Journeyman\". Some of Iron Maiden's greatest hits like a fast and heavy rendition of \"The Trooper\", a dramatic and epic version of \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\" and some great fan interaction in \"Fear of the Dark\" are particularly noteworthy. A quite unusual rendition of \"Lord of the Flies\" can be heard here but the opening guitar riff is out of rhythm and tone and Bruce Dickinson's dramatic vocals can't mess with Blaze Bayley's more appropriate gloomy approach in the original studio version. Along with the bland \"Wrathchild\" and the overtly commercial \"Can I Play With Madness?\", these three songs are the weakest in an overall strong set list.\n\nA live record needs to differ from a studio record and should make the live versions more organic, energetic and creative than the original studio versions. Iron Maiden truly delivers the goods in that regard. The opening operatic overture complements the life-affirming \"Wildest Dreams\" perfectly and starts the show on a high note. The sound of rain makes \"Rainmaker\" even more melancholic. The mysterious speech that introduces \"Dance of Death\" sets the tone for this atmospheric epic. The battlefield sounds and spoken poetry by Bruce Dickinson leading into \"Paschendale\" is haunting and gives this masterpiece an almost cinematic note. If you didn't like the studio record Dance of Death, you should listen to the excellent live versions of its songs and re-evaluate the material properly. If you already liked the studio album, you will love the live versions.\n\nA great live record must convince with tight musicianship where the musicians develop great chemistry. Iron Maiden succeeds overall but could have done even better. The opening notes of \"Wildest Dreams\" sound a little bit too chaotic. The opening riff of \"Lord of the Flies\" is played in an amateurish way. Bruce Dickinson had to deal with a cold which made his vocals sound slightly nasal, especially in \"Lord of the Flies\", even though he still sounds brilliant under those rough circumstances. \n\nFan participation is an essential element of a great live album. The crowd sounds enthusiastic during songs like \"Fear of the Dark\", \"The Number of the Beast\" and \"Run to the Hills\" but one simply can't ignore that Iron Maiden released the excellent Rock in Rio live album three years prior to this record. The Brazilian crowd simply rolls over the more reserved German fans that sound particularly shy in the first half of the show and during the great renditions from Iron Maiden's latest output back in those days.\n\nFinally, a successful live record should have an authentic production. This means that a live album should always sound more direct, powerful and raw than a studio record. Slight imperfections actually make for a certain unique charm. Band members should sound like human beings and not like perfectly synchronized machines. This is definitely the case here as one can hear those little imperfections in form of overloud guitar sounds, a few missed notes in the vocals and a few asychron rhythm changes. Those little details mostly don't sound amateurish and give this release a very proper identity instead. Listening to this album almost makes you feel as if you were part of the crowd. This is the album with the greatest \"live feeling\" Iron Maiden has ever released to date.\n\nIn the end, Iron Maiden's Death on the Road convinces with authentic live atmosphere, great set list and stunning renditions of songs from its overlooked studio record Dance of Death. Objectively, this isn't Iron Maiden's greatest live record which might either be Live After Death or Rock in Rio. However, I find it much more gripping than any of the band's numerous other live releases. This album was basically my introduction into becoming a faithful Iron Maiden fan and I still love it as much as I did many years ago. Occasional, new and faithful fans should check this album out alike. Up the Irons!\n",
        "\nFlight 666 is half concert film, half documentary and essential to the collection of anyone calling himself a heavy metal fan. The artwork looks cool, the extensive thirty-page booklet is of the highest quality and the two discs offer more than three and a half hours of excellent heavy metal entertainment.\n\nThe first part is a documentary of the band's Somewhere Back in Time tour with their own Boeing 757, nicknamed Ed Force One, piloted by lead singer Bruce Dickinson himself. The documentary shows us the complexity of such a tour around the planet, introduces us to legions of enthusiastic Iron Maiden fans from all around the world and gives us a better idea of the six enthusiastic band members who are enjoying themselves on stage like little children. In my opinion, this documentary directed by Canadian heavy metal fans Sam Dunn and Scot McFadyen is one of the very best rock or metal documentaries ever made as every moment is filled with genuine passion for this type of music.\n\nThe second part is the concert movie, consisting of sixteen tracks from the eighties recorded in exotic locations such as Australia, Costa Rica and India. The songs are obviously heavy metal classics and especially the enthusiastic, epic and fast rendition of \"Aces High\", the melancholic performance of \"Wasted Years\" with wonderful backing vocals by Adrian Smith, the atmospheric magnum opus \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\", the energetic and energizing fan participation in \"Heaven Can Wait\" and the often overlooked intellectual and mysterious encore \"Moonchild\" are highlights on this disc. What makes this second disc stand out are however the incredible fan reactions, including a magic moment when you can see a fan cry tears of joy after his idols' concert.\n\nEven about a decade after its inititial release, Flight 666 has stood the test of time as brilliant documentary about the world's greatest heavy metal band. If I had to choose one single release to introduce Iron Maiden to my children, I would pick this one because of its authenticity, energy and joy. Up the Irons!\n",
        "\nWhen I was little (i.e. about 12) I bought an Iron Maiden album. I knew the band name, the cover was interesting, and my dad said that my uncle used to like them. That was enough for me, so I bought Dance of Death. Later that year, I bought the compilation Edward the Great. That compilation contains songs from 1982 to 2000 and four of them are from this album, while even the other classic records only have one or two apiece. I got the picture from those four songs (the two singles, plus 'Infinite Dreams' and 'The Clairvoyant') that this was the most accessible Maiden album. Those four songs were sufficient to prevent me shelling out money for the rest of the album, since I already had half of it - or so I thought - while I bought the other records. Naturally, I made my sister buy No Prayer for the Dying and Fear of the Dark because she didn't know they were weaker than the '80s material. Later, much later, my housemate's girlfriend stashed loads of stuff in our place and told me I could listen to her albums if I liked. One of them was Seventh Son of a Seventh Son.\n\nThat means that, barring the Blaze Bayley albums, this is the Iron Maiden release that I have listened to the least and - truth be told - valued fairly lowly, as an overrated classic. However, a few days ago something terrible happened. Our brother in metal and a tireless contributor to this website died suddenly. Diamhea was not someone I knew on a personal level because I'm not highly sociable, though he worked his hardest to make this website a place of quality information and well-written opinion writing, also finding time to comment on my own work. Apart from a bit of competitive banter about the Reviews Challenge, the last words he addressed to me personally were, \"Remember - someone is always paying attention.\" The news of his death hit me hard and, the morning when I heard about it, I turned to Iron Maiden like other people turn to comfort food. For no particular reason, I turned to this album - a concept release about a novel I don't know and don't care about. But by the end of 45 minutes, I knew it was the right choice. Not only because of the fragile nostalgia that drifts off the opening of 'Infinite Dreams' like wisps of incense smoke. Not only because of that slip of the mind when 'The Evil That Men Do' appears to open with the line \"Life is a razor and I walk the line on that silver blade.\" Not only because of the path to another world that opens midway through the title track, as we wait with baited breath for the four way duel of the solo section that intermingles the essences of the angelic and demonic. Not only because of the existential questions flicked back and forth in the chorus of 'The Clairvoyant'. Not only because of the pure poignancy evaporating off 'Only the Good Die Young' like the dew rising into the spring air as I left the house a few minutes later. Not only each of those things, but so much more as well.\n\nI won't pretend that I have developed an unrestrained devotion to Seventh Son, but I certainly saw the merits of the album much more clearly in light of those thoughts about Diamhea. I still stand by my first instinct that this is a more accessible album than all those that came before and those that followed, though that largely comes down to the marvellous flow of ideas and the sparkling clarity of the production, as well as a larger than life performance by Bruce Dickinson. I rubbished some of the lyrics on Somewhere in Time and refuse to believe that more than 10 minutes were put into the words for 'D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu', but the themes chosen here are all eternally relevant and eloquently delivered. The exception is for 'The Prophecy', which suffers the most from the specificity of some of the images chosen (presumably from the novel), as well as a loose groove in the verses that Maiden had written before and much better at that. 'Moonchild' is not bereft of the same particularity, yet the artful way in which the song develops gives greater credence to its conceptual aspirations.\n\nWhat makes Seventh Son of a Seventh Son an exceptional album is just that which makes it easy to accuse of being overrated. There is never a moment the listener feels pulled into the experience by an outstanding detail or sudden change in direction, since the smoothness of progress during each of the songs leaves nary a ripple in that frosty blue of the album's artwork. Listening to the building of layers towards the end of 'The Clairvoyant' gives one the feeling of gliding across the tops of mountains and swooping in over the tumbling source of a stream, feeling light-headed with the wind striking against cool flesh, seeing the stream expand to a vast river and eventually soaring above the open expanse of the sea as if being released from the narrow restrictions of this world. The synths used at this period in Maiden's history certainly play a part in that feeling of freedom and release, as does the airily light melodic work of Adrian Smith and Dave Murray, though the album sounds a great deal less aggressive than the similarly constructed Somewhere in Time. Steve Harris is a little lower in the mix and slightly more in harmony with the guitars, which is a blessing for the movements like that of the title track, during which he solos alongside the guitars in alternate bouts of sublimity and technicality, while Nicko McBrain all the while acts as the stream's muddy banks to keep the twinkle of the water safe in the channel. The bridging riffs of that lead section are some of the finest that Maiden crafted in their career. Artfully twisting and discordant rhythm guitar also marks the verses of 'Moonchild' in a manner that intoxicates by stages, keeping the listener at bay through initial exposures and the perplexity of the chorus melody's untimely swish, until at last the fluency of the transitions becomes apparent.\n\nWhile 'Can I Play With Madness' and 'The Evil That Men Do' prove evidence to the contrary, there is much to say for Seventh Son being Maiden's most progressive album, certainly when considering that their more recent output has inflated the song lengths without the richness of content that can be described in the songs here. Powerful numbers like 'The Clairvoyant' and the lead-drenched circumspection of 'Infinite Dreams' prove that an abundance of ideas need not take away from the immediate and anthemic qualities of a song, while even 'The Prophecy' breaches classical realms of instrumental interplay in a stunning, yet brief, mid-section that soothes the sting of the cumbersome verses. Despite enviable chorus construction, I feel that 'Can I Play With Madness' is an ounce too obvious as a hit single attempt to entirely benefit the experience, though I certainly believe that the album as a whole is a smarter and smoother version of what Maiden had attempted on the previous release and clearly the pinnacle of their efforts as songwriters. Perhaps it is just the lateness of realization that makes one appreciate quality all the more. In any case, just as this album flows by as seamlessly as a stream in its endless search for the sea, so do we all flow on to the same place. Though the music is over, the echoes will never fade.\n",
        "\nAnd \u2026 here we go. Again. Yet another Maiden live album. How many are there now? Like, one hundred fifty-seven or something? Come on. Do we really need this?\n\nFrankly, the answer is yes, and there is a logical explanation for it. First, this isn\u2019t exactly new material since most of the songs were already released in 1989 as a live video on VHS cassette. (All you younglings out there, go ask your momma or poppa what a VHS actually was.) Second, it contains a number of tracks that haven\u2019t appeared on any official Maiden live albums before or after, as well as a track which, at least to my knowledge, cannot be found on any other official live release with Bruce Dickinson behind the microphone.\n\nHaving never heard the original VHS release from the very late eighties, I would assume the live recording was polished up and remastered for this re-release on CD, as the sound quality is surprisingly high. It is also noticeably better than on the couple of songs from this show that were included as bonus material on the 2-CD re-release of the Seventh Son of a Seventh Son album from the mid nineties. Long story short, the sound quality on this two-disc version of Maiden England is excellent, particularly considering the age of the original recording.\n\nThe songs on display were put to tape on two consecutive nights that saw the band play sold-out shows at the N.E.C. in Birmingham, England, in late November 1988. The concerts were part of the band\u2019s so-called \u201cSeventh Tour of a Seventh Tour\u201d, promoting, of course, their wildly successful Seventh Son of a Seventh Son album. You would therefore expect to hear quite a lot of Seventh Son material here, and indeed the only tracks from that record that are not represented are \u201cThe Prophecy\u201d and \u201cOnly the Good Die Young\u201d. Having been released as a single, \u201cCan I Play with Madness\u201d is not omitted here, though it would have been quite a treat to see the underrated \u201cOnly the Good Die Young\u201d included instead.\n\nAnyway, it\u2019s still awesome to finally get great and exclusive live renditions of \u201cMoonchild\u201d, \u201cInfinite Dreams\u201d and, most of all, the title track of the eponymous album, \u201cSeventh Son of a Seventh Son\u201d. \u201cThe Evil that Men Do\u201d and \u201cThe Clairvoyant\u201d used to be live staples for quite some time and can be found on many other Maiden live albums as well, but the versions on Maiden England sound excellent none the less. There are also two tracks from the Somewhere in Time album, which is great but would be even better had they chosen some other song from that amazing album instead of the oft-heard \u201cHeaven Can Wait\u201d. (\u201cThe Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner\u201d or \u201cAlexander the Great\u201d immediately come to mind.) Even so, \u201cHeaven Can Wait\u201d is a very good song in its own right and \u201cWasted Years\u201d is one of those you can never quite get enough of.\n\nOther particular highlights include rare live versions of \u201cStill Life\u201d and \u201cDie with Your Boots on\u201d, both of which originally appeared on the Piece of Mind album, and of course \u201cKillers\u201d. This is perhaps the only official live recording of this classic Maiden track with Bruce Dickinson handling the vocals, and even though the Paul Di\u2019Anno fan club might want to kill me for writing this, I\u2019d have to say he does a very good job with it. He\u2019s not trying to reinvent it in any way, delivering it with the kind of bilious aggression that used to be his predecessor\u2019s calling card.\n\nThe undisputed cherry on top of the cake, however, is the aforementioned \u201cSeventh Son of a Seventh Son\u201d, a ten-minute epic delivered in most convincing fashion. If in any way possible, this live rendition is even better and more energetic than the studio version. Considering what an intricate and multi-layered masterpiece of a song this is, the way Maiden flawlessly and vigorously pull it off in a live setting is a testament to their skill as musicians and on-stage performers. I will readily confess that the first time I listened to this gem, it almost left me gaping with awe.\n\nOkay, enough with the fanboyish adulation. One of the very few downsides of this release is that compared to the DVD version that came out the same year, some of the little speeches Bruce gives to the audience in between songs were left out. This certainly isn\u2019t a big deal, but since Bruce\u2019s stage antics are often quite entertaining it would have been nice to see them included in their entirety. Another minor flaw is the way some of the songs are played a little too fast for their own good, particularly with regard to \u201cWasted Years\u201d and \u201cHallowed Be Thy Name\u201d. Then again, the abundant aggression and adrenaline is always part of the special charm of a metal live recording. Finally, the sing-along games Bruce plays with the audience in the middle of the penultimate encore, \u201cRunning Free\u201d, aren\u2019t nearly as much fun listening to a live CD as they might have been while watching the real thing in a packed concert venue.\n\nIn conclusion, while you can always question the need for yet another Maiden live album, it\u2019s hard to find fault with such an album when the finished product is of such undeniable quality. The band is on fire, the set list is outstanding and perhaps the best of any Maiden live release, and the recording quality is easily good enough considering those shows were performed roughly thirty years ago. Or, as Mr. Dickinson might say: Scream for me, N.E.C! Screeeaaaam for meeeee, N.E.C!!!\n",
        "\nSomewhere in Time was such a musical peak for the Irons, their most musically complex album so far, and without surprise it spawned an equally successful tour. All that excellence however, wasn't universally acclaimed though, for since there's been heavy metal music, there have also been overcritical fans and non-conformists of many types. I'm not saying I'm not one of them in some instances, but some people back then took the inclusion of synthesized guitars as a personal offense, and perhaps even Iron Maiden itself wasn't satisfied with that experiment. In any case, for their seventh album, they decided to play it somewhat safe, and return to basic rock instrumentation, with the inclusion of keyboards to replace the synth sound. Thus arrived Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, another milestone of classic heavy metal, as it is clear Maiden during the 80s were incapable of any flaws (aside from mixing cavemen with dinosaurs in lyrics). \n\nFor Iron Maiden, this is their mandatory 'concept album' that most well established bands with creative ambition attempt at least once in their career. Concept albums are also met with mixed reactions by fans, some hail them as masterpieces of their respective creators, while others, preferring the more straightforward song-oriented approach, deride them as pompous and pretentious. The concept album thing got a major boost in the 70s, with many great prog rock bands releasing one or several of them, probably inspired by The Who's Tommy (a very fucked up concept, if one stops to analyze it), not the first, but probably the most famous and influential of such type of records. And it is precisely that previous decade and its spearheading movement in rock music, the principal influence for this particular record, even though Iron Maiden had always incorporated classic prog aesthetics in some degree, starting with \u201cPhantom of the Opera\u201d from their debut. But speaking of the concept at hand, it is basically a Good VS Evil plot involving the titular character, so there's nothing too outstanding here in that regard. \n\nMusically, Seventh Son of a Seventh Son is not particularly more complex than the Irons two previous LPs, with the probable exception of track number two, \u201cInfinite Dreams\u201d, arguably the most complicated composition the band attempted in their career, with a cascading succession of different sections that would inspire many prog metal bands to come, and a highlight of this record. But even though the band plays with different tempos and abrupt changes in most songs, there's also a general increased sense of accessibility, all the vocal parts and chorus in particular, have a more focal point in the tunes. \u201cCan I Play with Madness?\u201d is the prime example of this, with Bruce being the obvious star, being backed up during the chorus by some Van Halen-esque background keyboards. Again, that's something that wasn't enjoyed by every Maiden fan at the time, but to my ears there's nothing wrong with it. Yes, the song is concise and was composed as a single, but it is catchy, memorable, and still has a potent display of Iron Maiden's virtuosity in every instrument, during every second of its duration. \n\nThe same characteristics can be applied to another of the timeless classics originated here, \u201cThe Evil that Men Do\u201d. It has the signature Iron Maiden rhythmic galloping, and some of Bruce's more heartfelt vocals of their entire discography, and it comprises one of their more straightforward tunes here as well, which works in its favor to achieve anthem status. Speaking of the Air Raid Dickinson himself, I start to feel some minor strain in his vocals here, something that would increase during the 90s, in the disappointing No Prayer for the Dying, the marginally less mediocre Fear of the Dark and all the subsequent live releases up to his parting with the band. Never been quite sure what happened to him, but for Brave New World he sounded rejuvenated and empowered again, thankfully. \n\nI've never been much of a fan of \u201cThe Clairvoyant\u201d, enjoying the lyrics but not that much the composition itself, being my least preferred track here, but still is and has the classic Maiden feel. In its defense, however, it hosts a masterful bass display by Steve Harris, who also plays a brief but kick-ass solo during closer \u201cOnly the Good Die Young\u201d, a helluva track that just like previous album's closer \u201cD\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu\u201d, remains one of the most criminally underrated and underplayed songs of their entire repertoire. The towering title-track is simply fantastic and 100% epic (even though that word seems to have loss meaning in the latest years), and has a monstrous and explosive guitar-played conclusion courtesy of dynamic duo Murray and Smith. Their collaboration would be their last for Iron Maiden until the new century, when Iron Maiden evolved into a three-headed six-string entity. \u201cThe Prophecy\u201d is another low profile but excellent tune in which the duo employs tasty acoustic guitars, along its electric potency. \n\nAs for the unique Nicko McBrain, what can be said that hasn\u2019t been said yet? His playing here is again stellar, leaving the listener in awe and wondering what he'll hit next, being such a free flowing player with a great personality behind the kit that makes me think, either he or Harris are the least replaceable elements in the band. Well, aside for Eddie, who has undertaken a surreal transformation for the album cover, worthy of Salvador Dal\u00ed or Max Ernst. But one has to give credit where credit is due, and the frozen graphic masterpiece that completes this mystic metal masterpiece is another monumental work of Derek Riggs. He too, would suffer a diminished form for Maiden during the disrespectful 90s. \n\nBasically, all songs that comprise the story of the Seventh Son of a Seventh Son are top-notch specimens of classic Iron Maiden, and aside for a few minor personal qualms, I see no reason to rate this outstanding 1988 record lower than the masterpiece status it deserves. A good place to start enjoying the Irons, for rookies, as good as any other of their classic 80s material, even though, perhaps the best way would be to follow the chronological order.\n",
        "\nIron Maiden is considered by most people, even by the non-experts, as the representative heavy metal band. Their first album was the first step for this. In my opinion, an album whose style would not characterize them yet. Since listening to this stuff, I think it's a new, charming experiment, a kind of \"let's see how this will turn into a metal sellout\". The sharp contrast between Dennis Stratton's guitars with Murray's strong rock base of personality, also mixed with a Harris who had everything planned, and a Clive Burr who magnifies any rhythm with his class and ideas... as a result, we can see excellent set of songs superbly achieved, even without compacting and defining completely, but pointing upwards. History has shown how Steve Harris knew how \"to pray\" hard and take advantages of this initial momentum as anyone else could not. Paul Di'Anno seems to move very comfortably in group's context; even when responsibility and discipline overwhelmed him, but above all he looks nice and jovial. Maybe he was thinking: \"Let's see what singing is like\". What many see is his unique talent, maybe he doesn't believe it, but looks like he doesn't care about. Paul compensates any possible lacking with his invincible twenty-something-years-old talent.\n\nIron Maiden presents their debut as a virtuous offer, the instrumental Transilvania developed real arrangements, solos and \"conversations\" between guitars, sounding very \"oiled\", a marvel thing which live recordings attest at that moment. Since then, every time when a musician left the group (who did parade one by one in early years), the substitute was forced to trap the band's body/soul and participating entirely on the creation of unstoppable musical synergy. Well, there are songs with fast, intricate passages, songs with an authentic marathon of riffs that every band would like to try ever. More youthful songs like the self-titled one compensate the result with their lighter structures, and with a more comfortable listening. The frenzy in Phantom of the Opera is equivalent to the songs you would consider insignificant. For insignificance, let's leave that award to Sun and Steel or Quest for Fire. What an irrelevance in such a disc, right?\n\nEven though the production does not live up to their extraordinary successor (I hallucinate with Martin Birch production on Killers, damn!), it's still incredibly good, and better than Rocka Rolla. Judas Priest released Rocka Rolla after 5 years of formation like Maiden, but that album was a release without a fixed direction, an album that was adapted to the standards of progressive rock at that time, a good one, but their real debut was Sad Wings of Destiny. I remember when I first heard Phantom of the Opera in 2011, from a live version with Bruce's vocals. Then, when I heard the studio version I was a bit disappointed, because I didn't know Paul Di'anno and because it lacked the frenzy that live version did. In the end, it cost to chew it but thanks to the visceral range of Di'anno in Killers, he was able to convince me. Obviously, about the band, I realized later that all of their songs have more prominence live (which happens the opposite with Megadeth, although I still like that band).\n\nThe doll that looks at us from the cover art didn't know that he would give success to the group later, I guess he didn't even know that his name was Eddie, and who expected an urgent hairdressing session just to travel to the world like the giant heads of my town's great party. But I think Steve Harris was making an idea for the future, you know these things when you provoke it.\n",
        "\nA Matter of Life and Death supposed perhaps a before and after in Maiden's neo-discography. In fact, Steve Harris considers Brave New World and AMOLAD as the two masterpieces of the band since 2000. However, I'm in dissonance with him, since Dance of Death must be included; would be a trilogy in any case. A Matter of Life and Death is an album to sit on the sofa with an evening coffee, so you can contemplate each of its nuances and guitar layers in the course of dusk. You can see that they're trying to sound old here, like in old days, as a mixture of Piece of Mind and Powerslave. It's an error to demand the members be the same as 30 years ago. Everything evolves. You won't expect or demand the same from guys of 20-year-olds at their peak to 50-year-olds sirs with grandchildren.\n\nThe best thing they ever did is playing the whole album live, so don't complain. I can't conceive that a Maiden fan gets bored when he hears the \"All the nations are rising...\" which Dickinson waves so emotional in Brighter Than A Thousand Suns, or Murray's solo in The Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg, or the glorious refrain of For The Greater Good of God, or the riff in which Lord Of Light breaks (if you don't like that riff, the one of Die With Your Boots On or the one of Two Minutes To Midnight neither), come on. The production is raw and direct, but crystalline at the same time, especially in introductions. Personality: that's what Maiden did record on this disc, they don't have to please their fans, the music is much more than that, the easiest thing to do after Seventh Son is to repeat that album over and over; but friends, they're not like that, they carry the musical restlessness in their veins. Anyone who wants to listen the eighties Maiden forever, just put those old records and period.\n\nI enjoy when someone comes here to contrarian saying bands like Priest and Maiden have been finished since 90' and 92' respectively. But when you see that discs like AMOLAD are discovered among the favorites of some people, I already tell you that SOMETHING they have. It's not like I'm going to consider that they are lacking criteria when it comes to ranting some album of a great band, just leave it to the rats who pullulate through the network calling fanboy to anyone who's put in his front as if gives him a supreme value. The \"No Prayer of the Dying\" matter will fall under its own weight, it's just a mediocre record compared to previous ones. Regarding AMOLAD, it is probably the most complex record hardest to value in Maiden's whole catalog. Also, someday, it will wise up.\n\nSince I'm a Latino fan, something curious I had to experience is that many people around me who are not metalheads have come to say that Maiden has a \"romantic\" style, and they say it for songs like Different World, No More Lies and several ones from Brave New World. I don't really know what they want to say with \"romantic style\", this has nothing to do with lyrics, maybe the vocal patterns of Dickinson since Brave New World remember a lot the vocal lines of some Latin singers who are very known here (And I admit that Maiden provoke me a Dejav\u00fa for that matter). Overall, I think Maiden has a small problem regarding repetitions of riffs and choruses, there are songs that should last less than they are. Some consider it their last masterpiece, on the other hand, we have aggressive streams who consider it as a failed experiment which they could not emerge from. In any case, I love Iron Maiden, but I think they're neither the panacea of musical excellence nor the supreme originality of it. That is.\n",
        "\nI will never, ever get tired of this album. Specifically I will never get tired of the closing triumvirate of Back In the Village, the title track and The Rime of the Ancient Mariner. Yes, I included Back In The Village amongst that bunch. This wonderful speed metal ode to the Prisoner sounds like Hot For Teacher put through the most hilarious game of telephone and out pops this hybrid of thrash and swing. But I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nIn what must have resulted in the most disappointing schoolyard roulette games of \"which Iron Maiden member will be replaced next,\" across the world, Powerslave finds the Piece of Mind lineup not only intact, but having gelled together after a year better than most lineups do after five years. Every member of the band reaches the peak of their instrumental game here, and it is not a peak that will disappear after one album (though it might start to erode live performance wise as a result of too many booked dates on the World Slavery Tour, but I digress). Dave Murray and Adrian Smith become the best riffing and soloing twin guitar act in the business, executing rhythm tracks that, sure, you could make like James Hetfield and down-pick them, but why would you want to give yourself carpal-tunnel syndrome in your twenties? Nicko McBrain becomes the greatest one kick-pedal drummer alive, Bruce, while shedding most of the Samson gang viciousness, has fully blossomed into the greatest mid-range vocalist in metal, possibly even music, and Steve Harris has finally managed to erect that larger than the real Stonehenge sized middle finger to all the misers who \"liked Maiden when they were more punk.\" This was never, EVER supposed to be a punk band you wankers, the self-titled and Killers albums were just larvae stages that were slowly budding to this overdue inductee to the Library of Congress. As a bass player especially, he has brilliant moments all over the album but where he seems to shine the most are on the songs he didn't even write, practically stealing the show right back under from Adrian and Bruce.\n\nSome critics would say that sometimes 80's Maiden epics go on for too long, and where I come from thems are fightin' words. But that said, there is one teensy, tiny nitpick I have with this album that prevents me from awarding the full 100. The soloing section of the Duelists just goes on for too long. There's even an awkward moment at 4:38 where everyone, including the listener is wondering \"weren't we talking about a sword fight?\" I also concede that maybe, just maybe, this same argument could be made for 2 Minutes To Midnight. Say what you will about Gangland, but it is not too long.\n\nBut let's talk about the positives, like the fact that the harmony riff to Aces High is so perfectly realized in the studio, it seems practically impossible to play live without eliminating that atonal harmonic (or at least the one that sounds like it's being played by an amateur). Let's talk about Losfer Words, a very strong contender for the greatest instrumental of Maiden's career. The only other piece keeping it from taking the top spot in metal is The Call of Ktulu (and La Villa Strangiato, if your definition of metal stretches to that. Mine does, but others don't). Let's talk about how Bruce Dickinson (with a little arranging help from Steve) came up with arguably the 7th wonder of Maiden's catalogue, the title track. Those Phrygian scale riffs in the verse AND in the pre-chorus! That Master of Puppets breakdown two years before Master of Puppets with a lead solo from Dave Murray that so fucking good and integral to the song you feel he deserves songwriting credits for it. By the way, in case anyone thinks that absolutely sublime third guitar solo at 4:41 is Adrian, it is in fact Dave. Adrian's solo at 3:55 is certainly nothing to sneeze at, but this is one of two times where it's not even close, and he is hopelessly outclassed by Dave Murray.\n\nThen there are the two songs which for many people, are the be all, end all of Iron Maiden. The first is 2 Minutes To Midnight, and you won't hear any arguments for me. Apologies to Swords & Tequila, Stand Up & Shout and a plethora of others, but for my money Adrian Smith created the definitive version of this riff. Even if you disagree, fear not, for there are two more absolutely lethal riffs in the song that steal the show, and they are in the pre-chorus and chorus! It's slightly unfortunate that we don't get to hear these riffs on their own without vocals, but part of what makes classic heavy metal so fucking great is breaking the songs down by their components and not just discovering some chords, but fascinating pieces that could have been made songs on their own. Bruce of course, delivers an absolutely harrowing analysis of war so compelling they needed to make its own Eddie single cover for it (ok, Maiden do that with all the singles, but there's something about this song's message that just can't be communicated with ancient Egypt). Not to mention the brilliant bass licks Steve throws in before each successive verse of the song. Then of course, there is the Rime of the Ancient Mariner. Now, cards on the table, this song is not my favorite Iron Maiden epic. I can honestly say I'd rather hear maybe 7 or 8 other Maiden epics before this one. That said, I do not dare deny a millisecond of this song's accomplishments. Bringing a Samuel Taylor Coleridge poem to life in music, and making the track just as epic as the original is not just something your average Mick Mars can do after his morning piss yet before he's had his coffee. Nicko McBrain in particular shines on this track, and Steve is more than happy to percussively sync up him as part of bass duties. \n\nEven the lost souls who think Number of the Beast is overrated think Powerslave is amazing. It is practically its own tier in the world of music. One could argue that they were never this on point again. I disagree, but I at least understand. Fun final fact: at my dad's house, a copy of the jewel-case album on CD from the 80s somehow magically appeared in his house. Both of my parents hated metal so it wasn't theirs and they assumed it was mine. I have no idea where it came from, and the CD was missing. I simply kept it as a spare copy in case my actual CD case went missing. I consider it a sign, from Yahweh, Buddha, Jesus and Allah all conspiring together to tell me, yes, Powerslave really is that great.\n",
        "\nWell, this is it. The finest album Maiden ever crafted; The album that would inspire a thousand bands in almost as many genres; Hell, maybe even proof for an infinitely loving deity (I refuse to believe mere chance made this album happen). All kidding aside, this is my favorite Iron Maiden album (Sorry Powerslave!), my favorite heavy metal album of all time, and quite possibly my favorite album in general.\n\nLet's get straight into why this album is so great, starting with the guitar synths: Yeah, they're different, but they add to the atmosphere in a way I never thought possible. If there was ever the retro-future that this album's cover predicted, the synths would feel right at home. The bizarre way they simultaneously sound natural and artificial from the distortion and the instrument that they come from have a unique feeling to them that no keyboard could ever reproduce (more about this in a Seventh Son review) and really do give this album an otherworldly aura that, in my mind, has never been done before or since.\n\nOn that note, I feel the need to compare this album to Judas Priest's Turbo. Don't worry, I'll be brief. Whereas Priest had a nasty habit of trying to reinvent the wheel every couple of albums or so (Turbo being one such example), Maiden simply used all the fancy new 80's tech to simply make the logical follow-up to Powerslave in Somewhere in Time. The same proto-power metal paradigms, the same intelligent riffing, the same over the top vocals of Bruce, just bigger and better in every way. \n\nGranted, there are some who think Powerslave is the better album, and in some ways they might be right: I could talk about this album getting no live time compared to the former, but then I'd be here all day. To that end though, I say that Somewhere in Time is a much better album (i.e. whole experience). Each song flows effortlessly to the next, and all 51:24 are enjoyable. The songs are closer in length than most Maiden albums, and while that does mean the run time of each is longer than usual, it never feels over-bloated and none of the songs overstay their welcome. Even the mini-epic \"Alexander the Great\" is straight to the point for a Maiden epic song.\n\nOn that note, the song writing is the most solid Maiden's career would ever be, with some of the best performances the band would ever put out for each member, from Bruce's evil laughs all the way to Nicko's running-like drumming on \"The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner\" (a heavily underappreciated classic, I might add. Go listen to Disarmonia Mundi's cover. Good stuff.). The solos, the production, the cover art, the lyrics (in all their 80s cheese), EVERYTHING, all incredible.\n\nI briefly touched on the atmosphere of the album, but I feel the need to expand upon it more: the retro-future mood gives this album an unshakeable feel no other Maiden (or anyone else, really) album would ever quite replicate, putting this album in a weird (but excellent) category all to its own. More refined than Powerslave. More surreal than Seventh Son. For example, \"Heaven Can Wait\" has both the prog elements of Seventh Son while still keeping the adventurous feel of Powerslave. It's this \"all of Iron Maiden's best aspects at once\" attribute that makes, to me at least, the best damn metal album to ever be released.\n\nThe thing what saddens me the most about this album is how it has, ironically, been mostly lost to time. Yes, the influence can be heard from europower to melodeath to everything in between, but as an album Somewhere in Time is mostly relegated to \"That album cyborg Eddie comes from\". Outside of the radio friendly \"Wasted Years\", Maiden itself rarely plays any songs here. In a odd way, though, it adds to the mystic aura of this album, in a \"too good to be touched\" kind of way. Whatever. I'm just happy that I exist in the time where Somewhere in Time exists.\n\nHighlights:\n-All of it, but especially \"Caught Somewhere in Time\", \"The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner\", and \"Alexander the Great\"\n",
        "\nJudas Priest. Yeah, since Day 1 of my personal heavy metal experience, I\u2019ve always preferred the falsetto screaming and singing of Rob Halford over Dickinson\u2019s distinctive wailing, the thrashier, and meaner approach reverberating off Downing\u2019s and Tipton\u2019s guitar fret-boards in the secondary prime of their career (PAINKILLER!) over the perhaps more adventurous guitar stylings of Murray & Smith and the monstrous drumming of Scott Travis over the more restrained, traditional leanings of Nicko McBrain. \n\nThen, a few years ago, after a whole decade of jumping onto the Judas Priest side of the everlasting \u2013 and to be honest, very ridiculous \u2013 debate about who\u2019s the better band of the two, I decided to check out the highly acclaimed \u201cRock in Rio\u201d live DVD. I don\u2019t remember how I even got the idea that this could change my mind but it most certainly did. Why? Because these guys totally outperform their studio personae here, you can see, hear and feel that they are absolutely into it, creating more vivid versions of classics that had already gathered some dust over the decades. Also, that Brazilian audience is ON FIRE and I\u2019m glad this live recording was made a few years before the tiresome smartphone-crowds started neutering the experience. \n\nYou know, I most certainly acknowledge the importance of early Iron Maiden, but for me the later, more progressive efforts like \u201cSeventh Son of a Seventh Son\u201d or \u201cBrave New World\u201d are among their strongest releases and that\u2019s probably the reason why I\u2019m enjoying this live record more than I had initially expected. \u201cThe Evil That Men Do\u201d, \u201cBlood Brothers\u201d and especially the title track off \u201cBrave New World\u201d are so well presented here, the latter two are even outclassing the original album tracks due to Bruce Dickinson\u2019s motivating interaction with the crowd and his unbridled energy displayed on stage. \n\nThe biggest surprise though is probably the inclusion and execution of the Blaze-era tracks \u201cSign of the Cross\u201d and \u201cThe Clansman\u201d which absolutely blow the dry and lifeless originals out of the water, not only due to Dickinson\u2019s superior handling of the vocals but also because of the larger-than-life sound created by the mighty guitar-triumvirate known as Smith, Murray & Gers. Watching Jannick\u2019s seemingly effortless playing in all kinds of positions (he seems to enjoy himself the most out of the three and that is a tough task) is a lot of fun, if a bit frustrating for a struggling guitar player like myself\u2026oh and of course I can't leave out Steve Harris, whose stage presence and bass playing (electric and acoustic) is obviously totally on par with the overall high quality standard offered here and I think he's always been one of the more amazing bassists in heavy metal. \n\nOf course, the massive production of this concert helps a lot in bolstering said larger-than-life sound to even planetary scales. It is an absolutely flawless display of mixing and mastering skill. The amount of work that went into the visuals of this DVD is astonishing as well - there are tons of different cameras present, showing the band from virtually every possible angle. \n\n\u2026and still, sometimes Bruce Dickinson\u2019s vocal are grating to my ears. He will never be my favorite vocalist, even though he\u2019s an amazing performer to this day. All respect to him, but his higher register is mostly irritating, especially when he has to belt out drawn-out syllables within a short time frame, like \u201cfear of the daaaaa-A-RK\u201d or \u201cnowhere left to run, navi-GA-TO-RS son\u201d where it seems as if he\u2019s trailing behind a little bit with the delivery and struggles to finish his line on time. I know I\u2019m quite nit-picky here, but since about everyone and their mothers would sacrifice their firstborn to their God Dickinson, I feel the need to declare myself. His performance is great, his lower range is commanding and sinister (\u201cFear of the Dark\u201d, \u201cHallowed be thy Name!\u201d) but I'm sure I'll never be able to fully enjoy the way he uses his higher register \u2013 a matter of taste, really. \n\nIn conclusion, \u201cRock in Rio\u201d is one of the most intriguing live records I\u2019ve ever witnessed and if you have not heard it yet, you are most definitely missing out, especially if you are having difficulties getting into the band. That's why I'm recommending this DVD as the best introduction to Iron Maiden to those (do these people still exist?) who have never listened to the band before or to those who prefer their later stuff over their earliest albums, since it features some of their best mid-era material ever, enriched by a bombastic performance of a veteran band and pushed to the maximum by being treated perfectly sonically in the post-production process. \n\nMandatory tracks: \u201cBrave New World\u201d, \u201cBlood Brothers\u201d, \u201cSign of the Cross\u201d and \u201cFear of the Dark\u201d\n\noriginally written for http://antichristmagazine.com\n",
        "\nI always say it, I love their old stuff but since Bruce\u2019s and Adrian\u2019s comeback, I think the band are better musically, technically, and miles better if we talk about live shows and performances. It must be hard to fill Steve Harris' shoes as Iron Maiden's legacy compels his crew to keep raising the bar - a heavy load indeed. Of course, there's a thin line between a band's goals and its fans' demands; consider it artistic self-actualisation versus mass expectations. That said, the latent sextet has always prided itself on foregoing concessions while trusting its instincts and not yielding to the status quo, i.e. any pre-conceived dictates concerning its destiny or path. This reflection is warranted when contemplating a new Maiden album as there's no point in judging its merits on individual tracks alone. However, looking at the big picture, its astounding polarity and variance provides the listener with a better understanding of the band's evolution. In other words, The Final Frontier is the \"natural conclusion\" for a band of Iron Maiden's high calibre (and consistency). Stagnant art - always rehashing the same type of album - loses its appeal and magic over time; from this standpoint, change is imperative. One could go even further and call it a matter of \"life and death\".\n\nFollowing a couple of widely acclaimed, back-to-back multitudinous Somewhere Back In Time Tours and disclosure of its next album (Brave New World, recorded at the legendary Compass Point Studios in Nassau, Bahamas - a favourite haunt as attested by several past gems) Iron Maiden unequivocally caught the attention of its many fans, who'd anticipated the band would somehow re-connect with its glorious and insurmountable past: namely the 1980's, which saw the advent of five epochal landmark albums ranging from 1982's The Number of the Beast to 1988's Seventh Son of a Seventh Son. However, that wasn't the case as the boys unalterably forged on with the same musical pattern marked by Bruce Dickinson and Adrian Smith's return. The band's creative essence remained incredibly hermetic, intact and unalterable despite bombarding its fans - notably those who followed said tours - with nostalgic \"80s\" era stimuli. Essentially, The Final Frontier trumps Dance of Death while jockeying to outrank the aforementioned Brave New World. Although its initial brightness and immediate impact may not match the latter's, they sure as heck grow with every listen.\n\n\"Mother of Mercy\" is one of the best cuts on the record as its Jethro Tull sounding, the semi-folk intro is reminiscent of Dickinson's solo projects; you can really get into it thanks to its great beat and overall instrumentation. Maiden's frontman goes from sounding loose and relaxed to strong and dominant, reaching new heights with impetus and a wide spectrum of emotion. \"Coming Home\" starts off with a typical guitar progression before transforming into the kind of epic ballad found on any solo Dickinson album. Such auspicious beginnings aren't unusual considering Adrian Smith's traditional lead-off compositions, found on gems such as Accident of Birth and Chemical Wedding. Without a doubt, another inspiring moment is the classy and elegant sequence of lead melodies throughout. The nine-minute \"Isle of Avalon\" unleashes a torrent of rather long-winded tracks. On this last, Harris' incepting and sparkling bass line instantly brings to mind Seventh Son of a Seventh Son proper; even Dickinson's prose brings to mind the classic closing epic from 1988. Whether it's intentional or not, this welcome crescendo of sorts eventually reaches explosive proportions, imbued as they are with Maiden's endearing signature melody, ardour and flair.\n\nEssentially, Iron Maiden's fifteenth studio album took four long years to produce impeded as it was by constant touring; this didn't prevent the masters from taking a short propitious and providential break at the last minute in order to wrap 'er up (with a bow if you will), perhaps from feeling the pressure and need to finally release something new and fresh. This paid off in the end, seeing what a good album it turned out to be. If anything, its \"stewing on the backburner\" and quick, conducive \"sautee-ing\" improved its quality and craftsmanship, like a good spaghetti sauce left to marinate on the stove overnight. Though as a parting shot, this is in no part thanks to the producer, Kevin Shirley, who, in my opinion, has become somewhat complacent as he simply sits back without pushing the envelope or going against the grain. In other words, he's content with anything the band lays down without providing any feedback. I feel his present role goes no further than a sound engineer, akin to what happened between Metallica and Bob Rock in the 90s. That said, perhaps they should hire another for upcoming albums, someone like Roy Z. or Andy Sneap, who'd duly reap the best from the band. The question is, would Harris be up to it? Regardless, in spite of multiple line-ups and setbacks, Iron Maiden has always prevailed. Chances are, it'll continue to do so.\n",
        "\nOne detail I find amusing is that most fans of Paul Di'Anno not only call this his best album with Maiden, but the greatest Iron Maiden album of all time. If you ask Mr. Di'Anno what he thinks of the album, he'll tell you he thinks its terrible and that the first album was much better. Don't get me wrong, Killers is fucking great, surprisingly heavy, and underrated. Partially because for some stupid reason Maiden refuses to play any song from this album except Wrathchild, which I will actually agree is not very appropriate for Bruce to sing. That song is a street thug anthem, and Brucey is many things, but a street thug isn't one of them. There's a certain viciousness in Paul's performance in these songs, which, Bruce was actually quite capable of replicating during his first few of years of Maiden. Go listen to the Killers songs on Beast over Hammersmith, Bruce is absolutely maniacal and fits the songs like a glove there. Even a half decade later on Maiden England he manages to deliver the title track with perfect amount of rasp and venom, despite many fans declaring the Seventh Son period the soft sellout period. But we're getting ahead of ourselves here.\n\nIf I could describe how Killers differs from it's predecessor in four words or less, my response would be \"similar songwriting, better production.\" Perhaps even slightly inferior songwriting, as Steve admits they decided to put all their best songs on the first album with no regard for how that would turn out sonically. Granted, that worked out for them in the end as great songwriting shines through, but imagine how much better this would be if it got Phantom of the Opera instead of Prodigal Son, by far the least interesting classic Maiden song. Greeting us with a rather unremarkable acoustic lick, the song proceeds to try and make Lessons and Tears section of the 2112 album appropriate for a metal album. Unfortunately, Steve Harris failed in that respect. Prodigal Son hangs around this album's neck like an albatross. Dammit, I'm getting ahead of myself again. Incidentally, we would get a Martin Birch treatment of Phantom with Live After Death, but I think a Paul sung version of Phantom with this production would have been killer.\n\nI should say something about the arrival of the great Adrian Smith, but the problem is, he's given such little chance to shine, he's virtually forgettable. I know, calling Adrian Smith even slightly forgettable is a blasphemy that should be punished with a right bollocking, but we have to face the facts here. He has zero songwriting credits on this album, we don't get a proper guitar solo from him until six tracks in (Innocent Exile to be exact), and he even gets outclassed by Dave Murray on the title track! Seriously, go listen to Murray's all-time great[est?] solo at 2:59! While Adrian's solo on the same song is by no means bad, the preceding solo was so good that's its almost a waste of time to follow with another. Murray has technically played guitar for longer than Smith, and here it's the former who plays Jedi Master to the Padawan latter.\n\nHighlights of the album are the aforementioned stupendous title track, Murders In The Rue Morgue, Purgatory, the monstrous instrumental Genghis Khan (the riff at 1:47 would be recycled by the band and others quite a few times throughout the decades) and closing rocker Drifter. Yes, I said it, Drifter. I may be the only person on the planet who loves this slice of uptempo Status Quo worship (and this was long before I had even heard of Status Quo), but I'm entitled to my opinion, and this song absolutely kills, especially live. Again, go listen to Beast Over Hammersmith, what a lethal crowd pleaser! Why did Sanctuary replace that song in the encore again?\n\nEvery Iron Maiden and metal fan needs to hear Killers. I'm not entirely sure why this album went lower in the UK charts than it's unnecessarily lo-fi predecessor, but it is fun to bust Di'Anno fanboys' balls with that fact, especially since for a bunch of supposed anti-establishment punk they sure do love the numbers game. Ignore those dickheads. Ignore the Bruce fanboys as well for that matter. This album's bloodlust will defy all your needs! Ooooooo, look out, it's coming for you! Ha. ha. ha. ha. ha. ha. ha. ha. ha.\n",
        "\nIron Maiden's highly anticipated Dance of Death couldn't start off worse. The horrible cover depicting a barely discernible Eddie must be one of the least accomplished of their discography. Why didn't they contract the ever-bright Derek Riggs? We'll never know. As well, the album begins with \"Wildest Dreams\" - an anodyne track, by far the most inferior as it's too rock n' roll-ish, bland and unconvincing for an opener. It's a terrible choice and extends the band's string of limbo inducing, self-effacing singles such as The Angel and the Gambler, for want of a good (albeit pathetic) example. Iron Maiden is first and foremost a heavy metal band, not rock or even \"hard rock\" for that matter. Alternatively, The Wicker Man worked very well as a single on the previous album (Brave New World) because it was heavy and possessed loads of hooks as well as cranked up guitars, which is lacking on Wildest Dreams, except for the remarkable midway solo section.\n\nFortunately, things soon work out; already the second track, where starts the best effort, with its great melodic essence, an incredible vocal feeling which proves Bruce \"Air Raid\" Dickinson is still one of the great voices of metal. The three amigos' solos are also excellent although, personally, I think Janick Gers is surplus here as his sloppy style doesn't match the other guitarists' technical prowess. Essentially, this should have been the single as it's a great song. Dance of Death has moments of great compositional brilliance and sounds different than Maiden classics on which drum patterns and guitar chords are in some way more \"American\" than \"European\", especially when the trio doesn't use those Arabic scales abundantly used on The X Factor and later albums.\n\n\"Paschendale\" is, along with \"Monts\u00e9gur\", the heaviest stuff; a dark track, but certainly powerful with open chords which once again allow Dickinson's brilliance and great form to shine. He equally pulled the ace out of his sleeve on Fear of the Dark: black leather and all \"duelling\" for the sceptre of best metal vocalist while anticipating the return of Rob Halford with Judas Priest. The finale comes with 'Journeyman', an emotionally different song in the same vein as Arc of Space or Chemical Wedding from his solo project. It could be called folk metal, like a heavy version of Jethro Tull: a renovated metal base with violins, cello and 100% acoustic percussion, without battery implements, and with guitars which drive the song by differing emotions. It's definitely a nice, emotional way to close the album and were it not for Dickinson's voice, it would be hard to guess it's an Iron Maiden song. Very good!\n\nHarris whips up some amazing bass lines while McBrain at times enters the fray with marked and very heavy double bass drum kicks which allow vocals and guitars to evoke various emotions; this gives way to a cannon of guitar solos couched in tasteful orchestrations as well as bordering on a plethora of magnificent compositions. Dickinson relates the songs as if they were stories, almost conversing the lyrics before giving way to a sharp \"clawing\" vocalization i.e. hitting high notes to the backdrop of an instrumental base which also grows until reaching an emotional climax. This is what Dance of Death offers us. In short, an album requiring a slower assimilation than the previous one, with its immediately affecting 'The Wicker Man', 'Ghost of the Navigator' or 'The Mercenary'. However, only time will tell if it's of superior quality than Brave New World. For now, I know where I stand.\n",
        "\nI understand that in order for a band to make it, there needs to be a certain personal dynamic in play. The late, great Ronnie James Dio called it \"a democracy with a dictator.\" It is pleasantly magnanimous to be in a group where everyone's ideas can be considered, but at the end of the day someone has to make the final decision and stick to it. Unfortunately it seems in recent history, plenty of examples have popped up when control should be taken away from the current team captain and handed off to someone with a better mindset. Between this dreadful album and the fact that the Death On The Road DVD had seizure warnings as a result of Steve Harris's failings as an editor and director, it was at this point where Steve Harris was no longer fit to rule Iron Maiden. Upon hearing this album Rod should have locked Steve in an insane asylum, scrapped the whole thing save for a few songs and hand the reigns over to the new emergency braintrust of Dave Murray, Bruce Dickinson and Adrian Smith. Then maybe put Steve DiGorgia on bass or something.\n\nThere are people whose response to criticism of A Matter of Life & Death is \"What do you want them to do? Keep rewriting The Trooper?\" Well, if the alternative is Steve rewriting Fear of The Dark for 25 fucking years which is what the album is, then yes, shut up and re-write the The Trooper. (Or, you could just, you know, actually write something good AND original. Blind Guardian and High On Fire don't seem to have much problem with that these days). I haven't listened to this album from beginning to end in quite some time, but I can authoritatively say that whatever dynamics most of these songs have are completely cancelled out by that idiotic soft intro/actual song/repeat intro as coda formula. It wasn't that original of an idea Steve. I've always felt that Steve is still secretly bitter that we didn't fall head over heels in love with The X Factor and Virtual XI, convinced that it was only the singer problem, not the songs. While I will admit there are some hidden gems from that era, the fact is most of those songs were trash; the failed result of an attempt to try and mix Candlemass with Genesis. No, the problem that Bruce wasn't around. If Bruce was around the fans would gobble this shit up just like they did his solo albums. \"Why the fuck were those things so praised? The one he made right before he rejoined us was fucking groove metal worship!*\" Steve has been boiling in this mindset for decades now and us punters have been suffering for it ever since. Remember when Maiden stuffed albums with epics and they didn't sound like one another? Hell The Thin Line Between Love & Hate started heavy and ENDED soft. Why don't you write more songs like that, Steve? Then again he'd would probably run that into the ground as well.\n\nWith that being said, there are some good songs here. Believe it or not, two of them do follow the aforementioned formula. Those two songs are The Longest Day and For The Greater Good of God. In the case of the former, the clean intro works because it supports the song musically; the tension of waiting on those boats to arrive on the beaches at D-Day and more than likely get chopped in half by a machine gun in seconds is expressed wonderfully here. Greater Good works differently lyrically, but it also just works in a way I can't describe. If the \"X Factor formula\" was consolidated to these two songs the album would have worked a lot better, and we, the fandom might still be convinced that the emperor is at least still wearing clothes. But the real highlight of this album is The Pilgrim, which seems to only get better every 8 months or so I decide to put it on. Especially with that fantastic soaring chorus! Out of the Shadows is a decent ballad I suppose, and Lord of Light has a solid riff once the clean intro goes away. Or at least it's a solid recycling of the \"How Many Tears\" riff.\n\nFinally, and I realize this is petty and slightly non musical but I'm taking at least 20 points off for the worst decision this band made since choosing Blaze Bayley as a lead vocalist: playing the entire album live. Fuck. You. \"Oh, we're absolutely in love with this album we gave birth too! We can't possibly omit any of it live!\" Not your decision to make. That is a decision that can only be made when rabid fan reaction demands it. What's especially funny is the usual tradition of Maiden releasing a live album for the tour of the most recent album, usually containing a few tracks from the album in question. A perfectly reasonable gesture, but even 10 years later, a live album from this tour has yet to surface. I can only imagine the reason is because Rod came to the same conclusion I did. There is absolutely nothing wrong with playing a serviceable helping of new material live, just as long as it doesn't suck monkey dick.\n\nStay the hell away from this mess. It was so bad that Maiden had to do a tour with Powerslave, Rime of the Ancient Mariner and Moonchild just to recover from it. They still never recovered from it creatively, as they would go on to make double albums of this nonsense. Somewhere, David St. Hubbins and Nigel Tufnel are laughing their asses off.\n\n*Also I'm not kidding, kids. Hard Truth, Chemical Wedding is a groove metal album, but that's for another day.\n",
        "\n'The Book Of Souls' is remarkably good. Opinions on the band's output after reuniting with singer Bruce Dickinson and guitarist Adrian Smith have divided their fan base, but while 'The Book Of Souls' follows the same pseudo-progressive formula as its direct predecessors, the fire and vigor of classic Iron Maiden is heard more than occasionally throughout the album.\n\nSure, some of the songs are still too long - 'The Red And The Black' has about seven or eight minutes of interesting music, which is a bit meager for a thirteen and a half minute track - but nowhere near as overlong as the embarrassing 'When The Wild Wind Blows' from 'The Final Frontier' or just about any track from the tired and overblown 'A Matter Of Life And Death'. The main difference is that the longer tracks waste less time building up through overlong clean passages. They're more evenly distributed over the album this time around as well.\n\nApparently, one reason for the end of the songwriting stalemate is the decreased involvement of bassist and band leader Steve Harris, as two of the album's absolute highlights are Dickinson compositions. The eighteen minute closer 'Empire Of The Clouds' will probably be the main talking point for many reviewers and for a good reason: it sounds unlike anything Maiden has ever done before. It tells the story of the R101 aircraft departure and ultimate crash through a dramatic suite with a surprisingly prominent role for the piano. I'm choosing the word \"suite\" here, because the sections of the song don't all go together fluently, but are rather like chapters in a book.\n\nEven better is 'If Eternity Should Fail'. With its dark atmosphere, driving mid-tempo rhythm and a fantastic vocal performance even by Dickinson standards, it is easily their best opening track since 'Moonchild' over 25 years ago. Another highlight - both musically and lyrically - is the heartfelt hard rock of 'Tears Of A Clown', which also contains what is likely the finest guitar solo on the album. The title track has strong melodies and a nice doomy vibe before it builds towards a faster triplet-driven part - we are dealing with Iron Maiden here, after all - and 'The Man Of Sorrows' is a powerful, elegant epic. In the end, even the less remarkable tracks like 'The Great Unknown' and 'When The River Runs Deep' capture that classic Iron Maiden spark.\n\nLooking at personal performances, two men have outdone themselves on this record. Nicko McBrain is well in his sixties now, but gives the performance of a lifetime here. His drumming suggests that he's been reborn, as his creativity and power rival even his work on 'Piece Of Mind'. Bruce Dickinson also amazes. In recent years, I feel he's been forced to sing slightly too high and as a result sound a little strained. Because his melodies are just slightly lower this time around, he sounds mighty and stately. Adrian Smith deserves another special mention; while Dave Murray and Janick Gers deliver like they always do, Smith's typical melodic themes are all over the album, most notably in the delightfully energetic 'Death Or Glory'.\n\nFor every overlong moment and occasional self-plagiarizing passage - the intro to the fine 'Shadows Of The Valley' sounds so much like 'Wasted Years' that it's ridiculous - there's a strong, engaging song on 'The Book Of Souls'. That alone makes it the band's best effort since 'Brave New World' with any shade of a doubt. While 'The Final Frontier' had a few songs I was quite fond of ('The Talisman', 'Mother Of Mercy'), this one ups the ante in terms of composition and especially performance. The smaller number of repetitive choruses helps as well. If this will turn out to be the last studio album Maiden ever releases, I would definitely say they're ending on a high note.\n\nRecommended tracks: 'If Eternity Should Fail', 'Tears Of A Clown', 'Empire Of The Clouds'\n\nOriginally written for my Kevy Metal weblog\n",
        "\n\u2018Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son\u2019 was the final album Iron Maiden made with its classic line-up and in a sense, the album takes them as far as that line-up logically could go. It is quite progressive by late eighties metal standards, the synth experiments that were only partially successful on \u2018Somewhere In Time\u2019 are incorporated into the music much better here and the songwriting has a dramatic flair that Iron Maiden has not had before or since. In their quest to make their music interesting for themselves, yet accessible enough to sing along, this is the ultimate Iron Maiden album.\n\nTechnically, \u2018Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son\u2019 this is a flawed concept album. There are themes of clairvoyance and second sight sprinkled throughout the album, but the narrative traditionally associated with concept records is nowhere to be found. Yet somehow, that does not diminish the album\u2019s quality one bit. The theme gives the album some consistency that \u2018Somewhere In Time\u2019 was lacking, while the songwriting and the production reflect the lyrics rather splendidly. Another notable feature here is that the tempo changes, which were usually reserved for the longer tracks, are all over the songs, including the short, punchy ones.\n\nIt is hard for me to be objective about \u2018Moonchild\u2019, the first heavy metal track I have ever heard. But even now, more than two decades later, the song sounds incredible. It manages to combine Maiden\u2019s melodic class with an aggressive drive in both the rhythms and Bruce Dickinson\u2019s amazing vocals. The massive title track is the one that profits the most from the presence of keyboards, as they adorn the middle section with a theatrical layer it would not have had with guitars exclusively. And for progressive majesty, look no further than \u2018Infinite Dreams\u2019, in which tempo changes, subtle synths and incredible melodies blend into one atmospheric masterpiece.\n\nBesides \u2018Infinite Dreams\u2019, the album contained three other top ten singles, of which only the lightweight \u2018Can I Play With Madness\u2019 misses the mark. \u2018The Evil That Men Do\u2019 is powerful and uncomplicated, while \u2018The Clairvoyant\u2019 is such a work of art that it\u2019s easy to forgive the first melody\u2019s resemblance to the verses of Bob Dylan\u2019s \u2018Blowin\u2019 In The Wind\u2019. On the other end of the spectrum is \u2018The Prophecy\u2019, which due to its lack of an actual chorus often goes by unnoticed, but is a guitar harmony tour de force.\n\nFollowing the tour for \u2018Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son\u2019, guitarist Adrian Smith \u2013 Maiden\u2019s melodic conscience \u2013 would leave and the band would head in a somewhat more aggressive direction. And though he would return for a run of decent to really good albums, Iron Maiden was never the same again. Along with \u2018Powerslave\u2019, \u2018Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son\u2019 stands as the best work by the best Iron Maiden line-up and a blue print for many heavy metal bands to follow. It is one of those rare instances where everybody involved outdoes himself, creating something that is both musically interesting and highly listenable in the process.\n\nRecommended tracks: \u2018Moonchild\u2019, \u2018Infinite Dreams\u2019, \u2018The Clairvoyant\u2019\n\nOriginally written for my Kevy Metal weblog\n",
        "\nIron Maiden's ninth studio full lengther has a special place in my heart. Not because it was Bruce's \"last\" Maiden album, but because me and some my friends loved it to death, and \"Fear of the Dark Tour\" gig in Helsinki was my first ever Maiden concert experience. So please take this into consideration when reading this review.\n\n'Fear of the Dark' is the second album without the \"hit-machine\", guitarist Adrian Smith. That does not mean, that there was no catchy songs, or that there was just long epics on the album. The title track is the only song that goes beyond 7 minutes. Still being a setlist regular, the song is one of the trademark songs from the band. But later about it... 'Fear of the Dark' is also the second Maiden album, after some more epic ones, that is pretty streetwise rocking heavy metal. 'No Prayer for the Dying' from 1990 was the first such album for years, since 1981 album 'Killers'. In many ways this one is easiest to compare to that Maiden classic. A lot of people always say, that Iron Maiden cannot change, but still I beg to differ. They still do, and have always done it. That's what makes them interesting, among many other things. Okay, I seem to ramble around with this text. So, let's start from the beginning. But before that, let me warn you: This could be a bit of a track-by-track review. However, the songs are so different to each other, that this is basically obligatory.\n\nThe striking single cut 'Be Quick or Be Dead' is another fine opener for a Maiden album. This fast song (one of the band's fastest ones) goes straight into action, as the drummer Nicko McBrain hits the beginning strokes. The guitar duo Dave Murray and Janick Gers, who replaced Adrian Smith for the previous album, let it rip with riffs filled with street credibility. Steve Harris's finger-played clanking bass is as flashy as always. Bruce Dickinson's vocals are angry, really throaty and snarling at times, something like he did on his first solo album 'Tattooed Millionaire' two years earlier. By the way, Janick Gers played on that album too, plus the song was written by the two... Mr. Dickinson's range is huge as there is typical clean, high-pitched singing, too. A very energetic, visceral opener that leads the way for more bluesy (in an English way, that is) rocking Harris's song 'From Here to Eternity', which is one of my favourite songs off the abum. The song smells like exhaust fumes, and rolls on like the band was on two-wheelers. This pair of songs shouldn't be such an obstacle after 'Holy Smoke', really. But upbeat and catchy 'Weekend Warrior' might. A song about going to see a soccer game (really!), and possible violence happening there. Mr. Harris is an avid West Ham United Football Club suppoter, so it's not a total surprise as a lyric topic, but on a heavy metal album...?!? Anyway, it was one of the first songs that I really liked off of this album, and still is, even though Bruce's croaking vocals are featured.\n\nAfter these two ass-kicking pieces, it is time to calm down. Emotional 'Afraid to Shoot Strangers', again by Harris, is such of a song the band has never done before and after (okay, it does have quite similar truly dark aura that the following 1995 album 'The X Factor' carries). The song builds up pretty slowly, but does not contain ill-fitted parts, as some songs from the band. It's a very atmospheric song, that also lets it rip, going through a Hammond organ part. 'Fear is a Key' is another slower one with somewhat Deep Purple-ish and Rainbow-ish, plus Mid-Eastern vibes (not surprisingly by Dickinson and Gers). It feels like it was a bit more jammed in the studio, and is one of worse songs from the band; it simply feels like it was work in progress, but listen to that guitar solo! Let's include the album's third sedate piece here: Highly affective 'Wasting Love' by same duo, is a ballad-ish, if not a ballad, and one of the band's most calm songs. Not quite as calm as 'Change of Heart' from Mr. Dickinson, though.\n\nAnother Harris one, 'Childhood's End', takes a turn into more epic, metal stuff. It balances between slow and faster parts, with some out-of-norm tom drumming that doesn't really work very well because them parts are a tad too long. But the vocals are some of the best on the album; truly filled with emotions. Also the guitar melodies are ace and 100% Maiden. 'The Fugitive' is another more metal piece, but is a relative to 'The Assassin', meaning that it's one of the band's worse songs. It's too sullen to be a fist-pumper, which it tries to be. Harris's worst, possibly. 'Chains of Misery' is also on gloomy side, but packs much more energy, and contains some gang vocals on its stadion rock chorus. So, one thumb up! 'The Apparition' is the oddball cousin from the woods: The bass and the guitars change places, in a way, in this wickedly exhilarating song. Even though it's a weirdo, I like it a lot. Experiment not failed. Most traditional Maiden song 'Judas Be My Guide's reverbing guitar solo harks back to old times, and the song contains a very good chorus. These two were by Dickinson and Murray, so good to hear Dave's rather succesful input. However, none of these songs aren't 'The Trooper', 'Aces High' or 'The Evil That Men Do', not even close.\n\nOops, the Harris-penned title track is still missing... Now, my friends, this is it what all of you've been waiting for! Fucking epic piece of Maiden-songsmith. 'Hallowed Be Thy Name' of the 1990s. The band have played this one probably in every concert since. There's no other way to say this, but if there was more songs of this quality on the album, it could have been a real killer. The band just seems to be on totally different plane on this one. Even though there are more songs that I love, this easily deserves the highest of accolades of these twelve songs.\n\nSo, the album isn't very uniform. First, it has so different songs packed in, and some of them feel uncompleted, or simply too much like experiments. Also, three calm songs on tracks 3, 4 and 6. These are the biggest weakness about the album. Almost every song I've learned to like, even love. So, another Ying/Yang of an album, this. And when thinking about epicness versus rocking, could they've gone further into majesty after 'Seventh Son of a Seventh Son'? I do not think so. Not with a full album, but with songs, yes.\n\nBruce is pretty damn theatrical on this album, and most varying ever. sadly, his soaring pipes are not heard that much, but more of that raspy and snarly street rocker thing. The lyrical themes are mostly about real life (perhaps unlike the Melvyn Grant cover art let's one to believe): Money runs the corrupt world, war (a soldier thinking why does he shoot some unknown human beings, not a story of a massive attack), AIDS, TV series ('The Fugitive', which is bloody far from the grandeur of 'The Prisoner'!), and wicked side of human minds. But there's more fantasy (?) material, too, as Charlotte the harlot gets another sequel, and a ghost comes to give some good advice for life. I've always liked Iron Maiden's lyrics, because they are nothing too poetic, and truly differ from masses.\n\nIt is easy to tell difference between the guitarists; one being more bluesy and picturesque and other more rough and ripping. The Steve Harris bass is what's expected: amazingly superhuman, clanking, and everywhere. Mr. McBrain still wanted to experiment a bit, and this is miles higher than him being basic on 'Virtual XI' . There's some synthesizer mat sounds heard, as well as aforementioned Hammond stuff. I'm not sure if this really needed those, though. Sound-wise the album is very clear. It's actually a bit too airy, perhaps. Anyway, it kicks asses of Kevin Shirley produced albums...\n\nAs a whole, 'Fear of the Dark' was close to being the band's least good album when it came out. Still, for the most part it was an instant hit for me. It remains as a point of history now; it's not that hot music-wise, but it's great to return to it every now and then and go through the memories it summons. But from reviewing point of view, this belongs amongst the five worst Maiden albums with 'The Book of Souls', 'The Final Frontier', 'Virtual XI' and 'No Prayer for the Dying' (not in any order). But some days I can spin it all day long! Go figure.\n\n(Originally written for ArchaicMetallurgy.com)\n",
        "\nIron Maiden\u2019s The Number of the Beast doesn\u2019t really need another review on the Metal Archives, nor does it require any introduction. So what are we doing here, then? I\u2019m here to explain why no one dares shit on this album and why the lowest score here is only 60%, which is for a review where the writer comments on filler songs and the difference between this and Powerslave. I\u2019m here to tell you that the only difference between this and Powerslave is that The Number of the Beast is original flavour heavy metal (I guess Maiden\u2019s 1984 classic is like the version with nuts) and that it\u2019s the first time \u2013 or if not the very first time, the most widely heralded first instance \u2013 our kind of music ceased to be a subgenre and became a legitimate genre in its own right. This is pure heavy metal: blueprint completed, signed.\n\nJust think about it. Before Iron Maiden, there were heavy metal statesmen like Black Sabbath and Judas Priest, but they never seemed perfectly sure about their identity. Sabbath would write something mind-bendingly heavy like \u2018Electric Funeral\u2019 and then put \u2018War Pigs\u2019 on the same album, which is essentially a prog rock song with very heavy guitar chords. Judas Priest walked the walk and talked the talk of being heavy metal, yet they were also more than happy to write sappy ballads and AC/DC rock boppers alongside them. You can point all the fingers you like to other bands like Scorpions, Diamond Head, Raven, or other NWOBHM bands like Saxon, Venom or Angel Witch, but you\u2019re not going to find any of them putting out consistently, definitively, heavy metal music at the same point as Iron Maiden, nor have most of those sounds proven nearly as enduring as the one encapsulated on The Number of the Beast. It\u2019s not my purpose to say that all that went before this was \u201cnot metal\u201d or that it\u2019s not worth your time bothering with anything earlier, but this is the first time when everyone knew that the album in question was a heavy metal album and didn\u2019t need to ask any questions.\n\nThe cover image of Eddie pulling the Devil\u2019s strings; the band on the back cover standing before a great bonfire; songs about war, possession, death, and Satan; the overdriven wail of the guitars; the meaty thump of the rhythm instruments; the unabashed wail of the vocals; the feel of the band moving forwards as one: all this combines into the album\u2019s essence and barely deviates from its path. The Number of the Beast certainly wasn\u2019t the heaviest album of 1982, nor was it the fastest or the most aggressive, yet the feelings of determination, trepidation, and elation seen here are the most complete summary of the whole scope of heavy metal. Arguably, this is more of a \u201cgood times\u201d album than Killers a year earlier, cutting back on the social commentary and slasher imagery to take in more fiction and history than before, though that drop in spite and darkness makes the concoction all the purer, Maiden needing no such punk spirit as on the likes of \u2018Innocent Exile\u2019. This is a capacious release and sounds easy too, as if the five-piece didn\u2019t need to apply too much effort to think up the songs.\n\nThat sense of ease is recognizable in the moments when Maiden let simplicity speak for itself, allowing chugging riffs to carry the title track and \u201922 Acacia Avenue\u2019 through their opening verses, words falling into place as though they had been residing subliminally in the bandmembers\u2019 minds until recording began. Other kinds of simplicity are exhibited too, such as the slow and fast dynamics used in \u2018The Prisoner\u2019 or the ubiquitous stomping rhythm of \u2018Run to the Hills\u2019, which is surely the most facile thing the Londoners ever created. Likewise, the \u201cchildish\u201d bass hook of \u2018Invaders\u2019 (as it has often been criticized) seems like the thought of a moment, for better or worse, though this is contrasted by the elegant flow of the lead section in \u2018Gangland\u2019 or the inimitable build-up of \u2018Hallowed Be Thy Name\u2019 into a roaring powerhouse of philosophic riffing and melodic brilliance. All of these songs are instantly recognizable and require no more than the mention of a title, lyric, or riff to cause metalheads to sigh nostalgically; therefore, despite some clear imperfections, they can be said to fulfill the purpose of their existence marvelously well.\n\nAs with all albums that have such particular significance, quality is very difficult to judge, though there is a point to be made about the slightly lower levels of passion and grit (compared to earlier Maiden efforts) or instrumental mastery and songwriting prowess (giving way to later albums), though the quantity and insistence of the hooks on The Number of the Beast must surely be ranked highly amongst all albums of the time period. There are some songs that have been crafted more carefully than others, notably the slow-burning \u2018Children of the Damned\u2019 and exquisitely calculated \u2018Hallowed Be Thy Name\u2019, the latter of which does not permit any criticism whatsoever. There are a few moments of underwhelming proportions, those being the difficult verses of \u2018Gangland\u2019 and the rough and ready style of \u2018Invaders\u2019, while \u201822 Acacia Avenue\u2019 hangs on for six and a half minutes largely thanks to the second chapter in the saga of Charlotte the Harlot. Of course, the perfect balance between the simple hooks and the sublime quality comes from \u2018The Number of the Beast\u2019 itself, which is one of the only absolutely compulsory listens in heavy metal and the sole site of biblical verses that I can quote. On a rather different \u2013 though related \u2013 note, the quote at the beginning of \u2018The Prisoner\u2019 has been used more than once during interrogations with my mother.\n\nAs a result of the special position of The Number of the Beast at the fore of heavy metal and as a source of nostalgic enjoyment, the score at the top of this review can be almost entirely ignored, since it holds almost no meaning for me. The score is based on the pure quality of the music and songs contained in the album, though cannot reflect the personal and cultural wealth contained in the recording. My advice for enjoying The Number of the Beast would be to listen regularly from a young age and ignore everyone else\u2019s opinion on the album. Only then will you know if it\u2019s really worth all the fuss.\n",
        "\nThe blandly titled The Book of Souls: Live Chapter is another entry in Iron Maiden's lengthy list of live records. This album goes back to the rather infamous A Real Dead One and A Real Live One records from the nineties as it features songs from different concerts recorded during the tour for the successful last studio record The Book of Souls. The goal is to appeal to fans around the world who might buy this release because they were present during the recording of a particular song which is also my personal case because I attended the group's show in Montreal. The downside is that such a compilative effort doesn't recapture the atmosphere, flow and spirit of a real concert. The video of the show released on the internet even shows how certain members of the group mysteriously switch guitars three times in a few seconds within the same song or how the first row in front of the stage includes a set of completely different characters from one moment to another. The audio version manages to hide the flaws of this patchwork but the atmosphere on this release can't be compared to Live After Death or Rock in Rio.\n\nLet's focus on the performances instead. All eyes were on singer Bruce Dickinson during this tour who had defeated cancer between the recording sessions of the studio album and the beginning of the tour. He who might be the best heavy metal singer of all times deserves our respect because he sounds as charismatic, energizing and skilled as ever and even better than at certain moments in the past. Having attended a show of the tour myself, I can confirm that he really nailed his performances and that there weren't too many things that got polished in the process of this live album's production. The instrumental work is solid as usual but maybe a little bit too slick. I would have liked a few more differences between the studio versions and the live versions.\n\nSome Iron Maiden tracks work much better live than the studio versions because they sound more atmospheric, direct and organic. This is for example the case for the Blaze Bayley records as well as the efforts of the early millennium. Other tracks have a very specific atmosphere on their respective studio records which can't be quite reproduced on stage. This might be the case for the charismatically produced Somewhere in Time and Seventh Son of a Seventh Son records. The Book of Souls: Live Chapter is the first case where studio and live versions sound pretty much identical. ''Death or Glory'' remains a bland rocker by the numbers while the eerie ''If Eternity Should Fail'' keeps its mysterious atmosphere. ''Speed of Light'' still sounds like a solid copy of ''El Dorado'' while ''The Great Unknown'' is another exchangeable gloomy tune with an overlong introduction. ''The Book of Souls'' is still one of the weakest title tracks in the history of Iron Maiden while ''The Red and the Black'' is somehow fun despite its predictability. To keep it short, if you own the last studio album, you don't really need this live album. Only purchasing the live album would be a mistake as well, since you would miss out on the emotional half ballad ''Tears of a Clown'' and the elegant epic ''Empire of the Clouds''. Even though ''Tears of a Clown'' and ''Hallowed Be thy Name'' have been played during the first few legs of the tour, they weren't included on The Book of Souls: Live Chapter. In the latter case, a lawsuit related to copyright claims might be the reason behind the omission but there isn't any obvious reason for the exclusion of one of the last studio record's highlights.\n\nConcerning the classics, this release mostly delivers the usual suspects. Personally, I don't need another version of ''Wrathchild'', ''The Trooper'' and ''The Number of the Beast''. I would have preferred one or two surprises in form of songs that were rarely or never played live before. At least, this album offers a vivid rendition of the atmospheric epic ''Powerslave'' and a dynamic conclusion with a tight rendition of ''Wasted Years''. The set list is satisfying for occasional fans but faithful supporters don't get a lot to chew on aside of the tracks from the last studio effort.\n\nThe Book of Souls: Live Chapter isn't a bad live record by any means. The production is authentic and the performances are stellar but it fails to be as atmospheric and outstanding as any other regular live release of the band in the last twenty years. By Iron Maiden's high standards, The Book of Souls: Live Chapter is a good average effort at best. It's for collectors and fans only.\n",
        "\nI must say that \"The X Factor\" is not only a very technical album, but splatters the paint with a lot of originality which keeps marking its dark presence in many melodies and interludes on this record. The musical quality manages to maintain itself throughout the whole album. For a maiden fan who has been listening to those galloping guitars over the years with famous songs like \"The Trooper\" or \"The Clairvoyant\", listening to a song like \"Blood On The World's Hands\" even gives a consternation/boredom to the most die-hard fan, the lack of hookness in that song is equivalent to this whole disc.\n\nThe X Factor has epics songs that honour the things which Maiden did in the past, just like the strong masterpiece and long opener \"Sign of the Cross\" with technical combination of Murray's and Gers' guitar skills and that one of fantastic monastery's orchestra, \"Fortunes of War\" is another long song that takes you through a seven-minute musical trip, the bass at 1:44 sounds very lugubrious, then comes a good solo which could sound as a soundtrack for desolate places in movies, \"The Edge of Darkness\" with those melodic guitar harmonies and killer riff right in the middle is just a signal of being alert. And finally \"Blood on the World's Hands\", a worthy song with an emotional guitar touch and a contagious keyboard atmosphere, featuring the best Bayley's vocal performance on this masterpiece.\n\nBlaze try to do the impossible to please old fans who would see this new proposal which Maiden did prepare for them: finally, his voice fits perfectly with the album's dark ambient, as a result. I think this kind of effort should not be necessary to release again, I prefer this album over A Matter Of Life And Death (meh). Although the controversy did spread because of his voice, his real and sincere tone gave a breath of fresh air for this band's sound. If you are going to enter into Maiden's world, be sure to avoid this one as first listening, try to make it the last Maiden album to hear and instead listen to their classics ones like \"Powerslave\" or \"The Number of The Beast\". This is only for expert ears. If you're already a Maiden fan, try to be positive and open-minded, don't be disappointed.\n\nThe cover is actually pretty cool, is a classic gore art and is probably the best feature of the record. The album is competent enough in light of progressive influences. It's not old Maiden at all, might be another band as well. I'd probably never guess it was Maiden when I was listening to it: no old lyrical themes, no same guitar solos at all, the production and even voice is more or less unrecognizable. But it's heavy metal which approaches standards measures, the \"annoying\" songwriting is what a lot of people will take away from it. The production is probably the best part of The X Factor, better than Fear of the Dark, and I guess it bodes well for fans who love live versions, especially when Bruce sings Sign of the Cross, look for the live versions with Bruce, I think you'll like it. Don't fall for fans' defamatory statements. Looks like that this is a definite love-or-hate-release, therefore I advise you downloading it before you buy it. If you prefer.\n",
        "\nLet\u2019s get straight to, shall we, as Iron Maiden were keen to do back in 1980. It\u2019s no secret that I don\u2019t think much of what this crew of Londoners have done since Dance of Death, nor do I mind people knowing that I'm much more a fan of Killers and Powerslave than the more considered efforts the band have put out, but this debut album frankly has nothing to do with all that. The truth is that Iron Maiden could well have been released by a different band to all those albums (and let's not forget that three out of the five musicians who play on this were out of the band within four years), sounding quite a world away from some of the other burgeoning NWOBHM bands too. For convenience's sake, I'll state now that I'm reviewing the widely available EMI remaster from the late '90s, which includes the wholly deserving 'Sanctuary' on the tracklisting.\n\nListening to the opening of a song like 'Running Free', it's plain to hear that Maiden were a much more rock-influenced band than they would become by the time of Bruce Dickinson, while Clive Burr has a more clattery kit and shuffling style than anything one might call metal these days. That Paulo Di'Anno also has a voice like the 40-a-day cousin of Graham Bonnet (of Rainbow around the same time period) doesn't encourage proclamations about Maiden's majesty either, though this all brings a street-level grit to proceedings that - coupled with a very warm and live-sounding production - supports the idea of these boys gigging in city pubs on a Saturday night. The way that the riffs of the short-lived Dennis Stratton and Dave Murray jab and rush on the briefer songs such as 'Prowler' and 'Charlotte the Harlot' is indicative of a more combative, but less cultured kind of music too, having one hand on the scruff of punk's neck and another holding back the onrush of a nascent speed metal scene. Even Steve Harris, his bass occupying its perennial position in the centre of the mix, spars altogether more with fists and nails than any more graceful weaponry.\n\nWhat we get is thus exciting and unpredictable, though not polished or finessed by any stretch of the imagination. Listening to the raw trebly fuzz of the guitars as they pummel through 'Transylvania' is a display of pure concepts, the blunt riffs being wholly capable of supporting vocals, though the absence of any indicates that this was a ploy to draw attention to the roughness and flurries of pace that build up throughout the song, as opposed to later instrumentals such as 'Losfer Words' that were more exercises than explorations. Admittedly, I quite disliked this album upon first getting it, yet it was 'Transylvania' that I managed to latch onto from first listen and vaguely understood the band's desire to promote the storytelling aspect of their guitarists through simple riffs and duelling melodies. It's still one of my favourite instrumentals on any album, while the more instinctive songs wormed their way into my consciousness after a while, the pure presence of 'Running Free' winning out over complaints of idiocy or lack of creativity, 'Prowler' and 'Charlotte the Harlot' meantime gaining ascendancy through their apt subject matter and the fieriness of Di'Anno's delivery.\n\nWhat I'm going to complain about - and it should really come as no surprise - is that the band couldn't do such a good job with the softer and slower songs as they would be able to do with the added arsenal of Dickinson and Nicko McBrain, not to mention Adrian Smith's more side-on approach to heaviness. Di'Anno doesn't really have the voice to hold the listener's attention throughout 'Remember Tomorrow', though that's just as much to do with a reliance on build and release techniques that ultimately frustrate in a song that spans five minutes and only makes it through three verses. To some extent, the same goes for 'Strange World', even if Murray's solos have an intoxicating power of their own, getting that classic Maiden tone absolutely nailed before the vocals come in, allowing him to conjure his trademark \"timeless\" atmosphere. The other drastic departure from three to four minute rockers is the historic 'Phantom of the Opera', which comes across as different from almost everyone's description, since it still sounds rough and ready to these ears, just with the ambition of classical music ladled onto a speed freak's come-up, sort of like the opposite of Cliff Burton steadying Metallica for 'Orion'.\n\nWhat makes this quite a different experience to most other Maiden albums (although certainly shared with Killers) is the visceral quality of the recording and of the playing techniques, something that means playing 'Sanctuary' to a room full of mixed-age Chinese language students - you know, to teach culture and all that - is guaranteed to get a response, even 35 years after the event. That's the most cut-throat track here and should be sought out by any with the original recording of only eight tracks, though this kind of music invites the listener to rock out for the most part without worrying about finishing touches. That's something that people related to in 1980 and the story is no different now.\n",
        "\nHere's where it all started. Iron Maiden, the definitive band and one of the forerunners of the New Wave Of British Heavy Metal. Anyway, you gotta start somewhere, and this is where they started. One of the best Iron Maiden albums, and one of the best debuts ever. Almost every song here is a killer one, and the musicianship is just amazing. It's great listening to this with headphones and picking up the individual riffs, bass lines and drums. Take lesson.\n\nPerhaps there is no better place to hear how punk and progressive rock converged on the NWOBHM than on this self-titled Iron Maiden debut. Often overlooked, it's easy to forget that Iron Maiden was changing something when it appeared on the 1980s. That year also saw great albums from bands like Mot\u00f6rhead, Saxon and Angel Witch, but Iron Maiden was always at the head of NWOBHM movement. On one hand, Maiden worked clearly on the basis of punk rock elements: the production, the acceleration of songs and the harsh voice of Di'Anno. On the other hand, they had all creative ambition of a progressive rock band. In terms of composition, even their shorter and simpler songs counted on abrupt changes in rhythm and sensation. Their musicality was already light years beyond punk, with complex instrumental passages between guitarists Dave Murray and Dennis Stratton, and bassist Steve Harris. The lyrics also did aspire to high ambitions, turning in first person the histories and drawings of characters, with a grotesque and deadly touch. If all is added, Iron Maiden performs the trick of reconciling two antithetical genders to each other, seemingly. Harris' bass is already outstanding and is a sign of what will become Maiden's main element for their career.\n\nThe seven minutes of \"Phantom of the Opera\" is a progressive, epic point of reference, with an ambitious fusion of musical styles and its construction in several sections. \"Running Free\" and \"Sanctuary,\" reached the bottom of the British singles charts. The story \"Prowler\", one of the most enduring numbers of the band, is in the same order of ideas, but with a more instrumental complexity, while the title track continues being a basic element of their concerts. They also offer the first instrumental, \"Transylvania\". Perhaps the little sign of a bad step comes with the ballad \"Strange World\", the only song on this album that was never re-recorded in a live or alternative version. However, the whole project explodes with energy and ideas. This album laid a very strong basis for what Iron Maiden would become. Most of these songs have become metal anthems.\n\nThe production sounds very different to all other albums, because the producer is not Martin Birch. When I was first getting into Maiden this difference really stood out, but after a hundred of listens, I don't notice it much at all. It's difficult to place how is different, the backing vocals sound very old school, but it works. What else should I add? Come on, it's Maiden's first record! Is the album that introduced Maiden to this world and deserves to be owned by anybody who considers themselves to appreciate metal. Yes, Maiden's travel began with this album. It's worth getting even if only for \"Phantom of the Opera\". It's a good album that all fans should have. Well, I hope you enjoyed my humble review on this beautiful debut and I shall close by saying (again) that no Maiden fan should be without this essential record.\n",
        "\n\"I always thought the guitars weren't heavy enough.\"\n\nThat quote from founding member and bassist Steve Harris would cause me to see Iron Maiden in a newer, but less flattering light. Don't get me wrong, this album is a must own, brilliantly crafted, time honored classic of metal, but he is right about the Will Malone's production (or lack thereof) slightly hindering it.\n\nLet's get a few things straight here for all you old \"they were better when they were punk rock with Paul Di'Anno\" assholes and the smegma-for-brains hipsters who think this album has a \"raw\" sound. First of all, this band was never, ever, EVER a punk influenced band. Right or wrong, Steve Harris hated punk down to the core for keeping Maiden from getting signed for so long, and I'm a little more willing to believe Steve's claim that Paul wasn't originally a punk fan and only latched onto it to annoy the rest of the band. Maybe I'm wrong, but let's just say Di'Anno's track record proves otherwise.\n\nSecond of all, you idiots don't have a tuppany fucking clue what \"raw\" is. Celtic Frost's Morbid Tales is raw. Venom's Welcome To Hell is raw. Bathory's discography is raw. Ace of Spades was raw. Iron Maiden's guitar sound is thin and sterile. Fuck even the first two Motley Crue albums were crunchier than this. When you have a band like Motorhead, with a taste for punk ethos, that has released four albums, all sounding rawer and heavier than an album by a band that has no punk ethos and fancies itself more of a prog outfit, and thus also fancies a more polished approach, something has gone horribly, horribly wrong. Did I mention that most of those Motorhead albums were released before  Iron Maiden, and therefore, technology itself should have made even the lowest amp settings heavier by default? Even Di'anno said the production was shit on the self-titled.\n\nAnother thing, these are the same folks who love to regale themselves with the idea that Di'Anno era Maiden was \"so unpredictable\" and Maiden became \"so formulaic and predictable in their later years.\" Yes, nothing says unpredictable like using\n\n\"Won\u2019t you come into my room? I wanna show you all my wares\nI just want to see your blood, I just want to stand and stare\nSee the blood begin to flow as it falls upon the floor\nIron Maiden can\u2019t be fought, Iron Maiden can\u2019t be sought\"\n\nthree verses in a row. It's not even the first song to do this on the album. Prowler, Remember Tomorrow, Charlotte The Harlot, Another Life, Purgatory and Innocent Exile and I'm sure a few others all suffer from lyrical repetition. A keen listener will also observe that a lot of these tracks had the same musical formula as well. Basic verse, chorus, second verse, second chorus, complete time change that is usually three times the speed, and a conclusion of one final verse and chorus. Most, if not all of the songs mentioned above along with a few others follow this formula. Even Phantom of the Opera can't help but fall victim to this formula as well, with the \"keep your distance walk away\" serving as the beginning of one really long bridge. Now I'm not knocking the formula, it's a great and effective formula, but that's just what it is, a formula, the exact opposite of unpredictable. All of you assholes with your so called \"musical industry experience\" can take your punk-rock Paul Di'Anno pedophilia and shove it up your ass!\n\nBut with all that said, not even Will Malone could fuck this up because the songwriting on this baby is nothing less than world-class. At the end of the day, great songs conquer through all and this baby has them in spades. Granted they were cherry-picked by the band out of the repertoire the band had grown throughout the years, but shit, Van Halen did that throughout their career! Honestly, as great of a song as Phantom of the Opera is, I almost feel it's out of place here, because as far as I'm concerned, Iron Maiden is about the ANTHEMS. Running Free was the first official single, but they could have picked any song from here and it would have performed swimmingly in the British charts. Prowler, Sanctuary, Charlotte The Harlot and of course, the eponymous set closer we all know and love are what leather and studs metal is all about. Even Remember Tomorrow has an incredibly heavy chorus which pushes the track over the required heaviness line.\n\nOne person that appears here whom we would never associate with Iron Maiden again is guitarist Dennis Stratton. If he wasn't such a big George Benson and Eagles fan he could have carried on with the band and done a fine job in the process. Hell as much as I prefer the Live After Death version of Phantom of the Opera, his guitar solo is a perfect Clapton-esque \"only the right notes\" break that I really wish Adrian Smith would have just bitten the bullet and duplicate it live. Now of course, only the most slovenly Pendleton adoring neckbeards would say Smith was inferior to Stratton. It's a case of comparing John Rutsey to Neil Peart, Brian Jones to Mick Taylor, or, um, Paul Di'Anno to Bruce Dickinson (awkward). Just because one musician was replaced with a superior musician doesn't make the predecessor's talents null and void. Dennis has entertaining guitar solos all over the album, but Dave Murray had even more of them.\n\nNo questioning that Maiden came out of the gate swinging.  Iron Maiden is a near flawless LP, and easily one of the great debuts in all of music. If you're a Dickinson fanboy who's been avoiding the Di'Anno albums throughout the years for whatever reason then you had best un-fuck yourself and start shitting Tiffany cufflinks, because this album (as well as Killers) will definitely fuck you up.\n",
        "\n\"We shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender.\" - Winston Churchill, 1940.\n\nSuch is the fitting (live) preamble to Iron Maiden's fifth studio album, Powerslave, released under EMI/ Capitol Records in 1984 (an exceptional year metal-wise!) and its much celebrated RAF inspired opener \"Aces High\". Allow me to echo a squadron of fellow reviewers by affirming the NWOBHM \"pharaohs\" are undeniably at the top of their game (i.e. height of careers) from start to finish, be it from lyrically powerful and exciting \"Two Minutes To Midnight\", alongside highly festive and hallucinatory, albeit rabidly pull-off infused, \"Back In The Village\", to 13.5 minute long odyssey \"Rime Of The Ancient Mariner\", based on the epic sea-faring morality tale by Samuel Taylor Coleridge.\n\nFront man Bruce \"Air Raid\" Dickinson expertly leads the charge whilst relative newcomer drummer Nicko McBrain and bass legend Steve Harris provide the rock solid backdrop necessary for guitar heroes Adrian Smith and Dave Murray to truly shine and at times dazzle the listener with their mesmerizing, impeccably phrased chops and gripping harmonies/riffs. Dig the incremental, vocal-free \"Losfer Words (Big 'Orra)\", which bridges the gap between speed metal precursor \"Two Minutes To Midnight\" and novel dragon slaying fable \"Flash Of The Blade\", with its brilliant opening riff and intricate bass line. Or how 'bout super sinister, but cool as Hades, Phoenician sounding riff to Powerslave, which eventually yields a killer stomping backing riff to a downright majestic lead break, in fact, the one which instantly turned me into a devout metal (and guitar) maniac at a young age and to this day comprises some of my favourite solos of all time? (stainedclass2112 knows what I mean; check out his diligent and masterful youtube bass cover of this seven minute phenomenon!).\n\nAs stellar and tight as Powerslave is, it's hard to pick out top highlights - each track jockeys for the number one spot; admittedly, they stand out in various ways. With its crunchy and urgent triplet based main riff, multiple drum fills, lugubrious hull creaking and dramatic \"bridge\", not a moment's lost on \"Rime Of The Ancient Mariner\", where the listener is steered out of the Darkness and into the Light by way of Harris' upbeat bass line heralding glad tidings in the form of Murray and Smith's explosive soloing before a crushing return to form i.e. the main riff. The classical sounding guitar harmonies to \"Aces High\" are right up there with the \"Trooper\"'s from 1983's Piece Of Mind while Harris's bass relentlessly pokes around like Osiris' royal scepter, jiggling with reckless abandon on \"Two Minutes To Midnight\", which he imbues with its own special undertow. The lead break to \"The Duellists\" is above par and a classic showcasing of NWOBHM lead guitar wizardry. As well, the overall lyrics simply slay; with its WWII/ Ancient Egyptian themes (and beautiful cover art!), this magnum opus also makes an ideal companion soundtrack to Return To Castle Wolfenstein - especially when battling Nazis and undead legions in the Pyramids (sorry, the latent \"gamer\" in me couldn't resist!).\n\nAt first, was hesitant to give Iron Maiden's Powerslave such a high score - due to relatively tame \"Losfer Words (Big 'Orra)\" perhaps? - but, once having given head a shake or four, realized it's duly warranted as far as the standard, octadic edition goes thanks to its vibrant atmosphere and outstanding musicianship. Also, sentimental value is too great. Not only is it a timeless heavy metal classic and obvious \"desert island\" release, but essential \"stranded on the Moon\" one as well!\n\n*Addendum: B-Sides included on EMI's 1995 double CD release are partially worth looking into. While the live version of \"Number Of The Beast\" feels random, both covers - a slightly hokey but neat, Mountain sounding Beckett reprise of \"Rainbow's Gold\" along with a super (bass) jangly and varied rock-ish take on Nektar's \"King Of Twilight\" - sit comfortably within Powerslave's overall \"phantasmagoregal\" theme; although I can't quite fathom what the record label was thinking when including the fustian and totally unnecessary band quarrel \"Mission From 'Arry\" - a bunch of boring and dispirited claptrap mind you! - which frankly should have been omitted. \n\n\"Into the Abyss I\u2019ll fall, the eye of Horus\nInto the eyes of the night, watching me go\nGreen is the cat\u2019s eye that glows in this temple\nEnter the risen Osiris, risen again\n\nTell me why I had to be a Powerslave\nI don\u2019t wanna die, I\u2019m a God... why can\u2019t I live on?\nWhen the Life Giver dies, all around is laid waste\nAnd in my last hour, I\u2019m a slave to the Power of Death!\"\n",
        "\n\"You\u2019ll take my life but I\u2019ll take yours too\nYou\u2019ll fire your musket but I\u2019ll run you through\nSo when you\u2019re waiting for the next attack\nYou\u2019d better stand there\u2019s no turning back\n\nThe bugle sounds as the charge begins\nBut on this battlefield no one wins\nThe smell of acrid smoke and horses breath\nAs you plunge into a certain death...O-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-oh! (X2)...\"\n\nWhat metal head, young or old, isn't familiar with such lyrical gold, timeless verses which grippingly introduce Iron Maiden's super duper classic, \"The Trooper\", from Iron Maiden's fourth release, 1983's Piece Of Mind? Never mind its historically militant, Crimean War theme portraying Alfred Lord Tennyson's \"The Charge of the Light Brigade\" which alludes to the Battle Of Balaclava (October 25, 1854); this top highlight also instantly brings to mind the patriotic mosaic of a battle-charged, Union Jack waving Eddie which surely should have featured as the cover of this heavy metal mainstay instead of the rabid and rancorous, straight-jacketed Ed boorishly portrayed above. That said, allow me to further bombastically rhapsodize on what could very well be the NWOBHM masters' most contested and debated album despite its visceral multitude of toothsome albeit rather unheralded - and rarely, if ever, played live - gems such as \"Revelations\", \"Die With Your Boots On\", \"Still Life\", \"Sun And Steel\" and fantastical closer \"To Tame A Land\", inspired by Frank Herbert's arcane science fiction epic \"Dune\".\n\nWhile it may not be the most exciting or inspiring opener, \"Where Eagles Dare\" manages to set the tone for Piece Of Mind's chivalrous and valorous undertones with its intrepid lyrics and stout but unvarying song structure; admittedly, the rather atmospheric lead break over the sound of machine gun fire isn't quite up to par with further stellar soloing on behalf of Adrian Smith and Dave Murray, such as the double whammy solo sections of \"Die With Your Boots On\", the sizzling chops amidst \"The Trooper\"'s unforgettable guitar harmony - which greatly emphasizes the band's classical musical training - or the mysterious and soulful \"Still Life\" and \"To Tame A Land\", where, as with other long-winded narrative closing dirges, the musicianship duly takes off at the mid-point, thus also wrapping up on a high note.\n\nObviously worth mentioning is how Piece Of Mind constitutes new drummer Nicko McBrain's first foray, replacing Clive Burr (RIP) and drastically altering the quintet's sound from a grittier, rabble-rousing edge to a much more predictable albeit compact one. Regardless, the reason this release doesn't fare quite as well as its predecessor, 1982's Number Of The Beast, or successor, 1984's Powerslave, is a handful of weaker offerings such as \"Where Eagles Dare\", \"Flight Of Icarus\" (despite its fun Greek mythology) and especially the somewhat dorky \"Quest For Fire\" which features a lame singsong chorus and tepid guitar riffs - even the leads lack bite. Other than these slight let-downs, expect to be thoroughly rocked by an early goose-bump giving \"clean-progression\" incepting number akin to \"Children Of The Damned\", the wickedly poised \"Revelations\" which features Bruce Dickinson alternating between soothing biblical crooning and sardonic yawping before Murray and Smith crank things up a notch with their slickly phrased, highly emotional leads. \n\nSatisfying as the first quarter-hour is, the kid gloves fly off with wicked trio of personal Maiden favourites in \"Die With Your Boots On\", The Trooper\" and haunting \"Still Life\". While latter lugubriously begins to sound of Dickinson solemnly waxing skooky (spooky/ kooky) backwards followed by his halting, breathless verses to the backdrop of an eerily melodic, low-tempo guitar lick/ riff (dig the part before the solos when he lopsidedly echoes \"Nightmares will give me piece of MIND!\"), Die With Your Boots On\" jarringly hooks the listener with a killer, evil and mean sounding opening/ main guitar riff and bass line whilst the lyrics are, coyly put, to die for whether or not ya got your boots on: dig the verse following the first chorus (which I concede sounds a bit awkward when considering the song's overall snarky appeal):\n\n\"...13, the beast is rising, the Frenchman did surmise\nThrough earthquakes and starvation, the Warlord will arise\nTerror, death, destruction pour from the eastern sands\nBut the truth of all predictions is always in your hands...\"\n\nLike I said, the guitar solos on this track and \"The Trooper\" (awesomely covered by Corsair and Hand Of Glory might I add!) are out of this World; in fact, I'm shocked - dismayed even - \"Die With Your Boots On\" has never been a live staple or fails to pop up in everyday \"Maiden lore/ adulation\". The same goes for the triplet infused, lyrically poignant shit-kicking battle anthem \"Sun And Steel\"; considering it's only 3.5 minutes long and really does sound a bit like \"a wheel, rolling on and on...\", although I've heard through the grapevine it's been played at a show in Japan once. \n\nAlthough Piece of Mind is far from being Iron Maiden's best album, it's an excellent showcasing of the Brits' stellar rock solid line-up which would go on to record such timeless worthies as 1984's Powerslave, 1986's Somewhere In Time and 1988's Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son, along with the must-have Live After Death \"World Slavery Tour\" double CD of course! \n\n*In regards to the bonus cover tracks released in 1995 under EMI, I'd eschew the trite ruination of Jethro Tull's golden oldie \"Cross-Eyed Mary\" but strongly recommend checking out the cool hot rockin' reprise of Montrose's \"I've Got The Fire\".\n\n\"Take you and your blade and break you both in two, break you both in two!\"\n",
        "\nAlthough the New Wave Of British Heavy Metal (circa the mid 70s to the mid 80s) encompasses numerous compelling bands, I tend to favor a select few which in my mind constitute the movement's big \"six\": Angel Witch, Judas Priest, UFO, Pagan Altar, Witchfinder General (these last two also lean towards the doom side of the metal spectrum) and most explicitly, Iron Maiden, formed on Christmas Day in 1975 and still going strong, having released its sweetly sixteenth full-length in 2015 amidst a veritable gallimaufry of live albums, compilations and B-Sides. Believe me, I was hard-pressed to choose my first \"Maiden-view\" (for shame!) but after due consideration settled on where it all started for me as an eager albeit nerdy heavy metal aspirant back in the 8th grade, namely 1982's classic The Number Of The Beast - which, might I add, was re-released by EMI in 1995 with a bonus CD comprising \"Total Eclipse\", a rather upbeat, rock-ish number and a live, Bruce Dickinson sung version of \"Remember Tomorrow\", premiering on 1980's \"namesake\" debut. \n\nThere's something inherently gripping about the NWOBHM; one can't help but revel in untold compelling guitar harmonies/ riffs/ progressions backed by pronounced, bouncy/ galloping bass lines and loose but perpetually pounding drum beats, capped by downright epic, usually high-pitched vocals and fluid, super melodic leads. As well, there's also a certain element I can't quite put my finger on but consistently draws me back to the aforementioned legends alongside many other less heralded stalwarts such as Blitzkrieg, Diamond Head, Holocaust, Traitor's Gate, Trespass and White Spirit. Call it authentic. genial or simply unpretentious flair but today's explosive \"traditional\" revival owes much to this highly revered bygone era. OK, enough with the banter (and compulsive listing)! Allow me to wax eloquent and nostalgic on Number Of The Beast's concise octagon of tracks, starting with its kick-ass, lyrically alluring opener, a knavish, Berserker infused slickster aptly titled \"Invaders\". Alongside Steve Harris' glowingly pulsing bass line and Adrian Smith/ Dave Murray's simple but catchy as hell guitar riffs, Dickinson grandiosely delivers his first time out with the London based quintet - dig the wicked, battle-some opening verse, the first amidst ships:\n\n\"Longboats have been sighted and the evidence of war has begun\nMany Nordic fighting men their swords and shields gleam in the sun\nCall to arms defend yourselves, get ready to stand and fight for your lives\nJudgment day has come around so be prepared don\u2019t run, stand your ground...\"\n\nIn particular, I fancy Dickinson's ever slight nasal twine as well as his poignantly drawn-out inflection on the word \"gleam\". That said, one reason I'm so taken by Maiden's third release is the way it sounds like a killer, perfect amalgam between the Brits' Paul Di'Anno-led days and its eventual, \"un-punkish\", more polished and straight up heavy metal sound already firmly established a year later with Piece Of Mind and in full swing on the succeeding masterpiece Powerslave (my first actual purchased CD). While most of the tracks reek of chthonian ardor - obviously the epochal title track, with its primeval bible verse quotation, the beautifully alliterated horror movie based \"Children Of The Damned\" as well as the infamous long-winded and spirited closer \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\" - a couple unabashedly veer off the crooked path, namely \"The Prisoner\", based on the popular TV series at the time (\"I am not a number, I am a free man!\" + sardonic laughter) and another top \"Beast\" pick along with \"Invaders\" and \"Children Of The Damned\", the sleazy, if not cheeky coming-of-age innocence squasher \"22 Acacia Avenue\", likely the sister track and logical conclusion to the debut's fond \"Charlotte The Harlot\", with such ribald and lewd lines as: \" Fifteen quid is all she asks for, everybody\u2019s got their vice\" and \"You can tell her that you know me and you might even get it free\". Suffice to say, along with the utterly pleasing and engaging sixth cut \"Run To The Hills\" - the snugly snagging opening/ main guitar riff was surely an ear-opener! - \"22 Acacia Avenue\" created quite a jubilant commotion amongst my classmates; without further prompts I was compelled to hear what all the fuss was about - for this I'm forever grateful.\n\nNumber Of The Beast is also the last album to feature drummer Clive Burr (RIP), soon to be replaced by the eclectic, one-of-a-kind Nicko McBrain, and while the latter, along with Harris, represents Iron Maiden's long standing bedrock foundation, I often ponder how the quintessential metallers' sound would have evolved otherwise. Regardless, Burr claims his own moments under the sun, er, dark star (another quaint NWOBHM band!) such as with the raucously pounding Angel Witch/ \"Dr. Phibes\" evoking intro to \"The Prisoner\" - a somewhat humdrum track at first but whose appeal rapidly escalates thanks to an incredible bridge and solo section - or maniacally thunderous drum roll ripping open \"Gangland\"; he also does a swell job of propping up \"Run To The Hills\". As well, team Murray/ Smith periodically steal the show in most spectacular fashion i,e. their impeccably phrased yet still scorching leads on \"Invaders\", the \"Number Of The Beast\", \"Run To The Hills\" especially and of course, the explosive rundown to the gradually incepting but highly comprehensive tour-de-force \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\". Long standing metal fans and gregarious newcomers alike can't help but revel in the ethereally haunting and melodic opening guitar progression to \"Children Of The Damned\" (in my opinion, nobody, and I mean nobody has ever managed to truly do this track justice cover wise) or the crisp, unrelenting guitar riff to \"22 Acacia Avenue\". \n\nI'd foolishly laid Iron Maiden's Number Of The Beast to the wayside so I'm now making up for lost time by fully re-rejoicing in its timeless magic. To the willing musical layman curious and open-minded enough to make a fortuitous foray into the wonderful World of heavy metal, particularly the NWOBHM, I'll say this much: Iron Maiden's Number Of The Beast from 1982 is a damn good place to start! \n\n\u201cWoe to you, oh Earth and Sea\nFor the Devil sends the beast with wrath because he knows the time is short\u2026\nLet him who hath understanding reckon the number of the beast for it is a human number\nIts number is six hundred and sixty six\u201d\n",
        "\nThe argument Brucey Brucey is the media star of Iron Maiden is a never-ending debate. His farewell from the band, which curiously coincided with their decline in popularity, almost provokes a cataclysm and the end of the band. I suppose Harris, with little common sense, thought and meditated long and hard on the decision to contract a strange dude like Blaze Bayley, and leave out more capable singers like Andr\u00e9 Matos. Blaze is not exactly a paragon of virtues, who can't perform at Dickinson's level. However, something good this good gorilla had, and Harris must have seen something in him when he put him into the studio for recording The X-Factor. Were backfired on them? If we could use the wildcard of the public, we'd say yes, but I'm going to risk and I'll say no, and I'm saying no because the first moment I put The X-Factor in my musical tinplate I've perceived this was a good record.\n\nEverybody knows the reason to buy a disc again. Because it's Maiden. Their slight style changes throughout the mid-90\u2019s are noticeable as is their transition into an acoustic intro/outro formula, which started on this album and continues into today. It\u2019s pretty safe to say that this is the 90's Maiden disc most worth getting. I'm aware that it couldn\u2019t be a pleasant or comfortable period of time and to replace a member of a group as large as Maiden is a difficult task. It becomes an even bigger challenge if the vocalist is the one replaced, since the voice is the hallmark of a music group. To replace Dickinson is not easy. Dickinson\u2019s departure certainly changed the course of the group, nor would say that for worse (for better, yes) because they already released two albums crawling for mediocrity. No Prayer is a rambling record, with no history. While Fear of the Dark was a bit more bearable as you'd had to skip only about 3 fillers throughout the album. But unlike those previous albums, this album, which was unleashed in \u201995, is a monument to worship. Perhaps entangled in melancholy and nostalgia.\n\nPerhaps the historical weight and quality of Dickinson was an inevitable slab in this world of comparisons, which you know they're hateful, but if we analyse this disc bypassing their discography, we'll realise that we're before an interesting disc. Musically speaking the album is darker, slower, and introspective at times. At the first time, this doesn't start with a fast and hook song, but it's fine done with a jewel called \"Sign Of The Cross\", a convoluted song of more than 11 minutes. Keyboards on the front line and with Blaze's voice gaining serving as the musical protagonist. \"Man On The Edge\" has a similar structure to \u201cBe Quick or Be Dead\u201d and is a single able to rival other classics like \"Lord Of The Flies\" or \"Look For The Truth\", and would be capable to even entering on their great musical repertoire, where Blaze glows at high altitudes. \"The Aftermath\" is another song that starts with arpeggios, which reminds me a lot of Sabbath\u2019s post-Dio era, and Blaze does a great job (another constant on the album, \"curiously\").\n\nIf there's a boring and soporific album in the history of heavy metal, this disc is. And the guilt of it isn't the poor Blaze Bayley, a hard guy who always gives 200% of what he has, anyone who has seen his live concerts knows what I'm talking about. The guilt of all this has Harris and company... That's who Bruce's fanboys will talk about. So far, there's everything to be a good record: inspired musicians, a correct production (very Maiden), and especially good songs. So far we found a much better album than several ones of Bruce's comeback, and I say so far because I haven't said anything about how wonder, great treasure this stuff is. Why did they close the way to proposals like \"Judgment Of Heaven\"? For me, it's the definitive track from the album. Unfortunately, the band forgot it like many others; but with no leaving their classic patterns, which are a true breath of fresh air from these British musicians. It\u2019s a pity this didn't have more importance in following years. I'm with the opinion that Dickinson would never return if Virtual XI was successful. In the end, the duck which was less at fault did pay. Which was Blaze and not the Boss, as it happens in all companies.\n",
        "\nI've been a Maiden fan since I heard their monumental album \u201cThe Number of the Beast\u201d. After hearing that classic album, I started to look into their catalog meticulously, and then I discovered other jewels such as Piece of Mind, Powerslave, and Somewhere In Time, all which managed to increase my admiration and respect for this band. So, when I saw this CD in a record store, I grabbed it and took it home to give it a listen. I wondered, what would Maiden do next? Would they return to Powerslave's sound or maintain the Somewhere in Time vibe? Well, they\u2019ve done it again, yet something altogether different. The album unleashed a great controversy by the detail of synth guitars, but it finished imposing itself and 30 years later it continues to be a classic, representing the most transcendental and creative moment in Iron Maiden\u2019s music.\n\nRecorded during a cold European winter in Munich, Germany, as opposed to the warm Nassau in Bahamas, and something which perhaps inspired the idea of putting a frozen Eddie in Antarctic ice glaciers, now we're welcome to a fantastic trip. Also to an itinerary with 8 stops and 44 minutes. This trip is truly an escape that travels far outside this world. \u201cInfinite Dreams\u201d has an unpredictably slow/mid-paced intro that turns into a complete headbang-fest; when the lead guitars kick in, the whole track doesn't stop surprising us until the end. This is what Iron Maiden fucking was and should still be, too bad this isn\u2019t the case. \"The Evil That Men Do\" has a slow atmospheric intro, and its first pre-chorus melts my soul and speaks to you as if it saying \"now I'll show you the chorus, wait, not yet!\". Then the chorus comes, loaded with overwhelming force and sensitivity, and after you suddenly notice the song has ended, you're listening to the title track. \"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\" has a real, epic feeling just like \"Rime of The Ancient Mariner\u201d and \u201cAlexander The Great\u201d. I love the break at the middle section where Harris and Nicko play the nice interlude part.\n\nThere\u2019s a song described as annoying: the seductive \u201cCan I Play With Madness\u201d starts with acapella singing and the same acapella is used within the chorus, but I have no problem with that, considering I\u2019m a person who also likes the annoying falsetto of Priest\u2019s \u201cAll Guns Blazing\u201d. One very \u201chuge\u201d problem (boo hoo!) that many contrarians find is the ending track, maybe because it\u2019s considered as a second-rate song. I've listened to many metal albums which I've enjoyed a lot of, like Twilight Of The Gods, it's an album that you\u2019ll find its greatness in its whole context; its closer is not another One Rode To Asa Bay, but it doesn't stop it from being a great album. Honestly, besides the title track, I don't care how or where the epics are located. That\u2019s silly, period. See Sign of the Cross by the way, or even Phantom of the Opera, so to speak. Well, the ending track is cool and adding thirty plus seconds from the same poem of \u201cMoonchild\u201d prelude is the most original thing I can find in a concept album. The first time I heard this song, I thought my player was on autoplay.\n\nReally, this is a relief for some fans I knew, who felt disappointed with the slower Somewhere in Time (in their opinion); although this album doesn\u2019t pretend to be a reminiscence to Powerslave, it\u2019s even better. Powerslave is often considered their best album; but not having the polished/raw characteristics, this album compensates in both songwriting and creativity. This record is completely perfect, I had to listen to it a couple of times, and only after that, I realized how great this album really is. The sense of sophistication is found on this album, with an unbeatable production, a slight change in Bruce's vocal style, drums aren't too loud, and the guitars sound very compact. I think Seventh Son is a better \"cooked\" record than Powerslave, and that's why I applaud the band for their bravery for trying to innovate (adding keyboards at that time, and for an established band as Maiden, was almost a suicide). So, Maiden stopped creating discs like this, and now, they just write cheesy and boring stuff. This is their greatest album, along with Somewhere in Time. That\u2019s how to experiment and make timeless masterpieces. Oh, and the cover is just surreal, like a Salvador Dali's painting. I have the UK vinyl version and there's nothing better like the vinyl sound, which usually is far superior.\n",
        "\nI'm wondering always why this wasn't one of first Maiden albums I bought since the band's official biography suggest that this is one of their best stuff, which I obviously agree. After many listen, my perception of this album has improved a lot, Piece of Mind looks like the logical direction after the apotheotic The Number Of The Beast. The differences between those albums seem to escape from an untrained ear, this album is somewhat more laid back, melodic, while the guitars are less sharp than on the previous album. Clive Burr did not resist continuing in the band, but his substitute, the incredible Nicko McBrain was willing with all world forces. The record features a luxury cover which we see how the band's members are sitting at the table about to taste a tasty brain.\n\nThis new lineup has a lot good to offer. The twin guitars of Dave Murray and Adrian Smith offer you devilish rhythms, harmonized melodies, and overwhelming solos perfectly compensated. The ardent Murray is blended with the melodic Smith, Steve Harris continues to demonstrate solidity, full of imagination as always and playing in a very comfortable way in his role as third string. The new drummer McBrain, who possessed a quite different style to Clive Burr, but easily the same technical ability, shows his skills since the record's first second. And Bruce Dickinson, fully incorporated, delights us with his various vocal lines. In conclusion, five members in top form providing one of their best exhibitions in heavy metal history.\n\nThe raw and metallic production by Martin Birch is perfectly combined with excellent lyrics and a handful of classic riffs, giving as a result, an almost perfect album. However, there are quiet moments which balance the speed songs, which are the bits in Revelations and Still Life, kinda different to what came before them, I mean, the lovely solo at the start of Still Life might be a reminiscence of Strange World and Infinite Dreams in the future. The last three songs tend to be acknowledged as the weak moments of the albums, well, not the last song in most cases, but I remember for a long time not thinking much of these three. Since then, however, I'd say only Sun & Steel falls into this category, for just not being as good as the other songs. Quest For Fire is a really cute song, the lyrics are quite fun. To Tame A Land, meanwhile, is a great song worthy of being an epic among the likes of Phantom Of The Opera and Hallowed Be Thy Name, probably not as accessible as those two though. It conjures up some great imagery, much like Still Life.\n\nMaiden's second real label blast was a strong effort which still holds a certain charm. Maybe the production is not \"perfect\" at all but is very good for its time and allows the guitars to cut and slice through the rather animated drum/bass work. Bruce Dickinson is at his best screaming here, Maiden's riffs are awesome and they show enthusiasm about thought things, with a standard production which is enough to capture the vibe, making it a timeless masterpiece. They went far with their quality over and over again, that's why Maiden have lived so long: they\u2019ve kept the bar high. Other bands may have done it better at any time, but Maiden have done extremely well for a longer time than any of them.\n\nThis is a more melodic work. It's also lengthier than its predecessor, a positive thing which only contributes to fan's pleasure. It's very important the band doesn't proceed to create another album like \"The Number Of The Beast Part II\", although it would be a perfectly easy and successful thing to do. Conversely, they evolved and progressed their sound, resulting one of the best, fullest albums. Who cares what detractors have to say, this is undoubtedly a very strong release. A true landmark in heavy/power music.\n",
        "\nFun fact: The opening riff to Sea of Madness is the same opening riff to Pantera's Domination 4 years before. If Nathan Gale's last name was Smith I'd have suspected royalty foul-play.\n\nThere is precisely one weakness in this album: \u201cThe Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner\u201d is about a minute too long. Everything else about this album is pure lower three string guitar harmonic bliss. It\u2019s almost the middle break of Phantom of the Opera turned into such a lifestyle that gets it own section of Cancun sectioned off for spring break. Yea there are synths on this album, but it ain\u2019t like they\u2019re playing the fucking Final Countdown. \n\nThis album also features the distinction of having the greatest Maiden song of all time: the title track. A brief keyboard stroke sets a melodic bed for one of the greatest opening licks ever. For about 8 measures or so you get to bathe in its bliss, until it disappears into a separate harmonic over the traditional Maiden gallop. You\u2019re momentarily disappointed, thinking that this is setup like The Hellion/Electric Eye where you only get to hear that melody at the beginning. But no, this insanely catchy guitar lick comes back...AS THE FUCKING CHORUS! Note to all musicians, this is how you write a song. What\u2019s that, you want riffs? Well, the opening to Wasted Years is legendary, and for good reason. The riff actually matches the outer space/dimensional travel theme of the album perfectly, plus the song is a positive live your life message! The opening to Sea of Madness is super heavy for Maiden standards, and as weird as Stranger In A Strange Land can appear sometimes, the opening riff is absolutely as metal as anything on Powerslave or Number of the Beast. A fine job of carrying on the tradition of quality. But as far as I\u2019m concerned you get your money\u2019s worth in those first seven minutes and the rest is free.\n\nWe also have to admit gotta admit something kinda ugly here. Bruce's ideas being shut down was probably the best thing for this album, and this band's trajectory. Sorry Bruce, but it appears as though your idea of elevating Maiden to Led Zeppelin levels by writing Going To Californias or Battle of Evermores just weren't gonna cut it for Maiden. A synth flavored album was dangerous, but keyboards AND acoustic songs? I don't have anything against acoustic songs, but this album was already polarizing enough. But both of those unlikely metal elements would have had the faithful Irons screaming Cold Lake (before Cold Lake) faster than you can say \"I'm your Turbo Lover.\"\n\nThe MVP award has to go to Nicko McBrain. If the previous two albums didn't establish him as the greatest drummer to only use one bass pedal, Somewhere In Time certainly does. All one needs to do is simply listen to those galloping kick triplets on the title track. At that speed? Sweet creamy Jesus, how he worked up the shin strength for his assault on The Wicker Man chorus doesn't seem quite as much of a mystery anymore. Then there's Alexander the Great...go back and re-listen to that jazz breakdown at 3:55 just for the drums. Now imagine trying to actually play that in time while keeping an eye on Adrian's solo to see just where you are. To say nothing of the little La Villa Strangiato moments with Steve that pop-up during Adrian's third uptempo solo about 2/3 of the way through the song. Trying to practice that section with any musicians will immediately require brain surgery.\n\nSomewhere In Time crowns Iron Maiden with an impeccable six chronological classic album streak, a feat only accomplished by Black Sabbath up to this point. Even perennial crank Varg Viekernes loves this album! Sprint to whatever record store is still standing and buy with smug confidence.\n\nRecommended Songs:\nCaught Somewhere In Time\nWasted Years\nAlexander The Great\n",
        "\nTo this date, Best of the Beast is Iron Maiden's very best compilation. The essential double-disc version features both the band's most famous hits and singles such as ''Run to the Hills'', ''The Trooper'' and ''Wasted Years'' and the group's emotional and intellectual epics like ''Phantom of the Opera'', ''Rime of the Ancient Mariner'' and ''Sign of the Cross''. This compilation offers a whopping two and a half hours of outstanding heavy metal entertainment without any fillers.\n\nIn addition to this, Best of the Beast offers three spectacular gimmicks. First of all, this release includes a brand new song entitled ''Virus'' which might easily be the best track the quintet recorded during Blaze Bayley's short stint with the band. The track opens with an epic, gloomy and slow overture that exemplifies an approach that has since become a trademark for contemporary Iron Maiden songs. The song then evolves into a melancholic, melodic and melodramatic track with decent keyboard sounds, majestic choirs and outstanding guitar harmonies. This rare collaborative songwriting effort involving all band members except the drummer also convinces with gripping lyrics that could be interpreted in two ways. The more literal meaning is a visionary criticism of business corruption in a world that has become dependent upon information technology. The indirect meaning of the song could be related to unjustified criticism of pitiless journalists and closed-minded fans who didn't give Iron Maiden's new line-up and especially singer Blaze Bayley a chance. This stunning track is worth purchasing this compilation alone but if you find that too expensive, you could also go for one of the numerous excellent single versions of the song on vinyl, disc and cassette featuring new cover songs, rare demo tracks from The Soundhouse Tapes or the forgotten Metal for Muthas recordings.\n\nThe second highlight of this album is the re-release of two rare songs from the demo The Soundhouse Tapes of the late seventies. ''Iron Maiden'' and ''Strange World'' capture the energizing yet versatile pioneer spirit of the band. So far, these songs had been extremely difficult to find and very expensive to purchase and including them on a disc for the first time ever is great fan service and makes this summary of Iron Maiden's career truly complete.\n\nThe third highlight is a brand new live version of the band's underrated epic ''Afraid to Shoot Strangers'' featuring Blaze Bayley on vocals. The song captures the band's cohesion, energy and talent on stage and the gloomy lyrics suit the track so well that one might even consider it an improvement over the great studio version. If you had your doubts about Blaze Bayley's vocal skills in concert, this track will impress you for sure since this might as well be the best live song ever recorded in Blaze Bayley's extensive career.\n\nIn addition to these three gimmicks, the songs from the band's early years have been remastered for this release. They sound organic and up-to-date without losing the energy and spirit of the original recordings. Along with the new track and the songs from the last studio album, these remastered versions make for a surprisingly coherent flow for this kind of release. The limited edition of this compilation also includes a sixty-page hardback book with numerous pictures recapturing the first twenty years in Iron Maiden's impressive career but even the regular booklet is an entertaining summary of the group's greatest moments. Finally, this release features a beautiful cover artwork honoring some of the band's most iconic artworks to date. It's both a great new piece of art and a respectful rendition of what the group had accomplished until that point.\n\nObviously, it's always recommended to purchase regular studio records instead of compilation efforts and this is particularly true for Iron Maiden since each of the band's records up to that point had a very distinct approach, atmosphere and flow. However, if you had only one Iron Maiden record to purchase or not enough money to grab the group's studio albums, Best of the Beast would be an excellent choice for faithful collectors, occasional listeners and new fans alike. If compared to later compilations involving Iron Maiden, Best of the Beast has a brand new track, covers every single studio album and includes rare gimmicks from the early years. Ignore the critics who obviously haven't understood the purpose of this release or who criticize any type of compilation record and get your hands on one of the best compilations ever released in the music industry.\n",
        "\nDuring 1980, three events marked the rebirth of the British metal scene. Firstly, the arrival of Ronnie James Dio to Black Sabbath, which represented a new opportunity for the Britons after the mediocre creative direction they were following since a couple of albums ago. Secondly, Judas Priest released an album that would reach a legendary status, even though it is far from what represented their creative peak. And the third is the rise of a new movement that would become revolutionary for heavy metal going forward due to the relevant changes that this music would constantly experiment from there onwards: the NWOBHM. Among other bands in the movement, Def Leppard, Angel Witch and Saxon released albums that would be substantial in the reshaping of metal music.\n\nBesides the aforementioned, Iron Maiden was emerging with a new sound, and despite the low expectations usually surrounding the debut releases, their self-titled release went far beyond. Displaying as much ambition as Judas Priest in their earlier releases, the British metallers brought out an impressive album that represented a middle point between the fast-growing punk movement and the metal music existing at that time. This combination is precisely the reason why the album persistently changes its vibe, transitioning from the happiness that best characterizes punk music in numbers like \"Prowler\" and \"Running Free,\" to the fury that the speed metal closing track expresses.\n\nThe complexity that even the most straightforward numbers display is another special ingredient in the formula. Due to that, you can expect certain tempo changes that make the songs unpredictable, perhaps except for the ballad \"Strange World.\" Outside of that, said changes appear throughout the album in both directions. On the one hand, \"Remember Tomorrow\" is pretty much inspired by \"Beyond the Realms of Death,\" and they share the tempo changes and tend to explode with powerful and harsh riffs in the choruses. On the other hand, the intensity in \"Charlotte the Harlot\" is slightly neutralized at the moment in which the passage resembling the previous song enters in. Now, leaving the extremes aside, the album offers other outstanding numbers that would even make up their concert repertoire going forward. Among others, the Mot\u00f6rhead meets Judas Priest speedish number \"Running Free\", the frenetic closing title-track (seemingly screaming \"Hell Awaits!\") and \"Sanctuary.\" (a song that was wipped-off from the first British editions, but featured in many reissues).\n\nAlthough the formula used by the band in this album would apparently be polished over the years, the overall package worked quite well at this point, and it could have been functioning well, even if Dickinson never arrived. So, regardless of being subject to amendments, the album shows the band at a very high creative point. Instrument by instrument, the songs are greatly done and are a good omen of the things to come. Considering the greatness and influence that this album has had over the years, you should go ahead with no hesitations and buy it.\n",
        "\nIt seems that finally, after years of a sickly commercial failure, Iron Maiden seemed to have learned the hard lesson inflicted on them, and started returning a little bit to their former roots having managed to recover some of the heaviness that characterized them in their early years. By saying this, I\u2019m not stating that this band went on to release another \"Powerslave\" or even \"Seventh Son\", something that would be a bad step for them to take since those masterpieces are nearly untouchable, and any attempt by them to do it again, I believe that today, that would result in a failed and uncreative deal by them. Virtual XI was the next logical step the band had to take after the so critically bashed \"The X Factor\", managing to walk among new paths, combining their obscure vein and skills from a more distinctive era, with some contemporary elements that made this album fresh and an exciting new deal to hear.\n\nThis is a comparison that many are always eager to get when it comes for to release a new album. I think this one is a more optimistic and less slow, in contrast to the previous album. Of course, there are some passages that remind me the Somewhere in Time period, but overall, I have to say this has a very cool and distinctive sound on its own right. Blaze Bailey lowers a little more than he should have in terms of vocal chords (I still think The X Factor is a superior album), because it sounds like he's trying too hard to sound like Dickinson, but eventually he was also capable of coming up with some of his most inspiring vocal melodies as well. Nicko actually works very well, manages to give the songs a certain dynamic and perspective. Steve Harris is always there when the songs need him the most, also very competent as always.\n\nThe highlights of this one are the awesome opener \"Futureal\", one of the strongest performances of the record, actually getting to be speedy in a subtle way, and with one of the best riffs. \"The Angel and the Gambler\" has the sweeter keyboard intro in the purest Deep Purple style, combining raw riffs and solos with those little modern details that make this so fresh and interesting to hear. \"The Clansman\" is also a cool song, with a calm intro and some cool variations between emotional filled parts and calm refreshing interludes, my favorite from the album. \"Como Est\u00e1is Amigos\" finish up with many different parts varying from some of the most melodic and calm parts to some of the most touching riffages Maiden ever came up with.\n\nThis is a lot worth of special mention since most of them are as inspired as The X Factor, maybe riff's work also tends to be a little simplistic, but still are good to hear and bang heads for a while. The production is very good and the whole tone of the album is a little different, this in part due to the tuning of the guitars and drum sound, something that could be a little bit improved, but as a final result is not that bad, it's not perfect, but it's not bad. This may be a good first step to walk through the metal road again, but there are much to travel to reach their old times' soul still, that many fans would see two years later. In a final thought, it's experimental Maiden, much heavier than the first Janick Gers\u2019 period and very worth getting.\n",
        "\nThis is the album that started the official career of the legendary Iron Maiden. It definetly doesn't sound like anything that would have been written during the Dickinson years... or at least it has little resemblance to said point in the band's career. It's more stripped down, more spirited in the vein of 70s hard rock and heavy metal (flirting with punk at times), along with a bigger emphasis on attitude.\n\nHowever, one thing that is rather peculiar is that it does show more resemblance to the band's later years than their next album, \"Killers\". It has more of an essence on vocal melodies, more of a melodic approach to songwriting, along with a bit more balladry. So this is probably a better album to go to if you want something that shows more resemblance to the classic Iron Maiden sound.\n\nThis album is relatively simple in terms of melody, yet it remains effective because of its innovation. The opening track, \"Prowler\" has a main chord progression that uses two power chords, but the pattern in which they are used has been done by both many other melodic heavy metal bands in later years, along with Iron Maiden themselves. But the song remains interesting today because of the second guitar's iconic wah-lead over it, which is followed by Paul Di'Anno's clean, yet forceful vocals.\n\nOther tracks have similar traits (not that the songs sound similar), such as \"Running Free\", which uses a broken-up palm-muting pattern that is sure to interest the listener, though not as much as the ridiculously catchy chorus, which has some of the most effective vocal-layering in anything NWOBHM-related. \"No Sanctuary\" also follows this, with its grimy simple melodies with just enough minor-tricks to keep it from droning, resulting in something that remains catchy and nostalgic by today's standards, without becoming predictable.\n\nNot to say that this album doesn't have its moments of instrumental genius. The title track makes use of jagged, complex, yet highly melodic riffs that are complimented by the galloping bass that remains independent from it, as it does for the majority of the album. \"Transylvania\" is a very accessible, yet genius instrumental that changes key many times without seeming jagged, but adding to the overall excitement (it might even be my favorite song of the album). It falls just a tad bit short of \"Genges Khan\", but it's still highly exciting, easier to listen to at first listen. \"Phantom of the Opera\", has one of the greatest main riffs of this band's entire career, working well as both an epic intro and a main course, complimented by Paul who constantly changes his vocal tone.\n\nSpeaking of Paul Di'Anno, he definitely makes use of his limited range. Or at least he chooses to limit his range, as he does plenty of high-pitched screaming on \"Killers\". He mostly does a soulful, yet powerful style of crooning, slightly reminiscent of John Devirill of Tygers of Pang Tang, or Kevin Heybourne of Angel Witch. However, as the album goes on, he begins to develop a more gritty vocal approach, particularly on \"Charlotte the Harlot\". Right before the solo kicks in, he bursts out into a bombastic fit of grunting that adds a shitload of tension to the track. In fact, I would argue that Paul is at his best when he sings like this. Especially when you consider how flat and boring he sounds on the two ballads.\n\nSpeaking of those two songs, they are both very bland and uninteresting, they both sound alike and the solos have very little to offer in them. They don't fit in with the rest of the music on the album and they are rather forgettable. Probably the only real complaint that I have about the album.\n",
        "\nThis album is quite an outlier in Iron Maiden's discography. It is often said to be the weaker of the band's two albums with Paul Di'Anno. This is because their self-titled debut has an overall more anthem-like atmosphere and a bigger emphasis on melody is involved there. But this album is more about kicking the listener's ass. It also has more dynamic, yet also more raw melodies, particularly in the guitar work. This is a more diverse album, a more energetic one, and an overall more unconventional one.\n\nThe bass also has a greater presence than it did on the debut, often carrying most of the weight on the album, but it also allows the guitars to do the same. \"Twilight Zone\" is the greatest example of this, with many intricate riffs, along with the bass breaking out into solo more than the guitar does, but it doesn't distract the listener from the rest of the music. They can also be perfectly leveled at times when their melodies are reasonably homogenized, but played with radically different picking styles, especially on \"Wrathchild\", which has a good enough melody to cause the listener to not realize the way that the instruments compliment each other until the third or fourth listen.\n\nSpeaking of \"Wrathchild\", it's probably the most accessible track on the album, as it is the simplest, but it has a melody that could fit on pretty much any album by this band. It was one of the first songs written by them, so I would imagine that they've been building on ideas related to it since it's birth. \"Purgatory\" is also a more accessible track, as it has a highly melodic and epic chorus, with a fast enough tempo to have the song be considered a proto-power metal track. There is a similar section after the first chorus, with a layered, technical and melodic riff that places high emphasis on the B and High E strings that could also be a solo. Paul's vocals on this track are also more soulful on this track.\n\nThe rest of the album is much dirtier and much more complex. It almost flirts with punk rock, particularly on \"Murders in the Rue Morgue\", which has a main riff that could fit on a Ramones album, despite the purely classic rock-inspired chorus. What really gives the albums sleazy edge is the vocal performance of Paul Di'Anno. He is much more gravely and volume-driven here than on the debut, along with his vocal melodies. However, he also shows his range more on this album, with much more high-pitched screaming. He also tends to follow the guitar riffs at their most complex moments (which there are a lot of), also at some of the more melodic moments.\n\nBut this album's greatest strengths are the moments are when they combine melody and raw energy together with intricate song structure. The title track is a great example, with its jagged, harmonized riff, jazzy bass lines, over-the-top vocals and grimy solos. The powerful drumming also supports it. But the true highlight of the album is the second instrumental, \"Genges Khan\". This song launches riffs down the listeners throat, with the bass pounding away in multiple directions, all of which don't distract the listener from the guitars, as said before, but the intricacy of both makes this all the more impressive. It uses both highly melodic and highly raw, NWOBHM-spirited bliss in multiple areas. The drumming on this track boarderlines on blast-beats at times, driving the song more than it does any other here. This song is Iron Maiden's \"The Dance of Eternity\", and it is one of the greatest songs in their discography, definitely their most underrated.\n\nThere are only two things that I can say against this album. One is that sometimes it can get clich\u00e9. But it often fits and is done in an inventive pattern. The other is the song, \"Prodigal Son\". It is a proggy ballad that lacks emotion, mainly due to the melodies being unfitting for the slow tempo, but especially due to Paul's awful attempt to show his softer side. It strikes all the wrong nerves with me, as he lacks the passion required to do so. Fortunately, they later obtained a vocalist who could do this with no problems at all (that vocalist of course being Bruce Dickinson).\n\nThis is a highly underrated album, but it is understandable as to why it doesn't get the praise that it deserves. Its complexity, combined with its more visceral and aggressive nature, along with its gritty vocals make it inaccessible to many Iron Maiden fans. It took me multiple listens to understand the album, but once I did, I found it to be a highly rewarding experience. While it is certainly flawed compared to some of the band's later albums, it is still a unique and highly interesting listen that deserves to be noted more than it currently is, far more so than the self-titled debut.\n",
        "\nUsually the most critically acclaimed albums of the metal genre are both not as perfect as often said, nor are they even the best work by the band that produced them. However, this doesn't mean that said album isn't exceptional nonetheless. This is the case for Iron Maiden's third record, The Number of the Beast. In fact, I don't think I've ever been alike to apply what I've written above with such sincerity for any other record. This is because this album is often considered one of the greatest metal albums of all time. It isn't perfect, but it is certainly beyond exceptional, even masterful.\n\nWhat makes this album so good is its balance between accessibility and innovation. It certainly sounds like a metal album from the early 1980s, with its NWOBHM flavoring, clear influence from early acts like Judas Priest and Black Sabbath (not that this is a doom metal album in any way), along with its analog production. But this album has stood the test of time among the masses more than any other albums related to it at the time because of the clearer usage of melody, more epic approach to songwriting, and of course the powerfully operatic Bruce Dickinson.\n\nDickinson deserves extra mention due to the fact that his influence has been running rampant in the metal scene ever since his appearance was first noted. His vocals are mainly in the tenor range and he uses a fair amount of chest, along with vibration (though not too excessively), which increases the dramatic nature of his voice just as much as his operatic vocal melodies do. Every now and again, he takes his voice into the stratosphere, though not to the extent that certain vocalists in modern power metal do. His pitch is flawless, and even when he goes off key, it's obvious that it's intentional, as he takes his voice to a growl, then taking it back with seemingly no effort at all. Though this album may be overrated, Bruce Dickinson is not overrated in the slightest.\n\nThe music is epic and melodic, while maintaining the rawness of acts that inspired them, though to a lesser extent than their previous two efforts. Songs are generally longer, more subject to tempo-changes, and the riffs are more intricate. This is complimented by the basswork of Steve Harris, which is more independent than on Killers. He is also more subject to break into a solo.\n\nSongs range from melodic speed metal (\"Invasion\"), galloping NWOBHM (\"Run To The Hills\", \"22 Acacia Avenue\"), along with all out epics, which I will mention later. It breaks out into rather strange and awkward territory at times, particularly the chorus of Invaders, which is in a radically different key, using a a jazzy-chord scale, led by Dickinson screaming. Something slightly similar is heard on the title track, with the technical jazzy bass solo after the first guitar solo.\n\nSpeaking of the title track, it's one of the epics. The intro builds tension better than any useless intro used by the average Scandinavian folk metal band, which goes into Dickinson screaming again, descending downwards into a vocal melody, under a pounding melodic guitar riff (my favorite riff of the album), going into the best chorus of the album. What is there not to enjoy about chanting \"6! 66! The nuuumber oof the beeeaast\", at a concert of this band playing this track live.\n\nThe other is an obvious choice. \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\" is this Bands masterpiece, what is there to say about it that hasn't already been said? The beautiful lyrics, the way that the riffs flow into each other like a river into the ocean, both solos, its all perfect. Dickinson compliments this song so well with his high sustain and vibrato that it's pretty much indescribable without parroting what I've already said about him. He certainly is bursting with passion on \"Children of the Damned\", along with the vocal ascension before the final chorus of \"Run to the Hills\" (one of the best vocal moments in metal), but he compliments the entirety of this track better than the entirety of any other.\n\nSo now that I'm done praising this album, what is it that makes this album overrated? It is none other than one song and ONLY one song alone. \"Gangland\" has a main riff that is practically a carbon copy of the one on \"Invaders\". The rest of the song is great, but plagiarism is evil, even when it's self-plagiarism.\n\nThis album was a landmark in the legacy of Iron Maiden, and it is an album that is both appealing to people wanting something accessible, along with those who want something innovative. It is a very important record, due to its influence, and it is a god damned masterpiece. Bar one song and you'll find one of the greatest albums in metal. While it isn't the perfect record that it is often made out to be (Hell, it's not even the best Iron Maiden album, even when you ignore \"Gangland\"), but it's a masterpiece nonetheless, as well as an album that should be owned by a fan of this band, or the genre of heavy metal in general.\n",
        "\nThe self-titled debut album of Iron Maiden must have been incredible to listen to when it first dropped in 1980. It's like nothing that came before it - The perfect fusion of punk, hard rock, and heavy metal of the 70's, with its' own flavor of guitar harmonies and a stronger bass performance than many were used to hearing at the time.\n\nAlthough I don't feel it gets off to the best start with a song like Prowler, which is about a dude exposing himself to women in the bushes and unlike anything they would go on to put out over the next 37 years, the rest of this album is solid for the most part and fun to follow because of how experimental it feels. Whether it's catchy yet prototypical rocker Sanctuary, the speedy head banging epic Phantom of the Opera, or a slower, more dramatic tune like Remember Tomorrow, Iron Maiden deliver in just about all of their attempts.\n\nSinger Paul Di'anno has a rough sound to him that gives the band that punk edge they were probably looking for at the time, and even better, he could hit some high notes too. With that kind of range, it didn't have to be all doom and gloom in the lyrics. Charlotte the Harlot is a good example of his range. The other highlight in this debut are the twin guitar attack of Dave Murray and Dennis Stratton. Although Stratton would leave the band shortly after this album, it's very much worth mentioning his contribution for some fast, hard hitting melodies along with Dave Murray's technical prowess.\n\nIt seems the most contentious part of the album between Maiden fans is the production. Band founder Steve Harris has gone so far as to say the album could never be considered great because of the lousy production. However, some feel that it adds to the authentic, underground sound which represent Iron Maiden's roots. They did after all spend 4 years playing in pubs and small venues before they even released this album! Me personally? I don't mind the sound. Though it is a bit jarring to hear how much better the production became in the next album!\n\nOverall, a great start to a great band. Not necessarily a masterpiece, but they were well on their way to producing a bunch of those!\n\nBest song(s): Phantom of the Opera, Sanctuary\n\nSkip: Prowler\n",
        "\nAs a follow up to their self-titled debut album, Iron Maiden's Killers delivers in almost every way, but just barely misses the mark of \"masterpiece\" . Not only have their production values vastly improved thanks to Martin Birch becoming their producer, this album also saw Adrian Smith join Dave Murray as the twin guitar attack we all know and loved from the 80's. Steve Harris took the bass playing to a whole new level and, at times, became the center of attention in a few songs, which feels rare in metal music. Paul Di'Anno gave his final performance with Maiden in this album, and, incidentally, he turned in one hell of a performance with an even greater range than the previous album. Drummer Clive Burr also shines at times here, although not quite the way he would in the next album (Hint, hint).\n\nThe only big misstep here is The Ides of March, which, while being a good song to hype up the next one (which hits you like a ton of bricks), sounds exactly the same as another song that came out a year earlier. Listen to Thunderburst by Samson and you'll understand. The story behind it seems to be that Steve Harris and a band member of Samson wrote it together a while back and agreed it was okay for both bands to use, but still, it feels recycled to hear the same song only one year later!\n\nWrathchild features a furious bass tempo by Steve Harris that shows just how good he is, while Murders in the Rue Morgue is based on an Edward Allen Poe poem of the same name and exemplifies early on what Maiden are all about. The song to really look out for however is the song by which this album is named: Killers is a rollercoaster ride of a song that overstays its' welcome just a little too long to be one of their best songs of all-time, but is still up there. Everything is going full throttle here, from Di'Anno's excellent screams, to Harris' prominent bass, or the twin guitar attack shredding more than ever before. This one should undoubtedly be one of your favorites!\n\nOther tracks, like Drifter, Innocent Exile, and Purgatory may take some time to grow on you, but they're well-made songs and worth listening to as well. Another unique song that features acoustics in it is Prodigal Son. I really enjoyed the variety on this one. Just when you think Killers is all out of different sounds to experiment with, it hits you with something like that, and I love every second of it!\n\nOverall, as I said in the beginning, Killers is a great album, but is missing that one aspect that makes it a full-blown masterpiece. The title track comes close, but the album is missing that one defining song that keeps everyone coming back all the time. It's filled with good or great songs though, so this is one you still won't want to miss out on.\n\nBest Song(s): Killers, Wrathchild, Innocent Exile\n\nSkip: None\n",
        "\nTo someone who has been listening to Iron Maiden from the start, it's understandable as to why they might not be so fond of this album. Maybe it's because my first impressions of the band came from their late 90's work, but I think this album is pretty great. The only problem is that it doesn't sound like Iron Maiden. \n\nThe first thing that any Maiden fan will point are the vocals. As much as I will defend this album, to say that Bayley's voice is able to match that of Dickinson and even Di'Anno just isn't right. Bayley's voice seems to have an unchanging, almost monotone quality to it. I really don't think he does the songs justice. Based on live performances of \"The Clansman,\" and the fan reaction to it, if Dickinson had sung on this album it would be much more popular with fans and it would fit into the Maiden lineup much better. \n\nIt also seems that this album has an abundance of slower and drawn out songs. \"The Clansman\" and \"The Educated Fool\" prove my point. While these songs aren't necessarily bad, I happen to like \"The Clansman\" very much, Iron Maiden hadn't done anything like this up until this point. Not bad, but these songs just didn't sound like Maiden... and really, they still don't. \n\nI also would like to point out the odd decision to replace much of the rhythm guitar with keyboards. This is especially prominent during most of the solos. It's not like Maiden hadn't used keyboards before, but they had never completely replaced an entire section of an album. Once again, this isn't necessarily bad. However, paired with an unfamiliar vocalist, it reinforces my previous point that this album just doesn't sound like something typical of Iron Maiden. \n\nNow pretend that this album was a debut of a completely new band and wasn't associated with the fantastic legacy that Iron Maiden created in the 80's. If this was the case, I think this album would have been viewed in a much better light. I think even considering Maiden's past when this album was released, \"Virtual XI\" holds up as a fairly strong album. Even with all the criticisms listed above, this album has its moments. \"Futureal\" is a real head banger, and \"The Clansman,\" even with its lack of tempo, has a creepy and mysterious feel to it that obviously stands the test of time next to other Maiden classics. This is a good album, but as most Iron Maiden fans have already pointed out, it just doesn't feel right to put it in the same category as \"The Number of the Beast\" and \"Piece of Mind.\" To conclude, \"Virtual XI\" is virtually okay.\n",
        "\nIron Maiden's A Real Live Dead One unites two live albums that were originally released back in 1993 when the existence of the heavy metal icons was in serious danger. It documents the concerts of the tour supporting the Fear of the Dark release and Bruce Dickinson's final tour with the band before leaving for about six years. This release is quite unique and has almost as many downsides as positive aspects.\n\nLet's start with the positive points. First of all, it's a much better idea to purchase this package consisting of two live records than buying them separately as it was the case originally. Secondly, the two albums have an interesting approach to Iron Maiden's music. A Real Dead One covers songs from the band's first five albums while A Real Live One focuses on studio records six to nine. This means that both records include some material that has rarely been performed live by the band. Bruce Dickinson does a quite solid job performing ''Remember Tomorrow'' even though I still prefer Paul Di'Anno's raw and melodic vocals to the vibrant half-ballad. The thunderous version of ''Where Eagles Dare'' is also quite gripping and much more interesting than the slightly sterile studio version. It's also quite nice to hear the dynamic classic heavy metal stomper ''Tailgunner'' that works very well in concert and should be played much more often. ''Wasting Love'' was performed in France and features a very amusing and entertaining introduction by Bruce Dickinson who speaks French and connects with the audience before performing the emotional ballad with a lot of passion. Thirdly, it's quite interesting that the twenty-three tracks were mostly recorded in completely different places. If you attended a specific concert, it's quite exciting to hear an excerpt of it on an official release.\n\nHowever, the album also has its downsides. First of all, the fact that the songs were recorded in different locations takes away any cohesion. This release feels much more like a compilation in random order than an actual live release. Secondly, the chemistry within the band wasn't very good during the tour and this can be heard in a few tracks when Bruce Dickinson performs without much motivation or when Janick Gers fails to pull his solos off as Adrian Smith would have managed to who had already left the band a few years earlier. The performance of ''The Number of the Beast'' is particularly underwhelming and it doesn't help that this track opens the record. Thirdly, the production of this live album isn't quite good. The guitar sound is sometimes thin and quiet, the rhythm section is a little bit too loud at certain points and the audience is at times way too loud and then again very quiet in the mix. Overall, the production sometimes doesn't sound very organic. The chemistry and flow the band had throughout the eighties isn't present on this release.\n\nConcerning the performances, this album is probably the weakest Iron Maiden live record despite a few pearls such as the quite intense performance of ''Hallowed Be Thy Name''. The main reason to purchase this album is the fact that many tracks were performed live that were rarely or never played again by the band after the conclusion of the tour. That's why this record is still essential for faithful collectors and fans. Occasional listeners should though avoid this record as they might get a negative impression of the band's live performances which are usually much better than what you get to hear here. They should rather pick the legendary Live After Death release of the eighties or the stunning Rock in Rio show that celebrates Bruce Dickinson's and Adrain Smith's return that rejuvenated the band. In the end, A Real Live Dead One is a passable live album with a few interesting choices but nothing more.\n",
        "\nHere is the perfect metal album that anyone will find ever. No orchestras, no backing choirs, no sudden interludes, or anything that seem to garner much praise nowadays, and which prevent Iron Maiden unleashing upon the world something truly godly. Anyway, this is a 100% classic metal album, with brilliant riffs, solos, songwriting, etc. One of the best albums of all time and mandatory in any collection; Black Sabbath have become the inventors of heavy metal, with their heaviness and their riffs, but Maiden's Powerslave has the other elements: wildness, rawness, virtuosity, which are also important in heavy metal.\n\nThe production here is notably flawless, giving the album a crystal clear sound where every instrument is at just the right volume. The vocals are done by the mighty Bruce Dickinson at his peak, and metal vocals really don't get any better. The bass is always audible and is interesting to listen to, Steve Harris lays down somewhat unorthodox basslines that just fucking works. The drums support everything else, and they provide a very solid basis for the rest of the band. Every solo that Murray & Smith plays on here is memorable, note for note after the second time you hear it. Really superb musicianship, and no wankery or fucking around, anything that is on this album really feels like it's in the right place.\n\nThe greatest opening track \"Aces High\" has catchy vocals, great riffs and leads, and some of Harris' greatest bass work. \"Losfer Words\" is a very well done instrumental, with good riffs and some catchy lead work, easily comparable to any Maiden's earlier instrumentals. \"Powerslave\" is up there with Hallowed Be Thy Name in awesomeness, contains a great main riff, a great chorus section, and hell soloing. That melodic build up to the solo section is very well done, and that riff under the chorus is one of Maiden's best. \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\" is quite notable, due to the fact that it's thirteen minutes long, and shows no sign of boredom, is pretty much brilliant the whole way through.\n\nPowerslave is what many (including Steve Harris himself) consider an uneven album. On the other hand, after thousands of listens, I've reached the conclusion that Powerslave is an album so great that few band will ever reach it, the secret of fully appreciating it is how much the rest will sink into you. The album was recorded in the Bahamas and it features possibly the best production Iron Maiden ever had, the guitars are so sharp and they are instantly recognizable. The cover is great and features many hidden details that are visible only on the vinyl version (Mickey Mouse strikes again!). Iron Maiden is one of the legends of world music, not only in the rock/metal scene, and this record, is possibly the one that has contributed to it. Already their predecessors, both The Number Of The Beast and Piece Of Mind, gave much to talk and many public to receive, but the british band knew how to follow the good steps, releasing an excellent album. If with The Number Of The Beast reached the #1 and demonstrated the movement called NWOBHM was successful, they could reach the top and cross all borders with \"Powerslave\", which was like touching the sky with your hands.\n\nSay what you want about Iron Maiden, but when these guys want to craft some truly masterful music, Powerslave is the epitome of this statement, a collection of penmanship and complexity that is truly legendary, every song is the most antithetical composition. Gone are the punk lyrics, and the guitar duels are endearing, with flawless demonstrations of songwriting that are complex in execution rather than flamboyance. In conclusion, if you're looking for a great album then get this, erect a shrine to it or something.\n",
        "\nIron Maiden's The Number of the Beast is one of the best classic heavy metal albums ever and definitely deserves the legendary status it has achieved since its inception. \n\nThis record marked a fresh start for the band with new singer Bruce Dickinson. While the band's first two releases had more rebellious, raw and sinister lyrics and sounds, The Number of the Beast still has somewhat dystopian lyrics but a much more epic, melodic and uplifting sound. The album offers more melodic guitar solos than before, several tracks are much faster than what the band used to play and Bruce Dickinson's epic high-pitched vocals are liberating and transmit a passionate lust for life. This vivid mixture works particularly well in the first single ''Run to the Hills'' that sounds rebellious in an uplifting way despite the serious and sinister topic about crimes committed against the First Nations. Instead of choosing an overtly moralizing and negative tone to approach the topic, Dickinson's vocals transmit the resilience of the First Nations and their will to live. ''The Prisoner'', inspired by the outstanding dystopian television series of the same name, has a very similar approach. Instead of delivering a desperate and sinister approach to discuss the narrator's and main character's mysterious abduction, Bruce Dickinson incarnates a character that never gives up and is ready to solve any problem.\n\nThere are still a few songs with a more sinister touch that are also perfectly sung by Bruce Dickinson who manages to hit both the highest and lowest notes in the outstanding milestone and absolutely haunting ''Hallowed Be Thy Name''. This song still is one of the best heavy metal epics to this day and young bands should take some notes here. Bruce Dickinson also convinces as wicked narrator in the nightmarish title track ''The Number of the Beast'' that portrays both the life-affirming and profoundly gloomy sides of the heavy metal spirit. While outsiders still criticize the song's unholy lyrics until today, they haven't understood that you have to accept, cherish and even embrace the dark sides of life in order to fully enjoy the beautiful moments in our existence. This song exactly transmit this attitude of still shining in the dark.\n\nTwo tracks that are often criticized on this album are the fast opener ''Invaders'' and the gloomy ''Gangland''. I have always thought that ''Invaders'' is a really underrated track that is nearly on the same level as ''Run to the Hills'' and ''The Prisoner''. It deals with a sinister topic and yet feels absolutely uplifting. It's one of Iron Maiden's fastest and most unchained tracks ever and in my opinion a perfect song to kick off an album on a high note. It literally invades the listener's heart and soul who might have been skeptical towards this record because of the line-up change. This song is a perfect introduction to Bruce Dickinson, just like the single ''Run to the Hills''. The criticism directed towards ''Gangland'' is already more justified in my book. It has a gloomy atmosphere but is lacking the depth, energy and enthusiasm of the other songs. It's the only song on the album that might fit better to Paul Di'Anno's rawer voice or even Blaze Bayley's gloomy vocals. Some people claim that ''Total Eclipse'', that was released as a b-side on the single ''Run to the Hills'', would have been a better choice than ''Gangland'' but I have to disagree. ''Total Eclipse'' is one of the most boring tracks in the band's early years and doesn't impress me at all aside of the interesting lyrics. This song shouldn't have been included on the remastered version of the record either because it really drags the album down.\n\nIn the end, we have one average track plus a weak b-side versus seven genre-defining heavy metal anthems that have stood the test of time. The Number of the Beast might not be the band's most atmospheric, epic and intellectual album but it's the band's most energizing output by a mile in my book and this vivid spirit hits the listener like a train from start to finish for a length of slightly above forty minutes. This vivid roller-coaster ride really defines the spirit of heavy metal where gloomy topics meet an uplifting attitude. The Number of the Beast is a record any metal fan should own without a doubt. Let me tell you that this album is an unexpected grower, even thirty-five years after its release and I can only recommend revisiting this genre milestone.\n",
        "\nIron Maiden's Piece of Mind has always been a mixed bag for me. This is partially due to the fact that the album was released in between two milestones called The Number of the Beast and Powerslave. Maybe it didn't help that I discovered the outstanding Live After Death record before this studio album because I ended up missing the pace from the live cuts on the studio album. I think that the album has a lot of fluctuation. There might not be a real stinker on it but the songs range from average to amazing.\n\nThe middle section has always been a highlight for me and might even be the best middle section of any Iron Maiden record for that matter. Tracks like the galloping ''The Trooper'' and the vibrant ''Die with Your Boots On'' have that ferocious and juvenile energy I was initially missing on the album. ''Flight of Icarus'' is a great classical heavy metal track that manages to sound epic despite its short length and relatively simple music thanks to an absolutely stunning performance by Bruce Dickinson who delivers one of his best career performances on this album. My favorite song is though the atmospheric and slightly progressive ''Still Life'' that already gives us an idea of the band's future sound.\n\nThis brilliant quartet of songs is surrounded by five tunes that can't fully convince. ''Where Eagles Dare'' kicks things off very well with a short drum solo, heavy riffs and Bruce Dickinson's powerful and majestic vocals but the great start loses its momentum in an overlong instrumental middle part that goes nowhere. ''Revelations'' has similar issues. The lyrics are really intriguing, the calm and melodic parts are haunting and Bruce Dickinson sings like a god among mortal men. However, I prefer the much faster live version and always thought that the middle part was a little bit stretched without adding anything to the tune. Album closer ''To Tame a Land'' has almost identical problems. The track builds up a haunting and mysterious atmosphere and the initial storytelling is quite gripping but the middle section just plods along, loses momentum and fails to elaborate upon the great introduction. The song has some great ideas and interesting lyrics but can't convince from start to finish like other epics of the band such as ''Hallowed Be Thy Name'' and ''Rime of the Ancient Mariner''. Iron Maiden's songwriting is slightly off focus in the longer tracks. It isn't as bad as some of the band's contemporary epics but a more collaborative input during the songwriting might have made these songs a little bit more creative, diversified and fleshed out.\n\nThe other two songs are simply stated quite average and easily forgettable. ''Sun and Steel'' only has Bruce Dickinson's vocals that rate things up while ''Quest for Fire'' doesn't even have that. Dickinon's vocals sound overtly expressive and almost ridicolously exaggerated and the vapid chorus doesn't help either. The vivid rhythm section saves the track and pushes it to an average level but it's still clearly the worst tune on this album and one of the weakest songs in the band's early years.\n\nThe production has its positive and negative sides. What I like about it is that it sounds heavy and thundering and especially the bass and drum sounds are really tight and energizing. On the other side, the guitar sound stands out a little bit less than usual and isn't as clear and melodic as on some other records. Piece of Mind has a distinctive and original production but I prefer Iron Maiden's classic sound on both this record's predecessor and follow-up.\n\nIn the end, it's a matter of taste whether you prefer this record that is more heavy, grounded and slow or Iron Maiden's more melodic, progressive and vivid releases. I tend to prefer the latter and that's why Piece of Mind is an album that I respect from an objective point of view but that is neither among the band's best nor its worst records on my list. Whenever I revisit the album, I tend to listen to the awesome middle section only because the rest of the record doesn't really blend in with that and might even be slightly incoherent. Piece of Mind is still an essential part of Iron Maiden's discography but new or occasional fans should rather grab a copy of both The Number of the Beast and Powerslave and not choose this album first just because it includes ''The Trooper'' and has an iconic artwork.\n",
        "\nThere will always exist the same division of opinions regarding the evolutionary line of Iron Maiden, on the one hand, those who say that the band repeats formulas to satiety; on the other, those who claim that over time they were uprooted from their own sound. On the other hand, I take a more optimistic approach on both fronts and put them into an only opinion: Iron Maiden have lived in constant and noticeable evolution, but keeping intact their musical identity, preserving the most basic aspects that define them and that make them unique in the history of heavy metal world.\n\nHere it is, the biggest release of 2003 in many of our minds, and expectations have never been higher following the immensely popular previous album. This album lives up to expectations and continue the tradition of Maiden ruling the heavy metal world.\n\nYes. Jam-packed from beginning to end with all the instant-classic riffs, choruses, and solos the way only Maiden can do them, this album is a fan\u2019s wet dream. A quick warning for those of you who disliked Brave New World: you won\u2019t like this album either. It's essentially the exact same formula as that album, all the way down to copying the title track's chord pattern and sound exactly for the title track of this album. You could sing the \u201cBrave New World\u201d lyrics over the Dance of Death title track or vice versa, they are so identical. Additionally, chord patterns and sequences are recycled quite often but, who really gives a damn? This is Maiden doing what they do the best. Bruce is as clear and powerful as ever, the guitar solos are generally as good as early Maiden albums, and Steve Harris\u2019 songwriting is still pretty good, even though it's clear he is running out of ideas for the standard Maiden song formula.\n\nSmith once again is pulling out the same quality of solos that made him such a guitar god back in the 80's. Janick has also found a style of playing that now complement rather than copies Murray's style of soloing. Which of course still sound like a pure explosion of energy. Harris and Nicko show once again why Maiden have the best rhythm section of all metal bands, while Bruce Dickinson adds the 'Spinal Tap' to the songs which make what they are, pure classic heavy metal, and it's still as relevant today as it was 30 years ago.\n\nAll in all, Dance of Death is a great album for all of Maiden\u2019s billion or so fans. For those of you who never really \u201cgot it\u201d however, you won\u2019t find anything here to change your mind. They recycled the formula that was so successful with Brave New World, with mixed but overall positive results. I have no doubt that this album will grow on me more with time, but I\u2019m here to give you a reason after only two complete listens for a reason: I\u2019m a die-hard Maiden fan, pretty much anything they do I love with enough patience, and any review I give on this album after extensive listening will be subject to that bias.\n\nStill and all, highly recommended to any and all Iron Maiden fans, unless you specifically didn\u2019t like Brave New World.\n",
        "\nFor every Iron Maiden fan who has played the 80's classics on their player 100 times over each, coming into an album like this, probably you're not going to be pleased at all. In fact, you're probably going to be so pissed off that you would deem it the worst Iron Maiden album ever made.\n\nThe X Factor was the first album of Blaze Bayley, and he has input on the songwriting on his first album unlike anyone else in maiden excluding Harris and Murray. And it's quite easy to see that he influenced this album indeed. If you don't like Blaze as a singer, of course, you're going to not like this album. I like Blaze's voice, it's world apart from Bruce, but it suits this album.\n\nThis is the darkest, stormiest Maiden album, and they will never again make material like this. Even Virtual XI was significantly different from this one, and that's a bad thing, as I consider Virtual XI the worst Maiden album. Lyrically this album features Harris' divorce and there are a few tracks that reflect how lost he seems to be feeling like in \"Judgement of Heaven\" or \"2 AM\", and also war, which some songs reflect the Vietnam war. The production is fairly good, it's a lot different to previous maiden albums, I would say it is the darkest sounding production, toned down upper midrange in the guitars and recessed treble, but not rolled off. The guitars are sort of sound a bit veiled and energy lacking in low tone and on some songs, there's a bit of distortion on the snare drums. All these \"factors\", make this album a heterogeneous disc in terms of compositions, structures and performance.\n\nAt most the best part of this album, which is simply amazing is that some of the guitar riffs and basslines and drums working together are amazing, some of the greatest things that maiden has ever done. Such as when Maiden has this progressive part of \"Sign of the Cross\" which gets the listener more and more built up. It's fucking amazing. There are other instances of this on the album too.\n\nThere are some top songs on this album that are not recognised enough as Maiden greats, and those songs are \"Blood on the World's Hands\", \"The Aftermath\" and \"The Edge of Darkness\". These songs have powerful lyrics, normally I've no problem with the lyrics, but those songs stand out from the rest on the album in this category. Not only that, but the structure, music, solos, acoustic bass are equally as fantastic. The Aftermath portrays most of the feelings a soldier would have after coming home from a war, as having done plenty of war history.\n\nListening to this album is like giving an expensive wine to someone who doesn't like wine. At first he will detest it for its rough taste, its hardness of palate and strong aroma. While the same liquid in a discerning palate, will have the necessary time to repose, to perceive its aromas and nuances in a suitable cup, which becomes an unique experience. Now I can say my palate has evolved. I'm a wine taster.\n",
        "\nOften underrated, but never forgotten, Iron Maiden's second effort after after their promising debut offers up their most relentlessly brutal, speed-galloping groove attack that would sadly be the final album singer Paul Di'Anno did with them.\n\nFrom the start, you notice the crispier, more metallic production of Killers, a strong improvement from the debut's somewhat flatter execution. Here we see Maiden in a rare form, compared to these days; blazing solos, a groove-heavy bass, shredding guitars, and songs that know when to end. Quite a large majority of the numbers on here range from 2 to only 4 minutes, with only two tracks breaking the 5 minute barrier. Although this may leave many wanting more, I think that it only adds to the hard-edged assault that the music provides. Quick, upbeat bursts of NWOBHM perfection.\n\nOne thing I must bring up now is the vocal performance of Mr. Paul Di'Anno. Anyone that had their doubts about his capability as a front-man to the greatest metal band will be blown away by just how spectacular he comes off here. Almost like he knew it was his final hour with the band, Di'Anno shows off the awesome progression of his vocal range delivery, all the while maintaining his street-wise, nasty bite from the predecessor. With the high-pitched wails at the beginning of \"Killers,\" to the strong falsetto notes on the magnificent \"Twilight Zone,\" Di'Anno doesn't just prove he's more than capable of stepping up to the plate, he can match the epic levels of that of future vocalist Bruce Dickinson.\n\nThe instrumentation of course is top-notch coming from these guys. Steve Harris' bass is present more than ever: laying down thick, heavy notes that keep the groove in tact. Finally we get the twin-ax guitar assault of Dave Murray and Adrian Smith, and their form is as perfect as it gets. Smith himself stands out more as a performer than previous guitarist Dennis Stratton, having more character in his playing. And ow my god, Clive Burr. This man was never better; he lays down the foundation for the blistering, headbanging attack that many later thrash drummers would incorporate.\n\nDuring this period in the band's career, when concerning their lyrics, the band hadn't really begun playing songs based on historical, literary tales. Instead, the lyrics deal with very personal conflicts, sometimes going very foul. This is best heard on \"Innocent Exile,\" and the as before mentioned title track. All of this only seems to add the album's overall dangerous atmosphere.\n\nKillers has, and always will be, a misunderstood record that will leave up a lot of room for discussion among fans. Never before, or after, have Iron Maiden recorded something that sounds like it, but I guess that's the sum of all their 80's material. Although it may seem like it's unappreciated at times, nothing can take away from the unrelenting experience that Killers provides. Absolutely all killer, no filler. Truly an album that lives up to the name.\n",
        "\nThis album is too often dismissed by many as being a poor relation to its eponymous predecessor and its successor, The Number Of The Beast. Although I wouldn't agree it's not quite as good as those, because it is an immense album, being way ahead of the rest of the NWOBHM pack in most every respect, even the debut.\n\nIt is perhaps true to say though that 'Killers' has the appearance of a stopgap release, with songs which had been left over from the last album and some which were amongst the first Steve Harris had ever written. It also was the last album to feature Paul Di'Anno, soon to leave the band in a haze of drug and alcohol problems, and the first album to feature Adrian Smith. Surprisingly then, it coheres fairly well and the production perhaps has more guts than its predecessor, thanks to veteran Martin Birch (who'd worked on 70's masterworks from Deep Purple, Wishbone Ash and Rainbow). \n\nThe album kicks off quite splendidly with the instrumental \"The Ides Of March\", characterized by some thundering twin guitar work from Dave Murray and new boy Adrian Smith, amidst some stunning percussion from Clive Burr. Instantly obvious here is the increased confidence in terms of musical ability, something which will become even more apparent later on. This song segues into one of the band's anthems 'Wrathchild', a rip-roaring rocker with fulsome bass from Steve Harris and characteristically guttural vocals from Paul Di'Anno. The interplay in the instrumental midsection harks forth to the bludgeoning riffery that Metallica would later take even further in the thrash movement. Despite a rather odd structure, the title track is an absolute classic, with some particularly fine rumbling bass riffs from Steve Harris and a burning vocal from Di'Anno. It has some of the finest twin guitars yet heard on a Maiden track, too.\n\nEven though heavy metal was already around at the time as bands like Judas Priest, Saxon, etc. were making heavy albums along with Maiden, it really wasn\u2019t until that fateful day in 1980 that NWOBHM came to its peak when this band released their debut album. That album along with this one really makes an impact in the scene, especially this one, as Adrian Smith was a huge factor on this album. Anyway, this album is godly, in my opinion, and it doesn\u2019t get enough recognition when compared to The Number of the Beast, or surprisingly, the previous disc.\n\nSo all in all, this is a masterpiece, and it should be an excellent addition to any self-respecting metal collection. There are no dull or boring moments on this album, and every song stays consistent and heavy. I have a hard time deciding between this and the previous album, as both albums kick the shit out of a lot of NWOBHM albums ever done by other bands. This is an underrated classic that, unfortunately, does not get the credit it deserves. This was one of the first metal albums that I bought, and I still listen to it quite often. It was pretty much this album that converted me.\n",
        "\nIron Maiden are one of the world's most revered heavy metal bands, they are also one of the most credible, as they have stuck fiercely to their guns regardless of trends in the music world. Ultimately it has paid off, as metal's resurgence of recent years has seen them hailed as heroes. \n\nWhen this debut came out though, Maiden had already been around for years. Steve Harris had masterminded the band since the mid-70s, as well as their distinctive sound- a mixture of crunching heavy rock with progressive tendencies. By the end of the 70s, a new scene had emerged which Maiden could at last fit into New Wave of British Heavy Metal. After a few, slightly tentative recordings, they had finally got the chance to record a fully fledged album. It still sounds utterly brilliant to this day, and is still, in the eyes of many, the greatest album the band had ever done. It's certainly one of the greatest debut albums of the whole genre- up there with Black Sabbath's debut, but far exceeding Judas Priest's and The Scorpions', plus contemporaries like Saxon and Def Leppard's first shots at glory.\n\nFans of the more famous Bruce Dickinson-led incarnation will be surprised at how rawer and vital this album sounds to what they are used to. Of course, it's the more street smart, punky Paul Di'anno on vocals for this era of the band. Di'anno isn't a bit like his successor but nonetheless is an excellent vocalist. His raw tonsils make storming slabs of punk-metal like 'Prowler' and 'Charlotte The Harlot' even more powerful, both being characterized by his aggressive vocals alongside the driving riffing and relentless rhythm section.\n\nSteve Harris' progressive influences are on show again in the technically astonishing instrumental, \"Transylvania\". The whole band rattle through this piece and its many sections seamlessly- there are faster and fiddlier solos out there today, but I'd take this every time as it has such guts and bravado that is often lacking from today's techno-flash metal. There are some old fan favorites here also. The aggressive punk stomp of \"Running Free\", with its relentless drum beat and street urchin vocal alongside some Wishbone Ash style guitar harmonies, still sounds brilliant now and was a sizeable hit in the UK when released as a single. \n\nThe debut also gave birth to a song that's probably been in every set the band have played since it was created- Iron Maiden itself. The guitar work here is excellent and the interplay is top notch, and Di'Anno's vocals make this statement of intent sound truly in your face. \"Sanctuary\" (originally a single-only track) is another song that captured the imagination of the metal fan base, yet again, Di'anno's rough and ready vocalizing made sure it had a certain amount of punk crossover. This was a perfect example of a song that Dickinson could never convey the same way as Di'anno effortlessly does here.\n\nAll in all, a truly superb debut that was probably the finest album of the era in the NWOBHM boom. Certainly, it sums up that whole period in heavy metal extremely well, and is a more consistently excellent album than most of the other albums from 1980. Some, notably Steve Harris himself, have criticized the overly clean production, but it's professional sounding enough for me, and refreshingly doesn't suffer from the murk that many early NWOBHM albums unfortunately have. This is probably the most direct album the band ever made, even though future albums would improve on this already incredible blueprint. Still, it's a truly essential cornerstone of any metal, even music, collection.\n",
        "\nAfter the debut and Killers, they lost their singer Paul Di'Anno. Bruce Dickinson finally joins the band and releases an album that shits all over the first two, which were still excellent in their own right. The instruments sound fresh and Bruce's voice sounds clean and unforced, unlike Di'Anno sometimes did. The solos on this album are nothing short of incredible and are beaten only by the solos on Seventh Son, but it still kicks so much ass in its own right.\n\nThe riffs continually kick ass from the beginning of this album all the way to the very end. The guitar work is amazing, Dave and Adrian bring a character to the guitars that to this day has never been matched. Good old Steve is right there with his solid double bass line, and Clive never misses a beat between songs on his drumset. Another thing is the extremely awesome cover implies that Eddie being controlled and yet simultaneously control pure evil, but that's all just a show. It's a way to shock people in order to sell more records, I mean, is not a bad thing. Whatever, music is here, and no fucking one going to take that away from.\n\n\"Run to the Hills\" has a fantastic riff set and chord progression. And the chorus sounds like a fucking choir of angels tore off their wings, put on some leather and started kicking some ass. \"The Number of the Beast\" is the single most imitated riff set in all of metal. And just when you thought you've heard everything, it's throw in some spoken-word intros to kick your ass before you even start the song, like in The Prisoner. There's also \"Children Of The Damned\" to be considered here, it's a ballad, it absolutely takes a dump on all but the best of the ballads metal has to offer. I mean, how many people can be singing a ballad and still be pissed off and cranking out riffs at the same time? This song rules. Period. \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\" starts off with riffs that kick the shit out of you from beginning to end, and the vocals are mournful and pissed off, forgiving and harsh, all at the same time. And the melody line, you know that hundreds of bands have tried to copy that melody line and ended up doing nothing but sucking wind. This song is the perfect sample to do that.\n\nJust like Seventh Son, this album is mostly a spectacle of the guitarists. Their riffs, solos and harmonies are just astonishing! Also Clive does a wonderful job here, especially on \"The Prisoner\". Bruce, as usual, is in a great form, he's still a god!\n\nThe band released this awesome album, which I'm sure you've already bought, seeing as how only a loser of the absolute highest degree would not have already purchased this work of perfection. This album is simply a masterpiece and is the basis by which all metal is formed, judged, sentenced, and handled. It's like the bible of metal, sort of like the lost gospel of Bruce for your own good book. Although they would surprise us later again with their 1988 album.\n",
        "\nIt's 1988, Judas Priest released the Ram It Down album, and even so didn't meet fans expectations and it was literally run it by this album. And damn, they did it. Seventh Son of a Seventh Son is probably the most memorable Maiden album of all time. This album made and still makes tribute bands, such Powerwolf, go wet.\n\nAnd if someone wonders why, he shall be pinned to the wall and forced to listen to this album from the beginning to the end. The speedy headbanger \"Moonchild\" shows in the chorus what kind of a singer Bruce is. Also it is needless to say, the chorus is very ambitious and superb. While songs like \"Infinite Dreams\" really bludgeons the listeners with its great guitar riffs and great vocals. Overall, the album's sound is perfect, the guitars are audible and the drums too, and for once, Steve's bass is not 'too' loud.\n\n\"The Prophecy\" calms the listener down a bit for the last two tracks. Simply put, they are damn good tracks. The Clairvoyant's melodic guitar intro is something like which makes me go mad. What can you expect, an awesome song in the vein of the other singles? It seems that the album only gets better and better in every listening. \"The Evil That Men Do\" with its catchy guitar intro is just a hint of what is to come: the amazing epic title track. This one works perfectly as the first track on the second side from the album. Really, there's nothing more perfect than the Seventh Son's solo. It made me cry at the first time I heard it.\n\nAs an add, the fanbase and the press at large gave this album the most positive reaction Maiden have had ever. Although the band members don't consider this one as a concept album, nevertheless it feels like one, having a 'complete' feel to it with some lyrical threads that run throughout the album and the accompanying reactions. Overall if you want to listen to an album full of emotion and great guitar work I believe that this album is for you. But it\u2019s not only for the fans of Iron Maiden, this album is for everyone who likes heavy metal music with catchy choruses and melodic songs.\n\nThis album has it all, everything that a metal fan could want. Sharp guitar synth and solos, great riffs, excellent vocals and a great rhythm section to back it all up. This album contains some of my favorite Iron Maiden songs of all time. Each song tells the story and then stops before it gets boring. The tracks flow together nicely and fit very well next to each other. Probably the best metal album of all time along with Rust in Peace, Symbolic, Coma of Souls and Blood Fire Death.\n\nI myself didn't use to be a very Maiden fan, but when I heard this album, it completely changed my outlook on music. Since then, I have bought more Maiden albums (Somewhere in Time, Powerslave, Piece of Mind) and while they are all excellent, none of them will ever compare to the greatness of Seventh Son. I guess there's nothing else for you to do, buy the vinyl. Avoid as much as possible the other format releases (CDs, MP3s, etc), this album sounds warmer and better in vinyl.\n",
        "\nI remember the days when this album was published. Iron Maiden wanted us to believe that the 7th son of a 7th son has supernatural powers. Even if this were true, it unfortunately does not mean that a concept work about such a creature is fascinating. My only son, who is the first son of a first son, is much more fascinating. Crude comparison, I know, but to express it differently: this disc was never a regular guest in my CD player. \n\nOf course, from a purely objective point of view, \"7th Son...\" was an important album from a very relevant band. Yet a review has always a subjective nature and therefore I do not care about this undisputable fact. It is therefore time to grumble. First of all, I do not like the sound. It is light and airy, overly clean and screaming for radio airplay. \"Can I Play with Madness\" is like a slap in the face of a metal fan. Its unbearably happy vibes and the commercial character drive this piece of shit into the ground. As almost every other band with a rich discography, Iron Maiden have released a lot of rather average compositions and that's no big thing. Nevertheless, in case of this song, I wonder why nobody realized during the record session that this insubstantial number is completely embarrassing for the flagship of heavy metal. And, honestly speaking, \"Infinite Dreams\" with its soft segments is not much better. It wants to build a contrast to the pretty furious opener and the arrangement of the first two songs reminds me of the running order of \"Piece of Mind\". \"Where Eagles Dare\" and \"Revelation\" are a comparable couple at the beginning of Maiden's fourth full-length. Too bad, that \"Infinite Dreams\" is light years away from the second song of \"Piece of Mind\". It fails to create any kind of tension.\n\nWhat really angers me is the fact that the grave defects of \"7th Son...\" are not based on courageous experiments that have gone wrong. It's just this dog-like devotion to the mainstream that makes me sick. The polished melodies of \"The Clairvoyant\" must be mentioned at this point as well, although I admit that Harris and his vicarious agents managed to create a good, more or less heavy and memorable chorus for this song. Nevertheless, my thoughts are very simple: a heavy metal band is a heavy metal band because it writes heavy metal music. Iron Maiden have partially ignored this matter of course during the recording of \"7th Son...\" and this is condemnable. \"The Prophecy\", a lame monstrosity with the power of a musical clock, works as another proof.\n\nSo how does \"7th Son...\" manage to keep its head more or less above water? Its main trump card is its opener. \"Moonchild\" has everything that I love in terms of heavy metal, power, drive, and, at least to a certain extent, speed. After its silent intro, a flickering keyboard arranges the transition that leads to robust guitars and after a short warm-up period, the song breaks loose in a fantastic manner. Its eerie bridge connects the verse with the chorus excellently and Dickinson delivers pretty passionate vocals. This song deserves a place on my Maiden mix tape, while other tunes are simply good without achieving the excellent level of \"Moonchild\". The more complex title track, another epic tune of the British legend, reflects that the band is still able to write extraordinary tracks and \"The Evil that Men Do\" scores with both its good flow and the elementary heaviness. Despite its title, the closer has some lively vibes that make the song acceptable. Maiden, no doubt about it, unites great song writers and therefore it is all the more annoying to listen to crappy tunes such as \"Can I Play with Madness\".\n\nThe outstanding artwork, in particular the back cover with the spooky ice titans, cannot compensate for the musical shortcomings and the lyrical concept also remains vapid. This mystical nonsense about clairvoyant powers does not stimulate my imagination. Long story short, this album was and still is not a catastrophe, but a disappointment. I will ask my the first son of my father's only son whether he shares my point of view.\n",
        "\nThis is my most favourite Maiden album between 1982-1988. Unlike another reviewer that suggested that many prefer the most 'classic' Maiden albums because this one is 'simplistic' and 'commercial', I'd have to say the opposite. Seventh Son of a Seventh Son is one of Iron Maiden's most sophisticated and artistic offerings ever. This has TRUE progressive influences and the musicianship is outstanding, not like the new albums that are praised as hell.\n\nWith this album, they come out with the greatest collection of songs since their beginning a decade earlier. This album has a new found emphasis on the guitar work. Murray and Smith bring some of the best guitar work of all time to this album. As always Harris' bass work is excellent, Dickinson's vocals are top-notch, and great drum work from McBrian. Also, this album highlights is the use of keys and synths, and I like their use much more than on the previous album, which is a must buy like this album.\n\nThe album kicks off with \"Moonchild\", my favorite opener along with Aces High. It opens with a great keyboard intro, and moves into a fast paced galloping rhythm. Next comes \"Infinite Dreams\", probably the most well known of the album, and it's a great one. A cool solo intro leads into the song, and the listener finds some killer solos in the middle, as with just about every song on this album. The title track is similar to its predecessors like Ancient Mariner and To Tame a Land. Has a good pace to it, and a lot of lead work.\n\nAnother major praising with this release are the highly catchy choruses, like in \"Can I Play with Madness\". First, everything needs to be doubled up as a big metal chorus just in case people can't pay attention long enough to pick up on it on their own. To further this, the chorus is repeated, not like the disastrous \"The Wicker Man\", but it works fine. It sounds far too clean as well. It's the kind of tactic that artists use to help the 'casual' fans remember lyrics and melody lines more easily. More people being conditioned to remember these songs equals more record sales and concert attendance.\n\nBut this album isn't utterly commercial and is an evidence enough for me to make such a damning praising. Of course Maiden have always flirted with commercialism without betraying their roots and core audience. One advantage that they do possess is that their music has always been accepted by a wide audience. But I want to add that this album is the least known among metalheads, even among the posers, that certainly don't know any song from this album and they go to concerts just to listen to \u201cThe Trooper\u201d and \u201cRun to the Hills\u201d. The same thing happens with Stained Class, it has a poppy song like \"Better By You, Better Than Me\", but even many metalheads don't know that album.\n\nIn closing, Seventh Son of a Seventh Son is a Maiden effort that I favour. Is far better than the previous and this one actually features progressive qualities that don't end with wankery, but actually challenge the mind and its perception of music. Somewhere In Time simply does not possess such qualities, but that album is still good. Hey, it's Iron 'fucking' Maiden. Pretty much all of their stuff is worth hearing if you like Metal, and I know you do.\n",
        "\nWhen someone talks about the greatest heavy metal album of all time, the four albums that are consistently listed as the candidates are Paranoid, Reign In Blood, Master of Puppets and The Number of the Beast. But to me, what makes something the greatest are not the arguments for it, but how well they withstand the arguments against it. Master of Puppets simply influenced metal in too much of the wrong ways, not to mention is more or less a carbon copy of Ride The Lightning; Paranoid had Rat Salad & Planet Caravan; and Reign In Blood just feels underdeveloped, in addition to not having that much influence outside of so-called extreme metal. With The Number of the Beast however, at best the arguments against this are superfluous at best, and retardedly piecemeal at worst. I do hear certain grumblings about Gangland, or specifically how it should have been the B-side to Run To The Hills and Total Eclipse should have made the album. I do agree with this sentiment, but note the album version being discussed, which rectified the problem by having including both tracks near the end. Usually adding extra content to an album hurts it by giving it filler (see also, the remaster of Reign In Blood with the two bonus tracks), but this re-release actually improves the album, making it the definitive metal album. Even if you don't care much for Gangland, you have to admit it's still a proper metal song.\n\nSome arguments might also claim that Iron Maiden would put out better albums than this with better lineups. While I agree with this sentiment, aside from maybe Powerslave, none of those albums reached the level of influence and acclaim that The Number of the Beast did. Not to mention that as amazing as Nicko is, there are still plenty of folks out there who still think Clive Burr was Maiden's best drummer. I don't agree with this, as usually the people who say this are the people who claim that Nicko only uses the ride cymbal to keep time. I counter with not only is that sentiment wrong, but Clive was only able to play in swing rhythms. Regardless, the point of all this was Clive was a fine drummer in his own right. Some of his drumming on this album being the finest moments of his career, such as the drum roll crescendo of Children of the Damned or the absolutely insane double time hi-hat rhythm of Run To The Hills. I get carpal tunnel syndrome just listening to it sometimes. Keep in mind this was a guy that was doing Wrathchild with one hand!\n\nBut this album's secret weapon are the tones. The vicious, bulking tones. This just might be Martin Birch's greatest production job ever. Before Ride The Lightning, Morbid Tales and Reign In Blood shoved a spike through the brains of the world, The Number of the Beast was the heaviest guitar sound on the planet. This and Killers set such a new standard in pain, crunch and tonality that by the time Judas Priest had caught up, thrash had already taken root. But I'm not just talking about guitar tones. Bruce's voice at this time is something truly nightmarish to behold. He was the perfect replacement for Paul Di'Anno because while he had a higher range, he still had that maniacal menace that was able to deliver the power and carnage of previous tunes like Prowler, Killers, Murders In The Rue Morgue and even Wrathchild. Best demonstrated on the brilliant double live outing Beast Over Hammersmith (the only other candidate for a 100% grade, which I would write if I hadn't lost the damn thing). While he was dubbed an Air Raid Siren, I think vampire werewolf would be much more suiting. He delivers these songs and those high notes like a deranged lupus howling at the moon before ripping the throat out of whatever sorry chump happened to be wandering around. Contrary to what some delusional fanboy hipsters will waddle, his voice still very much exquisitely executes the deadly character of Eddie, and would continue to do so throughout his tenure (albeit as time went on, it would be done in a much more different way).\n\nThe laughable tag of New Wave of British Heavy Metal was laid to rest forever with this album. Everything after this point was simply heavy metal, classic metal, traditional metal, power metal, whatever the fuck you want to call it. NWOBHM became the tag Diamond Head, Tygers of Pan Tang and a hoist of others got imprisoned with simply because by 1982, they could no longer deliver the goods. Iron Maiden on the other hand, had manage to take the Jailbreaks, the Risings, The Heaven & Hells, the Sabotages, the Hemispheres and the Stained Classes and synthesize them all into one glorious sound comprised of songs that seemed simple and anthemic, but were quite complex on top. The title track is the best example of this, with its oddball 5/4 time signature intro riff. It also needs to be said that placing the two singles near the end of the album was a ballsy and smart move. The songs on side one of the album are all great in their own right, but there's a reason everyone knows and loves Run To The Hills, Number of the Beast and Hallowed Be Thy Name. Perhaps part of the grief Gangland gets is that it has to follow Run To The Hills and just doesn't have that Hellion quality riff to stop the listener from hitting the rewind/skip back button. Casual listeners do not like to explore albums, they like to repeat the singles over and over again and you better come up with one hell of a melody to keep them from skipping backwards. There's also the fact that most singles, or songs in general, can get old and stale with over play. That does not happen here. I'll never get tired of Run To The Hills, The Prisoner, 22 Acacia Avenue, Total Eclipse, etc., etc.\n\nI hope you've enjoyed reading this brief essay on why The Number of The Beast is the greatest metal album of all time, (and not because you don't actually own the album). It forever stands the test of time of how this genre should always be approached from a songwriting perspective.\n",
        "\nYou're probably wondering why with so many reviews for an all-time classic in metal history that we need to read another one. To answer that, I'll say it is because this album is my favorite release in the entire multitude of metal albums. It has everything you could want in a metal album: speed, aggression, melody, and excellent singing. It is Iron Maiden's greatest album and a landmark in metal history. This album defines Iron Maiden and true 80's metal. Each track on this album is great and holds its own. What is good about this album is that it was released in a time before hair metal destroyed metal, allowing Maiden to have a pure and original sound. Maiden's later albums like Fear of the Dark have a distinct 80's sound with some hair metal elements in them. But this album was released before the treachery of hair metal could work its way into good bands music.\n\nFirst of all, if I was to be buying this album on its release I would be wondering if Bruce is able to fill the role Paul DiAnno previously occupied. Not only does Bruce fill the role, but he does a far more outstanding job on vocals. Not only can he hit the high notes, but he has an amazing set of lungs and can hold those amazing screams for a good while, just listen to the title track and \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\". But Bruce is not just known for the high notes either, he can sing both aggressively and melodically. As far as Maiden's career is concerned, this album feature's Bruce's best singing, and for being his debut, that says a lot. Adrian Smith is now in perfect alignment with Dave Murray and as always Steve Harris is shining. Clive Burr is outstanding as well.\n\n\"The Prisoner\" features a good intro and right after that, it's an excellent drum/guitar intro, before promptly jumping into the fast and rockin' Iron Maiden we're all familiar with. The solo is no exception either. \"22 Acacia Avenue\" continues the Charlotte The Harlot saga, only this song has the opposite attitude, as opposed to its predecessor on the self-titled debut. Yet the song itself is a straight-up heavy metal headbanging tune, with great riffs, some notable pace changes, and two great solo sections in the middle and end. \"Run To The Hills\" is also an instant classic. This could also be considered one of Maiden's most famous. I've heard many punk bands cover this song, and even a few non-metalheads I am friends with enjoy this song. Why? It's so damn catchy! Great lead guitar intro and probably the most memorable chorus ever written by Maiden. This is where Bruce really hits the high notes on the album. Great tune with a great rockin' feel to it.\n\n\"Hallowed Be Thy Name\", although it isn't everybody's favorite metal song, it is considered by many to be Maiden's greatest song. The introduction is dark and gloomy, the distortion kicks in and we have a melodic solo. Great verses, amazing lyrics, excellent riffs, and of course a fast headbanging section with solos that will tear your soul into pieces. The greatest solos Maiden have ever done are on this song, and after them there's still some fast riffing and speedy drumming - perfect headbanging section. That godly opening riff comes back, only in harmony. And the song closes off with Bruce singing the title of the song and holding his voice for a good long while at the end. The perfect epic closing song an album has ever had. I know of no song greater than this song here.\n\nSo what we have here, is what I feel is the finest album that has ever embraced the metal scene. Hallowed Be Thy Name is the most amazing song ever written. Iced Earth tried to cover it, as did Cradle of Filth. Nothing can compare. And likewise with all other bands who have covered the timeless classics on this album, which defines the band's early career and music. There is simply nothing better than this\n",
        "\nIron Maiden continues to kick ass with this excellent follow-up to The Number of the Beast. Everybody does their part well, and I must say that I am not alone in hoping that this band lineup never ever changes, because it doesn't get any better than this right here.\n\nLike any major label band that releases a great many albums, the Iron Maiden formula generally follows the idea that half the songs will be outstanding, and the other half will be okay, only pleasing to the die-hards. This is especially true of Piece of Mind, but the half that rules really rules. \u201cWhere Eagles Dare\u201d is an unmitigated classic, as is \u201cFlight of Icarus\u201d and \u201cDie With Your Boots On\u201d, but the true gem of the album, and one of the top 3 or 4 songs that Maiden ever wrote, would be \u201cThe Trooper\u201d \u2013 What a fantastic song! Even after 34 years, it is as fresh and powerful today as it was when it was written. The video that was released for it is pure classic Maiden, and it remains both one of my favourite metal songs and music videos. (Thought I like \u201cAces High\u201d more on both counts). \u201cTo Tame a Land\u201d is generally popular among Maiden diehards, but also it's a good way to close the album. It reminds me of \u201cThe Nomad\u201d which Maiden would later go on to do in their disc Brave New World.\n\nThe production is good, and typical of the quality found on metal albums in the 80s. The riffs are strong and the beat is always pushing forward. We have come to expect nothing less from Iron Maiden. The guitar work is fantastic coming from Dave and Adrian, the gods of heavy metal guitar playing. Bruce has soaring yet strong vocals that do nothing but add to the greatness of the album. The drumming is solid, and Nicko McBrain is a solid member of the lineup (though I really liked Clive Burr). The remaster punches up the mids and bass nicely, to bring the overall tone more in line with what is considered normal for a metal record, but overall the sound is essentially the same as when it was released.\n\nOne thing I don\u2019t like about this disc is that it hasn\u2019t aged quite as well as some of the other Maiden discs. Maybe I\u2019ve listened to it too much over the years, but \u201cThe Trooper\u201d and \u201cFlight of Icarus\u201d just don\u2019t have that same punch they once did. Probably because I\u2019ve discovered so many bands better than Maiden since then.\n\nStill, Piece of Mind is a damn good album from a damn good heavy metal band, and no matter what anyone says, it\u2019s worth the purchase if you\u2019ve somehow missed it all these years. The remaster is preferable over the original, but either one is great.\n",
        "\nIron Maiden's Somewhere in Time is a revolutionary record that paved the way for numerous power and progressive metal groups for decades to come and extended the horizons of classic heavy metal music. The album convinces with a futuristic atmosphere crafted by creative use of guitar synthesizers. The group gets its listeners into this science-fiction-themed vibe right from the start with the majestic opening sounds of the quasi-title track ''Caught Somewhere in Time'' and keeps the momentum until the slow and epic closure of ''Alexander the Great''. The incredibly detailed cover artwork by Derek Riggs, the timeless and rich production by Martin Birch and the clever lyrics penned in almost equal parts by inspired guitarist Adrian Smith and creative band leader Steve Harris enhance this record's particular mood. Such experimental records are usually discussed controversially and yet Somewhere in Time is often seen as a milestone or even best record in Iron Maiden's extensive career spanning far over four decades. The reason for this is that the band didn't cut its trademark sound but somehow managed to fusion classic and progressive elements in a coherent and focused way. This album is full of powerful bass vibes, extended melodic guitar solos, skilled drum patterns and incredibly emotional vocals. While other Iron Maiden records had a particularly prominent bass sound like The X Factor or a really powerful drum sound as Piece of Mind, this record features five musicians at their creative peaks and in top shape. Music is always a question of personal taste and I can somehow relate even more to the gloomy atmosphere of The X Factor but from an objective point of view, this is probably the band's greatest effort and one of the very best albums in the history of metal metal which will still be remembered in decades and centuries to come.\n\nDespite the overflowing creativity on this album, none of the songs actually sounds complicated or requests multiple spins to grow which proves how balanced this release is and how great the song writing actually works. ''Wasted Years'' is my favorite Iron Maiden single because it features everything an outstanding rock single needs. It features a gripping and melodic main riff, is supported by a tight rhythm section and features dramatic verses that increase the tension towards a liberating chorus you won't ever get out of your head. This perfect brew is garnished with meaningful lyrics that are actually an honest soul striptease and reveal problems that would ultimately contribute to Adrian Smith's departure from the band three years later. As if this weren't enough, we get to witness a wild middle section with a moving guitar solo that puts tears of joy into your eyes if you love guitar music and are an emotionally empathic person. If I had to show a perfect rock or metal single to someone or introduce a person to the sound of Iron Maiden who isn't familiar with heavy metal music in general, this would be my definite choice.\n\nAnother track that stands out is the closing epic ''Alexander the Great''. Some people might be sceptical and wonder whether Iron Maiden can still innovate its epic tracks that have closed the last three albums already. What song could possibly beat ''Rime of the Ancient Mariner'', a masterful tale filled with shifting atmospheres and brilliant musicianship over thirteen and a half incredible minutes? And how does a song about Alexander the Great fit on a mostly science-fiction-themed record anyway? Once you hear this song, all your doubts will shatter into pieces. The song has the classic slow and atmospheric overture before it turns into a powerfully rhythmic affair with an incredible vocal performance and a chorus for the ages. What makes this song stand out are the guitar solo passages in the bridge which are in my opinion the most beautiful sounds guitars have ever made in the history of heavy metal music. Especially the second guitar solo in that middle part is like an orgasm for all your senses. Each time I listen to this part, I can't sit still and my heart beats faster. This isn't just amazing musicianship but emotional empathy on the highest level. \n\nWhile these two tracks stand out in particular, Somewhere in Time only includes good to excellent tracks. The least great track is probably the second single ''Stranger in a Strange Land'' that has a dragging chorus that can't quite convince if compared to the emotionally and instrumentally diversified verses and bridges of the song.\n\nIn the end, Somewhere in Time is an absolutely outstanding metal album that any serious fan of sophisticated rock and metal music should be familiar with and own as a physical copy. Even more than three decades after its initial release, this milestone doesn't sound dated but has aged very well and still transmits an authentic futuristic atmosphere, delivers outstanding musicianship and vocals and convinces with diversified and meaningful lyrics between personal issues, historic summaries and futuristic themes. If you haven't listened to this album yet, go to your next local record store right now and purchase this revolutionary masterpiece.\n",
        "\nJust like \"Virtual XI\", \"No Prayer for the Dying\" belongs to the outsiders of the Maiden discography. And that's no wonder. The album is a collection of ten more or less smooth, almost harmless songs that have ordinary structures and avoid stylistic experiments. A certain lack of creativity cannot be ignored in view of the very typical and slightly outmoded melody lines of songs such as the title track. This does not mean that the output is filled to the brim with songs that suck. Maiden's enormous musical skills avoid shitty albums per se. Yet the degree of excitement does not achieve previously unknown levels. The opposite is true. Already the opener \"Tailgunner\" shows that Maiden were running out of ideas while penning this work.\n\nIts lyrics stand in the tradition of \"Where Eagles Dare\" and \"Aces High\", to say it politely. Differently expressed: we have heard this kind of lyrics before. They deliver another contribution about air raids and bombardments. How thrilling! Honestly, I have never understood this almost romantic scenario of the seemingly boundless freedom of the pilots and their divine power to sentence (innocent) civilians to death from above. Yet in terms of music, the \"Tailgunner\" does not miss his goal. The lively guitars and the catchy chorus characterize this track. It reflects the then new attitude of Iron Maiden. The band has reduced its sound to the essentials, bombastic, nearly overloaded songs do not occur, maybe with the exception of some parts of the final track. Progressive elements are also ostracized. Thus, the quality of the album very much depends on the effectiveness of the guitars. Sometimes it takes just one great riff to produce a good piece of music. But - and that's the other side of the coin - without this riff, everything is lost. \"No Prayer for the Dying\" holds songs of both categories. From my point of view, its hidden champion is called \"Run Silent, Run Deep\". Why? Well, very simple, it houses the best guitar lines. Apart from that, it emanates a gloomy atmosphere - too bad, that many of its comrades fail in this regard. For example, its direct neighbour \"Hooks in You\" remains almost completely expressionless (and its riffing sounds poor). The same applies for faceless tunes such as \"Fates Warning\" or \"The Assassin\".\n\nLean songs are often created in order to give the music an earthy feeling, to bring more or less pompous or overly complex metal back to the unpretentious roots. Good approach, but bands that have this vision should not forget to keep an eye on the production in order to make their idea come true. Five or ten percent filth can be very helpful in this context. But \"No Prayer for the Dying\" is free from dirt. Aggravating this situation, its production totally lacks of individual features. It is neither sterile or clinically clean nor does it possess this little yet necessary amount of filth. In short, this technically proper yet somewhat lukewarm sound matches the pretty flat tunes excellently. Indeed, this is not the highest compliment. But it is true. Just take \"Holy Smoke\". Its winsome flow and the acceptable lines cannot hide that one is listening to a painfully simple number which is actually beneath the dignity of Harris and his band mates. \"Bring Your Daughter...\" was a commercial success, but we all know that this does not mean much. Therefore, I rather recommend to lend an ear to fairly vehement tracks such as \"Public Enema Number One\". Anyway, one will not find many jewels while giving \"No Prayer for the Dying\" a chance.\n",
        "\nMy personal opinion is completely irrelevant. We do not need to discuss this topic. With that said, I start this review with the undeniable statement that \"The Number of the Beast\" was a great, gargantuan and groundbreaking album. Only fools (such as me) do not realize this, but even these guys like some tracks of this milestone. Apart from this, we all know that every excess is followed by a grey morning and how many formations have failed to substantiate their newly gained position? Iron Maiden does not belong to my most favourite bands, but they had the necessary creativity to write a \"milestone after the milestone\". In short, \"Piece of Mind\" is the best Maiden album. You do not share my point of view? Ha, only my opinion is relevant!\n\nAfter this stringent introduction, let's get down to the nitty-gritty. We all know a lot of good albums, pretty decent and anything else but mediocre, yet there is often a small problem. A certain number of individual tracks lacks of a unique identity. This is exactly the point where \"Piece of Mind\" beats thousands of other albums. Yes, there is a pretty weak track on the fourth full-length of the British flagship. \"Quest for Fire\" is its name. The beginning of the song is not very exciting, the melody of the chorus wallows in simplicity and the voice of Bruce sounds slightly tearful, the instrumental part is boring until the strong solos give the tune a better direction. Compared with the other tracks of this album, \"Quest for Fire\" must be branded as a filler. Compared with many songs of other (Maiden) albums, this piece falls under the category \"too bad to be good and too good to be bad\".\n\nHowever, any other track of \"Piece of Mind\" takes, in alignment with its title, possession of a small (or not so small) piece of the listener's mind. The most courageous track is \"Revelations\". At first glance, its exposed position and the partially soft approach are not really compatible with each other. But this pioneering work grows constantly, the outstanding melody lines form a colossus and without an iota of cheesiness, commercialism or half-heartedness, the band delivers nothing less than pure heavy gold (the pretty ordinary term \"metal\" does not do it justice). But don't jump to conclusions, \"Piece of Mind\" cannot be blamed for delivering partly mellow tracks. The guitars of ironclad monuments such as \"Flight of Icarus\" (great, original lyrics with a topic that matches very well the unwritten laws of heavy metal texts) or \"Die with Your Boots On\" leave no doubt that Iron Maiden adopt a clear position. This is the album of a heavy metal band that does not beg for the attention of the mainstream audience. \"The Trooper\" goes in the same direction as the aforementioned pieces, although the guitars deliver, among other things, some almost light leads. Yes, these tracks possess roughly the same degree of vehemence and harshness. Nevertheless, they cannot be confused with each other. Their excellent melodies make the difference. By contrast, the formidable \"Still Life\" is not cut from the same cloth. After an emotional beginning, the song turns out to be a generic metal track which finds the perfect balance between powerful harmonies and profound heaviness.\n\nThe more or less progressive \"To Tame a Land\" sends the final rocket to the stars of the metal universe. Its brilliant instrumental parts keep up the suspense all the way to the end and Dickinson finds the right tones with instinctive certainty. There is a few number of parts where the guitars sound almost fragile, but believe me that this piece is brewed by the metallic purity law. I would even go a step further. This track and the overwhelming opener are the Alpha and the Omega of Maiden's music. On the one hand, we have the gutsy, meticulously constructed, multi-layered system, on the other hand, \"Where Eagles Dare\" sparkles with flattening leads, very vigorous drums and pure power. (It's lyrics are based on an idiotic movie which followed a book of Alistair MacLean, but I have learned to ignore this fact.) Finally, the production. Well, what can I say? Back in the early eighties, albums like this one defined the sound of true heavy metal and, to avoid misunderstandings, I do not speak of the this kind of true heavy metal which is nowadays supported by the \"trve dvdes ov metalt\u00f6wn\". These jesters do nothing but worshipping nonsensical clich\u00e9s while they torture us with their exhausting yet primitive compositions and their moronic attitude. Enough said. Forget the beast, this is number 667. \"Piece of Mind\" is the real milestone.\n",
        "\nIn 1985 Iron Maiden was on top of their game. They completed their World Slavery Tour, which was their longest tour, and they had 5 successful classic metal albums. How do you follow up something like Powerslave? Well, some say that this is the beginning of Maiden's downfall, but do I agree?\n\nLet's get one thing out of the way right now, I really like this album, and it used to be my favorite, until I bought the classic albums prior to this one (The Number Of The Beast, Piece Of Mind and Powerslave). I prefer each and every single one of them above this one. But why? Well, this album isn't bad, as said earlier, but Maiden's music started to change during this time. Somewhere in Time was the first Iron Maiden album to feature guitar synths, you hate them or you love them. Iron Maiden wasn't the only band experimenting with guitar synths during this time, Judas Priest did the same with their Turbo album. But back to the synths, I like them, they build a cool atmosphere (as in Sea Of Madness for example) and they really add to the futuristic theme that the album cover has.\n\nAnother big change this time around, is that guitarist Adrian Smith wrote many of the songs on this album, including the singles Wasted Years and Stranger in a Strange Land. Smith and Harris provide most of the songs on this album, instead of Dickinson / Smith / Harris. Murray has co written one song, D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu. So Dickinson's song material was refused in favour of the songs of Adrian Smith. Each of Smith's songs are catchy and interesting, like Wasted Years. But, what about the songs? Well, the album opens up with the furious Caught Somewhere In Time. The song starts with guitar synths and builds up and up and up until it explodes in a frenzy of riffs as Steve Harris gallops along on his bass. Dickinson's voice is really outstanding, though it sounds a bit forced on the chorus. This song has some epic guitar dueling, and Smith really shines in this track, his solo (the second solo) is one of the best guitar solo's ever, it's a long solo and it's plain amazing. Wasted Years is a upbeat rocker and is without a doubt one of the bands most commercial songs, and it's a pretty good song as well.\n\nThis spoken part opens the final song, Alexander The Great. It is another Harris epic and it's pretty damn epic. This song is about, as to be expected, Alexander The Great. It features long instrumental sections and a bunch of guitar synths here and there. The lyrics are pretty cool containing historical detail as well. This song ends the album with the following lyrics: He died of fever in Babylon. This marks the end of the song, and the entire album.\n\nThis is a pretty solid Maiden record. I really like the melodic sections and the fantastic guitar solos, but I miss some of the power which was found on previous albums. Their next classic would be the follow up to this album, Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son.\n\n(Originally written for www.ultimatemetal.com)\n",
        "\nIron Maiden's ''En Vivo!'' was recorded live in Chile during The Final Frontier World Tour. I remember buying this record at Walmart in a remote town in Northern Quebec without any record store. It was still winter over there and I had gone through a very busy and rough year including difficult classes at the university, a particularly challenging training program, an annoying cold and an unexpected breakup with my girlfriend. This album put some energy, entertainment and warmth back in my life and since I didn't have access to any other good records over there, I listened to this release over and over again for a month or so. That's why I'm grateful for this release and have a strong connection to it.\n\nI hadn't been the biggest fan of ''The Final Frontier'' and actually still think it's Iron Maiden's most lackluster record. Gladly, the live versions of these songs have much more energy. It was a good idea to separate the long introduction from the opening title track which the studio album hadn't done and the opener is much more anthemic, fast and heavy than the tiresome studio version. The longer tracks like ''The Talisman'' and ''When the Wild Wind Blows'' are often half a minute shorter than the studio versions and have a faster pace that works quite well in concert. The enthusiastic crowd adds even further to the adrenaline rush you feel while listening to this album. My suggestion for occasional Iron Maiden fans would be to buy this passionate live release instead of the disappointing studio album.\n\nAside from the new tracks, the set list also features three more songs recorded since the reunion that work very well in concert. I must point out the epic tale ''Dance of Death'' that starts like an epic ballad to become an elegant symphonic rock song that ends in a frenzy with melodies that get more and more dizzy, fast and hypnotizing. This song has a great progression of styles, is enthusiastically welcomed by the crowd and is exemplary for Iron Maiden's epic heavy metal style. The only downside of the more recent tracks on this set list is that the band didn't include one single song from the sinister ''A Matter of Life and Death'' record. Aside of the ''Different World'' single, no official release of the band includes any live recordings of songs from this great album so far. I would have preferred to listen to a vivid version of ''Different World'' than to another cut of ''The Wicker Man'' or to a live rendition of the menacing epic ''Brighter Than a Thousand Suns'' instead of the ballad ''Blood Brothers'' that regularly makes the band's set lists but these are only my personal preferences.\n\nThe concert obviously also features the band's trademark classics including a quite fast cut of ''The Trooper'' and a very participative version of the closing hard rock tune ''Running Free''. All in all, one gets close to two hours of perfect heavy metal entertainment.\n\nConsidering the set list, ''En Vivo!'' might not be on par with other classic live releases like ''Live After Death'' or ''Rock in Rio'' but it's a high quality effort that makes the average studio tracks from the last album much better, that features a very enthusiastic and participative crowd and a passionate band that performs as perfectly as during its peak in the mid-eighties. Both Iron Maiden fans and occasional heavy metal fans should purchase this splendid live release. If you're not epileptic, you can also give the live BluRay or DVD a try that features a few too many split screen techniques and fast cuts in my opinion but which adds some impressive footage of fifty thousand unchained Chilean fans plus a detailed documentary about the band to your experience.\n",
        "\nIt should go without saying that I love Piece of Mind. I also appreciate when bands choose different production sounds as it let\u2019s fresh air into the stuffy room. But coming off the perfect production job of Number of the Beast, the change really felt like a backstep. Coming hot off of one of the greatest guitar tones ever, what\u2019s presented on Piece of Mind isn\u2019t terrible, but it feels a lot less thicker and less crunchy. Especially critical to note is the fact that Maiden was coming into a year where a new generation of metal was breaking through, and just about every band that made its debut had a guitar sound 10 times heavier than this, whether it was well produced or otherwise. See even though the previous year Maiden created [arguably] the best metal album ever, 1982 was still an overall weak year for metal. Restless & Wild makes my top ten for the year whereas in any other circumstance I'd never have Accept as a top ten entry in anything. In 1983 the quantity of quality bands grew drastically, and while none of them would take Maiden\u2019s spot away, they were slicing at their Achilles tendons requiring the band to step up their game.\n\nAnother step back I thought was Bruce Dickinson\u2019s voice. Oh of course it grew in range, but something was lost in ferociousness. On Number of the Beast Bruce sounded like a howling wolf ready to leap out of the vinyl rip your throat out with it\u2019s fangs. Here....well he becomes the swashbuckling hero we all know and love today. Oh he would still kill you, but the mess of entrails made would be much less sloppy and bloody.\n\nNonetheless, for each setback Maiden gained a plus to make up for it. They certainly get an drumming upgrade in the form of Nicko McBrain, whose superior skills become apparent the second the record begins, with the monster known as Where Eagles Dare. There's something I have to say on his behalf, knock off giving Nicko shit over riding the hi-hat so much. All you asshole Paul Di'anno fans who like whine on how Nicko's a one rhythm drummer, you would have a lot more ground to stand on if the drummer you weren't comparing him to was Clive \"Zoot Suit Riot\" Burr. 90% of the time the guy played with a swing-time rhythm. Even on Running Free. Yes he would occasionally pop out of that tempo with moments like Run To The Hills and Genghis Khan, but it felt more often that not that he had to coaxed out of that time. I also don't recall hearing Clive give a single kick drum performance along the lines of Wicker Man or Caught Somewhere In Time or Alexander The Great over the years. Look I loved Clive, he was a great drummer and his passing in 2013 was heartbreaking. But calling him a better drummer than Nicko is like calling a punk guitar player better than Eddie Van Halen. It's laughably dumb. \n\nIn any case, Iron Maiden's songwriting, although inconsistent at times (Quest For Fire) was getting stronger and much more dynamic. The Trooper, overplayed as it may be, is the first riff that pops up in my inner jukebox most days. Flight of Icarus as well. That's practically an alarm clock song to get your ass out of bed, particularly with the lyrics \"as the ground warms to the first rays of light...etc.\" The album overall is a solid cross section between their short songs and their long songs (the first three Maiden albums had one epic number. This one has 3 and they all rule).\n\nWhile still an effort better than most, Piece of Mind just wasn\u2019t as good as the albums that would come before and after it. My least favorite of their glorious 7 album run of the 80s. Still, the high ranking should tell you something.\n\n\nRecommended Songs:\nThe Trooper\nTo Tame A Land\nDie With Your Boots On\n",
        "\nIn spite of what their first seven albums would imply, not even the mighty Iron Maiden are infallible, and actually weathered out the '90s with very little of their musical worth or dignity intact. While Blaze Bayley is rightfully singled out as the worst thing about the Iron Maiden albums of this time period, don't think that the two Bruce Dickinson fronted albums from the earlier half of the decade were much better. Far from it in fact; while I'm not too fond of this band's 2nd Dickinson era albums, it's also pretty obvious to me that a release like No Prayer for the Dying is a far less creative and (quite amazingly) a more musically stagnant and tired-sounding effort. It represents the band quickly losing creative steam and poorly integrating some outside influence to the proceedings as well. This is easily one of the weakest Maiden albums, as well their most annoying.\n\nThe music isn't especially far removed from their '80s albums, but the songs nevertheless lack the larger-than-life quality presented on the 5 albums that came before this one; it was a mood achieved through complex songwriting and intelligent riff construction built around the omnipresent guitar harmonies. This is a considerably more stripped back, rock-infused album, and while this regression alone doesn't make it a write-off the depths the band have plumbed is truly stunning. There is a near-total lack of high quality, memorable and thought out riffs and harmonies, with the guitars mostly playing bland metallic hard rock fodder that lacks any of the energy, atmosphere and intelligence of their older works. It's very run of the mill and forgettable music, okay while it's on but out of one's memory a short while after the album has finished. That's not to say it's all bad though, with competent soloing in spite of the loss of Adrian Smith and Steve Harris' usual bass guitar wizardry, but these plus points alone don't save the album.\n\nTo make matters worse, Bruce Dickinson puts forward one his most irritating vocal performances. While his voice retains its range he too has taken on board some hard rock influence, resulting in a gravelly inflection to his singing. This isn't a problem on its own, but as a result of this he seemingly can't hit a good clean note or put melody into his voice, instead simply shouting over the music with little restraint. The relatively banal music no longer accommodates for any gravitas or passion Bruce might have been able to put into his singing, and the music's lack of intrigue also makes this a more vocally oriented effort, further exacerbating these issues.\n\nHowever, in spite of the mediocrity of the instruments and the bad vocals in front of them the real killer here is the songwriting, which is both a very large step down from before and bad even when this album is viewed in its own microcosm. The songs are largely flat and unengaging; there's very little in the way of intelligence or nuance in the structuring of a lot of these songs. They all have a tendency to repeat themselves a lot and not go anywhere. There is a clear lack of focus and development in the musical ideas used in each track, and despite the relatively short lengths of all of these tracks they tend to meander and ride off one idea like a strong intro (you need look no further than 'Tailgunner' for an example of this.) There's very little depth to the compositions or any sort of atmosphere. Few winners emerge from this album as a result; just about everything is simply too dull and shallow - certainly the title track is a decent half-ballad and 'Mother Russia' lacks Bruce's awful singing but everything else is either textbook rockametal or a song with promise that goes nowhere, aside from the hilariously bad 'Holy Smoke' which sounds like an overly simplified punkish commercial track gone very wrong.\n\nThe repetitious nature of the songs does mean a few hooks are catchy (there's a good reason 'Bring Your Daughter...' is a live staple and it isn't because you want to remember it) but this can be said of any piece of music, memorability derived from good craftsmanship is a far more meaningful indicator of quality. The lyrics on this album are very poor, especially considering the poetry and epic stories Iron Maiden had delivered in the past. The aforementioned pseudo-classic is one case, but the incoherent ramblings of 'Tailgunner' or the mindless tripe of 'Holy Smoke' will serve as equally apt examples of their failure on the lyrical front - in fact only the title track and 'Mother Russia' have decent lyrics. And as a final insult even the production is a step down, with the drums having a dry sound to them and everything else sounding decidedly lifeless and tired. Quite how a band that was a bastion of excellence that redefined metal could crash and burn like this remains something of a mystery. It's a tragic album this; the downfall of a heavy metal legend. Do not seek this out unless you wish to be irritated or saddened.\n",
        "\nPowerslave has been held up as probably Iron Maiden's greatest album and, despite my fondness for Killers and the classic status of The Number of the Beast, I wouldn't dispute that. However, looking back it's strange to notice how much Iron Maiden changed between the preceding Piece of Mind and this album, less than a year and a half later. The character of Piece of Mind was deliberately epic and explorative, with a gentle edge to some of the songs ('Still Life', 'Revelations') that made Iron Maiden seem a little safe and relaxed compared to their earlier incarnation with Paul Di'Anno. But Powerslave is really the opposite of that and tries to be as exciting as possible.\n\nEverything about this album is maxed out, right from the enormous scale of the cover artwork to the attack and flash of the songs to the sheer Maiden-ness that the music exudes. If you listed Maiden's key qualities back in 1984, you would probably have a list something like this: soaring guitar solos, bounding riffs, catchy melodies, powerful vocals singing glorious anthems, foot-stomping drumming, inventive floor-shaking bass work, and - possibly - big ambition. All of that is done to excess here, very rarely leaving time for something other than that checklist, which really is not Iron Maiden's but the quintessential metal template. That's why people feel reticent to argue with this album in terms of quality and style: if you love metal, you should undoubtedly love this album. Maiden push the metal traits to the fore, aiming for greater heaviness than Piece of Mind in the clobbering riffs of 'Flash of the Blade' and 'Powerslave', greater speed than before with the scrambling 'Aces High' and 'Back in the Village', plus nastier lyrics ('2 Minutes to Midnight') and the epic 'Rime of the Ancient Mariner', which is simply more in every sense. The lyrics attempt to be vivid and exciting too, something that I think is best explained by Empyreal in his Powerslave review, where he writes, \"Lyrics are about everything from sword fighting to fighter planes to Ancient Egypt; it\u2019s practically a soundtrack to every boy\u2019s innate dreams and fantasies growing up.\" And really, that's key: this album will always take you back to being young and life being exciting, though with that feeling of Maiden familiarity.\n\nNaturally, it's not just the aesthetic of Powerslave that makes it a great album, the individual components play an important part. Most of the songs are very well written, not showing any compositional cracks, while part for part they include some of the indvidually strongest sections in Maiden's '80s output. Taking 'Rime of the Ancient Mariner' as the most extreme example, the 13 minute song kicks off with a strong mid-paced riff and moves quickly into Dickinson's narrative, then rests in the middle of the song in the fashion of the becalmed seaman. This is clearly the right choice, since unlike many of Maiden's later epics it allows momentum to build at first and the lead section to act as transition from quiet comtemplation to rebuilding energy, taking full advantage of contrast for dramatic effect as well as musical efficiency. Of course, it helps that it has about four awesome riffs and a truly original melody possessed of a distinct nautical feel. That said, 'Flash of the Blade' works on the basis of a much simpler structure, using a main riff, verse, and chorus cycle before really showing off the twin guitar melodies of Smith and Murray, plus the trump card of Harris, whose bass playing can take a section like this to neoclassical levels of instrumental interplay.\n\nThere are a few minor points to clear up about Powerslave that has led to some writing off the album as uneven or containing filler. I agree that Piece of Mind certainly didn't need the rather half-assed 'Quest for Fire' and 'Sun and Steel' among the more intricate compositions, but Powerslavedoesn't have anything so undercooked as to stand out instantly. I would probably give 'The Duellists' the hardest knock for quality, as Dickinson is a little way off in this one and the looooooong lead and melody section in the middle (nearly three minutes by the time the main riff kicks back in) would certainly benefit from tightening up and having a bit of fire under the solos, since it seems to coast through a couple of movements. 'Back in the Village' is a super way to do the same thing, especially as the transitions between guitar leads, bass (semi-)leads, and melodies occur seamlessly, while you can practically hear Running Wild taking notes on how to write speed metal riffs. Finally, I have to address 'Losfer Words' (Big 'Orra)'. I never quite understood Maiden's thing for instrumentals and this one seems like a fairly random choice, since it doesn't do anything drastically different from the rest of the album as 'Transylvania' and 'Genghis Khan' did at least in part. Anyway, this one has a catchy riffset, cool melody, and a great solo around the three minute mark, though I'm slightly puzzled why no one wrote lyrics for it, especially with that drawn out power chord section before the solos. In fact, it would have made a great album closer, kind of like an overture to the whole piece, but whatever, it's still pretty good.\n\nAll this means that my complaints about Powerslave are minor, while my appreciation of its quality and style are high. There are fewer reflective lulls than the preceding Piece of Mind and fewer tedious moments than the overwritten successor Somewhere in Time, although it occasionally falls into similar traps due to excess ambition and a lack of editing in 'The Duellists'. Arguably the greatest lesson for a speed metal band to take, as well as a resource for anyone aiming for epic or stadium levels, Powerslave is very fucking hard to hate. Don't even try.\n",
        "\nIron Maiden had conquered the World by mid-80s. With five outstanding studio albums, a couple of transcendental live releases, one of rock's most cherished and recognizable mascot and some impressive worldwide tours under their belts, they were the band to watch\u2026 and listen to. Not even a couple of important lineup changes deterred them from their ascension to the metal throne, and just as Priest had displaced Sabbath past half the 70s, Iron Maiden did the same with their mentors a decade later. As Defenders of the Faith became Judas last amazing record of the 80s, Iron Maiden weren't exactly through yet, as improbable as releasing something as good as Powerslave seemed. Thing is\u2026 they did. Iron Maiden's 80s discography can be arguably described as impeccable, and in my book few other metal bands managed that level of impact and quality (\u2018tallica and Slayer coming to mind). In fact, not even thrash could overshadow Iron Maiden during the 80s.\n\nSurprisingly, there're still some misguided and occasional cries of ridiculous critique towards the enormity of the album entitled Somewhere in Time. Like the use of synthesized guitars, as if that by itself represented the equivalent of becoming pop and not another tool to expand a band's sound if used properly. Which again, Iron Maiden did. Is not as if the prominence of the guitars was toned done, like Rush did in their own 80s career. Au contraire, the guitar work in Iron Maiden's 6th studio record was probably the most complex and structurally rich they've done so far\u2026 and perhaps still remains so to this very day, roughly 30 years after its release. Which brings us to the use of the p word by some detractors of this record. Yes, \u201cprogressive\u201d. Dangerous stuff in the mind of some metalheads who would be content to listen to the same 4 albums over and over again. Well, if something sat Maiden apart from other NWOBHM acts, was their ability to combine elements from punk, metal and prog, and arrange them into catchy, complex and energetic tunes that became anthems as the years passed by. As the 80s rode on, they tended to lean to the side of prog, that's true, but... they never gave up the intensity. To criticize that evolution is a sign of devolution, my friends. \n\nNow that we've disarmed those sparse cons this masterpiece sometimes conjures, let's remember the good stuff. Opener \u201cCaught Somewhere in Time\u201d remains atop the list of tracks by the Irons which I haven't witnessed live and would kill to do so, and I can assure you it's also number one in similar lists from other Maiden enthusiasts all over the world. The fact they haven't played it enough since probably the Somewhere on Tour should be considered a crime against Mankind. What a track! Nicko McBrain is all over the place with his charismatic fills and accent-heavy approach, producing tenths of different cymbal sounds, a modus operandi he would carry on the rest of the material here. The inaugural synths might have stirred a bit of preoccupation in the hearts and minds of the doubtful ones, but this is classic Maiden at its best. In essence, Powerslave's formula was expanded upon, given a more futuristic aesthetic, while allowing a fluctuation in the creative process. It is well known that Somewhere in Time was Adrian Smith's finest hour, and he delivered in the form of the tremendous anthems \u201cWasted Years\u201d and \u201cStranger in a Strange Land\u201d, both leading singles in '86. I could list all the eight marvelous compositions here, as all eight are fantastic, top-notch metallic 80s splendor, but I'll just mention as well that the intense \u201cD\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu\u201d is another song I would really love to witness being played live by the band. \n\nThere's really not much to add but to stress that this is classic Iron Maiden and there's simply nothing else like it. The band where on fire both on studio and on stage in those years, (pun alert) not wasted at all! You can tell by the cohesion of the compositions, their complexity never being detrimental to their memorability and power. All instruments have equal power; Murray and Smith mighty solos, influential melodies and signature galloping rhythms, with Harris' throbbing bass and Nicko's dynamic, colorful drumming being the steady stallion that leads the charge, Bruce being the dexterous rider on top of it, passionately singing about History, the temptation of Evil, personal struggles, memories and experiences, all taped into eternity by the dexterous mind and hands of Martin Birch, giving it a futuristic edge, and complete with the most ridiculously detailed Derek Riggs album cover ever made, arguably his own masterpiece: a cybernetic, time-traveling Eddie, muscles and circuits entangled, amidst a Blade Runner-esque city guarded by Batman and featuring a familiar lightning-topped pyramid amongst its tourist attractions. This is plainly: AN ALBUM FOR THE AGES. It might not be your favorite (mine is its predecessor) by the Irons, but I'm sure it deservedly could be.\n",
        "\nIron Maiden's The Number of the Beast is one of the most celebrated, well-known, popular, and cherished metal albums of all time. The question is though is it as good as everyone says? To be honest, not it's not. There are far better metal albums that have been released by numerous other bands in various sub-genres and Iron Maiden themselves have surpassed The Number of the Beast on a number of occasions. The problem with this album is it is plagued my many and numerous inconsistencies in the songwriting, and vocal performance.\n\nLet's talk about the positives now (there are a lot) though and why this album is so celebrated and cherished. First, the bass playing by Steve Harris is superb in it's audibility and balance with the other instruments. Without Steve's bass Iron Maiden would not be the same band and Steve's galloping bass lines always stick out and are clearly heard in the mix (he is the main songwriter in the band). He does not play watered down versions of the guitar riffs like many bassists do, he matches the riffs of the guitarists and he often ventures off and inner mixes his own creative bass lines under the guitar riffs to create the truly unique Iron Maiden sound that they are known for. The drumming by Clive Burr is great in it's own right. He often utilizes galloping triplets to the songs to give the songs a \"bouncy\" feel to them. He utilizes this galloping feel to the songs when the songs speed up and when the songs are slower he'll throw in some great fills and a solid steady beat to keep the music going. Clive Burr was the best drummer Iron Maiden had; his drumming style is more creative and is more powerful in delivery than Nicko Mcbrain's. Nicko may be more improvisational but Clive had a more \"driving\" feel to his sound than Nicko.\n\nThe guitars are strong in that the riffs are very catchy and the solos are melodic. There's no atonality in the guitar riffs or sudden/jerky rhythmic shifts in the music mostly utilized by the modern technical death metal/djent scene. Instead they are clear, full of melodies, and are attention-grabbing. For example the riffs in the title track, \"Hallowed Be Thy Name,\" and \"Children of the Damned(the end riff)\" are some of the best riffs Iron Maiden have ever written in their long career. On the great epic track of \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\" (the closing track) the piece raises deep philosophical questions such as Is there an afterlife? Has god Forsaken me? Is life itself just a crazy dream? All held together by a beautiful backdrop of fantastic music. From the riffs, to the bass lines, to the story about a prisoner to be executed, it is just a marvelous song.\n\nNow there are a couple of weak parts that the album suffers from. Before \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\" you have the utterly abysmal song \"Gangland\" and the forgettable \"Total Eclipse.\" One thing that brings this album down are some horrific choruses for example \"Invaders\" has one of the most cringe worthy choruses ever put on record, the mood of the song set up by Harris and the guitarists before hand is ruined and spat upon by the terribly cheesy chorus \"Invaders!\" Whenever I hear that chorus my face cringes and contorts with pain, it is that abysmal. \"The Prisoner\" is another example of a song ruined by a terrible chorus. The mood set by the opening quote from the show the prisoner sets a good mood and the driving riff that kicks in at the beginning keeps it going, the verse comes in, but then the terrible chorus comes in and ruins the mood of the song. It's not as bad as the \"Invaders\" chorus but it is just incredibly cheesy. \"Gangland\" itself is very unmemorable and just a very throw away track. The guitars in this song are very simple, the main riffs is just chords made up of half notes, and dotted half notes (maybe dotted eighth notes). Bruce did a good job singing on this album but a lot of times the lyrical content is very shallow and cheesy, other times it is beautiful and elegant (as demonstrated on the last track). An example of shallow lyrical content is \"22 Acacia Avenue\" which is about prostitution.\n\nOverall a solid album, but Iron Maiden have done better. Albums like Powerslave, Somewhere in Time, and Seventh Son of a Seventh Son all triumph over this album in musical output and lyricism. Even though there are some fantastic songs on this album; some of the tracks are just not good and irritating to listen to. For what The Number of the Beast lacks in consistency it makes up for in its strongest sections. It\u2019s an influential album, and a fun nostalgia trip, but when put up against many of their other albums, in my opinion, it just doesn\u2019t hold up. Songs like Hallowed Be Thy Name, the title track, Run to the Hills, and Children of the Damned will all be remembered as classics for good reason.\n",
        "\nI have not been exactly consistent in my views regarding Iron Maiden, though my reviews for both The Final Frontier and most recent album The Book of Souls should suggest that my tolerance for post-reunion Maiden (it was kind of a reunion, even if they didn't break up) is rather limited. My point of contention for both of those albums was mainly that they lacked great ideas and tried to make up for it by just putting more ideas into songs, resulting in long and aimless music that couldn't capture any sense of excitement or emotion. What about A Matter of Life and Death, you ask?\n\nNot that bad, but not very good either. The problem starts to appear when you do what I'm doing now: playing the last songs first. I find that there are many albums that can pull the wool over your eyes by starting out with the best or quickest or most immediate song, then hiding the weaker songs behind it, almost as if they were seeking protection from their stronger brethren. Remember 'The Wicker Man' on Brave New World? Great song, right? And followed by lumpy, overlong, mid-paced numbers. Dance of Death had two of those quick, strong songs at the beginning, so at least we know there are a few worthwhile numbers there. Here, we've got 'Different World' kicking things off in brisk fashion, leading straight in with a riff and Bruce is singing after 15 seconds, although he does repeat the chorus about 10 times at the end. The tactic becomes apparent when you look forward to The Final Frontier, which stupidly put a horribly long intro at the beginning and exposed the songs for what they are - flabby and directionless.\n\nSo, like I said, I'm playing the last songs first: you know, the last four songs which total 33:35 between them. I would be sceptical if any band ended an album with songs averaging over 8 minutes, because - after all - there's a reason why some people don't like Opeth. In that time, there is probably 20 minutes that I deem extra, in the sense that those moments don't help the song or just aren't very good. Seven and a half of those minutes come from 'The Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg', which shows how clearly the band were thinking, since they released that snoozefest as a single to promote the album. 'For the Greater Good of God' has a really great melody to accompany the refrain (by which I mean not the refrain \"Please tell me now...\" that Bruce sings to death but the title repeated), though that only shows up twice in nine minutes. The instrumental section of that song is one of the highlights of the album, but the loooooooong verse at the beginning just does nothing and does it a lot. Then 'Lord of Light' is not up to much, while 'The Legacy' has some interesting ideas, particularly the kind of creepy build up, although some of the parts seem thrown together quite roughly, as if proudly proclaiming \"We still know how to change direction suddenly\" and \"Can you hear that we didn't have this album mastered?\" (That last part is true...)\n\nTo pan out for a moment from the stricken second half of the album, Maiden didn't do everything badly on A Matter of Life and Death. Partly relying on the same strengths as the preceding release and partly open to the flaws of the successor, there are good ideas and even good songs spread throughout its sprawling length. For most of the musicians, it's a case of there being two sides to their performance. For Steve Harris, he doesn't overdo the bass work and attempt to solo during the guitar solos (he saved that abomination for 'Isle of Avalon') and he provides limber backing during the uptempo moments; however, there is an excess of quiet introductions and interludes that were surely thought out by the bassist since he has a writing credit on every song. I mean, if Harris ever considers putting out a smooth jazz album, I would consider buying it, just as long as he doesn't do it under Iron Maiden's name. It becomes almost comic, since each song seemingly must start and finish with this reflective interlude, like someone on the autistic spectrum who must untie and re-tie their shoelaces before they begin something new.\n\nThough Dave Murray is a bit sleepy, the guitarists are pretty good, chucking in a couple of decent riffs in most of the songs and scoring with solos more often than not. Nicko McBrain does well when there's call for energy, yet can't do a lot for the gentler moments: I can picture him working out a part that he could play with one hand so he could drink with the other. Bruce Dickinson has a good run at things as well, thankfully providing some charisma and drama despite a few preachy phrases, although 'These Colours Don't Run' is a vocal and lyrical turd created mostly so he could wave the Union Jack on a song other than 'The Trooper'.\n\nI'm pretty much done with complaints now, so there's just time to say that the first half of the album is much better than the second, vocals of 'These Colours Don't Run' excepted. 'Brighter than a Thousand Suns' picks up nicely after a slow start and 'The Pilgrim' stands tall as the most consistent song of the album, even if the verse riff is basically 'The Wicker Man' part two. There's a danger that Maiden might have caused some of their fans to get excited, because 'The Longest Day' is an epic that actually kind of works as such, belligerent theme and mood combining stormily together to form one part atmosphere and one part heaviness. When Iron Maiden are good, they're still pretty good, making A Matter of Life and Death a listenable, yet sometimes tedious, album. It's alright I guess. However, we know what comes after...\n",
        "\nWhen I think of Iron Maiden, I think of grand musical endeavors complete with epic themes, soaring instrumentals, fantastic solos and all of that great musicianship and general prowess that's usually associated with these guys. They're heavy metal legends, but their career is not exactly spotless. I'm usually quite open to change, it never really bothers me when a band changes their sound as long as the same amount of ingenuity or passion is applied to what they're doing. A hard rock Maiden would be pretty badass on paper, but if it's executed like this, then I'll pass. This album has never impressed me despite what many fans say about it and it really does compete for the spot as my least favorite Iron Maiden album. \n\nThis album shows Maiden as an absolute shell of a band. The musicianship is bare-bones, the songwriting is quite lacking, Bruce literally sounds bored, and the production is even extremely bland. The epic compositions are replaced by more simplistic, catchier approaches that rely on sing-along chorus', bouncier riffs, and even a bunch of acoustic sections to drive things along. The biggest problem is that it blatantly sounds like they're forcing it. The music almost has the same serious, dark mood as some of the previous Iron Maiden releases but it's executed with these fruity arrangements and as a result - everything sort of clashes. It's trying to be catchy and hooky but it's still trying to be Maiden. \"From Here To Eternity\" in particular grinds my gears with it's outrageous, prancing and totally generic construction; it seriously hits almost every pop rockish cliche you can think of. \n\nReally though, the whole album reeks of extremely weak songwriting and execution. Even on the songs that lack the overt simplicity and lack of creativity, the hole in the band's overall drive is gargantuan. For instance, \"Afraid to Shoot Strangers\" features a mellow (and completely ridiculous) intro that lacks any sliver of the dark, somber tone that it goes for. Then the band just tries to give 'er the 'ol \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\" and haphazardly jump into overdrive without any successful buildup. It's like a song that exists only as a blueprint for other, better Iron Maiden songs. The band fails on the catchy side and the epic side of things, they just utterly fail here. I think the cover art does a fine job of summing things up, Eddie is no longer the badass mascot he used to be, he's just stuck to a fucking tree. \n\nIn addition to the awkward usage of all of these more commercially inclined elements, which wouldn't be inherently bad if not for how weirdly they're pulled off, the musicianship is just weak. The riffs are all just totally lacking power and the band sounds bored. Steve's melodic bass lines sound thrown in, Bruce's voice isn't too bad but he is without any ounce of essence, and everything just sounds as if Maiden wanted to throw in the towel but did an album anyway. It doesn't stop at just the writing and musicianship though, you've got yourself the ridiculous lyrics as well. I won't get into them, but the lyrics are almost as offensive as the boring music present here. \n\nThis album is Iron Maiden almost completely bankrupt; they lost their musical, lyrical, and conceptual edge on this album big time. I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy \"Be Quick or Be Dead\", \"The Apparition\", and that overrated title track, but they are simply decent songs in the midst of a rather barren harvest. It may be an unpopular opinion, but I do consider this to be one of Maiden's absolute weakest records. They didn't have the same creativity and drive behind this at all and again, a hard rock Maiden might not have been too bad, but here the experiment crashes and burns. I'm just happy that the pathetic butchering of my favorite Budgie song didn't make it onto the album.\n",
        "\nWhen being a band like Iron Maiden, there must always be a high pressure from fans to outdo themselves over and over. Being a fan of Iron Maiden, however, is probably easier as we are ultimately the judges of the band's music, and thus we also know that Maiden is one of those bands who tend to do great records, but there's almost always a stigmatic track on most of their albums. For instance, we have \"Invaders\" on The Number Of The Beast or \"Quest For Fire\" on Peace Of Mind. Without a doubt, \"Can I Play With Madness?\" was the one for their Seventh Son Of Seventh Son album.\n\nThe song starts off with a shout of the song title by Bruce in his rather \"chubby\" sounding vocal trait, you know the one his voice developed into more and more over the course of his aging, and which is highly present on Maiden's newer albums. I tend to hate when he sounds like that, as it does sound rather unattractive. After this, the song launches into a flat sound of guitars, drums and Steve's trademark gallop-bass. The music itself is also surprisingly \"soft\" compared to their other material, even from the same album, and doesn't really feel like a good representation of what their then-new album was about. I would even dare say that this song treads into a Blue \u00d6yster Cult kind of sound. It also sounds like a very happy song, something which is also quite out-of-character for Maiden. \n\nAs a whole, the song is more-or-less disastrous and out-of-place not only on its album, but pretty much in the band's catalogue overall. The B-side \"Black Bart Blues\" is also nothing of great interest musically, and it's probably the least good B-side from these album sessions. However, it does feature some dialogue at its end where the band, not too seriously and in typical Nicko McBrain-fashion, are just being silly. At least this could be of some fun value. All-in-all though, this single is a most cringe-worthy choice (and induction on the album) for a lead single. While it did indeed bring out a new side of the band, it was a side better left behind closed doors, and so far any other songs from the band in the same vein of this have stayed there as well.\n\nUnless you're a real die-hard collector of Iron Maiden, or really love and want the single's artwork on your wall, you should avoid this one and just stick to the full length album, where you'll get to suffer enough every time this song comes on.\n",
        "\nIron Maiden's debut is one of the most infamous in metal history, and it's legacy cannot be denied. Overall, the 8 (or 9 if you add Sanctuary) tracks represent a band in their early stages, still searching for their true sound. Although the album contains its flaws, it still holds up in Iron Maiden's catalog. \n\nThe production for this album is one of the most significant flaws. However, the raw sound the tracks have do add to the classic feeling one receives when playing the album. On the other hand, once producer Martin Birch enters the scene later on, the sound improves vastly. The artwork is the 1st of numerous albums to be covered by Derek Riggs, and he delivers. With a grueling, yet detailed image of the bands mascot Eddie. The art does its job at standing out on store shelves. The performances on this album are fair, even if they don't equal those of later albums. Steve and Dave do a great job in their positions, and Paul seems to be putting in his all. However, Dennis Stratton seems lost in the mix and Clive hasn't seemed to have truly found his sound just yet. \n\nWhen it comes to the track listing for this album, a major standout is epic \"Phantom Of The Opera\", which many consider to be Maiden's first true epic and a foreshadowing of what they would become. With incredible changes in tempo that leaves the listener guessing and amazing solos, it is a classic in their catalog. Other great tracks include the beautiful power ballad \"Remember Tomorrow\" and the instrumental \"Transylvania.\" However, some songs don't seem to have as much work put into them as others. This includes \"Running Free\", which seems a bit too simplistic lyrically, even with it's catchy bass and drum line, the title track, which repeats the same verse 3 times, and the added track \"Sanctuary\", which is a bit simplistic as well. However, even if they lack a bit variety, the songs still remain somewhat powerful. Other good moments are other ballad \"Strange World\" (featuring an incredible vocal performance by Paul), opener \"Prowler\" and \"Charlotte The Harlot\". \n\nOverall, Iron Maiden's debut record features a classic sound that remains strong to this day.\n",
        "\nAfter the Beast On The Road tour, Iron Maiden and Clive Burr parted ways, and he was soon replaced with Nicko Mcbrain. Now, the band had to follow up their most successful album, so they hit the studio and began to record Piece Of Mind. When the album was released, it went 3rd in the UK charts and was globally praised once again, and not long after Iron Maiden embarked on the World Piece Tour. \n\nThe production on this album may be Iron Maiden's best to date. The band sounds tight and clean, and Martin Birch did a phenomenal job.. Performances wise, Nicko really shines on his debut, with the drums as featured as they've ever been. Meanwhile, Bruce gives some of his most passionate vocals to date. Meanwhile, Steve, Dave and Adrian give great performances on the bass and guitars. Overall, nobody really seems to be particularly lacking. The art was done by Derek Riggs as usual, and though it is more simple that previous works, it still gives a jolting image to anybody who sees it. \n\nThis album is Iron Maiden's first album that really exemplifies the sound they've became known for to this day. Iron Maiden and Killers had a bit of punk and blues influence to them, while Number Of The Beast was a period of transition. Here, the band has fully transitioned away from these influences and are playing more heavy songs. While there are no particular standouts here, nearly every song has awesome moments, and in that is where its beauty lies. Opener \"Where Eagles Dare\" features incredible drum fills, while \"Flight Of Icarus\" features amazing vocals. And it is impossible to forget the main riff in \"The Trooper\", or maybe the soft guitar intro of \"Still Life\". On a different note, there are a few songs that do lack. While the song \"Sun And Steel\" has a catchy chorus, it is a bit lost in the overall sound, however even it isn't really bad. However, \"Quest For Fire\" seems to fail the most here. The riffs sound somewhat recycled from other tracks here, and the lyrics aren't up to snuff. \n\nWhen looking at this album as a whole, from the amazing opener to the incredible close \"To Tame A Land\", this album seems to be very strong and consistent. Even though most of the songs don't seem to be featured by the band as much, the overall album is one of Iron Maiden's strongest.\n",
        "\nIron Maiden had already collapsed musically with the advent of the '90s, and the hiring of Blaze Bayley was the final nail in the coffin for the group. Any positives here are merely decayed remains of a better time. The band got lost in a haze here, and the end result is undoubtedly the worst album in their discography.\n\nOne issue is the tonal shift that has occured on this album, where the band has moved back to a lighter and more traditional sound from the darkened The X Factor, which is bad because that means that Blaze's already bad voice is even more out of place as he has to fill the shoes of the wailing, soaring Bruce Dickinson - and he fails miserably at that because that isn't what Blaze does. It isn't just that his voice isn't cut out for NWOBHM though, he sounds completely awful regardless. He has very little in the way of a vocal range; you can hear his pipes betray him every time he goes for a higher note that Bruce could easily have pulled off, even around this time. Even worse though is that he can barely carry a tune and that all of the vocal lines on the album sound awkward and... bad, for a lack of a better word. The vocal 'melodies' are memorable purely in their terribleness, not because they sound like the work of someone who can sing.\n\nEven so, the principle problem here is that the material, as well as being unfitting of the vocals, is so lacking in inspiration and quality that you'd think this was a local Iron Maiden cover band at work. As mentioned earlier the best part of this album are merely mediocre, also-ran retreads of past greatness - see the opener and sole highlight 'Futureal' for proof of that. Otherwise mediocre songs are saved a bit by the presence of solid leadwork, but on the whole the shorter songs on the album don't have much to offer, and any sort of redeeming value is ruined by the vocal performance.\n\nHowever, it gets worse with the shitty, overlong and dragging 'epic' 'The Angel and the Gambler'. With its tepid rock riffing and its bloated 9 minute run time it is the nadir of the album. Every long song on here, even the somewhat complex, atmospheric and interesting 'The Clansman', go on for twice as long as they need to and feel 4 times as long as they actually are. And then Blaze tries to expand a bit by going all expressive on us with 'Como Estais Amigos'... seriously, this whole album is an unmitigated failure.\n\nEven the production is poor, lacking any sort of vibrancy or life and rendering the stale material and crappy vocals dead on arrival. How did something like this get released? Especially for a band like Iron Maiden on a big label like EMI, this is a poor quality, badly presented and extremely slapdash product. The only one that was focusing at all during its making was the cover's artist; because it is badass.\n\nSo, Virtual XI. A mix of unoriginality, bad ideas, poor execution and downright laziness. Their worst album? Oh hell yes, by many country miles.\n",
        "\n'Piece of Mind' is one of the Iron Maiden albums that I've never completely \"got\", not because I don't understand how or why they wrote songs like this, but more because there are a couple of songs that are instantly recognisable to most metal fans and a few that remain obscure, sometimes for good reason. To make it plain, I mean that everyone knows 'The Trooper' (and can probably hum the whole song without much trouble) and it's likely that you'll have encountered 'Flight of Icarus', as well as 'Die With Your Boots On' or 'Where Eagles Dare', while the two shorter songs towards the end and even 'Still Life' have been neglected almost since they were put to tape. This happens to many bands with a multitude of albums, as Maiden now do, yet it is rather conspicuous that 'Piece of Mind' was only the fourth Maiden release and seems not to have the band's full concentration.\n\nReleased just a year after 'The Number of the Beast', this album cemented Maiden's position as the leading band in the NWOBHM, really solidifying the group's signature sound of active, agile bass riffing, soaring guitar leads, and dramatic vocals. Setting aside much of the aggression and snarling pace of their earlier work, Maiden continued to develop in a more expansive direction, as evidenced by the extended instrumental section of 'To Tame a Land' and the broader horizons of the opening pair of 6 minute songs. The riffs here are generally less hard-edged and brutally to the point as those from 'Killers', suggesting that the Londoners had spent some time listening to Judas Priest's 'Screaming for Vengeance', which also chills the metal down to a more temperate groove, though with some additional hard rock feelers that Maiden never included. Also, in a song like 'Revelations' or 'Still Life', there is a great deal of texturing and softer touches, with frequent drops into acoustic verses in the former and the long mellow introduction of the latter.\n\nDeciding whether these changes were for the better is a little like deciding whether you'd like to have two children or an amazing dog, since for sheer content and fulfilment you would prefer the more complicated task of raising the children, though the dog would probably be more fun and less trouble, even if it doesn't have the longevity of a person. You might have guessed that the amazing dog is 'Killers', especially in the way it bounds forward at high speed and just seems so much more free than this, while the more \"mature\", slightly progressive, Maiden is likely what has meant their 80s work has endured as interesting and challenging for more than 30 years. On the one hand, it's great to get caught up in the intriguing twists of 'Still Life''s story or the mazy, intricate leads of 'To Tame a Land', but there's also a fantastic appeal to the way that 'The Trooper' shoots out of the gate with that awesome riff and doesn't let up for its duration. I suppose the balance can be seen in 'Where Eagles Dare', which is the song with everything, including the more straightforward riffs and a slightly higher pace, plus several minutes in the middle that work out knottier musical ideas without becoming dull.\n\nTo some extent, your opinion on this album can be judged from your answer to this question: are 'Quest for Fire' and 'Sun and Steel' filler songs? If they are, then it's a definite lazy point, especially since the album would have been more or less complete without them. I would say that 'Sun and Steel' is certainly unnecessary, having nothing in the way of riffs or memorable moments in the first half (the chorus is particularly plain, being driven along by power chords) and picking up a bit for the solo, which however copies a very specific idea - the dizzying whammy-bar nosedive towards the end - directly from 'Still Life', which itself nabbed it from 'Total Eclipse', the B-side from the 'Run to the Hills' single. Then there's the problem with 'Quest for Fire' and its fucking annoying lyrics and vocal pattern, spoiling half-decent instrumental parts, especially the main riff. That said, the lead section is pretty pants for 80s Maiden. So - to sum up - yes, they are filler.\n\nI suppose I should pull up something complementary about the album now, but I have one more negative first, which has been commented on previously, so I'll make it snappy. There are lots of mid-paced songs or parts of songs (verses are the worst culprit) that make use of palm-muting to create classically chugging and trotting rhythms, plus more than a few simple power chord bridges. The \"trotting\" parts are my take on the traditional \"galloping\" Maiden rhythm losing some steam, because they not only lose pace but momentum and excitement, making the songs less intense than the earlier work and resulting in the highlighting of the only really fast song, 'The Trooper'. The power chord parts are just whatever - uncreative and blah.\n\nTo address these issues, we helpfully have Steve Harris in a very prominent position during the album, noodling and gurgling away like a contented infant and putting in a bit more work at mid-pace than either of the guitarists. That somewhat helps the situation, as does Bruce Dickinson, who manages to inject enough drama and power into thankfully interesting lyrics, so that one may overlook the simplicity of the verses of 'Flight of Icarus' and concentrate instead on the unfolding story or the neat solos or the shrieking ending. Drums lack a bit of aggression, tending to stay fairly quiet, which could certainly have been imrproved.\n\nTherefore, 'Piece of Mind' is a pleasant album to listen to and easier to get into than some of the more aggressive early 80s and more progressive late 80s output, but ends up bowing to both ends of the spectrum, with few exceptional songs and a couple of naff ones. Still not bad by any means, just a little too comfortable.\n",
        "\nAfter the Killers world tour, tensions were high between Paul and the rest of the band. This is mostly due to Paul's drug abuse. This led to his firing soon after. Now, the band needed a new singer, which would be tough, especially considering many fans now were use to the sound of Paul's voice. However, Bruce Dickinson, formerly of Samson, filled these shoes marvelously, and the band prepared to write a new album. For the first time in Iron Maiden's career, they would have to write nearly the entire album from scratch, as the previous two albums had songs that were written long before their recording. Fortunately, Adrian stepped up to the plate, having 3 song credits on the album. This represents the beginning of a change in writing for Maiden, as the rest of the band step up more and write, or at least co write, many tracks. When the album sold, it hit #1 in the UK, and was successful worldwide, even with controversy surrounding its themes. \n\nMartin Birch once again delivers powerful production on this record, though it may not sound as clean as Killers. Overall , the album seems to have more of a grim tone to it, and seems as even more of a departure from Iron Maiden's earlier work. Derek Riggs does another powerful artwork, with Eddie looming over Satan himself. The performances on this album were strong, and a representation of the musicianship that would come later in their career. Bruce's new vocals add a whole new sound to the music, and he sounds powerful and strong. Steve holds up well, though he may not stand out as much on this record. Meanwhile the guitarists Dave Murray and Adrian Smith play some incredible guitar licks. The only suffering performance comes from Clive, who seems to be lacking a bit on this record. \n\nAs stated earlier, this album is a turning point for Iron Maiden. The songs are heavier, and seem to have much less punk influence as Killers Or Iron Maiden. This works in benefit of the band as this is their most successful album yet, and remains to many as one of the strongest metal albums of all time. When many think about Number Of The Beast, they are most often reminded of the title track and hit single \"Run To The Hills\", which both produce strong solos and catchy choruses. However, there are many other standouts on this record. Including \"The Prisoner\", with the infamous intro, \"Children Of The Damned\", with its beautiful vocals, powerful lyrics, and incredible solos, \"Catchy and upbeat \"Invaders\" and \"22 Acacia Avenue\", which revisits Charlotte The Harlot. Perhaps the best song on this album, and one of Iron Maiden's best to date, is \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\", which is an incredible epic that sets the scale for many to come. With a grim intro, incredible solos and some of the best vocals ever by Bruce, it earns a spot as one of heavy metal's strongest songs. The only mishap here seems to be the track \"Gangland\", which seems a bit bland, as it doesn't seem to have nearly as much work or passion behind it. Past that, the album is near flawless. \n\nTo this day, many consider Number Of The Beast one of the strongest metal albums of all time, and it lives up to the hype.\n",
        "\nWhen it comes to selecting singles, Maiden usually tend to not choose the betters tracks from their upcoming albums. \u201cBe Quick or Be Dead\u201d was the first single off \u2018Fear of the Dark\u2019 and was a straight on blitzkrieg attack. It was furious and aggressive with Bruce\u2019s signature banshee scream signaling a war was a foot. While Maiden\u2019s first full on monster ballad \u201cWasting Love\u201d was to come later as the third single, it would have been a smarter decision to make \u201cAfraid to Shoot Strangers\u201d or the title track the second single; considering they have now become revered among Maiden's fan base. But that lucky second single spot was reserved for the second track on the album, \u201cFrom Here to Eternity\u201d.\n\nWhen I first heard the song I couldn\u2019t stand it. In comparison to other Maiden classics, I thought it was boring and too poppy for my tastes as a disgruntled youth. Though as time has passed, whenever I hear that light guitar and bass combo intro, I can\u2019t help but smile and start rocking out in my head. \n\nThis Steve Harris classic, is a straight forward banger of a sing-along. While you can sing along to any of the songs on 'Fear of the Dark' with ease, the chorus on \u201cFrom Here to Eternity\u201d is absolutely infectious. The guitar solos are two of the gnarliest and memorable compared to other Maiden solos and that\u2019s not said lightly. The song itself sounds like it was created in the early 90s. Taking more of straight up rock approach, the song sounds a lot brighter sounding than the band's 80s efforts and sounds like the type of song you would hear on jukebox at a biker bar. The chorus features gang vocals similar to what dying hair bands of the period were doing, but even with that in my mind, the obvious Maiden qualities are still there. For such a poppy song, Bruce\u2019s vocals are super aggressive and while he wasn\u2019t as youthful or high pitched as he used to be, he was still able to deliver clean raspy vocals like no other.\n\nThe single came out in several different formats; one being a 7 inch Baphomet shaped picture disc, taken from the Baphomet statue appearing in the \u201cFrom Here to Eternity\u201d music video. Exclusive to this version is a cover of Budgie\u2019s \u201cI Can\u2019t See My Feelings\u201d originally on the Welsh band's \u2018Bandolier\u2019 record. On the packaging and the vinyl itself it is spelled \u201cI Can\u2019t See My Feeling\u201d, which may have been a joke or an honest typo. The song fits perfectly with this era of Maiden and the perfect b-side for \"From Here to Eternity\". Honestly speaking, it is better than a lot of the songs on \u2018Fear of the Dark\u2019. While shortened by two minutes, with the second half of the song completely rearranged, Maiden\u2019s version is heavier, faster paced and more energetic than Budgie\u2019s version. Depending on which band you enjoy more, you\u2019ll probably find that version more fulfilling. \n\n\u201cFrom Here to Eternity\u201d is probably not the first song you think of when you think of the 'Fear of the Dark' album. Even so, it is a mighty track that will be in your head for days after. It is a well crafted song with a pop mentality and a sneering metal finesse that is hard to replicate.\n",
        "\n\u201cNumber of the Beast\u201d is one of the most iconic songs in the world of heavy metal. For many a young metal head, it is one of the first heavy metal songs they have probably heard when becoming introduced to Maiden or the genre. I\u2019ve never been huge on the song. Whenever the song played on the full length or my Edward the Great compilation, I found myself hopping to the next song as soon as possible. But when on its own, \u201cNumber of the Beast\u201d is a monster of a song.\n\nThe song has all the important key ingredients that make a timeless rock and roll classic. The eerie narration at the start sets a damning mood. The actual instrument starts off in flames with the timeless guitar riff we are too familiar with. Catchy lyrics from the get go, hooks throughout, a blasphemous chanty chorus and two of the most recognizable solos of any rock or metal song. There isn\u2019t much more you can ask for. \n\nThe original single features a live recording of \u201cRemember Tomorrow\u201d with Bruce at the helm. I have the fortunate pleasure of owning the 2005 re-release. This version doesn\u2019t include the live rendition of the Paul Di\u2019Anno fronted classic, but instead, two recent live recordings. Recorded in 2002 at Brixton Academy in London, live versions of \u201cNumber of the Beast\u201d and \u201cHallowed Be Thy Name\u201d are the spiritual B-sides of this single. Both songs have been recorded numerous times over the years, so their inclusion on this release and not the original live track is perplexing. The songs were recorded at the Clive Burr MS fund raising event. A noble cause, but even so, better live recordings of these songs can be found elsewhere. \u201cHallowed Be Thy Name\u201d is performed and mixed better out of the two. The snare drum in the live rendition of \u201cNumber of the Beast\u201d is overbearing, taking away from what the other members are doing. \n\nOverall, it's great to see the juxtaposition between the studio and live recording. It\u2019s a feel good moment hearing the fans sing along to all the words, showcasing the legacy the song has left twenty years later from when it was originally released in 1982. \u201cNumber of the Beast\u201d will go down as Iron Maiden\u2019s trademark song. Undoubtedly, future metal heads will be chanting \u201c666! The Number of the Beast!\u201d for decades to come.\n",
        "\nI got into my local record store on RSD, and I saw this, much better looking than I had originally thought. The Eddy picture is about as good as it gets, with the B-side having the two tracks labeled and all the copyright information. The inside sleeve features pieces of newspapers from reports on the wreck of the R101, with some little things airbrushed to feel more special (\"R101 Caught in Air Eddy\"), and pictures of the ship after the crash.\n\nThe front of the gatefold features a cutout made to look like the paper was torn open, with the A-side visible in the sleeve. The A-side is of course Empire of the Clouds, with the printing representing the \"Air Eddy\" mentioned earlier. The back of the gatefold has another picture of the crashed airship, along with the tracklist and a sticker telling you which number copy you own (mine, in case anyone is wondering, is 3965/6000).\n\nNow, for the music itself. The whole thing, at least my pressing, is off in pitch a little bit from 33 1/3, maybe a few seconds longer on the whole. It's really apparent when compared to the digital version of the song, especially with the opening piano. If you are reading this review, I suspect you already know/like the song enough to look at the review for this version of it. Therefore, I'm not going to got into detail about the song too much. It begins with about 2 minutes of Bruce's piano playing, adds vocals, and then continues on as a normal Maiden track would. Being 18 minutes long, there is the opportunity for lots of changes in the composition, which do happen. The song is meant to follow the R101 from her unveiling, up to flying into the storm, and of course the frenzy and panic of the crew to make sure it doesn't crash. It did though, and the song ends with a sort of eulogy for the airship, the epilogue to the epic nature of it, and a bit of a reprise of the beginning for instrumentation.\n\nThe B-side features an interview just a couple minutes longer than the song itself explaining how it was made by Bruce and Nicko, titled Maiden Voyage. Bruce explains the majority of it, how he came up with the concept all the way to it being their longest song yet. They explain how the sound effects were made and guide you through the the different movements, telling you how to tell them apart.\n\nAll in all, this was a really good release from RSD, the only gripes I may have are with the incorrect pitch and the lack of exclusivity feeling -- the limited edition number is on a sticker. No matter what, if you are able to find a copy for a decent price, and you really enjoy the song, you should definitely buy it\n",
        "\nThis is one of my favorite albums, enjoyable from start to finish. Iron Maiden\u2019s power metal and progressive rock influences are clearly noticeable on this release, a trait already heard on Somewhere in Time, in which they included the use of keyboard and synthesizer arrangements. Seventh Son of a Seventh Son was the final confirmation of this change of style: the keyboard melodies and exquisite arrangements of synth bass and guitars are mixed in a balanced and consistent way, making 8 excellent pieces clearly influenced by the progressive rock of the 70s. Just after listening to the first track \u201cMoonchild\u201d we get an idea of how different and special this LP is. There aren't fillers, not even \"Can I Play with Madness\", the weakest track here.\n\n\"Moonchild\" starts with a memorable kaleidoscope of keyboards that make you go into a trance, while the solo blows your brains out. And of course, the anthem par excellence, \"The Evil that Men Do\" is a revolution in metal and has one of the most memorable guitar solos in the album. \"Infinite Dreams\" is another of the highlights of the album, making you drop your jaw with those 2000 rhythmic changes. The title track is the most ambitious composition, and it\u2019s also special because it helps you understand the other 7 songs, like a summary of the conceptual story behind the album. It has a very good intro that isn't ordinary. Three distinct sections compose it, the first one has mostly Bruce singing about the title character, while the second section is a calm interlude and the final section is an awesome instrumental that concludes with explosive guitar soloing by both Murray and Smith.\n\nI believe this is one of the best albums in the history of Iron Maiden\u2019s career. It is a disc that cannot be missing from your collection. Even when some claim that The Number of the Beast is their best and that album certainly contains great hymns, all songs from this record work perfectly together making a perfect symphony of metal. Nonetheless, many of Maiden\u2019s classic fans hate this record because it was a 180\u00ba change in the group's sound, so over the years it has gained some stupid bad reputation. But reality is that Seventh Son of a Seventh Son is truly an absolute classic of Maiden\u2019s discography. After this, an inevitable decline started for Maiden, first with Smith\u2019s flight after the tour ended, and a few years Dickinson\u2019s goodbye, which gave way to an epoch of publication of mediocre or misunderstood works that ended with the band\u2019s current and successful meeting.\n",
        "\nLet's put the conclusion first: some will never come to like latter-day, \"newer\" Iron Maiden, and that's perfectly understandable. (What's less understandable is giving an album a rating in the zero-percent range, which should be reserved for utter crap devoid of any musical or instrumental skills, just because you're still butthurt over a band slightly altering their sound; that's another story though.) For those who like post-reunion Iron Maiden, however, The Book of Souls rivals the equally good A Matter of Life and Death as Maiden's best release in the new millennium. Some have gone as far as calling it the band's best outing since Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, but naturally that sort of judgment must first pass the test of time.\n\nLet's leave such musings aside and discuss the album artwork instead. Apparently it's inspired by Mayan art and myth and while the front cover may be a tad too simplistic, it gets the job done and is easily the band's most decent front cover since at least Brave New World. It also helps that the band's original logo is brought back and that the booklet contains some more pretty cool drawings. As for the sound quality, The Book of Souls sports a better production than, for instance, The Final Frontier or Dance of Death. It's still far from perfect, but it's good enough not to get annoying after a while. Especially the guitars have that classic \"warm\" Stratocaster sound that was also present on many of the band's vaunted releases from the 1980s.\n\nAlas, on to the actual music. The first thing that jumps out is of course the overwhelming duration both of the album as a whole and of most of the songs. Two CDs, 92 minutes of music, three tracks surpassing ten minutes in length \u2013 wow, just wow. As both CDs are long enough to be considered full-length albums, a case could be made that this is actually The Book of Souls parts one and two, which just so happened to be released at the same time.\n\nKeeping that in mind, let's delve right into the musical content of this Book of Souls, the centerpiece or culmination of which is of course the overlong \"Empire of the Clouds\". It's a somewhat atypical composition for Maiden, featuring some highly emotional piano sounds as well as a rather unconventional song structure. At 18 minutes long, it certainly passes as the band's most daring song to date, a bold and epic \u2013 an overused word that still fits perfectly here \u2013 attempt at cinematic storytelling that ends up a complete success. Listening to this track, you can almost see the tragic events unfolding before your very eyes. It's quite an accomplishment to write an 18-minute long track that, despite its length and complexity, is gripping and entertaining from beginning to end, and Bruce, who gets sole songwriting credits for this one, pulls it off perfectly. It also helps that his vocals sound amazing (as they do on most of the album) and that the entire band seems vibrant and energetic, another aspect that makes The Book of Souls fresh and exciting. Another atypical track is \"Tears of a Clown\". It's rather direct and to the point and therefore slightly reminiscent of the material on the much maligned No Prayer for the Dying. It works very well though, thanks to some great riffs and hooks and a contagious chorus. But it's really the long tracks that are Maiden's strong suit nowadays, and with \"The Red and the Black\" and the title track, The Books of Souls has two more fine examples in stock. The title track speeds up toward the end, which is a nice touch, and both are simply excellent songs with many diverse parts, good riffing, extensive fluent soloing and epic choruses.\n\n\"Death or Glory\", on the other hand, is a relatively concise track, a strong and heavy cut much in the vein of older songs with lyrics on aerial combat, like \"Aces High\" or \"Tailgunner\". It would be even better if it were just a little faster, but it's still among the best songs on The Book of Souls. Unfortunately, other \"short\" (a very relative term in the Maiden context) tracks such as \"Shadows of the Valley\" and \"The Man of Sorrows\" are among the weaker moments on either CD: the former a rather typical by-the-numbers example of postmillennial Iron Maiden, the latter a semi-ballad that gets a bit dull about halfway through and seems like a less urgent rehash of \"The Man Who Would Be King\". Neither is particularly bad, but decidedly mediocre and if you'd want to skip any songs it would probably be those two. Luckily, \"The Great Unknown\" or \"When the River Runs Deep\" show up better, with the former boasting an instantly recognizable chorus and fabulous harmonized guitar work that no other band can pull off quite like Maiden. \"When the River Runs Deep\" has an upbeat feel to it, featuring fast and aggressive verses interrupted by a slower and, to be honest, rather unimaginative chorus. Even \"Speed of Light\", which was released as a single before the album came out, works well within the context of the other tracks. It's nothing fancy, but still a good, quick, heavy-rocking tune that clearly shows Adrian Smith's hand both as a songwriter and skillful guitarist. Oh, and let's not forget to mention \"When Eternity Should Fail\", which is Maiden's best album opener in many years and would have fit nicely on any of Bruce's solo albums. (Bruce reportedly wrote it for that purpose but decided to use it for Maiden instead).\n\nSo, to make a long story short, The Book of Souls may not quite be a full-on return to glorious 1980s form, but it's still an excellent addition to the Maiden catalogue. In spite of its extravagant length, it never gets tedious, which is quite an accomplishment in and of itself. Diverse and effective songwriting does wonders here to keep this behemoth of an album entertaining throughout its opulent duration, while a somewhat more upbeat style and quicker tempos set it apart from other recent Maiden studio releases. Those who found The Final Frontier and particularly A Matter of Life and Death a little too morose and brooding should have a better time with the more immediately energetic and less slow-developing Book of Souls, which shows Maiden in great shape even after so many years in the business. Since The Book of Souls is essentially two albums in one, we might have to wait a little while before the next go-round, but at least there's plenty of quality material on here to render the wait a little more tolerable. Actually, listening to The Book of Souls is a lot like watching the latest Star Wars movie: you've waited a long time, everybody involved got even older, you pretty much know what's coming, you're unlikely to be completely blown away like you were as a wide-eyed teenager \u2026 but it's still one heck of a ride!\n\nRating The Book of Souls, part one: 94%\nRating The Book of Souls, part two: 89%\nAverage score: 92%\n",
        "\nIt's sort of funny to hear the term \u201cmodern Maiden\u201d as Brave New World was released fifteen years ago, that's older than many popular bands nowadays! I guess that's a testimonial to the Brits' long and thunderous career? Anyhow, the fifth album since the return of Bruce \u201cbadass\u201d Dickinson, The Book of Souls is certainly an adventurous album but there's some issues plaguing the ninety plus minute trip to really achieve the double album nirvana, it's still a pretty good album though. \n\nThe usual argument against double albums is that fact that most of them would be much better as a single disc and this is true for this record too. If they had to learn anything from Judas Priest, it was obviously to never do a double album. Too bad. The four previous Maiden albums (and also The X Factor) could had seen their lengths considerably reduced and I was hoping that after The Final Frontier, Harris and the boys would finally write a more concise release. Nope, it's their longest and most tedious one ever. The length is not necessarily the issue here, the problem with many of these songs is that they're just way too long for their own sake like \u201cThe Red and the Black\u201d and its thirteen minutes. It's like good meat but with way too much fat that your butcher forgot to remove. With a career spawning many decades, they decided to do whatever the fuck they wanted and I must salute this even if it didn't work.\n\nNevertheless, it's still Maiden being Maiden, there's many brilliant moments here such as the psychedelic almost western spaghetti intro of \u201cIf Eternity Should Fail\u201d, one of the best songs on the album and the first out of two to be written solely by Dickinson. The other being their longest song ever, the eighteen minutes epic closer \u201cEmpire of the Clouds\u201d. The use of piano on this track is interesting and it's some sort of subtle historical opera, it's not the disaster I was expecting, really. It's one of the only tracks that actually feels shorter than it truly is and I liked how it's built. Outside of the long tracks, the shorter ones doesn't always work quite well (\u201cSpeed of Light\u201d is underwhelming) and some of these were also disposable. The ballad-esque \u201cThe Man of Sorrows\u201d or \u201cThe Great Unknown\u201d are pretty damn great, the whole thing could had been tighter, it's all. There's no superb fast paced tracks like \"The Mercenary\" here and it's a shame.\n\nIt's a varied and dark album but the classic Maiden leads are always there to lift your spirit. The instrumentation is once again top notch and I appreciate that the bass isn't in your face as much as on some other of their albums. Since Steve Harris is less involved than usual due to some personal issues, it's a more democratic effort and it's a cool thing. We have the acoustic leanings of Janick Gers (a totally underrated guitarist) on the title track, the proggy AOR approach of Adrian Smith on \u201cSpeed of Light\u201d or the long-winded epic formula of Harris. It's a vast album and has everything to please everyone but it's hard to digest as a whole in one sitting, it's like stuffing your face with fifteen hot dogs.\n\nI like Bruce's rough and mature voice, I think he aged well and isn't straining too much. The lyrics are also great (most of the time), they're not too cheesy and deals with death in a meaningful way. Maiden at this point is an experienced band and I can't quite say that they sound tired, they're not exactly rehashing ideas even though most of the album is nothing new. It's hard to find a band this old who's still able to be as invigorated except maybe for Rush.\n\nAs a fifty minutes album, this would had been spectacular but ninety-two minutes is just overwhelming. I tend to listen to my favorite parts and ignore skip some of the weaker moments, that's something I hate to do since I love listening to albums as a whole. Can't we just get a short album for once, guys? A new Maiden album remains a big event but I can't say that I was completely satisfied with this one. Nonetheless, when it's good, it's freaking good.\n\nMetantoine's Magickal Realm\n",
        "\nI find few things in life more exciting than the realization that a new Iron Maiden album is being made and will be released upon this fantastic and wretched planet. Actually, I can't think in anything more exciting. A new Judas Priest or Black Sabbath record might be equally exciting, for sure. And I do love many, many, MANY bands, past and present, big and underground, but the Irons are\u2026 THE BLOODY IRONS!!! So, you can guess the adrenaline rush my body experienced when I knew Iron Maiden's sixteenth studio record was on its way. A studio DOUBLE album, to be precise! Damn! Then the minimalistic Mark Wilkinson cover artwork was shown, something special to behold, for sure. An aboriginal Eddie? What sorcery is this? This grand new beast, named The Book of Souls, seemed quite promising even before the leading single, \u201cSpeed of Light\u201d, was released as a sneak preview, accompanied by an awesome video showcasing Eddie's travels as well as the evolution of video games. Pretty damn cool, huh? Five years after the solid but personally disappointing The Final Frontier, which fortunately for us wasn't that final, expectations were (pun alert) as high as aces again!\n\nNow, you've probably heard the material by now, but if you haven't\u2026 IT IS PRETTY GOOD! Some might even call it album of the year, which is stretching it a bit, especially with all the awesome records being released by newer, fresher acts. Yet still, from the select group of the older, still active, consecrated and well established acts I would concur it is a strong contender for that title. Now, even though I love Maiden, for me their golden years in terms of musical innovation are long past, so I wasn't expecting a masterpiece, just a good ol' dose of sonic Iron, and that's precisely what we've got here. The intro of \u201cIf Eternity Should Fail\u201d reminded me a lot of \u201cSatellite 15\u201d, and that didn't bode well for my taste, but fortunately the album has more variety and richness than its predecessor. Still, not a great opener, but it does have a strong chorus and a cheesy, but appreciated, outro. The aforementioned \u201cSpeed of Light\u201d comes next, and it's a straight rocker with Maiden's trademark galloping rhythms, and Bruce's still forceful vocals. I can imagine the live version of this tune, it's gonna be sweet! From then onward, my reactions fluctuated between \u201cok, solid stuff\u201d to \u201cwhoa, this is great!\u201d from track to track. \n\nThe record traverses a varied array of moods and song lengths, but the overall concept is the fascination provoked by the mysteries of life and death, the mysticism inspired by the unknown aspects of cosmos and existence, and the melancholy in the realization that mankind is a small, petty thing, both in space and time; a tiny spark in the wildfire of creation. Those themes are spliced with several more earthly tales of strife, failure and tragedy (and the Red Baron!). It mostly conveys a quite doomy atmosphere, even though the music is 100% 21st Century Iron Maiden branded. Thematically, this is one of the gloomier things they've released, for sure. However, the lyrics are a bit hit or miss for me this time around. A lot of them are quite ambiguous and redundant. There are are some amazing phrases, and then you have some overused rhymes, sub par to the quality the Ancient Mariner requires, like these:\n\n\u201cThere's no use in hiding, got to keep on trying\nCan't take no more lying, this is the last\nThere's no time for crying when some of us are dying\u201d\n\nI think they could have done waaay better than that, and I feel that for all the appeal in the chosen themes, they just didn't nail it lyrically. But anyway, what really propels the record is the band tightness and sharp performance, as usual. Bruce's vocals are not what they used to be, but he's still has more power than most frontmen out there, and still displays honest, moving passion in his singing, from his soft, almost spoken word narrations to his more forceful shouts. He still is and always will be, Iron Maiden's voice. The rhythmic section is spot on as well, there's no denying that both Steve Harris and Nicko McBrain remain one of the most powerful rhythmic duos out there, instantly recognizable, still enormously influential and many times emulated but never quite matched. So much personality there. Hell, I think they could do an album on their own and it would kick ass. But the guitar power trio of Gers, Murray & Smith doesn't fall behind, and they complete the musical anatomy of the Eddie we love so dearly. While their signature riffs are as good as expected, I believe that this album has some of their best 21st Century soloing, and that's an additional forte. They have desisted in playing blazingly fast solos, and instead have focused more in their construction. Less showing-off, more finesse: definitely more appealing. The guitarwork on the 13-minute \u201cThe Red and the Black\u201d is just outstanding. That's my favorite tune from The Book of Souls, by the way. \n\nMuch talk has been made about the Irons' longer song ever recorded, \u201cEmpire of the Clouds\u201d, the closer, a humongous 18-minute tale of the fateful final flight of the R101, a British hydrogen-filled rigid airship that crashed on France on the 5th of October, 1930, a disastrous incident in which 48 of the 54 people on board perished. A great catastrophe, which brought an end to Great Britain's airship development, and represents a culmination of the grief and longing this record displays during its entirety. It starts with symphonic intro, a melancholic piano and some strings before giving way to a Jethro Tull-esque number, with a mid-paced prog rock cadence, and halfway through the composition it starts to build up more strength (like the lethal storm it depicts), as the solos kick in. The middle section of the track displays some changes in tempo and different themes, neither overblown nor sufficiently fulfilling. It actually feels just like a modern, really long, Iron Maiden tune, and I don't find any major flaws in it, though I feel it never reaches a truly powerful climax. In fact, before listening to it, I imagined more ambitious than it happens to be. A good song, but way inferior to \u201cRime of the Ancient Mariner\u201d, \u201cSeventh Son of a Seventh Son\u201d, or even its 13-minute sibling on this very record, or my other preferred tracks here, \u201cWhen the Rivers Runs Deep\u201d, \u201cShadows of the Valley\u201d and \u201cTears of a Clown\u201d.\n\nIts 2015 and we've been blessed with and hour and a half of quality new Iron Maiden metal. Though far from being a masterpiece, I believe the majority of metalheads listening to this won't be disappointed. So, in the strange case that you haven\u2019t experienced this yet, I have to remind you that Eddie's immortal, but you shouldn't be wasting your mortal life. Give it a spin now!\n\n\nOriginally written for Metal Recusants [metalrecusants.com]\n",
        "\nIron Maiden, one of the biggest bands to come out of the NWOBHM scene is trying to still do the best they can today. However, is what they still have left in them enough to make a quality album? Iron Maiden claims to be doing more experimentation than ever with this album and that they were going to try new things. With that being said, they did add in a couple new things to the album. However, they were very minor. The band relies on much of the string instrumentation in the background to fill the sound and to give it a more epic feel and in this album add instruments such as brass and piano, especially in the song Empire of The Clouds. They didn't do too much to make it sound like Iron Maiden was trying to go out of their way to make a new sound. If anything, their later 1980s albums such as Somewhere in Time and Seventh Son of A Seventh Son are way more experimental than this.\n\nThe next thing I have to criticize about the album are the almost too familiar song structures throughout the album. Almost every song still starts out with the slow introduction that eventually adds the vocals then the increased tempo of the tune. It is nice to hear that sometimes, but to hear that in every song in the album makes everything too predictable. Not to mention the drums sounded the same throughout the album. It seemed like it was at the same tempo and same playing during all of the songs. Bruce's vocal melodies throughout songs sound repetitive as well throughout the verses of each tune. \n\nAnd now we reach the production and solos. The solos are decent in most of the songs. They are nothing to write home about. It seems like typical Iron Maiden guitar playing. It almost seems like there are too many solos in the album and are just there to drag out the song to make Maiden look more progressive than they really are. The production seems to be a little sloppy on the album as well. Not bad, but it seems the band it trying to sound heavier than what they really are as well. \n\nWith the production out of the way, let's talk about Bruce's vocals on this album. First impression, they are tired. As much as I wish to say they are great, they are decent at best. He may be able to reach high notes at times throughout the album, but they are way too forced and he sounds very flat. The scream at the beginning at Speed of Light was Bruce trying to show that he thinks he can still do what he did back 20 - 25 years ago. However, it was weak and it shouldn't have been put in the track. \n\nI did review this album a few months ago, however after a few more listens to the album, realized how weak of an album this was. As a huge Iron Maiden fan, I wish I could give this album a higher score. Most of the reviews about this album in my opinion are biased because as most people know, Iron Maiden fans pretty much will call anything by the band a \"Masterpiece\". Even if it is an 18 minute song that drags that would put Eddie the Head to sleep. Sorry Maiden, the Trooper was defeated 10 years ago.\n",
        "\nBy this point in their career Iron Maiden had been running for nearly a decade and had released four great albums. Their fifth record would add even more classics to their rapidly growing catalogue of songs and make the band even more famous in the metal scene (if that was even possible). Maiden decided to do what the last four albums had done and give us a dose of good, old fashioned heavy metal while throwing in a few new things for fans to sink their teeth into.\n\nThe album has the usual lyrics from Iron Maiden: Historical (Aces High), Literary, (Rime of the Ancient Mariner) and Mythological (the title track). \"Aces High\" speaks of the Battle of Britain with the narrator being a British fighter pilot. The lyrics succeed in installing the desperation of the British in the listener as they repeatedly insist on getting the planes up in the air as quickly as possible. And even right after that, by shouting words like \"rolling, turning, diving\" without any other description paints a picture of total chaos. Those skies are filled with planes whose pilots have to be quick to react or they're going down. And the ending scream of \"Aces HIGH!\" really does sound like an air raid siren warning of an impending attack. \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\" lyrics continually switch moods, from the neutral beginning of the tale to the eerie telling of the mariner watching his shipmates drop dead in front of his eyes, the lyrics more often than not hit the nail on the head with what they want to achieve. A highlight is the ending, when Bruce states the the wedding guest leaves sad \"and the tale goes on and on and on and on.\" There will be no end to the story. \"Powerslave\" goes for a more threatening set of lyrics, describing an Egyptian Pharaoh who questions if he's a god then why can't he live forever and concluding if his eternal rest is disturbed he will punish the perpetrator from beyond the grave. Personal preference says that this set of lyrics is slightly less interesting than the other songs but that's just because of the subject matter. They're still beautifully written and delivered by Bruce.\n\nSpeaking of Bruce, the performance from the band is spot on. Bruce's voice sounds just as good as ever, whether he's going for the air raid siren scream on \"Aces High\", sing-talking his way through \"The Duellist\" or complimenting the instrumentation on the title track, the vocals are rarely, if ever, disappointing. The guitars sound just as crisp, clean and heavy as they did on records past and the riffs they belt out highlight the band's knack for making great music. The drums are feet-tappingly excellent and keeping in mind that tracks like \"Aces High\" were done with only one bass drum just pushes Nicko's musical talents high above the rest of his piers. Steve Harris, what else can be said that hasn't already. The man writes great songs and plays his bass even better. Unlike most other metal records, the bass is not only audible but is doing things that a normal bass wouldn't. Most basses simply play the lowest note the guitar is playing, but sometimes the bass is heard playing independent to the guitars like in \"Back in the Village\" it's heard playing in between guitar licks pre-chorus. \n\nAll that being said, there is one glaring problem with this album: \"Losfer Words\". Instrumentals are always a risk in any album. Doing it right can potentially do something and give it purpose but this one doesn't. It's not offensively bad it just has no reason to exist on the album. It tries it's best to sound interesting, that's for certain, but trying your hardest doesn't always mean you're going to succeed. It's safe to skip this track without missing anything. \n\nApart from that problem, Powerslave is a timeless and classic record that has rightly earned it's spot as a classic in Maiden's discography. It's patented Maiden lyrics, vocals, bass, riffing and song structure make it a most have for every metal head out there.\n",
        "\nIf you're making a list of Maiden's albums, from best to worst, and put The X Factor at the bottom (and/or Virtual XI for that matter), using \"Blaze Bayley\" as your argument, you can shove your list where no light should shine, because it's wrong. And now that I've explained invalid 90 percent of all Maiden album rankings in existence, I'll tell you why. After the happy eighties Maiden's sound gradually got darker, more introspective. Actually, it started already on 1988's Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son before culminating in The X Factor, released in 1995.\n\nBut even with its darkness and its gloomy sound, the album does hint at positives. Most often in the guitars. Like before the blistering guitar solo in 'The Aftermath' or the quick leads in 'The Edge Of Darkness'. Dave Murray and Janick Gers make their third Maiden record together and their chemistry is tighter than before. The overall guitar sound is also a big improvement from the previous two albums. Sometimes Murray feels a bit laid back while the brisk Gers keeps even the darkest tracks alive. Very few Maiden albums have had song material this strong. Most albums have one or a few half weak songs, but The X Factor has zero. In its entirety, the album reaches 70 minutes. That's a pretty long album. Despite this, no single song feels like filler, even to the point that I'd have wanted at least one more song. 'Judgement Day', found on the 'Man On The Edge' single as a B side would have worked as an opener and a single of its own, and 'Virus' fits the whole theme of the album perfectly and would have made an excellent addition and album closer.\n\nOf course, the one who takes the hardest beating for this album is Blaze Bayley. Only because he isn't Bruce Dickinson or his clone. But the truth is he is perfect for the part. His deep, dark voice makes excellent in mid tempo tracks like 'Lord Of The Flies' and 'The Edge Of Darkness'. But, also the fastest track, single 'Man On The Edge' gets a solid delivery by Bayley. The song is straight to the point, hinting of classic Maiden, with a sublime bass line by Steve Harris, with a distinct 90's touch. Many of the lyrics Bayley gets to sing are soul searching, introspective, almost haunted. They are clear testament to Harris' mental health at the time, having gone through divorce, the loss of front man Dickinson, long time Maiden producer Martin Birch and the passing of his father.\n\n\"Oh man, he's a tortured motherfucker, Steve is sometimes\", Dickinson has later said. Harris' sound on The X Factor is deep and dark and seems to go hand in hand with Bayley's uncontrollably emotive voice. The bass intro to 'Blood On The World's Hands' is 70 seconds in length and gives the song a distinct sense of self. The guitar leads in the song are also close to perfect, while the vocal melodies do lack in something that I can't put my finger on. The chorus somehow feels incomplete, and the song reminds me a bit of 'Face In The Sand', to show up on 2003's Dance Of Death. It's by no account a bad song, quite the opposite, but still is the weakest on the album.\n\nAs I stated earlier, The X Factor has some of Maiden's best song material to date. 'Fortunes Of War' is unbelievably underrated. A seven minute relic where Bayley goes through close to every emotive state there is. Somewhat repetitive in its \"chorus\", but Harris makes one of his career's best deliveries. And the lead guitar, melancholic, foreboding and among the best I've heard. Another highlight is 'Judgement Of Heaven'. It's insane that Maiden haven't played it live. It's only as of late that Bayley has picked it up for a few solo performances. Even though it goes through the same darkness that the rest of the album does, it does hint of some positivity. As if Heaven's judgement might not be bad, in the end.\n\n'The Unbeliever' would have been praised had Dickinson sung it. Written by my personal favorite duo in Maiden songwriting, Harris/Gers, it closes The X Factor and reminds a bit of Harris/Gers penned songs to come, like 'Dream Of Mirrors' of Brave New World (for which Bayley actually wrote some lyrics!). 'The Unbeliever' would have fit better closer to the middle of the album. In fact, that might be the biggest flaw that The X Factor makes. Song placement. 'Man On The Edge' should have opened. Instead, the opener would have been my choice of closing song. It's Maiden's most theatrical song. And one of their best.\n\n'Sign Of The Cross' has been praised, and not just Dickinson's version (it was played on the Brave New World tour, making an appearance on live album Rock In Rio), just like it should. It's a \"Harris epic\" dealing with the Spanish inquisition. 80 seconds of Gregorian chanting opens the song ominously before guitar and bass makes their entrance. Slow, low key and foreboding. It's the greatest song Bayley has ever sung, and as I said, one of Maiden's greatest tracks. In its eleven minute run time, it has everything. The slow build up leads to fast, heavy parts where Bayley's singing is simply sublime. Murray and Gers shines with perfect guitar parts. In short, probably the most underrated song ever.\n\nAs a whole, The X Factor is one of Maiden's most complete albums. Several lists that I've read ranks it as Maiden's worst, and to tell you the truth, that's all bullshit by idiots writing what \"fans\" want to hear; that everything Maiden has done after the 80's suck. The kind of people who covers his ears and goes \"la la la la\" when you try to convince them to give the album an honest chance. But no. And so The X Factor is the most underrated album there is. Simply because Bruce Dickinson or his clone doesn't sing on it.\n\nStandout tracks: Sign Of The Cross, Fortunes Of War, Judgement Of Heaven\n",
        "\nSo, which Iron Maiden album do you worship? I'm assuming one of two reactions to that question: either a sudden thought like a lightning bolt cutting down the middle of your brain or a slow, relaxed smile, after which the declaration \"All of them!\" pops out of your mouth. I'm not going to outright say you're wrong if you've got a particular favourite or if you think all of them are of an exceptional standard, but I am going to ask \"Are you sure?\" I think most visitors to this website should be familiar with Iron Maiden and have heard at least some of the classic material, if not have a reasonable knowledge of their career in general. The reason I'm coming at this with such a questioning point of view is due to Maiden's newer material, which many fans have welcomed with open arms, while I'm more than sceptical about the quality of the last couple of albums. I'm also of the opinion that some of the \"classic\" Maiden albums (that would be all the 80s work) needs to be reconsidered by some fans, since the general impression one gets is that the whole decade saw the Londoners producing album after album of sing-alongs, great solos, and romping rhythms, without a dip in greatness or a fluctuation in style. While the quality is generally high for all these albums, there are a great number of differences that separate 'Killers' from 'Seventh Son of a Seventh Son' and can make even the most ardent of fans reconsider their love for the band.\n\n'Somewhere in Time' was actually a huge step away from 'Powerslave' stylistically, including the addition of guitar synths and keyboards, progressive instrumental ideas (though not song structures), and a rethinking of Maiden's lyrical aims. Never exactly a commercial band in the first instance, 'Somewhere in Time' saw the average song length dragged out to over 6 minutes and, unlike with 'Powerslave', which was dominated by the great bulk of the 13 minute 'Rime of the Ancient Mariner', features only one song that falls short of 5 minutes - 'Deja Vu', which is only wanting of 5 seconds to reach that total. Perhaps what surprises about 'Somewhere in Time' is that this length doesn't make for dragging songs or lengthy introductions and interludes like the later Maiden material: instead, the 8 songs here are all sprightly, bounding forward with the kind of energy and heroism that make heavy metal such an inspiring music to listen to. The riff approach had not been totally revamped for this album, but some of the speed metal influences and stand alone melodies were weened out by this point, so that there aren't any songs like 'Back in the Village' that feel split into sections simply to show a different aspect of the sound.\n\nThe synths and keyboards may play a large part in this, because both instruments soften the sound a great deal when compared to the grittier guitar sound that was characteristic of metal in the early 80s. Listening to some of the melodies in 'The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner', one can almost say that the guitars sound light and airy, which is the opposite effect to the rhythm section, who pummel and bounce so relentlessly that they may conjure the image of a majestic bird expending all its energy to stay airborne, though it crafts the most elegant flight. This gives the album a very melodic character, but without losing a great deal of heaviness, a good idea for Maiden because their heaviness rarely came directly from the riffs, which more often gallop and rush and grapple with catchiness. There are minor problems with the flowery, over-sweet keyboards on 'Deja Vu' and some of 'Heaven Can Wait' may seem oversaturated with melody, but in general the lightness works well, preventing anything from becoming trudging and flat-footed. What seems a little strange is that this approach was continued for only one more album and then ditched, supposedly because the guitar synths were already dated and losing their appeal, though in 2015 they give the album a timeless feel, rather than a dated one, which is exactly what it needs given the subject matter.\n\nThe music on 'Somewhere in Time' is complex, especially when compared to the other NWOBHM bands of the time, the emerging thrash and extreme scene, and Maiden's own early work. I don't mean complex in a purely stylistic sense, because thrash and death metal were arguably more technical genres even in 1986, but because the developing ideas in each song don't work on the principle of repetition alone to achieve their ends. There is a lot of detail in this album for anyone who has the patience or inclination to find it (ditto for the cover image), with small variations and jam parts dripped in to various songs in the same way that Fates Warning did on 'The Spectre Within'. Steve Harris never was a strictly rhythmic bass player, though here he is burbling and clicking through many of the songs in an increasingly creative manner, not just being tooth-rattlingly heavy. Likewise Nicko McBrain, who really has his star moment on this fast-paced set of songs. Broadening the template from the band's trademark gallop to include all manner of other moods and patterns, he gives a great solidity to the more comtemplative sections, as well as power and spontaneity to the upbeat riffs. One niggle that I have with the instrumental performance is with the guitar solos. The melodies are great for the most part, with the classic opening to 'Wasted Years', the hooks in 'Long Distance Runner', and the atmospheric motif of 'Stranger in a Strange Land', but the solos fail to fully capture my attention and swell my heart in the same way that occurred on Maiden albums both before and after this. They aren't poor per se (and I think that even the bad Maiden albums were somewhat redeemed by the solos), they just don't have the same feel to them that I get from 'The Number of the Beast' or 'Paschendale'. Some have commented that Dave Murray didn't pull his weight on this album and it is the lack of his captivating, nostalgic leads that really leave 'Alexander the Great' and 'Caught Somewhere in Time' with great holes in their extended lead sections - if you're going to spend 3 minutes focusing on guitars, I need something to keep me interested beyond technicality.\n\nThere's another big problem with 'Somewhere in Time', and that's how dumb some of the lyrics are. Bruce Dickinson doesn't really have many problems on vocals, though his style is certainly not my favourite out of Maiden's early albums, but it's the sheer dumbness of songs like 'Deja Vu' that drag the songs down at times. If the band were going for a more progressive approach instrumentally, surely balancing that progressiveness with equally challenging (or at least interesting) lyrics should have been the way to go? But no, we get this for the verse in 'Deja Vu':\n\nEver had a conversation\nThat you realize you've had before?\nIsn't it strange?\nHave you ever talked to someone\nAnd you feel you know what's coming next?\nIt feels pre-arranged.\n\nBasically, Iron Maiden have opened the dictionary and copied out the definition of deja vu, then just stuck that definition into the song. For a bunch of guys who managed to write 'Hallowed Be Thy Name' and make 'Rime of the Ancient Mariner' into an engaging song, you might expect something more: a story, a personality, some passion - anything. Also, the vocal melody isn't anything special and makes the two shorter lines sound really stupid. Then there are other songs that suffer because they have awfully repetitive choruses. 'Caught Somewhere in Time', 'Heaven Can Wait', and (to a lesser extent) 'Long Distance Runner' have exactly zero power as choruses even when Bruce is belting them out, because they don't have any meaning or longevity and, if they get stuck in your head, they're going to annoy the crap out of you while you're humming that line over and over again. On the other hand, the likes of 'Wasted Years', 'Sea of Madness', and 'Stranger in a Strange Land' have hugely satisfying choruses that soar and emote and, in the latter instance, even possess a certain dogged travelling vibe that gives the song atmosphere.\n\nThe shorter songs work better here, those being the 3 mentioned above plus 'Deja Vu', which all have enough energy and drive to keep them constantly entertaining for 5 or 6 minutes, while they don't suffer so much from the extended instrumental breaks that sometimes fail to deliver. My pick would probably be 'Sea of Madness', which actually has the most straightforward heavy riff on the album, but tempers it with great melodies, a huge chorus, and decent solo. 'Stranger in a Strange Land' is quite slow for the general pace, but succeeds in a more subtle way, with carefully sculpted guitar lines and better unity between music, lyrics, and atmosphere. I wouldn't completely discount any songs, though I've never been a fan of 'Heaven Can Wait' and a few minutes should have been cut from the opening track. Both of these seem to suffer from the same problem, as if they were written with one eye on musical progression and the other on the stadiums that Maiden had conquered on the 'Powerslave' tour: they end up with too many parts that are singalong for the sake of it (those \"Woah\"s and the chorus in 'Heaven Can Wait' particularly) and also include parts that aren't memorable enough, meaning that they don't truly succeed at either goal.\n\n'Somewhere in Time' is a very good album, though has rarely been heralded with the classic status of the other early Maiden albums. Perhaps this is rightly so, because for all its accomplishments, there are moments and certain aspects that fall short of the standard one expects from a classic album. This is probably also the first Maiden release that falls prey to self-indulgence, with some songs outstaying their welcome and being long merely for the sake of it. Of course, I would recommend this to every fan of the band, but I wouldn't recommend it as an essential listen, just an enjoyable one.\n",
        "\nReviewing a new album from the greatest heavy metal band in the world is always a task. Partly because I have so much in-built bias, but partly because Iron Maiden releases are more than just albums. They are events. And it\u2019s genuinely hard to admit it when an event isn\u2019t as much fun as you\u2019d expected. Luckily, this is Maiden\u2019s finest release in many years.\n\nIn the recent(ish) past, Maiden have enjoyed somewhat mixed fortunes. They\u2019ve hung on to that 'Greatest Ever' title largely on the strength of their truly (and often literally) incendiary live shows, but while they\u2019ve continued to enjoy sales in the gold range, their output in the 2000s has been a mixed bag. Kevin Shirley\u2019s somewhat flat production can be blamed for some of this, but it\u2019s also hard to escape the feeling that Maiden have been treading a certain amount of water. A muddled, flat sound and a lack of the energy that made mid-period Maiden so genuinely thrilling. It\u2019s trite to say this is a return to form, but this is a fine album that makes the most of the band\u2019s heritage without resting on it\u2019s laurels. The intro synths on opener \u2018If Eternity Should Fail\u2019 are cheesy as all hell, but have a tiny touch of Powerslave\u2019s Egyptian mystery to them and set the tone for the massive eight-minute plus track that\u2019s about to assault us with a pretty good chorus and middle section. The album's single 'Speed of Light' is a galloping bit of fun, with some upbeat twin guitar work and a catchy, bouncy chorus that carries the listener through time and space. Time travel is a theme here. Lyrically we leap from era to era, not only of world history, but also of the band themselves. The title track manages to fuse touches of 2000\u2019s Brave New World album with the stripped-back classic British rock that last reared it\u2019s head way back on 91\u2019s No Prayer for the Dying.\n\nThe epic (there are a lot of epics on The Book of Souls, including Empire of Clouds, Maiden\u2019s longest ever song at almost 19 minutes). 'The Red and the Black\u2019 also digs deeply, pulling out the trademark woah-oh-oh singalong chants as it switches pace rapidly, shoving a whole album\u2019s worth of riffs into a superb 13 minute package. Maiden seem to have rediscovered the sense of genuine joy that make their live shows so thrilling. It\u2019s impossible not to grin when you\u2019re dealing with a 15-riff-fest, yelling the words \u201cdeath or glory\u201d at the top of your lungs and waiting for the 32nd -note gallops to coalesce into a fantastic twin harmony solo, but somehow this had seemed missing from the band\u2019s recent releases. They were in danger of becoming pompous, but here they\u2019re in on the fun again, and it\u2019s a revelation (excuse the pun that only fans will get).\n\nThere\u2019s some genuine electricity running underneath those guitar lines. Dave and Adrian manage their methodical/mercurial duel with aplomb, and even the much-maligned Janick displays some nuanced playing that fits more comfortably in with the riffs than many of his past efforts. The songwriting is strong and complex, with several obvious influences from Dickinson\u2019s solo work, but a newfound sense of balance, mixing old and new elements more evenly and effectively than ever before, although lyrically this often sails into silly waters. Fans have come to expect songs about band member\u2019s hobbies from time to time (Take a bow 'Flash of the Blade\u2019) but while closing track \u2018Empire of the Clouds\u2019 is a truly magnificent slice of rock opera, it\u2019s marred by the bizarre shadow of Top Gear, a middle-aged dad\u2019s geeky love of machinery intruding on what could be an effective tribute.\n\nWith that said, it\u2019s nice to see such a well-balanced album. 'Tears of a Clown\u2019 is slightly maudlin, but musically it\u2019s hard to fault and this makes up for the soppier moments across the entire double album. Overall it\u2019s the sound of a band that are both perfectly comfortable with their interests, but also of one pushing their musical envelope into strange new places. There\u2019s a lovely dash of piratical piano and violin towards the end that makes you want to run around on a poop-deck with a sabre in hand. It\u2019s boys own adventure, but it\u2019s perfectly executed, doesn\u2019t take itself overly-seriously and, let\u2019s face it, it means there\u2019s another tour coming soon.\n\n'The Book of Souls' is a damn good Maiden album. A perfect blend of old and new that cements their place at the top of the Metal tree (and it\u2019s somehow convinced Tesco to start selling double-vinyl again, which makes it worth 20 quid of anyone\u2019s money).\n",
        "\nThe Book of Souls marks Maiden's sixteenth album, surfacing five years after 2010's The Final Frontier. Stylistically 21st Century Maiden is a different beast than earlier incarnations of the band. Gone are a lot of the more traditionally-arranged shorter metal tunes, often replaced by longer, expansive complicated proggy-type compositions. If were being honest about things, I prefer this Maiden. Yes, Powerslave is still one of the greatest records of all time, and there are countless worthy tunes scattered about through the first eleven (okay, the first nine) albums. Who doesn't like Aces High? The Trooper? Holy Smoke?\n\nTo me though, Maiden's real asskickery tends to be found in the longer tracks. Rime of the Ancient Mariner is and will always be one of my five favorite Maiden anthems. That there'd eventually be more songs like this, the more complicated, longer songs such as Paschendale or Where the Wild Wind Blows, is to me a good thing. If we break this up by length and consider, for the sake of argument, anything beyond the seven minute mark a \"longer, expansive complicated proggy-type composition\", then the only album prior to 2000's Brave New World with more than one was Somewhere In Time, with three.\n\nBook of Souls itself offers five, culminating with Empire of the Clouds at just over 18 minutes, Maiden's longest track to date. Again, this is not to say that they haven't and don't still write great songs that fall on the shorter end of the spectrum, but serves to illustrate why I can't get enough of Maiden's more recent offerings. And given how Book of Souls does build off of a lot of that development, it's worth explaining. Probably.\n\nANYWAY.\n\nWhere to begin with Book of Souls? The most obvious place is in the production. Everything sounds, well, \"clean\". That isn't implying that this is Maiden - The Acoustic Version or anything (although now I want an acoustic Maiden set). But the production has enough clarity that nothing seems buried within the mix. All the instruments seem balanced well, with a solid mixing job leveling everything out and making for a positive auditory experience.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, the band is plugging right away. These are clearly a bunch of guys who have been playing, and playing together for that matter, for a good long time. You can definitely say that they're taking full advantage of having three guitarists in the band, with varied guitar bits, layered harmonies, and solos all over the place. If there's a fault it's that there's a bit of self-plagiarization evident in a few places. For example, the title track seems to have jacked a stripped-down version of the intro to The Talisman, and the album closer features a riff in the middle of the song that's a very slight variation from one found in The Legacy.\n\nFor the most part, Bruce is Bruce. He did seem to struggle a bit with some of the higher notes he tried to hit in The Great Unknown, but apart from that the guy seems prepared to continue for another decade. Throw in an ever increasing age and a cancer scare, and the fact that he still sounds this good overall is pretty remarkable. One thing is for sure - if his range is shrinking a bit, his vibrato is completely intact! I was a bit skeptical of how Bruce would sound over the entire album after I heard Speed of Light, as he takes a bit rawer, more aggresive approach there. One couldn't help but wonder if that was indicative of a stylistic choice or was the result of health and five more years of age. Fortunately, it seems to have been the first option.\n\nThe album kicks off with one of the longer tracks, If Eternity Should Fail. Yup, Maiden is back. Easily one of my favorite tracks from the album and a great place to start. It takes after opener Satellite 15 from The Final Frontier in a sense, with the odd intro. Lead single Speed of Light rolls in next, and at this point the question must be asked - who do we have to bribe/pay/etc. to get the rest of the guys to let Bruce and/or Adrian write an entire album? Yeah yeah, those two have collaborated on some of Bruce's solo stuff, but their collaborations on Maiden's albums tend to be more appealing.\n\nAfter Speed of Light, however, the album starts to become a bit convoluted. The Great Unknown is mediocre, as is When the River Runs Deep. The Red and the Black, a Steve Harris song checking in at about thirteen and a half minutes, is just too bloated on the back end and would've actually been much better received if it was half as long. While Maiden does turn out great longer songs, sometimes it just doesn't work right. Frankly, there's enough extraneous riffing, soloing, and whatnot that you have to wonder if they wouldn't have been better off shortening a few things and sticking the remaining bits together as a gigantoid instrumental track.\n\nThe back end of the album (also known as \"disc 2\") fortunately kicks things back into high gear, starting with the Smith/Dickinson tune Death or Glory, which is sorta like The Trooper but reimagined to be about the Red Baron. There are a few slight stumbles along the way, such as The Man of Sorrows which would've benefited from a slightly higher tempo. All of this builds right into the final track on the album, Dickinson's massive homage to the R101 airship disaster Empire Of The Clouds. Bruce on the piano. Exploding dirigibles. Great, great tune. And to its credit it keeps you engaged through the entire running time, unlike the aforementioned The Red and the Black. Think of Rime of the Ancient Mariner, with it's different sections, interludes, buildups, bridges, and everything, but longer and a bit more developed.\n\nThe standout tracks on the album are If Eternity Should Fail (Dickinson), Speed of Light (Smith/Dickinson), Death or Glory (Smith/Dickinson), and Empire Of The Clouds (Dickinson). If you're noticing a theme there, refer to previous question about future songwriting.\n\nRegardless of your preferred iteration of Maiden, though, there's something here for everyone. Speed of Light and Death or Glory happen to be two of the shorter, more riff-oriented tracks on the album, and while they probably won't cause you to take Powerslave out of rotation they stand up well with the band's previous work.\n\nOverall, the album is a solid 8 out of 10. The first CD is too inconsistent or unremarkable after the first two songs to rate the album as a whole any higher, but when they're on, they're ON. Hell, the album is worth it for the first and last tracks alone. That they're still putting out songs of this caliber after almost four decades is simply amazing.\n\nAs a side note, I got the digibook version. It's a nice bit of packaging and the illustrations contained within are worth viewing in the \"larger than normal CD insert\" size.\n",
        "\nAt last the 5 year wait for a new Iron Maiden record is over. Following on from 2010's \"The Final Frontier\", we arrive at a very experimental and RICH album in \"Book Of Souls\".\n\nOpening with a great opener for the album in \"If Eternity Should Fail\", we are taken back to their Powerslave period, but soon after, we move to some forced and stale moments (\"When The River Runs Deep\" - co-written by Harris), and then re-hashed ideas in \"Shadows of the Valley\" (again co-written by Harris, the opening riff is almost identical to 1986's \u201cWasted Years\u201d).\n\nOver several albums now I've noticed: Steve Harris, re-hashed ideas... Why does he continue to write these \"woah-woah\" chant-along arena songs like \"The Red And The Black\"? Sure 1986's \"Heaven Can Wait\" was brilliant, but there's no need to keep re-writing the same song. Gladly though, these are really the most negative aspects of the album.\n\nThe album has VERY bluesy LENGTHY periods to carry rhythm sections (in \u201cDeath or Glory\u201d you could use a bottle slide in that solo too). The opening of and rhythm sections of \"Speed Of Light\u201d are more examples - although the song really takes off in the chorus. These kinds of things repeat in a LOT places, there\u2019s a lot of mid-tempo 4/4 playing on the album, and not lot of deviation outside of that. This lends to some songs sounding unfinished.\n\nThe progressive parts of this album are REALLY something, it's just a shame that this more dynamic feel doesn't carry into the rhythm sections of the songwriting. The bridges and solos in \"Shadows of The Valley\", are an absolutely BEAUTIFUL throwback to 1981's \u201cKillers\u201d album. Halfway through \"The Man of Sorrows\" we are treated to movements and vocal lines not heard since 1986\u2019s \u201cSea Of Madness\u201d, with soaring solos and spacious drum fills which actually USE the pace of the underlying rhythm structures. It's an absolutely stunning moment, reminiscent of Pink Floyd and in my opinion is a greater highlight than even Dickinson\u2019s closer \"Empire Of The Clouds\u201d. \n\nWhile such luscious details weave their way in and out of the record, and despite appearing to be sparse, they lend the album an overall complexity that takes some time to explore. However, with the weakness outside of that progression, I'm kept yearning for more creativity to carry the songs. Even more so too, that for the first time, I've noticed I cannot tell the solos of Dave Murray, Adrian Smith and Jannick Gurs apart. This is has been a staple of Iron Maiden for years, but for some reason on this record, it's hard to discern those personalities.\n\nNevertheless, Iron Maiden continue to show that they are growing and experimenting, even four decades in: the opening riff to \"Tears Of A Clown\" feels like classic 70s doom. Yes, you read right - doom riffs on an Iron Maiden record! And somehow they blend it with yes, blues. But it works! I would argue Tears Of A Clown should've been the single, not \"Speed Of Light\". It's a very emotional, but fun and groovy 70s song. Sometimes I feel that Maiden are in their belated version of Enslaved's \"Mardraum\" and \"Monumension\" periods - is this record the final step to a new sound? Is it a transition to a real expansion in their style? After all, in the mature parts of the album, there IS definitely a very noticeable level of highly creative moments which are somewhat more \"unorthodox\" for Iron Maiden.\n\nProduction-wise is where I arrive at my other negative point: I've always had a dislike for Kevin Shirley. Martin Birch\u2019s and Nigel Green's (X Factor, Virtual XI) shoes were big ones to fill, let\u2019s be honest. The band should have stuck with Green for the post-Birch era. \n\nI feel everything Shirley produced with Iron Maiden has sounded soft and muddy in some way, and lacks power and detail. This time the guitars have an overdriven rounded crunch to them (and for someone like Dave Murray in his solos, that sound just doesn't work, you need more sharpness for the soaring heights of his solos, and for Adrian Smith's solos and arpeggios it provides a crystalline finish to his stringwork). Shirley's use of texture removes the dynamic range between the three guitarists from the songs and traps their sound. Nicko's drums sound weak and are too low in the mix. Oddly, Steve's bass sounds too low in the mix as well, so much so, that the lumbering texture of the three Amigos overpowers his him and removes any warmth his bass playing has provided over Iron Maiden's discography up to 2000's \"Brave New World\".\n\nThe overall bands' sound is too \"closed\", the songs don\u2019t open up to their full potential. Even if you blast this album, there's no power coming out of the production. Go back and blast \"Fear Of The Dark\", Green's last work with Maiden, and then Brave New World, Shirley's first work with the band, and you can hear a real softening of the sound which pulls the power OUT of the sound. Production with Shirley since has been progressively far too organic for Maiden's style and the music suffers. I'm #sorrynotsorry, but Shirley really needs to go. In my opinion, Iron Maiden requires a thinner production to really explode and show the individual skills of all musicians.\n\nFinally, closing the album off we arrive at Bruce Dickinson\u2019s 18 minute closer \u201cEmpire Of The Clouds\u201d. The first 3 minutes of the song is unlike anywhere Iron Maiden have gone before. We have Bruce on his new piano (he won it 3 years earlier in a raffle, which led to the writing of this song), cellos (yes, really), Steve on his bass, and subtle notes on guitar. The piano melody carries the whole song, Nicko\u2019s soft drums begin to roll, and then the song begins to build. Bruce continues to pull us in with his poetic story. You can tell this song will be a moment of romanticism live and will suck the entire stadium into its own bubble much like \u201cDance Of Death's\u201d title track did in years past. And it makes you wonder - could this be in fact, an X-Japan styled ROCK BALLAD - by Iron Maiden? Certainly feels like it to me, and that\u2019s by no means a negative criticism. \u201cEmpire Of the Clouds\u201d could be Iron Maiden\u2019s \u201cArt Of Life\u201d. Are we going to see more of this direction from them in future? \n\nI think it's safe to say that this is Iron Maiden's most ambitious moment since 2000's \"Brave New World\u201d. That's no clich\u00e9. \u201cBook of Souls\u201d sees Iron Maiden having REALLY evolved, but yet remaining VERY much Iron Maiden. Is it successful? For the most part, yes. This is a complex, deep and surprisingly experimental band in this late part of their careers \u2013 as long as Steve Harris doesn\u2019t write too many of the songs. The days of us expecting purely metal records like Seventh Son of a Seventh Son are long gone though. Far from what we once thought was a twilight in their careers, Maiden are now embracing their initial roots, bands like Rush, Thin Lizzy, Pink Floyd and others, but at the same time sounding expanded and creative. \n\n\"Book Of Souls\" is a MATURE and complex work, one which will take time to absorb, but it will also educate many listeners out in the world due to sheer amount of rock history it covers. Don\u2019t look for a classic sounding Maiden record, we\u2019re not getting that anymore. \n\nThis is a different band and time now. Bravo, lads. Easily their best record since 2000.\n",
        "\nIron Maiden is the kind of band that needs no introduction. Through their monstrous, and consistently active, 40 years they have established themselves as one of the best metal bands in the world and with their new album \u201cThe Book Of Souls\u201d, they continue to demonstrate just how to successfully uphold such a colossal title. \n\nThe first chapter, \u2018If Eternity Should Fail\u2019, begins as Bruce\u2019s rhapsodic voice pierces through a synth fanfare which immediately expels any worries fans might have about his recovery from tongue cancer. He sounds mystical, confronting and levitated throughout the 8 minutes and doesn\u2019t hog the spotlight from his battle-hardened tribesman. The chorus on \u2018Speed Of Light\u2019 is infectious however the flexuous riffs from Adrian Smith glimmer as they swiftly glide around in a mash of alternate leads from Janick Gers and Dave Murray.\n\nBruce Dickinson\u2019s increased lyrical additions are definitely noticeable: as a certified pilot, he approaches his song-writing directly. \u2018Death or Glory\u2019 is about triplanes used in WW1 where the frolicking guitars symbolise the frantic dogfights of the sky. The visionary 18 minute epic \u2018Empire Of The Clouds\u2019 is about the R101 airship disaster and starts fragilely where Bruce is lightly tapping melodies on piano but builds in awe as his lyrics depict the glory of the airship. As it takes flight, the tempo adjusts to become quicker which makes the mood even more majestic. Everything explodes at the 8:28 mark: flames of recklessly heavy solos and extra drum fills cover the sky as the ship is bought down in a ball of flame and desolation that ends the album solemnly. It\u2019s not the only solemn moment on this double album though; \u2018Tears Of A Clown\u2019 explains the mannerisms of depression. Etched into the false face of happiness are lines of despair and misery: this is the general inspiration behind the tribute to Robin Williams. The music reflects this emotion with a gentle plod of bass and simple drum beats from Nicko McBrain that are shadowed by jovial guitar riffs and solos.\n\nWith an average age of 57, Iron Maiden embody their music as if they where half their age. About 7 minutes in to \u2018The Red And The Black\u2019, harmonies from all members crash together in a typical Iron Maiden pantomimic fashion to conjure a truly masterful and captivating tone to the album. Naturally, as a 13 minute song it\u2019s got to include some tribal war cries from Bruce and he does not disappoint- you can almost hear every person singing \u201cwooaaohhoho\u201d when they play this live. As innovators of NWOBHM, the classic sound is heard during \u2018When The River Runs Deep\u2019 which emphasizes their untouchably energetic attitude through rolling bass a cascade of harmonies from the 6 string trio.\n\nA band as characteristic as the Iron Maiden clan develops an aura of nostalgia when they release new music; and it\u2019s something all fans want to experience. If you want to sing \u201cwooahs\u201d along with Bruce Dickinson, ululate to the trio of guitar melodies or simply bang your head to the gallop of Steve Wilson\u2019s bass and Nicko\u2019s drumming hooks then you\u2019ll undoubtedly be a fan of this. In essence \u201cThe Book Of Souls\u201d is an epic composition of everything the sextet have previously perfected but with a dash of added progressiveness.\n",
        "\n2015's most anticipated album hits the ground like a grenade. The Book Of Souls is Maiden's first album in five long years. (They seem to be doing the same intervals as Blind Guardian.) Recorded, as we all know, when Bruce Dickinson still had a yet to be diagnosed throat cancer, but that's been talked about to death, so I won't mention it any further. When it comes to Maiden it's incredibly popular among reviewers and fans to compare the new tracks to eighties classics - and in Sweden's largest newspaper 'Aftonbladet' even making up song titles to go with it - and fans of the old school will always, always, always, find something to whine about.\n\nMaiden have slowly moved toward an album of the magnitude that is The Book Of Souls. Its length is of course remarkable, but let's remember that it isn't since 1998's Virtual XI that one of their albums have clocked in under an hour's length. The Book Of Souls is \"only\" sixteen minutes longer than its predecessor, The Final Frontier. And from their previous release, Maiden have added weight. The mandatory Steve Harris epic, titled 'The Red And The Black' is a complete show off. Thirteen minutes of milking the guitars where Dave Murray, Adrian Smith and Janick Gers trade off solos in a long, instrumental second half. Dickinson's part of the song contains several \"whoah whoah's\" just meant for live stadium performances. Harris, by the way, lays down the law - as usual - with some of his career's sharpest bass licks; from the intro to the aforementioned 'The Red And The Black' to the rhythmic fills of 'Shadows Of The Valley'.\n\n\"The three amigos\", Murray, Smith and Gers, also make some of their greatest performances. There is no single point that stands out in my mind as subpar. From the calm, folky intro of the epic title track by Gers, to the melodic Murray solos of melancholic 'The Man Of Sorrows', to the rhythmic drive of 'When The River Runs Deep'. One of Smith's high lights is 'Death Or Glory', a fast heavy metal kicker dealing with the, to Maiden, familiar subject of aerial combat. He wrote the song along with Dickinson, and it has some incredible riffs driven to the max. Actually, 'Death Or Glory' would be the ideal album opener, but it stands as a great mid album track that actually opens the album's second disc.\n\n'Tears Of A Clown' is a melodic song bringing up the horrible subject of depression. More precisely, it's been stated that it is about comedian Robin Williams, who suffered from depression and tragically committed suicide. Dickinson gives a great performance with a lot of empathy for the part. In fact, even noting age and ailments, Dickinson makes one of his best records ever. And speaking of... we have to talk about the Dickinson penned concluding epic, 'Empire Of The Clouds'. Beginning with Maidens first ever piano intro (played by Dickinson), it stretches eighteen long minutes and basically redefines what epic is. I daresay it may in the future be deemed Maiden's magnum opus. It slowly builds into an explosion and carries some fantastic guitar harmonies and lengthy solos. It's impossible for me to give it justice with mere mortal words.\n\nA few small weaknesses can be found on The Book Of Souls, if you want to look. 'Speed Of Light', the album's lead single, wasn't accepted with open arms but is actually the obvious choice of a single. Dickinson does sound strained in the chorus and the song could have been sped up just a notch. I do however love the guitar leads throughout the songs, which were teased before the song's release. 'The Great Unknown' feels like a track from Maiden's 2006 album A Matter Of Life And Death; dark, and almost dystopic in its sound. After a few listens, it doesn't quite want to engage me, but I've no doubt an upswing might be coming\n\nNicko McBrain, the ever steadfast drummer, doesn't fault, but the drum sound at times sound odd to me. For example in 'When The River Runs Deep', which is actually a great track. I can't quite put my finger on it, and it's not a big thing at all. In fact, my only real \"complaint\" would be the artwork, done by Mark Wilkinson. Maiden have always had great artwork, defining what a metal album cover should look like, with only a few exceptions (*cough* Dance Of Death). In this case, Eddie has become a voodoo shaman against a black background, and it feels incomplete. The booklet however has several awesome illustrations by Wilkinson that would have made a much cooler album cover.\n\nTitle track 'The Book Of Souls', debating the fall of the Mayans, quickly becomes one of my favorites. It begins with a signature Gers guitar melody before bursting into a Gers/Harris penned behemoth. As a team, the two have written some of the greatest Maiden songs; 'Dream Of Mirrors', 'Dance Of Death' and 'The Talisman' all spring to mind, and again on The Book Of Souls they give two of the best tracks; the title track and 'Shadows Of The Valley'. The latter of the two is an emotive tale that begins in an intro reminiscent of Wasted Years from 1986 classic Somewhere In Time, before exploding into a cavalcade of what makes Maiden what it is. Almost symphonic in its chorus, alongside great guitar work by the three guitarists and an insane bass line. It should easily become a favorite of fans of both old and new Maiden albums.\n\nThe entire album is so total, so complete. Granted, a few of the opening tracks feel a bit like build up for the rest of the album, but shouldn't be thrown off just because of that. The creepy ending of opening track 'If Eternity Should Fail' might be the eeriest Maiden moment ever; atmospheric and dark. From there we're led through one of Maidens most completed and varied works and through three of their now six in total songs at over ten minutes in length, and through the magnificent closure that is 'Empire Of The Clouds'. It is simply above all expectations. In fact, I think a friend of mine put it best, in a one word review upon his first listen. And I quote: \"MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMHH\"\n\nStandout tracks: The Book Of Souls, Shadows Of The Valley, Empire Of The Clouds\n\nOriginally written for 'getmetal.com'\n",
        "\nI could open this with what an amazing achievement it is for a band to have managed sticking around for 40 years, but I\u2019d rather not. While it\u2019s certainly worth acknowledging, the more impressive achievement is the fact that Iron Maiden is one of the few historically significant bands that is actually still releasing solid albums. Bands like Black Sabbath and Judas Priest have brilliant discographies, but undoubtedly reached their creative sell-by dates long ago, putting out completely mediocre albums in their autumnal years.\n\nIron Maiden, it must be said, even from an objective standpoint, is a different kettle of fish. While one cannot ignore the fact that Maiden\u2019s 80s releases will forever be seen as the zenith of the band\u2019s creative output, and rightfully so, they\u2019ve written some exceptional songs in recent years.\n\nHaving watched the \u2018Speed of Light\u2019 video when it dropped, I was utterly disappointed\u2026 but none too surprised. You see, every lead single Maiden has released in the last 12 or so years has been weak, with \u2018El Dorado\u2019 arguably taking the cake as the nadir of new-millennium Maiden\u2019s work. \u2018Speed of Light\u2019, I felt, followed hot on the heels of that musical abortion. Still, I picked up the annoyingly oversized deluxe edition of The Book of Souls.\n\nBeyond the beautiful artwork and layout, what TBoS is to me is a complete Iron Maiden cocktail, with the kitchen sink added in for good measure. There are brief hints of Di\u2019Anno-era Maiden; a smattering of early to mid-80s Maiden; a glint of the magical, synthesised Maiden of the later 80s; some clich\u00e9d rocking 90s Maiden touches; and a huge helping of the greying, modern Maiden \u2013 and it\u2019s actually damn near perfect.\n\nAs much as I enjoy large parts of the previous post-Brave New World albums, there were a good number of throwaway tracks on every album. The Final Frontier unquestionably displayed a marked downturn in quality, particularly in Bruce\u2019s vocal delivery, leading me to worry about whether Maiden could ever rekindle the spark that has kept them as engaging as they have been over the years. Bruce\u2019s vocals on TFF are so bad and strained that parts of the album still make me cringe.\n\nTBoS, however, allays any fears I had about Bruce\u2019s voice being worn out. There\u2019s no question that he does strain here and there but, for the most part, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s sounded this good since Dance of Death, or perhaps even BNW. He\u2019s not doing anything new, but he\u2019s just doing it better than on the last few \u2013 with more conviction and control \u2013 and that\u2019s exactly how I feel about the music as well.\n\nFrom a compositional side, Maiden isn\u2019t doing anything completely different to what they\u2019ve done in the past \u2013 everything is just slightly more on point than it\u2019s been in recent times; it\u2019s done more intelligently and with more consideration (even though many of the songs took less time to write and were rather spontaneous, apparently). Interestingly, the music, as Maiden-esque as it is, and as familiar as some parts are, very rarely feels contrived.\n\nThe tracks are, in fact, so well written that each one is itself accessible without being dimensionally lacking \u2013 it\u2019s an impressive accomplishment, and shows how expertly the band has refined its craft over the last few years, since continually penning songs that are rarely shorter than five minutes. While there is a fair bit of repetition, the passages themselves are generally lengthy and don\u2019t suffer from the same obvious, grinding repetition of an album like BNW (which, though a great album, is almost sickeningly repetitive).\n\nThe album is bookended by two brilliant tracks, and there\u2019s a lot of magic that happens in-between. As much of a stinker as \u2018Speed of Light\u2019 is as a single track, it somehow follows on perfectly from the opener, \u2018If Eternity Should Fail\u2019, which is Maiden\u2019s best opening track since the astounding \u2018The Wicker Man\u2019. Another personal highlight has to be \u2018The Red and the Black\u2019, which just has everything you could want from Maiden contained in a 13-minute epic that rolls by in no time. The 18-minute closer, the super-duper-epic-awesome-amazeballs-best-song-ever-written-true-masterpiece \u2018Empire of the Clouds\u2019 is, actually, pretty awesome. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the greatest Maiden song ever written or a masterpiece, as many seem to, but is really is quite brilliant \u2013 Bruce really knocked it out the park here.\n\nAs you can guess by the track lengths, this isn\u2019t necessarily an instant-gratification-type album for the average listener, but I personally loved it on first listen and, on listen number 15, perhaps, I like it even better.\n\nI quite like the production of the album \u2013 it\u2019s pretty stripped down and, thankfully, not over-produced, giving the album a more live sort of vibe. Listen to TBoS on some decent speakers or headphones and you can understand exactly why they went for this more immediate production approach. Musically, it\u2019s Maiden \u2013 these guys have their chops waxed and it\u2019s a pleasure to listen to the band\u2019s journeyman abilities at work. The guitar solos are always apposite to the songs, never feeling out of place, and, let\u2019s face it, most guitarists couldn\u2019t come up with one solo in their career as effective as a \u2018throwaway\u2019 Maiden one.\n\nAs much as I\u2019ve only been singing its praises until now, there is one very big problem with the album, and one or two minor ones. Yup, you guessed it \u2013 the big problem is, in fact, the very bigness of the album. It\u2019s simply too long to comfortably listen through in one sitting, unless it\u2019s on as partially background music. Focusing on the album from start to finish is a large ask, and probably a bit too much for most listeners, no matter how concerted their efforts may be.\n\nThe other smaller issues are also mostly tied to length and musical plodding \u2013 some of the parts of a few of the songs carrying on a bit too long \u2013 and the fact that the second last track \u2018The Man of Sorrows\u2019 is the closest song on TBoS to being one of those many filler tracks that Maiden have recorded over the course of their last four albums. Why it stands out here more than on the last few releases, I suspect, is directly tied to the album length. When the band doesn\u2019t sound particularly inspired or powerful, here, it kind of stands out. That said, it\u2019s actually a pretty interesting track, but there\u2019s a two-minute downtempo intro that drags far too much for its placing on the track listing, and the track itself is very mid-tempo. The title track also tends to lose momentum with its mid-paced, repetitious approach, but it\u2019s still satisfying enough not to be too bothersome.\n\nThe one advantage of this being a double album, however, is that you can digest it quite easily one disc (or two sides) at a time, allowing you to take in the songs quite comfortably without the sonic colossus that is the full album looming over you. While there is absolutely nothing mediocre recorded on here (as a single, 'The Speed of Light' is the closest it gets here), all of it together just gets to be a bit much on early sittings \u2013 the very scope of the album exceeds easy digestion. That said, once you\u2019ve taken the time to become acquainted with everything on offer, this becomes much less of an issue, and if you\u2019re going to be listening to any one album for over 90 minutes, it should really be this one.\n\nBefore hearing anything from it, I was expecting this to be a solid Iron Maiden release, much like TFF (which was pretty solid, all things said). The Book of Souls undeniably exceeded those expectations, delivering something to the quality last seen (among the band\u2019s studio releases and, possibly, The X Factor) in Seventh Son of a Seventh Son. This would be an absolute triumph for any band, let alone one that has already produced so much quality material over the span of more than three decades.\n\nStill not short on ideas, Maiden isn\u2019t a band resting on its laurels and legacy, like too many others relying solely on their \u2018golden era\u2019 albums. This is a band that still wants a creative outlet, still wants to give something new to the fans, and still blows almost any other metal band around right out of the water. Up the Irons.\n",
        "\nHere we have the last true Iron Maiden album ever released. Iron Maiden ceased to be Iron Maiden after Bruce Dickinson returned. What they've become since Blaze's sad dismissal isn't Maiden. It's shit.\n\nThere are two reasons this album is dismissed: the first is this was the first digital recording Maiden ever did. They finally made the transition from tapes and some people couldn't seem to handle that. The other is that Blaze was still in the band. The actual problems with this album are the lyrics are painfully dumb and the songs aren't 100% there.\n\nThis should've been Maiden's rebirth. Gone are the hard rock riffs that plagued them from 'No Prayer for the Dying' through 'The X-Factor' (ironically injected after Gers joined the fray). There is only pure heavy metal in these songs. The energy levels were the highest they'd been since 'Powerslave'. There was passion and dare it be said, FUN, once more. This album actually sounded like a fucking Iron Maiden album. Not one of the bands post-Blaze releases sound like Maiden. At best they sound like bad B-sides from Bruce's solo career.\n\nThe production is great. The music is tight. The distortion in the guitars is wet and heavy. The leads are adventurous and lively. Passion abounds and purpose is once again felt. There is still the rawness of yore with a renewed ambition which is why the stupid lyrics and semi-repetitive song writing are such downers.\n\nBlaze's voice is lazer focused on this release. It's tighter than Bruce's ever was. This is no different from Ripper outclassing Halford on every front. The newer version is far better at the job. His voice still doesn't fit the music, not completely anyway, but it's far more confident than it was on 'The X-Factor'. The songs ultimately suffer from the same thing that plagues them now and that's they have a few good ideas that keep repeating themselves instead of either ending in a logical place or being worked harder to flesh out their wannabe \"progressive\" attitude. \n\nIron Maiden has never been a progressive metal band. They will never be a progressive metal band. The closest they came to being almost prog was between 'Somewhere in Time' and 'Seventh Son of a Seventh Son'. This hasn't stopped them from calling themselves prog (kinda like how Paradise Lost calls themselves \"Gothic\" when there's absolutely nothing \"Gothic\" about their sound) and they do try. First with the 70's Who inspired 'The Angel and the Gambler'. This is a good but too long song. It's about ten minutes long. It should've been four minutes at best. 'The Clansman' (the third song to have the minor scale introduced to us in: Losfer Words (Big 'Orra) and then later as the intro to 'Wasted Years') is the bands second foray into wannabe progdom. It too is a good song but should've been about four minutes instead of the nine they gave us. The lyrics are what ultimately make these songs boring.\n\nSpeaking of lyrics those two songs are probably the most noticeable offenders with the last song 'Como Estais Amigos' being the worst. Words cannot describe how dumb the concept is.\n\nThis is far from a perfect album. In all truth it's a good album but considering they stopped making Iron Maiden music with this album you'd think they'd have left us with a better taste in our mouths. \n\nRIP Iron Maiden.\n",
        "\nI first wrote a review of this album a couple of days after it was released, but decided to wait because I felt something was happening - The Book of Souls was growing on me.\nThe more I listened to this massive undertaking of a double album, the more counterarguments I found to the things I initially objected to. \n\nLike many other metalheads, I've been following Iron Maiden since I was young, and their early material is so ingrained in my being that you could play the songs with a jack between my brain and the stereo receiver. This makes reviewing a new Maiden album a somewhat difficult proposition, because you've got to view the new album on its own merits, and not compare it too much with whatever the band wrote thirty years ago. I had some issues with the album on the first rounds of listening, and those issues are pretty much those you can read about in the reviews that rate the album at 50% or lower. I'll present some of those issues here along with why I've changed my mind. What is all boils down to, is that as of now, I consider The Book of Souls the best thing Iron Maiden has recorded this side of Seventh Son of a Seventh Son.\n\nBefore the release, I was somewhat hyped by the band's statements about how creative they felt, and I came to expect an adventurous, energetic album. When I finally got to hear it, I didn't find it all that adventurous - it was still Iron Maiden, through and through - and I thought the album lacked the spark I hoped for. The length of some of these tunes was also worrying, but I told myself that the band made long tunes as far back as their debut album (\"Phantom of the Opera\"). \n\nWhen I first began to listen to Iron Maiden around the time of Powerslave they were what I thought of as \"dangerous\". It was something different than what you heard on the radio, and artwork like the cover of The Number of the Beast featuring the devil was something people around me didn't like (so I liked it all the more). This was a band that played fast and hard, singing about topics that, at the time, seemed very controversial (I discovered more extreme metal soon after, no worries). This edge was something I hoped to find, but didn't. However, as I gave the album more spins, I began to realize that it was one of those unfair expectations I had. I focused on the music at hand, instead, realizing that I cannot expect that kind of semi-controversial edge from musicians that are rapidly approaching their sixties. I mistook the generally slow tempo of the songs on The Book of Souls for a band of elderly rock musicians not having the drive to sound explosive, when that's not really what this album is about. What we have is a collection of songs that hew closer to material like \"To Tame a Land\", \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\", and \"Alexander the Great\", and I've always loved those songs, haven't I? Once I started to think about the songs in this context, I began to appreciate the work for what it is.\n\nThat being said, I feel that the production of the album would benefit from a heavier, fuzzier guitar tone and a better balance between the various instruments. The guitars are drowned out by the vocals, and the synthesizers are buried pretty deep - this too, however, becomes less important as I listen more, because I get used to the mix as it is, and the details emerge to become clearer. As an example, I didn't even notice the synthesizers backing up the verses of \"The Great Unknown\", but once I did, it added to the fullness of the sound and now I can't unhear them. In that sense, the production actually adds longevity to the songs as there's more to discover. \n\nMy main complaint in my first attempt at a review was that there was nothing new under the sun. In most songs you can hear echoes of earlier material, sometimes to the point of feeling like they plagiarized themselves (the worst offender being the introductory guitar melody of \"Shadows of the Valley\" - it hews very, very close to the opening of \"Wasted Years\"). Listening to \"The Red and the Black\", the only song penned solely by Steve Harris, I thought the opening riffs sounded like they came straight from Killers, the chugging riff before the verse made me sing the lines of \"Quest for Fire\", and the vocal lines reminded me of \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\". Yet, right now, \"The Red and the Black\" has sailed up as a favorite! Somewhere along the line, I went from frowning disapprovingly at what I heard, to singing along and feeling a genuine rush of love for the band. It's a hymn, all right, and I'm pretty sure it will slot in nicely on the band's setlist. It's long, yes; the second longest track on offer, in fact, but even as it is brimming with callbacks to older material, it has grown into a song I really enjoy listening to. I've complained loudly about their long songs on the last four or five albums being too stretched out, with too little variation, but on this album I feel the long tracks are sufficiently varied to maintain interest. The last half of \"The Red and the Black\" has many different parts, often supported by synthesizers, including one especially memory guitar harmony that is as classic Iron Maiden as it gets without being a direct rip-off of earlier material; it's a part that is reminiscent of a part in Opeth's \"In Mist she was Standing\" (Orchid, 1994), a simple but effective melody that gives me the feels all over, in the same way their guitar harmonies did on the first seven albums (the part starts at 09:40). I do wish they had more of these parts spread across the two discs, but I'm pretty happy with this one. It reminds me of all those guitar harmony parts from their older days that I cherish, like, for example, the part that begins at 02:28 in \"The Duellists\".\n\nWhile a song like \"The Red and the Black\" can be considered a \"safe\" song in the sense that it is Iron Maiden through and through, the band does actually sound genuinely fresh elsewhere - something I failed to hear because I was so hanged up on the tempo of the songs. I wanted some kick-ass flurry of galloping Maiden, and a song like \"If Eternity Should Fail\", which kicks off the album, is building up rather slowly, turning into a great tune with some solid hooks that you may have missed on the first spin. Yes, you *can* go through each song and pick out the references to earlier material, but it is (with the possible exceptions of \"The Red and the Black\" and \"Shadows of the Valley\") never as unimaginative as what you get from, say, AC/DC or Slayer. \n\nThe energy is kicked up a notch in shorter bursts like \"When the River Runs Deep\" and \"Death or Glory\", with hard-rocking riffs. I prefer Maiden when they lean closer to metal (which is why \"2 Minutes to Midnight\" is my least favorite Powerslave track). Fortunately the songs do include more 'metallic' parts to keep me interested. \n\nAnother thing that I at first complained about was Bruce's vocals which I found too strained and grating. Many spins later, that problem too has disappeared, and at times I think he sounds great. Many - not all - vocal lines employed on the album sound fresh as well. There's no doubt it's Maiden, but I don't find myself remembering other songs as much as I do when listening to other post-Blaze works such as Dance of Death. \n\nThe Book of Souls, then, is a two-sided affair in more than one way. It is both new and old, it both invents and borrows. The album is a tad too predictable, perhaps, with no instrument standing out. The guitar solos just kind of drift by, and at no point do I raise my eyebrow in surprise at the drumwork. I kind of miss Steve's galloping bass, and at times the songs are a little too soft for my liking - but then again, these days I have Nile to satisfy my taste for the heavier, faster stuff. \n\nIron Maiden managed to turn me completely around with this one. The album truly needed some time to sink in, and now I can appreciate it for what it is. Yes, it could benefit from being more dynamic; yes, it is a bit long; yes, there's stuff you've heard them do better before. \nYes, it is predictable and many breaks and hooks you can see coming from a mile's distance, but Maiden has been around since the seventies, and it is a testimony to the durability of the genre that they can release a double album in 2015 with the essence of the early eighties largely intact. The Book of Souls takes the listener through all the Maiden nuances, from the slightly staccato riffs of the earliest albums, through the melodious epics and to the 'new' Maiden, which mixes hard rock, heavy metal, and acoustic instruments into one delectable whole.\n\nI am very glad I gave this album a few more chances. Up the irons!\nOh, one final addendum - I had hoped the album's themes - most notable in the interior artwork - were more cohesive. There's no place on the album where the Mayan/Aztec influence of the artwork is represented sonically. Just an intro, like Exodus' \"Pleasures of the Flesh\", to give a song a \"jungle\"-feeling, would be nice. Most Maiden albums have some thematic link between art and music / lyrics, but I can't really find it on his one except for the lyrics of the title track.\n",
        "\nSince reuniting in 2000, and actually going back earlier than that, Iron Maiden has been heavily into the writing of epics. In the classic days they nailed it a few times but they also swung and missed on duds now and then. Nowadays \u201cepic\u201d song writing turned into long and drawn out songs with a lot of repetition and little in the way of progressive song writing despite that label being applied to them. Well that all comes to a pinnacle on Book of Souls.\n\nThe apex of that is the 18 plus minute song \u201cEmpire of the Clouds\u201d. A solo Dickinson number that starts off with a couple minutes of piano and orchestration before Bruce comes in with his tale of the airship R101. This goes on and on with the rest of the band throwing in an occasional part in the background to let you know they are there until around the 7 minute mark where we get a jumble of mediocre instrumental pieces slapped together that drags on and on and on until the song gets to the crash section where Bruce comes through with a very strained tone over a bit more hectic music before going back to the piano that started it all. The music is competently played, but not very interesting in any way. Guitar solos are there but have no real weight or emotion behind them to lift this piece of music to any heights or stick with you for much after that song has ended. I found myself constantly looking at the running time thinking this song must be nearing the end only to find there were a few songs worth of music left to go.\n\nOther long meandering tracks include \u201cThe Red and the Black\u201d. The music is by the numbers later Maiden and then you get the \u201cWhoah, whoah\u201d bits that just make me cringe. Harris must have been thinking of crowd chants with this one, but it just doesn\u2019t work. With a 4 or 5 minute running time this could possibly be somewhat fun. Unfortunately its 13 minutes long. This is a problem with a lot of the material. The intro number \u201cIf Eternity Should Fail\u201d has some good things going on but they left about 3 minutes of fat on it that desperately needed trimming. Long and repetitive doesn\u2019t equal epic and progressive guys! This band really needs a producer who can get them to realize this, or new blood in the songwriting department. Oh Martin Birch we need you more than ever.\n\nThere are a couple shorter by the numbers rockers here as well like \u201cDeath or Glory\u201d and \u201cSpeed of Light\u201d which would fit on older Maiden albums. Speed of Light, as I\u2019ve heard mentioned many times, would fit on No Prayer for the Dying fairly well. \u201cTears of a Clown\u201d is a highlight, a mid tempo song about Robin Williams that fits well in Bruce\u2019s vocal range and does not outstay its welcome. The riffs are not amazing but the tune comes together well. The best tune is \u201cWhen the River Runs Deep\u201d, which has a very pleasing flow to the chorus and moves as quick as we expect from Maiden these days during the verses, though it could use a bit of trimming as well.\n\nAs I\u2019ve said Bruce sounds very strained at times, but other times is very powerful when not trying to hit higher notes. Being the air raid siren for all these years took a toll but he puts on a good performance. Nicko moves along predictably with little energy or power, which is disappointing for such a great drummer. Maiden was never really a riff based band, the melodies and excellent songwriting were they keys, but they always had interesting guitar work. On this one everything is played decently enough but there just isn\u2019t any fire or passion in the playing. I don\u2019t expect Maiden to push the envelope anymore but this is too bland and inoffensive, a major sin when you have so many long tracks. The production is a typical Kevin Shirley hack job with everything sounding lifeless and overly muffled, but what really surprises me is how low Harris is in the mix.\n\nIn the end if you thought the last few albums, The Final Frontier in particular, were great energetic Maiden albums you will probably enjoy this. For me it was all of the things that I disliked about those albums and then some. You could have probably pulled 8-10 solid 4-5 minute tunes from this but as it is its just a bloated record that drags too often.\n",
        "\nWell, it's been five years since The Final Frontier, and I was beginning to think we may never again get a Maiden album. How wrong was I? Not only did we get a Maiden album, we got their best. Full of raw energy, passion and determination, this album is exceptional in every respect. \n\nThe album opens with \"If Eternity Should Fail\", a classic post-2000 track with everything you could want in a Maiden song. An atmospheric intro, a crunching riff, interwoven with the trademark Maiden gallop. From here on, the album goes above and beyond. \"The Red and The Black\" is full of brilliant musical intricacies that delight the ear, and please the mind. Harris is on top form here, showcasing his trademark gallop, and his tricky digits, fiddling around with his bass, like some kind of ordered madman! The first half of the double album is crammed full of juicy epics, oozing with creativity, interspersed with two shorter, punchy songs that hark back to the Maiden of old, while still standing tall on their own merits. The title track, \"The Book of Souls\", begins with a delightfully full and meaty riff, that Bruce's vocals cut through like a knife through butter. A powerful chorus follows, the kind that will make you want to belt the words out loud whilst doing some form of tribal war dance. It's that good. This isn't to discount the ferocity and melodic greatness of the previous tracks, which are good enough to warrant shelfspace with their best. \n\nThe musicianship is exceptional, and played with an energy not to be expected from any band, let alone one that is on their way to retirement age. The vocal performance by Bruce Dickinson is his best, and perhaps the best in metal full stop. Age adds a certain something to his voice that makes it perfect for this record. He is still hitting all of the notes he used to, and in many ways they sound better with age. \n\nThe second half leans more towards shorter songs, with \"Death or Glory\" being a prime example, that combine that classic Iron Maiden sound with progressive-slanted music. Maiden truly reach their musical peak on this disk, beating out anything they've ever produced. The greatest chorus Iron Maiden have ever created is to be found on, \"When The River Runs Deep\", an inspiring, heavy, melodic, and downright sexy track that incorporates some of the greatest riffs of all time. This is Maiden at their most creative, and that shines through on the last track. \"Empire of the Clouds\", an 18 minute long epic of mammoth proportions. It starts as a piano driven orchestral track before launching into over 7 minutes of instrumental riffing and solos. I am speechless. This is the finest album Iron Maiden, and indeed any metal band, have ever produced.\n",
        "\nAn extended hiatus can often be a troubling sign, particularly if it's a longstanding metal institution that has generally kept a certain rhythm to their output. This was particularly the case for one of metal's favorite forefathers Iron Maiden, who had maintained a strong presence throughout the new millennium with the reunification of the classic 1980s lineup that defined their widely lauded sound. But the passage of five years has not been marked by any kind of slump, or even a scaled back quantity of content, as their newly unleashed The Book Of Souls contains about five years worth of masterful songwriting, and manages to eclipse everything that they've accomplished since Adrian Smith first parted ways with the band at the close of the 1980s. Ambition defines every moment of this extended opus, drawing heavily upon the greatness of Maiden's past and packaging it in a massive collection of compositions that bears a fair degree of similarity to the epic and progressive character of A Matter Of Life And Death. \n\nNaturally the throwback elements to days long past is obscured by a production quality that is more in keeping with where this band has been since Brave New World, having more of a smooth, hard rocking character to the guitars that is a bit less crunchy and high-end as their classic albums in Number Of The Beast and Powerslave, but it's a foregone conclusion that anybody seeking a sound like that should go to bands more interested in paying homage to the past such as White Wizzard and Striker, as Maiden has had their flag planted in a forward looking direction ever since their inception. This is made abundantly clear right at the album's very onset with the ambitious epic \"If Eternity Should Fail\", which was originally written for a future Dickinson solo album, and showcases a darker and more progressive side of Maiden, even when compared to their previous couple albums, using heavy amounts of keyboards to accomplish a dreary atmosphere and the closing things off with an even drearier droning acoustic guitar line at the end that's a tiny bit reminiscent of a Viking metal song out of Bathory's early 90s experiments.\n\nWhile the inherent nods to past greatness may not manifest in a retro-sounding production, they do jump out in an obvious fashion at the listener in several other ways. Chief among these is a ratcheted up tempo factor, which while maybe note quite as fast as some of the more power metal-like moments on Somewhere In Time and Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son, are definitely a cut above the generally grooving and mid-paced character of the previous two albums. Such fun-filled cruisers as the Deep Purple infused single \"Speed Of Light\" and the flashy \"When The River Runs Deep\" definitely point to a revitalized sense of energy, particularly in the latter case which occasionally exhibits that semi-speed metal feel that permeated Powerslave, particularly on \"Back In The Village\" and \"Aces High\". On a similar note, the shuffling rocker \"Death Or Glory\" also manages to make a few overt nods to the 1980s, though with a bit more of that jazzy variety that was more a staple of the early 80s with Clive Burr at the kit.\n\nHowever, despite a healthy collection of moderate length cruisers and rockers, The Book Of Souls spends most of its time reminding everyone why Maiden are the undisputed masters of the metal epic, unveiling a massive collection of songs the break the six minute mark and then some, with a surprisingly varied collection of songwriting credits among the Maiden crew, rather than Steve Harris taking all or most of the glory. On the humbler end of things are a couple of strong yet relatively by the numbers longer songs in \"The Great Unknown\" that showcases Harris and Smith recreating a somewhat subdued recreation of an early 90s Maiden atmospheric epic with a high climax point, while Dave Murray reverts back to his more sorrowful mode of balladry with an auspicious guitar solo right at the beginning with \"The Man Of Sorrows\", having some comparability to \"Still Life\" and \"Deja Vu\", though staying more on the subdued side than the climax points of said classics. Keyboards play a supportive role and provide additional atmosphere, but guitar and bass work is primarily where these songs get their power, along with a masterful set of vocal performances out of Dickinson.\n\nSurprisingly enough, it wasn't simply enough for Maiden to simply write a great album, but they saw fit to take the opportunity to engage in what can be described as a three person war over who could write the most ambitious song in the style, each one generally outdoing their own past works in the process. The haunting and mystical title song \"The Book Of Souls\" chronicles the mysterious fall of the Mayan Empire, and showcases Janick Gers' and Harris' ability to merge world music ideas into their formula and come out with a winner that would be the album's zenith were it not for two other colossal epics along for the ride. Harris sets out on his own to one-up his former longest work \"Rime Of The Ancient Mariner\" with a similarly ambitious and generally grooving number, though it kicks off with a virtuoso acoustic bass intro that points to an obscure number he presented during the Blaze Bayley years in \"Blood On The World's Hands\", arguably the beginning of Maiden's foray into a more progressive sound. But surprisingly enough, and even by Harris' own admission, it's Bruce Dickinson who ends up carrying the day with a massive musical opera unto itself in \"Empire Of The Clouds\", which manages to incorporate Dickinson's own classical music inclinations in with a metallic assault that also leans heavily in the Powerslave direction for most of its duration.\n\nIt might be a bit presumptive to put this on equal footing with albums put out by this band when heavy metal music was on top of the world, but if there is a single album from Maiden's post-80s output that truly holds its torch high to the glory days of the NWOBHM when the style was hungry and clawing its way to the top of the mountain, this would be the one. It's chock full of every single thing that everyone who loves metal craves, from the flashy guitar solos and innovative songwriting to the exaggerated vocal work and lack of lyrical boundaries. It's an album that will make you think and bang your head at the same time, and often cause one to get completely lost in the moment so that its long duration seems far too short. More than 35 years down the road, and with no signs of slowing down, Iron Maiden has done it yet again. Here's to hoping that it's not the end of the road, but come what may, they've built a towering monument that will sure to be burning up everyone's speakers for years to come.\n",
        "\nIt's been five years since we last heard any new music from Iron Maiden, and now they're back with The Book of Souls, a 92-minute double album bigger and more colossal than anything they've ever done. Everyone pretty much already knows what they think of modern Maiden, and this album doesn't have any surprises \u2013 except, of course, for its leviathan-sized runtime. I think Maiden is one of the few old warhorses of the scene still putting out first rate music, and The Book of Souls is more exemplary material from metal's elder statesmen.\n\nThis is just a huge feast of music, and the old adage of \u201cless is more\u201d doesn't apply here \u2013 it's just Maiden making up for the years of absence with more new music than they've ever doled out. The songs are all classic-styled and upbeat, and does there need to be a very in depth explanation of what they sound like? The old formula of galloping, rocking riffs, crunching basslines and Bruce Dickinson's seemingly unstoppable powerhouse of a voice is in full force here. Dickinson, by the way, has to take the prize for the best sounding vocal performance ever given by a man with throat cancer on this.\n\nThe whole band sounds lively and invigorated, and the songs are catchy and resonant, as well as lyrically brilliant \u2013 weaving tales of apocalyptic intrigue, outerspace travel, moral quandries and Mayan mythology. Opener \u201cIf Eternity Should Fail\u201d is a big, pounding anthem initially meant for Dickinson's side project, and it shows \u2013 he reaches into his midrange a bit more than usual and the lyrics are delightfully obscure and twisted. Great, heart-pounding excitement \u2013 an immediately pleasing song. Advance single \u201cSpeed of Light\u201d sees the band unabashedly excited like they haven't been since at least \u201cThe Wicker Man,\u201d and \u201cThe Great Unknown\u201d sees a more pensive Maiden with brooding lyrics about mankind's future set over trudging riffs and melodious leads. The title track is a militaristic march with a cinematic flourish, with a proggier opening riff and some atmospheric keys opening up a 10-minute serpentine coil about the demise of the Mayans \u2013 a tremendous song.\n\n\u201cThe Red and the Black\u201d is a delirious 14 minutes of classic-styled twin-axe Maiden guitars penned by Steve Harris alone. The first half of the song sees Dickinson belting out some bizarre lines and lyrics either about mental illness or just the general malaise and confusion of life. The second half is just a long, rumbling instrumental slice of heaven for anyone who loves Maiden at their most long winded. The way the whole thing plays out is just great \u2013 sweet build-ups and hey, they even throw in a \u201cwoah-oh-oh\u201d chorus for old time's sakes. This song is pretty much everything Maiden is about, recalling classic tracks like \u201cHeaven Can Wait\u201d and the Seventh Son title track, and it's so excessive and over the top that it's practically a revelation. A brilliant song.\n\nThe second disc opens up in fine form with \u201cDeath or Glory,\u201d a charging, headstrong rocker with a shout-along chorus \u2013 sure to be fun live, and an instantly memorable, blood-pumping-good song. Then \u201cShadows of the Valley\u201d opens up as the band's classic \u201cWasted Years\u201d before digging into a rollicking riff and a powerhouse vocal performance \u2013 one of the album's most climactic moments that builds the most intensity. \u201cTears of a Clown\u201d is a midpaced rock anthem with a catchy bass-line, special for the band, as it's a lyrical tribute to Robin Williams that ends up one of the album's more honest and heartfelt odes.\n\nBut the real attraction is \u201cEmpire of the Clouds,\u201d an 18-minute epic. The opening pianos are heart-rending, and Dickinson's balladesque retelling of the R101 disaster is so good that you could swear he was right there in the midst of it when it was happening. This is easily the best song on the album. The band weaves a story in their traditional epic style, only done to its fullest extreme, and the whole thing is a spellbinding, extremely memorable experience. They kick into the galloping guitar runs and harmonies later on, and then after that Dickinson comes back in \u2013 the song as a whole is a rock opera epic. It's a spacious song that takes its time developing and is actually better for it.\n\nFighting the wind as it rolls you, feeling the beams as they push you along\nWatching the channel below you, lower and lower into the night\nLights are passing below you, northern france asleep in their beds\nStorm is raging around you, a million to one, that's what he said\n\nReaper standing beside you, wind inside cuts to the bone\nPanicked to make a decision, experienced men asleep in their graves\nHer cover is ripped and she's flooding, rain is flooding into the hull\nBleeding to death and she's falling, lifting gas is draining away\n\nWhen I got into Maiden over a decade ago now, what attracted me to them was how they told these stories through their music, and transported you to different worlds and took you on adventures. To hear them do something like this makes my heart swell.\n\nThese are just good songs, with strong, catchy hooks and really good riffs and solos. The vocals are almost scary good for a man nearing 60. They are all built on emotional crests and the band's oft-maligned repetition in the songwriting is integrated even more seamlessly, and so the songs feel about half as long as they really are \u2013 and frankly, even if the band chose to write shorter songs, I'm not sure I'd want them to. The longer lengths and repetition serve as a nice workout that makes me feel I've gotten my money's worth, giving the band a real presence. On the more epic tracks, I can get lost in their tapestries of sound \u2013 though perhaps not as much here as The Final Frontier, an album that flowed near-perfectly as a veritable heavy metal epic.\n\nAnd yeah \u2013 overall this is a more conventional and palatable Maiden album than they've done in a long time, with the band making the most references to their classic style in execution, arrangement and mood. I was expecting something a bit more experimental and epic, especially with the huge runtime announced earlier this year. By contrast, this is a more accessible set of songs than they've had in over a decade. But they're all so good that I can't really complain much.\n\nThe length is a bit of a tough sell, as how much time do any of us really have to sit down and listen to 92 minutes? It's unwieldy and weighty, and frankly it comes with all the flaws that would normally go with that length. It's just how it goes. The presentation of the copy I have is exquisite, a huge DVD-sized box with a book full of amazing pictures of Eddie doing things that look like a Romero interpretation of how the ancient Mayans lived - tons of blood and gore and badass poses, is all I can say. It's a fine packaging and a great little touch to add onto the album's experience.\n\nIt's just a kick ass album. Maiden is still a great band. Lyrically dense, musically ready and powerful, vocally outstanding \u2013 it's all good. They sound their age now, but they've weathered the storms well and they seem to have aged with grace. The songs here are too good to ignore, and I'm glad to see Maiden in such fine form in 2015.\n",
        "\nBefore any complaints, a brief word on the band's aging, and that pertaining to legacy. Iron Maiden are the only band of that age, aside from Saxon maybe, that have aged with grace. Where they could go the route that so many of their cohort have, and try their best to constantly burn as fast and bright as they did at 22, they've instead chosen a route that links their early identity (melodies carrying over riffing, the bass continuing to be a melodic presence, and tending towards the \"epic\" in their crafting of a song), while aging out of speed. Dudes are old. Dickinson is even showing age in a more palpable way here. But their reunion material has reflected a creative spark as bright as their early work, if not as impacting in some cases. Iron Maiden are the best at being an aged metal band. Bar none.\n\nThat said.\n\nThis album, beyond all of their later work, sounds tired. Not to the rehash jerk-off heights that Sabbath and Priest's new ones have been, but tired nonetheless. I'm not even referring to Dickinson so much in this. He was battling cancer, TONGUE CANCER, and sounds generally strong, if not uninterested, through most of this. But the compositions tend towards samey, and more sloppily put together than the past four. \"The Red and the Black\" in particular, is shockingly off in nearly every section shift. The production doesn't aid them here, as the digital cut ins are awkwardly un-finessed, but the writing before any recording is off in a way not generally present in Iron Maiden.\n\nLikewise, there are rehashing issues. Now, I don't really care if bands revisit good ideas, and I'm well aware that the \"Brave New World\" intro progression has been on every album, sometimes multiple times, since Brave New World came out. But there are moments that are near identical, save for a slight shift. The intro to \"Book of Souls\" is nearly the same as the intro to The Final Frontier's \"The Talisman.\" Much has been made of \"Shadows of the Valley\" straight up using the melody from \"Wasted Years,\" and while I agree, it's strange no one made much hay about them using it in The Final Frontier's \"Coming Home.\" In the title track, the tight fast section sounds an awful lot like \"Losfer Words.\" I have zero problems with bands revisiting material that is thematically relevant in later work (See Satan's \"Siege Mentality\"), but it feels kind of desperate at times here. For a band that has always been rife with ideas, even if they weren't the best, it's uncomfortable to hear some level of what appears to be barrel scraping, if not outright pandering.\n\nAlbum centerpiece\"Empire of the Clouds,\" while a noble effort (and an original one in the Maiden canon), doesn't work. The theatrical nature of the material and execution call for maybe more collaboration than is present here. The drama feels like a first draft, and Dickinson, so often a very talented lyricist, falls short. His love of the material is evident, his ability to convey that in a fashion that doesn't fall into history book material is not. This song maybe most clearly presents the underdone ideas of so much of the songwriting.\n\nThis is particularly noticeable when presented against the many great ideas on the record. \"If Eternity Should Fail\" is a fucking winner. Evoking elements of Dickinson's \"The Chemical Wedding\" album (possibly due to the apparent contributions of Roy Z.), it combines vague elements of the arcane in its lyrics, with the straight ahead, aggressive stomp in it's composition. This is some heart wrenching shit. Album single \"Speed of Light\" bounces around without evoking much annoyance, and grows over time. Likewise, \"The Great Unknown\" and \"When the River Runs Deep\" pack a good amount of punch and substance, while not sinking back into the territory that other recent-ish Maiden rockers (\"Wildest Dreams,\" \"Different World,\" \"The Pilgrim\") have, as tracks rarely to be revisited.\n\nSpecial mention should be made of the title track, where Steve Harris has fun for the first time in maybe 25 years. His supporting melody in the main riff not only sells the general pomp of the section, but adds an element of danger to it that isn't present in most Iron Maiden outside of the Seventh Son of a Seventh Son album. This is undercut by an underdone production, unfortunately. As that big lumbering riff repeats, it is eventually followed by what I can only assume is Janick Gers' guitar, something that would have had near nuclear effect if pushed up a notch in the mix.\n\nScattered around that are nifty movements here and there, but the record as a whole feels kind of like a less aimed, but heavier Kansas album. This isn't a derision by a long shot, but it lacks, as an entity, the contemplative edge that Iron Maiden has instilled to make up for it's slower nature on the past recent albums. There are cool \"look at that\" sections in syncopation and melodic play (and counter play), but few can live up to the standards set up on the past four albums. There are victories to be had here, but harder fought than the gallows point-of-view of The Final Frontier, the cold war torn perspective of A Matter of Life and Death, the oddly celebratory take on Dance of Death, and the all out fucking hammer of Brave New World. This isn't to say any band is nailed to their past work, but in viewing these last albums as a mindset expanded upon, which, looking at the recurring motifs on the whole set, seems fair, The Book of Souls seems the least realized.\n\nIron Maiden is, has been, and will be, great. This one, unfortunately, is merely good.\n",
        "\nMuch has been made about Iron Maiden's decision to make their sixteenth studio effort a double album. The five year gap between this and The Final Frontier along with Bruce Dickinson's recent health scare lead one to theorize that the band felt the need to demonstrate their refusal to back down in the face of old age. On the other hand, over ninety minutes of music gives a lot of fuel for people who believe that the band's \"progressive era\" has grown more self indulgent with each successive release. The answer seems to be somewhere between these two ideas but The Book Of Souls manages to be an enjoyable listen either way.\n\nFor the most part, The Book Of Souls doesn't stray too far from the template that was used on A Matter Of Life And Death and The Final Frontier. The songwriting offers a good deal of variety but still largely matches upbeat tempos and drawn out structures under a darkly introspective umbrella. In an odd twist, Steve Harris's omniscient bass playing might be the least prominent it's ever been and Nicko McBrain's drums play more of a backing role to match. Fortunately, the triple guitar attack rolls with Kevin Shirley's muddy production job well enough and the strength of Bruce's vocal lines make up for any signs of strain.\n\nGoing along with that, there do seem to be a few more nods to the band's distant past than usual on here. \"Speed Of Light\" channels the hard rock grit better than anything on No Prayer For The Dying ever did and the title track is somewhere between \"Seventh Son\" and \"Mother Russia\" before hitting \"Losfer Words\" style speed metal at the halfway point. On the flip side, the intro to \"Shadows Of The Valley\" may be a little too close to \"Wasted Years\" for comfort and \"The Red And The Black\" attempts to match the tone of \"Rime Of The Ancient Mariner\" but doesn't have enough going on to really justify the thirteen minute running time.\n\nFortunately, there are still a few curveballs bookending the album that keep things interesting. The synths and spacy vocal effects on \"If Eternity Should Fail\" make it a slightly jarring opener but the smooth transitions work well and the writing style wouldn't make it too out of place one of Bruce's solo albums. \"When The River Runs Deep\" uses similarly smooth transitions while the mid-tempo riffs on \"Tears Of A Clown\" make it one of the band's most straightforward tracks in some time.\n\nAnd it would be blasphemy to not bring up \"Empire Of The Clouds,\" an eighteen minute epic penned solely by Dickinson. While the lyrics are on an \"Alexander The Great\" level of dryness and the composition could probably have had a couple minutes trimmed in the middle, the piano driving the piece works quite well and it does have a more cinematic scale compared to many of Maiden's other epics. It's stuff like this and \"If Eternity Should Fail\" that make me hope Bruce has at least one more solo album left in him...\n\nEven with its more ambitious nature, The Book of Souls just ends up being another good modern day Iron Maiden album. Anyone hailing this one as their best since [insert 80s classic here] hasn't properly acquainted themselves with Brave New World or The X Factor and anyone who says that this is too bloated has probably been saying that about the band in general for nearly a decade. Cutting \"The Red And The Black\" probably would've made this better than their last couple but not by a drastic amount. At the end of the day, you gotta the band credit for not getting lazy and for aging more gracefully than every other band at their level.\n\nHighlights:\n\"If Eternity Should Fail\"\n\"Speed Of Light\"\n\"When The River Runs Deep\"\n\"Tears Of A Clown\"\n\"Empire Of The Clouds\"\n",
        "\nIron Maiden are back from quietude, and boy howdy are they back with a vengeance. 'The Book of Souls' is a triumphant blend of progressive and classical Maiden elements. Bruce's voice is noticeably aged, yet elegant and strong. He knows his limits and strengths and plays them intelligently throughout. The album is well-paced, providing a good mix of short & long songs mixed together, and as a result you don't often feel drained. It truly is amazing that Iron Maiden have managed to maintain such a strong output in their later years. 'The Book of Souls' is an album that easily stands up against their earlier \"golden days\" material. In fact I would go so far as to say this album is better than a lot of their early-days material.\n\nOne thing I have to address, having seen a handful of negative or mediocre reviews is that I am so tired of these has-been, arrogant \"glory days\" rockers who compare everything Maiden does to 'Powerslave'. If you want to hear 'Powerslave', then go listen to 'Powerslave'. The album will always be there for you. But if you honestly expect Iron Maiden to release a 'Powerslave' part II then you're delusional and setting yourself up for disappointment. An album should always be judged by what it is, not what its predecessors are. So having said that, 'The Book of Souls' is a strong improvement over 'The Final Frontier', and easily stands up against their 80's hey-day material. \n\nSplit into two discs, this album gives you about 45 minutes of music per disc. \"If Eternity Should Fail\" opens the album with mysterious keyboard ambiance and melody, shortly followed by Bruce's soulful, reverberated voice. This song sets the precedent for the rest of the album, you're not in for traditional Maiden, this album is going to be unique, progressive, and keep you on your toes. The song is over 8 minutes long, but goes by at a brisk pace, ending unexpectedly, yet still satisfying. \n\n\"Speed of Light\" and \"When the River Runs Deep\" are the more straightforward rockers on disc 1, the latter of which has a unique chorus sure to be great for live performance. Closing off disc 1 is the title track of the album, and easily one of the best on the album. Its main riff harks to \"Mother Russia\" with it's heavy, headbanging rhythm, and the chorus is absolutely spine-tingling in its beautiful melody. \n\nDisc 2 kicks off with \"Death or Glory\", a bouncy tune with a surefire crowd-pleasing chorus, followed by \"Shadows of the Valley\", which begins with a lick fairly similar to the famous intro of \"Wasted Years\". Despite that similarity it slowly burns into a fierce explosion of galloping and one of the best choruses on the album. The highlight of disc 2, however, is \"Tears of a Clown\", which is about Robin Williams' fight with depression, and \"Empire of the Clouds\", a lovely epic featuring Bruce on piano. \n\n\"Empire of the Clouds\" is a somewhat frustrating song, as it displays genuine creativity and wonderful soul, but is held back by a mid-section that plays a guitar lick for entirely far too long (7:20-10:04). Had they cut these sections down to a shorter length the song would have been much stronger. For this reason, \"Empire of the Clouds\" is probably the weakest song on the album, despite its heart warming moments. \n\nThe production on this album is phenomenal. It's tight and has a subtle live sound, it really does feel like you're sitting in the studio with Iron Maiden while they play these songs for you. 'The Book of Souls' is proof that Iron Maiden is the greatest metal band. The first disc is 10/10, and disc 2 is more heartfelt and ponderous in pace. Iron Maiden show no signs of slowing down or deterioration, this is A-Grade certified Maiden. Up the irons!\n",
        "\nWhen it comes to thinking up insulting puns for albums I don\u2019t like, I like to make sure that my chosen epithet reflects the content of the music itself. Before hearing \u201cThe Book of Souls\u201d, I had decided that, if it ended up being another post-reunion Maiden effort full of bloated, mid-tempo songs, I would refer to it forevermore as \u201cThe Book of Snores\u201d. Yet, having heard the material, I have settled on \u201cThe Book of Sucks\u201d. As a piece of wordplay it\u2019s witless, predictable, done-before, completely lacking in any energy, novelty or creativity\u2026 it simply makes you want to groan \u2013 just like the music on this album.\n\n\u201cThe Book of Sucks\u201d plays out like a parody of an aging heavy metal band. If Hollywood\u2019s interested in making another Spinal Tap movie, perhaps turning it into a cringeworthy bromance comedy about ancient rockers, they needn\u2019t bother \u2013 just send a few cameras and a few Adam Sandlers along with the forthcoming Book of Sucks World Tour. Listening to this record is like being beaten over the head with a baseball bat by a tag team of Mr. Burns and Grampa Simpson. From the get-go, there\u2019s this niggling feeling that you\u2019re about to be subjected to an hour and a half of unyieldingly feeble, lethargic attempts at headbanging by some confused old men who keep forgetting where they are or what they\u2019re doing. For the music on this album is positively senile; a confused melange of barely-remembered thoughts of the good old days. Nearly every riff and melody on this record sounds like a geriatric, watered-down version of a riff or melody from one of Iron Maiden\u2019s previous records.\n\nThe longer tracks, in particular, have barely anything resembling a coherent structure, jumping from throwaway motif to throwaway motif. Many Iron Maiden diehards sneer at those who criticise this approach, insisting that Maiden has become \u201cmore progressive\u201d and that those who don\u2019t like it are somehow too bone-headed to appreciate their newfound musical eclecticism (N.B. Hollywood, don\u2019t forget to throw in an interview with one of these pompous zealots for some easy comic gold), but there is nothing \u201cprogressive\u201d about this sort of thing. It\u2019s just an endless jumble of ideas that don\u2019t really seem to flow or go anywhere. It\u2019s clear this is a band that\u2019s out of ideas, trying to compensate by jumbling and extending those ideas.\n\nThose songs \u2013 mostly the shorter ones - that do have some sort of flow (for example, \u201cDeath or Glory\u201d, \u201cWhen the River Runs Deep\u201d) are still a tad too slow to really get going and often just sound like throwbacks to older, better, more energetic songs. \u201cShadows of the Valley\u201d is just a more tepid version of \u201cThe Fallen Angel\u201d from \u201cBrave New World\u201d with the intro from \u201cWasted Years\u201d chucked on the front end. \n\nThis brings us to the production. Part of the reason \u201cThe Fallen Angel\u201d sounds better, despite being musically very similar, is that \u201cBrave New World\u201d had a much fuller, more metallic production. Not that the first reunion effort was without its production problems, but the last few Iron Maiden albums have had a thin, reedy sound to them, with Dickinson\u2019s voice way too high in the mix. You\u2019d never know that this was a band with four guitars from the production of this record. \n\nThe only time the guitars cut through the mix is during the guitar solos, which, across the whole album, are over-used, forgettable and mostly pointless. Adrian Smith has been the stand-out player since re-joining the band, but even he offers very little interesting here. Janick Gers is still standing at the side doing a jig with Eddie, just waiting to ruin another song with his comically bad leads, while Dave Murray has gone AWOL, with absolutely none of the flair and speedy legato that made him famous. So forgettable is his playing that, after listening, I find myself unable to remember him doing anything on this record. I feel like I\u2019m merely inferring he was there from the credits and the fact that I\u2019m sure I\u2019d have heard if he\u2019d died or something. It sounds like the guitarists just played the first thing that came into their heads, so they could get back to their round of golf/fishing. They deserve to have their parts drowned out by Shirley's crap production.\n\nBruce Dickinson sounds like Bruce Dickinson, still a very believable as the same man who sung \u201cHallowed be thy Name\u201d all those years ago. Bits of his higher register sound strained, but he\u2019s still on form. Yet a good singer is worthless if the music doesn't have good dynamics, and the dynamics of this record are, as with the last few Maiden outings, dreary and dire. Nearly every single second of music here is played in 4/4 (I think I heard one groove on \u201cTears of a Clown\u201d that bucked the trend and a bit near the end of \u201cEmpire of the Clouds\u201d), all within a horrible mid-tempo pocket that is something of a death trap for a band trying to play heavy metal \u2013 not quite fast enough to be energetic, head-banging, thrashy stuff, not slow enough to develop a good, crunching groove. You can actually skip across random points in the album and be fairly sure that you\u2019ll find Nicko plonking away at his ride cymbal at around 160bpm. It\u2019s sad to hear such a cool drummer apparently phoning it in like this, but it\u2019s not his fault \u2013 he does what he can with the music, but he\u2019s just so limited by Steve Harris\u2019 tired songwriting skills. I actually recommend playing tracks like \u201cSpeed of Light\u201d sped up \u2013 a hackneyed trick to restore the honour of Hackney\u2019s greatest drummer.\n\nI can\u2019t see what the argument was for making this record a double album. If you took out the bloat, you\u2019d be almost all the way to filling a single album that would rank among the better outings of the post-reunion Iron Maiden. This is definitely one of those records where the presence of some awful songs somehow tarnishes the better tracks. \u201cWhen the River Runs Deep\u201d, \u201cDeath or Glory\u201d and \u201cShadows of the Valley\u201d all pass muster as simple, solid post-reunion Iron Maiden \u2013 not a patch on the old stuff and fairly derivative, but quite listenable \u2013 but, nestled among the turgid dross that makes up most of this album, you spend these brief moments of heavy metal just waiting for Abe and Burns to pick up the baseball bat again.\n\nThe longer songs of the album are one of its defining features. \u201cEmpire of the Clouds\u201d in particular is worth a mention, as it was touted by early reviewers as some sort of masterpiece that would redefine the way people looked at Iron Maiden. Variously, I heard it described as \u201crevolutionary\u201d, \u201cemotional\u201d, and a \u201cmagnum opus\u201d \u2013 a sample of just some of the saccharine paeans that were flowing around this track before the record was released. I have to say, I am absolutely baffled. This has to be one of the most absurdly turgid, unexciting songs ever written in heavy metal. I remember thinking Judas Priest had lost the plot with \u201cLochness\u201d; by writing a slow, plodding song about an imaginary Scottish plesiosaur that went on for thirteen and a half minutes, they had gone full Tap in my mind. But I was a na\u00efve fool: here, we have an eighteen minute long slow rocker telling the tale of an old airship, featuring the model number, proper aeronautical terminology, corny strings and brass, and a section where they play in Morse code - and that description pretty much covers everything you need to know about this song. If Maiden ever want to top this attempt to out-Tap-the-Tap with overblown, bloated, comically-pompous songs about unlikely subjects, they will have to indulge us with a 34-minute epic tale of the events that led to the construction of an ancient Welsh commode, featuring a guest soliloquy by Ian McKellen (as the chief commode engineer's conscience), a three-way shred sitar harmony performed by a hologram of Ravi Shankar, and a full lights show in the recording studio which will be so grandiose and epic and amazing you'll actually hear the lights as you listen. \n\nSome will point to songs like \u201cEmpire of the Clouds\u201d as evidence of Maiden trying new things, rubbishing my earlier claim that the album lacks innovation and sounds tired and derivative. But there is a difference between trying new things, and just re-arranging old ones. Iron Maiden\u2019s big problem, when it comes to trying new things, is that they still only play within the confines of their trademark style. Whether this is because that\u2019s all they enjoy, whether it\u2019s because their musical knowledge is limited, or whether it\u2019s because they don\u2019t want to disappoint the fans, it\u2019s difficult to say, but; stretch it to 18 minutes, throw in pianos, do whatever you want: it\u2019s still the same stuff: galloping guitar rhythms, ride cymbals galore, soaring vocals, dual guitar breaks, that low-distortion Stratocaster guitar sound, lyrics about film and history \u2013 it\u2019s Iron Maiden! Steve Harris clearly sees himself as a musical experimenter, but his expectations constantly come up against the reality that Iron Maiden is a \u201cformula\u201d band in the vein of AC/DC or Slayer. The \u201cexperimental\u201d songs Maiden tries just sound like they threw old ideas into a tombola, then drew them until they got 10-minutes-plus of song. It\u2019s not real musical experimentation at all. Judas Priest is a good comparison point; a band that doesn\u2019t have to reinvent the musical wheel to make each of their albums sound unique and distinct, that can bend their style in lots of different ways while still remaining, at the core, a recognisable heavy metal brand. Iron Maiden doesn\u2019t seem capable, or willing, to do this, and so is stuck, trying to sound fresh within the straitjacket of their 35-year-old formula.\n\nTherefore this record, like the last few, falls flat because it unnecessarily jumbles a classic formula in a vain effort to sound fresh and innovative. It sounds like Iron Maiden, but slower, more pompous and generally less exciting.\n\nSo if it\u2019s still Maiden, but not Classic Maiden, then what is the music on this record? The most common refrain from fans of the post-reunion style is that the band has moved more into the realms of prog. Given the wealth and diversity of exciting, original progressive metal music that has been released since Iron Maiden debuted, this claim seems pretty absurd, and merely smacks of the hardcore fans\u2019 desperation to justify the ponderousness of the band\u2019s music. In the driest sense, you could claim this record is prog-power, but the problem is: while it ticks a lot of the boxes, it ultimately lacks both prog and power. What we have here is best described simply as \u201cpost-reunion Iron Maiden\u201d, a tepid, aging affair that sounds like no other band out there, but only because no other band out there could get away with playing such cumbrous, elephantine dad rock.\n\nIf you like that style, then I imagine you\u2019ll enjoy this record \u2013 its positives are basically that Dickinson\u2019s still on form and the band is still sounding very much like Iron Maiden - but if you think that outings like \u201cThe Final Affront to the Ears\u201d have been forgettable and sub-par, then, like me, you\u2019ll leave \u201cThe Book of Sucks\u201d gathering dust, hoping that, if there\u2019s a next time, Iron Maiden will come up with something a little more exciting. Because, if they intend to continue in this vein, there\u2019s little hope of another great heavy metal record from this band. Perhaps they should conclude the forthcoming Book of Sucks World Tour with a full performance of \u201cEmpire of the Clouds\u201d, culminating in a real airship crashing into the arena, killing everyone. It\u2019s what their idols-apparent Spinal Tap would do, and at least they\u2019d be going out with some of the fire and spectacle that once made them the most exciting band in heavy metal.\n",
        "\nBritish heavy metal legends Iron Maiden are back with a colossal new release covering two discs and a whopping running time of ninety-two minutes. Those who were afraid that this epic release might be even more progressive, lengthy and harder to digest than the cacophonic \u2018\u2018The Final Frontier\u2018\u2018 five years earlier, can relax and breathe again. Despite many overlong tracks, the eleven diverting new songs sound more structured than the material on the last studio album. The six artists go back to the classical heavy metal sound with some minor progressive guitar sounds as on \u2018\u2018Powerslave\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2019Somewhere in Time\u2019\u2019. The record also has a few darker tones that remind of \u2018\u2018The X-Factor\u2018\u2018 and especially \u2018\u2018A Matter of Life and Death\u2018\u2018. The record this new output is best compared to is though the underrated \u2018\u2018Dance of Death\u2018\u2018 because of this release\u2019s enormous diversity.\n\nBruce Dickinson\u2019s vocals sound even higher and more skilled but also more joyous and natural than on ''Dance of Death''. The bass sound on this album is a little bit less dominant than usual but still perfectly audible and the album even includes a short bass solo in the beginning of the classical epic \u2018\u2019The Red and the Black\u2019\u2019. The twin guitar leads are as melodic as always and the record includes a few solid but maybe slightly too experienced solo parts. Adrian Smith adds some progressive guitar sounds in the dynamic \u2018\u2019When the River Runs Deep\u2019\u2019, Janick Gers has a weakness for almost folk-influenced guitar leads as in the rather average title song \u2018\u2019The Book of Souls\u2019\u2019 and Dave Murray is the man for calm and psychedelic retro guitar leads as in the appeasing \u2018\u2019The Man of Sorrows\u2019\u2019 that needs numerous spins to grow on the listener. Nicko McBrain\u2019s drum patterns and fills sound a little bit too experienced as his performance is probably the least spectacular on this album. His fills in \u2018\u2019Speed of Light\u2019\u2019 sound exactly the same as in \u2018\u2019El Dorado\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2018Different World\u2018\u2018 and \u2018\u2018Wildest Dreams\u2018\u2018 before and he could have tried out a few new things here and there.\n\nThe production is quite straight and transmits a dynamic live in studio atmosphere. This record can\u2019t mess with the crystal clear and powerful sound of \u2018\u2018Powerslave\u2018\u2018 and the likes but along with the rejuvenated and straight unmastered sound of \u2018\u2018A Matter of Life and Death\u2018\u2018, this record might have the best production since \u2018\u2018Fear of the Dark\u2018\u2018. The simplistic yet effective album cover also shows a more grounded approach where the band goes back to basics.\n\nThe best new tracks are written by singer Bruce Dickinson. \u2018\u2018If Eternity Should Fail\u2018\u2018 is the best opener in at least two decades and comes around with a creepy and psychedelic atmosphere in the introduction and the epilogue while the centerpiece of this track is powerful, diversified and yet catchy with an incredible vocal performance. \u2018\u2018Empire of the Clouds\u2018\u2018 is one of the band\u2019s very best album closers and feels like a cinematic experience for all your senses. Bruce Dickinson is a gripping storyteller who introduces us to a topic he really cares about and the way he narrates, sings and whispers this track is authentic, diverting and intense. As if this wasn\u2019t enough, the song constantly shifts and changes hand in hand with the dramatic story without losing momentum or a clear guiding line. Bruce Dickinson\u2019s piano performance might not be spectacular but it fits and adds a credible dose of atmosphere to the tune along with some chilling orchestral passages. There is no doubt that both songs by Bruce Dickinson are among the very best tracks in the band\u2019s stunning career. These two tracks should become instant band classics.\n\nThose who like it less ambitious and but more focused, should try out the powerful and raw single \u2018\u2019Speed of Light'' that works very well in the album context, the catchy and more enthusiastic \u2018\u2019When the River Runs Deep\u2019\u2019 that would make a great second single, the simple yet efficient ''Death or Glory\u2018\u2018 that opens the second disk or the charming and melodic \u2018\u2018Shadows of the Valley\u2018\u2018 that includes some memorable \u2018\u2018Somewhere in Time\u2018\u2018 reminiscences. These songs might not be the most original ones in the band\u2019s impressive career but they stand for the band\u2019s rekindled lust for music. You can feel and hear how much the band must have enjoyed creating these new songs together before the shocking news that Bruce Dickinson had a cancer that surfaced right after the recording process. I'm convinced that all these tracks have the potential to become immediate live anthems.\n\nIf you took a look at the band\u2019s past few records, you would realize that Bruce Dickinson, Janick Gers and Adrian Smith have added the most interesting new songs to the band\u2019s extensive repertory while Steve Harris and Dave Murray kept repeating themselves. That\u2019s also the case on this release. Dave Murray\u2019s calm \u2018\u2018The Man of Sorrows\u2018\u2018 sounds like the timid little brother of \u2018\u2018The Man Who Would Be King\u2018\u2018 and needs a lot of patience to grow. Steve Harris is clearly running out of ideas on \u2018\u2018The Red and the Black\u2018\u2018 which is clearly too long and repetitive to work efficiently. Iron Maiden's mastermind also copies several of his very own songs like \u2018\u2018Rime of the Ancient Mariner\u2018\u2018, \u2018\u2018Heaven Can Wait\u2018\u2018 and \u2018\u2018Blood on the World\u2019s Hands\u2018\u2018 in this track. Even though they are not plain horrible, Harris\u2018 and Murray\u2019s songs are clearly the weakest on an otherwise surprisingly diverting, organic and passionate double-album.\n\nIn the end, Iron Maiden\u2019s new release proves that this band is still alive and kicking. \u2018\u2018The Book of Souls\u2018\u2018 mixes the band\u2019s greatest inspirations from the past with a few new elements brought in by a very creative Bruce Dickinson. Even though the album might have been one or two tracks shorter, this release is a highly diverting trip for any heavy metal fan. Most bands that have been around for four decades fail to equal their successes from the bast and deliver lukewarm new material as a pretext for new touring opportunities. Iron Maiden though delivers a very good new release that might not beat their very best releases but which is far above their most disappointing outputs. This new record is in the upper high-quality middle section of the band\u2019s studio outputs and while this position might only be of a good average quality for a band like Iron Maiden, there is no doubt that this fiercely glowing genre highlight easily beats any similar release of the past decade. Up the Irons!\n",
        "\n(And no, not many good things came out of it)\n\nLife after Bruce\u2026 it wasn't an easy stage in Iron Maiden's career. Not only did traditional heavy metal as whole take a major bust in popularity during the 90s, but Iron Maiden's earlier studio output from that decade wasn't all that encouraging. It took them a long time to find a replacement for Dickinson, and by that time the band's popularity had dropped quite a bit. American metal was being (pun alert) dominated by Pantera and their clones, and on a much more underground level by the emergence of brutal death metal, while the European scene was teeming with (evil) life in the form of extreme metal and a handful of great power/speed metal bands. I'm afraid the task that was presented to \u201cBlaze\u201d Bayley Alexander Cooke was almost impossible to accomplish. But he was nonetheless chosen to carry Eddie's torch, and at least he tried. \n\nIron Maiden's tenth studio recording is quite a large beast, clocking at one hour and eleven minutes. There are, however, painfully few moments of true Iron grandeur to be found here. The production is pretty good, almost as good as their 21st Century material, albeit with a few drops in volume, like in the unnecessarily long intro to opener \u201cSign of the Cross\u201d or the beginning of \u201cFortunes of War\u201d. Greater emphasis is placed on the guitars and Steve's muscular and acrobatic as usual bass, as if to compete with the groove metal outfits polluting the scene. The solos are quite alright, but again, I believe Iron Maiden's golden era of guitar solos were the 80s. Nicko's drums also sound heavier than usual, not in a good heavy metal way, but stale and slow, heavy as in something that's difficult to lift, like he's playing without drive and energy. The snare in particular, almost sounds St. Anger-esque. \n\nBut unsurprisingly, the lowest point of the album is of course Blaze's voice, which has nothing incendiary to it. Au contraire; it's monotone, unexpressive and remains in the same gruffy mid-range register throughout the entire recording. He attempts a few Dickinsoninan, passionate screams, but the unaccomplished results sound fake and unoriginal. In fact, he does try to sound like Bruce most of the time, but ends up sounding like an older, yet to be heard, version of him. Why did they choose this bloke as their frontman is beyond me, but history has been written. Unlike Judas Priest's replacement for the Metal God during the 90s and beyond, who at least had the technical chops, Blaze is mediocre at best and gets tiresome really soon. I couldn't help myself but to envision these eleven tunes with Bruce at the mic. The magnificent 2002 Rock in Rio's version of \u201cSign of the Cross\u201d is a legit indicator of what this release might have sounded if Dickinson had remained in the band. Not that it would instantly transform it into a masterpiece, though.\n\nSpeaking of \u201cSign of the Cross\u201d, it's hands down the best composition here, mid- paced but epic, and while it's still a far cry from \u201cThe Rime of the Ancient Mariner\u201d or \u201cSeventh Son of a Seventh Son\u201d, it is a pretty good composition, memorable and unique in Iron Maiden's discography thanks to its heavy use of Gregorian chants. \u201cMan on the Edge\u201d is the faster, shorter number here, recalling \u201cBe Quick or Be Dead\u201d not only because of its speed, but also due to its social-themed lyrics, which are however a bit weird. That's right, I also prefer Bruce's lyrics to Blaze's. Even so, it is my favorite Blaze-era song. The middle of the record is totally meh to me, but other decent tunes appear towards the end; \u201cBlood on the World's Hands\u201d, which has a fairly cool bass soloing intro by Harris and transforms into a solid track, and the blue-collar hymn \u201c2 A.M.\u201d with a catchy chorus that is Blaze\u2019s best performance on the album, by far. But truth is most songs blend into one another and lack enough personality to be remembered or recognized. They do still sound Iron Maiden, but in a generic, uninspiring way.\n\nOverall, the band sounds tired and aged, as if this release was recorded 15 years AFTER The Final Frontier, and not the other way around. It's amazing how the return of our beloved Bruce and Adrian would reinvigorate and rejuvenate the rest of the Irons at the turn of the Century. As for The X Factor, whenever I'm curious enough to revisit it, which doesn't happen too often, I just can't avoid picturing a geriatric Eddie, reassembled from the pieces the industrial butchering on the Hugh Syme cover artwork left, and strolling in a wheelchair at a slug pace, mindlessly drooling, its glowing tiny eyes staring lifelessly at a fixed point (maybe a Blaze pic hanging on the wall). Bayley would remain with the album for yet another disappointing release, but fortunately for us, Eddie would return later, as mighty as ever.\n",
        "\nDespite the impassioned disapproval of the long departed comedian Bill Hicks, there is an occasional beauty to the idea of marketing, and it was on full display exclusively at Best Buy where new meaning came to the concept of a two for one sale. For the steadfast Iron Maiden fan, it seems as though the last time a new album was on the way was when Hicks was still alive and kicking, thus with the added drama of a cancer scare that vocalist Bruce Dickinson weathered with the best of them, speculation and anticipation has been reaching near unrealistic territory. It's not quite to the point where everyone is going to disown the band for not reverting back to their 1980s sound, but complaints that Maiden hasn't regressed into the past are already in the making, and for those looking for such a musical outcome, it needs to be stated that Speed Of Light is definitely not a throwback to the glory days of the NWOBHM.\n\nNevertheless, this song is an outright boon for anyone who has continually followed this band through thick and thin and found a good deal of charm in the single material that preceded Dance Of Death, namely that of \"Wildest Dreams\" and \"The Rainmaker\". Though the location of recording is the same studio where Brave New World was created, this definitely has more of an affinity with its immediate successor, both in terms of production and songwriting style. It's one of the more rocking, yet decidedly mid-tempo character of a Maiden song that might remind one of \"Can I Play With Madness\", complete with the obligatory cowbell but minus the keyboards. Bruce throws in a slight bit of a gritty, gravely edge to some select parts of his vocal work that's pretty close to where he was on Fear Of The Dark, but it is used a bit more sparingly and the general structure of the song lends itself a bit more to sing-along fanfare than outrageous vocal gymnastics.\n\nOne thing that was arguably a bit deceptive in the advertising of the band regarding this song is that it was an outright return to the old days, which probably put images of Piece Of Mind or Number Of The Beast into some heads. However, when discounting the general smoothness and semi-progressive rock oriented character of the production, there are some fairly noticeable nods to the earlier days, not the last of which being the rocking, Deep Purple inspired intro riff and the extended free time outro that closes out the song. Similarly, the guitar solo interchange between Smith and Murray has all the characteristics of their classic 80s duels, with Murray being a bit more fancy and noodling whereas Smith takes on more of an expressive and syllabic quality to his work, and the hopelessly catchy Celtic folksy melody that chases the solo section definitely screams early 1990s Maiden like no tomorrow.\n\nIt's not necessarily a crime to have expectations, but it gets close to becoming that when it causes one not to see a great song for what it is simply because of what it happens not to be. It stands to reason that the massive song lengths advertised on the soon to be released LP The Book Of Souls several weeks back should clue any and all onlookers in that the progressive style that Maiden has been experimenting with going back to The X Factor are here to stay. Contrary to what might otherwise be said, that isn't a bad thing when considering the powerful results that were yielded immediately following the return of Smith and Dickinson. Those who were diligent enough to pick up an early physical copy of this single at Best Buy also had the joy of getting a t-shirt and a nice two dollar rebate on the LP when it's unleashed upon the masses. Attention marketers, those of you involved in this little scheme need not kill yourselves over this, for you've done well.\n",
        "\nHot on the heels of 'Dance of Death' came 'A Matter of Life and Death', a much more well rounded and succinct prog effort from the Maiden lads. Sporting a better production than its predecessor, AMoLaD is more organic and live sounding. The music elaborates on what 'Dance of Death' last accomplished, but improves on all prog elements to stunning effect, all whilst maintaining the classic refined Maiden trademark sound. The album is of course laden with interweaving guitar solos from the trio of Smith, Murray, and Gers and the dominant bass from Harris. Nothing really new in the performance department, but rather what makes this album so special is how well Maiden have managed to create their own brand of progressive metal in this album. \n\nWhat makes this album a real winner is the masterful songwriting. Every melody, every passage, every vocal line is appropriate and indispensible in the song's context. No song seems bloated or outstays its welcome. Bruce Dickinson's vocals are noticeably aged but still powerful, and unlike 'The Final Frontier' I can't notice any blatant pitch correction. Again, I say this album is very enjoyably organic. Bruce's softer points on the album, particularly in the beginnings of \"The Legacy\", \"Lord of Light\", and the entirety of \"Out of the Shadows\" really showcase the quality of his tone as a vocalist.\n\nA side note which I feel is another positive point for this album is it doesn't have any overly repetitive choruses (i.e., \"In a brave new world, a brave new world\" x4, \"The final frontier, the final frontier\" x4). The only possible offender on this point is \"For the Greater Good of God\", but it circumvents this issue relatively well in my opinion. \n\nThe album's opener \"Different World\" follows in the same path of the preceding album's \"Wildest Dreams\". This leaves only two more songs under the 6 minute mark, a brisk rocker called \"The Pilgrim\", and an absolutely lovely, rolling ballad called \"Out of the Shadows\". Every other song on the album is over six minutes and begins soft, escalating until it kicks into full steam ahead. Despite the similarity of intros, these songs all have their unique characteristics. \"The Legacy\" begins with haunting acoustic guitars and Bruce's old story teller-like persona. \"These Colours Don't Run\" and \"Brighter than a Thousand Suns\" are more bombastic in their explosions from quietude into rage, utilizing their trio-guitar assets to the fullest potential with harmonies galore. \n\n'A Matter of Life and Death' is easily one of Iron Maiden's strongest post-2000 releases, on par with 'Brave New World' (and I would argue it's better!). This is not your classic 'Powerslave' Iron Maiden, but if you're open-minded and interested to see what a mature, experienced band can do to grow and expand upon their trademark sound with resounding success then check this album out and enjoy.\n",
        "\nYou know in about a million cop movies or sports movies, when the hero has gone into retirement after a long and successful career, then when a new challenger, stronger than any before, rises up to challenge the field, they step back out of retirement and muster one last effort to defeat the threat? That's what Iron Maiden should be doing, except they haven't retired and thus can't muster up one last shot at glory. I've just seen the track listing for the upcoming 2015 Maiden album The Book of Souls and, knowing now that there's going to be 2 discs to that album and that we've got a 10 minute title track and an 18 minute album closer, I'm going to officially dub this album (as in The Final Frontier) \"The Warning\". As far as I can tell, Maiden have lost the plot and aren't going to get it back.\n\nOne needn't ask too far to elicit the difference between '80s Maiden and post-2000 Maiden. (I'm overlooking '90s Maiden, I know, but who doesn't?) The song lengths have grown, the progressive tendencies have emerged, the ambition seems to have increased, yet the ability to consistently deliver the goods has waned. None of the trio of '00s albums were free of filler or poor songs and all of them ran to excessive lengths, with some sections of songs bearing little fruit compared to the more focused work earlier in the band's career. I don't have a problem with bands writing long songs or changing their style, but I do worry that Maiden are simply doing this because someone feels they should or they can, and usually it hasn't worked. There are a few great longer songs in the last decade - 'Paschendale', 'The Legacy', 'Dance of Death' - yet the majority of them have been slow to build, lacking ideas and progress, or simply not up to scratch. This may in part be me judging Maiden on past glories, so let me take a song from The Final Frontier as an example. I'll choose 'Isle of Avalon' as symptomatic of many of the band's problems and also showing some of their remaining strengths.\n\nThat song has a long build-up, which eventually gets going into a rippling stream with some mysterious vocals stroking over the top, which sounds great, as if the band are holding back an ancient secret. Then that suspense breaks into a chorus (I think it's the chorus, but it doesn't deserve that name) that has one of the worst vocal lines I've ever heard from Bruce Dickinson over a very average riff that doesn't define itself or the vocals. There's another verse that is backed with keyboards and has a lot of momentum to it and refreshes itself very nicely with a simple fill, even if it doesn't end up anywhere particular. The lead section is definitely not characteristic of Maiden, since they have mostly been able to hang onto their great lead style even during times of turmoil: this one sounds like a jam session between a few drunk guitarists who have some skill, though apparently no idea of how to assimilate their skills into anything resembling a listenable experience. The first time I listened to that aimless solo, I actually laughed, because I just didn't see the point and couldn't fathom why the band included it.\n\nThese problems occur in many of the songs on The Final Frontier and, because of the excessive length of the album, are not only repeated but repeated ad nauseam for 76 minutes, during which time I forget which band I'm listening to several times. The first occasion is during the lengthy and unspeakably shit introduction to the title track, which lasts almost 5 minutes yet seems to be merely the end of Nicko McBrain's warm-up as he battles with his kit and everyone else joins in numbly around him. The lack of Maiden's traditional galloping rhythm is notable, as is the slow and often plodding (it's not brooding, or pensive, or calm) nature of these songs, while I find that the riffs have become a little softer and sometimes influenced more by hard rock than heavy metal. These changes aren't bad in themselves (well, plodding, maybe), but the band haven't found something better to fill the gap of their diminished personality, and - to a large extent - it was that personality and familiarity that brought fans to their new albums after the vigour and passion had begun to fade.\n\nMy distaste comes down without mercy on the title track, 'Isle of Avalon', 'Starblind', and 'The Man Who Would Be King', nor do the other songs manage to achieve a very high standard - their faults are simply tempered with some positives. The long slog of 'The Talisman' has a dull opening but there is at least 5 great minutes of driving verse and chorus bulk in the middle of the song, though the band again squander the solo in their desire to do something different; 'Mother of Mercy' pulls itself up on the best chorus of the album; 'El Dorado' manages to control its excesses enough to punch above its weight here, ending up as one of my 2 favourites along with 'The Talisman'. The general absence of hooks, be those in vocals, riffs, leads, or rhythms is sorely disappointing and the experimentalism doesn't come close to making up for that abyss in the centre of The Final Frontier.\n\nI can' t say much for the individual members of the band that hasn't been said already, but I will attempt to categorize my disappointment into its constituent parts. All of the instruments are heard clearly, including occasional keyboards, and there's nothing wrong really with the mix, only with the decision-making that has led to the creation of these songs. Steve Harris is more prominent than ever and actually plays his bass as if it is a lead instrument. This has been noticed in the past, but this time no one has managed to get a grip on playing rhythm and there are many moments, like that solo section of 'Isle of Avalon' and the one in 'The Man Who Would Be King', when everyone is doing something different and the whole devolves into a mess of guitar noise and pointless rhythms. Nicko McBrain is playing against the band when it would benefit him to be playing with them (those lead sections again), though he gives a fairly standard performance most of the time. The guitarists seem to have abandoned a style that they had built up over more than 30 years: we no longer have any classic Dave Murray solos, no Adrian Smith riffs, nothing to show that this is Iron Maiden or that Iron Maiden have been doing some serious thinking while they were touring the world and recording their new album. Bruce Dickinson has lacked some power in the last few recorded efforts, but here he also lacks skill at times, with several disjointed and awkward choruses, not to mention the tiredness that is evident in his voice at times.\n\nThis album comes as a stark reminder that all of our heroes are fallible and may fall at any point. The performance is flat and unbecoming of the band, while the songs are overlong and underdeveloped, often seeming aimless. I can understand why Maiden may have wanted to tinker with their old style, but I can't see why they would have chosen this as an advance of their talents and a good use of their energies. I hope I'm wrong, but I have a feeling the next Iron Maiden album is going to be terrible.\n",
        "\nWhen I was very young (let's say 12), I bought Iron Maiden's Dance of Death album, then, about a year later, I picked up Edward the Great, the greatest hits collection, for a minimal price. None of the songs from Iron Maiden or Killers appear on that compilation and 13 year old me concluded that those 2 early albums were lacklustre in comparison to The Number of the Beast and Seventh Son of a Seventh Son and so on. Naturally loving the greatest hits, I set about hunting down all of the Maiden albums one by one, starting with the 2 early releases that I had heard nothing of. (Not having any of those songs made them better value to my mind.) And, at first listen, I found them both much harder to get into than the classic '80s albums which Bruce Dickinson sings on. There was something a little more bristly and awkward about them that made them feel perhaps a bit older, perhaps a bit inferior, perhaps just more wilful and destructive.\n\nI still get that feeling about Killers. It is certainly separated from The Number of the Beast by more than just a year and a singer: the style bears marks of a more primitive, more energetic, more attacking kind of heavy metal, which does have some spikier shapes and rougher corners to it, not that they are any less thrilling than the classic sound that the band would develop later on. The pace of Killers is much faster than any other Maiden album, including the debut, and it feels vital as result, racing through its first half with nary a thought for survivors or casualties. A few of the songs have slower intros and build-ups, like 'Murders in the Rue Morgue', while 'Prodigal Son' goes all mellow and folky without being downright naff. Importantly, these moments do not dominate the album as they would later come to do, in my opinion diluting Maiden's flowing and uplifting sound. What is strange about this band is that they never got much heavier or much softer, so Killers, despite giving away 30 years to their most modern album, has perhaps the most in your face and meaty songs the band ever wrote. The main riff of the title track is both tricky to play and pushes the envelope more than we usually hear from Maiden, reminding one (achronologically, of course) of Mercyful Fate's 'A Dangerous Meeting'. 'Genghis Khan' is also interesting to investigate, since it is at once distinctively Maiden in its melodies and leads, yet vastly challenging in its rhythms. I've heard it described as a precursor to grindcore and, while I wouldn't go that far, Clive Burr does begin to build into something resembling blastbeats in that faster-and-faster mid-section, while Steve Harris's grumbling bass does more than one might expect of traditional heavy metal.\n\nI don't want to be guilty of adding significance after the moment has passed, but I actually hear more direct influences on other bands from the first 2 Maiden albums than the latter ones, and this may be due to the higher levels of energy and the faster pace of invention. This more aggressive tendency in the sound is fun to witness and may have something to do with Paul Di'Anno, whose voice wouldn't suit too many epics or slower parts. He isn't as talented as his replacement, but he doesn't really do much wrong, occasional lack of expression aside. He sounds at least as convinced and alive as Bruce Dickinson, spitting and snarling with a street-level violence that grabs you by the throat. Just look at the cover art of Killers: it's the least fantastic image that the band would use, but I see it as the most iconic of all their artwork, and I don't believe their sound would ever suit that image again. The rest of the band play it a little straighter as well, with the guitar riffs going for pure speed on occasion (the verses of 'Purgatory' for example), while the melodies come thick and fast, sometimes as separate movements in the song, sometimes as complementary pieces. Listening to Steve Harris relentlessly swooning and plunging on his bass, you get the feeling that Maiden would have made a very good speed metal band if they had decided to head in that direction, though the lead style sounds generally more majestic when they just drop the pace a notch.\n\nI don't have much to complain about in the songwriting department, because Maiden drop no clangers and, even though 'Prodigal Son' is my least favourite track, I fully recognise why it had to be on the album. The other songs don't quite have the classic tone of 'Run to the Hills' or 'The Trooper', but I also think that we can't compare them on the same level, since there is more here to get your face red and your neck sore than to pump your fist and scream your lungs out to. 'Wrathchild' and 'Murders in the Rue Morgue' are both excellent hunt-and-kill numbers, the former a brisk rush of blood soaked in lead work and the latter getting the edge on chorus impact, with its lurching, plunging bass riff driving Di'Anno to proclaim his innocence in an interesting reworking of Edgar Allen Poe's classic story. The title track is naturally the textbook example of the serial killer song, which has been imitated countless times and rarely bettered. There was a time when Maiden could write a 5 minute song with nothing missing, while now they can't even do that in 8 minutes. There's also 'Purgatory', which may just be the most savage song that Maiden ever wrote: pure cut-throat intention and flawless execution makes this a wicked listen.\n\nThere is a lot of dispute over Iron Maiden's various changes in style and the perfection or imperfection of each one. I can't fully make my mind up at which point Maiden did the most for me, and in fact I think I'm just glad that they have left us with so many albums to choose from. Killers is probably not the most accomplished release that this band ever recorded and it does have a few rough edges here and there, but it must be, for me, the most visceral release of Iron Maiden's career. The sound from this album has been vastly influential and is still great to listen to.\n",
        "\nIron Maiden is one of the most influential bands of the heavy metal world, surely this beloved world would not be the same without them. Being influenced by bands like Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin or The Who, Steve Harris formed his third band in 1975, \"Iron Maiden\", passing various musicians before the lineup of this album. Iron Maiden in turn has influenced many bands of various genres such as thrash or power metal.\n\nIn 1980, Steve Harris and company released their first full-length (after recording a demo), self-titled name, with excellent musicians. It's a great start for this music legend. It\u2019s an album with a dirty sound, however, the production is not bad at all, but it can be much better. Steve Harris never got completely satisfied with this but I like it because it gives an especial essence. You can hear perfectly all the instruments without forcing the ear and that's enough for me. But this not last long, in the \"Killers\" album, the production change completely, with a much better sound. \n\n\"Iron Maiden\" has very punk style songs as \"Prowler\", \"Running Free\" or \"Iron Maiden\" and other more heavies as \"Sanctuary\" or \"Phantom of the Opera\" and the amazing instrumental \"Transylvania\" and the beautiful ballad \"Remember Tomorrow\" and \"Strange World\".\n\nClive Burr is a machine at the drums (it\u2019s a shame that he\u2019s no more with us) especially in songs like \"Phantom of the Opera\" where it looks incredibly good or the catchy \"Running Free\", he's just an excellent drummer. And not to forget Steve Harris, with his legendary bass and the feeling that he gives, so characteristic of Iron Maiden and distinctive, one of my favorites bassists of all times. I also highlight the voice of Paul Di'Anno, a singer with a big charisma and a perfect voice for the first Iron Maiden phase, with that raspy voice on songs like \"Prowler\" or \"Iron Maiden\" and the beautiful and clean vocal lines in \"Remember Tomorrow\" and \"Strange World\". \n\nDave Murray (loyal to the band since the beginning) and Dennis Stratton do an impeccable job creating and executing excellent riffs, as the beginning of \"Phantom of the Opera\" and all the incredible solos it has; or the catchy riff from \"Iron Maiden\", a fast track and a very thrash drumming. We also have \"Strange World\" with a beautiful and mysterious sound at the guitars, it reminds me to \"Planet Caravan\" from Black Sabbath.\n\nConcluding, \"Iron Maiden\" is a highly recommendable album, here begins the legend and the best was yet to come. High quality songs, very worked, memorable and catchy. By the way, on the cover, we see an angry Eddie with war appetite and his long hair that would last three more albums until the poor creature get his head opened.\n\n\n\"Beware the Morbid Killer\"\n",
        "\nThere are many reasons why Iron Maiden\u2019s second full length studio record \u201cKillers\u201d has become an iconic album with a huge impact on both the band\u2019s career and the young heavy metal genre in general. First of all, there is of course the memorable close-up album cover of band mascot Eddie who looks much more charismatic than before and has since become the most popular mascot of an entire genre. The production on here is clearer, more dynamical and tighter than on the debut that suffered from an average sound quality. The song writing has also become more consistent. While the debut record included a lot of experiments and lacked a clear concept, \u201cKillers\u201d has a clear guiding line despite a more elevated number of tracks and a few interesting exceptions. Talented guitarist Adrian Smith has replaced Dennis Stratton who wasn\u2019t the right choice for the band since he was not only older than the other band members but also less into the heavy metal scene in general. Even though this record is probably the least impressive with Adrian Smith\u2019s participation, his uniquely emotional and more technical guitar play already adds a new dimension to the sound and complements Dave Murray\u2019s melodic but less experimental leads in a good way. Paul Di\u2019Anno\u2019s vocals sound even more confident than on the debut album and he probably delivers the best performance of his career. The rhythm section with Steve Harris on bass and Clive Burr on drums also takes more space than on the first album. This album is much straighter, harder and dirtier than the first strike and mixes the best elements of heavy metal, punk rock and rarely but efficiently employed progressive or psychedelic rock influences.\n\nIn my opinion, there are also several negative points to mention. While the flow of the record is clearer and straighter than on the predecessor, the working formula gets somewhat redundant after a while. To be fair, I\u2019m not talking about the two instrumental tracks even though I think that especially \u201cGenghis Khan\u201d is bland and boring and that I would have expected something more epic when a track is named in honour of one of the most important historical and historic characters of all times. A good example would rather be \u201cAnother Life\u201d which starts with promisingly dynamical drum loops, emotional guitar leads, a tight rhythm section and a charismatic and variable performance by Paul Di\u2019Anno. The problem is that the song repeats itself after only one minute. In three minutes and a half, the track only includes four lines of lyrics which are repeated three times. I don\u2019t really understand why the band didn\u2019t write three short verses with different lyrics as the rest of the track is really great. \u201cInnocent Exile\u201d, \u201cPurgatory\u201d and \u201cDrifter\u201d have similar problems and especially the latter two are rather disappointing tracks. \u201cPurgatory\u201d is a really bland fast heavy metal track and by far the band\u2019s worst single choice. The equally fast and short bonus track and single \u201cTwilight Time\u201d is already much better due to its melodic and psychedelic chorus and even the often criticized Skyhooks cover \u201cWomen in Uniform\u201d is a great party tune performed with groove and passion. Album closer \u201cDrifter\u201d is by far the least impressive of its kind in Iron Maiden\u2019s entire discography. The track is too long and repetitive for its own good and the breaks or solos after each verse are destroying the flow of the tune.\n\nOn the other side, the record also includes a few aggressive, consistent and short heavy metal anthems that work very well such as the charismatic \u201cWrathchild\u201d with its charismatic galloping bass guitar and one of Paul Di\u2019Anno\u2019s angriest vocal performances ever. \u201cKillers\u201d is a track that took some more time to grow on me due to its long and psychedelic introduction but what follows is a fast paced yet atmospheric heavy metal anthem with haunting lyrics and vocals. Ironically, my personal highlights on the record are the two tracks that don\u2019t really fit in. \u201cMurders in the Rue Morgue\u201d is in my opinion probably the very best song written while Paul Di\u2019Anno was in the band. The track starts with great psychedelic guitar harmonies that give the song a fitting mysterious atmosphere before the tune gets faster and explodes into a passionate and speedy heavy metal banger with angry bumblebee bass sounds and powerhouse drumming. The track is not only aggressive and fast from then on but includes the most vivid melodic guitar solos on the entire album and Paul Di\u2019Anno\u2019s most diversified vocal effort where he shows off what an underestimated and powerful singer he was back then. The other outstanding tune is definitely \u201cProdigal Son\u201d, an epic and mystic piece dominated by acoustic guitars and laid back vocals in the key of the two ballads from the debut record. The song has this certain something which gives it an incredibly longing yet slightly occult atmosphere which could come from the greatest progressive rock bands of the late sixties or early to mid-seventies such as Pink Floyd, Genesis or even early Rush. The track sounds nothing like any other Iron Maiden ballad and is maybe the most experimental track ever written by the band. It\u2019s a track that really inspires and touches me and which proved back then that this is not just a short-living and exchangeable product of its time but a band that would go on to change the world with its music over the next thirty-five years and beyond.\n\nAll in all, Iron Maiden\u2019s \u201cKillers\u201d must be seen as a step forward for the band as Iron Maiden forged its own identity and niche in rock music with this release after the more eclectic debut release. Both the dynamical production and the cohesive play of the band sound much tighter than before and the different instruments harmonize much more and complement each other better than on the predecessor. Due to some obvious flaws in the inexperienced song writing and an unusually elevated number of filler tracks that sound like they had been written in ten minutes each, this is still one of the weakest outputs in Iron Maiden\u2019s groundbreaking, innovating and massive discography. From my point of view, the album is one step forward and one step back at the same time for these reasons and personally, both the debut album and its follow-up are pretty much on the same level. This album is recommendable for fans of the early New Wave of British Heavy Metal and those who like faster genres such as punk rock, speed metal or even thrash metal. Occasional heavy metal fans should rather go for the more important \u201cThe Number of the Beast\u201d, \u201cPowerslave\u201d and \u201cSomewhere in Time\u201d among others.\n",
        "\nThis album was the very first steps of what would grow into something legendary. With that said, however, I have quite mixed feelings on this first one from Iron Maiden. I've always felt that Paul Di'Anno never got enough credit for what he did on the two records he was on. Sure, he's far from Dickinson's level of talent; however, throughout this album, Di'Anno still shows a consummate talent level throughout his and Iron Maiden's first release. Iron Maiden's self-titled certainly has it's strong points, though for almost every strength this album possesses, there is a weak link to counter it. \n\nFirst, let's begin with the musicianship. The guitar work on this album is, for the most part, very good. The track \"Remember Tomorrow\" exhibits some of the strongest guitar work we've ever heard from Iron Maiden. It's quite complex, but not complex to the point where it becomes overwhelming and repetitive, like some musicians fall victim to. Another track in which the guitar work stands out greatly is the Iron Maiden classic, \"Phantom of the Opera\". Honestly, everything about this song is borderline perfect to me, although I do prefer the later live versions of Bruce Dickinson singing it; nothing against Di'Anno, I still think he was a strong vocalist, but as most Iron Maiden fans, I've simply always preferred the range that Bruce brings to the table. However, despite the talent that Adrian Smith and Dave Murray exhibit in the strong points of this album, there are also points in this album where the riffs feel a little bit weak and are nothing compared to the riffs found in later Iron Maiden albums (i.e. Powerslave and Piece of Mind). For example, the riffing in songs such as \"Running Free\" and \"Charlotte the Harlot\" have always seemed a bit lacking to me, after a while becoming a bit repetitive and bland. \n\nThis album also shows the promising beginnings of having a guy the likes of Steve Harris on the bass; sure, it's not quite as strong as in later releases, but I still find his work on this record as a bit of a glimpse of things to come for him. Also, Clive Burr was for sure a solid drummer, however, he seems to have been for the most part unable to play some of the more difficult things that his successor in Nicko McBrain could do, which somewhat hurts the rating, as the drumming on this record is pretty simplistic.\n\nDi'Anno's vocals, on the other hand, aren't quite as strong as the instrumentation on this record. Let me begin by saying I've always liked Di'Anno more than most Maiden fans; this may be because the first Iron Maiden album I ever heard was Killers. With that being said, however, I'm not as much of a fan of his vocals on this release as much as on Killers. I feel like he doesn't show enough range on this one as he does on their sophomore album. That's not to say his vocals on this one are bad, because they most certainly are not. Di'Anno's vocals just are not the best, and it feels a bit unfair to him to have to compare him to his successor in Dickinson, because their styles are completely different and with Dickinson, honestly, it's a bit unfair to compare almost anybody to him considering his overwhelming vocal talent. \n\nThe songwriting on Iron Maiden is very strong, as is the vast majority of the work that Harris has written throughout his musical career. The lyrics are spectacular, as all Iron Maiden lyrics are, though of course not as strong as their later releases when they further develop into musicians, lyricists, and song-writers. The songs themselves are formatted and written very well, though there are a few parts here and there that made me stop and think \"I'm really glad they developed into much more powerful musicians.\" \n\nThough this album certainly does not live up to many of it's later records to follow, it certainly shows promising beginnings of a band we all know to later become legendary. In terms of a band's first record, this album is certainly up there, as very often a band or artist will struggle a bit with their first record in finding what fits them best, being more well-developed in song writing, etc. Iron Maiden showed strong points in all of this, but it was relatively weak, as to be expected from a first album.\n",
        "\nIron Maiden truly needs no introduction. It's one of a few bands that have been cemented into the minds of every metaller the world over to the point where owning at least one of their albums is an unspoken requirement. If anybody has to start, \"Powerslave\" would be an excellent choice. It's an album that has all of the trademarks that made Iron Maiden famous, but it also contains longer tracks than previous albums, thus proving Iron Maiden's quest to make more and more musical opuses, even though they've already churned out quite a few! This a point in Iron Maiden's career when a lot of other famous NWOBHM bands like Def Leppard would go straight for the radio-friendly love song, but Iron Maiden decided to get more and more complex with their songwriting.\n\nOn \"Powerslave\" there is no song that is shorter than four minutes. That means that the band is wanting to put out songs that display its talents more and more, and while some bands just put in a lot of repetition just to lengthen the song, Iron Maiden puts more material into theirs. The thirteen-minute \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\", based off of the famous epic poem by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, is obviously the best example of this. The first part of it contains a galloping riff that breaks into harmonic solos every now and then with each verse sung by Bruce Bruce himself. It then escalates into a faster, more powerful riff to carry the story from the poem from which the song is based, not to mention the sound effect of the ship creaking as it sails in a stormy sea. All of that grinds to a halt as we hear a haunting bass line of Steve Harris and a soft guitar playing as Bruce narrates part of the actual poem. The fact that some of the actual poem make up the actual lyrics of the song add to the intelligence of the songwriting. After the narration, Steve picks up a more energetic, yet soft riff that would eventually build up to the song's conclusion. It isn't just the song's length that make it a masterpiece, it's how that amount of time is actually used, and that time is used very efficiently and nicely. \n\nOf course we have the excellent harmonies created by Dave and Adrian that elevate the sound well. It's part of Iron Maiden's signature, and it can be very well be heard in many of the songs on here, including the crowd favorite, \"Aces High\". In fact, the harmonies that the guitarists create make up the song's intro, as well as its main riff. The tones of these harmonies are fast and gallant, and the riff of more aggressive power chords that make up the verses are grinding and powerful, creating a sense of desperation. If you want to stop the Luftwaffe from killing thousands of innocent people in an attempt to help Nazi Germany take over the world, you'd have to have that kind of attitude! It's the high energy of this song that captures the spirit of Spitfires embroiled in a dogfight, and the signature formula of having complex harmonic riffs helped create that high energy. The harmony doesn't stop there, we've also got the solos of \"Flash of the Blade\" and the instrumental track \"Losfer Words (Big 'Orra)\". It isn't just the harmonic riffs that create the complexity of Dave and Adrian's work, for there's also the also the riff that is played in the chorus of \"Back in the Village\", which consists of rapidly played notes, not something you'd expect to be played outside a solo. \n\nI said earlier that the harmonies that make up the main riff in \"Aces High\" create the atmosphere of the Battle of Britain, but it isn't the only song that conveys the atmosphere of its intended subject matter. The title track is about the death and afterlife of an ancient Egyptian pharaoh, and to give us this ancient Egyptian vibe, the riffs are played mainly using harmonic minor arpeggios. These harmonic minor arpeggios give off an eerie, ancient feel, as if the listener is actually inside a pharaoh's tomb. The main riff also contains ominous-sounding chords and introduces the song as it carries us into that tomb. There's also \"The Duellists\", which has a quick-paced tempo and a fast flurry of arpeggios just before the solo that is also made into a harmony by the guitarists. These factors convey a message of the elegance and the swiftness of a dueling swordsman, which is basically what Bruce Dickinson is in much of his downtime (seriously, he's a world-class fencer!). The message is carried even further with the elegant-sounding chorus, with powerful chords and even more vocal delivery of Bruce. \n\nThere's no doubt that \"Powerslave\" is among the classic albums that's on almost every metallers' playlists, but if you listen carefully enough, you'll find that at the time of its release, it was a more advanced release than its predecessors. The band was getting more and more popular with each album the shovel out, eventually becoming a household name among metal fans in the 80's. However, instead of \"selling out\" and making their songs less complex and more appealing to the Duran Duran crowd, they continued to make their songs longer and more powerful than ever. They would create riffs that C.C. Deville would puke at the sight of, and still manage to fill arenas with horn-throwing fans across the globe.\n",
        "\nNo, I do not deny that \"The Angel and the Gambler\" is repetitive as hell. No, I am no friend of synthesizers in heavy metal in general. And no, I do not believe that \"Virtual XI\" must be placed among the monuments of the highest artistic value. Nonetheless, dare I say it, I really like this rather unusual Maiden album. I would even go further and say that this unjustified banished full-length represents the second best result ever achieved by the British institution. Of course, regarded from an objective point of view, most of their other albums were of greater importance for the heavy metal scene. But in my humble opinion, only \"Piece of Mind\" is better. Now I am encouraged to write the rest of the review, following the maxim \"Once your worldly reputation is in tatters, the opinion of others hardly matters\".\n\nThe first half of \"Virtual XI\" was absolutely flawless. I admit that the songs had a slight pop appeal. Due to the light production and the massive presence of the synthesizer, the general atmosphere of the tracks was not comparable with that of its sinister predecessor. But the songwriting itself compensated this situation, because it was catchy and vibrant to the highest extent. Furthermore, it did not lack of variety. I recommend to compare the epic tunes such as the outstanding \"The Clansman\" with the lively and spirited opener. Due to its straightforwardness, it appeared as a modern edition of their early tracks like \"Sanctuary\" or \"Running Free\" that also came directly to the point. The emphasis of the melodic elements did not lead to a loss of quality, because all melodies fulfilled the highest requirements. Finally, I must confess that I was a fan of Blaze Bayley\u00b4s voice since I had heard it for the first time. His interpretation of \"The Sign of the Cro-o-oss\" was simply fantastic. In view of this, I was not surprised that his vocals on \"Virtual XI\" were once again powerful, expressive and well accentuated.\n\nThe album\u00b4s second half was less breathtaking. \"The Educated Fool\" met the standard of the first four songs. It offered the whole range of Iron Maiden in a pleasant way. Balladic sections, concise and effective guitar lines and relatively heavy parts were seamlessly connected with each other. The remaining tunes had their moments while being neither outstanding nor bad. \"Como Estais Amigos\", the ballad that closed the album, belonged to the better metal ballads, among other things due to its dramatic development and the historical reference to the (rather nonsensical) Falklands War. Nevertheless, it was still a ballad... However, it goes without saying that this record did not deliver their harshest compositions. But they were thoroughly thought through and this was - as always - the most important aspect.\n\nThe playtime of \"only\" 53 minutes constituted another advantage of the album. In contrast to the oversized \"The X-Factor\" which had been at least ten minutes too long, the eleventh full-length appeared as a compact powerhouse. Nonetheless, it seems like \"Virtual XI\" is treated like a pariah by the majority of metal fans. But I mostly like unadapted underdogs. They have their own special charm - and that goes for the here reviewed album too.\n",
        "\nSince the return of Bruce Dickinson and Adrian Smith before the recording of Brave New World, all Iron Maiden albums have been too long and inconsistent. I want to pick Steve Harris up by the shoulders and shake him until all the lame quiet parts and narrative ideas and \"understated epics\" have fallen out of his long thick locks. Remember Number of the Beast when there was only one song over 7 minutes and those 7 minutes were full of riffs and excitement? Why did it stop?\n\nEr-hem.\n\nIron Maiden are still a fantastically talented band and that's what they sound like for about 40 minutes of Dance of Death. The 2 opening tracks are both swift and ruthless, with massive choruses and no fluff. 'Rainmaker' is probably the better of the two because of its distinctive melody and great solos, but the intro to 'No More Lies' heralds the start of a tendency to stagnation that plagues latter day Maiden like locusts and frogs plagued that Egyptian guy whose name would really round this point off nicely. The intro isn't shit per se, it just wastes time and it isn't until 2 and a half minutes into the song that it goes anywhere, at which point it's riffishly precise and upbeat, as are a good two thirds of the songs on here.\n\nThat's not to say that the epic angle doesn't work sometimes. I personally love the title track, cute campfire build up and all, because it gets the storytelling spot on (the album cover, not so much) and the lead guitar throughout the song is just blissful. Thought Pagan Altar were stealing the crown from Maiden this century? You can fuck right off: the folky harmonies, the twin guitar riff in the scrambling dance in the middle, plus that soaring Celtic melody that repeats near the end of the song. On a different note, the screaming solos in 'Paschendale' are enough to bring a man to tears. Those are 2 songs that use their length and variety for reasons of subtlety and atmosphere, and they come off as the album's best, more or less.\n\nOn the positive side, Dance of Death is unexpectedly heavy in places. 'Montsegur' is full on from beginning to end and reminds us why Iron Maiden inspired so many speed metal bands, while 'Gates of Tomorrow' sets off like a lawnmower, throbbing petrol bass and chugging guitars blaring. The intensity is much higher than on Brave New World and the songs feel more dynamic and coherent, though could use a little trimming and editing. The guitarists, as already mentioned, are practically unbeatable, particularly in the lead department; Steve Harris being quiet on an Iron Maiden album is like Brian Blessed being quiet on cocaine - he rumbles and throbs along in inimitable style as usual; Nicko McBrain has a lot to contend with, but manages it all with an ease, finesse, and aggression that genuinely pulls the album up a notch, plus he gets a vocal on one song (haha - no, seriously). There are keyboards here and there too: they don't interfere too much and give a couple of songs a more epic feel. Bruce Dickinson, on the other hand, comes and goes a bit. He sounds good, though I can listen to whole songs without paying much attention to him, which is worrying for a man nicknamed \"the air raid siren\". He doesn't sing high at all, and some of the choruses could do with some help to bring them to the boil. However, he has one of the best sets of lyrics on any album, by any band.\n\nThe place I would indicate as the downfall of the album would be the last 3 songs. Again, they waste some time, but it's the fact that none of them sound essential that is the worst thing. Admittedly, 'Journeyman' is an unexpected ballad, which I'm not keen on because I prefer the heavier, faster side of Maiden. I don't want to be that guy who says, \"I only like this band when they play fast\", but Maiden really do sound much better when they go at it with some urgency. Some of these comments may make it sound like Dance of Death is somewhat of a disappointment, but it's actually my favourite Maiden album of this century, followed by its predecessor, A Matter of Life and Death. It's hard to see Maiden carrying on for another 10 years, but this album is now 10 years old and is a more than worthwhile listen, exploring a few new directions in the process, so who knows, right?\n",
        "\n\u201cSeventh Son of a Seventh Son\u201d is considered by many as the last effort in a streak of experimental, genre-defining and powerful heavy metal releases in the eighties by Iron Maiden. The record received overwhelming reviews from both fans and professional critics and each time the album grows five years older, the rock media are dedicating special contributions to this album. Recently, Iron Maiden got also caught by euphoric nostalgia and went on a new \u201cMaiden England\u201d style tour centered on songs from this record. Almost nobody really seems to disagree that this is a groundbreaking release.\n\nWell, I do. Believe me, as a long-time fan of Iron Maiden it\u2019s quite tough for me to criticize this band for one of its most influential releases. Usually, I agree with both professional experts and fans from all around the world that records like \u201cThe Number of the Beast\u201d, \u201cPowerslave\u201d and \u201cSomewhere in Time\u201d are untouchable masterpieces that revolutionized an entire genre but I have to disagree on this one.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the positive things first. The record has somewhat accidentally become a conceptual release. The lyrics have a certain guiding line, include interesting narrative elements and are still open for interpretation. The lyrics work well as a whole but also as single songs. The album has a constantly progressive and smooth atmosphere characterized by a distinctive mellower production, the use of guitar synths and even keyboards and longer tracks with laid-back instrumental parts in form of both introductions and soli. One can really talk about a coherent and focused song writing effort.\n\nThere is no doubt that this album also includes a few really outstanding songs. First off, there is the brilliant \u201cInfinite Dreams\u201d which is almost a perfect definition of a melodic progressive metal tune. It has soaring melodies, an emotional yet calm and harmonious vocal performance, meaningful and poetic lyrics, smooth changes of style including both really laid-back melodies and a few faster parts grabbing your attention and it doesn\u2019t include any unnecessary breaks or soli. Objectively said, this is probably one of the very best songs of both its new genre and Iron Maiden in general. \n\nLet me point out another amazing tune that goes in a really different direction. \u201cThe Evil That Men Do\u201d is an obvious single choice because of its catchy and melodic chorus but the song offers more than just this. From the first seconds on, the melodic guitar tone builds up a chilling atmosphere. Despite its melancholic touch, the track has a pleasant pace with great riffs, a vividly pumping bass guitar and a tight drumming. The vocals are diversified and performed with passion as they vary from darker verses with narrative parts and a meaner tone to liberating and high-pitched but never annoying parts in the pre-chorus and chorus. The whole song sounds really balanced and focused but is still one of the most diversified and progressive singles ever written by the band. \n\nAs I said before, there is also the negative side of this release which sadly dominates over the positive aspects. First of all, the production is too mellow for a metal release in my opinion. It\u2019s surely an interesting and courageous experiment to opt for a different mastering but the final result sometimes lacks dynamics in my opinion. In addition to this, the record is overall too fluffy and really looses my attention in the second half.\n\nLet\u2019s give a few examples that elaborate on my controversial point of view. First off, there is the title track, the epic ten-minute heart and soul of this release. This is one of the major reasons why this album is less spectacular than its two predecessors in my opinion. The song is atmospheric and starts very well but goes downhill from there. The instrumental part at the end of the record is repetitive and unspectacular as it drags on for far too long as if the band had absolutely wanted to include a song near the ten-minute mark on the album. The guitar soli are not really emotional or unique enough to convince and one expects something to come after all the soloing but the song simply ends at a certain point. The circle never closes and the track also fails to end with a bang. It could have also ended three minutes earlier or three minutes later and it wouldn\u2019t have made any difference and that\u2019s why the end of the track sounds redundant to me. I also think that the calmer break of the song tries a little bit too obviously to copy the break in \u201cRime of the Ancient Mariner\u201d which is maybe the most ambitious epic ever written by the band. It's actually the first time the band is directly copying itself which is never a good sign for the creative longevity of a group of artists. Not only that the band has been there before and doesn\u2019t introduce anything new to the listener, the narrative section in this part is a lot less atmospheric than in the original epic that was brilliantly cinematic as the listener could almost feel as if he was on board of a doomed ship. This effect doesn\u2019t work on the title track here as it doesn\u2019t make me feel anything. A last negative point of this song is obviously the chorus of the track. Not only that such a progressive tune wouldn\u2019t have requested a chorus but in this case it simply consists of hectically and repetitively singing the name of the track followed by forced sing along parts to fill the emptiness. I always felt as if the band had run out of ideas for this song after five minutes or so but artificially stretched this track to the double. \n\nAnother song I dislike for completely different reasons on the record is the single \u201cCan I Play With Madness\u201d that has neither the atmosphere nor the diversity of \u201cThe Evil That Men Do\u201d for example. It\u2019s an exchangeable and forcedly joyous melodic rock tune that aims for commercial success and airplay which simply doesn\u2019t fit to what Iron Maiden has always stood for. The chorus is not only filled with childish melodies but also dull and unimaginative from a lyrical point of view. In this form, it feels like a foreign body on an otherwise elaborated and progressive rock inspired terrain. Even as an outstanding exception, this song doesn\u2019t work because it even fails in what it tries to be. Several other hard rock and heavy metal acts had made similar guitar synth and keyboard driven singles that worked a lot better, for example the British colleagues from Judas Priest.\n\nThe closing \"Only the Good Die Young\" tries to go back to the average opener \"Moonchild\" which is an interesting idea for a conceptual release. The problem is that both songs sound too similar to stand out on such a short release. Another thing that really bothers me is that this track has by far the mellowest production on the album. The track doesn't develop any pace and sounds like an average AOR song of its time that could also come from Dokken, Foreigner or Whitesnake. The song sounds way too tame and unspectacular to close a heavy metal record with. It's not a great and moving ballad either which would be acceptable. No, it's simply one of the most uninspired songs in the career of this band. Instead of ending the album with emotion or power, the song sounds like a confusing mixture of commercial melodic rock and conceptual progressive rock. This closer is though not unique and catchy enough to convince as melodic rock track and it's not original or profound enough to work as a progressive rock track. This song is caught somewhere in a no-man's-land in between both genres and goes straight nowhere.\n\nThe worst thing on this album is though the exchangeable \"The Prophecy\". I don't know how many times I've listened to this song in my life but it simply fails to stay on my mind. Even the worst fillers from later Iron Maiden records have a certain something that makes them stand out, be it a catchy chorus, a gripping riff or at least a distinctive solo part. This song has none of these elements. It's a very faceless track. It's a useless filler. In my opinion a filler is even worse than a song that really sucks. A bad song manages at least to impress you in a negative way. This faceless filler doesn't even manage to do this. It's completely irrelevant and probably the most unspectacular song ever written by Iron Maiden. \n\nAll in all, this release has two really outstanding tracks that save this album, two good average tunes and four songs that vary between mediocre and utterly useless. I may give the band some credit for the courage that they tried to constantly develop the sound from the previous milestone record to an even mellower and slightly commcerial AOR inspired sound. I might also admit that this album has a certain guiding line in form of a slightly interesting intellectual concept. Apart of the shallow title track, Iron Maiden definitely tried to move on and create something completely new and unique at that time. Still, all these humble intentions can't compensate for a really fluffy and mellow execution that makes this release really hard to sit through for me. I didn't like this album at first contact when I first listened to it over nine years ago and it hasn't grown but probably even decreased in my perception since then. This album is not only a constant candidate for my bottom five records of Iron Maiden but also for my bottom five of the most overrated so-called classics in the history of heavy metal music. I can completely understand why this album was the beginning of the end for Iron Maiden as the band started to fall apart after this release and desperately tried to go back to a heavier and darker sound over the next few records because if the band had continued its journey towards even fluffier sounds, they would probably sound worse than Def Leppard today. If you like AOR or worship anything old school metal heads praise since this is a release from the eighties, you can give this release a spin and follow the masses. If you are looking for solid song writing without any lengths, the fierce energy one could usually expect from a legendary heavy metal band or different exciting approaches and ideas connected to a progressive metal release, you should rather go for Queensr\u00ffche's \"Operation: Mindcrime\" which was released at the same time and which might have a similar concept but which turns out to be much better than this album from an emotional, intellectual, musical and even productional point of view.\n",
        "\n\u201cFear of the Dark\u201d is Iron Maiden\u2019s second best selling record of all times, had quite high chart positions and includes one of the band\u2019s most famous songs ever with the title track which has also become an almost irreplaceable live anthem. Still, this release is often criticized by fans of the band and generally seen as one of the weaker releases. Both positions are partially right.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the negative facts first. Usually, I really like the fact when you get value for money but in this case, the quantity of twelve songs may be more elevated than ever in the band\u2019s career but several tracks also lack quality. Especially the middle section of this album is really weak. \u201cChains of Misery\u201d is the most exchangeable song the band has ever written in my opinion. It has a boring topic, a generic length and above all a lifeless chorus. \u201cThe Apparition\u201d is already more original because it doesn\u2019t have a chorus and is a straighter song. It kicks off promisingly but soon the same pattern is repeated over four minutes. The pale and hectically performed instrumental section even adds to the negative development. Bad song writing leads down an initially interesting idea. \u201cJudas Be My Guide\u201d is better than the other two songs and often pointed out as a hidden gem but only a few melodies have a certain atmosphere while the song structure itself is once again less exciting and build around a chorus that tries too hard to be catchy and retro rock inspired but fails because of its too commercial and generic tone. If this album had been cut down to eight great songs or separated as two short releases, it would have been a strong comeback after the unbalanced back to the roots effort that was \u201cNo Prayer for the Dying\u201d but as it is, \u201cFear of the Dark\u201d is only a slight improvement from there.\n\nThis improvement is largely due to two songs that really stand out among the others. The atmospheric, majestic and passionate title track is one of the very best heavy metal songs in history in my opinion. I\u2019m still getting goose bumps each time I hear the menacing melodies of the epic introduction and I still can\u2019t stand still as soon as the track gets faster and leads to a powerful chorus and an incredible bridge with strong soli and vivid sing along parts. I think I don\u2019t need to mention that the track\u2019s majesty works even better on stage. This song is definitely a masterpiece. In my opinion, \u201cAfraid to Shoot Strangers\u201d comes really close to the title track. I know that both songs have very similar song structures but they are still different enough from each other to be both considered as excellent heavy metal songs. The third song on this release starts in a more melodic and plodding way than the title track and the dark and almost narrative introduction is a strong hint at what would be very present on \u201cThe X-Factor\u201d. The guitar melodies are simply out of this world and mange to touch me each time I listen to them. On the other side, the track gets progressively faster and meaner than the title song and includes fast riffs battling with melodic soli in the outstanding middle part before it goes back to a more harmonious tone to close the circle. This epic track has been my first contact with Iron Maiden and I\u2019m still deeply in love with this tune more than one decade later.\n\nIn between these two stand-out tracks and three of the worst songs ever written by the band, there still is a lot of hit and miss. The guiding line of an effort that would have otherwise sounded like a loose compilation effort as its predecessor is the melodic tone and melancholic atmosphere of several songs. The two stand-out efforts share their atmosphere with the melancholic \u201cChildhood\u2019s End\u201d, the touching half-ballad \u201cWasting Love\u201d which is among the best calmer and more commercial tracks the band has ever written and the majestic \u201cThe Fugitive\u201d which is often ignored but manages to fusion faster and meaner riffs with hopeful melodies and powerful vocals. These three tracks are more than just decent, they are highlights on the record and the reason why this album is not among the weakest of the band in my opinion.\n\nIron Maiden was open for experimentation on the record. From the surprisingly fast, hectic and almost slightly thrash metal ridden opener \u201cBe Quick or Be Dead\u201d to the unusual psychedelic elements and sudden changes of tone and style in \u201cFear is the Key\u201d that took many years to grow on me, Iron Maiden really offers several courageous song writing ideas. The problem is that these songs don\u2019t really fit together on the album and create a very odd flow. This album requests a lot of attention and patience as well as an open-minded attitude towards different forms of rock and metal music to be fully appreciated. Many fans of the band expected the band to return to shorter and more consistent conceptual releases from the past, didn\u2019t give this album a real chance and left it dusting on a shelf over the years. I think these fans should give the record a new chance and re-evaluate it more than twenty-two years later and they might realize that this release is still among the better efforts of the last twenty-five years. \n\nIron Maiden had a lot of interesting and also original song writing ideas and also a few great lyrical inspirations on this release. Maybe the world wasn\u2019t ready for a visionary heavy metal band singing about the deadly consequences of AIDS, childhood poverty in war-ridden territories and a critical analysis of football hooliganism. In my opinion, this lyrical diversity adds a lot to the intellectual charm of the record and shows a band that has matured and didn\u2019t want to repeat itself. \n\nAfter all, I really adore this album despite a few flaws and three weaker tracks in here. The best songs on the album are among the best the band has ever written and several other tracks have either touching melodies, intellectually challenging lyrics or both which makes this record sound mature and fresh at the same time. Despite some hit and miss efforts, this album never gets boring and I regularly listen to it as it includes pretty much everything Iron Maiden stands for from melodic twin guitar solos over extremely atmospheric live anthems and from short crunching heavy metal tracks to more progressive epics. The band has lost this balance of shorter and longer tracks on more recent records which means a significant decrease in quality for me. This album reveals to have a lot more qualities than one might think of. Some fans should re-evaluate this release that ultimately deserved its commercial success and is much more appealing than its reputation.\n",
        "\nIron Maiden, the band all metal-heads, of any sub-genre, can agree is spectacular. Iron Maiden is close to unrivaled their quality, putting out album after album of quality material. Their string of albums between their debut and Seventh Son of a Seventh Son were all but perfect, and for this they've become one of the most important bands in all of heavy metal. Still, some albums have to be better than others, and this is one of their best. Like many 80's bands, they felt that synthesizers were the way of the future, and so on this record they turned to synthesizers, but the results, unlike many other bands, is 100% success, and is experimental, rather than a turn to a more commercial or poppier sound.\n\nSynthesizers are often associated with selling out in the metal-world, and for good reason, they often do symbolize when a band becomes commercial. Fortunately, Iron Maiden doesn't fall into this trap with Somewhere in Time, as this album is through and through metal, it just happens to be metal with a layer of synthesizer on it. In fact, the synthesizer here actually makes the album feel dirtier in many spots, a very odd thing indeed, but mostly the Synthesizer are used for atmospheric affect, and what an atmosphere it creates. This is where the album succeeds mostly, its atmosphere is rivaled by few of any genre, and rivaled by even fewer within the metal genre. \n\nOf course, outside of the synthesizers this isn't too different from a regular Maiden album. The songs still have that familiar Iron Maiden vibe to them, so if you're a fan of other Iron Maiden works, or perhaps you're a new fan who has only heard The Number of the Beast and The Trooper, you won't feel too far from home here. Still, the compositions found here often are more complex than those found on other Iron Maiden records, and with the addition of the synthesizers this give the album an identity of its own. \n\nThe band alternates between truly complex compositions, and relatively straight forward ones. This variation gives even songs that maybe isn't Iron Maiden at their best, their own identity. It also makes you appreciate both the complexity of the more difficult songs, and also the relative conservative nature to the less complicated tunes. The variation of complexity is one of the main things keeping the album from becoming boring.\n\nMost of the songs here are 100% metal, but really catchy. I know I often find myself humming the title track in school, and it's a fairly complex tune. Iron Maiden's ability to make complexity catchy is a rare talent, and that is arguably my favorite thing that this album does. Many bands are complex and, even if they remember to write actual songs, often seem meaningless because of it. Iron Maiden makes catchy tunes and adds layers of complexity on top of those catchy riffs, and this is how the catchy complexity is achieved. \n\nAll the members of Iron Maiden are talented, but I couldn't write a review about Iron Maiden and not mention Bruce Dickinson. Bruce Dickinson, in simple terms, is the Freddie Mercury of heavy metal. That is the only comparison that I feel does justice to him. His voice is the very definition of power. He soars through the bands music, and really gives Iron Maiden a distinct sound (you can tell how much of a difference he made when you listen to the bands 90's works when he left the band).\n\nIn short, this is another great album from Iron Maiden. It is a great combination of real metal and synthesizer. It has a great atmosphere and has a nice balance of complex and simple. Bruce Dickinson's vocals are amazing as usual. It's through and through a great album, and a must for fans of any type of metal. Even if you don't like metal, there isn't anything here decidedly noncommercial and I think would even appeal to many fans of pop music, given that those pop fans posses an open mind. It's really just a great, great album, and my favorite from Iron Maiden.\n",
        "\n\u201cBrave New World\u201d has always been a mixed bag for me. Many songs on the album were still written with Blaze Bayley in the band. If I take into consideration how great Blaze Bayley\u2019s first solo record \u201cSilicon Messiah\u201d turned out to be, I would have adored listening to a record that mixes the best tracks from that solo release and this comeback album with new old members Bruce Dickinson and Adrian Smith in the band. Most fans may disagree but I think a potential third record with Blaze Bayley would have been the better possibility.\n\nAs strange as it may sound, Blaze Bayley\u2019s darker, very emotional and more grounded vocals would have fit better than Bruce Dickinson\u2019s more expressive, high-pitched and theatrical tones on most songs of the record. A good example would be the melancholic ballade \"Blood Brothers\" that sounds a little bit too epic for a thoughtful swansong dedicated to Steve Harris' late father. \"Dream of Mirrors\" is a progressive metal song with a cumbersome atmosphere that could have found its righteous place on the previous release and would have been the best song on that album. I'm really imagining Blaze Bayley's darker and more emotional vocals each time I hear the song and think Bruce Dickinson's vocals sound too forced and strained on this track. Overall, this new record feels as if two worlds collided: the slower, epic and emotional tracks written in cooperation with Blaze Bayley and the more traditional, straighter and faster songs developed with Bruce Dickinson. These two sides don't always fusion well. While Bruce Dickinson performs truly well on the tracks he was involved in, he doesn\u2019t manage to add that certain human and yet magic touch to the songs written without him in the band. \n\nAnother negative point is that I\u2019ve heard the phenomenal live release \u201cRock in Rio\u201d before discovering the studio versions on this album. I must admit that several tracks that build up great atmosphere, electrifying energy and vivid pace on stage sound rather boring on here which may also be due to a rather lifeless production. Especially the longer tunes such as \u201cBrave New World\u201d, \u201cBlood Brothers\u201d and \u201cDream of Mirrors\u201d are lacking a certain kind of energy on the studio release.\n\nOn the positive side, the band\u2019s overall song writing is much more balanced on this release than on several other post-reunion albums like \u201cA Matter of Life and Death\u201d and \u201cThe Final Frontier\u201d. This release includes a few energizing and short hymns such as the powerful opener \u201cThe Wicker Man\u201d or the quite heavy and slightly hysterical \u201cThe Fallen Angel\u201d that add both to the diversity and the flow of the release. One gets a few calmer and laid-back epics that can be seen as transitions from the last record with Blaze Bayley to the new era such as \u201cBrave New World\u201d and \u201cBlood Brothers\u201d. Finally, the band also delivers a couple of more progressive rock and metal infused tracks with long introductions and different promising ideas such as the Middle Eastern folk sounds on \u201cThe Nomad\u201d and the complex yet rocking closer \u201cThe Thin Line Between Love and Hate\u201d. From this point of view, the record never gets too boring. The problem with the last category of songs is that it includes several great instrumental and vocal melodies but that the overall song writing isn\u2019t always concise. What I mean is that several longer tracks on the record are composed of different parts that work well on their own but don\u2019t always seem to fit together. They feel a little bit hectically patched together here and there. These tracks also include a few unnecessary lengths that drag interesting atmospheres on for too long or take out the dynamic elements of a track. In these moments, the band is really losing me and I guess that fans of shorter and more traditional heavy metal songs may feel alike.\n\nAll these reasons lead to a point where I feel slightly confused about this release. I really like Adrian Smith\u2019s signature guitar sound and the use of three different guitar players who are all quite diversified song writers. In general, I also think that Bruce Dickinson still has a phenomenal voice and may even sound better in certain songs on this release than he sounded in the late eighties and early nineties where he started to lack enthusiasm. Now, he is back with a fresh spirit and one really feels that the band put all its heart blood into this release. The song writing is balanced and diversified and the record is very entertaining as it includes shorter tracks that impress quickly and more complex tunes that open up as time goes by. Still, many parts of the release feel patched together in a hurry and don\u2019t always fit together. Several songs already indicate a problem that would get even bigger on the next releases as many tracks include more or less fitting overlong introductions and plodding instrumental parts. The production is also little bit too calm and lifeless for a heavy metal comeback release in my opinion. In the end, the positive elements are still stronger than the negative ones. I must though admit that there is no Iron Maiden release I have listened to less than to this one. I know it\u2019s a solid record but it has somehow become a dust collector in my collection. In Iron Maiden\u2019s extensive and groundbreaking discography, I would categorize this overhyped record as a slightly below average effort. Among the so-called post-reunion records, I clearly prefer both the extremely diversified \u201cDance of Death\u201d and the coherently dark and almost concept-like \u201cA Matter of Life and Death\u201d to this album.\n",
        "\nBack in the fall season of 1984, the new crop of 1980s heavy metal scene was still pretty much in its early stages. Yet, a band like Iron Maiden seemed to be the old established pioneers by this point. Much like the 1970s, rock music evolved similarly quickly with every new and passing year in the 1980s. The early 1980s was an attempt by nearly every signed artist to move away from the sounds of the 70s and make things harder and louder, or if you were on the other side of the dial, more electronic and filled with synthesizers. The 1980s started with bands like AC/DC, Iron Maiden and Motley Crue, and while all of these bands had a different style of heavy metal music, they all had the rebellion thing going on. By the end of the 1980s, bands like Guns and Roses and Skid Row capitalized that on the fact that the 70s were cool, and to a point they incorporated the sound into their music, especially G N\u2019 R. This lead to the throwback bands of the 90s like Black Crows, Counting Crows, Lenny Kravitz and Blues Traveler, who thought that they can reproduce the Me Decade while the subculture of grunge suddenly became the popular culture, and nearly ruined music as we know it. \n\nBassist Steve Harris has been the main songwriter of Iron Maiden since the beginning. By the time Powerslave, their 5th album came out, he had written half of the eight tracks. While lead singer Bruce Dickinson and guitarist Adrian Smith have nudged their way onto the album, Harris\u2019 songs still manage to steal the spotlight. His best effort here is the opener Aces High, a real heavy metal crowd pleaser that breaks all speed limits and is a blast to sing along to. It is the perfect song for the live setting. The lyrics are again about war, this time from the perspective as if from the cockpit of a fighter jet. 2 Minutes to Midnight, written by Dickinson and Smith is considered to be the companion song to Aces High, much like Queen\u2019s We Will Rock You and We Are the Champions. 2 Minutes to Midnight is six minutes of excellence, coming very close to the brilliance of Aces High. The lyrics again tackle the subject of war, and more specifically the threat of war, referencing the doomsday clock put in place by scientists in the late 1940s. Two minutes to midnight is the closest the clock has ever been set. \n\nThe band in keeping with the now tradition of including some instrumental tracks on each album, included one for the Powerslave album, Losfer Words (Big \u2018Orra). The song sounds as if was written on the bass, and since it was written by Harris it is likely. The instrumental sounds like it would make good incidental music for some cool Iron Maiden footage. Perhaps some stoners have already played Powerslave while turning the volume down low to It\u2019s a Wonderful Life and noticed how the audio and video gel so well. I can see the old pharmacist beating the heck out of the young George Bailey right now to this song. Anyway it makes for a good long intro for Flash of the Blade as they have almost the exact same groove. Flash was written by Dickinson alone giving the listener a good impersonation of Rob Halford and Judas Priest. The Duelists again steals the same groove as the last two songs; luckily Steve Harris added a contrasting melody line for the lyrics. The chorus is very catchy despite the song\u2019s abundant length. \n\nTo my ears, Bruce Dickinson sounds a heck of a lot like Liza Minnelli on the song Back in the Village. It\u2019s that pretentious vibrato he owns. Sometimes it comes across as cabaret sounding; hence this is not the best track on the album by far. The title track Powerslave was written by Dickinson and the lyrics were the inspiration of the ancient Egypt-looking album cover, featuring the sphinx in Eddie\u2019s image. The last track Rime of the Ancient Mariner is the longest track by Iron Maiden, nearly giving Pink Floyd\u2019s Echoes a run for its money. The song goes through a few twists and turns, sounding more like three songs than one. The middle part that features the slow bass is simply hypnotizing as poetry is read aloud. \n\nI believe that Powerslave outshines Piece of Mind by a tad, as is therefore my favorite Maiden album. I like witnessing the progression of Maiden\u2019s greatness growing with each and every release. Powerslave made concrete what Piece of Mind had suggested\u2026that Maiden was here to stay and a force to be reckoned with in the world of heavy metal.\n",
        "\nImagine \u201cThe X-Factor\u201d with a straighter live production and Bruce Dickinson on vocals and you get \u201cA Matter of Life and Death\u201d which includes mostly depressing and lengthy mid-tempo tracks about war and other sinister topics. As I am a person who likes to dive into darker territories, I adore the almost constantly bleak atmosphere on this release. One of the best examples on here is the dynamical \u201cThese Colours Don\u2019t Run\u201d with an incredibly vivid bass guitar and drum work as well as an epic bridge with sing along parts. It\u2019s also worth mentioning the brutal yet majestic \u201cBrighter Than A Thousand Suns\u201d that varies from extremely heavy riffs to almost psychedelic sounds and back again. \u201cFor the Greater Good of God\u201d is more melodic and features decent orchestrations that give the track an elegant and mature touch.\n\nDespite several great songs, the record also has its negative sides. Most people might disagree but I think that Blaze Bayley\u2019s sinister, technically limited but incredibly emotional voice added a lot to the atmosphere on \u201cThe X-Factor\u201d. Bruce Dickinson is definitely the better singer from a technical point of view but his theatrical high-pitched vocals don\u2019t always fit to this kind of music and topic. The worst example is probably \u201cThe Longest Day\u201d which is a song about D-Day which starts in a very bleak and promising way. Then, the high-pitched pre-chorus and chorus sound so happy that it feels inappropriate and odd to me. These vocals scrap the brilliant build-up in the introduction and verses. A darker and more grounded voice would have easily improved the final result.\n\nAnother issue is the song writing and the length of the album. Some tracks have really great calmer introductions that add to the atmosphere but in total, seven out of ten tracks have introductions that are stretched to almost three minutes in the worst cases. That\u2019s how an initially interesting idea gets repeated to death and finally becomes very boring and predictable. Especially the second half of the release suffers from that. \u201cThe Legacy\u201d is for example one of my least favourite songs of the band in general and I rarely manage to listen to it from the beginning to the end. It\u2019s definitely the weakest album closer ever delivered by the band. The strange, numb and hypnotizing \u201cLord of Light\u201d took several years to grow a little bit on me. Today, I think it\u2019s a good average tune with a gripping atmosphere and some original ideas but it doesn\u2019t always feel structured and could have been much better with more consistent and shorter song writing. Even a few shorter songs include unnecessary lengths. The power ballad \u201cOut of the Shadows\u201d is a nice melodic track and would have been an example for consistent song writing if the song had ended after three minutes and a half. Instead of doing so, the band added a boring instrumental bridge just to repeat the chorus one more time. I\u2019m sorry but the last two minutes really ruined an otherwise interesting tune to me.\n\nThis is why the few shorter and actually consistent tracks stand positively out to me. \u201cDifferent World\u201d sounds a little bit too similar to \u201cRainmaker\u201d and is only a good average opener but in the context of the entire album, this song feels really fresh and dynamical. \u201cThe Pilgrim\u201d is even better with its oriental sounds that hark back to \u201cThe Nomad\u201d six years earlier. I\u2019ve always thought that \u201cThe Nomad\u201d was artificially stretched and one of the less memorable tracks on its album and I really prefer the shorter and more energizing \u201cThe Pilgrim\u201d where Bruce Dickinson\u2019s joyous and skilled vocals probably fit best on the record as well.\n\nIn the end, \u201cA Matter of Live and Death\u201d is neither among Iron Maiden\u2019s greatest nor among their worst releases. It\u2019s a quite good average effort with a consistent atmosphere and vivid production on one side and a few overlong and repetitive tracks with too joyous vocals on the other. We still have to take into consideration that we are talking about Iron Maiden which is maybe the most influential heavy metal band in the world. Hands down, in almost any other band\u2019s discography, this would be a career highlight but if we compare it to other efforts of the British legends, this album can\u2019t entirely convince me. It\u2019s surely a great and almost concept-like release for those who don\u2019t like Blaze Bayley\u2019s vocals but the general feeling and idea behind \u201cThe X-Factor\u201d because this is pretty much what you get here.\n",
        "\nIn my humble opinion, \"Dance of Death\" is my very favourite and in general the most underrated Iron Maiden record since Bruce Dickinson and Adrian Smith rejoined the band in 1999. To my negative surprise, not only fans seem to consider this a flawed release but even Bruce Dickinson talked about it in a very negative and egoistic way by claiming that he had to hit very high and artificially sounding notes. Apart of the slightly strained vocal efforts, the flawed production is criticized as well as a supposedly uncoherent song writing that consists of eleven mostly overlong tracks that have no clear guiding line.\n\nObviously, I tend to disagree. The epic tracks have a warmer and softer production which builds up an interesting contrast to the more melancholic tone of several pieces while the shorter and straighter tracks sound raw and dirty like they should be. I really like the overall production of this record. The vocals might go to the limits but not only in a technical way the singer complains about but also in an emotional way. The vocals definitely grab your attention from the beginning to the end and I happen to find them very moving and emotion has always been more important to me in arts than technical perfection. In my opinion, this record also has a clear guiding line because it has a constant melancholic, longing and epic touch. The only exception is the opener \"Wildest Dreams\" where the vocals are longing but the instrumental work rather feels like a straight rock 'n roll track. On the other side, this track is the first single and opener of the record and it doesn't surprise that the band prefers to kick off the album on a more gripping and catchier note. The band has done this before, in particular on the two previous records and nobody should be surprised about this kind of idea anymore.\n\nThe rest of the album is though perfectly consistent. \"Rainmaker\" may be the shortest tune on here but it has a melancholic vocal effort, longing and soaring melodies and a great epic instrumental section with emotional guitar solos and catchy melodies. Since this effort, the band's song writing decreased as Iron Maiden didn't manage to write a similarly profound short song on any of the next records. The real highlights on here are the epic songs in my opinion. The emotionally diversified \"Dance of Death\" is a mixture of classic heavy metal song writing, a vivid folk tune and majestic classical elements. In addition to this, lyrics and music go hand in hand and develop a gripping piece of occult yarn. This song goes straight back to the band's greatest epics from the eighties. \"Paschendale\" is just as great but for different reasons. It's a dark epic with hypnotizing melodies and vocals that interchange with truly dramatic and passionate parts. Iron Maiden has written so many songs about war but this here is the band's most authentic and atmospheric rendition in my opinion. This track manages to transport you mentally to the blood-red battlefields of World War One. In addition to this, the lines \"Cruelty has a human heart - Every man does play his part - Terror of the men we kill - The human heart is hungry still\" are one of the most emotional and poetic lyrics by the band as they are at least partially inspired by the great poet William Blake. Last but not least, we get the band's most creative ballad ever with the outstanding and melancholic \"Journeyman\" that mixes elegant classical elements with a hopeful campfire atmosphere combined with one of Bruce Dickinson's very best vocal performances. It's a surprising piece of music coming from a heavy metal band and proves that Iron Maiden can still innovate the genre it partially pioneered in the twenty-first century.\n\nDespite its clear guiding line, this album remains always open for experiments that should please to any dedicated Iron Maiden fan. One on side, this record includes the straight \"Monts\u00e9gur\" which is probably the most aggressive song the band has ever written. Still, the song doesn't sound stupidly brutal but comes around with amazing twin guitar solos and a desperate chorus that crowns a diversified and emotional vocal effort. On the other side, this release offers some of the band's calmest and most mature tracks that could easily come from a progressive rock album. \"Age Of Innocence\" is a great example as its lyrics and vocals keep sending shivers down my spine. It's not the kind of song that will convince at first contact but steadily grow with each spin and this is what makes a really clever song writing. Finally, even the few who are still living in the past and expecting a return to the band's records of the mid-eighties, may find a song that feels like a perfect blueprint of a classic heavy metal epic. This song is called \"No More Lies\" and despite it's retro touch, it can fully convince because it actually beats many of the originals which inspired this anthem. From the first seconds on, the band comes around with amazing melodies as well as a profound and melancholic atmosphere. The chorus is simple yet the most powerful refrain the band has written in years. The real highlight of this spectacular heavy metal epic blueprint is the instrumental middle section where we get to hear one amazing guitar solo after another. Hands down, this song includes some of the most emotional and vivid heavy metal guitar solos ever written. Even after several dozen spins, I can't stand still to this track and feel the need to get in motion, to play air guitar and to sing along to this masterpiece. This may not be the most original song writing but definitely one of the most emotional ones. Again, emotions are more important for me than technical abilities.\n\nEven the few weaker tracks like the melodic retro rock track \"Gates Of Tomorrow\" or the calm progressive rock song \"Face In The Sand\" have grown on me as time went by. Today, I can't find any single weak track on this record. There are only good to excellent songs on this release that represents very well Iron Maiden's career as it goes back to almost any sound and style the band had already tried out in its career without forgetting about some original innovations and a very own and coherent melancholic atmosphere. This nearly perfect mixtures put this record above several other milestones of the eighties that had a huge impact on the genre but that still had some sympathetic flaws and a couple of fillers. If this record had been released between \"Powerslave\" and \"Somewhere in Time\", it would definitely be considered as one of the band's legendary early masterpieces and get the well-deserved praise it didn't get in the beginning of the new millennium. Those who listened to the album once or twice and forgot it somewhere as a dust collector on a shelf, should grab this contemporary masterpiece of heavy metal music, give it a few more spins and re-evaluate this criminally underrated album that may be the greatest heavy metal record of the new millennium.\n",
        "\nThis is quite hard to find nowadays as it seems to be out of print, but if you ever manage to track a copy down, buy it pronto. This is a veritable feast of live material and studio B-sides from the greatest heavy metal band ever, so what's not to like?\n\nThere are three albums in this box set. BBC Sessions, which contains live recordings from the Radio 1 Rock Show in 1979, Reading Festival 1980, Reading Festival again two years later, and the 1988 Donington Monsters Of Rock headline set. Beast Over Hammersmith, a live recording from London's Hammersmith Odeon on the 1982 tour for Number Of The Beast, and Best Of The B Sides which collects the various odds and sods Maiden have put on the flipside of their singles over the years along with some unreleased material.\n\nThe main reason to get this box set is for Beast Over Hammersmith. This album deserves a standalone release, because it's just PHENOMENAL. Maiden have a well-deserved reputation as a great live band but even by their usual standard this show is off the scale. Bruce Dickinson had only relatively recently joined the band and he absolutely gives it his all - this is perhaps the greatest performance he's ever put on tape. He sounds manic, almost possessed and hits some absolutely unearthly screams during the higher parts of the songs. The rest of the band are no slouches either. The energy level is absolutely insane - I don't think I've heard many bands ever come close to this level of intensity in their live performances. With a setlist solely from the first three albums, you can't go wrong here and many of the performances on this album are THE definitive versions of these songs [the rendition of \"Killers\" is particularly good, as is a version of \"Transylvania\" which is extended in length with some seriously jaw-dropping guitar improvisation]. Only \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\" is not up to scratch here - it's better than the timid studio version but it's still not developed into the rip-roaring live monster it would become in later years. This is one of the best live documents ever released.\n\nThe other two albums pale in comparison to Hammersmith, but they're mostly good fun. BBC Sessions does what it says on the tin. The Di'Anno line-up performances are interesting although not essential, but for any Maiden fan they're enjoyable. The Reading 1982 set is another good performance but it's not quite up to the standard of Hammersmith. \n\nHowever the Donington 1988 recording is a let down. Maiden's live performances went downhill in the 80s in intensity [until Janick revitalised them when he joined the band]. The 7th Son tour was by Maiden standards almost pedestrian in energy and performance levels, especially when compared to the manic intensity of Hammersmith, although as the Maiden England release showed the band could still put on a good live show despite the drop-off. But the Donington show isn't good. It's an inexcusable low point. The band don't sound like they're on it at all, and in some places they're clearly struggling to hold it together, especially Bruce. It sounds like the enormity of the occasion just got to them. By Maiden's standards of performance it's deeply lacking. Strangely, this box set therefore represents the peak and nadir of Maiden's live show in the 80s.\n\nThe B-Sides album is fun, although it doesn't contain that much in the way of outstanding moments. Of interest are some of the early Maiden tunes, such as \"Burning Ambition\" which was one of the first songs Harris wrote for the band. However a lot of the B-sides seem to be either novelty joke tracks like \"The Sheriff Of Huddersfield\", which are entertaining but don't have much replay value, or cover songs. Some of these covers sound OK, but Maiden's sound generally isn't that well suited to cover other bands' material, so a fair few of these songs aren't something you'll listen to that much. There's also one track called \"Reach Out\" from the mid-80s era which may or may not be a cover [I can't recall] but is flat out terrible regardless. The highlights here, perhaps unexpectedly, are from the Bayley era - The X Factor was one of the very few times Maiden recorded a surplus of material for an album, and two of the outtakes are presented here, \"Justice Of The Peace\" and \"Judgement Day\". While I'm not sure either song is up to the uniformly high standards of the material on The X Factor, they're both certainly good tunes [\"Justice Of The Peace\" has the makings of being a ferocious rocker, but the chorus isn't quite right]. It's a little odd that the other X Factor outtake \"I Live My Way\" isn't included here though.\n\nSo overall, an astoundingly good live album, a collection of BBC live and session recordings that range from very good to shoddy, and an assortment of odds and sods with a few gems buried in it. If it wasn't for the Hammersmith recording I'd hesitate to fully recommend this as a must-have, but Beast Over Hammersmith is officially available nowhere else, so if you see this on sale anywhere, buy it.\n",
        "\nThis isn't my favorite by Maiden, but it is runner-up. This is one of Maiden's most consistent albums, and therefore is one of my favorites. None of this album is bad, and only a chunk is even average. Obviously, some of this is excellent. All of Side A and the final song are great and necessary. The band performances are as good as they'd ever be, and the music itself is very catchy. \n\nThis album is a concept album, and I find it appropriate to start with that aspect. As far as they go, this is done pretty well. It's better than Mindcrime or Nosferatu, and it obliterates Nostradamus. The idea is particularly similar to the last. This is essentially about a seer and his life, it's successes, discoveries, and eventual end. I feel Maiden manages to convey the gravity of all of this, without losing their usual catchiness. The production and atmosphere are quite good as well, and they convey a sense of eeriness throughout. The cover does throw me however. I don't know what it's really going for, and it's not one of my favorite covers by them. \n\nThe guitar playing on here is very good. Adrian was pretty much peaking around this time, and Dave was as good as ever. All the soloing is very good and melodic. Admittedly, I often prefer heavier playing, but for a lighter mood, Maiden works great. The rhythm work is good as well, but the bounce in their playing gives it a bit of a hard-rock flavor at times. This isn't really a problem, but it is something to note. This was around the time that they integrated synthesizers into their sound, so the whole sound is very mellow compared to some other bands from this time. This is not heavy playing. Honestly, this is probably a pretty strong influence on more keyboard-driven continental metal. Again, this isn't necessarily a problem, I just feel it needs to be noted. The bass playing isn't as prominent during this time. I feel that this album and the previous are a little more guitar-driven than before. Steve is still very audible, but he's not as dominant as he was on Number or Piece. The drumming is its normal above-average, but no more. Bruce is a great vocalist, and he really Shines on The Evil That Men Do. It's a great song, partially because of his excellent singing. He's obviously still great elsewhere.\n\nAs to the quality, the first three songs on Side B aren't as strong as the rest. They aren't bad, but they don't work as well. Prophecy and Clairvoyant are necessary for the story, but musically feel similar to the the first two songs. They're not bad, but they don't work as well as their counterparts. The epic title track isn't bad, it just takes a little too long to get going. The soloing is very good, but it ends up feeling a little like pieces from elsewhere thrown together. I almost never listen to it. The rest of the album is excellent with Evil That Men Do being my favorite. It's not one of their top five, but that just speaks to Maiden's quality.\n\nThis album is one of the better early metal albums. This is a bit forward looking, in that it's pretty much a slower version of the keyboard stuff that grew to dominate the Continent a decade later. That will dictate how you will enjoy this album. I'm not huge on that stuff, but I do enjoy a certain amount of European power metal. If you hate power metal, you probably won't enjoy this. The groups I would recommend this to are power, prog, and early metal fans, in that order.\n",
        "\nFor quite some time, I hesitated to buy the re-release of Iron Maiden\u2019s \u201cMaiden England\u201d live set that had been recorded back in 1988 in support of the studio record \u201cSeventh Son of a Seventh Son\u201d and was first released in 1989. I had several reasons to do so. First of all, I\u2019m not at all a fan of rehashed old material. Instead of spending their time on re-releasing old material and play numerous concerts in the key of that old tour, I would like Iron Maiden to work on some decent new material. Their last studio output \u201cThe Final Frontier\u201d was lukewarm and already released four years ago. Comparable bands like Loudness show how to release decent material each year or at least every second year while still playing energizing live shows all around the globe. Another reason for me to avoid buying \u201cMaiden England \u201888\u201d was that Iron Maiden had already released multiple more or less relevant live albums and that I have got several of them in my precious collection. Could that new live record really mess with \u201cLive After Death\u201d, \u201cRock In Rio\u201d or \u201cFlight 666\u201d for example? The third reason that made me hesitate for a while is that this live record supports the \u201cSeventh Son of a Seventh Son\u201d release. For many fans, this release is an all-time classic or even the best Iron Maiden record but that\u2019s not my case. I always thought that its concept was pretentious and superficial and I still have my problems with the overlong title track \u201cSeventh Son of a Seventh Son\u201d or filler material like \u201cThe Prophecy\u201d or \u201cOnly The Good Die Young\u201d. Finally, I saw this record for a good price and decided to give the two discs that also include three bonus tracks for the first time a shot.\n\nI must admit that I was completely blown away by the excellent live sound, the great and energizing instrumental performance and the unchained vocals by Bruce Dickinson. Even the crowd did a good job even though they still can\u2019t mess with fans from Latin America. But you really hear that the band feels well to play in its home country and gives its very best. Apart of these positive impressions, the set list of this concert was simply unbeatable. Of course, it includes the usually and very well played classics like the punk driven anthem \u201cIron Maiden\u201d, the atmospheric and dark \u201cThe Number of the Beast\u201d or the emotionally driven epic \u201cHallowed Be Thy Name\u201d. \n\nThe band also played a few rare classics that I like quite a lot. I must point out the passionate performance of the fast paced \u201cThe Prisoner\u201d with the more epic, melodic and relaxing chorus which is one of my favourite songs from \u201cThe Number of the Beast\u201d. The menacing and sinister \u201cKillers\u201d with its impressive bass guitar driven opening minute works even better live than on the original album. The atmospheric and transcendant \u201cStill Life\u201d which is my favourite song on \u201cPiece of Mind\u201d fits well to the calmer songs from \u201cSeventh Son of a Seventh Son\u201d.\n\nTo my very positive surprise the songs from \u201cSeventh Son of a Seventh Son\u201d work a lot better on stage than in studio for me. Especially the diversified soft progressive metal milestone \u201cInfinite Dreams\u201d are absolutely essential in its organic live version. Even weaker songs in my opinion like the more sophisticated and conceptual \u201cMoonchild\u201d work better on here and this certain track really kicks off the concert on a positive note that mixes the much needed energy with thought out atmosphere. Iron Maiden simply deliver an outstanding powerhouse performance and it\u2019s great that they have focused on a few more original songs which are rarely played live and decided to leave out classics like \u201cThe Trooper\u201d for example.\n\nThe three bonus tracks \u201cRunning Free\u201d, \u201cSanctuary\u201d and \u201cRun to the Hills\u201d are a lot less essential than the rest. Their production and especially the few moments of silence between these tracks in comparison to the fluid recording of the other fifteen songs don\u2019t please me at all. On the other side, these bonus tracks are a nice gimmick for collectors who have bought the VHS version of this concert twenty-five years ago and want a little extra. That\u2019s why we shouldn\u2019t judge the band all too hard and see these three bonus songs as a little gift and nice attention.\n\nIn the end, I finally did the right choice to purchase this double live record. The performance of the band is healthy, passionate and technically diversified. Especially the rarely played tracks make this release a true highlight. Of course, this record can\u2019t beat \u201cLive after Death\u201d but it\u2019s easily on the same level as \u201cRock in Rio\u201d or \u201cFlight 666\u201d for example. That\u2019s why not only collectors and die-hard fans should get this release but also occasional Iron Maiden fans. Up the Irons!\n\nOriginally written for The Metal Observer\n",
        "\nI don't get it. Why do people regard this album so highly? I've even heard from some that this is the greatest metal albums of all time. This album, excluding a few classic tracks, all blends together into a gallopy mess. Iron Maiden is my favorite metal band, and you can't imagine how much it hurts me to have negative things to say about an Iron Maiden record. But alas, I must go on.\n\nEven though I dislike this album, that doesn't mean it doesn't have some bright spots. This record does include \"Aces High,\" \"2 Minutes to Midnight,\" and the title track, three Maiden classics. \"Aces High\" is a staple in the Iron Maiden repertoire, a true metal gem. With an amazing riff and anthemic chorus, coupled with Nicko McBrain's sick fills, \"Aces High\" is a truly epic metal tune that vividly illustrates the intensity of a high flying dogfight. The other classic Maiden tune that graces \"Powerslave\" is \"2 Minutes to Midnight,\" a straight up catchy rocker that will you get your foot tapping and your head banging. You can't help but air guitar to this sweet tune. With an unforgettable main riff and catchy hook, \"2 Minutes to Midnight,\" will be stuck in your head for days. The title track is a throwback to ancient Egypt, to a land of pyramids and pharaohs. With amazing vocals by the impeccable Bruce Dickinson and a guitar riff that King Ramesses II would write if he was handed a guitar, this track kills. To top it all of, the track is slowed down in the middle to allow for a mellow yet powerful guitar solo, only to speed back up again to allow Adrian Smith and Dave Murray to really let loose and flaunt their soloing skills. Even further adding to the atmosphere, Bruce Dickinson sings with conviction and grit, making him at times seem like a powerful pharaoh, ruling over his people.\n\nNow that we have gotten the exceptions out of the way, let's get to the meat and potatoes of this bore fest. I'm gonna come out and say it: this album is mediocre at best. Most of the tracks on this record are uninspired and overrated beyond belief. I feel that all of the songs after the epic \"Aces High\" and \"2 Minutes to Midnight,\" are just filler leading up to \"Powerslave,\" the album's title track, which in my opinion is the only decently good song left on the album after the two aforementioned classics on the record. I feel that when they were writing this album, Adrian Smith, Steve Harris, and Dave Murray got a little obsessed with the gallop. It's used so much that it becomes tiresome quite quickly, and it causes songs to blend together, making them only distinguishable by the melodic guitar parts. I'd like to specifically mention the 13 minute \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\" This song drags on way too long, and again overuses the gallop, even though it would have been more enjoyable at a 5 minute running time. I personally have a hard time digesting such a long, drawn out song. Oh, and I haven't even gotten to the section of \"Rime,\" where Dickinson just whispers over some clich\u00e9 accoustic meandering. Not even Dickinson's legendary singing could rescue this song that's too long for its own good. With the immense amount of galloping and indistinguishable tracks, the praise this album receives puzzles me.\n\nTo sum it up, this album very much disappointed me. Not because it's a terrible album, but because it's only decent, and I know that Iron Maiden is capable of much more. When compared to the Maiden monoliths that are \"The Number of the Beast,\" \"Somewhere in Time,\" and \"Piece of Mind,\" this album just falls short of the Iron Maiden standard.\n",
        "\nIron Maiden have been making consistently great music since Bruce Dickinson and Adrian Smith returned to the fold in 1999. After the mixed-bag albums they released in the 90s, this was the much needed boost for the band to kick serious arse once again. Often, when bands reunite with 'classic' members and/or they declare a return to their roots, the music they put together in celebration of this is often quite derivative, and therefore usually bland. With Iron Maiden, there is just as much passion and talent shown in recent albums as in their classic output. A Matter of Life and Death is definitely no exception, and is probably the best of the post-Blaze albums.\n\nStarting with the first \"reunion\" album, Brave New World, the band have gone in a more progressive direction, with the average song lasting longer, some typically lasting between 7-9 minutes. 6 out of the 10 songs on A Matter of Life and Death are in this length range. It's not often that a band is capable of releasing an album with songs of this length where the listener is able to get through it all. However, A Matter of Life and Death is full of great composition and songwriting all the way through. The band have shown off some impressive guitar harmonics and riffs ever since they became a six-piece, three-guitarist band. Bruce Dickinson can still hit some of the very high notes, and this album is clear evidence of that. The songs themselves are just as emotional and daring as the band always have been. Although they have perhaps never changed their style as drastically as some of their contemporaries (e.g. Judas Priest) have, you can hardly say Iron Maiden are \"playing it safe\" these days, especially when their two most recent albums (this and The Final Frontier) are the two longest studio albums in their career. They still seem to be high in musical and lyrical ideas, which is more than you can say for most other bands their age.\n\nThematically, many of the album's songs center lyrically around religion, as well as war and the suffering that comes as a consequence, although it is not strictly a concept album. These themes however are clearly represented on the album cover. The atmosphere that the music creates is also darker than Brave New World or Dance of Death, which I felt had a few songs between them that wouldn't sound out of place on an 80s Maiden album. \"Different World\", the opener for this album, is the only track that I feel that way about on this album. Of course, as I've said, it's usually good for a band not to retrace their steps, but rather to move forward and progress with their sound, no matter how far they are into their career. That is precisely what they do, and they do it better than most.\n\nSeveral changing time signatures and tempos are present, and \"Brighter Than A Thousand Suns\" is a good example of the band making a use of these. It starts off with slow, steady drums and guitars which eventually launch into a galloping beat with speedy riffing halfway through, which creates an apocalyptic mood fitting with the lyrical theme of nuclear warfare. It's also one of the album's strongest tracks. Another good example is closing track \"The Legacy\", a song which discusses the questionable legacy of men going out to war and some of them needlessly dying in battle, and the emotional impact on those who were part of those soldiers' lives. It starts off acoustically, but builds up to a full band assault as Bruce continues to sing with heavy emotion addressing a man lying on his deathbed. The honestly is brutal, and well, so is the music. It is perhaps the best song on the album.\n\nProduction wise, the album does just fine. In fact, it was not mastered with any EQ or compression enhancements so that it would carry more of a live sound. This was a smart decision to make as you can hear much of the raw energy from the band, which is fitting for a rather dark album, as it fully allows the passion and emotion to be revealed to the listener, in a way. As well as that, many of the takes used on the album were first takes, which eradicates the chances of the band's playing sounding forced to the listener, or Bruce's voice having less passion and emotion in his delivery, which may come as a result as doing too many takes of the same song. I did, notice, however, in \"Brighter Than A Thousand Suns\" some problems in the volume of Bruce's vocals, with a few very tiny parts sounding a little too quiet. However, it is no big deal and does little to affect the quality of the song as a whole.\n\nI should hope that in time, A Matter of Life and Death will be seen as one of the greatest heavy metal albums to come out of its decade. Its length may understandably seem off-putting at first, but hopefully within 2 or 3 tracks, any fears that the listener has of the album being too long for its own good should go away. It's the band's best work since their 80s output. Brave New World and Dance of Death are definitely not far behind in terms of quality, but this album just simply tops both of them and should be hailed as one of Iron Maiden's greatest achievements, and a great addition to their legacy.\n",
        "\nIron Maiden. We know 'em, we love 'em, and they helped heavy metal gain momentum in the '80s. To say that this band is one of the best would be a total understatement. Their complex guitar riffs and hooks have put them on the map and have made them one of the most successful bands ever to grace the earth. After touring for \"Powerslave\", though, Maiden decided to do some musical experimenting. The result was \"Somewhere in Time\", an album unlike anything Maiden had done before. Unlike experiments from other bands at the time, Maiden's was a huge success, and is a favorite among some of its fans. It's not my personal favorite album, but I can see why they like it.\n\nWhat's this? Is that a synthesizer?? It is! It's a synthesizer on an Iron Maiden album! But how could this be? How come it doesn't ruin the music? Could it be that it's trying to convey the tone and the mood of the album rather than trying to make it sound glossy and slick? The answer is yes, cos good old Steve Harris and company want to use it to make actual music, not money. Instead of drowning out the guitars, it serves as a perfect backdrop for them, and they set the stage for a mystifying, yet majestic sound. The guitars give that sound a boost, but more on them later. Most bands who use the synthesizer use it to give their music a futuristic pop sound that they hope the general public (i.e. high school cheerleaders) would eat right up. You don't get that here. Instead, the synthesizer only supplements the awesome power of the music rather than trying to be the music itself.\n\nThe synthesizer isn't the only small change that Maiden made to their sound. Unlike their previous works, the guitar riffs on this album are catchy, but they're not forgettable and annoying like songs from other bands. No, this is Dave and Adrian we're talking about here, and they've clearly put some effort into making those riffs (like they usually do). Their dual-guitar harmonics are also evident and are also catchy, especially on \"Deja Vu\" and \"Caught Somewhere in Time\". \"Deja Vu\", in particular, is my personal favorite track on the album. Its dual-guitar harmonics and melodic riffs make it epic, yet mysterious-sounding, almost frightening, and it doesn't need a ripping solo to do the job! \"Sea of Madness\" and the all-time classic \"Wasted Years\" show that the choruses are catchy too. Yet instead of repeating the song's title over and over to try and get the song jammed into people's heads, they are poetic and creative and they deliver a perfect message. \n\nDespite doing some bold experimentation on this album, the changes Iron Maiden have made are tiny, and they didn't really affect their sound at all. In fact, they actually punctuated the album's sound and have made the music more dramatic than Maiden's previous efforts. They have created an amazing album as usual, and it helped push their career further on for twenty more years.\n",
        "\nI own this album as part of the reissue with 'A Real Live One', obviously titled 'A Real Live Dead One'. These albums are listed separately here on the Metal Archives, so I have to review each disc as an individual album. No problem really. These 2 albums were recorded and released in the early 90's (92/93 to be precise). This is the time period after Adrian Smith had left and right before Bruce Dickinson departed too. The band hadn't released a live album since 85's monumental classic 'Live After Death'. \n\nThis double album was made up of recordings from all over Europe, offering a vast and expansive setlist covering a mighty 24 tracks. This isn't a typical live release as there doesn't appear to be any real running order, nor does it really represent an actual setlist (I don't think so anyway), so it is more of a live compilation. The 2 separate albums (or discs in my case) don't overlap tracks, just a random selection of presumably the best recordings of each track on this particular touring period. 'Dead One' has more of a focus on older material 80-84, 'Live One' is more recent material 86-92 and that's about the only distinction between them.\n\nNow, onto 'A Real Dead One' itself. As I mentioned this focuses on older songs and as such you get a lot of Di'Anno era songs here. More so than any other Maiden live album. I think this is brilliant, as although I'm not a massive fan of the Di'Anno albums I can certainly appreciate them. Bruce's voice brings new life to already decent songs and unfortunately these days the number of old songs in the setlist is diminishing more and more. I think every Maiden live album gives us the song \"Iron Maiden,\" and a lot have both \"Running Free\" and \"Sanctuary.\" The beauty of this album is it also gives us \"Prowler,\" \"Transylvania\" and \"Remember Tomorrow,\" songs the band simply don't play anymore. Bruce sounds great on these tracks, even joking that he's never sung \"Transylvania\" before and isn't likely to (it's instrumental!)\n\nOther standard live tracks on here include \"The Trooper,\" \"Number of the Beast,\" \"Run to the Hills\" and \"Hallowed Be Thy Name.\" All performed very well, but if you own all or most Maiden live releases it's nothing new or surprising. \"2 Minutes to Midnight\" is one of those tracks that sometimes they play, sometimes they don't. Aside from being one of my favourites, it's also nice to not hear it on every single live album. But the real gem here is \"Where Eagles Dare,\" which off the top of my head I don't recall being on any other live album. Brilliant track perfectly executed here and a nice surprise. \n\nSo we've got a very strong setlist of classic early to mid 80's Maiden, well played by the early 90's lineup. The musicianship of Maiden can never be questioned, all top notch. I've read interviews with Steve Harris criticising Bruce at the time, saying there were times when his performances were lacking because he was about to leave the band. This isn't evident here, Bruce sounds fantastic, he involves the crowd at all times and sounds like a consummate professional. Ok, they cherry-picked the best performances for this but it doesn't sound like there's any turmoil in the band based on this album.\n\nOne other point, this is mixed amazingly well. The songs are all recorded in different cities, but have been mixed to flow into each other as if it was a real show. If you didn't read the booklet you'd think Maiden simply wanted to play an old school set here. Great stuff, very impressive.\n\nI think the only way to buy this album now is the double album 'A Real Live Dead One', I'll review the other disc of that some other time but trust me it's good! What you're getting here is undoubtedly the most varied Maiden live offering with a great selection of songs and the best versions of them from the tour. All top quality stuff and worth having for any old school Iron Maiden fan. Classic songs, great live performances, a singer on top form, it's all here. I strongly recommend this album.\n",
        "\nIron Maiden have been one of my favourite bands for a long time, on of the first metal bands i got into and i've never gone off them. I decided to review this album first as it was the one i listened to most recently. i love Brave New World, the album that really got me into Maiden and so i had high hopes for this follow up. This isn't as good as BNW but is better than the 2 albums they've done since. I'd say BNW is as good if not better than the 80's classics, whereas i'd put this album somewhere in the middle, better than the 90's albums at least. \n\nThis is the only Maiden album with writing contributions from every member, even Nicko gets in on the act! Maiden always had a progressive edge but it was usually restricted to just one or 2 tracks per album. This album is probably where the progressive side starts to come out more. The title track and 'Paschendale' being prime examples. There's even an all-acoustic track, the colossal 'Journeyman' to close the album. The electric version of this track is on the 'No More Lies' EP but i think i prefer the acoustic version. Speaking of 'No More Lies', what a great track. The chorus is a little repetitive but all is forgiven when the Three Amigos let rip with 3 exceptional solos to top off an already excellent track. The opening 2 songs were the first singles and they sound like typical Maiden singles. Short, catchy choruses, great solos. Business as usual then.\n\n'Montsegur' is heavy, but Bruce sounds slightly strained on this one. Title track is weird and wonderful (typical Jannick song). The next 2 tracks sound like regular Maiden tracks, solid but not spectacular. I can forgive them this so far into their career, it's amazing they can even come up with so many fresh new ideas at this stage. 'Paschendale' is a long, almost symphonic epic about a nasty chapter of World War 1 with a weird Adrian Smith intro. Great stuff! There is an orchestral version on the EP i mentioned earlier. 'Face in the Sand' sounds like they've already done this before but 'Age of Innocence' is another brilliant song with a strong chorus. Then the aforementioned 'Journeyman' closes the album. \n\nSo we've got 2 excellent singles, 4 great epics and a few tracks i don't want to label as filler so we'll just call them solid album tracks. Not a bad effort really. Musical performances are typically great, you wouldn't expect or accept anything less from Iron Maiden really. Sadly this was the last album where Bruce sounded truly at the top of his game for the majority of the album, but even a decade after this album he's still vastly superior to the majority of singers out there. Recommended if you like the more dense, progressive side of Maiden.\n",
        "\nThis is an almost perfect example of what a first album should sound like, and \"Iron Maiden\" has definitely made it's mark in heavy metal history. Although Bruce Dickinson is considered by many as the true Iron Maiden lead vocalist, the who can fire up an audience with his theatrics, his voice, I'm sorry to say, would probably not be as good as Paul Di'Anno's on this debut album. \"Iron Maiden\" and \"Killers\" are care-free (almost destructive) and less thought-through than Iron's Maiden's later albums and Paul's voice embraces that side better than Bruce would have.\n\nAlso, (and this has no direct impact on how you appreciate their music) on a personal, emotional note, it's both heartbreaking and heartwarming to hear Clive Burr's amazing skills at the drums.\n\nMost of the songs on this album, edge more towards speed metal (i.e \"Prowler\", \"Running Free\") but the surprisingly soft \"Remember tomorrow\" (incidentally stuck right in between of the two previous ones) doesn't go along with that idea: whereas most of their songs want to make you pump up the volume and scream along with Paul, this one creates a totally different atmosphere, with softer sound, slower tempo and an more \"sensual\" voice from Paul (he doesn't hit the note, he creeps up to it). It's even more surprising when you listen to other NWOBHM bands, and it shows just how much range this band has, even in it's earliest years.\n\nNow, how can you talk about \"Iron Maiden\" without talking about Dave Murray and Dennis Stratton's amazingly technical guitar solos or Steve Harris's surprisingly progressive musical ideas? Answer is, you can't. The progressive sound Steve Harris gives to some tracks on this album (especially \"Phantom of the Opera\") is innovative for his time, and the fact that he uses it here, in Iron Maiden's debut album, means that the band can evolve in the more progressive sound they favor nowadays while staying true to their roots. And Dave Murray and Dennis Stratton's technically demanding solos add some interesting melodies in songs that otherwise would be poor and lacking in consistency (like the song \"Iron Maiden\").\n\nAnd yes, that was a criticism. I mean, Iron Maiden is one of my favorite bands and I up the irons and scream for Bruce Dickinson whenever I can, but a lot of the songs on this album lack the creative composition their later songs have, and have become favorites because they're catchy but not because they're great musically speaking (and certainly not because they have beautifully dark lyrics, for that matter: their lyrics on this album are average, for the best). Also, the fact that every song has a different style is a very ambitious thing to do and the order in which they displayed the songs doesn't make much sense, and it kind of feels like they had no idea what they were doing.\n\nBut, as a conclusion to this review, they probably didn't have any idea what they were doing, because this was their first album, but they had idea together, with passion and they gave it their all. So if you really go for it, even if you don't quite know what you're doing, you can still create one (and a lot more) killer albums (no pun intended).\n",
        "\nNote that I have the one CD edition, though as this is a compilation, I have heard all the songs here anyway. And as far as best ofs go, this one isn't or should I say WASn't bad for a casual fan to start (are there casual Maiden fans?). As the CD is out of print, and other better best ofs have since been released, a casual fan would typically not shell out extra cash for the out of print compilation.\n\nThough if someone found it in a record store bargain bin as I did with a cheap price, it isn't a bad option. They must not have known the disc isn't very common, as on Amazon this record actually has a pretty high price. But anyway, tracklist wise we have a good selection of tracks promoting all the bands work up to that point, even live albums. Obviously most Maiden heads would have most if not all the albums represented anyway, thus hampering the value. The packaging is actually really cool, with a detailed booklet with lots of band photos and charts showing the releases, both promoting the band to the casual fan, and giving people already hooked to the band something nice as a bonus.\n\nAnnoyingly, as these things often have, there are a couple of rarities that completionists basically need this album to have. Either version comes with the non album single Virus. The acoustic intro is a bit overlong, but the synth laden section it EVENTUALLY escalates to is pretty cool. Honestly, under Bruce Dickinson's tenure this song would probably be fantastic, but Bayley just can't carry the simple acoustics with his voice.\n\nThe two disc version comes with two demo tracks. Haven't listened to them, but we all know there just there to tantalize fans. And frankly a band that has such great full lengths to begin with, even a casual fan should just grab a copy of Powerslave, Somewhere in Time, Piece of Mind, Number of the Beast, or Seventh Son. Or really all of them, or at least a few of them. This type of release should not be encouraged, and I take solace in the fact that I got this used, and cheap as fuck. Because I almost NEVER pull this thing out. So unless those couple exclusives are just too mouth watering to resist, or you fucking dig that cover art, just get the 80's records. Don't even bother with any of those new compilations man. This type of crap is just frustrating and greedy.\n\nSo decent packaging, decent song choice, and a couple of rarities save this from being COMPLETELY useless. Though it's damn close.\na 1 out of five.\n",
        "\nIf you ask the average person to rattle off the names of five classic metal bands, you can be reasonably certain Iron Maiden will be one of them. The band is almost universally beloved by metalheads. Their output from The Number of the Beast through Seventh Son of a Seventh Son is considered one of metal\u2019s few sacred cows. \n\nI grew up in a very small town without any friends who knew more about metal than I did. first learned of the band from a book. See, before Wikipedia, Allmusic, and Metal Archives, there were actually books that listed thousands of albums and had ratings accompanied by short descriptions of the bands. My mom had one of these, and I pored over it looking for metal bands. I never got around to getting any of their albums for a long time, and finally got into the band while in law school. Since I came to them relatively later in life (compared to most metalheads), it should mean something when I say their output from 1982 through 1988 absolutely deserves that sacred cow status.\n\nBut they are not without their faults. Tomorrow, May 12 [2012], marks the 20th anniversary of Fear of the Dark. The record follows No Prayer for the Dying, and between the two of them they constitute what is considered the low point of the Bruce Dickinson years. It\u2019s easy to dismiss a bad record as the result of a bad lineup, but that excuse can\u2019t be applied here as Adrian Smith was not a primary songwriter, nor is the rhythm guitar a serious problem.\n\nBut I came to the band around 2006. I got Fear and Powerslave at basically the same time. So perhaps that gives me some clarity of vision, an outsider\u2019s take on the record that may put it in a different light.\n\nWell, just because that\u2019s possible doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s true. The majority view of Fear is that it has a handful of great songs and a load of garbage. The majority view is correct, as I see it.\n\nThere are three absolutely killer tracks on this record. \u201cChildhood\u2019s End,\u201d \u201cThe Fugitive,\u201d and the incredible title track stand up alongside the very best the band has ever recorded. \u201cJudas Be My Guide\u201d and \u201cChains of Misery,\u201d aren\u2019t bad either. Either one could be the worst song from \u201cPiece of Mind,\u201d which is to say that they\u2019re still pretty damn good. But that\u2019s where the praise must end. \u201cFear is the Key\u201d could have been a great song, except that for the last couple minutes Dickinson is just winging it. He truly sounds as if he has nothing prepared, but they went with the first take anyway. There are four tracks beside that are so dull they aren\u2019t even worth mentioning, full of boring riffs and what sound like improvised vocal lines.\n\nThen there are two incredibly bad songs. \u201cAfraid to Shoot Strangers\u201d is just fucking awful. Some of the leads could have been salvageable, but it\u2019s too long, too boring, and too stupid. I have no idea what they were thinking, and even some of its production choices are curious. \u201cWeekend Warrior,\u201d on the other hand, has the band\u2019s thinking clearly printed on its sleeve. It\u2019s a piss-poor attempt at emulating the teenage rebellion anthems of the 80\u2019s hair metal bands, but it fails for multiple reasons. Maiden was the alternative to hair metal garbage. They don\u2019t grasp it all that well anyway, so it ends up sounding like a parody.\n\nThe Verdict: Even a (for all intents and purposes) classic lineup can fuck things up. There are numerous other examples of that. If you put Maiden\u2019s 90\u2019s albums up against Metallica\u2019s, you\u2019re presented with an interesting question: What is worse, to fail at doing what you\u2019ve always done well, or to mostly succeed at trying something questionable? Fear of the Dark is, for the most part, a failure, although it gives us a few enduring sing-along anthems.\n\noriginally written for http://fullmetalattorney.blogspot.com/\n",
        "\nAsk any Maiden fan what Maiden's golden era was. Try and find more than 5 people whose answer is something else than their first 7 albums. The 90s were a controversial period for the band, and anything from 'Brave New World' to 'The Final Frontier' has generally been deemed 'good, but not AS good'. \n\nI also believe 80s Maiden to be the best Maiden incarnation, but to dismiss anything after 'Seventh Son of a Seventh Son' would be a shame; admittedly, albums like 'No Prayer for the Dying' and 'Virtual XI' contained some of the weakest songs in Maiden's carreer, but in my opinion, there are a lot of songs on their later albums, particularly on the ones made after the return of Bruce Dickinson and Adrain Smith, and even a few on the aforementioned ones, which can definately compete with their older material in terms of quality.\n\nSo: is this album worth buying? After all, it's From Fear to Eternity: a compillation of that ignomious period that is unfortunately ignored by a lot of fans. In short: yes. For starters: just look at the cover. I know it's silly to judge an album by its cover art, but Maiden's artwork has always been very iconic. They are the proud owners of what is arguably the most recognizable metal mascot: Eddie the Head, who appears on all of Maiden's albums. I feel like this artwork deserves special mention, not just because it looks awesome as f*ck, but also for another reason: it includes refferences to multiple songs on the album or to earlier artwork and albums: Eddie is clad in a Grim Reaper outfit (as in 'Dance of Death'), but he also appears on top of the tank (as in 'A matter of Life and Death') which is imprinted with the \"Cross-Keys\" symbol (as in 'The Final Frontier'). You can also see The Wicker Man burning, the tombstone (from 'No Prayer for the Dying') with a giant X on it (a refference to 'The X Factor' of course), and the burnt building (from 'Virtual XI').\n\nBut on to the actual music: This album gathers a good deal of those, in my eyes, underrated songs, like Dance of Death, Paschendale, The Wicker Man, The Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg, When the Wild Wind Blows etc. To all people who (perhaps instinctively) dismiss all Maiden albums from \"Nor Prayer\" and onwards: go ahead and listen to those songs I just named, and tell me they're not worthy members of the Iron Maiden canon. All in all, Maiden have done a very good job of selecting the best songs from what many would unjustly call their \"Dork Age\". In fact, I think it might even help people who limited themselves to Maiden from the 80s get in to Iron Maiden's later material, since the weaker songs from the era are mostly left out.\n\nListening to some of the songs from this period, particularly the ones from the reunion with Bruce and Adrian, one has to give credit to Maiden for trying and do new things in their old age. If they wanted, they could have made \"Brave New World\" over and over again. Instead, they decided to experiment, taking their music in even more progressive directions than they ever did during the 80s.\n\nHowever, that is not to say that the album is not without its flaws. A few good songs are still missing, such as Fates Warning, Chains of Misery, Fortunes of War, Out of the Shadows, and, most puzzlingly, From Here to Eternity... Songs like these could have been included instead of Tailgunner or No More Lies, songs which, while not necessarily bad, seem to be the exact type of songs that people associate with \"mediocre Maiden\".\n\nFurthermore, we have to address the elephant in the room: the Blaze Bayley era. While some songs from his two albums with the band do appear on this album, specifically \"Man on the Edge\", \"The Sign of the Cross\", and \"The Clansman\", Blaze himself does not, since the versions of those songs that appear on \"From Fear to Eternity\" are live versions with Bruce on vocals. Considering the fact that compilation albums are generally mean to give a representative overview of (a specific period of) a band's carreer, Blaze's omission from the album feels a little weird, even though it is, to some degree, understandable, since even people who gladly include \"The X Factor\" and \"Virtual XI\" into the Maiden canon will have to agree that Bruce is a better vocalist. Still, the album could probably have included a few more songs from his tenure with the band, such as \"Futureal\" and \"The Edge of Darkness\", two songs whose only reason for not appearing on this album is, I'm guessing, that there were no available live versions with Bruce.\n\nSo there you have it: a good, albeit not entirely flawless compillation of Iron Maiden's unjustly underrated era, and one that should please most fans, even the ones who until now weren't willing to give the post-Seventh Son of a Seventh Son material a try.\n",
        "\nIt has occurred to me that I\u2019ve really yet to write a truly positive Iron Maiden review. This isn\u2019t because I don\u2019t love Maiden, quite the opposite; I love Maiden so much that I get a little pissed when they fail to deliver. And hell, a 73% is hardly an insult, although in the context of giving it to one of the bands most popular albums, maybe it was a bit low. The point is, while Number of the Beast blew me away when I was but a wee lad, now, pushing a decade later, it\u2019s a little too consistent to really blow me away. More importantly though, is it\u2019s hard to write about a band like Iron Maiden that\u2019s almost universally enjoyed or at least respected for their contributions to metal. I was listening to the likes Number of the Beast and Powerslave since I was 13 or 14. I have at least 12 Maiden shirts, one of which I\u2019m wearing as I type this\u2026 mummy Eddie biting through the chains from the disc on the remaster of Powerslave, the second Maiden shirt I bought, which I\u2019m wearing under a Powerslave hoodie. Also, I have a Rime of the Ancient Mariner shirt. So yeah. I kind of like Powerslave.\n\nOk, remember that Number of the Beast review where I talked about hearing the title song and then going out and buying the album. Incidentally, between hearing Number of the Beast and buying the album, I heard \u2018Aces High\u2019 on the radio, flipping through the classic rock station. Once again, I was fucking blown away, and after doing the early 2000\u2019s equivalent of research, which, like today, involved Wikipedia, but unlike today also involved dial up, I found that these two songs were not on the same album. And then cried. So faced with having to choose, I went with Number of the Beast. And loved it so much that I bought Powerslave within a few months. Unfortunately I did so off of Amazon and received that fucking flat cardboard slipcase thing, and had to later re-purchase it so I could make Eddie\u2019s face out of the remasters. Is my fanboy showing?\n\nEnough fan-rambling, on to the content of the album. As I said, Aces High blew me away when I was 12. And it still has that effect. That riff absolutely blazes through everything, a mighty piece of speed metal created to melt the face of posers and make Invaders shit a brick, as Bruce commands you to run, live to fly, fly to live aces HiiiiiIIIIiIiIiIiiiiIiGH!. And don\u2019t you dare disobey him, you fuck. Maybe it\u2019s a little bit nostalgia, but seriously, this right here is one of my favorite Maiden tracks, and I can\u2019t think of one faster right off the bat, except maybe Be Quick of Be Dead. This goes into another lovely war song, which, while always is a theme for Maiden, goddamn battle is a concept of this album, is some form or another, be it guns or swords. This one is another fan loved song, and while I used to be indifferent to it, I think now it\u2019s just because I wanted another fast song after Aces High. I think getting into thrash metal cured me of this, and made me appreciate midpaced tracks more. Although that\u2019s no excuse for Losfer Words to be so damn boring. Yeah. Even one of my favorite Maiden albums I have a gripe with. It\u2019s not the melodies, which are perfectly fine, it\u2019s that this is a song that felt like it either needed lyrics to be a full song, or that it\u2019s length should have been cut dramatically, because it really stops being interesting around 2 minutes. \u2026TO MIDNIGHT. No, I\u2019m sorry, that was just lame of me.\n\nFlash of the Blade, a fun and catchy song about fencing with a simple but effective main riff, and Back in the Village, a song recalling the theme of the same TV show that the song The Prisoner was based on, are both speedier tracks, although the former is definitely better, and one might argue that Back in The Village is, much like Gangland from Number of the Beast, a fast but overall filler song. I sort of agree with this, but at the same time I argue that this song beats the hell out of Gangland so thoroughly that it\u2019s really not comparable, as even Losfer Words, the main reason for point loss on this album for me, is probably more interesting than goddamn Gangland. Back in the Village isn\u2019t really a bad song so much as forgettable compared to much of the awesome on this album. The other middle track, The Duellists, which is not bad in and of itself, but it\u2019s a little long.\n\nAnyways, the last two tracks are seriously some of Maidens finest moments, which says a lot. After an eerie intro, the band brings the Egyptian inspiration from the cover to their famous galloping riff style, as it ponders the inevitability of death, and regardless of your position of power on the planet, we are all, from the president to the bum, slaves to deaths power. The end adds a little mysticism to it as the pharaoh plans to bring the mummy\u2019s curse to anyone who opens his tomb. A very ambitious and interesting epic, but that\u2019s not all folks. On this album Maiden felt the need to give us not one, but two phenomenal epics, as the Rime of the Ancient Mariner brings 13 minutes of pure awesome to the original story of the same name, including a few direct quotes from it. One of the things that, to me, makes a great epic is the ability for it to never grow stale, and this song never does. It definitely goes through enough phases and riff and time changes that no one riff ever overstays its welcome or gets boring. It begins midpaced, stays this way for a few minutes before simply stopping, as the ship does, and becoming a quick speed metal song as the mariner and crew is approached by a ghost ship. The song becomes a very calm, quiet and ambient piece, as Steve Harris\u2019 bass leads us through the darkest part of the mariners tale, as he watches his entire crew die. The song becomes slightly more upbeat as the Mariner prays and is relieved of his punishment. And as the rain falls from the sky, the song quickens up, before coming full circle. The song returns to the mariner telling his tale to the opening riff (although, wouldn\u2019t a stranger telling a story to the guests ruin a wedding? Why isn\u2019t the bride like, we\u2019re trying to get married bro, cant this wait?). And so ends easily one of Iron Maidens greatest masterpieces. God I love this fucking song.\n\nI\u2019ve heard it said that this album consists of four mediocre songs sandwiched between two awesome songs. No, these people are wrong. While Aces High, 2 Minutes to Midnight, Powerslave, and Rime of the Ancient Mariner do make the bread of epic, the contents of t he sandwich are fantastic as well, as Flash of the Blade and Back in the Village make up the fun speed metal meat, while The Duellists makes the midpaced dueling mayonnaise\u2026 Just a bit too much of it for my taste, but the only real complaint is still the unnecessary Losfer Words lettuce, which really just dulls down the flavor in my opinion. Ok, seriously, I\u2019ll stop. This is getting too dumb. No more drinking and reviewing. \n\nThe bottom line is that this is one of the best Iron Maiden albums, and one of my favorites for sure. I\u2019ve heard it said that Maiden is a band that makes great songs, but not great albums. This is a great album, one of several they\u2019ve made. It\u2019s not perfect, but I\u2019ve yet to hear an album that is, and the complaints here are pretty minimal, mostly a couple songs overstay their welcome. But this is still a fine piece of Iron Maiden metal, and though Number of the Beast may be a better \u2018intro to Maiden\u2019 album, this is a still a great follow up.\n",
        "\nWhen it comes to aging metal bands, I really do not expect a whole lot. This is not me being cynical, but rather that I don't expect them to add another classic to the discography (i.e. Seventh Son or Powerslave), and I suspect with most bands of this longevity know this deep down too. However, effort still goes a long way. For this, Iron Maiden comes out in spades with Dance of Death.\n\nIron Maiden's aesthetic is probably best summed up by their energetic frontman, Bruce Dickinson. He flies their jet, jumps all over the stage during their shows (he's always drenched in sweat by the time the show is over) and pursues a gaggle of outside hobbies. This attitude is reflected in the music of Dance of Death. The structures have now long moved away from simple verse-chorus-verse for most of the songs, instead opting for more progressive songs that use orchestrations more prominently, feature epic compositions from the band members, and just like how I feel Iron Maiden delivered on Brave New World, I doubly feel so for Dance of Death. The first half of the album is arguably the more conventional half, with more traditional opening songs Wildest Dreams and Rainmaker (although rainmaker oddly struck a chord with me). It is interesting to note that, for while this half of the album features No More Lies and Dance of Death, which are long form epics in the vein of Dream of Mirrors from their last album (as well as live favorites), that it is the more conventional half. It is symbolic of Iron Maiden's tireless pursuance of quality and consistency that this grade of songwriting has become standard!\n\nThe second half, however, is at hands both movingly joyous and movingly solemn. It features the gripping Paschendale, a raw account of trench warfare from a soldier's perspective, as well as the more traditional Gates of Tomorrow and New Frontier. It is with the last 3 songs, however, that I feel most impressed with Iron Maiden's scope. The intros and more sparse/melodic parts are seamlessly blended with the fully saturated sections in the songs Face in the Sand and Age of Innocence. Both these songs feature heavy orchestration, and I feel Iron Maiden, the one metal band who I would say defines the word \"class\", used this orchestration quite tastefully. It is with the last song, however, that I feel Iron Maiden risked the most, and through the logic of \"greatest risk, greatest possible gain\", Iron Maiden achieved a poignant and dignified epilogue that outshined a good chunk of an already amazing album, all of which is done without using any gain on the guitars at all during this song. That is quite a monumental feat, as far as I'm concerned. To this day, I consider Journeyman to be the best - written song here.\n\nLest you think that the Maiden has sold out, this album delivers on the guitars for damn sure. The solos are all done immaculately, and the triple guitar approach creates a dense set of layers that are capable of so much more, sonically speaking, that just two. Each guitarist here puts forth a truly earnest effort here, and it shows. As usual, Steve Harris proves once again why he is heavy metal's best bassist -- and that is because he forms the fourth layer in the stringed, amplified instruments of Iron Maiden with just as much ferocity and just as much drive and lead in the melodies and harmonies as any other of the guitarists, and eclipses them in quite a few parts. Nicko McBrain is, as always, a driving, completely fluid and natural feeling, and a plus on the album is that the drums have significantly more commanding presence and low-end thud (as if McBrain were playing a 10 ft tall kit made of steel-reinforced wood) and this definitely accentuates Nicko's style. If this sounds like standard issue Iron Maiden to you, then remind yourself of why you're an Iron Maiden fan, because it's this devotion to quality that has become Iron Maiden's brand, and that extends to the competency, composition, and use of the instruments on Dance of Death. I should expect the best from Maiden, it appears, because they are still fully prepared to deliver it.\n\nTruth be told, even if Iron Maiden put forth a C- effort, I would be prepared to give them 85% or so simply because at this point in their careers, I didn't particularly expect another classic. Whether or not Dance of Death is a classic is dependent on who you ask, but this is an honest effort that goes quite beyond my expectations. The fact that for a cumulative 20 minutes or so of this album essentially does nothing new at all does not seem to bother me at all. This is because on Dance of Death, we got several sections (I'd reckon an addition 25-30 minutes worth) that, I would dare to say it, redefine what it means to be NWOBHM, 30 or so years after the fact, or even heavy metal in general, I would reckon. Not in a truly revolutionary way, mind you, but Iron Maiden take enough (successful) risks here that any flaws are immediately blown away by their tireless devotion to their art (as implied in the title). \n\nAt any point in a band'e career, I would consider a record of this caliber to be truly an achievement. The fact that Maiden have been at it for nearly 30 years at the time of this release is something to marvel at, yet isn't intrinsically apparent in the music. That Iron Maiden have reinvented themselves as a progressive heavy metal band this late in their careers and managed to still capture a feeling of youth in their music is truly mind-blowing. I try not to get this giddy any more, but after a gazillion listens, Dance of Death still makes me poop hammers, so to speak. If you haven't already heard it in its entirety, I urge you to do so. This weathered veteran still has some aces and wild cards up his sleeve, it seems.\n",
        "\nI really shouldn\u2019t be describing the Irons to anyone, particularly metalheads, but if you have been living under a rock or have been in a coma for about 30 years or so, then I can give you the benefit of the doubt. Iron Maiden helped lead the charge of the new wave of British heavy metal (N.W.O.B.H.M) back in the late 70\u2019s and early 80\u2019s in Britain and Europe, and without hardly any airplay from British radio stations went on to become one of the biggest and most well known heavy metal bands in the world. Now it\u2019s been 31 years since the release of their debut album (the first of 15), and Iron Maiden are still going strong and are showing no signs of slowing down or retiring.\n\nThe Irons and their label EMI are no strangers to releasing material other than their studio albums; between 1981 and 2009 there has been numerous live albums, DVD\u2019s, singles and VHS videos. Boxed sets and compilation albums were first released (in my opinion) as a pre-emptive and safe move by EMI to coincide with the release of 1995\u2019s \u2018The X Factor\u2019, with Blaze Bayley on vocals, after Bruce Dickinson left the band in August 1993. It was a rocky time for Iron Maiden in the early to mid 90\u2019s, with no Bruce or Adrian Smith, poor sales from the underachieving CD\u2019s \u2018No Prayer for the Dying\u2019 and \u2018Fear of the Dark\u2019, and the reception to both Blaze and \u2018The X Factor\u2019 was somewhat lukewarm.\n\nMaiden needed a new hook, a new angle, and as a result \u2018Best of the Beast\u2019 was released in 1996. Their first and greatest compilation album that not only kept Maiden fans happy, but also steadied the ship and helped recruit new fans as well. Three more best of compilations were released within the years 1999-2005; with the second and third albums being quite unnecessary. A fourth compilation (\u2018Somewhere Back in Time - The Best Of: 1980-1989\u2019) was released in 2008 to coincide with Iron Maiden\u2019s Somewhere Back in Time tour in the same year, but by this stage these best of albums were starting to wear thin, as the same songs were reappearing time and time again and it was clear that this was becoming more of a quick cash grab than anything else.\n\nSo now in 2011, the sequel to the previous compilation has been released, \u2018From Fear To Eternity - The Best Of: 1990-2010\u2019. The big difference between this disc and the 1980-1989 one is that this new compilation covers two decades of hits over two CDs where the majority of tracks have not been on a compilation album before. The CDs contains songs from Iron Maiden last 8 studio albums, including their latest disc \u2018The Final Frontier\u2019 and gives a new purpose for a proper compilation album, with newbie fans to the band sure to thoroughly enjoy and get into. There are also three live tracks scattered throughout, curiously tracks that originally featured Blaze Bayley on vocals, but here given the live treatment with Bruce; which I feel is in poor taste. If this is a history of Iron Maiden\u2019s musical journey through the decades, then you need to be true to that notion. Yes, Blaze Bayley was the singer for the Irons from 1994 to 1999, but you wouldn\u2019t know it with this compilation.\n\nI must say that from pure variety alone, this best of compilation ranks pretty highly in my book and arguably the best collection of Maiden tracks since 1999\u2019s \u2018Ed Hunter\u2019. I say this because we\u2019ve already had too many compilations that include classic songs like \u201cAces High\u201d, \u201cThe Number of the Beast\u201d and \u201cThe Trooper\u201d and while those songs kick ass and always will, the Maiden fans want to hear something different for a change, and this new compilation is it.\n\nIn all there are 23 tracks over 2 CDs, more than enough to sway the virgin Maiden listener and a few of the greatest hits over the past 20 years that appear on this compilation include \u201cFor the Greater Good of God\u201d, \u201cDance of Death\u201d, \u201cBrave New World\u201d, \u201cTailgunner\u201d \u201cThe Clansman\u201d, \u201cAfraid to Shoot Strangers\u201d, \u201cSign of the Cross\u201d and low and behold the studio version of \u201cFear of the Dark\u201d. Lastly, songs from the latest studio album include \u201cEl Dorado\u201d, \u201cComing Home\u201d and \u201cWhen the Wild Wind Blows\u201d.\n\nSo if you want to hear a montage of Maiden\u2019s prowess over the last 20 years, then this compilation is a very nice and well selected snapshot, minus any contribution from Blaze Bayley, which is unfortunate. Other than that, it is a damn fine compilation that is worthy of the name Iron Maiden.\n\nOriginally written for www.themetalforge.com (August 2011)\n",
        "\nFew bands within the metal scene are held in as high regard as Iron Maiden; and not without good reason. For more than three decades now the band has consistently set the bar very high for bands everywhere to attempt to match. Whilst it is almost certainly true that their newer works are not quite as hard hitting nor as powerful as album like \"The Number Of The Beast\"; each release the band has put out has had more positives than negatives. So when news arrived that the band was working on their first studio in four years, many a metal fan's hearts suddenly began to beat faster in anticipation and quite rightfully so. After all, 2006's \"A Matter Of Life And Death\" had arguably been the band's strongest work since \"Seventh Son Of A Seventh Sun\". The question that many would pose would be whether the band could pump out yet another album of a high standard despite the fact the band were rapidly ageing.\n\nThe answer is a resounding \"yes\". Every aspect of the band that many have come to idolize is present and correct on \"The Final Frontier\"; from the never-ending guitar bombastic guitar assault to the powerful operatic vocals of Bruce Dickinson and the clever and thought provoking lyrics that added so much to classic songs like \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\". The band chose an appropriate song to release as a single in \"El Dorado\" as this is merely a taster as to what the band is capable of whilst still being a solid song in its own right. The galloping bass lines from Steve Harris are shown to be on form once again with this song, rumbling away in the background; high in the mix but not so much that it becomes a distraction from the rest of the music. Harris' bass work is almost flawless on Maiden's 2010 return and is flooded with his characteristic impeccable sense of rhythm and anchors each of the songs down with a solid groove for the three guitarists to build off which they do masterfully. Be it the water-tight riffing to the opening song, the pinch harmonics that add such a lot to the sound of \"El Dorado\" or the epic eleven minute closer \"When the Wild Wind Blows\"; the band never lets up showing their guitar talent on here. The solos are phenomenal and many in number, usually flinging a mass of notes the listeners way so fast that it is hard to comprehend. This is just another day at the office for Maiden.\n\nThe vocal performance from Bruce Dickinson is less mind-blowing than on the band's earlier works and it appears that age is finally catching up with him; but the man still has the chops to put in a great performance. On \"Mother Of Mercy\" he holds some great notes for a couple of seconds during the chorus whilst delivering the verses in a lower voice than some will be accustomed to. He has quite a wide range here and scarcely put a foot wrong throughout the entire album but it is still irksome to hear the vocals on here when stacked against their earliest works. The one thing that really does let down \"The Final Frontier\" is the drum performance. Whereas songs such as \"Invaders\" on their earlier works showed the band know how to write a varied and entertaining drum show; this album does shoot itself in the foot where the drums are concerned. The beats are generic and disappointing and do little more than just create a rhythm and Nicko McBrain doesn't strive to push himself at all. Another problem with this release is that it is a little too long, clocking in at just shy of an hour and a quarter long-the longest of all Maiden releases. On the longer cuts off of this album such as \"When The Wind Blows\" the band attempts to show off a more progressively inspired side to their sound by incorporating long build ups and changes in sound. Sadly they really fail to pull this off and could have instead used the faster and heavier sections as songs in their own right and kept the album length down. Moments such as the jam sections that open and close \"El Dorado\" feel pointless and unnecessary and would also have helped to keep the length down had they been cut.\n\nThe choice songs off here are \"El Dorado\", \"Mother Of Mercy\" and \"The Man Who Would Be King\". The first two are straightforward Maiden songs with creative bass work and an influx of fast-paced soloing and riffs that thunder along without taking any prisoners. The latter is far longer but makes good use of its length with many cleverly written twists and turns, and some awesome lyrics. If the whole album were up to the same standard as these three songs then the album would have been a lot more solid as each song has at least one or two moments worth speaking about. Sadly; the title track does not open the album up very well with some generic drumming and is unnecessarily long. Many of the songs suffer due to the length and not in fact because of the song writing itself although they do tend to repeat themselves numerous times. \"The Final Frontier\" is an album worth checking out for both avid Maiden fans and also casual fans of the band but is not highly recommended to others as a place to start with the band as it pales in comparison to their earliest works and also to the three that preceded it.\n",
        "\nWhen the average member of the general public hears the words heavy metal one of the first names they should be able to reel off associated with the genre is Iron Maiden. This band has been around now for several decades and continues to influence many a band to this day. Albums such as \u201cThe Number Of The Beast\u201d, \u201cPowerslave\u201d and \u201cPiece Of Mind\u201d are rarely missing from people's lists of their favorite metal albums and the band are seldom left out of a list relating to favorite bands. \n\nOut of all of their albums the most popular would be The \u201cNumber Of The Beast\u201d. This garnered the band a lot of attention through its controversial title track and the two highly regarded songs \u201cHallowed Be Thy Name\u201d and \u201cRun To The Hills\u201d. It served as the perfect album for vocalist Bruce Dickinson to begin his career with the band on a high note and is one of a number of releases that many would say could contest to be the best metal releases ever. From the fast paced introduction of Invaders this album reeks heavily of grandeur and marvel and it delivers this spectacularly. Eight songs make up this forty minute slice of greatness and every one of them is more than enough to keep the listener interested.\n\nNot one member of the band could be considered dispensable and nor do they slack off for \u201cThe Number Of The Beast\u201d. The drumming is intense and varied from the quick beats that are pressed upon the listener by the opening song Invaders or the slower title track. Long before the band employed a trinity of guitarists; they proved their ability to create a well-paced and masterfully crafted release with just the standard two. Both Dave Murray and Adrian Smith contribute heavily to the overall sound of this release as should be expected from a metal release. Whether they are playing the slower clean guitar sections to \u201cChildren Of The Damned\u201d or the lightning fast soloing found on \u201cHallowed Be Thy Name\u201d; the performance of the duo never dips in quality.\n\nThe bass performance on \u201cThe Number Of The Beast\u201d is as good as has come to be expected from Steve Harris who wrote the majority of the songs that make up this release single handedly. His rumbling bass lines are constantly audible and contain a strong amount of musical intelligence behind them. The bass to this release does not follow the generic formula of following every note of the guitars as has become the norm of metal in recent years but actually endeavors to break free of these chains. \u201cHallowed Be Thy Name\u201d is Harris' best contribution to this album both as a writer and performer. It is a seven minute long streak of genius opening with some bells ringing and developing as the song progresses into an absolutely epic creation with many speed changes and some of the best riffs found on the album.\n\nIt was on this release that the air raid siren himself Bruce Dickinson was accepted into the fold and stands tall as one of his greatest achievements to date. Whilst his predecessor put in some strong performances; Bruce easily shows himself to be a marvelous replacement and far out strips him. This album even continues a successor to an earlier song that allows Bruce to continue the story of a prostitute named Charlotte started on the song \u201cCharlotte The Harlot\u201d. The song that arguably makes the best use of Bruce's operatic vocals is \u201cThe Prisoner\u201d. This is the first of three songs that stretch over the six minute mark and never does it let up in intensity. The energy that is spilled into the vocals as the drums and bass gallop forward before the chorus is absolutely incredible but it is during the chorus where Bruce really displays his strengths. He holds some fantastic notes for a couple of seconds at a time before ending on a sharp note by barking the word \"out\" with a lot of conviction.\n\n\u201cThe Number Of The Beast\u201d contains four tracks that are often considered to be among the band\u2019s finest (Run To The Hills, the title track, \u201cHallowed Be Thy Name\u201d and \u201cChildren Of The Damned\u201d) but the other songs that make up the album do not interrupt the flow of the album either. The aforementioned album opener Invaders kicks things off to a great start with a fast pace and a collection of stupendous riffs and \u201cThe Prisoner\u201d continues this as mentioned. \u201c22 Acacia Avenue\u201d is the song that is most in line with the band\u2019s previous material both in the nature of the introduction and the chorus as well as the fact that it continues the story of Charlotte. The only song of the original eight (\u201cTotal Eclipse\u201d was later added on a re-release) that could be considered filler is \u201cGangland\u201d. Following on from \u201cRun To The Hills\u201d; this song merely feels like a bridge between that song and the monumental closer \u201cHallowed Be Thy Name\u201d. As the second shortest track on the album it can merely be seen as an interlude but has some good riffs as well.\n\nThe lyrical content on \u201cThe Number Of The Beast\u201d is also absolutely top notch and is arguably one of its strongest points. Never on this release will you find a generic line and there is not an unnecessary lyrical contribution in sight. Each song\u2019s lyrics feels focused and draws up a complete portrait of what they aim to portray; be it Norse warfare (\u201cInvaders\u201d) or an escaping prisoner (\u201cThe Prisoner\u201d). The peak of the quality in the lyrical content on \u201cThe Number Of The Beast\u201d is on \u201cHallowed Be Thy Name\u201d which stands as just another reason why it could be seen as the finest thing on the album. It tells the story of a prisoner\u2019s final moments before execution and the thoughts that pass through his head and has a lot of emotion behind it whilst being written in a tight fashion.\n\n\u201cTears fall, but why am I crying?\nAfter all, I\u2019m not afraid of dying,\nDon\u2019t I believe that there never is an end?\nAs the guards march me out to the court yard,\nSomebody cries from a cell \u201cGod be with you\u201d.\nIf there\u2019s a God then why has he let me go?\u201d\n\nThe song contains deep religious lyrics that question religion and the morality of both the prisoner\u2019s actions and guard\u2019s actions without ever throwing any direct accusations. They are, in my mind at least, some of the best lyrics in all of metal and stand testament to how good a lyricist Steve Harris actually is. \n\n\u201cThe Number Of The Beast\u201d is rightfully considered to be a metal classic in my opinion. This is an album that has both a tight instrumental performance and a marvelous vocal performance from Dickinson. The lyrical content is strong and the guitar work intense; with the bass and drums complimenting it perfectly. Bruce Dickinson was the perfect choice of a vocalist for this style of music and this is the definition of the word \u201cmasterpiece\u201d.\n",
        "\nFear of the Dark is often bunched together with No Prayer for the Dying as Maiden\u2019s two mediocre albums, before Bruce left and the dreaded Blaze era began. The difference between the two albums, however, was that while No Prayer\u2026 felt like a mediocre album that, while not bad, was entirely forgettable, Fear of the Dark gave us an album that was a very mixed bag, and while No Prayer felt less like a return to the roots and more like \u201cMaiden By Numbers\u201d or a tribute band doing original material, this sounds like a band that is trying to respond to that criticism, but is entirely unsure of a new musical direction. Musically, it goes back and forth between experimentation, standard fare Maiden sound, and \u201cwhat the hell were they thinking?!\u201d. As a result, we get a confused album that hits the mark and, well, quite a few times gives us a few of Maiden's greatest, if not least memorable, moments as well as some of the worst material they have ever written.\n\nThe great stuff: Be Quick or be Dead kicks off the album with some immense power and speed with Bruce spitting out his vocals angrily, but right off the bat it\u2019s obvious he\u2019s still going with his more raw vocals from No Prayer. Still, this is up there with Aces High as far as energetic, speedy Maiden songs. Afraid to Shoot Strangers starts off very melodic with Bruce singing in a raspy near-whisper. The first several minutes are actually quite beautiful, and let me tell you, it was really something when I saw it live as well. It gets a little heavier about halfway through and goes through an aggressive solo before going to a more melodic ending. Childhood\u2019s End is a darker, mid-paced song. The chorus is a little odd, consisting of a sort of short tam drum spasm and riff being repeated as Bruce spits out two-word chorus lines, but it\u2019s direct and to the point. It\u2019s a little out of the ordinary for a Maiden song, but not as much as some of the other experiments on the album, and it gets to the bridge/solo section that\u2019s classic Maiden. Overall, it\u2019s a decent and memorable song. Judas Be My Guide took a while to grow on me, but it\u2019s a fun song with a catchy verse and catchy chorus. The verses and choruses focus on simplicity and it works for what might have been an okay live song if the band had been a more cohesive unit both live and in the studio at the time. I always thought it was strange how pessimistic the song was for a Maiden song. Not that I\u2019m not used to any dark Maiden songs, but unlike most others where the darkness seems like a foreboding warning or some kind of depressing reflection song, the attitude of this song, along with lines like \u201cEverything\u2019s wasted, is that all there is, can I go now?\u201d seem genuinely pessimistic. Maybe this is a reflection of Dickinson\u2019s feelings on the band and his interest in a solo project at the time. Or maybe I just read into these things too much and it\u2019s about war or something.\n\nWhat could I be forgetting? Oh yeah, apparently some people appreciate the title track. It seems like while the quality of any of the aforementioned songs could be argued as well as any other song on this album, just about every Maiden fan loves the album's closer, the epic Fear of the Dark, and why not? It\u2019s an amazing song, especially live. Melodic, dark, beautiful in the intro, and then just exploding where even on the album version you can imagine how Bruce would be running around the stage like a madman in an arena. And do I sense some Middle Eastern influence in the very beginning? God, how I love that style in metal. It truly is classic Maiden and is really a fine example of it on an album that otherwise sounds like it\u2019s written by a band whose unsure of who they are anymore. It\u2019s also one of the moments on the album where Bruce shows his voice still has some fucking power behind it. Although his rasp is still certainly here, there are also times it sounds like it was recorded with the Bruce from Powerslave.\n\nThe decent stuff: Fear is the Key is an average song with a cool, Middle Eastern-sounding riff which, as I mentioned before, is a sound I\u2019ve always loved in metal, however it\u2019s much more predominant in this song. The chorus is pretty fun and catchy enough, however there are the forgettable verses and the inclusion of a middle part that just doesn\u2019t fit feels a little forced and features Bruce saying the word \u2018lies\u2019 about 30 times. It was as though they felt the need to add a progressive part or something for no reason. There\u2019s also a strange noise and guitar squeal part that sounds like Dimebag Darell might be getting ready to play Floods in there somewhere. However, Bruce does a pretty fucking sick Ian Gillan impression at one point. Overall, not a song I\u2019d call good, but also not bad. The Fugitive begins rather heavy, the chorus is catchy, and the \u201cI AM A FUGITIVE\u201d part would have probably been a good live piece, but the rest is pretty forgettable. Neither of these songs are terrible. I never feel the need to skip them, but if you asked me what songs were on the album, these are the ones I\u2019d probably forget. \n\nThe controversial stuff: these songs will probably fit into either the decent or shitty category depending on who you ask. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll find many who will say these are amazing because they\u2019re not. However, liking or hating them is completely dependent on musical taste. They all sound like things Maiden would have never done on any album before this, so I credit them for trying new things. Unfortunately, just attempting an experiment doesn\u2019t necessarily make it successful. From Here to Eternity: Have you ever heard an AC/DC song? Well then you\u2019ve heard every AC/DC song ever. AC/DC wrote one song, then wrote it 500 more times. Why do I bring this up? Do you like AC/DC? If you do, you might dig this. If you don\u2019t, you WILL hate this because this song is that one single AC/DC song. Bruce even seems to be doing his best Brian Johnson impression. Personally, AC/DC is alright with me, however I only like them when I\u2019m in the right mood, and if I want to listen to AC/DC, I\u2019ll put on AC/DC. I don\u2019t put on Maiden to hear AC/DC. So while I don\u2019t hate this song, I see no use for it. Wasting Love is a power ballad, pure and simple. You should be able to tell from that opening riff. I\u2019m not entirely sure who the hell was ever asking for a power ballad from Maiden. If you\u2019re the kind of guy saying, \u201cFUCK POWER BALLADS!!\u201d. this might not be for you. Personally, I enjoyed it and thought it was interesting to hear Maiden do something along that line. I originally thought I never wanted to hear Maiden do a power ballad and I originally skipped this song constantly, but it ended up growing on me. It also chooses to be an entirely depressing song, seemingly about loneliness and isolation rather than a love and/or lost love song like many other power ballads I\u2019m familiar with. Ok, not a massive change of pace, but I think we all feel that way sometimes, whether you\u2019re that guy who can\u2019t get into a relationship or have been married for 20 years. Decent stuff either way as far as I\u2019m concerned.\n\nThe shitty: The Apparition is just an awkward song. I can\u2019t even say I have a straightforward opinion on it. It has what couldn\u2019t quite be called a riff, maybe an awkward groove and Bruce almost doing a rap-type thing, a short, decent solo, and then back to the groove rap. Again, I appreciate the band trying new things, but this experiment didn\u2019t quite make the grade with me. Although maybe shitty is a little harsh, Chains of Misery feels like filler. It\u2019s a little too average rock and the layered vocals on the words \u201che\u2019s got your chains of misery\u201d makes it feel like they wanted to make an arena rock anthem or something. However, the part of this song that really made me group it here rather than controversial is the incredibly and undeniably awkward \u201che\u2019s got the key to your heart\u201d part. \n\nThen there\u2019s Weekend Warrior. Both The Apparition and Chains of Misery I could see enjoying and, really, I can listen to the album without skipping them, but this song just pisses me off. It\u2019s apparently about a soccer (sorry, I\u2019m North American, \u201cfootball\u201d) game which, while I suppose is understandable as they all are apparently soccer (/football) fans, there isn\u2019t shit about soccer that\u2019s metal or belongs on a metal album. The lyrics are relentlessly cheesy, especially in the context. \u201cMaybe someone will die\u2026 someone will die\u2026 someone will die.\u201d Shut up, Bruce. No one dies in soccer. The intro attempts to be melodic, but just kind of meanders, then it goes into a groove similar to The Apparition in a way. Before each chorus the meandering riff from the intro comes in as Bruce repeats whatever the last two words he just said 4 times or so and complains about his friend changing and being an asshole when he plays soccer. The chorus is pretty generic Maiden stuff, but the lyrics for it suck. Even the chorus is among the least interesting I\u2019ve ever heard from Maiden. It\u2019s like they wanted to try my patience for 5 and a half minutes before giving me the godly Fear of the Dark. This song alone impacts my view of the album to drop the score about 3 percentage points. Maybe I\u2019m being a little harsh, but this song exists to piss me off and accomplishes it in ways that are unimaginable. This isn\u2019t a song Iron Maiden should have ever written. Fuck Weekend Warrior.\n\nSo, while No Prayer for the Dying disappointed fans by being a somewhat safe, back to the roots album and having for the most part a lot of/too much continuity, Fear of the Dark disappointed fans by having very little continuity. The album blasts off with Be Quick or be Dead, possibly one of the heaviest songs the band has written, into an AC/DC-sounding rock song. From the worst song on the album, Weekend Warrior, to what is considered the best, Fear of the Dark. The band tried too many things on one release, and while many individual songs definitely work, the whole album is less effective and comes off as confused and disjointed. About half the album the average fan will enjoy more than No Prayer, while the other half will be hated, resulting in something of a musical cocktease.\n",
        "\nGood lord, nothing here I would give less than four stars! This epitomizes quality over quantity with a massive 72 minute ride down the warpath spread over only ten songs.\u00a0\n\nThe opener, \"Different World\", is the album's best proof of Dickinson's durability. He proves his voice is still marvelously powerful even after 10 Iron Maiden records across three decades. Lyrically, it is a regrettably standard rock/metal ode to doing your own thing and \"everybody has a different way to view the world\" - who cares? But the song is redeemed and then some by Smith's fairly short, yet blistering solo. \n\nLyrically and melodically, the highlight here is the almost 9 minute masterpiece \"Brighter Than a Thousand Suns\". You'd be hard pressed in my mind to challenge its candidacy for heavy metal song #1 of the 2000s. The soft vocal intro with slowly building guitar intensity keeps you on the edge of your seat and knocks you right out as Bruce belts out \"we will feel the pain of his beginning\". This coupled with the first electrification of the simple, yet menacing main riff is brilliant. Much has been sung about atomic war, but little compares to 1000 Suns.\n\nAssuming the listener is not too closed-minded about McBrain's Christianity, \"The Pilgrim\" comes in as a close second best on this disc. The lyrics are deeply spiritual as all meaningful metal should be (whether you carry or invert your crucifix, the theme of spiritual crisis should strike a chord). As the instruments go, \"The Pilgrim\" has Nicko's most proficient drum rhythm that you can't help playing along to as well as a subtle, yet unshakable Middle Eastern vibe that matches its psalm-like words.\n\nThe back five songs, aside from \"Out of the Shadows\", follow the example of tracks 2 and 3: long with a soft, dark, mood-building intro verse (or two verses, or two minutes). \"The Longest Day\" is the bloodiest track here. Its slow, slogging opening perfectly suits its theme of Allied soldiers dragging themselves up over the daunting fortifications of Hitler's Norman Coast.\u00a0There follows the relatively shorter \"Out of the Shadows\", whose strange mystical lyrics all wouldn't be out of place on one of Maiden's late-'80s albums (this is not to say that it's out of place here).\n\nAs mentioned, tracks 7-10 are more similar to 2, 3 and 5, in both length and in structure. They all feature Iron Maiden's patented slow buildup and my favourite trademark of theirs, the instrumental rhythm solo (see also Metal Church for a band who does that well). Of course, do not skip the lead solo in \"Lord of Light\". It weaves and winds its way through tastefully used distortion to create a feeling of being pulled down a spiral staircase to the abyss.\n\nI must admit, when I saw the last song was called \"The Legacy\" I worried that they were hinting this would be their last song ever. And it would have been going out on a good note as the solid main riff rolls down on you like an avalanche. Last, but not least, \"The Legacy\" features the highlight of Steve Harris' bass work on this record. Not since Trouble's classic \"Endtime\" back in '84 has anyone used the bass to introduce, then mirror the guitar line so effectively. Dang, it's crushing when that's done right!\n\nAs of now, this is the only album to earn an absolute perfect score from me. Listen to it - it's a matter of life and death!\n",
        "\nI can't think of another album cover that better represents the content of the music than Iron Maiden's Killers. Take one look into the beady eyes of Eddie as he lifts his bloody hatchet for a finishing blow and you'll know you're in for a lethal dose of heavy metal horror. Filled with dark and majestic imagery, Killers delivers just that, but it doesn't end there as Killers also features the best and most consistent musicianship, song-writing, and production of Iron Maiden's long and illustrious career. \n\nBy the time Killers was released in 1981, Iron Maiden had already established themselves as one of the premier NWOBHM bands with their early demo 'The Soundhouse Tapes'. After becoming local heroes, the group then hit a global audience with their debut album, the self-titled masterpiece 'Iron Maiden'. Boasting such classic metal cuts as 'Phantom of the Opera', 'Prowler', and 'Transylvania', the album perfectly captured the raw power and energy of a band on the brink of world domination. However, the album suffered from a cheap production job and, in my opinion, a few tracks that dragged on longer than they should have, 'Remember Tomorrow' for example.\n\nTouring in support of their first album helped Iron Maiden further develop their sound and grow tighter as musicians. Following the departure of Dennis Stratton, axemaster Adrian Smith was hired as the second guitarist. It turned out to be a wise choice as Smith's heavy and rough-around-the-edges playing style perfectly accentuated Dave Murray's precise and complex riffs and solos. Paul Di'anno serves his duty well enough, delivering a signature raspy, wailing, punk-like performance. His voice fit the tone of the songs perfectly, but its easy to hear that Iron Maiden were progressing past him as musicians. Although this is his final album with the band, the personality he gives the early Maiden songs earn him major credit for their worldwide success. \n\nNow that we've gotten all that out of the way, let's get down to what really counts- the music. \n\nKillers hits the ground running with the thundering march of 'The Ides of March', a brilliant and powerful instrumental as heavy as it is beautiful. The track leads into what is perhaps the most well-known song off the album, 'Wrathchild'. Now considered a Maiden classic, Wrathchild is a hard-hitting rocker with a driving bass line and some incredible rhythms from drummer Clive Burr, a bonafide master of the skins. It's worth noting that Killers-era Maiden had the greatest heavy metal rythym section in the genre's history. \n\n'Murders in the Rue Morgue' embraces a song structure that has proved to be a favorite of the band continuing to the present day, the slow and mellow opening leading to a heavy, crushing song. Although in later years the format would grow tiresome, it works very well on this track. The opening is just the right amount of time, gradually building up in intensity until a barrage of snare fills launches right into the opening verse. The track is frantic yet melodic, a balance that defines Iron maiden's music. \n\nPerhaps the most musically accomplished track on the album, 'Another Life' begins with a hypnotic cacophony of opposing guitar solos on top of a steady driving beat. Dual guitar harmonies dominate this song, and represent the most addictingly melodic and expertly executed of the band's career. The instrumental 'Genghis Khan' follows as a sort-of sequel to 'Transylvania'. Although not as good as its predecessor, Genghis Khan still contains Maiden's signature galloping heavy metal style that makes you want to charge into battle.\n\n'Innocent Exile' was an early song in the band's career that makes its debut on this album. It begins with an intense drum fill and doesn't let up from there. It is another quality metal song that displays a mastering of the craft. My personal favorite part is near the end after the guitar solo when there is a pounding break and Di-anno screams 'Lord I'm RUNNNNNNIIIIIIINNNNNNN'!!!!!! YEEEEEAAAAHHH!!!' to an eruption of guitar shreds and cymbal bursts. Now that's metal!\n\nFlipping the album over to the other side gives you the title track 'Killers', which follows a similar format to 'Murders of the Rue Morgue' with a slow-building into that explodes into the main driving riff. The lyrical content is dark as the title suggests, and Di-Anno delivers them perfectly with his rough vocals. The song is very fast once it starts going, and is sometimes referred to as an early influence of thrash metal. After that is 'Twlight Zone', another quality hard-rocking track that has my personal favorite opening riff on the album. This is also perhaps the most melodic song on here, with a very catchy and fun-to-sing-along-to chorus that serves as a precursor to the song-writing that would dominate Maiden's later efforts in the 1980's. It is a great song that proves Paul Di'Anno can actually sing. \n\nThe next one is kind of an oddball. 'Prodigal Son' is a soft, ballad-style song, one of the very few in Maiden's career. Although it can be initially off-putting, there's still plenty here for heavy metal fans to appreciate. Clive Burr hits just as hard here as he does on the other tracks, and the intermittent heavy chords in addition to the acoustic-sounding main riff gives the song a unique dynamic. I believe this song represents Maiden attempting to show their mellow side in a heavier context with shaky results. I personally like the song, but it simply doesn't fit the tone of the record and disrupts the flow. \n\nThings get back to normal quick enough with the frenzied opening riff of 'Purgatory', another earlier song, previously called 'Floating', reworked for this album. For a long time this was my favorite track on the album. It perfectly combines an exciting, fist-pounding rythym with an infectious vocal melody and brilliant harmonies during the chorus. \n\n'Drifter' follows 'Purgatory' as an ending to the album, and what an ending it is! From the very beginning it hooks you with a unique bass line and a harmonious guitar part then kicks you in the face with a manic scream from Di-anno on top of some ripping solos from Murray and Smith. It's another hard-hitting rocker (my favorite type of song, in case you haven't guessed by now) that breaks into a dreamy and mesmerizing mid-section that features the most melodious guitar solos yet. For the final run the band goes full force in what definitely feels like a fitting conclusion to such a heavy album. Every member of the band shows their chops in the closing minute of 'Drifter', easily one of the most exciting songs ever recorded. \n\nWith their sophomore album 'Killers', Iron Maiden had fully defined their signature sound , a combination of the bluesy hard rock of Deep Purple, the metal edge of Judas Priest, and the complexity of Prog masters Yes. Killers represents a band at the peak of their creativity and skill set, ready to conquer the world through the power of their music. Needless to say their journey has been a success, and the early albums are very much a part of that. Killers features some of the best album cover, the best songs, and the best line-up in the history of Heavy Metal. It is a masterpiece, and my personal favorite record.\n",
        "\nI know this probably sounds strange, but Fear of the Dark was actually my introduction to our gods that are Iron Maiden. I mean, I knew about the other albums, I knew the choruses to \"Run to the Hills\" and \"Number of the Beast\" from a young age like every child with good parents should, but I'd never heard of albums like Seventh Son of a Seventh Son prior to my pre-teen years. I've mentioned it a thousand times before, but my early taste in music was largely the work of my mother. She was less into Maiden than she was, say Dio and Metallica in the 80s, but an appreciation was there nonetheless (likely due to the fact that Iron Maiden was and is utterly ubiquitous in the scope of metal fandom). I was born a little over a month before No Prayer for the Dying came out, so the fact that Fear of the Dark was the only Maiden album I could find in her CD stash during one of my 11 year old raids makes sense considering it was around that time she'd stopped buying tapes and recovered from taking care of an infant. I remember looking at the cover art and thinking \"Well this is weird, didn't their mascot have long hair?\" (a full eighteen years after his first haircut, of course), and figured oh well, it's probably cool so I'll just take it up to my room and listen to it while I do my homework.\n\nLong story short, I didn't think it was great, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. Now, eleven years later, my opinion has actually managed to soften. Seriously, the more I listen to this album, the more I like it. I'd always claimed that this was the last Maiden album worth listening to, but I didn't consider it one of their \"good\" ones until recently. Everybody knows the dichotomy of last two albums of Dickinson's first run (NPftD was bad because it was homogenous and bland while FotD was bad because of wildly inconsistent songwriting and an identity crisis), and maybe I'm just a total fanboy, but I actually really like some of the songs that don't sound like Iron Maiden. I honestly really dig \"From Here to Eternity\" and \"Fear is the Key\". No joke.\n\nMaybe I'm not very harsh on this album because I have a nostalgic tie to it, I won't deny that that is a strong possibility. But let's face a sad truth about the band really quickly; as great and near flawless as those seven albums from the 80s are, we've heard them all no less than four squillion times by now. In 1992, we'd already heard them two trillion times. We know who Iron Maiden is, we know what they sound like. And whether or not this album was a musical success, I give it a ton of respect for at least attempting to do something drastically different with their formula for a change. I mean yeah, Somewhere in Time and Seventh Son introduced light synths and took on a much more grand atmosphere, but they still fell in line with what the band had been sounding like since 1983. Even No Prayer was basically just ten filler tracks in a row, with only the odd moment of their past brilliance here and there (Say what you will, I love both \"Tailgunner\" and \"Holy Smoke\"). But now we've reached 1992, and you know what? This is new. This is something entirely different. I mean yeah, \"Weekend Warrior\" is an awful butt rock song and \"The Apparition\" is annoying but damn at least they're not \"The Assassin\" or \"Hooks in You\". Most fans agree they ran out of good ideas when the 80s ended, but at least here they're new bad ideas instead of incredibly safe, faceless ones like the previous album. Sometimes they strike out, but at least they're swinging for the fences.\n\nAnd when they connect, they really strike gold. The title track is a classic and a live staple, everybody knows that, and it's definitely deserving of the honor with which it's been bestowed. When the band does one of their tours where they say they'll only play old songs that everybody already likes, \"Fear of the Dark\" is the only track from the 90s that will consistently find itself in the setlist. It's a big, anthemic number, with a great buildup, excellent singalong melody, and a dark overtone that few of their songs really capture. It's the \"epic\" of this album, and like most of its predecessors, it's easily one of the highlights of the album and one of the band's best songs. I'm also a gigantic fan of the opening track, \"Be Quick or Be Dead\". The fact that this isn't a live staple is proof that there is no God. This is the closest they every got to recapturing the high speed magic that is \"Aces High\", with the only real difference being the fact that the vocals are more subdued here. I love it when Maiden really cuts loose and delivers a high-octane barnburner like this, and really wish they'd do it slightly more often than \"once every six years\".\n\nThose are the only two truly classic songs, unfortunately, though most of the rest at least rank as \"good\" at the very least. \"Afraid to Shoot Strangers\" is one of the fan favorites and one of the two songs most people can admit to liking from this album without getting weird looks. Personally, I can't fully get behind it. Of its nearly seven minute runtime, I can only say I adore a little over half of it. That long, moody buildup just goes on for far too long and does nothing to build up the rest of the song. I love how the main melody manages to sound remorseful, I love how the fast part is basically just the big epic release from \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\", I love the ludicrously over the top guitar solo, I love everything about it except the first two and a half minutes. \"Judas Be My Guide\" is another great one that deserves more love than it gets, it does a fantastic job of conjuring the atmosphere from Seventh Son of a Seventh Son and combines it with the hard-hitting straightforwardness of Powerslave. It's not as good as \"Be Quick or Be Dead\", but it's another one of the forgotten songs that would be more fondly remembered if it were placed on a different album.\n\nNow, here's where I get hypocritical, did you notice something about those four mostly-great tracks I mentioned? Every last one of them was compared to something the band did in the 80s, right after I spent all that time going on about how I respected them for trying new things. That's because even though I respect and support the band trying something new, there's really no denying that what they did in the 80s was the pinnacle of their career, so when they reach back to that, obviously it's going to be more effective than their newer, more commercial approach. There are two tracks that really exemplify this idea, and those are \"From Here to Eternity\" and \"Weekend Warrior\". The former is good, because it has a lot of energy and a fun, catchy chorus, whereas the latter sucks because it sounds like a phoned-in Van Halen b-side that the band didn't even fully believe was good enough to be on the album. \"Weekend Warrior\" is pretty much the Scrappy Doo of Iron Maiden's career, because it really kind of knocked the band down to its knees, castrated it mightily, and they've since been trying to recover, and never fully succeeding. Yeah, yeah, I know the near-perfect title track follows it, but let's just agree that \"Weekend Warrior\" is a big, steaming pile of spunk that the band pretty much chokeslammed their own career into.\n\nThere are a few other strange experiments, like the country-style groove that might as well jump out of a closet while yelling \"BOO\" in \"Fear is the Key\". Despite clashing horribly with the great, mid paced brooding of the opening riff, I still really like this song. It's Maiden trying something new, it only halfway succeeds but it's a valiant effort if nothing else. \"Chains of Misery\" and \"The Fugitive\" are two other kinda bad butt rock songs that work for what they are, despite really not being inspired or anything. I know it's kind of a cop out to do what I've been doing here (just pointing out certain tracks and explaining what they sound like in comparison to the rest of the album), but with something as wildly inconsistent and all over the board as Fear of the Dark, there's really no other way to do it. The only real constants throughout the album are the fact that the choruses are all normally pretty weak (barring \"Be Quick or Be Dead\" and \"Fear of the Dark\" of course) and the guitars really don't do anything to stand out amongst the pack, a giant rarity for a Maiden album. \n\nThe more I listen to this, the more I like it, but at the same time this is an album I \"respect\" more than I \"love\". If No Prayer for the Dying was the band half-hearting a ton of filler tracks because they'd used up most of their good ideas, then Fear of the Dark is the result of the band just throwing out a bunch of random shit and anything they could think of in a haze of incense smoke and surrounded by scores of empty beer cans. Only a couple of these ideas really stick, but I applaud the band for trying, if nothing else. For most fans, this is probably skippable, if only due to the fact that there are only a handful of bona-fide Iron Maiden classics, but if you're okay with an interesting failure, then this is definitely worth checking out. I don't consider this a failure, since I actually like a lot of the songs here that are crapped on (\"Fear is the Key\", \"Childhood's End\", \"From Here to Eternity\"), but I do understand that this was the last stumble before falling flat on their face for the next twenty years.\n\n\nOriginally written for http://lairofthebastard.blogspot.com/\n",
        "\nIron Maiden are the be-all, end-all of heavy metal. Anything you know about good metal begins and ends with Iron Maiden. A lot of diehards and purists like to knock this album for no reason other than \"it's newer\". Well, I've got some news for those people: Iron Maiden lives. Sure, they may have had a long stretch of shitty albums in the 90's (Though I admit enjoying Fear of the Dark quite a bit) but Brave New World and Dance of Death were formidable and A Matter of Life and Death was one of their best albums ever. So, what about the Final Frontier? Well, it's not easy to say. It certainly isn't any of their 80's albums, nor does it touch their 2006 masterstroke. There's a lot of brave (or foolhardy) experimentation on the Final Frontier. There are a few bland tracks that are weaker for it, but GOD DAMN, when it works, it REALLY works. But enough rambling, let's discuss this album for real. \n\nFirst thing we should reasonably note is the production. Iron Maiden being one of the most consistently exalted metal bands of all time, they can clearly afford nice things, and smooth, slick production is not exception. It's not revolutionary, but it certainly sounds as crystal-clear as you could want. \n\nBruce Dickinson admittedly shows some age on a few tracks. Mother of Mercy has him hitting some very strained, scratchy highs. But overall, he has aged very well compared to, say, Ozzy Osbourne or Robert Plant. The lyrics seem to follow a couple of major themes: Space/space travel and home. Yeah, just home in general, y'know, missing it, returning to it, thinking of it...we'll touch a bit more on that one. \n\nObviously the guitar riffs are fantastic. Nothing less than the best from Adrian, Dave, and Janick. It isn't all their most memorable work, but there are some great, shining moments. I wouldn't say they're QUITE at the to of their game, but they're pretty close. Steve Harris, as usual, really feels like a PART of the songs rather than the glue that holds them together. Nicko McBrain's drum fills are insane especially on El Dorado.\n\nThe Final Frontier is one of Iron Maiden's strangest, most unique albums. The tone ranges from hopeful and lighthearted (Coming Home) to dark and brooding (When the Wild Wind Blows), and that's another element with its ups and downs. It can be a tad jarring, especially when the opening track switches from its creepy, borderline psychological torture opening Satellite 15 to the album's self titled track, a very standard, midtempo Maiden rocker. Both tracks are very good, but at the very least I could see them being separated into two. \n\nNow let's talk a little more about notable tracks. There are some definite highlights here, and a couple of tracks that measure up to the highest tier of Maiden's catalog. Case in point, track 4, Coming Home. The preceding songs are great and all, but this is the first one that really grabs and holds you. The lyrics, the well-implemented vocals, the catchy, unforgettable chorus guaranteed to get stuck in your head...all fantastic. The Talisman is the Final Frontier's next big winner. A two-minute acoustic solo leads into a great, escalating tale about a man lost at sea. Finally, the one son that REALLY lives up to the highest of Iron Maiden standards-When the Wild Wind Blows. Iron Maiden's best songs, or at least their best songwriting, come from character studies or contemplative introspection. Hallowed Be thy Name, Paschendale, Infinite Dreams....THESE are what Maiden is about. Sure, they have plenty of songs about historical battles, and those are fantastic!-but there is still so much greater potential in some very serious psychological exploration. Wild Wind is a tale about the end of the world, how people react, how the media sensationalizes it. I know it's based on a comic book, but it's still very creative. You may have already heard it, but if you haven't, I won't DARE spoil the twist ending for you. \n\nSo, that's the Final Verdict on the Final Frontier. The tracks I mentioned aren't the only notable ones-just the ones that really kept me thinking when I walked away from it the first time. The others have grown on me though, and overall add up to a very good, worthwhile metal journey. It's a ways away from perfect, though. The space travel theme could have been explored a bit more-seriously, there's a TON of potential in there-but beyond that, the biggest problem is the constant change in feel the album goes through-and if THAT'S its biggest Achilles Heel, you know you've got a winner on your hands. If you loved Brave New World or A Matter of Life and Death, give this one a try. There's a lot to like.\n",
        "\nNostalgia! I remember I first heard Iron Maiden playing a Tony Hawk game, I had to be about 13. The soundtrack featured Number of the Beat (As well as Eddie as an unlockable skater and Maiden decks), and holy shit. At this point my metal credentials was basically the fact that I owned the Black Album, and had heard Motorhead\u2019s Ace of Spades. But that fucking scream. I was both floored and sold. The next time I was out, I went to the rock section, found the iron maiden CDs and picked up Number of the Beast. I did that thing where you straight for the song you heard, and then began playing it from the beginning. My mind was abosolutely blown for almost all of it, barring two songs - which I\u2019ll get back to. It was all downhill from there; heavy metal is one hell of a genre. \n\nNumber of The Beast is one of those metal albums that every metalhead should be familiar with on some level. It\u2019s a classic of the genre, and introduces one of the most recognized singers of metal, Bruce Dickinson. And with a new singer came a change in style. Paul Di\u2019Anno Maiden was a great band, with some real grit. Paul sort of had a punky \u201ckick your ass\u201d attitude, but could also pull off beautiful vocals for songs like Remember Tomorrow or Strange World. Unfortunately, due to his habits and the fact that we all know he sort of DOES live a punk rock lifestyle AND beat the shit out of people, especially women or something. And benefit fraud. But Bruce brought a cleaner, almost operatic voice to the fold. And to compliment this, the band also became, much like an opera, more over the top. This is the beginning of the definitive Iron Maiden style. The galloping riffs, the high range vocals, the literature and historical lyrics. Not much to be said about running from the law anymore, or bedding women. Ok, well, maybe in the early 90\u2019s. \n\nSubtlety is gone as well. There really are none of the little things that made previous albums interesting. Songs like Remember Tomorrow just don\u2019t work for this new Maiden, with its quiet bass intro, as one guitar plays the main riff, and the other adds quiet melodic enhancements to the song, and the drums sneak in soft drum fills, just before Di\u2019Anno hits a high note, and the band hits us with enough energy to make the song more powerful, but not so much that it doesn\u2019t fit in with the soft side of the song. This sort of subtlety is gone, in favor of making the music louder and more in your face. This isn\u2019t necessarily a bad direction to go in, but it does lend credence to the argument that a lot of Maiden songs sound the same. While Maiden may not be the AC/DC of heavy metal (I\u2019d say Motorhead), they do have a pretty standard formula. While they do try to add things to music with synthesizers or orchestra sections, that definitive Maiden style doesn\u2019t change a whole lot. This album is the first to really show it off, and may be the biggest perpetrator. The intro, a fun, catchy and great speedy song with a great vocal melody, really sets the tone for much of the rest of the album. The Prisoner, the famous Run to the Hills, the sequel to Charlotte the Harlot, 22 Acacia Avenue, and the title track all really show off the maiden formula. They\u2019re catchy, and have that classic Maiden galloping, driving beat, and the signature soaring vocals. The downside is that within the same year of me falling in love with t his album, I lent it to a friend, who was not nearly as into it, and upon its return said he felt like every song was Number of the Beast. Realistically, this can be seen as a valid argument. There is probably not enough true experimentation on this album, or hell in Maiden\u2019s discography for that matter. They\u2019ve settled into a particular sound, and they\u2019re sticking to it, like it or not. Anyway, moving on\u2026\n\nChildren of the Damned is a rather epic song, although it pales in comparison to the far more epic Hallowed Be Thy Name, which I think if you aren\u2019t familiar with, you need to turn in your metal card, because it\u2019s one of the best epics this band has ever done. Both of these songs start off fairly slow, and finish in with some great speed metal. Children of the Damned features a really cool section near the end, leading directly into one of my favorite glory notes Bruce has done. And that says something. \n\nThe only two songs on this album I never got were the quick, almost speed metal Gangland, which just never did it for me, and Total Eclipse. In another review which also agreed that this album was overrated, it was called into question that maybe this song is so coldly received because it wasn\u2019t on the original release, and this is evidence that most of this albums positive reception is nostalgia. Well, I can tell you that this song was on the first copy of this album I ever had, and I never knew another Maiden fan before I bought this album to influence my opinion. And I still never liked this song much. So it might just kind of suck. I\u2019m to understand that the band had to cut a song to make a b-side and these where the two bottom choices. Yeah, I agree.\n\nAt the end of the day, this album brought us a handful of classics, and truly made the Iron Maiden sound, and hell, it\u2019s probably a good starting place, but this is far from their best work. It\u2019s an influential album, and a fun nostalgia trip, but when put up against many of their other albums, in my opinion, it just doesn\u2019t hold up, although songs like Hallowed by thy Name, the title track, Run to the Hills, and Children of the Damned will all be remembered as classics for good reason. Not a usual frequent listen for me though. More like that childhood friend you grew apart from, but still occasionally call to check up on out of the blue.\n\nA quick note as far as original vs remaster. As I said the remaster features the B-Side Total Eclipse. You aren\u2019t missing much if you don\u2019t have this song. Otherwise, the biggest difference seems to be a volume boost. I\u2019ve never noticed any clipping, though I\u2019m not an audiophile. Otherwise, I really haven\u2019t noticed a ton of difference between the two versions, except maybe on a few tracks (I seem to prefer the original mix\u2019s version of The Prisoner, maybe it\u2019s some dynamic range loss, or maybe it\u2019s all in my head). However, I will say the remaster\u2019s packaging is far more interesting, so if that\u2019s a selling point, go for it. I don\u2019t think the remaster did enough in terms of the actual audio to either enhance or diminish the album\u2019s quality. Just throwing that out there if you\u2019re worried about versions.\n",
        "\nWhat a night Maiden had on Japan recording this gig, the enthusiasm of a hungry band that was about to take over the world with their storm of thundering chords and upbeat tempos is the first thing you will notice when you listen to this. It totally surpasses the quality of the recording, that is OK but not up to Iron Maiden today\u2019s standards of course. Di\u2019 Anno\u2019s vocals are another special aspect about this album; because it features a whole set that included almost all the material they had at the time so having it performed live by its original singer is a great deal; considering the short time he was in the band. The inclusion of Adrian Smith is another aspect worthy of mention, because the string department features the 3 guys from the band\u2019s golden era playing live versions of songs you won\u2019t hear somewhere else. The crowd is kind of dead\u2026 I bet they were too busy taking pictures, but it doesn\u2019t ruins it for me; the band\u2019s live sound is priceless with or without a good audience. Besides, at this point of their career there weren\u2019t any extremely famous hits to sing along with; the whole gig has an underground atmosphere more than a big arena show feel.\n\nI think Bruce is a better singer, but Di\u2019 Anno can surely sing too and he performed amazing on that night, the early punky sound of the band kind of fits his vocals that are way more raspy and angry than the elegant Bruce\u2019s air raid siren. He does well through the whole set till the end without problems. Dave and H twin guitar attack wrote a fucking legend, and this is why; they have always been sharp and accurate in every gig whatsoever. The arpeggios melted perfectly with their clean guitars, as well as the glaring twin leads and heartfelt riffing; are delivered with a passion you won\u2019t see anywhere else. Arry\u2019s bass guitar anchors the drums with the guitars with his finger hammering frenzy like no other person could, laying a king size mattress for the guitars to go and beat the shit out of everyone\u2019s neurons with their dynamic dance. The rounded tone finger picking he provides enhanced by his classic Fender Precision bass metallic edge and a hard hitting string technique bred a whole generation of bassists, and this is why: the guy plays perfect; every fucking note is nailed heavenly. On the percussive duties, Clive Burr did always a decent job but he is nowhere Nicko, who is an octopus behind the drum kit. However, his performance is clean and serves as a heartbeat to the band nicely; it\u2019s the comparison between drummers what makes it sound watered down.\n\nThe set list includes pretty much every song the band wrote at the moment, except from \u201cProdigal Son\u201d, \u201cThe Ides of March\u201d, \u201cProwler\u201d and \u201cCharlotte the Harlot\u201d. It\u2019s long, you feel it\u2019s a whole gig unlike \u201cLive at the Rainbow\u201d for example, that is very short and lets you wanting more. It\u2019s pretty solid but it suffers from the friendly atmosphere of early hard rock a lot, not every song has that particular metal mean as fuck attitude, but what the hell\u2026 The performance as I said before is near perfect, this guys are amazing musicians; there\u2019s some lo-fi cloud hanging over the record\u2019s production but it sounds good\u2026 maybe too honest, but for me that\u2019s good. This is surely not the best Maiden gig from this era but it\u2019s the most comprehensive and it\u2019s surely enjoyable!\n",
        "\nJust scored an original pressing of this on vinyl, a beautiful double LP with some of the most metallic artwork and photography I've ever seen. The gatefold photo shows a giant mummified Eddie shooting flames out of his eyes with an airborne Steve Harris doing the splits off the drum riser. METAL! The inner sleeves feature lyric sheets, thoughts from engineer Martin Birch, and awesome collages of the band and individual members at their fun lovin' best. \n\nThis is certainly one of, if not the fucking best live recording I've ever experienced, and therefore I really don't understand the nitpicking of Bruce's voice from prior reviewers. It's live, therefore it's real, it's human (not to mention pre-pro-tools) and thus there are slight imperfections. However, the band is on fire here throughout the entire performance, nailing it note for note. The liner notes of my copy say that sides 1-3 are from the Long Beach Arena in L.A. in March of '85, and side four is from the Hammersmith Odeon in October '84. It goes on to say that the recordings were picked from four-night stands at either venue. Birch's description of the recording and mastering process is very cool and his tone is quite conversational and without pretense. There's simply nothing to complain about here; this is Iron Maiden at the height of their career playing the best songs they ever wrote. So Bruce doesn't perfectly replicate his studio performance once or twice. So fucking what!? He is, after all, but a mortal man.\n\nWhen I first heard the stoic, sedate voice of Winston Churchill speaking about defending his island, whatever the cost may be, fighting in the air, in the hills, and on the streets, I knew that this was something special, and then the ass kicking ensues with \"Aces High.\" Glorious! Powerslave is my personal favorite Maiden record, so you can imagine how I rejoiced in hearing \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\" performed in full, complete with the spoken word poetry of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, the eerie creaking of the boughs, and every second of the thirteen minute magnum opus performed by each player as though it were his last. One of the band members (I believe it's Harris) introduces the song saying \"and the moral of this story is this is what not to do if a bird shits on you!\" There are moments of endearing dialogue and British wit here and there which add to the charm of the entertainers and the overall high-energy, enthusiastic vibe of the conerts.\n\nThe band's title track is a definite highlight as it thrashes your ass with extra bravado provided by Dickinson. Side four features \"Wrathchild\" so there's your fix from Killers, which, in my opinion is a bit of an overrated album. My favorite track from Killers is \"Ghengis Khan,\" and ironically enough, Paul Di'Anno isn't on it. Let's face it folks, Maiden didn't fully spread its heavy metal wings until the addition of not only Bruce Dickinson but also the athletic and energetic Nicko McBrain. Other than \"Iron Maiden\" they also do \"Running Free,\" and close with \"Phantom of the Opera,\" so there's a good smattering of the best of the Di'Anno era.\n\nLike I said, nothing at all to gripe about here. Iron Maiden's finest offerings captured live to tape by the expert ears of Martin Birch. Simply put, if you love Iron Maiden you will love this; let it warm your soul and gladden your heart. Yep, I'm gonna go ahead and do it, 'cause this album just makes me feel so damn good. That's right. One hundred per cent to the best band of the NWOBHM and this, their 1984-85 triumph of the stage.\n",
        "\nThe only complaints that ever come from reviews of Piece Of Mind are that the record contains a couple of fillers in the form of Sun And Steel (which I wholeheartedly disagree with; it\u2019s full of great riffs and is a terrific yarn about Samurai soldiers) and Still Life (which people may have a point about). Regardless, the only problem I have with this record is the production.\n\nImagine if you will an elastic band which has been pulled and stretched until it\u2019s just about to snap. That is how thin and tight this production is. It\u2019s too distracting for me and why the album isn\u2019t in my top three records for 1983. People including Steve Harris himself have often cited the debut self-titled record of having the weakest production in the Iron Maiden catalogue, but I think the buzzsaw guitar sound worked really well on that. Three years later Martin Birch simply produced the hell out of their new record, being far too clinical and precise. Luckily, fans only had to wait a couple of years to hear the majority of songs as they should have been recorded when Maiden released the incredible live album Live After Death. The sound quality was vastly improved, being richer and fuller and giving the instruments the amount of scope they really needed for that epic metal sound.\n\nSo with that major gripe out of the way, I can tell you that Piece Of Mind kicks off in the usual triumphant Maiden style. First track up is Where Eagles Dare. A rolling drum segment from new drummer Nicko McBrain kicks off proceedings before the galloping bass and dual guitars begin their attack. Every song contains at least one classic (I know classic is a term I throw around, but in every sense of the word these songs are truly classic.) lick, bridge, solo or vocal that has been with me as long as I can remember. It\u2019s ridiculous that when I listen to the record I know each and every word before Bruce sings it and I know each and every guitar line (with air guitar at least) before it arrives as well. These songs have grown with me throughout my teenage and adult years. Maiden fans will all say the same about the band. How the hell can any unit come up with so many great ideas? Just from Nicko\u2019s opening snare hit I know that Quest For Fire is about to begin and I still laugh at the teenage me trying to come to grips with playing the record backwards to decipher the oddness of the message that precedes Still Life. It\u2019s that iconic to me.\n\nSteve Harris said at the time that his favourite track was To Tame A Land, which was to originally meant to be called Dune after Frank Herbert\u2019s novel. Unfortunately for the band, Herbert was disgusted about a band such as Iron Maiden using his title and Harris promptly altered the song\u2019s moniker. The worst thing about the song is its title. Everything else is perfectly crafted. This is what the band do best, seven and a half minutes of intricate and yet totally accessible heavy metal. To Tame A Land is up there equally with Iron Maiden's other lengthy tour de forces in Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son and Rime Of The Ancient Mariner. Harris had every right to be proud of it.\n\nAs well as this, the album contains two of the band's greatest singles in The Trooper and Flight Of Icarus. It contains one of the true great live songs in Revelations (its recorded counterpart is just a fraction too slow). Nicko\u2019s addition to the band completed what most fans call their definitive line up and the band's upcoming two tours made them huge all over the world. If the production was better, then this really would be in with a chance of being labelled one of the greatest records of all time.\n",
        "\nThis album seems to be the forgotten gem in Maiden's discography. You don't even have to like metal to have heard of songs like Number of the Beast or Run to the Hills. And I haven't met too many people who haven't heard of Aces High or Two Minutes to Midnight. But ask anyone about Somewhere in Time and you often don't get much of a reaction. This album had no big single that everyone knows about, and despite how great this album is, it seems often overshadowed by Maidens other masterworks.\n\nBUT WHY!? This album is damn near flawless! And yet even the band themselves don't play much off of this album. Wasted Years and Heaven Can Wait are the only songs you have ANY chance of seeing get played live by them anymore. And I think it's ridiculous! Oh yeah, play freaking Futureal and Sign of the Cross but no Caught Somewhere in Time!? No Alexander the Great!!?? NOT EVEN FUCKING DEJA VU!!??\n\nSo yeah, this album is the masterpiece that is forgotten, which is a shame because it just may be Maiden's best ever. This is the first album to have synthesizers popped into the music, but no keyboards like on Seventh Son, just guitar and bass synths. And the addition is subtle in parts and grandiose in others, but is definitely a fantastic addition to the bands already epic sound. Just listen to the AWESOME intros to the opener or Heaven Can Wait. It sounds fantastic and creates more of that science fictiony feel the band was going for on this album. And though not a concept album, the theme of time is apparent on most of the songs here. All except Sea of Madness, Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner, and Heaven Can Wait have time as a theme if you count Alexander the Greats historical lyrics as being time oriented. \n\nAnd lyrically this album is top notch. Every song has a catchy chorus that sticks in your head (in the case of Heaven Can Wait perhaps a little too sticky). I've had every song stuck in my head at least a hundred times I swear. And the lyrics aren't just stupid catchiness, they are original, and at times hard to decipher. I'm still not 100% what Caught Somewhere in Time is about, but the lyrics have an intellectual feel to them the whole damn album. Alexander the Great's lyrics are literally just historical facts, somehow pulled off in a melodic fashion by the legend himself, Bruce Dickinson.\n\nAnd the vocals are as good as it gets as well. I can hear him belting out 'Time, Is Always on my Side' right now as I'm writing this review. If you've listened to Dickinson era Maiden before (and by god, you really should get on that if you haven't) you know how awesome the vocals are. But if you SOMEHOW haven't, his vocals are just godlike. Operatic in quality and precision, with the power of a nuclear bomb. There isn't much more to say. Other then that he is Bruce Dickinson, and he rules you!\n\nInstrumentally is what really makes this album stand out. The galloping bass which is so loud in the mix it can and will crush your ribcage. The dueling guitars and the fantastic drumming of the weirdest named person in metal. The strings as I mentioned are accompanied by synths in some parts, but not throughout the whole album. It certainly is not abused. I don't see how anyone would find the synth accompaniment a nuisance, but if you need your metal absolutely purely guitar-bass-drums then I have wasted your time. \n\nThe songs are all fantastic, with no filler whatsoever. Caught Somewhere in Time serves as my favourite Maiden song as of now, with it's infectious intro and pounding bass, and the grand instrumental section in the middle. Wasted Years is the closest thing this album had to a hit, and with that amazing guitar intro who wouldn't like it? An emotional vocal delivery makes this a Maiden classic. Sea of Madness is one of my favourites, and is probably the fastest on here, and who can resist the 'OHHHHHHohohOHHHHH, My eyes they see, but I can't believe!'. Just awesome. Heaven Can Wait is best known for its chorus, but I favor the bass intro and the choral section in the middle. Though I;m not going to deny the infective power of that chorus...\n\nLoneliness of the Long Distance Runner is my least favourite song on here, and is certainly the least memorable. The intro is great though, and I still never skip it. Stranger in a Strange Land follows, and is the second weakest track in my opinion. But the main riff is excellent and I can't help but scream in my car: \"LAND OF ICE AND SNOOOOOOOOW!\" Deja Vu is favourite of mine, and is the only song here not breaking through the 5 minute mark. But it is still one of the finer songs here. And of course, ending with a Maiden epic is the excellent Alexander the Great. Though on the whole an excellent song, the instrumental section should've been trimmed a tiny but I feel. But still a great ender to a near-perfect album.\n\n**EDIT**: After more listens, Lonliness... has become a favourite of mine. Stranger in a Strange Land is what I consider the weakest track, but it still kicks ass. So now I certainly consider this to be a PERFECT album that you must now go buy!\n\nOriginal lyrics, great use of synthesizers, and excellent songwriting add up to one of metals best records, Iron Maiden's forgotten opus Somewhere in Time gets a 100 out of 100 or a 5 out of 5.\nHighlights:\nCaught Somewhere in Time\nWasted Years\nSea of Madness\nHeaven Can Wait\nLonliness of the Long Distance Runner\nStranger in a Strange Land\nDeja Vu\nAleaxander the Great\n",
        "\nLet me start off by saying, although Iron Maiden isn\u2019t exactly the AC/DC of heavy metal (I give that title to Motorhead), despite all their experiments with synth, longer songs, darker atmospheres, and orchestras, the basis of Iron Maiden\u2019s sound hasn\u2019t truly changed much. If you think you\u2019d be happy with anything with that general sound, you\u2019ll probably be satisfied with this. That being said let me tell you why I wasn\u2019t.\n\nThe second of the two Blaze Bayley albums, Virtual XI goes a different route than its predecessor. While The X Factor was a darker album to suit Blaze\u2019s voice, this album seems to go a more tradition approach, and tries to ask Blaze to do his best Bruce Dickinson impression. This is part of the problem because that\u2019s just not possible for him. The other issue is that many of the songs are longer than they need to be. \u201cDon\u2019t Look To The Eyes Of The Strange Educated Fool When Two Worlds Collide\u201d just goes on longer than it needs to, and won\u2019t be remembered within 5 minutes of the album ending. \u201cComo Estais Amigos\u201d (I thought it was Como Estas, but hell, I always got C\u2019s in Spanish) is a ballad-like song that I just never found interesting. \n\nThe chorus for many of the songs here are repetitive, and most aren\u2019t more than a line or two. Speaking of repetitive choruses, \u201cThe Angel and the Rambler,\u201d as I call it, is a song that makes you almost capable of blowing your fucking head off in that department. Seriously, the first time I heard this song it gave me explosive diarrhea. Maybe you think that\u2019s a joke but I was on the toilet before the fucking thing ended. It starts off with this annoying \u201cboop boop boop boop\u201d thing with the synth after the initial guitar intro that sounds like maybe it wanted to be \u201cWasted Years\u201d if Wasted Years sucked. The synth throughout the song is cheesy, but far from unbearable. In fact the song is almost good until the chorus. First he sings it fast. Then slower. Then faster. This is very similar to my complaint about \u201cFortunes of War\u201d on the previous Blaze album. However, this song is far more painful than \u201cFortunes of War,\u201d because not only does the chorus suck, but after a verse or two, he sings it again. 22 times total he sings the fucking chorus. This is a terrible 10 minute song that could have been an all right 4 minute song.\n\nBut it\u2019s not complete shit. It\u2019s close, but this album does have \u201cFutureal,\u201d a good somewhat fast paced song that kicks the album off in a way similar to the classic Maiden songs \u201cAces High\u201d, and you could easily see Bruce running around the stage like a maniac to this song. They\u2019ve done songs similar to this, and usually better, so it\u2019s not a buying point, but hell, it might be worth downloading for a buck. The other song worth hearing is \u201cThe Clansman,\u201d and epic song about being Scottish or something. It\u2019s by far the best song on the album. \u201cWhen Lightning Strikes\u201d is pretty forgettable, but its decent when it\u2019s playing at least it\u2019s not almost 7 minutes long. It\u2019s the closest this album has to a third good song. I wouldn\u2019t really go out and buy this album, but if maybe you feel the need to own this to complete your Maiden collection, it\u2019s maybe worth a listen. That\u2019s really the only reason to own this album anyways. If you feel the need to buy this to complete a Maiden collection, try to find it used. It\u2019s not worth any more than $5.\n",
        "\nLet me say right off the bat, that on a musical level, I\u2019d grade this much higher. However, being what this actually is, I really can\u2019t. Assuming I counted correctly this is Iron Maiden\u2019s 7th \u2018Greatest hits\u2019 album. It\u2019s a follow up to their \u201cSomewhere Back in Time,\u201d best of, which chronicled their career through the 80\u2019s. This one handle\u2019s the 90\u2019s and 2000\u2019s. Which itself is the problem.\n\nThe 90\u2019s were a controversial time for maiden fans to begin with. Most consider No Prayer for the Dying and Fear of the Dark to be the weakest Dickinson-era albums, with opinions ranging from flat out hatred, to those who consider them good, just not up to par. Adding to the fact that after these albums was the replacement of Bruce with a singer that many consider to be inferior, and the writing of two albums often considered inferior. Now, no Blaze tracks actually appear. Any songs he sang in-studio are represented by a live version with Bruce on vocals. Two of these three \u201cBruce versions\u201d are from Rock In Rio, and the other was a B-Side, so there\u2019s no previously unreleased tracks to gain fan support. \n\nThat being said, all of the essential 90s songs are there. \u201cFear of the Dark,\u201d although a live version is here, along with \u201cThe Clansman,\u201d \u201cBe Quick or Be Dead,\u201d and \u201cBring Your Daughter\u2026\u201d all appear here, although even though I like \u201cHoly Smoke,\u201d I wouldn\u2019t have included it, and would have replaced it in favor of \u201cMother Russia.\u201d In fact, many songs here actually don\u2019t seem necessary, like \u201cTail Gunner,\u201d which myself along with a few reviewers before me have called a poor man\u2019s \u201cAces High.\u201d And I goddamn love \u201cAfraid to Shoot Strangers,\u201d but I don\u2019t know that I\u2019d include it, since maiden doesn\u2019t really have many other songs like it. Isn\u2019t the point of a best of to interest the uninitiated? One interesting note, is that despite being named \u201cFrom Fear to Eternity,\u201d obviously a play on \u201cFear of the Dark\u201d and \u201cFrom Here to Eternity,\u201d the latter song is not featured on this set. \n\nAnyway, with 2000\u2019s \u201cBrave New World,\u201d Maiden seemed back track toward pleasing fans, and \u201cDance of Death,\u201d while not as universally applauded, seemed to please most fans. \u201cA Matter of Life and Death\u201d seemed to be something of a love it or hate it album, and \u201cThe Final Frontier\u201d seemed fairly well received, this being from my own experiences as a fan, and with other fans. But none of these four albums seem to sit as well with fans as their heyday material. And this is important because it makes one wonder, who this compilation is geared towards? As someone trying to discover a new band, why would you want to purchase an album of the best songs during a controversial band period? You want to put out the best you have to offer for a \u201cBest Of.\u201d Sure it says \u201cThe Best Of 1990-2010,\u201d but there\u2019s no disclaimer saying \u201cby the way, this isn\u2019t considered our golden era.\u201d So it SHOULDN\u2019T be for new fans. Maybe if they bought \u201cSomewhere Back in Time,\u201d which by the way, why is that one disc, and this one two? Surely the band\u2019s Golden Era should deserve more coverage. And it\u2019s surely not for fans, who should really have everything on this to begin with. I really don\u2019t understand.\n\nSo while this is a fairly solid Best Of for this era of Maiden, I don\u2019t get why it needs represented as a standalone compilation. There\u2019s nothing Here for old fans, and new fans should pass this over in favor of a \u201cGreatest Hits\u201d that at least has the decency to include\u2026 you know\u2026 their greatest hits. If you\u2019re new to Maiden, Number of the Beast, while not their best by a long shot, is a safe bet, and if you NEED a best of, Best of the Beast or Somewhere Back In Time should do it. Or Ed Hunter if that still exists at a reasonable price. The game isn\u2019t great, but the track listing is the best I\u2019ve seen.\n",
        "\n\"Killers\" could be seen as a transition album for Iron Maiden. Although the band had a relatively firm grasp of their galloping sound since the debut, Paul Di'Anno's punkish style and image had a pretty significant impact on the way Maiden carried themselves. \"Killers\" indeed picks up where the self-titled debut left off, but nothing is done with the same sense of sincerity and excitement. Perhaps \"Killers\" was needed in order for the band to finally opt out of their ties with Di'Anno and move forward, but we have here a record that falls under a terminal case of 'second album syndrome'. Iron Maiden's signature sound is here, but the magic certainly isn't.\n\nLooking back on my fond memories of the debut, Maiden may not have had the degree of sophistication in their sound and lyrics as they are known for today, but, as the towering \"Phantom of the Opera\" would testify, they were capable of great things, fusing raw energy with technicality and pomp likely influenced by the progressive rock of the decade past. The idea of moving one step forwards, and two steps back seems to apply here. Although there is a slight progression towards a grittier heavy metal sound, the aggression and intelligence have been siphoned out. \"Killers\" puts all of its best tunes at the front; although \"The Ides of March\" functions as a simple, anthemic intro to the record, its martial rhythm leaves a greater impression than most of the songs here. \"Wrathchild\" has become a bit of a fan favourite, and there's no doubt that it takes the dubious prize of album highlight. Steve Harris' bass licks on \"Wrathchild\" are some of the best of his early career, and though Di'Anno's performance throughout the album feels generally inferior to his vocals on the debut, he executes some incendiary wails. \"Murders in the Rue Morgue\" follows up \"Wrathchild\" quite nicely, delivering a faster pace more indicative of the album as a whole. After that, the songs begin to blur together. Iron Maiden deliver many of the same tricks each song, and though it is made a worthy listen for their consistent tightness as a band, the songwriting lacks the excitement and distinctiveness most of us have come to expect from this band. The one exception later in the album is the relatively long \"Prodigal Son\", which actually ends up feeling like an unwelcome change of pace for the album. It's as if Maiden suddenly decided to toss out their metal direction in exchange for a painfully watered down prog rock style. Di'Anno's vocals notwithstanding, \"Prodigal Son\" sounds like something Rush could have done on \"Fly By Night\", then decided to toss away.\n\nThe first two Maiden albums are usually seen as being apart from the rest, if only because Bruce Dickinson had not yet entered the fold. Paul Di'Anno is a great frontman with a charismatic delivery, but his vocal work on \"Killers\" lacks the precision and ballsy guts it sported on the debut. His performance is decent, but he favours the 'charismatic' angle of his inflections far too much over the more melodic aspects here. As a result, DiAnno's vocals still feel larger-than-life, but there's not a single vocal melody on the album that really sticks, even after several listens. In short, the worst thing that ever happened to \"Killers\" was the fact that it was being expected to follow one of the best heavy metal debuts ever. There is still much potential in Iron Maiden's style- which remains powerful and exciting- but it's a tough sell to say that the album is really worth checking out for anything more than the fact that it's Iron Maiden. Luckily, it wouldn't be long before the excellent \"Number of the Beast\" was released under the vocal guidance of Brucey, but considering the sort of artistic success Maiden had with Di'Anno with their first record, it's pretty difficult not to feel disappointed.\n",
        "\nBy 1986, Iron Maiden had enjoyed four years of great success and respect in the metal community. They had created three original albums in that four-year span, largely to the genius of Adrian Smith and the iron (no pun intended) vocal chords of Bruce Dickinson. Paul Di'Anno's Maiden had its charm, but this was the Big Leagues. Yet, Maiden's originality was starting to wear thin. Not content to keep cranking out paint-by-numbers metal CD's, they took the perfect course of action: a concept album, specifically about time travel. Results are wildly successful. \n\nFirst thing I should mention is production. It's every bit as slick as it was on Powerslave, and that is even more vital on an album with a notably more \"technical\" style. This adds hugely to the experience. \n\nAt the time, many metal bands employed synths to try and sound \"modern\". This could either succeed greatly or fall hilariously flat (Judas Priest, anyone?). Fortunately, Somewhere in Time's synths are hardly noticeable, save for the opening to Caught Somewhere in Time, my favorite track on the album. The synthesizers are well-done here and contribute greatly to an already-great song. The synths do add to the atmosphere in places, like the chorus to Heaven Can Wait, but ultimately do not try to steal the spotlight. And that is a good thing for sure. \n\nGuitar work is stellar through and through. Riffs are almost as good as Powerslave, better than Number of the Beast....which is to say, somewhere on par with Piece of Mind. The guitars actually sound a little bit formulaic, but when the formula works so well, there's no need for radical change. Solos are fantastic. This album contains some of the best solos in Maiden's career (Wasted Years, Sea of Madness, Stranger in a Strange Land) the solos aren't as blazing as on past albums, but in a way you can feel the passion in them, and that is incredible. \n\nSongwriting is very good. While some songs are mildly campy (Heaven Can Wait) and some have flat-out ridiculous bits (Deja Vu) there is much poignancy to be found. The album's hit single, Wasted Years, is amazingly inspirational, a reflection on the futility of living a bitter life. Caught Somewhere in Time has a mystical feel, and is truly memorable. Writing is grade-A, but still not the zenith of Maiden's career. \n\nThe songs here are mostly gallopers, in the vein of The Trooper or Run to the Hills, but galloping songs are what Maiden does best. Steve Harris's bass is great as always, and Nicko actually does fantastically in sections on the drums. The only song that does not fit this description is Alexander the Great, a pretty fantastic Maiden epic which chronicles the titular ancient Greek hero. \n\nUnlike most concept albums, any song from Somewhere in Time could be taken out and used as a single, and no aspect of the song or it's juxtaposition lost. This is normally a good thing, though sometimes a bit disappointing. Nothing here is filler, but not quite every song is top-notch, most notably Heaven Can Wait and The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner. But underrated gems like Deja Vu, singalongs like Wasted Years and cool, alien-sounding epics like Stranger in a Strange Land far outnumber the weaker material. A must-have for all Maiden fans.\n",
        "\nThe early years of the nineties saw Iron Maiden go through some changes. Guitarist Adrian Smith left the band and Bruce Dickinson recorded his first solo album. Janick Gers, who played with Dickinson on first solo album \u201cTattooed Millionaire\u201d, replaced Smith and then Maiden soldiered on until the end of Dickinson\u2019s tenure. This culminated in an event broadcast on MTV in North America and on pay-per-view in Britain as Iron Maiden played their last concert with their famed singer. However, this was more than just a concert as illusionist Simon Drake shared a stage with band performing ridiculous magic tricks. It all adds up to some very cheesy and crazy moments, but it\u2019s very fun to watch.\n\nThe set list consists of 17 tracks covering all Maiden\u2019s career up to that point. Other than taking in the band\u2019s performance, Drake pulls some shenanigans during some of the songs. The most ridiculous and comical trick is during \u201cFrom Here to Eternity.\u201d Drake\u2019s assistants kidnap Dave Murray and then Drake proceeds to cut off Murray\u2019s hands. When it came time for the solo in the song, Drake walks with the hands onto the main stage with Murray\u2019s guitar and plays the solo with his hands. It\u2019s so cheesy, but it\u2019s awesome.\n\nThis Drake character is something else. He is dressed in a leather jacket with a tough guy shirt on and his hair is a perfect do. He reminded of the Andrew \u201cDice\u201d Clay minus the sunglasses. The facial expressions he makes are humorous as well as his horror magic tricks. He tortures some members of the audience who anger him. The neatest trick is when he grabs a member of the audience, puts a sack over his head and cuts if off. The devious Drake then proceeds to toss the head to his assistants and play soccer with it. To finish the trick off, he grabs a mannequin's head and draws a clown face on it. He then puts the head in the sack and on the beheaded victim and then voila, the guy has his head back, but with a clown face on it. It sounds a bit silly, but it's sweet seeing it.\n\nWith the band itself, most of the Maiden classics are present like \u201cThe Trooper\u201d, \u201cHallowed Be Thy Name\u201d, \u201cFear of the Dark\u201d, and \u201cNumber of the Beast.\u201d It was especially menacing when Dickinson began \u201cHallowed Be Thy Name\u201d singing on a part of the stage with a hangman\u2019s noose. It was a nice touch and I give much credit for singing a tough song flawlessly.\n\nSome Maiden bites that are not heard that often like the instrumental \u201cTransylvania\u201d and \u201cBring Your Daughter\u2026To the Slaughter\u201d were a joy to hear, especially the gliding tones of \u201cTransylvania.\u201d I don\u2019t think there is any way the band would want to play \u201cBring Your Daughter\u2026\u201d live today. \u201cBe Quick or Be Dead\u201d was busted out as the show opener and the aggression is still in place in the live setting. It\u2019s is a really underrated song too; Maiden needs to dust off in the near future.\n\nThe last part of the concert is when the cheesiness is taken to another level. Iron Maiden finishes with the song that bears its namesake and as they are taking their final bows, Drake kidnaps Dickinson. Drake then puts Dickinson in an \u201ciron maiden\u201d and kills him! Eddie comes out with a sword and chops off his head and puts it on a spike right next to Paul Di\u2019Anno\u2019s dome. It\u2019s very ridiculous, but it happens except the part about Di\u2019Anno\u2019s head.\n\nThe only improvement this special event needed is the sound. The vocals are way too low in the mix for the first few songs and the guitars are way too loud. There were some parts where I could barely hear Dickinson sing and that was frustrating.\n\n\u201cRaising Hell\u201d showcases Iron Maiden at a time of change and at a volatile point of the band\u2019s history. Dickinson sums up it perfectly at the end of the show when he tells the crowd \u201cWell, we\u2019ll see you sometime.\u201d Drake\u2019s horror magic tricks are good for a laugh and some of it is way over the top, but in the end its magic and Iron Maiden. I would definitely watch that on pay-per-view.\n\nnicksmetal.blogspot.com\n",
        "\nShort and effusive, this recording shows the best incarnation of the early Iron Maiden, with the addition of guitarist Adrian Smith in a cheetah skin vest, the classic era string department was complete. The songs were already there, they just had to rock on. Every song featured here is a classic, the opener \u201cThe Ides of March\u201d is played in the speakers just before the bands kicks in the stage, to set the mood. Immediately they start with \u201cWrathchild\u201d a song I\u2019m not a big fan of, but it is one of the band and crowd\u2019s favorites. The audience\u2019s reception is amazing, if you take notice that the band have released just one album at the time of the concert (December 21st, 1980) which also means that some of this songs were unreleased at the time, the ones featured on the \u201cKillers\u201d album.\n\nThe song that album is named after is the third track of the album, one of the first vicious and galloping riffs they wrote, an absolute winner. The guitar harmonics and the beginning are priceless, and played just like it sounds in the album. \u201cTransylvania\u201d comes up next, with all of its tempo changes and bass fills. Fast paced and heavy, another classic. The twin guitar leads section after the solo is priceless and executed perfectly. \u201cPhantom of the Opera\u201d is the first epic Arry composed and arranged, it fucking rules. Those creepy melodies from the beginning and the fast and fierce verse riff can\u2019t be matched. The show\u2019s closer was \u201cIron Maiden\u201d the punkiest song by the band, I don\u2019t love it but I still think is a pretty solid song and don\u2019t mind to hear it on every show. There is not a lot of crowd interaction in between songs, they just came to play that day and let the music do the talking\u2026 at the end of the show some Eddie\u2019s appear on the stage and some smoke is displayed.\n\nThe band\u2019s stage presence was strong since that day, lots of headbanging from Harris and Murray, a cool looking guitarist that laughs while playing (Smith) and a frontman with a very strong personality enjoying their brightest moments. The bands image is very 80s obviously, Harris wore a silly colored spandex and the like, funny shit. Their performance is 100% accurate every note is played without any feedback or weird string-scratch. Pauses are done coordinated, the way it should be. The recording itself is top notch, music feels so live and realistic, just as if you were in the same room with the band! Production is crystal clear; this recording is the best of their early live albums.\n",
        "\nI don't know for the Benjamin Breeg's enigmatic identity but I do clearly hear The Reincarnation of Iron Maiden, over the planetary zenith, once again breaking their own status quo into the most serious, atmospheric LP to date since the record just wipes out most 90's material, making them instantly prepared and reinitiated for the 21st century, Iron Maiden. \n\nThis is the 2006 Iron Maiden's expose of revolutionized sound, theatrical epicness, ambience and astonishingly well translated war-like pre-apocalyptic atmosphere of despair, fear, tragedy, hope, victory - making this record capable in general for the delivery of some of the richest atmospherical, emotional and progressional experiences ever produced by the band in one, I'd say most mature LP, again, to this date. \n\nSteve Harris' songwriting skills clearly can not deteriorate. His inspiration will with over the +90% probability result in a successful aspiration of the spirited, creatively hungry listener. \"A Matter Of Life And Death\" is the opus that lyrically and musically evolves around religious, with sometimes occult thematics, war-like and pacifistic ideals & sentiments making you question the circus that world has become with all the political clowns and pawns. Who are we and where is the religion in this interactive occurrences between god and the mortal one (soldier, guardian of justice etc.), what are the actual meanings and goals that war pandemonium elevates upon nations and their citizens's freedoms & national sovereignty. In short the thematic concept will creatively expand you even beyond the lyrics, making your synaptic connections and subconscious refreshed and enriched with questions and ideas, deeper meanings of the political and social realms we are now very linearly drowning ourselves in, globally, not only in the US of A, if you listen this record with more prosperous goals than with just for the purpose of listening to another record of the legendary NWOBHM trademark band.\n\nBruce Dickinson again delivers the vocal performance of his life continuously expanding over his own boundaries. We can clearly hear more dedicated operatic and theatric performance that very convincingly compensates over the written tabs and harmonies then melodies, great moody emotional anthems like the initiating track, \"Different World\". Well done transitions in \"For The Greater Good Of God\", \"The Legacy\" etc. it's just astonishingly done and man again reinforced my own reasons for considering him as an absolute icon of heavy metal along with several other names. Melodies are performed with strong emotional transitions and fast - dynamic intervals, of the progressive label worthy. \n\nNicko's gallops' are greatly placed, his rhythmical sense and the unstoppable percussions still hold his trademark but in a slightly more incremented way in terms of quality drumming (progressive needs). 3 guitar section of Smith, Murray and Gers again accomplishes the interaction, and the sense for melody and interchanges quite masterfully. Solos are fantastic and I just wonder how they pick who performs them, since they are just energetically abundant and powerful, maybe the most serious guitar work ever defined by this band's guitar trio.\n\nArrangements and mixing were accomplished very well by the producer Kevin Shirley and Maiden definitely found their subject for all the future endeavors, no doubt. Sound is very precise, pure and sonic, making it provenly as a great engineering move since the record was derived directly from the masters, and this is the exact atmosphere and conceptual environment where the quality of the record should be given that character of production.\n\nIn an outro of this review, I'd just like to highlight the fact that except the standard audio CD, there is the so called 'special edition' featuring \"Making of\" short movie that I'd highly recommend for the true fans and zealots alike so that they could then identify the band in a new creative environment by watching the creative process in footage and how naturally they are setting new standards for themselves. This album was a pure Iron Maiden record for the modern ears, with more audible complexity (that's why it's harder to grasp to the standard, \"give me The Trooper\" fan), progressive dynamic, time interval changes without fill-ins, obviously longer track duration, excellent lyrics and completely spot on theme of the pseudo-concept.\n\nIron Maiden has done what few could, they transcended and the implicit answer is that they chose the right path in their focus, their work and followers, in a matter of life for the life.\n",
        "\nIron Maiden's career is a perfect example of one that managed to not only achieve greatness, but maintain it with a relative consistency. Sure, there are a handful of albums from the nineties that are generally considered 'weaker' than the others, but when some fans of the band- myself included- regard a lot of their new stuff to be on par with the classic material, that's damned near unheard of. Upon the release of \"The Final Frontier\" (Maiden's fifteenth studio release to date), the band had been together for the better part of 35 years in one shape or another. Admittedly, their style has not changed much this time around, although given that their sound has earned them a cross-generational legion of fans, this isn't such a bad thing. \"The Final Frontier\" is an epic quest of heavy metal, and it's home to some of the best tracks the band has ever done.\n\nIron Maiden may have generally stuck to a signature sound throughout their career, yet especially since 2000's \"Brave New World\", they have been going down a more progressive path with their music. Maiden already had plenty of experience with the proggy, epic form of metal throughout the eighties; \"Phantom of the Opera\", \"Alexander the Great\", and \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\" all come to mind. With \"Brave New World\" however, the progressive direction they had always acknowledged began to take a greater step forward. Of the three new millennium albums that came before this, \"The Final Frontier\" rests at a general par. It may be a tit less consistent than \"Brave New World\" or even \"A Matter of Life and Death\", yet it makes up for it with its highlights. As \"Dance of Death\" impressed me most with \"Paschendale\" and its haunting title track, \"The Final Frontier\"s greatest contribution to Maiden's discography is through a few of its best moments. \n\nAmong these 'highlights' are the eerie opener \"Satellite 15... The Final Frontier\", an intensely atmospheric introduction recalling Dickinson's work with Ayreon, building up gradually and making way for a rock-oriented latter half. \"The Man Who Would Be King\" is a progressive powerhouse with some of the album's best guitar work. Above all else however, is the epic \"When the Wild Wind Blows\". Based on a similarly titled animated film, it's a sombre piece of music that tackles the topic of nuclear war from the everyman's perspective. Unlike a million thrash metal bands who may fetishize nuclear war as something 'epic' or extreme, \"The Final Frontier\"s highlight focuses on the feelings of confusion and helplessness that arise from the catastrophe. Within ten minutes, \"When the Wild Wind Blows\" enjoys an impressive emotional arc, ranging from the intimate to the balls-out epic. It was a real joy to hear something like this on one of the band's latest releases- one of my now-favourite Maiden tracks, and on I would rank up there with the band's longstanding epics.\n\nThe instrumentation is a little more laid back on \"The Final Frontier\" than they have been in the past. The guitar solos are still as fiery as ever, but Iron Maiden put less of an emphasis on speed here than they did on \"A Matter of Life and Death\" and prior. In its place, Maiden's proggy undertones have taken a step up. In the end however, these changes are minute in the overall scope. Iron Maiden are largely up to their old tricks once again, and though some fans will be disappointed to hear the development (or lack thereof) in the band's sound, their style still sounds fresh and vital.\n",
        "\nI once spoke with another Iron Maiden fan who told me that he counted 1982's \"Number of the Beast\" as the band's 'true' debut. To him, Maiden couldn't be Maiden without Bruce Dickinson's trademark vocals. Of course, by the time Bruce had joined the gang, Iron Maiden were already running wild with potential. True enough, Dickinson's quasi-operatic tenor is now one of the band's most distinctive qualities, but this debut, and its sequel, \"Killers\", still hold up well. Even before they had truly made their mark on heavy metal, Maiden were already rocking.\n\nI was first introduced to DiAnno-era Maiden through the mini-epic \"Phantom of the Opera\". Now a longtime favourite of mine, it's easily enough to foster some sort of interest in the band's early work. Especially regarding this track, it's not surprising that it took Steve Harris such a long time to find musicians willing to pursue this then-relatively progressive and technical brand of heavy metal. Fusing galloping rhythms with guitar harmonies and the atmosphere of progressive rock, \"Phantom of the Opera\" is a certain foreshadowing of what would later come for the band. Add in the trademark literature-based lyrics and you have a classic Maiden song, in spite of Smith and Dickinson's absence. Before even discussing the rest of the album, it's enough that one of the band's best songs is here.\n\n\"Phantom of the Opera\" is above and beyond the most complex piece of music on \"Iron Maiden\", but the band gives a touch of sophistication to their aggression throughout the album. It's true that there is a sense of punk-ishness in large part thanks to the pummeling rhythm, but Steve Harris' progressive influences are in plain sight. Particularly on the eerie \"Remember Tomorrow\", Maiden divulge a sense of atmospherics that I've rarely heard in a NWOBHM act. On the other hand, there's raw carnage to be experienced in \"Running Free\" and the upbeat title track. One of the most common criticisms of this album is that Iron Maiden had not completely found their 'sound' yet, but in spite of the lineup differences, these guys seem to have had a firm idea of where they wanted to go musically.\n\nNaturally, Paul DiAnno's vocal performance will be the sorest part for Maiden fans, if only for the fact that he ain't Brucey. For one, he's certainly not as brilliant a vocalist as Bruce is, yet his carefree, almost brutish approach to singing works well for the rawer sound Iron Maiden were bringing at this point. I imagine the 'rawness' will turn off some of the band's softer, or more progressively inclined fans, but it brings a more organic sound to their music than most of their following studio work. The production is a real highlight on \"Iron Maiden\", in spite of the fuzzy distortion and busy performance, things come through feeling warm and 'in-your-face'. The best way I might describe the production is that this sounds most suited for the atmosphere of a small club show, whereas \"Number of the Beast\" onwards gives the impression of a bombastic arena affair.\n\nIt's obviously nowhere near as 'matured' or 'realized' as the Iron Maiden they would become with later albums, but this debut should not be discredited by fans or newcomers. Although the band we know nowadays as Iron Maiden only shares two members with this incarnation, the signature sound and style is here, not to mention that \"Phantom of the Opera\" still stands as one of their greatest compositions.

        "\nIn many ways \u201cNo Prayer for the Dying\u201d, which was fraught with the unenviable burden of being the follow-up to the monumental \u201cSeventh Son of the Seventh Son\u201d, has never gotten a fair shake. First of all, writing an album that would match the sheer genius of its predecessor was probably a hopeless endeavor right from the start, particularly considering that Adrian Smith, the band\u2019s talented second guitarist and an integral part of Maiden\u2019s songwriting team since \u201cKillers\u201d, had just left the line-up and been replaced with Janick Gers, who was a competent substitute but couldn\u2019t match Smith\u2019s songwriting prowess. The fact that Steve Harris insisted on recording the album \u201clive\u201d, effectively curtailing Martin Birch\u2019s influence on the production process and resulting in a rather substandard overall sound, certainly didn\u2019t help matters.\n\nTo this day, \u201cNo Prayer for the Dying\u201d is still the one Iron Maiden album \u2013 perhaps excluding Blaze Bayley\u2019s ill-fated stint behind the mic \u2013 that is most maligned by fans and critics alike. Even band mastermind Steve Harris has often stated that the album was a mistake and that the band had gone in the wrong direction, mentioning Queensryche\u2019s epoch-making \u201cOperation: Mindcrime\u201d, which had made a huge impact on the metal scene just two years earlier, as the album the band should have used as a model and blueprint instead. Then again, we\u2019re talking about the same guy who has repeatedly admitted to not being fond of \u201cSomewhere in Time\u201d, one of the band\u2019s most revered and perhaps best albums, because of (among other things) its supposedly \u201cdated\u201d sound. That just goes to show that a band\u2019s opinion of a certain album does not always coincide with that of the fans, although in the case of \u201cNo Prayer for the Dying\u201d, it mostly does.\n\nAs far as the actual music on \u201cNo Prayer for the Dying\u201d is concerned, there isn\u2019t much to say that hasn\u2019t already been mentioned a thousand times. It is undeniably different from most of Maiden\u2019s other albums, opting for a far less epic and much more direct, \u201chard-rocking\u201d approach, but comparing it to some of the milestones in Maiden\u2019s discography is the wrong premise anyway. To those who can keep an open mind, however, \u201cNo Prayer for the Dying\u201d may turn out to be a surprisingly entertaining and rewarding affair. It\u2019s true that the lyrics are probably the corniest and most clich\u00e9d Maiden have ever written: you usually don\u2019t expect profanities (such as the infamous \u201cflies around shit, bees around honey\u201d line in \u201cHoly Smoke\u201d), hilarious song titles (\u201cBring Your Daughter \u2026 to the Slaughter\u201d) or satirical excursions into the field of sadomasochism (\u201cHooks in You\u201d) on an Iron Maiden album. At the same time, these lyrics fit the hard-rocking vibe of the songs while Bruce Dickinson\u2019s altered singing style \u2013 his vocals are decidedly harsher, raspier and less operatic than usual \u2013 is the perfect way to present them.\n\nIn the relatively epic \u201cMother Russia\u201d, there is only one song longer than five minutes on this album, and even it is a far cry from such monumental, grandiose compositions like \u201cAlexander the Great\u201d or \u201cRhyme of the Ancient Mariner\u201d. Then again, who cares when the songs on offer rock as hard and are as much fun to sing along to as, to name just a few, \u201cPublic Enema Number One\u201d with its intricate and melodic soloing, the galloping \u201cFates Warning\u201d with its very heavy riffing or the aforementioned \u201cBring Your Daughter \u2026\u201d with its amusing yet amazing \u201cwohohoho\u201d choir. Further songs deserving special mention are the thoughtful title track and the opening \u201cTailgunner\u201d, which is definitely an inferior \u201cAces High\u201d rehash but a very good song nonetheless. It sometimes seems like those dismissing \u201cNo Prayer for the Dying\u201d as bland and unimaginative are the same ones constantly criticizing the band for its cerebral and progressive leanings of more recent years. You just can\u2019t have it both ways, and while \u201cNo Prayer for the Dying\u201d is hardly Iron Maiden\u2019s most original effort, it\u2019s hard to find too much fault with an album as consistent and entertaining as this.\n\nEven twenty years after its publication, \u201cNo Prayer for the Dying\u201d is still being analyzed way too much when in fact it\u2019s just a no-frills metal record that doesn\u2019t claim to be or pose as anything else. While it should in no way be counted among the band\u2019s best efforts and may not be what most of us expect from an Iron Maiden record, that certainly doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t be enjoyed for what it is or that it doesn\u2019t have its rightful place in Maiden\u2019s exquisite discography. On the contrary, it adds another interesting facet and is therefore an asset to Maiden\u2019s extensive catalog, which would not be quite as fascinating without it.\n\nChoicest cuts: \u201cNo Prayer for the Dying\u201d, \u201cPublic Enema Number One\u201d, \u201cFates Warning\u201d, \u201cBring Your Daughter \u2026 to the Slaughter\u201d\n",
        "\nAh yes, Seventh Son of a Seventh Son. The last of the great classic era Maiden albums. While many people consider this album to be the culmination of Maiden's classic era and an undeniable masterpiece, it doesn't have quite the same effect on me. Sure, Bruce sounds great along with Steve Harris and Nicko and the guitar work on this album is pretty damn awesome. The performance of the band is not at all what makes this album not a masterpiece to me as they are in absolute top form here.\n\nThe real issue here is consistency. Seventh Son continued the experimentation that was begun on Somewhere in Time with more progressive structures and keyboards, but this time the keyboards are much more prominent and I would consider this album as close to a progressive metal album as Iron Maiden ever got. However unlike Somewhere in Time, which is an album that I can listen to from start to finish and my personal favorite Maiden album, this one has some issues that drag the weight of the album down a bit. \n\nThe album's title track is by FAR the best song on this album and one of the best Maiden songs ever recorded. I'm not sure if they just put the most focus on this song or what because the rest of the songs aren't even close to it. There's some good songs, (The Evil That Men Do and Moonchild), some pretty good songs, (The Clairvoyant, Infinite Dreams, Only the Good Die Young), and absolute garbage (Can I Play With Madness?). The Prophecy is the only song that I like almost as much as the title track, though it seems to get a lot of hate for whatever reason. \n\nOne of my biggest problems with this album is that some songs that would be good songs are ruined by one bad section in the song. The most glaring example is Can I Play With Madness? which is a pretty good song until that god awful chorus starts and ruins the whole song (not that the rest was that good to begin with). The same thing happens in the Clairvoyant but the rest of the song is good enough to save it from being the biggest clunker on the album like Madness is. \n\nIf you like Iron Maiden you're more than likely to enjoy this album, and the title track is reason enough to own it. While this album isn't quite the masterpiece its hailed to be, it is the last of the classic Maiden albums so have yourself a listen and pretend that the band didn't release the heaping pile of shit that is No Prayer for the Dying 2 years later...\n",
        "\nRunning Free was the first single released by Iron Maiden and it really sets the tone for what people could expect to come from the NWOBHM movement. While the Soundhouse Tapes had been out for a year at this point, that release only exhibits a fraction of the energy presented on this one. The Soundhouse Tapes show Maiden taking their baby steps in the metal direction, but Running Free shows Iron Maiden finding their niche in the metal scene and fully embracing a new type of sound and attitude that would be emulated and praised by so many bands after them. \n\n\nIt is also of note that this is the first appearance (partially obscured for the release of the eponymous LP) of Eddie. Even from the very beginning, Derek Riggs knew how to make a damn great album/single cover. In addition to the ominous Eddie image, I always thought the band graffiti on the wall was really cool too. Looking closely I see AC/DC, Sex Pistols, Scorpions, Led Zeppelin, Judas Priest, and the most obscure one, Vambo (For those of you who don't know, Vambo is the fictional superhero created by the Sensational Alex Harvey Band). \n\n\nThe song, Running Free, is the same version that would appear on the album. I'd say the two focuses are on the dual lead guitar harmonies and Paul Di'anno's vocals, although it is undoubtedly Steve Harris that is controlling the song as with most of Maiden's repertoire. Paul's voice has really matured since the Soundhouse Tapes and really drives the song along with Steve. Dave and Dennis really shine just after the second chorus with the dual cascading guitar solo and the heavy breakdowns before the third verse. Steve's bass is always prominent in the mix as with any other Maiden song, as it should be. The only thing that annoys me about the song is Clive Burr's drumming. Clive Burr, in my humble opinion, has so much more potential in his playing than what is showcased on Running Free. Instead of doing the over-used \"Gary Glitter Rock n Roll Part 2 bass snare beat,\" I had expected so much more from such a talented drummer. Never fear, Clive redeems himself on all of his future Maiden releases behind the kit. Although Running Free is not the most technical or fantastic Maiden song from the early days, it's a crowd staple and just a fun, metal classic.\n\n\nBurning Ambition, however, beats Running Free a million times over. As far as I know, Maiden have never played this song live and that is a crying shame. Dave Murray begins with a clean, spacey chorus intro then bursts into the song's trademark celestial melody. This lick just soars over everything else in the mix and is just so damn catchy, so damn IRON MAIDEN. This beautiful melody by Dave, alone, blows Running Free out of the water. The verses have Dave riffing fast D-A-C power chords and Paul singing in the higher register of his range. This song is total Iron Maiden attitude and is performed flawlessly. After two verses, Dave erupts into his signature, searing solos and rounds it off with a double tracked dual lead ending. It's fast, it's melodic, it's pentatonic Dave Murray legato shred. After that the song repeats from where it started. I can only guess they chose not to play this song live because there are only two verses and only two riffs, but Christ, the single is worth buying just for this song. If you hadn't guessed, Dave Murray completely steals the show on Burning Ambition. \n\n\nThe Running Free single showed Iron Maiden had more than enough potential to be at the forefront of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal. It was a affirmation of the band's will and desire to become destined for greatness and achieve the utmost respect in metal circles. This single shows off Harris' songwriting and how the band had become a cohesive force of true heavy metal. I only docked off 5 points for Clive's drumming on Running Free (believe me the man is a tour de force in all other Maiden releases ex. on Genghis Khan, Phantom of the Opera, and Killers he is quite exceptional) and the fact that Burning Ambition has never been played live on any Maiden tour (but that's just me being nitpicky). I highly recommend this single and buying it in conjunction with the Sanctuary single. Fantastic.\n",
        "\nAs I sit here listening to The X Factor, I can't help but feel frustrated with the undeserved hatred towards this misunderstood masterpiece. If you ask metal fans what they think about Maiden's first album with Blaze, more often than not they'll say it was a mistake, the album that should've never been, the lowest point in Maiden's career. \n\nGranted, everybody is entitled to their opinion and many of my Maiden-loving friends share this attitude towards The X Factor, but I certainly wish there were something I could do to make them appreciate the dark beauty of this superb album. \n\nNow, I've always thought that if you have to explain why something is good, chances are it's actually not that good at all. See, you can't make people like sushi if they find it disgusting no matter how many times you explain why sushi is delicious. They know what they like and what they don't like, but sushi is an acquired taste... just like The X Factor. \n\nI'll admit that I didn't like The X Factor either the first time I listened to it. I was sitting there in my bedroom feeling totally baffled. I just couldn't figure out what Maiden had tried to do with such a weird collection of sad and dark songs. There was no The Trooper, no glorious choruses, no hooks, no catchy songs, no trace of the Iron Maiden I'd come to love. Nevertheless, The X Factor grew on me and if you were to ask me what my favorite Iron Maiden albums are, I wouldn't even have to think about it and I'd say \"Piece of Mind\u00a8 and \u00a8The X Factor\".\n\nThe biggest problem with The X Factor is not the music, but the fact that people fail to appreciate it for what it is. Fans of Maiden that don't get The X Factor compare it to the albums Maiden recorded with Bruce back in the early 1980s and that's where the problem lies.\n\nLet me explain why I love The X Factor and the reasons you should listen to it in a different way. If this review makes you want to listen to it again and give it another chance, I'll be satisfied. Who knows? You may well rediscover it and come to love it.\n\nThere are bands that have chosen to always write about the same topic over and over again, bands like Cannibal Corpse (gore) and Deicide (Satan and a never ending war against Christianity). Not that there's anything wrong with that. I actually happen to like them both, but there are other bands that like to write about many different topics. A myriad of them, if you will, bands like Megadeth, Metallica and Iron Maiden. 22 Acacia Avenue? A song about a prostitute. Fear of the Dark? Self-explanatory. To Tame A Land? A famous book you should read if you haven't already. Where Eagles Dare and Tailgunner? World War II. Weekend Warrior? Soccer hooligans. \n\nWhat am I getting at? Well, Steve Harris has never restricted his songs to a single topic. He's penned songs about movies, TV shows, literature, history, etc, etc., and he's even written some very personal songs (Blood Brothers and The Educated Fool - both of which were written after The X Factor came out, but you get the point). Such composers can't help it if the way they feel in a particular period of their lives influences their songwriting. I mean, I guess Alex Webster (Cannibal Corpse) will always write about zombies, regardless of what's going on in his life. But not Steve Harris, and that is something people always forget when they bash The X Factor. They forget that when it came to writing songs for the album that would eventually be called The X Factor, four major changes had taken place in Steve Harris' life, changes that undoubtedly impacted his music. What changes? 1. He got divorced, 2. Bruce left Iron Maiden, 3. Martin Birch stopped producing Iron Maiden records, and 4. His father passed away.\n\nThese four major changes are not to be underestimated and neither should their immediate effect on Maiden. First his divorce. He had been married 16 years. Not 2... not 5... not 8... but 16 years. And it all came crashing down in 1993 with all the pain a divorce usually entails. How do you think he felt? I don't know how many years he dated his ex-wife before they got married, but we could be talking about a relationship that may have well lasted 20 years. Maybe even more.\n\nThen, Bruce announces he's leaving the band. Another important relationship in his life comes to an end, and a painful one at that. Remember, Bruce Dickinson never told Steve he was leaving the band. Steve found out because Rod told him, and according to the official biography, Steve felt betrayed and hurt. The frontman of your band, a person you may not be the best of friends with, but with whom you undeniably had an important relationship with, stabs you in the back and walks away after what? 10 years or more? How would YOU have felt?\n\nAnd then another blow. His friend Martin Birch who had produced and engineered every single Maiden album since 1981 decides to call it quits. The man responsible for that classic Maiden sound we all love says \"ok. I'm done\". I'm sure that was not an easy time for the genius behind Iron Maiden.\n\nAnd on top of all that, his father passes away. \n\nSo, in the face of all that, how can we expect Steve Harris to write about books, historical figures, or pyramids? The man was depressed, for God's sake, and that depression can be heard throughout The X Factor.\n\nAll you have to do is read the lyrics. It's pretty clear, actually: \"I'm scarred for life, but it's not my flesh that's wounded\", \"Sometimes I wake, I feel that my spirit's broken\", \"Now that your faith will be put to the test. Nothing to do, but await what is coming\", \"I've felt like suicide a thousand times or more\". These lyrics are, if you ask me, a cry for help. They're a unique opportunity to get inside Steve Harris' head and feel what he was going through in such a dark period of his life. So no wonder The X Factor is a dark album. It just couldn't have been any other way. Comparing it to Seventh Son of a Seventh Son or Piece of Mind is totally unfair. Iron Maiden was a different band when they wrote Infinite Dreams. It was a different time period with different circumstances.\n\nFurthermore, The X Factor was not produced by Martin Birch. Sometimes it's easy to forget how much a producer can influence a band's sounds or the decisions made during the recording process. But remember the role played by Bob Rock in Metallica's eponymous album? Remember Scott Burns' influence in death metal? Birch \u00a8simply\u00a8masterminded most of that amazing Iron Maiden sound that catapulted them to world fame. And he was now gone. \n\nAnd then there's the issue of Blaze's voice. I think he takes too much flak, considering the fact that his voice fits perfectly with the dark atmosphere of the album. And not only that, you must also take into account the fact that the odds were stacked against him from the get-go.\n\nHe was chosen to replace Bruce Dickinson, one of the greatest heavy metal singers of all time. Blaze had big shoes to fill. Well, that sounds like an understatement. He had HUGE shoes to fill. There's just no way he was going to live up to the expectations. It was an impossible job. Even if there are many fans out there who like his voice, most people can't help thinking \"he's no Bruce Dickinson\", and that's also unfair. He did the job he was hired to do and his performance on The X Factor is superb. Period.\n\nThe X Factor is not an album for everybody. There are no songs to sing along to (with the exception of Man of the Edge, perhaps). It's not a fun album in the conventional sense of the word. It's slow and you won't hear Maiden doing what they do best, but every song is haunting and seductively simple. The lyrics are powerful and evocative. The feelings that emanate from them are not consistent with your typical heavy metal spirit, but that's the beauty of this album. \n\nI don't know if I've managed to make you see things in a different way. I certainly hope so. But if not, let me try one more time before I end this review. Listen to The X Factor without comparing it to any other Maiden album. Appreciate it for what it is. Carefully read the lyrics and submerge yourself in Maiden's darkest period. Feel the pain Steve Harris felt and the endless questions that surely tormented him at the time. Let the gloomy atmosphere of The X Factor surround you and you'll understand why it doesn't have a single (truly) catchy song.\n\nThe X Factor is a beautiful masterpiece. A pessimistic, melancholic, and heartbreaking album. But it is indeed not beautiful in a conventional way. The X Factor holds the allure of the Dor\u00e9 illustrations for Dante's Divine Comedy. See for yourself. \n\nListen and understand. \n\n\u00a8Life seems so pathetic I wish I could leave it all behind.\u00a8\n",
        "\nBefore I fall victim to an unfair flame war, let me assure you that I've been a loyal Iron Maiden fan for over 25 years. I have every single album they've ever recorded, I own the videos, the singles, the t-shirts, the posters, the flags, the video game and I've seen them live on numerous occasions. Yes, I know every single song by heart and can sing along to 99% of them. Like any other self respecting Iron Maiden fan. Yes, I've read the official biography more than once and can even quote whole passages from it. \n\nWhy am I saying all that? Well, for a very simple reason. Criticizing Iron Maiden is no small feat. It is not easy to criticize a band that has a career spanning over 30 years and a band that has made some of the best heavy metal albums you could ever hope to listen to. So I felt I needed to prove my never-ending love for Iron Maiden before I dared to commit heresy and say that Iron Maiden made an overlong and boring album. \n\nYou see, I'm such a fanboy that I will even defend The X Factor and Virtual XI. But my loyalty to Iron Maiden does not cloud my judgment and does not keep me from admitting that with The Final Frontier Iron Maiden has hit rock-bottom in terms of writing music.\n\nNow, I will not launch into a detailed analysis of every note or riff played on this album, because I am not a musician and I lack the theoretical knowledge to do so. So I just can't talk about musical composition. I cannot criticize their use of scales or harmonies. However, I can speak as a fan and I will tell you how I feel when I listen to these songs. I can tell you about what sounds right and wrong. I can tell you about what is exciting and what's dull, annoying and repetitive. That I can do. \n\nYou see, I don't think you need to be a composer to criticize music. Of course, if I were a musician, I could hit the nail on the head and give you a list of theoretical reasons why The Final Frontier is not a good album. But every single fan out there has an instinct that tells him/her if an album is good or bad. We may not be able to explain why, but we know. Oh, yes. We do.\n\nLet's start, shall we?\n\nMy first pet peeve with The Final Frontier is that the songs are unnecessarily overlong and this is a trend we have witnessed since Iron Maiden released Dance of Death back in 2003. \n\nI don\u2019t have anything against long songs, as long as the song really needs to be long. For instance, if you\u2019re telling a complex story that requires more than 6 or 7 minutes to be told. Remember The Rime of The Ancient Mariner? Or if the song is interesting enough, from a musical point of view, to keep your attention. And by that I mean if the song is dynamic and exciting, like The Thin Line Between Love and Hate, with its glorious chorus and fast pace, or Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, with its amazing guitar solos.\n\nThe problem with most of the songs on The Final Frontier is that you feel the band now writes long songs just for the sake of writing long songs. Granted, Mother of Mercy, Coming Home and The Alchemist clock in at less than 6 minutes, but you can\u2019t say the same about the rest of the album, which feels repetitive and flat. Songs like The Man Who Would Be King or When The Wild Wind Blows are perfect examples of this. There\u2019s nothing really exciting going on. They\u2019re tedious songs. Period. Gone are the catchy choruses and the amazing hooks. \n\nNow it\u2019s all about being epic. Hey, Steve. Guess what? Not every song has to be epic. There was a time when you were into writing catchy tunes like Flight of Icarus or Wasted Years. Whatever happened to writing songs your fans could sing along to? The fact that you can write long songs doesn\u2019t mean that you have to. Keep it simple and be epic if you really need to. \n\nI feel Iron Maiden has chosen a path that will ultimately lead to their musical demise. Whereas in the past their albums were full of glorious and thunderous metal songs and your occasional epic tune to balance things out, now it\u2019s the other way around. And the result is a band that plays on autopilot and merely goes through the motions and that no longer writes memorable songs. I bet you\u2019d be hard-pressed to find a single Maiden fan that actually believes The Final Frontier surpasses their early efforts. \n\nIf all your songs start out slow and then pick up the pace, aren\u2019t you on autopilot? If all your songs have 3,000,000 time changes, aren\u2019t you on autopilot? If all your guitar players have at least 1 solo per song and they must all play a solo, because hey we have 3 guitar players and they have to do something besides playing riffs, aren\u2019t you on autopilot? \n\nAnd I have to say this. Did we really need another Iron Maiden album? I am not so sure. In spite of being a huge fan, I feel Iron Maiden no longer has anything to give in musical terms. They\u2019ve already achieved greatness and they will never surpass what they did back in the early days. All they are doing now is repeating themselves over and over again and that\u2019s what I\u2019m afraid of. Unless their next album is really exciting, because I\u2019m 100% sure there\u2019ll be another album, and the band will keep being the target of criticism. Wouldn\u2019t it have been better if they had retired right after Dance of Death? I really think so. Because AMOLAD was nothing to write home about either. It was another over-indulgent album with long songs and repetitive riffs and songs that seemed to be going nowhere. And then you get the obligatory live album and live DVD and Greatest Hits...(yawn).\n\nYou have to know when to stop. Maybe it is about time Steve Harris & Co. called it a day. It has indeed been a great ride, but enough is enough.\n",
        "\n'Dance Of Death' marks the second chapter in Iron Maiden's six-piece lineup. Although changes within the ranks and the addition of a third guitarist would normally be something only fans would be interested in, it did mark a musical shift for the band. Starting with 'Brave New World'- an album that's been since considered one of the greatest metal albums of the new millennium- Iron Maiden brought their distinctive style back to the forefront, and haven't looked back since. Most notably, singer Bruce Dickinson was back with them, but there is also a progressive edge to the songwriting that makes this period in Iron Maiden's history arguably their most exciting. 'Dance Of Death' balances out between their classic style and more intricate composition, and despite the relatively weak album art, Maiden makes it clear that they are far from exhausting their artistic spirit.\n\nThere will certainly be those who argue that Iron Maiden have 'barely' changed their sound over the decades, but comparing their early, punk-infused energy to the symphonic grandeur of the title track on 'Death Of Death', it's undeniable that Iron Maiden have picked up some new tricks. Perhaps moreso than 'Brave New World', Iron Maiden balances two distinct approaches on this album. The first is their classic brand of songwriting, one that often uses the signature 'guitar gallop', biting solos and choruses that could get a stadium's worth of metalheads singing along. 'Rainmaker' stands out particularly in this regard, with a futuristic main riff and pleasant vocal leads from Dickinson. 'Montsegur' is arguably the most traditional Maiden track here, a song somewhat reminiscent of 'The Trooper' that could have snuck onto an earlier Maiden album without arousing much suspicion.\n\nAs many of Maiden's fans might agree however, the highlight of Iron Maiden's recent work lies in the 'epic' songs they have been focusing on. Although they flirted with longer song structures as far back as their debut album, 'Dance Of Death' truly indicates their recent preference for involving, progressive composition. Without the slightest doubt, the two highlights on 'Dance Of Death' are the occult-themed title track, and the cinematic 'Paschendale'. The first of these sees Iron Maiden going down a familiar route of storytelling, about a man abducted and taken to an undead ritual. 'Paschendale' is a tribute to the eponymous battle in WWI, attempting to give the same sense of grim reality that 'The Trooper' gave the Crimean War. Musically, both tracks represent some of the most powerful songwriting I've ever heard Iron Maiden do, opening gracefully, and dramatically building to something powerful and even symphonic. As has become the standard for Maiden, the lyrics are handled with sophistication, generally falling upon history or philosophy for inspiration.\n\n'Dance Of Death's weakness comes in the form of songs that come close to being called 'filler'. 'No More Lies', 'Gates Of Tomorrow' and 'New Frontier' are all pleasant enough Maiden tracks, but even after giving 'Dance Of Death' many enjoyed listens, I found nothing stirring about them. Thankfully, the is more excellence than disappoint on 'Dance Of Death', and while I could have asked for a greater consistency and flow, Iron Maiden's progressive material here is some of the best work I've heard them play.\n",
        "\nLong held to be Iron Maiden's immortal, classic contribution to the world of metal, Iron Maiden has undoubtedly had brighter musical moments than this, but its place as a go-to essential is not unfounded. Graced with some of the band's most recognizable songs, 'Number Of The Beast' lays down a foundation for all of the Maiden work to come. With galloping rhythms, acrobatic vocals, aggressive speed and relative lyrical sophistication, Maiden's third album is a great place to start with this band's illustrious career.\n\nAs part of the NWOBHM (New Wave Of British Heavy Metal) movement, Iron Maiden has a very signature sound to them here, one that's likely already indelibly etched into many a metalhead's mind. Twin-harmony guitars and a rhythm section that achieves a rolling pattern, akin to the galloping of a horse, are the two distinguishing traits of the band's music. Although these songs are quite catchy, there is a technical sense to the riffs. Speed metal is obviously a factor here, although it's used moderately enough for the music to be melodic and memorable. The two most famous tracks off the record are the title track, and the crowd pleaser 'Run To The Hills'; a song that features everything that fans love about Maiden. Here, the lyrics revolve around European conquest of the New World; an ambitious topic in comparison to the bawdy 'sex and drugs and sex' themes that many metal bands of the time were into.\n\nIron Maiden had been a capable act with singer Paul Di'Anno, but Bruce Dickinson's voice really brings the band's sound to a new level of distinction. He is one of those singers who manages to impress in a lower range, as well as a blistering falsetto. The epic closer and highlight 'Hallowed Be Thy Name' is most indicative of this. Beginning quite slowly, Bruce is able to set the scene of a dark holding cell, then raises the intensity as it becomes clear that the protagonist is doomed to be executed. Iron Maiden's sense of refined aggression is matched perfectly with this dark subject matter, although there are certainly more upbeat moments on the record, such as the tongue-in-cheek '22 Acacia Avenue'.\n\n'Number Of The Beast' really is a perfect place to start with Iron Maiden, even more so than any best-of compilation. Although I think the quality of music would get higher as they tread towards more progressive domains, the classic quality and consistent songwriting makes this album a winner.\n",
        "\nIt's not that this is a boring album, it's that a few songs drag on WAY too long. The Angel & The Gambler from the video version (available on the Futureal single or Visions of the Beast) is actually a fun little rock song, but to DOUBLE the length of the song with the same chorus being repeated about 506834205 times just kills it on the album. The same goes with Don't Look To The Eyes Of A Stranger...the intro and fast parts are killer, but again, there's just way too much chorus.\n\nFutureal is a total classic, as is The Clansman (one of Maiden's finest epics). Futureal is the pure speed metal classic here (every Maiden album has one...other than No Prayer), and much better than its X Factor counterpart, Man On The Edge. Upbeat, simple, killer solo.\n\nThe Clansman, along with its X Factor counterpart Sign Of The Cross (and the live versions of Afraid To Shoot Strangers), is the highlight of the Blaze era. Slow brooding, epic chorus, and Blaze at his vocal peak. The live versions with Bruce are nice, but there's something about Blaze's gruffer voice that really sets the studio original apart.\n\nThe rest of the album can be lumped in as \"good\" Maiden, but it's all pretty generic Maiden, as well. Lightning Strikes Twice has a great vocal/guitar melody in the chorus. When Two Worlds Collide is the typical ballad-into-crusher Maiden song (see: Afraid To Shoot Strangers, No Prayer For The Dying, Infinite Dreams), but fails to really grab you by the balls. The Educated Fool is basically When Two Worlds Collide, but falls short of even falling short. Como Estais Amigos closes the album in a way that no other Maiden album has done since Killers (Drifter): with a thud. Generic song and doesn't really get going or even attempt to do so.\n\nAll in all, you won't miss not having this, but Futureal and The Clansman should find their way into your collection somehow (The Essential Iron Maiden has both songs). It's not that Blaze is bad (actually, he's in top form here, even compared to the epic Silicon Messiah solo abum), it's that Steve Harris just happened to have the great idea of making a 40 minute album 50 minutes long.\n",
        "\nThis is by far the greatest album ever recorded. The production is tight - every instrument has its place in the mix - and the songwriting is top-notch. There are no wasted riffs or shredding solos for the sake of shredding solos (the 5 minute instrumental section of the title track is totally melodic and well-composed...you could probably hum it note for note after 2 or 3 listens).\n\nThe most apparent thing about this album is that Maiden went full-bore into Synthland after a dabbling on their previous album (Somewhere In Time, for those whom have never listened to a note of metal...). Moonchild opens with a soft acoustic passage into a guitar synth riff before the guitars come crashing in and own everything in sight.\n\nInfinite Dreams is the most perfect metal ballad ever; emotive verses give way to a crushing middle section. Can I Play With Madness is actually a fun rocker with more prominent synth parts. The Evil That Men Do is the clear winner of Side A with an incredible riff set and one of Adrian Smith's finest solos.\n\nSide B, starting with the title track, is the \"concept portion\" of the album, with each song going from the birth of the Prophet, his prediction, his being cast out, and his death. The Prophecy is the weakest song on the album, but the classical guitars at the fadeout are an awesome lead in to the bass intro of The Clairvoyant. Only The Good Die Young is the most underrated song from the \"classic\" era of Maiden (and easily the best song never played live), and is awesome speed metal (with a nifty little bass solo, and one of the greatest Maiden lyrics ever: \"So, until the next time, HAVE A GOOD SIN!\"), ending with a reprise of the intro to Moonchild.\n\nThe title track deserves special mention...it's a masterpiece of heavy metal, and what every prog and power metal band aspires to write. It's heavy, melodic, the keyboard use is perfect, and the overall vibe of the first half is epically foreboding to the rest of the album. The instrumental part is simply amazing. Even the riffs under the solos are incredible! The harmony portion that concludes the song is one of Maiden's finest moments as a band.\n\nThis is definitely an album that everyone should own, even if the album cover makes no freakin' sense.\n",
        "\nOn the one hand, Iron Maiden\u2019s latest studio album, ominously titled \u201cThe Final Frontier\u201d, is a tough nut to crack. On the other hand, it is exactly what most of us should have expected all along \u2013 the logical continuation of the artistic path the band has taken since 1995\u2019s \u201cThe X-Factor\u201d. How I hated that particular album upon its release, and how I prayed to the metal gods that it would prove to be nothing but an aberration, that the band would soon return to the sound of their revered classics from the 1980s or even that of lesser albums like \u201cFear of the Dark\u201d or \u201cNo Prayer for the Dying\u201d. That never came to pass, of course, but a strange thing has happened since then: over time, I have grown accustomed to and come to appreciate Maiden\u2019s \u201cnew\u201d musical direction, which is characterized not so much by the instantly recognizable, swift galloping headbangers of old but by slower, longer, epic songs that are broad in scope as well as bold and almost progressive in their approach.\n\nIt may have taken the band a little while to master that new style, but I feel that with their last two albums, the brilliant \u201cA Matter of Life and Death\u201d and \u201cThe Final Frontier\u201d, they have finally arrived. It\u2019s not like \u201cThe Final Frontier\u201d, just like its predecessors, doesn\u2019t come with some excess fat that could have been trimmed. It\u2019s true that many of Maiden\u2019s more recent tracks tend to be a little long-winded, what with all the two-minute long intros and outros. At nearly 80 minutes (!) in length, \u201cThe Final Frontier\u201d can be a bit hard to stomach, so one or two fewer tracks or a slightly more streamlined songwriting approach may have helped.\n\nAlas, since this issue is unlikely to go away anytime soon, we might as well stop complaining about it, especially because Maiden haven\u2019t forgotten to treat us to some shorter, more concise tracks as well. The galloping \u201cEl Dorado\u201d and the fast-paced \u201cThe Alchemist\u201d are two obvious examples, and both would have held their own on Maiden\u2019s classic records from the 1980s. For some reason, \u201cEl Dorado\u201d in particular has been heavily criticized, which I find peculiar as it would have fit perfectly on, say, \u201cPowerslave\u201d. The ensuing \u201cMother of Mercy\u201d, a rather straightforward track, has caught some grief for Bruce Dickinson\u2019s supposedly strained vocals. While it\u2019s true that he doesn\u2019t always hit the high notes quite as cleanly as he did some 25 years ago, it doesn\u2019t detract from the fact that he\u2019s still a phenomenal singer, which he also proves in the immensely catchy power ballad (is that term still in use?) \u201cComing Home\u201d.\n\nBut it\u2019s really the long tracks that have become Maiden\u2019s bread and butter, and for the most part, they do not disappoint. The only exception is the 11-minute long \u201cWhen the Wild Wind Blows\u201d, which has its moments but ultimately doesn\u2019t have enough interesting parts going for it. Moreover, the initial five or six minutes are just not metal enough, owing to the weak main riff and flowery, annoying, almost pop-like melody. The song isn\u2019t a complete dud, but I feel like the album would be better off without it (a trait it has in common with the rather bland title track). Another track that seems quite inconspicuous at first but grows immensely the more you listen to it is \u201cStarblind\u201d. Dickinson\u2019s vocal lines really make this song, which is both progressive and catchy at the same time. \u201cIsle of Avalon\u201d is very good as well, building up nicely from the solemn intro all the way to the soaring chorus. However, the best song on the album and, in my humble opinion, possibly Maiden\u2019s best tune since the glory days of \u201cSeventh Son\u201d is the breathtaking seafaring epic \u201cThe Talisman\u201d \u2013 yes, it really is that good! This song is, in a word, perfect, from the poetic intro over the ripping riffs and trademark twin guitar harmonies to the amazing chorus. The second-to-last track \u201cThe Man Who Would Be King\u201d is no slouch either, although it doesn\u2019t quite fulfill its potential. By the way, has anyone else noticed that the melody at the end bears a striking resemblance to \u201cThe Prophecy\u201d from \u201cSeventh Son of a Seventh Son\u201d?\n\nOne thing in general Maiden have done noticeably better on \u201cThe Final Frontier\u201d than at any point since Dickinson\u2019s return to the band is to avoid the overly simple, repetitive choruses that reared their ugly head on all the more recent albums. One thing that hasn\u2019t changed (and likely never will change), however, is the barely adequate production or mixing job courtesy of one Mr. Kevin Shirley. Then again, it is probably Mr. Steve Harris himself telling the poor sap precisely which buttons to push and which knobs to turn in the studio. In other words: what we hear is very likely the exact sound Mr. Harris deems appropriate for Iron Maiden, so Shirley shouldn\u2019t have to shoulder all of the blame.\n\nOh well, as long as the boys give us a couple more good albums before they call it quits, I won\u2019t complain about such trifles. Aside from some minor flaws, \u201cThe Final Frontier\u201d is another excellent effort proving once again that Maiden have accomplished the remarkable feat of staying artistically relevant after all these years instead of turning into a sorry self-parody endlessly rehashing some 25-year old classics everyone has already heard a million times. In the end, isn\u2019t that all we can realistically ask for? I certainly wouldn\u2019t be averse to getting treated to the second coming of \u201cPiece of Mind\u201d, but in the meantime, this latest incarnation of Iron Maiden will do just fine for me.\n\nChoicest cuts: \u201cEl Dorado\u201d (witness the trademark Maiden gallop in full swing), \u201cComing Home\u201d (a very pleasant surprise), \u201cStarblind\u201d (see \u201cComing Home\u201d), \u201cThe Talisman\u201d (arr mateys, \u2018tis the real deal!)\n",
        "\nAfter 15 albums and being one of the most recognisable bands in heavy metal, Iron Maiden need no introduction. Iron Maiden is a band that takes its themes, concepts, and lyrical content very seriously, and on this album there is no exception. This album runs a gauntlet of songs about space, whether it's exploring it or being stranded in it. And there are also a lot of themes about going home and missing loved ones; kind of about being away from where you're used to being. \n\nIron Maiden sure takes their sweet ass time talking about this, too. This album is almost an hour and twenty minutes long, making it their longest studio album to date. The reason for this is not extra tracks. There are ten songs on the album.\n\nFollowing 2006's A Matter Of Life And Death, Iron Maiden have fallen in love with the concept of the 'intro'. Only several songs on this album get on with it, so if you're looking for lean, straight-to-the-point Iron Maiden, you may be disappointed. But if you're patient, Maiden actually go through some pretty interesting intros, whether it be interesting musically, like on the first moment on the album, \"Satellite 15\", where there is this really electronic, futuristic sound. There are also some moments where it seems like Maiden is just doing an intro for the sake of setting up the story that plays itself out through the lyrics. So even though it may take a few minutes for these tracks to get started, there is still a lot of vitality in the songwriting. Maiden doesn't show any age in this aspect. \n\nWhen Maiden needs to, the band uses their speed, and when they need to, they use their solo power, and they're still flash with this music, but the band is really emphasizing songwriting and progressiveness over flashy musicianship. The slower moments aren't bad either, like the track \"Coming Home\" has a really fantastic hook that will stick with you every time you listen to it. Some songs overall I'm really not enjoying and I'm sad to say it's mostly because of Bruce's vocals. I don't know if there were outside factors involved, but Bruce sounds a little bit strained on some of these tracks when he starts to reach his upper register. It could've been an off season, could've been a lack of studio time, but I think some of these songs could've done with a few extra takes. \n\nOne more problem I have with tracks like \"Mother of Mercy of \"Starblind\" is that it's almost as if Bruce isn't really singing, but instead trying to channel his inner thespian by kind of acting out the song. But I'm still happy to say that Iron Maiden is still making good music that is powerful, and that means something; they're definitely showing some signs of aging, but I still think they've got it. \n\nIf I'm going to be honest with you, I feel this album still is in no way as thrilling or as riveting as Piece Of Mind or Powerslave or Killers. Iron Maiden is still making good music, and for tha they are still relevant in the metal world. Their music isn't getting lost in the past, it's not forgotten, and that's because every so often we have something like this to talk about.\n",
        "\nIn the year 2000, Iron Maiden released what would easily be their best album. My assertion should by no means indicate to you the Maiden purist that I'm ignorant of the band's legacy preceding this album because as a matter of fact I am not. I have listened with much enthusiasm as the next metalhead to the albums from the glory days and although they contain certified classics, they are by and large inconsistent works but accepted for what they are as metal was in its formative stages. \n\n\"Piece Of Mind\" for instance is prevented from flawlessness by the unnecessary \"Quest For Fire\" and rather bland \"Die With Your Boots On\" and \"Suns And Steel\". I have plenty of issues with \"The Number Of The Beast\" and \"Somewhere In Time\" that I won't expound on because this review isn't about them. The first two records were genius except for the fact that they lack Bruce Dickinson's voice (Di'Anno sounds a tad goofy and unconvincing in comparison) and Nicko McBrain's masterful pound. Only \"Powerslave\" comes close to perfection and should by all means continue to be heralded as a masterpiece of metal for years and years to come.\n\nWith \"Brave New World\" I feel the grandiose and expansive elements of \"Powerslave:\" and \"Seventh son Of A Seventh Son\" become more cohesive and due to the fact that the players have matured in age and experience since then, the songs here have a classier edge and although the brute force of spirit is alive and well, I feel it is well guided and applied carefully. Iron Maiden exercise restraint to such great extent on \"Brave New World\" that you feel no random notes were struck. Everything is served in the right doses and they manage to deliver a thoroughly complete work. The album boasts of ballsy, quickly memorable rockers like \"The Wicker Man', \"The Mercenary\", \"and \"The Fallen Angel\" that could easily stand neck to neck to the overly touted staples such as \"Run To The Hills\", \"2 Minutes To Midnight\" and \"Can I Play With Madness\". \n\n\"The Mercenary\" in particular echoes the resounding spirit of \"The Trooper\" and though it might pale a tad in comparison it fits well in the flow of the album. It follows \"Blood Brothers\"-a great song to hear live-and precedes the lovably dramatic \"Dream Of Mirrors\" which was actually conceived before Bayley's exit but just wouldn't have worked as well with his voice on top of things.\n\nWhat makes this album such a monument is because it is absolute Maiden. All the songs are quintessentially theirs - you don't get any sense that they're veering off the rails and trying \"something new\" yielding dubious results as is the case with \"A Matter Of Life And Death\" (fondly referred to as AMOLAD) and the severely bloated \"The Final Frontier\". They are in their element here a hundred percent and sometimes listening feels like walking into an Iron Maiden Museum. \n\"The Mercenary\" pays light tribute to \"The Trooper\", the title track inspired by the Huxley tale resembles \"Fear Of The Dark\", \"The Nomad\" dares to reawaken the might of \"Rime Of The Ancient Mariner\" and \"The Thin Line Between Love And Hate\" takes the emotional power first felt on \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\" to even deeper depths. Its like all the best features of Maiden are on display but given ultra brilliance from an entirely new light source. \n\nThree guitarists are now in the fold for one as opposed to before and the riffs are more meatier this timer round. Steve Harris is as audible as usual and I've always said he plays the bass like a plant - you can hear it grow as the song progresses. The legato fuelled guitar solos are a highlight on each song. They range from distantly classical to faintly folky and never sound wasteful or random-they have character and serve the songs well.The harmony guitar interplay on \"Out Of The Silent Planet\" for instance embellishes what would have been a rather bland passage. \nNicko McBrain is the backbone - without him it wouldn't work as well as it does. Sometimes seeing only the front you forget what holds it in place. But he is content to man his fort in the back and what his trusty kit does more than anything is to give the songs presence as everything else then takes flight.\n\nThe lyrics that stood out for me were those of \"Ghost Of The Navigator\", \"Blood Brothers\" and \"The Thin Line...\" Bruce Almighty is in fine form from start to finish. I've always admired him but I always thought in the past there was a reckless edge about his voice. It is absent here and I instead find him graceful and seasoned. \nI'll have to note in passing that the album is probably the logical bridge between Iron Maiden's glorious past and dubious future. But when you reach this here bridge I suggest you make the pace of your walk leisurely. It is most worthwhile.\n",
        "\nDespite having one of the band's best-known crowd favourites, Iron Maiden's 'Fear Of The Dark' is a somewhat less successful album for the legends, at least critically speaking. My first experience with the band, the album may have more of a personal significance to me, and while proving to be one of the band's less consistent works, there is some great music here from the band. While not as good as the true classic material of the band, 'Fear Of The Dark' is an at-times wonderful collection of tracks from one of metal's most enduring acts.\n\n'Be Quick Or Be Dead' kicks off the album in a fairly classic Maiden fashion; a fast pace, galloping rhythm, and Bruce Dickinson's howl makes this track one that I would not have been surprised to see one of the earlier records. 'From Here To Eternity' also somewhat follows this formula. Truth be told though, Iron Maiden does take the rest of the album down a somewhat different lane. While it's certainly nothing alien to what Iron Maiden had already been doing, the music is perhaps a little more conservative in terms of speed, with many of these tracks veering towards Judas Priest's 'older' sound. Cutting straight to the point; this is done very well at times, but some songs fall off the wagon, and this may be why some fans of the band do not regard this album as highly. 'The Fugitive' and 'Judas Be My Guide' are two more straightforward tracks that really rock. While the intensity is toned down a bit, the riffs are in much the same style that Maiden had done before. Despite the subdued angle, there is still the care taken to the dual guitar harmonies. Weekend Warrior' is the only miss of a track here, with fairly uninspired guitars and facepalm-inducing lyrics. Here, Iron Maiden virtually declaws their music, and despite being released in '92, 'Weekend Warrior' sounds like it would have been some arena rock track from the heyday of the '80s. One bad apple aside, I don't think it hurts the rest of the songs.\n\nBruce Dickinson's voice is a point of contention for some, especially seeing as he would leave the band for the next two albums after this. Although some of the melodies are not so inspired or memorable, his voice was still in top shape, although he does not quite sound like himself here. At times, he sounds like Rob Halford- a good thing- and at others, he ad-libs away in the style of Axl Rose- a decidedly bad thing. 'Fear Of The Dark' certainly has some weaknesses to contend with, but the album's two most involving songs take it from being merely decent, to a very good album. Those two are the famed title track, and the lesser-known 'Afraid To Shoot Strangers'. The first of these evokes a maddening response from the crowd whenever its played live, and for good reason. It begins with a classic riff, then takes a breath as it gently builds into the most intense passage of the album. 'Afraid To Shoot Strangers' proceeds in much the same manner, with perhaps a more progressive direction. With these two songs alone, 'Fear Of The Dark' is more than worth a listen to a fan of the band.\n\nIron Maiden have gone through many phases, and 'Fear Of The Dark' falls on the brink of a rough transition for the band. All the same, there are many good songs, and even some gold to hear with this one. A painfully underrated album.\n",
        "\nIn all metal discussions, when it comes to the question \u2019\u2019What is Maiden\u2019s best album?\u2019\u2019, almost everyone will immediately say \u2019\u2019The Number of the Beast\u2019\u2019 or \u2019\u2019Powerslave\u2019\u2019 or \u2019\u2019Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\u2019\u2019. Maybe someone will point out the self-titled debut or \u2019\u2019Killers\u2019\u2019 as the hint of what Maiden have been at the beginning of their career. What about this album?\n\nWell, \u2019\u2019Somewhere in Time\u2019\u2019 is definitely the most neglected and underrated Maiden album. There are no words that can describe how unjustly that is, because, in my opinion (and a lot of people on this site seem to agree with me), this is the best Maiden album ever, their swan song. In fact, I firmly believe that this is one of the best and most influential albums in whole metal. Let me explain why...\n\nEvery band member was in top shape while recording this album: Bruce Dickinson and Nicko McBrain put up performances of their careers here (especially Nicko\u2019s drumming is amazing), Steve Harris is as great as ever on the bass, same to be said for Adrian Smith and Dave Murray on guitars. I must point out Smith\u2019s contribution to songwriting; he wrote even three songs out of eight, and those songs are the absolute pinnacle of his songwriting, save it for \u2019'2 Minutes to Midnight\u2019\u2019.\n\nI won\u2019t do a track-by-track review, I\u2019ll just say that \u2019\u2019Caught Somewhere in Time\u2019\u2019, \u2019\u2019Wasted Years\u2019\u2019 and \u2019\u2019Alexander the Great\u2019\u2019 are the best songs on here. \u2019\u2019Caught Somewhere in Time\u2019\u2019 is an amazing opener, 7 minutes of pure Maiden madness, it gives you a good clue of how this album sounds like. \u2019\u2019Wasted Years\u2019\u2019 is probably the best radio-friendly Maiden song ever, with amazing music, lyrics and truly unforgettable chorus and solo by Smith. \u2019\u2019Alexander the Great\u2019\u2019 is on top of Maiden epic songs, along with \u2019\u2019Hallowed Be Thy Name\u2019\u2019 and \u2019\u2019Rime of the Ancient Mariner\u2019\u2019. It describes military marches of the great Macedonian emperor. Musically, it is probably the best song Maiden have ever written, just listen how they managed to conjure up the overall atmosphere of ancient Greece. All the other songs are amazing too, but I won\u2019t tell you everything, you should experience this majestic album for yourself!\n\nComparisons to their other masterpieces such as \u2019\u2019Powerslave\u2019\u2019 or \u2019\u2019Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\u2019\u2019 are inevitable, but in this case, they are completely useless. This album is a world of its own. Never before and never again Maiden sounded this powerful, brutally heavy and progressive (yes, progressive, I\u2019ll explain that later). The production is also totally different from anything Maiden have ever done, with guitar and bass synths for the first time, downtuned (not nu metal downtuned) bass and guitars, which creates a futuristic atmosphere. This album is totally experimental for the band on that department. I\u2019ve heard complaints that this is worst production Maiden had in the '80s. Bullshit, it matches with songs perfectly and it raises this album to a higher level. Also, it is their most \u201980s sounding album, and because of that it may seem dated, but that would be deadly wrong, because it creates a feeling of nostalgia for metal\u2019s most glorious times. It really gives a lot of charm to this already stunning record.\n\nBut all of that would be irrelevant if the songs were bad. I assure you, they are not. Some of the best Maiden songs are to be found here (the forementioned trio) and some of the underrated too (Sea of Madness, Stranger in a Strange Land, Deja Vu). If you listen to every song separately, you might think \u2019\u2019Hey, the songs are nothing special, Maiden have way better songs than these\u2019\u2019. Could be, but as a whole, they are brilliant. This is a true example of an album that is way more than just a sum of its parts.\n\nI mentioned earlier that this is a very progressive album. Yes, it is progressive, but not in the Dream Theater way, but in a more sophisticated way. You can clearly see that in the intro melody of \u2019\u2019Caught Somewhere in Time\u2019\u2019, interlude of \u2019\u2019Sea of Madness\u2019\u2019, bridges and choruses of \u2019\u2019The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner\u2019\u2019 and the whole \u2019\u2019Alexander the Great\u2019\u2019. It\u2019s just amazing. What\u2019s even more interesting, some of those \u2019\u2019secret\u2019\u2019 melodies appear only after a lot of listening. You can also find this on \u2019\u2019Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\u2019\u2019. Albums like this make metal to be much more than just a genre of popular music, to be true art.\n\nThe influence that this album made on other artists is obvious. Along with \u2019\u2019Powerslave\u2019\u2019 and \u2019\u2019Seventh Son\u2019\u2019 it crucially influenced power metal. These records could be the crucial points in the band's legacy, since the whole European power metal scene is undoubtedly heavily influenced by Maiden\u2019s mid to late \u201980s albums; to name a few bands: Helloween, Gamma Ray, Iron Savior etc. \n\nI almost forgot to mention the unbelievable album cover, done by brilliant Derek Riggs. It's incredibly complex, with a lot of references to Maiden's past works (my favourite being the silhouette of their former singer Paul Di'Anno in the window shop). A special cover for a special album, indeed.\n\nOverall, this is Maiden\u2019s magnum opus in lot of ways, and therefore it\u2019s such a pity it\u2019s not given more attention nowadays. I hope that one day it will have the deserved reputation. Until then, it will remain to be the underdog in Maiden\u2019s discography. If you haven\u2019t listened to this yet, get a copy as soon as possible, give it a chance, you won\u2019t be dissapointed, I guarantee you. Up the Irons!\n",
        "\nFear of the Dark is not a terrible album and actually contains some great songs. Though unlike Iron Maiden's previous releases that are in my opinion 100% excellent with every track pulling its weight and no filler, this one seems a bit too average and had a bit of filler.\n\nLets start with the musicianship. Each member of the band plays well on this album. Bruce Dickinson's vocals are a bit more gritty on this album than most people are used to. They are comparable to his singing on the previous album, No Prayer for the Dying. The bass of course is great, for it is Steve Harris playing. Nicko McBrain's drumming is good as usual. The guitar playing of Dave Murray and Janik Gers is quite good actually, and Janik's guitar solos are one of the highlights of the album.\n\nBefore I start the track by track rundown, I want to say that a mediocre song from this band is great when compared to other songs from other bands, but this album didn't live up to usual Maiden spectacularity.\n\nThe first track, \"Be Quick or be Dead\", is a heavy, fast-paced opener that is almost a bit thrashy. It isn't the usual Maiden, but it is still a great song and shouldn't be ignored. \"From Here to Eternity\", the second track, finishes up the story of \"Charlotte the Harlot\" that began on their debut album. This one is alright and some may deem it a classic. It is enjoyable, though had more of a rock feel than it does Maiden epicness. \"Afraid to Shoot Strangers\" is absolutely great. Great music, lyrics, everything, and is a highlight of the album. It has great melodic riffs. There is a live Blaze Bayley version as well that is also pretty good, if not better. \"Fear is the Key\" is where many would say the filler starts. The beginning of the song is cool, but it changes to a cheesy rock-ish riff. The song has some good parts and isn't terrible and I don't always skip it on my iPod. The next track is a very different song compared to most in the bands repertoire. \"Childhood's End\" is, in my opinion, an excellent song, though some may disagree. The song has emotion that can really be felt during the chorus which has interesting drumming. Give it a chance. \"Wasting Love\" is met with a lot of disappointment as many deem it Iron Maiden's power ballad, and they aren't exactly wrong. But just because a song is mellow doesn't mean it is bad. It isn't glammy Poison bullshit, so give it a chance. You may like it. \n\n\"The Fugitive\" is filler because of the lyrics. The song isn't bad. Actually it's rather catchy, but the lyrics are too generic and simple for Iron Maiden and left me disappointed. \"Chains of Misery\" is just okay as the chorus and riff is a bit cheesy. You can call it filler, but it isn't terrible. \"The Apparition\" is filler. They should have just cut it from the album and the total length would have still been enough and the album would be better overall. \"Judas be my Guide\" is AWESOME and is a hugely underrated Iron Maiden song with a badass chorus and harmonizing guitar riff with plenty of emotion. It's hard not to sing along. It is classic Maiden greatness. \"Weekend Warrior\" is filler. I mean, look at the title. Does that sound like Iron Maiden? Skip it and skip some disappointment. Now we get to the title track, \"Fear of the Dark\". It is a definite Maiden anthem and I don't think the band has played a concert and not played this since it was written. I'm sure you've heard it 'cause it's pretty awesome.\n\nIf they had simply cut 2 or 3 of the filler tracks from this album and left it at 9 tracks, this album could be great overall, but the few filler tracks are just unnecessary and detract from the album's overall rating. If you are new to Iron Maiden, don't start with this album. If you already like the band and are familiar with their work, this album is still enjoyably good and you should go ahead and get it.\n",
        "\nThis album has been my favourite Iron Maiden album for a pretty long while. I have changed my mind throughout the years and I prefer \"The X-Factor\" and \"Somewhere In Time\" today, but \"Powerslave\" is without the glimpse of a doubt in my definitive top 3 albums of the band. Almost every song of this album is great but most of the songs have also some negative points.\n\n\"Aces high\" is an amazing opener, probably the heaviest, fastest and straightest that they have ever done to date. Especially Bruce Dickinson delivers an amazing job on the vocals. The only negative point of this song is that the brilliant introduction of Churchill's Speech that has been used on the concerts, hasn't found its way on the studio album.\n\n\"2 Minutes To Midnight\" is darker than the opener but it has a brilliant introduction and main riff, a very catchy chorus and an atmospheric bridge and is as brilliant as \"Aces high\". This heavy metal high quality double pack fits perfectly together even though they sound very different from each other and convince each one in their own way. The lyrics are very interesting and the music video is maybe the eeriest and weirdest stuff that the band has ever done. The only negative point of this song is that it has a little bit lost its magic because of its yearlong presence on greatest hits album, live concerts and other stuff. \n\n\"Losfer Words\" is a very tight and interesting instrumental song without any doubt and maybe the most diversified as well as the heaviest and most amazing instrumental song the band has ever done. It fits to the epic style and conception of the album and is quite underrated in my humble opinion. But the song has still somehow the touch of a filler for many fans and has some little lengths and this is its only negative point about this very good song.\n\n\"Flash Of A Blade\" is a heavily underrated song. The intro riff sounds really melodic, straight and innovative. The song itself has a very fast and intense main riff. Bruce Dickinson is in absolute top form and performs his vocals in a very stunning way by almost aggressively rapping the verses while singing the chorus with his high pitched and powerful voice. The contrast created by this phenomenon creates a very particular and special style and sounds overall new and fresh. The twin guitar parts sound amazing and this is surprisingly the very first track on the record where there is not a single negative point that I could mention.\n\n\"The Duellists\" starts with a very tight main riff and has some very melancholic and melodic vocal lines. Bruce Dickinson does an amazing job in the verses. The instrumental parts in the song only have an average quality and are a little bit too long in some parts. The most negative point of this song is without any doubt the chorus. It is epic, but way too happy and doesn't fit with the atmosphere created in the rest of the song at all. It is one of the weaker songs of the album.\n\n\"Back In The Village\" begins with a very melodic and still heavy introduction and the verses are once more very straight and great. The closing moments of the song are very straight and fast and I like this surprising effect. The hypnotic chorus is though the negative point of this song and neither very catchy nor very well developed. The instrumental parts of the songs are of an average quality and comparable to \"The Duellists\". This song is probably the weakest one on the album just behind \u201cThe Duellists\u201d.\n\nI didn't like the song \"Powerslave\" when I listened to it for the first time, but this song has really grown on me within the last few years. It all begins with a very interesting intro, has some heavy, but still mystical and innovating verses and a very epic and catchy chorus. The middle part of the title track is amazingly melodic and sounds more elaborated than some of the other instrumental parts on the album. The song gets you in a magic atmosphere and creates a very special tension. All instruments do a brilliant job here, especially the bass guitar who has been too much dominated by the guitars in some of the previous songs. Today, I must admit that there is no negative point to find within this great title song.\n\n\"Rime Of The Ancient Mariner\" is one of the greatest, if not the best song Iron Maiden has ever written. This song has everything that a metal fan needs. It is catchy and attractive the first time you listen to it, but you will still discover new passages years after your first experience with this song. The song is heavy and straight, but it also has its slower parts which create a dark and mysterious atmosphere. The guitar solos are intense and simply amazing. Bruce Dickinson does a very diversified and energetic job on the vocals. The drumming is tight and stunning. The bass guitar is as strong and particular as in the title song and even surpasses the previous opus magnum. The song has many changes in style, but all parts fit perfectly together. The song is never boring or seems to be long even though it is the longest one the band has ever written until today. Sure thing, there is no negative point about this masterpiece. I don't like to give too general comment or prejudices, but if you don't like this song, you do simply not like heavy metal and Iron Maiden. For me, this song is the opus magnum of heavy metal in the eighties.\n\nAs you can see, I would say that there is one masterpiece (\"Rime Of The Ancient Mariner\"), two extremely brilliant (\"Powerslave\" and the underrated \"Flash Of A Blade\"), two brilliant (\"Aces High\" and \"Two Minutes To Midnight\"), one very good song (\"Losfer Words\") and two average or rather good songs (\"The Duellists\" and \"Back In The Village\"). The album cover is more than brilliant and probably the best one that Derek Riggs has ever done. Even after years, you still discover something new on it. The production of Martin Birch is simply brilliant and better than some of the modern Iron Maiden records. Iron Maiden combines their style and heritage (on more traditional songs like \"2 Minutes To Midnight\" or \"Flash Of A Blade\") with some new and innovative elements (like the atmospheric parts on the title song \"Powerslave\" that can only be compared to \u201cHallowed Be Thy Name\u201d and \u201cTo Tame A Land\u201d but it definitely reaches a climax on this record). That's why, even if there are some little negative points to mention related to some of the songs, this is album in all its imperfect perfection is one of my favourite albums of all time and has been my favourite Iron Maiden record for a long while!\n",
        "\nOriginally published on http://suite101.com\n\nUnlike most bands that are just content to reunite and endlessly regurgitate their old hits for every tour, Iron Maiden has never strayed from treading on new ground ever since singer Bruce Dickinson and guitarist Adrian Smith came back into the fold back in 1999.\n\nThe Final Frontier is the fourth album that the band has released since their highly-publicized reunion and brings in a few new elements while sticking with their signature style. This is also the band's longest album to date with there being nearly 76 minutes of music to offer on this disc.\n\nFor those who haven't been paying attention to the band's recent musical shifts, it can be safely said that very little on this album has any resemblance to the band's \"classic\" 80's sound. There is no Run To The Hills, The Trooper, or even a Can I Play With Madness within this album's long duration!\n\nInstead, this album continues the dark progressive metal sound that the band undertook with 1995's The X Factor and has a lot in common with 2006's A Matter Of Life And Death with its complex structures, theatrical contrasts, and occasionally brooding themes.\n\nThere also seem to be a few flirtations with outside genres as folk-like melodies appear on The Talisman and Where The Wild Wind Blows and an old rock element pops up on El Dorado that hasn't been seen since the infamous days of Virtual XI. Throw in some nicely placed acoustic flourishes and you've got one of Maiden's more relaxed efforts to date.\n\nFortunately the band manages to work well with the changes that have been made and put on their usual great performances. Dickinson's vocals and founder Steve Harris' bass playing are what predictably stand out the most, but the triple guitar attack does still have plenty of chances to shine.\n\nOn the other hand, drummer Nicko McBrain is also fairly solid but doesn't seem to stand out as much as usual. The exception to this rule seems to occur over the course of the opening Satellite 15 but this mainly due to it being driven by some unusual drum programming more than anything else...\n\nThe songs on this album are also strong and contain the expected mix of accessible rockers and more drawn out segments. But unlike the last few albums, the choruses are more developed and largely stay away from the one-line chants that dominated songs such as The Wicker Man and Brave New World.\n\nFollowing the strangeness that is Satellite 15, things start off on an upbeat note with the likes of the laid back title track and the driving El Dorado. From there, the album's first half is excellently rounded out by the Celtic touches of Mother Of Mercy, the lighter-worthy Coming Home, and the fast paced The Alchemist (Not to be confused with Bruce Dickinson's solo song of the same name).\n\nFrom there, the album's second side goes into more epic territory with there only being one song that is less than eight minutes long. Of this lot, The Talisman may be the strongest with its sea shanty beginning and more energetic body. Isle Of Avalon and Where The Wild Wind Blows also manage to stand out thanks to the former's building verses and the latter's upbeat melodies and apocalyptic theme.\n\nAnd speaking of themes, the lyrics on this album continue the band's tradition of quality storytelling. Like Somewhere in Time and Virtual XI before it, there are some future aesthetics at hand though these are more in its image than its actual content...\n\nInstead, the main themes seem to deal with traveling and dealing with the unknown. Coming Home stands out in this regard as its lyrics deal with Dickinson's flying experience and the title track does make for a nice life reflection. Of course, we do see the band's old fixations with war and history pop up on places such as Mother Of Mercy and Isle of Avalon.\n\nAll in all, this is another great Iron Maiden album that proves the band's continuing relevance in the modern day. There are some derivative moments where the band plays things a little safe but there are just as many that manage to keep things interesting. Whatever the case, here's hoping that the band will keep their momentum going and astound us all for just a little while longer...\n\nHighlights:\nThe Final Frontier, El Dorado, Mother Of Mercy, Coming Home, and The Talisman\n",
        "\nThis two-disc set from the most respected and influential band in the history of metal compiles the \"best\" tracks from the band's post-\"Seventh Son\" material. \"From Fear to Eternity\" appears to be a companion collection to \"Somewhere Back in Time\", yet the band is covering two decades here instead of one. And admittedly, if you are a consummate Maiden fan, there is a lot of bang for your buck on this compilation.\n\nMost will agree that the band's best work can be found on their first seven albums. This is a view that I share. But to dismiss everything that came after would be sheer folly, as Iron Maiden continued to produce quality songs after the departure of Adrian Smith and the inclusion of Janick Gers on 1990's \"No Prayer for the Dying.\" Does every album they recorded since \"Seventh Son\" fire on all cylinders? No. But what Iron Maiden has accomplished with this \"Best of\" collection is a careful and thoughtful selection of the best material culled from two decades worth of releases.\n\nThe band managed to avoid some of the more embarrassing moments from the two albums following Smith's departure, although I would have preferred a more solid track selection from \"No Prayer...\". For example, \"Fates Warning\" and the title track would have been better additions than \"Tailgunner and \"Holy Smoke.\" The listener will also notice that the band picked the best track from their latest endeavor \"The Final Frontier\", which was a weak offering compared to it's 2006 predecessor. This song is \"Coming Home,\" which actually has more of a \"Chemical Wedding\"-era solo Bruce Dickinson vibe about it than the rest of the material here. This is by no means a bad thing.\n\nA close friend of mine lamented the fact that the Blaze Bayley-era material included here is all live, with Bruce on vocals. Well, this doesn't disappoint me terribly, as it adds some new live material which makes this collection more worthwhile. All of the best material from the Dickinson/Smith Reunion album (\"Brave New World\") and the two following releases are here in full force. The cost of this 2-CD set is no more than that of a single disc, and with the collection comes a deluxe booklet with cover art by Melvyn Grant (though I wish Derek Riggs was still producing art for Maiden's releases).\n\nOK. Is this an essential Iron Maiden \"extra\"? No. The only essential non-studio release for this band is \"Live After Death.\" This is basically a good pair of mix CDs for a long drive, so you don't have to haul a ton of CDs with you. All of the best stuff post 1990 (minus a few selections) is here in a neat little package. This would be an excellent starting point for newcomers to the band, and it is also something for the Iron Maiden completist. Am I glad I bought it? Absolutely.\n\nStandout Tracks: These Colours Don't Run, Afraid to Shoot Strangers, The Clansman (Live), Coming Home, The Wicker Man, Paschendale, Different World, Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg, Blood Brothers, Rainmaker, Fear of the Dark\n\nTracks that could have been omitted: Holy Smoke, El Dorado, Tailgunner, When the Wild Wind Blows\n\nTracks that should have been included: Fates Warning, No Prayer for the Dying, Childhood's End, Dream of Mirrors, Fortunes of War, Judgment of Heaven\n\nRecommended for fans of: Metal in general. If you're not a Maiden fan, you should be. Up the Irons!\n",
        "\nI'm always kind of intimidated when I approach albums (and bands) such as this one just because I feel hopelessly out of my element. Iron Maiden doesn't feature nearly enough slams to make it into my personal collection of favorites; there's a complete lack of wiggerisms in the lyrics, and gravity blasts are all but totally absent. You have to keep in mind that when it comes to metal, I really got into the scene through black and death, skipping most of the formative heavy and thrash bands most people are listening to long before Morbid Angel. This makes listening to bands like Iron Maiden sort of an odd, reverse-formative experience; in short, it's sort of alien to me, especially because I don't feel the sort of connection to bands like this one that others do. \"Altars of Madness?\" Of course, inspires youthful joy like nothing else. But \"Powerslave?\" I'm not so sure.\n\nBut I guess it's easiest for someone like me to tackle Iron Maiden's discography from this particular location; in short, where Iron Maiden basically lacks all the elements that would later define it as Iron Maiden in the minds of most people. Much in the way Black Sabbath's first, blues-oriented album is grandfathered into the metal scene due to its association with releases like \"Paranoid\" and \"Master of Reality,\" Iron Maiden's scrappy rock/punk debut gets to cut the line even when, all things considered, it's not much of a metal album. At a stretch, I'd call four of the nine cuts here substantially metal, and even then not purely- to me, there's just as much Iggy Pop to this music as there is heavy metal. This doesn't really suggest anything about the quality, of course- just keeping it real. But what's there to expect? Heavy metal didn't really exist as a fully formed ideal yet, and Iron Maiden WERE one of the bands that helped establish it, so...\n\nWe're getting away from the album itself, though. In short: it hasn't aged very well at all. It might be perceptions getting colored by Iron Maiden's more substantial and seminal career as a heavy metal band, but hearing this album full of street punk-cum-prog rock songs tends to be a jarring and pretty unsatisfying experience for the most part. I wouldn't say that it's because Iron Maiden were particularly substandard songwriters at this point; more that they were using their particular brand of songwriting on a style of music that didn't lend itself to it. The influences of '70s prog alongside that same decade's style of punk run parallel from track to track (and sometimes even within them,) making for an album that attempts to be burly and aggressive but also nuanced and evocative in that Queenish \"arena rock with a frontal lobe\" manner.\n\nWhere the album tends to fall apart, in my eyes, is in its inconsistency from track to track alongside the vociferously mediocre sound. The latter, to begin; the production is fairly excruciating. Produced in the manner of a budget rock and roll album, the guitars lack bite and the bass is almost irritatingly loud and rubbery. More than any individual failure on the part of instrumental tones, however (and there are many,) is the incredibly shallow, flat mix which tends to highlight absolutely nothing going on in the song. It lacks depth of field; every instrument sounds paper thin, with no sense of aural space. It's like the band is playing right in front of you, but with practice amps and $50 guitars. There's not much that could be done to improve on it, though, and I try not to molest albums too badly for their sound, but in this case it's a serious issue that badly affects the music.\n\nBeyond that: the inconsistency. I've always felt it took Iron Maiden a good four records before they started to actually make proper albums; all the way through \"The Number of the Beast\" the band had a tendency to arrange tracks in a haphazard, almost careless manner, making for releases that sound like a shuffled playlist more than a whole artistic piece. The debut is no exception to this rule, with some ghastly bizarre track arrangements (along with some songs that simply shouldn't have been present at all). The most obvious and glaring is \"Phantom of the Opera\" being stuck right in the middle of the album; the most ambitious and thoroughly Iron Maiden track on the release, it (and its cousin, \"Transylvania\") should have formed a suite to conclude the LP; instead, it's not given the significance it deserves, especially when followed by a set of sub-par tracks which do nothing but detract from it.\n\nThe final weak link? Paul Di'Anno. It's almost too easy to shit on him, particularly when considering how easily Bruce Dickinson snatched the crown from him (so to speak,) but the man's vocals are consistently one of the weakest and most grating parts of the album. Perpetually strained-sounding, like he was recording with a cold, Di'Anno's warbling, affectatious performance is bearable at best and sort of cringe-inducing at worst. He's functional on the more punk-influenced songs, where his throaty, somewhat hoarse shouting can come off like a cleaned-up, charming version of Lemmy at times, but he's completely lost on the more involved and metallic tracks on this LP, sounding weak and flabby when forced to compete with stronger and more bombastic guitar melodies. No wonder he's still so pissed about everything.\n\nThis release is basically an album of three, maybe four tracks: the eponymous rager, \"Phantom of the Opera/Transylvania\" (I consider them one song, in essence,) and perhaps \"Prowler.\" The others are hit and miss, and mostly miss. The slower, ballad-style tracks (\"Remember Tomorrow\" and \"Strange World\") are pretty dire, though the latter is better developed than the former, which is likely the single worst moment on the album, sounding like the sort of thing a 14 year old Iron Maiden fan today would pen as a tribute to their idols. \"Sanctuary\" and \"Running Free\" come off as filler, while \"Charlotte the Harlot\" is definitely the worst of the more aggressive tracks, with no structural coherency or real hooks for the audience. The album ends up being a life support system for what are far and away the most important tracks; the line differentiating the \"real\" songs from the filler is so stark I'd be amazed if the band themselves weren't firmly aware of it.\n\nMany of the kinks from this release would be worked out fairly well by \"Killers\" and entirely absent a couple albums later, but Iron Maiden's debut still comes across to me as the immature, shaky first steps of a band unsure about their place in the greater musical community. I'm not going to damn it as awful, but I will say that I rarely, if ever, put this one on; considering the sheer volume of records in Iron Maiden's discography which are so far superior to this one, it just doesn't seem so necessary. The best songs from this release are better represented on live albums with better mixing and Dickenson on vocals; while this is historically relevant, the content itself might be better off forgotten by many.\n",
        "\nA Real Live One fits its name perfectly. It contains material from their latest release at the time (Fear of the Dark) until Somewhere in Time. This seems odd because they didn\u2019t include songs from 5 of their previous releases which included some of their most popular songs; \u201cThe Number of the Beast\u201d, \u201cThe Trooper\u201d, \u201cRun to the Hills\u201d, \u201cKillers\u201d, \u201c2 Minutes to Midnight\u201d, among others. Also, 5 of the 11 songs are from their latest release, Fear of the Dark. I can understand that they were trying to promote their new album, but did they have to include all of those songs on a live album? You might as well have just bought the Fear of the Dark album. The other 6 songs that were included were everything they should've been. It includes some various songs from three of their previous three albums. The only song I felt that was oddly placed on this album was \u201cBring your daughter... To the slaughter.\u201d As far as I know it was never considered a single, or given any other recognition. \n\nTo be honest, the first time I listened it was another live album. After several times listening to the album I began to take a liking to the album. There are bands that are great in studio and can make some impressive releases, but once they perform live it's like 5 guys who've never played an instrument in their life are the performers. If you've listened to any of Maiden\u2019s previous live albums you would know that is not the case. The main reason I tend to stay away from live albums is the bands usually never sound as good live as they do in studio. I am extremely surprised with every single member of the band's performance. They were always in step with the other band members; there weren't competitions between Dave Murray, and Janick Gers. They did their shit and that is what makes for a non-sloppy live performance. Bruce's vocals were on pitch the entire song. His voice did not crack, no breaths in the microphone, only perfection. They could record an album with $20 and still make Bruce's vocals sound as good as they do now. Maiden wouldn't be anywhere without him. \n\nAnother problem with many live albums is the band gets lazy, and records one gig, and edit out everything but the music. A Real Live One was refreshing. They recorded this album from many different locations on their European tour. This is very good because they can be sure to pick out the best performance for each song which ensures you're getting the best that you can get. Beyond that, Iron Maiden makes this album truly feel like a live album. They have a vocal introduction for almost every song. Bruce even display's that he can speak French at the end of \"Can I play with madness\", which introduces \"Wasting Love\". The only annoying part about the album is Nicko McBrain starting the band out every song with 4 hits to a symbol on his drum set. I know that doing such is necessary in order for each band member to know when to come in. However, this could've been easily edited out. It's nothing that really hurts the album overall, just a slight disturbance. \n\nOf course, leave it to Maiden to put the crowd in frenzy. Every song, with the exception of Wasting Love, the crowd sings along at the chorus lines, so much so in some song that it almost drowns out Bruce's vocals. In songs like \"Bring your Daughter... To the Slaughter\", and \"Fear of the Dark\" the crowd doesn't just sing along with the chorus lines, but with the intro guitar riffs. Performance wise, this is my favorite live album. Not just from Iron Maiden, but from any band. However, the choice of songs was a little weak, but not terrible. They should've included songs from more than just 4 albums. Either way, it's worth the money if you come across it in a used record store.\n",
        "\nIron Maiden with Dickinson is THE Iron Maiden. This single (and any other Dickinson era Maiden album) prove this in superb ways. This single contains the mammoth of a song \"Run to the Hills\", and the lesser known, underrated, \"Total Eclipse.\"\n\n\"Run to the Hills\", with all it's glory and popularity is without a doubt one of Maiden's best songs (not counting the long songs). It starts out with the famous, instantly recognizable drum beat that gets you read for the ride. The guitars and bass come in with a simple yet catchy riff, followed by Dickinson's singing. The song then picks up pace when the verse starts, and then leads up to the awesome chorus that is a staple of the song. This process repeats once more before the solo kicks in, and then takes away to the chorus again. The song ends with an out tro accompanied by a nice scream by Bruce.\n\nNow the better part of the single (also a better song then RTTH) is \"Total Eclipse\". It has a very dark atmosphere that suits the song's lyrics well. The riffs are also pretty simple. There is no complex riffing, and there is no over the top technicality that will make you pierce your eyes out from all the confusion. The best bits of the song are when Bruce sings the following lines before the solo:\n\n\"Around the world the nations wait for some wise words from their leading light\nYou know it's not only madmen who listen to fools\n'Is this the end?' the millions cried clutching their riches as they died\nThose who survive must weather the storm\"\n\nand after it:\n\n\"Gone are the days when man looked down,\nThey've taken away his sacred crown\nTo be so free, it took so long,\nIt's not the journeys end, it's just begun\"\n\nI am also wondering why the band decided to drop this song off the album instead of some other one because it easily beats \"Gangland\" or \"Invaders\". This single gives a great taste of what \"The Number of the Beast\" is about, and also gives us a song that wasn't on the original release. Overall a good single, but if you have the full album, there is no point in listening to this, unless you want to hear \"Total Eclipse\".\n",
        "\nI love Iron Maiden\u2019s most famous album, The Number Of The Beast, but that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t have a problem with it. That being, that if three filler songs were removed, it would probably make for the best EP of all time. Therefore, my problem with this release is that both the A and B sides are two of those weak filler songs, the other one being the one which is commonly accepted as the weak point of the album, \u2018Gangland\u2019.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, both of them are respectable NWOBHM songs and contain Maiden\u2019s trademark duelling guitars, soaring vocals and lyrical splendour, but they are nothing spectacular \u2013 the simplicity of \u2018Run To The Hills\u2019 naturally appeals to the mainstream more than the vast majority of the metal genre, with its memorable chorus, the melody of which is based around basic chromatic progressions.\n\nIts verses are somewhat unusual for Maiden, in that the sole focus is Dickinson\u2019s vocals, with a few simple riffs seeming to have been thrown together as a background for a preconstructed vocal melody. It\u2019s nowhere near Maiden\u2019s usual standard that out of 4 or 5 riffs, the only one which really catches attention on its own merit is the one used twice in the middle 8 section, and even that has Dickinson mirroring its melody an octave (or two, I\u2019m unsure) higher.\n\nThe complete lack of a guitar solo is somewhat disappointing \u2013 the catchy virtuosity which is often displayed here during Maiden\u2019s songs is sorely missed. In a song where the only real attraction is the vocals and lyrics contained therein, any technicality would be desired merely to make the song anything more than pleasant background music, or indeed a shallow crowd-pleasing stadium filler.\n\n\u2018Total Eclipse\u2019 is far superior, yet still somewhat lacking; I feel the main problem is that the main verse riff is, as with the chorus of \u2018Run To The Hills\u2019, nothing more than a simple chromatic progression. That said, there is at least a solo to sweeten the deal a little, and an interesting one at that. The song overall, however, is far from memorable, perhaps the worst one taken off TNoTB in that respect, but is enjoyable to listen to.\n",
        "\nWhen it comes to talk about one of my favourite band's debut album, I feel torn between many diversified and innovating tracks and complete lack of coherence concerning the composition of the album. I feel torn in between many lacks in the song writing and composition and on the other side the legendary status of this milestone.\n\nFrom dreamy progressive rock ballads to straight punk influenced rock songs and a heavy metal epic blueprint you get pretty much everything on this record but the whole thing simply doesn't quite fit together yet. The whole album feels like an experiment, a compilation of ideas of different personalities, like some first careful steps into different directions. The fact that this album is so imperfect with its simple cover artwork, rather mediocre sound and has a considerable miss of equilibrium gives a very charming and authentic touch to the final result, though. One should also pardon the band their first mistakes as their whole epic career was continuously build upon this first album.\n\nI happen to like the part of the atmospheric progressive rock ballads most. \"Remember tomorrow\" shows for the first time the band's great technical skills, their capacity to write long and coherent songs with a magic atmosphere. \"Strange world\" is even more simple, dreamy and atmospheric and it turned out over the years that this very unusual track happened to be my favourite one on the record.\n\n\"Phantom of the opera\" is the band's first epic track and one of the first and most important epic tracks of heavy metal music that distinguished the band from many other that wrote short and sweet tracks to satisfy the masses and take advantage of a new hype. Iron Maiden were always more progressive and courageous than any other heavy metal band of the same age and delivers a stunning and diversified epic blueprint for their own and other band's future epic works. This track has a very important historical meaning even though it's far from being perfect. The vocals are too hectic and not always perfectly audible. The instrumental parts are sometimes way too long. There is not enough emotion and atmosphere in a song that refers to a legendary musical. But nevertheless, this song is something great and fits neither to the progressive rock ballads nor to the straighter and shorter punk rock influenced tracks. This song is the first one that simply sounds like Iron Maiden. This is where they get their own identity and deliver something one has never heard before in that way.\n\nTo come back to the punk influenced heavy metal tracks, they happen to be great and entertaining live tracks but the studio versions vary from very enjoyable like the straight and yet diversified bonus track \"Sanctuary\" to boring and faceless like the album's weak point which is \"Charlotte the Harlot\" as well as the unnecessary and overrated instrumental filler \"Transylvania\". \n\nIn the end this album is divided into three different parts that don't fit together and that vary from great to inspiring but imperfect to rather faceless material. The record is without a doubt technically and musically the most simple and in my opinion weakest track of the band's legendary works from the eighties. But this album should nevertheless please to any fan of heavy metal music as this first and rather shy debut album was a huge milestone for a whole genre and the begin of an incredible legacy.\n",
        "\nIt's hard to believe that it has been 11 years since the legendary pair; Bruce Dickinson and Adrian Smith returned to the band which made them superstars. Time has certainly flown by and 1999 still seems like yesterday. The line up of Iron Maiden consisting of Bruce and Adrian, plus Janick Gers, Steve Harris, Dave Murray and Nicko McBrain have now released four albums together, with their 15th and latest CD entitled 'The Final Frontier'.\n\nA scary title to say the least, as the meaning behind the title adding to the speculation with an interview of Steve Harris a few years back mentioning that the band would release 15 albums and then call it a day. I know that all Maiden fans around the world would be hoping that Harris' statement will not come to pass, as the world would be a different place if Iron Maiden were not in it.\n\nThe Irons' current sound (beginning with 1995's 'The X Factor'), can be considered to be a form of progressive metal, combined with bass guitar driven British heavy metal. Albums post 1995 includes more intricate and complex song-writing, slower songs and lengthy epic tracks; while the shorter and punchier tracks have taken a backseat. This has been Maiden's bread and butter for 15 years now and while there are still some fans who beg and plead for Maiden to return to the days of 'Piece of Mind', 'Powerslave' and 'The Number of the Beast', we all just know that this will never happen. Iron Maiden is just not that type of band anymore. Things change, trends change, interests change and if you know Steve Harris you'll know that he's only moved forward since creating this unique band all those decades ago.\n\n'The Final Frontier' is a continuation of Maiden's albums from the new millennium and the two albums that featured vocalist Blaze Bayley. Hearing a bit of 'The X Factor', 'Brave New World' and 'Dance of Death' melded into the music of the new album, I can easily say that 'The Final Frontier' has a much lighter mood and a more creative and majestic feel than the dark and broodish 'A Matter of Life and Death'; which was quite dense compared to other Maiden albums. The human air-raid siren, Mr. Bruce Dickinson, has lost a bit of power in his vocals over the years with age and performing year in and year out for almost 25 years, but he is still one of the best singers in the metal world and again does an outstanding job on the new album.\n\nWhichever way you look at it, a new album by Maiden is going to cause a big stir of excitement within the metal community. And with that excitement comes a million different opinions about songs, vocals, guitars, drumming, track length and everything else in between. Early criticism came with the very first single of the album, \"El Dorado\". Despite the fact the song is very catchy, well constructed and overall a soon-to-be classic (due to its typical Maiden sound), earning a spot in future Maiden live set-lists, fans complained about the guitar solo being weak, the song itself being boring and many other things. Next up was the video premier for \"Satellite 15...The Final Frontier\" and again more criticism. All this before the CD had even hit the music shelves, which just goes to prove that we all can be a fickle bunch and love to object the most to the biggest bands in the world. Just ask Metallica.\n\nHowever, once the dust has settled from the initial crumbs of new music that EMI and Iron Maiden Holdings throw to us and the album in full is held within our hands, the overall feel and opinion begins to change for the better. While the opening track (also the title track) is one of the better songs on the album and a typical Maiden opener, I must say that the strange and eerie atmospheric build-up to the song (which lasts for 4:35) sounds quite weird and very much skip worthy. If it lasted under two minutes, it would be fine, but over 4 I felt was just too much and I expect the vast majority of fans would also skip that part and get to the heart of the track.\n\nIron Maiden's current formula of slow instrumental intro's to their tracks are again prominent and also fulfilling on 'The Final Frontier'. One of the best slow intro's on the album is with the final track on the disc, \"When the Wild Wind Blows\". Not only is the soft and slow intro tremendously affective, the song itself is excellent and one of Maiden's best in their modern era. There are great riffs aplenty once the song gets into full gear and its catchy melody and overall quality gets my nod as the best track on the CD. Another great song on the album is \"The Talisman\". With a 2:20 min intro with lyrics spoken in an off-sounding peculiar way by Bruce, the song eventually thrusts into gear for another memorable, epic and catchy track. \"Coming Home\" is a slower track, more like a ballad, which has an emotional feel wrapped around it. Sung very well by Bruce, the track has a cracking uplifting chorus that would go down extremely well during a Maiden concert.\n\nI do feel though, that \"The Alchemist\" is (in my opinion) the weakest track of the 10. Also the fastest of the bunch, the song just lacks a bit of direction and never really takes off. I've felt for a while that Maiden now struggle to write decent short songs (under five minutes), but they certainly excel with the longer more epic sounding tracks. Take \"Wildest Dreams\" and \"Different World\" for examples of short tracks that are alright but could have been better. Rounding off the new album, \"Starblind\" is a progressive, intricate and lengthy song that will need a few listens to fully get into, while \"Isle of Avalon\" is probably the most epic track on the release. It is another very long atmospheric sounding track, with more complex and progressive sections, tempo changes and excellent guitar work by Janick, Adrian and Dave. In my opinion, \"Isle of Avalon\" would have to be the most epic track Maiden has done since \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\" or even \"Seventh Son of A Seventh Son\". I finish off with another good but underrated track \"The Man Who Would Be King\", a mid-paced track which has a great traditional Maiden melody, and lastly \"Mother of Mercy\", another impressive war-themed emotional track. However, opinions concerning the quality of this song have been split down the middle, but the track is just too catchy and majestic to simply cast aside.\n\nWhen all is said and done, I just need to say one thing: It's Iron Maiden! You know who they are and you know what they sound like. You also know what to expect and most importantly, you won't be disappointed. Those who were fearing the worst leading up to the release of this album (Lord knows why), can be rest assured that 'The Final Frontier' is another excellent album by the Irons, and around the same quality as past favourites like 'Brave New World' and 'Dance of Death'. I myself would have this album a fair amount above 'A Matter of Life and Death', simply because it has more creative and catchy tracks and less of a darker element that 'Life and Death' brought to the table. In no way is this release the best they've ever done, but in terms of their current sound and structure, 'The Final Frontier' stacks up very well indeed and is a definite addition to every Maiden fan's collection.\n\nOriginally written for www.themetalforge.com and www.metalcdratings.com\n",
        "\nWhat the hell is wrong with this band? They still have a bit of musical credibility and have so much money that they could probably wipe their arses with \u00a350 notes if they wanted to. \nBut I suppose, toilet paper does run out. So what is the solution to that? \nRelease yet another Iron Maiden Best of the best of the best of the best of.\n\nI'll start off by stating that I'm not a Maiden-n00b, nor am I a Maiden hater. I do love this band. \nUnder Overkill, they are my 2nd favourite band, but for about the last 10 years or so, they seem to be content with ripping the fans off. \n\nI mean, there isn't anything in this release that we haven't heard a million times before. \nFear Of The Dark alone has been released on nearly every live album and compilation since the song's inception, as have many more. \n\nNow, it's not that the songs are crap. Far from it. The songs are awesome, It's just that we've heard the same ones over and over and over again. \nThere are much better songs on the 90's+ albums that didn't make the cut. \n\nThe main thing that pisses me off with this band, is that they just keep releasing the same old shit, year in year out and it's getting a bit monotonous to say the least. \n\nBut again, Maiden like to spoon feed the n00bs and keep us lifelong fans buying their material with the only thing that makes this release worthwhile; the cover art. \nBut even this time, the cover art alone cannot save this travesty. \nIt's good, don't get me wrong, but it ain't no Best Of The Beast or Live After Death is it? No, it fuckin' well isn't!\n\nSo in conclusion, don't buy this album. Just relish in the fact that Maiden weren't always so money hungry and were once paving the way for metal. \nI just hope they keep releasing quality studio albums and stop releasing compilation and live albums because lets face it, we've bought the same Best of about 15 times now...\n",
        "\n\"Virtual XI\" is a truly unique album in the discography of Iron Maiden. It's an album with a very special mood and atmosphere that you can entirely adore for some special occasions. I would describe this mood as slow, progressive and really hypnotizing with many melancholic melodies, repetitive vocal lines and long instrumental parts. The production is as simplistic as the music and the lyrics and I think that the band or at least the leading parts of it were exactly looking for this kind of mood even if some people might call it a poor lack of creativity which I honestly can't entirely deny. The band wanted to sound different and unique on this album and from that point of view the album could be described as a success. The record fits most as background music on a grey autumn or winter morning and during those occasions this album opens before me like the pages of a book and I truly enjoy it. The album is not a heavy metal record but rather an experimental and sometimes spontaneous progressive jam surrounding the topic of melancholy. This all sounds very positive but I can't deny that there are many flaws on this record that rate the final judgement down.\n\nFirst of all, some songs simply go too far in their monotonous attempts and the most quoted example is surely the chorus of \"The angel and the gambler\" which would be a great effort if the band would have chosen to put the much shorter and still atmospheric single version on the record. \"The educated fool\" has the same dumb problem and even the emotional and conceptual masterpiece \"The clansman\" is spared from this. I prefer the shorter and still unique and melancholic tracks such as the underrated \"When two worlds collide\" or the hypnotizing ballad \"Como estais amigos\" which presents maybe the best vocal effort done by Blaze Bayley when he was in Iron Maiden. The second thing that really harms the album is the rather poor lyrics. A part of the inspired and more traditional epic track \"The clansman\" and Bayley's emotional farewell track which is the brilliant and underrated ballad \"Como estais amigos\", the topics are rather one dimensional and remain superficial which is the exact opposite of what the band has done with Bayley on the previous record which was very intense and profound. This fact underlines my idea that the band simply wanted to try out something new. The third negative point is the lack of inspired and emotional instrumental passages. The guitar work is somewhere between mediocre and good but the bass guitar sounds lame as never before and the drumming is lacking of power. One feels that Nicko McBrain wasn't that much into the new musical direction of the album and the continuous problems with Blaze Bayley and the lack of commercial success and popularity attached to this.\n\nThis album can only please to very patient and open minded fans that have no problems with slow, monotone and hypnotizing progressive music. Even if the band tried out something new in a surprisingly radical way, the previous two records had already a couple of signs that showed us the way in the direction that the band would take and anybody that liked the slow and dreamy passages of \"Fear of the dark\" or \"The X-Factor\" might appreciate this album and know what I mean. For the majority and those who liked the legendary works of the eighties, this release is a deception as it goes far away from the band's roots and no one would have ever thought that this band would sound like that one day. A part of the opener \"Futureal\" which is a good and straight song in the key of \u201cBe quick or be dead\u201d but which really doesn't fit at all on this record where the other songs are very coherent and homogeneous, the other seven songs of this record are dreamy, hypnotizing and cumbersome. \n\nEven though I happen to be musically very open minded and even though I like the experimental flow of this record, I prefer the heavier and darker side of the band and must admit that I don't listen quite often to this disturbing and yet beautiful record. But when I'm listening to it, I do it with much more intensity than I listen to most of the other records of the band and I want to underline this unique status of the album. It really takes some time and a lot of patience before the record grows on you and maybe several years or decades. But if you happen to have listened to this record when it was initially released and if you have put it in some dusty corner of your collection after a few disappointing tries, I really suggest you to pull this album out of the shadows and appreciate it with a new distance and from a more objective point of view and you might finally discover at least an interesting gem. But I wouldn't be surprised if this procedure would still not work and you need another five or ten years to understand and appreciate this simplistic and yet complicated flawed masterpiece.\n",
        "\nHeads up and listen, I am about to commit blasphemy of the tallest order concerning one of our sub cultures most beloved and at times \u2018untouchable\u2019 institutions. Sure there was the Blaze era, which is easy to dog on, and we can forgive them for occasionally letting Dave Murray write a song, but can we really forgive Maiden for continuing to dine out on their 80s reputation and past prolific catalogue?\n\nThe Final Frontier is the 4th album since the almighty return of the big Dicko, but lets all be honest here, the hard rock tinged \u2018No Prayer for the Dying\u2019 and the barely passable \u2018Fear of the Dark\u2019 were hardly world beaters prior to his departure. So what has the return of the Bruce (and Adrian Smith no less) given us since the all time low of Virtual XI? Consistency \u2013 yes, More excuses to tour \u2013 bloody oath, new classics to play along side Number of the Beast and even Can I Play with Madness \u2013 No.\n\nNow I\u2019m a Maiden fan so lets not chuck the hater tag around, I even rate the X Factor above some of the classic line ups works (damn right I said it), so this review isn\u2019t going to be bias either way. 1. I\u2019m not going to sugar coat the facts and 2. I\u2019m not going to bag them for the sake of kicking an old dog when it\u2019s down. I will however point out that there can and should be a divide between whether you liked Maiden and whether you continue to like Maiden as they have evolved into a more indulgent and at times pretentious beast.\n\nFor better or worse The Final Frontier continues in the vein of A Matter of Life and Death in regards to longer compositions and more progressive laced elements. We have but one song under the 5 minute mark (The Alchemist) and that ironically is the closest they get to recapturing old glories. Now Maiden have written some awesome epics in the past and when they decide to go long they\u2019ve done it well but the last 3 outings have pushed the limits of patience and tolerance and there\u2019s something to be said about capturing the moment in under 7 minutes or less (The album clocks in at a whopping 76mins, 5 mins more than AMOLAD and 10 mins more than Brave New World).\n\nAs stated when they do get an epic right it\u2019s a magical thing and there are some worthy cuts to add to their canon here. The Talisman is classic fare with a slow folky acoustic build up into another maritime adventure and Isle of Avalon has great eerie feel and use of repetition to create its atmosphere. Opener and title track Final Frontier also has a good sing a long vibe however could have done without the monotonous drumming lead in. Then there\u2019s the let downs, El Dorado could have ruled but doesn\u2019t and Starblind feels like a left over from Dicko's solo stuff, and while The Alchemist seriously rumbles like times of old, the chorus delivery and lack of a killer blow makes it a good track rather than a great one.\n\nOverall as an album it\u2019s a little daunting and over blown, it is however a grower if you\u2019ve got the time to immerse yourself in it. My gripe is that Maiden are essentially a live beast and I can\u2019t see how any of this stuff will sit in nicely along side their older classic (better) stuff. They recently toured AMOLOD entirely before doing a world tour centred solely around their classic 80s era, I can tell you right now which one I saw and which one the majority of us would have attended if we had to choose.\n\nSo in closing The Final Frontier is solid and definitely has its moments, I rank it below only Brave New World as their best album since Bruce\u2019s return. It isn\u2019t however a return to their old sound or a classic album which will be remembered in 10 years time. So in my eyes the record stands at 5 albums since 1998, with one stinker, one great album and 3 solid releases over 12 years and still nothing that can touch their first 5 releases with Dicko on board.\n\nThis is the new Maiden, and while I appreciate it I do pine for a return to at least the approach which made them great. Hopefully 16th time around is the charm.\n",
        "\nWhatever happened to the Iron Maiden of old? I'm a long time Maiden fan, with years and years of enjoying and enduring the band's accomplishments/flaws. However, this was the pinnacle breaking point that I (agonizingly) do not follow Maiden as loyally as I had back then. I first got this single online when the Maiden website offered a free itunes track as a prequel to the new album.\n\nThe song bursts with something like a \"Grand finale,\" something that most bands play at the end of a live show or song. That may have been acceptable, but at this specific circumstance, it seemed rather cheesy and cliche. When Harris plays that familiar galloping rhythm, the one we ALWAYS seem to hear nowadays, the flavor gets bland easily. Taking a glance at the lyrics did not help, since everyone has been babbling about \"It's a guitar and lyrics album!\" If it is a lyrics album, it is really mediocre to say, then. The lyrics have lost their poignancy and feeling, sounding like a cheesy fifth grader trying to write about viking metal. Bruce's vocals added further insult to injury, since \"Going to tell you a story\" immediately made me cringe with embarrassment. Why embarrassment? Because his voice, along with the terrible words of the song, just made me feel ASHAMED to be a Maiden fan! It made a recipe for a musical flop! The solo failed to impress me, and the rest of the song made me cry with shame.\n\nI am deeply disappointed with Maiden today. I used to review Maiden albums with such happiness and enthusiasm, but this just destroyed my hope. Many people give the new album stupid, juvenile scores like \"100%, best album EVER!\" just because it is Maiden. I love Maiden, hell yeah, perhaps more than you ever would, but when you review, you have to understand that you must get into the inner core and understand and contemplate the faults. Maiden had lost its traditional touch and delved too deep (unfortunately) in prog territory.\n",
        "\nWe've seen a few \"Best Of...\", \"Greatest Hits\", \"Somewhere In Time\". Essential\" compilation Maiden albums throughout the years. Most, if not all, are terrible to ill advised. For an excellent band such as Iron Maiden it's simply not fair to you to just capture everything in their illustrious career on one fucking CD or even two for that matter. Especially anything from 1980 to 1988. Anything from those specific years need to be purchased one CD at a time. One of the times I would highly advised someone getting into Maiden and trying to understand why they are legends should get 'Iron Maiden' all the way up to 'Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son'.\n\nNow this Best Of... consists of material from 1990 to 2010. Otherwise known as the forgettable decade and the decade of redemption. Basically for anyone who isn't really a Maiden diehard this is a wise and good purchase, because there have been some less than stellar stuff from those 20 years to say the least. This compilation hand picks the good shit from those years. It saves you the money of having to buy 'No Prayer For The Dying', 'X Factor' and 'Virtual XI'. While the Bruce Dickinson comeback albums are all quite good to great it still does a commendable job of selecting the memorable tunes from those releases. One of the few Maiden best of that is enjoyable from start to finish. Great to play in the house, at work or on long drives in your car when you don't feel like clicking through your iPod or changing CDs often. I won't get into the songs because we pretty much know them anyway. No new tracks here. Sadly, the Blaze Bayley songs are sung live with Bruce Dickinson only enhancing the fact that perhaps his time with the band was a mistake. I disagree, I think it's the band's fault for those bad albums not Blaze's. But whatever. This is a good 2 CD best of and I recommend it. Besides, the cover art is fucking killer, as usual.\n",
        "\nOh, they are back (the review originally written in 1998 after the album was released, only slight changes made)! The 11th (count them!) studio album from one of the biggest heavy metal bands around the universe... Iron Maiden. At least they used to be one of the biggest, but Bruce Dickinson's departure was quite a shock, to both the band and the fans. Blaze Bayley was chosen to fill the place of the Airraid Siren, probably THE best heavy metal singer, ever.\n\n'Virtual XI' is a second album with Blaze handling the vocal duties. I think he has gotten into the band now. Still, he can't get nowhere near Bruce's heights and skill. Blaze's voice is quite low and also kind of dry. The voice works best, when the man puts enough power to it, but sadly it doesn't happen too frequently here. Some lines sound just powerless and even a bit soulless, some sound like he just can't quite hit the right notes. Well, Blaze still has an individual style which is always a good thing, innit? I think so, and that's where Blaze's true strength lies. This is the fact, and can be heard on man's own albums.\n\n'Virtual XI' includes eight songs. 'Futureal' kicks the album on its way in a good way. One of the fastest songs from the band and only three minutes long. 'The Angel and the Gambler' is 10 minutes of waiting. Nothing much happens as this rock song drifts on and on, but it still manages to catch a listener anyways. It's not droning, but still the band went on simplistic gear. The song is just too long for its own good, and they should've cut at least five minutes off. There is also a 6-minute single edit of the song, as well as a 4 minutes long video edit, which is the best version in my opinion.\n\nAfter 'The Angel...' song, the music gets more rolling again. 'Lightning Strikes Twice' is a good Maiden tune with awesome chorus. Blaze hits his highest here. 'The Clansman', an epic tale in the vein of 'Braveheart' (Mel Gibson's Scottish hero -flick hated by Scots). An absolute classic, best song on this record!!! 'When Two Worlds Collide' is another good song with galloping trademark Maiden-rhythm, but it builds up quite slowly. 'The Educated Fool' also starts quite calmly, but gets faster (and better) and it has a great chorus. Maybe a tad too long song... 'Don't Look to the Eyes of the Stranger' definitely is too long and quite a boring song with some dull song writing as the song goes to double speed towards the end. 'Como Estais Amigos' is a story about Falkland war. It is balladish at the beginning, but gets rockier. A good song, definitely, and Blaze's softer vocals work very well indeed.\n\nThere are too many calm and slow parts on this album, and they are lacking power. The playing is a bit tame, especially from Nicko McBrain. He's a great drummer and could do it thousand times better. The band doesn't get it rocking too many times. Maybe it's the production: Too thin and not heavy at all. 'The Clansman' is the only song that the band really hits it big time. The music is getting into direction that began on 'Fear of the Dark' (1992). Sometimes it feels too lazy... Iron Maiden can do it a lot better, so maybe next time.\n\nEvery album's (or singles, or whatever a release is in the question) artwork have always played a big part of the band's image. This time it's quite bad, I'm afraid. The cover art theme isn't very good, but otherwise it's a nice piece of work. 3D-cover is cool (if you found that limited CD version)! The booklet includes possible pictures from forthcoming 'Ed Hunter' computer game. Quite lame futuristic CGI graphics. 'Virtual XI' seems to be a football team with Maiden guys and real footballers like Overmars, Vierra and Gascoigne.\n\nIron Maiden seem to have many things going on. It feels like some of the music wasn't composed with full consideration. Exactly the same problem that plagued the previous album 'X-Factor' (1995). Gladly these two albums get better with time, at least I appreciate both a lot. But really, if you love Maiden, you still gotta love this. That's the truth. But this is just my least favourite Maiden album. If you want to check Iron Maiden out, start with 1980s albums. If you ask me, I say they've never made it wrong... So, please, take that into consideration.\n",
        "\n\"No prayer for the dying\" is considered as one of the weakest albums of Iron Maiden and I must agree that it is in my bottom top three as I exceptionally agree with the majority. There are multiple reasons why fans criticized this album. For the first time the band didn't develop further and created something new but focussed on their initial sound of the early years. There is no brilliant epic track on the record that crowned the previous albums. There is no clear guiding line within the record. The vocals are darker, harsher and less technical then before. There are no truly outstanding and emotional instrumental passages on the record. Many associate this with the departure of Adrian Smith that got replaced by the technically less impressive Janick Gers. The sound and production of the recording aren't as majestic and authentic as on the last and very atmospheric albums. \n\nBut the main reasons why one tends to dislike this record is that it has the style of a compilation album where old ideas are rehashed. \"Tailgunner\" sounds like a weaker version of \"Aces high\". \"Holy smoke\" and \"Hooks in you\" could be b-sides from the first solo album of Bruce Dickinson just like the very successful but overrated \"Bring your daughter... to the slaughter\" with a little touch of the first two Iron Maiden records when Paul Di'Anno was still in it.. \"No prayer for the dying\", \"Public enema number one\", \"Run silent run deep\" and \"Mother Russia\" copy the style of the two previous records. My favourite tracks from those ones are the really beautifully sung and underrated title track \"No prayer for the dying\" that easily happens to be the best song on this album and that would have merited a place on the last two records as well as the atmospheric \"Run silent run deep\" that would be my hidden gem on this record and a song worth to get discovered over and over again by anyone that hasn't listened to this record for a while.\n\n\"Fates warning\" and \"The assassin\" try to be a little bit darker and experimental and are the only tracks that present us something new. The first one is quite atmospheric and indicates the way that the band would take on the next two records and after a while I happened to like this song. The only thing that misses is a truly catchy chorus or addicting instrumental part. The second song has another interesting and atmospheric introduction and remind of the sound of the great \"Powerslave\" album. The verses are interesting, mysterious and atmospheric but the chorus turns out to be amongst the most horrible ones the band has ever written. The vocals are really annoying and weird and the whole thing is repeated too much. The guitar solo is just shitty shredding. But at least the band tries out something new.\n\nThis record has the style of a compilation album and that's why it is difficult to get compared to the seven previous albums that all had a certain style and clear direction. The band seems to have wanted to satisfy all their fans by getting inspired by anything they have done before including songs in the key of the earliest works with Bruce Dickinson on the vocals this time. The problem is that the band wanted to spread in too many directions and styles and focussed on quantity instead of the quality and most people simply get lost on this record. Another problem is that the songs that try to connect to the previous styles simply aren't as hooky, fresh and passionate. There are three great songs on the record with \"No prayer for the dying\", \"Fates warning\" and \"Run silent run deep\" and I also happen to like rock party tracks like the funny and energizing \"Holy smoke\" but half of the album is rather weak and simply doesn't touch me. \n\nI still think this is album is more than just ordinary, it's actually rather good but by considering the high quality of the band's records a pretty good album isn't just great enough. I would like to add that the recent \"The final frontier\" is even weaker than this record and gets completely lost while this album is at least short and sweat and leaded to a new style that the band developed further and better on the upcoming two records. That's why this record was still an important step in the band's career.\n",
        "\nI tend to talk a lot of shit on the Blaze Bayley era of Iron Maiden. I'm just not a fan of him fronting the band. However, I don't think I can deny that the first album with him, \u201cX-Factor,\u201d probably deserves more credit than I give it. I honestly disliked the album the first few times I tried it, and I was very open about it. However, in recent years it's grown on me a lot more, and while many of my original complaints are still intact, I think I rate this album much higher now than I would have even a year ago. And yet, I've never been as open about how I've come around to it as about my original dislike for it. So in a way this is something of me de-closeting my enjoyment for \u201cThe X Factor.\u201d\n\nJust about every Maiden album has that one song considered the epic, and while it's usually the closer, in this case it kicks the album off. \u201cSign of the Cross\u201d starts with a dark sort of Gregorian type chant, before going into a dark synth driven intro with melodic guitars and bass, which then goes into a somewhat explosive mid-paced song after a few minutes. Blaze\u2019s voice is deep and powerful, a contrast to Bruce's voice soaring over every other instrument, Blaze\u2019s vocals aren't soaring much of anywhere. However, the rest of the band has adapted to this change, adopting a darker overall feel for this album, but still staying undeniably Maiden. \u201cSign of the Cross\u201d might not only be the best song Maiden recorded with Blaze, but is among the top 3 songs they've written in all of the 90s, and might be in their top 10 of all time. It's just as good when Bruce sings it on Rock in Rio, but this song is amazing, Bruce or Blaze.\n\nOther songs of excellence here are Man on the Edge, with some high speeds, sounding not entirely like some of their earlier works. Blood on the World's hands kicks off with a somewhat interesting bass intro, going into a somewhat aggressive but very Maiden sounding song about corruption and the state of the world and whatnot. Obviously, the lyrics here have also taken a darker tone, not that Maiden have always written the happiest of lyrics.\n\n\u201cLord of the Flies\u201d has a strange kind of intro that kicks off slowly with an odd bass riff and distorted guitar thing going on, and I think those first 45 seconds or so was what always threw me off, but once you get passed the into, the rest of the song is actually quite good. \u201cLook for the Truth\u201d starts off with another quiet intro, going into a song with an almost dance rhythm. It actually almost has traces of Iron Maiden's later song Dance of Death (keeping in mind that's a pretty loose comparison). \n\n\u201cFortunes of War\u201d starts off with a quiet guitar/bass riff, Blaze singing quietly, then becomes a powerful bass/drum part, becomes a somewhat grinding riff, then starts and stops back and forth, with a sort of solo-like riff between. There's a part where he ends up singing the chorus (\u201cFortunes of war, fortunes of war, fortunes of war, no pain anymore\u201d) slow, then faster, then slower. As a whole, while not entirely bad the song just seems to not really go anywhere; however the individual parts are somewhat interesting. In case you might not have noticed quiet intros going into heavier songs is something of a theme here. It happens on almost every song. And when listening through it becomes somewhat tiresome. I know Maiden would continue to do this when Bruce returned, but not to this extent and not the point where you can say \u201cAnd the song gets heavier\u2026 NOW!\u201d It gets a little tiresome. By the time \u201cThe Edge of Darkness\u201d comes around, the whole slow and quiet intro into a heavier song thing has been done enough for this song to be unnecessary. If it were to play at random on or something I\u2019m sure it would be interesting, but by this point most of the album has followed this formula, and often better. \u201c2 A.M.\u201d features that same formula with some ridiculous lyrics about coming home from work late and being bored with TV or something. With beer. \u201cThe Aftermath\u201d is a similar piece of filler that the album could probably do without; however a very cool speedy ending saves it from being completely useless. Decent, cool ending, but not incredibly interesting otherwise.\n\n\u201cThe Unbeliever\u201d is a strange one. The verse riff is somewhat start and stop-ish and awkward, and the pre-chorus is bland and not worth noting, but the chorus is very good. Some of the instrumentals work for me and others don\u2019t. It\u2019s a matter of personal taste I guess. \n\nAll in all, if you\u2019re the kind of person who can\u2019t get past Iron Maiden without Bruce, you\u2019ll never get it. If you can appreciate a darker Iron Maiden without Bruce, give it a shot. A lot of the songs follow a mellow to heavier formula that can get tiresome, but there\u2019s some good stuff for those who give the album a fair chance. I still feel this album is on the lower spectrum of Maiden\u2019s work, but the fact that I enjoy half of it is a lot more than I could say about it a year ago. Maybe I\u2019ll never be able to fully enjoy this album, but hell, the parts I do enjoy are enough for me to insist every Maiden fan who turned this album off too soon to go back and give it a fair shot.\n",
        "\nThere is a time when a band goes from either good to bad, or bad to good. Maiden on the other hand went from good to better. The Number of the Beast marked quite a few changes in the band with the most noticeable being the addition of Bruce Dickinson, who replaced Paul Di'Anno. Now I am not here to debate who the better singer is or who should have stayed in the band but all I know is that for the most part Maiden got really famous because of Bruce. I know that this is Mr. Harris' band but if it wasn't for Bruce, Maiden would not be what they are today.\n\nAnother change is the songwriting style that Steve Harris has adopted. The first 2 albums are very street-wise oriented with songs about violence, partying, and being a rebel. This was a great approach since Di'anno's vocal style fitted the themes amazingly. With this release Harris has dropped the street-wise style in favor of historical, war, life, and, religious themes. The track \"Gangland\" tells about life in a gang where murder, drugs, and crime are always present. This is my least favorite track from the album and possibly the worst. Another track entitled \"22 Acacia Avenue\" tells the story of a harlot named Charlotte and how she comes to the realization that someday she will age and her East End services will end. \"Invaders\" is a song about the brutal invasions of our good friends from the Nordics, the vikings. This is a very good track that for some reason gets panned by a lot of people. I would love to see this song played live. \n\nThe occult is ever present on the album (duh!). from the epic artwork and name, to the songs that tell tales of the devil himself. \"Children of the Damned\" and the (in)famous masterpiece \"The Number of the Beast\" are proof on why Maiden is hailed as one of the best bands in metal history. Both are classics that should be on everyone's playlists. The latter song is a heavy metal anthem whose spoken intro should be remembered by every metal head. Who hasn't written 666 on the blackboard when they were in school? Who hasn't raised their fists up in the air and said hell yeah when they heard this? It's a true heavy metal classic that changed metal forever, no fucking doubt. Another historical track and probably Maiden's most famous song is \"Run to the Hills\". It tells the story of colonists from Europe coming into the new world slaughtering and taking advantage of the natives. This song is ever present on Maiden's set lists and is a true anthem. \"The Prisoner\" is an another great and famous track about the show of the same name that has good songwriting and sound. The chorus however can get stale after awhile. \n\nThis album contains a song that is regarded as one of the best heavy metal tracks ever composed, in fact it was ranked as the best heavy metal song ever by Digital Dream Door. \"Hallowed be they Name\" is a musical masterpiece that is a staple at every Iron Maiden concert. It opens up with a slow intro that picks up speed after a vocal passage. The song is about a man who is going to the gallows and before his execution he questions his beliefs and thinks about the afterlife. The lyrics are very philosophical and chilling in a way that it makes you think and feel for the man described in a song. After the verses there is a long instrumental passage followed by amazing solos from both Adrian Smith and Dave Murray. The song ends with Bruce singing the phrase Hallowed Be Thy Name, signaling the ultimate fate of the man sent to the gallows. An amazing song that will blast into your ears many times. \n\nTo sum this entire review up I would like to say that this album is truly a classic. No matter what people say this album will be recognized for revolutionizing metal and putting Maiden into a world wide spotlight. While this album does have some faults such as silly lyrics, and the song \"Gangland\", it made a huge contribution to metal that will never be forgotten. I will conclude this with a few simple words...\"I know where I'm going, out!\"\n",
        "\nPointlessness is a common eventuality in the realm of best of compilations, and unfortunately Iron Maiden has seen their fair share of exploits in this regard. Topping the list is this unfortunate little puppy affectionately known as \u201cEdward The Great\u201d, a title that is about as deceptive as the disclosures of a government with regards to overseas black ops. The analogy towards government and politics could be drawn further into the world of democratic campaigns in the song selection department, as the platitudes are plentiful and the surprises are scarce. Part of it might be my long tenure as a fan of this band, but even for a newcomer to the band, this is unacceptable.\n\nThe typical ordering of songs by chronological release of their respective albums is not a bad one; in fact most of the better compilations tend to take this route. But unfortunately the pacing found from song to song within this format isn\u2019t quite so well realized. The selection of Blaze era songs and \u201cThe Wicker Man\u201d being lumped together in the listing is somewhat reminiscent to the flawed pacing of Manowar\u2019s \u201cWarriors Of The World\u201d album, cramming a large amount of fast paced metal at the tail end of what is a fairly slow and safe collection of songs. Of course, it is important to note that said Manowar album offered up a full dose of solid new material, while this is a rehash of songs that anyone interested in the band will have heard and will probably own the respective albums where they can be found.\n\nIt is easy to pick on a compilation for what it doesn\u2019t include, particularly with this band, as any amount of tree pruning will inevitably cut away something great. But what is included in this release makes it pretty easy to pick on. With the exceptions of \u201cInfinite Dreams\u201d and the live rendering of \u201cFear Of The Dark\u201d, this is all radio-friendly material that doesn\u2019t really do justice to the band\u2019s abilities. The simple inclusion of something less known like \u201cTo Tame A Land\u201d or \u201cSeventh Son Of A Seventh Son\u201d would have done this a world of good. And heaven forbid there be at least one representative from the band\u2019s influential material with Paul Di\u2019Anno should find its way on here.\n\nNo, this should not be titled \u201cEdward The Great\u201d; this should be called something more along the lines of \u201cIron Maiden For Dummies\u201d, \u201cThe Idiot\u2019s Guide To Iron Maiden\u201d, or for a less offensive term, \u201cThe Official Iron Maiden Cliffs Notes\u201d. There is very little enrichment here, even for the metal newcomer who prefers to keep things safe. Only the washed up 80s glam rock turned corporate suit would bother with this sort of release in order to complement his greatest hits collections of Winger and Cinderella, and it was likely that sort of mindset that was influencing Steve Harris when he decided to put this together.\n",
        "\nThere comes a point and time where if one follows a veteran band long enough, redundant and even pointless non-studio album releases will start to crop up like crazy. The colloquial term for these albums is that of a \u201ccash grab\u201d, but often times this label won\u2019t do justice to the situation of one of these releases. \u201cVisions Of The Beast\u201d is not quite a cash grab to the younger Iron Maiden fan who is not in possession of the sizable collection of VHS tapes from the band\u2019s 80s and early 90s days, but for those who have most of these releases (despite the lower video quality) and who are not particularly fond of the material released after \u201cFear Of The Dark\u201d, the appeal here is fairly limited.\n\nInsofar as the contents of this rather posh package of CGI imagery and cardboard casing, there\u2019s plenty of music videos that don\u2019t get any love on MTV or VH1 (though neither channel has been interested in much apart from reality TV shows of late). From the extremely low budget and very tongue-in-cheek rendering of \u201cWomen In Uniform\u201d with a very primitive version of Eddie, all the way to the brief reenactment of \u201cThe Wicker Man\u201d with the spectacle of a giant burning totem, the band shows all newcomers their unique ability to be both humorous and serious without missing a beat. The videos tend to vary in quality depending on the era of the band, although a fairly good collection of camera angles and dark imagery make \u201cVirus\u201d and \u201cMan On The Edge\u201d decent in spite of being little more than band shots.\n\nThe principle problem with this collection is that, well, it\u2019s a collection. Apart from a fairly impressive menu screen with loads of graphics that conform pretty closely to the \u201cEd Hunter\u201d imagery that would immediately precede the Bruce and Adrian reunion, there\u2019s not much here apart from a collection of videos. There\u2019s no commentaries on any of the videos, and apart from the \u201cCamp Chaos\u201d variations on a few classics, which are a merging of older band footage with newly crafted 2-D animation of about the same quality as the 2nd Heavy Metal movie, little else apart from a few newer videos to tag onto the already released ones that have since appeared on multiple VHS releases. There\u2019s a good deal to like about this, but there definitely could have been a lot more.\n\nThis can be seen as an essential purchase of a younger fan who doesn\u2019t want to blow money on an obsolete music video collection from the 80s in a dated visual medium, but those who already know the band and have all the essential releases are probably not going to be terribly impressed by this. Why blow $20 on a DVD for a few classic songs with a slightly tweaked version of their original videos and a really bad CGI video of the worst song on the band\u2019s worst album in \u201cThe Angel And The Gambler\u201d? But hey, at least it\u2019s not as pointless as \u201cEdward The Great\u201d, if that counts for anything.\n",
        "\nOn their singles, Iron Maiden have shown that they are capable of doing a lot of different genres, and often pays homage to their heroes through these little releases. Well, they're certaintly capable, but do these classic tracks sound that good with the Maiden twist?\n\nFirst of all, let's get through the main track, 'Bring Your Daughter... To the Slaughter'. It might be one of their best known songs of the nineties, and showed the banded moving towards a completely different sound than most predicted after the brilliant 'Seventh Son...' album. Bruce Dickinson obviously brought some of the sound from his solo career, and this song especially has a more rock oriented groove to it, while still managing to incorporate their trademarked, melodic heavy metal. It's hard not to compare any of their albums to the pinnacle of their career (which was undisputably during the 80's), and taking that in to concideration, the new sound was a terrible disappointment. They definitely lost some of the soul and the unmistakable sound, using a lot of generic riffs and rhythms. Still, the intermission near the end makes up for the rest, and should melt any hardcore fan's icy frontier. \n\nThe covertracks, 'I'm a Mover' by Free and 'Communication Breakdown' by Led Zeppelin, are both historical rock'n'roll classical, and probably among those that you just don't mess with. Even though Dickinson is considered one of the best and strongest voices in heavy metal, he just doesn't cut it when it comes to this kind of groovy rock. 'I'm a Mover' lacks all the things that made it a hit when performed in its original form; Paul Rodgers' beautiful and soulful voice, and the thick, raw and fuzzy sound of the riffs and solos. A complete failure on Maiden's part, in other words, and the Zeppelin cover isn't much better. They didn't dare to stray far from the original recipe her either, and it just sounds like a poor mockery of what Plant & Co. achieved with it. Dickinson takes off with the usual vocal jam we're familiar with in their live performances, but this time it just sounds awful.\n\nTo sum up, the main track is pretty decent, with catchy riffs and the aformentioned amazing intermission, but the rest, sadly, is complete shit. It just goes to show that Iron Maiden is, and should always stay a heavy metal band. That's what they know, and that's what they do better than anyone else.\n",
        "\n(This is a review of the european single)\n\nThe X Factor was the album that introduced me to this magnificent band, and naturally, by first hearing Blaze Bayley as the lead singer, it gave me a whole different perspective of their music compared to the hardcore fans that'd stayed on since the beginning. It's no secret that people pretty much despised Bayley for \"stealing\" Dickinson's place in the spotlight, and at the time, nobody really gave him a chance to prove himself. Naturally, the new frontman was blamed for the album's low chart positions, but was it well deserved or just a sign of the fans' and reviewers' distaste for the recent changes in the line-up?\n\n'Man on the Edge' differs a lot from the rest of the album; a relatively short, speedy song, full of bile and hell's fury, and it really paints a good picture of the breakdown that Michael Douglas suffers in the movie that the song is based on (Falling Down). It's obvious that this is the work of Janick Gers, as the riffs are more upbeat and have a bit more of that classical rock sound than we're used to with Harris and Murray at the helm, at least on this album.\n\nNext on the list is 'The Edge of Darkness' which just might be one of the best work they did during the nineties, at least during Bayley's stay with the band. Granted, the music had been simplified conciderably compared to their work in the eighties, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Though different subjects, most of the songs deals with very dark themes, such as war and the frailty of the human mind. 'The Edge of Darkness' starts out with a smooth and gentle introduction until it builds up to a satisfying climax where our soldier gets his task of killing his superior. What strikes me after listening through it a few times, is how much they really get out of such a thin sound. Harris pounds away on the bass like a frigid monkey as usual, but there's barely any sign of the distortion and powerchords we're used to. Even so, the solos near the end of the song, complimented by Bayley's butch voice really gets the blood pumping in your veins.\n\nThe songs 'Justice of the Peace' and 'Judgement Day' were understandably cut from the album. They aren't necessarily bad songs, they simply didn't fit in. 'Justice of the Peace', as with the title track, is a combined effort between Gers and Bayley, with a more classic, melodic heavy metal sound. It has an insanely catchy chorus, but the lack of power is a lot more evident than on 'The Edge of Darkness' and doesn't catch on fire like it should. It's like train that almost could. 'Judgement Day' doesn't differ much, but picks up the pace to some extent. It switches between Murray shredding like it's 1982, and, unfortunately, the same limp sound as on the previous tracks. It really takes the vigor out of these songs, and you're constantly leaning forward, waiting for the take-off that never comes.\n\nAll in all it's a nice, little collection of songs, but it's a half good/half bad deal. It's like buying a really comfy matrass, but someone pissed on it. While 'Man on the Edge' and 'The Edge of Darkness' are both really good songs, worthy of mention in Maiden's lengthy history, the other two tracks really pull it down in the mud. As I said, they aren't necessarily bad, but they have an unfinished demo-sound to them. I think they have great potential that just weren't realized. So, if you're a hardcore fan, you'll try to get a hold of the european single with the extra song, but for anyone else, it's just not worth it, since you've already got the best tracks on 'The X Factor'.\n",
        "\nAs a long-time fan of Iron Maiden is was awaiting this album since almost four years, the longest gap ever between two albums of this band. When I first listened to \"El Dorado\" when it was published on the official website at midnight, I was one of the first to discover the new song. I thought that it was something new and unusual with a jam intro and outro, almost spoken word verses and a powerful chorus that comes quite late. I also thought that this song was a rather average song but now I know that is one of the best ones on the album. The other two songs on the album which I like is the opener \"Satellite 15... the final frontier\" that surprises with a very progressive and experimental introduction that proves that the band can still innovate and create something new. Otherwise, \"Where the wild wind blows\" is a good epic track and even if we have already heard several comparable songs and even if this one isn't as strong and innovating as the big classics, it might still please to the majority of the Iron Maiden fans.\n\nNow, where does this album fail? First of all, there is the sound. It all sounds very dumb and almost like a demo recording. Especially \"El Dorado\" has some sound problems and also technical lacks as the drumming is out of the rhythm and filled with mistakes. This album wants to transmit a certain live feeling but that doesn't fit with the progressive style at all.\n\nSecond, the elaboration of the songs is extremely poor. Most of the tracks sound as if they were written in several jam sessions and blindly recorded without arranging them or taking a second look at the product. Often, the instruments play all at the same time like the guitar parts in the horribly weak \"The talisman\" that almost causes headaches. There is no clear line, no progression and no emotion a part of confusion in the track. \"Starblind\" is a comparable random jam session and Bruce Dickinson sings a completely different melody than the guitars play while bass and drums play yet another rhythm. He sings as if he was under pressure and if he was screaming against the confusing potpourri of failing melody lines. The result is just horrible. \"Mother of mercy\" has got the same problem as Bruce sounds as if he was suffering while he is trying to sing more high pitched notes than ever needed. The band tries to sound progressive but they ultimately fail because they have good ideas for four or five minutes and decide to repeat the whole patterns to stretch the songs to an artificial length of eight to eleven minutes. That's the case for \"Island of Avalon\" that has a very interesting beginning and would be an enjoyable song if it would only last about six minutes but the last three minutes of repeating boredom and a lack of inspiration just make you want to skip the rest. It isn't the length that makes a song progressive or epic but the band doesn't seem to understand that. Boring long introduction of several minutes are present in almost every song. That can work for one or two tracks on an album but on this record half of the songs have unnecessary introductions like in \"The man who would be king\" that often fail to create an interesting atmosphere or tension. Sometimes the band even copies itself. \"Coming home\" has almost exactly the same elaboration and melody as \"Out of the shadows\" while \"The alchemist\" sounds like a mixture of \"Flash of a blade\" and \"The mercenary\". The song tries to sound like a classic but as he is by far weaker than the two mentioned tracks he just sounds lost on this overlong pseudo-progressive cacophony.\n\nThe third thing is the lack of motivation. After four long years where the band put so much energy in their retro concerts around the world as well as in a couple of live recordings, compilation albums and documentaries, they seem tired to me. They worked out the song quite fast, recorded and published them quite fast without any process of reflection or authentic passion. There has been no real tour alongside the album. There hasn't been any physical single for the first time ever. They called some people to create a music video and a little game and weren't even involved in the whole development. They are still a great live band as I have seen them last summer but everywhere else, they seem to focus on something else. Adrian does his side projects, Bruce does a few other jobs, Nicko does some golf and they don't concentrate their creativity on the band that made them the legends they are today and forget about what they have achieved to be able to do side projects and more nowadays. They forget about their responsibility and legacy. They let this band musically die. \n\nI never thought that I would give less than sixty percent to any album of one of my favourite bands. Even some tracks on \"No prayer for the dying\" really rocked and sounded fresh and \"Virtual XI\" had at least a very unique, dreamy and progressive atmosphere that is enjoyable from time to time. This album simply goes nowhere and loses itself in endless introductions, repeating patterns and horrible guitar solos. If they are heading through the universe for the final frontier they seem now be torn into a black hole. Great recent offerings like the much diversified and heavily underrated \"Dance of death\" showed that the band is still able to be surprising and diversified and so there is maybe a way out of trouble. But it will be a long way back to the top and I hope that they won't leave us with this pseudo-intellectual piece of boredom.\n\nThe next time they should give fewer concerts and focus on the music and the song writing before going to the studio...\n",
        "\nThere is nothing to say about Iron Maiden that hasn't been said yet. They're probably the best known metal band in the world. And their live concerts are always well reviewed. So, what went in their head (maybe I should say \"in Steve's head\") when they decided to release this \"live compilation\"? The songs in fact are recorded in different places during the Fear Of The Dark tour '92 and '93, even if it is mastered to seem a unique concert. The tracklist is a selection of songs taken from the first five albums of the band.\n\nThe performance is really energic through all the lenght of the album, maybe the sound isn't the best, but this is exactly how Maiden sounded live in '92-'93. Even if the vocals are not too clean and the bass sound should have been deeper, the drums are great and the guitars are loud enough.\nWe start with an excellent version of The Number Of The Beast, followed by The Trooper (incredibly loud and powerful), Prowler (maybe this one should have been played faster) and Transylvania. Then comes Remember Tomorrow, which features a very good vocal performance, and Where Eagles Dare, which is really faster than the studio version. Sanctuary is played in a slight different way than usual. Running free features a good partecipation by the audience, but the sound is a bit too weak. Run To The Hills, 2 Minutes To Midnight and Iron Maiden are pure energy, while the version of Hallowed Be Thy Name on this album is maybe one of the best ever.\n\nThere are some errors in the performance, but the energy is so much that they're nearly unimportant. Some of the solos are improvised, but they are all great. The crowd is really loud and the sound is a little dirty, but these elements give a stronger sense of autenticity to the recording, fortunately this live has not been heavily modified in the studio during the mastering process.\n\nThis is another great proof of Maiden's capabilities, and listening to it at the maximum volume is almost like being at a real concert. It can remind of No Sleep 'Til Hammersmith by Motorhead, both are releases of incredible energy despite the fact that the production and the sound aren't the best. Metal concerts magic!\n",
        "\nAh, Iron Maiden. They are easily one of the most influential bands of all time, up there with Blind Guardian and Judas Priest. And like most early metal, they are from England, which again shows up the American music scene (but if that is a surprise to you, open your eyes!). This album is from when Iron Maiden showed back up on the radar with them bringing back vocalist Bruce Dickinson, a very important decision. This will help them phenomenally after fails like Virtual XI and others that are too horrible to mention. As the label says on the CD, welcome to 21st century Maiden.\n\nThe best way to look at this album is by dividing the songs into three groups, based on the length of the song. All of these songs contain that distinct Iron Maiden sound, and unlike some of their other works, this album just screams power metal. Soaring vocals, ripping guitars that chug and amaze, plus a drummer that can enter and leave his mark at will, all contribute to that delightful conclusion, as power metal is one of the most legendary genres.\n\nSo first, let us examine the short songs. These are Wicker Man, The Mercenary, and The Fallen Angel. This is the most underused style of song on the album and appeals directly to the mainstream radio metal. Most of the time I\u2019m against this, but here it works beautifully. Solos are nice, sweet, technical, melodic, short and memorable, which really pulls the song together as it ends. These songs also make use of a very catchy chorus which really indicates the attempt at mainstream. However, when most of the time these annoy me, it works delightfully here. Occasionally with bands like Blind Guardian that might get overused, but with only three songs styled like that it is a welcome respite from the rest of the album.\n\nNext on the table are the medium length songs which clock in at around six to seven minutes. These are Ghost of the Navigator, Brave New World, Blood Brothers, and Out of the Silent Planet. These songs differ from those aforementioned in that they all feature some type of intro or slowed down solo section (Blood Brothers is the only one). They might feature acoustic guitar (Brave New World), some folk elements (Blood Brothers), an epic buildup (Ghost of the Navigator), or maybe even a solo right in the beginning (Out of the Silent Planet).\n\nAs these songs progress, you can tell with relative that these are the star songs of the album, and it is where Iron Maiden is most comfortable overall, in my own amateur opinion. The song writing takes things much more complex and intricate than the shorter ones, and solos abound in much longer sessions, which defy the mind. The soloists could be any of the THREE guitarists, each with their own distinct style that comes through, although I have no clue who is who. It is also these three guitarists which I do not feel is utilized at every moment, but then again there is very little material out there which does exhibit that many. A missed opportunity, but still very good guitar work on these songs.\n\nThe last three songs to be mentioned are each about nine minutes long, and these are Dream of Mirrors, The Nomad, and The Thin Line between Love and Hate. These songs take it nice and slow with their interchanging tempos, which also keep me interested, especially on the repetitive speed demon Dream of Mirrors. I appreciate that they take these long songs slow, as they provide a good deal more imagery than other longer songs (Nile comes to mind as one who doesn\u2019t, but they are a another story entirely, on the opposite end of the metal spectrum). These songs feature absolutely entrancing solos (The Thin Line between Love and Hate is great at that), which mesmerize the listener and shows us why this is Iron Maiden, capable of all this on a single album, not amateurs.\n\nThese long songs also feature the most interesting drumming on the album. There is interesting double bass pedal work throughout, but the real talent is shown on these longer and middle length songs. Here, intricate rhythms seamlessly intertwine with the leading melodies in an accomplishment of songwriting. Dickinson is also most at home when he sings here and the vocals are astonishingly clear and the story is keeping you on the edge of your seat almost as much as the song. OK, not really but the lyrics are interesting, despite their vague meanings.\n\nI feel that this album was an instant classic, and shows us today with new Iron Maiden albums coming out, what the standard is for Iron Maiden, and it is very high. The legendary band shocks you with their recent return and how much they can pick up from their last album. Must buys; Ghost of the Navigator and The Thin Line between Love and Hate, but any of the middle length songs are also highly recommended. Actually, I love every song on here. But I\u2019ve ranted enough. Good buy. God, I am make too many puns.\n",
        "\nI know that this is not a very common or popular opinion, but for me, the X-Factor is my favourite Iron Maiden record. I have known the band with Bruce Dickinson as a singer and I really liked their classical records like \"Powerslave\" or \"Somewhere in time\" and even their early stuff with Paul Di'Anno. I discovered the Blaze Bayley era of the band quite late and had heard a lot of negative comments about him and the band's style and direction at the time when he was in it. When I first listened to the x-Factor, I really liked the dark and profound atmosphere but I found many songs on the album too long and too similar. Today, four years later, I have completely changed my point of view. This album has grown on me like no other album of the band. It is way more intense and atmospheric than any other stuff the band has ever tried. It is probably the best metal record of the whole nineties to me. \n\nThe album starts with one of my favourite Iron Maiden songs, \"The sign of the cross\". Many people say that this song is too long, too dark and too complicated to take it as an opener, but I don't think so. The album introduces perfectly to the dark atmosphere of this whole piece of art. It is courageous to put this song as an opener but this courage was worth the try. The song starts with monk choirs and some really dark vibes before Blaze Bayley introduces himself as the new singer of Iron Maiden. I think that it was an excellent choice of Steve Harris to not choose a similar singer to Bruce Dickinson and take the easy way out with high pitched voice singer. When Paul Di'Anno with his wild voice and punk attitude had left the band, Steve Harris had also chosen to not take a similar singer but to try something different with Bruce Dickinson's very particular voice and it has been the best choice at that time, too. It's the same thing here. Bruce Dickinson would have never been able to sing as dark, as melancholic, as angry and desperate as Blaze Bayley on the X-Factor. Bruce Dickinson does some great performances of some of the album's songs on later live releases, but he sings the songs way too emotional, way too positive. \"Sign of the cross\" is a diversified, dark, melancholic masterpiece of eleven minutes with a great, long and surprising introdution with a very high tension and uneasy atmosphere, before Blaze Bayley literarily explodes and does a more than solid performance. Everything fits on this album. The guitar solos are emotional even if Adrian Smith isn't present here. Steve Harris is probably doing the job of his career on this album, you can very often hear his diversified and brilliant bass play and this dark tuned instruments fits perfectly to the atmosphere of the album and it sounds really fresh and surprising that this metal record is more based on the bass guitar than on the ordinary guitars. You've got all of this already in the first song and that's what makes him so innovative. \n\n\"Lord of the flies\" has a very catchy and dark introductional riff and Blaze does a particular emotional and brilliant job here. The melody of the bridge and the chorus is really catchy and doesn't go out of your mind any more once you have listened to it. \n\n\"The man on the edge\" is a surprisingly fast rocker and gives you a little break after more than fifteen minutes of melancholic atmosphere. It is a very fresh banger and welcome change in style in the very tension filled album. \n\n\"The fortunes of war\" is probably my favourite song on this record. A very dark, sad Blaze Bayley gets you in a very dark and emotional mood, the bass introduction by Steve Harris is the best one he has ever done. The guitars that interrupt the brilliant plugged and unplugged bass play sound very melodic and remind me of Mike Oldfield. The bridge to the second part of the songs fits perfectly and the songs is very diversified with very slow and very fast parts, sing-along parts and storyteller parts, melodic guitar solos and brilliant bass guitar passages. The outro closes the circle perfectly to the beginning of this masterpiece. \n\n\"Look for the truth\" has a very dark and eerie mood and the introduction gives me goose bumps every time I listen to it. Blaze Bayley sings in a stunning way after the intense introduction, you can really feel his desperate anger. He is not only a singer, he \"lives\" the lyrics and you get completely absorbed by his style. This song has great and atmospheric but very simple sing-along parts that fits perfectly with the rest of the song. \n\n\"The aftermath\" is a song I didn't like really much when I heard it first but this one really grew on me. I really like the somehow dreamy and melancholic guitars in the introduction and the intelligent lyrics of this song. The chorus is really not what you are used to listen to when you listen to this band and this is what makes this song very special and interesting. Give this song the time it needs to convince you, but once it makes \"click\" in your head you will really be into its very particular style and atmosphere. \n\n\"Judgement of heaven\" begins once again with a brilliant acoustic bass line before Blaze Bayley sings the introduction in his very particular style. The lyrics are so personal, so intense and so heavy that it really touches you. After the dark and desperate introduction and first verse, the chorus is so optimistic and the band makes you travel from hell to heaven and back. The melodic twin guitar parts are brilliant in the bridge are just amazing and the gallopping bumble bee bass guitar and Blaze's angry voice create a create contrast and an antithesis that fits with the lyrics. The screams in the outro are somehow a little bit inappropriate and strange but I take this as another surprise that underlines the emotions of the song. \n\n\"Blood on the world's hands\" begins with a hypnotic and mysterious bass intro and sounds just amazing. Some people say that it just sounds as if Steve Harris was tuning his instrument and playing some simple chords, but I wouldn't say that. The bass guitar has almost some mysterious folk sounds and the transition to the body of the song is perfectly done. Blaze Bayley sings then in a stunning and very emotional way. The uneasy and unusual chorus fits with the atmosphere of the song and the melodic bridge of the song gives you a little break and even some chills. Some dark orchestrations or keyboards underline the atmosphere of the song like in the opening track and this is very well done. \n\n\"The edge of darkness\" is a song that I didn't like in the beginning. It's introduction, with a helicopter sound and once again a very dominant bass guitar play and some simple guitar harmonies over it, seemed very long and unnecessary to me. Today, I realise that this part is necessary to create a very slow paced and depressive atmosphere that underlines the lyrics of the song. But it's worth waiting the time before the song gets heavier and has some very fast and stunning parts with a few melodic guitar solos. The song really grows more and more on me and has passed from the bottom to the top 3 songs of the album for me. \n\n\"2 AM\" works a little bit like \"Man on the edge\". It gives you a little break from the dark and complicated songs but it contains a very melancholic atmosphere. The melodic guitars dominate the bass guitar for the first time on the album and Dave Murray and Janick Gers do a brilliant job here. The chorus is simple and melancholic and this song would also have been a good choice for a single. Many people say that this song is the weakest one of the album, but I think it is a melodic and melancholic masterpiece and a welcome little change in style. \n\n\"The unbeliever\" is the most difficult song on the album. It is very long, very complicated, has many changes and breaks. Blaze is really on the loose and sings in a very particular style, once almost rapping, than angrily screaming or roaring. Almost folkloric bass interruptions, simple riffs, chill-out acoustic guitars and melodic guitar parts are all mixed together in this song and it is not easy to get an approach to that. Even after four years, I recognize the brilliant and innovating style of the songs but have some difficulties to really appreciate it. It is a very interesting experiment and I believe that this song still needs some time and that I will appreciate it even more in a couple of years. It is like a good wine that becomes better with its age and this song has already passed from the state of \"too weird\" to the state of \"innovative\" so that I'm sure that this song is even able to grow more and more within the next years. \n\nAll in all, you have eleven dark and melancholic masterpieces on this album. This album is intense and difficult, but it is worth waiting and trying to get an approach to it. I am sure that this album will be considered as a classic and heavily underrated album in one or two decades just like \"Somewhere in time\" that was criticized when it came out and is considered as a masterpiece nowadays by many fans. This album is the most intense and the most personal album of Iron Maiden. All the tragedy around the separation of Bruce Dickinson, the pressure and anger of the fans, Steve Harris' difficult divorce - all these things got combined and created an image of the band's surroundings and inner life that you can see and also listen to on this album. \n\nThe only negative point I see about this album is its average production (especially \"The sign of the cross\" should kick out a little bit more as an opener). I would also understand if some people would say that some songs of the album are too similar and that one or two songs less would have done a better job but on the other hand, I am very happy to have them all on an album and I would have even add the brilliant \"Virus\" to the album (which has been added on the \"Best of the beast\" greatest hits compilation one year later). Even the b-sides \"Judgement day\" and \"Justice of the peace\" are brilliant and one could have easily created two great albums with this material! That's what i think is a sad thing as many fans do not even now those three masterpieces. \n\nGive this album a chance and let the band pull and drown you towards the edge of darkness!\n",
        "\nBy now any experienced Iron Maiden listener should know roughly what they're going to get with a new CD. There's no way they'll ever release another in the style of 'Powerslave' or 'Seventh son of a seventh son'. They've come a long way since the undisputed glory days of the 80s, and everyone should be well familiar by now with the style they have established since their reunion with Adrian Smith and Bruce Dickinson at the turn of the century. In other words, anyone who didn't like 'A matter of life and death' should have known after only a cursory glance at the lengths of the songs in the tracklist that this CD wouldn't be for them. \n\nIron Maiden now find themselves in an enviable but well-earned position where they are guaranteed sales based on brand recognition alone, and are under no pressure to write for anyone other than themselves. There are no forced attempts at reverting to successful styles of days gone by, and 'The final frontier', for better and for worse, simply is what it is. \n\nThough had it not been for the advance release of \"El Dorado\" - more on that later - a couple of months before the release of the CD itself, it's safe to say the opening segment of \"Satellite 15... The final frontier\" would have had me worried that the boys had completely lost their minds. The dissonant drum and guitar bashing of course serves only as an (extremely) extended intro to the title track, and would probably work ok were it only a minute or so in length, but as it stands it is far, far too long and contributes much to what is a stop-start opening half to the CD. \n\n\"The final frontier\" itself continues the recent Maiden tradition of opening the CD (and also serving as lead single) with its least demanding song, though it is still an enjoyable romp - far better than 2003's uninspiring \"Wildest dreams\" - that survives a repetitive chorus and is lit up by surprisingly long solo section. One of Maiden's more breezy, rock-based songs, it nevertheless serves as an energetic starting point and reminds anyone simple enough to forget just how great the guitar talent in this band is. \n\nNow, \"El Dorado\" is a slightly different prospect. Despite the soaring chorus, it didn't convince me much at all on the first few listens, and despite being a definite grower is one of the CD's weaker moments. There just isn't enough energy in the verses, with the grooving riffs not powerful enough to sustain nearly 7 minutes of song, and Dickinson's singing doesn't really inspire until he reaches the pre-chorus. \n\n\"Mother of mercy\" is maybe the inverse of this, as while the moody verses gradually build and build and promise much, the chorus is rather weak and it feels like a lot of foreplay with no payoff. To make matters worse for the chorus, Dickinson is really not at this best, and his voice sounds uncharacteristically strained and out of sorts. \n\nHe sounds far more inspired on the following song though, and his passion can be heard soaring (no pun intended) through the chorus of \"Coming home\" - as well it should do, as it is another recounting of his well documented love of flying and the freedom and togetherness that he at least seems to feel that it brings. This sort of thing is the real heart of what Iron Maiden are all about these days - we've heard it on songs like \"Blood brothers\" and \"\"The thin line between love and hate\", and we here it on this one too; honest, heartfelt emotion. Fantastical lyrics still appear of course, but rather than channelling themselves through aggression or speed, Maiden often choose to lead their listeners on with songs of sweeping romance and plaintive beauty. \n\nIt is from this point on that 'The final frontier' at last finds its feet, as \"The alchemist\" (no relation to the Dickinson song, by the way) provides an injection of energy, with the Maiden stallion finally accelerating to its trademark gallop. It is the only song on the CD to consistently go down this road, and to be honest I doubt I'm the only one who thinks it could do with a bit more of it throughout, but the quality of the rest of the songs from this point on speaks for itself. \n\nThe remaining 5 songs uniformly fit the 'controversial' style that has been a hallmark of Maiden's later career, and has been gradually on the increase in recent years (possibly excluding the more exuberant 'Dance of death') - not one is less than 7 1/2 minutes in length, and yes, all include a soft intro of either unsupported bass or clean/acoustic picking before the song properly kicks in. \n\nThe thing is, they're all good; they're all really good. And while, yes, Maiden may to some extend be writing to formula these days, when the results end up as captivating as this, who really cares? Of the 5, it could only really be argued that the intro to \"Starblind\" is especially gratuitous, and in fact had the song just started cold with the skittish riff that kicks things off properly it may have been an improvement. A minor complaint though, as the song is another triumph, laced with excellent lead playing and weaving effortlessly through a variety of tempos. It also dispels those early worries about the man with the mic, as the chorus here is as challenging as any on the CD and Dickinson sails through it. \n\n\"Isle of Avalon\" precedes it in the tracklist and the 2 fit well together, each wandering into progressive rock territory with extended instrumental sections and lengthy solos that give all 3 guitarists plenty of room to breathe comfortably. The cymbal work backing the bass in the portentous intro to \"Isle of Avalon\" also serves to remind that Nicko McBrain has lost none of his flair or indeed stamina, and keeps an edge on things until the song explodes fantastically to life. \n\nNot to make too much of these intros, but \"The talisman\" keeps it going with a long, crystalline acoustic section - there's always something special in store when Maiden unplug, from \"The prophecy\" right the way through to \"Journeyman\" and this song is no different. Janick Gers has more than his fair share of detractors as a player, but I doubt many people could question his ability as a songwriter these days when he is involved with tracks like this one. This is maybe the band at their most cinematic, the stirring melodies, urgent riffs and of course a meticulous chorus fully encapsulating the spirit of doomed adventure that the lyrics detail. \n\nLike Gers on the previous song, Dave Murray has only one writing credit on the whole CD, which isn't unusual for him of late. But while he may be slowing down as a writer, he usually pulls out all the stops on the limited contributions he does make. \"The man who would be king\" is typical of his style in recent years, the soothing atmosphere of the intro, outro and interludes something of a trademark to him lately, and perfectly suited to his off-the-cuff style of playing. This is another song in the same vein as \"Coming home\" where, without going into ballad territory, the band show they aren't afraid of a little reflection and at least partially ditch the heaviness in favour of contemplative serenity. \n\nAs if just to embody how 'The final fronteir' is an exercise in patience and appreciating a gradual build-up to something wonderful, the best is undoubtedly saved for last. The only song penned entirely by Steve Harris this time round (he of course co-wrote everything else), \"When the wild wind blows\" is nothing short of a masterpiece, a breathtaking bit of work that can comfortably stand shoulder to shoulder with any other song of his long career. \n\nAnyone receptive to the style the band have taken recently will know how special a song they're in for when the main, achingly beautiful melody begins in earnest at around the 40 second mark, and the song as a whole does not fail to deliver as it carries the listener on a journey through a varied landscape of searing beauty and tender despair. \n\nThis is the song Harris has been trying to write for about 15 years now - several of the last CDs have featured tracks of interminable length written in a similar layout to this one, and he finally seems to have cracked it as despite being a second short of 11 minutes in length it feels like not a breath has been wasted in its execution, the guitarists running the show in the various solo breaks and Dickinson on top form as he delivers the tragic lyrics with a burning passion. \n\nI can't help but feel the rating I've assigned might seem a little low in light of the praise I've lavished upon most of the songs, and objectively speaking I've definitely given lesser CDs higher ratings, but with the weight of the band's previous catalogue on it, 'The final frontier' is easy to see as being far from perfect. Rather, it is an honest display of British heavy metal edging towards a healthy and natural conclusion after 35 years in the business. Iron Maiden have nothing to prove to anyone, but it is credit to a legacy of defiance and integrity that they continue to write the songs they want to write. Anyone of a like mind is welcome to join the party, and who gives a damn about anyone else? \n\n(Originally written for http://www.metalcdratings.com/)\n",
        "\nIron Maiden is the greatest heavy metal band to ever live. Thirty years after the release of their self-titled album, they are arguably just as relevant as they ever have been\u2014not resting on their laurels and imitating a hits jukebox, but instead touring the world playing their new material to the joy of fans everywhere. After what was a rousing success with their most recent record, the 2006 release of A Matter of Life and Death, there is actually maybe a bit more pressure on the band to produce something that is quality, memorable and, frankly, classic. Especially with the rumors floating around that this is Maiden's final album, spurred even further on by the fact that Steve Harris helped write every song on the record, the pressure cooker of fan scrutiny is reaching fever pitch. And so it falls to this Angry Metal Guy to try to put all of this into some sort of context; to try to listen to my favorite band with fresh ears\u2014and I've come to some realizations about the band in the process. \n\nThe Final Frontier has promised to be a controversial record since the cover art was unveiled, actually. This new, comic booky Eddie in space stirred up a strange sense of dread among fans, not offset by the fact that \"El Dorado\", the first track released, was a bit of a grower to the say the least. And that's a good analogy for how the record begins\u2014\"Satelite 15...\" is without a doubt the weirdest thing that Iron Maiden has ever included on a record, complete with distorted bass and a drum machine that lead right into what is probably the most straight forward rock song Maiden has ever written in their career\u2014\"The Final Frontier\". However, the track flows right into an in context \"El Dorado\" and suddenly the record is flying. And, really, it stays in air for the next 42 minutes.\n\nStarting with \"Mother of Mercy\", The Final Frontier really starts to kick some ass. With the reintroduction of the gallop and some of the darker lyrics that the band has written, going right in hand with A Matter of Life and Death and themes from Dance of Death as well. \"Coming Home\", a track about Dickinson's flying, is actually a surprising stand out. While the song itself is pretty simple and practically a power ballad, it sports one of the catchiest choruses that the band have ever written and has an anthemic quality that will serve the live show very well. \"Isle of Avalon\", \"Starblind\" and \"The Talisman\" are all songs that sport classic late-Maiden riffs and choruses and are great (\"Isle of Avalon\" especially so), but the standout track from the middle of the record for me is easily \"The Alchemist\", written by the ever-maligned Janick Gers with Harris and Dickinson. This track is the best song on the album\u2014it's got classic Maiden quality, speed, melodies and some fantastic lyrics. Therefore: I fully expect the band to not play it live and for the fans to piss on it publicly (see: \"Monts\u00e9gur\" and \"The Pilgrim\", two ridiculously underrated tracks from the last couple records).\n\nHowever, after an hour of awesome, The Final Frontier grinds to what is an unpleasant halt for me. While the album flows expertly through a variety of styles that really exemplifies Iron Maiden's long and storied career, the Murray and Harris penned \"The Man Who Would Be King\", and Harris' solo piece \"When the Wild Wind Blows\" really just drag down the end of the record. Two major problems stand out with them. Firstly, both of them share some of the most rambling and, I'm going to be frank, bad lyrics that Harris has ever penned, and secondly, the song writing is really just ... subpar; slow, dragging and puzzled together without any comprehensible segues or thoughts for structure. While \"The Man Who Would Be King\" has some great parts in it, it is just too long. The lyrics, as well, are contradictory, poorly conceived and the only song that I can think of that has worse lyrics in the history of Iron Maiden is Steve's screed about how shitty the world is and about how he's old and bitter in \"Age of Innocence\" from Dance of Death. And while conceptually \"When the Wild Wind Blows\" is an awesome song, again, it's just too long, too drawn out and lyrically poorly executed. Really, it's reminiscent of the stuff Harris has been penning since X Factor, but without the emotional poignancy that was so strong on that album. This leaves an unfortunately poor aftertaste to what is otherwise a shining example of Iron Maiden's relevance in 2010.\n\nSo let me put it like this: if this record were 55 minutes long it would be a tremendous piece of genius. Rod used to brag about how Maiden always delivered 45 minutes of music when they released a new record in the 1980s. Now, with the advent of CD, there seem to be expectations that they produce 80 minutes of music instead. While there are many other factors, I do think it's interesting that this band never produced a poor record until the advent of the CD (well, OK, No Prayer for the Dying is pretty stinky, but musically it's still pretty awesome even if Bruce singing directly from his crotch puts a pall over otherwise good songwriting). It leaves me to question how this record would have sounded if the band had been forced to edit it down for LP length... I have a feeling I'd be talking about how this was Iron Maiden's best record since Seventh Son of a Seventh Son. Instead, I'm having kind of the opposite reaction I had to A Matter of Life and Death, where the beginning of the record always left me a little cold, but the end always blows me away. This record just sorta fizzles out after \"The Talisman\".\n\nHowever, 15 albums later for a lot of bands, there's no point in telling you to buy their records (hahaha, new Kiss?? Yeah, right.). Not so with Iron Maiden: The Final Frontier is still a kick ass group of songs which showcases that the band is still one of the best heavy metal bands in the world. From this album it is already clear to me that \"Isle of Avalon\", \"Mother of Mercy\" and \"The Alchemist\" will live on as testaments to the band and their later material and the whole record is layered enough that you'll be hearing new things when you pop it into your CD player or iPod in months and maybe years. This is Iron Maiden in its some of its finest post-Brave New World form and definitely competing for the best of the four. So, Up the fucking Irons! (And buy the fucking record!)\n\nOriginally posted at AngryMetalGuy.com.\n",
        "\nThis has been a much long awaited release by the British heavy metal legends, Iron Maiden. Still sticking to their roots, however, this album is very different from their classic releases in the 80s. A lot like A Matter of Life and Death, Iron Maiden has continued working on their new-found progressive sound with longer longs and odd time signatures. Their ascension up the heavy metal hierarchy can be really attributed to their previous style; harmonized leads and 4-5 minutes classics. How will this album fare with the critics? It\u2019s certainly a point to be proven by Steve and his mates.\n\nThis is, as I said before, a completely different album and one which will receive much criticism and acclaim simultaneously. For me though, I had to listen to the whole album three times before I could come to like it. It does prove a point; it\u2019s a pretty good album. Anyone can dislike it at first go and not listen to it a second time before jumping to a straightforward conclusion. Although, grabbing the listeners\u2019 attentions is a key aspect of a success, this album is not dismissive. It is a good album which sticks to some basics that have come to define the archetypes of Iron Maiden\u2019s music. Steve Harris still maintains those galloping basslines that made this band\u2019s music so popular and sonically \u201cdifferent\u201d. It\u2019s always catchy. Moreover, Adrian did a good job in taking the lead role in compositions and his solos sounded beautiful and well constructed. I guess, Janick didn\u2019t play a big part in solos in The Final Frontier.\n\nWhat disappointed me, however, was that, provided many of the songs were long, the instrumentals were not really varied. The verse and chorus repeated a couple of times and that was really it. I expected some well executed interludes and guitar harmonies. All the lengthy songs, quite characteristically, start like those in AMOLAD- with slow clean guitar passages and Steve\u2019s basslines. Not that it sounds bad, more like it has become a hackneyed start. Although, I really love the intro of \u201cThe Talisman\u201d which starts off with a beautiful acoustic passage played by Janick. I really expected some more acoustics in this album bearing in mind that the albums are going to be long. On contrary, the only song that had the touch of the classic Maiden is \u201cThe Alchemist\u201d with its intro guitar defining it all. It also has a catchy chorus with Bruce singing it well- although Bruce didn\u2019t put one his operatic voice into it. Now, Bruce\u2019s voice sounded extremely tired in the chorus sections of this album, exemplified by the choruses of \u201cMother of Mercy\u201d and \u201cEl Dorado\u201d, both of which are quite decent songs. The beginning of this album, the title song, is rather eccentric which commences with a Harris bass section that sounds quite psychedelic. To me, the long intro wasted the song and it would\u2019ve served better to be only the last four minutes. To me, the best song of this album was its longest- Where the Wild Wind Blows. It has great melodic guitar works and very good lyrics. But, the repeating song structures prevented it from entering my all time Iron Maiden favourites.\n\nThis is a good album, no doubt; however it has the potential to disappoint many fans. I think they could\u2019ve worked on a bit differently. If they really wanted to create progressive metal, they could\u2019ve made the guitars sound heavier, maintaining a modicum of melody. If an Iron Maiden freak, but I still can\u2019t say that it is really good or great. Simplified, it is good but, it could\u2019ve been better for the sake of the band\u2019s talent. If this album fails to make a world wide sales impact, I won\u2019t be surprised. It\u2019s clear that Iron Maiden has tried something new, and it is really appreciated by many. However, people looking for the Iron Maiden classics of the 80s won\u2019t find this album very pursuing probably because of over-experimentation and repetitions of the song structures.\n",
        "\nThis summer has seen the finalization of Iron Maiden\u2019s fifteenth studio album, as well as the worldwide tour which came with it. The first sign of this album\u2019s content came over two months before its release with the presentation of its first single, El Dorado, in a simple one-song format, which seems to have become the staple of many single releases for these past few years. \n\nEl Dorado is a pretty strange song in that, upon first listen, back in June, it was rather disappointing. It felt like it lacked that Iron Maiden feeling and gave off a very tired overall impression, without any of the catchiness and fun of the previous decade\u2019s singles, such as The Wicker Man and Rainmaker, without even mentioning the brilliant 80s singles which largely made them famous. Then something strange happened. I\u2019ve had the occasion to hear the song over a longer period of time, both the studio version and the live version. Twice. This has led me to a simple conclusion: this is a track destined first and foremost for the band\u2019s live performances, and this realization has actually allowed me to enjoy it immensely more than before in all forms. In fact, it can safely be said that it beats anything released since the Brave New World singles, even if not necessarily by a very wide margin. \n\nEl Dorado is something of an acquired taste. Further listens will instill the lyrics in one\u2019s mind, and from then on out it\u2019s extremely enjoyable as a song along track, replacing that initial catchiness that was conspicuously absent upon first listen. It also seems to base itself a lot not on being an easy to like rocker but a more complex one, starting with a minute of instrumentals, including the first few seconds which sound exactly like the type of stuff a band plays when they end a concert. This in itself renders the song less accessible than pretty much all of their other singles. But even when the vocals kick in, El Dorado keeps on this very aggressive, very traditional guitar-based heavy metal path, compromising absolutely nothing for more catchiness. The riffs are intent on being almost crushing in nature, not necessarily memorable. However, this is a nice change from their usual material and the work here is flawless by the triad of guitarists. Even the bass is quite prominent, with a few sections where only it is heard. There are also considerable pace variations during the whole number, with a preference for slowness during the verses and some slightly faster choruses. Drumming is fairly standard if proficient and technical; it simply fits in with the rest of the music without being anything of exception (the bright side is that it\u2019s not too loud, as often happens with modern metal releases). \n\nBruce\u2019s vocal performance here is quite impressive. He doesn\u2019t sound tired at all, possessing pretty much all the range and talent that he\u2019s always had since the beginning of his career with the band. His work fits in perfectly with the considerably less catchy and commercial nature of this track, except during that chorus which is pretty hard to forget after a certain number of listens. \n\nEl Dorado is, in the end, an impressive representation of the similarly good The Final Frontier, and a good choice for a single. Curiously, the song sounds a lot more aggressive and powerful live than it does in its studio version. Either way, this, their best single in about a decade, proves that the band are in no way tired nor are they running out of ideas anytime soon; they\u2019re still going strong with their post-2000 streak of solid material.\n",
        "\nThis really is a do-nothing album - essentially, if you took all that Maiden attempted - or perhaps shouldn\u2019t have been attempting - in the past 20 years, and then took it down to X Factor levels of drudgery then you\u2019d pretty much have this album. I honestly have a hard time believing that people want to justify this crap, it seems Maiden have got stuck in-between moving forward as a band and playing some sort of homage to their glory years, instead, it seems they\u2019ve decided that paying tribute to all the folly of the past 20 years - you know, the unexciting part of their career.\n\nSay what you will about Steve Harris as a songwriter, at least in the 80s he could write songs that flowed well and went somewhere. The Final Frontier seems to be haphazardly constructed, generic post-reunion Maiden interspersed with even more of Mr. Harris\u2019s \u201clook I\u2019m influenced by Geddy Lee\u201d Rush-isms that so plagued The X Factor. Hell, The X Factor was far from a passable album but at least it had its moments\u2026 here they're really, really struggling. The Final Frontier simply offers very little that I can welcome. \n\nThat said, there is something vaguely \u201cnew\u201d on offer here and it\u2019s worth commenting on, if only for its amusing idiocy. \u2018Satellite 15\u2019 is, of course, what I\u2019m talking about - something that certainly should have been left on the cutting-room floor, if not actually destroyed so that no-one would have to suffer through it. I can\u2019t help but feel Adrian Smith drank three bottles of wine and decided to submit a funny joke as a song as a way of getting his own back on Steve Harris (it must be pretty tiresome for a guitarist to have to do those \u201croot-fifth\u201d picked intros all the time) and then Steve decides he loves it and makes it the opening track on the new album. Honestly, it sounds like the product of watching 30 minutes of bad, late-night sci-fi and deciding to write an alternative score to it. That, or a terrible outtake from Bruce Dickinson\u2019s Skunkworks album. I mean, sure, you can\u2019t blame \u2018em for branching from out beyond the dullard up-tempo tracks that have opened the last couple of albums - it\u2019s actually the first non-speedy album opener since The X Factor - but really, this? I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve heard much like it on metal albums, but then again, there\u2019s probably a reason for that. Though, far from a dramatic or impressive song you\u2019d have wished they\u2019d simply have cut straight to the title track. The verses are clunky as hell and they seem to be riddled with that same \u201cold man, self-help\u201d vibe that Maiden lyrics seem to be cluttered with these days (even if it\u2019s about being in space rather than step-by-step instructions on how to find your car keys), but at least the chorus is memorable in a good way. \n\nSo, that was alright, you know. Although, after that intro they probably could have put in an extended version of \u2018The Angel and the Gambler\u2019- now with even more choruses! - and it still would have sounded ok. But then it\u2019s back to some dullard metal in the form of \u2018El Dorado\u2019. Now, I\u2019m not really surprised that this hasn\u2019t been setting the world alight since it\u2019s basically a No Prayer\u2026/Fear of the Dark rocker without the snarling vocals, and it\u2019s actually more grating than, say, \u2018Bring Your Daughter\u2026\u2019 and what have you. What\u2019s to say, really, it just shifts from ideas you\u2019d wish would end before they actually begun. Although, the solo section is actually somewhat entertaining\u2026\n\nThough, while on the subject, I have to ask myself at this point, what the hell is happening with Adrian Smith\u2019s guitar playing at this point? For the some parts he\u2019s decided to play around with some weird sort of \u201cRobin Trower if in space, and not feeling very well\u201d vibe for a few leads on this album, I know it could be an attempt to fit in with the band\u2019s chosen theme for this album, but it certainly doesn\u2019t work on in the classic \u201csupposed to sound good\u201d thing that we\u2019ve come to expect from lead guitarists. Honestly, I didn\u2019t think he had a bad solo in him - ever since Killers his solos have often been an emotional climax in many great Maiden songs. But here, a lot of his solos just sound, well, off and it's not like he\u2019s forgotten how to play, some of the stuff here is just of good as he\u2019s ever played (even if it lacks the good songs surrounding it). Again, just like the intro, I think he\u2019s laughing at us. Maybe he\u2019s been watching those old Bad News videos alongside the bad sci-fi\u2026 seeing how many Vim Fuego solos he can get away with.\n\nFuck me, this is an album to check your watch to. It sounds like they took ho-hum Maiden songs and dragged them out just because, well, \u201cwe\u2019re Iron Maiden, we\u2019ve always written long songs\u201d. I don\u2019t know if anyone\u2019s ever explained this to Steve Harris but if you put several long songs together it\u2019s not automatically \u201cepic\u201d\u2026 it\u2019s often quite testing. You\u2019ll notice great songs - that happen to be long - don\u2019t often feel like the take a great amount of time to pass. Making a seventy-minute snoozer with possibly seven minutes worth of good ideas doesn\u2019t seem like the best way to promote your new album. \u2018Where the Wild Wind Blows\u2019 seems to be the worst offender - just how many times can Mr Harris expect to trot on those picked power chord parts with the vocal melody and lead guitar simply doubling each? It worked for \u2018Fear of the Dark\u2019, sure, but eighteen years later it\u2019s not so fresh. It doesn\u2019t help that the song\u2019s absolutely sleep-inducing - hell, if the apocalypse does come let\u2019s pray it\u2019s not this ho-hum. It\u2019s basically \u2018For the Greater Good of God\u2019 with far less energy and drive, not to say that the said A Matter of Life and Death number was excessively energetic it\u2019s just this is really fucking dreary. You can tell Bruce hasn\u2019t had much say in writing his own melodies here - it\u2019s obviously just stuff he\u2019d never choose to sing for himself in a million years. It\u2019s just cheese, especially the \u2018got to help each other\u2019 \u201cFeed the World\u201d moment. It\u2019s a song with a 'clever twist', too, (I won't spoil it for you, feed your cash to the Maiden Machine and be rewarded with its ho-hum songwriting) which I guess is trying to be clever - but I think it was Harris\u2019s excuse for bring one more of the dreaded false ending-quiet outro technique for one last hurrah\u2026 congratulations, Steve, because it really wasn\u2019t getting boring after the last album. Whatever happened to songs with good twists? \u2018Pray for you death/ because if you survive\u2026 you\u2019ll die in pain in World War V!\u2019 for instance. \n\nWhat more do you want, really? There\u2019s a whole lot of bad stuff going on here; with very few redeeming features. Generic old-man Maiden fare combined with some absolutely risible experimentations. Boring songs about the end of the world are rife\u2026 Bruce doing that annoying voice-straining accenting that no one really likes a lot, and Steve proving to the world that he\u2019s a completely spent force as a songwriter. I\u2019d say about the only real enjoyment you\u2019ll get from this album is observing how the, shall we say, more devoted fans of the band will tell you it\u2019s a fantastic album and, here we go again, \u201ctheir best since Seventh Son\u2026\u201d \n\n\u201cTheir best since Rust in Piece\u201d.\n\n\u201cTheir best since Painkiller\u201d.\n\n\u201cTheir best since And Justice For All\u201d.\n\nAre you beginning to see a pattern forming? No? Oh well, carry on.\n",
        "\nComing form a very succesful Somewhere Back In Time world tour, the Maiden machine hit back the road with the announcement of a new album. The world was kept in constant touch about the developent of the record and according to descriptions, it was to be one of the best thing they had done in a while. The time soon came when Maiden announced the new single El Dorado was to be released. The whole world waited with huge expectations to catch the single.\n\nThe new Maiden single is typically like the previous Maiden singles, short, catchy, galloping, simple and to the point. But this one lacks the ferocity of Aces High, the darkness of Be Quick or Be Dead, the melodies of Infinite Dreams, or the chorus of the Trooper. In short Maiden, in this song tried hard to create the earlier effect which made their singles enjoyable, but failed to add intresting portions in it. The single sounds dated and nothing is surprising or adventurous. The vocals aren\u2019t that inspiring. Dickinson sounds tired. Repetetive and poor quality choruses have been plaging Maiden albums since The X Factor, and here the problem emerges again. The chorus is pretty weak and dated especially considering who wrote it.\n\nIn spite of all these defects, gentlemen, this is Maiden doing what they do best. \u2018Arry is still at his galloping best. The triple guitar unit of Murray-Smith-Gers are in fine shape and the guitar work in this song is quite good. The lead work is what you would expect from Maiden, superb as usual. The drum work, well its Nicko McBrain on the drums with his single bass drum, so you can\u2019t expect any flaws. Yes, the drum work is really superb.\n\nConcluding we can say that this is just OK. These type of songs are something we listen from Maiden every time. Something adventurous could have been like a breath of fresh air here. This is neither epic nor something aggressive or something complex. This is simple, straight forward which is fun at the first listen or two but then slowly gets dated. The problem of weak chorus complicates the matter further. The lyrics aren\u2019t inspiring either and are just random. Nothing here just stands out to scream \u201cAAAH, TELL ME WHY I HAVE TO BE A POWERSLAVE!!!\u201d.\n",
        "\nIn the 80s, Iron Maiden put out their legendary seven album run that pretty much has never been duplicated exactly the same. They had a certain magic back than that may have never quite been reclaimed; but even so, their unique stylistic stamp has carried them headstrong into the new millennium. Iron Maiden has come so far from their early days and have put out so much material that they\u2019re almost a genre in and of themselves with how iconoclastic their sound is, all twists and turns they put in included. And they came out with a new album this year, so I guess it\u2019s time to break out the old reviewin\u2019 chops and get to work on analyzing The Final Frontier!\n\nThis is a Maiden album for Maiden fans, make no mistake. People who don\u2019t like the band\u2019s new direction probably won\u2019t be persuaded by this, but everyone else can be assured that The Final Frontier is more quality material from this veteran act. They\u2019ve got nothing to prove to anyone, after all. This is an album of hard-hitting, adventurous epic metal in the way that only they can deliver it \u2013 and there\u2019s a lot of it, as this 76 minute opus is by far their longest to date. But it doesn\u2019t ever feel that long. In fact, when the last note of \u201cWhen the Wild Wind Blows\u201d drops out, I go \u201cIs that all?\u201d None of these songs ever feels as long as they are, even when they hit the 9+ minute mark, as three of them here do.\n\nThe most amazing thing about this is probably Bruce Dickinson, who gives one of the best performances of his career on here. True, he doesn\u2019t sound as young as he did on Seventh Son and Piece of Mind, but if I didn\u2019t know better, I\u2019d say The Final Frontier is a swansong of sorts. The man is simply on fire here, singing his heart out on every single track. His vocal lines here seem to have been given a lot more attention than on the last few albums, as this is a heavily theatrical and stylized performance that really elevates the album to another platform altogether. On \u201cThe Talisman\u201d and \u201cComing Home,\u201d he gives perhaps the performances of his career. He just sounds so spirited and so powerful that it floored me.\n\nThe rest of the band are no slouches, however, as they have combined their creative talents to form a gestalt of majestic Maiden-style epics. Unlike the modernized and often gloomy direction their last few albums took, The Final Frontier soars and gallops with a newfound flame and energy that is, in the end, a kind of amalgam of their 80s albums\u2019 styles all at once. Finally we have an album with songs that play out like a storybook of sorts, taking the listener to all different places. \u201cThe Final Frontier\u201d takes me to a space station about to implode on itself. \u201cIsle of Avalon\u201d evokes a Pagan isle much like something out of the movie The Wicker Man, rife with a strange clan of natives about to follow their yearly harvest ritual. \u201cThe Talisman\u201d sweeps me into the sea on a rickety boat, battling the tides in search for some long-lost promised land.\n\nThe songwriting is\u2026well, it\u2019s Iron Maiden. The first few songs are all very classic styled, with galloping riffs and epic melodies galore, but the second half of the album dips into a slew of soul-stirring epic numbers. And these are real, genuine epic songs just like they did on \u201cRime of the Ancient Mariner\u201d and \u201cAlexander the Great\u201d \u2013 multiple time changes and theatrical devices that lead up to a stirring climax, with each of them being so dynamic that they only feel about half their real length. There are a ton of good moments here, from the rock riffing and hard edge of lead single \u201cEl Dorado\u201d to the almost chamber-like feel of the darker, echoing epic \u201cStarblind.\u201d I really like the way the band can still rock so hard with such simple, bare-bones riffing, such as in the heavy section of \u201cMother of Mercy\u201d or the \u201dI hear her crying, the tears of an angel\u2026\u201d section in \u201cIsle of Avalon.\u201d But all bow before the emotive power of the forlorn, tragic \u201cThe Man Who Would Be King,\u201d with the curious middle Eastern-style wailing of the chorus melody behind the epic riffing build-up being really cool and inventive. And the final \u201cWhen the Wild Wind Blows\u201d is one of the finer moments the band has seen in the new decade, with its restrained, subtle vocal lines and searing, fiery guitar harmonies building up to a truly stunning, memorable epic.\n\nThis is Iron Maiden on full power. They\u2019ll never return to the magic of their 80s days \u2013 that was something unique, and something that doesn\u2019t happen often. But with this album they prove that they are not stagnating, and although they have to work a little harder at it now, they still have it in them to produce really first rate music anyway. The Final Frontier has kept me coming back again and again with its masterful hooks and enveloping atmosphere, and I have never been prouder to be a fan of this band. Go buy this album right now; you will not regret it.\n\nOriginally written for http://www.metalcrypt.com\n",
        "\nI\u2019ve been into metal for about six years now, and during those years there were a few big bands in the genre and it relatives that released a new album. Metallica had the just decent Death Magnetic (which was disappointing), Megadeth had Endgame (which was good) and then there was Maiden\u2019s The Final Frontier. Numerous rumours about the release date of the album and its quality spread around the internet as fast as the swine flu, but what was truth and what was just fantasy? I got my copy on the release date and gave it my attention, hoping that this big release would be worth the excitement. And as it turned out, it is\u2026\n\nIn the past months I spent several listening sessions to Iron Maiden\u2019s previous release, A Matter Of Life And Death, hoping that I would finally \u201cget\u201d this album and thus be prepared for a possible successor with similar sound. My work paid off, I learned to appreciate the album and was now completely ready for anything Maiden could give the fans. But my efforts were not crucial to liking The Final Frontier: it is something different, some really rocking songs that don\u2019t need several spins to be appreciated make the album more accessible, and some songs that do require the extra attention give it more depth. Let\u2019s take a closer look at our telescope and explore the borders of the musical universe that Iron Maiden has conquered.\n\nThe biggest difference with A Matter Or Life And Death, or all post-reunion Iron Maiden albums for that matter, is the big diversity that can be found on the album. Harris and company serve us both pure rocker and more progressive songs. Both new and old elements are used on the album.\n\nLet\u2019s begin with the intro: the completely overwhelming Satellite 15 (which for reasons unknown to me has been glued to The Final Frontier), which is an industrial and experimental sounding track. The drums echo which gives the impression of a vast space, the bass is a constant and very deep droning sound on the background, the guitars play high tones and produce sounds and shrieks that one would deem very un-Maiden. Bruce sounds desperate as he screams for help in his desolate prison of infinite space \u2013 an excellent opener for an album with such science fiction artwork. But, as already mentioned, the song is glued to the next one. The songs are both about the same theme but about everything else is different. The Final Frontier could be your typical Iron Maiden song, including four to eight time repeating of a simple chorus and straightforward riffs.\n\nSongs as Mother of Mercy and The Talisman contain the most traces of A Matter Or Life And Death\u2019s progressive nature: a slow and gentle intro with Bruce singing some lines before the song becomes a heavy mastodon, with the drums and bass creating a midpaced tempo and a catchy chorus (Mother of Mercy). The Talisman evolves into a song dominated by fast riffing, sounding epic and majestic thanks to the three guitar formula. Janick Gers might not have been around during the Iron Maiden heydays of the 80\u2019s, but he has made some good contributions to the band: the riff popping up out of the background at 3:45 is a very good example of this. Short but catchy as hell, and it makes you want to spin back that few seconds of the record to hear it again. Little surprises like this make the progressive The Talisman easier to digest, despite being similar to The Legacy in intro and build-up.\n\nBut next to post-reunion Maiden influences there are also\u2026 prepare for it, this is good news!... 80\u2019s influences. The best example of this is Isle of Avalon: the song itself would not have been very out of place on Somewhere in Time or Seventh Son of a Seventh Son because of the heavy traces of these albums. The song begins with a bassline and a single guitar riff in a more electronic tune, playing a melody recalling the good old days of Wasted Years. The drums on this part resemble the build up of the instrumental part of Seventh Son of a Seventh Son: first some light but constant tickling of the hi-hats, later on accompanied by some drumming by the feet. This nice stew of sounds builds up to a chorus with Bruce singing high notes. The song sounds a little like \u201cnew old\u201d Iron Maiden. \n\nSomething really new is Starblind: progressive but different from what has been done on The Final Frontier\u2019s immediate predecessor. It\u2019s very difficult to bang your head to this one, as the vocals and the instruments meet at beginning and ending of a line but tread very different ways in between these to points. During the chorus one of the guitars starts playing a little solo melody (somewhere around 2:00), and some synthesizer can be heard if you listen closely. A very strange song, different from anything done before but when you listen to it you get the feeling that the formula is right. The different lines of the vocals, guitars, drums and bass are all contained within a wider melody. A potentially dangerous experiment but it turned out well.\n\nThe Final Frontier offers a mix of easy and progressive, old and new Iron Maiden. A welcome album after the dark and difficult A Matter Of Life And Death that can please both old and new fans of the band, it might take a place in my top five of Maiden albums!\n\nMy favourite songs: Isle of Avalon, El Dorado and the riff in When the Wild Wind Blows from 9:00 to 9:30 \u2013 this might be the best part of the album; epic and bittersweet tragedy.\n",
        "\nIron Maiden, that pleasant blend of blood drenched metal spikes in an upright, coffin shaped cell with the tormented screams of its hapless victims set to music, now taken its odyssey of melodic goodness up to the stars yet again. Although not quite the same blend of classic, galloping heavy metal with the once forbidden addition of keyboards that was \u201cSomewhere In Time\u201d, their latest offering in \u201cThe Final Frontier\u201d boasts of a renewed spirit towards a brand of metal with some unusually progressive elements, at least insofar as the band\u2019s history go. Perhaps the best way to describe the album is as being out of this world, although that is more a testament to its peculiar makeup than necessarily its overall quality. \n\nIt\u2019s usually customary to begin an excursion into the mystique of this longstanding brand name by recapping the sequence of events that led to this point, but given the auspicious nature of the album itself, it is more prudent to simply cut to the chase. This is, without a doubt, the strangest album that has ever been released under the Maiden logo. It bears a very strong resemblance to several older albums at a few key points, and each member of the fold retains the bulk of their signature sound, but when taking everything in as a whole, there is a strong vibe of newness that pervades the entire listen. Part of it might be chalked up to a slightly crunchier guitar character that is a little closer to their 80s character, but the spacey nature of the production of the rest of the arrangement, largely due to a feeling of distance and distinctiveness between each individual part that is far more prominent than any of their other albums after Smith and Dickinson returned to the group. \n\nAt times, one would swear he\u2019s listening to the soundtrack of some quirky piece of sci-fi cinema, particularly when considering the rather jarring intro and title song \u201cSatellite 15\u2026The Final Frontier\u201d. Essentially the first half of this song consists of an oddity drenched drone that sounds like it was lifted out of the early stages of thrash metal antiquity and painted with a progressive flavor right out of early progressive USPM pioneers such as Crimson Glory and Queensryche. The atmosphere is so reverb steeped that it almost seems to phase in and out of reality, and Bruce\u2019s vocal character follows suit like a distant voice of some radio transmission fading in and out of some sort of pool of cosmic waves. Things normalize a little bit when the midway point is reached and things settle into an old fashioned rock groove, but in spite of the familiar hooks and utter simplicity, the feeling of being lost in space endures. Part of it could be chalked up to the acoustic guitar accompaniment, which brings a little bit of a \u201cSpace Oddity\u201d vibe to what is otherwise a standard piece of rock fanfare.\n\nThere is somewhat of an affinity with the previous album \u201cA Matter Of Life And Death\u201d to be found in the sheer scope of the music found on here, but the presentation is very different. Whereas the previous album was almost completely overtaken by progressive rock influences, this one seems to be rediscovering Maiden\u2019s galloping glory days at times. Noteworthy examples of a more driving version of this band can be heard in the adventurous and catchy \u201cEl Dorado\u201d, pushing forward like a majestic steed towards a far off destination. Likewise, \u201cThe Alchemist\u201d takes things up to speed metal territory in a sort of \u201cAces High\u201d meets \u201cMan On The Edge\u201d fashion, fully exploiting the 3 guitar format with a brilliant series of melodic lead guitar sections that upstage most of the band\u2019s post 1992 single oriented fan fodder. Amidst it all, lay a set of well crafted, unpretentious guitar solos that complement the songs and do justice to the legacy of the classic era of the late 80s.\n\nOf course, no album out of this veteran fold would be complete without a towering collection of longwinded, labyrinth-like epics that somehow manage to find their way into familiar territory. As the aforementioned 2006 predecessor, over half of the songs on here break the 8 minute barrier. Unlike said album, these songs flow a little less gradually and almost remind of the band\u2019s Bayley era epics, at times shifting abruptly but remaining constant for the most part. The winners in this bunch are \u201cStarblind\u201d and \u201cThe Man Who Would be King\u201d, as they tend to mix things up a bit more and hearken a little closer to the space-like nature that the album is going for. Some of the other ones get a tiny bit convoluted, but for the most part the rest of the album is consistent in pursuing new territory while just keeping enough of Maiden\u2019s signature character in place to keep from losing the audience.\n\nThey say that long careers are marked by ebbs and flows, and as of the past 10 years, Iron Maiden has been in a pretty steady current with few boulders blocking the path. In light of this, one should approach \u201cThe Final Frontier\u201d as a part of the current era of the band, though there is a casual familiarity with the 1986-88 era of the band that doesn\u2019t really come up on the previous albums, save perhaps a few songs on \u201cBrave New World\u201d. It\u2019s only slightly below its predecessor in terms of sheer magnificence, and it is definitely a must have for Maiden fans who aren\u2019t hopelessly longing for a complete return to the pre-1990 sound of the band. It may not be the final frontier in terms of their legacy, but if this band were to bow out at this point, this would be a worthy exit.\n",
        "\nIron Maiden has gone through plenty of changes over the years, including line-up, music, and even with Eddie, their mascot. Well, here we have The Final Frontier, which finds Iron Maiden sort of reinventing themselves a little more again, and this time being a little more dconfusing with the lyrical content and even the music. The most dramatic leap is the band's interest in a more astral appearance, which has also affecvted Eddie and turned him into more of a rendition of the beast a fan would come up with after watching a film like Alien. But why, when much of the album is still rooted in the more fantastical lyrical style that fans of the band have come to expect? As Iron Maiden continues, it appears they are starting to run out of ideas, and that's evident with this more experimental release called The Final Frontier.\n\nThe Final Frontier starts with a very long winded instrumental introduction to the song \"Satellite 15... The Final Frontier\", which doesn't do anything to set the tone of the album other then try to set up some kind of space ambience to the song which clearly has some science fiction lyrical content as compared to the rest of the album with tracks titled \"El Dorado\" and \"The Talisman\". This really is the only time there's any sort of science fiction aspect to the music, and it's clear the band just wanted to play with it, and unfortunately it simply doesn't work, leaving the song feeling drawn out before it even starts, and when the song does start, it feels so short that listener feels cheated in a sense, as the actual song itself is highly entertaining and is simply traditional Iron Maiden. This song also introduceds you yo the hollow production quality of the album.\n\nThe production quality on this album isn't quite as top notch as previous efforts have had, and it sadly does cause some problems with the final product. The main issue being the vocals. Aside the music being rather hollow sounding and lacking any bite, the vocals here just sound obnoxiously nasal to the point where it sometimes sounds off key with the music. A perfect example would be the track \"Isle of Avalon\", which has a bridge near the end that sounds horribly sung, and at times even mumbled as the song comes to it's close. But the lack of power in the vocals isn't the only thing missing, as it's really vacant in many of the songs here in general. There are tracks on this release where the band just doesn't really seem to put much effort into it, like \"Starblind\". Sure, this track is clearly meant to be a little more open and lighter musically, but it honestly just sounds like there's no drive. The amospheric keyboard moments to the song's chorus sound great, and the guitar solo is ok, but the rest of the track flows at a very slow, mechanical pace that it becomes the definition of a filler song.\n\nBut, the album does have some strongh points to it. Outside the extended introduction, \"Satellite 15... The Final Frontier\" is a catchy song that brings things back to the glory days of Iron Maiden, and any fan will simply eat up the actual music of the song. Outside that, there's the single \"El Dorado\", which isn't one of the strongest tracks on the album at first, but the more you listen to it, the more there is to enjoy about it's signature NWOBHM sound. The song also doesn't get old after a little while like some of the other tracks on The Final Frontier, and features enough solid musicianship to keep the listener attentive the whole time. The same can be said for \"The Talisman\", which is actually a rather brave track for this album. The song starts up as an acoustic folk song for more then two minutes, being sung very low and really gets you in a relaxed state of mine for the lyrical content of the song. The rest of the song, however, is just a straight forward Heavy Metal track with solid music right from the start, and a decent faster pace that doesn't cause everything to sound robotic. The ending does seem a bit extended, but it still woreks well with the song in the long run and is still enjoyable, even if you don't really want to sit through it.\n\nMission Edition:\nWith what can only be explained as the sheer length of the album, none of the bonus material that comes with the Mission Edition of this release is actually on the disc. On the back of the case is a link to go to on the band's official website, which requires you to put the Mission Edition CD into your computer's CD player to be validated through their site to gain access to the additional materials. Of these materials, you get the two music videos for the song \"The Final Frontier\", the original version sent out, and a director's cut, both in standard definition no less, as well as a photo gallery, a couple wallpapers that are mostly stills from the music video to \"The Final Frontier\" and , and a bonus game to play that is essentially just a slightly more complex version of Asteroids you play in your web browser while the album plays in the background in a horrible low quality. These bonus features wind up leaving a good amount to be desired, especially since you technically bought them but don't actually own them, with only the pictures really being able to be saved and kept as your own. Outside that, the Mission Edition also has different packaging, and it's really nothing too special, as it's supposed to be the window of a space ship with the artwork in the window. The case itself is of a nice lighter metal or tin, but the track listing is simply stickered to the back of the case and looks horrible, while the inside iss simply the art book loose with the center cradling the CD.\n\nIn the end, The Final Frontier is nothing special at all. It has it's stronger moments when the music is a little faster, but for the most part the album just sounds rather mechanical and drags along with plenty of moments where the music feels drug out, or just uninspired. The main argument is who it would be to blame, as the band does manage to pull off some solid performances here, but then there are tracks that you would expect to be great, but sound horrible due to the production quality, so it winds up being a double assault working against the album. When you break it down, it's clear that this was something more geared towards a Bruce Dickinson solo type album, while the band clearly looked at composing a more Blaze Bayley-era Iron Maiden in appearance, and sometimes in the sound. Of course, this is still an iron Maiden album, so sampling it would be wise to hear the few worthy tracks on here, but outside those mentioned in the review, it honestly is nothing too special, and the Mission Edition is simply just not even worth the extra few US dollars to have in your collection, unless you just want something for bragging rights, or like awkward things protruding from your CDs. \n\nOriginally composed for Apoch's Metal Review\nwww.apochs.net\n",
        "\nMy first impressions of the latest Iron Maiden album en route were unabashedly positive. I'm a bit of a sci-fi nutter, so to see the band returning to this theme was a thrill. The big cover art reveal, the obvious amount of work placed in the cheesy if wonderful launch video, and the fact that the band were reportedly returning to the values that dominated classics like Somewhere in Time or Powerslave. Alas, once hearing a few of the early preview tracks for the record, my expectations started to dim. Like A Matter of Life and Death or Dance of Death before it, it seemed this album was long on loyalty to the band's trademark sound, and another top notch production, but might once again fail to deliver the extremely catchy mementos of years past, from about 1980-1988 when this band ruled the world across all its shores and could not be stopped in the studio.\n\nTo be fair, The Final Frontier is in no way a bad or negative album, at least no further than the fact it just doesn't live up to my hopes of one day hearing this band produce an 80s level masterpiece before they fall to arthritis, old age or whatever inevitable horror awaits these brave, tireless men as they parade across stages decades beyond when most bands have cashed in their chips and retired. The boys embrace the far off concepts of their lyrics just as they once did, skirting across both the unknown and historical significance of events past, present and future with the best of intentions. The drawback is simply a failure to deliver on all the fronts necessary to ingrain this music deep into the memory. There are some fairly good stabs at the light here, and the individual musicians are in fine form, in particular Bruce Dickinson. You know what to expect from this man by now, and he does not let you down, offering another of his balanced performances, but the melodies simply do not rise above the din of recent year releases, and the album is ultimately rationed out between the quality of the last two.\n\n\"Satellite 15...The Final Frontier\" is certainly a tempting intro to the record, opening with a Hawkwind like space rock ministration of guitar feedback and steel wrought NWOBHM chords over pulsing, disappearing synthesizer lines, slowly developing into a melodic charge. It's a fine set-up for the record, but doesn't really capitalize with anything catchy, just an urgent build towards the latter, \"Final Frontier\" half of the track, a pretty standard melodic rocker without an enormously catchy chorus. \"El Dorado\" follows in a cloud of Nicko mangling his kit alongside some throwaway guitar noise, before the click and the triplets arrive for another pretty average chord selection that brings to bear the good old feel of a band like Saxon. Once again, though, the big surprise melody never arrives to catapult the song beyond its steady clime. The guitars sound huge, and Bruce is positively diabolic with his sneer, but when he explodes into the higher register, there's just no memorable line to connect the synapses to the steel.\n\n\"Mother of Mercy\" sounds like any random song from the last album, using some clean guitars and bluesy melodic spikes in the intro, while a calm Dickinson steers the band towards a raging, mid-paced trot. The chorus is yet again lackluster; though the first repetition of the title's track might seem like its going to deliver. \"Coming Home\" fares slightly better than the previous songs due to the warmth of the descending guitar melody, the flow of Harris' chords, but the rest of the song is sub-standard, with little interesting transpiring outside of that opening guitar line. \"The Alchemist\" (not the same as the Bruce Dickinson solo track) is one of the better pieces here, a classic Maiden rocker reminiscent of \"Be Quick or Be Dead\" with a pretty if basic melody in the chorus. Yet, even this is far from the band at their best, and its merely a standout among so many other, drab colors on this canvas.\n\nThe latter half of the record sees Maiden lurch into 'epic mode', with the shortest track here being nearly 8 minutes in length. You can hear a few glints of \"Rhyme of the Ancient Mariner\" influence in \"Isle of Avalon\", and the extensive clean guitars cede well into the more progressive, jamming segments, but its ultimately incoherent and soon forgotten. \"Starblind\" has grown on me slightly in a few listens, a desperately melodic track with semi-inspirational leads and some of the better lyrics on The Final Frontier. Easily one of the best new tracks for 2010, but still not delivering the nuclear payload I anticipated. \"The Talisman\" features about 2-3 minutes of raging awesome against 9 minutes of planning, and \"The Man Who Would Be King\" has some brush strokes of brilliance amidst its roiling, endless sea of painted momentum, but the bloated finale \"When the Wild Wind Blows\" delivers nothing beyond an average series of vocal melodies which sound very familiar to the last three records.\n\nThe Final Frontier is not an unpleasant experience to sit through, and certainly superior to anything the band released in the Blaze years, or Dance of Death, but I can't claim its on par with the band's one truly enjoyable post-reunion record, Brave New World, because there are just no loaded, emotionally charged singles like a \"Wicker Man\". This is a case of fine ideas, and the band's typically high class production standards colliding with composition that is merely average. The songs never capitalize on their strengths, the chords lapse into unconsciousness, and you really hope this is not the band's 'final frontier', because there must be something deep inside their spirits that we still need to hear, a muse that has not yet been satisfied. Considering how much value this band has offered me through the years (into the early 90s), the least I can do is cross my fingers and hope for the best next time, and probably the next after that. This time, we've been rationed out a passable effort, neither repugnant nor inspirational, but there in lies the quandary. 'Passable' and 'average' should not be acceptable outcomes for an Iron Maiden record. They never have been. They never will be.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nI've got to say that prior to the release of this album I played through the last three albums a few times. Particularly BNW and AMOLAD were my long time favourites, and I really doubted that they could top the last one.\n\nWhen El Dorado got released, it has gradually grown on me, as to be one of my favourite tracks from Maiden. The same goes to the title song, even though I was a bit surprised that the opener was not a fast one like usual. And then the album came.\n\nI've got to say it - wow! I'm pretty impressed with how it turned out. After hearing the 30-second snippets I thought that it will be quite interesting, but rather slow and calm, but spacey and proggy. It turned out that it is spacey and pushing their prog direction to the limit, but far from being calm. The tracks are long, but one can barely notice this - after hearing the last track I was surprised how quick those 11 minutes past - not a moment of boredom!\n\nOne of the most impressive things about this record is the multitexturing of the sound, that was barely hereable on previous records. Instead of just repeating the same riffs on all three guitars, one can often hear those small nuances that add so much to the song. And they often reveal themselves only after numerous listenings.\n\nAt times, this album does not sound like Maiden at all, not mentioning the intro, that is something completely different to their previous work. Not only that, some songs have a really weird feeling, and only the occasional twin leads and bass gallop remind who are we listening to. Also, except for the title track, the band has abandoned the formula of writing simple choruses and repeating them ad infinitum. Here, they are complex and at times it's hard to discern which part is really the chorus, maybe because the band has often omitted the standard bridge/chorus/solo/chorus structure and let the songs live, twist and turn on their own. This album never sounds forced, instead it's brimming with creativity and fresh ideas. I also deeply enjoy the fact that Adrian 'H' Smith was involved in writing almost all of the tracks on the album. His brilliant ideas, as well as riffs and solos really shine here. Also, Bruce sounds really convincing here, and so do the lyrics. Overall, the whole bands perform flawlessly, but it's really the Smith-Harris-Dickinson trio that really turns this one into an instant classic.\n\nThis album came almost from nowhere, with little information coming from the band, and it turned out to be one of the greatest surprises coming from Iron Maiden. A peak of their proggy influences, resulting in one of the, if not the strongest effor yet. Highly recommended.\n\nThe highlights? The paganic Isle of Avalon, the cosmic Starblind, the adventurous The Talisman and of course, one of the best ballads since Bruce's 'Tears of the Dragon' - Coming Home.\n\n(Originally written for the Wrecking Crew forum.)\n",
        "\nWell, the time has come, everybody. The new Iron Maiden album is almost here. I haven\u2019t heard it yet, but I\u2019m going to pick it up tomorrow morning (and it might well be that time by the time this review is accepted), and while I wait, I figure I\u2019ll go back and review one of my very first Maiden albums ever, The Number of the Beast. Yes, I remember being a wee 15 year old kid and going into Best Buy and looking at this album like it was a golden nugget. I didn\u2019t know much about heavy metal then, except that Iron Maiden was a cool band, with cool cover art and rebellious, rousing lyrics and energetic guitars oozing out of every pore. I mean\u2026just look at the cover art. 25 years later and it\u2019s still an icon of rock music at large. How can you beat that lovably dead miscreant Eddie pulling the Devil himself around on puppet strings? Eddie is better than the Devil, so Iron Maiden is better than the Devil. That\u2019s just awesome. You parents think the Devil is what you need to worry about? Hell naw, it\u2019s Maiden.\n\nAnd the music, kicking off with the high-energy gallop \u201cInvaders,\u201d showed what Maiden was all about. Previously they had been a down n\u2019 dirty punk influenced act with that hunk of armpit hair, Paul Dianno, on vocals, but this one showed the arrival of our great Air Raid Siren himself, Bruce Dickinson, who handles these songs with an expert feel and a comfortable segue between the aggressive snarls of the verses and the maniacal, melodious howls of the chorus. Could Dianno have managed this much versatility, this much power for a song this dynamic? Well, it\u2019s a good song either way, and better than people will tell you. I\u2019ve always had a soft spot for it.\n\nBut they really kick up the game with the following \u201cChildren of the Damned,\u201d a much more calculated and sinister track\u2026listen to the way it switches from that dark, swirling stomp to the fiery, hell-crazed conclusion. It\u2019s a great build up, and one of metal\u2019s real classic ballads. This is pretty much the first true example of why Iron Maiden worked in the 80s; it\u2019s just such a charismatic tune. Maiden were not only a great band because they had a hell of an instrumental base, electrically fueled with storming riffs, rollicking bass and energetic, skin pounding drums, fronted by a singer who could really sell their songs, but also because of their charisma and style. The songwriting was endowed with poppish hooks here and there, but only as a ruse to reveal the absolutely astronomical metallic prowess hidden beneath. On \u201cChildren of the Damned,\u201d we get a band exploring a new style with balls, conviction and a melodic sensibility that would only improve over the years.\n\nWhy was Maiden so great? Above all it was the attitude, the unmistakable style that made them a household name. You could recognize a Maiden song in three seconds flat. Like \u201cThe Prisoner,\u201d with its jettisoning leads and monstrous beats from the drums. And just listen to Bruce\u2019s wailing of every vocal line as if it\u2019s going to be the last he ever sings\u2026pure classic stuff! He sells these songs like a Thespian of sorts, becoming completely enveloped in them. The title track is another perfect example of this. That foreboding guitar flare that starts us off, the corking, boiling riffs and melodies\u2026it\u2019s all there, with Bruce rasping and bellowing and really becoming the man on the run from the devil in the woods that the lyrics spin the tale of. It is this kind of theatrical posing that metal was built on from the start \u2013 bigger, flashier, more grandiose. Subtlety? What\u2019s that? That\u2019s not the aim here!\n\n\u201c22 Acacia Avenue\u201d and \u201cGangland\u201d hearken back to the band\u2019s past as a streetwise bunch of young punks, and the former works pretty well, with heavy, hook-fisted riffs and a domineering vocal performance making it into a stylish, aggressive take on the whole Charlotte the Harlot \u2018saga,\u2019 but the latter is pretty dire. It\u2019s not a horrible song or anything, but it\u2019s just kind of unimpressive, and doesn\u2019t really inspire me to run down the street with a torch of white flames like some of the other songs on here do. It\u2019s a very pedestrian track, with an average and very rockish riff, a somewhat rushed vocal motif and a chorus that isn\u2019t so much powerful as\u2026well, slightly annoying. The vitriolic verses are pretty good though.\n\n\u201cTotal Eclipse\u201d is another one I just don\u2019t like as much, as while it is undoubtedly experimental and different\u2026it\u2019s too different for this album. It sounds like something you would have heard about five years earlier on a Uriah Heep album or something; not a Maiden album in 1982. The riff is pretty simple, and the whole structure of the song, with the more somber mood and the slower, laid back tempo, just sounds completely alien with the rest of the album\u2019s blazing dual leads and frenetic rhythms. And I like Uriah Heep and other 70s rock bands, don\u2019t get me wrong. It\u2019s just that \u201cTotal Eclipse\u201d is not a particularly inspiring or well done song for that type. Again, it\u2019s not horrible or anything, just not that great like the better songs on here.\n\nEnough has already been said about \u201cRun to the Hills,\u201d which is an all time classic with its ultra-catchy drum intro, the syncopated verses and the explosive, streamlined and layered chorus, which is criminally infectious \u2013 really; the band received lawsuits for how catchy this song is. If you don\u2019t believe me look it up! You might not find anything, but at least you did something more interesting than reading reviews on this website all day long. \u201cHallowed Be Thy Name,\u201d too, has been talked about to death, and I don\u2019t have much to add. With its spine tingling build up, those first whispered lyrics and the explosive, careening metal storm that follows, Maiden created a classic for the ages. The vocals from Bruce belt out some of metal\u2019s best and most iconic lyrics, and the riffs escalate into a platitude of classic metal glory that is still a monument to hear. It\u2019s just great, and anyone who denies it is a fool.\n\nThe Number of the Beast is a historical landmark, as it is where Iron Maiden first started on the path that would lead them to worldwide stardom, but it is a fucking great album all the way, too. It\u2019s simple, it\u2019s poppier than the previous albums, but it\u2019s a well written, tight collection of songs from a band bursting with youthful fire. Maiden on here showed the first signs of their expertise at crafting memorable, hook-laden and commercially successful work, and it\u2019s a testament to exactly how good writers they were that these songs are still so universally memorable and loved. This isn\u2019t Maiden\u2019s best ever, but it\u2019s an easy classic and well worth listening to, as it packs some kick ass songs. Go check it out, and if it's your first time, like it was when I first heard this, the experience will never be replicated again. Savor this one.\n",
        "\nAlmost too weird to be true: there's actually people who claim they like Metal, but don't like Iron Maiden. To me, that sounds like being into swimming, but not liking water. If you are a Metal fan and don't like Maiden - I'm sorry to say so - I think you'd be better off not breathing. However, if your only referential point is this album's direct predecessor, the horribly bland and uninspired 'A Matter Of Life And Death', I can understand a certain aversion to the British Metal legend. There was only one song I could thoroughly enjoy on that album (closing track 'The Legacy'), so my hopes for 'The Final Frontier' weren't all that high.\n\nLuckily, the first thing released off of this album was the awesome track 'El Dorado', a song in typical Maiden fashion. That means that the gallop that 'A Matter Of Life And Death' was so obviously lacking is back in full strength, Bruce Dickinson is blazing (no pun intended) vocally and the song is energetic, lively and vibrant. Something which goes for all of 'The Final Frontier' actually.\n\nMusically, the album follows the same quasi-progressive route that Maiden has followed since reuniting with Dickinson and Adrian Smith. So that means that there are many long songs, a couple of shorter, catchier ones to round the album out. The biggest difference with the previous album, however, is that many of the long songs actually make sense. 'The Talisman', with its nine minutes of length, is one of the longest songs on the album, but isn't a second too long. It starts out with two minutes of celtic influenced acoustic guitars (obviously Janick Gers' input, who might be my least favorite guitarist in the band, but I'm still glad he's in the band, as he brings a lot of brilliant ideas to the table), after which it turns into a brilliant, galloping, melodic Metal tune like only Iron Maiden can do them. That little melodic lead after every chorus sent chills down my spine I haven't felt with any new material since 'Rainmaker' and 'Journeyman' seven years ago.\n\nOkay, so this album is not perfect. But then again... Is there really anyone who expected the veterans to go back to the glory days of 'Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son' or 'Piece Of Mind'? Some songs lack the memorability almost any older Maiden song has. 'Coming Home', 'Isle Of Avalon' and 'Starblind' don't stick to my mind as easily as most of the classic stuff, although the latter has a brilliant riff that carries the song and all three songs are quite good. In fact, the only song I can hardly listen to is the 11 minute closing track 'When The Wild Wind Blows', which to these ears is only saved from the scrap heap by a number of killer guitar solos.\n\n'Satellite 15... The Final Frontier' is a great way to start the album. It's actually two separate songs, with 'Satellite 15' being a pleasantly surprising dramatic intro - sounding relatively futuristic, compositionally as well as sonically - and the title track being your typical catchy Iron Maiden single. And I mean that as positive as it can get. The song really wets your appetite for the rest of the album.\n\nSomething I immediately noticed about the album is that its general tempo is remarkably higher than on 'A Matter Of Life And Death'. There's more variation in the tempos as well. And isn't that what made songs like 'Infinite Dreams' so irresistable in the first place? But even when the band slows down a bit, they've given their songs a more colorful finish than on the last album. 'Mother Of Mercy', for instance, doesn't exceed the midtempo range, but its brooding structure, atmospheric riffs and powerful chorus make it a delight for any fan of old school Heavy Metal. In deed, Black Sabbath came to mind, although it doesn't directly sound like them.\n\nOther highlights include the uptempo stomper 'The Alchemist', which shows that Iron Maiden still reigns supreme over any Power Metal band attempting to do the same thing, and Dave Murray's 'The Man Who Would Be King', which sounds more like a multi-part suite than anything else really. The latter contains a couple of brilliant twin guitar melodies and a truly beautiful chorus. The aforementioned 'El Dorado' is a fantastic treat as well, but 'The Talisman' really takes the cake. That is the one song that sums up what makes this band so great in the first place.\n\nAs for the individual performances, some of them are nothing short of spectacular. Bruce Dickinson's vocals sound much more motivated and convincing than on 'A Matter Of Life And Death' and all of the instrumentalists still seem to be evolving, although being well in their fifties. Nicko McBrain's drumming never ceases to amaze me with little subtleties and all of the three guitarists are stellar in both the riff and solo department. On 'The Final Frontier', Maiden utilized the luxury of having three axemen better than ever and that brings out brilliant harmonies as well as impressive personal achievements. 'Starblind' contains a little semi-clean guitar fill which I would have sworn was Dave Murray's, but it's coming from the speaker where most of Janick Gers' stuff comes from.\n\nIt's truly a blessing that bands like Iron Maiden can still come up with an album this good so far into their carreers. Sure, it's not perfect, but 'The Final Frontier' shows that Iron Maiden still has the right to be alive in 2010. Purchase if you like... Metal in general actually!\n",
        "\nAfter a string of seven albums often regarded to be masterpieces, Iron Maiden released their eighth album, \u201cNo Prayer for the Dying,\u201d and ever since it has received mostly negative to lukewarm reviews. To me, the oddest part is the conditions of the complaints. While most bands generally get a lot of shit from the metal fan base for changing their style, Iron Maiden receives mostly praise for changing their style throughout the past seven albums, and instead the fans were disappointed in this, a release that sounds almost like Maiden pushed a musical reset button and attempted to go back to square one. So, why is this album often considered to be the beginning of what would be a four string of albums considered to be Maiden\u2019s low point?\n\nI think the first complaint many people would make would be Bruce\u2019s vocals. He has a raspier voice and isn\u2019t hitting the high notes like he used to. There were times he\u2019d do this on \u201cSeventh Son,\u201d but it\u2019s much more prevalent here. The production is often brought up, as it is somewhat back to the roots and straightforward itself.\n\nAnother reason may be that several of the songs seem to be rehashes of old ideas. I\u2019ve always referred to \u201cTailgunner\u201d as the song that wishes it was \u201cAces High.\u201d \u201cPublic Enema Number One\u201d features some of those dual harmonies Maiden is known for and some classic sounding riffing, but the song just doesn\u2019t stick with you like the classics. After a melodic intro, we get a classic gallop bass riff from Steve Harris on \u201cFate\u2019s Warning.\u201d But the bass almost seems more interesting than the guitar riff. \u201cThe Assassin\u201d is an attempt to write a bit of a darker, more menacing song, feeling a bit like a Seventh Son reject, guitars replacing synth, but just never living up to the greatness of Seventh Son.\n\nOn the other hand, some songs sound more like a classic rock song than a Maiden tune. \u201cHoly Smoke\u201d has been compared to AC/DC and that sounds pretty accurate, and \u201cHooks in You\u201d has a similar feel. The intro guitar riff to \u201cNo Prayer\u201d feels almost as if you could sing \u201cIf there\u2019s a bustle in your hedgerow\u201d right along with it. \u201cBring Your Daughter\u2026 To the Slaughter,\u201d the most successful song on the album, has a somewhat dark atmospheric verse, with a classic rock-ish, and very catchy chorus, with a climax of Bruce chanting \u201cBring me your daughter, bring me your daughter\u2026\u201d\n\nAnother odd thing about this album is it\u2019s the only one not to feature one of Maiden\u2019s epic songs. Besides Killers, every maiden album up to this point (and every one after) had that epic feeling 7 minute or longer song (Some more than one), though \u201cProdigal Son\u201d can be considered the epic for that one. The closest this album offers us is \u201cMother Russia,\u201d the only song breaking 5 minutes, though it feels rather epic compared to the rest of the album.\n\nSo all in all it seems that the problem with this album is, for the most part, the fact that it\u2019s a very average album released by a band the fans hold a higher standard to. Everything about this album is average. The song writing, Bruce\u2019s new, raspier singing style, much of the instrumental work, and especially the lyrics, are all decent enough to make a listenable album, but all pale in comparison to the things maiden had accomplished in the past. It feels like they went from attempting to make progressive music, to wanting to make safe music. It\u2019s not that this album is particularly bad. It\u2019s just particularly forgettable. And at least you remember a bad album.\n",
        "\nFiller be damned, but even the mightiest get caught up with such deception. Fear Of The Dark could have been a well-thought out follow-up to the mundane No Prayer For The Dying, even though it still wouldn\u2019t live up to the previous \u201880s flock. That\u2019s a hard family to stick with because heavy metal calls upon them like superheroes. For the \u201890s flock, Maiden sort of crept under the radar instead of going out with a blaze (uh oh) of fury, but Fear Of The Dark proves that the band at least attempted to bring back some of that glory. At heart, the band still had it in them, but it was one wasted bullet that turned into a wasted album.\n\nUnlike No Prayer For The Dying, some good songs shine on amidst the clutter of bad ones. The bar has been raised a centimeter, thankfully, but we\u2019re still a far ways away from \u201cCaught Somewhere In Time\u201d or \u201cDie With Your Boots On,\u201d which is an understandable disappointment. More or less, I was expecting another offering in the same ballpark as No Prayer For The Dying, and new listeners should expect the same to save themselves from utter dismay. The main difference is that when throwing this album in the garbage, there\u2019s a hint of legacy \u2013 you can take something away from this that you can look back on and cherish. For me, it was the title track, though for you it\u2019ll probably be something else as well.\n\nProduction wise the band sticks to the dry, stock job that excels in mixing and then-modern power, but lacks certain character and style. This can become a love / hate deal between listeners since such production benefits the instruments but detracts from the music in certain ways (atmosphere, for instance). I\u2019d expect the band to notice this and create what they can using the trademark Maiden ambition, but instead they opt to go for flaccid heavy metal (read: rock) tunes that make up the majority of this album. Some of them pass the mark for a number of reasons \u2013 amusement, energy, harmonies, riffs, vocals (advice: pick one) \u2013 but this album is basically a bunch of copper and a piece of gold in a cove of shit.\n\nYou get the Beavis & Butthead-lambasted \u201cFrom Here To Eternity\u201d (a poppy hard rock jingle), the harmony-driven brooder \u201cAfraid To Shoot Strangers,\u201d the grim \u201cChildhood\u2019s End,\u201d the poignant \u201cWasting Love,\u201d and the epic monster of a title track to seal the deal. These tracks to me make up the true spirit of Fear Of The Dark; everything else gets in the way with their suckage. This makes five good tracks scattered with seven mediocre-to-lame tracks in a whopping kiddy pool of twelve tracks, which is not the kind of album anyone wants to be stuck in. Between these tracks, Steve Harris is able to make one last stand; it\u2019s a desperate attempt and the organization isn\u2019t better than No Prayer For The Dying, but it serves as a ray of hope for the rest of the band to follow suit. Like the previous album, there are bits and pieces \u2013 riffs, verses, solos, etc. \u2013 that reside in fractured songs\u2026 songs that are butchered by the band in more than one way.\n\nFirst up is Dickinson, who by this point I\u2019m assuming gave less than a shit. We all know his vocals \u2013 those well-known wails burned like stomach fuel and launched like a rainbow in the dark \u2013 yet only one track really nails it down. This would be the title track, where Dickinson lurches during the calm intro and initiates tremendous howls of fervent emotion as the song progresses. With \u201cWasting Love\u201d (for this album) I can bear to hear his soft croons as he delicately cries and moans passionately; each line of the verse is met with flurrying acoustics before the excitement overcomes the listener. Both these songs mark the high points of the album, with the title track being the fluctuated opus penned by an incredibly melodious main riff while the latter serves as the ballad (at most) to show us what the band really wanted.\n\nHardly any other of the tracks I chose are as impactful as those two aforementioned songs, and the tracks I haven\u2019t mentioned (the ones I\u2019d rather feed to sharks) are too disjointed or flat-out pathetic to live up to the Maiden name. To me, the band got very lazy and decided to keep piling on one song after the other without actually fleshing any of them out. None of the other tracks are worthy because they aren\u2019t very developed \u2013 for some shitty band, sure, but by Maiden\u2019s standards this is a mess. The band shouldn\u2019t have to be held to their greatest potential all the time, but there should always be a fine line to keep them from producing mediocre or lifeless songs. I\u2019m trying to get my head around Nicko\u2019s drum beats, which remain the only piece not completely overwhelmed by the same shallowness as the rest of the band. The guy is a comedian at heart, and the same thin hat tatters filled by buoyant snares are the route he goes to keep his kit afloat; the drum bass is still a bunch of dead fish being clubbed, though.\n\nFor the rest of the album, listeners have to defend themselves against wasted vocals, incredibly dumb lyrics, some annoying choruses, lackluster riffs, shallow harmonies, inert solos, and shadowy bass lines. Now this is spread out across seven boring, studio filler tracks that you need to put up with unless you burned your own copy with a shorter tracklist (which would be wiser than buying this if you really need a physical copy). Harris usually manages to emulate the guitar harmonies on his sovereign bass with his own licks, but here he mostly follows in their footsteps. Therefore, you\u2019ll get everything mundane played both by guitars and by a blubbery bass, which is still nice in an \u201cevery Iron Maiden fan loves Steve Harris like a father\u201d kind of way. \n\nFor the guitar duo, I\u2019m not hearing a whole lot of commitment, either; it\u2019s the kind of thing a metalhead can just tune in and notice. On the chosen tracks they mean what they play, but everything else is taken up for the sake of existence \u2013 alive, but just breathing. I wouldn\u2019t back anything that isn\u2019t meant to last, and that\u2019s where the majority of Fear Of The Dark disagrees. The precise, consistent flare of the guitar tone is mostly wasted on shallow rock tunes with immobile choruses that bailed on the listener within the first lines of their shameful lyrics. Aggressiveness, class, caution, fervor, and the Maiden style show up too few and dispersed, with even fewer moments of true glory; the band gives us a lot, but unleashes very little \u2013 we get quantity over quality.\n\nI figured this had to be better than the previous album and in the end it still seems that way. What good that came from Fear Of The Dark outdoes what good came from No Prayer For The Dying; they both are still pretty bad, though. Pick either one that\u2019s mediocre and bad as a whole or one with crap interspersed with some good, but you\u2019re still digging in the wrong pool. Yes, this is the kiddy section \u2013 you want the big kid\u2019s pool, which consists of classics like Piece Of Mind, Killers, and Somewhere In Time, among others. Every decade has its own pool, and this \u201890s kiddy pool still has some crap that needs to be eradicated.\n",
        "\nThe \u201880s were a great time to be a fan of heavy metal and definitely a perfect time to be an Iron Maiden fan. From Killers on up to Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son, fans were given albums ranging from good to genre masterpieces. Hell, the happiest people must have been the Maiden guys themselves, as they were pretty much on top of the world by the time Somewhere In Time became part of human history. Eclectic leads and riffs, jovial bass rhythm, usually upbeat songs, and vocals that aligned with the epic nature of the music towered above the heavy metal spectrum \u2013 Iron Maiden were the shit. Now fast forward to\u2026 now, and I\u2019m stuck in a rut with Maiden\u2019s No Prayer For The Dying, an album I knew would be a step down from the previous releases. \n\nNow at the core it\u2019s still Maiden, but the idea of starting anew sort of got to the band\u2019s head in the wrong way. While each album has an engaging theme stuck to it like rubber glue, this one ends up with Elmer\u2019s Glue, already making it a dull affair. The band doesn\u2019t really go above and beyond like they did with most of their albums by that point, and while this isn\u2019t a necessity, it does show the band getting a bit lazy ahead of their game. On laziness, Dickinson is the wailing ace no higher and more up-close than before; he\u2019s had some fair performances before, but most of these tracks show us just how annoying his voice can get. Make way for out-of-touch (\u201cRun Silent Run Deep\u201d and \u201cThe Assassin\u201d), overly-loud (the title track and \u201cThe Assassin\u201d), wide shouting (\u201cBring Your Daughter\u2026 To The Slaughter\u201d and \u201cThe Assassin\u201d) before you get to hear the skillful eruption of stomach power manipulated into sympathetic singing and howling.\n\nThe first to get hit is the production; starting over shouldn\u2019t always mean going for a straightforward sound again. No more profound, ethereal atmosphere or sonic soundscapes jolting like active particles in the air. No Prayer For The Dying goes for a cross between Powerslave (loosely) and Piece Of Mind (yeah, not much of that old school vibe), which is killer in theory but executed with the desire for mediocrity. While sensibly dissimilar to the debut album (the direction the band wanted to go back to, if I remember correctly), the dreariness of that particular album is reflected onto this one. However, the disjointed tracklist of the self-titled debut is cleansed in favor of a dry, level playing field; no track on No Prayer For The Dying truly trumps another. At the highest we get good tracks and at the worst we get pitiful ones; on average, though, it\u2019s a logically stable endeavor.\n\nReferring back to the production right quick, it isn\u2019t abysmal in the sense of absolute abhorrence. Coming off the \u201880s ride, anyone will surely be disappointed. Personally, I think Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son has an infuriatingly monotonous production job, so No Prayer For The Dying falls in the crevice above it; non-echoed and neutral, yet properly mixed and obviously well-refined (money makes a big difference). For the first five varied songs (and with a lot of proper listens), I looked past these setbacks, but by the fifth track there\u2019s a huge slump (likely because \u201cThe Assassin\u201d itself is an atrocious song). The album goes from a set of only good to average tracks and then dips into an abyss of hopelessness; I could tell the band gave up with that song. The next album, Fear Of The Dark, would be chalked full of these filler, emotionless tracks, but this is the album where each one literally eats away at your intelligence.\n\nBy that point, I remember my first journey or two through this album; I remember how the band took a turn for less compelling riffs and songs altogether. Maiden still puts forth rationally fun riffs and infuses realistic songwriting to create ambitious or amusing tracks like \u201cTailgunner,\u201d \u201cHoly Smoke,\u201d the title track, \u201cFates Warning,\u201d and \u201cHooks In You.\u201d As cool as these tracks are, the bar has been lowered drastically to accommodate the passing rate. Think of it like the current American education system \u2013 students basically having to suck up to decreased passing standards across the board, or else only a few would make it out unscathed. Maiden had set the standard during the \u201880s, but one step into the \u201890s and they already failed to meet their own benchmark.\n\nThe other half of this album, made up of lackluster or annoying tracks, drags what competence was agreed upon into the depths of degradation. Some decent riffs and solos manage to subsist in scattered forms, but not enough trust is mustered to join forces with other riffs, rhythms, and vocals to create another decent track. One major disappointment comes from a lack of organization \u2013 no track wants to work with another. No Prayer For The Dying offers a bit of variety, but every song is independent of one another in a whole effect sort of way. I jump from one track to the next, but any feelings built from the last song I heard evaporates like some scared apparition. Even at the core, Steve Harris can\u2019t unify anything; his blubbery, autonomous bass lines trudge with the main rhythm or harmony of every track like a good parent looking out for their child. For this album he tries to be a shitty parent, letting his children run amok how they see fit \u2013 everyone wants a piece of their own action (yes, I know he didn\u2019t write every song).\n\nThe guitar duo switch-up, then consisting of Murray and Gers, isn\u2019t as memorable as Murray and Smith; the margin is beyond comparison. The fault is with the songs, of course, and even with this drawback the two are still able to utilize the rougher production \u2013 which doesn\u2019t exactly emphasize the crisp guitar tone \u2013 to create blasts of harmony and heavy metal temperament (or lack thereof). Once more, they never blow your mind even passively (i.e. atmospherically), but they do pull it off with candid intentions. On the battery, coworker Nicko never projects himself in front of the band, always maintaining steady beats to compliment the rest of the gang. He knows them well enough to implement a good dose of cymbal / hat tatters and cut-off snare hits in a manner that\u2019ll work around the music. Thankfully, the desiccated production does away with cold snares, although the double bass sounds like dead fish getting clobbered by a wooden club.\n\nOverall, this one is dead weight resting on Maiden\u2019s established career then and today. This is hardly a keeper, serving only as a dud looking to get laid like the previous hot streak of \u201880s albums. There are some nice songs to be heard here, but remember that just because this bears the Iron Maiden name, doesn\u2019t mean you need to check this out. Nothing here will change your outlook on the band in a more positive light than say Powerslave or something. I know that\u2019s pretty high competition to also live up to, but not every album deserves a chance. In the end, I can honestly say to skip over this one not because it flat out sucks, but because it\u2019ll steer you away from that which has truly contributed to Iron Maiden and heavy metal.\n",
        "\nWhat we have here is the legendary debut album of Iron Maiden. This album is a metal classic. This here is great quality NWOBHM with a sprinkling of 1977 era punk rock. These guys had talent right from the start and you can tell on this album. One of the extra special things about this album is that this is one of the two albums where Paul Di'Anno is singing, and he was definitely a great singer and his vocals suited the early style of Iron Maiden very well. They were a little different earlier on.\n\nThe production is a bit raw compared to most Iron Maiden albums, but the rawness fits the attitude of the songs. Everything manages to somehow sound cleaner on the more mellow songs though. Despite the rawness, the music is still your typical Iron Maiden, it's just with Paul Di'Anno singing instead of Bruce Dickinson. Paul's rough voice is fitting for the gritty atmosphere of the album, he sings a little on the raspy side. But despite Paul's rougher voice, he can still hit those high notes pretty good, and he proves it quite a few times on this album. All the instruments sound good here and Iron Maiden's classic galloping sound was already established on this album. Steve Harris was a great bassist then and you could really hear it the most on \"Running Free\". The bass is relatively audible, but it really sticks out in certain parts of certain songs, like the previously mentioned \"Running Free\". There is a definite punk influence in some of these songs. Actually, the way the guitars sound on this album is similar to a late 70's punk band called X Ray Spex. You'll find some gritty sounding guitars on this album. The drumming is also quite good, the drummer manages to mimic the guitar riffs with drum beats as best as he can, and he does it successfully. The music isn't very heavy here, but this is from 1980 so we can let that slide. This album's unique sound helped make Iron Maiden easily distinguishable from the other NWOBHM bands of the time.\n\nThere is a good variety of songs here, you've got your fast stuff, your mid paced stuff, and your slow stuff. \"Prowler\", my personal favorite \"Sanctuary\" which is about running from the police, and \"Iron Maiden\" are good examples of faster songs, \"Prowler\" has some of the catchiest riffs ever to be used in an Iron Maiden song, and is one of the heavier songs on here. The very galloping \"Running Free\" is mid paced and the lyrical content is quite rebellious. \"Remember Tomorrow\" and \"Strange World\" are slow and mellow with a melodic sound, but are still good. Paul also sings more softly on these songs. \"Charlotte The Harlot\" which appears to be a catchy song about a prostitute, the cool instrumental \"Transylvania\", and \"Phantom Of The Opera\" have a lot of changes in pace. They can be going fast and then suddenly be mellow. \"Charlotte The Harlot\" is a speedy number but has a couple of melodic breakdowns. \"Phantom Of The Opera\" is also speedy but has some creepy riffs thrown in here and there, especially in the beginning. \n\nThis is a good Iron Maiden album to start off with. If you prefer Bruce Dickinson as a singer then Paul Di'Anno may be an acquired taste. This is a different Iron Maiden after all. But I would still recommend this album for the music alone. There's a reason this is a classic. Go check it out.\n",
        "\nI bought this album when it was new because I was gullible enough to believe the hype. This album is still ridiculously overrated on Amazon.com and some of my fellow metalheads here seem to love it, but I got tired of \"A Matter of Life and Death\" and put it away after three listenings. It's on my mp3 player and the songs come up on shuffle, but they tend to get skipped. The sheer boredom I felt, and still feel, when I hear this record hasn't gone away and the widespread love for this CD still boggles my mind. \"Dance of Death\" was forgettable, but this album is flat-out boring to me, and I find it unforgivable that I can't listen to one of my top 3 all-time bands without shutting them off halfway through.\n\nIt is silly in my opinion to compare the current Iron Maiden to their heyday in the 80s and early 90s. This is a reformation of the band and needs to be treated as such, not unlike Deep Purple getitng back together in the 80s and having radically different output. That being said, I loved \"Brave New World\" and not just for the nostalgia. I thought the songs were unique and exciting and I was never bored listening to it. This album... ugh.\n\nFirst and foremost, Bruce Dickinson spends way too much time singing in his highest register and he simply cannot stay there all the time. He sounds strained and I can't believe they allowed this to go on through most of the record. The first three tracks live off Bruce's straining voice and although he doesn't necessarily sound bad, he certainly doesn't sound good. At least there are decent multi-tracked harmonies on the third track \"The Pilgrim\", and his mid range sounds awesome as usual, but layed beneath (above?) the harmonized parts, there's the high notes again and they sound strained. It also seems to me that there are simply too much singing here in general, as if the verses and choruses had been extended to match the bloated nature of most songs on \"A Matter of Life and Death\".\n\nI was going to complain about the lyrics being trite anti-war fodder, but I decided that's not fair. The lyrics are well written and very ambitious, although nothing to sing along with or get excited over. The issue I have more than anything is that I've heard these sentiments so many times (particularly in the last ten years) that it is meaningless to me. Obviously, this concept album is some sort of reaction to the Iraq/Afghan wars and the band goes into great lengths to condemn warfare in general. Fine. Bolt Thrower does it better. So does Motorhead. So did Creedence Clearwater Revival for that matter.\n\nMusically, the familiar bass gallop is ever-present, however most of the musical passages are repeated much more than they should be and rarely kick into high gear. The album plods along for the most part, and even the very nice technical break during \"The Longest Day\" just doesn't hold my attention. You can see where a lot of care was put into crafting these songs, but Iron Maiden forgot the excitement and certainly forgot when to stop playing.\n\nThe instruments are crystal clear. If you like well-produced metal and appreciate near-perfect separation of sound, then this is your album. However, I would postulate that the clarity of sound works to the detriment of Maiden's current 3-guitar attack. I rarely hear anything being done here that couldn't be achieved with two guitars, so that gimmick is wasted for the third album in a row. The only time the three guitar sound jumps out at the listener is during \"Out of the Shadows\", but of course this same effect is easily accomplished with multi-tracking. \n\nThe two singles, \"Different World\" and \"The Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg\" are an exercise in contrasts. \"Different World\" opens up the album and it is excellent, fast paced, and the 4:17 running time is just right. \"Breeg\", conversely, is a swollen tedious mess and should have been off-putting to potential buyers, but in hindsight it sums up the album well. It's the point where I completely start to lose interest in \"A Matter of Life nd Death\" that's for sure.\n\nGod is this album long. I'm forcing myself to listen to it for this review and I like it a bit more than I did before, but it's taking forever just to spin it a half dozen more times in order to properly review. 72 minutes? What for? I will hand it to Maiden for their ballsy move of playing this behemoth all the way through on their tour, but if I was a fan and didn't know beforehand I would have been pissed.\n\nDon't believe the hype on this one.\n",
        "\nThe 1980s are widely considered to be the decade of glory for Iron Maiden; seven albums of varied brilliance, the last of which, Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, was arguably the most epic and progressive. However, the arrival of the 1990s also saw a complete shift in Iron Maiden\u2019s career: Adrian Smith left, the keyboard-based atmosphere was essentially thrown out the window, and the whole epic side of the band essentially disappeared. In the midst of all these changes is No Prayer for the Dying, the first of the widely-considered \u201cdecline\u201d albums of Iron Maiden, and while such statements might be correct for the filler-happy Fear of the Dark, this here album is very solid heavy metal with three essential qualities: consistency, purpose and style. \n\nNo Prayer for the Dying is essentially a back-to-the-beginning effort from the band, having similar songwriting to the two Paul Di'Anno albums: this album is dirty and rocking, with perhaps even a slight punk influence; it\u2019s a complete reversal of the previous five albums\u2019 evolution. Such a shift in direction is highly commendable because it\u2019s what the band desired, and they followed their artistic wishes to fruition. All the signs are there: the songs are relatively similar in terms of tempo variation as well as length: there are virtually no epics in the vein of the 1980s ones; even Mother Russia is a relatively brief (5:31) song which only has the vaguest resemblance to an Iron Maiden epic. \n\nThis album combines the three virtues of traditional heavy metal with surprising talent: catchiness is balanced very well with technical prowess and aggression. The former element is reduced when comparing this to the band\u2019s earlier albums, and that\u2019s essentially what makes No Prayer for the Dying such an externally unattractive album: there are relatively few individual moments that jump to attention here; this is an album that\u2019s truly meant to be listened to as a whole. Its core is the very high quality of the guitar riffs: despite Adrian Smith\u2019s departure, Dave Murray and the newly arrived Janick Gers work wonders with their instruments. Memorably riffs can be found on essentially all tracks, but particular highlights would have to be the title track, The Assassin and the especially the unforgettable Bring Your Daughter To The Slaughter (including the superb mid-time solo). \n\nWhereas the previous decade\u2019s Iron Maiden albums relied on increasingly grandiose effects for atmosphere, No Prayer for the Dying sees a return to the dark basics that made the band great in the first place. The atmosphere is sombre and gritty, both musically and lyrically, while the impressive-as-usual artwork follows a similarly refreshing direction. One notable moment is the previously mentioned Mother Russia. Here, the guitars are used to great effect to create a strong atmosphere revolving around the theme of Russia, and the whole effort is a crowning success, despite not being an epic in the traditional sense for the band. \n\nIn the end, No Prayer for the Dying\u2019s greatest quality is its consistency. Unlike many other Iron Maiden albums, there are absolutely no abominable tracks here, not a single one which I\u2019d skip. Beginning with the \u201craw version of Aces High\u201d that is the cool Tailgunner, everything is damn solid here, including a title track which just screams Iron Maiden due to the very recognizable riffs; this might even be called the stereotypical Iron Maiden track, the impressive and memorable (if oddly titled) Public Enema Number One to the addictively catchy Hooks in You (which I kind of hated at first... it\u2019s something of a grower). \n\nNo Prayer for the Dying is Iron Maiden\u2019s most underrated album, by a pretty damn wide margin. It simply rocks, having all the qualities that make Iron Maiden great. Many of these songs should by all rights be considered Iron Maiden classics and it\u2019s a shame that they\u2019re usually overlooked. The 1990s might not have been the band\u2019s best decade, what with the terribly inconsistent Fear of the Dark (whose best tracks do however rival and even surpass this album\u2019s) and the two others, but this album certainly isn\u2019t at fault in any way. I strongly suggest this be approached with an open mind, for it\u2019s a magnificently solid Iron Maiden album. It\u2019s not their best, but is pretty much essential.\n",
        "\nThe year was 1980. The recent hippie movement is finally coming to an end with punk and heavy metal bands taking over the extreme music scene. And what a good take over it was. After over a decade rule of the dead-beat hippies, bands like Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, and Black Sabbath (among others) were just making their debut\u2019s which would change the world of music forever. This was Iron Maiden\u2019s first mass produced material of their career, and it\u2019s obvious that it is. Both songs on the EP take huge influences from 70\u2019s rock.\n\nI like Burning Ambition more than Running Free. The song has a kind of sound, and melody that mixes dance, rock, and metal to create one awesome hybrid song. I know it might sound like an odd thing to say for an Iron Maiden song, but this song is a great song to dance to. It has that uplifting, groovy, melody with a slight hint of aggressiveness. Burning Ambition is also the best I have heard Paul Di\u2019Anno\u2019s voice. On Iron Maiden\u2019s self titled album his voice is much grittier than on this song. On Burning Ambition his voice has a much cleaner sound to it, so much so that it is very close to Bruce Dickinson\u2019s voice, which may be the reason I like the song so much. Either way, it\u2019s a shame this song never made on the self-titled album, and never heard again as far as I know. It surely out-shines many of the other songs of the days of early Iron Maiden. In fact, I would support the purchase of this release just for this song. It\u2019s definitely a very unique sounding release, far different from Iron Maiden\u2019s other material. Of course it\u2019s different in a good way.\n\nI enjoy Running Free very much as well. This song has extreme rock influences on it, but is nevertheless the true essence of Iron Maiden\u2019s early days. And I could think of no better fitting title for this song than Running Free, because the song makes me feel like I\u2019m young again and brings me back to the time that I could run free. In my opinion it is also the only song of the self-titled album to be named a \u2018single\u2019. It\u2019s not the best song from Iron Maiden, but it\u2019s the perfect song to compliment Burning Ambition, even though this song was supposed to be the face of this release.\n\nAs the other reviews say, this is definitely a great piece of Iron Maiden history. With the first sighting of Eddie on the cover, Burning Ambition that only showed up once, and the second ever Iron Maiden release. So this is obviously one for extreme Iron Maiden fans, and not someone just becoming familiar with their material.\n",
        "\nSomewhere in Time is loved by virtually every metalhead in the world, has amazing riffs, vocals and solos and is in my opinion the best album Iron Maiden has released so far (along with Brave New World and Powerslave). This album's lineup (with Murray, Smith and Dickinson) is the one that made Iron Maiden one of the most famous heavy metal bands of all time (and in my country, by far the most famous). Given the album\u2019s fame and critical reception (even if the latter was not as great as in Powerslave), it is natural to ask me some questions before reading my review. The first and most important one is certainly \u201cwhy the hell would you review an album that every single person living on our crappy planet knows about?\u201d, and the answer is that this album means a lot to me. It was the first metal album that I owned, and it was also the one that got me into metal. \n\nAnd what an in introduction to the genre I had! The band\u2019s members were inspired as hell when they recorded this. The songwriting is very solid: there are no overused riffs or choruses and you feel the need to hold your breath for as long as a solo lasts. Dickinson was shut out of the songwriting process, since he was not extremely inspired from 1984 to 1986 (can you remember his \u201ccontributions\u201d to Powerslave?) but his vocals are even more emotional and epic than in Maiden\u2019s previous releases. Even the predictable lyrics (if you guess what Bruce sings during the chorus of \"Caught Somewhere in Time\" correctly you WILL NOT win a cookie) helps to set the atmosphere. \n\nTechnically speaking, this album is great. The guitar synthesizers and the vocals are clearly highlighted by the production, and the guitars are much heavier and more aggressive than in previous Maiden\u2019s releases, where the band played heavy metal riffs with hard rock guitars. The drums are typical 80\u2019s heavy metal drums. They are faster than usual, but apart from that detail they are just your regular Iron Maiden drums. By the way, this recording is much faster and much more technical than Maiden\u2019s previous works, and the synthesizer fits perfectly with the music, which is weird since this is Iron Maiden's first attempt at using one. It is definitely cheesy sometimes, but hey, this is a cheesy album after all. The only thing that kept me from giving 100% to this album is the lack of bass: the band focused their attention on the highs, and the production ended up taking the bass out of all the songs except Wasted Years and Sea of Madness. The bass is not inaudible or unnoticeable, but since Iron Maiden usually focuses on the bass, it is weird to see it as a secondary instrument. \n\nThe album begins with one of the most emotional songs Iron Maiden has ever recorded: \u201cCaught Somewhere in Time\u201d. The riff that introduces us to this album is powerful, slow and truly creative, but the song gets even better as the time passes. The melodies are carefully constructed, the guitar synthesizer does its job forcefully and riffs are given birth to at an alarming rate, but they aren\u2019t simply discarded: we get to see most of them appearing at least twice while the song lasts. Dickinson does an astounding performance thorough this song, and his vocals are highlighted by the (very clean) production. \u201cCaught Somewhere in Time\u201d is not only a perfect introduction to an almost flawless album but also the best possible prelude to the song that is in my opinion one of the finest (if not the finest) song that Maiden has ever delivered.\n\nThe second song, Wasted Years, is the only song in this album that doesn\u2019t use synthesizers, and\u2026 Meh. Honestly, trying to describe this song is painful for me: it is my favorite song from the album, it is my favorite song from Iron Maiden, and it is simply my favorite song ever. For real, it is probably the best song ever recorded. The riff that introduces the song is perfect; the vocals are perfect, and the solo... Will you believe me if I tell you that I actually cried when the solo met the vocals at 3:41? This song is interesting because it is both emotional and traditional, relying on an amazing solo and a powerful chorus while not needing the help of synthesizers. I am not trying to say that the use of synthesizers was a mistake in this album; I am just saying that this song proved me that Harris knew exactly where one would fit and where one wouldn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cSea of Madness\u201d is the most powerful song in the album when it starts, suddenly becomes the calmest one at 2:53, when the guitars begin doing minimal sounds and the bass becomes the focus and at 3:40 the mighty reverb of the guitars come back with more powerful and emotional riffing. The bass line (the second best of this album) makes me feel very optimistic while listening to it and the synthesizer delivers some of the cheesiest riffs I have ever seen, which is ironical, considering that this song has one of the darkest and most pessimistic lyrics that Harris has ever written.\n\n\u201cHeaven Can Wait\u201d is another song that is way too happy for its lyrics: the chorus is happy and catchy, and yet Bruce is singing about a person who died but cannot accept going to heaven because there is too much left undone on the Earth. This song is weird because it has all the elements that it needs in order to be a great song, but it feels like filler. It is actually very enjoyable and has that epic feeling that is omnipresent in this album, but the rest of the album is so great that it feels like \u201cHeaven Can Wait\u201d is simply there to increase the album\u2019s length. Thankfully, just after it is over we get to hear \u201cThe Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner\u201d, a song that suffers from weak lyrics, but overwhelms anyone with its sad lead introduction and its riffing. The melodies created here are among the most beautiful of the album (in terms of melody this song is as good as D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu and Wasted Years) and at 3:30, during the solo, there is one of the most interesting lead breakdowns that were ever written, which is followed by the climax of the song. \n\nWhile all of the other songs in this album would be rated as masterpieces by anyone who listened to them, \u201cStranger in A Strange Land\u201d is simply good, which is a terrible surprise. This is not one of the best metal songs that were ever written, and since this album is full of those I sometimes skip this song. I wouldn\u2019t be brave enough to skip this song in (almost) any other album, but since every time I put this album on the maximum volume I am suddenly surrounded by some of the best stuff that was ever written I feel that it is unnecessary to listen to the overly calm vocals and the not-so-creative bass line. The solo here is amazing, and is the only part of the song that can be compared to the rest of the album.\n\nD\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu is not only excellent, but also one of the catchiest songs that were ever written by Harris. Melodically speaking, this is one of the most beautiful and creative songs ever to exist. It starts out slowly (just like half of the album) and progresses towards awesomeness. The vocals here are the second best of the CD (unfortunately nothing beats Wasted Years) but during the chorus they are backed up by the lead guitars in a way that makes it (the chorus) my favorite one of all times.\n\nThe album is finally over with \u201cAlexander the Great\u201d, an historical masterpiece that unfortunately has an introduction that lasts for way too long. Or not: While the introduction feels long, I doubt that it would have the same effect if it was ten seconds shorter. The lyrics are weak, but the theme is great (yes, it is actually possible) and the riffing and soloing as close to perfect as music can be. \u201cAlexander the Great\u201d runs for more than eight minutes, but you will enjoy every second of it, with the possible exception of the very start (the song begins with some narration, which is backed up by wind effects).\n\nThis album should be owned by anyone that enjoys living, which doesn\u2019t exclude people who simply are not into metal at all. It is not only Iron Maiden\u2019s best work, but also one of the best works that were ever done. Each song is almost perfect, and if played from beginning to end, the album is simply amazing. I wish I could rate this 100, but I can\u2019t help but miss Harris\u2019 bass a little.\n",
        "\nPaul Di'anno Maiden was especially good an fun. Like a typhoon quality presentation, Maiden was the best band in the world in the 1980's beginning. After Paul got fired due to a heavy drug using, Maiden lost the best person in their time. Typically when new blood in the form of quality songs flourishes, legends are born.\n\nThe set is a good mix of both \"Iron Maiden\" and \"Killers\", the first two Iron Maiden albums. First four songs goes right on to deliver shockingly fast and wicked punk rock like anthems. The midway is a roller coaster of both personal agendas and guitar shredding. In the end, the band performs the most heavy classics such as the strange \"Strange World\" and the philosophical \"Twilight Zone\", which perfectly sums the night up.\n\nThis is classic rock, mixed somewhere between pure rock, heavy metal and punk rock. Dianno blasters through his the ever clever, sarcastic and personal voice. Voice that caused the smog in the Britannia, the melting of Greenland and the Osaka sun overwhelming heat. There is just something in the air, magic. The guitarist's shred way better than for example Osbournes fourth guitarist Zakk Wylde, just brilliant. The originality and the place, whoa, Japan!\n\nSomething about the songs: \"Another Life\" must've been the best song from Iron Maiden ever, where \"Remember Tomorrow\" is the causalitet of the insanity of sleeping to keep you alive. \"Purgatory\" just simply destroys every modern Maiden song currently. \"Killers\" puts this concert a nice caution of the dynamicity of the band in these gigs. And also, puts an end to this review, for now.\n",
        "\nLooking back, this last decade (2000-2010) has been a very satisfactory one for Iron Maiden fans. The release of three great albums (soon four?) put them right back on the map. Naturally, these albums contain several new classic songs and it\u2019s rather easy to argue that in Dance of Death\u2019s case, Rainmaker is its most recognizable song. So finding this single (the standard 3-song version) was quite a stroke of luck because of the cool stuff within. \n\nRainmaker is the first and obvious highlight here. Starting with what is essentially the band\u2019s catchiest riff of the decade, it develops into a solid rocker which rivals its 80s classic predecessors in coolness. The shining element here is the guitar playing, which distinguishes itself as very impressive in terms of interest and technicality. The middle of the song contains one of the band\u2019s most fitting solos, simply because it fits right in with the nature of the song, right before the final chorus and a repeat of the amazing opening riff. Bruce\u2019s vocal delivery is great as usual, though not his absolute best. Still, this is an unquestionably brilliant song and a Maiden classic. \n\nThe first B-side is the single\u2019s other highlight: an orchestral version of Dance of Death. Now, the original album version is one of the most remarkable tracks there and this version adds another spark of interest due to the very tasteful integration of the symphonic parts, subtle but nonetheless noticeable and pleasant. In fact, this version adds a new level of atmosphere to the already great original. \n\nUnfortunately, many good things have flaws and the Rainmaker single is no different: the other B-side, More Tea Vicar. This is four minutes of pointlessness. This song has Bruce rambling stuff over a few strange riffs which don\u2019t really go anywhere and some unfocused drumming. This song is actively annoying and drags the whole thing down. I\u2019d have preferred a live track included instead, which would\u2019ve made the whole thing a lot more enjoyable. \n\nSo this single contains two great trucks and a pointless failure which must always be skipped lest severe irritation ensue. The only real reason to get this single (aside from completists) is to hear the impressive modified version of Dance of Death, but most people will be more than satisfied by buying the much more accessible Dance of Death album.\n",
        "\nPiece of mind is an album that has been basically forgotten by both Iron Maiden and its fans. Except for The Trooper, which is easily one of the most popular songs by Iron Maiden, the band plays basically no songs from this album live. Some say it is a masterpiece that has been defeated by time; some say that it is simply underrated. I, however, say that Iron Maiden has done stuff much better than this album.\n\nPiece of Mind is Iron Maiden's second album featuring Bruce Dickinson, and in this one, Steve Harris clearly tried to push Bruce's vocals to the limit. It works well in the first half of the album (mainly in Where Eagles Dare, The Trooper and Die With Your Boots On), but fails spectacularly on Quest For Fire. The bass is completely audible and plays a very important role in every song, but hey, this is Iron Maiden, it is always like this. The guitars... Oh well, the guitars aren't as complex as they are in albums like Brave New World and Somewhere in Time. Harris tried to focus on the bass and the vocals, while leaving McBrain and Murray with interesting but predictable stuff.\n\nLet me start with the song that is probably the worst one Iron Maiden has ever recorded: Quest For Fire. The lyrics are dumb, the drumming and riffing are predictable and even the bass sucks in its own way: it is way too quiet and sometimes non-existent. Actually, Steve Harris probably had an idea for making Dickinson hit the highest possible note, and structured the whole song in order to fit this note, which leaves us with a song that looks like a Dickinson's solo project.\n\nThe album starts out nicely: Where Eagles Dare is not an Iron's masterpiece, but it has every quality that made Iron Maiden so respected and known. The song starts out with a pulse-like, emotional beat, and is followed by a heavy and catchy (although predictable) riff. Even if the middle sounds way too repetitive, this mistake is easily covered by the quality of the guitars, which were very well produced and had all the attributes of true heavy metal.\n\nAlright, the last part was a lie. The guitar's timbre is terrible in a lot of ways, and ends up turning Piece of Mind into a mix between hard rock and heavy metal. Whether it was intentional or not, I am not sure, but it would surely ruin the riffing and most-likely the whole album if it was not for Steve Harris' consistent bass and Dickinson's amazing vocals.\n\nThe Trooper is one of Iron Maiden's best songs live, and I beg the reader to not hate me when I say that it is not that good in the album. Don't get me wrong: the vocals are nice, the galloping drums are cool and the lyrics are emotional enough. However, the guitar attack, which is supposed to be the best part of this song (well, it really is live) suffers from the poor production. Anyway, it is worth noting that \"amazing\" is \"not that good\" in Iron Maiden's standards, so the song is far from bad.\n\n\"Flight of Icarus\" shows that even The Trooper's lyrics are not epic enough, and is probably the most emotional song of the album. It is also helped by Dickinson's amazing chorus, a part that was so good that people that are not into metal at all tend to like it very much. Maybe that is due to the nature of the song: excluding \"Quest For Fire\", \"Flight of Icarus\" is the song that resembles metal the least. Suffering from the weak-toned guitars, it is easily mistaken as an old hard rock song.\n\n\"Revelations\" is an atmospheric song, that manages to be both dark and beautiful. Bruce's performance here is the best he would deliver until the album \"Brave New World\", varying from soft to aggressive (not actually agressive, more like... Forceful) easily. The guitars do have great moments here, which is surprising since Dickinson wrote it (if you are his fan, remember his \"contribution\" to Powerslave before bashing me).\n\n\"Die With Your Boots On\" is awesome. The lyrics kill, the drums kill, the vocals kill (Harris and Smith do some nice backup, by the way), and even the guitar is unique in this amazing song. This song is probably the one that suffers the least from the hard-rock guitars. Although it does feel like hard rock sometimes, \"Die With Your Boots On\" is very metal-oriented, having nice riffing and epic (and kind of dark) lyrics.\n\n\"Still Life\" is one of the songs that most benefits from double guitars, and is at least partially into power metal. The melody here is good, but there are no memorable parts, which makes the song become ultimately boring once it reaches four minutes. Also, the spoken introduction tries to create a heavy atmosphere to the song, which fails miserably. Another song that exemplifies the epic tendency of this album is \"Sun and Steel\", but the melody here is much better and the song is actually epic, while \"Still Life\" simply tries very hard in order to be epic.\n\n\"To Tame a Land\" is a decent way to close the album. However, even if it has some nice melodies and lyrics, and very good vocals, it falls in the category of \"regular\", partially because it definitely shouldn't be almost 8 minutes long, partially because it has simply no memorable parts.\n\n\"Piece of Mind\" is a nice album, but definitely doesn't live up to its \"epic masterpiece\" status, mainly due to the crappy production on the guitars. This release has a terrible filler (Quest for Fire is barely tolerable), and when compared to releases like \"Brave New World\" and \"Somewhere in Time\", it is kind of weak. Although these musicians have proven us that they are incapable of recording something terrible, they could have done much better in this recording.\n",
        "\nTwo times they visited my country supporting Fear of The Dark, once in September \u201892 and then april \u201993. Of course, as being a dedicated fan, I went to each show. Also they released two live albums from that period. This was the time Maiden began flooding their discography with live recordings and haven\u2019t really stopped since. \u2018A real Live One\u2019 was pretty nice due to the track listing and \u2018A Real Dead One\u2019 also had a few nice additions.\n\nThe reasons to get this album if you\u2019re into Maiden are simple: \u2018Prowler\u2019, \u2018Transylvania\u2019 and \u2018Where Eagles Dare\u2019. Old classics played live for the first time in many years. Especially \u2018Where Eagles Dare\u2019 stands out. Having a live recording of \u2018Remember Tomorrow\u2019 with Bruce of course wasn\u2019t that special because of the 1982 Number of the Beast single.\n\nThe major complaint about \u2018Transylvania\u2019 is Janick Gers. His playing lacks the needed staccato feeling. And secondly the pace is slightly too slow. The slow pace is also what makes \u2018Prowler\u2019 sound less interesting. \n\nThen there are all those other songs. I have enough live versions of The Trooper, Hallowed By the Name etcera already, thank you very much. And with Gers on guitar the bands does look good and energetic live, but they don\u2019t sound that good anymore on a live album. He is sloppy and especially original Smith solo\u2019s need precision.\n\nThen there is Dickinson. Not at his best on this tour and it shows. Tired, uninspired, whatever the excuse was, we\u2019re not getting the best and together with Gers he is the second reason to discard this bad release.\n\nThe last straw is the production. Horrible! Blurry! Each song sounds too different from the other since they were recorded on different nights so the album does not sound cohesive. If they actually used the best versions from that tour of each song I wonder how bad Bruce sang or Gers played on the other recordings. Or how slow the band worked its way through Transylvania, Prowler and Iron Maiden on other nights. Of course the paces of Iron Maiden and Prowler here have more in common with the Soundhouse Tapes versions which featured Sampson on drums, but after growing up with the Clive Burr version, these slow interpretations are truly lacking.\n\nMusically Iron Maiden (including Gers) were so much better when promoting the No Prayer album and they would be pretty damn good again on the Ed Hunter tour. But this was the lowest point during the first Dickinson-era. The albums were getting bad, the performances sloppy. So 30 points for hearing three oldies again and that about wraps it up for this album.\n",
        "\nNow here is the song which started it all for me. It\u2019s the first Maiden song I ever heard. My starting point with this band and even metal in general (I don\u2019t count listening to Zeppelin, ACDC Aerosmith and such earlier). This is the song which grabbed my attention, pulled me away at that time from regular rock and pop. So really, for me there is something magical about Wasted Years, no denying it.\n\nAdrian Smith really was on a roll here. We wrote no less than 3 out of 8 tunes on Somewhere in Time from which two became singles. \u2018Wasted Years\u2019 was the most successful one (although I\u2019ll always prefer the heavier \u2018Stranger In A Strange Land\u2019)\n\u2018Wasted Years\u2019 is a simple mid paced song and, just like earlier Smith songs such as 2 Minutes To Midnight and Flight Of Icarus, build around a pop song structure and depending on just a few catchy riffs, an even catchier chorus and easily digestible melodies. The guitar intro is the most remarkable feature of the song. \n\n\u2018Reach Out\u2019 is a great song. The song combines mid paced rock with a sort of poppy eighties beauty. Smith has a good voice and sings well. Void of any raw edges Smith is the man for this job since Dickinson would have made the song either too majestic or maybe even too raw which is exactly what the song didn\u2019t need. However Dickinson\u2019s backing vocals are great I must add. \n\nAnd here I was, thinking all these years \u2018Reach Out\u2019 also was an Adrian Smith penned song which was recorded during the somewhere In Time sessions but deemed too soft for the regular album (and therefore Smith did lead vocals himself or whatever so it could be released as a B-side) \n\nWell, I got the lead vocals right and also the moment of its recording (or at least production). However the song was never intended for Maiden nor was it written by Smith. It was written by Dave Colwell (from Smith\u2019s first band Urchin) for the \u2018Entire Population of Hackney\u2019 project which featured Smith & McBrain and some others including Andy Barnett who had actually replaced Dave Murray in Urchin back in the seventies. Anyway, a long story which goes back to the Urchin days, a hiatus in 1985 and a follow up in 1989 when Smith, Colwell and Barnett did the A.S.A.P. album.\n\nWe were left with a joke. The \u2018Sheriff Of Huddersfield\u2019 a.k.a. Rod Smallwood, Maidens manager, is subject of a joke-song due to his (quote wikipedia) \u2018notorious stinginess and frequent complaining about a move to Los Angeles.\u2019 Whether you know the man and story or not (I obviously didn\u2019t back then) the song is nicely written and quite catchy. In a way a funny hard rock tune but not really suitable for a B-sides compilation with real songs and covers due to Dickinsons vocal impersonations throughout the song but fun to hear once every few years.\n\nOverall one of those singles you just have to own (and play) when you\u2019re into Maiden. For me, it has even more sentimental value.\n",
        "\nThough I tried not to plea for The X Factor in my review of that album, I can\u2019t stop myself this time, because this is truly looked at as Maiden\u2019s worst album, and I strongly disagree there. I just don\u2019t understand why people can\u2019t really get into this album and dismiss it as utter crap. There are a few changes in Maiden\u2019s sound here and there, like every 80s metalband used to have in the 90s, but nothing so terrible so everyone would hate it. The introduction of truly long songs and more dominant keyboards are a few, but they\u2019re quite nice actually. Another reason this album is often turned down is our beloved Blaze Bayley, but the man actually performs very good on this album and I can\u2019t find any weaknesses in his voice on here. Instead of trying to defend this album from its haters any further, I will now explain why I love it so much.\n\nThe ambience is a lot lighter than on The X Factor, which was masterful, but at times you just need to kick some ass, and that\u2019s where Virtual XI comes in. \u201cFutureal\u201d is the first of a bunch of adrenaline pumping fast-paced tracks. It\u2019s got everything a classic Maiden opener got, except for Bruce Dickinson, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a big loss on here. Second song on the album is a bit of a dragger and could be weary at times. \u201cThe Angel and the Gambler\u201d is an 8-minute long song with heavy pop influences and an overlong interplay. The synths are added very cheesily on here and it gives a bit of an 80s pop feel. Apart from that, the sentence \u201cdon\u2019t you think I\u2019m a saviour\u201d and the rest of it gets repeated more than 20 times. That\u2019s quite a lot, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s far from a highlight, but I think in the end I can swallow it; it can pass by on the album without notice. Adrenaline pumper #2 is \u201cLightning Strikes Twice\u201d. It starts with a gentle guitar intro, and then Blaze\u2019s splendid vocals enter and BOOM the song speeds up all of sudden. The guitar solo\u2019s are really inspiring here and kick major ass. To stay in the pattern of fast-long, we now should have another long one, and yes. It\u2019s even an epic! \u201cThe Clansman\u201d qualifies for the best song of the album, and it\u2019s quite hard to determine such a thing, for there are so much more great songs on here, as we will soon notice. This one starts off with the by now classic Maiden bass intro and then goes into the unbeatable \u201cfreedom!\u201d chorus, already in an upbeat part. It then goes on for another 8 minutes with a cool diversity of verses and choruses, with a silent bridge in between with cool solo\u2019s thereafter. The heroic legato melodies on here are also superb.\n\nAnd then we have \u201cWhen Two Worlds Collide\u201d; another song in the style of \u201cLightning Strikes Twice\u201d. It also starts of slow, this time with some arpeggiated chords, and then explodes. We are already out of lyrics when the interplay starts, just like on the aforementioned song, and we again have a killer solo to fill it up. Though it\u2019s similar in style it\u2019s by no means boring and still kicks some butts. Then comes the severely underrated \u201cThe Educated Fool\u201d. It also begins with a gentle intro. The chorus however is immensely catchy and energetic. The \u201ctime will flow\u201d-part needs a bit getting used to, but in the end it\u2019s just part of the great song. The lyrics are also brilliant. There is some heavy ass kicking in the interplay of this song, shifting from the legato-themes to a staccato-theme to a great solo and all the way back! One of the best songs of Iron Maiden ever, and I can\u2019t believe that people discard this one. When we go on we have \u201cDon\u2019t Look to the Eyes of a Stranger\u201d. Another 8-minute song and this time not an epic, not a pop song with overlong parts, but a stretched out rocker. Though you will be fooled by the intro, this song is fast and heavy and... long. Perhaps a bit too long, or perhaps not. They could\u2019ve cut down the \u201cdon\u2019t look to, don\u2019t look to\u201d part just before the interplay, but actually the whole instrumental part is a true feast for your ears. Nicko is having the time of his life on the drums, Dave and Janick switch leads most successfully and Steve probably had a good time composing it. The band is very coherent here. \n\nThis album has been on a very high note and Iron Maiden want to close it at the same quality. \u201cComo Estais Amigos\u201d is a beautiful ballad dedicated to the victims of the Falklands War. Iron Maiden never succeeded to bring tears to my eyes with Di\u2019Anno or Dickinson on vocals, but with Blaze it just happens. He managed to do that a few times on The X Factor, but also on this album closer he succeeds again. It's so very touching a song and so much emotion inside his voice. This is what makes Blaze Bayley one of my favorite singers; it\u2019s a feeling only he can give me. Apart from his performance, the band is at their best as well: incredibly well-composed interlude it has with maintaining the touching ambience of the verses and chorus within the legato-theme and the solo\u2019s. The best part of this song is the construction. It starts off very gentle, subtly adding an element after each verse until finally the full band kicks in and Blaze sings at full volume \u201cNo More Tears\u201d. And how dare people say the synthesizers were added improperly? Without them this song could not have been as great as it was.\n\nNeed I say more? I love this album! I can\u2019t understand how other people hate this. There are well-crafted songs, amazing guitar leads and stunning vocals. I wish Iron Maiden would have kept Blaze and made some more Virtual XI-esque albums. Unfortunately nobody agrees with what I just stated and the band was forced to take Bruce back. Alas, we will never know what their future could\u2019ve been with Blaze... Anyway, I highly recommend this album, as long as you can forget about Bruce. This exceeds Bruce and a lot of Maiden\u2019s earlier material by far.\n\nStrongest tracks: \u201cThe Clansman\u201d, \u201cThe Educated Fool\u201d and \u201cComo Estais Amigos\u201d.\nWeakest track: \u201cThe Angel and the Gambler\u201d.\n\nhttp://thecryreviews.blogspot.com/\n",
        "\nHere we have a beloved album by metal titans Iron Maiden. This album gets fellated all the time by fans as perfect epic power metal and other terms of praise. Well everyone has an opinion but those that love this album are apparently finding something that I\u2019m not, as this thing is weak outside of a few good to great tracks.\n\nThe first thing you notice on this is the guitar synths and the very different tone from prior Maiden classics. Personally I think this album sounds like crap. The synths tend to dominate the mix and really detract from the guitars and drums. Then you get to the song writing. Well if not for Adrian Smith this would have been a terrible album on par with the Blaze material. Songs packed with unmemorable riffs with weak choruses abound on this disc. The title song is a prime example. Bruce just sings \u201cCaught somewhere in Time\u201d over and over and it jars me every time I listen to it, not to mention those crappy synths I was talking about earlier. It\u2019s got a good Maiden gallop but that can\u2019t save it. Bruce sounds great but the chorus has no real flow to my ears. Heaven Can Wait is a prime example of Maiden writing songs for the live environment that don\u2019t really hold up at home listening to the album. It\u2019s not bad but it\u2019s not really good, it just goes and then is over with plenty of opportunities for sing along by the crowd at a gig. Loneliness of The Long Distance Runner is another track that seems like it has potential but weak lyrics and by the numbers riffage makes me lose interest soon. The chorus, like the title track\u2019s, really does nothing and sounds forced. The closing track is another one that gets much love from fans of this album but it seems like an attempt to write another Rime type epic. It fails. Its riff is decent but the song is just middling and a bit boring and at times the lyrics sound forced like Bruce is having trouble making Steve\u2019s writing flow melodically.\n\nDid I mention I hate the synth sound on this album? The next disc would incorporate such things much better.\n\nThe drumming is quite fine but wasted on this substandard material. Good Lord Nicko\u2019s bass drum foot is so damn fast! With that kind of speed who needs a double bass kit? I think he was really coming into his own here, not to downplay his great playing on earlier discs. Another high point is the generally high quality solos, especially H\u2019s work on Wasted Years and Stranger in a Strange Land. The instrumental work is all well played for what it is, but it\u2019s just not very interesting on repeated listens.\n\nIt\u2019s not all bad so let\u2019s get to the good. The first single \u201cWasted Years\u201d is amazing. The main riff and the bass work are amazing, as is the emotion that Bruce is able to get into the lyrics and vocal melody. His voice soars on this but one thing soars higher, Adrian\u2019s solo. Holy shit. That is an emotional solo. It\u2019s so perfect in the way it fits the song that for me it\u2019s the best guitar solo of all time. Not crazy shredding or anything, just pure emotional playing to fit the song. The only way I can describe how it makes me feel is to borrow from the song, \u201cIt makes me want to cry, and throw my hands up to the sky\u201d! Typical song structure but really done well.\n\nThe next track is another quality piece by H with a slamming galloping riff and baseline that just moves the listener to bang that head. Great vocals and strong lyrics add to it with the usual excellent effort by Mr. McBrain. This is a rock solid tune that really helps boost my rating of this album. The chorus flows and the song flow with it, good songwriting.\n\nThe final song of note is another Smith creation, \u201cStranger in a Strange Land\u201d. It is another emotional piece with lyrics of failed exploration and death. Bruce just nails it highlighting the emotional nature and then Smith hits us with another amazing solo. He was really nailing it here and carried the album in many places. Speed wanking on the fret board is impressive for a few minutes but real emotional playing is so much better and so much more satisfying in the long run and that is just what Adrian is giving us here. Go H go.\n\nUltimately they tried and the potential was there but the execution didn\u2019t hold up. Dickinson was shut out of the songwriting process and \u2018arry was not able to craft the good ideas into good songs. Throw in synths overpowering the rest of the music at times and you have an album that could have been great but falls well short. Thankfully they would get it back together for the next album, which would be the last really great Iron Maiden album.\n",
        "\nHow to grab autothrall by the balls and never let go: Adorn your album in a swank, futuristic city scene on a wraparound cover, loaded with little details and 'easter eggs' that not only affix to various cultural references, but also to some of the songs on the album and other self-referential overtures. Make sure Eddie is present with lazer gun and pecs, having gone all Blade Runner through cybernetics and a will to kill. Next, make sure you include eight of the best songs your band has ever written, with a truly surreal, progressive tinge of processed guitars, lyrics dabbling in contemporary science fiction, or in the lives of sweeping historical figures, or other various films or stories. Add a little synthesizer and wash it all out in the reverb-heavy 80s production values that are sadly lacking in today's...forward movements in sound.\n\nCongratulations, you've got two testicles in a vice. Be careful with them. With great power comes great responsibility. 666 may be The Number of the Beast, but 6th is the album I hold before me, my personal favorite of the band's entire career, ever so slightly edging out the also-flawless Powerslave. And I'll come clean, it's largely due to the particular nostalgia I have always felt for Somewhere in Time. My go-to album. My desert island affair. And one of the most outstanding pieces of recorded music I have the privilege to own. The most 'classic' lineup of the band: Harris, Dickinson, Murray, Smith, McBrain, all out in finest form, reaching deep into their collective imagination to produce a masterwork of poise and polish, a progressive half-step between the swashbuckling fortitude of its predecessor and the gleaming psychological vistas eschewed by the following Seventh Son of a Seventh Son.\n\nIt honestly surprises me at times that I fancy this album so, because when I usually think of the aggressive, classic Maiden, the first sounds that come to mind are always those staples of other albums like Piece of Mind or Killers, \"Aces High\" or \"2 Minutes to Midnight\". And while Somewhere in Time does wear some related footwear to those last two, there is some subtle nuance to the writing here which ever compels me into its dreaming, reflective vistas of expression. This is the best album when it pertains to a complete experience. There is no other which feels as right to play for 51 minutes straight, track 1 all the way to 8. Some might argue that it lacks the power or emotion of several other Iron Maiden offerings, but what better emotion could be evinced from a work of metal music than an all-expense-paid immersion into the future and past, 'A Christmas Carol' with Eddie at the helm in place of a trio of cautionary phantasms.\n\nA cheesy yet extraordinary synth serves as an aegis to the carefully construed melodies of \"Caught Somewhere in Time\", soon to disappear under the momentum of the band's triplet charging madness, and Dickinson's crystalline, wavering tones that spin a yarn of two travelers in time, the one goading the other through an infinity of windows and adventures. Sure, the chorus is as daft and obvious as the song title, like you'll find in about 95% of all music, but it delivers. The bridge work here is phenomenal, with gorgeous melodic lines cascading about the mid-paced thrust of the bass and rhythm guitars. It doesn't hurt that the band is about to follow with what might be one of their single best songs in history. I refer of course to the tantalizing, signature volley of notes that introduces \"Wasted Years\", a song with a surprisingly blue-collar, rocking ethic to the verses that feels not unlike other hard rockers of the 80s, Saxon or Def Leppard, albeit with Bruce at the helm. But the chorus is beyond unforgettable, with the layered vocals shifting over some of the most simplest and life affirming chords in all metaldom.\n\nIf only we could bottle up the emotional resonance of that song, and take it with us, to drink all our days and forget the ravages of mundane existence. Oh, it's called an .mp3 player? \"Sea of Madness\", one of the lesser known tracks of this album (shocking, I know) emerges next from the phlogiston, with a nice interplay between the cheesy synth and guitar in the verse, and another siren-like, inescapable chorus that turns us over to the bump and trot of the 2nd verse. There's also a pretty lowdown and moody passage that cycles through the center of the track, if only to bring back the powerful reverb of the guitars once more. \"Heaven Can Wait\", like \"Wasted Years\" is one of the most accessible, or radio-friendly pieces on the album. Surprisingly, did not rate a video or single back in those days, but the scorching chorus of vocals, ringing melodic guitars and lightly seasoned backup synth will surely create a sensation of warmth through your being long after the fire of the solo has died and the bass swerves us out.\n\nThe second half of Somewhere in Time is all the more pensive, beginning with \"The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner\", a psychological study of the film and book of the same name, and the very act of extreme athleticism which they involve. But this is no \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\", and though the lyrics might ponder, the music races along with the band's usual index of melodies and forceful rhythms, including the epic lead break at 3:30 which every goddamn power metal band since just wishes they could have written first. \"Stranger in a Strange Land\" is sadly only a reference to the Robert A Heinlein novel in name. However, the story of an arctic explorer finding a frozen body is deep enough to satisfy, especially when one can put yourself in the fictional skin of the character and think of the lyrics from a first person perspective. There is a nice, proggish blues moment in the chorus where the guitars paddle along through the timestream, and the bass accompanying the solo break is a delight.\n\n\"D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu\" leads down further paths of flight, wonderful harmonies erupting one of the more powerful verse rhythms of the album, with Bruce dishing out some of the more venomous tones as he careens towards his glittering chorus 'Feel like I've been here before'. I can assure you, no, Iron Maiden has not been here before. The marching drums and hammering guitar of the bridge leads into another soothing triple melody with the guitars and synth. The album ends with the 8 and a half-minute historical epic \"Alexander the Great\", and the riffing represents various elements of the man's life. War, politics, ambition, and glory can all be felt through the guitar patterns, yet the lyrics are played pretty straight, a simple narrative of the figure's acclaimed destiny. Before 4:00 the track goes a little awol into prog rock territory, you may feel a little 80s Rush or Yes in this, which of course serves as an omen of their next album. After that, some great, moody percussion and slowly wound leadwork arrives like a soldier on an elephant, and it all ends like the closure of some mighty procession.\n\nIf you can't tell the forest for the trees, Somewhere in Time is mandatory listening, whether you dabble in Maiden on a regular basis or you're some curious child, or perhaps you've been doing missionary work in some exotic land for the past 24 years and hadn't had any access to this particular treasure vault. It's neither the heaviest of the band's efforts nor the most remembered by the howling masses at their live gigs, who seem to content themselves with just a hit by hit track-ography of all their classic albums, but damn, what I would pay to see the band perform this in its entirety. This is actually the last of the band's 'crucial' discography. Seventh Son is a Seventh Son and Brave New World are both great, don't get me wrong, but if I was forced to choose sides and sharpen the band's career to the very finest edge, it would begin with Killers and end on the final notes of \"Alexander the Great\".\n\nHope you've enjoyed my Iron Maiden discography!\n\nHighlights: 24 years worth across 51 minutes.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nFirst impressions are important, and I can only imagine how much they accomplished for Iron Maiden when they released their 1980, self-titled debut, the first mile marker on a long, fast paced marathon straight to the very summit of metal music and worldwide notoriety. This was unfortunately not my own first exposure to the band, as I hitched a ride on the wagon with Killers and then had to listen back. I don't enjoy it quite so much as its successor, since that album simply kicked my ass a lot harder in the long run, but there are a number of tracks here which are nearly impossible to shake out of the memory. At the very least, the firm roots were planted which would blossom into the steel fruits of the next three decades, and beyond...\n\nIron Maiden is notable as the only album in which the original lineup is over 50% different than the current roster, and to think...the band had a fair number of vocalists, guitarists and drummers before this one even took shape. Paul Di'anno and Clive Burr would go on to the sophomore album Killers, and Burr to The Number of the Beast, but this is the only studio album to feature Dennis Stratton on guitar alongside Dave Murray and Steve Harris (the two remaining 'original' members today). This is also perhaps the album which most matches the 'NWOBHM' motif that many of the band's peers were exploring, a very 70s vibe which comes as no surprise since some of the songs were written in that timeframe. It's not entirely heavy (none of their albums are), and several tracks maintain a somewhat psychedelic vibe, but that's actually one of the things I enjoy most about the album.\n\n\"Prowler\" is the first at bat, a steady rocker that belongs at the heart of any Western 80s metropolis, as the ladies of the night and their admirers stalk the seedy city streets and the hard bite of the chords shuffles on, erupted by the forceful melodies that pick up the pace. Perhaps the best part of the song is the wild bridge at 1:47, where the guitars burn off like a brand against the mind and the solo explodes like a supernova. \"Remember Tomorrow\" feels like the Iron Maiden answer to \"White Rabbit\", with a psychedelic slur to the bass and a gently bouncing rhythm that bristles at the edges with its slight guitar shudders, only to transform at the 2:00 mark into a powerful stretch of chords that mirror other NWOBHM bands like Angel Witch. When all and said is done, this is one of my favorite tracks on the album, memorable and covering a wide spread of emotional impact. But \"Running Free\" is one of the most recognizable, due to the steady splash of the drums and the wonderfully delivered chorus line. There's a reason this song has been a live standard ever since...it's the type of sentiment that can seek out relation far wider than the band's core metalhead, hard rocker fanbase.\n\n\"Phantom of the Opera\" is the 'epic' of this debut album, at about 7 minutes long, so not quite as involved as some of their sprawling, later tracks. It's tightly controlled, with mesmerizing, spry, memorable acrobatics on the guitars and a fantastic bridge laden in even further melodic musings, before returning to its savage final verse. The instrumental \"Transilvania\" features some killer speed metal before the drum beat enters to marry the slower, thundering pace of the pre-verse, which feels half like a pirate shanty. Another of the timeless classics of this album, it features the most intense guitar exchanges and Steve Harris losing his mind on tape. \"Strange World\" is by far the most psychedelically charged song in the Iron Maiden discography, like the band were jamming to some lost Pink Floyd cycle but incorporating the shimmering melodies of the metal guitars.\n\nI'll admit I'm not the biggest fan of \"Charlotte the Harlot\", it's not that the ballsy blues metal atmosphere bothers me, simply that the riffs do very little for me. But regardless, it's got some intensive drumming and a shuffle to it that feels similar to several of the tracks the band would later release on Killers. The band's namesake \"Iron Maiden\" stands alongside \"Running Free\" as one of the tracks here that the band will simply not forsake, having played it in their regular live set for 30 years. It's not my personal favorite, but certainly infectious, with fun little melodies that launch out of the chorus and delightful bridge melodies. I should also mention \"Sanctuary\", which may not have been included on the original release of the album, but has been a part of so many subsequent re-issues that it deserves a spot here, a fun and firm fusion of Maiden heresy and Steppenwolf's \"Born to Be Wild\" with some wailing solos and busy bass.\n\nClearly the start of something beautiful, much of Iron Maiden holds up well to this day, though not so much as the crushing followup Killers. There are fans out there who still rank this as the band's finest hour. But, the rose-tinted goggles of nostalgia aside, it does not fully represent to me the characteristics of the band's best work, which would arrive in spades over the next 5 full-length efforts. I don't often find myself going out for a \"Charlotte the Harlot\" or \"Sanctuary\", and though \"Strange World\" is peachy, it feels to me like some other band. Still, the performance of the original members Stratton and Burr is strong here, and Di'anno's tones sound natural with the more 70s hard rock and psychedelic foundation that permeates about half the album. It's an important album, and a very good album, critical in helping to usher on the onslaught of 80s metal evolution and its many hydra-headed revolutions and sub-genres, but I honestly feel the band has surpassed this many times over.\n\nHighlights: Remember Tomorrow, Running Free, Phantom of the Opera, Transilvania\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nBecause destroying your new vocalist's chances with the fans and the world through the release of an entirely mediocre 10th album was just not enough...the swiftly sinking Iron Maiden had to go and follow that up with a pinnacle of career embarassment that rivals Metallica's St. Anger or Megadeth's Risk. In fact, Virtual XI is so bad that it makes Tim 'Ripper' Owens two albums with Judas Priest seem shining by comparison...not that I encourage you to waste your time there, I'm simply sliding the mercury down the thermometer so you have a clear idea of just how fucking wretched this temperature is.\n\nPerhaps the best way to describe this album's sound is to create a hypothetical situation. Let's imagine for a moment that a group of fresh young Iron Maiden fans who had only just learned to play their instruments because they were inspired by The X Factor. Let's assume that all of these kids had a jamspace within driving distance of a venue where the band was touring, in which you could find their cheap instruments, a couple carpets for muffling, a basic PA, and two Iron Maiden CDs: The X Factor, and some greatest hits compilation which the band rarely listens to since they are so obsessed with the former. Now let's say one of these blokes has a van, and that somehow, after a Maiden gig, they've gotten Blaze very drunk and 'kidnapped' the poor man to their jamspace. Once they arrive, they keep getting Blaze even more hammered, sit him on a stool, hand him the microphone, and have him ad lib over some shitty songs they wrote...inspired by The X Factor. Then they record the session an 8 track or 16 track or whatever they've got lying around.\n\nVirtual XI is actually WORSE than the result of what such an outlandish meeting might produce...\n\nThe flaws are myriad with this album. From its dulled down, absolutely uninspiring production values which mirror those of the previous album, to the dreadful songwriting which cannot have taken more than a beer or two to produce. Yes, this album sounds like it was released rather haphazardly, and I'm curious how EMI Records even let it slip past them. At the very best, and I'm talking the rare moments of this album that do not immediately induce vomit or other symptoms of malaise, the songs sound like a shallow redundancy of things we've already heard through the band's career, recycled just to get a passing score and the disc to the pressing factory. Although I like the guy, and hate to admit it, Blaze Bayley sounds terrible, like a drunk at a karaoke bar. He hits his usual, sombering range here, but let's be honest...even if the guy was suddenly channeling Andrea Bocelli here, the music is so bland and dreary that the effort would have been wasted.\n\nThere are guitar melodies, there are plodding basslines, and there are all the signature staples of Iron Maiden's past written across Virtual XI, except one: good, or even passable songs. The material on this album ranges from the truly embarassing (\"Como Estais Amigos\", in which Blaze Bayley tries to wax emotional over a crappy, repetitious sequence of notes that even the atmospheric keyboard cannot save) to the just bad (\"The Clansman\", which has one or two decent lines in which the repeated vocal melody creates a nice theme to which any Scot might want to tip his mug, but not for 9 fucking minutes...oh no). \"The Angel and the Gambler\" is stupefyingly mundane...like if you took a handful of old Maiden riffs, dulled them down to drunken laxness, tossed on an organ and strings, and took a giant squat all over the resulting mess. I mean, just listen to it...\n\nActually, belay that order. Do not listen to this. You'll only hate me more than you already do. \"The Educated Fool\", \"When Worlds Collide\", and \"Futureal\" sound like poor outtakes from The X Factor. None are any good, but perhaps if the latter and \"The Clansman\" had only been thrown onto that album instead of \"Sign of the Cross\", that one could have been somewhat easier to stomach. One of the riffs in \"Futureal\" sounds as if the band later salvaged it for \"The Wicker Man\", and the melodic guitars aren't the worst thing on the album, but that is saying very little. \"Don't Look to the Eyes of a Stranger\" is abysmal, with horrid lyrics that eschew the same string of cliches you'll find everywhere on this disc. \"Lightning Strikes Twice\" has a fair, moodiness to its initial minute, but as the power chords hammer in, it sounds incredibly goofy due to Blaze's vocals, and the way the track cuts to and fro sounds pitiful, like the band actually needed to randomly string it together from sequences that might have belonged in other tracks. The chorus vocal pattern at the end is too little and too late.\n\nKill it with fire! Melt it into slag, whatever it takes to rid yourself of the stagnation and foul memory of exposure to this monument to mediocrity...for Virtual XI worships at the foot of such an altar, stretches its arms, begging to be accepted as even a plain old, forgettable album. But what has manifested upon this release is something much worse...awful music that feels contrived and conceived simply to fill a void, to meet a quota, to pay the bills. When reading that several of Brave New World's tracks might have been written for this album, one has to wonder why they are not present here, for even with Bayley's uninspired barroom browbeating they might have been the stick hanging out over the quicksand's edge...the one saving grace through which the album could have pulled its tired carcass out of its inevitable fate. But no....\n\nGlurg. Glurg. Grasping hand, with no one to take hold of it. Bubble. Bubble. Dying Gasp. The End.\n\nHighlights: Yeah. That'll be the day!\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nIron Maiden's sophomore effort Killers is such a good ole gem that I often dream of what the band's career would have been like had they held on to Paul Di'Anno (and Clive Burr) forever. Perhaps there may never have been a Powerslave or Piece of Mind that was quite the same as those that front Dickinson's powerful pipes, but it's not hard to understand why some of Maiden's fans have eventually divided into two camps: those that prefer the 80s Dickinson streak of genius, and those that believe the first two albums represent the band at its most vital. Although I clearly belong to the former camp, with almost all of my favorite albums involving Bruce's vocals, I have grown very fond of the first two albums with age. There is just no denying it...if you want to hear Maiden at their closest to the 'pack' of the raw, pure NWOBHM bands, Killers is a monumental record that was nearly without peer (if you discount a few bands like Judas Priest), which took the infectious energy and good hooks of the s/t debut to a new height. It's also the first album by the band that I actually got into as a kid...\n\nAnd it is one badass album. Where later Maiden efforts howl at you through the winds of history, the realms of the imagination or the shimmering neon streets of the future, Killers takes you from the shadows of the back alley of the sprawling 80s metropolis, lunging at you with a rusted cleaver, cackling with glee. That's not to infer that it ignores the band's old penchant for lyrics based in science fiction, horror and history. But compared to an album Somewhere in Time, Killers is just low down, dirty and mean, without totally lacking that melodic kick in the pants that made this band a household name on planet Earth. I can't blame Di'Anno for any of the drug problems he may have succumbed to while helping to conceive or tour off this album, because I honestly feel like taking a snort or two myself and tracing it with a draft of something dark and lethal proof when I listen to these songs.\n\nDon't let the short-lived majesty of \"The Ides of March\" deceive you, because \"Wrathchild\" comes storming out like Jack the Ripper posteuring as a Hendrix or Page. The riffs groove and stomp while Di'Anno weaves his old catlike sorcery like a dirty man that knows he's about to score with every whore in the pub. Mind you, I mean this only with the sincerest of compliments, because if anything, Killers is the most 'sexy' Iron Maiden album. Denim and leather, spikes and booze, this is heavy metal music and it is not ashamed. \"Murders in the Rue Morgue\" devours you with terse seconds of tranquility, before the sparse chords ring out. I'd almost call the fast paced verse of the song 'uplifting', considering the Edgar Allen Poe story it was based on, but regardless, it is one of the best fucking songs this band has ever played, and I've got a lawn that wants you to kindly step off if you don't agree! Flighty, fun solos and an unflinching, dark boogie to the chorus assure that this is likely a standard on every Jukebox in Hell. Do you seriously think the Devil listens to Deicide or Akercocke? Because he doesn't. He listens to this.\n\nReminding you that metal is in fact just a more abusive form of rock and roll is the wailing bluesy taint that intros \"Another Life\", a hammering joint that features a nice echoing spin to Di'anno' vocals, and a stream of bleeding melodies over the plunking pumpkin bass of 'Arry. I was only about seven years when this damn thing came out, but even then I was jealous of what high schoolers must have done with their sweeties behind closed doors when this thing was playing, because it's hot like melted wax. \"Genghis Khan\" is a ripping instrumental with some savage, pumping guitar rhythms that easily transport you to the fields of conquest that its titular figure once grazed upon. And at 1:00 minute, the song becomes GO TIME, as in bang your unworthy head you sodden fuck! \"Innocent Exile\" finds an amazing medium between the band's hard rock blues grooves and titillating sense for raucous metal melody. Combined with the badass, on the run from the law lyrics, I cannot help but envy the outlaw, the trucker, the motorcycle man, or any other marginalized stereotype the song evokes within me.\n\nAnd lo, though the album had by this point long since earned its keep, it is far from finished with you. \"Killers\" introduces the unforgettable, solemn and steady bass line bristling with quiet guitars before the forward trot below the harmonic debauchery, and then the chorus which is like a mighty punch in the groin that would fell a hundred Goliaths. This functions better than \"Eye of the Tiger\" by Survivor as a psyche-up for a fight, sportlike or to the death. After this, \"Prodigal Son\" surprises with its river rolling, homely clean guitar tones and Di'Anno vocals that cut through the night like a a radio in a lone trucker's cab beneath some twilight, open desert. Might not be as heavy as the rest of the album, but it still kicks a severe amount of tail. \"Purgatory\" is a nice early speed/power metal number with a fierce and unforgettable chorus that sails across the abyss like a beautiful hell-kite, aglow with subterranean lightning, and \"Drifter\" features that sick, descending guitar line intro, though as much as I enjoy the song, it might be the one thing here I don't find entirely captivating or perfect.\n\nOf course, being that I had the US release, I was also entreated to the delightful \"Twilight Zone\" in between \"Killers\" and \"Prodigal Son\", and what can I say...it's a perfect track with more of Di'Anno's, excellent echoed wailing, and one of my overall favorites on the disc, with guitars that burn straight past your defenses into your metal soul.\n\nKillers is certainly a strong case for the original Maiden being every bit the contender that its next incarnation would prove to be. Proof that this is one of the few bands to easily weather periods of two distinct, excellent vocalists (but not three, sadly). But beyond that, it is one of the very best of the early 80s heavy metal offerings, with songs and production that have survived, intact, through almost three decades. I don't appreciate every waking second of the album with equivocal lust, but it's fantastic, and easily one of the band's better efforts. If by some anomaly you have yet to avail yourself of its charms, I suggest you make it so, lest you feel the burn of eternal shame as the rest of us avert our eyes from you, avoiding you like a bearer of plague.\n\nHighlights: Perhaps the heaviest album of all time to feature the word 'cuddle'?\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nBrave New World brought a ray of hope back into the hearts of many an Iron Maiden fan, but three years later, the hysteria over the band's reunion would subside. The honeymoon was over. Could the band deliver another album of the same quality? Or would the creative curse the band suffered in the latter half of the 90s rear a head so ugly it makes Eddie himself cringe? Well, unlucky no. 13, Dance of Death sort of falls somewhere in the middle of the two possibilities. Like Brave New World, it's got an excellent production and a very bright, life affirming feel to the compositions, but at the same time, it's a little darker and certainly more mellow. The result is an album that, while not unpleasant to listen to, simply doesn't inspire or aspire to the heights of the band's older works. Ultimately, there are about 2-3 good songs and the rest feels like filler with reasonable intentions.\n\nNow, mind you, despite the flaws, Dance of Death is not as miserable an album as the two the band put out with Blaze Bayley. There is plenty to be bored with here, but the album never hinges on any brand of audio torture that will have you questioning the existence of whatever God you pray to. The songs are somewhat busy, even if they don't often imprint themselves upon your memory. The lyrics are a lot like the previous album, a mixture of historically based musings and self-reflection, so it's unfortunately not a complete return to the subject matter of their 80s albums. But perhaps with age the band's fire for such pulp has died, and the band simply wants to say something more...poignant? I can't exactly fault the band for this, but the end result is that it's just not the same amount of fun...and that cannot be denied.\n\nDance of Death at least follows Brave New World's example of putting its best feet forward. In this case, most of the better songs occur very early on in the record, beginning with the count off to the mildly catchy \"Wildest Dreams\", which is an uplifting track in the vein of \"The Wicker Man\" but with more backing vocal melody to the chorus, which also features a swath of biting chords that mark the climax. The lead is fair, but the riff the band breaks into directly after that is an entirely generic sequence of notes that no band should be considering in the 21st century. \"Rainmaker\" is far better, and in truth one of the few tracks I actually still listen to on a normal basis. It's a pretty memorable rocker with a memorable impact to the verse and chorus, due not only to Dickinson's performance, but some nice, choppy melodic guitars that bust into solid, driving chords. \"No More Lies\", however, is 7+ minutes of mediocrity, from yet another of the band's soft spoken intro sequences up to the bland payoff of the chorus. About the only thing that stood out here were the post-chorus guitar melodies, which reminded me a little of Amorphis' \"On Rich and Poor\" sans the power.\n\nThe album returns to compelling, though, with \"Monts\u00e9gur\", one of several songs that take inspiration from historical battles, in particular the sack of the Cathar's final keep at the hands of the Catholic Albigensian Crusade in the 13th century. There is a nice, impulsive anger here delivered through the vocals and the careful intensity of the building guitars, and the two entwined through the chorus are probably the single most glorious point of the entire album. \"Dance of Death\" is another slow moving piece, over 8 minutes, which works best whenever the orchestra gets involved, but is otherwise quite dull, with nary a moment of memorable writing aside from the fact that the core band is 'not alone'. Dickinson does build up some aggression here, similar to the previous track. It's not entirely flaccid, but even then I am hard pressed to remember a note of it. \"Gates of Tomorrow\" has revisits one of those old, tremolo guitar riffs which make you feel that ZZ Top, Van Halen or Dire Straits are about to rock your socks off, and while I don't care for much aside from the chorus, at least that part is graceful enough to hang it by a thread above the mundane.\n\nThe rest of the album is where I generally draw blanks when I try to think back about it's strong points. \"New Frontier\" is aggressive and melodic, and in fact seems like the track here that I'd like the most on any given day, yet I just don't find any solace in the melodies or any desire to revisit it. \"Paschendale\" is another of the historic battle themes (God Dethroned also wrote an album about it a few years later), and it does build a little fire as the verse starts to rollick, with some well-timed symphonic swells, but so much of the 8:30 minutes could simply be clipped to get to the good bits, that it's a tough sell. \"Face in the Sand\" reminded me of \"Blood Brothers\" from the last album, but perhaps diving into a little more of a serious, atmospheric bridge. \"Age of Innocence\" has some nice, Bond-like digs in its surging melodies, and it was probably my favorite track on the latter half of the album, especially when it launches those insane melodies before 4:00, and \"Journeyman\" at least has that one catchy line in the verse, but again, I could have done without at least 2-3 minutes of the song. Not that there's anything wrong with a longer song, and Maiden have executed them successfully a number of times, but it seems for every memorable moment on this album there are 2-3 that just don't register.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, Dance of Death delivers yet another massive, wafting sound, as if you were witnessing the album live, in crystal clarity, and its melodies and tones were rising up to the rafters on the wings of skull-headed angels. There is a certain maturity and refinement to the songs that one might expect of any old metal or prog rock band of Maiden's status, but like so many of the band's peers (or even older rock bands that are still alive and kicking out hugely professional, big budget albums), the full body, the completeness of nearly 70 minutes of 'okay' material just doesn't add up to the primal vitality of their better years. I don't have a hate on for the album, because it's like picking cherries. The juices start flowing with anticipation in your mouth, but after a few bites...the romance is ended. But I'm sure there is some obsessive cherry lover out there who would disagree, and now I'll shut up.\n\nHighlights: Rainmaker, Monts\u00e9gur, Age of Innocence\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\n\u2018Holy Smoke\u2019, apart from the sweet intro, wasn\u2019t a real Maiden nor metal song and sounded like a comedy band playing background metal and probably would\u2019ve been a funny b-side joke during the eighties. \n\nHowever, In 1990 it not only found its way unto a regular album but even became a single as well. Releasing the second comedy-song from the album (Bring Your daughter) 3 months later didn\u2019t make things any better for No Prayer\u2019s reputation. No, Maiden were losing it around this time and it wasn\u2019t just because they\u2019d lost Adrian Smith. Harris could\u2019ve still controlled the band and sound if he had wanted to, but he didn\u2019t or he just had an indecisive phase. \n\nDickinson just doesn\u2019t really sing and barks his way through the composition, which could\u2019ve been written by any local pub group in a drunk mood getting tired of playing the same Wishbone Ash and Golden Earring covers for over 15 years. Anyway, there were of course plenty of good metal tunes on No Prayer to choose from like Tailgunner or Fates Warning but instead the band decided to take pubescent cheesiness a tad too far. And when a band in their mid-thirties becomes pubescent, you just know something is wrong.\n\nTo make things worse we are presented two of the most dull covers in Maiden\u2019s career. But Maiden in their glory days could have given these two mediocre songs something extra. Not this time though. If I recall the drive and passion of Rainbow\u2019s Gold, That Girl and Massacre and compare it with these pretty tame performances it becomes painfully obvious the band had lost a lot of its bite, energy and eagerness.\n\nCollecting dust. Filling up the collection. I wouldn\u2019t recommend this to anyone outside the die-hard Maiden collectors.\n",
        "\nI shan\u2019t say much about \u2018Can I Play With Madness\u2019 except that I really love this song despite its radio-friendly rock-cheesiness. As I said earlier about many rock covers Maiden played in the eighties, they managed to make even sleazy rock sound great (a skill they obviously lost since then). The production has an important influence as well here, making the song sound more majestic than it actually was.\n\nAnyway, onto the real highlight of this single, \u2018Massacre\u2019. A Thin Lizzy cover played to such perfection and beauty it\u2019s almost creepy. In the hands of Maiden it turns into gold and the earlier mentioned broad production is the icing on the cake. It also is a cover which suits Maiden own songs remarkably well, style wise.\n\nAnd then we have \u2018Black Bart Blues\u2019, which has a lot of spoken nonsense but the joke is funny only once and it feels like ages before the \u2018real\u2019 song finally kicks in. And the \u2018real\u2019 song isn\u2019t even good. Enjoyable once, granted, but really nothing more than a lame bluesrock tune. A bit annoying since the first single from their previous album had a joke song as well, which was a lot better.\n\nReally, \u2018Massacre\u2019 is reason enough to get your hands on this single. It is that good!\n",
        "\nMaiden\u2019s second single from Somewhere in Time once again was a Smith penned track. This time one of his heavier ones. Based around a simple yet effective main riff and a bass line which is almost too simple for Harris to play. It\u2019s a song I always liked because it was extremely different from the rest of the album yet still immensely heavy, catchy and therefore Maiden-worthy.\n\nFilling up this EP were two covers which earlier had been played by \u2018The Entire Population of Hackney\u2019, Nicko McBrain\u2019s project in 1985 together with Smith and some ex-Urchin members. The FM cover \u2018That Girl\u2019 is great stadium rock and with this production it almost sounds majestic. The Marshall Fury cover \u2018Juanita\u2019 is slightly less impressive, being pretty one-dimensional, but still sounding great in the hands of Maiden. The riffs are played with such ease it\u2019s nothing short of impressive and convincing.\n\n\u2018Stranger in a Strange Land\u2019 is definitely one of the better Maiden singles from the Dickinson-era due to the well chosen a-side and having more than one great cover.\n",
        "\nIn three decades of listening to heavy metal music, there are few periods in which I was so glum and down on a band as the awkward, silent years after Iron Maiden released the atrocious Virtual XI, which pretty much tolled the death knell for the band with Blaze Bayley on vocals. Once again, I should clarify that I actually do like Blaze, in particular his work with Wolfsbane and his solo band, but he just never felt right in this band...and of the few live performances I've heard, in only a few of the songs was he clearly doing justice to the Maiden standards. Having Dickinson off with a fairly successful solo career (making better records than Maiden) and watching the world race past with a revival of power and classic NWOBHM sounds in the late 90s must have all shaken off on Harris and co. The result was that the band were going to reunite with the 80s, Dickinson lineup, Blaze graciously stepping aside.\n\nSo Bruce and Adrian Smith joined back up, and the band decided to keep Janick Gers for the three guitar attack. To be fair, the guy put in enough work to deserve it, and having seen them live in this incarnation, I can honestly say the three guitars do not hurt. As the result of all this kissing and making up, Maiden released Brave New World right about the turn of the century, and oh my was it glorious. Not in the jaw dropping, new masterpiece sense, but by the simple virtue that one of your favorite heavy metal albums had released their best album in over a decade (since Seventh Son of a Seventh Son), and gone were the grim memories of the tired and spent Iron Maiden of the 90s. Brave New World is not a perfect album, but it's a damn good effort, and as there have been no more brave new worlds since, well...I'll take it.\n\nI will say that the band wasted no time in placing the best track on the album in the opening slot, and \"Wicker Man\" had me parading about the streets when I first heard it, wearing a denim jacket far too small for me, reeking of old alcohol and grunge, but absolutely no regret! No, sir. The song reminded me of everything I had always loved about this band...solid old heavy metal rhythm guitars, brazen vocal melodies and a solo that has more to offer than some showboat's flatulence. Granted, this is a happier song than most of the band's past glories, but it certainly has an emotional impact, as any track with Bruce Dickinson pointing at you and screaming 'Your time will come!' is likely to have towards any fan, on so many levels. Quite an exhilarating song, and the rest of Brave New World had its work cut out for it...\n\nAnd to my surprise, I was not disappointed. \"Ghost of the Navigator\" has a spacious, airy feel to the driving guitars, and a powerful, soaring chorus that shows Dickinson has not skipped a beat since his earlier years with the band. \"Brave New World\" trots along like one of those desperate old tracks like \"Quest for Fire\", with a nice segment around 3:00 where Bruce highlights the guitar melody, and a crisp, emotional dual lead near the final chorus. \"Blood Brothers\" is hard not to enjoy for its folksy swagger, though it does take a few minutes to really pick up into its string section. But for that final, sailing chorus, it is entirely worthwhile. \"The Mercenary\" is one of the tracks that was originally written for Virtual XI but ended up here. It's not the best song on this album, but I have to wonder, why the HELL was this not included on the predecessor since it clobbers anything on that album many times over.\n\nDitto for \"Dream of Mirrors\", which is supposedly co-written by Blaze Bayley. Not a great track, and certainly not enough good riffs to support its bloated 9+ minute bulk, but still would have amped up Virtual XI a little, and I can even mentally hear Blaze's vocals. \"The Fallen Angel\" has a killer lead-in riff which brings me back to a song like \"Be Quick or Be Dead\", but then surges into a solid mid-paced majestic rhythm which makes you want to swill your mug and then smash it off someone's head. The vocal hook in the pre-chorus is extremely cool, and the chorus does not disappoint as the guitar melody begins to dance below it. \"The Nomad\" is another track from a few years before, and while it has some great atmosphere, mystic leads and vocal climaxing courtesy of Bruce's weathered throat, we have another case where the 9 minutes isn't entirely justified through the actual music. \"Out of the Silent Planet\" is based loosely on some pulp sci-fi stories (like the C.S. Lewis novel of the same name, and the classic film Forbidden Planet), and features some great speed metal licks when it picks up the pace from its sobering, psychedelic intro. The chorus here is yet another killer, though obvious. \"The Thin Line Between Love and Hate\" is probably the only longer track here does itself justice, with a slow escalation towards the climactic chorus, where the standard rhythm falls out for some thrusting drums and emotional screaming. The song serves as a pseudo-biography for the band's separation in the 90s.\n\nBrave New World has a very bold production which also separates it from the band's prior recordings, but I have mixed feelings on this as I loved the old 80s sound. It's got a punchier edge to the guitars and feels more 'digital', but the melodies carry through gracefully and it certainly delivers if you've got good listening equipment. Style-wise, the writing does pick up where Fear of the Dark left off, ignoring the blandness of the two albums in between, and I do get confused that the 1992 album gets so much grief when this does not, but I do think this is the better of the two, so with Dickinson and Smith back in the fold they had tagged the clouds once more and were off, writing in the sky.\n\nHighlights: The Wicker Man, The Fallen Angel, Out of the Silent Planet, The Thin Line Between Love and Hate\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nPiece of Mind is the 2nd Iron Maiden album to feature Bruce Dickinson on vocals, the first with Nicko McBrain replacing Clive Burr on the drums, and the source of one of the band's biggest hits, \"The Trooper\". Strangely enough, these days, most of the tracks feel like forgotten gems, due to the fact that so many have been seemingly ignored in the band's live sets for a great many years now. But the bad tastes of band and audience aside, this is easily one of the best of Maiden's entire career, and certainly one of my personal favorites after Somewhere in Time or Powerslave. Each of the 9 tracks are splendid, powerful, melodic metal, and the album as a whole has a more reined in appeal than The Number of the Beast, giving it the slight edge in my opinion.\n\nJust about anything I've ever loved in Iron Maiden's music is here in spades. Wonderful lyrics that reflect upon religion, war, history, science fiction and mythology, drawing on a number of classic sources. More guitar hooks than a bait & tackle shop, and an excellent, crisp tone to boot. An excellent performance out of Dickinson, who had really meshed into the band's landscape by this point. And a production which does not sound to me as if it has aged a single day in 27 years. Add to that the dark atmosphere of emergent NWOBHM gone 'eavy as all hell, and a great if simple cover image featuring the most recognizable mascot in metal music. We have a winner.\n\n\"Where Eagles Dare\" is a sturdy track to open the album, with a lot of shuffle in its step. Twin guitars rambling out a passionate if somewhat predictable rhythm, and lyrics based on the 1967 novel of the same name, which was itself adapted to a film in '68 featuring Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood. The airy nature of the melodies in the bridge makes for a fine if elegaic tribute to the story and the war in which it was fought. \"Revelations\" features one of the most simple and unforgettable verse rhythms of the 80s, with the perfectly placed little bass steps and the beautiful, simmering melodies that transform the tempo into a fist flying rager, and then down into a thoughtful tranquility. The song feels compelling and timeless, as if it could have been written and recorded in the late 60s or 70s and wound up much the same. \"Flight of Icarus\" tells the tale of its titular, tragic Greek character, and was also used a single for this album. It's more of a narrative than the previous tracks, with the riffs structured about the story. And who would ever forget Dickinson's shining chorus vocal?\n\n'Fly, on your way, like an eagle, fly as high as the sun\nOn your way, like an eagle, fly and touch the sun'\n\nAt this point, the hammer drops and the balls fly out of their zippers as Maiden crushes through two of their more pronounced exclamations, beginning with \"Die With Your Boots On\", a self-determination anthem, and a nice little deconstruction of omens and the prophetic bullshit that fuels so much religious nonsense throughout our history. Smith and Harris have some swanky little backup vocals here, and the chorus is just the type of manly expression that makes you want to leap onto a motorcycle, or a horse, or something. A jet ski if you've got it. But people might look at you strangely if you're wearing boots on a jet ski. Speaking of boots, \"The Trooper\" follows, ready to plant both of them, leather and steel, straight up your arse. Basically the ultimate war metal song before there was 'war metal', maybe not as good as \"Disposable Heroes\" but it came first. How many metal fans out there learned their first guitar or bass riff from this song? How many people who don't even like metal music remember this song? How many have covered it? It's an indispensable classic, and just as brilliant as the pageantry requires. Trotting, equestrian guitar rhythms and spiky vocal latitudes, excellent popping bass beneath the lead, and the lead itself...gorgeous.\n\nThe rest of the album is the half that I feel is sadly the more forgotten, but it's no less rapt or impressive. \"Still Life\" has a great melody that charges below the vocals, and Dickinson even has a robotic like tinge to the 'piece of mind' lyric. The dual guitars are brilliant here, especially as they quaff off into the slamming leads, and \"Quest for Fire\" follows suit with an epic hymn about early man and his travails against nature and beast, and the advent of the one thing that would raise them from beasts themselves into a more potent force. Many have pointed out to me that this is a bit of a silly track, but fuck, I'll take Iron Maiden singing about cannibals and dinosaurs any day over Dethklok or 3 Inches of Blood inhaling and exhaling their stale irony. Once again, there are some killer leads here, and a very pulp adventure feeling that is simply too rare in metal.\n\n\"Sun and Steel\" is a hooky melodic samurai tribute with various literary references to the famous swordsman Musashi, and it's another of the tracks here which could easily have fit the decade prior, due to the soaring vocal harmony which could have just as well been Freddy Mercury of Queen. It's an amazing track, one of my favorites even among this lofty crew, and it's a goddamn shame that this didn't take off like \"The Trooper\". I'd kill to hear this one live, and if you've seen them do it...well, don't tell me about it. I've got enough in the world already to envy. \"To Tame a Land\" caps off the album, a morose, wandering epic based on the classic science fiction novel Dune by Frank Herbert. The tiny arabesque rhythms and edgy, warlike atmosphere of the track really fit the contested desert world of Arakkis, and certainly it has to be one of the best tributes (and one of the ONLY tributes) done to this literary masterpiece in all of rock or metal music. The bass and leads are unsurprisingly exquisite here, and though its the longest track here at over 7 minutes, I hardly noticed. Though I consider it my least favorite track on this album, it's still pretty close to perfect.\n\nPiece of Mind is both a hallmark album and a wave of beautiful nostalgia. Old, indeed, but far from irrelevant, as its another essential fragment of the band's Golden Age (1982-1988) which catapulted them to the very top the pack. 1983 was the year of two of the greatest debut albums in all of metal history (Metallica's Kill 'Em All and Slayer's Show No Mercy), but even against those monstrosities, this album still holds its own, and I have a feeling it always will...\n\nHighlights: All of them, but with To Tame a Land at the rear of the marching order.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nSmith and Dickinson have proved throughout the years they are a more than able composing duo. \u2018Flight Of Icarus\u2019 and \u2018Moonchild\u2019 anyone? On Powerslave they were responsible for the not brilliant but still extremely good \u2018Back In The Village\u2019.\n\nHowever they also wrote a rather dull rock tune for Maiden standards, called \u20182 Minutes to Midnight\u2019. I must say I really like the pre-chorus and chorus so in fact there\u2019s only the intro riff and verses I can complain about. Nevertheless it\u2019s one of two tracks from Powerslave (the other one being Losfer Words) which I feel do not live up to Maiden standards. I know millions of fans think otherwise and for years this song was actually the only song from Powerslave which they kept playing live but to this day I still consider it \u2018that hardrock tune\u2019 on that over all classic heavy metal album.\n\nAnyway, I'm glad to have the Beckett cover \u2018Rainbow's Gold\u2019. Just like \u20182 Minutes to Midnight\u2019 it is a rock tune but really so much better. Dickinson truly excels here on the verses, McBrain comes to life on the perfect groove, not to mention the awesome rock riffs which are played to perfection by Maiden\u2019s most famous guitar-tandem. \n\nOn the 12 inch version we also have \u2018Mission From 'Arry\u2019 which is a 7 minute argument the band had about a fucked up drumsolo, a roadie and obviously \u2018some cunt\u2019 who was recording this. It\u2019s actually great to see a band of Maiden\u2019s grandeur having such a sense of humour in sharing these intimate moments with their fans. it\u2019s fun to listen to more than once actually.\n\nAnd the cover? One of the least interesting ones. The lyrics of \u20182 Minutes to Midnight\u2019 were quite good for Maiden and the cover refers to it, but still it isn\u2019t much fun to look at.\n",
        "\n\u2026And if you thought The Trooper was a single which embodied Maiden in crystallised form, here\u2019s \u2018Aces High\u2019! The pace is even higher and Bruce-era Maiden are getting close to the speed and rawness of the Di\u2019Anno days with this tune. What a mixture of two brilliant eras of Maiden I must say. Blistering leads and marvellous harmonies, an outstanding vocal performance by Dickinson (which he unfortunately never could pull off live) and the rhythm section seems inexhaustibly energetic.\nTo this day \u2018Aces High\u2019 remains the most furious Dickinson-era Maiden tune (Moonchild following closely) and therefore an indispensable song from their massive discography.\n\nAs for the Nektar cover. I never fully understood why Maiden choose to just call it \u2018King of Twilight\u2019 when in fact the song consists of sections from two Nektar songs, including \u2018Cryin in the Dark\u2019, which actually is the first half of Maiden\u2019s version. Nevertheless Maiden actually again manage to make drug-laden progrock sound like haunting metal as they did earlier with Jethro Tull. Once again, one of my favourite Maiden B-sides.\n\nThe live version of \u2018Number Of The Beast\u2019 is pretty good (one of the rare live recordings from the world Piece Tour) and released in a time when the world wasn\u2019t already flooded with billion versions already. Nice addition but quite unnecessary since \u2018King Of Twilight\u2019 was already more than enough reason to get this EP.\n\nAs if this wasn\u2019t enough already, we get one of the greatest Eddie drawings as well. What a superb cover. What a marvellous single!\n",
        "\nThe first single coming from Piece Of Mind was the rather laid back yet heavy \u2018Flight of Icarus\u2019. Composed by Dickinson & Smith who had finally discovered how much fun it was for them to compose together. Unlike most of the other songs from the album \u2018Flight of Icarus \u2018 consisted of simple riffs, vocal lines and had an easy accessible pop song structure. A bad thing? Of course not! With musicians like these in their prime pretty much any song sounded great. And even in the hands of others \u2018Flight of Icarus\u2019 would still be a great song because of the catchy main riff and the strong chorus.\n\nHowever the Montrose cover \u2018I\u2019ve Got The Fire\u2019 is a song I often skip. Not because I dislike the tune, but because I prefer the live version with Di\u2019Anno singing. Obviously because Di\u2019Anno had a stronger \u2018rock\u2019 voice (suiting this song much better) whereas Bruce was of course very metal. But mostly because of the live rawness. This version is nice, well produced and sung adequately. I just prefer hearing the raw sweaty version.\n",
        "\nEmpires rise and fall, men age with their gods and kings, stars ignite and contract, asteroid belts continue to hover across the firmament, and through it all, Iron Maiden continues to slog forth relentlessly, bringing their aged and fermented heavy metal to new generations of bright eyed youngsters and those crazy bastards that loved them all along. As of 2006 I cannot say I had any expectations whatsoever from this rusted old tank. They had thrilled me from 1980-1988, flirted with me for a few years beyond that, had me filing for divorce for the latter half of the 90s, had a quick encounter of makeup metal at the turn of the century, and then hung me out to dry once more. A Matter of Life and Death was just another frame of time, as sure as my morning coffee but doubtfully as sweet.\n\nI had felt Dance of Death might function more realistically under the title 'Dance of Dragged Feet', but that album had come and gone without much offense, simply a dull endeavor rather than an outrage. At 72 minutes, this was going to be the longest Maiden album yet, surpassing the numbing duration of The X Factor, and no Derek Riggs cover in sight, instead adorned with a decent piece by comics illustrator Tim Bradstreet. The album has a nice, bright sound to it which I felt was lacking on its predecessor, and this is in part due to the lack of a final 'mastering'. Iron Maiden wanted to stick it straight to your gut, and so they did. It sounds great. But what of the songs?\n\nOnce I finished listening through the first track to this 14th album, \"Different World\", I had at least the impression that they were going to wring out some late inspirational tears as they did with Brave New World. For this track reminds me quite a lot of \"Wicker Man\", with the same emotional ballast and accessible hooks. It's not as powerful, but it will suffice, especially if the rest of the album can carry the torch. I was eager to listen to \"These Colours Don't Run\", partially inspired by the entire Ozzfest/Sharon Osbourne vs. Iron Maiden with hardcore kids and eggs debacle, but blown into a far broader meaning here through the lyrics. Great song title, but the song is little more than average, with a chorus that feels redundant. \"Brighter Than a Thousand Suns\" is a solid enough tune, with some cool guitar melodies that arch beyond Bruce's verses, but I didn't find much in the way of payoff lying in ambush in the nearly 9 minutes of time it took to finish.\n\n\"The Pilgrim\" has one of the band's traipsing folk-like memories shorn off at the neck towards a thrusting rhythm, then morphing into an acceptable, atmospheric chorus with some nice backing vocals. \"The Longest Day\" is powerful and emotional, but riff-wise it's simply not all that meaty, playing its best moments through the chorus guitar melody. \"Out of the Shadows\" is a gently flowing ballad with a few minutes where the chords erupt or the lead shines, but I'll be honest, unless it's being blared right before my ears, I tend to entirely forget its existence. \"The Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg\" was the first single to this album, and again, a couple of minutes of ballad with clean guitars before you get to the metal bits, and those are at least somewhat catchy for the dirty groove of the guitars that spawns the chords. But it doesn't support the 7+ minute length.\n\nAnd from there out, all the songs are pretty long. \"For the Greater Good of God\" is over 9 minutes, and has its highs and lows, though everything aside from the stunning melodic chorus feels redundant with tracks that the band has written in the past. I was excited to see a track called \"Lord of Light\", as this is one of my favorite science fiction novels, from the acclaimed Roger Zelazny. Of course, like \"Childhood's End\" on Fear of the Dark, the song has little in common with the book except for the title, though some of the fiery images in the lyrics might remind one of the characters. Unfortunate! As for the song itself, it slowly escalates into a fairly powerful groove, with Dickinson going off at every opportunity. \"The Legacy\" is another track to start off with acoustic guitars and slowly climb itself up to the actual metal, a tactic the band has used far too many times since their heyday in the 80s. But there is some eventual payoff here, and it's probably one of the better songs overall on the album, like a Maiden prog-rock opus once more over 9 minutes.\n\nOverall, A Matter of Life and Death is not really a matter of life or death...but it damn well sounds good, with perhaps the best production to mine ears since the band's 80s albums that I so fawn over. I feel this another album where much fat could be trimmed down about the actual pork, in particular the excess use of mellow intros which the band needs to just kick in the nuts. Even the better songs don't exactly scream out with replay value here, but there are many pleasant melodies scattered throughout and the performance of Dickinson is nothing to scoff at.\n\nHighlights: Different World, For the Greater Good of God, The Legacy\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nWith Bruce Dickinson flying the coop, Iron Maiden were faced with a dire situation...who could fill this man's shoes? Who would even try? I would have to think that the financial benefits of fronting one of the world's most recognizable heavy metal bands would certainly bring the roaches out of the woodwork, and in fact Maiden did audition a great many prospective replacements for their infamous second singer. The band had survived the transition from Paul Di'anno to Bruce Dickinson, to be sure, but keep in mind those were the years the band was only beginning to generate buzz, they hadn't grown massive until the 80s, at which point Dickinson was the vocalist many identified with.\n\nObviously the band would be after someone with a professional pedigree, and that person wound up being Blaze Bayley, frontman for the band Wolfsbane who had released a few albums at that point; the first of which, Live Fast Die Fast, was quite a rollicking romp of fist fighting pub speed metal that generated some buzz at the end of the previous decade. The man had a good voice, at least one which fit his band's down to earth, brawling excess, but it was really nothing like Bruce Dickinson, so the decision felt quite controversial. Still, an admirer of his previous band, I took the bus from University after classes the week this was released, and enthusiastically picked up my copy of The X Factor...yes, a not so clever title for the band's 10th full-length album...curious about the use of the model on the cover in place of another Derek Rigg illustration.\n\nWhat I was greeted with when I first played the album, was, well...shock. Not shock that the new singer sucked, or that the band had somehow changed their direction. Shock that even after No Prayer for the Dying and Fear of the Dark, both good but not great albums, the band could not rally up an acceptable set of songs to debut their new singer. Slowly, the latter half of the album started to grow on me, but the first half is almost inaccessibly boring. I'm all for another Maiden epic, but the 11+ minute \"Sign of the Cross\" is simply not a sufficient track to break in this full-length, and from there you've still got numerous tracks to pore through before you arrive at anything bordering on catchy.\n\nThat is correct. I am not blaming this one on Blaze Bayley, who seems to give it all he can, but simply cannot succeed when the music he is fronting is so crushingly mediocre. He's stretching himself out here, taking a more mellow approach than the Wolfsbane material I enjoyed, and his voice does seem to hold together, but it simply incapable of all the peaks and valleys of a Bruce Dickinson. Yet, he's the man with the job.\n\n\"Sign of the Cross\" is not the epic I was looking for, having expected a possibly harder hitting Iron Maiden that would make the proper use of their new hire. It's plodding and dull, all of its best moments arriving when the band either makes the slight, sluggish lean towards warp drive, or provides Dominican-like chanting or some other nuance to distract the listener from how sterile the central riffing is. Why this song has been included in the band's set list for years is far beyond my ability to comprehend, when so many others never made it there. Even this very album has better songs which have gone long ignored. Unfortunately, \"Lord of the Flies\" did not smack the taste out of my mouth, another of the band's Dire Straits-like intro rhythms descending into bland verse riffs that even the pumping of Harris' bass cannot salve. \"Man On the Edge\" doesn't really work either, though it feels a lot more flighty and Maiden, and has that one ascending line in the verse that has you praying for more. Just how do you fuck up a song about a great book/movie like Falling Down and then look yourself in the mirror the following morning?\n\nSadly, the center of the Tootsie Roll is still a few good licks away. \"Fortunes of War\" is another insipid bore, especially the first few minutes while you wait for the stagnant morass to develop into something more...only to be greeted with a slug-a-long that must have taken this band under 30 seconds to compose. After that, \"Look for the Truth\" wastes another few minutes in morose, wasteful balladry before it starts to bare its fangs, and the riffs barely carry it to the level of average. \"The Aftermath\" is a little better, but honestly, even these riffs feel stretched out and completely lacking in any inspirational melody, just a simple hard rock rhythm which sounds nearly as neutered as anything prior, with a slightly better written vocal hook. It wasn't until \"Judgement of Heaven\" that I got a song which didn't outright leaden my eyelids and pass me into a dull dreaming. It's not perfect, mind you, but at least the vocals, riffs and leads perk up the attention span, like the sad little melody after 3:30.\n\nFrom here on, the album slowly tries to redeem itself like a slowly evolving beast that exchanges its fins for webbed feet to travel quick along the banks of mud at the edge of the primordial swamp. \"Blood On the World's Hands\" has some decent jamming moments, and a passable atmosphere resounding beneath some of Blaze's more powerful intonations. \"The Edge of Darkness\" feels largely like a classic Maiden track, though you've once again gotta get past a boring and predictable escalation to get to the meat. \"2 A.M.\" again assumes we want the dull intro with the clean guitars, like almost every song on this album, but builds into Bayley's catchiest vocal hook on the album, the 'Here I am again' sequence, and another cute little lead at around 3:00. \"The Unbeliever\" is the other 'epic' track here, just over 8 minutes, but it's vastly more memorable than \"Sign of the Cross\", not as long or torturous.\n\nIs it too little, too late? Yes it is. Thanks to the CD technology, it's not so hard...and in this case, always tempting to just click >>| >>| >>| up until about track 7, in order to save nearly 40 minutes of my life from the sucking drain that grants one entrance to this 70+ minute monstrosity of stagnant sewage. And for all I might sing in favor of some of the album's later tracks, there are still none I would find worthy of any 'greatest hits' list when shuffling tracks about an .mp3 player or making a mix for an aspiring Maiden-head. It's almost as if the fan's negative, precognitive reaction to hearing a new album without their lord and master Bruce Dickinson not only psychically willed this album the chart lower than many of its predecessors, but also sapped the life energy directly from the band.\n\nOddly enough, then, that this is NOT the worst Iron Maiden album...\n\nHighlights: turn over enough rocks and you might found two or three, later in the search.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nThe 90s sure were a hard time for metal bands. With the rise of grunge and nu-metal the old bands were cast aside. The old metal was somehow fading away and most 80s bands tried different styles, and so did Iron Maiden. Besides their vocalist replacement, which probably needs no further explanation, they obtained a very dark sound for this album. I hear complaining about the production, though I think it was done on purpose since it really fits the dark atmosphere the album contains, and so does new vocalist Blaze Bayley\u2019s voice.\n\nWe are here at the beginning of this Iron Maiden album, listening to the very silent intro of \u201cSign of the Cross\u201d. After some Gregorian chanting we have the bass guitar playing a gentle intro, as we are used to on the more recent Iron Maiden releases, accompanied by Blaze\u2019s almost whispering vocals. When finally after a minute or so the band kicks in it becomes clear that the band have tried something different from the past. It\u2019s still true trademark Maiden, but then with a different and darker touch. The rest of the opening song continues to be very epic, and the long interlude might seem confusing at first, but evolves into something very enjoyable at second. I first wondered why the hell this mid-paced long song would be the album opener, but then I realized this song was the definition of The X Factor. Lots of songs on this album feature a silent bass guitar intro, Blaze\u2019s whispers during the intro and the epic vocal melodies when the band kicks in. Most songs are very dragging and mid-paced as well, such as \u201cThe Aftermath\u201d or the first part of \u201cFortunes of War\u201d. Apart from that, \u201cSign of the Cross\u201d is just a great way to open the album, also to tell the listener that he should stop expecting \u201cThe Trooper\u201d-kind of songs on here, because they\u2019ve done something new. The lyrics are mostly about war and related themes, but instead of concentrating on the battlefield, they tell the tale about what war does to the soldier. Their lyrics are really striking and show them it\u2019s not very much fun to be in a war. Not that we didn\u2019t already know that, but we don\u2019t realize what our boys are sacrificing for us on that battlefield, and that is very unique.\n\nLet\u2019s get into the album highlights a bit more. Songs like \u201cFortunes of War\u201d and \u201cThe Edge of Darkness\u201d start off with the trademark bass intro, then kick into a mid-paced epic full band part, and then go off fast into the trademark Maiden galloping rhythms with the guitar solos and their trademark legato guitar themes. These two songs, especially the latter, are truly two of the best songs off the album, leaving me struck not only by the epic music, but also by the great lyrics. The latter was based on one of the best movies I ever saw, Apocalypse Now. Another highlight of the album would be the up-tempo \u201cMan on the Edge\u201d, which really stands alone on here, since it\u2019s the only continuously fast song on this release. It deals with suicide, and besides from that it\u2019s got a true killer riff, killer drums, killer vocals and killer chorus. It\u2019s a real killer song, so to say. It\u2019s full of energy, and that\u2019s what this album could use at some moments. Also worth mentioning would be \u201cLord of the Flies\u201d. Though starting off with a weird sort of riff complemented with very stylish bass guitar and drums, it evolves soon enough into a relatively fast mid-paced song, with Blaze singing as great as he\u2019s always done and the epic chorus. I this song is truly magnificent and certainly one of the best. I do not wish to describe each song on here separately, but they\u2019re truly all great. Some tend to bore sometimes (\u201cJudgement of Heaven\u201d), but all the others are very beautiful and well-composed. There is, however, one oddity I\u2019d like to discuss. \u201cThe Unbeliever\u201d is closing the album with a very weird progressive 8-minute piece. This song is to this day still a one-of-a-kind Maiden song. It starts off with a nice riff, and then changes to a guitar melody consisting of natural harmonics. Before you know it Blaze is rapping, and then after a sudden speed change we get an atmospheric chorus, which gets repeated a little faster later. The intermezzo is really epic, and at the end we have the previous mentioned parts repeated a few times.\n\nI think the album opens a new chapter to the Iron Maiden era, and then I\u2019m not just speaking of the Blaze Bayley chapter, but also of the progressive chapter. Not that Iron Maiden are progressive, but they certainly try to be in their most recent albums. The songs are longer, have more content and tend to be more complex. The X Factor marks the beginning of that era by having two 8-minute plus songs and a majority of 5-minute plus songs.\n\nHaving said all these things, I think The X Factor is a very good effort by metal legends Iron Maiden. Though often looked at as a failure, I think it is their finest release to date. I would definitely recommend this album to anyone, whether they are familiar with Iron Maiden or not.\n\nStrongest tracks: \u201cLord of the Flies\u201d, \u201cMan on the Edge\u201d and \u201cThe Edge of Darkness\u201d.\n\nhttp://thecryreviews.blogspot.com/\n",
        "\nIron Maiden hit a brick wall when they released their 8th full-length No Prayer for the Dying, because the world was moving on and it was pretty obvious that the boys had no intention of keeping up with it. And should they have even tried? Part of me wants to say, fuck no. Granted, this was the same year Judas Priest released Painkiller, which I would argue did in fact 'keep up with it'. Yet, rather than a heavier, more forceful Maiden, they kept the status quo. I had already mentioned that I felt Iron's 'dating' had begun with Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, and this album furthers that theory, but regardless of what I or anyone else might say about its lack of wall to wall arena-stunning anthems, the fact is that No Prayer for the Dying is not really a 'bad' entry into their catalog. It comes and goes, with a few pretty good songs (some of which even entered their live program), and doesn't necessarily leave a foul aftertaste in the mouth. Only a craving for more, and better...\n\nBut the advent of Viagra aside, just how many bands could 'keep it up' as long as Maiden did in the 80s? I think it's asking a little much, but since Seventh Son of a Seventh Son was so loved, expectations were huge for this, and honestly it just wasn't bound for success in a metal scene that was producing efforts like Painkiller or Rust in Peace in the very same year. Though I have my doubts that it might have turned out much differently, this is the first album on which Janick Gers (White Spirit) had joined the band, being asked to replace the departing Adrian Smith, after he had worked with Dickinson on his first solo album. I honestly didn't notice a different, though clearly Gers and Dave Murray in tandem had a more driving rhythm than past (and future) Maiden albums.\n\n\"Tailgunner\" is a strong opener to the album, in part because it's one of those soaring rhythmic tracks that feels like a natural spiritul sequel to something like \"Aces High\", \"2 Minutes to Midnight\" or \"Where Eagles Dare\". The bridge is quite good, with crashing grooves beneath the racing dual melodies, and it's honestly one of Maiden's heavier tracks of the 90s. I'm not entirely fond of \"Holy Smoke\", though its got a more barroom brawl mentality than many of the band's other songs, and there are still a few worthwhile melodies in there, plus a filthy delivery courtesy of Dickinson. The title track only skirts on being memorable, due to the light synth melody that slowly builds to the climax. It's the type that you'll remember as you're listening, but simply not wish to listen to independently of its environs. I really enjoy the little guitar melody right around the minute mark of \"Public Enema Number One\", and the entire song delivers more than several others you'll find here, with a little choppy guitar harmony section that introduces the fairly scathing lead guitar.\n\n\"Fates Warning\" is not a song I think much about, partly because the guitar rhythm reminds me much of \"Chains of Misery\" from the following album Fear of the Dark, and I liked that one a little more. However, the vocal performance is pretty passionate, and it's not unpleasant to sit through by any means. Though \"The Assassin\" is plucky and keeps a busy rhythm due to the little guitars that grind off to counter the central rhythm, the chorus is somewhat underwhelming and it's not a favorite here. Ditto for \"Run Silent Run Deep\", though it has a nice savage pace and a song about submarines was probably inevitable for Iron Maiden.\n\nAs mixed as my feelings may be for much of the album thus far, I actually really enjoyed the final three tracks on No Prayer for the Dying, all of which stand out the most to me after two decades. \"Hooks in You\" is pure kickass rock & roll, with a nice jangling rhythm around the verse, and a really killer chorus that you simply can't ignore...for both Dick's fun delivery and the actual lyrics themselves:\n\n'Hooks in you, hooks in me, hooks in the ceiling for that well hung feeling\nNo big deal, no big sin, strung up on love I got the hooks screwed in'\n\nI appreciate the duality here, between the smutty S&M and the wider implications of any relationship. I also love the ringing, old school guitar on the bridge over Dickinson's moodier vocals, took me right back to Somewhere in Time. \"Bring Your Daughter...to the Slaughter\" needs little introduction, as it wound up the most successful song on the album, worming its way into the hearts of fans and a staple in Maiden's live rotation for many years. And for good reason...the vocals are extremely infectious, as is the moody, Billy Idol-like gothic rock atmosphere of the verse, and the big R&B-gone metal chorus. It's like the next best thing to \"White Wedding\". And though it's the most 'far out' track on the album, \"Mother Russia\" does much to evoke the natural, hammer and sickle rhythms of that territory, and it's great that Dickinson and crew aren't trying to totally take the piss out of the formerly 'feared' capital nation of Soviet Union, but celebrating the chance it now had to return to its roots.\n\nAs you can see, No Prayer for the Dying does deliver...it's just that the milkman has brought you skim since they were all out of whole milk. Tasty, refreshing and light, but it's not going to fill your belly or satisfy that craving alongside those chocolate chip cookies. There's no reason to dwell on it or direct much dissatisfaction when there are such staggering disappointments on the late 90s horizon.\n\nHighlights: Tailgunner, Hooks in You, Bring Your Daughter...to the Slaughter, Mother Russia\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nFear of the Dark is the 9th album of UK heroes Iron Maiden, and in my opinion the best they would release in the 90s. It's one of the band's longer efforts, clocking in at nearly an hour, with a dozen tracks, most of which are at least catchy, if not entirely at the level of the previous decade. The album compensates slightly for its predecessor No Prayer for the Dying, which seemed to thrive on filler, with only a few truly memorable tracks, but Fear of the Dark too seems to take the same excess tongue lashing from fans. It's a little more rock than the previous albums, and about half the songs are laid back and accessible (this might explain some of the loathing), but I'm honestly surprised that a few of them haven't been given a little more attention through the band's set lists over the years.\n\nThis was the last album before Bruce Dickinson would split from the band and be replaced by Blaze Bayley for Maiden's most miserable albums, but this possibility was not set in stone at the time, so there is no sense of emergency or desperation here. It's just business as usual, with the same penchant for catchy guitar melodies, carefully crafted leads that never hinge on excess, busy bass that feels central to so many of their compositions, and a top shelf performance from Dickinson. And in 1992, a year in which death and black metal were still taking off, and 'alternative music' and grunge rock were the orders of the day, Fear of the Dark feels somewhat like refreshment, from a band that many people were probably tiring of as they turned towards the next shiny audio bauble. Among such shifts in trend, the album often feels like a statement that the guard will NOT be changing via metal's highly successful dignitaries...oh, what sweet irony!\n\n\"Be Quick or Be Dead\" is a fine opener to the album, a fast and memorable track which recalls the uncouth power and ribaldry of something like \"The Trooper\" or \"Aces High\". Dickinson spits some of his nastier vocals, with a clipped pitch to his voice that sounds like he had just dialed the Beast's number again and was feeling slightly possessed. I enjoy the riffs, I enjoy the way the vocal echoes off in the chorus, and the verse rhythm is pure old 80s barbarity. It's followed \"From Here to Eternity\", which feels a little like a Dire Straits or ZZ Top track at first, with a decent hard rock kick to the verse and then another obvious chorus with backup vocals that felt a little like AC/DC. This wound up being one of the more popular tracks from the album, at least so much that Maiden would include it on live shows and albums, and I have to say that I'm somewhat less impressed by this than numerous other pieces on the album. Another of the staples is \"Afraid to Shoot Strangers\", which is a cooler tune with a morose intro section laden in subtle synths and flowing, catchy clean guitar melodies. It feels like a lullaby about the Gulf War gone wrong, but the chorus remains quite atmospheric due to the guitar line that weaves through it, and the track does pick up for some solid driving metal.\n\n\"Fear is the Key\" has a thundering step to it that feels a lot like a rambling Zeppelin rhythm, but I personally enjoy the vocals here and the message of lost rebellion and youth. The mystical wall of melody that opens and recurs through the track is also quite nice. \"Childhood's End\" sadly doesn't seem based upon the fantastic Arthur C. Clarke science fiction novel, instead a lament for the poor and suffering of the world. However, it's probably my favorite track on this album, with glorious, cascading melodies that storm behind Dickinson's highly memorable chorus line (though the lyrics are rather weak). Very surprised this song did not take off and become a single or a live standard. Had \"Wasting Love\" come out a few years earlier, it might have run headlong against popular hard rock power ballads like \"I'll Remember You\", \"Heaven\" or \"Fly to the Angels\", but here it feels a little cheesy until the chords crash in.\n\nThe latter half of the album begins with \"The Fugitive\", an average song with some of the similar, simple and expressive chords that Maiden used to make a name for themselves in the decade prior. Not sure if the lyrics were inspired by the book or film, but alas, they're pretty weak, though the progression of the song does seem to build an urgency that might be shared by one on a run from whatever institution is narrowing in on him, and there's a cool groove buried after 3:30 where the solo begins. I found \"Chains of Misery\" rather amusing, for all its swagger, vocal hooks and the little guitar fills in the pre-verse and chorus. \"The Apparition\" seems a little too light hearted, or playful, but the riffs aren't all that bad and it has a nicely wailing solo with some melodies catapulting beneath it, alongside the bass.\n\n\"Judas Be My Guide\" is a hidden gem, with excellent, flowing guitar melodies that recall the same fire that I loved about so much earlier NWOBHM, simple and blues-based and scurrying off into the night. The chorus is fantastic, not unlike something from an early Queensryche album. \"Weekend Warriors\" is one of the most loathed tracks on the album, an homage to football hooligans which I also felt could be about corporate paintball matches...but either way, it's acoustic opening makes it sound like a Traveling Wilbury's song, and then it rocks out like mid-80s party Priest. In fact if I close my eyes I could almost envision Halford sharing the vocals here just they did on \"The One You Love to Hate\". Maybe they should try it some time! The chorus is really not all that bad, and in fact this is not one of the least memorable tracks on the album, so I believe the negativity leveled at it is slightly blown out of proportion. Though believe me, the last thing I want is an Iron Maiden that sings about sporting events. The 7+ title track serves as the finale to the album, and though it's not bad either, it simply isn't one of the most striking tracks in my opinion, so naturally it becomes the one Maiden plays most in their sets and live albums. Go figure.\n\nFear of the Dark is nowhere near as lousy as the fans and media of the day tried to spin it, they were simply too busy with their tongues and noses up Kurt Cobain's rear to realize that it's just another Maiden album, with a bunch of good songs that, while not about to set the record straight, have a lot of appeal for me even after nearly two decades. The lyrics are among the band's weakest, and there are a few songs that could be clipped. But this is certainly stronger than No Prayer for the Dying, the humdrum X Factor or the abominable Virtual XI, and I listen with anticipation to at least half the songs every time I hearken back to it.\n\nHighlights: Be Quick or Be Dead, Childhood's End, Chains of Misery, Judas Be My Guide\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nFlight 666 was a 2009 documentary film directed by Scott McFayden and Sam Dunn, who you may be familiar with through their previous documentaries Global Metal and Metal: A Headbanger's Journey. If you haven't yet had the chance to see this, you should, if only for the great HD video and surround sound. Granted, it's no Anvil!: The Story of Anvil or Metallica: Some Kind of Monster, but it's not intended to be, instead focusing on the band's performances. And fuck, if all these other bands are getting the documentary treatment, why not Iron Maiden?\n\nOf course, this is another of those 'Fuck Corporate America!' snafus, as the Somewhere Back in Time tour was rolled out alongside the pitiful, worthless compilation of the same name, and the band has also decided to profit off a 2CD live album, instead of just including that solely with the DVD itself and letting everyone's pockets rest. But, of course, this sort of excess is always available to the rich and storied artists of our music industry, and the best way to counteract is to vote with your wallet. And in this case, I think that's the due course, because the only way I feel you should really experience this is by seeing the actual documentary, watching the band perform in all of these great locations (Mumbai, Tokyo, Sydney, Buenos Aires, Toronto, and...New Jersey, among others). Not only the live performances are worthwhile, but there are many snippets of the band in between, at bars, in flight, and with the travails of rock stardom playing out on them (though not to the extent that a Hetfield - Ulrich verbal catfight ensues).\n\nBut you're not getting all of that here, no...you are simply getting 17 live tracks, most of which have already appeared on previous live albums, only this time they're being cast at you from all over the wide world. The band have wisely stuck with older material for this...in fact, I was stunned by the presence of only a single track from beyond the band's Silver and Golden Ages of material, and that would be \"Fear of the Dark\", performed in Buenos Aires\". The rest are all veritable classics, from all of the band's first seven albums except Killers, which is unfortunate.\n\nThe crowd on this double live album can grow pretty loud, after all these are huge dates with rabid fans from all over Gods know where, but they're not enough to smother the highlights here. For Disc 1, these include the ol' one-two combination of \"Aces High\" and \"2 Minutes to Midnight\", which the band follow with \"Revelations\" and \"The Trooper\". Yes, the first four songs that were also performed on Live After Death, with a re-ordering of the 3rd and 4th. The irony is not lost upon me. Also great here are the performances of \"Can I Play With Madness?\" from Mexico City and \"Wasted Yeras\" from Monterrey. Disc 2 likewise starts with a band, after all, how can you go wrong with \"Powerslave\" or \"Heaven Can Wait\"? \"Moonchild\" and \"Run to the Hills\" are also strong points here, and almost all of the tracks on this disc are from South American tour dates, aside from the closing \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\" from Toronto.\n\nFlight 666 certainly sounds excellent, but the advent of the actual documentary film makes this slightly less valuable in my eyes than a standalone live effort. I can't think of any advantage to owning this album when all of the songs are already available on other live offerings, at least no advantage over sitting down with the family or friends on the sofa to experience the DVD in all its 5.1 surround sound glory and HD video. If you feel like digging deeply into your pockets beyond the DVD to throw more money at these guys who obviously need it, well maybe you'll proudly pop the soundtrack into your collection. McFayden and Dunn have done a decent job with the film, perhaps a lot less biased than their prior ensemble documentaries which feature some questionable interviews, but the soundtrack feels like unnecessary excess fat to turn up some additional pocket change.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nBecause two live albums were not enough for 1993, Iron Maiden also decided to release a 2CD set covering their performance from the 1992 Monsters of Rock festival, recorded in August at Donington. Granted, the nearly 2 hour set captured here is more substantial than either A Real Live One or A Real Dead One, and since Fear of the Dark had been the most recent studio offering, we escape the imminent nightmare of the next few albums. But Live at Donington suffers for another reason...the sound is just not that great. And the vocals seem a little strained, even as early as the first track I feel like Dickinson is about to lose his voice.\n\nI don't know if he smoked a few packs that day, or if he was recovering from a bad cold or perhaps the onset of bronchitis, but Bruce seems a little off during certain parts of \"Be Quick or Be Dead\", which opens the first disc. It might also be that he seems a little softer in the mix than some of the band's other live albums. I wouldn't call it a deal breaker, as it's not a terrible performance, but that and the rather sterile feel to the guitars and excess plunkiness of the bass have me leaning towards the studio version. Luckily there are far better sounding tracks on this recording.\n\nI'll admit, the selection of songs here is pretty well spread across the band's discography up to this point. Fear of the Dark is given a healthy representation with \"Afraid to Shoot Strangers\", \"From Here to Eternity\", \"Wasting Love\", \"Fear of the Dark\", and the aforementioned \"Be Quick or Be Dead\", all on the first disc. Of these, none sound truly fresh or invigoration on Live at Donington due to the lackluster sound, but I'd go with \"Fear of the Dark\" from this lot. No Prayer for the Dying gets two tracks in the set: \"Tailgunner\" and \"Bring Your Daughter to the Slaughter\", and Seventh Son of a Seventh Son is in good hands with \"The Evil That Men Do\", \"The Clairvoyant\" and \"Can I Play With Madness?\" Again, they all sound a little sterile, but at least the crowd interaction for \"Bring Your Daughter...\" brightens up the recording, if a little.\n\nThis is yet another live recording where the band's best album Somewhere in Time is mis-represented, with only \"Heaven Can Wait\" on the track list. I really don't get it...surely the band could not have been burnt out by this point on all the majesty of that masterpiece. Was it some kind of conspiracy between the band and an ignorant fanbase whose letters and rash opinions helped determine the set list? Hogwash! Powerslave and Piece of Mind are also snubbed here with one track each: \"2 Minutes to Midnight\" and \"The Trooper\". The Number of the Beast is given much more lavish attention, with the title track, \"Run to the Hills\" and \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\", and the Di'anno years provide \"Iron Maiden\", \"Sanctuary\", and \"Running Free\", all of which are pretty obvious selections. Most of this is confined to the 2nd disc, and the stronger pieces here were \"Wasting Years\", \"2 Minutes to Midnight\" and \"Running Free\" for the good crowd service.\n\nThe biggest issue with Live at Donington is of course the fact that it feels redundant after two other live albums being released just months before. But it also really pales in comparison to the band's hallmark Live After Death (after which no subpar live offering should have been issue unless it was a cheap grab for more money). The track list, while thorough enough to include something from all of their albums to this point, also feels a little redundant. Had there been a few unexpected surprises among the selections, it might have offset the rather bleak tones off the mixer, but I'd imagine the band feels the need to rifle out the hits for all the casual fans that want them, and the rest of us can just dust off that 1985 LP and ignore this.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nThis EP was released in the same month Bruce Dickinson joined Maiden. Could this be the reason the band or label decided not to release a full length live album? They had the whole gig recorded and as some of us know now (they were released for fan club members in 1999 and on bootleg in 2008), it sounds killer and it would have been a remarkable live album. Never since has Iron Maiden played so fast and furious since then. Di\u2019Anno was rawer than ever and Clive Burr really picked up the pace.\n\nSo was it really because Di\u2019Anno was thrown out that only a few songs were released in September 1981? Because what would be the point of releasing (investing in) a full length album and promoting it as such when it features a vocalist who had just been thrown out? I\u2019ve read the original cover featured Eddie holding Di\u2019Anno\u2019s decapitated head. I also read they released this EP purely because of Japanese demands. And I\u2019m glad they did!\n\nAnyway, at that time we didn\u2019t know any better. We all thought they maybe recorded just a few songs, or maybe something went wrong with the other recorded songs, technically or whatever. And we were left with 4 (on some releases 5) extremely good live performances. We already had live versions of \u2018Wrathchild\u2019 and \u2018Remember Tomorrow\u2019 on the Rainbow VHS and \u2018Running Free\u2019 isn\u2019t exactly the most rare Maiden song. \n\nGreat performances nevertheless with \u2018Remember Tomorrow\u2019 being a real gem. But what makes this specific release worth getting is the rather rare live recording of \u2018Innocent Exile\u2019. A song which hasn\u2019t been played live since that tour ever again as far as I know.\n\nBecause of the pace, energy and the broad live sound, the songs from the debut album sound much better here and are reason enough to get your hands on this EP. Add to this a rare live recording of \u2018Innocent Exile\u2019 and \u2018Killers\u2019 with the correct lyrics (the story about the version on the Rainbow VHS is hilarious) and you\u2019ll understand we have a must-have here from Maiden's Di\u2019Anno days.\n",
        "\nI could do two things here. Either I start talking about the brilliance of these two songs or I could start bashing the band for releasing nothing new. I\u2019ve decided to do both but give points based on the latter.\n\nI personally think Purgatory is actually the best song from Killers. No other song on the album has this amount of speed, energy and catchiness all put together into one song. And whereas the earlier \u2018Transylvania\u2019 on their debut was already great, \u2018Genghis Khan\u2019 is yet another instrumental masterpiece on which there is more room this time for Clive Burr to excel. So if I were to talk only about the songs here, this single is simply mind blowing and would've gotten 99 points from me.\n\nHowever. Releasing two regular album tracks over 4 months after the album makes me frown. Of course it\u2019s always nice to have yet another Derek Riggs painting so only for real Maiden collectors it would be worth tracking down an original copy. But for all other people, just get Killers and leave this for what it is.\n",
        "\nJust as we were getting used to Maiden providing us with great B-sides being live versions or rare songs, we are left here with just an original A-side. \u2018Twilight Zone\u2019 is a song which originally would have been a regular song on Killers (it can also be found on the American promo 12\u201d) but was omitted eventually.\n\n\u2018Twilight Zone\u2019 is a mix of Iron Maiden more rock-orientated material such as \u2018Drifter\u2019 and \u2018Running Free\u2019 with their already crystallised heavy metal sound. Honestly, I always wished they had put this song on Killers instead of that awful \u2018Prodigal Son\u2019. The haunting chorus of \u2018Twilight Zone\u2019 is true classic Maiden and could have suited any Maiden album.\n\nNow, I can be wrong but wasn\u2019t this single released a month after the release of Killers? If so, I really see no use to include a regular album track as a B-side. A bit of a bummer so the only reason to get this EP is because of the A-side and the cover, which once again is a nice addition to any Derek Riggs\u2019 collection even though the girl\u2019s face and neck are rather masculine.\n\nSo 90 points for one great song and artwork, huge deduction for filling up the single with just an album track.\n",
        "\nOf all the rare songs and non-album tracks from the Di\u2019Anno era \u2018Invasion\u2019 is one of my favourites. In contrast to songs like Sanctuary, Twilight Zone and Burning Ambition, \u2018Invasion\u2019 is even more compact but embodies what early Iron maiden were about in a compressed form. All elements are there including hooks, melodies and changes in pace.\n\nJust like \u2018I\u2018ve Got The Fire\u2019 earlier, Iron Maiden take the chance to make a rock song sound metal. This time we\u2019ve got the Shyhook\u2019s cover \u2018Women In Uniform\u2019 which once again sounds perfect in the hands of Maiden. Di\u2019Anno\u2019s voice is capable of singing metal as well as real raw rock. The leatherclad video (with Dennis Stratton already feeling out of place here) still is fun to watch after all these years.\n\nAnd what can we say about the live version of \u2018Phantom Of The Opera\u2019. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I like a lot Nicko McBrain has done for and with Maiden but this song only sounded perfect and fast enough in the hands of Clive Burr. Here we can really hear how good this boy actually was and the extra drive he could give this band.\n\nThere is not a single bad note here, the performance is stellar and all songs are great. Everything just makes sense and I still feel the need to pick up the needle and play the EP again after all these years. One of my all time favourite Maiden EP\u2019s and not without reason.\n",
        "\nThe First Ten Years: Part VIII\n\nWasted Years/Stranger in a Strange Land is the 8th EP in the First Ten Years collection, featuring both of the band's 1986 singles for the phenomenal album Somewhere in Time. It's one of the more valuable selections of singles in the series, because each of these two songs is complemented with 2 tracks that you won't find on any of the band's albums. However, I wouldn't say the non-album material is the best quality. Much of it originates from The Entire Population of Hackney project the band members did with a few of their peers from other NWOBHM bands, in which the Maiden members wrote some of the songs, as did the other members.\n\nAside from its excellent title track, the Wasted Years single includes \"Reach Out\", a hard rock song written by Dave Colwell, who was in the band FM in addition to joining Adrian Smith's ASAP project later on. He was also a member of The Entire Population of Hackney. This track is a little more mainstream than one expects from Maiden, though it does have some of the band's classic dual melodies and a decent atmosphere. But what is most curious about the song, is that features Adrian Smith on the lead vocals (Dickinson provides some backups). And as far as a bluesy hard rock singer of the Coverdale camp, Smith is really not all that bad...though the lyrics are pretty trivial and typical of bad 80s rock. \"The Sheriff of Huddersfield\" is a goofy tribute to manager Rod Smallwood's life in Los Angeles, set to music which, while not horrible, feels like it did not take long to compose (though there are some melodies in there).\n\nThe B-sides for Stranger in a Strange Land are two more tracks from members of The Entire Population of Hackney. \"That Girl\" is actually quite strong, an old FM track, with typical Maiden triplets and a subtle melodic picking, and a fine performance from Dickinson. The lyrics are once again tripe at the level of 80s glam rock radio, about as compelling as those of \"Reach Out\", but musically this is probably the best bonus of the EP. \"Juanita\" feels like a \"Cat Scratch Fever\" type riff with some of Maiden's brazen melodies, Bruce giving it his dirtiest rocking vocals, and it's not that bad, with the least annoying lyrics of the three bonus tracks from Adrian Smith's associates (this track being the cover of a band called Marshall Fury).\n\nThe \"Listen With Nicko!\" segment for this EP is a little hard to follow, as he bounces back and forth with his anecdotes and you don't get a very clear picture of what all the bonus tracks are all about, but it's one of the longest at over 12 minutes and there are a few interesting stories, in particular about Rod Smallwood and \"The Sheriff of Huddersfield\". After the Can I Play With Madness?/The Evil That Men Do EP, this is probably the most valuable (outside of the obvious collector factor and the voucher for the box set) because you get three good non-album tracks. Granted, the lyrics are not at the Maiden level, but it's fun to hear other projects these guys were involved with, even if they were just intended for a few lives.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nUntil about two years ago, I thought of Iron Maiden as a completely overrated band that only owed their success to the fact they were around early enough. Sure, The Number of the Beast and Run to the Hills were decent songs, but to call Maiden one of the best bands in the world\u2026 At one point, I even bought The Number of the Beast album. But two weeks later I gave it away to my little brother. Iron Maiden didn\u2019t interest me at all. Until one day, my other brother had one the Somewhere Back In Time best-off album. He had participated in the game for the thrill of winning, not because he liked Iron Maiden. So he gave the album to me. And I gave it a spin. And another one. And another one. At that point, I suddenly was captured by the music, and I could understand why Maiden is one of the most famous heavy metal bands out there. \n\nSomewhere Back In Time only has Bruce Dickinson on vocals, and except for the change of drummer between Number of the Beast and Piece of Mind the line-up is the same throughout the entire album. Which is a very good thing. A change in line-up may change the sound of the band (compare Iron Maiden until 1988 with post-1988 Maiden: the departure of Adrian Smith clearly had its impact), and this is even more true with the change of vocalists. Only recently, I have dared to listen to Iron Maiden from the Di\u2019Anno and Bayley era. So by making sure all songs are sung by Bruce, the album has a coherent sound and feel. For people like me, unfamiliar with the band, this was assuring and makes it easier to enjoy the album.\n\nTo get Bruce-only songs on the album, songs from live albums are included. Its somewhat awkward to suddenly hear crowds screaming on the best-of studio albums, or to hear a sudden silence on your live album (which of the two is this album?) . There are interludes with screaming fans or sudden silence, breaking the coherency of the album but these different interludes didn\u2019t bother me. The songs themselves, for example Phantom of the Opera are completely free of crowd sounds, so the album could be a studio best-of.\n\nAbout the choice of the songs on the album. The albums covered are from Iron Maiden\u2019s best era, with their most popular songs. I even knew some of those! Number of the Beast and Run to the Hills, as two of their most popular known songs. Further we get mainly paced up songs, songs that are easy to enjoy. The Trooper and Wasted Years, with their catchy riffs and scream-along parts, for example. These two are the only songs of the Piece of Mind and Somewhere in Time albums. Compare this with NotB (four songs) and Powerslave (three songs): the albums are not equally represented on this best-off. But as I said before: the more popular songs were chosen.\n\nThe best-off unfortunately fails to give a good image of the magic contained within epic songs as Rhyme of the Ancient Mariner or To Tame A Land. The listener never realizes there is a link between the songs taken from the concept album Seventh Son of a Seventh Son. But I ended up buying most of their albums and discovering the aforementioned songs and awesome moments. \n\nSomewhere Back In Time is a a very good start for those who don\u2019t know where to start when first discovering Iron Maiden. It provides a good idea of the abilities and creativity of the band. After the first few turns it\u2019s up to the listener to go out and find the full-lengths. Veteran Maiden fans however gain nothing by buying this best-of. But if you already have those great albums in your possession, why would you want to?\n",
        "\nPerhaps it's just that the set list is drawn from most of my favorite Iron Maiden albums and even individual songs. Perhaps its the killer Derek Riggs cover art. Perhaps its the very honest, and fit for its era production standard. For all of these reasons, and more, Live After Death is my very favorite Iron Maiden live experience on disc, and probably ranks as one of my favorite live albums, if not THE favorite, in all of metal. Why, do you say? Is it because I'm old, and perhaps a little biased or clouded with the haze of nostalgia? You could always argue that a little of this plays into any opinion of any decades old recording, but I do in fact believe that this beloved band was on the top of their game in the early to mid-80s, when their imaginations were allowed to run wild and metal music was maturing in general.\n\nIn fact, Live After Death was one of the last albums where Maiden, in my opinion, reigned supreme, before the emerging scenes of speed, power and thrash metal took many of their ideas and ideals and elevated them to the next level of intensity. Now I'm not saying they were the heaviest, or fastest band in the realm, but certainly one of the least compromising bands to be striking gold in the bigger picture, in the Billboard charts or the mainstream rock audience. After the following, masterful full-length Somewhere in Time, I don't think the band has ever been able to recover the crown. They've put out good albums, and good songs, but somewhere around the release of Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, somehow, a levee broke.\n\nNow, Live After Death is still a live album, consisting of tracks you likely already owned in their studio forms, and it does bear that eternal limitation of 'not being there'. And clearly, if you have not had a chance to witness this legendary band in the arena setting, I promise you it is very much worthwhile, something you should probably do before it's no longer possible due to the age of the band. But the sound here is engrossing, with so many of their earlier, darker tracks in the set-list, all of which are memorable and polished. There is a remastered version of this album available from 1998 which features a bonus disc of 5 tracks recorded in 1984 at the Hammersmith Odeon. I am not reviewing that version, just the original album recorded in 1985 at the Long Beach Arena.\n\nThere are 12 tracks, opening with the Winston Churchill speech sample and \"Aces High\", and how could you psyche up a crowd more than that, even if they are American. The song sounds glorious, and the band are quick to follow this up with another Powerslave staple, \"2 Minutes to Midnight\". At this point, ever person in that audience and the inner child of every listener to the album over the next 25 years is screaming THIS WILL FUCKING RULE. And so it does. As if that one-two combo wasn't enough, they next launch into \"The Trooper\", which probably forced much hyperventilation and rioting, as it probably the most recognizable Iron Maiden track up to this point, and sounds raucuous and perfect in this live setting, as if it were simply never meant for anything but the stage. After this, \"Revelations\" is another perfect fit, as the bass wanders beneath the guitars in the verse, and the pace of the track lets the crowd simmer down a little without ceasing the rock.\n\nBut \"Flight of Icarus\" scales straight back up the majestic heights of Dickinson's howling, perhaps the best single live serving of this track I've ever heard, with brazen guitars and pumping bass lines that counteract one another beautifully. After this, they play \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\", and not just a snippet of the track that one might suspect in order to keep up the momentum of the set, but 13 fucking minutes of excellence...including the eerie bridge segment in which the crowd quiets slightly, but somehow transforms into itself into a sound akin to the wind howling over the song's grim, haunted waters, or gulls shrieking about the mast. Not content with just this epic, they next launch into \"Powerslave\", one of Maiden's greatest songs, and it sounds just as intense as you need it.\n\nThus far the set has been dominated by material from Piece of Mind and Powerslave, so for the rest of the show the band dials it back through the years. This begins with \"The Number of the Beast\" and \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\" back to back, both of which excel here with a good balance of uplifting melody and nostalgic grace. Following this, the band's namesake \"Iron Maiden\" as Dickinson works up the crowd, and I'm sad to say that this version of the song, with Bruce on vocals, sounds every bit the match for Paul Di'anno's original, as it swerves into a higher range but delivers just as powerfully through the chorus backing vocals. \"Run to the Hills\" again works the audience into a frenzy, and then the band closes the disc with their classic \"Running Free\", the crowd screaming!\n\nI can imagine driving home after this 'incident', with your heart warmed and mind racing through every mile of just how much you love metal music. Such enthusiasm in those days for the genre, and not just by a marginalized niche of tasteful individuals. Strangely, there is nothing from Killers on this core recording, though the bonus disc version at least includes \"Wrathchild\".\nOther than that, I can't think of a single complaing about Live After Death. It sounds perfect to me even after about 70% of my life has passed, and if there is one live album well worth spending the money to attain, it is this one. Lucky for you, you can pick it up today remastered WITH the five additional tracks on the 2nd disc: \"Wrathchild\", \"22 Acacia Avenue\", \"Children of the Damned\", \"Die With Your Boots On\", and \"Phantom of the Opera\". Even as a diehard purist, it's hard not to think of that as a plus...\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nNormally I would be somebody to complain when a band \u2018fills\u2019 a single or EP with live songs. Especially Metallica and Maiden in later years (nineties) would start to suffer from this. Here however I\u2019m pretty fond of them.\n\nSince 1998 \u2018Sanctuary\u2019 has become a regular track on Maiden\u2019s first album. I myself however only posses \u2018old\u2019 stuff and therefore still consider this to be a lone track in a huge discography. \u2018Sanctuary\u2019 is a pretty powerful track, albeit with lesser impressive riffs than other Di\u2019Anno-era tunes, and it perfectly combines rock with a more flashy metal intensity.\n\nThe live version of \u2018Drifter\u2019 is great because of it\u2019s song-a-long secton. After I first heard this track I kept singing yoyoyoyo for weeks. Yes, that catchy indeed. And this version is slightly more energetic and more raw than the studioversion would turn out to be.\n\nTalking of raw, the Montrose cover \u2018Ive Got The Fire\u2019 perfectly shows how Iron Maiden could turn rock into metal. It\u2019s all right here. The studio version with Dicksinson a few years later (Flight Of Icarus single) was pretty good, but this one shatters all, including the original. The energy here is unequalled. Yes, including the studio song \u2018Sanctuary\u2019 we have one of the rawest Maiden releases from the Di\u2019Anno-era and worth getting your hands on. \n\nFor collectors like myself it has always been worth searching for live recordings with Di\u2019Anno on vocals. There aren\u2019t many and unfortunately the majority of bootlegs from that era sound awful. We, the fans, had to do with this EP, Live+1 and the pretty short Maiden Japan EP obviously (it took \u2018til 1999 for the entire Maiden Japan concert to be released) So each rare live recording from those days is worth getting as far as I\u2019m concerned.\n",
        "\nApart from their earlier Soundhouse tapes here we have Maiden\u2019s first official EP. The choice of songs is obviously not without reason. They already had a big fanbase but they choose to release two of their more rock orientated songs instead of their more groundbreaking material.\n\n\u2018Running Free\u2019 is a simply and catchy rock song with a nice rhythmic groove, courtesy of Clive Burr. Steve Harris is still somewhat holding back but his trademark galloping already shines through. In this song it\u2019s only the smaller details setting them apart from contemporary artist. Those typical melodies and a few nice hooks.\n\n\u2018Burning Ambition\u2019 is a more interesting story. This song was supposedly the first song Steve Harris wrote and because of it\u2019s changes in pace and dynamics his previous band(s) didn\u2019t want to play it. In a way it was this song which made Harris decide to form his own group. The importance of \u2018Burning Ambition\u2019 therefore cannot be denied. But is it a good song? Well, it can\u2019t really compete with most other songs from the pre-Dickinson era and I can understand why it never made it unto a regular album but it still holds up fine despite it\u2019s quite cheesy seventies lead melody. The energetic vocals and tempo more than make up for it. I\u2019m sure in the hands of any other rock band from the seventies this song wouldn\u2019t sound as energetic as it does now. Because of the tempi and raw punky vocals by Di\u2019Anno one can already hear that this band has the ability to make almost everything sound great.\n\nHonestly \u2018Burning Ambition\u2019 is reason enough to get this EP. Not only because of it\u2019s historical importance but also because it shows the extra edge and energy the youthful Iron Maiden could put in their songs, making them sound even better than they already were.\n",
        "\nThe First Ten Years: Part IV\n\nThe fourth EP in the First Ten Years series might possess one of the cooler, joint cover images, but the contents are largely a waste of time. Unlike many of the other releases in the collection, it features only four tracks total, and of these, there is but one song worth hearing. Honestly, there was not much point tracking down Run to the Hills/The Number of the Beast unless you're a completionist who needed the voucher for his boxed set to store the 10 EPs.\n\n\"Run to the Hills\" is a great song, but it's the same song you already own on Number of the Beast. The B-side is \"Total Eclipse\", the only thing noteworthy on this EP, as I had mentioned. It's a decent, dark tune that arguably would have functioned perfectly well on the full-length, but I'm thankful that it exists at all. The Number of the Beast single is a little less enticing, with the title track from the album and a B-side live of \"Remember Tomorrow\" with Dickinson on the vocals (and frankly, I preferred Di'anno to what Bruce does here).\n\n\"Listen with Nicko!\" IV is one of the less monkeyed monologues and has some interesting information about the video for \"Run to the Hills\", but he does start fucking around more in the end. I suppose to some this is the attraction, but I would have preferred something else, even packing 3 original singles onto each EP. The 'spring/mattress' joke is well...miserable. Alas, without \"Total Eclipse\", this would be utter rubbish. Of course, if you want the whole set, you've got to suck it up and take it like a man.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nThe First Ten Years: Part VI\n\n2 Minutes to Midnight/Aces High is the 6th EP release in the First Ten Years collection, and like the Part IX single featuring Can I Play in Madness? and The Evil That Men Do, it benefits greatly from the inclusion of non-album material. Granted, it's not all studio work, but at least it beats B-sides that are straight from albums.\n\nThe original 2 Minutes to Midnight single was releasd in 1984, and in addition to the kickass title track, it includes a studio cover of \"Rainbow's Gold\" from the bands' friends Beckett. This is a very groovy hard rock tune with a little NWOBHM in there, try and imagine a happy medium between Deep Purple and Thin Lizzy, and Dickinson really brings it up to the Maiden level. The other bonus track is \"Mission from 'Arry\", which is not actually music, but a taped argument between Nicko McBrain, Steve Harris and some techs. In a way, I actually prefer something like this to Nicko's narrative tracks, because though it's not extremely valuable, it offers a realistic little snippet of the band at their worst, rather than the forced humor of the bonus monologues included with the EPs.\n\nAlso, from 1984, the Aces High single features another of the very best tracks from Powerslave. For its B-sides, there is a live version of \"Number of the Beast\", and a pair of Nektar covers slapped together under the title of one, \"King of Twilight\" (includes a part of \"Crying in the Dark\"). If you're not familiar with Nektar, well it might be time to check them out, as they were a pretty cool prog rock band featuring a mixed German and English lineup. The Maiden version is tight and powerful, and I really can't stress enough how classy the guys have been throughout their career, picking forgotten gems like this one instead of more obvious covers.\n\n\"Listen with Nicko!\" part six is another 10 minute narrative piece where he goes over the singles, but it's not extremely interesting except where he goes on about the \"Mission from 'Arry\" argument, shedding a little light onto the situation. This EP is really not all that special save for the Beckett and Nektar covers, as the live \"Number of the Beast\" feels somewhat redundant and forced in place of another, more interesting cover or potential B-side, but there are certainly worse in the series.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nIron Maiden's Rock in Rio was recorded in January 2001 at the Rock In Rio festival, Brazil. It could be considered the complementary live to the Brave New World album which featured the reunion of the band with Bruce Dickinson and Adrian Smith, and the inauguration of the band's three-guitar assault (since they kept on Janick Gers). But though it pays great heed to the band's more recent material, with features some unfortunate selections from the mediocre X Factor and downright awful Virtual XI, the album does mix it up with some older songs, and the sound quality is actually quite good. If you want yet another Maiden live set captured to audio, this 2CD set is far from the worst they've offered.\n\nA great choir intro heralds \"The Wicker Man\", which is pretty much the best thing you could hope for to open their set, a sheer ass kicking with an unforgettable chorus that inspires both emotion and fist shaking. Judging by the massive crowd response (which honestly sent shivers up my spine), the Brazilians were WELL into this song by the time Maiden dropped down there for the festival. As they should be, because it rules, and it's one of the best on this entire live. Other tracks from Brave New World include \"The Mercenary\", \"Ghost of the Navigator\", \"Blood Brothers\", \"Dream of Mirrors\" and the title track, all of which the crowd can also relate to. The rest of the newish material is rounded out by \"The Clansman\" from Virtual XI, which, while improved with Dickinson's energy, is still little more than average. \"Sign of the Cross\" is included from The X Factor, not one of the better tracks from that album, and not one of the better tracks on this one.\n\nThe rest of the set list tours the band's already extensive back catalog, with some oldies from the Paul Di'anno days like \"Wrathchild\", \"Sanctuary\", and \"Iron Maiden\". \"The Number of the Beast\", \"Run to the Hills\" and \"Hallowed be Thy Name\" are surefire audience pleasers from The Number of the Beast album, and \"The Trooper\" appears from Piece of Mind. Only \"2 Minutes to Midnight\" arrives to represent Powerslave, and to my huge disappointment, there are no tracks present on this live from Somewhere in Time, which is my absolute favorite... Clearly Harris and crew underestimated the tastes of the Brazilian audience? The final two tracks included are \"The Evil That Men Do\" from Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, and the title track from Fear of the Dark. Like Somwhere in Time, No Prayers for the Dying is ignored, and it's a little sad.\n\nSurely we could have given the boot to \"Sign of the Cross\" and \"The Clansman\" and included two or even three tracks from those neglected efforts. \"Wasted Years\", \"Bring Your Daughter to the Slaughter\" and any other track from Somewhere in Time would have sufficed. Alas, it was not to be, at least for the release of the 2CD set, but at least the rest sound really good, and outside the duo of Live After Death and Maiden Japan, this is one of the better live offerings. Each of the discs is also enhanced with video material, for a little extra bonus. If you're a Maiden fan who rabidly collects their live shows, at least the 'official' releases, you could do far worse than Rock in Rio.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\n...because that's what this seems like. Although having the most famous and most fun Iron Maiden songs on here, the compilation adheres to a strict \"2 songs per album\" rule, which is ultimately the downfall of the compilation and the reason it's a piece of shit. It's as if a computer program picked the two most famous songs from each album then put them together, and this wouldn't really be a problem, except for the fact that the title of this album is \"The Essential Iron Maiden\", not \"A Taste of Maiden\" or something like that. Most of the songs on this compilation aren't essential by a long stretch. The essential Iron Maiden stuff was from the beginning of their long career, and the problem is that great songs such as \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\", \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\", \"Powerslave\", \"22 Acacia Avenue\", \"Children of the Damned\" and more are all deprived of spaces in the compilation while globs of shit that no one cares about occupy them. One other thing that irks me is that two classic songs \"Running Free\" and \"Iron Maiden\" are live versions. Why!? The original studio versions are a lot better and fit much better into a compilation!\n\nDespite all that though, this is still an Iron Maiden release, and the songs are of course, quite awesome regardless. Loud and epic singing, melodic guitar harmonies, powerful and tight drumming and great bass work. The worst parts on the compilation are the Blaze Bayley-era songs. \"Futureal\" is pretty bad, \"Sign of the Cross\" is infinitely boring and \"Man On the Edge\" is painful to listen to (you can tell how hard Blaze is trying to be Bruce, and he fails at it so badly that you have to pity him). The only good Blaze song is \"The Clansman\", which is a calm epic. The best songs are undoubtedly the earlier ones, from pre-1990s Iron Maiden. \"Run to the Hills\", \"The Trooper\" and more are all great and famous songs, but as I said before, SO MANY AMAZING SONGS ARE MISSING.\n\nIf the creators of the compilation had put a little thought into compiling songs, then classic and truly essential songs would liberate their spots from the bland and unwanted musical turds of more recent years. Despite all this, it's still a good listen if this is your first Iron Maiden purchase or if you just want to see what all the fuss is about, and in the end, it's still Iron Maiden, none of the songs are THAT bad. But this is a compilation, not an album, and I'm reviewing the selection of songs and how they fit with the title, and my official conclusion is that this compilation sucks.\n",
        "\nWidely considered a letdown after the popular Seventh Son of the Seventh Son, No Prayer for the Dying often gets dismissed as a lackluster album. Partly it is a return to root, of sorts. It's not a return to the musical roots of the band itself - there are no traces of the punky aggression of the first two albums here - but to the roots of the members' musical influences. In contrast to the soaring metalness and over-reaching theme of Seventh Son, on No Prayer for the Dying we find the band going for a more rockier sound with a jumble of songs with no real links to each other. It is funny that Adrian Smith left the band prior to this album to record hard rock with his own project, A.S.A.P., while Maiden moved towards that direction as well.\n\nThis is very evident with songs like Holy Smoke and Hooks in You (written by the aforementioned Smith prior to his departure and finished by Dickinson). While they don't sound rooted in their time, it's clear with the rise of grunge that this kind of change of pace wasn't the right one if Maiden were looking to score big sales. Both of the aforementioned tracks are simplistic hard rock songs, but the single, Holy Smoke, is pretty much the epitome of that. It's got about three riffs, four if you count the intro melody as one, and two of them, chorus AND verse, are primitive, a chord per bar wallflowers. Fortunately Dickinson's gruff vocals, catchy lines and biting lyrics more than make up for the insipidity of the riffs. You won't even notice it, unless you pay particular attention. \n\nThe song also clearly exhibits the greatest downfall of this album: lazy songwriting. The band lost a member who used to write a great deal for them, especially lately, and now they are throwing everything they got into this album (hell, Bruce had to sacrifice one of his solo songs for it) and sometimes it shows. The song structures are uniform except for the title track and Harris's usual epic closer, Mother Russia. The choruses rely strongly on repetition and the songs on Dickinson's vocal lines to move the songs forward and keep the listener interested. Of course, there's a catchy riff or two for a song, maybe substituted for a lead in some and while they make the songs easier to differentiate from each other, they don't bring enough variation and the songs end up being quite samey. With almost all of them being just a tad longer than four minutes doesn't help.\n\nMaiden seem to have taken an interest in social matters with the lyrics dealing with matters like Televangelism, things (metal) getting scapegoated to gloss over more important matters, religion, the fall of Soviet Union. Of course, they always write from their own bias and point of view that may end up being rather silly, but you take things as they come. The vitriol that Dickinson eschews in Holy Smoke is tangible as is the desperation in the title track and the want to fight even in face of certain defeat that is present in Public Enema Number One. So the shift from Fates Warning to The Assassin seems rather off. After four songs with emotional delivery and lyrics that seem more or less passionate, we get a cheesy rocker about a killer for hire that Dickinson sings with the conviction of a first time karaoke participant. It is followed by three songs with little seriousness to them, but at least Dickinson's performance picks up on Run Silent, Run Deep and Bring Your Daughter. It feels like the band was going through the motions in a hurry. Not much thought went into the arranging of the album nor into the songwriting itself so it is no surprise listeners feel a little letdown by it. But songs like No Prayer for the Dying, Public Enema Number One or Mother Russia makes this album worth a spin every now and then.\n",
        "\nThe First Ten Years: Part IX\n\nThe 9th EP released in the First Ten Years series is perhaps the one I found the most valuable in the entire spread, because the B-sides for both Can I Play With Madness? and The Evil That Men Do singles are unavailable elsewhere, and also quite good. This is the quality that I would have liked the band to uphold through all singles, or the bare minimum that any band should produce on such a release. I mean, ideally, they wouldn't happen at all, but if you're going to squeeze out a few extra bucks from either fans or non-fans who for some silly reason can't see the benefit in paying a few extra dollars for a full-length, it should be worthwhile.\n\nCan I Play With Madness? is a great, memorable Maiden tune, but the real reasons to acquire this EP come in the form of the \"Black Bart Blues\", which is like this near 7 minute jam section which is actually comprised of great riffing. There are vocals too, but they're actually sort of silly and self-referential towards the song. There is also a Nicko McBrain 'answering machine' in the song, and a bunch of his tomfoolery near the end. In other words, for the first 3-4 minutes, you get a decent Iron Maiden jam loaded with NWOBHM goodness. The other B-side is a cover of Thin Lizzy's \"Massacre\" from the Johnny the Fox album, and like a lot of their covers, is a good choice, and kicks a bit of ass, in particular the spiky little melodies panning out to the side of the mix.\n\nThe Evil That Men Do is likewise a treat, and the title track is another of Seventh Son of a Seventh Son's strongest. But the attraction to this single would have been the Bruce Dickinson-fronted versions of \"Prowler\" and \"Charlotte the Harlot\". Both sound quite excellent in all their modernized glory, with the music itself being streamlined for the Maiden of '88. I'm not trying to infer that they're better than the originals, mind you. I'll always have a soft spot for the Di'anno versions, but if you ARE going to do some remakes for fun, I'd say a single or EP is a good place to allocate them. Of the two, I think I liked \"Prowler '88\" a little more.\n\n\"Listen With Nicko!\" begins more with a little more flatulence than the previous entries to the monologue, and as he usual he talks about the charting of the singles. He also pays a brief memory to Graham Chapman (the Monty Python comedian who appeared in the \"Can I Play With Madness?\" video but passed away not long after. Basically everything you need to know about the two original singles, and then some...\n\nThis is definitely the biggest treat in the First Ten Years collection, because all four of the bonus tracks from the singles are worth hearing and owning, the possible exception being the dicking around the band does in \"Black Bart Blues\". If you can track them down in one place rather than the constituent singles, why not?\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nThe First Ten Years: Part III\n\nThis is the third release in the First Ten Years collection, 10 EPs that collect 20 of the band's singles during their first decade of existence. Purgatory was a 2-tracker, standard single released in 1981 and the Maiden Japan EP was also released that year which I've already covered elsewhere in its extended, superior, fan club format upon which you could experience the whole gig, as the penultimate live recording of the band with their original vocalist Paul Di'anno.\n\nBecause it's all available elsewhere, I find this to be perhaps the single most worthless EP in the entire series. Both \"Purgatory\" and \"Genghis Khan\" are available on Di'anno's 2nd album with the band, Killers, though admittedly they are both great songs that I don't mind hearing again...I would only mind paying for it. The Maiden Japan EP contains only four of the tracks from the performance, beginning with \"Running Free\", then the murky 70s vibes of \"Remember Tomorrow\", the wailing \"Killers\" and the Zep-stepping grooves and morose melodies that complete \"Innocent Exile\". These all sound great, but I've covered them elsewhere, and I'd certainly urge any Maiden fan to try and track down that full-length version of the concert rather than this EP or the Maiden Japan EP itself, which is identical if you've got the standard domestic version.\n\n\"Listen With Nicko!\" begins with the drummer mock snoring, which is my sentiment exactly when faced with the prospect of another of his rambling, schizoid anecdotes as he takes the piss out of himself and showcases the history of these tracks, which are coincidentally not something he himself was a part of (Clive Burr was still drumming). We learn little details like the original title of \"Purgatory\" and how it was one of the only singles that didn't chart in the top #50 for Maiden (by 1990, anyway), and McBrain jokingly infers that had he been part of the band then, perhaps it would have charted more favorably...\n\nSimply put, this is the least compelling of the First Ten Years EPs, with very little of interest to offer unless it is your only means of acquiring material from the Maiden Japan EP. \"Purgatory\" and \"Genghis Khan\" are both great, but they are greater as a part of Killers. Otherwise, this is good only for its voucher towards the box case.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nThe Best of the Beast was the first proper compilation album released by Iron Maiden a full 16 years after the release of their s/t, and this does seem a conundrum, as the band had been heavily circulated and popular for years. But arrive it did, in a variety of formats that were bound to confuse, but all containing previously released material and a few rare recordings. There was a single CD edition of the Best of the Beast which was even less warranted than the later Somewhere Back in Time, and a deluxe 4LP package which contains the most value (if you're into the vinyl, that is) as it simply has the most tracks. But this particular version I'm reviewing was the standard, 2CD version with 27 tracks and about 2 and a 1/2 hours of music.\n\n\"Virus\" was probably the highlight here of the newer material, if only for the novelty that it had not been released on a full-length album. It's a steady hard rocker featuring Blaze Bayley's vocals, and while it's not the worst Maiden in history, it's very much forgettable, like just about anything on the abysmal Virtual XI (the next full-length released after this compilation). It's no fault of the vocals themselves, but the song simply does not possess even a simple melody of interest, even when it breaks down into the skanking, cornball bridge with a solo that seems it took no longer than about 5 seconds to compose. After this, the compilation begins to travel back in time, starting with two selections from The X Factor: \"Sign of the Cross\" and \"Man on the Edge\". Now, while I don't have any particular malice for these tracks, they are far from the best songs of The X Factor, let alone Maiden's entire career...which this compilation is probably supposed to represent.\n\nBack further, we get \"Be Quick or Be Dead\", and live versions \"Fear of the Dark\" and \"Afraid to Shoot Strangers\" which make up the Fear of the Dark section; while \"Bring Your Daughter to the Slaughter\" and \"Holy Smoke\" serve as proxies for No Prayer for the Dying. These are all solid enough inclusions, through you could honestly have done with only one track from each album and included a lot more from their first seven full-lengths, the ones that truly matter. But these will be explored in more detail throughout the remainder of this disc and the next. \"The Clairvoyant\", \"Can I Play With Madness?\" and \"The Evil That Men Do\" are here to represent Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, and I suppose the latter two belong. \"Wasted Years\" and \"Heaven Can Wait\" do justice to Somewhere in Time and round out the first CD. Of course, in my humble opinion that entire album could be reprinted here if we were REALLY interested in the 'best' of the 'beast'...\n\nThe 2nd disc begins with more live versions to represent Live After Death and Powerslave (very clever...), \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\" and \"Running Free\", but then Powerslave is expanded upon with the excellent \"Aces High\" and \"2 Minutes to Midnight\". Piece of Mind has \"Where Eagles Dare\" and obviously \"The Trooper\", and The Number of the Beast is given a little extra heat with the title track, \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\" and the popular \"Run to the Hills\". So far, no surprises among the older material, they merely included the popular live staples. Killers only gets \"Wrathchild\" while Iron Maiden gets \"Phantom of the Opera\" and \"Sanctuary\". Closing the disc and compilation are two of the only other reasons aside from \"Virus\" that the Maiden fan might have purchased this, a re-pressing of \"Iron Maiden\" and \"Strange World\" from the band's rare Soundhouse Tapes EP. But neither version is much to write home about if you own the debut, as both were included there.\n\nAs an attempt to include bits and bytes from each of the Maiden releases of note up to its time of release, the Best of the Beast does not fall completely on its ass, even though I rue the day we ever consider anything from the 1995-1999 era anything near the band's 'best'. It's nice to have a new song, but \"Virus\" is like trying to tap water from a dry desert well. The Soundhouse Tapes likewise do little to compel ownership of this compilation, and excluding a few live versions on the first disc...you've already got everything else. In my opinion, save yourself the time and trouble and just watch the \"Virus\" video online to sate your curiosity...that should be all you require to turn your nose up at this easily ignored profit margin.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nThe title to Iron Maiden's 7th album functions on a great many levels. One of these was obvious if you'd been following the band, but it's also a partial concept album which centers on the hereditary mystique of the number seven, in both folklore and theological history. Ever a fan of science fiction and fantasy in their lyrics, it should come as no surprise that the conceptual sequence of tracks here are also drawn from a worthy source, The Tales of Alvin Maker by controversial writer Orson Scott Card (there was a recent debacle within liberal/PC circles over Card's indirect involvement in the video game Shadow Complex...I wonder if, by extension, those same people would suddenly put a boycott up on Maiden album due to Card's active and open opposition to homosexuality.) But I also like to think of the album in a sequential sense. We've already explored The Number of the Beast, 666, (and also a science fiction novel), so why not venture out to visit its nearest mystical neighbor?\n\nThere are several other distinctions important to this record. For one, I would consider it the most 'eighties' of their efforts, if only for the increased presence of synthesizers ala Adrian Smith and Steve Harris. It's not as if the concept was completely alien to metal or hard rock bands of the 80s, but here on Seventh Son of a Seventh Son it manifests itself like so many other commercial sounds of 80s rock...bands like Asia, Rush and Foreigner all came to mind as I was listening through the album, though to be fair, the rest of the package is entirely loyal to Maiden's previous (and in my opinion, career crowning) efforts Powerslave and Somewhere in Time. In fact, songs like \"Heaven Can Wait\" and \"Wasted Years\" are a good jumping off point for this newer material, because I can't think of a single song on this album that doesn't capitalize on some grand melody.\n\nThe increased use of synths creates an interesting dynamic here, for while Harris' bass is as plunky (perhaps too plunky) as ever, the guitars and keys are forced to complement one another within the highly melodic atmosphere. For this reason, I'd consider it one of the 'least heavy' of Maiden's efforts, but that's not really a major issue, since the music generally delivers the goods. Of course, coming after a masterpiece like Somewhere in Time, there is bound to be some disappointment. Here it's just that I felt a few of the songs were lacking, with some less than spectacular, phoned in lead work. But Dickinson compensates with a full force performance, both manic and melodic. Believe it or not though, this is the first album where I can remember feeling that Maiden were becoming 'old'. Not in a bad way, mind ye, but when you had bands like Helloween or Fates Warning taking this newly defined 'power metal' to new speeds and energetic heights unheard of by the originators (Maiden, Priest, Accept, and Dio-era Sabbath), it was growing increasingly hard to think of Maiden on the precipice where they once sat proudly. But with this aging has come acceptance.\n\n\"Moonchild\" is the first track, and the first in the 'conceptual' sequence of the album (along with \"Infinite Dreams\", \"Infinite Dreams\", the title track, \"The Prophecy\" and \"The Clairvoyant\"). the track opens with a brief and somber vocal passage, before opening into the full synthesizer spread that half made me feel like I was about to enter a new Boston album. But the verse quickly alters that perception, through its driving bass, and a powerful, graceful and haunting chorus that succeeds not only for the vocal melody, but the guitars that gleam below. \"Infinite Dreams\" threw me for a loop, with a long sequence of clean, flowing guitars that are played in a pseudo-funk phrasing not unlike some of the more balladic Red Hot Chili Peppers tracks of the early 90s (course, Maiden did it first). However, it does erupt into some slower paced, proggish metal with synthesizers scintillating above the steady chords. \"Can I Play With Madness?\" made for an obvious first single, due to the unforgettable NWOBHM thunder submerged beneath the verse, and Dickinson's chorus which sails among the eagles. Considering the subject matter here, the song is strangely uplifting... \"The Evil That Men Do\" was the other obvious single, a little more serious perhaps, but with another of those unforgettable chorus hooks that has never eluded me to this day.\n\nIron Maiden is of course no stranger to the 'epic' length track, but \"Seventh Son...\", for all its charm, is unfortunately no \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\" or \"Alexander the Great\". There are a lot of great little jamming hooks dispersed throughout the track, and the actual verse and bad ass chorus elements reminded me of the power of a \"Powerslave\", but I didn't care for the leads here, and perhaps 2-3 minutes could have been clipped off to positive effect. Not bad, just not entirely consistent to these ears. \"The Prophecy\" has a beautiful, tranquil intro which erupts into an excellent dual melody which reminds me a little of some of the riffing on Running Wild's Port Royal, a personal favorite from the same year. This is another of the album's better tracks, and I adored the vocals. \"The Clairvoyant\" has a nice subtle grace to the verse, where the synth and guitars both shine, but outside of this it's not a favorite. \"Only the Good Die Young\" has a nice \"Trooper\"-like foundation of pumping bass triplets adorned in harmonic gloss, again it's not one of their best tracks but it works.\n\nPerhaps one might serve up Seventh Son of a Seventh Son as Maiden's most 'progressive' work (at least until the mediocre Dance of Death), and would be difficult to disagree, because there is certainly that atmosphere being painted across its vaulted, melodic spires. This album concludes what I consider to be the Golden Age of Maiden (1982-1988), though I don't really think of it on the same level as any of the previous four records. It's very well written, and several of its tracks have deservedly found their way into the fans' hearts and the band's set list, but it was the first Maiden album that wouldn't make my short list for the years' end. Granted, 1988 was an astounding year for evolution across numerous metal genres, with more breakthroughs than a science fair, but its kind of sombering to find the Irons absent from where they once reigned.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nThe First Ten Years: Part X\n\nThe Clairvoyant/Infinite Dreams EP is the 10th and final release in the First Ten Years collection. If you've been saving your pennies and spending them on each of these double-single packs, you would have now owned the vouchers required to order the box set in which to store them! Congratulations. You now own a collection of largely redundant singles with a few worthwhile B-sides that are possibly available somewhere else. In all seriousness, though, if you've got this entire set and it's in good condition, more than likely you can make some money off it (through online auctions or a metal market at a convention).\n\nInterestingly, like the Running Free/Run to the Hills EP, this offering consists only of live material from the two original singles. So The Clairvoyant (1988) is missing the studio version of that song, but otherwise they are reprinted normally. The live offerings off of that include \"The Clairvoyant\", \"The Prisoner\" and \"Heaven Can Wait\", all from the 1988 Monsters of Rock tour at Donington Park, and they all sound great here. A good, airy soundboard recording, and how often do we get to hear \"The Prisoner\" live? I was most impressed with that track of the three.\n\nThe Infinite Dreams single from 1989 features three more live tracks, from a performance in Birmingham England. \"Infinite Dreams\" and \"Killers\" are no surprise, but then we are given the live treatment of \"Still Life\" from the Piece of Mind album, not something we hear every day, and the novelty helpts give it the edge over some of the more common selections. After these tracks we are given closure with the final \"Listen With Nicko!\" segment, and thank the stars for that. He does seem rather thankful here for being given the chance to communicate all these anecdotes to the fans, and thanks them for the band's success and buying this collection, so in the end you don't feel so down on the guy. He does seem rather enthusiastic to be finished his 'mumbling'.\n\nThe one big problem with this EP (and so many of the other First Ten Years singles) is that all the material is available elsewhere, through later releases. For example, all of these tracks are available on the bonus disc to the 1995 re-issue of Seventh Son of a Seventh Son. And the Infinite Dreams live tracks are available on the Maiden England CD. So there is a limited value at best, unless you have passed on those or you were collecting as these things hit the shelves. But as for the content, all the songs sound pretty good, definitely a positive live experience that you'll enjoy beaming out of your car or drunk at a party.\n\nJudging by the fact that 2000 has already come and gone without another series of EPs called The Second Ten Years, I doubt we'll see another marketing strategy like this one. There are certainly enough singles out there since Infinite Dreams. Perhaps the band will simply gather the material up on full-length compilation albums, a cheaper alternative for the fans. In today's economic climate, I just don't see something like this happening, except perhaps a virtual version on something like iTunes But then again, we got the Somewhere Back in Time compilation...so expect the worst.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nI'm going to assume that there are children out there, budding young boys and girls who are, understandably, being exposed to Iron Maiden for the very first time. Or perhaps some older, ripe fans who just never gave the band the time of day based on a hostile predisposition towards metal music or metal fans. Perhaps some sap was simply unaware of the band at all...having spent his/her life under a rock somewhere, or with a nose so far up a book or his own arse that he's never seen the logos, heard about the concerts, seen a kid with a T-shirt. I admit that I may look down upon such ignorami, but that sentiment is coming from a guy who always makes a point to see and hear everything around him, striving to ever improve upon his situational awareness.\n\nBut EVEN to these people, who are theoretically discovering Eddie, Bruce, Nicko and Steve for the first time in their lives, I will say: do not waste a fucking penny on the 2008 compilation Somewhere Back in Time: The Best of: 1980-1989. Not only is this collection void of any worth due to its redundant track listing, but to purchase such a thing is only to encourage wasteful, crass commercialism. I address this command towards these initiates only because I cannot imagine any studied metal fan, even the most casual, wasting his hard earned cash on this heap of nonsense. Now I don't know if this album was some sort of contractual agreement or what, but do we all remember the constant tirades Bruce Dickinson was offering on stage when Maiden performed at Ozzfest? Remember the egging incident?\n\nRemember all that talk about American corporations, and greed, and how it was killing our rock shows? Well, Bruce, Somewhere Back in Time: The Best of: 1980-1989 is perhaps the most telling example of hypocrisy I have ever seen in Maiden's history. Whether you wanted this compilation to exist or it was just the record label farming for a few more dollars to stuff in their obese breeches, it is a waste of space, suitably only for immediate recalcitration into the component elements that caused its very being. Round up every copy of this album, take it to a goddamn refinery or recycling pit, and make it so.\n\nDoes the track listing even matter? Should we bicker and argue about the contents, about which song deserves to be here and which does not? Has every Iron Maiden fan not already gone through the ultimate Maiden set list countless times in their imagination? As the title would imply, this is a collection of their popular material from the 1980-89 albums. All of which are albums you would already own in full if you give a damn about this band or 80s metal period. There are 15 of them, and the compilation is over 70 minutes in length. Iron Maiden and Killers are ignored with the exception of the live versions of \"Phantom of the Opera\", \"Wrathchild\" and \"Iron Maiden\" from the Live After Death record. Most of the remainder are the more notorious sing along tracks that we all know and love, and probably own somewhere else: \"The Trooper\", \"2 Minutes to Midnight\", \"Wasted Years\", \"Can I Play With Madness?\", and so forth.\n\nBeyond the inherent, recycled hogwash of its musical content, I can't believe someone had the indecency to mutate the covers of my favorite Maiden albums (Powerslave and Somewhere in Time) into this abomination. Tack on a logo, copy over some master tracks, print a booklet, and profit. What is next, EMI/Maiden, X Factored: The Best of Iron Maiden: 1990-1999? Let me guess, will it contain \"Fear of the Dark\", \"Tailgunner\" and \"Bring Your Daughter...to the Slaughter?\" Don't get any ideas!\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nThe First Ten Years: Part II\n\nThe 2nd entry in the First Ten Years EP series collects together the Women in Uniform single from 1980 and the Twilight Zone single from the following year. Like the first and third volumes, they're the originals recorded with Paul Di'anno; no attempt is made to whitewash the past, so the fan is getting exactly what he or she might have missed out on in the band's budding years. Of the two singles, Women in Uniform is the more valuable, since it consists of two songs you wouldn't have gotten on the original albums. However, as \"Twilight Zone\" was not included on the original UK release of Killers (added later on the '88 edition), that track might have some inherent sentimentality for English fans.\n\nWomen in Uniform includes the title track, a fun and frolicking rendition of a cult hit from the now obscure Australian rock band the Skyhooks, from their 1978 album Guilty Until Proven Insane. Yes, about two years prior to the Maiden version, and also released as a single itself. Go figure. The song seems to match the early iron well, especially with Di'anno's frenzied rock and roll squealing near the end in which he sounds like he's trying to fellate James Brown. \"Invasion\" is a non-album track, and the best thing on this EP. It had originally appeared on their Soundhouse Tapes with a cruder recording, and somewhere along the line it must have at least provided the inspiration for \"Invaders\", but it's very entertaining, a good old mash of pure 70s NWOBHM fury and punkish undertow. Like the previous Sanctuary single, a live track is included from the Marquee, London in 1980, and here it is \"Phantom of the Opera\".\n\n\"Twilight Zone\" is an excellent track, with a good ol' shuffle metal rhythm and some amazing atmosphere kicking in through Di'anno's vocals in the bridge. I also find the lead relevant to my interests. Because it kicks ass! Other than this, though, there is only \"Wrathchild\" which appears on the Killers album. Basically if you had the original US release for Killers, this single is worthless. \"Listen With Nicko!\" has McBrain at an even more relentless level of 'hasn't had his morning tea', enthusiastically telling us the tale of how Maiden decided to cover the Skyhooks and so forth. Once again, we're 'lucky' to have this, as apparently McBrain does not own a copy of the original singles...though it is curious to know that \"Twilight Zone\" is Adrian Smith's first single with the band, and Nicko talks about touring alongside Maiden in his old band Trust, but briefly.\n\nWomen In Uniform is actually a good single. Even though I'm not a huge fan of the cover, it has \"Invasion\" which is quite cool. Sadly, it is paired up with Twilight Zone, which is detritus unless you are somehow an Englishman without access to the track. Still, if you wish to collect all ten...well, you gotta catch 'em all.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nThe First Ten Years: Part I\n\nThe First Ten Years EP collection begins right where it should...at the beginning, with the first two commercial singles issued by Iron Maiden in 1980: Running Free and Sanctuary. Both of these singles were culled from the band's debut Iron Maiden, though Sanctuary was originally independent of the album, added later as a bonus track, and many have since come to accept it as a part of the whole. I should also note that these are the real deal, original recordings with Paul Di'anno on vocals, they have not chosen to retrofit them with Bruce Dickinson, and I've always admired the healthy respect the band has given the man despite his early fallout with Steve Harris and manager Rod Smallwood. Maybe not always for the man himself, but his flagship work that put the band on the map.\n\n\"Running Free\" is as rugged as ever, a total sing-a-long if there ever was one, with its gracious descending melodies post-chorus and a dirty, chugging appeal to the rhythm riffing that is undeniably timeless. The B-side to the single was \"Burning Ambition\", and though it's not one of the most memorable Maiden tunes, it was at least a pretty clear sign that they were intent on including some non-album material with their singles from an early date (of course, this did not always turn out to be the case). Still, there's a laid back feel to the chords, and similar melodies cut through its structure, so it feels a natural fit for \"Running Free\".\n\nThe Sanctuary single seems a little less valuable, though if you have an old copy of Iron Maiden without the song then it must have been a godsend. This track has always felt very close to Steppenwolf's \"Born to Be Wild\" for me, with a similar road-burned abandon, and it is joined by a pair of live tracks recorded at London's Marquee in April, 1980. \"Drifter\" sounds comparable here to the band's other live recordings on which it appears, and the cover of Montrose's \"I've Got the Fire\" is another good match with \"Sanctuary\" itself. Di'anno is having a blast here, but you can always tell that he was such a better component of the band when they were in their earlier phase, far closer to the hard rock of the 60s and 70s than their more morose, melodic work of the Dickinson era.\n\nThis leaves the first segment of the \"Listen With Nicko!\" monologue, and he starts to explain what this is all about, interjecting his silly schizophrenic humor like a patient in dire need of an injection and a long nap. Still, I find it most confounding to listen to the first few \"Listen With Nicko!\" segments, since the man wasn't even involved with the band at this point...would it not have been a better idea to use Steve Harris for these? Or maybe a Di'anno guest spot? My favorite point is at which Nicko calls the listeners 'lucky boys and girls'. Lucky for what? Spewing pence into your fat pockets? Also, the answering machine thing at the end is not that funny. Good thing you had drumming to fall back on sir, your comic fu is weak.\n\nRunning Free/Sanctuary is really not that valuable. Live recordings of \"Drifter\" and \"I've Got the Fire\" are available elsewhere, and the only thing of interest is the \"Burning Ambition\" B-side. Track this down only if you're putting together the EPs for your boxed set. Otherwise, move along.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nDeath on the Road is yet another Iron Maiden live recording, and one of the more recent to get a commercial release (along with the Flight 666 soundtrack). The CD & LP audio releases have 2 discs each, and in 2006 a 3 DVD set was then released, which probably represents the penultimate version of the concert in spectacular sound. While I have yet to actually watch the performance, I can only imagine that skipping out on the audio only would be the preferred route to take here, because Death on the Road is really nothing special. It's nice that the set featured on the discs includes some newer material...but a little less impressive when you realize that you'll be dealing with some of the band's mediocre material that was recent at the time of the Dance of Death tour.\n\nThe live was filmed and recorded in November, 2003 in Westfalenhalle, Dortmund, Germany and as far as the mix goes, it's ample enough that it doesn't give a dull impression (like the Real Live Dead One albums). The material seems to cover a great deal of their career, but as I mentioned, individual tracks here could have well been replaced with other, more exciting pieces for a better overall experience. There are fully six tracks from the Dance of Death album: \"Wildest Dreams\", \"Dance of Death\", \"Rainmaker\", \"Paschendale\", \"No More Lies\" and \"Journeyman\", very few of which I could personally care about. Since this is the normal \"Paschendale\" without the orchestra, I wasn't so excited, and of this litter, I'd have to say \"Wildest Dreams\" and \"Rainmaker\" came across the best in the setting. Some of the other songs are too long to justify listening for just a few brief segments of interest, but it's the same criticism I'd give to the studio editions. As for the rest of the new material, Virtual XI is thankfully ignored, and there is but one track, \"Lord of the Flies\" from the X Factor. And frankly, it's not that bad with Bruce doing the vocals in place of Blaze. I'm honestly surprised that there was no \"Wicker Man\" here, but Maiden were probably thinking of the best interests of fans like myself who openly break into tears whenever they hear it (the good kind of cry). Instead, they've included the title track to that album, \"Brave New World\", which is more or less successful.\n\nHeading back through time from this point, we've got the title track off Fear of the Dark, which the audience lovingly howls along to. \"Can I Play With Madness?\" is an obvious crowd pleaser, and this is one of the better live versions I've heard of it, outside of actually being at gigs where they performed it. The band's two best albums Somewhere in Time and Powerslave are sadly ignored for the selection on the live album, which to me seems rather insane... But then, all those songs are so fucking great that the band must have been sick of them, or thought the fans who picked up the CDs would be sick of them. However, each of the first four albums is represented. The band's namesake from the debut is here, \"Wrathchild\" off of Killers, and \"The Trooper\" from Piece of Mind. The Number of the Beast actually gets three entries here: the title track, \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\", and \"Run to the Hills\". Of all the older material, I'll have to run with \"Wrathchild\" and \"The Trooper\" as the best of the lot here, their energy is simply too timeless to ignore.\n\nWhen all is said and done, Death on the Road is not the best of Maiden's live offerings, but it does at least sound up to the task, with one of the better soundboard reproductions they've yet minted for the fans at large. If you're the type to purchase everything with the band's logo on it, well...it must be nice. If not, you may wish to rent or purchase the DVD set, so you can actually SEE the live performance and get the added bonus features, which include some documentary pieces about the Dance of Death album, recording, and setting up the tour. There's not much reason to have both that and this audio version, and Gods know we already have enough live Maiden to last us a life over.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nThe First Ten Years: Part VII\n\nOnly a band like Iron Maiden could be so affluent as to reserve the ability to release singles from a LIVE album...and yet, here they are, both of the singles from 1985's Live After Death, gathered in one place as the 7th fragment of the band's First Ten Years EP collection. Both Running Free and Run to the Hills are complemented with a pair of additional live tracks that did not appear on Live After Death, so it feels a rather natural extension and a further means to make a little money. And to be honest, I liked the recordings a lot, they've got the same virile clarity that possesses the full-length, and thus remain among Maiden's best live offerings on disc ever (I'd gladly take even the B-side live tunes here over some of the band's later live albums like A Real Live Dead One).\n\nBut is it that much of a value? If you're actually collecting The First Ten Years, then yes. If you're obsessed with Iron Maiden so much that you want your record bins or bedroom walls sporting all the cover art, all the thrifty details, or you get a hard-on for Nicko McBrain's almost schizophrenic narrative (I swear, the man's got like a dozen or more bad comedians inside his head; at least one for each drum), then yes. If you're NOT an asylum-bound risk to our society, well then you can likely skip this, like any of the band's singles or EPs.\n\nBut as far as these particular vignettes go, Running Free/Run to the Hills is not so foul to the taste. You get 40+ minutes of material, though 12 minutes of that playtime is devoted to Nicko's storytelling. The B-sides to Running Free are \"Sanctuary\" and \"Murders in the Rue Morgue\", both of which represent some of Dickinson's best live renditions of the tracks, with plenty of crowd thrilling and the Steppenwolf-life rock swing of the former in full, and a little break in which Bruce works up the crowd into a rabid froth. Joining Run to the Hills is \"Phantom of the Opera\" and the instrumental \"Losfer Words (Big 'Orra)\", the latter of which is a pleasant surprise as it's not the first song our thoughts leap towards when we think of a Maiden live set. As a diehard Powerslave fan (that is one of their two albums I consider perfect), I am thrilled for its inclusion.\n\nThe Nicko narrative here, Part VII, feels like a child has been fed too much sugar on the spoon, but he does manage to actually get into the details of the original singles, the Long Beach performances behind them, and so forth. When he's speaking calmly, he's actually quite charming, but you are constantly getting a Doppler effect as his voice swells and dies. And that's the thick and thin of this EP, one of the better in The First Ten Years series, since there are four unique tracks present, even if they're all just live songs.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nThe First Ten Years: Part V\n\nBecause releasing singles is not incentive enough to grab a little extra cash from devoted fans or cursory listeners, Iron Maiden came up with a rather interesting marketing scheme in 1990 to release 10 EPs on CD and vinyl, each consisting of 2 of the band's singles from the first decade of the band's career, with an added commentary interview track featuring drummer Nicko McBrain. Once you had all 10 of these collectors' EPs, you had the full commentary track, and could use vouchers contained within the EPs to order a custom box in which to store them all.\n\nThough an obvious cash grab, it was actually rather ingenious, because it at least added a little collectible value, and a better format for which to purchase these old recordings rather than track down the 20 individual singles. The 5th disc in this collection joins together the Flight of the Icarus single with The Trooper, both released in 1983, and probably a lot more sought after for the inclusion of the cover songs, though both of the A-sides are classics, especially \"The Trooper\". But if you've longed for the Bruce Dickinson-fronted cover of Montrose's \"I've Got the Fire\", here it is in stereo, repressed from the Flight of Icarus single. The solo is great, and the version here is probably just as potent as that which Paul Di'anno performed (you can hear it on several of the band's earlier recordings).\n\nHowever, it is the cover of Jethro Tull's \"Cross-Eyed Mary\" which is the true gem on this release, a fantastic rendition in Maiden's capable hands. Few could fill in the shoes of Ian Anderson, but Dickinson is damn capable, giving the classic an injection of siren-like precision which soars across the burning guitar rhythms like a stoned eagle. Listening to Nicko McBrain babble can grow a little tiresome as he's always shifting his voice around in parody of the various people and places of his band's history, but if you can get past this, the 10 minutes of monologue is slightly informative...I just wish he wouldn't sing out the band's songs. Ever.\n\nIf you're going to piss money on something you possibly already own, this could be the way to do it. Granted, a simple compilation of the band's singles (even if just for the B-sides) would have been sufficed and created less waste in the end, but why take someone for a 10 or 20-spot when you could take them for nearly a dozen 10-spots? The covers are good enough that a Maiden fan should acquire this on the dirt cheap, but I can't in good faith recommend paying top bill for this, unless you're planning on a re-sale of the entire set.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nDuring the 80's Maiden was getting bigger and bigger. Their true brilliance, however, came from their ability to go further than virtually any of their contemporaries, (with the possible exception of Manowar) with each album expanding their sound while at the same time making it even more commercially accessible than their previous offerings. Every album after Number Of The Beast almost feels like a game of \"top this\", as each successive record aspired to new heights; Piece Of Mind took the epic elements of the aforementioned album and turned it into an entire album, setting Maiden almost completely apart from the rest of the NWOBHM with its proto-power metal sound. Labels aside, it was indeed far more epic and overblown, yet it worked because of the band's combined songwriting skills, which adds up to one of the greatest combination of musicians ever - something they are known the world over as for a good reason.\n\nBut where could they take their sound after PoM, which also topped the charts just like its predecessor? The answer is right here - Powerslave, which took the epic sound of PoM even further, with only two songs here sounding remotely like the NWOBHM. Everything else has a proto-power sound, the same kind of epic storytelling style that Manowar were using at the time - they being virtually the only other band to do so, and much farther from the mainstream than their British \"counterparts\". In what they did, Maiden pretty much inspired the vast majority of the power metal genre, maybe even more than Slayer did for death metal with Hell Awaits and Reign in Blood, as well as hugely influencing progressive metal and everything element of the genre synonymous with \"huge and epic\".\n\n...Boy, how opinions change. Not very long ago I was lambasting this album as the worst thing Maiden put out in their entire career. This was mostly due to my own ignorance about both metal and hard rock, but to have called Powerslave a \"shitty, poppy hard rock album\" was utterly ridiculous. I've heard real poppy hard rock and it is NOTHING like Powerslave. No, Powerslave is most definitely heavy metal. Perhaps not heavy \"fucking\" metal in the way Priest were and still are, but certainly close and equally as heavy, just not so \"metal in your face screaming\" like another masterpiece released this year by said metal gods, Defenders Of The Faith. (Which is for another review)\n\nCould the album be called pretentious? If so, you may as well call Piece of Mind, Somewhere in Time and Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son the same, if not more so. Either way such a statement would be foolish and incorrect. Yes, it's completely different from how Maiden started out. Does it matter? No, because it is equally as good if not better. The band's songwriting skills were at their peak during this period. \n\nHow is it innovative? Well, for one I don't think anyone had written a 13 minute long heavy metal song before this album. And that's just one example - songs such as Aces High and Two Minutes To Midnight are not particularly innovative, but the former is certainly somewhat epic, and the latter great for what it is. Songs such as Flash Of The Blade and The Duellists have stunning middle sections with fantastic guitarwork, and the latter could be considered progressive to a point, while the title track has plenty of everything - heaviness, a clean break, great solos, the works. \n\nThere is one slightly weaker song here, but it's not actually bad, simply less brilliant than everything around it. That aside, there is nothing on this album that could be called weak. \n\nAs for being epic - well, I don't think this really needs much explaining. Aside from Two Minutes To Midnight and Back In The Village, all the tracks on Powerslave have this sound to one degree or another.\n\nSo, onto the songs. \"Aces High\" is about as good an opener as one could ask for. The first riff is powerful despite not being typically heavy, ditto for the second which makes use of the typical Maiden harmonies, yet it isn't too obvious or anything - the speed and power is there, and in this case that's all that matters. The third riff is heavy. Bruce's performance here, while strong, is still not my favourite from him - when he tries a more subtle approach it usually works much better. Nevertheless his voice has that inner strength about it, which is probably another reason for this song's huge popularity. Whether one agrees with the lyrical subject matter or not is irrelevant provided they can get caught up in the song enough to enjoy it, which I now can do. The chorus is great, the guitar and basswork strong throughout and the drumming excellent. While I would say this song is a little overrated, for the most part it works fantastically well.\n\nWe now come to \"Two Minutes To Midnight\", another of the album's biggest hits. Yet it isn't pop, or even hard rock - it's still heavy metal. Of all the songs here it admittedly does have the most hard rock-ish sound and as the bluesiest riffs, but that's part of the appeal. In a way it's \"rock 'n' roll\" - not as we define it by the actual term, but basically heavy metal based on a hard rockin' vibe not too far off from said music done around this time, a crushing, down and dirty swagger that's just a bit heavier, lyrically darker, and longer. It also has an interesting middle section, a great main riff and a memorable chorus. In addition, Bruce gives one of his finest performances as a vocalist here, showcasing a grittier, harder style quite different from the \"epic singing\" he used in the opener and in most of the other songs. Considering the subject matter I'd say this was very appropriate. Either way this is one of Maiden's most beloved songs for a reason: it's mesmerising, it's lyrically intelligent, and it rocks.\n\n\"Losfer Words (Big 'Orra) \" is up next, and considering it's an instrumental the band does an admirable job keeping it interesting. It starts with some heavy riffing, then some cool melodies appear just before the 1 minute mark. It goes back and forth like this for a while and then ends. There isn't much to say, but it works, especially in the context of the album's epic vibe.\n\n\"Flash Of The Blade\" is a very interesting song considering its fairly short length. I have no idea why I used to hate this song - because of the clean guitar moments? Either way that whole thing was absurd. The opening riff isn't very heavy but it's good. Then the drums kick in, then the other guitar, and around the 40 second mark it gets both heavy and fast. Bruce gives a very good performance here, sounding very honest about a subject that may seem somewhat silly, but works in this context partly because of his singing. The middle section is one of the best parts of the song, with fantastic twin-guitar harmonies creating an almost neo-classical sound. After going through the chorus a couple more times the opening riff is played again, then the song ends. An excellent song.\n\nOne of my most frequent criticisms with regards to Maiden is their lack of consistency between either albums or songs. I used to think this was the case for Powerslave. This was really due to my own misguided beliefs about the album's \"metalness\", which in turn came from me not having actually listened to it properly. Thankfully I have now realised that not only is Powerslave overall a masterful album, but also an extremely consistent one. \n\nThere is but one genuinely weaker song here, and it ain't \"The Duellists\", which is one of Maiden's greater songs to say the least. Beginning with a drumbeat, it goes into some brilliant heavy chugging riffs which then continue under Bruce's vocals. He gives another great performance. The song's only real weakness is its lyrical similarities to Flash Of The Blade. Musically pretty much everything here is brilliant. The one and only point of contention I have is the \"chorus\" where Bruce goes: \"OHHHHHHHHHH! Fight for the hoonnouuuurr, blah blah blah\" which is just a little too happy and cheesy for my tastes, although nowhere near as bad as the chorus of Invaders from Number Of The Beast. Ignore that and you've got another great song. The middle section is amazing, with the first more melodic riffs starting around 1.50 into the song and continuing for three full minutes! This section goes between melodic harmonised (and also ordinary) riffing and great solos played over heavy lower riffs, all of which demonstrate Maiden's fantastic musicianship and key ears for good melodies. It's stuff like this that makes Maiden the legends they are, and that rightly earns this album labels such as \"proto-power metal\" and claims such as being influential to prog metal. The song finally ends the same way it began. Pure brilliance.\n\nSadly, Maiden pretty much never made an album that absolutely, definitively ruled from start to finish, hence the oft said \"great albums overall, but with some filler tracks\". \"Back To The Village\" is a very good example of such a song. Musically it's actually very good, but compared to the first five songs it just ain't as memorable or interesting. The lyrics are a sequel of sorts to The Prisoner from Number Of The Beast, and really, do such lyrics belong on an album about dogfights, war, swordfights, pharaohs, and sailing ships? To a point perhaps, but they're hardly the definition of epic, or imaginative for that matter. \n\nMusically the song is also pretty nondescript, and the only track here with any significant NWOBHM influence aside from Two Minutes To Midnight. The difference is that the latter is interesting both lyrically and musically despite being reasonably simple while the former wallows in an already used subject and in comparison is thus rather tepid. Not a bad song, simply a less good one.\n\nBut this album is not known as mostly filler-less for nothing, and indeed, the title track then comes pounding in with a mighty riff that reminds me why I love Maiden so much. The use of the harmonic minor scale here is completely appropriate considering the subject matter (even though Ancient Egypt may not have actually used such scales. I have no idea either way) and Bruce gives a great performance once more, showcasing how much variety he has as a vocalist. Too many people think of him doing the high-pitched operatic wailing and little else. There's far more to him than that, as he would also prove in subsequent albums.\n\nAlthough the song is pretty straightforward from a compositional point of view, with just two main riffs, it is actually fairly progressive as a whole. After the verses and chorus repeat a couple of times, the song becomes much quieter, and a lovely melodic solo is played over clean guitar. About a minute or so later the heaviness returns, but the solo continues. A few more twists and turns follow and then the song goes back to the verses and chorus, finally ending with some more great harmonic minor riffs. All in all, a true classic.\n\nAfter all of this brilliance, with six great songs and just one of a more average kind, one might imagine that the album could not really be any better than it already is. They would be mistaken, as Rime Of The Ancient Mariner opens with a crushing riff sure to get any heads banging instantly. This song is known not only as another classic but also as one of, if not [I]the[/I] greatest epic composition Maiden ever wrote, and it can be safely said that this is completely true. Although the main riff is simple, it works. The harmonised twin-guitar riffs are fantastic, with the section just after Bruce's \"and the ship sailed on and on into the sea\" being superlative, regardless of whether it is complex or not. The song as a whole is definitely that, though, with many stops and starts, one long break, and plenty of changes from start to finish. Said break is a very cool part - a little overlong perhaps, but it works. As a contrast between the first and second parts of the song it works even better. The latter half is very positive, with a fairly light riff playing over Bruce's singing of how the Mariner survived his horrible ordeal, and then the heaviness returns and a fantastic solo - one of Maiden's best ever - follows. Finally the song goes back to its original main riffs, both the normal and harmonised ones, as Bruce finishes the tale by explaining that the Mariner had learned greater respect for all life by the time he returned home. A fantastic and very heroic and positive end to a magnificent song.\n\nSo there you have it. While nothing is perfect, this is one of the only two Maiden albums that have no genuinely weak songs. The other is Somewhere in Time. That album is my favourite of their entire discography, and this one is now second. Considering how I used to feel about it that might seem strange, but it's true. I simply hadn't listened to it properly before. It really is all that - like its predecessor and next two successors it influenced the epic side of metal hugely, and by that I mean HUGELY. It represents the furthest they could take their songs without the use of keyboards or synths, and they succeeded admirably at everything. From the twin-guitar harmonies, to the heavy yet melodic riffs, soaring vocals, fantastic storytelling and often progressive, massive compositions, this album was easily as influential as Number Of The Beast in its own way, as were the other three directly around it.\n\nNow the biggest question: is Powerslave overrated?\n\nHell yes. But it is also one of the best albums the band ever created, and almost perfect from start to finish. That might seem like a bizarre statement, and technically speaking it is: the very term overrated implies a sense of hype, of making something up, that the true contents are not as awesome as the pretty wrapper. But this album somehow manages to be beloved by all - hardcore fans, casual fans, non-fans who simply like Maiden, and even ordinary rockers alike, and yet still remains utterly outstanding in every way. Very few albums are like that, and that's another part of this record's charm, I guess.\n\nSo to sum up: essential, whether you love Maiden, love Heavy Metal, just love good ol' heavy rock, or love all three. Influential beyond belief, and all around fantastic.\n",
        "\nAlthough Live After Death stands tall as my favorite live offering from Iron Maiden, and perhaps one of my favorite live albums ever, I would have to give credit towards Maiden Japan as a close second, and certainly the go-to recording if you're interested in the Paul Di'anno era of the band. Though it was originally released as a 4-track EP in 1981, I am reviewing the vastly superior 1999 digipak, remastered and sent out to fan club members like a gift from God. It might be a little hard to track down these days, but I have word that it is often carried through a series of tubes, and perhaps you could make out your check to a Mr. Paul Di'anno, the former singer who is possibly NOT rich enough to one day sip daiquiris alongside Walt Disney in cryo-land.\n\nLike so many other great bands, Japan was one of the first countries to throw down enthusiastic support for Iron Maiden, inviting the band over for live performances and getting quite wild here in comparison to some of their reactions at concerts. Maiden Japan was recorded in May of 1981 at the Sun Plaza in Tokyo, and it sounds excellent, a great send-off for Paul Di'anno (his final recording with the band). There are 17 tracks here, and supposedly an even longer bootleg exists with a 2nd version of \"Running Free\" from the same gig. The debut is represented through \"Strange World\", \"Iron Maiden\", \"Remember Tomorrow\", \"Phantom of the Opera\", \"Running Free\", \"Transylvania\", and \"Sanctuary\"; but the majority of the material is off the Killers album: \"Wrathchild\", \"Another Life\", \"Genghis Khan\", \"Murders in the Rue Morgue\", \"Twilight Zone\", \"Drifter\", \"Killers\", \"Innocent Exile\", and \"Purgatory\". The set is rounded out with the cover of Montrose's \"I Got the Fire\".\n\nSo basically, with the exception of a few tracks (\"Prowler\", \"Prodigal Son\", \"Charlotte the Harlotte\" and \"The Ides of March\"), you are presented with nearly the entire content of the first two albums in great, live stereo sound. There is something rugged about this album which has endeared me to it; the band is spot on for almost the entire performance, but the bass is given a bouncy abandon and the guitars feel good and raw. Di'anno is on fire, and even his over the top rock star inflections (which are part of the reason I will always prefer Dickinson) fall into line, making this a 75+ minute essential live audio experience for all but the most softened poseurs among you. In particular I enjoyed \"Wrathchild\", \"Murders in the Rue Morgue\", \"Phantom of the Opera\", and \"Remember Tomorrow\", but I must admit \"Drifter\" also really stands out in the crowd, a sonic crescendo of everything good about the late 70s/early 80s, sounding like a party metal warp drive.\n\nIt's a crying shame that Maiden Japan has not been given a more mainstream release, because clearly it is worth owning nearly as much as Live After Death, and it's far better than their other official live offerings like A Real Live One/A Real Dead One. Do what you must to acquire this, but avoid the original US EP release, which only included \"Running Free\", \"Remember Tomorrow\", \"Killers\" and \"Innocent Exile\". As a window into those important, formative years of one of metal's royal families, Maiden Japan is close to mandatory.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nLike its companion A Real Live One, this is a collection taken from various dates Iron Maiden performed in Europe, in 1992. But the difference is in the track selection. A Real Live One contained tracks from Somewhere in Time and beyond, while this dwells in the earlier portion of the band's career. Thus, A Real Dead One feels more redundant with Live After Death and diehards of Paul Di'anno's vocals on the first two albums will have to deal with any natural prejudice they have against Dickinson's interpretation of the material. It was a pretty novel, but ultimately worthless marketing ploy, and surely Iron Maiden could have just released the two albums together as a 2-disc set and scab a little less from their fans. Which, of course, they did...by releasing them both as A Real Live Dead One in 1998, for an even further rubbing in the wrong way...\n\nSurprisingly, all of the Di'anno era material here is culled from the debut, Iron Maiden, and represents half of the overall track list. \"Prowler\", \"Transylvania\", \"Remember Tomorrow\", \"Sanctuary\", \"Running Free\" and \"Iron Maiden\" are all present. Bruce is actually pretty convincing with \"Remember Tomorrow\" and \"Iron Maiden\", and \"Transylvania\" remains instrumental, so it shouldn't be too painful if you're the most stubborn variety of purist. There are NO tracks here from Killers...which seems strange, but the Number of the Beast selections are all quite predictable: \"The Number of the Beast\", \"Run to the Hills\" and \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\".\n\nNone of these feel as if the band are playing at their peak, suffering from some of the same subdued vibrancy as the material on A Real Live One. This is highly likely to be more the fault of the sound board and mixing engineers than the band, but still, it does not a good product make, and feels like Maiden and their record label might have just desperately wanted to get more out on the shelves. Rounding out the album are \"The Trooper\" and \"Where Eagles Dare\" from Piece of Mind, and poor old Powerslave gets only \"2 Minutes to Midnight\", which was probably my favorite on the album due to the swollen crowd accompaniment.\n\nIf you're going to actually pick this up in 2010 or beyond, and own neither of the individual releases, the safest bet is just to grab A Real Live Dead One, and kill two birds with one wallet. But I must admit that I find neither of these offerings all that memorable or essential, and to date the default live Maiden offering remains Live After Death. I won't go so far as to say they suck, but the most they can deliver is some new Derek Riggs cover imagery, liner notes and fairly average performances.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nA Real Live One is the first official live album released by Iron Maiden after the phenomenal Live After Death in 1985. Consisting of material from 1986 to the band's most recent album at the time, Fear of the Dark, it feels like a natural successor to that legendary title, wise to offer only material that you hadn't heard there. It was handled as a bit of a marketing ploy alongside A Real Dead One (which featured older material and was released later in the 1993), and the two have since been re-issued in a single package, so if you've got the choice, just pick up A Real Live Dead One. No, I didn't laugh either. And I actually find the content here a little better than its companion album.\n\nThis is not one of those cases in which the entire album is culled from a single live experience; instead, A Real Live One is clipped together from a number of European performances in 1992, with a slight preference towards Helsinki Ice Hall, in Finland, which represents the last chunk of the album. Unfortunately, this creates an unstable consistency in the quality of the live performances, ranging from average to decent. Of the 11 tracks available here, almost half of them are from Fear of the Dark, so the band was leaning heavily on their newer material for these live dates, instead of the simple 1-2 track sampling most veteran bands include in their sets. \"Be Quick or Be Dead\", \"From Here to Eternity\", \"Wasting Love\", \"Afraid to Shoot Strangers\", and \"Fear of the Dark\" are all present, of which the hindmost recorded in Helsinki sounds by far the best. \"Be Quick or Be Dead\" and \"Afraid to Shoot Strangers\" in particular sound fairly underwhelming.\n\nFrom No Prayer for the Dying, Maiden have included \"Tailgunner\" and \"Bring Your Daughter... to the Slaughter\", both of which sound fair at best, \"Daughter\" opening with its usual extended crowd play. \"Can I Play With Madness\", \"The Evil That Men Do\" and \"The Clairvoyant\" are here to represent Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, and though none of the three is spectacular, I found them to be among the more enthusiastic of the performances on the record. \"Heaven Can Wait\" is the sole selection from Somewhere in Time (my favorite Maiden album, coincidentally), and it sounds fair, though suffers from a too-clunky bass tone, like some of the other tracks on the album.\n\nI can't claim Dickinson is on fire through the entire track list. He sounds a little shaky in some spots, and out of breath. But seeing that these performances are plucked from massive sets, and he was likely worn out for half of them, and he's still a better singer than you or I will ever be, it's not all that bad. The crowd is very much present on the album, swelling up in places like the bridge of \"Heaven Can Wait\" so loudly that they almost threaten to drown out the band. It's certainly no Live After Death or Maiden Japan (fan club version), but if you can excuse its occasional stumble, it's tolerable. Just don't expect much consistency here, or on its companion album. 1993 seemed like the year for Maiden to make some scratch, because not only did they release both of the 'A Real _ _ _ _ One' albums, but also the full set from 1992 Donington Monsters of Rock performance as a double live album (a few tracks of which appear on the others). Unfortunately, they include the same set list.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nAlthough the cover to Iron Maiden Live!! + One is unfamiliar and for all intents and purposes seems to resemble a bootleg, it was actually an official release for Japan, and given an extended release (with bonus tracks) in the Greek territory a few years later. This is a review for the Japanese edition, which is about as easy to track down these days as a virgin named Mary, so you may have to let your fingers do the walking to experience it. But, as this is not the de facto Paul Di'anno live recording, and the studio track is one you can hear elsewhere, it's hardly worth the trouble...\n\nAs the blatant title would infer, this features a few live tracks, and a single bonus studio track. \"Sanctuary\" is taken from the single of the same name (and a bonus track on the re-issue of the debut Iron Maiden), sort of a Maiden equivalent to a \"Born to Be Wild\", lacking some of the intricacies of their other, early material, but still featuring great bass and a nice melodic break later in the track. After a brief banter, they break into \"Phantom of the Opera\" from the debut, which sounds extremely good here, a burst of excessive force which could leave the majority of other NWOBHM upstarts in the dust. \"Drifter\" is likewise entertaining, quite a lot like \"Sanctuary\" in tone but with that killer opening guitar phrase. \"Women in Uniform\" is the studio track, a cover of the Skyhooks original, which has appeared in several places, including its own single, a fun melodic rocker with some goofy lyrics that feel perhaps a little too rock, especially with Di'anno's often overbearing edge.\n\nAnd that's all there is to it. I would imagine a collector would be interested in owning both versions of this EP, but if you're actually hunting it down for content purposes, the Greek version might be the better value, as it includes live versions of \"Prowler\", \"Running Free\", \"remember Tomorrow\", \"Innocent Exile\", and \"I've Got the Fire\". Most of these are included with the extended fan version of the Maiden Japan EP, though, and if you're seeking the ultimate live session between Paul Di'anno and his alma matter, track that down instead. Live!! + One is not unpleasant, it's just irrelevant.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nAs one of the most popular forces in all metal music, with over 30 years of history, you can bet Iron Maiden is the sort of band who have released countless singles, EPs, compilations, and other debris into the marketplace, many of which are simply not worth the cost of the materials they are printed on, having been rendered useless through their inclusion elsewhere. The No More Lies EP, which was released post- one of the band's most mediocre albums, Dance of Death, and it is quite an extravagant package. Openly billed a 'Souvenir', it was released as a one year anniversary to the full-length, which is horseshit, since there was little to nothing about that album worth celebrating.\n\nIt is, in fact, a voluntary extortion in which fans can give Iron Maiden even more money than they already have (keep in mind this is a band paid 100s of thousands of dollars for individual live performances). But it IS voluntary, so it's not like the Ministry of Media Culture shows up at your door with a cattle prod to make sure you've purchased your copy. As far as its contents, I'd have to consider it more of an aesthetic value, for the 12 page spread included, quite rare for an EP release. There are three tracks and a video clip, including the titular and redundant \"No More Lies\", which we've already got on Dance of Death itself. The other two songs are also taken from the album, but appear here in alternate versions. In the case of \"Paschendale\", we are give an orchestral treatment which in my opinion is far superior to the original, and leads to me believe that the entire Dance of Death recording might have benefited from this approach. As for the electric version of \"Journeyman\", that too is superior, but the song is still not very interesting (the original is one of the most mundane tracks Maiden have written outside of Virtual XI).\n\nBut hidden at the end of \"Journeyman\" is a strange little rendition of \"Age of Innocence\" with Nicko McBrain speaking out some of the vocals and ad-libbing as if it were some Monty Python skit. This is amusing once or twice, especially when he starts 'singing' the guitar solo, and to be honest I would possibly buy an entire album of him doing this. The video is a typical live performance video which matters very little, and there is also a wristband included...which you can put on to stroke yourself to your Eddie posters and Live at Donnington.\n\nIt's a pretty package, but I can't help but feel it would have been better served towards a longer release, with maybe 5-6 songs that you can't get anywhere else. \"Paschendale\" with orchestra is the most vital part of the EP, and I think more of this would have been lovely, and well worth the money. A re-hashed studio track, Nicko McBrain 'skit', wristband and another forgettable version of \"Journeyman\" are just not valuable components for a fan package, unless those fans are truly numb in the grey matter.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nThere are moments during \u2018Flight 666\u2019 that cause a very, very genuine response of stunned disbelief at what is laid bare by Sam Dunn and Scott McFadyan\u2019s (of \u2018Metal: A Headbanger\u2019s Journey\u2019 fame) all-seeing documentarian\u2019s eyes. It\u2019s there in full strength when the epic, spectacular set pieces used in each and every live performance leap out at the audience from the mammoth cinema screen. \nIt hits even harder at the magnificent sight of Ed Force One, Iron Maiden\u2019s very own customised Boeing passenger plane (complete with beautifully lurid Eddie decals), soaring over the mountains ranges of South America in all its evil glory. This is a band, shots like these seem to say, that dares you to doubt that they haven\u2019t achieved all this with no support whatsoever besides their fans worldwide. \nIt is endlessly endearing to think that Iron Maiden have attained all this glorious success and acclaim out of pure hard graft, endless touring and pure, indomitable will. In the world of today, where a band\u2019s success is measured purely by the number of friends on their Myspace page, the continual reminder made by the documentary that Maiden have had next to no mainstream support in their 30+ years never stops being astounding.\n\nMore than any other documentation of Maiden\u2019s career (and there have indeed been a fair few over years), \u2018Flight 666\u2019 is a testament to the devotion the band have inspired all across the planet. Headbangers who hold the notion of heavy metal fandom as being more akin to a community of believers fill the movie to bursting point, and to see them cling so dearly to the ray of light that Iron Maiden brings to their lives is more awe-inspiring than anything else in the film. \nSome of them turn out in legions to greet (read: mob) the band the second Ed Force One touches ground in their nearest airport, and barely five minutes of the run time go by with a shot of someone showing off a home-made banners, or else cradling a signed t-shirt like they\u2019ve just chanced upon the Holy Grail. But especially think of the heart-warming sight of one fan in Costa Rica, weeping openly and sending up ecstatic prayers of thanks for what he\u2019s just seen. Forget every other magical documentary moment you might have seen \u2013 that is one sight that must surely rank as one of the greatest in all of filmmaking.\n\nElsewhere, \u2018Flight 666\u2019 impresses with the admirable candidacy with which the band are depicted. What\u2019s presented of the band is far from sugar-coated; no frustrations with the unending lack of privacy around the keener fans are edited out of the narrative, no hitches in the militantly planned and executed tour left unmentioned for the sake of the band\u2019s image. The frank and honest attitudes taken in the extensive interviews dotted through the film are also a pleasant counterpoint to all the good-humoured irreverence of the icons hamming it up on screen \u2013 drummer Nicko McBrain and his cheekily pointed sarcasm get the biggest laughs of all. \n\nAnd of course, no Iron Maiden film would ever be complete without a plentiful dose of their trademarked metal brilliance, and \u2018Flight 666\u2019 has more than its fair share of Maiden standards, running the gamut from the galloping charge of \u2018Number of the Beast\u2019 and \u2018The Evil That Men Do\u2019 up to the glorious crowd-led epics \u2018Rime of the Ancient Mariner\u2019 and \u2018Fear of the Dark,\u2019 all of which take on glorious life on the silver screen and make their DVD-only companions of previous years seem pitiful by comparison.\n\nBoth a masterwork of documentary filmmaking on the part of Dunn and Macfadyan and one of the most intimate looks into the life of the biggest metal bands on earth to be found in their prodigious filmography, \u2018Flight 666\u2019 is head-and-shoulders above every flimsy \u2018behind-the-scenes\u2019 inserts found on any number of hastily released metal docs of late \u2013 and nuts to you, you poor unlucky soul, if you didn\u2019t have the pleasure of it blasting out at you at full volume on the one night it was shown in cinemas.

        "\nPowerslave is a monumental album in many respects. Drawing inspiration from an age long past, here was Iron Maiden at the top of their game. I mean\u2026fuck yeah, man! This was the band! I wasn\u2019t there myself, but just listening to Powerslave fills me with the kind of adrenaline rush that no other band can. This is the kind of stuff that makes me want to move mountains. It is the kind of music that makes a man want to sail the seas and battle rivals for treasure hidden in dank caves and under waterfalls. It isn\u2019t really as good as some of their other 80s albums like Piece of Mind or Somewhere in Time, but that doesn\u2019t mean anything, as this is still a great, great album that any metal fan worth his salt should have.\n\nWhat does this album do right? It\u2019s just epic and exciting as hell. Everything about this is big. Have you seen the stage shows from this era? Huge pyramids, Eddie as an undead pharaoh and enough scope to make this band and this album larger than life altogether. Maiden went all out making this as hugely grandiose as possible, and it really makes the whole thing a lot of fun. I remember reading something Bruce Dickinson said in an interview about how his stage antics and singing were doctored to make sure everyone in the whole arena can hear him \u2013 it\u2019s about making sure everyone gets the full experience, he said, and to do that, you have to emphasize everything important to the nth degree.\n\nThat about sums up the feel of Powerslave. The songs on here lack the punkish quality of the early releases and they aren\u2019t quite as intricate as the compositions on Piece of Mind, but they make up for that with a lot of swagger and bravado, making every single note count. They have a lot of energy here, too, and it\u2019s a lot of fun. Nothing is subtle about this, nothing is abstract or downplayed, and it all makes the whole experience more enjoyable. Lyrics are about everything from sword fighting to fighter planes to Ancient Egypt; it\u2019s practically a soundtrack to every boy\u2019s innate dreams and fantasies growing up, except magnified to a real-life, moving epic of metallic wonder. It is a certain childlike sense of imagination that pervades the music here.\n\nThe music itself is rife with upbeat twin guitar harmonies, galloping riffs, Steve Harris\u2019 trademark bass acrobatics and the wailing crescendo of might from vocalist Bruce Dickinson\u2019s iron-coated lungs. No ballads, no bullshit, just heavy metal putting everyone\u2019s balls to the wall for eight rounds of ass kicking. Opener \u201cAces High\u201d soars to the clouds with dizzying harmonies and a daring motif before album single \u201cTwo Minutes to Midnight\u201d stomps through the speakers with its own display of doom and despair. \u201cLosfer Words\u201d has a supreme hook, galloping onward without fail, and then the duo of \u201cFlash of the Blade\u201d and \u201cThe Duellists\u201d pits the listener in a fight for their life with excellently crafted riffs swiping through the speakers like sharpened blades. \u201cBack in the Village\u201d is a more restrained hard rocking song, but Dickinson\u2019s bellowing and the cut-throat guitar attack elevate it to a better plane.\n\nThe two best songs on here are saved for last, with the title track coming first. The riff in this song is just fucking legendary, with a killer groove and a sinister laugh backing it up to make it sound like it really did come from some dark, musty Egyptian tomb long since buried underground. The verses are excellent, demonic and deep-throated in delivery, and the chorus is delivered with a dramatic flair that is nothing less than irresistible. Filled with theatrics and metallic pomposity, this song just flat out rules. But then they hit you with the thirteen minute Samuel Taylor Coleridge reference \u201cRime of the Ancient Mariner\u201d \u2013 bet you wish you paid attention in English class now, don\u2019t you? This song\u2019s epic scope is also just fucking legendary, never getting boring or wearing out its welcome. Do you want the full experience of this song? Go get the original Coleridge poem, take an iPod or other mp3 playing device, and put this song on while you read the poem by the sea. I have done it myself, and it is truly epochal and wondrous. Try it out sometime. Take my word for it.\n\nSo that\u2019s Powerslave. It encompasses just about everything Heavy Metal is about, from the adventurousness to the iconic over-the-top execution. This might not be the best Maiden album, but it\u2019s probably the most quintessential example of what they are about, as well as 80s metal as a whole. A grand-standing masterpiece. Unforgettable.\n",
        "\n1995 has proven to be a dismal year in the history of Iron Maiden. The band was declining in mainstream popularity due to the departure of Bruce Dickinson three years prior, the recruitment of former Wolfsbane vocalist Blaze Bayley, and the general musical climate of the times. The band members were also going through hard times in their personal lives with bassist Steve Harris dealing with a divorce and the death of his father and Blaze himself coming out of a motorcycle accident that put him out of commission for a year. The resulting album is easily the darkest and most depressing in the Iron Maiden discography and continues to influence the band's sound to this very day.\n\nAs expected with the change of vocalist, the album's sound is a lot different than the classic Maiden style that most listeners are used to. Blaze's baritone can't quite reach the high notes so effortlessly hit by the Air Raid Siren but that is really only a problem when he actually tries to do so (The somewhat cringeworthy climax of \"Judgement of Heaven\" immediately comes to mind). In contrast, he sounds more comfortable in his lower range and his morose tone fits the brooding atmosphere quite well, making it pretty hard to imagine what these songs would've sounded like if Dickinson had performed on them. Judging by the clips I've seen of the reunited line-up performing songs from this album live, I'm pretty sure Blaze was the man for the job...\n\nWhile the melancholic atmosphere never lets down during the album's 70 minute running time, the songs themselves are packed with variety. \"Sign Of the Cross\" starts the album off on an incredibly epic note and may very well be the strongest track on the album. From there, you've got a few borderline upbeat numbers (\"Lord Of The Flies,\" \"Man On The Edge,\" and \"Judgement of Heaven\"), several tempo changers (\"Fortunes Of War,\" \"The Aftermath,\" and \"The Edge Of Darkness\"), a mournful ballad in the form of \"2 AM,\" and a number of plodding mid-tempo tracks in between.\n\nThe lyrics are also interesting and best show the changes that have taken place since Dickinson's departure. Like most Maiden albums, war is the dominant theme and several references are made to trench warfare and the Vietnam War in particular; but while previous Maiden songs had a tendency to romanticize conflict and often depicted valiant chargings into the fields of battle, this album treats it with a more realistic outlook and looks at the outcomes and after effects of the ordeal (Perhaps a metaphor for the band's career at this point?). \"Fortunes of War\" looks at soldiers that suffer from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, \"The Aftermath\" examines a war zone after the battle has taken place, \"Blood of the World's Hands\" questions the practical purpose of killing one another and public ignorance at large, and \"The Edge of Darkness\" is based on the story of the film \"Apocalypse Now.\" Other interesting topics that are discussed in the lyrics include religious questioning (\"Sign ! of the Cross,\" \"Judgement of Heaven,\" and \"The Unbeliever\"), finding one's purpose in modern society (\"Man on the Edge\" and \"2 AM), and dealing with negative emotions (\"Lord of the Flies\" and \"Look for the Truth\").\n\nAll in all, this may be one of my favorite Iron Maiden albums with it being just below \"Powerslave\" and \"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son.\" Maybe it's open mindedness, maybe it's the depression, maybe it's just me being a die-hard Maiden fan. Whatever it is, it makes for a pretty solid album. Of course, I wouldn't check this album out as an introduction to Blaze Bayley. Listen to \"Silicon Messiah\" to hear his full potential...\n\nPros:\n1) Maiden has modified its sound with some interesting results\n2) Blaze's lower range fits the dark atmosphere quite well\n3) Great lyrical themes\n\nCons:\n1) Blaze's voice does strain on the higher notes\n2) The new elements may put off most listeners\n3) The album's long running time does make it an effort to listen to at times\n\nCurrent Favorites:\n\"Sign of the Cross,\" \"Man on the Edge,\" \"Fortunes of War,\" \"Edge of Darkness,\" and \"2 AM\"\n",
        "\nI don't get it. As in, I don't get the way things work with regards to Iron Maiden and the relationship between them, their albums, and their fans. The first album is often considered a classic, but usually only by fans who started with that album or who were around when it first came out. Other than that it's underrated. The same applies to Killers - and I'm not really talking about the mainstream media here, this is almost all to do with the fans. Also quite underrated. Then we get Number Of The Beast, which I would very comfortably call overrated, but good nonetheless. Then - well, then we get the four albums where Maiden were at about their most epic, and apparently each one was a stepping stone in the right direction, but while Piece of Mind is considered a strong album, it's often regarded as inferior to Powerslave, which along with the album after this one is among the most overrated albums in metal history. Hell, Powerslave isn't even metal most of the time(that, however, is another review). \n\nMy point is that, to be blunt, a lot of the opinions of most Maiden fans seem to have a rather distasteful tendency to cater towards the albums that casual fans and the mainstream media love the most, rather than the albums that are genuinely the best or the most metal. And indeed, I would say that Number Of The Beast, Powerslave and Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son are all either mostly or partly too mainstream and commercial. In some places they actually embody the metal spirit, but in others they shit on it. And albums such as this one and Piece Of Mind are, although not actually ignored, definitely underrated.\n\nAnd when listening to an album such as this, it's hard to see why. Piece Of Mind was great, being infinitely more consistent than NOTB and far more metal than Powerslave could ever be. But it wasn't a masterpiece. This album, on the other hand, is not only a total masterpiece, but actually has some songs that reach such a level of utter sublimity as to be near musical perfection - and here, Maiden does all of this without selling out or becoming overly accessible, as they did on the records directly before and after this one. I submit that Somewhere In Time is not only brilliant but also one of the greatest albums ever recorded in the entire history of heavy metal. 98% of everything is done right here, with only one or two moments(not entire songs)that are just occasionally, slightly weak in comparison to the awesomeness that surrounds them.\n\nSo why do fans often pass up this album in favour of Powerslave and Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son? I'm not certain of this, but the likely truth is depressing and disgusting beyond all belief. Quite simply, it's that the mainstream loves those albums, as do the casual fans, and it's not hard to see why - despite having occasional moments of brilliance, they lean towards pop-metal so frequently as to barely constitute real heavy metal at all, let alone heavy fucking metal. The notion that hardcore fans would so often feel the same way as pop listeners, mainstream music magazines and casual fans is fucking disgraceful, but considering how loved that piece of shit known as Powerslave is I don't really doubt it anymore. As far as I'm concerned, anyone who loves real music and real metal should ignore the opinions of pop fags and all of their ilk, and anyone remotely similar to them entirely and judge on a proper basis what is better music. And I have, and after listening to all three albums more than enough times to judge, I can comfortably say that Somewhere In Time is more metal, less pop friendly and more interesting, progressive and complex than either its predecessor or successor, the former by an enormous way and the latter by still a fairly long one.\n\nNot only that, but amazingly, it actually manages to be equally as melodic and in its own way fairly accessible while still being extremely progressive and epic to the highest degrees. This is Iron Maiden at their finest, as here they take all of the epic elements that they were developing in their previous two albums(admittedly, Powerslave did have one amazing song, that being its 13 and a half minute closer)and expand upon them using synths to make everything even more grandiose and magnificent than ever before. While I almost always err on the side of Priest during debates as to which band is better, and while I would take Screaming For Vengeance and Defenders Of The Faith over NOTB or Powerslave any day, this album is the one case where Iron Maiden actually stayed truer to the spirit of metal than Judas Priest. Turbo, the Priest album that came out the same year as Somewhere In Time, made heavy use of synths, but they did so in order to be more accessible and commercial in a very pop-metal way. Somewhere In Time, on the other hand, uses synths to expand their sound and increase the level of progressiveness and complexity further, and even when the music is made more melodic by the synths, it's never made overly accessible.(It's probably for this reason that Iron Maiden is regarded as being more uncompromising and true to metal as Priest overall, which actually isn't true for the most part but in this case certainly was, I have to admit)As such, Turbo was a glam metal album far too radio-friendly to be real heavy metal, while Somewhere In Time is proto-power metal at its finest and less radio-friendly than a lot of Maiden's other 80's albums.\n\nIn addition to all of these elements, this album also has another incredible strength in that it has two songs so sublime that if they were the only good songs on the album, it would still get a good rating. Those songs would be the opener and the closer, which is another stroke of brilliance since the album not only sucks you in fantastically, but also ends masterfully. If this was all that was good about the album it would still kick a huge ton of ass. But it isn't, as there are another six songs here, and amazingly none of them are genuinely weak! One thing I've often criticised Maiden for is their inconsistency, both from album to album and from song to song. Along with Piece Of Mind, the debut and Killers, this album mostly breaks that mold, because although not all of the songs are equally good, none of them are bad. They just have the occasional weak moment, and nothing so terrible as to ruin anything. Of course Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son is also extremely consistent, but that album was too light and commercial. Somewhere In Time is not. \n\nThere are yet more reasons why this album is such as a masterpiece. Moving past the things I've already discussed, let's go on to heaviness. This album has tons of it. Great, big, heaving tons, actually, to the point where combined with the almost extreme levels of speed in places it leans very close to thrash and speed metal. It also knows when to slow down though as to not become monotonous, and that's another thing that goes towards making it in some ways full-on power metal, and even more incredibly does so in a way that is startlingly ahead of its time. It uses slow, crushing riffs in some places(Stranger In A Strange Land, parts of Sea Of Madness and Alexander The Great), mid paced chugging ones in others(Wasted Years, the rest of Alexander The Great), and even ridiculously fast and aggressive ones(The title track, lots of Sea Of Madness, Heaven Can Wait, lots of The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner and Deja Vu). And it does all this with a monstrous guitar tone, one heavier and thicker than anything they previously had. It really helps to make an album true heavy metal if it actually sounds heavy as fuck. This album does, and this also helps in the faster sections and is perhaps another reason why this album is less appealing to casual fans than Powerslave or Seventh Son - the sheer fucking heaviness of it is too much for weaklings. And so it should be - they don't even want to hear heavy fucking metal, they want to hear nice hard rock and just feel very relaxed about it. Fuck that. Those posers have no place in metal yet they have corrupted the minds of otherwise good people into thinking this album is weaker than its predecessor and successor, when the absolute opposite is the real truth. The real answer is simple: don't listen to casual fans or pop magazines because they know shit all about real heavy metal. This is metal for genuine metalheads - hardcore, heavy as fuck, metal as fuck and extremely progressive, complicated and amazingly epic while still retaining a strong sense of melody without selling out.\n\nSomewhere In Time hits you over the head with heavy riff after heavy riff, and when it does go into the melodic harmonised riffs, it does so appropriately and tastefully instead of in order to make the album more accessible to non-metalheads. And the way the synths and guitars are all combined together with incredible songwriting and stunning progressiveness makes this in a lot of ways more than just proto-power metal, but actually real power metal that was doing stuff the rest of the actual power metal scene wouldn't do for nearly ten years. They all focused on speed more than anything else - case in point being Helloween, whose debut came out just one year before this album. It was speed metal, very different from the power metal that would come later. The Keeper Of The Seven Keys albums were certainly power metal, but still focused mainly on speed and in a lot of ways actually sounded very much like Iron Maiden. But Maiden were first - with this album they may very well have laid the seeds for everything that followed - all of the complex, progressive and epic elements of the genre that would not be refined until the 90's. Blind Guardian's Imaginations From The Other Side is a good example of all of the best elements of power metal coming together as one. This is a prototypical example of effectively the same thing, only nine years earlier. \n\nAnd that's another amazing thing about this album - while there are some incredible moments here and there, for the most part there doesn't appear to be any absolute genius in every song. It's just the way everything comes together as a whole - the guitars, vocals, synths, drums, and bass - and of course the band's songwriting skills, which were at their absolute peak here, especially Steve Harris - that is so brilliant. As such one might imagine that this album is better listened to as a whole than just in separate songs. It works great that way but unlike its follow up, this ain't no concept album and songs such as Caught Somewhere In Time and Alexander The Great are fantastic where listened to alone or as part of the whole.\n\nBefore I get onto the songs, I must mention one other thing. The only possible negative aspect of the album, and in many ways it's equally a positive one - a double edged sword, if you will - is its sometimes overly dark nature. One reason Powerslave irritated the shit out of me was its overt lightness and happiness. Somewhere In Time is completely different - it shows, in most of the songs here at least the \"dark side\" of power metal, or what would become power metal. In some cases it really kicks arse, such as Sea Of Madness. In others, such as some parts of The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner and Deja Vu, the melodies become too sad and depressing and so the album no longer makes you feel good and powerful but brings you down. This is a shame, and it's one of just a couple of slight problems I have with an otherwise brilliant album. Thankfully for the most part it's just content to be reasonably dark while being incredibly epic and properly progressive in a good way, as opposed to the fake pseudo-prog crap on its predecessor.\n\nThe album opens with a song so perfect that it's hard to believe the man who wrote it is the same guy who wrote the pop-metal hit \"Aces High\". That song is \"Caught Somewhere In TIme\", one of the album's apexes and a good example of how a band with brilliant skills and strong determination can truly do virtually anything if they put their minds to it. It begins with a brilliant harmonised riff, of the melodic kind that I've often complained about in the past, but I won't here because it works so well. The synths are combined with it to create an awesome sound. Then the drumbeats start, and I'm already half headbanging at this point even though there's nothing heavy yet, it's just like that. This continues up until near the 1 minute mark and then the heavy riffs come crashing in underneath a higher-pitched one. Real fucking heaviness, not pansy half heaviness with a flaky guitar tone. Shortly after this Bruce's singing comes in and...wow, I am impressed. Is this really the same guy who did the stupid cheesy singing on Aces High and Two Minutes To Midnight, or whose vocal acrobatics on The Duellists sounded like a kangaroo on helium about to explode? I kid myself...yeah, of course that's ol' Bruce. The difference is that he no longer sounds cheesy as fuck and really annoying but is actually singing awesomely. There's a slightly gritty undertone to his voice which he also uses on other parts of this album, on Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son, and more majorly on No Prayer For The Dying and Fear Of The Dark, although the latter two are an entirely different kettle of fish that I won't bother discussing here. It just works wonderfully, and this time, so does his more \"operatic\" kind of singing. How? I don't know, but whatever the reason he just manages to pull it all off without being cheesy even when he goes really high. The chorus is especially awesome, and yeah, it's catchy, but not in that horrible poppy way like some of Maiden's past hits are. It's just memorable and cool and it works really well. It's really bizarre how it works so much better than when he did the highs on the previous album...maybe it's because the music is far stronger. The solo section is also incredible, and this brings us to another brilliant aspect of this song - it's not only really heavy, powerful, and melodic without being lame or weak, but also extremely progressive and epic without sounding like Maiden attempting to be a pretentious art-rock band. Here they are properly progressive, and most importantly, are so in a metal way as opposed to a rock or hard rock one. This song is Maiden's longest opener yet, topping 7 minutes - yet once it gets heavy, it stays heavy and uses the solo to add melody as opposed to overusing harmonised guitar riffs. Finally it ends in a pure heavy metal way with all of the guitars and drums crashing in that winding down manner that's so representative of the genre. What a song. I still cannot understand how Aces High and similar songs are more popular than this one even among hardcore Maiden fans. It's just following the fucking herd, doing what the casual fans and masses do - not very metal at all. But in any case this is a near perfect song that shows what a great songwriter Steve Harris in particular is, although the whole band is obviously very talented. \n\nRemember I said earlier that if the first and last tracks on the album were the only good ones the album would still be great? Thankfully that isn't the case as \"Wasted Years\" follows the opener, and while not on the same level by any means it's an excellent song nonetheless. This is certainly more catchy and commercial than most of the other songs on here. But unlike prior Maiden \"hits\", it's not unbearably shitty and is in fact really good. The intro is a little weird, definitely making good use of the synth in a very \"spacey\" way, and by that I am referring to sounding futuristic, not high. It works though, and then the heavy riffs kick in just before the half minute mark. The brilliant production really accentuates the bottom end of the guitars, resulting in one headbanging quite enjoyably as opposed to trying to headbang to a riff that doesn't even sound heavy because of shitty guitar production. It's a fairly simple song, not too progressive and certainly nothing like the brilliance of the opening song, but that's the thing - this album is not pretentious. It doesn't try to be constantly prog and epic when it doesn't need those aspects in its sound. This song works well as what it is, and again, the production and the guitars' monstrous tone and huge bottom end prevents it from being anything but true heavy fucking metal. It's a shame that this song is more popular than Caught Somewhere In Time though, and really does show that a lot of Maiden fans are more hard rockers and pop listeners than genuine metalheads.\n\nInstead of being comfortable to settle down into something easier, Maiden ups the ente yet again with the almost brutal \"Sea Of Madness\". One of the heaviest songs on here(not that anything on the album isn't heavy and metal as fuck, but this song is especially so), it opens with a skullcrushing riff that shows, in this case at least, how Iron Maiden simply used synth to make their sound more epic while actually going in an even heavier direction than they had before, while Priest sadly resorted to pop-metal the same year. Anyway, after this skullcrushing continues, Bruce's vocals kick in, and again they work very well. The pre-chorus and chorus are both extremely powerful, both in heaviness and in the way Bruce sings, and the synths here are both majestic and epic. It's a somewhat dark and even melancholic song in a lot of ways but this is no detriment, in fact quite the opposite. A little later we get a clean break, but do I then become incredibly angry at this non-metal moment? No, because in this case it isn't non-metal and sounds nothing like the clean breaks on their other albums. Instead, it makes the song even darker and allows the solo to work even better than it would have otherwise. Then the heaviness returns about a minute later, and remains until the end of the song.\n\nAnother thing worth mentioning here is the absolute lack of any blues influence on this album at all. Sure, if one looked hard enough they could probably find a riff using some part of the blues scale somewhere, but for the most part there is nothing like this. NOTB was the last Maiden album with any significant NWOBHM elements, and after that, Maiden became less and less bluesy with each album. Piece Of Mind didn't have much in the way of a NWOBHM sound but there were a few riffs here and there. Powerslave had even less of such as a sound(one part of that album which I actually kind of like), and had three songs that very strongly influenced early power metal. Somewhere In Time, though, was a far bigger step away from this sound into something closer to speed and thrash metal with a really strong melodic sense and a great deal of heaviness with virtually no bluesy sounds or NWOBHM elements at all - thus it is proto-power metal. \n\nFollowing the brilliance of Sea Of Madness, one might assume that this album can't possibly stay equally as strong as its beginning, and they would be right, as \"Heaven Can Wait\" isn't quite as fantastic as any of the preceding tracks. But it's far from bad, and is in fact very good. For a start, it's got truckloads of heaviness and aggression, with the speed now reaching thrash like levels and the riffs crushing - and indeed, a lot of the song is great heavy fucking metal. The two main problems the song has are this: the intro is overlong and slightly annoying, and the chorus is irritatingly happy and, unlike virtually anything else on the album actually does sound quite cheesy. No, make that very cheesy. But it's still quite acceptable. Why? Because aside from the chorus(the intro ain't that bad), everything else about this song is actually pretty fucking awesome. First off, as I said the riffs are crushing and this is pretty much speed or thrash. There are a mixture of aggressive riffs and slower chugging ones, even a chugging breakdown somewhere - I give up, this is pretty much a cross between thrash and power with some good ol' plain heavy thrown in for good measure. In addition, like the title track it's over 7 minutes long and very progressive - there are two solos, one somewhere around the two minute mark and another a couple of minutes later. In between them is a slower crushing section with some great vocals from Bruce and good use of synth and lead. Then the song goes back to its original pattern and finally ends. If one can look past the chorus, this song actually kicks ass.\n\nAt this point we come to \"The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner\", a song that is for the most part brilliant, and only has a couple of weak points. It starts out with a slightly depressing lead which repeats a few times, then a slow heavy riff starts underneath with slightly heavier drumbeats, which also repeats, and just before the 1 minute mark it gets almost brutally heavy as crushing semi-thrash riffs come in along with Bruce's vocals. This is not astounding stuff, but works great anyway, as does the chorus. Then we come to the one part of the song I have a problem with - a clean break made up of harmonised lead guitar riffs. It's not bad, and it's definitely far better than the shitty commercial harmonised riffs on a certain other Maiden album. But it's still somewhat unnecessary, or maybe it isn't...I'm not sure. All I do know is that a lot of this section uses very depressing melodies. I wouldn't normally mind this, and I certainly prefer it to overly happy harmonised riffs. Except for the fact that whenever I hear this section, I get this horrible mental image of used tires bouncing across a road under a desolate grey sky in some horrible, industrial, cheap city, and then an image of a fucking emo kid alone in a ridiculously desolate park also under a grey sky, listening to this song and being all depressive and cutting his wrists. Disgusting. Then I am reminded of a woman who I love, who may not reciprocate my affections, and I feel no better than one of those fucking emo faggots, and I get depressed and angry. That pretty much makes the song rather unpleasant to listen to.\n\nThe rest of this song is good, and even that section is good - it just makes me feel negative and for obvious reasons I don't like that. Unfortunately it means that a song I otherwise like is very hard to enjoy because it makes me feel down.\n\nFollowing this, we come to what is in a lot of ways my least favourite song on this album, but which is still good nevertheless, as \"Stranger In A Strange Land\" starts. It begins with bass and a drumbeat before the heavy guitars come in. It's much slower than anything else on here, but still retains a proto-power metal feel due to the synths and some of the leads. Unfortunately it has a clean break which is slightly annoying, but because the solo playing during it is so good it's still superior to the clean breaks on this album's predecessor. Then the heaviness returns. It's a good song, just nothing exceptional. I must point out that the way the riff fades off under Bruce's vocals and then comes back is a little annoying too, but it's not that big of a deal.\n\nWow, is this album consistent or what? I've gone through six entire songs and not a single one of them has been bad by any means. And the quality doesn't let up there, as \"Deja Vu\" is one of the strongest songs on the album. Beginning with some synth playing under a slightly depressive lead, this fades out and then the drums kick in with, unfortunately, a harmonised lead riff that makes me feel very sad if I think about it too much. This, too, is related to the same problem with the same woman and is really quite silly, but true. If I don't and just try to enjoy it, though, I find it to be a great song. After this riff the song gets heavy - really fucking heavy. The drumbeats here are close to full on thrash beats, and the speed and heaviness of the guitars is pretty extreme by Maiden standards too. Bruce's vocals are again great here, proving that when he's more restrained, or given better material to work with, he sings great. When he's allowed to write half the songs on the album and be as cheesy as he likes is when things go wrong, as has happened unfortunately many times over Maiden's career. This song also has a great middle section which is kind of clean, but with really great guitaring, really epic and all of that. It's also a bit depressing in some ways, which is weird as most of the melodies Maiden use aren't, but this album seems to have plenty of them. Odd. The song ends on a good, heavy note. A great song regardless.\n\nHowever, the best is yet to come, as Iron Maiden now pull out all of the stops for the last song on the album. Hell, they've been pulling out all of the stops for the entire album really - that's why it kicks so much arse. Maiden really did everything right here, and the final song is just the icing on the cake, but what a delicious icing that is. We are talking about \"Alexander The Great\", an absolute masterpiece in numerous ways, with one or two slight faults that nevertheless do not stop it from ending this album gloriously to say the least. It opens with a quote from Philip Of Macedon and some wind effects, which creates an epic mood right from the start. Then the drumbeat and synths begin, or is it guitars? In this case I'm actually not sure, but this whole section is very light. This is one of the two minor problems I have with this otherwise amazing song - the intro is too long. The whole section repeats a couple of times, but does so very slowly, and then there is a guitar solo played over the drumbeat instead with one of the main melodies. It's great, but did the intro really need to be over a minute and a half long? Actually, maybe it did. That's the thing - I say that I would prefer it to be shorter, but if it was, would it still work as well? Probably not, because this is a song where all of the separate parts come together to form one great whole. They all need to be there, and if the intro was trimmed there wouldn't be the great build up before the heaviness kicks in at around 1:36 into the song. From that point onwards the song is no longer just good but truly awesome. The riffs are slightly middle-eastern sounding here but this is perfectly appropriate given the subject matter. Bruce's vocals are at their most theatrical on this song, and some could look upon the whole thing as somewhat cheesy considering the way it is done. But to be honest, I'm loving it so much that I couldn't care less. It's that brilliant. There's a great use of a harmonised guitar riff not too long after the first chorus which is actually awesome, and when it comes around for a third and fourth time combined with the synths in a higher pitch it becomes close to sublime. So epic and majestic, just like the song's subject matter. It just sounds so grandiose, even more so than anything else on the album so far. After another vocal section we reach the song's second weak point, and unfortunately this is something really annoying that could have been changed. It's a clean break lasting about 40 seconds that has no purpose whatsoever. It could easily have been heavy guitars instead of clean. I suppose they put it in there for an effect of contrast, and it doesn't seem to be done for commercial reasons so I don't hate it, but it's annoying. After this however the song is completely perfect. As the clean break ends heavy riffs come crashing back down with a strange effect and a really strong middle-eastern overtone. Truly epic. Then chugging riffs begin, and over them a brilliant solo commences. This whole section lasts about two minutes. This is how to do prog-metal, kids. Not overuse of clean breaks and harmonised riffs that go nowhere, but genuinely complex songs that also don't try too hard to appeal to the fucking mainstream. The little bass breaks in this section are a little odd, but only serve to make everything more progressive, which for this song is definitely a good thing. Finally, Bruce's vocals come back in, and after a little more of this the song ends with the heavy sort of middle eastern riffs that originally started about six minutes earlier. Wow, what a song!\n\nI'm still baffled by the number of fans who claim that this album is a stepping stone between Powerslave and Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son and weaker than both of them, because as far as I can see it's the absolute opposite. Powerslave was an inferior stepping stone to the truly majestic, epic, and progressive, genuinely proto-power metal songs on this masterful album. Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son was a good followup but too pretentious for its own good with being a concept album and all in addition to being too commercial and not very metal in many places. I don't know why more people don't see things this way...I guess the mainstream has corrupted their opinions.\n\nI'll briefly touch on one other thing which I think is a big part of why this album kicks so much ass. Bruce's contribution, or more accurately the lack of it. On every other single Maiden album he's sung on save for NOTB, he's always contributed writing to at least one song. Here he is just Maiden's vocalist, albeit a very good one, and seems to be more restrained and mature in that regard too(I.E. no stupid vocal acrobatics like the shit he pulled on The Duelists, again a song from Powerslave. Grrrrr....). Almost every song here was written by Steve Harris, and a couple by Adrian Smith. The result? Iron Maiden's strongest album overall. From the guitars, to the vocals, to the bass, to the drums, to the synths, and the speed, power, progressiveness and aggression all together - everything here just works. I'd go as far as saying this is even stronger than the debut and Killers. \n\nSure it's a shame that ol' Bruce didn't write any of the songs, but on the other hand maybe it isn't. Most of the Maiden songs I hate the most were either co-written or entirely written by him. Bruce is great for the most part, but it's pretty weird how Maiden's best album, which ironically also has one or Bruce's best performances by a long way, is also the only album aside from NOTB which he did not contribute to in a songwriting sense at all.\n\nIf you want to know why this album is so awesome in a nutshell, just listen to Caught Somewhere In Time and then to Alexander The Great. Those two songs showcase everything great about this album, as well as everything Maiden does best. If you're not impressed, then you're a fucking poser.\n\nAll in all, it just comes down to, if not the fact that Bruce had no songwriting contributions, the simple nature of the way things happen - Maiden were in a good way at the time, and they really did pull out all of the stops here. And it really does work that well. If you want to hear real heavy metal with real metal riffs that are heavy and metal as fuck that also has brilliant use of melody in a way that is not overly commercial, fantastic and tasteful use of synths, brilliant speed and aggression combined with musical beauty and stunning progressiveness and epic songs of the greatest kind - all rounding out as a collection of brilliant, genuinely prog proto-power metal songs, then look no further than this album.\n",
        "\nWell blow me...this album is underrated. I suppose I shouldn't be too surprised by that though - most good things are, unfortunately.\n\nA strange statement, you may be thinking right now. Piece Of Mind? Underrated? Is he mad? That album is a well known classic!\n\nYeah, except in comparison to its painfully opposite followup, it is. That album suffers from the reverse extreme - it's overrated, and doesn't deserve it. In fact, for the most part it's total crap. But that's another review.\n\nStill, it's an important factor, one that I feel is often missed in discussing the albums of our favourite enormous heavy metal band, a band so well regarded, known, and praised by damn near everyone from 13 year old teeny boppers to 68 year old geriatrics with \"nostalgia\" for the \"good old days\". Of course, in doing so they often neglect the true Metal Gods, a band that laid down all of the blueprints for pure heavy metal following Sabbath, and without which Maiden would be nothing like they are. Sad as it may be it's true - face it, Judas Priest is not as well regarded by the majority of the world, or even by most metalheads, as Iron Maiden. Is this right? No, and in fact the opposite should be true. But it isn't, because mediocrity draws people to it in droves like a swarm of flies is drawn to a dung heap. Sure, it tastes like crap, and it is crap, but it's sustaining.\n\nOk, that was a cruel and unfair comparison. Iron Maiden aren't remotely a dung heap. Nevertheless, their music has and never will be as influential or as purely great as Priest's, in my opinion, and hopefully the opinions of everyone with genuine intelligence. \n\nHow is this relevant to my review of Piece Of Mind, you may ask? Well, much as I far prefer Priest, I still like Maiden, and comparing their stuff to Priest's albums from the same period is very interesting. What we have here is exactly the reason why Maiden have been more respected everywhere, including a lot of the most extreme fringes of the metal world, than Priest - an album of daring inventiveness, with epic lyrical subjects, brilliant compositions, fantastic musicianship, and awesome performances all around. By comparison, Priest in this time was releasing albums that, while great, were not, for the most part, either as progressive or(and this is the false part)as \"properly metal\" as Maiden were. Do I agree with this? On the former, yes, but most certainly not on the latter, which is why I labeled it a \"false part\", because it is. Judas Priest are and always will be more purely and truly heavy metal than Iron Maiden could ever be. \n\nBut I digress. The main point is that It's albums like this that have gotten Maiden an almost ridiculous amount of respect and recognition from everyone, even pop critics, as they are daringly progressive and epic, not afraid to go way over the top in order to fulfill this potential while still keeping a tether on the level of cheese to make sure it doesn't go too far. And here, they genuinely succeed at this brilliantly, with only a couple of weaker songs amongst(gasp)actually consistent quality for once.\n\nOne of my biggest gripes with Maiden(which I still have)that applies to almost all of their albums, including the \"classics\", is their level of consistency, or lack thereof. They have a good song which becomes shitty due to some idiotic songwriting, then a brilliant song, then an average one, then a great one, then an overrated good one, then an overrated bad one, then a terrible one, then an underrated good one, and end it with a brilliantly thought out, stunningly epic closer which somehow manages to overshadow the vast pool of mediocrity that fills a lot of the previous tracks on the album. What I just described is, in a nutshell, The Number Of The Beast. Great in places but painfully shitty in others, and still dreadfully overrated.\n\nIt seems to me as if Maiden has \"wild streaks\", or something along those lines, as after an extremely inconsistent yet still widely loved classic, they released this piece(pun not intended)of proto-power metal majesty, which believe or not is completely consistent from start to finish. Even the weaker tracks are as they fit within the pattern properly - there's nothing here along the lines of \"Gangland\" being followed by \"Total Eclipse\", or on the original version of that album, \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\". Instead, the worst of this album is simply boring and not all that great. Not to mention, the first six songs on the album are all good! Wow...for Maiden that is really impressive. If only the same was true of their next record...\n\n\"Where Eagles Dare\" is a great opener, using all of the classic qualities of the band to its advantage. Starting with an almost pulse-pounding drumbeat by the then new drummer Nicko McBrain, the heavy riffing kicks in soon afterwards, and it's great. At the same time, the album's one significant flaw becomes apparent instantly - the guitar tone. It's quite shitty in a lot of ways, sounding cardboard and fairly thin, and gives the album more of a hard rock vibe than a heavy metal one. This is a problem I've always had with Maiden, that frequently makes me question their metal status - if they are the best example of true heavy metal, then why does even one of their classic albums sound more like hard rock than heavy fucking metal? \n\nOne could blame the producer I suppose, but he's Martin Birch, the same chap who produced Killers, Number Of The Beast, and the next five albums after this one, so I don't know why. It's a problem that Powerslave also shares(and which is even worse in that regard), but that Somewhere In Time does not, and then Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son just sounds weird. What the fuck? It's weird. I find it very hard to believe that Maiden intentionally asked Mr. Birch to make the guitars sound shittier than they did on the previous album, or to make everything slightly less loud and heavy, yet that's exactly what happened. Of course, maybe Birch was ordered to make it sound weaker by the record company in the hopes that it would be less abrasive to pop listeners and thus make more money. Considering that it did, that's entirely possible. And despite the fact that Maiden supposedly never sold out during this period(which is a lie anyway), I bet they liked the idea of extra cash, so they thought \"fuck it, who cares...we'll be richer. If it's a little less metal, we can just tell the fans that ol' Martin was drunk when he produced it or something! Yeah, that'll work! No one will figure out the real truth!\" Sorry, Maiden, but you didn't fool this metalhead.\n\nSarcasm aside(and I wasn't joking entirely, in fact a large part of me believes that could genuinely be the reason why the guitars sound so weak), this aspect of the album is it's one serious failing, and a rather large one at that, one that made me detract points from the score which would be a lot higher if the album actually sounded completely like a heavy metal album.\n\nIn any case, Where Eagles Dare is a good song, maybe even a great one, and certainly more consistent and interesting than \"Invaders\" from NOTB. However, it's not perfect. Its middle section is way too repetitive. The solo is pretty good, but as good as they are, Dave Murray and Adrian Smith are no K.K. Downing and Glenn Tipton. Also, this song isn't very progressive, but it goes on for far too long. However, this is still a very good song and easily the best way Maiden could have opened the album. I must also point out that Bruce's singing here, while great, is far from flawless. Try as he might, Bruce is no Rob Halford. He just doesn't have that indelible \"inhuman banshee\" quality that Rob is possessed of. To be blunt, he's too ordinary a singer in comparison. Sure, he wipes the floor with the majority of normal rock singers in terms of range and ability, but those two aspects of singing aren't everything, and sometimes a little grit is nice. Bruce has none here at all - he's constantly hitting the high notes, often sounding very cheesy in his vocal acrobatics, and at the same time not extreme enough to transcend cheesiness and go beyond normal human singing. \n\nNext we have a power ballad, \"Revelations\", a tune penned by Dickinson. Considering Bruce is responsible for co-writing two worthless abominations on Powerslave, and for directly and solely writing another song on that album so terrible that it makes me want to eat my own shit, I don't have all that much faith in his songwriting skills, and it's a telling fact that Somewhere In Time, which is probably the best album Maiden ever released, has no contributions from Dickinson at all. However, in this case, \"Revelations\" is actually a great song. Very well written, and while it's obviously tailored for the best possible usage of ol' Bruce's vocals(understandable I suppose as he wrote it, but still, metal is not about vocals), it works excellently from start to finish. Very dark, beautiful atmosphere, and some great guitar moments too. Here Bruce's singing is at it's best too: instead of wailing high all of the time, he uses much more of his range; not sounding gritty or anything, but singing both forcefully and softly depending on what's needed. Unlike his over the top performances on Maiden's faster songs, Bruce is completely convincing here, which I think is partly because he doesn't try so hard. Either way, despite its non-metal elements, this is a great power ballad, with a fantastic atmosphere and really is a proto-power metal song in numerous ways.\n\n\"Flight Of Icarus\" follows, and while a good song, I wouldn't say it's great. For a start, aside from Bruce's fairly good(if, again, slightly cheesy)performance, it's not very metal at all. From the tempo, to the breaks, and that awful, weak guitar tone that is a constant weakness on the entire album, this is more hard rock than heavy metal. It's no wonder it cracked the Billboard 200 - plenty of hard rock has and still does. The only truly metal aspect here, aside from the lyrics and(to some degree)the singing, is the occasional chugging in the riffs, and even that isn't anything special. So why did I say this album is consistent? Well, it still is - even though this song isn't great, it's good, because of Bruce's singing, the fun and easily headbangable riffs, and the solo, which is fairly inspired for once. It really does scream \"single\", though, which is hardly a very metal quality and one more likely to be seen on a very commercial hard rock or pop album than a metal one. It's not perfect, but it's good nevertheless.\n\nNext up is \"Die With Your Boots On\", another song with a somewhat hard rock vibe to it, that all the same remains metal for the most part. Here Bruce's singing is far more interesting - for once, there's a little grit to his voice in some of the verses. Also, the riffs are quite aggressive almost and pretty heavy, and the lyrics are very dark. Not much else to say really - another good song, not as good as the first two really but better than Flight Of Icarus.\n\nNow we reach one of Maiden's supposed \"finest classics\", The Trooper. However, does it live up to its reputation? Absolutely. Yes, this is one of those songs that really is \"all that\", like Hallowed By Thy Name, Killers, Phantom Of The Opera, Wrathchild, and numerous other classic songs by numerous other bands. Although it's very melodic in a way that could be considered overly commercial, I wouldn't say this is nearly as sickeningly prominent a 'quality' as it is in \"Run To The Hills\", \"Aces High\", Two Minutes To Midnight\", or even Flight Of Icarus from earlier on this same album. For a start it's quite pounding. It's very fast, and has heavy riffs throughout as well as a good performance by Dickinson that, while again going over the top on more than one occasion, works very well here. I still have a lot of trouble seeing most of the stuff on this album as pure heavy metal, especially with that horrible guitar tone, but this song really is genuinely great. A little overrated, but nowhere near as badly as the shit on Powerslave. \n\n\"Still Life\" follows, and here we reach a song that is often criticised. Why? I have no idea. If people really allow themselves to be bothered by a humourous intro or the fact that a song that is SUPPOSED to have a long buildup does have one, then they obviously have other issues in their lives. Seriously, this song kicks arse. I find the backwards intro to be quite funny, and the rest of the song just bleeds atmosphere. So very dark, and that's another thing I love about it. It's quite a disturbing subject, about a man who loses his mind and, seeing faces in a pool from his madness, commits suicide and forces his woman to do so at the same time. Bruce's performance here is fantastic - really using the calmer side of his vocals earlier on in the song, and then taking on a great tone for what follows after the heavy guitars come in at around 1.21. The one and only weakness here is the \"Nightmares! Spirits calling me!\" section, which comes across as cheesy due to its hokey and obvious nature. Other than that, a great and unfairly underrated song.\n\n\"Quest For Fire\" then starts, and I have to ask myself: Just what is wrong with this song? Why is it so widely panned and even hated? Oh, yeah...the lyrics. They're silly, inaccurate, and cheesy. So what? I'm more inclined to believe it was an intentional bit of fun on Maiden's part when they wrote the part that mixed dinosaurs with humans in the same time period, rather than them actually getting something very important wrong by accident. One of metal's biggest problems is that it often takes itself too seriously, and what I really do like about Maiden is that they don't usually do this. This song may be somewhat silly, but Maiden knows that - they're just goofing around, writing a fun yet epic little song that makes one feel invigorated and inspired. Its simplicity is its beauty - it only has a couple of riffs, but all of the guitaring here is uniformly excellent. In addition, the epic feel created by Bruce's singing, the lyrics themselves despite(or perhaps because of)their cheesiness, and the guitars all add up to create a marvelous atmosphere that really is a proto-power metal sound. If I had to name one song as possibly the first power metal song ever, this would likely be it, silly lyrics or not.\n\nThen we ge to the album's first actual weak spot, Sun And Steel. Not a bad song at all - just plain boring, to be honest. Not much to say...the special part is Bruce's vocals, which are overdubbed during several points in the song to create a choral effect. Very epic and definitely a precursor to power metal vocals. This was done several times before on the album too, but it stands out the most here, I think, although that could be because the rest of the song is so boring and ordinary, which is rather disappointing.\n\nFinally, there is \"To Tame A Land\". This song is based on Frank Herbert's Dune, an excellent book well worth reading, although I'm not sure if the lyrics here are entirely accurate or not. Either way, this song is excellent and a great and suitably epic closer to the album. From the soft(ish)melodic intro to the heavy chugging riffs that follow, plus all the other numerous sections, this song is close to a masterpiece and has no problems. While not the best of their \"epic\" songs, it fits this album perfectly. Maiden was going into really grand stuff, but they didn't want to take it too far at this point, with this new proto-power metal style they were playing only starting properly right here, on Piece Of Mind. So, while this song isn't a work of compositional genius, it doesn't have to be - it's great on its own terms.\n\nThe most interesting aspect of this song is the history behind its conception and inception. Apparently Steve Harris asked Frank Herbert for permission to title the song \"Dune\". However, Mr. Herbert's agent apparently said something back along the lines of: \"No. Because Frank Herbert doesn't like rock bands, particularly heavy rock bands, and especially rock bands like Iron Maiden\". Hilarious. Another example of the \"older generation\" pooh-poohing metal, supposedly at least. In actuality they probably all love it but just pretend to hate it because it's how they are perceived. Thankfully this didn't become a big controversy like the idiotic \"Maiden are Satanists\" hype that took off in the US because of Number Of The Beast. Funny nonetheless.\n\nTo conclude: this is a very good album, one of the better 80's Maiden records. Its biggest strength, and the thing that firmly keeps in in metal territory despite its weak and hard rockish guitar tone, is this: it actually uses heavy guitar riffs as the basis for driving a song forward. On Powerslave and Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son, instead of doing this, Maiden would start with a heavy riff, and then subside into a melodic and weak one that one couldn't even headbang to, and vice versa. Instead of staying heavy, like heavy fucking metal is supposed to do, and keep the flowery melodies in the solos where they belong, Maiden planted their sickeningly commercial flowery melodies all over the place, but because they covered it up with \"amazing songwriting\" and \"progressive tendencies\", they got away with it and weren't called sellouts and pop-metal wannabes when they rightly should have been. Meanwhile, Priest laboured on producing real heavy fucking metal, and releases such as Defenders Of The Faith, a masterwork of heavy metal if there ever was one, were largely ignored in favour of the likes of Powerslave. It's disgusting, and just goes to show how the majority of people are too stupid to look past mediocrity for genuinely good music, and would sooner accept the former than the latter. That would be bad enough, but let's face it, the majority of people are not metalheads. If an album reaches No.1 on the charts, it's because everyone is buying it, not just metalheads, but rockers and evidently even pop lovers as well. So I could look past that. I can't and won't look past the fact that Powerslave is to this day more respected in the metal world, amongst genuine metalheads, than Defenders Of The Faith is, even though the former is a lame proggy hard rock album with an obscene level of cheese and disgusting poppy tendencies while the latter is a heavy fucking metal album with real balls.\n\nThat said, this album is also infinitely superior to Powerslave, yet gets less good reviews on average everywhere than it. Shows you just how easily people accept mediocrity.\n\nKeeping all of that in mind, this album, while not fantastic, is extremely good, with no real weaknesses aside from the occasional overuse of silly vocal acrobatics by Bruce and a guitar tone more suited to hard rock than to heavy metal. It's a great album, underrated as it's stuck between two horribly overrated records, neither of which are as good as it is. If you are a fan of power metal(especially the earlier stuff), epic songs, interesting lyrics, or just good old classic heavy metal, then this album is well worth getting.\n",
        "\nSo here we are, we've arrived at one of the albums that is considered to define heavy metal itself. Not thrash metal, not speed metal, not power metal, not death metal, and not black metal - just pure classic heavy metal. Does it? In a lot of ways, yes. But it also has some significant problems, two songs which I really dislike, and only three songs I consider to be absolutely perfect. It should be a masterwork but consistency is the name of the game here, and Number Of The Beast, for all of the praise constantly heaved upon it, is not consistent.\n\nSomething that is always lost upon most metal fans is the phenomenon of how Maiden sold out. Yes, sold out. It was with this album. Now before all of you suckers reading this decides I'm either a looney or an idiot, just think for a moment. Iron Maiden is considered to be a band that pretty much never sold out throughout their entire career. Now take Judas Priest, who were accused of selling out many times, first with Killing Machine and British Steel(even though the latter is now a metal classic anyway), then even worse with Point Of Entry, before redeeming themselves with Screaming For Vengeance and Defenders Of The Faith and then promptly selling out again, this time to the glam crowd, with Turbo. Most fans don't believe they regained their power again until Painkiller(Ram It Down, a highly underrated album in my view, is often considered to be little more than a slightly better successor to Turbo, which is total bullshit), and then that they lost it again with Jugulator. True? In some ways. Maiden, however, were never accused of truly selling out, as even No Prayer For The Dying and Fear Of The Dark are far less obviously commercial than the most commercial Priest records and their later stuff again lacks such criticisms. Meanwhile, their first seven albums are often considered to be virtually untouchable, and none of them even remotely a sell out no matter how much money they made.\n\nThe problem is that this is total nonsense. In its own way, The Number Of The Beast is a sellout. Not a bad one, in a lot of ways actually a good one, as becoming more popular obviously raised Maiden's already high spirits even more and led them to produce many more records, all of which were far more similar to this one than to the debut and Killers. It's a far less obvious sellout than British Steel as even the songs that yes, are designed for radio-play are not very clearly singles in this sense. But just look at the differences between this album and the first two. The debut was(at the time)fearlessly experimental and progressive, combining rock, punk, and metal together in a way no one had really ever done before and doing so with brilliant musicianship, excellent songwriting, and a very good singer who fit the style they were playing perfectly. Killers was less progressive but extremely good nonetheless, with again a high punk influence on all of the songs, great musicianship throughout, and more killer(pardon the pun)songwriting. Neither record was ever trying to be commercial - Maiden had a vision and they pursued it in exactly the way they wanted, they just happened to become popular anyway because they kicked ass.\n\nNow take this record. Despite its reputation to the contrary it's far less daring than the debut or even Killers. The riffs throughout are often far simpler, the songs themselves are for the most part actually less complex and progressive while at the same time often sounding more pretentious due to the singing(more on that soon), and the essential atmosphere, grit, and real, down to earth urban feel of the first two albums is gone, replaced by an overly slick production and a far more clean and civilised sounding singer. Granted, this has its strong points as well, since gritty raw production doesn't really suit the epic style they would subsequently go for, and nor would have Paul Di'Anno's vocals. Bruce does bring a certain power to the album, and he is genuinely a very good singer, the best examples of this being the songs Children Of The Damned and Hallowed By Thy Name(which, not coincidentally, are also the best songs on the record), as well as the overrated but still fairly good title track and most of Invaders. However, Maiden also lost something here. While this is still a NWOBHM album at its core, it also more than hints at the really epic sound they would begin playing on their very next album, a sound soon became nothing like NWOBHM at all, and more like proto-power metal. Of course this again has its strong points as well as its weak ones(one of the strongest being just how much this led to the development of power metal), but part of Maiden's original character was in Paul Di'Anno. When he left, something left with him - the part of Maiden that was how they used to be, their lack of pretentiousness but their desire to create something new and exciting, which they did brilliantly. And then Bruce came along, and Maiden started getting pretentious, lost all of their grit right after this album(the last traces of it can be found in the song 22 Acacia Avenue, one of the last urban themed songs they'd ever write), and yes, they did become more commercial. They just did so in such a subtle way that hardly anyone noticed.\n\nI place the songs on this album into three categories. One is the excellent category. Only three songs from the album fit into that one. Two is the very good category. Three songs also fit into that one. Three is the decent category, which only one song fits into. Then there's the mediocre category, which two songs fit into.\n\nThe album begins with Invaders, a song which fits into the \"very good\" category, and seems to be a strong start to say the least. The improved production does have one really good strong point: it highlights the guitars and makes them sound far heavier than they did before. Once it gets fast this song becomes skullcrushing heavy metal that at times borderlines on proto-thrash. So far so good. Then Bruce's singing comes in, and...well, it works, but it's so different in style and sound from his predecessor that you can tell this is a changed Maiden. It's far more over the top, which Paul never sounded like, and this is a shame as it means the song becomes quite cheesy in a lot of ways, and Bruce doesn't have the singing chops to make an over the top performance not sound cheesy all of the time. Even so it's still going ok...and then the chorus. By the gods, the chorus. Why? Why that awful happy tone when he screams \"INVAADERS! PILLAGING! INVAADERS! LOOTING!\" ? Why that dreadful five notes up five notes down major scale instead of an actual riff? When I first listened to this on a sampler ages ago it put me off the album so much that I took several more months to buy it. Things like this damn chorus actually made it harder for me to get into Maiden. A lot of other reviewers have commented on it too, and yes, it really is that bad. It virtually ruins the song, and the only reason it doesn't is because it lasts for just a few seconds. It prevents the song from ever becoming great and leaves it as just good. There were no unbearably shitty moments like this in either the debut or Killers. The solo is fairly short and not very memorable but ok, and other than that there isn't much to say. A fairly simple song really. If not for the chorus it would be in the excellent category. Speaking of the chorus, it's another example of how Maiden subtly sold out: they introduced poppy moments which could appeal to anyone and everyone, but didn't write actual love songs, so they weren't perceived as sellouts. It's something a lot of people don't notice when they should, and it's for that reason that I stopped caring what the majority of either other metalheads or Maiden fans say and decided to just judge their albums on an individual basis.\n\nHowever, we then have Children Of The Damned, a song which fits right into the \"Excellent\" category, and for a damn good reason: it kicks ass. From the deceptively gentle clean intro and verses, right to the mighty chorus and powerful heavy fucking metal riff behind it, and then after this repeats around the stupendous middle section which is just...well, sublime. The section from 2:20 to 3:01 is extremely well done, but then the part from 3:02 to 3:42 is absolutely brilliant, beautiful, and just plain outstanding, from the lovely but haunting melodies of the very heartfelt solo to the powerful crushing riffs underneath. It's moments like this that solidify this album as a good one despite its flaws, because this song is so fucking fantastic that the mediocre parts of the album don't matter while you're rocking out to Children Of The Damned.\n\nMy one and only criticism of this song is the lyrics themselves, which, despite working well, are not the often fairly serious and thought-provoking subject matter Maiden dealt with on their first two albums, but what basically amounts to fantasy nonsense. Yes, the film Children Of The Damned was an old school classic, but it was still kinda silly nevertheless. It's this kind of thing that led to Maiden overusing fantasy and mythology along with not particularly clever or interesting history lessons on albums like Piece Of Mind and Powerslave, and often being hideously cheesy in the process. However, I'll give it a pass here as this song is just too damn good for me to care about how serious or realistic the lyrics are.\n\nWe now reach The Prisoner, a song which fits into the \"decent\" category. It's not a bad song, but it really isn't all that good either. The intro from the TV Series is exceedingly cheesy and far too long, and the song just takes too damn long to get going by which point I've lost most of my interest. I was never a big fan of The Prisoner and Maiden manage to make it all seem even cornier than it really was, in fact probably a lot more so as the original series wasn't really that cheesy as far as I've heard. All I know is that I don't particularly enjoy this song. The \"heroic\" part where Bruce sings about escaping isn't inspiring to me either, because in order to really feel something here, you have to have felt for the real prisoner in the series, and I never did. The whole thing just wasn't my cup of tea, and so I can't really connect with the song as it's dealing with the same character. Again, not a bad song, but not a particularly good one either.\n\nThen comes along 22 Acacia Avenue...which is absolutely brilliant, perfect from start to finish, with great riffs, two awesome solos, and an interesting performance by Bruce. It easily fits into the \"excellent\" category. I don't know why this song is so underrated, and it's even more absurd that it often gets ignored while the likes of \"Run To The Hills\" receive infinite praise from everyone. For me it's the opposite, as this is one of my favourite songs on the whole album, while \"Run To The Hills\" never appealed to me at all.(more on that later) Anyway, aside from the great riffs and solos throughout, there isn't much to say actually, although Bruce's singing here is interesting, because he's obviously trying to go for the very gritty urban style that Paul always had, which is to be expected as this song is about the same character last featured in \"Charlotte The Harlot\", a great song from the debut album. Does he succeed? Sort of, as he certainly sounds quite different than he did on, say, Invaders. But he just hasn't got the dirty, raw kind of voice that really suits this style, often still sounding too clean, and the way he screams \"meet a lady that I knoooooooww\" is terrible, as is the way he mirrors this the next time it goes around slightly differently with \"you might even get it freeeeeeeee\"...ugh. Those kind of vocal acrobatics are what always put me off Bruce a little. Sure he's a good singer, but very few vocalists can make those acrobatics actually work, and Bruce ain't one of them. Rob Halford is, and interestingly, so is Hansi K\u00fcrsch of Blind Guardian, a very influential power metal band that were likely influenced themselves by Iron Maiden. But Bruce just isn't, and while he can occasionally pull it off(the way he sings the chorus on the song Caught Somewhere In Time from Somewhere In Time, for instance), he often can't. This is the only weak point to an otherwise great song though, and the breakdown in the middle with the heavy crushing riffs and the excellent solo is really awesome. The song also ends well. All in all, one of the best songs this album has to offer.\n\nNow we come to the infamous title track, a song I would place in the \"very good\" category. Most would consider it to be more worthy of being called excellent, but I disagree. Sure it's a classic song, and one of the best known of all metal songs. It's also remarkably straightforward, not very complex, not even very epic, and most of all, aside from the intro, not very dark. Lyrically it is but musically? The riffs are all very happy and upbeat and don't really paint a picture of the lyrics. When Iron Maiden previously wrote songs about very dark subjects(whatever \"Remember Tomorrow\" was about, Purgatory, Killers, etc)for the most part at least they actually sounded dark. Here they don't, which just goes to show that Number Of The Beast could very easily be called a sellout after all, as it wrote more obviously catchy and upbeat songs and certainly did make more money. One could argue that making more money was simply a side effect of better songwriting, but that's being pedantic, trying to make excuses for ideas that are very obviously commercial. Whether they're commercial in a good way or a bad way is up to the listener to decide. Personally, while I'd take the title track over a song like The Prisoner, and would place it on a roughly equal footing with Invaders, I don't like it as much as Children Of The Damned, 22 Acacia Avenue, or one of the later songs. (As a side note: this song was the one that caused everyone to call Maiden \"satanists\" - actually, not everyone, just the Christian side of the media, and it wasn't so much an assumption as an accusation. Either way it's fucking pathetic. Maiden weren't satanists, and even if they were, so what? The whole thing is dumb and shows just how much power idiotic religious fundies still have over our society. What's even dumber is that in the US, critics refused to acknowledge Maiden SIMPLY because they believed they were satanists. So the religious views of a band affect whether they're worthy of listening to? Those music critics should have been taken out and shot. If anyone wanted proof that the music media in America is still controlled by Christian fundamentalists, that's it right there. Utterly stupid.)\n\nNext up is a song beloved by virtually every Maiden fan...except for me. Run To The Hills is probably the most overrated song they ever wrote. It's slightly interesting lyrically but not enough to make up for its obviously commercial slant and not very good riffs. I find little worth listening to in this song and like a lot of others on here it's annoyingly happy sounding. Judas Priest's \"Savage\", while not one of my favourite songs by them either, dealt with the subject far better. The only thing really worth exploring is how Maiden didn't make it a song entirely about the cruelty of the persecution of American Indians, but also about the glory the settlers felt as they rode them down and \"drove them to the hills\". While I'm pleased Maiden decided to show the perspective of both sides rather than just one, I still don't like this song. I just find its construction annoying. In particular, it takes nearly 50 seconds to get to a riff one can properly headbang to. Maybe one can headbang to the first riffs, but I'm not sure. Isn't it a bizarre coincidence that the two most popular songs on this album, this one and the title track, both take a while to get going? It's just ironic that for two songs that are supposed to define heavy metal, they don't even start with heavy riffs one can bang their head to. \"Run To The Hills\" is a song I place in the \"mediocre\" category.\n\nThis wasn't the worst, though...that's just coming up. \"Gangland\" has to be one of the most painfully awful and pointless Maiden songs ever written. It's even worse than the overrated shit on Powerslave(and that's saying something, since everyone else loves that album)and the dreadful songs on No Prayer For The Dying and some of Fear Of The Dark. It isn't overrated, but it still sucks nonetheless. The intro is boring and the main riffs are neither interesting nor very memorable. It's another attempt to go back to the grittiness of the first two albums, but unlike \"22 Acacia Avenue\", which was a great song, this song is crap. It's neither gritty, raw, or menacing, it's just stupid. Definitely falls into the \"mediocre\" category, and I have nothing else to say about it. It's that forgettable as well as shitty.\n\nBut then...where the fuck did this come from? Suddenly \"Total Eclipse\" begins, and we have a winner again! This is a disgracefully underrated song that deserves a lot more credit for at least trying to be atmospheric. From the powerful, genuinely heavy intro to the mighty riffs throughout combined with a respectable performance by Bruce and some very dark lyrics about a rather apocalyptic scenario, plus genuine musical darkness for the first time since \"Children Of The Damned\", this is a song easily worthy of the \"very good\" category. I don't know why this wasn't included on the original album because it kicks ass.\n\nOne good thing about Maiden is that with the exception of Killers, you can be sure of hearing a very memorable song at the end of every one of their albums. And this is absolutely true of the magnificent \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\", a song that has justly gone down in history as a masterwork of heavy fucking metal. This really is strong, very much because of its amazing atmosphere, which is quite seriously dark, with nary a happy sounding riff or solo in sight, but also because of three other things: Bruce Dickinson's performance, which is truly great and really portrays the emotion of the character's feelings he is describing in a way that's so genuine you almost forget about the idiotic way he sung on some of the earlier songs, the lyrics, which are definitely of the thought-provoking type, and the brilliant riffs and solos throughout the entire song. For once the clean intro isn't annoying or tedious but works brilliantly at creating a dark feeling. Then when the heavy guitars kick in at around the 1.00 mark, things become truly fantastic. I have no problems whatsoever with this song - it's one of the defining songs of all heavy metal and is NOT overrated - it does deserve every single bit of praise it gets. A true masterpiece.\n\nSo what does that even out as, then? Three awesome songs, three very good ones, one average one and two poor ones. Overall a highish score(which is what I gave it), but not perfect.\n\nDespite all of my earlier criticisms, The Number Of The Beast is still an essential album, even if only for the three utterly brilliant songs, because they are so sublime that they transcend all of the album's various faults and weaknesses. It's more than that though - it's a piece of metal history, and deserves to be owned for that reason alone. While I wouldn't place it on the same level as its predecessors in terms of consistency, or as high on the scale of being inventive as Piece Of Mind or Somewhere In Time, or as high quality throughout as Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son, it's still a good album to say the least and from my perspective infinitely better than the ridiculously overrated Powerslave. A quality album that, despite it flaws, should be in every metalhead's collection nonetheless.\n",
        "\nWhy is this album so underrated? It's really strange that this album is so often passed up in favour of albums like Number Of The Beast and Powerslave, especially as the primary reason for that is often the perception that they have less filler songs. The irony is that the opposite is true - a couple of exceptions aside, almost every song on this album just plain works, period. And even the weaker ones are pretty good in their own ways.\n\nLike the self titled debut, Killers is a deeply atmospheric album with a great deal of the same rawness and grittiness and real, down to earth urban feeling that also characterised its predecessor, although the former of those two is somewhat reduced due to the much more polished production. While not as clean or as well produced as Number Of The Beast this is certainly less obviously raw than the debut. There's nothing wrong with that per se, and the heavier and stronger guitar tone actually helps for obvious reasons, but it does mean that the atmosphere, while still very strong in the same way as the debut, is a little less potent.\n\nNevertheless, this is an extremely well done album. The first song, The Ides Of March, is absolutely perfect and sets the mood brilliantly. Quite dark, almost menacing in a way, and very similar to what came before, but the improved production really accentuates the guitars. The riffs, while simple, are excellent, and it's such a truly heavy metal opening. The solo is also fairly simple, but again there's nothing wrong with that. It doesn't rely on a cheesy or poppy melody at all, which is another thing I love, and that I wish Maiden had kept on doing rather than just adding melodic riffs that you can't even headbang to right in the middle of their songs in order to make them more accessible to weak people, often not even genuine metalheads but hard rock fans and the like, who couldn't sit through real consistent heavy fucking metal riffs. This is something they unfortunately did do later, and it became so overdone that it often felt like they were just trying to become more popular and gain fans outside of the metal community in order to make more money - which is exactly what they did do, except they got away with it because they managed to keep a respectable image and still be fairly heavy, and were never accused of selling out, even when they should have been, because they hardly ever wrote love songs or anything that genuinely sounded too hard- rockish except to really trained ears. So they got away with writing pathetically stupid songs infested with horribly cheesy melodies designed to appeal to dumb and easily impressed people that somehow managed to become \"metal\" classics such as Aces High(in case any of you are thinking I'm off my rocker around now, I'm not, and I'm not joking either), Two Minutes To Midnight(not kidding here either), Bring Your Daughter To The Slaughter, Run To The Hills, and Holy Smoke. Predictable, simplistic songs with pop-influenced melodies designed to appeal to people too stupid to look past their insipidity. Killers has none of this shit. Even the two singles(Purgatory and Twilight Zone, and the latter wasn't on the original)have pretty much nothing along those lines. The former does have a melodic clean sounding break that does seem like a prelude to the kind of poppy bullshit they'd overuse later, but this isn't a major problem as it isn't overdone here.\n\nAnyway, long rant aside, that this manages to keep a consistent level of genuine heaviness along with excellent songwriting and great use of(more subtle)melodies and a respectable amount of grittiness with a dark atmosphere and NOT be too commercial is a testament to the band's skills and abilities and, at this point at least, their lack of any real pretentiousness. After the brilliant opener, Wrathchild kicks in, and this is a great song, a true classic and still played in Maiden's concerts to this day, for a bloody good reason: it's fucking great, real heavy metal despite its popularity. Di'Anno's voice here fits it perfectly; while Bruce sings it ok, I'd say Paul is much better suited for the atmosphere. It's a little short, but in a way this is more of a strength than a weakness. Rather punky in its own way, which is an interesting point that's often overlooked; yeah, we all know that Maiden's first two albums are punk influenced to one degree or the other, but the way they combined punk, rock, and metal together is what's so incredible. It's an element they sadly lost with Number Of The Beast for the most part, and after that record - well, just forget it, because it was then that they began their epic proto-power metal style, which was still good but lacking something essential that these two records have in abundance: real grittiness, urban atmosphere, and no fucking pretentious bullshit. Of course one could just as easily make the argument that their later style was simply different, and in its own way actually better due to the(somewhat) more complex songwriting, greater epicness, and more creative use of melody. That's a fair point and not one I entirely disagree with, but I still feel that they lost something after this record.\n\nThe most incredible thing here is the lack of filler. Remember how I said that earlier? Well, it's absolutely true; after the awesome Wrathchild, the equally brilliant Murders In The Rue Morgue kicks in, and it's another aggressive, almost brutal ass-kicker with a beautiful and atmospheric intro, which is then followed up with what at the time must have been some of the fastest riffing ever. That punk like aggression and power was an essential element of early Maiden, and one of their most overlooked strong points, I would say.\n\nBut it doesn't stop here, because then we have Another Life, which, if one chooses to nitpick, is not quite up to the level of the preceding three songs, but is still really good. Then comes Genghis Khan, a great and fucking heavy instrumental metal attack showcasing the band's skills without being too flashy. Innocent Exile follows, and it's another very atmospheric and well done song. Truth be told, these are less good songs than the best songs on Number Of The Beast, but they're also less good songs than the best songs on this same album, and you can't have everything.\n\nThen comes the title track, which is amazingly awesome in every way imaginable. The bass dominated intro is one bone of contention I do have, because it goes on a bit too long, and Paul's screams actually aren't all that brilliant. But when it gets heavy at around the 1.00 minute mark it gets really good. From then on it's several minutes of heavy metal at its best. The almost clean sounding melodic riff from 2:18 to 2:28 is unfortunately very obviously a precursor to the all of the overused melodic and not at all headbangable riffs that would virtually ruin the heaviness of some of their later albums(at least for me), but here it works, for two reasons: it only lasts 10 seconds, and it's a prelude to one of the most classically heavy fucking metal riffs in the whole of heavy fucking metal ever. Seriously, that riff from 2:29 to 2:39 is just...well, one of those riffs, the kind that when you hear loud makes you bang your head until it hurts and/or go completely bonkers. It's that metal, and really shows that Maiden were heavy as fuck well before The Number Of The Beast. The rest of the song is brilliant too, and also features one of Paul Di'Anno's best performances ever. He's really genuinely menacing here, and he should be: he's taking the perspective of a demented serial killer. This song must have influenced many thrash and later even death metal acts out there due to its subject matter, heaviness, speed, and aggressiveness. An absolute masterpiece, no doubt about it. Hell, if this was the only good song on the album it'd be worth buying for this song alone. But it isn't - in fact, every other song up to this point has been either good or great too. Can you say the same for Number Of The Beast or Powerslave? I think not.\n\nAfter this work of brilliance, however, is when things, to some extent at least briefly go downhill with the weird and not all that metal \"Prodigal Son\". It's supremely atmospheric, I'll give it that...a lot like Strange World from the first album. But that song was the weakest song on the debut in my eyes along with Sanctuary, and the debut was so amazingly filled with such an atmosphere on every single one of its songs that one completely unheavy song didn't matter - everything else was so good that I didn't care. Here, though, Maiden try something more along the lines of a power ballad like Remember Tomorrow, except unlike that fantastic song, this isn't a typical power ballad at all. It's dominated by acoustic guitars which are interspersed with heavy distorted riffs every now and then, and has several sections where the guitars are completely clean, most notably the first verse. It picks up a little later, but it's just so...well, weird, for Maiden at least. It just doesn't sound very much like anything they'd done before, or would try again for that matter, and that makes me think it was the product of an idea they had: they wanted to try something different, and in that respect they certainly succeeded. But did they execute it well? I'm not sure...and that's part of the problem with this song. I don't hold anything against it per se, and there are some good moments on it, but I don't really care for it all that much either, and the preceding seven songs were all far better.\n\nAnyway, moving on, we then have \"Purgatory\", the only original single from the album, which unlike a lot of future Maiden singles(which, despite their commercial status, are often beloved by almost all Maiden fans for some reason, who seem to be incapable of seeing their often fundamental flaws and lack of much real metalness)is actually a pretty good song. Its use of melody is neither cheesy nor overdone, and creates that same intensely powerful atmosphere, very urban and gritty and harsh(and not clean at all), that made early Maiden so great. The lyrics are(as far as I can tell, don't quote me on this one)something about a ghost, and all of his memories, and also something about love, although I'm not sure what the exact meaning of the song is. Nice, and I mean that seriously, because here it really works. It's dark, quite cold almost, and even the clean melodic riffs don't ruin the song - in fact, they help it as they make the atmosphere even more potent.\n\n\"Twilight Zone\", the bonus track which became the album's other single later, is another very well done song with no real problems. I'm not sure what it's about exactly but again it's very potent and real, completely down to earth, and quite similar to Purgatory in a lot of ways, but there's nothing wrong with that.\n\nFinally, we get \"Drifter\", which unfortunately is the only song on here that, like Prodigal Son, never really clicked with me. It's about a cowboy going from place to place and singing to help people's spirits, or something along those lines, and while it works as a closing song, it just isn't all that interesting. There are hardly any really memorable riffs here, and it's quite predictable and repetitive. It's a bit of a shame as almost every other song on here is either good, great, or fantastic, but considering that's true I suppose it doesn't matter all that much. Still, I would have liked the last song on the album to be a good one at least.\n\nSo there we have it, a highly underrated album that is still quite definitely a piece of metal history. While not as important or as revolutionary as the debut, as most of the greatness on here comes from taking the same excellent formula that worked brilliantly there and doing it again, it's still a great metal record to say the least, and the number of consistently good songs on here that work without being either too commercial or remotely cheesy is amazing. I'm still trying to understand why Maiden couldn't have written their later brilliant epics without becoming cheesy, pretentious, and far more commercial - they succeeded at creating a fantastically potent atmosphere here just as they did with the debut, and that album had Phantom Of The Opera, an epic song that was astounding and not at all commercial, pretentious, or corny. This album doesn't have any epics of that kind, but nevertheless the material here is of overall extremely high quality and the album has only two weaker songs. Out of 11 songs, I'd call that a bargain.\n\nTo sum up, another absolutely essential Maiden classic. If you want overdone cheesy epics with absurdly over the top singing and weak guitars, this isn't for you. If you want songs about slaying dragons, Egyptian Pharaohs and dogfights, this isn't for you. If you want lame hard rock posing as metal with obscenely dumb lyrics this certainly isn't for you. But if you want real heavy fucking metal with powerful lyrics, real grit, a superb urban atmosphere, genuine heaviness(as opposed to pussy hard rock 'heaviness')and NO FUCKING PRETENTIOUSNESS, then this is a definite must have.\n",
        "\nThe one thing that always sticks out for me about this album is the way it is generally regarded by most Maiden fans and also metal fans in general: It's a decent start for one of the world's greatest and most influential heavy metal bands, but lacking something in comparison to their later 80's works.\n\nUm, what?\n\nIt's a ridiculous attitude that unfortunately has been passed down by generation upon generation of Maiden fans, which is mostly related to one thing: Bruce Dickinson doesn't sing on the debut or Killers. And according to these people, due to the lack of Dickinson both albums are inferior to Number Of The Beast and everything after that up until Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son. Which is a disgraceful, insulting, and idiotic manner of thinking that shows very little respect for what Iron Maiden really are. People who think this way are forgetting that while The Number Of The Beast was indeed Maiden's breakthrough album, without the first two albums the band would never have achieved the popularity they needed in order to truly \"push ahead\", as it were, with NOTB. They complain about Paul Di'Anno's singing, saying it pales in comparison to Bruce's operatic vocals, and often label it \"too punky\". Newsflash: Maiden's early stuff WAS actually influenced by punk, even though was hardly just punk rock - it was something special, different, unique; something that changed the heavy metal scene as we knew it forever, and led to thrash and thus by extension death and black metal too, and of course speed and power metal(it is true that Maiden's later 80's records admittedly did have more of an influence on those scenes). So when people criticise those records for their sound they should keep in mind just how influential the debut and Killers were, and that Paul's voice and style of singing, no matter how much less \"operatic\" and \"soaring\" than Bruce's, was also perfectly suited to the way Iron Maiden and Killers sound. Which is also something very interesting and at the time unique: the amalgamation of heavy metal with punk, plus some rock influences, and a very gritty, harsh, dirty, and raw sound that is very unlike Maiden would ever sound again. Even Killers, despite being perhaps more punk influenced than the debut, was definitely lacking something in the rawness department.\n\nLong rant aside, it's that same rawness, grittiness, and realistic, urban kind of lyrical darkness and seediness that draws me back to this album time and time again. It's what makes it special and one of its greatest strengths. That's not to say that it has no weaknesses at all, though; while I am frequently disgusted by the lack of respect for Maiden's first two records in comparison to the five that followed(I'm looking especially hard at you, Powerslave, and at you, Number Of The Beast), I won't deny that Maiden were indeed less experienced songwriters at this point, and that a few moments of astounding compositional genius aside, are also far less progressive than they would become. Again, however, that's another part of the album's appeal: it's not only raw, dirty, and gritty - just like its subject matter, which deals mostly with the kind of shit that goes on in the decrepit alleys and deserted, rundown, slummy areas of London and other major cities(reflected brilliantly in the simple but awesome cover, which creates an incredible atmosphere all by itself), but also filled with youthful energy and vitality, a desire to go out there and do something special, and a completely unpretentious nature that only makes me respect it even more. One thing I absolutely despise is pretension, and in the case of musicians, it's people who are usually inferior to others trying to prove they are better than they really are, and showing themselves up as arrogant, self-righteous and utterly fake and pathetic assholes in the process. And one of the most amazing things about Iron Maiden's debut is that even its most progressive songs(Phantom Of The Opera and Remember Tomorrow)never seem remotely pretentious, even for a second. They are utterly genuine, not to mention extremely well written and fantastic anyway.\n\nThat elusive, often dark and frequently seedy and decrepit atmosphere created by the music which is completely fitting to both the artwork and the lyrics is one of my favourite aspects to this album, and again, it only completely rings true here. Killers still had it but was a little too cleanly produced to give that truly gritty feel(which is also characteristic of a lot of early NWOBHM, I admit, although I still think Maiden did it best). Number Of The Beast had it in places but that album was more of a stepping stone between this one and Killers and everything that came afterwards. I love albums that evoke not only a lot of feeling but also a great sense of time, location, and mood, and this is one of the best pre-thrash records I've heard that gives off a truly harsh urban feel. Sure it's upbeat a lot of the time, but it also has plenty of slower moments. The band shines equally in both, the best examples of the former being Prowler, Running Free and the title track, the best examples of the latter being Remember Tomorrow and Strange World(and to some degree Transylvania), and Phantom Of The Opera and Charlotte The Harlot showing the band's ability to combine speed and aggression with mood and feeling equally brilliantly.\n\nWhoa...I just mentioned every song on the album there! Well, that just goes to show how great this album truly is: it has only one real weak point, that being the bonus song \"Sanctuary\" which, not coincidentally, is the only song on the debut I didn't mention in the previous paragraph, for a good reason. While not a bad song in and out of itself it's extremely forgettable in comparison to all of the other songs, which is not a good thing for any Iron Maiden song. One of Maiden's greatest strengths(and another reason why they are so popular, in a good way)is their ability to write songs that are not only catchy but also very memorable. \"Sanctuary\" isn't either, unfortunately.\n\nAnother thing worth mentioning here, which I also touched upon earlier, is Paul Di'Anno's vocals, and how this ties in with the album's completely down to earth and unpretentious nature. He really adds to the already intense and amazing atmosphere created by the instruments, lyrics, and cover art, because his voice is so fitting to what he is singing about that it's almost uncanny. As good as Bruce is, I cannot imagine these songs ever having such a powerful atmosphere without Di'Anno. The grittiness of his voice prevents any descents into the over the top and corny territory that some of Maiden's later 80's stuff would sadly be plagued with, which unfortunately also led to power metal often sounding really corny, dumb, and yet again fucking pretentious because they took what Bruce did literally and expanded it to even more cartoonish extremes. Sorry, but for my money there is only one man in the world who absolutely never sounds pretentious no matter what he sings about or how over the top he goes. That man is the metal god, Rob Halford of Judas Priest. Iron Maiden never had a singer who quite reached his calibre and nor did any power metal band. Bruce, for all of his own excellence in that more operatic style of singing(which was also a big influence on power metal), wasn't capable of always sounding unpretentious and completely genuine. Di'Anno was, and the Maiden records he sung on also didn't really possess any of those \"qualities\"(yes, I do mean that in a mostly negative sense)to begin with, and thus none of that crap was ever an issue prior to Number Of The Beast.\n\nBut I digress. This is a fucking masterpiece of an album, the beginning of one of the best heavy metal bands ever, and incredibly influential in ways that are still being felt even today. Judas Priest's late 70's records(and a lot of their 80's stuff, too, but especially their 70's stuff)are often said to have hugely influenced speed metal, particularly Stained Class, and equally, I would say Iron Maiden's debut influenced thrash due to its tempos and punk influence. Thrash, as anyone with a decent understanding and knowledge of music knows, was created by combining the heaviness of metal with the speed and aggression of the hardcore punk scene. But I would say that the genre's pioneers(Exodus, Slayer, Metallica, etc)were also influenced by what Iron Maiden did, which was combining heavy metal with some elements of punk rock. Judas Priest's British Steel is often considered to be one of the defining albums of heavy metal as a whole, and part of its legacy is that it stripped down the blues influences of metal and focused more on pure heaviness. Iron Maiden's debut, while perhaps not so obviously sounding as much like one would imagine pure heavy metal to sound like as either the aforementioned Priest record or their own monumental third album two years later, was undoubtedly just as influential as British Steel in its own way; it also stripped down the blues element of metal to almost nothing, but by adding the tempos and some of the sound of punk rock to heavy guitar riffing and finishing it all off beautifully with fantastic songwriting and exuberant energy, it has rightfully earned its place as one of the most important albums in the entire history of the genre. And yet it is still underrated in comparison to Number Of The Beast, even though it was first and thus probably more, not less influential, simply because the majority of fans consider its songs to be of lower quality, the guitar tone doesn't sound quite as heavy, and Paul sings on it instead of Bruce.\n\nAnd things like this are the reason why I rarely pay that much attention to how well an album is regarded by the metal mainstream. Iron Maiden's debut album is one of the cornerstones of heavy fucking metal, and nothing less than that. For any and every metalhead, owning this album is absolutely mandatory, both as a piece of metal history and as a fucking awesome masterwork of heavy music. Nothing less than essential.\n",
        "\nA year prior, Paul Di'anno had become a footnote in the annals of one of heavy metal's legendary bands. But who was this new guy? Oh sure, he fronted obscure NWOBHM beefcakes Samson, but would he stand and deliver for the rapidly escalating Iron Maiden?\n\nOver the past 27 years, it's safe to say this question has been answered. Bruce Dickinson came, saw and conquered, as early as his full-length debut with Maiden upon which he already has the chops of a seasoned veteran. The rest of the album wasn't too shabby either, as an increased quality of melody and songcraft permeates The Number of the Beast. The s/t debut and certainly Killers had their fair share of memorable tunes, but this is just about perfect, with the possible exception of \"Invaders\", a somewhat dull track that unfortunately opens the album.\n\nSo we'll skip that and move along to the solid steel bliss that is the remainder of this timeless exercise in 'eavy metal. \"Children of the Damned\" is nigh invincible, proof Dickinson was comfortable over more than triplets and power chords. A flowing, catchy acoustic track which lapses perfectly into a gleaming chorus, with a dual lead rocking bridge. \"The Prisoner\" makes great use of a sample from its namesake espionage TV show, and then Clive Burr kicks up a storm of rockin' beats, while the song also features some great Harris grooves and licks. \n\nFollowing this we get the pseudo-sequel to \"Charlotte the Harlot\", that being \"22 Acacia Avenue\" with its montage of shifting beats and groove beneath some of Dickinson's most venomous lines on the album. Next up is the title track, one of Maiden's most infamous compositions and in all likelihood the best on this particular album. As much as we'd all like this to be about the devil (including cover artist Derek Riggs), it supposedly isn't. I like to think it's based on the Heinlein novel of the same name (certainly a source Maiden has used for inspiration elsewhere), but aside from the name, it's really not. \"Run to the Hills\", yet another of their live staples, follows with its elegy to the American Indian. It's rarely left their set in close to three decades. \"Gangland\" is a balls out rocker comparable to the style you'd hear in other early NWOBHM like Motorhead and Saxon, though hammered with those classic melodies only Maiden was adept at. \"Hallowed by Thy Name\" is the epic closure to the original album, a lengthy and moodier piece which foreshadowed others to come.\n\nWhat more to be said for an album which is worshiped by millions of human beings, many of whom consider it their very best. I dare to disagree with such a sentiment, as I found \"Invaders\" a bit weak and the album not nearly as catchy as the next three. The Number of the Beast is surely the beginning of the band's strongest stretch of material (ending with Somewhere in Time), and nearly every track is an outright classic. With evocative and meaningful lyrics and subject matter, class act riffing and overall amazing musicianship for 1982, they were now the band to beat. Oh, sure, it'd happen in a year or so...but there simply were no other bands of this period as well rounded as Maiden when it came to creating interesting metal music which has survived in the minds of so many until this very day...\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nIRON MAIDEN are an enigma to me. While I both understand and respect the incessant lauding the band has received since their initial inception (or for some, after \"Number of the Beast\" was released), for all their flair and elegance their music has always been quite middle of the road and bland to me. The music seems easily enjoyable, energetic, and able to generate plentiful fist pumps...for the first few songs. But once you get halfway through and are treated to more of the same it's like feasting on a supper of saltines and water; sure, it's filling, but leaves leaves the palette uninterested and blah. I gave this band more than a fair share of honest tries, unfortunately to the same conclusion time and again, so I figured it would suit us both well if I were to just leave them to their dedicated fanbase and for me to fuck off into that goodnight. That was, until a high school chum made me listen to this, stating its importance and all-out awesomeness within both the MAIDEN and metal world, hoping to change my perspective\n\nNope. Didn't happen.\n\nI'm not saying IRON MAIDEN is a bad band, far from it; they're very capable and professional musicians who know their craft and do it well. It's just that my tastes have been tempered since day one with more extreme and relatively differing acts to the point where ensconcing of the NWOBHMy kind just doesn't cut the mustard. As with JUDAS PRIEST and MANOWAR I'm not really thrown by the more simplistic and humbly necessary old-timers in this day and age, and \"Brave New World\" doesn't help matters.\n\nThis album screams \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\", obviously remembering the days of yore and catering to it in absolute spades. However, this time around the energy and interestingness is watered down, coming off more as \"MAIDEN by numbers\" as opposed to the Seventh Son of A Real Live Beast that plugged along for years. In my eyes this isn't quite the rebirth of the MAIDEN that many people have made it out to be. When it comes to the performance, however, the listener gets a column A-column B dilemna...Steve Harris is still a master of the four stringer, plinking along to his heart's content as the rest of the band follows suit in varying degrees; from the good end of the human metronone-style drumwork of Mr. McBrain to Bruce Dickinsen's air-raid siren wails still having the punch and power they once had, to the bad end of overly-rhythmic, phoned-in guitar riffing and the same lack of original ideas that's plagued the band. When the band is on, they're on, as evidenced by the stronger \"The Fallen Angel\" and \"Dream of Mirrors\", but they also fall flat on their faces with clunkers like \"The Wicker Man\" and \"Out of the Silent Planet\"...essentially it starts strong (outside of \"Wicker Man\") and slowly fades into oblivion by the album's conclusion.\n\nSo all in all this didn't quite live up to its original expectations for me, nor did it really change my mind about the IRON MAIDEN world. Unfortunate, I'll admit...but to each his/her own, and this still slated the hunger of all MAIDENites the world over. Sorry guys, I tried.\n",
        "\nFrom the release of The Number of the Beast in 1982 to the career defining masterpiece Somewhere in Time four years later, Iron Maiden could simply not be stopped. The four studio albums of this period and the excellent Live After Death represent one of the strongest, if not THE strongest runs ever from a metal band, and Powerslave fits into this with a grandeur of lyrical legerdemain and unforgettable songcraft. Who could forget the iconic Derek Riggs artwork gracing this cover? As timeless as its source.\n\nLike any proper Maiden album, this one is best defined by its unerring melodies, powerful vocal performance and lyrical adherence to history, mythology and fiction. Half of the tracks here can be counted among their hits, staples of many a setlist across the past few decades. \"Aces High\" is one such staple, an energetic and fist banging tribute to the aerial dogfight. \"2 Minutes to Midnight\", yet another classic burns with a pure NWOBHM fire: bluesy riffing which can break out the spikes and leather in all of us. The vocals in the bridge and chorus are immortal. \"Losfer Words (Big 'Orra)\" is an instrumental pun with some excellent winding guitar leads over Steve Harris' extravagant bass, while one of the lesser known tunes from this disc it's actually got some of the best riffing in all Maiden. \"Flash of the Blade\" is another killer which stems from Dickinson's love of fencing, a celebration of swordplay throughout the ages. \"The Duellists\" takes this theme a little further with a toss of the gauntlet, and an anthemic chorus line which I number among their all time classics. \"Back in the Village\" is a nice post-war anthem with a catchy, noodling guitar lead in the chorus.\n\nAs memorable as all of these songs are, we haven't yet arrived at the 'epic' portion of the album, comprised of its final two tracks (at least on the original release). \"Powerslave\" is unbelievably awesome, Dickinson's vocals taunt and beckon the listener back to this mystical empire of old. No offense to Nile or any other band which thoroughly explores Ancient Egypt thematically (and more accurately), but this remains the most effective Egyptian themed metal song ever to this day, despite having only a few riffs which directly mirror the cultural vibe. It's all in the delivery.\n\nFuck!!! This was 1984 people, do you know the effect this stuff had on a young and deviant mind addled and fueled by Dungeons & Dragons and science fiction novels? It's not over yet, because Maiden pays a special tribute to Samuel Taylor Coleridge with the 13+ minute epic \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\", with its memorable and creepy mid section slathered in bass, samples and ringing guitar ambience, one of the most brilliant passages ever committed to tape by this band.\n\nThough the album has been remastered, the original mix still sounds fantastic. Some decent bonus tracks have been added with the 1995 version, in particular \"King of Twilight\" is worthy of being here. The musicianship is all-around excellent, from Nico's well balanced drumming to the Harris bass wizardry, dual guitar melodies and Dickinson's masterful delivery. Compare this to almost any album of its year...with the exception of maybe Ride the Lightning it was unsurpassed, from both a technical and nostalgic standpoint. It goes without saying that this belongs in any true metal fan's collection, but in the rare case some reader has been living under a rock or kidnapped by merfolk all these years...actually, fuck it. Even the merfolk listen to Iron Maiden. So you have no excuse.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nLess than a year after the debut, Harris and the band struck gold with Killers, an album that\u2019s packed with magically delicious heavy metal. The vibe is cooler, the atmosphere chill, and the tone of everything from Di\u2019Anno\u2019s voice to the tick of the cymbal sounds superbly crisp and rich. Compared to Dickinson, yes, Di\u2019Anno doesn\u2019t have a huge range, but he\u2019s much more focused this time around to smash expectations gambled off the first album. His voice evokes attitude, control, and (thanks to proper mixing) melody next to the harmonious lead by Smith and Murray. On that midway conclusion, the guitar duo\u2019s sound has improved much over the months, as well. Going from sloppy to honed in. Smith and Murray show great friendship as they kick off one another in nailing twin leads. The tone is grainy and warm, integrating well with the comfortable, jazzy atmosphere brought about by Di\u2019Anno\u2019s soulful voice.\n\nWell, the showmanship aspect of the band improved tremendously, and the album would be the best one put out this far. Di'Anno got settled in, which may explain his spectacular performance on this album. He sounds not only like a capable singer but also very confident. Over the following months, he began sucking Iron Maiden into his own void and acting as the driving force while Harris still held the title as founder and creative controller of the band. He drove the band over the edge a couple of times with his pretentious attitude and over-the-top character, but damn does he at least sound good.\n\nBlasting off with \u201cKillers,\u201d Harris\u2019 signature, bobbing bass tone is instantly recognizable as it bounces in the grooviest fashion. Alongside the gritty guitars, the tone feels much warmer and heavier than before, with a stylish persona to go with it. Sometimes the bass rides the rhythm with the guitars, but a lot of times it\u2019ll find itself on its own carrying the rhythm while the guitars cocked back before launching themselves forward in a chaotic whirl of merciless harmonies. \u201cInnocent Exile\u201d hits the spot with this as Harris twirls his basslines before letting Smith and Murray capitalize on the scene, mesmerizing the listener with spot-on precision and heavy-hitting riffs. Killers is more of a fun album that hopes to make the listener relaxed and along for the ride.\n\nBurr in the back really has his drumming tight as bubble wrap. The hats have a clingy sound to them, but the rest of the kit hammers along nicely. I especially love how the double bass really has this galloping sound, like a horse charging toward you at record speed. The tom and cymbal crash combination is sometimes overwhelming, like so much force is hitting you. \u201cProdigal Son\u201d is the real slow, ballad-type song on the album that works with these crashes, but then you have the rest of the album where Burr gets out his pit-pat-pit-pat speedy drumming, keeping up well on the sidelines next to his lead counterparts. The mixing on the album is very touchy, with extra caution not to bury the vocals or accentuate the guitars like on the debut. \u201cGenghis Khan\u201d abruptly ended during the riff that Papa Roach ripped off so the band could wind down. The lines were finally crossed, the stakes were set, and the dawn of a new Maiden was upon us.\n\nAll told, it's an improvement over the debut and worth getting if you're either starting out or want extra Maiden.\n",
        "\nYeeees!! Our dreams have finally come true. Bruce Dickinson, the ultimate metal singer has returned back where he belongs. Okay, he has done very well in his solo career but this band is his home. Steve Harris realized, at last, that the experiment with Bailey wasn\u2019t getting anywhere and that they were running out of time. So he sent him back to the nothingness from where he came. Now the Iron Maiden strikes back! Forget the Priest-Halford fairytale. This IS the ultimate reunion! And even more as now Maiden have three, (yes three!) guitarists. Adrian Smith has also joined them once again to give them fresh ideas. Hell yeah!\n\nThey knew there wouldn\u2019t be another chance. Their reunion album would either bring them to the throne of heavy metal or it would sign their death sentence. So, they charged full ahead and they won. Brave New World brings Seventh Son\u2026 ten years closer, being a natural development in the band\u2019s glorious history. It is almost flawless, proud, inspired and it widely unfolds all the elements that created the legend of Iron Maiden.\n\nSo, what is there in this album? Ten songs that will rock your ass off! Filled with great guitars, superb bass, pounding drums and majestic vocals, the songs vary from good to perfect. From the first hearing you realize that the compositions are made exactly to fit Bruce\u2019s vocals. He is in such a great form, just like the old days. The opener track, The Wicker Man is a classic Maiden piece. Explosive and rhythmic, it features heavy riffs, imposing vocals and McBrain\u2019s dynamic double-boots playing on the drums. The album\u2019s first single and what a way to start off! Then follows Ghost of The Navigator, with a beautiful melodic intro, multiple breaks, inspired lyrics and an astonishing performance by Bruce that reminds us of the Powerslave era. Simply brilliant.\n\nThe self-titled song is of mid-tempo mostly but there are quite a few changes in the rhythm that make it very interesting. And it has a very nice chorus that sticks to your mind. And behold, Blood Brothers, with violin (!!) melodies and Bruce\u2019s epic way of singing, creates an atmosphere not to familiar of Iron Maiden. Yet again, it\u2019s another surprise by the band. After all, why should they be so monotonous every time? Yeah, right, you\u2019d wish! The Mercenary is the next in line and the aggressive, sharp guitars are here to get us in motion. The old chaps haven\u2019t forgotten how to rock.\n\nDream of Mirrors is truly a dreamy song. Nine minutes of unrepeatable melodies, sudden breaks, an amazing Dickinson and a feeling of paranoia is floating in the air. Definitely, it is one of the best moments of the album. I wonder where Maiden and Bruce would be if they hadn\u2019t found each other. A volley of guitars and drums blow us away on the demonic The Fallen Angel. It\u2019s a heavy metal blaster with three great solos from the fantastic trio, Murray/Smith/Gers. And here comes the absolute masterpiece, a rough cut diamond titled The Nomad. Maiden feed our hunger for greatness with another nine minute oriental storm, with breaks, solos and an imposing atmosphere. Divinity is the only word that comes to my mind for this one.\n\nThe remaining two songs are nice and catchy, though some of you may find them a bit mediocre. Mostly I\u2019m referring to The Thin Line Between Love and Hate that might confuse you since it is a bit out of place. On the other hand, Out of the Silent Planet starts kind of slow but turns into well played heavy metal. They are just a step below the rest of the album.\n\nBrave New World sounds like a traditional Maiden album and it consists, as a total, of the best composing ideas they have had for ten years. Let\u2019s be honest, it cannot replace the \u201choly trinity\u201d (The Number\u2026 Powerslave\u2026 Piece of Mind) but it stands proudly along their side. I have no doubt that their faithful fans were delirious, those who questioned their abilities were forced to rethink and their few enemies just kept singing the same old song. Let them fuck of and die while you dive in the ocean of Maiden\u2019s majesty. Their banner waves high again!\n",
        "\nIf there is one band I would die for, that would be Iron Maiden. If I had to choose the ultimate line-up for a band, that would be Iron Maiden. My love for them is endless. I find great pleasure and delight in listening to all their albums. Well, anyway, almost all of them. Dickinson\u2019s departure did a big damage to the band. Blaze Bailey\u2019s debut, The X-Factor was partly good, partly horrible. I looked forward to their next step, hoping that this time they wouldn\u2019t let me down. A decade later, I\u2019m still confused.\n\nDespite any similarities to The X-Factor, Maiden move one step further, by making numerous flashbacks to earlier albums, particularly Seventh Son\u2026 The album, titled Virtual XI, generally moves in mid-tempo rhythms with plenty breaks. There are some epic traces but also a touch of 70\u2019s progressive rock, surprisingly. The production is very good and the cover is quite strange, though a lot better than the previous one.\n\nThe first thing I have to comment on would be Bailey\u2019s vocals. He has established his own style of singing and he does not try to imitate the one and only Bruce Dickinson. Not that he would have been able of, anyway. Still, I must admit that he does much better this time. Those who liked him before will like him in this one too. Those who didn\u2019t might change their mind. He sings with passion and strength and he is probably the album\u2019s big surprise. On The X-Factor it seemed as if Maiden were trying to adjust the songs to his vocals to get the best result. Now they work all together and most of the times it pays off.\n\nAnother thing that lifts the quality of the album is the guitar work of Murray and Gers. The riffs are improved and the solos do exist, in contrast to their absence on the X-Factor. Of course there isn\u2019t much to say about the bass. Steve Harris is as always on the front line, giving his best.\n\nThe opener, Futureal, which is also the first single, is aimed to be the album\u2019s \u201chit\u201d. It\u2019s got everything it needs. It is short, less than three minutes and fast with sharp guitars. It\u2019s quite catchy but it is not the best song. Well, not even the second best. This place rightfully goes to Lightning Strikes Twice. An excellent song that begins with a slow intro \u2018till the moment Murray and Gers start causing electric shock waves that hit you like lightning. At last, we get the Maiden double solos that we love so much.\n\nWith the first notes of The Clansman, you understand that Maiden are making a journey back in time, to the Seventh Son\u2026 album. The Clansman is a nine-minute epic that follows the spirit of The Sign of the Cross and in my opinion is much better. The lyrics refer to Scotland\u2019s will for independence from the United Kingdom. Pretty inspired I can say. After A typical slow passage half-way, it speeds up again before its slow ending. Blaze Bailey performance is fantastic.\n\nWhen Two Worlds Collide is another fine track based upon the same structure. The once again slow intro gives its place to fast guitar themes. Though, at a point it repeats some lines, maybe more than it should, it is considered as a good moment in the album. The Angel and the Gambler is a song very unusual for Iron Maiden. It is also very long, approximately ten minutes and here the band experiments with many keyboards that, to me, don\u2019t fit in. It is not as awful as many believe but it could have been shorter, thus less mediocre.\n\nA song that is quite different from the rest is Como Estais Amigos which is basically a kind of ballad, heavy at times but no match for the divine Wasting Love. The remaining song, The Educated Fool and Don\u2019t Look to the Eyes of a Stranger can only be appreciated if you think of them as a joke! They are totally shity and horrible and the great flaws of Virtual XI. Completely unworthy of Maiden, I pretend they don\u2019t exist every time I listen to the album.\n\nIt would be very easy and convenient for me to praise Iron Maiden and claim that Virtual XI is fantastic, glorious etc. but I will not. If four great songs in a total of eight in a Maiden\u2019s release are enough for you, then fine. Otherwise\u2026\n",
        "\nI never understood the musical course that Maiden took after Seventh Son. Although Seventh Son was a huge success in Europe and elsewhere, they lost fans or fan\u2019s interest in the U.S. The raw and simplistic attack of No Prayer for the Dying appeared to be a reaction to the highly progressive and produced heavy metal created on Seventh Son. No Prayer in my opinion is the worst release in the Dickenson era. Fear of the Dark was stuck somewhere in the middle of those albums with moments of greatness, average-ness and awfulness. \n\nThe production is a ten fold improvement over the sparseness of No Prayer. It is a successful merging of the gloss of Seventh Son with the more live feeling of No Prayer. Rather than the sloppy feel to No Prayer, the production here is crisper, without seeming fake or polished. The performances themselves are not questioned even over some of the more banal material. The solos from Mr. Murray and even Mr. Gers are always a highlight. \n\nThe Great. The opener Be Quick or Be Dead is fast, catchy and short, a perfect opener. Although you can tell Bruce\u2019s vocals are straining a bit on most of this album, it works perfectly on this aggressive song. Afraid to Shoot Strangers is a great epic that builds from a slow ballad to a great melody to an aggressive middle section then back to a more mid paced ending. Childhood\u2019s End, a totally underrated song that builds on a cool staccato type chorus and memorable melody line. It is a very dark song both musically and lyrically. Finally the classic Fear of The Dark. What more can be said of this song that is still played frequently on live tours. The second chorus that introduces the galloping vibe is undeniable. These four songs are better than anything on No Prayer and hold up very well against most Maiden classics. \n\nThe Average. Fear is the Key, an ok song with social lyrics that fit the time Maiden was trying to live in. The song is too long and the sped up part towards the end seems awkward. It was an attempt at something different which I appreciate. The Fugitive has a great heavy beginning and catchy first verse. The chorus is a bit bland which brings things down a notch. The Apparition is half successful and kind of presages the type of riffing that was used to great success on the X Factor album. It\u2019s not great, but not overly long and different to the entire album. Finally Judas Be My Guide is a simple and catchy song that I enjoy quite a bit, although not typical Maiden fare.\n\nThe Ugly. From Here to Eternity is probably the worst Maiden song ever released on a full length. It\u2019s a bland dumb and unconvincing rock and roll song that has no place in their catalog, let alone as a single. Wasting Love actually vacillates between this group and the average group depending on my mood. Since the main melody line and chorus is a little weak and the song is way too long and repetitive, it\u2019s inclusion here. Chains of Misery and Weekend Warrior are just bland, watered down rock songs. Unlike \u2026Here to Eternity, Maiden didn\u2019t try to convince fans these were any good, by playing them live. I do have to admit the pre chorus guitar line in Chains of Misery is pretty cool though, that however is about 12 seconds in the entire song. \n\nOne will never know what impact the impending (and probably well known) departure of Mr. Dickenson had on the song writing during this period. The ability to write great songs was still there but most of the song writing was way too average or boring. The band seemed split on whether it should embrace the progression displayed on Seventh Son, or the simplistic form of No Prayer. It took a change in singers and subsequent reunion to fully rekindle those progressive tendencies. However, the change in singers and the dark and epic follow up in The X Factor signaled a direction I was more favorable towards.\n",
        "\nHere comes the Maiden Machine, rolling through the parade with its flags raised high. A new Iron Maiden album is always a cause for celebration, even though their works up until this point since the 80s had been a bit inconsistent and middling in quality, not always hitting the highs we had expected from them before. But still, it was Maiden! One of the most dependable and solid metal bands ever, one of the epochal bands that just about everyone can name a song or two they like from. It didn't matter that the newest albums like Brave New World and Dance of Death had a bit of dragging filler, because the general mood was still a triumphant one that we associated with Iron Maiden at their best. And they have continued this fiery momentum with the newest, entitled A Matter of Life and Death.\n\nSo, why is this album so good? Because it takes the classic Maiden sound and boldly steps into new territories, and it does it well. The other two before this one were experimental, but they were experimental in small doses, and they didn't really take an entire album in one focused direction. This album does that, with a whole album full of Iron Maiden at their most mature and gripping, with all the grandeur of the 80s Maiden not attempted to be shamelessly replicated, but rather just done up in the more modern and restrained style that this album pushes forward. There is a subtle prog notion at work here, but the focus is mostly just on huge, rolling soundscapes of riffs and melodies that can sound foreboding or uplifting or even warlike on some tracks, like the commanding and powerful \"The Longest Day.\" THAT'S what this album is good for. I can lose myself in the huge, massive sound of this album. It is completely encompassing, and yet it still sounds like a Maiden album 100%. Here we see a classic band taking on a new sound that is actually challenging and more complex than the older material. That isn't something that happens often.\n\nSo let's recap: This is both classic Maiden and not classic Maiden. Confused yet? Good. The emotional quality of the work on here is just astoundingly high. Every band member plays to his full potential. Everything is huge and searing, soulful and poignant, like the soundtrack to some great epic movie or novel, if it was done in metallic form. Bruce Dickinson's voice soars above the clouds, meshing with the massive guitar harmonies and the thundering bass beautifully, and the drum sound is as heavy as a house. This really is just about the heaviest thing Maiden has ever done, and maybe also the most emotive and arresting, too. Just listen to \"Out of the Shadows\"; good god what a gorgeous song. That isn't usually a word I would use to describe Iron Maiden, but it fits here, as this song is a nicely flowing balladic number with a chorus so heartwarming that you'll never be down again listening to it. One of Maiden's all time best.\n\nGenerally I would say the songs on here are good for one of two reasons most of the time, if not both: they are either heavy and galloping and epic, or extremely emotional, as talked about above. I don't think Maiden have ever done a song quite as pugilistic and punishing as \"Brighter than a Thousand Suns,\" for example, with its crushing, soul-searing riff and monstrous chorus. \"Lord of Light,\" likewise, has an angry, borderline Thrashy riff that will break your windows, as well as perhaps the most uncharacteristic mood and tone of any Maiden song, including any of the Blaze-era ones, with its candlelit theatrics making a pretty good picture of the band getting ready for some kind of occult ritual. Not exactly Maidenesque, but the song rules. \"Different World\" and \"The Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg\" are perhaps the friendliest and most amiable of the songs here and they sound like classic Maiden, and in contrast, \"For the Greater Good of God\" could almost be on some kind of a film score with its pomposity and grandiose nature.\n\n\"The Pilgrim\" is one of the more atmospheric numbers here, with its wandering motif and emotional chords conjuring in my mind the image of a sun-drenched plateau of sand and rocks, traveled mercilessly by those searching for a new place to settle and live, and it's a grower, probably the most inaccessible song on here, oddly enough. I didn't like it so much the first few times I heard it. I already mentioned \"The Longest Day,\" but I'm mentioning it again, because it's the most well balanced on here; the best example of being both poignant and heavily epic and masterful. I'd say this is the best one on here, too, but that wouldn't be true; there are too many good songs on this album to choose just one. Whatever the case, \"The Longest Day\" is extremely captivating, with Bruce's wailing on the chorus combining with the somber and yet also triumphant guitar attack to create a real knockout of a song.\n\nThe nine minute \"The Legacy\" closes off the album with a narrative tale that sums up the album: this is the Maiden legacy, without a doubt. These guys are not slowing down, they are not pandering to burnt out husks who expect them to rerecord \"The Trooper\" and \"2 Minutes to Midnight,\" and they are doing exactly what they want to do. For a band this old and influential to still be knocking heads against trends and remaining (highly) relevant is very cool and hopeful. I have nothing to say to the people who don't think this album is good, so I'll end my review by saying that Iron Maiden are truly a landmark, truly inimitable. May they live long and produce more great music and enjoy themselves wholeheartedly. Up the Irons!\n",
        "\nI got this DVD yesterday, and watched it with my two and a half year old daugher. She proclaimed it \"rocking,\" and let me tell you, the little lady has TASTE! Not only is this an excellent glimpse into the lives of Iron Maiden on the road, it's also an entertaining travelogue, that offers a look at rock and roll through the lens of several \"non-European\" cultures. It's simply amazing to see the crowds of people thronging in the airports in Mumbai, Costa Rica, and other countries. It is clear from watching this film that Iron Maiden are far from being some heavy metal relic from the 80s, trying to relive their glory days. Far from it. This is a band who is still attracting hundreds of thousands of people all over the world.\n\nMusically, these guys are showing few signs of their age. The concert footage throughout the film shows a band at the top of their form. Bruce Dickinson wails as powerfully as he ever has, even in the mountains of Bogota, where the air is a bit thinner than he is used to. Nicko McBrain mercilessly flogs his drum kit, even when he almost breaks his wrist while playing a round of golf on one of his days off. The triple guitar attack of Adrian Smith, Janick Gers and Dave Murray is nothing short of awe inspiring: these guys trade solos back and forth, like some sort of intricate sporting event. And let us not forget the inimitable Steve Harris, who manages to play a great show in Australia, while still feeling the stomach-turning effects of a bug caught in India a few days before. I must also say, it's nothing short of inspirational to watch the reaction of the crowd in the concert scenes. The most emotional moment comes toward the end of the film, when a Latin American fan who has caught one of Nicko's drum sticks at the end of the show breaks down in tears, crosses himself and lifts his hands heavenward, absolutely enraptured by his concert experience. Beautiful...\n\nMeanwhile, the film shows us much entertaining and often hilarious behind-the-scenes footage of the band recovering from concerts, hanging out on Ed Force One (the plane which Bruce Dickinson pilots around the globe, carrying all the band, crew and equipment), meeting and greeting fans all over the world, and sometimes kicking back and relaxing. The interviews interspersed throughout the film manage to give a paint a fascinating picture of a group who has been doing this for a little while, and one comes away with the impression that these guys are devoted to their fans and the music, while maintaining quite a bit of humility and respect for each other. \n\nIf you are at all a fan of Iron Maiden, you need to see Flight 666; if you are a fan of rock music, you need to see Flight 666. Hang it all, if you're a person who enjoys seeing a bunch of people who are passionate about what they do, encountering people of all kinds of cultures, you need to see Flight 666! Go ahead, once you've read this review, go to Amazon or FYE or wherever you like to shop online, and get yourself a copy of this DVD! You will not be disappointed, I promise.\n",
        "\nWhen Iron Maiden\u2019s \u201cSomewhere Back In Time\u201d world tour was announced, I thought, \u201cThey oughta do a live DVD of this tour. It\u2019s going to be awesome having the current line-up playing all classic songs\u201d. Sure enough, a bit more than a year later, that DVD is made a reality, but it is not the main focus. The main attraction is a documentary of the tour called \u201cFlight 666\u201d, made by Sam Dunn and Scot McFayden of \u201cMetal: A Headbanger\u2019s Journey\u201d and \u201cGlobal Metal\u201d fame. Knowing how awesome those movies, and Maiden, are, Flight 666 isn\u2019t to be missed.\n\nThe premise of Flight 666, as I said before, is documenting the Somewhere Back In Time tour, which brought the band to 16 cities worldwide, playing 23 concerts in 45 days. This was made possible by their customized Boeing 757 jet, nicknamed \u201cEd Force One\u201d after their mascot Eddie, which carried the band, crew, and gear, as well as family and press. Singer Bruce Dickinson pilots the plane, which I find amazing because I would think that being in a band like Iron Maiden, and doing such a tour, would be stressful enough. But it sure didn`t seem like it, because they made it to every stop, with no threatening complications. Along the way, we see the band offstage/backstage, as well as taking part in recreational activities like tennis, golf, and football (soccer). It`s obviously funny to see lots of this stuff, because they`re all a bunch of characters. But every time the plane touches down, there is the typical pre-show fandemonium, then the show they`ve been waiting to see. \n\nThe concert disk is boasted to be \"the most spectacular live footage yet seen of Maiden\", and that sounds just about right. The stage is an almost complete recreation of the `84-`85 \"World Slavery Tour\", a most classic period of the band, with some imagery of the Somewhere In Time album. The setlist is comprised of one song from each of the 16 cities on the tour, all being pre-1990, when the band was at their best. Watching the HD footage in surround sound, just like the film, was super awesome. Not just that, but Maiden`s a renowned live band to begin with, so that is great in itself. The only problem I had with lots of the songs is that they aren`t very exact to their originals (different guitar solos, tempos), which I didn`t really like. I know that lots of bands do that, but I don`t really like it. Also, they show much of the concert footage throughout the film, so you know a lot of what's coming.\n\nThe only problem I had with the DVD itself is that it didn`t include any special features like deleted scenes, extended interviews, photo galleries, etc. The DVD calls the concert disk a \"bonus disk\", but I still would`ve enjoyed actual special features. But for what this DVD does have, it does very well, and I think that Flight 666 is essential for Maiden fans wanting to see the band as they are now: as awesome as ever.\n",
        "\nNow of the early Maiden albums this is by far the worst. It\u2019s sloppy, has a very amateurish sound, and has this unappealing attitude to my ears. I\u2019ll give them the praise of highly melodic solos that sometimes sound improvised (in a good way) and the riffs themselves are catchy, but the rest needs work. The members at the time no doubt knew what kind of music they wanted to play. Di\u2019Anno has a terrible range when compared to Dickinson; his singing is clear, raucous, and more personal than Dickinson\u2019s. You don\u2019t get the same kind of arena vocals that will soar over thousands upon thousands of fans crammed in a stadium. Upon first listen his voice sounded like crap when compared to Killers, but only as I kept coming back to this did I find that he just sounds unfocused and thus off key. His performance is in no way standout like it would be on the next album, which is a damn shame because the songs could use a leader to follow.\n\nThe first few tracks on this album really paint a grim picture. Maybe I\u2019m not in the right \u201cmindset\u201d or \u201cmood,\u201d but I felt no connection with these songs. I could feel the dark tendencies brooding in the air when hearing \u201cRemember Tomorrow,\u201d and when \u201cRunning Free\u201d galloped on through the mist I felt the jazzy vibe kick in. The chill factor went up and Di\u2019Anno\u2019s started to grasp his routine better than before. However, the moment was short-lived and the song pretty much ran it\u2019s course. It ended up going nowhere fast and left me with little to take back. Drumming is highly forgettable since all the attention is focused on the leads. They\u2019re aggressive and sound great since production surprisingly didn\u2019t hamper their vibration pitch, but as you can see they\u2019re the last things I noticed when it came to these songs.\n\nAgain I must compare this album to Killers, which is superior in every way. That album had a theme, personality, charm, focused vocals, and really just better riffs. The songs here, although inspiring, have no defining traits or class. The only songs I can say that go above these claims are the three that follow. With \u201cPhantom Of The Opera\u201d the songwriting is spot on with contagiously melodic leads, a captivating bridge, and that distinct Maiden progressiveness that wipes the floor in the blues, psychedelic, and doom departments. Thankfully it wasn\u2019t alone in this endeavor, for the succeeding instrumental \u201cTransylvania\u201d resurrected this persona and played around with it jovially. It definitely has a sloppy, albeit charismatic, sound.\n\nGuitars are pretty mixed here, with everything before \u201cPhantom Of The Opera\u201d sounding like insistent drivel with no standout style. I guess the first few songs just didn\u2019t utilize their potential all too well, which explains why they really suck hard. Murray and Stratton play lively with thrills and frills when required, dipping into an emotional side here and there. \u201cStrange World\u201d puts me in this spell when listening to it \u2013 I\u2019m entranced by the fat bass, which plays a huge role in Maiden songs as it always is heard alongside the guitars. It grumbles along in the grumpiest of moods ala Geezer Butler's grooves in Black Sabbath.\n\nThis is not an impressive start. \u201cPhantom Of The Opera,\u201d \u201cTransylvania,\u201d and \u201cStrange World\u201d are the only great songs off this. Iron Maiden is a pretty mediocre album with some hope attached. Killers will always be the superior of the Di\u2019Anno albums, but I can\u2019t really blame Maiden. They just came out of their gig days of the late 1970s and this is the kind of wild shit they were used to playing. Killers would aid in refining the best of it.\n",
        "\nIt is pretty safe to say that the Iron Maiden that released their debut in 1980 is quite different than the more famous version that would come in just a few short years. Fronted by the infamous Paul Di\u2019Anno, this Iron Maiden is more raw, angry, and hungry than the one that most listeners are familiar with. This album is particularly notable for being the only album to feature guitarist Dennis Stratton and producer Will Malone.\n\nMusically, this album\u2019s songs can all be grouped as being almost punky rockers, more progressive borderline epics, and even a few atmospheric ballad tracks. \"Prowler\" opens the album with some sleazy guitar playing and sleazier lyrics. \"Remember Tomorrow\" is a somber ballad that features a melodic vocal performance and some cool heavy/soft constrasts. \"Running Free\" is a bluesy mid-tempo tune with a bouncy rhythm section performance and fun vocals. \"The Phantom of the Opera\" finishes the first side off with some fast paced vocal/guitar trade-offs that soon go into a more melodic bridge that then leads into some excellently played twin guitar solos.\n\nThe instrumental \"Transylvania\" proceeds to open the album\u2019s second side with plenty of great guitar riffs. \"Strange World\" is another ballad in the vein of \"Remember Tomorrow\" with its somber vocals and spacy Pink Floydesque guitar pings. \"Charlotte the Harlot\" is another straightforward rocker with a gritty chorus and a melodic bridge. The title track closes the album out with catchy twin guitar wails and a strong (though somewhat repetitive) chorus. In short, every song is nicely done and there isn\u2019t a filler track to be heard. The 1998 remaster also includes \"Sanctuary,\" a catchy single with a bouncy main riff, a great sing-along chorus, and mock sirens during the solo section.\n\nThe band\u2019s performance is also pretty strong. Stratton and longtime member Dave Murray put out plenty of great riffs and solos, Steve Harris\u2019s bass is always audible and up to the IM standard, Clive Burr provides a solid foundation, and Di\u2019Anno makes up for his limited range with charisma and a gritty attitude. In fact, the latter member may be the only flaw in the line-up. He\u2019s a great singer but he may be an acquired taste for fans more used to the cleaner ways of Bruce Dickinson. . .\n\nIron Maiden would go on to do even greater things, but this is a most ambitious start.\n\nPros:\n1) Excellent guitars, great rhythm section, and charismatic vocals\n2) Great songwriting and variety\n3) Not a filler to be found\n\nCons:\n1) May be a little too punky for some fans\n2) Di\u2019Anno is an acquired taste\n\nMy Current Favorites:\n\"Prowler,\" \"Remember Tomorrow,\" \"Running Free,\" \"Phantom of the Opera,\" and \"Charlotte the Harlot\"\n",
        "\nThose after a headbanging fest of metal mania need look no further than this early single from Iron Maiden. Containing two of the band\u2019s greatest songs featuring the then-new vocalist Bruce Dickinson, it constitutes an eleven-minute heavy metal masterwork.\n\nThe main track of the single is among the best of the identically named album. From its unmistakable spoken intro to Bruce Dickinson\u2019s awe-inspiring scream, \u201cThe Number of the Beast\u201d screams classic Maiden. Several excellent riffs run throughout the song behind its pseudo-Satanic lyrics. A jaw-dropping solo section (the second-best of Maiden\u2019s career) further entices the listener, as does the following bass fill. Dickinson gives one of his career-defining vocal performances, while the rest of the band leaves absolutely nothing more to be desired.\n\nNext up is an absolutely amazing live rendition of the classic \u201cRemember Tomorrow.\u201d Dickinson takes Di\u2019Anno\u2019s vocal lines and completely makes them his own, carrying the ballad in a way the former singer couldn\u2019t even begin to emulate. His operatic delivery contributes a touch of grandeur to the song as well as making it even darker in style. This was back in 1981, while he was in his absolute prime, meaning his screams could still break the sound barrier. Just listen to that final shriek!\n\nThe rest of the band is excellent as ever. Whoever produced this did an excellent job; everything can be heard clearly without any one instrument overpowering another. Things are even more crystal clear than in studio, and that\u2019s something to brag about on a live number. In fact, the instrumentalists\u2019 performances actually beat out those on the studio version, the enhanced production doing wonders for the solos and riffs, not to mention the powerful bass guitar. Maiden abounds with all-around energy, making for what is probably the best version of this song available.\n\nThis single is absolutely essential for Maiden collectors. Derek Riggs\u2019s masterful cover art combined with the incredible music contained within makes for an engrossing experience among Maiden\u2019s all-time best. Under no circumstances should this be missed.\n",
        "\nIt was a beautiful summer day in August 2007 when a young Romanian, during one of the happiest periods of his life, walked into a music store in Qu\u00e9bec. His eye was caught by a sight in the previously unexplored (by him) Iron Maiden section. That sight was the cover of a relatively recent single, The Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg. Curiosity turned to surprise when he noticed that the epitaph written on Benjamin Breeg\u2019s tomb was, in fact, written in Romanian. He read it again once, then twice, in order to make sure that he wasn\u2019t delusional. No. There it was. Translated, it reads: Here lies a man about whom little is known. He knew he had to buy that single no matter what, and he did, despite not previously owning any of Iron Maiden\u2019s music. Thus, because of an epitaph on the cover of a single, began my fascination with the legendary heavy metal band. \n\nThe Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg consists of two tracks: the title track from the then-soon-to-be-released A Matter of Life and Death album and the Radio 1 Legends Session version of the band\u2019s classic epic, Hallowed Be Thy Name. The Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg is an excellent example of the new, highly epic style performed by Iron Maiden during these last few years and is representative of the AMOLAD album, being neither the longest nor the shortest track from it. It\u2019s quite a slow-paced track, starting off slowly with a very melodic intro and some soft-spoken verses from Bruce before picking up the pace after about 1 minute and 45 seconds with a series of good, instantly recognizable riffs which, despite the generous length of the song, never get boring. This is all the more amazing once one realises the high amount of repetition involved here, especially during the chorus, which, when coupled with the slow pace of the song, could easily drag on annoyingly for the entire seven minutes but in the end the whole thing comes off as being enjoyable. It\u2019s certainly not the best Iron Maiden track, not even the best from the album it\u2019s on, but it still is quite good. The end is a little abrupt though. \n\nThe B-side is a new take on the classic Hallowed Be Thy Name, and it\u2019s a surprisingly good version of the classic song from The Number of the Beast. It\u2019s just slightly drier than the original, both from an instrumental point of view and when listening to Bruce\u2019s vocal work. Oddly enough, the remake is also slightly faster than the original. None of these differences are significant though, with both the remake and the original songs being almost equally enjoyable. \n\nThe Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg is worth getting, if only for its uniquely entertaining and historical cover as well as the good remake of Hallowed Be Thy Name. It will forever hold a special place in my heart as my first ever Iron Maiden acquisition, having prompted me to get the band\u2019s older albums, and as such is one of my most well-chosen purchases.\n",
        "\n\u201cRun to the Hills\u201d is undoubtedly Iron Maiden\u2019s most recognizable song. Unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t live up to the enormous praise its legions of fans bestow upon it. Off The Number of the Beast, the song is probably one of the weakest, though it is by no means bad. A victim of radio overdose, it has overshadowed much of Maiden\u2019s storied career in the eyes of narrow-minded \u201cfans\u201d that somehow comprise a large portion of Maiden\u2019s more mainstream fan base.\n\nThe main problem with the song is its unrelenting cheesiness. It\u2019s not as much the lyrics as it is the delivery. The plight of the Native Americans makes an excellent lyrical topic, as proven by Judas Priest\u2019s \u201cSavage.\u201d However, Dickinson\u2019s insipid chorus melody may be one of the most grating performances he\u2019s ever done. Meanwhile, the second and third verses are delivered very well (though this can\u2019t be said about the first verse). Dickinson\u2019s chieftain-like howl before the final chorus fits in perfectly in an Indian-themed song. The guitar lines are also quite cheesy, though the drums work excellently with the overall theme. \u201cRun to the Hills\u201d contains its greatest moment in the guitar solo, which is incredibly classic and probably one of the most famous metal solos short of \u201cThe Trooper.\u201d Steve Harris closes the song well via one of his trademark bass jams.\n\nWhat really dominates the show, though, is \u201cTotal Eclipse.\u201d The dark atmosphere in this song is up to par with some of the bleakest songs Sabbath has done. Dickinson really carries the song with his malevolent delivery of the apocalyptic lyrics. The chorus is particularly demonic and memorable. The opening riff exemplifies what the song is about: depressing yet entertaining and unrelenting heavy metal. Additions such as the little scale in the middle of the second verse keep things fresh, and the solo ranks among Maiden\u2019s very best \u2013 it\u2019s insane and mania-inspiring, while the following vocals show just what Dickinson\u2019s operatic training makes him capable of. It\u2019s strange Maiden decided to make this a B-side, as it makes The Number of the Beast that much greater. \u201cGangland\u201d would have made a much better choice. Luckily \u201cTotal Eclipse\u201d is now readily available on the remastered edition of the album.\n\nThus concludes one of Maiden\u2019s better singles. Though it doesn\u2019t technically contain any rarities or even covers, the semi-rarity it does possess makes it more valuable in a Maiden collection because of its absolutely godly status. There\u2019s not really a necessity to obtain this now that \u201cTotal Eclipse\u201d is available on the album, but that\u2019s not really the point of this kind of single. If you see this, don\u2019t hesitate to pick it up \u2013 it\u2019s worth every penny.\n",
        "\nI am surprised this album hasn't been reviewed more. Quite simply, if you an Iron Maiden fan, and you don't have this record, go out and get it NOW. Or order it online...whatever, just make sure you add this to your collection.\n\nWhat does this album have that other live albums don't? Basically, the energy of 300,000 people feeding the energy of the band...powerful. But wait, there's more. I know a lot of people (myself included) have often been disappointed by some groups' attempts at releasing live albums. Often the performances don't quite match up to the excellence of the studio product. Oh sure, people will often say, \"Well, at least it's got the rawness and excitement of being live.\" But secretly, they're thinking, \"Wow, this sounded WAY better on the original record.\" Well, you won't say that when you hear Iron Maiden on Rock in Rio. In fact, the performances are SO good, it makes me wonder if they did a lot of overdubs in the studio, as many bands have done. Then again, I think it helps that this record features the amazing three-guitar lineup of Smith, Gers, and Murray. That has to go a long way to filling out the sound.\n\nOne thing that you will definitely notice, listening to Rock in Rio, is the tremendous momentum this band has from the very get-go. As soon as they hit the stage, they launch into \"The Wicker Man,\" and they never let up for the rest of the show. Of course, some of the songs with slower intros, such as \"The Sign of the Cross\" or \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\" offer a natural place to pause and gather up steam for the assault ahead, but regardless, I am amazed at how the band (especially Bruce) can sustain such a constant high level of power and energy. I'm sure having a few hundred thousand screaming Brazilians around doesn't hurt.\n\nSome of the most outstanding songs in this set include \"2 Minutes Til Midnight,\" \"The Trooper,\" \"Fear of the Dark\" and of course, the always excellent \"Run to the Hills.\" I think you'll agree that \"Fear of the Dark\" is substantially better in this live version than it was on the original record. And \"Run to the Hills\" is a great finale. Bruce's voice has rarely sounded better, and having the giant crowd sing along with him on the chorus is a real treat. I would also be remiss if I didn't mention the anthemic quality of \"The Clansman\" and the exceptional beauty and emotional power of \"Hallowed Be Thy Name.\" \n\nIn short, I agree with anyone who has said that this live album is a MUST for any Iron Maiden fan's collection. I can confidently say that you will not be disappointed by this outstanding performance.\n",
        "\nPerhaps the main reason that I had been attracted to heavy metal is the fact that the artists consistently utilize various works of literature, art, and other accomplishments of the human race throughout history as the subjects of their music. For some bands, mythology and culture received emphasis while others may focus on military conflicts of the past. For the band Iron Maiden, the focus has been on history and literature. When I decided to do a review on a Maiden album I decided not to do one of their earlier more influential pieces but rather the album they created when Bruce Dickinson returned to the band after a brief hiatus. \n\n\u201cBrave New World\u201d is the album that Iron Maiden released in 2000. The album is created in the likeness of the novel with the same name, and the album returns to the general theme of the novel throughout its span. Certain themes such as the future, transformation, death, and companionship are all explored in this album. \n\nOne fascinating thing, to me personally that I feel I should mention, is that this album is released as the 12th full-length album by Iron Maiden. I find it damned impressive for a band to release so many albums and remain consistently good without allowing the perverting grasp of commercialism transform the band from an epic group of metal pioneers (like Metallica, pre-Black album) to a bunch of whiny pussies bitching about royalties and putting their music aside. Maiden\u2019s legacy is, in my opinion, well-deserved and it is nothing but enhanced by this release.\n\nNow, on to the music. The album opens with [i]The Wickerman[/i], an incredibly catchy tune that has some less than enlightened lyrics. Despite the fact that the lyrics are rather poor, the song utilizes Dickinson\u2019s singing style better than most Maiden songs. The way that the band flows so naturally throughout the song is nothing but inspiring. [i]The Ghost of the Navigator[/i] is a filler song in a way, but it has some catchy guitar work and some interesting allusions (although not related to the novel that this album mirrors.)\n\nThe title track is a good track, but it certainly is not the best in the album. The chorus is somewhat repetitive and doesn\u2019t really say much more than \u201cbrave new world!\u201d over and over again. They have a few good strips of time where the band\u2019s three guitars remind you why you love Iron Maiden. [i]Blood Brothers[/i] is another one of those songs that proves that the band knows how to flow and more importantly how to use their incredibly singer.\n\nThe following three tracks are vastly inferior to the opening tracks on this album. They are much longer and in all honesty they do not accomplish as much as the other songs do, despite taking an average of 2 minutes more per song. [i]Out of the Silent Planet[/i] is the archetype of a filler and is easily forgotten. The album ends with, [i]The Thin Line Between Love and Hate[/i], which is largely out of place on this album. It has quite a few slow spots on the song, which although not inherently bad, they do wanting to listen to the first four songs on the album again for those catchy riffs. \n\nIron Maiden would go on to release two more full-length albums after this release, and neither of them are as good as Brave New World. Regardless, Maiden will be forever cemented as one of the Gods of metal, and this album certainly doesn't disappoint.\n",
        "\nUpon initially listening to A Matter of Life and Death, I thought I had recognized something no one else had noticed: namely, that this was perhaps one of the finest Christian metal albums I had ever heard. Well, upon further research and some gentle corrections from others, I have been forced to revise that opinion a bit. I still think there are some remarkable thematic elements that have fascinating parallels with Christian theology, and in that way, this is perhaps a more Christian album than many albums that purport to be contemporary Christian music. That being said, I don't think Iron Maiden set out to make a Christian record. I think they approached themes of life and death, peace and war, sin and salvation, with their customary integrity and honesty, and tapped into some universal themes.\n\nAllow me to illuminate my point a bit. The song that initially caught my attention and got me examining the lyrics was \"For the Greater Good of God.\" The last section piqued my curiosity: \"He gave his life for us, He fell upon the cross/ To die for all of those who never mourn His loss/ It wasn't meant for us to fell the pain again/ Tell me why... Tell me why...\" My initial thought was, this could be on a Petra album. Except, in a sense, this song is more honest and introspective than most of Petra's lyrics have ever been. This lyric is obviously referencing the death of Jesus, but it is asking a very valid question: Why? why do it, when no one seems to care? \n\nThere are some other excellent examples of theological introspection on the album, not to mention some thought provoking meditations on the horrors and stupidities of war. In the song \"Brighter Than a Thousand Suns,\" the last line is \"Holy Father, we have sinned...\" In the Making of A Matter of Life and Death documentary, Bruce Dickinson talks about this song being about the Manhattan Project, perhaps one of the most horrifying attempts of humankind to \"play God.\" \nThen there's \"Lord of Light\" which I initially thought was about Jesus. Well, it turns out I was wrong--it's specifically about Satan, or Lucifer (which literally means \"light bringer\" in Latin). Bruce Dickinson has described the song as taking the position that maybe the \"guy downstairs\" got a bit of a bad rap. Still, I think it is significant from a religious perspective to examine the \"relationship\" between God and Satan. After all, in the Bible, the Book of Job describes God talking to Satan as if they were old pals. I know some of my Christian brethren and sistren would find the idea that God and Satan could have some meaningful dialogue an idea that borders on blasphemous, but I don't think they have done their homework. Besides, this song has a fascinating musical development. It starts very quietly, almost broodingly, the guitars just percolating along, then there's a pause right before things erupt in a fury. I think it's a great dramatic description of an argument between the \"! guy downstairs\" and his old boss. Which leads me to what really separates this album from some of the dreck in Christian \"metal\": the music.\n\nI've seen some complaints about some of Iron Maiden's recent albums, how they don't rock as hard any more, etc. When it comes to this album, I completely disagree; A Matter of Life and Death rocks as hard as anything they've ever done. A perfect example is the aforementioned \"For the Greater Good of God,\" which has vocals that rise in intensity, matched only by the equally stunning guitar riffs. The intensity builds until the very end, when the passage I quoted above interrupts, as if the experience has emotionally drained him until all he can get out is that question of \"Why?\" In general on this album, Bruce spends a lot of time in his high range, which matches the emotionaly intensity of the lyrics quite well. Also, several of the songs begin with a quietly seething energy, which serves as an introduction to the power that follows (\"Brighter Than a Thousand Suns,\" for example). Perhaps those who complain about the heaviness of the sound (or lack thereof) don't appreciate the sublteties of beginning a piece with a controlled fury that later erupts. I believe the conviction with which Bruce sings, combined with the solid rhythmic drive of the rest of the band, form a perfectly matched combination of lyrical intensity, emotional power, and constant forward motion. Neither the lyrics nor the music seem to me to outshine each other; each serves the other.\n\nNicko McBrain has been very straightforward about his conversion to Christianity, as well as his decision to remain in the band, and I can't help but think that may have had an impact on the direction that this album took. But I don't want to give short shrift to the other guys, and their spiritual insights. This album may or may not be a \"Christian album\" in the strictest sense. But I wll tell you from a Christian standpoint that it is more insightful, harder rocking, and better produced than just about any album that purports to be Christian rock. The music is of an exceptionally high quality, and the lyrical content is powerful, honest, and to my way of thinking, highly thought provoking.\n",
        "\nKillers is a NWOBHM album of exceptional quality. If Paul Di'Anno hadn't been so fond of the old nose candy, I think he could have a had a great future with Iron Maiden. However, along came Bruce Dickinson, and the rest is history. But before that happened, he really did some good work on this project.\n\n\"Ides of March\" is a great opener, but surprisingly short. I hadn't looked at the timing of the track before I heard it, and when it came to an end, I thought, that's it? But you don't really have much time to lament the shortness of the opener, because \"Wrathchild\" really kicks it into high gear. I really think this is Paul Di'Anno's finest moment. His vocals actually kick major ass on this tune, and it's too bad he couldn't sustain that kind of quality all the time. \"Murders in the Rue Morgue\" sustains the adrenalin rush, with an almost punk-style frenzy. I don't think the vocals are quite as good here, but there is a nice snarly tone at work on the tune.\" Makes me wonder if the guys had been listening to a lot of punk (or mayber just Queen's song \"Sheer Heart Attack\"). \n\nI could go on track-by-track, but I won't. The thing that one notices on the first listen of this album, though, is how high the energy level is throughout. The guitars tear along at breakneck speed, and the drums and bass are right there with them. I mean, it's not Megadeth, but for the time, they were really on fire! As on the debut album, the guitar work is of exceptional quality, maybe even better than the first one. Welcome, Adrian Smith! Also, as I write this, and \"Genghis Khan\" is playing, my hat goes off to the amazing drums of Clive Burr. Wow. The combination of those glorious guitars with that super tight drumming is, quite simply awe inspiring. In fact, I would have to say, \"Genghis Khan\" is the best track on the record. That being said, though, I don't think there's a bad track on this album. If Iron Maiden's career had ended with this album, they could still have held their heads high.\n\nSince I've given props to pretty much everyone on this album, I would be remiss if I forgot to mention Steve Harris's kick ass bass playing throughout, most notably on the excellent \"Innocent Exile.\" Not to simplify too much, but every member of the group gives his all on this album. If the first two Iron Maiden albums were the only ones that existed, I would have said that they had set the bar about as high as it could go. However, \"Number of the Beast\" was about to come along, and that showed that that bar still had another notch or two left above it.\n",
        "\nSince I've only recently \"discovered\" Iron Maiden (shortly after discovering this site), I thought it would be an interesting experiment to listen to all of their albums in order. I've already reviewed their most recent album, A Matter of Life and Death, and so now I'm going back to the beginning: the eponymous Iron Maiden.\n\nListening to this album is kind of like listening to early Deep Purple: many of the renowned elements are in place, but they haven't yet added the elements that would make them great. Basically, seen on its own merits, this is a good album. The guitar work is great, the blistering riffs, the changes in tempo and meter, the dark atmosphere. The most noticeable thing, knowing what Iron Maiden would later become, is the vocals. The main element that made me take notice of Iron Maiden in the first place, Bruce Dickinson's amazing voice, was not yet a part of the Iron Maiden sound. Not that Paul Di'Anno's voice is bad. He's a capable lead singer, but he tends to be overshadowed by the excellent guitar work. Once again, the parallel to Purple is inescapable. I wonder what it would be like to have heard this album before all the other ones. Did the early Iron Maiden fans welcome Bruce Dickinson into the fold, or did they regret the loss of Di'Anno?\n\nThere are certainly some standout tracks here, \"Phantom of the Opera\" being one of the most notable, perhaps. \"Charlotte the Harlot\" must have struck a chord among Maiden fans, too, as it became so legendary. Listening to it today, I was struck by the almost prog rock sound of the track: lots of meter changes, with the drums playing the same rhythms as the vocal line. Sadly for Paul Di'Anno, I think \"Charlotte the Harlot\" most exposes the weakness of his voice. But you gotta LOVE the guitar work in that tune. And I personally really enjoy the different levels of \"Remember Tomorrow.\" There is also some very fine guitar work on the track \"Transylvania.\" The track entitled \"Iron Maiden\" reminds me quite a bit of \"Speed King,\" by Deep Purple (without the organ). Fast and energetic, it also suffers from substandard vocals by Di'Anno.\n\nI guess you have to appreciate the success of these early albums, which apparently worked well enough to lead to the later glory of the Iron Maiden, while being thankful that the band realized what they needed to adjust to reach their potential. I think we can safely say that, if Paul Di'Anno had remained in the group, it would have been difficult (if not impossible) for them to become the Iron Maiden we know and love. I probably won't listen to this album nearly as much as I will many of their others, but it's still an enlightening experience.\n",
        "\nIron Maiden is one of the few bands that can boast an entire decade\u2019s worth of quality material \u2013 the only other bands that come to mind are Judas Priest and Black Sabbath. And all legacies have to start somewhere; for Maiden, it\u2019s their 1980 debut. NWOBHM to the core, yet harboring subtle tendencies for something radically new and different (which the band would realize once they acquired the legendary Dickinson), this album takes what was an established genre and raises it to an entirely unprecedented level. From the raw, gritty production to Derek Riggs\u2019s phenomenal cover art, Iron Maiden\u2019s eponymous offering unrelentingly bores \u201cmetal\u201d into your psyche like a drill.\n\nThere\u2019s a ton to like here, whether it be the straightforward, headbang-worthy rockers, the progressive epics or (surprise, surprise!) the moody ballads. The band takes no prisoners with constant yet varied barrages of musical domination. The guitars drip with steely power, Harris defiantly flaunts his unique bass prowess, and the underrated Clive Burr does much more than simply keep the beat. At the forefront is Paul Di\u2019Anno, proving himself a force to be reckoned with.\n\nSongs like \u201cProwler\u201d and \u201cRunning Free\u201d abound with cool riffs and street-smart lyrics. Maiden are not content to stagnate into repetitiveness as so many other bands do, and so even these straightforward rockers vary quite a bit. The former includes tasteful wah-wah guitar (take that, Metallica!), a proto-Dickinson-era solo (which is inherently good) and subtle changes in tempo, while the latter contains a distinctive drum intro and the first example of Harris\u2019s famous galloping bass \u2013 not to mention some of Di\u2019Anno\u2019s toughest vocals. That section in the middle where he shouts \u201cbreak!\u201d has to be one of the coolest things ever, something revisited in the later \u201cRevelations\u201d to great effect.\n\nAgain choosing to make their music more eclectic, Maiden balances the heavy rock with slower, more brooding numbers like \u201cRemember Tomorrow.\u201d It\u2019s full of cryptic lyrics (apparently about Di\u2019Anno\u2019s father) delivered in a more sentimental way, proving Di\u2019Anno is quite multitalented. The song plays with sections of heaviness up to its climax, where it explodes into something much more than your typical metal ballad, finally erupting into its famed bass-led outro. \u201cRemember Tomorrow\u201d ranks among the best songs Maiden ever did \u2013 no wonder Dickinson sang it at his audition!\n\nIron Maiden also shows progressive tendencies with the epic \u201cPhantom of the Opera.\u201d A precursor to later numbers such as \u201cRime of the Ancient Mariner\u201d or \u201cTo Tame a Land,\u201d it eschews the strictly heavy metal riffs for those of progressive rock (not a bad thing by any means.) The song is multi-layered with alternating heavy, soft, fast, and slow parts, yet again proving that Maiden will not cement themselves in one style. The long instrumental sections hint at those of \u201cHallowed Be Thy Name\u201d and Maiden\u2019s other seven-plus-minute opuses.\n\nFollowing Maiden\u2019s number-one track is their longest instrumental, \u201cTransylvania.\u201d It sounds less like an instrumental in the vein of \u201cThe Ides of March\u201d or \u201cGenghis Khan\u201d in that it rather resembles a section in one of Maiden\u2019s longer works, containing multiple parts and several guitar solos, in sections highlighting each instrument. The album is rounded out with a couple more rockish tunes, not quite up to the level of the aforementioned \u201cProwler\u201d and \u201cRunning Free\u201d but still drenched in quality.\n\nIt\u2019s not quite the most famous or the best thing Maiden\u2019s ever done (those honors go to The Number of the Beast and Killers, respectively), but it\u2019s a highly respectable first step. Trailing behind only its follow-up in innovation and variation, it\u2019s the important beginning of Maiden\u2019s storied career \u2013 and Maiden would only get better as time went on.\n",
        "\nI can\u2019t stress enough how much I hate it when good songs get chopped up into shadows of their former selves in the name of getting radio play. Such efforts can only result in sub par versions of songs that still won\u2019t appeal to the vapid tastes of people too cheap to spend money on Cds and too slavish to try and regulate their listening habits without the assistance of a disk jockey. But this single essentially does all of that without any accounting for how it robs the listening experience of its original power.\n\n\u201cVirus\u201d is a good song when heard in its entirety, sort of like a lost track that just missed making it onto \u201cThe X Factor\u201d. It\u2019s written in the progressive/epic style of said album with an elongated quiet intro, though a bit more droning and less developed, and then climaxes suddenly with a jump in tempo and volume. But the shortened version on here slices off the entire intro and just cuts right to the climax, essentially changing what is supposed to be a drawn out song into an incredibly uneven, up tempo song in the same vain as \u201cFutureal\u201d. When things finally settle down to that finale that recaps the opening drone, a listener who hasn\u2019t heard the full version of this can only find himself in a state of pure perplexity.\n\nThe pointlessness of things is further aggravated by the inclusion of two songs that were already heard on the \u201cLord Of The Flies\u201d single. They are solid cover songs with a good performance out of Bayley, but if you follow this era of the band then there is little point in getting this. I particularly find the inclusion of \u201cDoctor, Doctor\u201d interesting because when you compare the instrumental intro with guitar solo, there is a level of commonality to the intro of \u201cVirus\u201d, but again that only applies with that intro actually being on the version of the song being heard.\n\nIf someone is in the market and sees a copy of the \u201cVirus\u201d single, do not buy it if it is this version. The other two versions contain the song in its entirety and actually have unique b-sides that aren\u2019t seen on any other previous singles. The ideal one to get would be the \u201cUK part 2\u201d version as the Metal For Muthas versions of \u201cSanctuary\u201d and \u201cWrathchild\u201d are the most unique, and also because Blaze pulls off the Di\u2019Anno era better than Bruce usually does.\n",
        "\n\u201cThe X Factor\u201d was almost as much a rock album as it was a metal album, not only in how the character of the guitars was softened, but also in how the songwriting was cut back to something more akin to a late 70s revisiting of the roots of the NWOBHM. This particular release is the best representation of said albums parallel nature with pre-metal rock of the hard and progressive variety as it sits one of their barest, plainest, and catchiest songs alongside two well respected hits by two well known bands from the 70s British rock scene. Needless to say, the influences are fairly blatant, although Iron Maiden takes both of these songs into a somewhat harder edged direction.\n\n\u201cMy Generation\u201d is a natural selection for this band as it gives Steve Harris plenty of instances to show his dominance as a player and as a general force in the band. Blaze has a pretty easy time hitting all of Roger Daltrey\u2019s notes, though his huskier voice punches to the forefront even with a similarly distant sounding vocal mix to the original approach used in the original version. Part of what makes this sort of song work better for Bayley than Bruce Dickinson\u2019s material is that the high notes are shouted rather than sung and held out. \n\n\u201cDoctor Doctor\u201d proves to be a bit more interesting as it is heavily similar to Maiden\u2019s signature sound of catchy yet drawn out songs. That expressive and melodic guitar solo at the beginning over that droning accompanying guitar has been applied in varying ways by Maiden going all the way back to their debut album. The principle chord progression is very similar to the one employed on the chorus of the title track of this single, although a little bit slower in tempo and with a less repetitive vocal line. Once again, Blaze puts forth a solid and impressive vocal delivery, getting out all of those tricky high notes with his lower end baritone range without breaking into a less tuneful shouting voice.\n\nThis is basically something that would be essential for any fan of the Blaze years if it wasn\u2019t so damned hard to come by now. The covers on here are among the best performances that Blaze ever did with the band, and show a clear picture of where this band came from. The b-sides definitely tower over the a-side here, though \u201cLord Of The Flies\u201d is a fairly decent song. It\u2019s definitely a whole lot more interesting than some of the crappy cover albums of classic rock songs that have come out in the past couple of years.\n",
        "\nI\u2019ve considered myself to be somewhat a connoisseur in the art of witnessing musicians overcorrect when criticism gets thrown their way, but Maiden really threw me when I first heard this song. The only threshold that this lump of half assed 70s rock drudgery fails to cross is the one set by Black Sabbath at around the same time when they were hit with criticisms of sucking because they got Ice-T to do a duet with Tony Martin on their \u201cForbidden\u201d album. This was not the band\u2019s worse moment, but the fans didn\u2019t see it that way and thus the band followed it with 10 years of living in the past as Ozzy Osbourne morphed the band from a creative force still putting out music into a sideshow attraction for his own annual self-worship sessions otherwise known as Ozzfest. \n\nNaturally I also believe that like Sabbath\u2019s \u201cForbidden\u201d, \u201cThe X Factor\u201d was a solid yet misunderstood album because it was a pretty big departure from prior efforts. It\u2019s reception was lukewarm, despite being a heavily ambitious album that spawned two fairly good songs that are represented here in live versions. Convinced that what everyone wanted was a return to the plastic banana days of \u201cBring Your Daughter\u2026To The Slaughter\u201d and \u201cFrom Here To Eternity\u201d, Steve Harris put away his deep and dark thinking and broke out his occasional fits of tolerable stadium fanfare and injected them with a heavy dose of crack cocaine. What resulted was a song that doesn\u2019t qualify as Metal, but some sort of bastardization of The Who with a slight dash of Motley Crue. The only real silver lining to be found here amid this sea of formulaic sing along moments and endless repetition is that they cut about 3 and \u00bd minutes of the latter to make the song more bearable than its full length version on \u201cVirtual XI\u201d.\n\nTo make matters worse, the level of superiority that the two live songs on here have to the title track is so large that it becomes a really sick joke. You contrast that really insane bass intro to \u201cBlood On The World\u2019s Hands\u201d, which all but makes Geezer Bulter sound as old and behind the curve as his nickname would suggest, and the darkness and varied feelings put forth on \u201cThe Aftermath\u201d, you wonder if it\u2019s all the same band or if Maiden did a split release with Pete Townsend with Dave and Janick doing guest lead slots on his latest variation on his pop oriented radio single drivel.\n\nAlthough \u201cVirtual XI\u201d was basically an all around failure with only a few redeeming moments, this song is the bottom of Maiden\u2019s musical barrel. This is something that a person who is familiar with this band\u2019s entire history is ashamed to admit he has ever heard this. The word for this album is avoid, so quick get out and spread the word.\n",
        "\nAmong the many tepid singles that came out of the Blaze Bayley years of Iron Maiden, this was one of the better ones. It\u2019s not nearly up to par with anything that the band put out with Paul Di\u2019anno and only moderately better than the worst of the early 90s work with Bruce Dickinson, but it\u2019s still a pretty fun listen if you go for Maiden\u2019s signature songwriting and are not overly obsessed with the style of vocalist putting the melodies to the music. Blaze\u2019s vocal performance is basically strong because on every song on here he\u2019s mostly in his element, although occasionally his voice does struggle with some of the high notes on the live material.\n\nIt\u2019s somewhat ironic that a live version of \u201cThe Evil That Men Do\u201d made it on here, because the main riff of the single\u2019s title song is very close to one of the riffs from that song. Naturally what surrounds the riff on \u201cFutureal\u201d is a really dense barrage of bass chords that fit in more with the bands\u2019 90s material, but there is an overall feeling of trying to reach back with this song. It\u2019s very simple and it\u2019s mostly effective, although compared to the extremely basic songs on \u201cIron Maiden\u201d and \u201cNo Prayer For The Dying\u201d it\u2019s pretty primitive riff wise. \n\nThe live songs on here are basically solid in their delivery, though the absence of Dickinson is really felt on \u201cThe Evil That Men Do\u201d. Of all of the songs from the 80s that the band performed live with Bayley, this is the one that he tended to struggle with the least, mostly because it doesn\u2019t spend much time in the upper register of the air raid siren\u2019s vocal range. The live version of \u201cMan On The Edge\u201d is solid, as has been the case with whoever performs this song. It basically plays and sings itself because it\u2019s very well written and brilliantly merges the melancholy melodies of Maiden\u2019s early 90s sound with the riffing approach heard in the mid-80s. \n\nToday this single is pretty rare, but if you can find it and you\u2019re either a completist or a Blaze fan, it would be worth the effort. Maiden never put out a live album with Bayley, and in spite of the extremely cheesy and over the top special effects oriented music video for \u201cThe Angel And The Gambler\u201d found on here, there aren\u2019t many weak moments. Blaze and Maiden both went on to do bigger and better things after this, but that doesn\u2019t mean that it wasn\u2019t a valiant effort with a few rewards to show for it.\n",
        "\nFor close to an hour on this Classic Albums DVD, you get to hear from Iron Maiden themselves as well as from those close to them about their thoughts during the writing and recording of The Number of the Beast.\n\nHearing Bruce Dickinson describe how he spent four hours trying to record the perfect version of the first four lines of the title track under the stern eye of producer Martin \"Head Master\" Birch is hilarious. Then you get to hear a little bit of that legendary scream unaccompanied by instruments and the rawness in Dickinson's voice is apparent. It seems as if the scream continued beyond what you hear on the album which wouldn't be a surprise considering the lung might of the man deemed \"The Air Raid Siren.\" The legend of \"22 Acacia Avenue\" and \"Charlotte the Harlot\" is given a brief mention, but doesn't add to what fans already knew from hearing the songs. Perhaps this notorious avenue was located in the same part of London where Rob Halford's favorite S&M shop provided the first incarnation of the metal uniform. Maybe Charlotte worked the same corner as Deep Purple's Sweet Lucy from \"Knockin' At Your Back Door,\" the girl in Motorhead's \"Jailbait,\" and Venom's \"Lady Lust.\" Maybe all of those songs are about the same person. Maybe I'm reading too much into this! Moving on, you can sense the pride in songwriter Adrian Smith's voice when he says that this song which he wrote when he was 18 ended up on a platinum-selling album as well as becoming a part of the live show for the next three tours. Proof that if you play for Iron Maiden, then all of your wildest infinite dreams will come true.\n\nOne surprising revelation on this DVD is that it wasn't Clive Burr who initiated \"The Prisoner,\" but a bored and frustrated Bruce Dickinson whose dead simple drumbeat in a rehearsal room was then given a riff from Adrian Smith. Dickinson discusses more details about the song as he walks through what appears to be the set of The Prisoner TV show. In discussing \"Run to the Hills,\" Steve Harris states what should be obvious in that the song is not an attempt at a political statement, rather a story about the clash between American Indians and cavalry soldiers. In other words, a metal song about colonial times or even the wild west. Later, when the band recall the American leg of The Number of the Beast tour, it's funny how in one scene Dave Murray says that the band weren't partying or getting plastered every night, but then you see a picture of him, possibly plastered, staring straight at you with nothing but mischief and shenanigans in his eyes. It seems that one of the nicest guys in metal knows how to party when the opportunity arises!\n\nThe main flaws on this video are the comments from Dave Mustaine. Nothing he says gives you a better understanding of The Number of the Beast. Most of his comments are used as one-liners to offer some humor, but he's simply not funny. Cronos of Venom could have had you laughing on the floor in addition to giving a unique firsthand account of Iron Maiden's impact on the New Wave of British Heavy Metal. Also, it's disappointing that not every song on the album is discussed or even mentioned. The quirky melodies of \"Invaders\" always reminded me of an angrier and heavier Rush and it would've been interesting to hear if they were indeed an influence on that song. While not a comprehensive view of the album, this DVD offers some new perspectives about the songs that are given attention.\n\nOverall, this Classic Albums DVD gives you a brief yet enjoyable peek into the inner world of classic Iron Maiden. If you're new to the band (there's always an eager novice out there discovering the power of metal bands from before their time), then this video will only make you want to hear the album so check out The Number of the Beast first. To state the obvious, this is a must for Maiden fans.\n",
        "\nThis album came out after a disappointing (at least in my opinion) release. Somewhere in Time was nothing compared to Powerslave; there are, of course, some good songs there, like the title track and the fantastic Alexander the Great, but all the others were just average and even weak. Seventh Son isn't nowhere near the brilliance and quality of Powerlave but is, undoubtedly, a big improvement over its predecessor. Actually, this record probably is the only good album that Maiden released from 1988 to 1999.\n\nFirst of all, (almost!) every song of the album share the same concept and that really shows the progressive influences of the band, since the composition of concept albums is a common thing within the progressive circles. On one hand, the concept is strange: it apparently speaks about a prophet that tries to warn a village about a disaster that will happen there, in the future. On other hand, some songs don't seem to clearly follow that concept, but one thing is certain: the meaning of life and God are two subjects present on every tune of the record, no exceptions. So, while all the tracks may not follow the concept and the storyline, those two subjects are always present. This was quite a revolutionary step for Iron Maiden, as they've never something similar before.\n\nThe songwriting is what shines the most on the album. This english act always crafted fine heavy metal songs and this record is an example of the way they've improved on this field over the years. From the interesting breaks and sections of Infinite Dreams, to the gorgeous solo section of the title track, everything is very well composed and almost every song has an interesting musical/lyrical hook. Harris is the main songwriter of the band, and this album proves it again: he wrote (or co-wrote) every song but Moonchild. That one was penned by Smith and Dickison. Murray has also writing credits on The Prophecy, I think. Another important component of Seventh Son is the stellar drumming. When reviewing an Iron Maiden album, people always say things like \u201cthe guitars rule\u201d and \u201cthe bass is excellent\u201d and so on. Nicko McBrain doesn't get half of the praise he deserves really. He's not a flashy drummer at all; he doens't play the most technical beats or the fastest fills, but he plays with feeling and his versatility is enormous. Generally, he plays simple beats but he's always adding something new when one isn't expecting; his performance on the title track is an example, with the constant use of the toms. Finally, the use of synth is also worth mentioning, giving a nice touch to the whole atmosphere of the album, especially on the quieter parts (middle section of the title track; Infinite Dreams)\n\nThe production is very clean too, there are some people that even said that the production is TOO clean, but I don't agree with that statement. In fact, the production is one thousand times better than the one on Somewhere in Time, so this album shows a vast improvement. The bass is also very audible and that's another reason to give it a high score. Good work, Martin Birch.\n\nThe main highlight of the album is obviously the amazing title track, clocking in at around nine minutes. Following the path of Rime of the Ancient Mariner and Alexander, the Great, this song is yet another remarkable example of the progressive rock influences carried by Iron Maiden. While Rime was longer, I can assure you that Seventh Son is much better developed and probably the most progressive song this act ever composed. The first minutes are dominated by the heavy instrumentation and by the strong vocals of Bruce Dickinson (try not to sing along with that hooky chorus!). However, the best part of the song is the last one, hands down. After that somber breakdown (extremely reminiscent of the middle part of Rime, truth must be told), the guitar solos kick in and oh my God, those guys are on fire! Really, those solos are just jaw-dropping, long yet catchy, always accompanied by proper drumming and the atmospheric synth. Infinite Dreams comes next as the second best song, probably being the best ballad ever done by this act. Emotional and complex, excellent stuff!\n\nOn other hand, there are a couple of not-so-good songs here, unfortunately. The Prophecy is very forgettable and, okay, even boring (I love the acoustic outro, though). Can I Play With Madness? Is one of the most commercial Iron Maiden tunes and while being quite fun to listen to during the first couple of times, it gets old VERY quick. And finally, the last stinker: The Evil that Men Do!! Oh yes, how the hell is this song considered a classic? Whiny lyrics, very poor guitar work, annoying chorus... yes, it's that bad! One of the most overrated heavy metal pieces, really.\n\nSo, at the end of the day this is a pretty solid and varied album, but unfortunately there are two or three weak songs that really bring it down. If you want the best Maiden album, go for Powerslave instead of this one. Don't get me wrong though, look at the rating, Seventh Son is still a classic, but Powerslave is much more consistent and sounds better as a whole.\n\nBest moments of the CD:\n-beginning of Infinite Dreams;\n-the whole solo section of the title track.\n",
        "\nCan you imagine what the result could be if you give a band like Iron Maiden a huge stage and 250,000 people? Well, no need to, because your dream has come true. \n\nThis is the greatest concert ever filmed and the most electrifying performance ever given by any band. Period. What the surprising factor is, that the band we\u2019re talking about here was formed back in \u201975 and this was done on the 19th of January 2001. If there\u2019s one band that prevents people from saying that all the legends have lost touch and are aging, it\u2019s this one! \n\nWhen Bruce returned in \u201999, within no time they managed to shed out what at least in my opinion is one of the more important albums of the decade, Brave New World. And when the album itself is an unmitigated classic, nothing can stop it from being followed up with an invigorating live performance and a stellar recording/production to go with it. \n\nHere we see a band in its full form, a band with a 40+ vocalist who hasn\u2019t lost an ounce of his talent and has a stage presence that can make our current favourites shit their pants. Today when you look at concerts you see musicians trying so hard not to make a mistake that they don\u2019t move an inch, making the whole point of having live concerts worthless.\n\nFrom Di\u2019Anno era\u2019s Wrathchild to Bayley\u2019s Sign of The Cross, the bands best to their second best (current), songs from almost all albums have been played here. The improvisations are impressive and air-guitar essentials (as if their songs already weren\u2019t), the bass is audible and most importantly, the crowd is audible. There just isn\u2019t any flaw. Once you start listening you\u2019ll get so caught up in the atmosphere, its almost equal to being there. Instead of taking revitalizing tonics and drinking coffee, you might want to listen to this everyday first thing in the morning. Highlights include Hallowed Be Thy Name, Fear Of The Dark & The Trooper. \n\nIf you\u2019re thinking of getting your first (Iron Maiden) DVD, don\u2019t overlook this one due to its date, because with Iron Maiden, there are no recessions and booms, their whole career is their prime.\n",
        "\nBeing 12 years old at the time of its release and just recently getting into heavy metal, I had no preconceived notions about this album. I came across the album cover in a magazine and not knowing the illustrious legacy I was later to experience, purchased it as my first Iron Maiden slab. Another year would go by before a new friend instructed me to get Live After Death and discover the classic Maiden. After years of worship and review I'd rate this album as better than No Prayer and Fear, miles beyond the abortion of Virtual XI and far more realized than Matter of Life and Death. \n\n\nThere are some lulls in the flow, particularly Fortunes of War through The Aftermath. Fortunes drags on and is only worth hearing for the solo, which Blaze ruins with his urgent repition of the title. The next two are like companion pieces and are unmemorable save for Blaze's line about \"Where mustard gas and barbed wire bloom\". Edge and 2 AM back pedal a bit from the glorious Judgement of Heaven and the doomy Blood on the Worlds Hands. It's a shame Judgement Day didn't make it on to the album as it's one of the stronger rockers this line up played. The album only being 71 minutes long they easily could have added J-Day, Justice of the Peace or I Live My Way, maybe dropping one or two of the aforementioned tracks.\n\n\nThe remainder is Maiden at their most progressive since Seventh Son. The Unbeliever ends the album with odd-meter verses and a straight ahead epic chorus. The opening epic, Sign of the Cross boasts one of Maiden's finest solos and Steve's acoustic bass intro to Blood on the World's Hands reveals a new layer to the band I wish they explored more.\n\n\nThe guitars could stand some balls as this album has their thinnest guitar tone, articulate but lacking a power and energy that could've made this transition album go more smooth. The drums sound phenominal, the hihat and snare in paricular and as always, Steve Harris' bass tone is loud and clear. Blaze is a great singer. If you check out his first post-Maiden solo disc, Silicon Messiah or his previous outfit Wolfsbane, you'll see he was just not a great choice to follow Bruce, given the musical climate. There are songs on here he owns, and lauded as Bruce's live version of Sign from Rock in Rio and other notable remakes, the Blaze versions are superior.\n\n\nWith a different track list and better guitar tone, this album would have no doubt been better received. Unforunately, this was as good as it got for them and Blaze.\n",
        "\nIron Maiden's roster was fairly unstable in the early days, with each of the first four albums featuring a slightly different lineup; what's generally considered the classic incarnation would not be heard until Piece of Mind. It goes without saying the most significant of those changes was the frontman switch that took place between Killers and The Number of the Beast; it not only drastically altered Iron Maiden's sound on an aesthetic level, but altered their general character as well. Where before Maiden with Di'Anno at the helm favored gritty, violent songs about, well, gritty violence (often of a sexual nature and set in the modern day), the Bruce-led band favored songs about epic battles, historical conflicts, and of course general mythology, science fiction, and fantasy subjects. I wouldn't say that Iron Maiden \"invented\" those themes in metal per se, but they definitely played a major role in pioneering and popularizing them. While that may sound like a positive change, it also came with a drawback; to illustrate, an anecdote. I once saw an interview with Bruce, in which he explained the reasoning behind his stage antics; small gestures would be missed by those in the back row of a huge stadium, so in order to get what he wants across he has to exaggerate his motions to larger-than-life proportions. Just think about that for a moment. I doubt he was trying to be deep, but Bruce's simple and sensible explanation also seems to describe his music with Iron Maiden quite well: everything is large and exaggerated, written in CAPITAL LETTERS so even those in the back row know what's going on. Of course, the back row in this metaphorical sense unfortunately refers to the mentally rather than financially challenged. Dickinsonian Maiden seems to have lost much of its former subtlety, and everything is LARGE and out in the open, for better or for worse. Because of that, sometimes the Bruce-era material sounds too over-the-top, as if you're watching a high-budget action movie where the excessive gore, explosions, and/or general violence lack supporting substance, such that all the drama totally loses impact and becomes cartoonish (think \"summer blockbuster\"). Nowhere is this more apparent than in the title track, which is fun but almost unbearably cheesy and vapid to boot (but more on that later). Still, that over-the-top aspect Bruce brought also allowed Maiden to do amazing songs like \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\", which I can't imagine them even attempting with Di'Anno (of course, Bruce can't pull off Di'Anno-era songs, either). In short: Bruce is amazing on successfully emotionally intense songs, but often painfully too much for those that fall short or require subtlety or grit. Most (good) NWOBHM bands sound like they could beat you up, Di'Anno Maiden more than any; Bruce sounds like he's been in the library all day. Angel Witch sound instead like they were on the receiving end of some beatings, but that's a story for another time.\n\nEverything can't be laid at Bruce's feet, though; he's the most obvious change in the band, but he isn't the primary songwriter. Harris seems to have gotten a bit lazy on this album, going for a more upbeat, simpler, and what I can only call \"poppier\" approach on many of the songs he's credited with (the notable exception being, of course, the monumental album closer). The only song he doesn't have at least partial writing credit for here is fucking terrible, though, so what the hell; damned if you do, damned if you don't. On to the songs!\n\n\"Invaders\" opens the album on a promising note, with the epic tone it quickly sets simultaneously setting the Bruce-era apart from the Di'Anno-era, in which this exultant epic energy would've seemed totally out of place. Instead of stalking women through claustrophobic London alleyways and chopping them up to statisfy lust undeniably perverse, we're chasing women through burning villages and raping them to satisfy lust...except it was socially acceptable then, so you and Bruce feel just fine about it afterward. But wait, what the fuck is this? That silly chorus comes in like a wrecking ball of cotton candy and turns the delicious atmosphere to shit! Yes, it's another of those \"what the fuck were they thinking\" moments, like the shitty main riffs in \"Sanctuary\" or \"Running Free\", except this is a whole chorus and \"Invaders\" is actually quite nice besides that. My guess is Maiden were trying to do another of those quick mood shifts they seemed to like a lot early in their career, as heard on \"Charlotte the Harlot\" and \"Remember Tomorrow\", but while those songs worked fairly well despite the abruptness, \"Invaders\" fails utterly. The serious and tense tone with the defenders preparing for the viking invasion is replaced by farce as, apparently, the longships unload hordes of invading Smurfs, who proceed to merrily frolic the village to the ground (\"Papa Smurf always says: 'rape, then pillage, then burn the place to the ground,' and Papa Smurf is always right.\"). I can see what Maiden were trying to do here; it's the same thing they do in \"Run to the Hills\", where first we get the perspective and mood of the Indians and then that of the American soldiers, so one would expect hordes of Vikings to have an upbeat and bloodthirsty theme like the soldiers; instead it's like you're watching a good action movie on TV when the channel randomly switches to loud cartoons for a few seconds, making you jump, but the channel switches itself back again before you can figure out what the hell happened. Now, imagine that three times every three minutes, and I'm sure you'd just turn off the TV in disgust, no matter how good the movie you were watching was. What makes it worse though is that unlike \"Sanctuary\", the rest of \"Invaders\" is fucking good! Epic feel, cool lyrics putting you in the battlefield (\"Axes grind and maces clash as wounded fighters fall to the ground/Severed limbs and fatal woundings bloody corpses lie all around\"), honestly I'm far more irritated than if they had just written a song bad all the way through (which they did, but more on that later). It's as if Harris made us a shit sandwich, but used some really good bread to fool us into taking a nice big bite, wasting the bread in the process, of course. I mean for fuck's sake, the chorus \"riff\" isn't really even a riff, it's a fucking major scale; up five notes, down five notes. It's as if \"inspiration\" struck during highschool band warm-ups, or something. \n\nLuckily, \"Children of the Damned\" is quite a bit more interesting. It starts as basically a ballad, with the slow pace complimenting the ominous tone, and Bruce's emotional performance is good; the only downside to the song is the overlong chorus, which feels even longer when preceded by the shorter, superior verses. But once the song picks up after the second chorus, we never hear it again, so at least there's that. Some laughably claim this tempo shift \"ruins\" the atmosphere built up in the slow section. Rather than ruining it, the acceleration serves to heighten the tension and mood, without shattering it like on \"Invaders\"; the faster section is the best part of the song, hands-down. The tedious chorus doesn't make a return and the song is fairly short, so overall I'd call it pretty good aside from the pacing problems. It's definitely better than the previous track, but not nearly as good as \"Remember Tomorrow\" thanks to the tiresome chorus, though otherwise the songs are similar. I really wish Iron Maiden had tried more songs like this, they're better at slow, moody songs than people usually give them credit for (most tend to harp on the fast upbeat pieces or long epics), and with a little revision this one could've been a lot better. \n\n\"The Prisoner\" starts out slow, with an intro from the old TV show (a good series, I might add), followed by...an instrumental intro. Two intros for the price of one! Yeah, they should've dumped one or the other, and Clive's drum beat is rather obnoxious to be the focus of the second intro, but anyway once the song finally gets going after more than a minute (and it's not even the album opener!), it's pretty exciting. Sure it's upbeat, and an easy target for accusations of being poppy, but like \"Run to the Hills\" and unlike \"Invaders\" or the title track, this one is actually justifiably and believably upbeat in its portrayal of the exultant emotional release of #6 who is finally free of his captors. SPIT IN YOUR EYE, I WILL DEFY! Freedom and escape from oppression (whether at the deliberate hands of a conspiracy, or just society and/or religion's restrictions in general) have always been major themes in metal, and \"The Prisoner\" does a good job of bottling that for our enjoyment. Sure, it's a tad overlong and repetitive, but if you ignore the double-intro (easy to do) and get swept up in the mood of the song it's good; the chorus especially is fantastic, and the driving riffs during the verses really hit home. Another song where Bruce's \"over-the-top\" nature isn't out of place.\n\nNow, \"22 Acacia Avenue\" is a sequel to \"Charlotte the Harlot\", and predictably Di'Anno probably would've fit the song better; it was likely even written for him, as the vocal melodies are pretty restrained in range and difficulty for the most part, with no multi-tracking at all. Bruce does a good job, don't get me wrong, but he just lacks the grit that would've made a dirty, desperate song about a whore much better. The song is fairly long, second-longest after \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\", and it justifies its length well with an interesting structure. In the first minute-thirty it shifts between a slow, tense section and a \"release\" section that's more upbeat twice before going into a totally different section for a while...honestly it's pretty progressive, and unlike most of the songs on the album, it's the instruments that hold interest rather than the vocal lines, which definitely play a more supporting role. If any song on this album could be considered a grower, I'd say it's this one; repeated listens definitely rewarded me with a greater appreciation for it. I'd even say it's stronger than \"Charlotte the Harlot\", and definitely the sleeper hit of the album. \n\nThe title track is one many people like to cite as a Maiden classic, but I suspect it's more because it's essentially pop with metal aesthetics; before you scoff and decide I'm full of pretentious crap, pause for a moment of dispassionate reflection. The song is upbeat and happy, very simple both structurally and technically, and in fact the only remarkable thing about it at all is, of course, the charismatic singer. The \"Satanic\" theme is utterly incidental; Bruce could easily be singing about joyriding at 666 MPH or fucking 666 women in a row (you decide which is more impressive) rather than running from the devil in a dream, judging by the mood. I don't know about you, but a terrifying nightmare doesn't put me in the mood to dance around, and honestly the most flattering conclusion I can reach is that the lyrics were written separately and only put to the music out of convenience or coincidence. Still, ludicrous claims of quality and dubious theme/mood harmony aside, it's a fun little song. I find it strange that something as obviously poppy and radio friendly is so revered in a community that supposedly abhors such qualities, but there are many examples of similar sheep dressed in the wolf's clothing of a metal sound that have also attained popularity among metalheads, so I suppose it should come as no surprise. Always be wary of musical opinion in aggregate; I'd take the say-so of one guy I know I can trust over a million faceless fans any day of the week and twice on Sundays.\n\n\"Run to the Hills\" is also considered by some a classic, while others abhor it, probably due in part to it being one of the best-known and most-played Maiden songs of all time. And it's easy to see why; it's catchy, upbeat, and emphasizes the classic NWOBHM gallop to great effect, capturing the feel of soldiers chasing down the redskins on horseback very well. It also displays the first of what I like to call Maiden's BFCs, or Big Fucking Choruses (as heard on later songs such as \"Two Minutes to Midnight\" and \"Aces High\", among others). I'm not much of a radio listener, so the song hasn't really been ruined for me, but I can see how hearing it all the time could. It's a fun little song, and has enough depth to stand above the title track and \"Gayland\" at least, despite its similar almost total lack of real guitar riffs. Instead we basically just have galloping and some chord progressions under the chorus, and some bass antics (redolent of an overlarge ego, but it's not too obnoxious). Like on \"Invaders\", the mood and perspective switch, starting out slow and melancholy with the Indians' lament and then bursting into galloping speed with the soldiers running them down. I have to applaud Iron Maiden for not taking the bleeding heart route and dispensing heavy-handed moral judgment like some bands (Satan's \"Broken Treaties\" comes to mind), and that \"white man's guilt\" bullshit gets old quick. Iron Maiden make destroying Native American culture sound like fun (which it probably was). It's not the most artistically significant song Maiden have ever written, but it doesn't outstay its welcome and has at least enough substance to have some lasting merit beyond mindless entertainment. When it comes on, I don't skip it; that pretty much sums it up.\n\n\"Gangland\" on the other hand is so painful, they should have called it \"Gangbang\". For something supposedly about dangerous gang members slaughtering one another, it sounds about as dangerous as a booster shot. The gangs I imagine while listening to the song aren't Goodfellas or even Warriors; more like West Side Story. \"Funland\" would be another appropriate title for the song. The riffs are terrible, the melodies are repetitive as is the chorus, the slow section is one of the worst, most boring pieces of shit the band has ever written. The noodly bridge however is passable; Bruce's shriek of \"yeah, c'mon!\" before the guitar solo is downright cool...then it goes back to shit with the reprieve of the verse and final repetition of the chorus. The drums are really annoying too, and the thought of Clive Burr (who co-wrote the song with Smith) getting replaced with Nicko McBrain after this album gives me warm fuzzy feelings. His fills always seemed the equivalent of radio jingles to me, from the intro to \"Another Life\" to the beat that begins \"Prisoner\". I think if doctors were to do some serious research on this song, they would find that Clive's MS was the direct result of co-writing \"Gangland\". Maybe karma isn't such a silly idea after all. The song is under four minutes long, but it feels like an agonizing marathon of monotony. Think of the longest, most grueling run you've ever had in your life, whether towards a train, away from the police, or perhaps at a track meet at school; now, imagine running that again, but this time while waist-deep in liquid mozzarella. You fail to reach whatever goal you're running towards in time, and in fact find out you were going the wrong way all along. That is \"Gangland\".\n\nMaybe I'm writing from Planet X or something, but does it seem like too much coincidence that \"Total Eclipse\", the only song on here I've seen get unjustly panned with any regularity, is also the only one not drenched in gallons of nostalgia? Now, I can't speak for everyone who's ever heard the album and written something about it, but it seems reasonable to assume that a good percentage of metal fans got acquainted with this album through the original edition which excludes this track. Unencumbered by that intoxicating nostalgia, the bonus track gave Iron Maiden fans the rare opportunity to objectively evaluate a track from the sessions that brought them this highly-regarded album. Is it significant that without that nostalgia to guide them, a good many fans blunder right into the wrong conclusion? I can imagine an aging metalhead listening to The Number of the Beast in his living room, graying hair flailing as he headbangs furiously along with \"Gangland\". For a few minutes, it has transported him back to the days of his beer-soaked youth, when regular jobs were for losers and metal was a full-time lifestyle, rather than something relegated to evenings and weekends (preferably when no one is around). All of a sudden, \"Total Eclipse\" comes on; the headbanging ceases, and a frown creases the fan's face. \"What's this crap? Where's \"Hallowed Be Thy Name?\" He listens for a few more seconds, then hits the skip button in frustration and, recognizing \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\" with relief, resumes headbanging as before. Though many people have started getting into metal long after \"Total Eclipse\" became a staple bonus track on The Number of the Beast, that attitude towards it has been handed down to the younger generations (I bite the hand that feeds, of course). Now, that's not to say everyone who doesn't like the song is stupid, and stuck there in the middle of familiar friends, it's normal for a stranger to be left out. \"Total Eclipse\" is a slow, steady number with an emphasis on ominous atmosphere; it reminds me of \"Children of the Sea\", except the giant is wearing steamrollers like roller skates rather than boots for stomping. Compared to a radio jingle like \"Invaders\", it's fucking Chopin, as it's both less catchy and more mood-driven, a kind of song that requires a bit of attention to appreciate. I'm not claiming all Maiden fans are idiots or anything, but I do know that for an album that is so well-known and one that almost every metalhead has some nostalgic feelings for (yes, including me), \"Total Eclipse\" provides a chance to see a band we know so well anew; luckily, the song holds up quite well, even better than many of the supposed classics on the album. I like it.\n\nLast but certainly not least, we have \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\". Incensed fans who by now may have pegged me as pushing an iconoclastic agenda can put that to rest; when it comes to this song, I uphold the status quo. It's fucking amazing, easily one of the best Maiden have ever written. It hits fantastically upon many major metal themes simultaneously; death, freedom, and of course religion. I love the ambiguities it presents, proving that contrary to my initial condemnation Bruce-era Maiden aren't always obvious. Did the prisoner really commit the crime, or is he innocent? Does he really enter an afterlife, or is the dream of it just the last refuge of a man staring death and oblivion in the face? By extension, does the band believe in the former or the latter? Nothing is spelled out, all we have is that brief glimpse of a man's last moments, and the intense feelings that well up inside him: disbelief, terror, hope for an afterlife but at the same time a questioning of that hope (\"Tears flow but why am I crying/After all I'm not afraid of dying/Don't I believe that there never is an end?\"). The music reflects these feelings wonderfully, with the last half of the song being almost entirely instrumental, \"narrating\" in its way the execution, and actually, Burr's drumming is great on this track; I take back the mean stuff I said about him before. Sorry Clive! The scene the music sets is just as vivid without words. Perhaps more so. A perfect album closer; one of those songs you have to sit back and ponder after it's over, savoring the mood that lingers long after it closes. Would that it closed a perfect album.\n\nNostalgia is a funny thing; it's essentially just left-over good feelings and impressions from an earlier time in life, but old or not those feelings can still be strong enough to influence people in strange ways. In an almost religious experience, someone can recapture maudlin memories of a more innocent past through nostalgia, and the stronger that experience is, the stronger the reluctance to re-visit the cult object of that nostalgia with objective eyes, much like a religious person might mentally block themselves from logical evaluation of their belief, jealously guarding the subject of worship (\"faith\", they call it, and the same terms could be similarly applied to the attitude of the metal community towards certain classics). Haven't you ever heard someone casually dismiss an album (or movie, or book, or whatever) you've loved for years, and you get mad, not because they're necessarily wrong but because you can't muster a rational defense on the spot so you're secretly afraid they're right? The anger is blown all out of proportion as well, as if they'd insulted a close friend who recently died or something (to this day I still get pissed whenever people say bad things about Transformers: The Movie, wanna fight about it?). I think this is where those things people call \"guilty pleasures\" arise; to their modern standards the music is lacking, but the nostalgia still allows them to enjoy the music despite being more or less aware of that lack. Unfortunately, other people get equal but opposite perverted pleasure from slaughtering the sacred classic cows, often as messily as possible (I'm sure if you look hard enough you could turn up evidence of that, maybe even somewhere else on this very page). Whether at heart the crusaders of truth they claim themselves to be, or more akin to those nimrods who like to spoil the end of movies for a cheap laugh (SNAPEKILLSDUMBLEDORELOL), these individuals often blunder way off into exaggerated territory, as perhaps they're too wrapped up in gleeful mental images of frothing fanboys to worry about anything like doing an album justice. Both stances are immature, and counter-productive to approaching the album's true worth, despite whatever reactionary, exaggerated reviews might be written to \"balance the scales\" or some similar bullshit. Is truth some kind of paperclip you have to bend further than you want it to get it to retain the proper shape? Now, I'm hardly the first to give The Number of the Beast a moderate score, but I hope after reading this at least one or two of those people who feel anything less than 100% is slander or anything more than 0% is a travesty will think twice about writing such reactionary nonsense. A word to the wise: 99% of albums are going to fall between those scores. And this concludes the preachy portion of the review. \n\nIron Maiden are a band that writes great songs, not great albums; viewed as a whole, there's not nearly enough artistic depth to The Number of the Beast for it to be considered a masterpiece, despite the excellence of \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\". Entertainment is fine for what it is, but the album fails at even that on more than one significant occasion. Given Iron Maiden's previous and subsequent albums, not to mention the phenomenal closing track, this one leaves a lot to be desired. The final track is a must-hear, but even the best of the rest isn't worth more than an occasional listen. Even if you totally disagree with this review, I hope it least at encourages people to really scrutinize The Number of the Beast, and similar albums as well. Metal has too many sacred cows.\n",
        "\nI was a seven year old Catholic school boy when Number of the Beast came out. It was after seeing some seventh grader walking around wearing an Iron Maiden Number of the Beast tee on a dress down day when I was first exposed to this band. The next time I was perusing Tower Records, I went to look at all the Iron Maiden records and saw it again among the other ones as well. I was far from being a metalhead at this time but I was utterly fascinated at how heavy this band must have sounded like to go along with their awesomely metal looking cover art. Yes, this was the first real metal band I ever encountered, at least visually. I knew of this band even before I had heard of Black Sabbath. It would still be awhile before I was allowed to listen to the music behind the records. I think there are many who encountered Iron Maiden this way when they were very young. It was a true grabber. And so, what did this album finally sound like? It sounded like and still sounds like the embodiment of heavy metal. We think in visuals and when the term 'heavy metal' comes to mind, I think of Number of the Beast.\n\nWhat can be said about the album that hasn't been said already? There is no denying it is a classic. That's for damn certain. But is it their best? No, it is not but it's up there. Number of the Beast is more classic than it is the very best. It's the inauguration of an era. It's heavy as hell but it never blew my socks off quite like Judas Priest did. It's fast and has an adventurous zeal to it. This album like every other one they did was written and recorded to be played live in concert and that's another great plus with the album. I would have loved to have heard these songs played at their show. \n\nThe production on Number is an absolute dream in no small part due to producer/engineer Martin Birch who seemingly was a sixth member of the band in the studio. Every instrument is crisp and the Steve Harris' bass pervades with hard focus throughout every song. Adrian Smith and Dave Murray add punch of physicality in their playing. \n\nInvaders is the first track and it's trademark Maiden. It almost sounds like Ides of March at the beginning. The theme of battle is pretty cool and sets the table for everything else on the menu. As Bruce Dickinson's first song on an Iron Maiden record, it does well to bring him in with great command. Children of the Damned bears more than a striking resemblance to Black Sabbath's Children of the Sea with its acoustic intro and heroic atmosphere. Power metal never had it so good up until now. The Prisoner has a fabulous mid pace action with the drums. This song centers the album with its theme of fugitive psyche. I haven't had the privilage of seeing the band live but if I did, I would have hoped this was on the set list. While I loved the opening riff of 22 Acacia Avenue, the song is not a standout. The one small knock on alot of Iron Maiden albums is that they are slightly filler prone. I would say that this album is the least guilty of this but 22 Acacia Avenue and especially Gangland fill that quota on here although they are one of the better tracks in question in that regard. \n\nMy favorite thing about Iron Maiden is that their title tracks are almost always the best songs on their records. They seem to be in the middle of the albums and they always deliver the metal goods. It's thought they are the main course. When I look at the album covers, I can always put the song to the art. Number of the Beast is no exception. It's the best song on the album. Bruce Dickinson makes that awesome scream to launch the rest of the head banging glory that the song deserves. And then of course we have Run to the Hills which is the band's most famous song. The local radio stations where I live don't regularly play Iron Maiden but when they do, Run to the Hills gets the nod. I will say that it's a great song to play in the car but by no means is it even close to the best one by them. I think it has the right amount of length and catchiness that has made it the hit that it is. Hallowed Be Thy Name would probably be their second most well known song and probably their most venerable on the concert set list. It's another great classic that is a metal encore song if there ever was one. Bruce's crescendo that leads into the main part of the song is the most memorable. It never loses momentum and the guitars on here will stay in my memory for a long time. The influence on this one can be heard in many a thrash metal band to come. \n\nReflecting back on my heavy metal memories, this album will always stay with me. Those who don't appreciate this album were probably not around at the time when it made its debut or they just were oblivious to heavy metal in that period. Not only is there nostalgia here but there is replay value. Iron Maiden have the longest lasting influence in metal today and it would be a shame if you don't at least give it as many chances as you can to admire its spirit.\n",
        "\nThis album has been panned quite a bit by Maiden fans, citing lacklustre songs and poor vocals from Bruce Dickinson (A phrase I never thought I'd hear). Rarely any of the songs are ever included in the modern-day setlists, same as the next 3 albums, but does it really deserve to be shunned so much? Is it actually quite good?\n\nWell, on first impressions, not really. Tailgunner is not bad, but could be better. I was expecting a galloping headbanger like Aces High or Where Eagles Dare, but what I got instead was an odd beast, which was as Prog as can be, without actually Progressive at all. The riffs reek of Genesis or Yes, but in a very bland way. It is good, but nowhere near as good as I thought it could be. Holy Smoke is reeeeally fucking bad. Absolutely terrible. I forgot just how poor this song sounded until I listened to it again. Christ, it is bad. This is Pop Metal, lacklustre rock riffs, Maidenized. So generic, and bland. It basically consists of Bruce ranting over riffs which AC/DC rejected.\n\nNo Prayer for the Dying is actually a really fucking epic song, or it could've been. It is way too short, and shows oodles of potential, but it just slithers away until you've noticed it's gone and you think \"Fuck, that was quick, a bit TOO quick\". This should've been another Hallowed Be Thy Name-style sing-along. 7 minutes long and drenched in darkness, a true classic. But it's not. It really isn't. It's way too short and just makes you think how amazing it could have been. Public Enema Number One has a horrific title. Who actually thought that was a good title? This too is a great song, I really like it. Nothing can save it from that wretched title though. I don't even think I could put this in a Dream Setlist if I wanted to, because of that title. It's embarassing, but good nonetheless.\n\nNooooow we're talking! The air siren's back and in force! Bruce goes back to his high vocals on Fates Warning. This suffers from the same syndrome as No Prayer for The Dying. This should be 15 minutes long, and in the vein of Rime of The Ancient Mariner. Nonetheless, it is a really good song, which could be better. The Assassin isn't too bad, just quite boring to start with, but the Chorus is quite good. Once again, this doesn't sound like it should. It should be in the vein of The Trooper or something like that. But it isn't. It does get repetitive after a while though. Starts out boring, ends boring, with an interesting bit in the middle.\n\nRun Silent, Run Deep is actually really quite good. It restores us to the generic Maiden fare of old. You know, the filler tracks you never bothered about... Ganglands, Quest For Fire, Back In The Village. But on this album, sounds really good compared to the rest. It's nice to be comforted by familiarity once in a while. Hooks In You has cowbell. and a chorus that goes on forever, and is terribly \"alternative\" with Bruce does his boring \"spoken-word\" vocals.It had outstayed it's welcome by the second chorus, but continues to go on and on and on.\n\nThen it all picks up on the last two songs. Bring Your Daughter... To The Slaughter has taken a lot of stick over the years from the Maiden elite, citing it as being \"too popular\" due to appearing in A Nightmare on Elm Street. The stick got so bad that Maiden dropped it from their setlist, saying that the fans were bored by it. And it's a shame, as it is an amazing song, a true anthem and one of Maiden's best songs ever. Bruce's vocals are at a peak on this track, truly the best vocal performance he's ever done... on this album. This is the song where they take all the elements panned on this album (the \"Pop Metalness\", the odd vocals) and makes them work. It's a song where the songwriting truly shines out, they got it right on the money with this. Mother Russia is another highlight, where they finally realise their ambition of writing an epic song. This is epic, but as highlighted in other reviews, it pales in comparison to Maiden's other great epics such as Hallowed Be Thy Name and Children of The Damned. Nonetheless, it is still a great song, and the nods to traditional Russian music are a great touch.\n\nIn conclusion, this album is OK, a bit mediocre. The problems on this album are endless. Songs are either too long, outstaying their welcome or waaay too short. There should be 7 minute epics but there's not. It seems Steve said \"Right lads, on this album. every song should be under 4 and a half minutes long\" and then told them to go \"Let their hair down\" on Mother Russia, but not too much mind. Although i can see that maybe they wanted to distance themself from the Prog of Seventh Son, it seems that they just tried to capitalise on the success of that album's singles, and tried to keep up the momentum by trying to make every song a hit single, and failing miserably.\n\nThis album also has another big fat dog turd in the form of Bruce's vocals. They are terrible, I don't know what happened since Seventh Son but he just lost the inability to do any Clean vocals whatsoever, and adopted a strange voice, which make him sound like he has a chest infection. He also likes to do a lot of the songs in an odd spoken-word style, that doesn't really work. And although it works on Bring Your Daughter,,,, it fails practically everywhere else. Every other member is putting a hardly-groundbreaking yet commendable performance, but the vocals drags everything down. And this pisses me off, because it's the biggest reason why this record is so panned. There are songs which would work really well live today, now that Bruce has had his Lemsip and has his voice back, but because the album was panned, due to the vocals, they refuse to play any of it today.\n\nIf this album had better vocals and songs were allowed to flow past 4 and a half minutes, this would be in the high 90s in terms of rating. There is some songs which sound different from what they should, and epic tunes which should be twice their length, and if they WERE twice their length, this would be a masterpiece. Despite this, it is a not bad performance. There is some good tunes on this, but nothing too major (Bar the final 2 tracks) as well as a lot of filler material. You should probably put this near the bottom of your Maiden shopping list, but buy it anyway, if not for completion, but also due to the presence of a couple of a good songs.\n",
        "\nOne of the better of all those \u201cFirst 10 Years\u201d EPs that were all put out on 1990 and the last thing before Adrian Smith went along with Maiden\u2019s glory years, \u201cThe Clairvoyant\u201d is a collection of live songs that all were off the \u201cMaiden England\u201d concert, which as far as I\u2019m concerned the best live performance this band ever pulled off. The magic that put together Maiden\u2019s 2 greatest albums with Bruce at the helm is fully on display throughout this concert, free of all the needless ad lib nonsense and really sloppy shouting that Bruce would indulge in during his remaining time with the band after this, and loaded with great songs that the band doesn\u2019t seem to play much nowadays.\n\nCompared to the lackluster \u201cLive After Death\u201d, which for some strange reason gets to be re-released on DVD while the material on here is still stuck in out of print status, this is a sizable improvement in both the vocal department and in terms of instrumental performance. Although I\u2019m personally partial to Adrian Smith\u2019s playing, Dave Murray clearly steals the show here, particularly during the lead sections of \u201cThe Clairvoyant\u201d and \u201cStill Life\u201d, the latter of which sounds even better than the studio version with the added keyboard part. Steve Harris gets a little bit over zealous on the bass during some of the faster sections, Bruce shies away a little bit from some of the high notes on \u201cThe Prisoner\u201d, but this is basically as close to a flawless performance as this band has ever pulled off collectively. \n\nThe absolute climax of the EP occurs during \u201cInfinite Dreams\u201d, which is where everything just comes together for everyone. Bruce hits all of the high notes at full power, Adrian and Dave basically recreate the exact atmosphere that was on the studio version, and Nicko makes a great ruckus without missing a single beat. It\u2019s an all out spellbinding performance, especially considering that this is one of the most complex songs these guys had put together at this time, save maybe \u201cAlexander The Great\u201d.\n\nIf you\u2019re a real Iron Maiden fanatic then there\u2019s also a nice little 11 minute rant by Nicko, mostly dealing with how the tour was, in a fairly casual and slapstick fashion. If not, well there is always the option of dusting off that old, obsolete VCR of yours and trying to track down a second hand copy of the still out of print \u201cMaiden England\u201d video. But if you really want to do something constructive, get together with some friends and send letters demanding that this amazing concert be released in DVD format, preferably with some bonus features. Up the irons!!!\n",
        "\nI'm confused by all the praise this album receives on the internet since I haven't met a single person face to face who has had anything positive to say about this album. I'm a tremendous fan of Iron Maiden's early work and Bruce Dickinson's solo albums with Roy Z but nothing post Seventh Son has really done anything for me. This album is no exception and in fact I think this is a step in the absolute wrong direction. I'm not some death metal fan with no love for the classics of the genre. I\u2019m a follower of the NWOBHM first and foremost but I expect a band as influential and innovative as Maiden to sound that way, not to stagnate in mediocrity. \n\nThe first thing that really needs to be addressed is the production, I find it to be overly quiet and ineffectual. I'm all for having dynamics and not brick walling the music in the mastering process but this album sounds as if it wasn't mastered at all. I'm a bassist, Harris is a huge influence on me but he's a little high in the mix even for my taste. The music just doesn\u2019t have the raw power that you\u2019d expect from a band with three guitarists. I\u2019ve felt that since No Prayer for the Dying, Maiden\u2019s music has really taken a steep decline in the heaviness department, it just doesn\u2018t have that adrenaline inducing, galloping bottom end that it used to. I had hoped that bringing Adrian back while retaining Janick might beef up their sound but, as with the previous two albums, they\u2019re not really attempting anything that couldn\u2019t be achieved just as well with two guitar players and a little overdubbing\n\nI found the songwriting to be really artificial in parts, the riffs don't really flow into one another very well. It seems almost like the band took a bunch of riffs and tacked them together. It all sounds really forced; not the organic, from the heart sound of Beast or Killers. Another weakness in the songwriting in my opinion is that almost every chorus is the title of the song sung over and over, this lyrical repetition isn't uncommon on newer Maiden albums but given the more progressive (read: repetitious) nature of this album, it tends to wear down on the listener faster than before.\n\nThere aren't really any flaws in the vocals or musicianship that were immediately discernable, Bruce is still holding on to the title of \"Air Raid Siren\". Maiden is still a very formidable live act and have aged quite gracefully in that respect but they've suffered incredibly in the songwriting and lyrically departments. It\u2019s really upsetting to me because I wanted to enjoy this album, I don\u2019t find any pleasure in nitpicking through it\u2019s flaws. I understand this album is meant to be progressive and epic, I\u2019ve given it plenty of chances in numerous states of mind but this album just doesn\u2019t speak to me.\n\nI guess as a fan it's not my place to tell Maiden that they're going down the wrong path, they've certainly earned their place in heavy metal history and it would be foolish for me to try to sway them from their artistic vision but personally I would love nothing more than for Maiden to pull off their equivalent of Judas Priest's Painkiller. A crushingly heavy reinvention of their trademark sound that redefines them and takes them to new heights of musical complexity, speed and brutality. Such an album would certainly bring fans like myself back into the fold but judging from way things have been going since the reunion; this dream is never going to come true. Hopefully Bruce has some more albums with Roy Z up his sleeve.\n",
        "\nAnyone who has seen Iron Maiden live might agree that they're pretty much the best live band in the world. I saw them this year, and I don't think any other concert I've been to can top them; the energy, the bastards pretty much irradiate an aura of pure win wherever they go. You can feel the decades of experience on their shoulders, and the fact that it's Iron fucking Maiden. But, that was this year; and I was right there in the crowd, which makes me biased, I guess. Anyways! Here we have Live After Death, considered by some as one of the best live albums in the history of not only metal, but rock, or music, and sound itself in general. I have always believed that live albums should make you feel like you're right there, in the front row. So everything is very important; the instruments' mix, the crowd's loudness, and I just love when the band talks to the crowd. Live After Death does do all of that, the sound is top-notch at worst, and plain realistic 'HOLY SHIT EDDIE IS COMING TO GET ME' at best.\n\nIn 1985, the 'Irons were at the peak of their career, and this baby makes sure that you understand that. I almost shat myself the first time I listened to Churchill's Speech on my stereo and Aces High kicked in; but it's kinda disappointing, since they play it considerably slower than the original; 20bpms slower I'd say. I like live songs much better if they're sped-up, though their performance is pretty neat; though the slowness does make the guitar solos way less awesome. I have no complains at all on the set-list, since they even included Flight of Icarus, a classic that is somewhat forgotten. \n\nThe musicianship is (obviously) very, very good; it just wouldn't be Maiden otherwise! However, there are some mistakes, or at least 'failed experiments', like taking random harmonics away from songs which originally intended them that way (see: The guitar solo in Revelations). Aside from that, and the relative slowness in some of the songs' tempos; everything else is good. \n\nWhat I've noticed that gets criticized the most of Live After Death, though, is Bruce's voice. Personally, I think he sings better today than 25 years ago; and I like his vocals much more in Rock in Rio than here. But, even though his singing isn't as good as in the original studio versions, some exceptions, again, like Revelations, which is it's definitive version, because that part at the end \"...It is...you...!\" is so beautiful yet so brutal, fuck I just love this band. And The Trooper, which is a personal favorite, and I say to hell with everyone who says it's overplayed and overrated; that song is one of the best heavy metal anthems ever written. Back to Bruce's vocals, however, his singing itself is NOT bad, but he just can't pull off some of the trademark falsettos of stuff like Run to the Hills and The Number of the Beast; and instead Bruce opts for a very powerful mid-range shout full of vibrato. That's probably what holds this record the most; but you gotta love his little speaking between songs! \n\nOther highlights...Well, it's Iron fucking Maiden; everything is a goddamn highlight. But I do like stuff like Phantom of the Opera, with Bruce singing Di'Anno's lines. In fact, Disc 2 kicks ass, even if it's really small! You get all of their hidden gems, and Children of the Damned is just fucking great when played live, same with 22 Acacia Avenue, even though it's sad that Dave Murray changed the originally perfect solo, and improvised something over it. I also wonder, when will the day that they play both solos of Hallowed Be Thy Name just like in the original? I mean, they're not hard, but the Dave/Adrian combo always changes them.\n\nSo, it's not the best live album ever, but damn it's good. Yeah, some issues here and there, but at the end of the day it's just great. Though if you want the best live album ever (and you do), get Unleashed in the East by You-Know-Who. But don't let Live After Death away, it's up there with those Priest, Slayer, M\u00f6torhead, etc, records which manage to be better live than in the studio.\n",
        "\nAlong with albums such as Reign In Blood and Master Of Puppets, Number Of The Beast is one of *those* albums. You know, the ones that garner praise as if you could package it in shit and people would cut off their own nads to lick it off. As such, there is inevitably two groups of people, the fanboys, and the detractors. And as you should know, both groups usually have something right.\n\nThe new vocalist, and arguably the most famous member of the band, Bruce Dickinson, is the most overarching presence on this album, and consequentially, has the largest problems with his performance. When he is just doing the normal range of vocals, without soaring high notes, then he does very well, with a great lower register reminding one of certain other vocalists like Geoff Tate and Rob Halford. Unlike these two, however, he just can\u2019t do the high notes. Whenever he tries, it\u2019s obvious he\u2019s straining, and it comes out sounding as if he just put his balls in a vise to try to get the effect. As for the rest of the band-members, they really are just average. Even Harris\u2019 much-lauded bass just plods along, and this leaves it up to Dickinson to pull up the slack, except for a few notable examples.\n\nThroughout all of the songs, especially ones like 22 Accacia Avenue, there is still trace amounts of Iron Maidens punk era here. Normally that wouldn\u2019t be such a bad thing, but Dickinson just doesn\u2019t seem to fit during this. Also the album is really messy to listen to all the way through, as the conflicting styles often mark the inconsistent nature of Iron Maiden within albums. There\u2019s not as much filler as say, Powerslave, but there still is enough to jam up the flow. Also worth mention is how poorly the songs are grouped, with the truly metal Invaders followed by a semi-ballad, and Hallowed Be Thy Name being preceded by the worst song on the album.\n\nNow, the songs here can be grouped into three basic groups, the regular NWOBHM tracks, the singles, and the slower, emotional songs. Hailing from the first group, Invaders, the opener, has Dickinson giving forth both good and bad performances. Fortunately, the bad is short and merciful, rarely disrupting the flow of the song. The end result is good, with a chorus worthy of Maiden. A couple songs later, The Prisoner bursts on the scene. This is really where Maiden really starts proving they can pull out more than filler. It has an emotional chorus, with riffs that are energetic and bass that, surprisingly doesn\u2019t just plod along like almost every other song.\n\nAfter this though, it\u2019s just more filler. 22 Accacia Avenue is a good song, but lacks any real hooks to distinguish itself, unlike the previous song in this series (Charlotte The Harlot). Also, as mentioned before, you could just imagine hearing this on the S/T or Killers, and Dickinson doesn\u2019t fit. As for Gangland, this is the kind of song that gives haters their justification. It\u2019s generic, and just plods along at the same pace without a single real hook or memorable moment. So much so that it could even give AC/DC a run for their money.\n\nNow for the singles, everyone alive has heard them, they even rival Metallica for recognition. Of the two, Number Of The Beast is the better. Starting out with a spoken part similar to The Prisoner, it goes into the riff, and then a surprising thing happens, Dickinson gives out a scream worthy of his fame, and goes into a great performance, with a voice that really sounds like someone who has seen the devil. It also has a catchy chorus that, while repeated a little too often, deserves its recognition. The rest of the instruments though, are more generic, supporting Dickinson, and don\u2019t really come out on their own except for a quality solo.\n\nThe other single however, doesn\u2019t do so well. Run To The Hills, other than being catchy doesn\u2019t really have much else to add. You\u2019d think a song about the struggle of the Indians would have more emotion, but instead it just has Dickinson repeating the chorus ad nauseum, with another repeating part alternating in and out. And yes, it\u2019s just as boring as it sounds. Adding to that, Children Of The Damned is boring for nearly the same reason, with a repeat chorus (though the guitar parts vary some) that utterly fails to capture the emotion or power such a song should have.\n\nLuckily though, Beast ends on a much better note in that. Hallowed Be Thy Name shows off what Iron Maiden *could* do. It starts with an appropriately hallowed sounding guitar part, and goes into a deep and emotional performance by Dickinson. What is also surprising is that his vocals work well even when going into ranges where he\u2019d normally sound like he had a ten-foot dick up his ass, and it is indeed a beautiful thing to behold. The rest of the band members also give equally inspirational performances, with riffs that reinforce the sad nature of life portrayed by the non-repenting lyrics describing a criminal going to his death.\n\nWhile Number Of The Beast certainly has its filler, it also has its classics, it\u2019s a good way to get into the genre, and has some songs that will satisfy even jaded veterans who\u2019ve long left the classics behind. Just don\u2019t go into it expecting a masterpiece\n\nHighlights: Hallowed Be Thy Name, Number Of The Beast, The Prisoner\n",
        "\nThere\u2019s really no other way to describe the cover for this Maiden single except to say that it is the shit. A highly detailed image that recalls the Phantom of the Opera, it shows a very dramatic Eddie pose, a beautiful landscape that carries onto the back cover, and a bizarre, futuristic, pipe organ in Eddie\u2019s likeness. This kind of makes up for the fact that there aren\u2019t any exclusive studio tunes on this release.\n\nThe A-side track is none other than Maiden\u2019s biggest hit \u201cRun to the Hills\u201d live from the Long Beach Arena in \u201985. Like all their early live tunes with Dickinson, it kicks ass. Bruce sounds great, the guitar sound is sharper than on the studio version, and the track just ripples with the energy that comes from a live Maiden performance. The B-sides are a pair of live tracks recorded at the Hammersmith-Odeon in \u201984. First up is \u201cPhantom of the Opera,\u201d which is always a treat to hear with Bruce on vocals. I\u2019m not sure what it is, but every live recording of Maiden from the 80\u2019s slays. Youth perhaps, but whatever it is, it\u2019s the reason these tracks and Live After Death absolutely destroy later recordings like the Live at Downington and A Real Dead One. The solo bit on this track is particularly intense and Steve\u2019s bass tone is perfect. But anyway, after that scorcher is \u201cLosfer Words (Big \u2018Orra),\u201d the super-catchy instrumental from Powerslave. Once again, it sounds excellent; guitars, bass, and drums perfectly fusing to forge the tightest instrumental in Maiden\u2019s career. \n\nI\u2019m personally satisfied with the studio versions of these songs, but for those that enjoy Maiden\u2019s live output, these tracks are fantastic. And did I mention the cover art rules?\n",
        "\nNever let it be said that I do not admire the tenacity of Iron Maiden. Even when they\u2019re just releasing singles and EP\u2019s, they always smack a kickass pic on the cover. Featuring good ol\u2019 Edward flying a fighter jet, their Aces High single is yet another well-endowed release for collector\u2019s to go gaga over.\n\nSide A is of course the track \u201cAces High.\u201d One in a long, proud line of Maiden album openers, it\u2019s a NWOBHM classic. Personally I\u2019m more of a \u201cTwo Minutes to Midnight\u201d guy when it comes to Powerslave singles (review pending), but you can\u2019t keep a good song down, especially if it was penned by Steve Harris. But you\u2019re not buying this single for \u201cAces High\u201d (you should already have it); you\u2019re getting it for the B-sides. First up is \u201cKing of Twilight,\u201d originally by British psychedelic/progressive/space-rock pioneers Nektar. I\u2019m familiar with the band, but as of right now I\u2019ve never heard the original. Doesn\u2019t matter though, \u2018cause the Maiden version rules. Basically the Steve Harris & Nicko McBrain show, it slays that fucking Montrose cover from a few years back. Lastly, there\u2019s a live rendition of \u201cThe Number of the Beast.\u201d It\u2019s good, but live versions of that song are not hard to come by.\n\nGreat art and great songs, it\u2019s the complete package. Available in picture-disc for those who\u2019d rather look at it than spin it.\n",
        "\nAuthor's note: Yeah, this review turned out to be much longer and a little more pretentious than I had originally intended, so if you're looking for a review that succinctly describes the music and tells you whether or not you should go buy the album, well, there are plenty of others on the site. If you've already heard the album a million times and want some insight into why it's a classic (beyond \"it's, uh...really good, George!\"), I try to give some, so read on. Also, the penultimate paragraph contains generalizations for the sake of a point (and brevity), so all you types who like to find exceptions can keep them. Anyway, on with the review.\n\n\nIron Maiden. Iron Maiden! What hasn't been said about Iron Maiden? Easily the most well-known and important band of the NWOBHM movement, and consequently one of the most well-known and important bands in all of metal, their impact on the genre is so great that it's all but impossible to imagine it without them. The paltry few that came before, Judas Priest and Black Sabbath the best-known of those, could still be considered a part of rock & roll, and indeed today might still be if not for NWOBHM and Iron Maiden. To me, that particular movement with that particular band perched at its prow like a figurehead represent the birth of Heavy Fucking Metal; not just as an idea or tentative theory or passing trend, but as a full-fledged genre, an important subculture, a force to be reckoned with. \n\nAfter reading that last paragraph some of you may be wondering how I could give an album I recognize as being so important anything but the highest of scores; it's undeniable that they influenced a shitload of people (fans and bands alike), and left their permanent print on the genre so that it would be impossible to imagine metal without Iron Fucking Maiden. Even if a band sounds nothing like them, you can bet that band was aware of Iron Maiden, and so even the decision to not be like Iron Maiden is still influenced by them in a way. I mean, how in the hell did Iron Maiden do all that? What was so special about them? Obviously something has to be, as it's clearly more than just a case of being at the right place at the right time, though they certainly were. However, despite all that historical significance and subsequent influence, in an album review the album must be judged on its own merits and no others. For much of the album, Iron Maiden's genius shines through like a beacon, lighting metal's way to the future; but occasionally they clearly fall short of that. After all, they're only human, and as with all genre pioneers they were stumbling around in the dark; no one had done this before, so they had only their own mistakes to learn from. \n\nIron Maiden's brand of NWOBHM is at its best deadly serious and aggressive, eschewing rock's penchant for fun in favor of a dark, violent tone; still, the band takes a more musically sophisticated approach to composition, which separates them from their peers. Steve Harris apparently composed the bass parts first and then worked the riffs up around them, which may contribute to the band's unorthodox, bouncy sound, even when compared to similar bands like Diamond Head or Angel Witch. Also, at times the bass and guitars play close three-part harmonies, as with the opening melody on the title track; I think it's fair to say Iron Maiden invented or at least popularized the oft-imitated NWOBHM dual-guitar lead (the idea of counterpoint in a metal context? Quite possibly). It's certainly true I've never heard anything quite like that bit of instrumental magic in \"Phantom of the Opera\", and I can only imagine how it must've dropped jaws back then. Really, though, what I get from Iron Maiden is a kind of violence that I haven't heard in the metal that came before them. Sure, Black Sabbath were morose, but to me it seems they sang more about violence and evil than actually epitomized it themselves; the immortal \"Black Sabbath\" is from the perspective of someone being chased by that ominous figure in black, rather than the other way around. Judas Priest on the other hand were violent, sure, but songs like \"Genocide\" or \"The Ripper\" are still slick and clean, as if you're watching a high-budget movie version of violence rather than experiencing it yourself. Iron Maiden, however, put you right there in the rough, gritty midst of things with songs like \"Prowler\". Thematically speaking it's practically identical to \"The Ripper\", but compare the lyrics: both are from the perspective of their respective murderous protagonists, but while \"The Ripper\" is narrated in a fairly straightforward, almost gentlemanly manner, \"Prowler\" is told using barely coherent stream-of-consciousness rambling, as if you're inside the prowler's head and hearing his repulsive thoughts as he's stalking his victim (\"Got me feeling myself and reeling around\"), with a much more chilling result. The lead guitars and bass build on the riffs in classic Iron Maiden fashion, practically never staying still; with so many parts going on at once, it lends the song the illusion of barely-controlled chaos which again serves to heighten that violent and gritty tone. Overall, \"Prowler\" is a quintessential Di'Anno-era song, one of my all-time favorites from the band. The title track is also in this vein, and it's fucking awesome too. The way the main melody builds up with the first guitar entering, then the second, and finally the bass completing it is just fantastic. The chorus is a little disconcertingly upbeat, but it's fun and doesn't ruin the atmosphere, so whatever. I'm going to group the tracks based on similarity rather than album order, so bear with me.\n\nUnfortunately \"Sanctuary\" is nowhere near as good; it's an upbeat, forgettable rock song with a mediocre main riff made all the worse through extreme over-repetition. Some instrumental parts partially mitigate its sucking, but frankly it displays pretty much none of the elements that make the previous songs so good. It's listenable, but barely. Guess it figures it was a single. And I know it wasn't on the original album, but it has appeared as track 2 on Iron Maiden for over ten years now, so I think it might as well be considered an official part of it (if you're really anal about it not counting, pretend I scored the album higher). \"Running Free\" is rockish and banal too, though better than \"Sanctuary\". Yeah, it's the other single. It has some cool dual-guitar leads, and a nice middle section, but that main riff is pretty fucking annoying (not as bad as the one in \"Sanctuary\", though). These two tracks definitely drag the album down, not because they're incredibly awful, but because they're common, mundane, mortal. On an album like this, they simply don't belong.\n\n\"Remember Tomorrow\" is amazing; a slow, haunting ballad that occasionally bursts into heaviness during the chorus, and eventually explodes into a fast, upbeat section which totally clashes with the previous mood. However, that dissidence is calculated, and the upbeat mood descends by degrees back towards a final collapse into the morose, resigned, almost doomy atmosphere of the initial sections. It's a little crude, but definitely effective. \"The all-seeing eye flickers above us,\" that bit is fucking chilling. This song also illustrates one aspect in which the Di'Anno era is far superior to the Dickinson era; read the lyrics, you won't have much of a fucking idea about what's going on. Vague and dreamlike events are described and statements are made in an almost impressionistic manner, but it leaves their interpretation more or less up to the imagination; Dickinsonian lyrics however too often read like book reports, with as many factoids as possible crammed into the allotted time. If only they'd written more songs like \"Children of the Damned\" than \"Alexander the Great\" with Brucey Bruce! \"Strange World\" is also somewhat in this vein, except instead of a power ballad it's just a plain ol' ballad. Still, it crafts a strong atmosphere not unlike the soft parts in \"Remember Tomorrow\", except less dark and more languid and floating. Di'Anno here shows us a rare glimpse of his softer side, singing serenely of what seems to be a dreamworld or perhaps a calm drug trip. The undertones however are rather darker, with the implication in the lyrics being that the protagonist is escaping the shit of his real life within his mind, reminding me somewhat of \"Beyond the Realms of Death\", but from a different perspective.\n\n\"Transylvania\" is the first of the signature Iron Maiden instrumentals, and it's quite good. Harris hops around on his bass quite a bit, and the dual-guitar parts are excellent, the solos too. The problem with this one, though, is that I really think it would've sounded better as a song. While I'm certainly no songwriter, I can easily imagine Di'Anno singing over top of certain parts, and why not? He's a great singer, seems a rather odd choice to not include him where he could easily fit. On \"The Ides of March\" from their next album it wouldn't make sense to include him as it's under two minutes long, just a quick sketch, but \"Transylvania\" is over four. Oh well, it's still good. \"Charlotte the Harlot\" is rather upbeat, but much more complex than \"Sanctuary\" or \"Running Free\". It's fun, though a little weak at first; still, the dark interlude and subsequent high-octane buildup back to the main theme are fantastic. I'd rate \"Transylvania\" and \"Charlotte the Harlot\" in the middle of the pack for this album; quite good, but not quite great. \n\n\"Phantom of the Opera\" is a fucking classic and deserving of said status. No two ways about it, and anyone who tells you different is a liar or a fool. The aggressive, unsettling mood of the verses and chorus serves to build up to the sweeping, epic bridge which is, simply put, one of the finest moments in all of metal. \n\n\nHeavy metal has never been about trying to express great truths through precise logic or methodical argumentation; rather, it attacks these truths head-on, on a visceral emotional level. Blunt force trauma, rather than surgical strikes. The genre doesn't seek through years of education or meditation to lay these truths bare for our inspection by translating them into a language everyone can understand; rather, the musicians just transmute their deep emotional responses directly into music, without often letting pesky left-brain interference seep in. This is why most of the great metal singers are far from talented in a classical sense; could you imagine Dio, Halford, Dickinson, or Di'Anno singing opera? Certainly not, as they go for a raw, emotional approach, as had been common in rock & roll for decades. Compare that to highly regimented, disciplined composers of the past, like JS Bach; his fugues are practically mathematical equations, where you plug in a melody or two and extrapolate them and their permutations to their logical conclusions. The beauty is in the symmetry, like a balanced checkbook or a perfect sphere; a left-brained, Apollonian ideal, with a result that can be analyzed and dissected without losing its essential character. My dad for example loved taking out the sheet music for The Well-Tempered Clavier and going through the fugues, following all the different voices with multicolored markers, cataloging the variations on the melodies, not to mention a whole host of other studies. If you tried something like that with metal, it would end laughably; compared on paper to Bach's counterpoint, the counterpoint of \"Phantom of the Opera\" or even some ultra-techwank metal band seems child's play. Of course it bears remembering that the harpsichord is an instrument almost wholly lacking dynamics and finesse which perhaps forced Bach to take counterpoint further than he would have otherwise (the organ suffers from similar problems, though not as pronounced), but that's not all there is to it. And just look at the sheer volume of Bach's compositions; it's staggering under any light, and when compared to how much quality material even the best of metal bands create over the course of their careers, the disparity becomes almost farcical. Clearly metal is of the Dionysian sort, and though the bands may assail Truth with hot passion, the light that burns bright burns fast. Such passion is unsustainable in the long run, for the vast majority. \n\nThus one of the great downfalls of metal is that many are unsatisfied with this, and seek to become something more Apollonian; to \"intellectualize\" metal, with the aim perhaps of being respected by their professors, admired in aristocratic society, becoming something logical and clean and objectively defensible and devoid of that nasty honest human sentiment that the irony-obsessed modern culture so loves to mock. In a sense, these misguided metalheads just want to have their cake and eat it too; metal cannot change so drastically without giving up its essential character. It is, at its core, modern folk music; music by metalheads for metalheads, most often composed by musicians without formal training and appreciated on a deep emotional level by those who are not completely at home in mainstream modern society. For some, metal is cathartic; for others, it is a call to action; and it's probably many more things to many more metalheads as well. Regardless, a unique subculture of sorts has sprung up around it. Can you imagine well-groomed ladies and gentlemen wearing evening gowns and tuxedos sitting politely in a concert hall listening to \"Theme and Variations on Iron Maiden's 'Hallowed Be Thy Name'\" as performed by the New York Philharmonic? Of course not; the mere thought is ludicrous. Jazz has already partially made that transition, but I cannot see metal going from hot to cool and surviving. That passion and violent energy are a part of its essential character; symbol-laden though the genre may be, it is basically a gut-level negative response to modern existence, and the morose realization that there are few alternatives, if any. That's where I believe Iron Maiden and their NWOBHM brethren were important; Black Sabbath perceived this darkness, this bleak but unalterable truth of reality, Judas Priest developed it a step further: what is \"Beyond the Realms of Death\", if not the epitome of what I've been talking about? If they are the mother and father, the first of the family to settle in a new country, then the NWOBHM bands are their children, the first raised with metal as their first language. These children possessed a youthful energy, something naive yet cynical, jaded yet hopeful, that I just don't detect in the bands that came before (at least not to the same degree); and this was a new component that is now essential to the overall character of metal. While certainly not the final step in the coalescing of the genre's defining traits, it was certainly a crucial step. Perhaps the most crucial of all. \n\nThat is one reason I am incredibly annoyed whenever I see people pointing out any kind of Iron Maiden influence in a later band as something significant and negative, as if every album that fails to reinvent the genre is somehow inferior. This is, of course, ridiculous; am I any less of a reviewer, because I write in English and not a language of my own invention? Though pioneering bands are obviously extremely important to the development of any genre, at the risk of over-generalization I will say that they rarely, if ever, exhibit the best their respective genres have to offer. After all, as pioneers they don't have the benefit of hindsight, and must explore by groping in the dark; Black Sabbath, Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Manowar, and many other such bands write great songs, but have far from perfect track records even on their best albums. Still, these bands are not mere historical curiosities on the path to progression either, as if they were steam trains or Model T Fords that have served their purposes and now belong in a museum; this attitude is just as odious as the reverse. Great art does not age poorly, and that is exactly what songs like \"Phantom of the Opera\" and \"Remember Tomorrow\" are. Of course the music of Iron Maiden is also more developed than that of their predecessors, but these advancements are incidental (as are all truly great advancements in technique). They simply sought to express themselves as best they could, and as they found the tools at their disposal lacking, they had to invent some new ones or new ways to use old ones. It is not the tools themselves or their invention that ultimately deserve the praise, but rather the creations that made the best use of them.\n",
        "\nAh, Maiden\u2019s \u201cFlight of Icarus\u201d picture-disc. Nothing quite says \u201cheavy metal\u201d like the image a winged Eddie torching the nude Greek legend with his flamethrower, eh? However, due to the lack of really exclusive material, this one is really only for those that collect (or big fans of the cover art\u2026).\n\n\u201cFlight of Icarus\u201d is one of the more memorable tracks off of Maiden\u2019s classic Piece of Mind album, a release relatively full of memorable tracks. Sort of a loose adaptation of the Icarus story, it\u2019s nonetheless a strong romp through Maiden\u2019s legendary songwriting and shows the band at a very solid point in their career. Awesome.\n\nThe B-side, also known as \u201cthe entire reason to even pick up one of these Maiden singles,\u201d is a new studio rendition of the Montrose song \u201cI\u2019ve Got the Fire,\u201d which they\u2019d performed live in the past (it was on the \u201cSanctuary\u201d EP remember?). This version is better, as Bruce Dickinson mans the vocal duties and the production is album quality. But yeah, it\u2019s still a Montrose song. Remember when they covered \u201cCross Eyed Mary?\u201d Now that was a song worth covering.\n\nFor the Maiden completionist who has everything (well, except for this obviously), it\u2019s another required purchase. But as for us less-than-hardcore fans, we can do without the Montrose cover.\n",
        "\nThe crown jewel in this EP is track numero uno, \u201cSanctuary.\u201d One of Maiden\u2019s earlier tracks and a staple in their live shows, it\u2019s become a bit of a rarity having never appeared on a studio album (I think some versions of the Iron Maiden LP have it, but I\u2019ve never seen \u2018em). A short, punchy rocker like this would have fit nicely on their first album, but it fits pretty nice here too. Second up on the studio side is \u201cProwler,\u201d which is of course the lead cut off their debut LP. A bit darker in nature than \u201cSanctuary,\u201d its opening riff is the single coolest use of the wah-pedal in heavy metal. The chorus is classic, while the pick-up during the bridge is just as climactic. It\u2019s not nearly as rare of a track, but it\u2019s a hell of a lot cooler.\n\nOn to side two, we find a pair of live tracks. Once again, things kick off with my personal favorite Di\u2019anno-era Maiden tune, \u201cDrifter.\u201d In fact, I\u2019m fairly positive that this is the same live recording of the song as the one featured as the B-side of the \u201cWomen in Uniform\u201d single. Still, it warms my heart to see that the band were as fond of this song as I am. More exclusively for this EP is its fourth and final track, \u201cI\u2019ve Got The Fire.\u201d A Montrose cover from what I understand, it\u2019s a pretty energetic tune as performed here.\n\nFeaturing a pair of exclusive tracks and a nasty cover rendition of Eddie knifing an older woman (Margaret Thatcher?) in a hybrid style of their first two album covers, this is a must-have.\n",
        "\nIf the local record stores that you frequent are anything like the ones around where I live, you\u2019ve probably come across a number of single/EP releases from Iron Maiden. Featuring unique cover art and a variety of rare bonus tracks along with their (sometimes) hefty price tag, picking the one that\u2019s right for you might seem difficult. Not to fear! I\u2019ve gotten my hands on a few of them myself and out of the graciousness of my own heart, will be reviewing them for your informational purposes.\n\nFirst up is the \u201cWomen in Uniform\u201d single. One of the more historically important EPs for Maiden, their cover of the Skyhooks\u2019 \u201cWomen in Uniform\u201d was one of their early hits in the UK, though the track never made a studio album. Rendered with the bass heavy, harmonized guitar sound that was Maiden\u2019s trademark, only the super-catchy chorus gives the impression that this track was written by anybody else but Iron Fucking Maiden. I\u2019ve never been particularly fond of the track (reminds me of \u201cRunning Free\u201d I guess), but here it is in all its glory for those that dig it.\n\nThe back side of this EP features, as many of these singles do, an exclusive pair of live tracks. This single sports an especially attractive pair that, to me, is much more valuable than the main track. First up is \u201cDrifter,\u201d my personal favorite Paul Di\u2019anno-era Maiden track, from the very end of the Killers LP. Paul sounds just a little off on this version, but he leads a nice crowd-participation/bridge sequence after a particularly fine guitar solo. The other song is the epic \u201cPhantom of the Opera,\u201d arguably their debut LP\u2019s best track. This version is pretty tight as well, showing off just how good a drummer Clive Burr was. The Murray/Stratton lead bit is pretty sweet too.\n\nOnce again, Maiden completists should have \u201cWomen in Uniform,\u201d but the real treasure is the live tracks. Since the cover art is just a variation of their debut cover (on the German edition anyway, turns out the UK version has better cover art and the song \u201cInvasion\u201d in place of \u201cDrifter), it\u2019s not really a factor for this release.\n",
        "\nSo what we have here is Iron Maiden\u2019s third studio album, \u201cNumber Of The Beast.\u201d Yeah, you seem to have seen the name of this album right at the top or its whereabouts in every list concerning heavy metal\u2019s greatest album? Or whenever you asked a Maiden fan their favorite album chances are that more than just a handful of them must have said this album? This is exactly what has happened to me a ton of times as well. What is so great about this album eludes me even after hundreds of listens.\n\n\u201cNumber Of The Beast\u201d is an album that is a mixture of good, average and weak songs, most of which occupy the last two of the three sections I just mentioned. This was the first album that had Bruce on the vocals (the only reason me and probably a hundred others still stick to this band).\n\nThe album consists of tracks like \u201cThe Prisoner\u201d and \u201c22 Acacia Avenue\u201d which are the rare good tracks on the album. These are memorable in their own ways, where the band clicks together wonderfully well encompassing good riffs, vocals and solos. Except for another track that I will mention later in the review these are pretty much the only good tracks here. The former of these tracks have a cool spoken intro while the next has one of Maiden\u2019s best riffs, a good solo and equally good vocals.\n\nTwo tracks, which are \u201cRun To The Hills\u201d, and the title track irritate me to this date. It\u2019s not that these tracks are weak but it\u2019s the extremely high standard at which the fans of the band hold them which irritates me. Hang me for saying this but \u201cRun To The Hills\u201d is nothing more than a catchy karaoke song that one expects to here at clubs or parties. \u201cNumber Of The Beast\u201d is another track that eludes my logic of why this track is so great. Yes, the chilling spoken intro followed by Bruce\u2019s scream is one of the best moments in heavy metal history but that\u2019s about it, here is where the \u201cgreatness\u201d of the track ends. Mind you this track is not weak by any standard what so ever but is rather a better than average heavy metal track.\n\nThe tracks, \u201cInvaders\u201d, \u201cGangland\u201d, and \u201cChildren Of The Damned\u201d are horrible right from the word go. The latter of these tracks have a slow intro and is a decent \u201csort of ballad\u201d track where everything is going average or just above average for the band except for the chorus that is nothing short of horrendous, once again Maiden in their attempt to raise the tempo of the slow track ruin the atmosphere they managed to create with the listener. This is the first time the band did this (ruin the track by raising the tempo) but more often than not, the band kept on doing this even later in their career. Also Bruce sounds bad on these tracks, and once the only respectable force of the band cannot deliver, you know that the band is going nowhere but down.\n\nThe gem on this album is \u201cHallowed Be Thy Name\u201d. Everything and I mean everything on this track is great, right from the intro, to the ending. Right from the lyrics, to the vocals straight to the guitar solos (which for once do not sound repetitive) this song is nothing less then perfect.\n\n\u201cTears they flow but why am I crying \nAfter all I am not afraid of dying \nDon't I believe that there is never an end \nAs the guards march me out to the courtyard \nSomebody calls from a cell \"God be with you\" \nIf there's a God then why has he let me go? \nAs I walk all my life drifts before me \nAnd though the end is near I'm not sorry \nCatch my soul, it's willing to fly away \nMark my words please believe my soul lives on \nDon't worry now that I have gone \nI've gone beyond to see the truth \nWhen you know that your time is close at hand \nmaybe then you'll begin to understand \nLife down there is just a strange illusion\u201d\n\nLyrics like these, which I just mentioned, are from the track \u201cHallowed Be Thy Name\u201d and show the maturity of this band. These lyrics standout and for once Steve Harris does a job that does not pull the whole band down.\n\nAn important thing that annoys me throughout this album is the bass. It is extremely weak and that signature galloping bass line has been taken a wee bit to seriously by Mr. Harris because most of the bass lined in his career, with this album being no exception, sounding similar. With bass playing a major role in heavy metal band and if the bass itself sounds weak, no such album can be classified as one of the world\u2019s best ever.\n\nSo there you have it. Good moments (the intro to Children Of The Damned, the creepy intro, scream and chorus of the album\u2019s title track), but lack of good tracks (with the exception of the iconic \u201cHallowed Be Thy Name\u201d). Now if the major proportion of tracks in an album fall under the category of \u201cweak\u201d, \u201caverage\u201d or \u201cslightly better than average\u201d, enlighten me as to how an album can be regarded one of the best heavy metal album ever made? This album is overrated and is far away from being the greatest heavy metal album ever made, hell I don\u2019t find this Maiden\u2019s best work either! So if there any chance that you are new to metal and have not listened to this album (yeah, I know chances of that are extremely slim) and are expecting as great an album as you\u2019ve heard and read at innumerable places then my friend, you\u2019ll be highly let down.\n\n\u201cRun to the hills,\nRun for your lives \u2026.\u201d\n\n(Revised And Redone)\n",
        "\nExpectations were high before the release of \u201cBrave New World\u201d. First of all, because Bruce Dickinson returned to the band and many people wanted to see if he was able to transform the band into the heavy metal machine that it once was. Adrian Smith also returned, forming a trio of guitarists together with David Murray and Janick Gers. In the end, \u201cBrave New World\u201d turned out to be a fascinating album, much better than anything the band released since \u201cSeventh Son of a Seventh Son\u201d. Allow me to explain why...\n\nFirst of all, in a compositional level, all the songs are fantastic. Really. It's like the band spent lots and lots of time composing the record. They are extremely varied, from straight-forward, catchy tunes, like the opener, to more progressive, complex epics like \u201cDream of Mirrors\u201d. There are lots of mellow, soft parts within the songs and they all sound amazingly well, inspired and heartfelt (check out the beautiful \u201cBlood Brothers\u201d). There's also an inclusion of some keyboard lines here and there, mainly during that afore mentioned calm parts, and that really gives an amazing (and special) atmosphere to the album.\n\nThis atmosphere is also highlighted because of the excellent production, which is reminiscent of the one on \u201cSeventh Son of a Seventh Son\u201d. Everything is audible, with the vocals assuming the main role; the bass is always there to give an extra groove to the songs and the guitars sound awesome, blending perfectly with the keyboards. The drums are extremely well mixed too, finally we can hear the bass drums of Mr. Nicko McBrain, who seems to get better over the time, since his performance here is very very good, not overplaying anything yet delivering a relatively technical performance. His tone is great too, in my opinion.\n\nBruce Dickinson's amazing vocal performance is another essential ingredient of \u201cBrave New World\u201d, his screams and wails are reminiscent of the band's past efforts, and that's saying something. He doesn't rasp anymore, like he did on \u201cFear of the Dark\u201d and thank God for that! He also brought a lot of energy to the band, a thing that everyone can notice by hearing one or two songs of \u201cVirtual XI\u201d and then listening to \u201cWicker Man\u201d or \u201cGhost of the Navigator\u201d. Really, he is essential to Iron Maiden.\n\nSo, there's lots of highlights here and, most of all, there's NO FILLERS, which is something remarkable, since Iron Maiden is a band that can't deliver records without fillers (\u201cPowerslave\u201d, my favourite album ever, being a notable exception). The journey begins with \u201cWicker Man\u201d, an energic track, featuring a great guitar performance. Its chorus is also anthemic (\u201cYour time will cooooome!!\u201d); in fact, all the songs are pretty catchy, which is a plus. \u201cGhost of the Navigator\u201d is another highlight, I just love the amazing, soft beginning and how the song then turns into a relatively fast heavy metal number... great! One of the best songs of the bunch.\n\nThen, there's the title track, another great song, beginning, again, calmly, evolving later to heavier parts, where Bruce screams the catchy chorus. \u201cBlood Brothers\u201d is another favourite, a soft song with awesome keyboard melodies. \u201cThe Mercenary\u201d is faster and more aggressive, leading the way to \u201cDream of Mirrors\u201d, a song composed during the \u201cVirtual XI\u201d sessions, which absolutely kicks ass. Great great epic. \u201cThe Fallen Angel\u201d is another straight-forward rocker, a bit weak but worth listening. The record ends with three long songs, the first one being \u201cNomad\u201d, a song that I don't like that much (I can't get into it), \u201cOut of the Silent Planet\u201d,a decent tune, a bit overlong, and \u201cThe Thin Line Between Love and Hate\u201d, this one being an excellent closer.\n\nSo, looking to \u201cDance of Death\u201d and \u201cA Matter of Life and Death\u201d, the two albums that were released by the band after this one, I conclude that \u201cBrave New World\u201d somewhat mixes the simple structures of the majority of the songs on \u201cDance of Death\u201d with the exaggerated complexity of \u201cA Matter of Life and Death\u201d... And guess what, in the end, \u201cBrave New World\u201d is much better than those two records. It loses a bit of power near the end (\u201cFallen Angel\u201d, \u201cNomad\u201d and \u201cOut of the Silent Planet\u201d are a bit weak, unfortunately) but it still is a great album, one of the most melodic records Iron Maiden ever recorded. Better than the majority of the 80's catalogue of the band? Hmm... Am I blaspheming if I say so?\n\nBest Moments of the CD:\n-the ending of \u201cWicker Man\u201d.\n-the crescendo of \u201cGhost of the Navigator\u201d.\n-the part of \u201cBlood Brothers\u201d where a beautiful keyboard riff picks up.\n-the beginning of \u201cDream of Mirrors\u201d.\n",
        "\nAfter the absolute masterpiece that \u201cPowerslave\u201d was, expectations were high for the new Iron Maiden album. Unfortunately \u201cSomewhere in Time\u201d isn't as good as its predecessor; however, it is a fine heavy/power metal album, and why?\n\nFirst of all, I have to praise the new direction the band took with this record. They just didn't tried to create a \u201cPowerslave part II\u201d, they incorporated new elements to the band's sound, the most important of them being the use of guitar synths; they gave a fresh and new atmosphere to the record, and songs like \u201cAlexander the Great\u201d benefit one hell of a lot with them. The production is also rather different; the guitars don't sound so sharp anymore, nor does the drums; the vocals are definitely highlighted by the production, the same thing with the synths. The bass is a bit more buried under the guitars than on previous releases, but after all it still is audible and tasteful.\n\nAnother key element of \u201cSomewhere in Time\u201d is the fast instrumentation; Maiden never played so fast, believe me, and that's why this album carries a strong power metal vibe too. The drumming is almost thrashy sometimes (\u201cDej\u00e1 Vu\u201d), with Nicko McBrain delivering another great performance again, technical yet not overplaying anything... One of my favourite drummers, that's for sure!\n\nAdrian Smith is another important musician on \u201cSomewhere in Time\u201d, mainly because of all the songs he composed (he penned the majority of the songs, together with Steve Harris or alone). Unfortunately, because of his huge contribution, Bruce Dickinson wasn't allowed to write anything for this record, which is a shame, since the band owes him songs like \u201cRevelations\u201d and, most of all, the title track of \u201cPowerslave\u201d. Fortunately, he wrote some songs on the sucessor of \u201cSomewhere in Time\u201d, the acclaimed (and widely overrated) \u201cSeventh Son of a Seventh Son\u201d.\n\nAnyways, highlights? There are some really great songs here and some pretty average, the latter ones bringing the album down and harming the whole listening experience quite badly. \u201cCaught Somewhere in Time\u201d is one of the best songs here, absolutely dominated by some intricate soloing and a very nice vocal performance by Dickinson. He was in a really good shape during the recording of this piece, just listen to him screaming \u201cCaught somewheere in tiiiiiiiiiiiimee!\u201d... It's truly amazing, I even dare to say that his performance here is better than on \u201cPowerslave\u201d and that's saying something! \u201cWasted Years\u201d is another great song, catchy as hell and in the same vein as \u201c2 Minutes to Midnight\u201d or \u201cFlight of Icarus\u201d; a rather commercial tune but still amazing. It also features a very nice beginning (Mustaine apparently loves it, since he ripped it off \u2013 just listen to \u201cWashington is Next!\u201d). \n\nThe best of the bunch is, however, \u201cAlexander the fuckin' Great\u201d and what a song, ladies and gents!! It sounds like \u201cRime of the Ancient Mariner\u201d combined with the epic historical themes that made \u201cPiece of Mind\u201d what it is! Just take a time and listen to that masterpiece, it deserves some listens for you to fully understand its greatness! Absolutely gorgeous song!\n\nWith the fanboy mode turned to \u201cOFF\u201d, I'll now speak about the low points of this record. \u201cStranger in a Strange Land\u201d is one of them, not a horrible song but it does absolutely nothing to make this album better. It's midpaced and features a catchy chorus, but it isn't a song that you'll enjoy that much, that's for sure. At least is better than \u201cQuest for Fire\u201d... \u201cDe J\u00e1 Vu\u201d sounds also really forced, despite the thrashy feel it carries. An uninspired song, to say the least. \u201cThe Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner\u201d and \u201cHeaven Can Wait\u201d are both decent, though. I reallly like the chorus of both, but, again, they do nothing to make this album better. Ah, and \u201cSea of Madness\u201d has a nice beginning and breakdown, but it is unfortunately another average number,\n\nSo, with all those average tracks in, the listening experience of \u201cSomewhere in Time\u201d is far from perfect. Nevertheless, there are some great bits here, songs like \u201cAlexander the Great\u201d stand out as absolutely fantastic, so this record is worth listening because of them. Anyway, despite not being the best Maiden album, I recommend this piece to power metal and also \u201cfast heavy metal\u201d fans. And the performances of the musicians are also quite technical at times, so that's another plus. A good album, all in all, better than \u201cPiece of Mind\u201d and \u201cNumber of the Beast\u201d and worse than \u201cPowerslave\u201d and \u201cSeventh Son of a Seventh Son\u201d.\n\nBest Moments of the CD:\n-The beginning and solo section of \u201cCaught Somewhere in Time\u201d.\n-The chorus of \u201cWasted Years\u201d.\n-The intro and middle section of \u201cAlexander the Great\u201d.\n\n\nConcluding: \"ALEXANDER THE GREEEEEEEEAT!\" - that's all you need to hear if you want to check this album out.\n",
        "\nAfter the sucess of \u201cThe Number of the Beast\u201d, Iron Maiden released the acclaimed \u201cPiece of Mind\u201d. And while it is a good album, it suffers from the same problem as its predecessor: the existence of too many fillers. The album released after this one, \u201cPowerslave\u201d, solved this problem, as it probably is the only Maiden record 100% filler-free.\n\nAnyways, this record shows Maiden adopting more epic lyrical subjects, with \u201cFlight of Icarus\u201d speaking about greek mythology, \u201cThe Trooper\u201d about some battle between Russia and England (I love History, but I really can't remember the name of the battle now, damn) and \u201cDie with your Boots On\u201d about the prophecies of Nostradamus. Iron Maiden continued writing this type of songs later on with songs like \u201cPowerslave\u201d, \u201cRime of the Ancient Mariner\u201d, \u201cStranger in a Strange Land\u201d or \u201cSeventh Son of a Seventh Son\u201d. This epic feel that many tunes share and the fast, melodic guitar work, give Maiden a more power metal (or proto-power metal) sound, \u201cPiece of Mind\u201d being arguably the first of many power metal-ish albums the band recorded. Gone are the punk influences that made the debut, \u201cKillers\u201d and parts of \u201cThe Number of the Beast\u201d what they are.\n\nAnother key factor of \u201cPiece of Mind\u201d is the presence of the excellent Nicko McBrain, a drummer that while not trying to surprise the listener every time with some technical fills, still sounds great. \u201cWhere Eagles Dare\u201d is absolutely dominated by his tight playing, one of the most complex (from the drummer's point of view) songs Maiden ever composed. The tune also shows the immense vocal range of Bruce Dickinson: got to love that fantastic chorus. \u201cRevelations\u201d, a Dickinson penned take, follows, carrying a very egyptian/oriental vibe that was explored further by the band when \u201cPowerslave\u201d was released. It also features some nice tempo changes, the song changing constantly between calm and more aggressive sections. Again, the drumming is very good on this track too.\n\n\u201cFlight of Icarus\u201d is another strong song, insanely catchy and enjoyable, and the exact same thing goes to \u201cDie with your Boots On\u201d albeit this one is a bit weaker. The bass solo, courtesy of Steve Harris, is the highlight of the song, showing that Harris still plays an important role within the band. However, his bass here is a bit more buried under the guitars than on the previous albums, a thing that was fixed on the next pieces the band released (especially on \u201cPowerslave\u201d, where is bass is, at times, as loud as the guitars). The production is pretty competent, nevertheless, not the best the band had nor the worst. \u201cThe Trooper\u201d is a classic that everyone that is into metal knows, the fantastic guitar riff featured on it are absolutely unforgettable and so are the \u201cooooooooooaaaaaoh\u201d parts. You can sing along to this song until you die, that's for sure.\n\nUnfortunately, the next three tracks absolutely kill the flow of \u201cPiece of Mind\u201d; those, friends, are the ugliest and the most annoying fillers that Maiden ever recorded, that's right. \u201cStill Life\u201d is unforgettable and boring, got to hate that silly spoken intro. \u201cSun and Stell\u201d is a bit better, the chorus is listenable, but the song is lame, all in all. I like the \u201clife is like a wheel... and it's rolling... stiiiiillll\u201d part quite a bit though. Finally, \u201cQuest for Fire\u201d is another abomination just because you'll hardly ever remember anything about the song. The most horrid trilogy of songs ever put into a Maiden CD? I think so, lads. The closer, \u201cTo Tame a Land\u201d contains some nice melodies, working decently well as a closer. However, I don't like the tune that much, especially when I compare it to other album closers like \u201cRime of the Ancient Mariner\u201d, \u201cAlexander the Great\u201d, \u201cHallowed be Thy Name\u201d or even \u201cIron Maiden\u201d.\n\nAfter all, I've got to say that the performances of the musicians are top notch, this is Iron Maiden, not KoRn, isn't it? The guitars are excellent as ever, with the Murray-Smith team delivering some quite good solos and riffs. Nicko McBrain is the man of the album as I've already said and Steve Harris is always there, performing some tasteful bass solos on some tracks. The biggest flaw of the piece is its unconsistency, the afore-mentioned trilogy of fillers killing the flow of the record and harming the whole listening experience. \nSumming up, this album is very overrated, Maiden made better albums undoubtely (\u201cSeventh Son of a Seventh Son\u201d, the debut, \u201cPowerslave\u201d); however, the first five tunes are worth listening, they are all classics in their own way. \u201cPiece of Mind\u201d would be a killer album if that awful trilogy of fillers wasn't present. Meh.\n\nBest Moments of the CD:\n-the guitar attack of \u201cThe Trooper\u201d.\n-\u201dLife is like a wheel... And it's rolling still!\u201d.\n-the final repetition of the chorus of \u201cFlight of Icarus\u201d.\n",
        "\n\u201cThe Number of the Beast\u201d is widely regarded as one of the landmarks of heavy metal and one of the crowning achievements of Iron Maiden. This record put them truly in the map, selling very well, thanks to the title track and to \u201cRun to the Hills\u201d, the two big hits that made waves within the metal/rock community. But is \u201cThe Number of the Beast\u201d good? Is it a masterpiece, like many reviewers already stated?\n\nMeh, I don't think so. I'm a huge Iron Maiden fan, \u201cPowerslave\u201d is my favourite record ever, but this piece just doesn't get me, mainly because of its unconsistency. Everybody knows that Iron Maiden is a band that prefers to write great songs instead of great albums. There are bands out there, like Opeth, that make albums that really sound amazing as a whole, but Maiden just can't deliver a record like that (well, they delivered one, after all, the allmighty \u201cPowerslave\u201d). Unfortunately, there are always fillers here and there that kill the flow, in the majority of the times.\n\nSurprisingly, \u201cThe Number of the Beast\u201d has PLENTY of them. The opener is one of them, its chorus must be one of the most annoying choruses I've ever heard (\u201cInvaders!\u201d* childish bass line * \u201craping!\u201d * childish bass line *). However, this song is very fast and that's one of the main characteristic of \u201cThe Number of the Beast\u201d: there are some midpaced tracks here and there (\u201cChildren of the Damned\u201d, \u201cHallowed be Thy Name\u201d), but the majority of them are very upbeat. Clive Burr is the one that contributes the most to this aspect; while he isn't as technical as Nicko McBrain, his performance is simple but catchy and effective. His best performance can be heard on \u201cGangland\u201d, a drum-driven track, that should work well as an instrumental, as the music is reminiscent of the fantastic \u201cGenghis Khan\u201d, but everything is ruined by the vocal lines and the repetitive chorus. It kind of reminds of Metallica's \u201cMy Friend of Misery\u201d, which was also meant to be an instrumental, but, in the end, Hetfield sang on it and ruined the song (not completely though).\n\n\u201cThe Prisoner\u201d and \u201c22 Acacia Avenue\u201d follow also the boredom path; the first one has a nice spoken intro and drum lines, but it's WAY too long and that ruins the listening. The same thing goes to \u201c22 Acacia Avenue\u201d, a song that would be much better with a shorter length. The middle section is quite cool though.\n\nAnyways, now the good things... The guitar work is obviously amazing. Iron Maiden is very well known for the twin guitar leads and blazing solos and, hey, this record is great, guitar-wise. There are lots of good riffs and solos present here, from the technical middle section of the afore-mentioned \u201c22 Acacia Avenue\u201d to the unforgettable first notes of the title track, all absolutely top notch. And where would be Iron Maiden without Steve Harris? He is not as present here as on later albums (\u201cPowerslave\u201d or \u201cPiece of Mind\u201d, for example, are more bass-driven than this piece), but he still is audible and his playing is, like always, tasteful, complementing the performances of the other musicians very well and, most of all, actually adding something to the songs.\n\nAbout the highligts, there still are some here. \u201cChildren of the Damned\u201d is not the best ballad ever made, nor the most beautiful one, but it's decent, featuring an excellent performance of an emotional version of Dickinson, an approach that he later used again on \u201cInfinite Dreams\u201d, a track out of \u201cSeventh Son of a Seventh Son\u201d. It's a worth lisening track mainly because of the vocals, as I've already said, Dickinson doesn't deliver emotional performances too often, so better hear this one. The title track is an authentic classic and, despite I, in the majority of the times, hate the big hits of the metal bands, I must say that I like this one. And, wow, I like \u201cRun to the Hills\u201d too, one of the best tracks of this album. This song really grown on me over the time but now I love it; the fast drumming (and the intro, oh God) and the over-the-top Dickinson performance really please me.\n\nAfter a catchy meal provided by the \u201cGangland-666-Run to the Hills\u201d trinity, the Maiden gives us, then, a nice dose of epicness to our hears, with \u201cHallowed Be Thy Name\u201d, considered by many as the ultimate Maiden song. It begins with a fantastic guitar riff, that, with the help of some cymbal hits, provides a nice and mysterious atmosphere to the tune. Then, the vocals kick in, with Bruce singing calmly \u2013 got to love that \u201cthe sands of time, for me, are running... looooooooooow!!\u201d. After this part, the song becomes heavier, with a blazing deliverance of great metal guitar riffs by the two masterful guitar players. Anyways, I really like this song, but I don't consider it as one of the best Maiden ever wrote. In my opinion, there are thousands of better Maiden songs out there (\u201dRime of the Ancient Mariner\u201d, \u201cPhantom of the Opera\u201d, \u201cDance of Death\u201d, even \u201cThe Legacy\u201d. However, it still wins the prize for the best track of \u201cThe Number of the Beast\u201d.\n\nSo, this is a typical Maiden album, with too much fillers present; the only different thing is that they are actually worse than the ones on the other albums, so that harms the whole listening experience. Anyways, this record marked the beginning of the golden era of the band, so it's worth listening after all. But if you want the best Maiden record, get \u201cPowerslave\u201d or even \u201cSeventh Son of a Seventh Son\u201d, which is a bit weaker but still good.\nOn other hand, there's some good material here, songs like \u201cHallowed Be Thy Name\u201d and \u201cRun to the Hills\u201d are simply great and deserve a listen. And the performances of the musicians are all quite good, so that's another reason to hear this.\n\nBest Moments of the CD:\n-the creepy beginning of \u201cThe Number of the Beast\u201d.\n-the drum intro of \u201cRun to the Hills\u201d.\n-the calm section of \u201cHallowed Be Thy Name\u201d.\n",
        "\nThe original release of Iron Maiden\u2019s Live After Death concert video definitely hit home with Maiden fans everywhere. Now, 23 years later, Eddie and the boys are back again, along with the same reaction and reception of the old fans (with the addition of a new generation of Maiden freaks, of course). The title says it all; as awesome as you would expect, but with more.\n\nDisc 1 is the concert, which has been re-vamped with video/audio re-mastering, along with a new 5.1 Surround Sound audio mix, which totally rocks. The live renditions of the songs are very well-done, and very close to the originals, especially a song like Rime of the Ancient Mariner, knowing how long it is. This is definitely the best display of classic Maiden, and the best display of how theatrical the band is on tour. \n\nDisc 2 is where it gets interesting. The History of Iron Maiden, Part 2 is a very good look at the Powerslave-era of the band, and quite funny too. Rock In Rio 1985 is also cool, since it was the very first one, although not every song in the set is on the DVD. Behind The Iron Curtain is cool as well, since it\u2019s been out of print for a long time, so it\u2019s sweet to see it included on this DVD. The others things like \u2018Ello Texas, the music videos, and the still galleries, are great additions to an already awesome DVD. \n\nI only have 2 beefs with this DVD, which keep it for getting 99%. Firstly, the editing isn\u2019t always the greatest. I don\u2019t know whether to blame it on a lack of a good editor, or a lack of easy-to-use editing technology in \u201985, or maybe both, but the shots don\u2019t always sync up with the audio. Either they are the wrong shots, or the audio may be slightly ahead or behind the video. I noticed this especially with shots of Nicko. You\u2019re probably thinking, \u201cNobody notices that stuff, because he\u2019s the drummer\u201d, but as a drummer myself, I DO notice. Secondly, there aren\u2019t any easter eggs. I\u2019m not the biggest Maiden fan in the world, so I don\u2019t know what kinds of little things they could\u2019ve added as easter eggs for this DVD. But the point is that there aren\u2019t any, and that kinda sucks. \n\nOverall, this is the best display of classic Maiden, and a must for any fan. If you\u2019re a Maiden freak, you probably have it by now. If you are only a small fan, then you\u2019ll be a lot more into them because of this DVD. The material is great on both discs, and it\u2019s not lacking anything, DVD-wise. Awesome stuff \\m/_(-_-)_\\m/.\n",
        "\nWhat the flip? There used to be a review of me here. Has it been deleted after a year? With what reason? Must have been a mistake. I\u2019ll immediately write a new one then. \n\nI laughed my ass off when somebody wrote \u201cFanboys will make you think it's bad\u201d. This album being bad has nothing to do with previous Maiden efforts nor even Blaze. Even if this would have been a debut by a new band, it would have been ignored or even bashed by the media and listeners. Man, even if this would have been a new Wolfsbane album people would have been disappointed!\n\nWhy do some people persist in calling this album underrated? Why do you persist in claiming this to be good when even the band themselves ignore this release these days. This is the lowest point in Maiden\u2019s career and certainly not without reason. I\u2019m getting the impression some people claim to like this album just so they could voice a different opinion. Pubescent behaviour?\n\nNow let\u2019s not talk about Blaze. We\u2019ve done that on the previous records. So this time it\u2019s about the quality of the songs. Now there are two songs on this album that actually sound like Iron Maiden. Opener \u201cFutureal\u201d is very short and up tempo. These days (first three reunion albums with Dickinson) I complain about Maiden songs being far too long, in this case we\u2019re talking about a song that is too short! It\u2019s a pretty good tune!\n\nSecondly this album has \u201cThe Clansman\u201d. This song is worthy of the Sign Of The Cross, Fear Of The Dark and To Tame a Land legacy. It is an extremely well written epic. Of course the chanting of \u201cFreedom\u201d is too blatantly stolen from Braveheart but when not keeping that movie in mind, it is a very strong song no matter who it sings!\n\nBut apart from these two songs every thing falls apart on this album. \u201cThe Angel & the Gambler\u201d is the worst song in Maiden history. Yes, this monstrosity is even worse than Wasting Love or Bring Your Daughter. Horrible keyboards, lack of real riffs and an even worse vocal line which is repeating itself a billion times. Old men\u2019s hair metal lasting almost 10 minutes. Somebody should be shot because of this song. And to think it was none other than Steve Harris who wrote this atrocity! When hearing it I thought this must\u2019ve come from Gers and Blaze. Those two did indeed write something hideous here. \u201cComo Estais Amigo\u201d is dull rock. Nothing metal about it. Still could\u2019ve been good, but it is so bloody boring! Not to mention the stupid title. \n\nWell Steve Harris really had an off day here since \u201cDon't Look to the Eyes of a Stranger\u201d is also one of the worst songs here. Just like Angel and The Gambler I can\u2019t recall any other song on which the title is sung so many times. This time it takes 8 minutes to sit through overstretched nonsense.\n\n\u201cWhen Two Worlds Collide\u201d has a few moments bringing Maiden to mind but as a whole it is a rather generic tune. \u201cLightning Strikes Twice\u201d and \u201cThe Educated Fool\u201d are two meandering songs which would have been too dull even for the X-Factor or Fear Of The Dark. \n\nThe album is filled with long and very dull songs that have more of a hardrock feeling to them that the energetic metal Maiden were once famous for. Two good songs cannot save the worst album is Maiden history. Those two songs take this album up to 20 points. However the awful harmless production (where are the guitars? And secondly Gers is sloppier here than ever, just like he\u2019d be on Dance Of Death) and equally dull artwork (although better than The X-Factor) take it down to 10 points. Ouch!\n\nGet \"Futureal\" and \"The Clansman\" and forget about the rest, quickly.\n",
        "\nOkay, I like certain aspects of this album and I would not call it an over all horrible release but I will start by immediately pointing out the weaknesses. On this album it becomes very clear that Dickinson is getting older. When hearing him sing higher pitched vocals one can hear his voice struggling all the time. It\u2019s not that natural sounding anymore as it did on Seventh Son. This of course is logical since many years have past but it really is something that tempers the enthusiasm about some songs. \n\nSecondly the guitar sound is more messy and blurry than on Brave New World. I\u2019m really missing that old staccato sound on some songs. Remember the days of Aces High and Flight Of Icarus? Well SOMEONE on this album is playing his parts to pretty sloppy. SOMEONE doesn\u2019t have that metal staccato feeling and is playing certain riffs with a hardrockish right hand. This once again is a bummer. I'm getting annoyed.\n\nThirdly Steve Harris is relying on bass power chords too much instead of those galloping parts he was once famous for. A lot of songs feature him stroking his bass instead of truly playing it. At certain point we can even call it a lazy performance. This will not do! since I looked up to that man when I was a jong boy.\n\nLast but not least the album is very inconsistent. I\u2019m not talking stylewise here like Fear Of The Dark but in terms of quality.\n\nNow for some positive aspects. The albums opens with 5 good or decent songs in a row. \u201cWildest Dream\u201d isn\u2019t as good as earlier Smith singles, but it is an enjoyable rocking tune with a sleazy chorus but would\u2019ve been a B-side in the eighties. \u201cRainmaker\u201d has a good drive, sweet melodies and a catchy chorus in the \u201cNo Prayer for the Dying\u201d album sense. Fourth song \u201cMontsegur\u201d is equally strong yet has a slightly better chorus. \n\n\u201cNo More Lies\u201d however is a real masterpiece. Now this is Maiden. A strong epic filled with changes in pace and Dickinson performs rather well here. The title track is majestic as well. It combines the folky touch of the earlier Blood Brothers (from BraveNewWorld) with the epic approach of eighties Maiden and a touch of \u201cFear Of The Dark\u201d.\n\nOnly two songs from the rest of the album are good. \u201cPaschendale\u201d is another epic that does well live especially and has a very catchy beautiful intro. Closing song \u201cJourneyman\u201d can be considered a ballad but because of its folky vocal lines it is never cheesy. A good tune with a very good Dickinson!\n\nThe remaining songs is were it all goes horribly wrong. \u201cGates of Tomorrow\u201d has a hair metal intro that is even weaker than Lord Of The Flies (X-Factor, 1995). \u201cNew Frontier\u201d? Just dull. \u201cFace in the Sand\u201d and \u201cAge of Innocence\u201d are both songs that have some nice ideas but fail to deliver as a whole. The lack of a strong chorus in both cases makes these songs fail in the end.\n\nSo you see, there is a lot to complain about concerning \u201cDance Of The Dead\u201d. The album however features 7 songs that are worthwhile from which 3 can really be considered really excellent. 7 out of 11 is pretty lacking though. This would result in giving the album 64 points. The sloppy rhythm performance of a certain guitarist, the laziness with which Harris plays some basslines and the decreasing quality of Dickinson\u2019s voice however do drag it down to 55 points. \n\nIt\u2019s because of this album I\u2019ve concluded having three guitarist is unnecessary, makes it even sound sloppy and Dickinson is really getting old. They should be grateful I\u2019m not deducting more points for the second rate cover art.\n",
        "\nFor anyone who purchases an album for the purpose of listening to it all the way through, the pacing of any opus is an essential element that must be well ordered so that entire experience can maintain a sense of organization. The metal genre is, by nature, systematic and methodical. Even the most avant-garde of acts in the most obscure of sub-genres will rely on an underlying symmetrical structure in order to keep the listener hooked in.\n\nIron Maiden had always kept a very strict structure to their work from their first album on, until the notable exception of \u201cThe X Factor\u201d, which ushered in a potential alternative approach of writing longer songs and modeling entire albums after the longer winded, epic style of 1970s progressive rock for the band. Since that time, Steve Harris and company have tried to marry their older approach of evenly paced songs with the occasional long number with the \u201c4 or more songs timing over 7 minutes\u201d structure. \n\n\u201cDance of Death\u201d represents the most moderated combination of length and brevity, switching gears every couple tracks to keep the listener guessing, while putting forth the most consistent and quality based songwriting since \u201cSeventh Son of a Seventh Son\u201d. The capabilities of the 3 guitar arrangement are exploited well enough, but for the most part this album listens more like the ones where 2 guitarists were in congress. In fact, apart from Bruce\u2019s vocals, Adrian Smith providing his invaluable input on songwriting, and a slightly more upbeat overall lyrical approach, this album bears the most resemblance to \u201cThe X Factor\u201d of anything to date.\n\nThings start out pretty fast and optimistic with \u201cWildest Dreams\u201d, kicking up the riff and tempo assault a notch from previous album opener \u201cThe Wicker Man\u201d and offering something quite similar to Maiden\u2019s faster work in the early 80s. Likewise, \u201cRainmaker\u201d, \u201cMontsegur\u201d and \u201cGates of Tomorrow\u201d come in and out of the works, before and after longer winded songs and keep the overall flow of the album constant and driving. Particular mention should be given to \u201cGates of Tomorrow\u201d for having the most energy I\u2019ve heard out of a fast Maiden song since 1988.\n\nThe longer songs on here spare us no amount of enjoyment either, as all the contrasting sections are appropriately spaced out and the over-repetition that haunted much of 1990s Maiden epics has been cut away. The band\u2019s own musical take on the Danse Macabre and the album\u2019s title track throws an intriguing mix of Celtic inspired melodic ideas along side their standard thematic material and succeeds at sounding quite theatrical. Bruce Dickinson would often assume many of the roles depicted in the lyrics while touring on this album, be it the masked dancers or the Grim Reaper, all in one single performance between the many instrumental breaks. Other songs that make exceptional use of atmosphere and thematic contrast include the World War I inspired \u201cPaschendale\u201d, the heavy and socially conscious \u201cFace in the Sand\u201d, and the all acoustic epic tale of self-actualization \u201cThe Journeyman\u201d.\n\nFrom start to finish, everything on here just begs to be listened to, and in the order that it is present in. The same can\u2019t really be said for most of what Maiden had put forward in the 13 years before this came out. It doesn\u2019t quite reach the same magnitude of the early years or their zenith in the mid 80s, but it gets extremely close. If you liked \u201cBrave New World\u201d and \u201cThe X Factor\u201d, and if you aren\u2019t dissuaded by a somewhat goofy looking album art, this successfully merges the best elements of both of those albums and injects the resulting hybrid with a needed dose of energy.\n",
        "\nHard time for anybody, having to replace Bruce Dickinson. But Mr Blaze did pretty okay here. But nothing more. The lack of variation in his vocals does damage the dynamics of the album. His darker lower voice resulted in the songs sounding less alive and more alike. The result is an album that has a lot of moments that feel interchangeable. The style is referring more to the eighties days than their last previous two efforts with Bruce but as said the over all feel is much darker.\n\nThe album starts off with an epic. And a pretty good one as well I must add. \u201cSign of the Cross\u201d follows the dark epic path of an earlier classic such as \u201cSeventh Son\u201d and Blaze\u2019s dark vocals give the song a slight medieval touch. (the later live version with Dickinson proved it would have easily sounded just as good with him though)\n\nNow \u201cMan On The Edge\u201d sounds like remake from the earlier Be Quick or Be Dead since it has the same kind of main riff and song structure. Enjoyable song though. The real highlights however (apart from Sign of The Cross) are \u201cJudgement of Heaven\u201d and \u201cThe Edge of Darkness\u201d. Now these are typical Maiden songs referring to the eighties with lots of changes in pace and dynamics. The songs are so good, the rather monotone vocals cannot harm them but it becomes obvious Dickinson is really missing here since with him these songs would\u2019ve easily become Maiden classics. Also worth mentioning is \u201cBlood on the World's Hands\u201d which is powerful and ends on fifth place of best songs here. \n\nOn this album however the band began their nasty attitude of repeating titles and lyrics too many times within songs. \u201cFortunes of War\u201d is a perfect example. They would overdo this even more on future albums. One wonders why they didn\u2019t write some more lyrics. Hastiness? Anyway, this tendency has annoyed me ever since.\n\nUnfortunately a lot of songs (pretty much the rest of them) are plain dull. Especially \u201cLord of the Flies\u201d is a generic piece of rock and Blaze\u2019s vocals on the verses are pathetic and harmless. Well, don\u2019t get me wrong, my review is not about bashing Blaze. I like some songs he has done with Maiden and the next album would prove to be the real downfall of Maiden, but here on \u201cThe X-factor\u201d he can be very good as well as horribly lacking.\n\nWhat I really dislike about the album is the artwork. It looks like crap. Where are the brilliant paintings? This looks like second rate horror movie props and could be okay for a generic death metal band, but not the mighty Maiden.\n\nThe album was stylewise much more consistent than \u201cFear Of The Dark\u201d yet fails to be as to-the-point as \u201cNo Prayer\u201d was. In terms of quality the album falls between those albums. A lot of songs here just aren\u2019t up to Maiden standards and fillers at best. So even though nobody really hates this album, it has become the Maiden album everybody thinks is okay but is collecting dust in the end.\n\nStandouts:\n\u201cSign Of The Cross\u201d, \u201cJudgement Of Heaven\u201d, \u201cThe Edge Of Darkness\u201d, \u201cBlood On The World\u2019s Hands\u201d and \u201cMan on the Edge\u201d\n\nResult: Now this is an album I\u2019d give 70 points but the artwork, monotone vocals and the rather flat production take it down to 60 points.\n",
        "\nNow here\u2019s a Maiden album that is way up there with Powerslave and Number Of The Beast. This album once again was a step forward in terms of production but the lyrics were also a lot better than on the previous \u201cSomewhere in Time\u201d album. On this album Dickinson and Murray provided some material again, making this album slightly more varied than SIT already was.\n\nI will continue this review by immediately pointing out an underrated all time Maiden classic. We\u2019re talking \u201cThe Prophecy\u201d here, a Murray-Harris tune. The song has some similarities with the earlier Still Life (Piece Of Mind, 1983) but is an improved version of the concept. The melodies on this song are some of the best on this album and the song as a whole an a pinnacle of heavy metal beauty. This is a song I have always found to be worthy of being in the regular live set and should be on every compilation. Yes, I feel that strong about this song. The best song with Murray in the credits.\n\nAnother personal fave (and fortunately also a general fan-fave) is opener \u201cMoonchild\u201d which probably is the heaviest and fastest song Smith and Dickinson wrote together for Maiden. This song is worthy of the Aces High-The Trooper legacy and the ultimate opener on the album.\n\nI had some troubles with \u201cInfinite Dreams\u201d over the years because of the slick guitars on the intro and the feeling this song was too much of a third version of Remember Tomorrow and Revelations. The song however grew on me over the years and has become a timeless classic power ballad because of the brilliant way the vocal lines progress and the easiness of the time changes throughout the song.\n\nThe epic master piece, the title track, has a lot of similarities with Rime Of The Ancient Mariner. The song is somewhat slower and darker but also has a lengthy laid back middle section with an eerie atmosphere and spoken words. Apart from that comparison the song is brilliant with an excelling Dickinson on vocals and great use of keyboards without getting cheesy.\n\n\u201cThe Evil That Men Do\u201d and \u201cThe Clairvoyant\u201d are two singles that are catchy but never cheesy. They are two compact songs from which the first is based more around riffs and the second about on. On both songs Dickinson gives an outstanding performance. \u201cOnly the Good Die Young\u201d could have easily have been a single as well, balancing between the speed and heaviness of Moonchild and the catchiness of The Evil That Men Do the song is another hidden gem on the album.\n\nLeaves us with \u2018that\u2019 song. The very commercial sounding and over-catchy \u201cCan I Play With Madness\u201d. This song couldn\u2019t have come as a surprise since it only takes the success formula of \u201cWasted Years\u201d a step further. It is a metalized rock song with catchy chorus and flashy guitars but mostly it is a good Maiden song.\n\nSo you see, there are no bad songs here, making this one of the best Maiden albums ever. Also the artwork was sheer beauty (even though it featured Eddie). The colours, the concept. And once again a broader sound.\n",
        "\nWell, there are people who think this album was even better than Number Of The Beast. For one thing the sales on this one were massive. But that is always to be expected with an album following a breakthrough release. Me personally, I think \u201cPiece Of Mind\u201d is excellent but balancing between two even better albums. Whereas Number Of The Beast was an album finding a new way with a new vocalist, this time that new vocalist also contributed material and the band had to get used to a new drummer, Nicko McBrain.\n\nOpener \u201cWhere Eagles Dare\u201d immediately proves the new dude can play. Such dynamics and power. However the fastest songs on this album do not feel as fast as, let\u2019s say, Invaders and Gangland were earlier (not forgetting to mention early days songs like Purgatory). On Piece Of Mind Nicko McBrain clearly has less tendencies to pick up the tempo or he just doesn\u2019t sound that fast. This is something I always disliked despite how good the man actually is. \n\nThe guitar sound is pretty weird on this album. Later on it would prove to be the missing link between their raw early days and their more massive works from the late eighties. On this album however the guitars sound as if they were recorded in a small cardboard box. This works for some songs (Flight Of Icarus and even \u201cTo Tame A Land\u201d) but isn\u2019t really good enough for songs like \u201cWhere Eagles Dare\u201d and \u201cRevelations\u201d, which could have done with a wider sound.\n\nThere are only three songs on this album that are debatable in terms of quality. \u201cStill Life\u201d (the only Murray contribution here).This song is more about melodies and dynamics than a catchy song structure. It is the rather generic \u201cNightmares, Spirits calling me\u201d section that will raise some eyebrows now and then because the rest of the song is remarkably beautiful. The others are two songs which are considered fillers by many. We\u2019re talking \u201cQuest for Fire\u201d and \u201cSun and Steel\u201d here. Now \u201cQuest for Fire\u201d has a strong chorus but indeed is pretty much average material. \u201cSun and Steel\u201d is slightly better but has an over generic fist banging metal chorus. Neither of these songs can be considered really bad though. They\u2019re just fillers compared to the rest of the songs.\n\nThe power ballad \u201cRevelations\u201d is a Dickinson song and even though it is a rather simple one, the melodies and dynamics of the song are strong and certainly Maiden-proof. The biggest highlight however (together with opener \u201cWhere Eagles Dare\u201d) is the closing song \u201cTo Tame a Land\u201d which is the epic anthem on this album. Darker than Hallowed Be Thy Name was yet having a more prominent role for Harris\u2019 bass.\n\n\u201cDie With Your Boots On\u201d is a straight forward rocker with some typical Smith riffing yet fitting into the Maiden sound. His other composition, the single \u201cFlight Of Icarus\u201d, is fairly simple but efficient. This song dramatically pounds along with some nice vocals details on the chorus. The other single \u201cThe Trooper\u201d is a galloping Harris song and one of the best Maiden singles ever. Sheer power and superb dynamics. The energy of the song has withstood time with ease. The only complaint about this song is hearing it too much on every live performance, compilation etcetera.\n\nNow as said the production feels lacking at times and there are some fillers here. Making this album not as good as some other Maiden albums from the eighties but still having plenty of classic Maiden songs to stand firm after all these years!\n",
        "\nThe biggest problems with Somewhere In Time are very simple. It is an album which is close to genius but falls between two even bigger masterpieces (Powerslave & Seventh Son that is of course). Secondly the lyrical content here is somewhat lacking compared to the earlier mentioned two classics. For example the lyrics to \u201cD\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu\u201d are plain awful. Fortunately the song itself is excellent.\n\nWell, that about wraps up the biggest two complaints. There is of course a reason this album remains one of the all time Maiden classics. That it because it is just excellent and has a lot of character. As said the lyrics are lacking here but the music was once again a step forward. And so were the production and use of (guitar) synths.\n\nThe album opens with an epic tune immediately. But because of the high tempo \u201cCaught Somewhere in Time\u201d never feels like an epic but still remains interesting the full length. The speed, dynamics and enormous presence of great melodies makes this song an instant classic. \u201cSea Of Madness\u201d is one of the more brutal metal tunes here. Though not as impressive as a lot of other songs on this album it holds firm because of its catchiness and heavy moments.\n\n\u201cThe Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner\u201d does what the title says. Almost just like the opening tune it just goes on and on and dares the listener to hold on. It\u2019s a long ride but a memorable one. The pre-chorus and chorus are majestic and the energy of this song is almost unequalled on the rest of the album.\n\nNow the true epic piece here is of course \u201cAlexander the Great\u201d. A song that was completed in the studio and never performed live. It can compete with earlier classics like Hallowed By The Name and To Tame a Land with ease. The lyrics are somewhat dull but the concept is great and so is the spoken intro.\n\nThen we have the two mid paced and catchy singles. \u201cStranger in a Strange Land\u201d is the heaviest of the two and I never seem to get bored by that heavy main riff and that awesome chorus. This is truly classic eighties pounding heavy metal the way it should be. The other one, \u201cWasted Years\u201d, has the trademark Adrian Smith intro and is a laid back song about being on tour with a strong yet over-catchy chorus and a great solo.\n\nLeaves us with that song the band has been playing live for so many years. We\u2019re talking \u201cHeaven Can Wait\u201d here. Now this song has actually got one of the weakest choruses on the album yet the band persisted in playing this song live. The middle section of the song is great though and the sing-a-long part always proved much fun live. To be honest it really isn\u2019t one of the best songs here and sounds like a filler compared to the earlier mentioned classics. A good filler that is.\n\nLast but not least the production is very typical. The use of guitar synths has broadened the sound even more, making this album sound majestic at times! This typical sound, which no other Maiden album has, gave the album even more character and emphasised the futuristic artwork. Once again the band managed to combine production and artwork perfectly. The artwork is classy. Though not as good as Powerslave, it obviously still has character and the album cover is fun to look through, trying to find all those references. The futuristic Eddie looks great. \n\nEven though Dickinson would later admit this period was not one of his most inspirational ones, his vocal performance is stunning here. But he and Murray kept a low profile compositionally this time. It was up to Smith and Harris to deliver the songs. Adrian Smith wrote three out of eight songs this time. And three of the better or more successful ones even I must add! But don\u2019t worry, Dickinson would awake on the next album again, and how!\n",
        "\nThere you have it. All kinds of standard metal proof items filling the lyrical content of this classic Iron Maiden album. After their major breakthrough Number Of The Beast and their consolidating Piece Of Mind effort. The band now found themselves at the height of their career in the middle eighties.\n\nEntering the studio with a hand full of songs and quickly finishing some other ideas (like the mighty \u201cRime of the Ancient Mariner\u201d!) the band released yet another album rather quickly after 16 months in which the band toured a lot. The result is remarkable. It is obvious Iron Maiden could deliver under stressing circumstances. The band simply didn\u2019t have the time for doubts nor insecurities. They just went in and came out holding Powerslave under their arms. And what a majestic piece it was.\n\nThe band (especially Harris) surpassed himself with the mighty \u201cRime Of The Ancient Mariner\u201d. The band had written some epics earlier but this one was over 13 minutes long yet still logical and easy to sit through without ever getting dull or dragging. Opener \u201cAces High\u201d was the ultimate short efficient heavy metal anthem including raging riffs, great melodies, pounding drums and a marvellous vocal performance by Dickinson. \u201cFlash Of The Blade\u201d following closely in terms of greatness.\n\nNow \u201cthe Duellists\u201d is a song balancing between the shorter singles and the longer epic songs. Especially the strong middle section including its harmonies and leads is a great piece of work not forgetting to mention the strong chorus. \u201cBack In The Village\u201d is a song balancing between heavy metal and hardrock in terms of riffing but manages to be a refreshing tune because of its tempo and catchy vocal lines. Once again Dickinson excels here.\n\nThe title track, as Dickinson and Harris explained later, initially consisted of three different ideas for songs but somehow worked together perfectly. The good Egyptian atmosphere of the main riff, the laid back middle section which excels in beauty, it all worked out fine. Coincidence, sheer dumb luck or clever composing? Who cares really. The song is a true Maiden classic.\n\nThere were however two weaknesses on the album. Not weak enough though to ruin the album. But \u201cLosfer Words\u201d was probably one of those hasty ideas that didn\u2019t work out that well due to a time limit. The song should have matured some more. It would prove to be the last instrumental on a Maiden album and it doesn\u2019t come close to earlier classics like Genghis Khan or Transylvania even though there are some pretty brilliant riffs and melodies here and there. \nThe other weak spot is \u201c2 Minutes to Midnight\u201d. Some people love it, others hate it. It\u2019s also a fact the band has been playing this song live far too long and although it being much better in the live environment it remains \u201cthat hard rock tune\u201d on this over all classic heavy metal album. The pre-chorus and chorus are mind blowing though! So in fact \u201c2 Minutes to Midnight\u201d isn\u2019t really that bad, it\u2019s just that the rest of the songs are so much better and genius!\n\nNow the production is perfect. It is organic yet clear and certainly heavy enough. The guitars have a crunchy sound and are a bit broader than they were on Piece of Mind making this album \u2018breathe\u2019 more than its predecessor. For some reason the sound of the guitars is just as ochre as the album cover. \n\nTalking about the album cover, one of the best in Maiden history as well. I always liked the little \u201cIndiana Jones was here\u201d and \u201cWhat, No Guinness\u201d details. Something which is hard to find on the small CD cover by the way. I know, a CD version is easier but this is an album you should own on vinyl because of the artwork! So I advise everyone to get the vinyl and, if possible, the poster.\n",
        "\nI had expected it would be a matter of time before Dickinson would rejoin Maiden or even another vocalist replacing Blaze eventually. I never expected to see Adrian Smith again though. Glad he\u2019s back though. Even though Gers was the more flashier player, I prefer the looks, style and coolness of Smith. Not forgetting to mention that smith is able to write far more rocking metal tunes than the lightweight rock \u2018n\u2019 roll Gers from time to time writes for the group. But now we have all three guitarists in the band and this seems somewhat overdone. I understand they just can\u2019t fire Gers because Maiden are a bunch of swell guys and because it is a challenge to try it with three guitarist but it still remains weird to this day.\n\nAnyway, Smith and Dickinson immediately wrote a fair bunch of material for this album and the credits show this album was written more by the band as a whole than a few individuals bringing finished products to the rehearsal room. In some cases this works (Blood Brothers, Ghost Of The Navigator) but sometimes it becomes an overstretched mess (the title track).\n\nIt is good to hear Dickinson singing Maiden songs again. He has a clear voice with much dynamics, giving the music something extra. How classic the X-factor would have been with Dickinson singing those songs. He couldn\u2019t have saved the awful Virtual XI album though. This album mostly mixes the X-factor style with No Prayer for The Dying and incidentally refers to their eighties days. Don\u2019t expect really fast songs of intense riffing on \u201cBrave New World\u201d. The album is more about chord progressions and melodies. Adrian Smith did however put riffs (Wicker Man, The Fallen Angel) back into Iron Maiden fortunately.\n\nAs said two of the highlights are Ghost Of The Navigator and Blood Brothers. Both are lengthy epic tunes from which \u201cGhost of the Navigator\u201d sounds most traditional in the \u201cAfraid To Shoot Strangers / To Tame A Land\u201d kind of way. \u201cBlood Brothers\u201d brings interesting string arrangements to a folk-orientated waltz. A new approach which works out remarkably well.\n\nOpening tune \u201cThe Wicker Man\u201d shows Adrian Smith at his best. A simple rocker which balances between good old hardrock and heavy metal with some steady riffing and a decent chorus (not mind blowing though). The fourth track worth mentioning is the epic \u201cDream of Mirrors\u201d which features Gers in the credits and he has surpassed himself here. Even though the chorus is a bit too hardrockish it remains a solid epic Maiden classic.\n\nThen there are the fillers. \u201cThe Mercenary\u201d and \u201cThe Fallen Angel\u201d have a lot in common with the average song on No Prayer For The Dying with some hints of 1986-era Smith material and are decent Maiden tunes with some good moments but never becoming true masterpieces because in both cases the chorus should have been stronger. Also on these songs it becomes most obvious the production has its shortcomings. The drums are too damn heavy. This lumberjack sound makes the songs heavy but also makes them feel slower and more dragging.\n\nNow, the Murray-Harris tune \u201cThe Thin Line Between Love and Hate\u201d is pretty bad. Even though it has Dickinson singing, it still sounds as if it\u2019s coming straight from Virtual XI. The vocal line is dull and monotone and the song as a whole an annoying dull hardrock tune without balls. \u201cOut of the Silent Planet\u201d has some sweet ideas but is far from memorable.\n\n\u201cNomad\u201d suffers from the Mother-Russia-disease. The song is based around some ethnic sounding melodies but fails to deliver as a whole. The chorus is pretty weak as well. The remain really bad track is the title track. Now this song has enough ideas and lyrics for a two and a half minute song yet manages to drag on for over six minutes! I haven\u2019t counted the times we hear Dickinson sing the title but it is bloody annoying.\n\nSo there you have it. Great to have smith and Dickinson back and great to have some new Maiden classics. But there are too many fillers or really bad tunes here to consider this a classic Maiden album.\n\nThe good:\nBlood Brothers, Ghost Of The Navigator, The Wicker Man, Dream Of Mirrors \n\nThe decent:\nThe Mercenary, The Fallen Angel, Nomad\n\nThe bad:\nBrave New World, Out of the Silent Planet, The Thin Line Between Love and Hate\n",
        "\nI gave this a low score, not because it's got bad songs, not because it's suckass... But because it's the same shit that we've had 2,036 times already. It's ANOTHER greatest hits by Iron Maiden! Let's all buy it, as we've never had these songs on any of our other fucking greatest hit travesties...\n\nWe had Best of the Beast, which shares approximately... 9 songs with this 15 song set. Bullshit? You smell it too?\n\nEd Hunter? 10 (12 if you count live on one, studio on another) 17 Numbers? 5. Wait, that's not so bad... But wait! There's more! Edward the Great? 7.\n\nHow many more goddamn best of's do we need? None. Or, at least none with the same tracks as every other (Run to the Hills, Number of the Beast, 2 Minutes to Midnight, The Trooper, Can I Play with Madness, Hallowed be Thy Name) This CD is the equivalent to We Sold Our Soul by Sabbath. But, as Sabbath did, Maiden could easily redeem themselves by putting out the equivalent of \"Symptom of the Universe...\" We'll call it \"The Hits You Haven't Heard! Eddie's Backstock!\"\n\nThe point is, this brings nothing to the table, and is essentially useless. I can't review the songs, cause they are on EVERY OTHER COMP!\n\nDon't buy this... buy The Essential, since it spaces out it's \"hits.\"\n",
        "\nIt was many years ago when Iron Maiden became a fundamental name in metal\u2019s household, but taking a little trip back in time can make those days alive again, and with compilation like so, you\u2019re suddenly back in 1985! Intended for newer fans, methinks \u201cSomewhere Back in Time\u201d does an ace-shot job of introducing basic anthems captured between 1980 and 1989, which showcases the finest offshoots of Eddie\u2019s masters. If you\u2018ve heard of Iron Maiden\u2019s rewarding legacy and wish to understand why they\u2019ve remained one of the genre\u2019s best for such a long period, \u201cSomewhere Back in Time\u201d will rightfully be the proper choice when deciphering the essential numbers of England\u2019s metal masters. \n\nAs it\u2019s sniping for those unfamiliar, questioning how enjoyable this effort is doesn\u2019t make much sense; instead, a clueless newbie must identify with Iron Maiden\u2019s signature sound: first-class heavy metal. Right from the start, Adrian Smith and Dave Murray cast forth sweeping harmonies while exercising memorable riffs that stick in your head hours after putting them down, not to mention those crazy solos! Although guitars are primarily leading, Steve Harris\u2019 bass refuses to remain dormant during tunes like \u201cChildren of the Damned\u201d in which his finger-plucking madness overrides tiny gaps of blankness, usually appearing like a smoker that just won\u2019t stop. Together with such precision, Bruce Dickinson\u2019s high-flying vocals now infiltrate all the above atmosphere, leading to an epic voyage only this band could lead you on. That, my friends, is Iron Maiden in a paragraph. \n\n\u201cSomewhere Back in Time,\u201d however, lives up to the moniker it represents by barraging unsuspecting newcomers with Iron Maiden\u2019s definite emeralds from their set of legendary recordings. Starting with the famous ones like \u201cNumber of the Beast\u201d and \u201cAces High,\u201d curious subjects will soon find the speed and utter catchiness to match Iron Maiden\u2019s undeniable intelligence, even when observing those duel-melodies on \u201cThe Trooper\u201d or Adrian Smith\u2019s knifing solos; just exposing these basic qualities is the only goal, and it is accomplished entirely. Also, the addition of \u201cWasted Years\u201d and the two aces from Iron Maiden\u2019s seventh opus gives our virgin listeners a chance to hear an experiment of evolutionary electricity and lunar potency that literally rewrote everything the band had acquired, marking a magnificent sub-section of the dynamic seven-album streak that still radiates power like Odin\u2019s valor several years later. It\u2019s how the boys did business, baby! \n\nThe amount of compilations in Iron Maiden\u2019s discography is quite outrageous, and trying to pick the right one can be rather straining, but with \u201cSomewhere Back in Time\u201d now on the shelves, you no longer need to shuffle through disc after disc; this here is THE honest taxonomic chapter of Eddie\u2019s creators, capturing every blazing note of Satanic vision and divine prophecy that have carved in a dynasty unlike any other. Fact is, Iron Maiden shined like a supernova from 1980 straight into the final seconds of 1989, making this kicker truly fit for the material it holds within, and unlike previous collections, we aren\u2019t missing a single gem. All other best-of releases are just best-of releases, so execute what doesn\u2019t look fit and enjoy the only Iron Maiden compilation worthy of anyone\u2019s time or money.\n\nThis review was written for: www.Thrashpit.com\n",
        "\nI\u2019ve been a fan since I first heard Wasted Years somewhere in \u201986 and keeping track of the band ever since. There are albums I still play monthly and some albums collecting dust (mostly the 1992-1998 era). I have been playing this album now every few months since it came out about two years ago and I must conclude this is the worst Maiden album since the reunion with Smith and Dickinson. Is it bad? No, it is pretty enjoyable but somehow it just doesn\u2019t grab my attention the whole time and the previous two studio albums just made more sense.\n\nBiggest problem really is the laid back atmosphere surrounding \u201cA Matter of Life and Death \u201d. Of course there are some sparse up tempo moments but as a whole the album just wanders along in a slow pace. Even the fastest and shortest song (\u201cDifferent World\u201d) is a bit too tame when listening to it and keeping songs like Moonchild or Aces High in mind. What makes this more obvious is the way Dickinson sings his way through the song. I\u2019m missing some aggression, some rawness. It\u2019s just too nice. I\u2019m really missing that raging heavy metal feeling.\n\nAnother annoying aspect is the fact that there are many long songs here and the efficiency is lacking at some important moments. The album could have done with some shorter and simpler (heavier) songs to keep the balance. Whereas the old Maiden released albums with 70-80 percent short(er) songs and one or two epic ones, it is the other way around these days since the reunion. \n\nNow this wouldn\u2019t have been a problem if all the long songs would\u2019ve had the same quality as, let\u2019s say, \u201cRime Of The Ancient Mariner\u201d, \u201cAfraid To Shoot Strangers\u201d, \u201cBlood Brothers\u201d or even \u201cThe Clansman\u201d. However most of the longer songs on this album aren\u2019t really all that epic. Some of them are actually sounding like overlong singles with stretched verses and (more obvious) stretched middle sections with numerous solos, breaks and melodies after which the band repeats a chorus once or twice again. It is starting to sound like stretching for the sake of stretching. I can\u2019t really think of any reason why they should do this, but they did. A song like \u201cThese Colours Don't Run\u201d simply would have been better about two minutes shorter at least. The chorus is a typical rock chorus that doesn\u2019t fit into a lengthy 7 minute epic.\n\nThe only lengthy song here that really has an epic feeling, is \u201cFor the Greater Good of God\u201d which stays interesting the full 9:24 minutes. Following closely is \u201cThe Longest Day\u201d which also is very entertaining. The song \u201cThe Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg\u201d is the only song on which one can find anything resembling a classic metal riff (the rest of the album is more about chords and melodies) and therefore sounds refreshing in the \u201cStranger In A Strange Land\u201d kind of way. The song however is \u2013 once again \u2013 overlong! Talking about the Somewhere in Time era, the chorus of \u201cLord Of light\u201d could have come straight from that period.\n\nThe point is that Harris, Smith and Dickinson used to write effective songs in the early days and this album sounds as if they went into a rehearsal room with just a few ideas and the whole band started jamming. I can imagine it being far more fun for the band doing it this way but a lot of the songs on this album could have been (and should have been) more to the point.\n\nWhat makes the compositional sloppiness more obvious is the production. Three guitarists is much but they pulled it off on Brave New World earlier. This time the guitar sound is a mess. It is foggy, messy and even extremely blurry at times. Some songs here could have done better with a more Piece Of Mind-Powerslave era crunchy dry sound or even the simplistic No Prayer For The Dying approach. The drums have never sounded good since the early nineties and they are flat once again. The vocals are too up front in the mix and sound too dry and un-produced. The balance is really missing, making the album sound like a live demo at times.\n\nAlso I really do dislike the cheesy chorus of \u201cOut of the Shadows\u201d. The song feels like a lesser annoying version of the hideous \u201cWasting Love\u201d (Fear Of The Dark, 1992) and I skip it each time. Maiden just shouldn\u2019t write these awful ballads anymore. The lyrics are okay though.\n\nNow I know it sounds as if I\u2019m totally bashing the album. But in the end it really is just a typical Maiden album and one would immediately recognise them. However it is one of their most dull and laid back ones and it cannot compete with the earlier Brave New World yet it is more consistent than Dance Of Death. The presence of \u201cThe Longest Days\u201d, \u201cBenjamin Breeg\u201d and \u201cFor the Greater Good of God\u201d however makes the album worth owning if you\u2019re a die-hard Maiden supporter. But please, put the balls back into Maiden next time!\n",
        "\nAfter the lackluster (to say the least) No Prayer for the Dying, Maiden returned with Fear of the Dark. While No Prayer was a 100% straight-forward album, Fear of the Dark is a bit different. Don't get me wrong, the majority of the songs of this record are also very simple and catchy, but the band attempted to create a more diverse record, with the inclusions of a ballad, Wasting Love, and some progressive numbers, in the vein of the band's past works (the title track, Afraid to Shoot Strangers). Anyways, the result was poor: this record lacks direction and, most of all, INSPIRATION.\n\nThe performances of the musicians aren't very good as well. Nicko McBrain is no longer delivering technical work, preferring to stay behind the band and play some uncreative beats, which add nothing new to the songs. Steve Harris' bass is pretty hard to hear some times and Dickinson sounds like he's trying to emulate Axl Rose or Brian Johnson, which is obviously a BAD thing. The guitar work is what saves this record from the realms of mediocrity; Gers and Murray play some good solos here and there, like the one on From Here to Eternity, and also some interesting riffs. Despite not being their best performance ever, when compared to the other's contributions, theirs is great.\n\nThe record begins, however, amazingly well with Be Quick or Be Dead, a song one million times better than the monotonous No Prayer for the Dying opener, Tailgunner; it features some very fast guitar and drum work. Hell, even Dickinson sounds great here, screaming like Halford in the beginning and with his rasping approach fitting greatly with the aggressive music. From Here to Eternity is another classic, a song that I don't understand why is so criticized by the other reviewers. Sure it sounds like AC/DC, but, hey, in the end it is catchy as hell with that awesome anthemic chorus; the solos are absolutely great too. I love the breakdown too, top notch material, no doubts. Afraid to Shoot Strangers is the last good song before the fillers intoxication, its main riff being the best Maiden ever wrote and the lyrics recalling the Seventh Son days, speaking about death and the meaning of life.\n\nAfter this track ends, be prepared because you'll be intoxicated with fillers, the first one being Fear is the Key, a plodding song that clocks at five painful minutes. Wasting Love is a poor attempt at a power ballad, although the intro sounds good (I especially like the bass line). The chorus is pretty repetitive though, despite the emotional Dickinson approach. The next three tracks probably form the worst trilogy of songs ever put into CD (or vynil) and I won't talk about them, I hope you never listen to those atrocities, for your own sake.\n\nNevertheless, there are two more songs on the record that are worth listening: the title track and Judas be my Guide. The latter is an average rocker that compared to songs like Weekend Warrior sounds like a masterpiece. The chorus is among the best of the album and the guitar intro is very good too. About the title track, it certainly is a good song, but not the fantastic tune that many say it is. It begins very softly, with some interesting guitar lines and Dickinson singing calmly. Then it progresses to a heavier part where Bruce sings the awesome chorus. This song is no Rime of the Ancient Mariner or Powerslave, but good in its own way. If you want to listen to the best version of Fear of the Dark, it's better to pick the live one, with the crowd interaction.\n\nAnyways, Iron Maiden absolutely were going through a bad time during the early 90's. After being criticized for the progressive approach they adopted while composing the Seventh Son of a Seventh Son album, the band tried to return to their more straight-forward period with No Prayer for the Dying, which was a big mistake, since that record is absolutely the worst ever made by this british group. Fear of the Dark is a huge step forward, there are some really good songs here, but, as I've already said, there are too many fillers and the whole listening experience is ruined because of that. It's better for you to ignore the record and create your own version of Fear of the Dark, with this tracklist:\n\n1.Be Quick or Be Dead\n2.From Here to Eternity\n3.Afraid to Shoot Strangers\n4.Childhood's End\n5.Wasting Love\n6.Judas Be My Guide\n7.Fear of the Dark\n\nJust seven tracks but, hey, why more, the record would sound much, much better if this was the chosen tracklist. Anyway, I totally understand why this album is so poor, since Maiden had already released tons of records and, you know, inspiration isn't endless! After the Fear of the Dark tour, Dickinson thankfully leaved the band and Blaize was hired for the job. Despite his low vocal range, I think that his addition in the band was very good, since he gave to the music a fresher and newer sound.\nSo, to summarize, this is one of the worst Maiden albums I've ever heard, but, hey, after the huge amount of classic records the act has released, the lack of creativity displayed here is understandable.\n\nBest Moments of the CD (yes, because there are some interesting moments, after all):\n-the beginning of the record - what an explosion of speed and aggression!\n-the breakdown of From Here to Eternity.\n-when the main heavy riff of Afraid to Shoot Strangers is played for the first time.\n\n50 points \u2013 Some great songs, but too many fillers. It's better not to listen to this record as a whole, select those seven songs and play them, forget about the others. That's my advice (I gave a positive rating just because of the existence of some really good songs. If that tracks weren't featured on the record, I would give a rating between the 20 and 30 points).\n",
        "\nI was too young to feel the blow to metalheads everywhere that was Bruce Dickinson leaving Iron Maiden in 1993, so I can't fully appreciate the comeback of Dickinson in 2000's \u201cBrave New World\u201d. However, that means I can review this album without bias. And it's a pretty damn good album.\n\nI can see how old-school Maiden fans who grew up with the band can react unfavorably to the \u201cnew\u201d Bruce. The vocals are soaring in this album, especially in songs such as \u201cOut Of The Silent Planet\u201d and \u201cDream Of Mirrors\u201d, among others. Compared to the pre-Blaze, post-Di'anno era of Iron Maiden, the vocals are much more mature, much more \u201cepic\u201d, and much more technical. Every Maiden fan has heard Bruce sing \u201cAces High\u201d on the \u201cLive After Death\u201d album/video, and I'm sure most of us cringed when we heard how Bruce half-assed it through parts of the song because he just couldn't hit those notes or hold them. That definitely isn't a problem on this album. This is probably the best Bruce's voice has been in any Maiden album, although it definitely took some time to get used to. \n\nThe songs themselves are mostly good. The Wicker Man is a great song; it harkens back to old, 80's-era Maiden. After that are a series of slower songs, but these are really where the band shines. \u201cGhost of the Navigator\u201d and especially \u201cBlood Brothers\u201d are slower, but more epic-sounding than most anything else by Maiden up to that point. This is definitely a slow album (and long) but in the end, it works for the band. The songs \u201cThe Mercenary\u201d and \u201cThe Wicker Man\u201d are probably the fastest on this album, but once again, it's perfect for the mindset of this album. The only qualm is that \u201cOut of the Silent Planet\u201d really takes too long to get going, and \u201cThe Thin Line Between Love And Hate\u201d is wholly forgettable.\n\nAs an Iron Maiden album, this is in the top half of albums. As one of the three albums Iron Maiden has made since the return of Bruce, this is probably right in the middle of the other two. It's a good album but it could have been better. But, damn, Bruce Dickinson sounds good here.\n",
        "\n... and that's why you should ignore the fanboys, because usually they're just a bunch of retards.\n\nIron Maiden is a very awkward band, because it would seem, that the majority of the fanbase doesn't see that the band has released several albums in years 1990 - 2000, and even if they do realise that, they usually yell nothing but rants about how \"awful\" that time is, and it seems that their hate is mostly focused upon Virtual XI, that I'm about to review.\n\nAnyway, let's start with the most obvious reason: the vocals. Bruce Dickinson, hero of the masses is not featured on this CD, he is replaced by Blaze Bayley, and here is why most of the fans whine: \"How can this be? Maiden without Bruce?\". Yes, Bruce is not here, get over it, but what is important, Bayley is doing a really fine performance really. His voice-range is balanced very well, and even though he isn't too keen on hitting some very spectacular notes, he also doesn't fall into repetition (at least too much, but I'll return to this later), the best example to that would be \"The Educated Fool\", some may call it a ballad, where Blaze introduces nice emotional vocal work, ranging from being calm (the first part) then going into aggression (\"or is it DEATH? is there ever anyway out?\"). Yet, in this track it comes out that he isn't good with the aforementioned high notes - in the chorus, he tries to sound melodic, but in reality he's just out of tune. In another song, the opening Futureal, Bayley is singing in a neat, fast style, also going through a well-made emotional structure.\n\nVocals aside, let's go to the rest:\nThe guitarwork is OK, nothing more, nothing less. There are some very nice riffs (in Futureal and The Clansman notably), unfortunately, there is a tiny lack of really outstanding soloes present in the album and the song structures themselves are rather simple, so maniacs of guitar mastery will probably be unsatisfied, yet after all, the performance is enjoyable. \n\nLet's start with the bad sides:\n\nLyrics are nothing particularly stunning, mostly they, are one might say, \"about nothing\" and they don't quite add too much to the overall feel. \n\nI previously mentioned repetition, there is one track here that should be 3 friggin minutes shorter and that track is \"The Angel and the Gambler\". After the 7th minute, it's basically nothing but Blaze repeating \"DON'T YOU THINK I CAN SAVE YOU\" over and over and over again, it also happens between the fourth and fifth minute, the only good thing about these moments is that we are served with some cool guitar soloes. Also \"Don't look to the eyes of a stranger\", even though the song itself is great, suffers from the \"let's repeat the chorus\" formula at the ending part.\n\nAnd for the last \"bad\" part of the album, I'd have to pinpoint the last song which sounds a bit fillerish.\n\nOf course, if it had only bad sides, I wouldn't give the score that big, so let's get the good sides.\n\nThe CD has a good atmosphere throughout. It stays a little dark (but, mind you, it's not grim or something), doesn't fall into being \"jolly as hell\", it's just keeping things cool (it's kind of good for evenings).\n\nThe songs are nearly all very catchy and pleasant to listen. Futureal is doing the job of a first track well, it's a nicely speedy song to start things up. The Educated Fool seems like a ballad at first, but raises the tempo later, and is a very varied piece of music, it features epic, aggressive, calm moments and you can feel that Blaze is very personally engaged in it (it's also pretty much the best song of the album I think). The Clansman and Two Worlds Collide are catchy as hell, and the first has a cool riff going through it (and I'm also quite positive that most people know this song only from Rock in Rio and would be like \"wtf\" if you told them it's from this album). Also, if not for the annoying \"LET'S REPEAT STUFF\" parts, Angel and the Gambler and Don't look to the Eyes of a Stranger would be top notch.\n\nOverall, this album even though has its downsides, it's nothing short of awesome. Also, it's made for Bayley and performed by Bayley, Dickinson just wouldn't fit into this album, and if someone tells you otherwise and states that \"liek this cd would be so much bettar with Bruce\", he's just dumb and you might as well throw that person over the window, because personally, I just can't quite imagine Dickinson doing the vocals for Futureal or Lightning Strikes Twice. Maybe, if this album was not introduced under the name of Iron Maiden, it wouldn't get so much hate it gets, but totally doesn't deserve.\n\nHighlights: Futureal, Two Worlds Collide, Educated Fool.\n",
        "\nPerhaps one of Maiden\u2019s greatest hits, Powerslave not only ranks as one of the band\u2019s best pieces of work but, perhaps one of the best albums in metal. So what makes this album so great? In the most straightforward terms, it has everything you could ask for. Soaring vocals, in depth lyrics, blazing solos, dueling riffs, grooving bass and hammering drums. You could be thrashing your brains out to a song like \u201cAces High\u201d while, appreciating the ingenious songcraft of \u201cRhyme of the Ancient Mariner\u201d. Here we see fusion many elements which propelled Maiden for the apex of their career. \n\nLyrically, the song themes you will come across are classic Maiden. Songs about battles and war are now completely encompassed by dog fighting in the air to classic sword fights. Pretty rare for a band to write about both types of warfare. Other songs include lyrics about Egyptian Mythology. This compliments the music 100% since Iron Maiden started to experiment with the harmonic minor scale which usually projects Middle Eastern sound. I hate it when the music does not blend with the words. Not an issue here. The harmony lines will simply blow you away. Two guitars truly prove to be better than one from the opening lick of the album all the way through the very end of the record. Trademark gallops, are at there pinnacle here as well. We see Adrian Smith with his bluesier, crunchy style perfect his style and finally become truly 50/50 with Dave Murray. Not that Dave\u2019s role has been diminished. You will still hear his legendary legato trills more than ever. Steve Harris is one of the best bassists in metal. Finally something I can hear. However, I must have noticed that his volume on his PAN must have been lowered because it does not have the same kick as Piece of Mind and certainly not of the first albums. (This is not a complaint but rather just something I noticed). With the unfortunate and sad departure of Clive Burr, Nicko McBrain makes his sophomore appearance. Bringing less of marchy feel he does not disappoint here. The album is loaded with fills at every 3 measures keeps your mind from wandering astray. Constructive criticism and let downs are at a minimal. In fact there is none.\n\nSo what separates the album and why the rating of 100%. Easy. The songs can be classified as epic stories or headbanging thrillers. For those who want to sit down and really listen deep in the song, you are not disappointed. For those who just want to go balls out and raise hell you are not disappointed. For those who just want to cruise with their buddies on the highway while listening to highway tunes you are not disappointed. It has the adaptability to appropriately conform to any environment. There are no fillers here. You can listen to every single song and really have every single one as a regular song on your IPOD. \n\nEven the cover is insanely awesome. It gives you the appropriate feel of the album while having bitching artwork to compliment the album. Eddie can be seen as a Pharaoh and a Mummy. (Eddie can be seen as a lot of people). \n\nHowever, these reasons still do not make this the greatest album of all time. Only this does. It symbolizes metal. Elements of power, thrash, progressive, heavy, even some black metal can be found here. Many influences for many years will look back at this album as a reference.\n\nIn the most layman\u2019s terms, this is why I got into metal. To hear a sophisticated style of music while still having fun. It is significant of me. \n\nMy personal favorite album, so no need to say that it gets a 100.\n\nSickest Songs \u201cAces High\u201d \u201c2 Minutes to Midnight\u201d \u201cThe Duelists\u201d \u201cPowerslave\u201d \u201cRhyme of the Ancient Mariner\u201d\n",
        "\nI remember being ecstatic at first hearing the news that the Maiden line-up that gave us \u201cNumber of the Beast\u201d and all the other great 80s albums associated with the better days of the band was going to reform. I also remember staking out the local CD store in West Chester Pennsylvania in early June during a summer session at college, anxious as hell to get myself a copy of the album that had given true metal its first slot on the Billboard Top 40 list in quite a while. In retrospect, if I had written a review for the album at that time, it would have been loaded with endless fan boy praise and worship loaded with all the complementary metaphors I could throw at the band. Although since that time my love for this album has moderated itself quite a bit, there is still much to be liked on here.\n\n\u201cBrave New World\u201d listens mostly like a continuation of the sound that began to manifest itself on \u201cThe X Factor\u201d, although there are some throwbacks to the later 80s material as well. For the most part, the songs tend to be long and loaded with atmosphere. Riffs tend to step aside to make room for melodic hooks, sectional development, and a lot of Bruce Dickinson blasting above the arrangement in a manner befitting of the air-raid siren. The 3 guitar arrangement gives the album a very dense feel, not so much in a heavy sense, but a thickness that is likely more characteristic of 70s progressive rock music.\n\nFor the most part, this album works the best when the songs don\u2019t break the 8 minute mark. Shorter, compact fast numbers like \u201cThe Wicker Man\u201d and \u201cThe Fallen Angel\u201d prove to stick in the memory the easiest, and finally bring back the hit making machine that is Adrian Smith to the fold. His solo offering on \u201cThe Wicker Man\u201d is the best lead put to a Maiden song since 1988, relying equally on flash and a developed storytelling approach to soloing. \u201cThe Mercenary\u201d has a solid main riff, but lags a tiny bit on the chorus, which is far too repetitive.\n\nAs the songs get longer, the influences shift away from the older Maiden to the free form compositional approach that was typical to Maiden\u2019s early 90s material with Bruce, but with a better vocal performance. \u201cThe Ghost of the Navigator\u201d and the title track are the most memorable and exciting of the bunch, although \u201cBlood Brothers\u201d doesn\u2019t ride too far behind and sports the most interesting string arrangement heard yet from the band. These songs also make a greater use of the 3 guitar format, utilizing varied accompanying guitar lines to fill out the background while the lead puts forth one of many variants on the classic \u201cFear of the Dark\u201d oriented melody.\n\nAs the songs get even longer it gets difficult to keep of track of where you are. \u201cOut of the Silent Planet\u201d is probably the most unlikely candidate for a single of any song on here, and I would argue that the abridged version used for the music video utterly destroys the song. The intro line sounds very similar to that classic keyboard intro that kicked off \u201cMoonchild\u201d, accompanied by a pair of acoustic guitars. Of all the songs I\u2019ve heard before the \u201cA Matter of Life and Death\u201d album, this is probably the most formally complex thing to every come out of Maiden. \n\nAfter this the songs get very Virtual XI sounding; and basically go on too long for their own good. Unfortunately, like many of the long numbers on that album, there is usually a ton of repetition and very little development. \u201cThe Dream of Mirrors\u201d just takes way too long to finally get going, and when it does, if you\u2019re still listening, it doesn\u2019t quite live up to what is expected for a 5 minute build up. The first half of \u201cThe Thin Line between Love and Hate\u201d is pretty solid, but then it just fizzles out at the end. If they cut the last 2 minutes off of this song, it would have been much better. \u201cThe Nomad\u201d also loses most of its punch about halfway through, and spends too much time in dreamland during the slow middle section. You can find bits and pieces of excellent ideas throughout it, but there is nothing that really holds it all together enough to make it worth 9 minutes of your time.\n\nAll in all, I would still venture to say that this is better than everything that the band offered up during the 1990s, but it\u2019s not quite the unrelenting classic that I had thought it would still listen as when I first heard it. The best parts of this are usually where Adrian Smith is running the show, which is the way I remember it being back in the mid-80s when this band was at its peak. Prospective buyers are encouraged to pick up \u201cDance of Death\u201d and \u201cA Matter of Life and Death\u201d before getting this one, mostly because they are much more consistent listens. Like with all metal reunions, things often start off slow, but given enough time the old beast re-emerges to reclaim its crown.\n",
        "\nAfter the roaring \"Killers\", Maiden came up with what is often considered their magnum opus. And I can tell you that this is partially true. This is indeed Maiden's perhaps most classic album, but at the same time I like \"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\" better. After \"Killers\" and the following world tour, Paul Di'Anno left the band because he apparently didn't like the fame he was getting. A lot of fans were in doubt whether another front man could live up to his tenor with Maiden. But then nobody counted on Bruce Dickinson, did they? You could say that Maiden's sound completely changed when Bruce entered the picture. His vocal style is quite operatic and far removed from the punkish overtones that Paul had. This would also mark the end for Clive Burr.\n\nThe production is mostly excellent. Both the rhythm and lead guitar tracks have a lot of crunch and a metallic overtone. The bass is very up front. The only complaint would be about the drum sound, since it almost sounds like Clive is beating on a pair of buckets sometimes.\n\nSo the album begins with a riotous speed metal number called \"Invaders\". It's probably one of Maiden's most underrated openers even though the vocal/guitar combination during the chorus sounds slightly awkward. But aside from that little mistake there's nothing wrong with this song. \n\n\"Children of the Damned\" is my favourite song from this album. It begins quite slowly and doomy, but later turns into quite a fast track with excellent guitar and vocal melodies. \n\nThe next two songs were fan favourites that never really made it beyond that status; \"The Prisoner\" and \"22 Acacia Avenue\". \"The Prisoner\" starts off with a spoken intro from the TV series of the same name before a recognisable drum beat from Clive initiates the song. It's quite a fast track with some great melodies. My only gripe about this track is that the chorus is a bit repetitive. \"22 Acacia Avenue\" is quite a long and progressive song for being about a whore (!). The intro guitar riff is very simplistic, but works really well. There's not much more to say about this song.\n\nAnd the following two songs are all time metal classics that I don't think I have to say much about. \"The Number of the Beast\" with its lyrics, guitar solos and chorus, along with the galloping rhythm and catchy licks of \"Run to the Hills\".\n\n\"Gangland\" is, along with \"Invaders\", the song that gets classified as fillers by most people. I kind of agree with that, but this one is a really good filler. A quite jazzy drum beat gives way to a very simplistic but catchy and quite heavy riff. The only thing wrong with this song is that it's slightly repetitive and not quite up to par with the rest.\n\n\"Total Eclipse\" is a slow, epic and heavy track. The lyrics are the main driving force behind this song. The guitar solos and the ending part are probably the song's highlights.\n\nAnd so the album comes to an end with the epic metal classic called \"Hallowed Be thy Name\". There's so much I could say about this song, but I think most of the other reviewers have already said enough about this.\n",
        "\nSo, here we have \"Eddie's Archive\", a boxed set released on the market in 2002 in limited copies. I was lucky enough to get ahold of a copy of it through a website, but let's focus more on the content, shall we?\n\nThe content on this boxed set is more than you could ever ask. Well, maybe you could ask for b'sides of rarely played songs, but the pure quantity and quality of the material on display here makes up for it. And not to mention the extra bonus items such as the family tree, the ring and the glass that's bound to make yourself knock up a shot or two while listening to this.\n\nAnd so the first CD on offer here is called \"BBC Archives\", and is basically made up of rare recordings from several events in the band's history. We are treated with a set of recordings from the Friday Rock Show sessions, which must be impossible to get ahold of outside of this box set. And what follows is recordings from the 1980 and 1982 Reading Festivals, and finally the CD is rounded off nicely with a set of songs performed on Donington in 1988 which includes gems such as \"Moonchild\", \"Infinite Dreams\" and \"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\". The only minor complaint is that some songs are featured more than once on this CD, and ends up becoming a bit repetitive in the end\n\nThe second CD is entitled \"Beast Over Hammersmith\", which is a full live album released 20 years after its recording. This is the best CD in the set IMO. This could have been a legendary live album if it had been released earlier. The short parody of a The Police song in the middle of \"Drifter\" is also good fun.\n\nAnd finally we come to an end with the third CD, which is called \"Best of the B'Sides\". The artwork for this CD is absolutely hilarious, as are some of the songs such as \"Nodding Donkey Blues\" and \"Sheriff of Huddersfield\". But there are also some live recordings featured, and some of which are quite rare. Quite simply, listen to the CD if you're feeling for a laugh or if you want to listen to rare live recordings that you can otherwise only find on youtube\n\nBuy this set if you can get ahold of it, okay? Especially if you're a sucker for exclusive stuff.\n",
        "\nAfter \"Fear Of The Dark\" (1992) Bruce Dickinson left the band to pursuit his solo career. He was replaced by a guy called Blaze Bayley who had been earlier in a band called Wolfsbane. And Maiden came up with an album that is hated by many fans, but I like this albums. At least this is better than any other 90's Maiden album.\n\nMusic on \"The X Factor\" is a lot more darker than anything Maiden had done before or after. Which is in a way a good thing, because in my opinion Blaze Bayley's voice fits well into more darker music. Also music on this album is a lot more harder to approach than anything they have done before. As there is a lot less hooks and many of the songs are more progressive, good example would be the song \"Sign of the Cross\".\n\nThe main problem with \"The X Factor\" for me is that the songs are uneven in quality. There is some amazing songs and one ok song (\"Lord of the Flies\"), and rest of the songs are either mediocre or bad. Many people has a problem with Blaze Bayley's singing style as it is so much different from Bruce Dickinson's singing style. He's not really a bad singer, but it was a small shock when I first heard his voice as I was waiting that they would have gotten someone who's voice would have been similar to Bruce's voice. But after few listens I started to get used to he's voice.\n\nAlthough \"The X Factor\" is far away from a perfect album I will still recommend this to most of the Iron Maiden fans, as this is still an solid album. Just don't wait that \"The X Factor\" would be another \"Piece of Mind\" or \"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\".\n\nHighlights: \"Sign of the Cross\", \"Man on the Edge\", \"Fortunes of War\", \"Judgement Of Heaven\", \"Blood On The World's Hand\" and \"The Edge Of Darkness\".\n",
        "\nThe Blaze Bayley years of Iron Maiden have always been a point of contention for most of the band\u2019s older fan base. Blaze\u2019s voice is simply not suited for NWOBHM music, because he doesn\u2019t have the necessary range and the kind of power in the upper range that he does possess to match the arrangements. As best I can tell he would be most suited for a traditional doom outfit similar to Trouble or early 70s Black Sabbath. On the X Factor, some great songwriting helped to hide Blaze's limitations as a singer, but here we don't have nearly as much great music to smooth out this rather rough edge.\n\nAlthough not nearly as long-winded as its predecessor, we have some rather long tracks in \"The Angel and the Gambler\" and \"The Clansman\", both of which break the 9 minute barrier. On previous Maiden albums the epic tracks would tend to battle each other for prominence, which as the reason why the better Maiden releases of the 80s usually had one dominant epic, while other longer numbers would be considerably shorter and less complex. Here, the former is an overly repetitive quasi-rock tune that has more in common musically with \"From Here to Eternity\" than the more anthem-based and complex epics that usually run this long. If 3 1/2 minutes of needless repeats of one part were taken out, I could actually listen to and enjoy this song. By complex contrast, \"The Clansman\" is the strongest track on here, containing the atmospheric elements that helped define classic epics such as \"Afraid to Shoot Strangers\" and \"The Sign of the Cross\". \n\nAmong the shorter tracks on here, the results range from adequate to pretty damned lousy. \"Futureal\" is a fast track with a catchy set of guitar riffs that almost sound like they were left over from the \"Seventh Son\" sessions, it\u2019s fun but it doesn\u2019t really stick with you. \"Lightning Strikes Twice\" is a shorter epic that contains some nice lead work by Dave Murray, but a rather poor vocal performance by Bayley, for some reason he can't hit that high B without his voice falling apart.\n\nOf the remaining tracks, \"Educated Fool\" and \"When Two Worlds Collide\" have some decent moments, but way overlong and under-developed. \"Como Estais Amigos\" is a stupid ballad that I can't tolerate for more than a minute, as unfortunately Janick Gers' compositions are hit or miss, as is even the case with their post-90s releases. \"Don't look to the Eyes of a Stranger\" meanders like crazy, and the tempo drags so much that it makes 8 minutes seem like 30. \n\nThis is the weakest album Maiden has ever put out, and it is not merely Blaze\u2019s fault, but a collective failure on all sides. Steve Harris managed to write one classic song and Dave Murray\u2019s lead playing salvages some of the otherwise mediocre filler, aside from that there is basically nothing but unmemorable melodies and meandering interludes. If you really want to hear this for 1 great song and maybe 2 passable songs, I'd suggest looking for this release second hand at $5 or less.\n",
        "\nThough usually the favorite whipping boy of most Maiden faithful, this album does have a few champions, and I am one of them. It might just be that the music that I was exposed to in 1995 left so much to be desired that this was a sort of metal music sanctuary for me, but even in retrospect I still find a lot of positive points on here. I can admit that Blaze Bailey was obviously the worst choice that Maiden could have gone with if their goal was to maintain the same sound most expected, especially considering that they could have gone with James LaBrie, whom I often picture singing \u201cSign of the Cross\u201d when listening to it. But aside from that and a guitar sound that sounds more 70s rock-like that the metal crunch of the mid-80s, the album offers up an intriguing and enjoyable collection of songs.\n\nThe lyrics have clearly gotten darker, especially considering the 4 books/movies that Steve Harris chose to write songs about on this one: \"The Name of the Rose\" probably being the least dark and \"Heart of Darkness\" is thus the most morose, while \"Lord of the Flies\" and \"Falling Down\" meet in the center. Meanwhile songs such as \u201cBlood on the World\u2019s Hands\u201d, \u201cThe Aftermath\u201d and \u201cFortunes of War\u201d paint a rather cynical picture of the world. \u201cLook for the Truth\u201d, \u201cJudgment of Heaven\u201d and \u201c2 AM\u201d deal with more individualized forms of turmoil from within. \u201cThe Unbeliever\u201d rounds out the equation of darkness with a completely self-condemning group of verses. Ultimately the problem lyrically rests not with any misplaced words, but with the sheer lack of variety in themes.\n\nMusically the bag is quite mixed, as this album can be diagnosed with a strong case of Borderline Personality Syndrome with a dash of Bi-polar Disorder, though quite fitting considering the lyrical content. \u201cSign of the Cross\u201d and \u201cFortunes of War\u201d are quite impressive epics that underscore Steve Harris\u2019 strength as a composer. \u201cLord of the Flies\u201d and \u201cMan on the Edge\u201d are great straight-forward rockers. \u201cBlood on the World\u2019s Hands\u201d sees Steve blasting out a very impressive bass solo by an almost progressive barrage of hard edged riffs. \u201cThe Edge of Darkness\u201d and \u201cThe Unbeliever\u201d are gloomy epics that carry some unique formal devices. The remaining 4 tracks are musically mediocre; if I had to pick a favorite out of them it would probably be \u201c2AM\u201d. \n\nThough I liked this album, I would not recommend it to most other fans of Iron Maiden. This album suffers from a very obvious flaw, despite its musical intrigue; the wrong kind of vocalist is singing these songs. All you need do is hear the way Blaze\u2019s voice breaks when he goes above the high A and you know that he is not right for this style of metal. If James LaBrie had done the singing, I could easily recommend this album to as a fine innovation by a classic band. But if you do not have any reservations about listening to a Maiden album without Bruce Dickinson, I welcome you to give this diamond in the rough a try. It might be controversial to say this, but of their 90s studio material this is musically the most consistent album they put out.\n",
        "\nSo, we've got The Trooper. We've all heard The Trooper. We all (sort of) enjoy The Trooper. But we're probably sick of The Trooper. Every live album since Piece of Mind has had The Trooper, as well as every (I think) compilation. But I'm gonna go back in time and review this song (as well as the accompanying cover) as if it were a fresh thing for me.\n\nThe Trooper has some really recognizable riff structure. Nice trills, good note-crawling riffs. It's almost a thrash song, about as close as Maiden really tries to get. Musically, it's a mind-blower, I must stress it. The drums are nice and audible, good fills, showing that Nicko will forever chang the beat behind the band from the day he arrived. Bass line are fairly complicated as far as fills go, but much of the verses and chorus lines are thrown into the standard \"Harris Gallop\" where he makes 3 notes work on an entire verse. Good stuff, but other than the independent intro riff, and some of the solo, nothing to finger-melting.\n\nThe joint solos seem to follow the standard for this period of Maiden. Not quite as great as what was to come on Powerslave, but still great. If you listen to the album in it's whole, it would seem as if the guitars were trying to make similar patterns throughout, and basically tie together all the leadwork. Like I said, it's a good start, and will improve as time marches on.\n\nThe vocals... Bruce really knocks it up a notch (Bam!) on the new album, and no song proves it like The Trooper does. The high-flying wails and vibrating lows are all dramatic and powerful, fitting the song. Good stuff, a great cohesive song.\n\nNow... Cross-Eyed Mary. Jethro Tull was a great band, and there is alot of proof (especially if you listen to Steve Harris talk) that Jethro Tull influenced Iron Maiden in a profound way. So, this is a fitting cover, as it's one of the Tull songs that displays the bands ties to heavy metal in later years.\n\nThe flute solo at the beginning is replaced with guitars, and definitely has the maiden sound... clanky bass, guitar trebeled to maximum sharpness, drums patterned strangely in the Nicko standard. The vocals, I think, are actually overdone. Sad to say it, but Bruce gives it a little too much. Almost as if he was trying too hard to 'make it their own' as many bands try to do with covers. The song is faster than the original, and if you haven't heard said original, you would probably fall in love with this song. I was duly biased by my love for Tull's version.\n\nAll together this single is worth buying if you get a chance, mostly for the cover song. Also, for completist value. However, if you aren't a Maiden collecter, the b-side can be found on a later boxset, saving you the trouble of tracking down all the single issues.\n",
        "\nThis is probably Maiden's most controversial album to date, save for perhaps \"Virtual XI\". And this is for many reasons. First of all, Bruce Dickinson had left the band, and how were they gonna be able to find a vocalist to match him? They probably knew that it was futile to search for someone of Bruce's caliber, so they went in the complete opposite direction instead, and hired ex-Wolfsbane singer Blaze Bayley. Now, Bayley's voice is very different from Bruce's voice. His voice is darker and deeper than Bruce's is, and he sometimes has trouble with a shaky pitch. But apart from that, Blaze was probably the best replacement the band could ever find. And second of all, Steve Harris had been subjected to a wide variety of chaotic events in his private life that was undoubtedly going to have some effect on the band, and the effects are widely visible in the lyrics on this album. But perhaps this album's biggest detractions are the production, which I will get to later, and the fact that the album isn't very riff-laden judging by Maiden standards. But apart from those small detractions, it's an excellent album IMO.\n\nI said I would get on to the production later. And it's like a double edged sword. The drums pack quite some punch, especially in the toms, even though the snare is a little flat. The bass is pretty much as upfront as it can be in Maiden. And then the guitars. Oh boy, what the hell went wrong here? The rhythm guitars sound like they could belong on a hard rock album rather than a heavy metal one, but thankfully the lead guitar tracks pack more crunch.\n\nAnd so the album begins with \"Sign of the Cross\", an epic track almost just as long as \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\". The band surely must have known that starting up the album with an 11 minute long track would be a huge risk, but they still had the balls to do it. The start of the song is composed of some nice Gregorian chants that seem to say \"Aeternus halleluiah\" or something like that. And after the chants a long but conscious build up begins before the song erupts into midtempo br00tality with Blaze singing his lungs out. The solos may also be one of Maiden's fastest solos ever.\n\n\"Lord of the Flies\" is an instant winner with an instantly recognisable riff, a catchy chorus and insightful lyrics. I also think that Blaze sings this song way better than what Bruce did on the \"Death On the Road\" live album from 2005.\n\n\"Man On the Edge\" is probably the album's fastest song. There's nothing really special about it, but it's very catchy.\n\nAnd after two recognisable Maiden anthems we get to slower tracks. \"Fortunes of War\" is the first one. It's another song with a long build up consisting acoustic guitars and so on. But then it turns into quite a Black Sabbath-esque song with guitar solos that inject feelings of despair and sadness.\n\n\"The Aftermath\" is another recognisable song with a very distinctive intro. This song also contains a nice speed/thrash metal part that's bound to get you pounding your fists in the air.\n\n\"Judgement of Heaven\" is a pretty sad but at the same time kind of uplifting song with a strong message. It contains some of Blaze's finest moments, but also one of his worst in the form of the out-of-tune \"Yeah, yeah!\" screams.\n\n\"Blood On the World's Hands\" begins with a nice extended acoustic bass solo which sets up the atmosphere of the track excellently. It has a rhythm that somewhat reminds me of a walz, which is another distinctive trait. The guitar solos also work very well.\n\nAnd so the speed picks up on us in \"The Edge of Darkness\", a song based on the Joseph Conrad novel called \"The Heart of Darkness\" which I am currently reading. It begins slowly just like the majority of songs on this album, but don't worry, cause this is indeed a fast track. It contains some of the finest guitar solos and drumming on this album and a really fucking nice main riff.\n\n\"The Unbeliever\" is a slow but at the same time pounding song. It might be a bit repetitive in structure, but the strong and harsh lyrics make up for it, believe me. And the chorus is another catchy one.\n\nAnd finally we are left with only two tracks that IMO can be classified as filler; \"Look for the Truth\" and \"2 AM\". They are not bad by any means IMO, I just don't think they're as strong as the rest. \"Look for the Truth\" has a similar intro to \"The Aftermath\", or perhaps it's the other way around since \"Look for the Truth\" precedes \"The Aftermath\". The problem with the song is that it doesn't go anymore, and \"2 AM\" suffers from the same problem. But both songs feature some really nice melodies.\n\nBuy this album if you want a different taste of what Maiden can be.\n",
        "\nIt was 1983 when Iron Maiden released their fourth album, Piece of Mind. Up until this point, Maiden were undeniably one of the better bands to come out of the NWOBHM movement, with their strong bass-heavy rhythms, their harmonized guitar tag team, and a powerful vocalist to lead the way. But it was with Piece of Mind that they really stepped up to the plate and cemented their status as \u201cLegendary.\u201d For it was with PoM that they really upped their \u201cepicness,\u201d so to speak, with even more of the band\u2019s great songwriting and the best lyrics in the business. \n\nThere\u2019s little point in going over most of these songs, as everyone knows them already. Anthems like \u201cThe Trooper,\u201d \u201cFlight of Icarus,\u201d and \u201cWhere Eagles Dare\u201d have been staples in the band\u2019s live show for decades, featuring all the elements that people look for in this band. Soaring vocals, melodic solo duels, an unconquerable sense of harmony: these things a good Maiden album make. This is the first album with the so-called classic line-up, with drummer Nicko McBrain the last to be recruited in replacement of Clive Burr. His addition is welcome, and everyone else has improved over the last album, most notably Bruce Dickinson vocally and Steve Harris (whose bass is not overwhelming as on their previous album).\n\nOne particular aspect of this album that I find important is the heightened emphasis on lyrical storytelling, an aspect that would become standard on Maiden\u2019s future albums. Not that they couldn\u2019t tell a good story before: songs like \u201cProdigal Son,\u201d \u201cHallowed Be Thy Name,\u201d and \u201cPhantom of the Opera\u201d prove they always could. But it\u2019s here that every song gets equal treatment. From the somber tale featured in \u201cRevelations\u201d (the spiritual successor to \u201cProdigal Son\u201d musically), the chilling and oft overlooked \u201cStill Life,\u201d the wartorn \u201cThe Trooper\u201d and the epic \u201cTo Tame a Land,\u201d Piece of Mind features some of the band\u2019s most compelling lyrics, brought home true and direct by the mighty voice of Bruce Dickinson. \n\nAnd with not a weak song (though both \u201cQuest of Fire\u201d and \u201cSun and Steel\u201d always come off as filler material, they\u2019re actually much more interesting than some of their past filler tracks (like \"Gangland\" for instance). And it\u2019s not like either are long enough to get boring\u2026.) on the album, PoM is one of the more potent examples of Iron Maiden\u2019s always having been a more consistent band than Judas Priest. A must-own, but then again, most people reading this probably already do.\n",
        "\nIt is an indisputable FACT that the mighty Iron Maiden were, are, and will continue to be one of the most influential, consistent and important heavy metal groups in the entirety of heavy metal. Their career is a long, industrious one exemplifying all the best characteristics of dedicated workmanship that have become synonymous with all the greatest metal bands, and it is also a career that has yielded some truly brilliant albums in the course of the genre\u2019s history.\nNone more so, in this reviewer\u2019s humble view, than 1982\u2019s legendary \u2018The Number Of The Beast\u2019 \u2013 an album that truly deserves the accolade of \u201ceveryone should own a copy\u201d, an album that has come to define all of the elements that have become quintessential to modern metal culture. This album, fellow metalheads, is the stuff of legend.\n\n\u2018The Number Of The Beast\u2019 is perhaps less of a defining moment for Iron Maiden than it is for heavy metal at large \u2013 Maiden are a band who have always been willing to expand and experiment over reliance upon the same old sound. Here, we find a band shrugging off the vague punkish overtones of \u2018Iron Maiden\u2019 and \u2018Killers\u2019, crafting a masterwork in high speed, balls-of-steel power featuring some of the most important and universally known songs in heavy metal.\nFor starters, the album itself is a wonder to look at \u2013 whether on CD or vinyl, Derek Riggs\u2019 iconic depiction of zombie mascot Eddie towering above a scene of demonic carnage embeds itself in the brain instantaneously. Everything about the album as a package \u2013 the logo, the spot on album title and the infamous song titles \u2013 all serve to engage the listener\u2019s attention in a vice grip that they won\u2019t want to be relinquished.\n\nThe songs have become archetypes of the genre and anthems to generations of metalheads, and rightly so. While the likes of \u2018Gangland\u2019 and \u2018Total Eclipse\u2019 are admittedly somewhat forgettable, the sheer quality of the majority of the album renders this the most infinitesimal of gripes. Opener \u2018Invaders\u2019 is a fantastically over-the-top work of striding riffs and ridiculously cheesy lyrical conceits, complemented perfectly by \u2018Children Of The Damned\u2019, one of the best songs of a more mellowed bent that Maiden have ever written. \nFan favourite \u201922 Acacia Avenue\u2019 is a powerful headbanging exercise, but it is at the midpoint where the twin hammer blows of the record are delivered, and at the close of the record the piece de resistance: \u2018Number Of The Beast\u2019, \u2018Run To The Hills\u2019 and closer \u2018Hallowed Be Thy Name\u2019 remain three of the greatest songs in metal\u2019s entire history, featuring some of the most unforgettable riffs, blazing solos and anthemic lyrics of all time, capable of raising devil horns in salute every time they touch mortal ears. The title track may just be one of the greatest songs ever conceived, with its spine-tingling refrain of \u201c666! The Number Of The Beast!\u201d a masterpiece of lyrical craftsmanship.\n\nAs a unit, Maiden here are on the top of their game. While they arguably would be given a greater edge in recent years with the use of triple guitar players, here the dual harmonies and galloping riffs of Adrian Smith and Dave Murray get the job done and done damn well. Clive Burr provides a backbone of steel with impeccable drum work, never overdoing anything and making every cymbal crash and rolling fill count. Bruce Dickinson and Steve Harris, for their part, should be given highest honours for their work here \u2013 Harris\u2019 complex, driving bass lines are a joy to listen to, as is Dickinson\u2019s human air-raid siren of a voice, a voice that puts in absolutely career-defining performance here. All of these elements combine into a tightly cohesive force to be reckoned with.\n\nIn terms of the sound of \u2018Number...\u2019, Martin Birch\u2019s production is a stellar work. Crisp and sharp, all the instruments ring out clearly without intruding upon the other and all retaining their own power. Burr\u2019s drum hit with full vim and vigour, the riffs are suitably meaty and heavy whilst never becoming too overbearing, and Bruce\u2019s vocals fit comfortably amongst everything. While the bass\u2019 prominent position seems to cause contention, ultimately Harris\u2019 superb proficiency on his instrument renders this argument somewhat impotent.\n\n\u2018The Number Of The Beast\u2019 is without a word of exaggeration one of the greatest heavy metal records of all time \u2013 one that continues to enthral now and will no doubt do so for decades to come, so it is crucial to metal\u2019s entire development and growth. This, fellow metalheads, is one of the records that no collection is truly complete without.\n",
        "\nWhile often associated with other parts of the largely forgettable 90s Maiden catalog, \u201cFear of the Dark\u201d carries a similar sense of commercial viability to its incredibly lackluster predecessor \u201cNo Prayer for the Dying\u201d, yet lacks a good deal of the problems the former had. The production has been cleaned up considerably, particularly the drums, and almost becomes too slick for its own good. And although the songwriting is still a considerable step down from the songwriting glory days of the late 1980s, there is actually a considerable collection of quality material on here.\n\nBruce\u2019s vocals are still rough and throaty, but he makes better use of this newfound style and the music mostly conforms to it. \u201cBe Quick or be Dead\u201d and \u201cJudas be my Guide\u201d are the closest to what could be considered speed metal in the context of Maiden\u2019s 90s sound, and between the melodic riffs and the shouted and over-the-top operatic bursts from Dickinson, a fun and memorable result is born. Likewise, slower versions of this can be heard in the arena friendly rocker \u201cFrom Here to Eternity\u201d (the 4th installment of the Charlotte the Harlot saga) and the quasi-epic film homage \u201cThe Fugitive\u201d.\n\nNaturally there are still some bad holdovers from the last album that worm their way into the mix, either sporting goofy lyrics, over-repeated ideas, or musical misfires. \u201cChildhood\u2019s End\u201d has some solid musical ideas, but suffers from over-repetition and a halfcocked vocal delivery. Likewise, \u201cFear is the Key\u201d has a solid main riff, but goes on too long and goes through an off-the-cuff tempo change with a silly sounding vocal ad lib section. \u201cWeekend Warrior\u201d and \u201cThe Apparition\u201d are both decrepit outtakes from heavy metal comedy hour, their so cheesy sounding and musically comical that they induce laughter on first listen, but repeated listens might draw you to shake your head and wonder what the hell they were thinking.\n\nBut on the whole, this opus delivers some good listening material and a few classics worthy of a greatest hits compilation. If I had to pick two of the best representations of Maiden\u2019s 90s material, they would come from this album. The title track is an obvious favorite live song; say what you will about the constant repetition and overly formulaic background music, the principle theme just never leaves you once you\u2019ve heard it. Likewise, although the slow narrative section in the first 1/3 of the song drags on, \u201cAfraid to Shoot Strangers\u201d delivers one of the most dramatic interchanges of thematic material and guitar majesty to be heard circa 1992.\n\nIf you take this album all the way through, it is quite flawed and could only be qualified as good rather than great. But individually several songs on here shine like true diamonds in the rough. Although perhaps not the greatest thing that Bruce could have left us with before his 8 year hiatus, it is a strong constellation that we were left with this rather than what immediately preceded it. It is a good entry level album for a classic rock fan looking to ease his way into the NWOBHM sound, and it is worthy of, although far from equal to the 80s Iron Maiden that most have come to know and love.\n",
        "\nAfter 12 years of owning this, Maiden\u2019s 8th studio effort, I still have a hard time believing that this album has 4 out of the 5 same guys that gave us \"Somewhere in Time\" and \"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\". There are a few good songs on here, but the vast majority of the songs are completely uninspired. In some cases the music kills the song, in other cases the lyrics do, and in the case of \"Holy Smoke\", you reach for the CD player and fling it clear out the window. The production is not up to par with previous efforts, as it lacks the punch of the earlier stuff, and also the luster of the more epic music that followed. \n\nAs far as the various members pulling their share, it should be noted that Janick Gers is an excellent guitar player, technically he is probably better than Adrian Smith was, however he doesn\u2019t write songs nearly as well. He and Dave Murray get the job done as far as leads go, but, regardless to what Kurt Cobain may have said, solos do not alone make a song good metal. Steve Harris\u2019 bass playing is still as technically intricate as ever, but unfortunately his songwriting is not as consistent on this album. Nicko\u2019s drumming is pretty much par for the course, although the dry, dead sounding production drags the sound of his kit down severely.\n\nThe overriding problem with this release is even more overt than the lack of songwriting prowess, and that is Bruce Dickinson\u2019s vocals. They are extremely scratchy and inconsistent, at times becoming almost unbearable. The worst case is probably \u201cHoly Smoke\u201d, although even a good song like the title track suffers from Bruce\u2019s seeming inability to hit a clean note. \u201cMother Russia\u201d escapes much of this because Bruce is barely singing, and when singing he is doing so with a voice that you can discern some actual pitch quality from. \n\nThe lyrics also do their share to drag this troubled opus down. With perhaps the exceptions of the title track and Mother Russia, the best route is to not think about what you're singing along with, particularly if you are a Maiden fan that feels obligated to own and regularly play their entire catalog. Amongst the worst offenders in the lyrical department, \"Holy Smoke\", \"Tail Gunner\" and \"Public Enema Number One\" take the cake, with the misfire of a 3rd part to the Charlotte the Harlot series \"Hooks in You\" not far behind. \n\nThe music behind the antics masquerading as words and singing is mostly a mixed bag. Songs like \"Fates Warning\" and \"Run Silent, Run Deep\" have several inspired moments, but they don't cross over into being spectacular. \"The Assassin\" has some interesting riffs but it gets repetitive after the first 2 minutes. \"Tail Gunner\" and \"Public Enema Number One\" both have pretty good intros, but don't really go anywhere. \"Bring Your Daughter to the Slaughter\" sounds like a knockoff of an AC/DC song from the early 80s. I don't loathe it quite as much as most others do, but it doesn't fit into the Maiden sound. And as far as \"Holy Smoke\" goes, unless you like bad, quasi-punk pop mixed with 80s metal, hit the skip button.\n\nIf the goal was to bring their music to a younger audience that wanted a dry sound with half-assed socially conscious lyrics, Maiden succeeded royally here. Musically, it\u2019s a collective failure for all in congress, as even Adrian Smith\u2019s lone compositional offering before jumping ship \u201cHooks in You\u201d reeks of rock/metal mediocrity. This album sold well, and it featured the band\u2019s only number one single. It is a testament to what the mainstream was demanding of metal at the time and why it ultimately went back underground. If you are someone who likes buying albums for two decent songs tracks, some mediocre filler, and a fair amount of crap, or if you worship Iron Maiden blindly and think they can do no wrong, I would recommend looking for a copy at $4 max\n",
        "\n\"Every Maiden album has too many fillers that ruin the listening experience\". \nOne month ago I thought like that. The Number of the Beast has Gangland and Invaders, Seventh Son has The Prophecy and Only the Good Die Young, Piece of Mind has Quest for Fire and Sun and Steel, Powerslave has Flash of the Blade and The Duellists... \nTwo weeks ago, I gave another chance to Powerslave and, oh my God, I was terribly wrong about this album: it has no fillers at all! From the beginning to the end, this record is (almost) flawless. This is the peak of Iron Maiden's career, undoubtely. \n\nThe guitar work is the most brilliant aspect of Powerslave: Adrian Smith and Dave Murray form a fantastic team and they deliver an amazing performance. All the guitar solos are absolutely stunning, from the fast one on Aces High to the calm one on the title track. The riffs are also amazing and very memorable. The main riffs of Flash of the Blade and Two Minutes to Midnight are among the best of the record. However, they show their real virtuosity on the middle part of The Duellists: just listen to it, all the riffs on it are amazing and so are the solos. \n\nNicko McBrain, the drummer, delivers a very consistent performance too. As all the songs are relatively fast, he plays in a very dynamic and efficient way. In fact, he doesn't play ultra-technic patterns, he prefers to stay behind the guitars and play relatively simple but very memorable beats (listen to the first one on Flash of the Blade, believe me, it's very catchy). \n\nThe vocals are another highlight of the record. Bruce Dickinson shows his great talent on every song, especially on Aces High, where he delivers an amazing vocal performance. However, I miss his whispers - he does that a lot on A Matter of Life and Death. Nevertheless, this is one of his best performances ever. He also proves to be an excellent songwriter: he penned two of the best songs of the record: Aces High (with Adrian Smith) and the title track. \nThe bass work is audible (kudos to the great production!) and excellent. Steve Harris is an amazing player and songwriter: he composed many of the tracks of this record, including the fantastic epic Rime of the Ancient Mariner. \n\n\nAs I've already said, all the songs are pretty fast and energic, so don't expect ballads on this record. At the same time, you should neither expect a typical heavy metal album full of straight-forward songs, that follow the same structure. Almost every track is relatively complex, with lenghty instrumental sections and some breakdowns here and there. \n\nIt's very hard for me to name stand-outs: all the songs are very good. \nThe first one, Aces High, is one of my favourite Iron Maiden songs and it is very fast. 2 Minutes to Midnight needs no presentation, as it is one of the greatest Maiden classics. An amazing anthem with a very cool breakdown. \n\nAnd now, I'll review the middle section of the record, which seem to annoy many people. \"It's full of fillers!\" they say. Meh, such a lie. \nLosfer Words is a decent and solid instrumental song, but definitely not a filler. \nFlash of the Blade is an underrated track. It opens with one of the best guitar riffs I've ever heard; then, the drums and the bass join the guitars and Bruce begins to sing. The chorus is extremely catchy and after it comes an extremely good instrumental section. The guitar riff that begins is very good and the solo is pretty decent. After a while, Dickinson sings \u2013 again - the fantastic chorus, the first riff is played and the song ends. Very good track. \n\nThen, you have no time to breathe. McBrain hits the snare and The Duellists kicks off. This is the third best song of the record and that is saying something. The chorus is also catchy and the instrumental section is even better than the one on the previous track. The song is pretty fast and the lyrics fit well the music, as they talk about a fight between two, err, duellists. \nBack in the Village is the worst track of the record, but it isn't that bad actually, there are some very good riffs here and there. \n\nSo, how can you people call those tracks fillers? Okay, Back in the Village is a bit weak, but isn't horrible; Losfer Words is a nice song, Flash of the Blade and The Duellists are some of the most underrated Maiden tunes ever! \n\nThen, we reach the last two songs. Well, those two are real masterpieces. \nThe title track is the heavier song of the record, thanks to its main riff. Bruce Dickinson delivers a very good and passionate performance and the lyrics are among the best of the album. They talk about Egypt and some riffs are very reminiscent of the music of that country, so the atmosphere of the song is amazing. \nAfter 3 minutes, there is a fantastic breakdown, with superb bass lines, soft drumming and an outstanding guitar solo. Then, the song becomes heavier and the solo gets faster. When the solos end, McBrain plays a fast fill, the main riff returns and the chorus is repeated, bringing back the egyptian atmosphere. The song ends greatly this way. \n\nThe Rime of the Ancient Mariner begins immediately after the end of the title track. Every Maiden album has an epic track. The Number of the Beast has Hallowed Be Thy Name, Somewhere in Time has Alexander, the Great, the debut has Phantom of the Opera and so on. But Rime of the Ancient Mariner has to be the best epic Iron Maiden ever wrote (The Legacy is a very close second). The song was entirely composed by Harris and it is based on the homonym poem of Samuel Coleridge. \nThe song has lots of different sections. It begins with a drum fill and some simple guitar riffs. Bruce begins to sing about the mariner and how he killed a bird. The shipmates blame him because of that as they apparently think that the death of birds brings bad omens. Then, they hang the bird around the neck of the mariner, as a punishment. \n\nAfter 6 minutes, the song becomes calm and a narrator talks more about the story. Then, a wonderful bass line is played, which is related to the rising of the unlucky mariner. The song becomes heavy again and wonderful solos are played. \nThe song ends with the first guitar riff played and, also, with Bruce Dickinson concluding the story. This song is an authentic journey, indeed. \n\nSo, we reach the end of the record, which is full of catchy yet complex songs, with fantastic instrumental sections, catchy choruses, solid drumming, good bass lines and outstanding vocals. \nThe Rime of the Ancient Mariner is the best track of this record, undoubtely, closely followed by the title track and The Duellists. But every song is really good - even the worst track, Back in the Village, is good. \nConcluding, this is a masterpiece. A fantastic album. The peak of Maiden's creativity. A CLASSIC, my favourite album ever. I just don't give away 99 points easily, so, if I gave 99 to this record, you HAVE to get it. This possibly is the best metal album ever, consistent, solid, complex yet catchy, heavy yet progressive, basically everything about this record ROCKS.\n\nEven the artwork is one of my favourites. I would also recommend you to get the remastered version of Powerslave, the quality of the sound is much much better, it also contains the music videos of Aces High and Two Minutes to Midnight and the booklet has lots of cool pictures and that kind of things.\n\nBest Moments of the CD:\nEVERY moment. Yes, I never thought I would say this, but every moment of this album is priceless.\n\n99 points - Outstanding record; my personal favourite and that's saying something. Highly recommended.\n\n___________________________\nEDIT: I just changed the points and the conclusion of the review a little bit. I just felt the review deserved a change because I heard the record recently and I discoverd that it remains enjoyable after so much time constantly listening to it. A winner.\n",
        "\nDon't get me wrong, like most other metalheads, I find a lot of Maiden's output essential. However, Piece of Mind falls rather short when compared to Killers, or Seventh Son of a Seventh Son.\n\nThe album starts on a rather high note with Where Eagles Dare, with the epic-sounding drum intro, and the guitars that kick in a few seconds later, giving off the same epic feeling. Bruce's vocals are alright, but nothing too special. A typical, melodic, harmonized solo that we've come to expect from this band comes in. Revelations slows things down a bit, and kinda drags on, but it's not a bad track by any means.\n\nHowever, after this, we have an incredibly solid trio of metal classics: Flight of Icarus gives us the typical galloping feel, then breaks down into a fist-pumping chorus that one can't help but rock out to. The album moves into Die With Your Boots On, which is a perfect example of how make a riff that involves pinch harmonics correctly, which is something a lot of bands fail at. The verses are kinda dull, but like Flight of Icarus, the chorus is incredibly infectious, albeit not on the same level. \n\nHowever, we have one of Metal's most well known songs: The Trooper. How can anyone not love this song? The descending intro, which feels like it will drag you straight into a warzone, and the fast paced riffs, and Bruce's perfectly complimentary vocals. Amazing, it's not hard to see why this song is a live staple. I DARE you to not sing along to this song, this is a perfect example of a Metal anthem.\n\nStill Life slows things down once again, however, I find this pace perfectly fine, and the highlight definately being Bruce's vocals. They give this song a very soaring-esque feel. Power Metal bands, take heed, this is how you make a slower paced, epic song.\n\nHowever, at this point, the album tends to disappoint me. Quest for Fire seems like a filler track, not really leading the album anywhere. The riff is generic Maiden, and really fails to capture my attention in any way. Same goes for Sun and Steel.\n\nTo Tame a Land is a decent way to close the album, although I really would have prefered a much faster song for them to go out on. There are some good riffs in this song, however, they just lack the energy the band had at the beginning of the album.\n\nThere you have it, Piece of Mind. I recommend picking the album up, but only if you are a Maiden enthusiast. Otherwise, go for Powerslave or Killers.\n",
        "\nFueled by guilt, I have decided to write a review for one Iron Maiden's countless classics after I ruthlessly slagged their newest record. Powerslave is a very special album to me; it contains some of my absolute favorites, and it was my first Iron Maiden purchase. I was about to type my obligatory history lesson here, but then I decided that if you are reading this review, you must be on the Metal Archives, and if you are on the Metal Archives and do not know about Iron Maiden, well then you should probably pack your shit and leave.\n\nThis album is the disputable peak of their creativity, songwriting, and playing ability. Some say Number of the Beast nailed it, others believe Seventh Son of a Seventh Son was the absolute pinnacle. For me, it is Powerslave. This album is like a beacon of awesomeness in between two overrated records, Piece of Mind and Somewhere in Time. This is strange for me, I am a huge Iron Maiden fan, but it seems like they have a really uneven shit to great album ratio. I'll save the complicated explanation for another day and another review, just trust me when I say Powerslave contains some of the cathiest, most intense, most memorable, and overall most impressive songs Maiden has ever penned.\n\nIt has been argued that Iron Maiden started off as a heavy metal band, and the passage of time has transformed them into hard rock. My answer to this statement is 2 Minutes to Midnight. No amount of time will ever make that song less metal than it is. That song is truly THE Maiden classic to me. I'd rank it above Number of the Beast, Phantom of the Opera, or The Trooper.... the only song it pales to is Hallowed by thy Name. Featuring their goriest lyrics, catchiest riffs, and most memorable chorus after Run to the Hills, 2 Minutes to Midnight serves as essentially the perfect testament to what Iron Maiden is and also serves as a great introduction.\n\nAces High is the other high profile song here. Well... there's Rime of the Ancient Mariner and the title track, but no song is covered as often as Aces High. You think Powerslave, Aces High is the first song to come to mind, a fast, ripping number that leaves your neck sore and throat aching. \n\nI'd like to go on and on about how this is my favorite and their best album, but frankly, I'd just repeat myself the whole time. Just know that people are certainly justified in hailing other albums as masterpieces, as Maiden definitely (usually) know what they are doing when it comes to music, but Powerslave ranks above as the only album they've ever recorded with no stinkers on it. Every last song is catchy and memorable, and this album is almost worthy of a coveted 100% rating. Unfortunately, I feel Rime of the Ancient Mariner to be a tad too self indulgent and meandering at times, and Duellists just doesn't seem to measure up to the others. Even the unknown songs like Back in the Village and Flash of the Blade are absolute classics, worthy of every metalhead's time. \n\nA very worthy A is awarded. Excellent job guys, you've made a near perfect record. This is my favorite release from these pioneers, and it could only take a couple tweaks to make this album perfect. Essential listening, go buy it.\n",
        "\nThis truly is one of the best live things I've ever seen... it has one flaw in it, but, it's just epic.\n\nWell worth the wait of over ten years for this...\n\nThe Sound and Video have been massively improved, and it shows. Listening to this concert in 5.1 for the first time blew me away. From the opening of Churchill's speech, right through to the last bit of Sanctuary, and the crowds reaction that follows over the end credits, this thing had me enraptured. Not to mention the bits that get chopped for the CD that were in here had me in stitches, Bruce Dickinson proving himself to be an excellent showman, as well as just a great voice.\n\nThere were flaws though, and the main one being that, whilst the CD was mainly recorded on the 4th night, the Video was all done on the second, so quite a bit of the spiel that you DO know from the CD is different, as much as it's blatantly obvious they tried to do as much as possible in exactly the same way. This however, is minor, and I'm just nitpicking because I, among many, many other fans, pretty much know the CD verbatim, and to be thrown off a little tends to spoil a bit of the fun.\n\nThe only other real flaw wasn't with the production or sound at all, even if I personally think that the guitars could have been mixed a little better. No, the only other noticeable flaw was Dickinson himself. For some reason, on this night, he just couldn't hit those notes properly. Still, since he spends most of his time arseing about on the stage like some deranged lunatic on Acid, you hardly notice, especially when you get to hear just how good Steve Harris and co really sound when put under pressure.\n\nHighly recommended for ANY music fans, though, obviously fans of the band will get the most out of it...\n",
        "\nThere are many different opinions about this album, ranging from Maiden's best to an overrated piece of garbage. If one steps back and takes a good listen to this album for what it is: Bruce Dickinson's first album in a time with little to no heavy metal, you can start to see this album for how great it really is.\n\nAlmost every song on here is unforgettable. There are the undeniable classics of The Number Of The Beast and Run To The Hills, fan favorites 22 Acacia Avenue and Children of the Damned, but then there are also gems in here in the form of The Prisoner and Hallowed Be Thy Name (quite possibly the best ending song to any album ever.) The only miss on this album comes in the form of Gangland. While not terrible, it's wholly forgettable. But even that can't slow down the dominance of every other song on this album.\n\nDickinson can really wail. His presence on this album is unmatched by any of Di'anno's works on their two previous albums. Dickinson's voice really made Iron Maiden unique at the time and was just something Di'anno could not pull off. Steve Harris on bass, of course, gives a fantastic performance all around, from the galloping of the title track or the emotional playing on Hallowed Be Thy Name, Harris shows just what he can do. Dave Murray and Adrian Smith pull off smoking solos in multiple songs and are only accentuated by Clive Burr's excellent drumming skills song in and song out.\n\nLove it or hate it, no one can deny how influential this album was when it was first released and how it still influences bands over twenty years later. The Number Of The Beast is a great starting point for beginning Iron Maiden fans, and is definitely one of their best releases.\n",
        "\nIron Maiden's demotape, known as \"Soundhouse Tapes\" because of it's almost constant rotation at the Heavy Metal Soundhouse in London, is a demo worth a lot of money. I've had the luck of getting ahold of a very good counterfeit copy of it for a reasonable amount of money\n\nThis demo is interesting because it is the only official Maiden recording that features only one guitar and Doug Sampson on drums. Sampson's performance is solid, although not close to Clive Burr's or Nicko McBrain's. The bass is not as audible as on the studio albums, which might be understandable\n\nThe demo begins with \"Iron Maiden\", and this is an excellent rendition of an otherwise pretty mediocre song. Well, at least mediocre compared to many other songs in the Maiden repertoire. This version is interesting because it's slower and the drumming isn't as furious as on the studio version. But the small bass solo is still intact\n\nAnd then we go on to the demo version of \"Invasion\", a song that appeared on the b'side of the \"Women in Uniform\" single. Albeit in a faster and more upgraded version. This version lacks, as I said before, the speed of the later version as well as the furious drum intro by Clive Burr. But it's still a very good and interesting version of an otherwise largely forgotten song\n\nAnd then the demo closes with \"Prowler\", once again being a slower version of the song than that which appeared on the debut album. There's not much more to really say about it, except that it kills!\n\nIt's strange that the band didn't include the Soundhouse version of \"Strange World\", an interesting version with slightly different arrangements that later appeared on the 2 CD version of the \"Best of the Beast\" compilation\n\nTry to get ahold of this demo if you can, 'cause it's an important musical artifact!\n",
        "\nIron Maiden are simply one of the greatest live bands ever and Maiden England is the video document of yet another legendary performance.\n\nSongs from every classic Iron Maiden album are brought to life in this show that was filmed on the Seventh Son of a Seventh Son tour. Wait. There's nothing on here from Powerslave. Why? It's a small gripe, though. The high-quality of this concert is such that your focus won't be elsewhere. Besides, just pop Live After Death into the VCR after you finish watching this and you should be happy.\n\nThe slower tracks on here translate beautifully into the live setting. Steve Harris and Dave Murray (gods!) are side by side at the beginning of \"Still Life\" and it's cool to watch the interplay of guitar and bass as you hear those brooding melodies pouring forth from your speakers. \"Infinite Dreams\" is a little more high energy here than on Seventh Son of a Seventh Son and this only adds to the passion conveyed in the music and the lyrics. Bruce Dickinson's performance here is one of the best on the video.\n\n\"Heaven Can Wait\" is yet another great performance. The entire population of Birmingham, England even runs onto the stage to gather around Steve Harris and sing along to the \"Oh-oh Oh\" of the middle section. Well, actually it's the road crew, but it's still a great moment and one of the high points of the show. Hell, it's Iron Maiden. Every part of every show is a high point. Anyway, it sounds just as great as it does on Somewhere In Time. Plus, check out the guy in the audience who resembles Conan O'Brien. He looks like he's about to be sick all over the people in the front row!\n\n\"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\" is the keystone of this video. \"Very difficult song we're gonna do next,\" Bruce Dickinson states as he introduces the track. If you think the song sounds amazing on CD, then you will be left speechless after witnessing this performance. From the majestic riff that begins the song, through the marching verse riffs, to the pregnant silence of the song's middle section up through... ahhh... that rapturous ending. Words fail me at this point. I watched in nothing less than humble reverence as Dave Murray, Steve Harris, Adrian Smith, and Nicko McBrain flawlessly executed one of the greatest sequences of riffs and progressions in all of music; metal or otherwise. These are the kinds of things I live to hear as a metal fan and if you're not familiar with this song then I implore you to stop reading this and go listen to it now. Go out and buy the album, order this video, or download the track if all else fails. You must hear it.\n\nBruce Dickinson's vocals at times are as perfect as they are on CD, but he does botch some things during this show. The worst is in \"Die With Your Boots On\" where he seems to be so out of breath that he lapses into a dramatic speaking voice instead of singing the lyrics. Also, he is way off pitch during the chorus; enough to make me cringe just a little. Alas, the air-raid siren is human after all, but a subpar performance from Dickinson is still better than the best performance from some other vocalists. Dave Murray smiles and all is right with the world!\n\nThe show ends with Dickinson making reference to Iron Maiden's \"much-publicized year-off\" that would come after this tour. In hindsight, this would prove to be a bad choice. That time off would see the departure of Adrian Smith and Bruce Dickinson's dispassion with singing for Iron Maiden would grow and manifest itself into a poor performance on No Prayer For the Dying and on the subsequent tour for that album. That makes this video even more endearing as it is one of the final stands of the classic Iron Maiden lineup. I get chills just writing that. Hey, I'm a shameless Iron Maiden fan. You understand. \n\nGet this video and witness one of the greatest bands on the planet perform songs which continue to influence metal bands to this day.\n",
        "\nIf you\u2019re an Iron Maiden fan that currently doesn\u2019t have an extra pair of trousers in close range, I suggest you get one before continuing, because load-blowing might occur. For everyone else: It\u2019s \u201cLive After Death,\u201d but on DVD, which requires no further explanation when describing how instinctively awesome it is. What we have here is a visual recreation of a landmark show that\u2019s spiced up for your viewing enjoyment as it\u2019s stuffed with concerts, documentaries, and many more items that\u2019ll make you shout with joy; I promise you\u2019ll turn into an over-excited teenager in minutes. A lot of bands and labels will toss DVDs at you hoping you\u2019ll waste a few bucks on some crappy concert footage or whatever, but once in awhile, something like this will find its way to shelves and make everything around it obsolete. \u201cLive of Death\u201d has never been dethroned years after its crowning, yet our friends at Iron Maiden now have conquered a second live kingdom with this amazing gallery of history, might, and downright perfection. \n\nContent wise, Iron Maiden's performance is energetic and full of power unlike any other group of their time. The classic lineup of Adrian Smith, Bruce Dickinson, Nicko McBrain, Dave Murray, and Steve Harris rips through both epic and speedy numbers like \"Rime of The Ancient Mariner\" and \"The Trooper\" like it was part of their daily schedule; everything they perform is done wonderfully and clearly to the best of their thriving abilities. Of course, if you've even experienced \"Live After Death\" at all, you\u2019re probably already aware of how magical and downright forceful the band was in their prime, and that's something they'll always be known for. I mean how many squads could take a tune like \u201cRevelations\u201d and spice it up with so much voltage that it appears better live than on an actual record? Not for many, I suppose.\n\nBut being able to finally witness this show visually is the real gem here. Iron Maiden\u2019s stage presence complies entirely with impressive stage motions, which clearly make this whole enterprise much more attractive. It certainly was necessary to inject these famous shows by simply acting upbeat and hyper throughout without any pauses; just keeping that adrenaline on the move was like a key to a door. I mean what\u2019s better than watching Steve Harris plucking his bass during rapid sections on faster numbers? What\u2019s better than viewing Nicko\u2019s slick drum fills? What\u2019s better than witnessing Bruce\u2019s killer mask he idolized during \u201cPowerslave\u201d and its epic majesty? Or how about observing Eddie\u2019s mummified corpse prancing around while pestering the entire Iron Maiden crew? That just can\u2019t be beat!\n\nIron Maiden\u2019s biographical series continues here as the main attractive of this set\u2019s second disc. Appropriately titled \u201cThe History of Iron Maiden: Part 2,\u201d sixty minutes of interesting commentary from all five members shows them retracing their steps throughout the \u201cPowerslave\u201d writing process while giving some funny memories that emerged during the massive tour that followed. Nevertheless, our longtime friends regress back to those golden days and place every last detail about that time (including the unforgettable events that created \u201cMission From \u2018Arry\u201d) on a plate for you to indulge exactly what they devoured back then; it\u2019s actually a really good view, even if it might seem a little unneeded at hindsight. And that\u2019s not even mentioning the eastern European tour story, and many other great concerts of excellent proportions! Somebody get a bucket because I just came. \n\nYears will pass like lines on a road, yet Iron Maiden\u2019s monumental show way back in 1985 shall still channel identical energy levels into both your headphones and television screen; there\u2019s few things out there that\u2019ll actually be masterful in multiple senses like \u201cLive After Death\u201d and its legacy. I can honestly conclude you\u2019ll adore this thing to death if you find the CD remotely fun at all, but even placing the classic show aside still leaves you in bed with an interesting documentary and other great additions. If you\u2019re ever going to buy at least one live DVD in your lifespan, make it this legendary performance that\u2019ll forever be known as metal\u2019s finest show ever forged by mortal men.\n",
        "\nThe newer Iron Maiden albums are always good for stirring up a bit of controversy, and while it's obvious that the band will never again produce songs as fine as \"Aces High\" or \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner,\" they will keep coming really close. This is their second \"comeback\" album, Dance of Death, and while I might be in the minority on this one, I say it's much better than the overrated Brave New World.\n\nThis album showed Maiden spanning out a bit and introducing some progressive elements into the familiar galloping, air-raid siren Heavy Metal we all know and love, and I think it did them good, for they were already growing stagnant on the last album. The opening \"Wildest Dreams\" is a classic Maiden rocker, catchy as Hell and fun to boot, but the second song is where they really start to step things up. \"Rainmaker\" is a slightly Middle Eastern tinged tune, bringing to mind sandy, barren deserts with a bloodied, punishing sun overhead by utilizing mindblowingly cool guitar trills, along with a unique, fresh chorus melody that is quite unlike anything they've done before. The title track is also a great song, with oriental folk melodies creeping about in the shadows as Dickinson gives off a dark, reedy performance that sets the mood perfectly. Dickinson really has improved over the years rather than aging - his soft, balladesque voice was never this good.\n\n\"Gates of Tomorrow\" and \"New Frontier\" are classic Maiden rockers in the style that we've come to appreciate from them, and albeit a bit slower than the classic Maiden hits, they are satisfying appetizers for the oncoming feast - and what a feast it is! \"Paschendale\" is one of the very best songs Iron Maiden has ever written, just as good as \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\" and \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner,\" and bar none the best song on this album. It's an epic 8 minute entourage of classic metal riffs and epic overtones the way only Maiden knows how to do it, and the vocal lines are stirring and riveting in their passionate, agonized delivery. Fantastic song. And it follows up with one that is almost as good, the highly overlooked \"Face in the Sand,\" a midpaced quasi-epic with one of the best choruses the band has written in recent years. The album closes with the acoustic \"Journeyman,\" which is not the best song, but it works well as a closer to this darker, sprawling, more progressive sound that Dance of Death flaunted so boldly.\n\nThis album doesn't get anywhere near the amount of credit it deserves. While it's not classic Maiden, it is a bold epic modern day Maiden that won't fail to please. Repeated listens do this one good. Recommended.\n\nOriginally written for http://www.metalcrypt.com\n",
        "\nThis EP is only really worth buying if you're a Maiden fanatic like me. There isn't really a lot of groundbreaking or insanely interesting things on offer here, but well, what can I say? I'm a Maiden maniac!\n\nThe version of \"No More Lies\" is the same as on the studio album. An epic and quite atmospheric track, but somewhat lacking IMO\n\nThe orchestral mix of \"Paschendale\" should IMO have been on the album. I prefer this version for some reason, just like with the orchestral version of \"Dance of Death\"\n\nAnd next we have the electric version of \"Journeyman\", and I honestly prefer the acoustic version since it gives the album a really nice and calm ending\n\nAnd finally we have the hilarious \"Age of Innocence...How Old?\" sung by none other than Mr. Nicko McBrain himself! The vocals and Nicko's comments when he loses place are insane! The only gripe I have about this is that 6 minutes (!) of silence between this and the electric version of \"Journeyman\" is hard to stomach\n\nAs I said earlier, only buy this if you're a Maiden fanatic\n",
        "\nIt is very rare that a prominent old band releases a good record. It is even rarer that such a record matches the classics that made them famous in the first place. As for such a record being a nearly complete departure from their '80s classic sound, and being even better than almost all of the classic '80s material, Iron Maiden's A Matter of Life and Death may be a first. This is not your father's Iron Maiden. You will not find the likes of \"The Trooper\" on the record. Imagine 1995's The X Factor, only infinitely better. Instead of being galloping and triumphant, A Matter of Life and Death is dark, grim, epic as all hell, and more complex than anything they have ever created before. This record could almost qualify for the prog metal genre. And Blaze Bayley is nowhere to be found.\n\nThere is only one song (the opener \"Different World\") which is under five minutes, and two songs (\"For The Greater Good of God\" and \"The Legacy\") that exceed nine minutes. \"For The Greater Good of God\" is only nine seconds shorter than Dream Theater's prog-metal anthem \"Metropolis Pt. 1\". However, you can rest assured that all of this time is put to good use, with the one exception of the filler \"Lord of Light\" (a Janick Gers track, of course). Iron Maiden have long since moved beyond the Opeth-esque bloat of '90s stinkers like \"The Angel and the Gambler\".\n\nThe songs are intricately structured, with seamless time and tempo changes. For once, the soft intros that have become a New Maiden trademark feel fully integrated, rather than tacked on (the opening of \"The Legacy\" is particularly effective, with the acoustic guitars and Bruce Dickinson's creepy lullaby-esque vocal passage telling the story of chemical warfare victims producing one of the most unsettling atmospheres ever to grace a Maiden song).\n\nFor once, Kevin Shirley actually got the production right. The snare doesn't have the hollow metallic sound that it had in the last two albums, and the guitar tone is rich and natural-sounding. Steve Harris's bass is perhaps a touch too dark, sometimes turning to mud underneath the guitars. The most striking thing about the production is the excellent dynamics. This isn't the crude soft/quiet dichotomy of emo bands; Iron Maiden recognize the idea of there being an actual continuum of loudness, and use dynamics to subtly or not so subtly control the tension or flow of the song. The most dramatic example is \"The Longest Day\", which has a goosebump-inducing buildup that makes it perhaps the best Maiden song ever (yes, better than \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\").\n\nBruce Dickinson's vocal performance is quite amazing for a 48-year-old man, and though his high range is eroded a bit from the early '80s (you can hear him straining to reach the high notes in \"These Colours Don't Run\"), he has all the power and drama of his glory days. However, some of his true knockout performances come in the softer sections, where he displays a versatility honed by years of experimentation in his solo work. From the bone-chilling, downright scary narrative in \"The Longest Day\"'s opening, to the aforementioned sinister crooning of \"The Legacy\", Bruce has a lot more up his sleeve than the \"air raid siren\" wailing of the '80s (contrast this with his attempts at softer singing on the '80s records, which often sounded forced at best and comical at worst, especially the cringe-worthy verse of \"The Evil That Men Do\").\n\nThe excellent cover artwork indicates that war, and the most common cause of war in modern times, religion, are the lyrical focus of \"A Matter of Life and Death\". The lyrics are mostly excellent (a couple of songs suffer from Repetitive Chorus Syndrome, especially \"The Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg\" and \"For The Greater Good of God\"), in stark contrast to the juvenile irrelevancy of arch-rivals Judas Priest or the blind hatred of America and anything associated with it exhibited by idiots like Dave Mustaine of Megadeth.\n\n\"Different World\" is the only classically Maiden song offered, a fast-paced rocker with some sincere if rather un-metal lyrics about the dull reality of getting old (all right, lyricist Adrian Smith probably is not at all strapped for material wealth, but money doesn't buy happiness. Just ask Kurt Cobain.). The vocals on the chorus, unusually for Maiden, are subdued compared to the high-flying verse (a tribute to Thin Lizzy, the band says). it's an interesting reversal of the norm, and the song is better for it.\n\n\"These Colours Don't Run\" is about patriotism, duty, and the bonds that form between soldiers (all of which are very real, whatever pacifists might say). The song is bookended by bittersweet, soulful guitar harmonies, contrasted by the bravado-laden chorus and truly thrilling bridge unison. Could be a little faster, but it's otherwise good.\n\n\"Brighter Than A Thousand Suns\" sweeps away anything that's left of the classic Maiden \"happy\" sound with a mercilessly heavy, brooding 7/4 riff and a more malevolent vocal treatment from Dickinson. As opposed to the traditional melodic soundscape, this is positively crushing--all the more fitting for a song about the atom bomb.\n\nSynth figures prominently in \"The Pilgrim\", which features some tricky, lurching proggy rhythms from McBrain and background string patches providing an almost Eastern sound. The song is otherwise rather unremarkable, and seems like it could've been a good single.\n\n\"The Longest Day\" is the most majestic song ever written by Iron Maiden. Ever. This, almost three decades after their debut, is their new masterpiece. The steady, inexorable escalation of the first couple of verses is breathtaking, its grim tone echoing the horrific slaughter of Allied troops on the beaches of Normandy in World War II, and then the song explodes into an anthemic chorus expressing a forlorn hope in the face of the Axis onslaught. The song is not relentlessly desolate like the World War I epic \"Paschendale\" from the previous album Dance of Death, as that would be inappropriate. The battle of Passchendaele was a senseless waste of human life in the name of realpolitik, while the battle of Normandy was a struggle to dislodge the appalling Third Reich tyranny from France--one of the closest equivalents to a \"good versus evil\" battle that history has ever borne witness to. The ludicrously technical 15/8 instrumental section takes the song to a climax, and then the song winds back down to the solemn bass gallop that began it. This is one of those songs that just transcends mere music and becomes an experience. It's just that awesome.\n\nHaunting half-acoustic piece \"Out of the Shadows\" settles down a bit from the epic overload of \"The Longest Day\". dealing with the cruel reality of being born into a third world country where life is cheap, death is early, and pain is omnipresent. Those born in America, Europe, or Japan are lucky. This song gives us an emotional reminder of the lot of people who didn't share our luck.\n\n\"The Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg\" was the album's first single and preceded by a bunch of teasers and mind games put out by the band. I didn't follow the press campaign, so I can only gather that the song appears to be about a man who has returned from the dead into a cursed half-life. The song continues the mellower mood of \"Out of the Shadows\", with haunting bell-like bass lines that take advantage of Steve Harris's \"clanky\" style and an a sad, desperate vocal delivery from Bruce., before abruptly exploding into a heavy riff. The song grinds away with a mood of near panic as the titular character is beset by all manner of nightmares and curses. The bridge speeds things up a bit with an extra-heavy, almost thrash-like rendition of the traditional Maiden gallop and menacing palm-muted riffs. The ending is a bit of a let-down as it crashes abruptly into an abbreviated version of the opening bass line rather than winding down naturally.\n\n\"For the Greater Good of God\" probes the motivations of the \"Islamist\" Muslim fundamentalists who strive to their dying breath to destroy Western civilization. The tone of the lyrics is rather unorthodox, appearing to ask God himself if he supports the slaughter carried out in his name (\"Are you a man of peace or a man of holy war? / Too many sides to you, don't know which anymore...\"). The song is relentlessly technical, with convoluted bass lines, some of the highest vocal lines since the early '80s (Bruce seems to struggle with the chorus), and an insane Dream Theater-like instrumental section packed with wild off-time riffs and furious shredding. While previous songs flirted with progressive metal, this is the real deal, expansive, demanding, and thought-provoking, the way \"thinking man's metal\" is supposed to be.\n\n\"Lord of Light\" is just plain dull, a plodder that could've been pulled from the Blaze Bayley era. The chorus riff is truly annoying, a lame groove figure that sounds like it was taken from a Pantera song. Every gem must have a flaw, I guess...\n\n\"The Legacy\" continues the prog rock mood of \"For The Greater Good of God\", with Bruce Dickinson sounding like Peter Gabriel of Genesis in places, a linear progression through sections that are not repeated, and the total lack of a chorus of any kind. The song is almost like a recap of the entire album, swinging between soft and heavy, fast and slow, and Bruce displaying several different vocal styles. The lyrics, too, offer a sort of summary of the album's themes, describing the horrors of war, the cruel and hard world we live in, and the grim fate that often awaits tyrants. Towards the end, the song takes another turn, becoming more hopeful and suggesting that the world is slowly becoming a better place, year by year, before gently petering out with a soft acoustic denouement.\n\nA Matter of Life and Death is a truly essential Maiden record, the best since Seventh Son at the very least, and, I think, the starting point for where they should go with their sound. Even if the melodic proto-power-pop-metal of the '80s made their name, there's a limit to how long you can keep doing one thing. Besides, do you really want them to put out yet another clone of \"The Trooper\"?\n",
        "\nAfter the innovative \"Somewhere in Time\" album, Iron Maiden decided to broaden their sound and replaced the synths with keyboards this time around, and thus created the masterpiece known as \"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\"\n\nA significant difference between this album and \"Somewhere in Time\" is that Maiden returned to their roots, albeit in a different way. Whereas the lyrics to the vast majority of songs on \"Somewhere in Time\" were based on the concept of time and living your life to the fullest etc., the lyrics to the songs on this album is the kind of lyrics Maiden are most known for; namely mystical things, mythology and almost horror film oriented lyrics\n\nAnd also, whereas \"Somewhere in Time\" had quite a light and somewhat \"happy\" power metal sound, this album's sound is a unique blend of power metal and a light shade of doom metal. This is most noticeable on the opening track \"Moonchild\" which is fairly dark but at the same time kind of light\n\nThe other two changes is the production and the contributions of Bruce Dickinson. The production isn't as 80s sounding as \"Somewhere in Time\" was. There isn't as much reverb and Nicko's drums has a more natural sound, although I miss his monumental drum sound on \"Somewhere in Time\"! And the contributions from Bruce really helps this album in gaining a larger diversity than \"Somewhere in Time\" had\n\nThe album starts with \"Moonchild\", which, as I said before, is a wonderful and unique blend of power metal and doom metal of a lighter shade. The keyboard riff is the younger cousin of the synth riff from \"Caught Somewhere in Time\", only that the keyboard riff sets the mood a little better, I think. Bruce's vocals range from soft to harsh only to go totally insane in places! Steve's bass is clanky as usual, and Dave Murray and Adrian Smith pump out catchy riffs and kick ass solos as usual\n\n\"Infinite Dreams\" is the ballad of this album, only that this ballad is darker than most metal ballads. It almost sounds like the guys were on acid (LSD) when they wrote the intro! The song is quite progressive in structure and it contains some twists and turns at places. Of particular notice in this song is Steve's unusually up front bass which has an almost symphonic quality to it. But I guess that's because he used a bass synth. And don't miss the outro sound which almost sounds like a church organ!\n\n\"Can I Play with Madness\" is the younger cousin of \"Wasted Years\", and it's one of Maiden's most commercial songs to date. If I had to pick one song from this album that I like less than the others, then this would be that song. But it's still kick ass IMO. The chorus is catchy and Adrian's guitar solo almost sounds like something Led Zeppelin would have done\n\n\"The Evil That Men Do\" is another quite commercial but still kick ass song. The chorus is once again catchy, as is Adrian's solo\n\nThe title track is one of the most epic songs Maiden have done. And just like with \"Moonchild\", this is another superb blend of power metal and doom metal. With the exception that the doom sound is more prominent and less light this time around. This song could almost be the ceremonial song in a Black Mass congregation! The spoken part only enhances the song, and the instrumental section near the end is brilliant\n\n\"The Prophecy\" is the album's most depressive song, and the doom element is once again prominent. And exactly as in \"Moonchild\", Bruce's vocals range from going insane to being quite depressive. Another unique thing about this song is that the chorus has vocal layers, and at times it almost sounds like Bruce is growling! The acoustic flamenco-sounding outro is another highlight! Simply stunning and absolutely beautiful!\n\n\"The Clairvoyant\" is one of the lighter songs on this album, which might be explained by the fact that it was the third single released from this album. The verses are quite sad whereas the chorus is quite happy, which creates an interesting mix between sadness and happiness. It's sad that Adrian's solo is too short, because it's great IMO\n\nAnd then the album ends with \"Only the Good Die Young\". The title of this song is very clever, and you only have to look at history to see that this statement is indeed often correct. This song is another quite depressive song with pessimistic lyrics. The chorus is catchy as hell, not to mention Adrian's solo which sounds like a tribute to the classic piece \"Flight of the Bumblebee\" (which Joey DeMaio from Manowar also covered...on his bass!)!\nThe song closes with the same verse that was enounciated in the intro of \"Moonchild\", and thus closes the circle nicely\n\nThis is an album that I definitely recommend to fans of power metal, and also to fans of doom metal. But this album only has light shades of doom, so don't expect something that is \"Bewiiiiiitcheeed!\"\n",
        "\nWhat we have here is Maiden at their live finest...huge stage show in Dortmund, Germany, great set list, great performance, the whole shebang. However, Steve Harris needs to be kept away from the editing room...lifetime ban. I almost had a seizure from the editing, forget the light show. Granted, the editing gets progressively better, but the performance of \"Wildest Dreams\" is all but ruined by the jarring camera changes. \n\nWith this said, this is an amazing show. The band proves that they still have it, and the set list encompasses all of their live favorites as well as some gems from the \"Dance of Death\" album. \"Paschendale\" and \"Dance of Death\" are particularly magnificent with Bruce really getting into the character of the songs by dressing up. The stage set-up is as grand as Iron Maiden themselves, and during the performance of their title track, Janick proceeds to prove to us that guitar acrobatics can be utilized by talented guitarists as well and are not just for use by As I Lay Dying and their ilk.\n\nHowever, the one downside to this gig, is that the only real stand-outs are really the newer songs from \"Dance of Death\" because anyone who's seen \"Rock in Rio\" or heard \"Live After Death\" or \"A Real Live One\" has heard these Maiden classics performed before. But it's still very well done. \"The Trooper\" is boosted by its triple guitar harmony (thank you Janick!) and their performance of \"Iron Maiden\" here is truly spectacular as I may have previously mentioned. Another Maiden standard is brought back from the dead in the form of \"Lord of the Flies\". I have to admit, as bland as this song is in-studio with Blaze Bayley on vocals...Bruce breathes new life into an otherwise dead song that sounds very good in this medium...even if the studio version puts you to sleep.\n\nThe bonus disc is also a doozy, packed with documentaries, music videos, interviews, the \"Dance of Death\" EPK...overall, this is a great DVD release for Maiden fans, although \"Rock in Rio\" also intrigues me, but this suffices and gets the job done very satisfactorily. The main flaw is, as I have said, the editing. But if you can get used to it, you will be rewarded by an excellent gig.\n\nStand-outs from the gig: \"Wildest Dreams\", \"The Trooper\", \"Dance of Death\", \"Paschendale\", \"Iron Maiden\"\n",
        "\nThis was probably the most important album for Iron Maiden to craft as it was \"make or break\" for them. It really can be seen as the twin album to Piece of Mind as it has many similar traits with that album, including the production and the all around aura they both obtain. This album is much more majestic, however, as it truly cemented Maiden's position as THE metal band to beat in the 80s metal scene. Sure, there were heavier and faster monsters (mainly looming from the West Coast of the US at the time, but that's another story), but Maiden was truly stepping into the world's spotlight at the time. Sold out tours in America and just about everywhere else on the planet cemented that fact into the most metal of all stones. Quite a feat considering Maiden recieved next to no airplay in America. \n\nThe album itself is quite collossal. I consider it to be just as collossal as the stage show that followed after this record hit shelves. The 12 foot tall eddie coming out during the title track, holding Steve Harris in his hand. [sigh] What I would do be alive to witness such an important thing in metal history.\n\nThe album opens firing on all cylinders with 'Aces High'. A nice fast song recalling WWII air combat, with very turbo jet engine like riffing ideas and some amazing vocal work courtesy of Bruce Dickinson.\n'2 Minutes to Midnight' is next, one of the band's biggest hits, and probably an eternal concert staple. For some odd reason, the intro/main riff recalls 'Welcome to Hell' by Venom to me. There's just a whole lot more to this one, and let's just say the guys in Maiden knew what they were doing a bit better than the Newcastle never-do-wells :)\n'Back in the Village' is supposed to be part 2 of 'The Prisoner' which was on Number of the Beast. The lyrics are based on some reality TV show or something. I'm not quite sure though. I could be wrong. Musically, its got a very great rhythm, reminding me of something Megadeth would do on Killing is my Business.\nThe two closing tracks on the album are the true highlights though. They are so completely massive and epic, they put any other band trying to top this to shame. Symphony X wish they could write another 'Rime of the Ancient Mariner'. The title track of the album has some great egyptian style melodies. This is another Dickinson penned song, and it shows he's made a great leap since Piece of Mind, as this song is even better than Revelations, despite that song completely slaying. 'Rime of the Ancient Mariner' itself is the coin Maiden epic of their entire discography. It has some great gallop type riffing, and some great lyrics to go along with it, detailing Samuel Taylor Coleridge's 19th century poem of the same name. Describing this song would be redundant and overlong, so I just recommend it is heard. It has so many feels and moods in its 13:40 minute duration. But I will say here, that the section around the 9 minute mark, after Bruce yells 'THEN DOWN IN FALLS COMES THE RAIN!' would have to be one of the greatest metal moments ever. It's like those spine chilling moments during 'Hallowed be thy Name' all over again, just less somber sounding.\nYes, this was the album that put Maiden at the top of the world. And it was rightly deserved too. The album cover art of an Egyptian carved Eddie is very fitting, considering Maiden is eternal and will be remembered always.\n",
        "\nI have a strong feeling this album was concocted by Iron Maiden to shed their NWOBHM skin entirely. They sure as hell were head and shoulders above the rest of the competition when it came to making this kind of music. Less NWOBHM and more power metal is on hand here. It has all the traits that future power metal bands would take from them: vocal acrobatics, melodic and epic sounding guitars and songwriting, technical chops, lyrics speaking of battlefields, barren wastelands and sci fi imagery, bass lines that bring along ensemble work with the guitars, and drumming that is completely over the top.\nSpeaking of drumming, exits ex-drummer Clive Burr and enters Nicko McBrain. I dont know which drummer I prefer more, but lets just say that both drummers have their strengths and weaknesses. This will be the 4th time and the fourth album where they lose an original member, but this lineup would remain stable until 1990. Onto the songs themselves..\nWhere Eagles Dare. The aforementioned power metal sensibilities come into play here. Quite the epic song if I do say so myself, stretching the 6 minute mark, with several riffing ideas built on top of the last one. Revelations, the first song written entirely by singer Bruce Dickinson, which changes feel and tempo without warning several times, alternating between heavy riffing sections, and softer, prettier sections for the verses.\nThe true classic on hand here is The Trooper, which is a staple in the live set today, and for good reason. This Steve Harris (bass) penned composition has just about everything good about Iron Maiden included in its four minute duration. The riffs are meant to make you raise your fist and join in with the defiance, while the lyrics are very descriptive and detailed, like many Maiden lyrics. \nOther standouts include the very atmospheric To Tame a Land (which was to be based on the novel Dune, and was to be titled \"Dune\", but the author of the book threatened to sue Maiden if they used the title), and Still Life, a song that reminds me very much of Hand of Doom by Black Sabbath for some reason, and Flight of Icarus, the first single from the album, with a very anthemic sounding chorus.\nYessiree, this album took Maiden to the next level and beyond, as their stage show got even bigger and more theatrical, and they began touring more consistently with lengthier tour sets. The NWOBHM tag had finally been torn off and now they were the leaders of the modern metal movement of the time. The only question was...where do they go from here?\n",
        "\nThis is the first album by Iron Maiden without Bruce Dickinson on vocals. The job instead went to Blaze Bayley. This album also featured a significantly different structural departure from previous albums. All that being said, this album is about as average as it can get.\n\nThere is absolutely nothing spectacular about this addition to the Iron Maiden catalog, however it is not horrible. The riffs are generally well constructed and the songwriting is still competent. The only real issue is the fact that this was, as stated earlier, a significant departure from the great Iron Maiden. Obviously the vocals are different. Bayley does not have the soaring opera-trained vocal style that Bruce Dickinson has, but he is still a very good singer. I just do not think that he fits in with the well-renowned style of Iron Maiden. The other difference was in the structure of the songs themselves. Iron Maiden has frequently written some longer songs on their albums, but on this album all but one song clock in over five minutes, and that one exception is still more than four minutes long. This is not necessarily a bad thing but it makes the album a little tedious at times. This is not an album that can be listened to over and over again. Unfortunately Iron Maiden would continue along with this for their next several albums even after the triumphant return of Bruce Dickinson.\n\nThe best thing about this album, as usual for Maiden, is the bass lines. Steve Harris is one of the greatest bass players in heavy metal and the fact that he can frequently be heard playing rhythms against the riffs of the guitars means that he can actually be heard well enough to be enjoyed. Harris is also one of the better songwriters in metal which has lead to Maiden's hallowed place in the genre.\n\nAll in all, this is an okay album, but I honestly think I would have enjoyed it more if it had not been released under the Iron Maiden name. It's just too difficult to accept the band without Bruce Dickinson after all these years. Thankfully the band only released one more full length with Bayley before Dickinson returned.\n",
        "\nI never thought I'd ever stop and say \"wow, this sucks total monkey scrotum!\" so many times while listening to an Iron Maiden album, but here it is anyway; proof that anything in the whole wide world is possible. Maiden were on a downward spiral after their prestigious Seventh Son, which was a masterclass, epic power/heavy metal album that managed to pack a grandiose sense of world crushing power into a mere 40 minutes or so. They released the merely average No Prayer for the Dying after that, and then hit rock bottom when they released this, their worst studio effort to date and most likely ever. Fear of the Dark isn't consistently bad, as we have a few cuts like the speedy, pugilistic \"Be Quick or Be Dead\", which is one of their fastest songs to date, the epic \"Afraid to Shoot Strangers\", the majestic \"Childhood's End\" and the dark, moody title track which everyone and their catatonic grandmother knows already, but just about everything else is complete and utterly worthless fecal matter that the band should've just released under a different name.\n\nThis is barely even Iron Maiden for most of its duration; instead sounding like some awful garage rock band covering them and doing a generally fucked up job of it. And that about sums it up; as half the time, this album is not even metal, leaning toward a very hard rock-ish sound on several songs here. It wouldn't be so bad if they had turned into a classy hard rock band as Slough Feg have recently done, but this is a really fucking terrible hard rock album. Dickinson's vocals are raspy and strained and too loud in the mix (although this opinion may be influenced by the fact that they're so irritating; I'm not sure), and the riffs are a groovy mishmash of half baked ideas by a band that had run out of ideas by this point. Seriously, the riffs may be there and the solos may be pretty good, but there's nothing new on display here. At all. It's just Steve Harris recycling the same old, tired ideas for one more agonizing ferris wheel ride, except this time we have some truly bad outside influences barging their ways in. The production is hollow and dirty and it basically sucks. As for the songwriting...who the fuck are you kidding? \"Fear is the Key\" is awful, as is \"The Apparition\" and \"The Fugitive\", all stupid, groovy exercises in boring, insipid heavy metal touched up with annoying, repetitive choruses. \"Chains of Misery\" and \"From Here to Eternity\" are listenable - if you're a fan of shallow, substance-less glam rock. \"Judas Be My Guide\" sounds like the band wrote it in 15 minutes without much effort put into it, and \"Weekend Warrior\" is bar none the worst song the band has ever written in their entire career. I could say a lot about the numerous displays of amateurish fuckery the band displays here, from the annoying, overly repetitive chorus to the idiotic, bouncy riff that chugs its way through all 5 torturous minutes of this song, but I'll just say that it sounds like a...well, I honestly can't think of an adjective insulting enough to describe this piece of trash. Ungodly bad.\n\nSo, this can be viewed as a collection of Iron Maiden's worst ideas ever, and it's really only necessary for absolute Maiden completionists and die hards. There are some surprisingly terrible, terrible songs here, the likes of which Maiden fans never would've dreamed of before this album was released, and it's puzzling - how does such a mature, sophisticated heavy metal outfit as Iron Maiden sink this low? Maybe they were just \"having fun\", but that's no excuse at all for how bad this is. Bad songwriting, bad vocals, bad production...this is just all around BAD. I'm done wasting time on this, so in closing, avoid this aberration and just go listen to Powerslave again.\n",
        "\nThis was Iron Maiden's much lauded comeback album from the depths of mediocrity, and it gets a lot of praise for just being a good old Maiden album with Bruce on vocals and the mouth-watering twin leads taking the spotlight. Indeed, Bruce Dickinson had indeed returned to the band, and indeed, these songs are not the Blaze albums or the horrible hard rock abominations that were Bruce's last albums with the band before those, but it's obvious that Brave New World was tragically over-hyped upon its release, as was expected. Simply releasing an album that doesn't blow donkey cock (anything sounds good compared to the awful Fear of the Dark for instance) does not a good album make.\n\nIf you're an Iron Maiden fan, you'll most likely find something to enjoy here, as all the elements are in place for a nostalgic time-warp back to the days when Maiden were the kings of the metal genre: We have Bruce's soaring, air-siren wailing belting out some of the catchiest choruses the band has done to date over a cascade of jumpy, rock-solid heavy metal riffs, courtesy of the band's three guitarists (!), Nicko McBrain's skin-pounding fury on the drum kit, and Steve Harris's trademark basslines, which are decidedly low in the mix this time around, puzzlingly enough. The production is clear as day, and musically the band haven't slacked off at all here. However, a lot of these songs seem to be trying to sound like old Maiden songs, but they just don't quite cut it a lot of the time. I mean, really, this isn't a bad album, but it's just too \"safe\" for Iron Maiden; as if the band was afraid to dive headfirst into the proverbial metal pool.\n\nInstead, Brave New World is pretty much an entire album the band edging nervously around the aforementioned pool, lightly dipping their toes into the water every now and then, but never really taking any chances and jumping in. Come on, \"The Mercenary\"? The title track? \"Blood Brothers\"? \"The Fallen Angel\"? \"Out of the Silent Planet\"? B-sides at best. Even the energetic, catchy advance single \"The Wicker Man\" is restrained and doesn't show what the band is capable of. I understand the band was sort of testing the waters with their fan base again after a decade of more negative feedback, but they never really let loose here like they should. Iron Maiden was a band with boundless enthusiasm, and it showed in their heyday, with vibrant, speedy cookers like \"Aces High\" and \"Flight of Icarus.\" They were never the best band ever, but what they were was consistent, and also passionate. This album is neither of those things, sad to say, just a sort of \"we're baaaaaack!\" album, for the sake of being back, and nothing else. \n\nFortunately, the band clearly hasn't really lost it, as there is a slight progression in evidence here. There are three songs above the 8 minute mark on display here, and while \"The Nomad\" drags a bit (still a fine song), \"Dream of Mirrors\" is a fantastic song; 9 minutes of pure heavy metal class and style, the way only Maiden can do it, leaping head first into the proverbial metal pool and making a splash. Shifting from an acoustic crooner to a mature, rocking headbanger, it doesn't fail to please, with some pretty damn cool lyrics to boot. \"The Thin Line Between Love and Hate\" is somewhat along the same lines, with the odd attribute of being the only song Maiden's ever done with backing vocals on the verses instead of the chorus, which is sung solely by Bruce. It's not Maiden at the top of their game, but it is a cool song, and it closes the album with style and class. However, the real gem here is a 6 minute exercise in pure metallic bliss, titled \"Ghost of the Navigator\"; a brilliant, riffy tune that's probably the best song the band has done in 15 or 20 years now, since the Seventh Son era. Bold words, but it's not that hard to agree, considering the magnitude of everything they've released since. The song is reminiscent of a condensed version of \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\", boasting a catchy chorus and a commendable set of riffs, alongside lyrics that will beckon you to the old sea with a ghostly, welcoming hand. Magnificent.\n\nThere is good stuff here, but this isn't the best Maiden can do, and it's actually very disappointing when you look at the bigger picture. The title track is the only real dud here, as every other song is at least listenable and fun, and overall this isn't bad in the least - it's just a legendary band going through the motions; Iron Maiden at 75% of their power. It's respectable that they can still pump out an album like this after 25 years of existence (most bands don't), but it's safe to say that this isn't an album that will be in constant rotation even by Maiden die hards after the shock wears off.\n",
        "\nBefore its release, \u201cThe X Factor\u201d was one of the most anticipated albums in the history of heavy metal. After little more than a decade of faithful service, Bruce Dickinson had left Iron Maiden to pursue a solo career. Could the band find a replacement, that would be as skilful and accomplished as Bruce? Uncertainty. Following a rather long period of speculation, Blaze Bayley, member of Wolsbane until then, was eventually announced as the new vocalist of Iron Maiden. The uncertainty increased. Blaze might have been a good singer, yet his voice and style were fairly different than what the fans of Maiden had grown used to the last ten years. Everyone was anxious to find out whether Bayley\u2019s presence could revive Iron Maiden and whether the upcoming album could restore the group\u2019s former glory. \n\n\nAfter its release, \u201cThe X Factor\u201d became one of the most controversial albums in the history of heavy metal. On the one hand, many metalheads were quick to condemn the record, claiming that it did not sound like Maiden at all, that Blaze Bayley as a vocalist was far inferior to Bruce Dickinson, that the production was weak and lacking in depth. On the other hand, many fans welcomed the new direction the band was following, and considered \u201cThe X Factor\u201d to be an excellent step towards musical progress. According to them, the album contained excellent compositions, as well as solid performances in all aspects, including Bayley\u2019s vocals. \n\n\nNowadays, about 12 years after its release, one can judge \u201cThe X Factor\u201d objectively and in cold blood, without having to jump into conclusions. The first impression created is that Maiden\u2019s tenth studio album is breeds a dark, broody atmosphere. Everything about it (cover artwork, layout, band photos) is dominated by a heavy, merciless shade of black, while its lyrics are, for the most part, melancholic and introverted. Even the band\u2019s performance seems more depressive than usual. In some of his later interviews, Steve Harris would attribute this dark mood into the problems his personal life was facing during the recordings (the divorce with his wife, etc). This overall pessimistic atmosphere provides the album with an anti - commercial touch, and that is the main reason why a lot of fans found it difficult to comprehend.\n\n\nNevertheless, the fact that \u201cThe X Factor\u201d wasn\u2019t as commercial or as catchy as previous Maiden efforts, doesn\u2019t necessarily make it a worthless album. On the contrary, the record does indeed include a number of interesting compositions. The epic and atmospheric \u201cSign Of The Cross\u201d or \u201cThe Edge Of Darkness\u201d, the catchy \u201cMan On The Edge\u201d or \u201cLook For The Truth\u201d, even \u201cLord Of The Flies\u201d, with its clever lyrics, are all tracks that Maiden could be proud of. Bayley\u2019s performance is at least decent, if not anything else, and his presence seems to have had a positive effect on the rest of the band. Especially Janick Gers and Nicko McBrain display an encouraging willingness to adopt new styles and develop fresh techniques. \n\n\nIn addition, \u201cThe X Factor\u201d possesses another positive aspect, which constitutes its main strength as an album. More specifically, there is a honest, straightforward quality running through its entire length. Some say that it didn\u2019t sound like typical Maiden: well, it was not supposed to sound like typical Maiden. The band had hired a new member, who was bound to bring along his own influences and ideas. In order for these influences and ideas to be harmonically combined with the traditional Maiden approach into a coherent result, the group had to slightly modify their sound. The production had also to be modified accordingly. Iron Maiden are aware of the fact that Blaze Bayley is a different vocalist than Bruce Dickinson, regardless of who is superior or inferior. From this point of view, they do not try to replicate the sound they had in the past, which was accomplished with the precious contributions of their former singer. If they did, they would be attempting to become something they were not, thus deceiving themselves and, more importantly, their fans. Instead, what they try to do is enrich their sound with the healthy elements that Bayley has to offer, even if this means that the band will be led to alternate music fields. Tracks like the groovy \u201cThe Aftermath\u201d or the progressive, weird \u201cThe Unbeliever\u201d are a clear manifestation of the group\u2019s eagerness to experiment and seek new musical directions. \n\n\nOn the other hand, \u201cThe X Factor\u201d is not a perfect album. One of its drawbacks is that its second part isn\u2019t as strong as the first one. More specifically, with the exceptions of \u201cThe Edge Of Darkness\u201d and \u201cThe Unbeliever\u201d, the tracks from \u201cThe Aftermath\u201d until the end of the album don\u2019t seem to be as inspired as the first five compositions. This doesn\u2019t mean that the former are utterly pointless; they just possess some small flaws that don\u2019t allow them to be characterised as \u201cexcellent\u201d. What is more, form time to time, the rest of the band tend to make way for some bass solos of Steve Harris. These solos end up sounding quite annoying, as they represent an attitude of \u201cbow before me, I\u2019m the leader of the group\u201d. \n\n\nIn conclusion, most approaches tend to either underestimate or overestimate the artistic value of \u201cThe X Factor\u201d. It is certain that the specific album cannot actually be compared with the masterpieces of the past, like \u201cPowerslave\u201d or \u201cSeventh Son Of A Seventh Son\u201d. Nevertheless, it is also certain that it is not a totally worthless record. The fact is that it successfully introduced new elements to the music of Iron Maiden and, despite its flaws, it seemed to be a step towards the right direction. Unfortunately, this didn\u2019t hold true for its successor, \u201cVirtual XI\u201d, where the band just attempted to replicate the sound of former, glorious recordings.\n",
        "\nThe self titled debut of 'Iron Maiden' marks the birth of a classic band and the first chapter in one of the most quality and consistent heavy metal discographies. The songwriting here is way more unique and varied than most of the NWOBHM bands of that time, it has these catchy and uncomplicated NWOBHM hymns among complex and long epics which gives this album a more interesting shade than everything else out there, this is a standout debut for real.\n\nSomething unusual in this album is the very simple constructed riffing, which sounds quite powerful, even for today. The last thing I'd say about the riffing is that it's ambitious, because it isn't, and that's makes wonder. The rhythm guitars mostly built of power chords without too much complexity and yet they sounds incredible. 'Prowler' for instance contains only three riffs or so, which has the same patterns and beats and contains only sole power chords, but the way it executed makes it sounds so intense and impressive. It has a second guitar which just repeats the vocals and make the song flow better, but the perfect timing of the dual guitar work it's what makes this song sounds one of a kind. If it's about the short and adventitious fills, the precise strumming, the catchy rhythm or the middle section which takes the song to another voyage and return it to the basic point, the structure of this song is amazing at the same level of it's simplicity. What I'm trying to say is that this album sounds outstanding without making any effort, it's just pure in it's cure and it doesn't need to strain itself to amaze you, it has something unexplained in it's simplicity which makes it sound unique.\n\n'Sanctuary' is a very catchy song with very flowing rhythm and quite noticeable bass playing. The lead guitar is also great and varied, it's fast and harmonized and has a quite melodic vibe. 'Remember Tomorrow' is a semi ballad. It's verses are slow and melancholic and the chorus has the distorted guitars and heavier mood. The vocals are amazing, 'Paul Di'Anno' masters his voice easily and singing very emotional theme here. The middle section is awesome as well, pretty chaotic riffage and exploding solo which increases the atmosphere of this song way up. 'Phantom Of The Opera' is the epic of this album. Longer than the average length of the songs here and doesn't sounds boring for a moment. It has one of the catchiest riffs I've ever heard and it has a powerful, complex structure which progress excellently. The soloing however, is the jewel in the crown. Excellent orgasmic leading job and quite much dual guitar work here, this is a song that really impress you for the long range, one of the most memoreable classics of 'Maiden' and one of my favorites heavy metal songs ever.\n\nThe rest of the album is quality as well, not even one filler or dragging moment in this classic album. Iron Maiden's debut is absolutely one of a kind, their second album was impressive as well but it didn't had the same spirit, and of course that by 1982 this band sounded much different. Overall, 'Iron Maiden' is a classic album that really defines what classic heavy metal is with it's wide spectrum of colors and inventive mind. A must have for each metalhead!\n",
        "\nIn the progression that is Iron Maiden, this album is a critical step towards their goal of world domination. Its light years ahead of the debut, but not quite Number of the Beast quality yet, though some songs on here would rival some of the very best on that album. Killers, probably the best metal album ever when it was released, was an album that boasted the punky qualities of the debut, but also had a bit more of the serious leanings they would take after this album. Steve Harris (once again) wrote most of the music here. About 9 of the 11 songs, and had a big hand in the other two. Dennis Stratton is gone, and replacing him is Adrian Smith, guitar wizard extraordinare. It's impressive to see him and Murray duel back and forth, because they both rule. Di'Anno sounds MUCH better on here. More balls and conviction behind his delivery. While its not quite Dickinson in terms of quality, it is still very good, and comparing him to Dickinson isnt fair. They are two completely different styles. Clive Burr sounds as good as on the debut (not a bad thing). His rhythm is locked in well and he gets his job done. Anyways, onto the music. Let's see whats on hand here, shall we?\n\nThe album opens with the instrumental \"Ides of March\". It has a great melody and some harmonied guitars but its nothing to shit yourself over. The second song, Wrathchild, delivers. It is hard, angry and very punkish at times. \nNow, Murders in the Rue Morgue is probably the most underrated Maiden song of all time. It sure as hell is my favorite off this album. The riffs are catchy, the lyrics are very realistic and thought provoking, and in some parts, it reminds me of Phantom of the Opera off the debut album.\nOther outstanding numbers are \"Prodigal Son\", (another penned by Harris song) the mellowest song on hand here, but also the most heartfelt (not to mention also the best solo on the album), and the title track itself. \nThe title track has very much in common with what Megadeth would do 5 years later in the song \"Devil's Island\" off the album Peace Sells...But Who's buying?....Galloping thrash. Though Maiden doesnt quite thrash, this song is very speedy and has a very dark overtone. A standout indeed!\nIron Maiden would improve dramatically through all of their first 4 albums, until they hit their peak on Piece of Mind and kept it up for several years.\n",
        "\nThroughout history, there have existed men so vile that they have harbored the hatred of thousands. The infamous tyrant Vlad Dracule did it by brutally slaughtering his own countrymen simply to prove his own viciousness. Adolf Hitler did it by committing mass genocide against the Hebrew faith. Blaze Bayley did it by replacing Bruce Dickinson as the lead singer of Iron Maiden. Sound disproportionate to you? I\u2019d like to think so, though something around 90% of Maiden fans would likely support the aforementioned allegation. Bayley is probably the least popular replacement vocalist in history, even more so than Tim Owens, John Bush, Coburn Pharr (in Omen, he was alright in Annihilator), or Gary Cherone, simply because his was the unfortunate task of living up to Dickinson\u2019s legacy.\n\nNow personally, I think it\u2019s unfair to have a presumed bias against anyone in that situation. Their job is tough enough without an additional onslaught of prejudice to overcome. Sure, they might actually suck (see: Gary Cherone), but at least give them the benefit of the doubt. As one who formerly held such a bias against Bayley, I decided to check out his former band, Wolfsbane, to see if he had anything going for him before he ruined Iron Maiden in the 90\u2019s. I decided to give him the benefit of the doubt. And you know what? The guy can actually sing. As anyone who has heard Wolfsbane\u2019s Live Fast Die Fast album is aware, Bayley actually has quite an ear for a catchy vocal melody and even a few nice falsetto moments. And though he didn\u2019t utilize as much range for his work with Iron Maiden, I have to admit, he doesn\u2019t sound bad. So why does everyone hate him if he can actually sing?\n\nThis leads to another thing that Wolfsbane listeners are explicitly aware of: that Wolfsbane and Iron Maiden are nothing alike. Wolfsbane, though entertaining in their own right, weren\u2019t far removed from a David Lee Roth tribute band. How Bayley got roped into the Maiden gig is beyond me, because his voice is NOT suited for their style at all. He lacks the range, the presence, and the bravado to properly fill Dickinson\u2019s shoes and the fan outrage was not only expected, but unavoidable. The first album recorded with him, The X Factor, stands as one of the poorest Maiden releases to date, surpassed only by No Prayer for the Dying. But even though Bayley\u2019s performance is lacking, the blame for the album\u2019s failure does not rest solely on his shoulders.\n\nThough the \u2018new\u2019 Maiden sound was officially declared on the Brave New World reunion album, the seeds of it are rooted with this album. Steve Harris, likely working to create a noticeable departure from the tired, formulaic songs featured on the last two Dickinson albums, wrote some pretty experimental stuff for this. I shy away from the term \u201cprogressive,\u201d as the songs are merely longer, more atmospheric, and a bit more open-ended, rather than being particularly complex or unique. To say that the songs are long is a bit facetious; \u201cdrawn-out\u201d is a better term. Take opener \u201cSign of the Cross.\u201d The song begins with nearly three minutes of atmospheric introduction. And even when it picks up, it over-extends itself. What could have been a fantastic six minute song becomes a tedious eleven minute one. Granted, the Gregorian chants are put to good use, but the song takes its time in getting anywhere. This slow development is a recurring problem on the album, as well as a general lack of heavy metal. Most of the songs are slower and feature numerous mellow interludes. Think Barlow-era Iced Earth, as many parallels can be drawn. But even when these songs pick up, they\u2019re still way too soft to be Maiden proper. This phenomenon occurs because of the production, which highlights Steve\u2019s bass over the guitars. And with both Dave Murray\u2019s and Janick Gers\u2019 guitar tones subdued, one can\u2019t help but feel that the album lacks energy. There\u2019s plenty of trademark Maiden riffs and harmonies present, but with their power and passion absent. They kind of make up for it with their solos, but even those aren\u2019t up to their usual standard. All the instrumentation on here feels completely different than what the band is known for and it isn\u2019t for the better. Oh, and as for Nicko, he\u2019s still here, but barely. There\u2019s only one quick song that requires his full effort (\u201cMan on the Edge,\u201d with occasional fast parts in one or two of the other songs). The rest he merely coasts through, providing the rhythm to an album more focused on impressionism than substance, frequently calling to mind the band\u2019s classic songwriting without actually providing it.\n\nI understand that this was a \u2018dark\u2019 period in the band\u2019s history; therefore, the darker tone of the album\u2019s lyrics and sound are appropriate. But it would really help if the lyrics weren\u2019t so contrived. Maybe they really aren\u2019t, but it sure seems that way as delivered by Bayley. No catchy Dickinson melodies here. Hell, there aren\u2019t even any catchy Wolfbane-era Blaze ones, hindered further by Bayley\u2019s weakened voice and his occasionally grating cadence (listen to \u201cThe Unbeliever\u201d if you don\u2019t believe me, no pun intended). Even if you can appreciate the mood set up by the album\u2019s arrangement, don\u2019t expect to come out of this with a memorable line on your tongue; they are virtually extinct in the confines of this album.\n\nTo actually enjoy The X Factor, the potential listener is required to be a bit more than open-minded. You have to really be into the newer Maiden albums (BNW through A Matter of Life and Death) and not hung up on the fact that this sounds very far removed from the band\u2019s classic period. Alternatively, fans of atmospheric rock/metal might find some cool tunes to dig. Otherwise, it\u2019s a Maiden album of which Maiden fans are not the target audience. But blame Steve, not Blaze. Had Bruce been singing on this album, revitalized or not, it would have fared about the same, even without the preconceived antipathy towards the \u2018new guy\u2019 weighing it down. It\u2019s just not a good album, though it serves for a decent listen now and again. Give it a try, you might agree. But if you must hate it, keep in mind that it takes more than an uninspired singer to condemn an album to this plane of mediocrity.\n",
        "\nWhen I first saw the track list for the latest Maiden album and noticed the length of most of the songs, I could hardly believe my eyes. What the hell, an album full of nine-minute epics, with only four out of ten songs shorter than seven minutes (well, more like three, since These Colours Don\u2019t Run just barely misses that mark)?! These guys must be out of their minds!\n\nThis didn\u2019t bode well at all, especially considering the last time Maiden treated us to an album comprised almost entirely of long-winded epics, it ended up as quite a disaster. Fortunately, while comparable in mood and atmosphere, A Matter of Life and Death avoids the mistakes that dogged The X-Factor and also eliminates many of the glitches found on the first two albums since the band reunited with singer Bruce Dickinson.\n\nA Matter of Life and Death achieves a quite remarkable feat: Despite being ridiculously long, it never gets boring, and despite its somber mood and thoughtful lyrics, it never gets wimpy. On the contrary, this is the heaviest album Maiden have done since Bruce came back, easily topping both Brave New World and Dance of Death in that department. This can mainly be attributed to two factors: great riffing and much better production values.\n\nMaiden\u2019s latest offering has in abundance what previous albums often lacked, namely distinct guitar riffs that define and carry the individual songs. Tracks like Brighter Than a Thousand Suns, The Pilgrim, The Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg or Lord of Light (reminiscent of Bruce\u2019s solo career, this is one of the heaviest songs Maiden have ever done, with a monstrous main riff almost bordering on thrash) are all driven by heavy riffs that immediately get stuck in the listener\u2019s head, something that can\u2019t be said about very many songs on other recent Maiden albums.\n\nAnother strength of A Matter of Life and Death is the very decent production, marking the first time Kevin Shirley has delivered the goods on a Maiden studio album. The triple axe attack truly shines and makes its presence felt throughout the album rather than only during some scattered passages, as was the case on Brave New World and Dance of Death. However, that doesn\u2019t mean the other instruments take a backseat to the guitars. Nicko\u2019s drums and Steve\u2019s bass are given plenty of room as well, with Bruce\u2019s vocals once again being the icing on the cake. It\u2019s nice to hear his voice is still in great shape after all these years \u2013 actually, it sounds much better than it did in the early nineties, when Bruce came up with lackluster performances on No Prayer for the Dying and Fear of the Dark.\n\nAs far as songwriting is concerned, Maiden have done an admirable job this time around. These songs may be somewhat extended, but they never make you long for the fast forward button. Whereas the problem with many epics on Maiden\u2019s recent albums was their rather predictable structure \u2013 long acoustic intro, verse, chorus, verse, chorus, guitar solos traded off for several minutes, chorus repeated several times, acoustic outro \u2013, A Matter of Life and Death isn\u2019t predictable at all, keeping things fresh with plenty of tempo changes and lots of unexpected twists and turns. Good examples are the amazing Brighter than a Thousand Suns with that formidable up-tempo part seemingly coming out of nowhere and giving the listener a thorough kick in the behind, Lord of Light with that gloomy mid-section emanating a deeply sinister atmosphere and providing a great build-up to the song\u2019s grand finale, and The Legacy, which doesn\u2019t even have a traditional chorus at all. Speaking of choruses, Maiden have apparently realized that repeating them ad nauseam in almost every song isn\u2019t a very good idea, since this issue has largely been fixed this time around. On the whole, the songwriting is very consistent, as all songs maintain a very high level and there are no fillers to be found. (No, not even the opener Different World, which may be a bit of a run-of-the-mill rocker, but still works very well in the context of the more intricate compositions on this record.)\n\nIn the end, I really can\u2019t find much that\u2019s not to like about this album. Maiden have made a significant step forward in almost every way, making this a better effort than both Brave New World and Dance of Death. Those were excellent as well, but they also had some obvious flaws. For the most part, these flaws have been eliminated on A Matter of Life and Death, so I can\u2019t see why I shouldn\u2019t give this a very high rating. Maiden haven\u2019t been this good in almost twenty years, and if they can keep it up, I\u2019m definitely looking forward to their future work!\n\nChoicest cuts: Brighter than a Thousand Suns, The Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg, For the Greater Good of God, Lord of Light\n",
        "\nIron Maiden have always been one of my favorite bands of all time. However, I would HIGHLY recommend getting their full discography [perhaps excluding the Blaze releases] instead of a Best-Of album. 62 points? Quite low for a Maiden album? Let me explain...\n\nFirst of all, let me start off by saying every song on this album is great. That's not an issue. However, it is clear to see that the track on this album were selected in only one way: the two highest-ranking singles from each of their albums. Of course, a LOT is missing....\n\nHere is just a short list of songs that I realized were not on the album, just at a short glance. I'm sure there are millions more:\n\nMurders Of The Rue Morgue\nPurgatory\nCan I Play With Madness\nRime Of The Ancient Mariner\nPowerslave\nDream Of Mirrors\nThe Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner\nStranger In A Strange Land\n\nand most importantly, my FAVORITE Maiden song of all time....\n\nWHERE IS HALLOWED BE THY NAME?!\n\nSo why the low score? As I said, this compilation is decent, but only features two songs off of each CD, guaranteeing that a huge number of classic tunes are lost. If you want to start off listening to Maiden, get Number Of The Beast or Killers. Hell, get their full discography. Because if you stick merely to this compilation, you won't know the true metal legends that are Maiden. \n\n-Marcin C.\n",
        "\nThe most recent addition to my Maiden collection has proven to be quite a treat, for a less than expected reason. It contains the most catchy and memorable of all the songs on the \u201cA Matter of Life and Death\u201d album as its featured track. If one were to compare it to recent releases, it is probably most similar to \u201cRainmaker\u201d off the Dance of Death release, although the pre-chorus and chorus interchange is quite similar to a couple of songs on the \u201cBrave New World\u201d release. Its pinnacle point occurs when the song breaks into a 3 guitar harmony line just before the solo, probably one of the best instrumental sections I\u2019ve heard out of the band since Dickinson left the fold in the early 1990s. Likewise, the Radio 1 Legends Session version of \u201cHallowed be thy Name\u201d has several amazing moments to it as a result of the extra guitar being present.\n\nBut the true highpoint of this release is not the title track of the single, but instead the updated version of \u201cThe Trooper\u201d, which features some rather intricate changes in the song. One of the problems with the older material is that it is geared for 2 guitarists, but apparently this hasn\u2019t phased Steve Harris and company at all as they simply layer an extra part over top of the existing parts, which works in concert with the other parts rather than against them. The second time that the main theme is stated there is an additional harmony part put on top that makes for a nice transition. The first guitar solo is actually two lead lines layered over each other on the right side, sounding a lot like the old solos of the first 4 Black Sabbath albums at first, and then harmonizing in traditional Maiden fashion before the left side interjects its equal time in the solo section. However, Bruce\u2019s vocals are what puts this version of the 1983 classic over the top; quite frankly I\u2019d say its better than the original. Bruce\u2019s voice is powerful, on point, and hits all of the old notes that some thought were no longer in him.\n\nAlthough the Benjamin Breeg single was the promotional single for the most recent Maiden LP, this is the one to own. It has a much faster feel to it when listened to all the way through; definitely a lot closer to the older Maiden that many seem to still be hungry for. You may have a good couple years to wait before this band puts out another collection of B-sides/rarities so get yourself to whatever website you can and pick up this single, which contains two masterfully done remakes of two unforgettable classics.\n",
        "\nWho is Benjamin Breeg? Why is the year of his birth unknown, and yet the year of his death seems to coincide with the beginning of Iron Maiden\u2019s existence? These are likely questions that anyone who has either purchased this single and gazed on the cover art or has struggled to comprehend the lyrics printed for track 7 on their recent LP \u201cA Matter of Life and Death\u201d would ask, and unfortunately I\u2019m not privy to the answers. Some have speculated that the name was their mascot Eddie\u2019s name before he became the corpse and staple of the band\u2019s image, but no confirmation is given from any of the band members. From a marketing standpoint, this saga would make for a great ploy to sell future albums, much in the same way that the Charlotte the Harlot series did for them earlier in their career.\n\nAlthough quite a long song for a single, \u201cThe Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg\u201d is a good representation of the colossal work that \u201cA Matter of Life and Death\u201d is. There are a series of contrasting sections ranging from the dark and dreary intro that could easily fit in with the gloomy graveyard illustrated on the album cover, followed by an equally dark and heavy body section that reminds me slightly of \u201cThe Ghost of the Navigator\u201d, one of my favorite tracks off of the first album of the band\u2019s reunion. It\u2019s not often that Dave Murray gets his name attached to the first single put out for an album, mostly because his songs tend to be outliers when compared to the bulk of the pertaining album\u2019s sound, probably most blatantly in the case of \u201cThe Prophecy\u201d off the \u201cSeventh Son of a Seventh Son\u201d release. But in this particular case the song is a clear indication of the direction of the album it has been lifted from, which is a heavily progressive album with a lot of long epic songs.\n\nThe accompanying track is a recent version of an old Maiden classic \u201cHallowed be thy Name\u201d, which features the 3 guitar arrangement that has been in service since the year 1999. Amongst the various remakes of this song that have popped up over the years, this is one of the better ones in terms of vocal delivery as Dickinson\u2019s voice is in good shape, although it will probably never be quite as powerful as it was when \u201cThe Number of the Beast\u201d was originally recorded back in 1982. The atmosphere of the song is denser than the original, owing both to advances in recording technology and the newer instrumentation, and climaxes at the end with an absolutely kick ass free time ad lib that gives the song a live performance feel minus the audience applause (which tends to be annoying on live CDs after a while).\n\nAlthough a worthy pair of songs, this single isn\u2019t really worth hunting down unless you\u2019re a rabid Maiden collector like me. The Radio 1 Legends version of \u201cHallowed be thy Name\u201d can also be found on the Different World single as well, a single which would be more worthwhile as it also contains a solid remake of \u201cThe Trooper\u201d. The album art is almost enough to make up for the lack of fan perks to be found on here, but music is what makes the album, not the artwork.\n",
        "\nYes you read my title correctly. This is the greatest Iron Maiden album ever. \n\nI am a huge Iron Maiden fan. I've scrutinized every album, heard every song, seen their live show on more than one occasion, watched their DVDs, and learned their catalog on both guitar and bass. When this album came out, I was a little nervous that it wouldn't be good. Dance of Death was good, though had some bad flaws. When I first listened to A Matter of Life and Death, I thought to myself, \"well this is pretty good\". Yet over 9 months later, this album has slowly creeped into my favorite metal albums list (which includes mostly black metal and doom metal). Don't think you can listen to this album once and understand it - in order to appreciate it, you need to listen to it at least 10-15 times.\n\nWhy is this album so good? It excels on every level on which Iron Maiden is expected. I analyzed it in terms of production, vocals, drums, bass, guitars, and songwriting. \n\nFirst of all, the production is stellar. Every instrument is given its chance to shine. Yet the music has a dark and brooding tone, in part because of the way each piece was written, and in part because of the tone that the engineer/musician employed. I think I am most pleased with the drum sound, which is both heavy and crystal clear at the same time. Older Iron Maiden releases did not have both the necessary wallop and the gossamer hi-range that is needed for drums on a good metal release.\n\nThe vocals are superb, and is one of Bruce's best performances ever. Witness the lines about halfway through The Legacy, when he sings \" Left to all our golden sons; all to pick up on the peace / You could have all to them - a little chance... at least. \" I can't think of a better example of the sheer power and strength of Bruce's high-pitched voice. \n\nNicko's drums give this album the driving force that it needs to be their best album. Nicko is not the fastest or more technically skilled drummer in metal, but he doesn't need to be. Just listen to the beat he creates with the China cymbal in \"The Pilgrim\" at about 1:37. It's absolutely brilliant, something that will stick out to you even after the album is over. \n\nSteve's bass is standout as usual. Memorable moments include the intro to \"For the Greater Good of God\" and the thumping rhythm to the end of \"The Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg\". \n\nGuitarwork, both lead and rhythm is also great. Iron Maiden's riffs are some of the most influential in all of metal, and yet they come up with great new ones here. Listen to the simple, yet exceedingly heavy introduction to \"Brighter Than A Thousand Suns\", the lead line behind the chorus in \"For the Greater Glory of God\", or the classical piece at the beginning of \"The Legacy\". Adrian's solo in \"Lord of Light\" is one of his best and is a highlight of the album. \n\nFinally, the songwriting - the aspect that will make or break an album. Iron Maiden are pros at songwriting, and it shows in this album. The album has a distinctly epic feel, something that should not be unfamiliar to Iron Maiden fans. The lyrics are all profound and serious, dealing with war, darkness, life struggles, conspiracy, religion, and patriotism. Yes the album is long, and yet some reviewers complained about that! I want to say thank you, Iron Maiden, for fitting so much good music on this disc. Iron Maiden did not create this to be their next \"Number of the Beast\" or \"Piece of Mind\", consisting of a combination of epics and short and easily-identifiable anthems like \"The Trooper\" and \"Run to the Hills\". Those are all great pieces, yet with A Matter of Life and Death, Maiden has done something more. They've been together for over 30 years, and they've showcased a mature and profound piece of music as a fruit of their work. Thanks Bruce, Dave, Steve, Adrian, Janick, and Nicko. \n\nI made the controversial statement that this is Maiden's best. Go out and buy it and give it a few months of listening. Maybe you'll agree. It's hard to deny, though, that this is an excellent heavy metal release. \n\nBest songs: For the Greater Good of God, The Legacy, The Longest Day\n",
        "\nIron Maiden is known mostly for their 80's material which produced a range of classic songs from the rocking Killers to the epic Rime of the Ancient Mariner, but for some reason Seventh Son of a Seventh Son is lumped in with the six albums before it despite being neither rocking or epic in even the slightest sense. Most people would consider it a twin to the synth-laden Somewhere in Time, when in reality it's the easy going songs of No Prayer for the Dying or Fear of the Dark with some poor keyboard work tossed onto it. You say one of their best? I say second worst, beaten in level of lameness only by the laughable Virtual XI.\n\nThe album opens with Moonchild, one of my least favorites ever released by the band. It all starts with a boring little poem after which comes a horrible keyboard intro, which is just the same few notes repeated over and over with some very out of place heavy guitar parts played over it. Inspired by the intro to Metallica's Battery undoubtedly, but it doesn't carry a hundredth of the power. It's not just the intro that sucks; the bulk of the song manages to be even worse. Bruce is singing much heavier than normal but tries too hard, once again like he wants the song to be a wannabe Battery. You'd expect at least decent some riffage for a song like Moonchild, but all you get is a quiet quasi-acoustic melody played quickly. The song is just completely disjointed and doesn't know what it wants to be. It finishes with the lame keyboard intro played again, only this time with nausea causing screams added on by Bruce.\n\nThankfully after that shitfest the album takes a positive turn with Infinite Dreams. The intro is very melodic and very captivating and completely holds me for the first couple minutes. What happens next? All of the sudden the verses become anthemic with sugar-sweet keyboards layered on, like Iron Maiden adopted the bastard child of Asia after being raped by Dio. The scream leading to the solos gives a much needed break of heaviness to the song, but it ends with more uninspired keyboard-laden ballady garbage. Can I Play With Madness is next in line, a short power pop rock track that should have been released by an 80's radio band, not Iron Maiden.\n\nThe Evil That Men Do is yet another poppy and accessible song, but was probably written to attract the opposite sex and not mainstream success. From the groovy to the sappy loved-up lyrics (I would bleed for her, if I could only see her now) to the melodramatic prechorus this song is groupie bait. Already three out of four songs on the album show clear pop influenced and while that stops with the title track, the pain does not stop. The beginning is just as majestic as you'd expect an Iron Maiden epic to be, with their famous guitar gallop to a great performance by Nicko and Bruce singingly clearly and operatically. Unfortunately any hopes of another classic epic like those before it are crushed with the absolutely horrible chorus. As if repeating a song's title with a title like \"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\" isn't annoying enough, it's repeated eight times and without any sense of melody at all. The song follows on for a bit longer and up comes a quiet interlude. Unlike the one in Rime of the Ancient Mariner, it serves absolutely no point aside to pad the song into the nine minute region and to tell a little bit more about a vapid story regarding a generic kid who unlocks his true potential, tries to save the world, and such. On an upside the instrumental section at the end does slay, being three minutes of pure metal guitar soloing.\n\nThe remaining three songs hardly even deserve special mention, since they aren't really remarkable in any way at all. You are treated to some beautiful melodies courtesy of Dave in The Prophecy, but the self-backing vocals in the chorus are so ridiculous it sounds like it could have been inspired by the \"No, no, no! No fucking lies!\" from Anthrax's Efilnikufesin. The Clairvoyant gives you a lovely start that builds up perfectly with a great bass intro, then riff, then melody but falls apart when the rest of the song is just more of the same dark melodic garbage, and the same exact thing happens all over again with Only the Good Die Young. \n\nWhat's really sad is the fact that they chose to close the album with it. When the four previous albums all closed with grandiose epics, Seventh Son of a Seventh Son closed with a four minute second-rate rocker. Then the band decides to wrap it all up with a wanky balls out part. While that works for silly but fun rockers like Die With Your Boots On, it does not when we are talking about closing an entire album, and especially not when you extend it to a ridiculous thirty plus seconds.\n\nOverall what you have is an album that goes in a dozen different directions, a couple of which took the correct path, but most just drove the album straight off a cliff. Dave's guitar work is brilliant here and Nicko is pretty much at the top of his game as well, but the rest of the band was unfocused. Martin Birch could have done better as well; the guitars are too light, the keyboards too prominent, and the album as a whole too soft. Never before has a band taken such a sharp fall from one album to the next.\n",
        "\nA Matter of Life and Death can be considered Iron Maiden's most ambitious album to date. By their own admission, the songs were influenced more by the music of prog bands such as Yes, Genesis and Wishbone Ash than by the energy or pace of the metal which we all know and love from them. This is apparent not only in the mammoth length of most of the songs, but in the musical tone of the album. In the mellow intros, it feels almost as if the band is performing right next to you saying, \"Hey, check this out.\"\n\n\"Different World\" is a simple and enjoyable way to kick off the album and it could be argued that if the rest of the album followed in the same vein with the same energy, this would have been more appealing to fans of classic Maiden (like me!). Not a band content to live off their glory days, from there the album eases into a much more deliberate and calculated affair. Not a single song after the first track is under five minutes in length. This can make the album seem tedious and bloated if one decides to listen to the CD from beginning to end. However, if each song is taken on its own one can better appreciate the simplicity of the riffs and the complexity of the structure without asking, \"Is it over yet?\"\n\n\"These Colours Don't Run\" is a powerful song about how every soldier in every country probably feels when called to duty. The lyrics express a universal sense of humanity without coming across as sentimental or patronizing. \"The Pilgrim\" is about an extreme right-wing religious cult who leave their homeland in anger and shame in order to found a new colony where no one opposes their religious beliefs for fear of persecution. They will be the masters now! They call the new nation, America. Haha... It would be very easy to go into great detail about the lyrics of each song, but that just gives you an idea of how thought-provoking and intelligent A Matter of Life and Death is. \"For the Greater Good of God\"... nah, I'll need another paragraph to talk about that one. The music, of course, is just as challenging. Their sound is a natural progression from the previous two albums up to the present. However, there are some aspects of this album which would have been better left alone or reworked.\n\n\"Out of the Shadows\" should probably not have been an Iron Maiden song. At least, not a song that should have made it onto a full-length album. It's acoustic riffs and gentle vibe just seem out of place here. Also, even listening to one song at a time one can't help but wonder why almost every song needs to begin with a moody instrumental intro backed up by soft vocals. With a few exceptions, most notably \"The Longest Day,\" Maiden would've been better off just getting to the song instead of doing an unnecessary buildup. In addition, the eighth-triplet riff near the end of \"The Legacy\" is derivative of many other Iron Maiden songs which somewhat lessens the impact of the ending.\n\nIn terms of performance, it's Iron friggin Maiden!!! The youthful energy of their classic albums is long gone, but none of these guys have lost anything in terms of musical ability. This is by no means a sellout album or even a more accessible mainstream album. On A Matter of Life and Death, Iron Maiden have melded metal and prog into something that doesn't rely on frequent time signature changes or sixty-fourth note solos to amaze listeners because this is a band that forsakes ostentation for the greater good of the song.\n\nOverall, this is an album for fans who enjoy a long journey with each song. With each listen one can find nuances of melody, rhythm, harmony and can appreciate the ambition and complexity of this album. Simply put, Iron Maiden still rules.\n",
        "\nHonestly the worst thing this band has ever done. Ever. Period. I've loved Maiden since as long as I can remember, but I can not bring myself to say something good about this album with a straight face. It's that bad.\n\nLet's get something straight, Maiden has been doing the same thing ever since No Prayer for the Dying, nothing has changed since that album.... except the songs are exponentially longer, far more repetitive (if you can imagine such a thing), less imaginative, and for some reason I'll never understand, even more highly praised. The one phrase chorus has plagued this band ever since they got the good sense to boot Bayley out and bring back the god that is Dickinson, the annoyance experienced on Brave New World is amplified by some inhuman number on this atrocity. Brighter Than A Thousand Suns is the most boring, plodding, piss all annoying track I've possibly ever heard. And this is coming from Iron Maiden! The gods! WHY??! Steve Harris is one of my favorite bassists and possibly my prime influence in my own playing and writing, and here he is, talking a thousand steps backwards from the unabashed progressivism of Seventh Son of a Seventh Son!\n\nI understand that they can never top the songwriting genius of Powerslave or SSoaSS, but this isn't even humorous. I can honestly compare this to Metallica, and feel perfectly justified. The deal with St. Anger, the whole \"the only reason this song is 8 minutes long is because it is quite literally a four minute song repeated front to back twice\" is ever apparent here. It takes damn near a half an hour to listen to the last three songs. Read that last sentence again. That's right. I could understand if the songs structures fucking varied every once in a while, but they never do. They're not epic, they're not progressive, they're boring and plodding.\n\nTo be fair, there are a few decent riffs thrown in here and there, but it's hard to find amidst all the recycled, boring, and unimaginative pap that fills this record.\n\nAs much as I love IM, as much as they've influenced me, this has proven once and for all that they are far from infallible. I'll never understand why the drooling fanboys eat this shit up so readily and are so quick to hail it as a masterpiece. Listen to this, then listen to Number of the Beast or Piece of Mind.... you'll see what I mean.\n\nDitch this shit.\n",
        "\nThis is where 'Maiden' began to shape their classic form. Here 'Maiden' stood with their best line up and created a fully epic heavy metal album. 'The Number Of The Beast' was still in the middle between Dickinson era and the NWOBHM era, but in this album they were fully matured to their epic style and created an album which considers to one of the best classic of heavy metal from all times.\n\nWe start off immediately with 'Where Eagles Dare' which is based upon the same movie from 1968, which talks about a rescue operation of an american general from the nazi's claws in WWII. A short drumming section to introduce the new drummer comes in and then the riffing taking over immediately. It's amazing how such simple power chords riffing can produce a lot of atmosphere without too much variation, maybe this marvelous atmosphere increases more and more due to the epic vocals of Dickinson which rise his tons flawleslly and has an exciting vibe, anyway the riffing backs up the vocals perfectly and flows extremely well for the whole song. The soloing is also pretty epic and dives a lot with a bit psychedelic sense within and keeps on the precious atmosphere of this song without letting go. Very intense opener track, just puts you straight into the magical mood of this album. 'Revelations' is the half ballad of the album. It comes in with moderate riffing which sounds pretty similar to 'Black Sabbath' and has a badass vibe, then there is a nice chilling bridge and it turns to a sweeping melodic leading guitar which sounds just incredible. There is a fair bunch of powerful riffs here and pretty intense C-PART, and overall it's a very epic track as the opener one. It is maybe an improved version of 'Children Of The Damned (from their former album) if you wish to look it at that way. \n\nThen we have 'Flight Of Icarus' which is one of Maiden's well known hits. The verses flowing alright and the chorus is superbly catchy and epic. It isn't cheesy too much, it's actually pretty good one, but it's very obvious that this song was meant to be the commercial single from this album.\n\nThis album could be a real masterpiece if it was shorter. It isn't a length problem, this album isn't overlong, but there are some tracks which aren't really at the same league with the highlights of the album. The row of 'Still Life', 'Quest For Fire' and 'Sun And Steel' is a row of fillers, honestly. These tracks sounds alright but they doesn't leaves a mark on you after you listen to it, as opposed to to the rest of the album. It doesn't sounds epic or unique and feels like a let down. However, after these tracks comes the incredibly epic closing track which take this album back to it's high level : 'To Tame A Land'. This song is one of Maiden's more progressive songs to date, and it's such a damn good way to close this album. It begins slowly and then becomes heavy at the verse, the chorus just rises up and leads to an astonishing instrumental section and so it closes up just awesome and sounds flawlessly epic. Easily, one of the greatest songs from this band, and that's means a lot.\n\n'Piece Of Mind' marks the first level in the progression of 'Iron Maiden'. It has some of their best songs along some average fillers. Anyway, this album manages to be very enjoyable and even exciting sometimes, you just can't miss such a great album if you didn't listened it before. It combines the heavy metal style with an epic feeling pretty easily and I'm sure that each metalhead will like this one.\n",
        "\nAh, there\u2019s nothing like Iron Maiden live. You can be sure, Iron Maiden will always put on a good show. And in Death on the Road is no exception, for the most part.\n\nThe set list greatly resembles that of their previous DVD, Rock in Rio: new songs mixed in with their classics. So basically this is a show that switches from their early straightforward gallop-ers, to their new progressive epics. This provides the set with a good balance and chemistry. The highlight of the set, of course, is Paschendale; mainly because of the guitar work, but also because of the theatrics. Lord of the Flies should NOT have been on this DVD, nor be in any Maiden set for the rest of time. Throw in Powerslave or Aces High instead, and leave that garbage out. An interesting note is that for the encore, Maiden opens with Journeyman, and slows things right down before the monster that is The Number of the Beast. This adds some nice flavor to the set.\n\nThe audio quality is great. It captures live Maiden perfectly, especially the 5.1 Dolby Digital version.\n\nThe special features DVD is interesting, and definitely a bonus. Although, I wouldn\u2019t watch it more than once, as it does drag on. It\u2019s fun to see the creation of the new album.\n\nVisually this DVD sucks. The quality is great, and crystal clear. But the editing is terrible. When I first watched this DVD, I had no clue what I was looking at for the first half hour. The camera jumps around so often, I almost had a seizure. The longest the shot stays on a single camera is probably 1 second, the average being 0.25 seconds of course. Literally.\n\nDeath on the Road would get a significant point boost if it wasn\u2019t for the editing. Overall a good DVD, with some bad editing.\n",
        "\nSometimes you just want to kick back and jam to some old 80s heavy metal, and this would be the ideal single to do it to. Iron Maiden were just getting started with this, and they still played their punkish, gritty style of NWOBHM that was just beginning to get them into the public eye around the late 70s. Paul Di'Anno was still at the helm, and I like his voice more every time I hear it, what with his punkish, street-smart attitude and gruff voice. The band followed suit, playing a rougher style of music then they would when Dickinson took the helm and the world by storm.\n\nThe first song here is the title track, arguably the simplest song on their debut. It kicks off with a galloping drum beat before the riff kicks in, and it's a catchy little rocker all the way through. The chorus isn't complex in the least, but it was the 70s, and you just needed to be able to sing along. It tells a tale of rebellious youth, the freedom of being young and alive, and of being left to 'run free.' The basslines are jumpy and energetic, and the guitar trills are confident in their runs through this rather short song.\n\nThen we get \"Burning Ambition\", which has never been seen again after this little single. It's even shorter than the first track, and more laid back, but not a ballad by any means. Lyrically, it seems to be a contemptuous song, venting anger at a mysterious woman who seems to have done Di'Anno wrong. Definetly a 70s rocker, it cruises by with an extremely catchy chorus that never comes out of my head, and some rather energetic drum beats, along with the nostalgic, homegrown guitar lines.\n\nThe cover is just a classic piece of Maiden history, depicting a young man, well, running free. And likewise, this is a classic piece of metal history if you are sitting there holding it in your hands (which I am sadly not). It's a noticable sign of what Maiden would become with their first two albums, and well worth a short listen. Recommended to Maiden diehards.\n",
        "\nSeventh Son of a Seventh Son is one of Iron Maiden's most acclaimed albums and with good reason. The Evil that Men Do has always been a standard track in my opinion and it makes for a great single with it's catchy feel. The song with an amazing harmony which stands out over virtually any other Iron Maiden song, from that opening few seconds you can tell you got an awesome song ahead.\n\nThe verses have a fast gallop throughout them which makes the song very enjoyable and headbangable and the lyrics of them are very though provoking and deep without sounding corner. Then we get to the bridge... and boy what a bridge, I could go on for ages about that bridge. It just alternates between 'Living on a razors edge' and 'Balancing on a ledge' but sounds so uplifting yet at the same time it inforces the negativity viewed in the song. The chorus is a very basic chorus but don't take that as a bad thing, it makes the song a great anthem and an amazing live number. Adrian's solo is one of his best here too.\n\nThe Evil That Men Do is definitely a Maiden classic and one of their best songs to date however, the real reason to get this single is because of the B-Sides it contains, 2 remakes of two classics from their debut album with Bruce Dickinson on vocals as apposed to Paul Di'Anno; Prowler and Charlotte the Harlot.\n\nI never really viewed Paul as a bad singer, I felt the songs he did do with Maiden were done spectacularly. However Bruce Dickinson completely outclasses him with these Paul Di'Anno classics, especially in the epic Charlotte the Harlot. Bruce sings these songs with a more aggressive voice, so I guess you can see this as a preview of what was to come in their next album No Prayer for the Dying.\n\nSo as the title says, this is an awesome song but the B-Sides are the real reason to buy this thing...\n",
        "\nInconsistent. That\u2019s the best word to describe \u2018Fear Of The Dark\u2019. After the hardrockish and far from epical \u2018No Prayer For The Dying\u2019 Iron Maiden attempted to make an album incorporating all styles they\u2019d played so far and more. This time the production was good again. Being transparent and not too much in your face. Gers was getting used to being in the band by now and Bruce Dickinson was singing like he used to again. So far, so good.\n\n\u2018Be Quick or Be Dead\u2019 could have come straight from the \u2018No Prayer\u2026\u2019 sessions and was a perfect speedy opener for the album. With \u2018Afraid To Shoot Strangers\u2019, \u2018Fear Of The Dark\u2019 and \u2018Chilhoods End\u2019 the band presented their fans a threesome of extremely high quality epic songs which were simply mindblowing in all facets. Unfortunately \u2018Fear is The Key\u2019, \u2018The Fugitive\u2019 and The Apparition\u2019 were typical Iron Maiden songs yet lacked something. Kind of what you would like to call \u2018fillers\u2019. Adequate yet soon to be forgotten.\n\nSo here we have described about 58% of the album. How about the rest? That\u2019s where it all went terribly wrong. The hideous attempt at imitating AC/DC with a hint of Golden Earing called \u2018Form Hell To Eternity\u2019 is a farce an absolutely unworthy. \u2018Wasting Love\u2019 is everything Iron Maiden opposed in the eighties: a hideous radio friendly rock love song. And it\u2019s not even a good one! The awful singalong choruses of \u2018Chains of Misery\u2019 and \u2018Weekend Warrior\u2019 are so cheesy it\u2019s almost impossible to describe! \u2018Judas Be My Guide\u2019 was deadly boring by the way.\n\nOnly four songs worthy of their legacy. Simple math would say:\n4/12 really good songs: 33,33 points. Plus good sound and excellent performance by Dickinson = 53 points.\n",
        "\nThe Number of the Beast is one of Iron Maiden's most well known albums, and seems to have had an impact on the metal genre as a whole, with various critics naming it one of the best metal albums ever. With Paul Di'Anno replaced with Bruce Dickinson, Iron Maiden had to change their sound to some degree due to the more 'operatic' style of their new singer, which spawned the trademark Maiden sound which they still use today. While it isn't as good as Killers, it is still more than a worthy follow up and while not being the classic some say it is it still remains pretty damn good, if somewhat overrated.\n\nMaiden's sound changed considerably with this album, with them opting for a more traditional Heavy Metal sound as opposed to the NWOBHM/Punk influence they previously held. While before it sounded as if the music on display was less thought out and simply raged ahead without as much thought to how each song was constructed, on here it is more streamlined and every note sounds as if it were carefully put in place. The crystal clear production accentuates this point. That is not to say it is a bad thing, as the tracks on this record are mostly high quality. It is generally consistent and packed full of dueling solos and awesome riffing. Iron Maiden knows how to make a good song, and it shows here with such tracks like 'Invaders', '22 Acacia Avenue', the title track, 'Run to the Hills', and the classic closer, 'Hallowed be thy Name'. Unsurprisingly, these songs became sort of Metal anthems, and to a large majority of people they are what comes into their heads when someone mentions Iron Maiden. About half of this album remains in their live set today which makes some songs seem overplayed, but they are mostly still competent songs in their own right.\n\nBut while a large majority of this is excellent, there are two songs on here in particular which bring it down. The first one of them is 'The Prisoner', which despite having some awesome soloing is boring and predictably in the verses and choruses. The second is 'Gangland', a song which is sub par compared to what else is on display here. That it is built around a drum beat and not a killer riff would explain why it is a throwaway track. It is very repetitive as well, not a good thing when the song is only 3:49 in length.\n\nThe highlight of the album, however, nearly makes up for it. Hallowed Be Thy Name is simply a metal masterpiece, and perhaps even the best track they have ever written. It starts off with an acoustic intro which then leads into a terrific riff with Dickinson\u2019s trademark vocal performance. It then slows down at around 4:06 and leads into awesome fast paced soloing after which a riff is repeated a number of times. Towards the end the vocals come back in with Dickinson holding the last note for around ten seconds after which the song ends. Such a track is rightfully recognized as among the best things to ever come out of the NWOBHM movement, as one listen to it can justify.\n\nSo while not being up to the standards of \u2018Killers\u2019, this is still a solid Heavy Metal album. It is not necessarily the classic some say it is and more than half of it is overplayed to exhaustion, which can sometimes lead to one skipping over tracks like \u2018Run to the Hills\u2019 simply because said person doesn\u2019t feel like listening to it for the 500th time, but it is still more than worth a listen. Its influence on the metal scene at the time was undoubtedly big and there are many people who still worship at the altar of it, but one gets the sense that it is a little overrated.\n",
        "\nFollowing up the excellent debut album wouldn't have been an easy task, but it is a testament to Iron Maiden's skills as songwriters and musicians that they not only created another excellent album but one which improves on nearly every aspect of the previous record. It saw the replacement of Dennis Stratton with Adrian Smith, which in my opinion was a good decision and I feel had it not been for the arrival of Smith the songs on here would not be as good as they are. This would also be the last record with Di'Anno on it, which can be either a good or bad thing depending on ones opinion.\n\nMusically, this picks up where 'Iron Maiden' left off. Still retaining a strong NWOBHM sound, it increases the punk influence to create a grittier sound than what came before it. The riffs have improved by a fair amount which is probably due to Adrian Smith arriving, and have a more 'savage' sound to them. They are probably more melodic this time around, which is certainly not a bad thing. The soloing has also improved, and has a sort of 'dreamy' quality to it at times. The bass plays a much more prominent role as the production makes it easily audible among the mix, and it even has some of it's own lines here and there, while the drumming is average. Paul Di'Anno's voice is still as gruff as it ever was, although on here he uses more of a range and utilises screams here and there.\n\nThe songwriting is a departure from the debut, in which it was mostly straightforward verse chorus structure with the exception of Phantom of the Opera. This time around they throw in a few breaks in here and there, as is seen halfway through 'Wrathchild', and introduce some more intros to songs. While unfortunately there are no seven minute epics like Phantom of the Opera this time around, the quality of the tracks as a whole more than makes up for it.\n\nAs for highlights, it is difficult to choose as every song has it's moments. 'Wrathchild' is a catchy song which starts off with a short bass intro before moving onto a midpaced melodic riff with soloing in between the verses. As said before, there is a great break halfway through before it returns to normal. The second instrumental of the album, 'Genghis Khan', cycles between fast and slow with the slow parts being a build up to the faster parts in most cases. The excellent galloping riff which comes a minute in is genius, while the lead out is great consisting of slow soloing. The title track has a brooding bass intro in which Di'Anno does some awesome screams which lasts for a minute or so before perhaps the best riff on the album comes in. The choruses are catchy and it has some more great soloing thrown in. Finally, 'Purgatory' is another fast song with some excellent melody.\n\nTo sum it up, Killers is indeed a lost classic. Unfortunately it is sometimes passed over for the debut album or Dickinson -era Maiden , which is a pity as some of their best stuff is on here and it is better than both the previous and following album.\n",
        "\nThroughout my years of listening to metal, I have listened to many NWOBHM releases from both bands who released a single and split up and ones which would later become famous. The movement as a whole was one of the better ones which have happened in the Metal world, with a large percentage of the bands being worth listening to at least once, from the unknown basement bands to the bands at the forefront of it. Sure, a lot of it wasn't very original in a lot of cases and quite a few offered nothing new but the releases during that period were a great excuse to simply crank the stereo up and rock out.\n\nIron Maiden's debut, however, stands head and shoulders above the rest of the NWOBHM pack. There is something about this album which sets it apart from all other releases of the movement, and after listening to this album it is easy to see just how they became the metal staple they are today. There are few records from the NWOBHM movement which stand up to this, few that offer the same raw intensity, that contain soloing as impeccable as is seen on here, and have songwriting as effective and captivating. \n\nIf I were to sum up this album in one word, it would be 'energy'. The music on display here is chock full of it, coming from a young, energetic band which have finally, after existing for five years, established a solid lineup and recorded a debut. The music on here is very different to Dickinson -era Maiden. While the later records would be more polished with every note sounding like it was carefully put in place, this screams out from the underground with raw energy, not caring about the consequences. There is a much more prominent NWOBHM influence on here which they would later shed in favour of a more traditional Heavy Metal sound, and so it is unlike anything else they would later release with the exception of Killers.\n\nThe individual performances on here are great and each member of the band sound as if they are giving their all. Paul Di'Anno's voice is gruff and low, sounding quite similar to a punk rock vocalist. While he doesn't do any of the screams he would later employ on the follow up, his voice fits the songs perfectly and he performs them better than Dickinson ever has or will. The riffing on here is savage and unrestrained yet still containing a strong sense of melody and is mostly midpaced. The solos are excellent and put a large majority of ones seen on other Metal releases to shame. The bass mostly follows the guitar lines and while it is not as prominent as it would be on later releases it is still clearly audible, while the drums provide an effective rhythm. \n\nAs for the individual songs on here, there aren't really any bad ones. They range from straightforward metal tunes such as 'Prowler' and 'Running Free' to the ballads of the album, 'Remember Tomorrow' and 'Strange World', and an excellent instrumental is thrown in for good measure. But there is one song on here the puts nearly everything from the NWOBHM movement to shame, and that song is 'Phantom of the Opera'. Being the longest song on the album, it is an impeccable song and one of the best Maiden has ever written. Starting off with a short lived intro it then moves into a perfect fast paced galloping riff that the band is renowned for with catchy vocal lines over the top. Around the two minute mark it slows down into a simple yet effective bass line which leads into an amazing slow paced emotional solo. At 3:20, it speeds up a little with a twin guitar harmony which leads into a midpaced riff over which some more twin guitar soloing comes in. Finally, at 6:20 it returns to it's original pace and riff to finish off the song.\n\nSteve Harris had to endure almost five years of constant lineup changes, playing in small clubs and generally not getting anywhere before a stable lineup was formed, and it is damn good that he did it. I can say with all honesty that this is one of the highlights not only of the whole NWOBHM movement, but also an album that stands up to the Heavy Metal genre as an early classic. As said before, one listen to this album confirms why Iron Maiden got where they are now, and this album is not only recommended, but highly essential to any respectable metal collection.\n",
        "\nThis EP was released in the same year as Maiden's debut, and so it contains two songs off that ('Sanctuary' and 'Phantom of the Opera'), the song 'Drifter' which would appear as a studio recording on 'Killers', and 'Women in Uniform' from the previously released single of the same name.\n\nThe performances on the live recordings are fairly good and sound a lot like in the studio. Paul Di'Anno's voice is in top form and he hits every note perfectly, while the two guitarists play every riff to perfection and improvise on the soloing. The drums are competent as is the bass. While they have too long a silence in the middle of Sanctuary and they extend the soft part in Drifter for far too long, they still play to perfection most of the time. \n\nThe extra studio track, Women in Uniform, is a fun rocker which is fairly typical of the NWOBHM movement. It has some great riffing combined with catchy choruses. It does get a bit repetitive but overall it's a good track.\n\nAs for the production, it brings the EP down a bit. While this is not as prominent on the studio recording, it affects the live recordings to some degree. The sound is muffled and doesn't really capture the live atmosphere that well. Crowd noise is kept to a minimum, which can either be a good or bad thing depending on preference. I myself don't mind it much, so that aspect is fine. The mix is similar to what was seen on Killers, with all instruments being heard clearly.\n\nIf you happen to stumble across this (which would be unlikely nowadays) I would definitely recommend purchasing it. It shows a young energetic band fresh off the release of their debut album tearing it up in a small club with an energetic crowd. A fun little EP from one of the masters of the NWOBHM movement.\n",
        "\nAfter the fans had become used to getting improvingly epic albums from Iron Maiden with equally improving productions, the band for some reason decided to release a back-to-the-roots kind of album as they were drifting at that point and looking for a way to be reborn. Dickinson had already tried some things solo and he brought in new guy Janick Gers to replace the unreplacable Adrian Smith.\n\nThis resulted in the \u2018No Prayer For The Dying\u2019 album on which Dickinson sung far less theatrical and more like a regular rock vocalist. To be honoust, this was of course beneath him and nobody saw the use of this. Neither did he in the end, seeing he\u2019s back to square one these days and remembering his stroingpoints. Also the songmaterial was more compact and \u2013 except for maybe \u2018Mother Russia\u2019 - there were no epic songs to be found this time. Finishing it up was the very basic and dull straight forward production.\n\nThe titletrack would have been an instant classic if it had had the production of \u2013 let\u2019s say \u2013 Seventh Son or Somewhere in Time. Try to imagine that and then tell me what you think! It is really a great song. Same goes for \u2018Run Silent, Run Deep\u2019. And how about \u2018Fates Warning\u2019 which still gives me goosebumps to this day when I hear the guitars interact while Dickinson sings the verses. If I would make a greatest hits collection, these songs would definitely be on it. \u2018Tailgunner\u2019 was a great uptempo opener by the way, but lyrically too much of an \u2018Aces High part 2\u2019.\n\nThe only thing I can complain about are - as said - the production and some of the songmaterial. \u2018Holy smoke\u2019 and \u2018Bring Your daughter\u2019 are both funny in their own way but not suit the album at all. I do not care if 'Bring Your Daughter' was a hit somewhere, it just did not fit the album. \u2018Hooks in You\u2019, \u2018The Assassin\u2019 and \u2018Public Enema nr One\u2019 are bearable and adequate at most. \u2018Mother Russia\u2019 surely does have its moments but never really reaches the magnificence of earlier epics. \n\nI didn\u2019t care they released an album without epics. They\u2019d done that before on \u2018Killers\u2019. So what! I rather hear this than an album with only epics (boring!) If I say Iron Maiden, I say eighties. 'No Prayer...' did not come close to all their pervious work but it did have its moments. Enough moments actually to make this a decent album.\n",
        "\nIron Maiden was in a very successfull point of their career back in the 80's. Their best works are from that era, with world tours year after year. After that heavy metal bible, \"The Number of the Beast\", Maiden started to develop a new kind of sound, wich will known in the future as the 'Maiden' sound, a sound that made them unique and the best band of metal music. That sound is very progressive, and also with some power metal ingredients, something like Rainbow. In \"Piece of Mind\" and \"Powerslave\" those changes appear, and with \"Somewhere in Time\" it's clear that Maiden changed their way of making metal. \"SIT\" and also Judas Priest's \"Turbo\" were rejected by metalheads back those days, because those records were 'softer', because they used too many synths and keyboards. So everyone was expectant, waiting to hear if Maiden would improve after the 'failure' that \"SIT\" represented.\n\n\nThe result is \"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\". Every second of this album is perfect. That's the word: perfect. Everything here is right, everything is well done. Even the 'pop' song \"Can I Play With Madness\" is great. This is the peak of Maiden, a peak that only will be reached with \"A Matter of Life and Death\". Bruce Dickinson starts to sing great, with a cleaner and versatile voice. Murray's and Smith's guitar playing, as great as always, like the rest of the band, completed by the classic Steve Harris' 'galloping' bass playing, and the great Nicko McBrain's drumplaying. The whole band is great, and the change of a single element changes the sound completely... just listen \"No Prayer for the Dying\" or \"Virtual XI\".\n\n\nAnother great point is composition. Harris can write heavy metal anthems so easily that scares. And Smith's hand on composing is also outstanding, Maiden has a different level, a different maturity degree in their music when Adrian is present.\n\n\n\"Moonchild\" opens the album. It starts with acoustic guitars and soft singing. Then, a synth part, that cuts dramatically into a fast rhythm, the first show of the 'progressive' elements of the album. The lyrics are good, the 'Lucifer's my name!!!' scream is fucking great. After this track, we have a beautiful ballad, \"Infinite Dreams\". Again, the rhythm changes are excellent, from soft and slow electric guitars to fast solos. \"Can I Play With Madness\" is conflictive. Back in the 80's, it was considered as 'pop', but it's very catchy and funny, and nowadays, this song is a classic. \"The Evil That Men Do\" is the perfect Maiden anthem. It follows the typical structure of a single, and has a goddamn catchy chorus. You just sing 'the evil that men do goes on and oooooon', all day long.\n\n\nThe title track is perfect. As simple as that. Those atmospheres, those rhythm changes, those choruses at the start... and Dickinson saying 'so it shall be written, so it shall be done...' it's another Maiden classic. The solos at the end are great. Next, we have \"The Prophecy\". The rhytm is catchy, more galloping metal, but a little slowler. Man, those acoustic guitars at the end of the song... I bow down to those guitars, after the loud part, represented by the 'metal' instruments (the electric guitars, the bass guitars and drums) comes that calmed part, closing the song. \"The Clairvoyant\" is another Maiden classic, featuring more galloping metal, with a great bass intro by Harris. Lyrics again are great, in my opinion, the best lyrics of the album. Finally, \"Only the Good Die Young\" closes the album, with more catchy choruses and an outstanding ending, with the same formula of \"The Prophecy\", after the loud ending, the acoustic guitars with soft singing, the same guitars and singing than in the beginning of the album.\n\n\nThis is a mandatory album, as simple as that. You must own it if you consider a true metalhead. Yes, it's progressive, but not the same as Dream Theather, this 'progressive' metal is much better played. Buy this one and bow down to the best Iron Maiden album of all time so far (and probably, the best metal album too).\n",
        "\nThe reunion of Iron Maiden\u2019s classic line-up in 1999 revitalised its energy and has consistently improved its output, each new release being better than the last and the most recent album \u2018A Matter of Life and Death\u2019 matching the greatness of their classic period. EMI have taken full advantage of this resurgence of interest in the ageing East End boys, peddling endless live albums and best-of compilations each year and occasionally offering something genuinely original for the hardcore fans. The monstrous \u2018Eddie\u2019s Archive,\u2019 released in 2002, is a compact and mostly-well-thought-out gateway to rare and classic \u2019Maiden material that was released alongside the appalling and unnecessary greatest hits collection \u2018Edward the Great\u2019 for the n00bies.\n\nThe Archive is itself a nice collectable piece, a metal box moulded with the face of the band\u2019s ever-present zombie mascot Eddie, and includes three previously unreleased double-disc albums. Also included are a nice shot glass and a family tree of the band\u2019s discography and changing line-up, which is especially helpful when viewed alongside the time-spanning \u2018Best of the B\u2019sides\u2019 included here. Two of the albums are live, \u2018The BBC Archives\u2019 featuring material from 1979, \u201980, \u201982 and \u201988, and the excellent \u2018Beast Over Hammersmith\u2019 capturing a single show in \u201982. The final album collects together almost every B-side the band has ever recorded, saving penniless fans the trouble of collecting expensive 7\u201d singles and allowing those who already have them all to save the wear and tear on the records, as well as insist that you really need to have the original artwork and everything or it isn\u2019t as good, but secretly wishing they\u2019d saved their money and waited for this.\n\n\nPART 1: THE BBC ARCHIVES\n\n\nThe first thing that\u2019s obvious when browsing the tracklist of these CDs is the repetition of songs, especially the titular \u2018Iron Maiden\u2019 which crops up a ridiculous four times; two times per disc. That\u2019s because this is a collection of four archived shows from the 1980s, and that namesake piece either opens or closes all of them. The first four tracks stem from a Friday Rock Show session in 1979, allowing fans to experience the long- (and easily-) forgotten line-up featuring Tony Parsons on guitar. The rest of the collection comes from live festivals, arranged out of chronological order in order to fit them onto the CDs. The 1980 line-up, with Paul Di\u2019Anno on vocals and Dennis Stratton on lead guitar, performs at Reading for the first six tracks of disc 2, while the mic is handed over to Bruce Dickinson (and the second guitar to Adrian Smith) for the 1982 Reading festival which occupies the last ten tracks of the first disc. The remainder of disc 2 jumps ahead to the 1988 Monsters of Rock festival at Donington with a similar line-up, although drummer Clive Burr had long been replaced by Nicko McBrain.\n\nIt\u2019s great to have these shows from different eras placed alongside each other, but as you\u2019ve probably just seen, the uneven time travelling is a little off-putting. It\u2019s also a shame to consider just how much was left out, not only from the shows featured \u2013 the 1988 show was a little longer, as seen in the \u2018Maiden England\u2019 video release \u2013 but from the rest of Iron Maiden\u2019s career. The Di\u2019Anno material is suitably rare, but the 1982 concert could easily have been replaced with something from a later time, especially considering that the \u2018Beast Over Hammersmith\u2019 CDs in this same archive come from roughly the same time and feature all the same songs in almost exactly the same order. At least the 1988 material provides something of a relief from this nostalgia for the early days, finally granting an official live release for the songs from \u2018Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\u2019: \u2018Moonchild,\u2019 \u2018Infinite Dreams,\u2019 and the title track. The rest of this collection has been performed and re-released so many times as to be unnecessary, however rare these specific performances of those songs may be.\n\n\nPART 2: BEAST OVER HAMMERSMITH\n\n\nThe most solid third of this collection, this really should have been Iron Maiden\u2019s first live album way back in 1982, but was never released. Showcasing the band at the very start of their \u2018classic\u2019 period, recorded several days before the landmark \u2018Number of the Beast\u2019 album was released, this excellent concert features almost the entire album amidst the best songs from the first two albums, all given a new perspective with Dickinson\u2019s operatic vocals. He hasn\u2019t quite established the familiar air siren wail just yet, but that\u2019s what makes this early material all the more interesting, especially when compared to 1985\u2019s definitive \u2018Live After Death.\u2019 This remains the final recording to feature drummer Clive Burr. The concert was also recorded on film under the same title, and can now be found on \u2018The History of Iron Maiden part 1: The Early Days\u2019 DVD, which is also great.\n\nThe band\u2019s early sound is captured perfectly here, as are the hints of the epic heavy metal monster Iron Maiden would become, with the lengthy classic \u2018Hallowed Be Thy Name\u2019 setting the template for pretty much every album-closing track forever afterward. Everything is played precisely, but with enough cute errors to authenticate the performance; it\u2019s just a shame that the set-list here is almost exactly the same as that on the BBC Archives. Highlights include the cool opener \u2018Murders in the Rue Morgue,\u2019 the ever-reliable \u2018Phantom of the Opera\u2019 and the entire performance of the \u2018Number of the Beast\u2019 material, wisely omitting the two weakest songs and even performing the B-side \u2018Total Eclipse,\u2019 which was later added to re-releases of the album anyway, and as such finds no place in:\n\n\nPART 3: BEST OF THE B\u2019SIDES\n\n\nThe part of the collection that\u2019s naturally the most valuable even for fans who own all the albums, but not the 7\u201d singles, this collection of 31 non-album songs is arranged in precise chronological order across the usual two discs. The most noticeable problem comes in the omission of certain songs found on the old singles, such as the cover of Thin Lizzy\u2019s \u2018Massacre\u2019 that would otherwise come towards the end of disc one. As the running time for each CD comes in with around 20 minutes to spare each, it\u2019s likely that this was due to contractual problems, which is a shame, though nothing to get really annoyed about considering the wealth of material here. (In fact, even further B-sides have spawned from the two studio albums produced since this collection, already necessitating some kind of future re-release by those greedy geezers at EMI).\n\nThe new artwork features an old-school Eddie, though unfortunately not painted by the truly old-school Derek Riggs, mischievously displaying his wrinkly walnut b\u2019side through the window of a tour bus for our appreciation. This is the bloke that knifed Margaret Thatcher to death on the cover of the 1980 single, so it\u2019s nice to see that the years have seasoned his transgressions somewhat. Disc one encompasses the B-sides from the band\u2019s first ten years, from the \u2018Running Free\u2019 single to \u2018Infinite Dreams,\u2019 while disc two covers the turbulent 1990s. The best thing about these B-sides are that they\u2019re almost completely frivolous and pointless, whether they\u2019re a silly comedy song, regurgitated live version or, as is most often the case, a cover song of a band Iron Maiden likes. This means that there\u2019s no noticeable drop in quality between the two decades, unlike the substantial drop reflected in the band\u2019s more bona fide material. The only immediate clue that the listener is being taken on a historical journey is the changing of vocals from Di\u2019Anno to Dickinson and then Blaze Bayley, with Dickinson returning for the finale, though more attentive or familiar listeners will notice the sound quality alternately improve and degenerate as the band moves between \u2018eras.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s great to have all of these songs presented here in this chronological manner, and although it may anger real completists, it was a wise decision to exclude repetitions, such as the endless live versions of \u2018Number of the Beast\u2019 and \u2018Drifter.\u2019 The covers are mostly adequately performed, the source material ranging from dangerously popular to hopelessly obscure, and it\u2019s nice to hear the band\u2019s apparent influences even when the legacy is hard to see. The re-recorded versions of older studio material, the titles marked with a year, are all pretty unnecessary, as Dickinson doesn\u2019t offer much to the Di\u2019Anno songs. It\u2019s always nice to see the infamous live version of \u2018Remember Tomorrow\u2019 surfacing in these collections, as this track was originally included on the \u2018Maiden Japan\u2019 E.P. when Di\u2019Anno was still singing. The \u2018Number of the Beast\u2019 single subsequently featured exactly the same performance, but with Dickinson overdubbed in a feeble attempt to warm him to new fans. The good part comes at the end, when Dickinson\u2019s \u2018thank you\u2019 is followed by one from Di\u2019Anno that someone forgot to erase. The live tracks on the second disc are valuable as the only official live songs recorded with Blaze.\n\nThe most interesting tracks are those that were never released on albums, such as \u2018Justice of the Peace\u2019 and \u2018Judgement Day\u2019 from 1994 that would have made their way onto \u2018The X Factor\u2019 album if a CD could only hold more than 80 minutes of music. The self-satisfied comedy songs \u2018The Sheriff of Huddersfield\u2019 and \u2018Black Bart Blues\u2019 don\u2019t invite repeated listens but can be quite entertaining, though Dickinsons\u2019 Yorkshireman impression of record label boss Rod Smallwood really smacks of a cheap Monty Python imitation. The funniest B-side of all isn\u2019t included here, either for reasons of time or taste: the classic \u2018Mission From \u2019Arry\u2019 from the \u20182 Minutes to Midnight\u2019 7\u201d, a seven minute argument between Nicko McBrain and Steve Harris over an on-stage miscommunication secretly recorded by Dickinson, which ends with Harris discovering the tape recorder and exclaiming, in muffled audio proximity, \u2018some c***\u2019s recording this.\u2019\n\n\nThe most disappointing aspect of Eddie\u2019s Archive is its lack of diversity, epitomised in its inclusion of both the 1982 Reading show and the 1982 Hammersmith show that are almost exactly the same. The B-sides collection is really this archive\u2019s saving grace, as the inclusion of live tracks with Blaze Bayley makes up for his lack of appearance on the archives, although there still seem to be enormous chunks of the band\u2019s history completely left out. The recent release of \u2018The Early Days\u2019 on DVD has hopefully got this Di\u2019Anno nostalgia out of everybody\u2019s system, and I eagerly anticipate further instalments of \u2018The History of Iron Maiden\u2019 series. In 2002, Eddie\u2019s Archive was collectable and problematic, but fairly complete. Five years later it\u2019s out of date and fairly pointless, the original \u2018limited edition\u2019 print being predictably extended due to demand, as per usual.\n\nIf the BBC Archives are truly the only Maiden material stored in Radio 1\u2019s vaults, this collection is forgivable, but still the weakest link in this box set (aside from the tangible extras, which at least could have been tackier). \u2018Beast Over Hammersmith\u2019 is a great live album that could stand alone, and the \u2018Best of the B\u2019Sides,\u2019 although entirely fan-oriented, would also succeed as an independent product. There are lots of fans worldwide, that\u2019s why they could ever make this ugly metal casket in the first place. EMI are sure to re-release this archive some time in a minutely revamped form, probably with a free badge or Eddie chew. \u201cUp the Irons!\u201d, or whatever.\n",
        "\nEvery metalhead knows Iron Maiden, right? They need no introduction; the NWOBHM kings and the gateway band for many a metalhead both old and new. This was their fourth full length, and it's one of their \"Golden Era\" classics, one of those albums that bands still pilfer from today, and one of the albums that still retains the energy and fun factor that made it so fucking great in the first place. They've perfected the sound they created with Number of the Beast, and everything sounds first-class.\n\nOne tidbit about Maiden's sound on Piece of Mind is that the band does not recall their punk rock influences from the Di'Anno albums or even their NWOBHM influences from the previous release. On Number of the Beast, the band was still a fledgling outfit, finding their own sound and style - lyrically and musically. Well, none of that amateurishness was present here; the band had polished up their sound a lot, going for a more streamlined, almost arena-rock style that would gain them much fame in the coming years. No other band in the world was doing what Maiden was doing, pumping out heavy metal classics year after year, never growing weaker or stale (not in the 80s anyhow). This was the beginning of Maiden's sound as modern fans know it.\n\nTracks like the best song on the album, \"Where Eagles Dare\", the jumpy, catchy \"Flight of Icarus\", the heavy, kinetic \"Die With Your Boots On\", and the mandatory Maiden concert classic \"The Trooper\" overflow with youthful energy, the sound of this young band in their prime. They may be near-progressive, dark, and introspective nowadays, but this is Iron Maiden's heart and soul---jumpy, classic heavy metal riffs and bass lines, powerful drumming, and the melodic howls of the legendary Bruce Dickinson. This is the sound of a band having a fucking good time. \"Revelations\" and \"Still Life\" are darker and more thought provoking tracks, with the former being based around a Bible passage, and the second being a somber ghost story. Iron Maiden does this very well actually, not disappointing at all. Iron Maiden always did well with things like this; as seen in past classics like \"Number of the Beast\" and \"Phantom of the Opera\", and these two continue that tradition.\n\nThere are a few filler tracks here, namely \"Quest For Fire\" and \"Sun and Steel.\" These are good songs, and full of vigor and an overall lighthearted atmosphere, but they don't measure up to the other songs of the album. Every Maiden album is like that, with a few great songs and a few fillers, and this is no exception. And we finally come to our token Iron Maiden epic, \"To Tame a Land\", which is based off Frank Herbert's Dune series. It's a good song, and has some Middle Eastern melodies packed in, but it's not as good as \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\", \"Phantom of the Opera\", or \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\" off the other Golden Age Maiden albums. It does hold a special place in my heart though, being one of the first Maiden songs I heard in my first days as a metalhead.\n\nThe lyrics here are great, too, with themes revolving around old war films (\"Where Eagles Dare\"), religion (\"Revelations\"), war itself (\"The Trooper\"), Greek myths (\"Flight of Icarus\"), and even a prophecy by Nostradamus (\"Die With Your Boots On\"), Japanese samurai (\"Sun and Steel\") and science fiction literature (\"To Tame a Land\"). I can't blame Iron Maiden for having a bit of fun, but \"Quest for Fire\" is lyrically ridiculous, and historically off balance. But what else does one expect from an 80s NWOBHM band? The lyrics are one of the strongest points of Piece of Mind, though, as every song here is about something completely different, transporting you to new worlds and different times with each song. This is an adventurer's album; the musical tool of the armchair voyager, and it has a staying power due to this that many albums couldn't even dream of possessing.\n\nIf you haven't heard this one, you're missing out on a classic piece of metal history, so go out and get it right now, be you damned otherwise. Up the irons!\n",
        "\nIron Maiden. How much can a person say about Iron Maiden that every other respectable metal head doesn\u2019t already know? And if you are a metal head and you haven\u2019t listened to A Matter of Life and Death then maybe you should \u2013 right now. Because this is one of the best albums of the year, even if it doesn\u2019t sound like the Iron Maiden many of use grew up listening to.\n\nA Matter of Life and Death is down-right progressive in nature, including songs with length and multiple time and rhythm changes. The album is epic but not forcibly epic as was the case with most of Dance of Death. The songs are written in that progressive/epic manner and are likely played as such. For fans of the older Iron Maiden style (fast melodies and shorter songs) then this album may not sit well with you. As a fan of the older Iron Maiden I know at first this album didn\u2019t digest well in my head. But as a fan of Iron Maiden I know that this is how they are now and not much is going to change that.\n\nWhen a person first throws in the album, they are going to hear the first track, \u201cDifferent World\u201d, which is definitely the most radio friendly and older styled song on the album. This is also by far my favorite track because it is a little speedier and upbeat. The rest of the album is a lot slower (about mid-paced) and full of soaring melodies and galloping beats. The guitar work (despite having three full time guitarists now) is simplified on this album and the melodies are a focusing element on the entire song, rather than being the main part. I don\u2019t really understand why when a band has three extremely talents guitarists they don\u2019t use them to their full potential \u2013 but it doesn\u2019t detract from the music at all. \n\nThe bass work (oh \u2013 how Steve Harris is a badass) is once again his stylized galloping riffs which help keep the songs from slowing too much. His bass is a little loud in comparison to the guitars but Iron Maiden has always had a very forward bass sound so it doesn\u2019t bother me that much. The drumming is simplistic but very effective in creating a structure for the progressive stylings in the music. The drums are unique in the writing with lots of great cymbal work. \n\nBruce Dickinson is at the top of his game on A Matter of Life and Death. The longer and more epic songs allow him to really throw his operatic vocal style out and give it his entire heart. His solo career seems to be the place for the shorter faster songs anymore \u2013 and this really shows what a great big voice he has. \n\nThe album itself is seamless in its presentation. Songs flow very well and even though it has a more progressive feel to it \u2013 there are none of those sudden time changes that sometimes discourage me from listening. Most of the time changes are gradual and the listener can follow at ease. The lyrics of the album help to give it an overall epic feeling with songs about understanding, World War II (I love the historical aspects of Iron Maiden), and even the sacrifices one makes in the name of God. One of the most interesting lyrical albums released in the last few years it\u2019s nice to hear a song that supports the idea of dying for ones country for honor (in the context of World War II, I would assume). \n\nOverall, A Matter of Life and Death is a massive achievement for Iron Maiden. It may not be a Powerslave in its conception but its delivery as a progressive metal album is superb. Fans of the faster and to-the-point Iron Maiden probably won\u2019t love this as much but in the end this is by far one of the most brilliantly made albums I\u2019ve heard. \n\nSongs to check out: Different World, Brighter than a Thousand Suns, For the Greater Good of God, The Longest Day.\n",
        "\nAfter the departure of the often criticized Blaze Bailey, British metal band Iron Maiden shocked the world when they announced that both Bruce Dickinson and Adrian Smith would be returning to the band. However, the band promised that Adrian Smith's replacement from the 1990, Janick Gers, would not leave the fold. For the first time, Iron Maiden would become a sextet, which opened new songwriting possibilities for the band. Iron Maiden immediately set out on the Ed Hunter tour to support their new compilation album and computer game. \n\nAfter the three month tour, one which they were supported by once huge thrash band Megadeth, Iron Maiden went into writing mode for their highly anticipated reunion album Brave New World. The album was released to on May 30, 2000. Even though both Bruce and Adrian were absent for the greater part of the past decade, they both participated in the writing process, and in the end, both Adrian and Bruce had multiple writing credits on their names.\n\nWith Adrian Smith and Bruce Dickinson returning, Iron Maiden released what was possibly their best album since 1988's Seventh Son of Seventh Son. Brave New World continues the trends set forth by The X Factor and Virtual XI. With longer songs such as Dream of Mirrors, The Nomad, and The Thin Line Between Love And Hate, Iron Maiden shows off some of their Blaze era influences. However, the band also crafted shorter songs, more reminiscent to 80's era Maiden in tracks such as The Wicker Man, The Mercenary, and The Fallen Angel. Anybody who enjoyed Iron Maiden albums, whether from the 80's or 90's should be able to find something they like in Brave New World.\n\nBrave New World sounds like what you would expect an Iron Maiden album to sound like. Great harmonies and melodic riffs can be found all over the album, as they always have, and unless Steve Harris loses it, always will. Bruce sounds like he never left the band, only it's 1988 and not 1992. As with his solo material, Dickinson ditched his painfully bad raspy vocal style and returned to the operatic vocal style found on earlier Maiden records. Several songs such as Ghost of the Navigator, Brave New World, and Blood Brothers start off quiet, much like many of the songs found on The X Factor. The album's nine and a half minute epic, Dream of Mirrors, also contains several softer moments. The slower paced, soft intros help set an epic atmosphere before the band kicks the song into overdrive. The tracks that are void of the long, clean sections make up for it with pure energy. Iron Maiden still manage to play like they're 25 instead of 45 on this release. Rockers such as The Mercenary, The Fallen Angel, and The Wicker Man get the adrenaline flowing just as well as any 80's era Maiden track. Perhaps Brave New World's best song is the other nine minute track, The Nomad. Seemingly inspired by past greats such as Powerslave and To Tame a Land, The Nomad combines the best of Brave New World's characteristics; excellent riffs, relaxing mellow sections, and exciting solos into what one day might be regarded as a classic Iron Maiden epic.\n\nDespite looking old and tired in the album's linear notes, the band's fire has seemingly been re-lit on this album. After a great, though at times dull Virtual XI, an album that sounds uninspired, the mood of Brave New World gives off is that of a motivated Iron Maiden. An Iron Maiden that hasn't been seen since the days of Powerslave, Somewhere in Time, and Seventh Son of a Seventh Son. Brave New World is definitely the easiest album to get into since the band's glory days. The album is also the most enjoyable to listen to. Unlike in the albums of the 90's, there isn't a moment that feels forced. Whether this is due to new producer Kevin Shirley, the return of Bruce and Adrian, or just a more focused effort, Iron Maiden does an excellent job living up to the hype that built up before the album's release.\n\nBrave New World was Iron Maiden's 12th studio album. To date it is one of the band's top albums; along side the likes of Powerslave, Somewhere in Time, and A Matter of Life and Death. The reunited band does an excellent job combining the elements of their earlier albums into nearly 70 minutes of music. If anyone still does not own the album, they should definitely pick it up when they get the chance.\n",
        "\nAfter 1992's Fear of the Dark, an album that, for the last time for another eleven years, hit #2 in the UK, Iron Maiden vocalist Bruce Dickinson left the band he fronted for 11 years. Iron Maiden than began auditioning for new vocalists, both known and unknown. After listening to dozens of tryouts, the band finally selected Wolfsbane singer, Blaze Bailey. I find the changing of vocalists very welcoming, as I am not a fan of the raspy style of singing Bruce used on the previous to albums.\n\nWith Blaze, a new era began for the band. It was on the band's first Blaze Bailey album that they began writing what ended up being the precursor to their current day songs. The X Factor, the band's tenth release, featured songs unlike ever heard before on a Maiden record. These songs featured slow, quieter intros courtesy of Steve Harris bass lines, often with Blaze softly singing the first verse over them. The song then becomes heavier and faster resembling the traditional Iron Maiden sound, before the song fades out just as it began. Of course, The X Factor also features short, speedy songs such as Man on the Edge. \n\nThe brooding and melancholic music found on this album fits both Blaze's voice and the dark atmospheric lyrics that were written. Song subjects range from the inquisition in Sign of the Cross; to war in songs such as Fortunes of War, The Aftermath, and Blood on the Worlds Hands; to insanity in Man on the Edge, and The Edge of Darkness; as well as many other introspective subjects. Primary songwriter Steve Harris (who wrote or co-wrote 10 out of 11 songs) must have been going through a rough time during the writing of The X-Factor as the lyrics are darker and more negative than they have been on any release prior to The X Factor and since it was released. \n\nAn important part of the album is the often criticized Blaze Bailey himself. With his lower vocal range, he may not have been able too sing the old Iron Maiden classics as well as Bruce, his voice was perfect for the new release. His singing fits the melancholic feelings of The X Factor, and he sings with the needed emotion throughout the album. Blaze enhances the album's mood and atmosphere with his lower vocal register, bringing the depressing feelings of the songs to life. The band made an excellent choice picking their new frontman, given the direction the wanted to take. Blaze doesn't disappoint [me] and was very fun to listen to, especially on Sign of the Cross, where he sings \"They'll be saying their prayers when the moment comes/There'll be penance to pay when it's Judgment Day\" or his performance on The Edge of Darkness, one of the band's best songs from the Blaze era.\n\nDespite the more metallic feel slightly disappearing, guitarists Dave Murray and Janick Gers are still excellent in The X Factor. While I don't like the production on their guitars at all, they work with what they have and churn out some impressive riffs. Catchy, melodic riffs (especially when combined with Blaze's singing) make up for the lack of heaviness. Murray and Gers solo at the right times, adding speed and power to songs. Dave and Janick are best on the opening, 11 minute epic Sign of the Cross, where they spearhead the long instrumental that makes up almost half of the song.\n\nThe X Factor was a change for Iron Maiden, and a very important one at that. At over 70 minutes, this album paved the way for future albums of similar length, like Brave New World, Dance of Death, and A Matter of Life and Death. To this very day, the album remains one of the more unpopular Iron Maiden albums, along with Virtual XI. The X Factor is the kind album you either really love or really hate, as it doesn't feature the band's traditional sound. If I could recommend one album to get samples from before purchasing, it would be The X Factor, as it seems to have a mixed bag of supporters and haters. Personally, I really enjoyed The X Factor, its introspective lyrics, and Blaze's singing. That said, I would prefer the band refraining from recording an album similar to this one.\n\n(Originally written for Sputnikmusic)\n",
        "\nIron Maiden has been around for a long time, a very long time. They were formed on Christmas Day in 1975, went through dozens of lineup changes until they settled on their most stable lineup 8 years later. Most bands are not even around for that amount of time, but somehow, the UK metallers survived their growing pains and made it as one of the most successful heavy metal bands of all time. It's currently September of 2006, and just a few short/long (take your pick) weeks ago the band released their 14th album, A Matter of Life and Death. After listening to it constantly the last couple weeks, I decided to look back on Maiden's previous efforts, of course starting with 2003's Dance of Death. \n\nLike the new Maiden album, Dance of Death seems to be one of those albums that will receive plenty of praise and at the same time, plenty of criticism among fans. As with both Brave New World and A Matter of Life and Death, this album contains longer tracks with plenty of soft intros, winding interludes, and time changes that can change on a dime. Though Steve and Co. haven\u2019t completely mastered this new take on song writing, through songs like Paschendale, Dance of Death, and Face in the Sand, Iron Maiden shows that not even Father Time can slow them down, or at least, not yet. \n\nDance of Death features a few surprises, a few new elements that have not been present on any of their other albums. First off, Maiden drummer Nicko McBrain's first ever writing credit comes on the album. The song, titled No Frontier, is surprisingly better than one would think, though certainly not a classic Iron Maiden track. No Frontier starts off weakly, but eventually round out to be a pretty enjoyable track. Notable is both the very catchy chorus, and the two energetic solos from Smith and Murray. The other surprise is the closing track, simply titled Journeyman. Never before has an all acoustic song been found on an Iron Maiden album, and the band decided to change that here. Journeyman is an impressive mid-paced 7 minute outer with excellent lyrics. The song is very epic sounding, especially the long build up in the middle of the song, with an emotional feeling to it that is only matched by the likes of Paschendale. Though the song contains no solo, it is among my favourite songs off Dance of Death and certainly one of the best.\n\nInterestingly, the Dance of Death album contains not only Iron Maiden's best song, Paschendale, but it also contains one of their worst, a track titled Gates of Tomorrow. With its boring, uninspired riffs, annoying rhythm, and bad lyrics, Gates of Tomorrow is a very forgettable track and does not represent the attitude of Dance of Death very well at all. On the other hand, Paschendale gives listeners a real taste of what the album tried to accomplish. With its heavy riffs, operatic vocals, melodic instrumentals, emotional lyrics and atmosphere, Paschendale is quite easily the ultimate Maiden masterpiece. Along with the likes of Hallowed Be Thy Name, Powerslave, and Rime of the Ancient Mariner, Paschendale has Maiden achieving their full potential in a track that best exemplifies the theatric moments the band was shooting for on the Dance of Death album. \n\nThough the album contains many long epics of at least 6 minutes, Iron Maiden does not forget their past. No, there are a couple tracks that pay homage to their past efforts. The likes of Montsegur and Rainmaker remind fans of the highly energetic 80's sound that had become such a hit among metal fans. Montsegur in particular could easily fit on the Piece of Mind album and not look out of place. Wildest Dreams and New Frontier are also shorter songs similar in structure to the previously mentioned tracks, and contain many of the same high energy characteristics. \n\nWith Dance of Death, Iron Maiden sought to continue their musical growth, taking the long prog rock influenced sound found on their reunion album Brave New World, and adding a new epic, theatrical twist to it. With cuts such as the title track and Paschendale, they certainly succeed, producing an album that although long, is very interesting to listen to. Don't let the terrible art work deter you from purchasing this album, as it deserves a spot in your CD collection.\n\n(Originally written for Sputnikmusic)\n",
        "\nIron Maiden definitely know how to make your entertainment dollar go further. A three-disc set for only $20? Hell yes! Of course, two of the discs are just different audio configurations of the same exact concert, but hey, it feels like you're getting more for your dollar.\n\nNow we get to the actual concert. The setlist is about as much as you can ask for from a recent Maiden setlist, as they still play most of the classics they dropped for their recent A Matter of Life and Death tour. The performances are all stellar, especially Bruce's vocals (which have seemingly deteriorated in the last three years) and the acoustic parts played on Dance of Death and Journeyman. Paschendale is a highlight for the utter theatrics of it: shells flying, barbed wire, dead bodies, Bruce in a military uniform. That's what I'm talking about. Everything about the show is amazing, and every band member is firing on all cylinders. No complaints there.\n\nHowever, the editing for the show, done by none other than Steve Harris, is an abomination. It \"cuts to the heart of the action\", as advertised, but in doing so it makes your eyeballs rattle around in your skull trying to keep up with the constant changes in camera view. The light show probably wouldn't be distracting if you were actually at the venue, but the editing makes it look like it's goal is to induce seizures. And believe you me, it does. The disc begins with a warning for people suffering from certain forms of epilepsy, and I suggest that you heed this warning. It isn't enough to make the sheer power of a Maiden show weakened, because this is still a fantastic DVD, but goddamn. Keep 'Arry away from the controls.\n\nAs for the bonus features, they're entertaining, but they're standard run-of-the-mill Maiden bonus features. An hour of Maiden discussing the making of Dance of Death and the tour in which Nicko has some great punchlines, forty minutes of fans talking about how they got into Maiden and whatnot, which may evoke some nostalgia, and a Life on the Road documentary which is pretty basic but also has funny parts. You also get the atrocious \"Wildest Dreams\" music video and the pretty-damn-good-for-Maiden \"Rainmaker\" video. \n\nThis is definitely worth the $20, but don't come crying to me when you're forced to check into intensive care for your seizures.\n",
        "\nThis album is the slightly older and uglier twin sister of \u201cA Real Live One\u201d, which was a fairly decent live album, thought the vocals were a bit rough at times and \u201cWasted Years\u201d wasn\u2019t on the set. As everyone is sure to remember, 1993-1994 is a period that lives in infamy, for it was when Bruce Dickinson left the band high and dry (though technically Maiden had lost its edge since Adrian Smith quit) and the entire Maiden sound was thrown for a loop. Part of the foreshadowing of these events can be readily observed in the poor performance and lack of sound quality on this release, which consists of only pre-1986 Maiden.\n\nThe obvious problem here is Bruce\u2019s utterly terrible renditions of the Paul Di\u2019anno material. One thing that I am thankful for is that Bruce has spared us his god awful rendition of Wrathchild and all of my other favorite songs off the revolutionary \u201cKillers\u201d LP; however he has taken the occasional to butcher nearly every song off the debut album. The least offensive of the bunch include \u201cSanctuary\u201d where he is not required to go very high and thus can spare us his overtly dirty and sloppy high notes (he used to hit them flawlessly) and \u201cTransylvania\u201d where he doesn\u2019t sing at all. \u201cRunning Free\u201d is sung very sloppily and has too many damned ad lib parts (sing the damned song the right way Bruce\u201d and the self-titled song is almost as sloppy. \u201cProwler\u201d is out of tune and \u201cRemember Tomorrow\u201d has some of the most god awful attempts at a Di\u2019anno scream I\u2019ve ever heard.\n\nBruce\u2019s strength as a singer was always when doing that quasi-operatic tenor voice that he helped pioneer, he is definitely not capable of pulling off a Rob Halford, I don\u2019t care how hard he tries. As such, his better performances are on songs where this doesn\u2019t occur, which is primarily the \u201cPiece of Mind\u201d material. The two highlights of this concert are \u201cWhere Eagles Dare\u201d and \u201cThe Trooper\u201d, although \u201cHallowed be thy name\u201d is also pulled of decently. \n\nAnother aspect of this CD where things fall flat is Janick Gers\u2019 guitar playing, which is all over the damned place. His solos are highly unorganized and downright sloppy. I can picture him spending the better part of them doing far too many behind the back tosses and show boating through gesticulation instead of concentrating on playing the right damned notes the way Dave Murray usually does. The intro riff on \u201c2 minutes to midnight\u201d is done wrong, as one of the two notes in the 4th interval pattern (the same kind of chords used in Man on the Silver Mountain) is actually played, resulting in a very empty sound. You\u2019ll take note that he does this the whole time, even as Dave Murray comes in playing it properly, indicating that this was probably intentional, though this doesn\u2019t make it sound any better.\n\nBut even worse than the severely poor performances by 2 of the 5 members is the damned set list they\u2019ve concocted. How many times do we have to hear stuff from the debut and \u201cNumber of the Beast\u201d? We\u2019ve got great songs off of Piece of Mind and Powerslave such as \u201cFlight of Icarus\u201d, \u201cDie with your boots on\u201d, \u201cAces High\u201d and \u201cPowerslave\u201d which are short enough to work well live yet are not to be found here. I\u2019m tired of hearing stuff off \u201cNumber of the Beast\u201d live all the time, and as good as the stuff from the debut is, it\u2019s also way overplayed.\n\nTo rabid fans and Iron Maiden collectors who want to own everything they\u2019ve put out (I\u2019m one of you), look for this in the bargain bin or try to track down the 2 CD reissue at a discount price, this isn\u2019t worth blowing $18 on. For those who wish only to purchase quality Maiden live stuff and liked the set lists they had during this era, the VHS of \u201cRaising Hell\u201d features better renditions of Maiden classics (save Wrathchild which of course Bruce completely butchers). But for true quality live material, check out Rock in Rio, that\u2019s where the band definitely recaptured the spirit of what is found in the studio releases.\n",
        "\nI was excited when I came home and saw Edward the Great lying on my desk as a present from my brother. Then I flipped the CD case over and looked at the track listing. What the flying fuck? \n\nThe most obvious flaw with this piece of trash is the tracklisting. Does the idea of a Maiden compilation without any Di'Anno material, missing Hallowed Be Thy Name, missing Aces High, missing Stranger in a Strange Land, and missing Be Quick or Be Dead sound like a good idea to you? It must have to Steve...or maybe to Steve's wallet.\n\nAs well, there is also some crap included here. Can I Play With Madness, Bring Your Daughter to the Slaughter, and the live rendition of Fear of the Dark (Worst. Lyric. Ever.) are unbearably cheesy. The Blaze material (Futureal and Man on the Edge), and Blaze's voice in particular, comes off as weak compared to Bruce's soaring wail and dramatic touches. The Clairvoyant, Infinite Dreams, and Holy Smoke were absolutely unnecessary.\n\nExcuse me, Steve, but we wanted the BEST of Iron Maiden. If you're not going to release a compilation that isn't half-assed, don't release one at all.\n",
        "\nIron Maiden\u2019s live CD releases in 1993 featured an incredible amount of lackluster vocal performances by Bruce Dickinson, particularly on older material. This album\u2019s sister release \u201cA Real Dead One\u201d was mired by an complete inability of Bruce to hit much of the higher notes found on the pre-Somewhere in Time material he was on with any strength, not to mention some butchered guitar parts by Janick Gers. This was mostly due to a shift in Bruce Dickinson\u2019s vocal style, which resulted in a rather lousy release in \u201cNo Prayer for the Dying\u201d.\n\nBut much as the new vocal style hurt the performance on the older material, it has worked well for the performance of newer material, particularly the Somewhere in Time and Seventh Son material. This tour contains my favorite live rendition of both \u201cHeaven can wait\u201d and \u201cThe Evil that Men do\u201d, where Bruce uses his dirtier vocal style to inject these songs with some much needed attitude. Likewise, Gers proves to be a bit more apt at playing the later lead material and riffs that Adrian Smith offered up before his exodus from the band.\n\nThe other thing that helps this album along is an extremely low number of \u201cNo Prayer for the Dying\u201d songs on the set list. \u201cTailgunner\u201d has the edge in terms of musicality as it is more cut from the middle of the road rock tunes that Steve Harris occasionally puts together, while \u201cBring you Daughter to the Slaughter\u201d is pretty much a AC/DC rip off that listens okay but doesn\u2019t really accomplish much other than give us some creepy horror inspired lyrics.\n\nThe Fear of the Dark material is mostly on point, and once again Maiden has done well to avoid playing any of the crappy songs from that album live. The title track and \u201cBe quick or be dead\u201d are the performed the best, although I wish that the audience would learn to sing along with the chorus to the former in time with the song. Unfortunately both \u201cAfraid to Shoot Strangers\u201d and \u201cWasting Love\u201d are not very strong. They just don\u2019t recapture the atmosphere of the studio versions at all, as well as the fact that Harris\u2019 bass work sounds a bit muddy.\n\nThis album is mostly recommended to people who liked the later 80s and early 90s material. The live versions of the stuff that Adrian Smith was originally present on is much better than what was on \u201cA Real Dead One\u201d. Those of you, who like Maiden better with Adrian Smith in the fold or who liked the pre-Somewhere in Time stuff the best, either avoid this or look for it at a reduced price. If you can only find the double CD release, don\u2019t both buying it, the renditions of the older material is pretty bad.\n",
        "\nOne of the things that I don\u2019t like about the constant barrage of new editions of Maiden material is that they are essentially devaluing older singles such as this one. This of course is in addition to the fact that the latest reissue of \u201cKillers\u201d that I\u2019ve encountered has this song as a bonus track, which ruins the flow of what I believe to be the first true heavy metal concept album. It\u2019s not in any way related lyrically to the story implied in the progression of songs; stop fucking around with history you mindless pencil pushers!!\n\nAnyhow, the song featured on this single is short but quite memorable, containing one of the best vocal performances in studio of Paul Di\u2019anno before his voice got all screwed up. The intro riff is a slower version of the low end minimalist riffs that would be found on several early thrash albums, and the general tempo of the song is quite fast when you consider the time it was recorded in. Likewise we find the most well known song off the Killers LP here to round out the fold in \u201cWrath Child\u201d, a song that has been butchered vocally on a consistent basis since Di\u2019anno left the band.\n\nThis is for the consumption of rabid Maiden fan boys with a fetish for rare collectables. Those who don\u2019t have a similarly rabid appreciation for the history of this band are advised to seek out both these songs on the heretical re-issue that has surfaced here in the states in recent years. I own it, I\u2019m proud of owning it, and it\u2019ll be a cold day in hell before I ever part with it.\n",
        "\nIron Maiden is not only one of the best metal bands ever spawned, but one of the best live bands by far as well. Unfortunately, one of their best performances caught on tape contained here in Maiden Japan was really only widely available in EP form with only 5 tracks from the show seeing the light of day for years. However, if you were lucky enough to be a member of the fan club and take advantage of the offer, you get the whole show remastered in it's original form.\n\nIron Maiden, as usual, sound awesome here just thundering along with a great audience response. Di'Anno is in top form here, showing off his voice quite nicely (what a great range, so much better than Bruce), with Adrian, Dave, and Steve tearing up their fret-boards while Clive rips apart his kit. What is also great here is the production is very crisp and clear, along with being remastered makes it sound like your right there watching them. They play the majority of their first two albums here, only excluding \"Prodigal Son\" and \"The Ides Of March\" intro from \"Killers\", as well as \"Prowler\" and \"Charlotte The Harlot\" from \"Iron Maiden\". As some nicely added bonuses here which compensate for the loss of those however, the listener is treated to a cover of the Ronnie Montrose song \"I've Got The Fire\", a drum solo at the end of \"Another Life\", and an extended guitar solo in \"Transylvania\".\n\nReally every song is a highlight here, it's an excellent track selection for a show all of them are classic songs, and as all the studio versions have been described countless times, I won't waste time by talking about all of them, just certain parts of the show. Maiden gets off to a ripping start with \"Wrathchild\" which is always a highlight of their show, and they play it great here. Another really nice arrangement here is when they play \"Genghis Khan\", \"Killers\", and \"Innocent Exile\" all in a row, their such great songs and sound excellent on this release. Another highlight of song arrangement is \"Murders In The Rue Mourgue\", \"Phantom Of The Opera\", and \"Iron Maiden\" being played in a row. The encore they do is arranged very well with \"Running Free\", \"Transylvania\", \"Drifter\", and then their ass ripping version of \"I've Got The Fire\".\n\nIn conclusion, this is one of the best live recordings I've ever heard, and I strongly suggest getting it if you can find it. This is only one of a handful that actually deserves a 100 rating. It will not dissapoint!\n",
        "\nUnfortunately, the Di'Anno era of Maiden is often disregarded by many fans world wide, which is hard to understand, as the band was churning out some great classic songs with alot of raw power and energy at the time. All in all, these albums sound heavier then alot of their other releases with Dickinson.\n\nKillers, Iron Maiden's second offering rips into you and doesn't let up until the end. It seems to start off a little slow with the intro \"The Ides Of March\" which gives the album a nice atmosphere to start off with, despite it being a very short instrumental. From there, without a pause, it rolls directly into \"Wrathchild\" which is a great rocker with some great riffs and hooks. Next up is \"Murders In The Rue Morgue\" which starts off slow, but soon picks up to breakneck speed which has the ferocity to rip your fucking face off. \"Another Life\" comes up next which has some great guitar parts and instrumentally sounds excellent, the only complaint at all about this song and about the album for that matter is that the lyrics here aren't very inventive, just the same few lines repeated over and over again. \"Genghis Khan\" is an excellent instrumental played at top speed in the vein of \"Transylvania\" from their first release which gives way to the bass driven classic \"Innocent Exile\" which is one of the best songs I've ever heard from Maiden and then the excellent title track which features one of the best vocal performances Paul Di'Anno's ever given along with some great harmonic lines from both Adrian and Dave, Steve ripping up his bass like a madman and Clive giving an all out assault on his drums. The remaining four songs rock along nicely with that classic sound and intensity only Iron Maiden could muster. with the exception of \"Prodigal Son\" which is just as good, but more along the lines of a slower ballad like song. The album closes ferociously just as it opened with the classic \"Drifter\" which has some excellent hooks, riffs, and a great shout along chorus.\n\nEssentially. this is a flawless classic Iron Maiden album with the whole band in top form and giving one of the best performances of their lives. Di'Anno's vocals especially stand out here.\n",
        "\nOne of Maiden\u2019s more widely panned albums, No Prayer for the Dying presented a stylistic alteration that tested the loyalty of their fan base. The atmospheric and synthesized elements of the previous two albums were gone and the songwriting had returned to a simpler form, often compared to the sound of the band\u2019s early work with Paul Di\u2019anno. Surely Iron Maiden didn\u2019t need a slew of complex, progressive arrangements to write killer songs, did they? Unfortunately, the answer appears to be yes. While the resulting album isn\u2019t nearly as bad as it is notorious for, it\u2019s certainly Iron Maiden at their least ambitious and NPftD is one of their weakest albums overall.\n\nThe songwriting is definitely simpler than it has ever been. Only one song breaks the five minute mark (Mother Russia), the song structures tend to adhere to a generic verse-chorus formula, and the focus is on catchiness of riffs and vocal melodies rather than on atmosphere or lyrical content. Everything sounds much less like heavy metal and much more like 80\u2019s hard rock, making the album sound quite similar to Bruce Dickinson\u2019s early solo work than any Maiden release (perhaps due to Janick Gers, a far inferior player and writer to Adrian Smith). Even so, there are some good songs here, which is the reason my rating is so generous. There are some solid rockers on here, such as \u201cTailgunner\u201d and \u201cHoly Smoke,\u201d that while adding nothing particularly new, still carry with them an admirable sense of fun. This is not an album to really take seriously lyrically, as much of it is either typical of hard rock or just somewhat lighthearted. This is true especially when compared to the last few Maiden albums. The songs that absolutely make this release are \u201cHooks in You\u201d and the title track. The former is pretty much the catchiest song the band has ever released to date (and a personal favorite among their more straightforward tracks) while the latter is a very mellow half-ballad, mixing expressive clean tones with heavier riffing towards the end. The rest of the songs range from mediocre subject attempts to poor filler and are otherwise forgettable.\n\nOne of the reasons the songwriting here suffers is the band\u2019s playing, not just their arranging or writing. Bruce\u2019s voice is a lot raspier and generally sucks through much of the album. This is also the only Maiden album where the lead work actually fails to impress me. Not a single solo stands out here, with many of them sounding sloppy and rushed and others are out of place entirely. Steve Harris actually sounds pretty good here. His bass lines come through nicely without overpowering and they\u2019re usually well thought out. Unfortunately, no one else seems to make the effort, leaving the album feeling weak and incomplete.\n\nDespite all these problems, the few good songs and some otherwise nice riffing makes this worthwhile at the end of the day. But fans of Iron Maiden be warned: this may not earn the same respect of you. With the good songs come the bad and it\u2019s still the weakest Iron Maiden with Bruce Dickinson as vocalist (the Bailey ones are worse). I still recommend giving it a shot, but I can\u2019t promise much.\n",
        "\nI know what you're thinking - at only three tracks and clocking in at a mere eleven and a half minutes, how can this demo possibly deserve such a high rating?\n\nWell, quite aside from anything else, this is an historically important demo, being Iron Maiden's first release and, as such, marking the birth of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal. Compared to what other British bands of the day were peddling as metal (Sabbath's abysmal 'Never Say Die' or Rainbow's 'Down to Earth', for instance), it was a breath of fresh air to a genre that was in danger of becoming sterile.\n\nIt also marked Iron Maiden as THE band to watch in the British metal scene and with good reason, as their storied career has proven.\n\nLet's not forget that the three songs on this demo - 'Iron Maiden', 'Invasion' and 'Prowler' are all bona fide classics in their own right and, whilst any Maiden fan will have heard them in many different guises over the last 25+ years, they have rarely sounded as raw or as full of energy as they do here.\n\nTo the best of my knowledge, this is only release to showcase Iron Maiden as a quartet. Bereft of their second guitar and with Paul Di'Anno's rough-hewn vocals on display, this is as streamlined and concise a version of the songs as you are ever likely to hear. Gutteral, angry and with a definite punk influence - which, surprisingly, is a good thing - 'The Soundhouse Tapes' is a perfect demonstration of what made Maiden such a force to be reckoned with.\n\nHistorical, a rarity and, more than that, a slice of molten metal magic.\n\nUp the Irons!\n",
        "\nFear of the Dark might just be the least consistent Maiden album to date, with a broad spectrum of song types that maintain the stylistic departure that began with No Prayer for the Dying. And yet, I find most of the songs on here catchy enough to deem it forgivable as an album. Yes, this is quite mediocre for a Maiden release, but it has enough great moments to prove that even Maiden's mediocrity is quite listenable.\n\nOne of my biggest complaints with this is that the band is pushing no boundaries. The instrumentation on this album leaves you to believe they were more focused on releasing this album than writing it, leaving a lot to be desired in the songwriting department. I'd love to put some of the blame on Janick Gers, whose playing is mediocre and his writing much less than that, but this album's weaknesses are not entirely his fault (though a lot of the riffing is reminiscent of Gers' playing on Dickinson's first solo album, aka shit). The drumming and bass are pretty standard, many of the riffs are uninspired, and Bruce sounds like half the vocalist he was on Seventh Son. Iron Maiden didn't even attempt to make this outstanding.\n\nAnd yet, every song on here manages to spark my interest, if only for a moment. \"Fear is the Key\" and \"The Apparition\" are meandering, but make up for it in atmosphere and melody. Straight-forward rockers like \"Be Quick or Be Dead,\" \"Chains of Misery,\" and \"From Here to Eternity\" have just enough energy and natural catchiness to be considered solid songs. And of course, \"Fear of the Dark\" is an atmospheric masterpiece, with great lyrics aplenty and a powerful sense of mood. I really can't find enough fault in any song to say that I don't like it, even if some of them are really begging for disapproval.\n\nSo I consider this a good metal/hard rock release, although not necessarily a good Maiden release. Fear of the Dark is definitely the underachiever in the band's catalogue, but it performs just well enough to make the grade.\n",
        "\nDeath on the Road was recorded to capture the greatness of the Dance of Death tour and it does that very well. Some argue that this release was unnecessary because of Rock in Rio, recorded only about 4 or 5 years earlier; that it was just a rehash of most of the same songs. My stance is that while there are many repeat songs here that could have been replaced with lesser-heard ones, the quality of the Dance of Death tracks make up for it. \n\nFirst off: the production. It\u2019s quite well done, especially considering all the elements going in: soaring vocals, a triple-guitar attack, an extensive drum-set, a thundering bass, and even a synth and backing vox added on top of that. However, there are little quirks about it that bother me a bit. For example, at times Nicko\u2019s ride becomes exceptionally loud and can hurt the ears a bit when it happens. It\u2019s only for a few seconds and probably not on many songs, but it is a little bit of a problem, despite the overall percussion sound being outstanding (probably better than Rock in Rio.) The guitars are generally of good quality but Adrian seems to suffer a bit, his guitars fairly low in the mix most of the time, while Murray is placed way up high. Janick is\u2026well, who really cares? Just kidding, but I swear that guy isn\u2019t playing half the fuckin\u2019 time. The vocals are put in the mix well for my tastes, but if you\u2019re expecting a complete domination of volume from them, then think again. \n\nNow that that\u2019s covered, I\u2019ll go over the quality of the tracklist. Basically, in my opinion, the new songs are the gems here and the classics sort of suffer. By no means are they bad or performed poorly, but if you\u2019ve ever heard Maiden live before, you\u2019ve heard these. I\u2019m talking about Wrathchild, Run to the Hills, The Trooper, Hallowed Be Thy Name, Iron Maiden, and Fear of the Dark. All of these songs were performed at Rock in Rio at top-notch quality and I feel that, despite at least 2 or so of those being essential, many of them could have been spared for a few rarer tracks that haven\u2019t been played much. Brave New World (featured on Rock in Rio) and Can I Play With Madness (featured on Maiden England and the 90\u2019s live albums) are also featured, adding to the repeat songs.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s clear that what this album was really made for was to show off the epic Dance of Death songs. All of them stand out and really make this purchase worth it, unless of course you didn\u2019t happen to enjoy those songs, in which case I would recommend you get Rock in Rio or Live After Death instead.\n\nThe band\u2019s performance is\u2026well, as far as the older tracks go, I think they were performed better at Rio. Mostly it\u2019s Bruce\u2019s vocals that are the problem. They\u2019re starting to show their age, but that\u2019s not to say that his performance isn\u2019t brilliant. He shows real passion on almost all the songs and nails difficult passages from the new album, but there are faults like the peak notes in the chorus of Rainmaker, or the \u201cloooowwww\u201d on Hallowed that could turn some off from this album. Other than that, everything is great, especially the solos.\n\nIn summary, Death on the Road is NOT the first live album you should pick up from Maiden. My recommendation personally would be to pick up Rock in Rio and Live After Death before this. And if you are looking for a studio album, Dance of Death is a great album and it would be a good choice to pick up that before getting this. I also have to point out that WATCHING Maiden play really is that much more exciting than just listening, so any dvd you can get your hands on is worth it. Just keep in mind that this live recording is not for n00bies or casual fans, but rather for semi-hardcore to hardcore fans that can\u2019t get enough Maiden (me.) \n\nStandout tracks: All Dance of Death songs and Lord of the Flies\n",
        "\nAnd that's where the awesomeness of this album peaks and fades away. The long unawaited followup to the hopelessly banal X Factor album, I used to be inclined to give this album greater respect than its precursor, but one long and painful relisten later, it's clear that this is the absolute worst that Iron Maiden has to offer.\n\nA lot of the reviews seem to hint that there's some truly deep musical ingenuity to be found on this album. Unfortunately I couldn't detect any of it. It's not a terrible metal album, but for a band of Iron Maiden's status, it's inexcusably bad. This is not totally on the part of Blaze Bailey. I don't consider him a good singer necessarily, and he's certainly no Bruce Dickinson (or even a Paul Di'anno), but he's far from the worst singer I've ever heard and his presence on the album would not be enough to ruin it unless the music was also critically flawed. Which it most certainly is. The Iron Maiden magic has pretty much died. Virtual XI is long-winded and inconsistent, but worst of all, it's just plain boring. Outside of a few nice moments in \"Lightning Strikes Twice,\" there wasn't really a point over the course of listening to this album where I thought \"Hey, that was a really cool melody line.\" or \"Wow, that guitar solo kicked ass.\" Basically, it's unmemorable from beginning to end. It makes for decent background music while you're doing work or driving in your car I suppose, but this will never be one of those inspirational albums you just sit and listen to just for the sake of just sitting and listening to it. On another note, Janick Gers isn't half the player that Adrian Smith is. He doesn't have the skill as far as playing is concerned and he isn't even close to Adrian as far as songwriting. \n\nThis album is somewhat widely rated, with some loving it and some hating it, so it's hard to guarantee what any individual will think of it. If it helps at all, I've found something to like in every pre-Blaze and post-Blaze Iron Maiden album, but I can't stand this or its slightly less shitty big brother X Factor. Bruce Dickinson fans need not apply as well, as Janick did a much better job on his solo albums than on this gross misrepresentation of the Iron Maiden name. Suffice it to say, Virtual XI is a musical failure and should be duly avoided.\n",
        "\nThe only other Maiden album with Paul Di\u2019anno is an absolute rarity in metal, in that it takes the success of its predecessor and repeats it, without a really broad stylistic deviation. As far as I\u2019m concerned, it\u2019s basically a continuation of the first album. In some cases that would be a bad thing, especially considering the likelihood of poor songwriting and repetition, but Iron Maiden makes it work magnificently. Unfortunately, while Killers does take the best aspects of the first album with it, it also takes the same primary fault of that album as well. Inconsistency.\n\nJust like with their self-titled, the songs on Killers can be divided into two basic categories: the classics and the fillers. The former, of course, are the reason for the album\u2019s inherent awesomeness. \u201cWrathchild\u201d is lead-filled and has a killer groove. \u201cKillers\u201d has a lot of awesome guitar work and cool vocal lines. \u201cDrifter,\u201d a personal favorite, is infectiously catchy and has great vocal hooks. Other highlights include \u201cMurders in the Rue Morgue,\u201d half-ballad \u201cProdigal Son,\u201d and the sweet instrumental \u201cGenghis Khan.\u201d These songs all exhibit immense creativity, classic riffing, great leads, and even better vocals than the first album. The rest of the songs, however, are the reason for the mediocre score. They\u2019re decent songs, but generally unmemorable. The intro track \u201cIdes of March\u201d is completely unnecessary and boring to listen to, even for being so short. Even worse is \u201cAnother Life.\u201d I forget the name of it every single time I play the album through. Seriously, it just doesn\u2019t go anywhere. The same can basically be said for \u201cInnocent Exile\u201d and the slightly better \u201cPurgatory.\u201d These songs just aren\u2019t up to the quality as the other half of the album.\n\nSimilar to their first album, a little over half the tracks are worth listening to, while the other half is MIA in the quality department. But that classic half is definitely worth the time. This album is far from disappointing, despite my negative comments, and should be regarded higher than it usually is.\n",
        "\n2006 has proven to be a truly amazing year for metal, seeing the consistently solid releases of many metal acts in its various sub-genres. Staying true to what they\u2019ve always been about, Iron Maiden has succeeded once again in standing out amongst a stiff set of competitors and has created a magnum opus that carries many of the elements of their glory days. A Matter of Life and Death can be summed up as a great album both in terms of quality and quantity. Whereas on previous efforts Maiden had a small collection of grand epics, on this album they completely dominate the overall flow of things.\n\nIn my opinion, this is the first album where Maiden has successfully exploited the larger instrumentation that they gained in late 1999 to its fullest potential. All of the songs contain a variety of contrasting parts, particularly in the guitars, that almost give it an orchestral quality. Steve Harris\u2019 bass parts are consistently heavy in the same vain that first began on \u201cFear of the Dark\u201d, and his keyboard work is tasteful and provides a great atmospheric effect to serve as a counterpoint to the hard edged guitar and bass lines. Nicko\u2019s drumming is on point, as it consistently has been through Maiden\u2019s ups and downs since he first joined the band. \n\nHowever, the person who really shines on this album more than anyone else is Bruce Dickinson. After rejoining Maiden his vocal work has consistently been on an uptrend back towards the original power that they possessed on \u201cSomewhere in Time\u201d. Considering that there is a lack of vocal overdubs, also that many of these vocal tracks were done in one take, and that the melodies are extremely exposed Bruce\u2019s performance on here can be summed up as spellbinding.\n\nThe songs on here are all enormous undertakings as 7 out of 10 break the 6 minute mark. All of these songs contain a host of intricate changes in texture, feel, and intensity. \u201cBrighter than a Thousand Suns\u201d has several amazing transitions from quiet atmospheric sections to triumphant speed sections, spearheaded by Bruce\u2019s highly animated vocal presence. \u201cThe Longest Day\u201d begins ominously, as Bruce explores his lower range and the primary instrumental theme is quite haunting. Much like a classical symphony, this song has a very gradual yet highly dramatic build up from it\u2019s intro to its first anthem-like chorus. \u201cThe Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg\u201d reminds me heavily of the beginning of Dave Murray\u2019s compositional effort on \u201cD\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\u201d on the \u201cSomewhere in Time\u201d album at times, although it is not a speed metal song. \n\n\u201cFor the Greater Good of God\u201d is heavily bass driven and reminds me of the better songs off \u201cThe X Factor\u201d. Although it is the longest track on here, it is one of the more catchy tracks on here, rivaling \u201cHeaven Can Wait\u201d in terms of sing along value live, particularly at the chorus. \u201cThe Legacy\u201d has a lot of intricate acoustic guitar devices and more of the atmospheric elements that dominates the longer tracks on here, and lyrically is probably among the more riveting tracks on here. \u201cLord of Light\u201d is another incredibly haunting track, be it the gloomy intro with the somber vocals, or the hard edged body of the song which contains an equally ominous vocal performance. \u201cThese Colors Don\u2019t Run\u201d is a typical Maiden take on patriotism lyrically, although musically it carries many of the more progressive elements that define all the other epics on here.\n\nThe shorter tracks are equally as powerful, though likely more accessible as they don\u2019t contain nearly as many musical twists and turns. \u201cDifferent World\u201d is a solid speed anthem that follows suit from such recent Maiden tracks as \u201cThe Wicker Man\u201d and \u201cThe Rainmaker\u201d. \u201cThe Pilgrim\u201d is a straight forward up tempo rocker, although the primary theme occurs over a rather interesting dance-like feel. \u201cOut of the Shadows\u201d is a bit more of a progressive rock sounding track with an acoustic guitar line that reminds me of their older material with Paul Di\u2019anno at the helm.\n\nIn conclusion, this is the most powerful release that Maiden has put out in quite a while. If there is any flaw in it, it is that the individual songs tend to be so long and complex that there may be some accessibility issues. \u201cSomewhere in Time\u201d and \u201cKillers\u201d were both masterpieces primarily because they had the right balance of shorter and longer songs, whereas this album is almost completely devoid of tracks under the 5 minute mark. Most of the Maiden faithful will like this album, as will fans of Power/Progressive Metal.\n",
        "\nIron Maiden - The Number of the Beast. The greatest heavy metal album of all time? Hardly, although a significant number of people will likely argue this to the death. The greatest Iron Maiden album of all time? Not quite, though it showcases a few of their classics. So what is it the greatest of? Well actually, the album really isn\u2019t the greatest of anything. It has its classic moments, but it hasn\u2019t got the heart of the band\u2019s later releases. However, dwelling on what the album isn\u2019t might cause you to lose sight of what the album is. And what it is is an incredibly important album in metal history, regardless of its inherent flaws.\n\nI\u2018ll start with the album\u2019s strengths. First off, the songwriting here is phenomenal. Tons of memorable riffs, melody lines, and lead. Some of Maiden\u2019s best are present here in their full glory. Regardless of its simplicity, \u201cRun to the Hills\u201d is one of the single catchiest and most magnificent songs the band has ever released. The chorus is almost amazing beyond words. \u201cChildren of the Damned\u201d is one their better power ballad type songs, with a great sense of melody and a cool clean riff. \u201cHallowed Be Thy Name\u201d is of course none other than one of the band\u2019s most celebrated masterpieces musically, lyrically, and even atmospherically. The intro is still chilling almost 25 years later. If that doesn\u2019t scream greatness, I\u2019m not sure what does.\n\nSecondly, the addition of Bruce Dickinson was one of those legendary moments in metal history, as his creative influence would lead to dozens of classic tunes by the band. I personally like Paul Di\u2019anno as a vocalist, but he doesn\u2019t have the range that Bruce has. Bruce\u2019s vocals aren\u2019t perfect here, but they would be by the next album, Piece of Mind. His presence in the band is incredibly welcome.\n\nNow on to its flaws. Its most glaring problem is the same one from the first two albums. While some of the songs are classics, the others are pretty much forgettable. Songs such as \u201cGangland\u201d and \u201c22 Acacia Avenue\u201d really unbalance a generally strong album. If the band can write 5-6 classic songs, why can\u2019t they write 2 more instead of filler? Your guess is as good as mine, though they wouldn\u2019t have this problem on most of their prior albums. My other big complaint is with the bass sound. I never really noticed this until my most recent listen, but the bass guitar part is way louder than it should be, sometimes overpowering the guitars. Yes, Steve Harris is a great bassist, but he doesn\u2019t need to be way up front like that.\n\nOther than the weaker tracks and erroneous mixing, Number of the Beast is a great album by all means. It\u2019s heavy, it\u2019s quick, it\u2019s catchy, it\u2019s melodic, and it\u2019s quite memorable. It\u2019s not the band\u2019s best work, but it shows the first signs of the true greatness the band would soon afterwards achieve.\n",
        "\nOf all the bands to emerge during the NWOBHM invasion, none have been more celebrated than the legendary Iron Maiden. Taking the frantic speed metal pace and dueling harmony leads even further than Judas Priest would, Maiden is consistently mentioned as a key influence by up and coming metal bands even to date. Though their debut is rawer and far less epic than the albums that would make them icons of the decade, it\u2019s an essential chunk of NWOBHM history and a solid listen from start to finish. \n\nThough the Di\u2019anno led albums are essentially proto-incarnations of the band\u2019s true sound, most of their signature elements were already established from the very beginning. Steve Harris\u2019 mighty basswork already kept the band ahead of the pack, while his songwriting on here is pretty much flawless. The Dave Murray/Adrian Smith [edit: Dennis Straton actually filled the second guitar spot on this album. Adrian would not join on until after this album's release. Please excuse my ignorance] guitar duo was already ringing out brilliant solos and some of the finest harmony work seen at the turn of the decade. The epic bridge section in \u201cPhantom of the Opera\u201d is arguably the greatest display of their skill, not just on this album, but in comparison to even their most recent work. The band would become most notable for their faster songs (the speedy instrumental \u201cTransylvania,\u201d as well as the rock worthy \u201cRunning Free\u201d), but their ability to perform well in a mellower situation is also established here. \u201cRemember Tomorrow\u201d is among their best ballads (with some of their most emotive playing and a dramatically energetic mid-section) and \u201cStrange World\u201d helps to showcase Paul Di\u2019annos\u2019s lighter side, a side rarely seen as he howls his way through most of the songs on here. Special mention goes to opener \u201cProwler\u201d for a mighty fine utilization of the wah pedal.\n\nThere isn\u2019t a bad song on here, but admittedly, I still can\u2019t get into \u201cRunning Free.\u201d Yeah, I know it\u2019s one of the first songs they ever wrote and it\u2019s historically important and so on but it feels out of place nonetheless. \u201cCharlotte the Harlot\u201d has grown on me, however, and I now consider that another one of this album\u2019s classic tunes (of which there are many).\n\nBut those are just my afterthoughts of the album. Most fans will have no trouble elevating this to god-like status after a few mere listens. Inferior perhaps, when compared to some of the Dickinson-era classics, but undoubtedly one of the band\u2019s finest releases.\n",
        "\nAlmost 30 years after their incarnation, Iron Maiden has retained the distinct ability to sound like Iron Maiden. Sometimes it\u2019s a more formulaic, repetitive Iron Maiden, but other times it\u2019s an ingenious, creative, powerful Iron Maiden. Dance of Death is one of the finest hours of that second group, a testament to a band that can still release passionate, original heavy metal nearly three decades into their career.\n\nContinuing with the progressive stylings of Brave New World, Dance of Death generally consists of longer, more intricate compositions than their earlier albums. Unlike BNW however, the band\u2019s classic songwriting style is applied quite a bit. There\u2019s still a fair amount of synthesizer integration, but the songs are catchier and more memorable. Whereas BNW had all quality songs but no standout tracks, Dance of Death is almost all standouts with a few weaker spots, similar to Piece of Mind in that sense. The first track, \u201cWildest Dreams,\u201d is arguably the catchiest Iron Maiden song since \u201cHooks in You.\u201d A lot of the songs utilize clean riffs and synth textures, but others are just plain heavy as hell. The album is very diverse and it makes for a powerful listening experience from beginning to end.\n\nIt must be noted that all three guitarists have gotten even better since BNW. The solos throughout the album are among the band\u2019s most technical and several among their classics. The riffs are really good too, with a good variety of sound and application. Bruce\u2019s vocals are still great, with tons of memorable vocal melodies. Several of the songs have absolutely classic lyrics, although the repetitive choruses start to get a little old (much more so than on BNW). Steve\u2019s bass work is solid and the mix keeps him from sounding obnoxious. Instrumentally there isn\u2019t really anything to complain about. The band is talented and they aren\u2019t afraid to show it.\n\nAs far as individual songs, there are indeed some true classics on here. \u201cDance of Death\u201d and \u201cPaschendale\u201d are the epics of the album, both of them being unbelievably well-written, full of amazing guitar playing, and powerful atmospherically. Other songs like \u201cWildest Dreams\u201d and \u201cRainmaker\u201d show off a more classic Maiden sound and are quite catchy. A personal favorite of mine is \u201cMontsegur,\u201d notable for its inherent heaviness, awesome riffs and melody lines, and THE sing-along chorus of the album. It\u2019s impressive, to say the least.\n\nI don\u2019t see how Iron Maiden fans could possibly be disappointed with this album. It\u2019s not the band\u2019s best work per say, but it has the power and speed of their older songs as well as the aesthetic songwriting and progressivism of their later work. Several of the songs can hold their own against the band\u2019s best work and it doesn\u2019t take the open-mindedness required for appreciating BNW, this album is immediately accessible. The only thing I don't like about the album is the stupid CG cover. It's a cool concept, but would have been a thousand times better as an illustration. Regardless, Dance of Death is indeed a testament to the band\u2019s skill and it provides a glimpse of what the band might be capable of in future releases: if they follow its example, chances are the next one will be even better.\n",
        "\nIt\u2019s almost astonishing how much life Bruce Dickinson brings to Iron Maiden. The two albums recorded in his absence were unbelievably devoid of energy. There was no feeling and no intensity to the music, just uninteresting, drawn-out recordings. Jump forward a few years to the release of Brave New World and the triumphant return of both Bruce Dickinson and guitarist Adrian Smith. What we get is not the greatest album of all time, but an impressive release nonetheless. The sound is a little different, but it\u2019s still distinguishably Iron Maiden in its purest form. Just make sure to give it more than one listen before you judge it.\n\nBrave New World is perhaps the artsiest Maiden release yet. Most of the songs are longer than typical, with a lot of lush synth textures mingling with the guitar work, especially in the mellower sections. It\u2019s somewhat progressive in that sense, similar to the way Somewhere in Time and Seventh Son are presented. Unlike those albums, Brave New World has no stand-out tracks, which is its only notable flaw. There are no songs as magnificent as \u201cInfinite Dreams\u201d nor are there any on the level of classics like \u201cThe Clairvoyant,\u201d \u201cWasted Years,\u201d or \u201cAlexander the Great.\u201d However, that doesn\u2019t mean that the album is weak in any sense. Every song is incredibly well-written and polished. There is no filler; every song lets you hear that there was an incredible amount of effort put into composing and recording it. The general level of consistency and quality is a lot higher than most of the band\u2019s other releases. Whether the song is a straight-forward rocker like \u201cThe Wicker Man\u201d and \u201cThe Mercenary\u201d or a more diverse epic like \u201cDream of Mirrors\u201d and \u201cThe Nomad,\u201d the album just kicks incredible ass. The songwriting has progressed way beyond the band\u2019s heavier albums, but there is still a fair amount of pure metal riffing integrated. It\u2019s not the album you\u2019d generally listen to for casual head banging since its more of a \u2018progressive\u2019 experience, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not heavy in its own right.\n\nAs noted before, Bruce Dickinson returns on this album and his presence is most welcome. His voice hasn\u2019t sounded this good since Seventh Son. The vocal melodies are absolutely amazing and the production allows his vocals to be delivered articulately, another plus for this album. Even the lyrics are really good, though that\u2019s not much of a surprise on most Maiden albums. Adrian Smith\u2019s return is also welcome, considering that he\u2019s twice the player that Janick Gers is. But Janick has stayed on, even with Adrian\u2019s return, making it the largest Iron Maiden ensemble to date. Three lead guitarists may seem like overkill, but it allows for a more complete live performance. Iron Maiden is not the kind of band to waste three guitarists by writing parts with only one or two in mind. Besides, the Eagles did it years beforehand and made it work.\n\nOne of the best things about Iron Maiden is listening to the guitarists progress between albums. From the band\u2019s first release all the way up the this one, you can hear the solos getting better and better, rather than more repetitive and formulaic. The guitar tone on this album is stellar, probably the best yet, allowing it to meld beautifully with the synth layers. It\u2019s a really polished album, but doesn\u2019t sound overproduced. Another thing easy to notice are the drums. I\u2019ve never really presented Maiden\u2019s drum work as one the band\u2019s outstanding aspects, but the drums sound really good on here. The drumming itself is quite intricate, even incorporating double bass pedal, while the mix is almost perfect. All the volumes and sound are ideal and it doesn\u2019t go unnoticed. Great production on this album, especially since they managed to keep Steve Harris\u2019 bass in check. \n\nI really can\u2019t find fault in this album, except that I wouldn\u2019t put any of its songs on a Maiden greatest hits. The album on a whole is outstanding, a natural progression of one of metal\u2019s most respected groups. It\u2019s powerful, heavy at times, mellow at others, and it\u2019s one of the band\u2019s most melodic and overall well-written releases. It takes a little time to get into, but once you do, it\u2019s an incredibly rewarding experience.\n",
        "\nFollowing up a masterpiece like Dance of Death was always going to be difficult even for a band like Maiden but as always they\u2019ve had a right go at it. They\u2019ve done it in the only way they could have and that is by doing it differently.\n\nThis album is both a step forward and a step back musically. It\u2019s a lot more technically developed than Dance of Death and the guitar trio really come into their own here. However this album also represents a musical paradigm shift back to the X Factor days. Gone are the catchy melodies of Dance of Death which are replaced by a broody and dark atmosphere.\n\nOne thing one must not do with \u201cA Matter of Life and Death\u201d is judge it on the first listen. It\u2019s taken me a good three months and at least 40-50 listens to really get into and understand it (which is why the late review). \n\nAs I said it\u2019s nowhere near as catchy as Dance of Death and on the first listen no songs really stick out. The album does seem to follow one musical theme (though not reflected in the lyrics which are pretty similar to those on Dance of Death) but ends up getting a bit tedious after a while. And at this stage it\u2019s just the typically brilliant solos that prevent me from skipping most of the songs. This is especially evident on songs like the weak opener \u201cDifferent Worlds\u201d (which has to be their weakest opener ever) and the overlong \u201cThe Longest Day\u201d. Maiden solos however, have always been superb and this album is no exception.\n\nThe first part of the album features the nadir of musicality that any album can suffer from \u2013 filler. The opener, \u201cThese Colors Don\u2019t Run\u201d, \u201cThe Pilgrim\u201d and \u201cThe Longest Day\u201d may not have been on the album and it wouldn\u2019t have made any difference. The only song of the first five that\u2019s worth much is \u201cBrighter than a Thousand Suns\u201d specifically for containing one of the two moments on the album that screams HEAVY FUCKING METAL and makes you throw the horns and BANG YOUR HEAD in the form of the riff that supports the first solo section (the other such moment being during the solo section of \u201cLord of Light\u201d).\n\nThese songs do have some good points though and the individual riffs may just have worked if they had better usage and while they\u2019ve lost some of their previous charm thankfully they\u2019re no less ingenious. Just when you get tired of listening to one riff/triplet they\u2019ll switch to the next (except on \u201cThese Colors don\u2019t Run\u201d which suffers from overuse of one mildly interesting riff-set). And while the intro-riff-verse-chorus-verse-chorus-solo-new riff-solo-old riff-chorus pattern may get a bit repetitive after a while (especially by the time you get to the musical quagmire that is \u201cThe Longest Day\u201d) they end with five top songs that essentially save the album.\n\nAnd HELL do they save the album. We start with the short and sweet ballad \u201cOut of the Shadows\u201d that precedes the onslaught of brilliance. This in itself isn\u2019t all that special but here is the cue for a refreshing shift in mood and musical emphasis from the moody darkness of songs like \u201cBrighter than a Thousand Suns\u201d to the cheerful goofy smile inducing brilliance that we\u2019ve come to expect of Maiden over the years. They\u2019re right up there with the best of the glory days. First up is the strange choice of single \u201cThe Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg\u201d which may be mid-paced but certainly doesn\u2019t bore. The riff is fun while it lasts and the instrumentation is superb (strangely reminiscent at times of Metallica during the good times). This one also contains Bruce\u2019s best performance on this album (his voice\u2019s age is showing now). \n\n\u201cFor the Greater Good of God\u201d showcases all of their talent and rushes past despite the fact that it\u2019s all of 9 minutes long and the slightly repetitious chorus. It features the best guitar work (compositionally) on the album. \u201cLord of Light\u201d is a slightly unusual track considering the standard Maiden style. The first triplet\u2019s a good 5 and a half minutes into the song and until then both the tone and the style of riffing remind me more of Painkiller era Judas Priest rather than anything Maiden\u2019s done before. This is however the most technical track on the album and if not for the one to come would have been the best one.\n\nThe last song though is the real masterpiece of this album. \u201cThe Legacy\u201d is probably the best they\u2019ve written since\u2026hell I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve every done anything quite like this. The way it starts off probably makes you think \u201cThey\u2019ve gone and done Journeyman all over again\u201d however when it picks up pace it rocks. Not only does it rock but it does so without ever losing focus. It\u2019s by no means their heaviest song but that hardly matters. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to pick out why this song is just as good as it is. Maybe it\u2019s because of the lyrics that perfectly sum up all the shit in the world right now. Maybe it\u2019s because of how Maiden in their usual impeccable manner, perfectly use the melancholy melody to convey their message. I remember using the word cheerful however this is anything but. The opening acoustic meandering may sound simple but it\u2019s effective and haunting nonetheless. It sets you up perfectly for to aural onslaught to come. To use an analogy Steve Harris would like it\u2019s like a good football (soccer) team passing the ball around in the defense and midfield before playing the killer pass forward for the goal. The heavier portions are slightly symphonic but this time they\u2019ve got it right (unlike Dance of Death where they overdid it). I started off the review hoping not to give any one song too much attention but if any song deserves it, it is The Legacy. This is by far their best work since anything off Fear of the Dark and this album is worth it just for that. \n\nTechnically there are very few complaints I have with this album. Bruce\u2019s age is showing but the rest of the band\u2019s performance covers for that. I like the integration of synth and symphonic elements which works a lot better on here than on Dance of Death. The production is different from earlier but that\u2019s merely to accentuate the atmosphere that they obviously wanted. The only things I can think of is that perhaps Janick\u2019s guitar could have been a little louder and a little more double bass would have been good. But these are minor details and take little away from the album.\n\nThis is a good album. It\u2019s not better than Dance of Death but can hold its own against it any day. It\u2019s got its fair share of brilliant songs but also unlike Dance of Death has some filler (which is what prevented a 90+ rating). When you buy it don\u2019t expect anything like Dance of Death. You won\u2019t get it. What you will get is Maiden kicking your ass with the album that The X Factor wishes it was. This Maiden is different. It\u2019s a mature Maiden and it may be very different from the old one but it\u2019s not any worse for it.\n",
        "\nThis single is the brainchild of probably my favorite guitar/songwriter from the 80s, Adrian Smith. The guitar line to the title track of this single is probably one of the most memorable in the realm of metal, and is sort of a rite of passage for any lead guitar player who wishes to tear it up with a band in the metal genre. The chorus is very easy to sing along to and is a regular favorite at live performances.\n\n\"Reach Out\" is another rare treat, Adrian Smith on vocals with Bruce backing him up. He does an excellent job on the vox, but his strength on this one is his catchy guitar riffs. This song has a solo that is so idomatic that you could easily hum the tune along with it, something that metal guitar solos are not often famous for. \"Sheriff of Huddersfield\" is a full blown laugh fest, and a bucket of fun, something fairly typical of Maiden's 3rd tracks on their various singles. (Roll Over Vic Vella is a good example).\n\nIn conclusion, this single is probably a bit hard to come by at this point, but if you can find it I recommend it highly. It's a great song from Maiden's greatest album, and a pair of tracks that will make you smile and make you laugh, something that metal is allowed to do to people, despite what the no-fun elitists of the darker scene tell you.\n",
        "\nIron Maiden has always been known for their ferocious music and live shows, and this video captures the energy and music very well. This release features the classic line-up of the Killers, and every song on the tracklist for this is video is a classic. This is probably one of, if not the best, live representations of these songs.\n\nMaiden is a very tight band here with a lot of raw energy, the twin guitars of Adrian and Dave are awesome, they really wail on this release with Steve's bass thundering right along with Clive's drums for that classic Maiden sound. Also, Paul Di'Anno really shines on this release, his vocals are excellent and fresh here (although, in my opinion, he IS the best Iron Maiden vocalist). The audience is really great and supportive on here, screaming right along with Di'Anno on the songs. \"Phantom of the Opera\" and \"Transylvania\" are two big highlights here, they just make you want to bang your head until your neck breaks! \"The Ides Of March\" and \"Wrathchild\" are a great kicking start to this too, they get you going, and the assault doesn't stop until the end with \"Iron Maiden\" which just leaves you begging for more.\n\nThe only complaint here is that the show is relatively short, but this is understandable as they only had one album out at this point, but this show is perfect the way it is. An interesting note here is that the version played of the song \"Killers\" has completely different lyrics from the album, because the song wasnt completely finished at the time of this show. All in all, get this concert! It's now available on \"The Early Years Part 1\" DVD.\n",
        "\nBrave New World was a return to form by a band that had been struggling with it's own identity a bit ever since the inception of the 90s and all the horrid musical changes that followed. Though Steve Harris and those that remained after the exodus of Adrian Smith and later Bruce Dickinson never bought into the ridiculousness of the Grunge, Neo-Punk Alternative, Punk Ska and Swing Scenes, the tone of their music was affected a bit by the musical bankrupcy that surrounded them.\n\nWhat this single represents, in it's most basic form, is the element that kept Maiden accessable to a wider audience than the symphonic and progressive metal fans who eat up all of Steve Harris' long-winded epics. Adrian Smith has put together, with help from Harris in keeping the formula from being too cliche, is an instant metal classic in a time period where the genre was enjoying a renaissance in mainland Europe, but still was in severe recession in the States and the UK. The Wickerman is more than just a collection of catchy riffs, idiomatic leads, and musical devices, it is a loud declaration that the Maiden of old has returned with a vengence.\n\nThe version of this song that is on the rare single version I have carries a strong set of backing vocal tracks that, unfortunately, are not present on the studio version. This alone gives the song a more anthemic quality that keeps it fresh, rather than the repetitive sound that has defined many of Maiden's more recent compositions. \n\nThe rest of the tracks that appear on this single are solid performances by the 6 person line-up while on the Ed Hunter Tour. Suffice to say, Bruce has gotten his voice back and preforms the older Maiden material that he originally sung as great as ever, and he clearly outshines Blaze at singing the newer material. However, as always, his rendition of \"Killers\" just doesn't cut it. Nobody sings that song the way Di'anno did, and I can't listen to a performance of it without comparing it to the original version. With the exception of \"Iron Maiden\" and \"Running Free\", Bruce has never been able to truly perform the Di'anno era stuff well, his screams are just too throaty and over-the-top.\n\nIn conclusion, this is a re-awakening for a band that had been in a state of sleep for the better part of a decade. Although I would recommend getting the entire studio album of \"Brave New World\" first, this single is also worth tracking down, especially if you can get the one with the Radio editted alternate version of Wickerman, which is not easy to come by. Recommended highly to fans of older Maiden, particularly the atmospheric music from \"Somewhere in Time\" and \"Seventh Son\".\n",
        "\nFollowing the amazing and still easily accessible \"Somewhere in Time\", the British quintet that helped usher in the greatest decade for music, known as Iron Maiden, entered the studio to deliver yet another stellar release. We have it all on here: amazing guitar solos, dramatic vocals, atmospheric keyboard lines, complex bass lines, bombastic drum beats, and some of the greatest songs ever put forth by member of the NWOBHM. This is the album that more recent acts such as Avantasia, Iron Savior, Gamma Ray, and Dragonforce look to when trying to create something that transcends the basic formula that defines metal.\n\nLike many individual tracks off of previous albums, Maiden has crafted a concept album based off of a famous work of literature. I myself am not familiar with the novel myself, but the storyline depicted in the lyrics is easy to follow, and mostly deals with a character who possesses unique powers due to the nature of his birth. Historically there are certain places in Europe where people believed that a seventh son of a seventh son would be born a vampire, and that could well have been the inspiration for the original story. The character tries to utilize his gifts for the good of the world, despite the inner conflicts depicted in several songs, but ultimately comes into conflict with the people he's trying to save.\n\nMusically this album is fairly far removed from anything Maiden has ever done before and would later do in subsequent releases. It contains the dense atmosphere the dominates all of the newer albums both with Blaze Bayley and with Bruce back in the fold, as well as the hard edged sound that is found on the earlier releases with Bruce leading the charge. It also contains some rather interesting studio effects, such as the dialogue-like interplay between vocal tracks on \"The Prophecy\", and the echoing sound of the guitars in the quiet section of the title track.\n\nAdrian Smith and Dave Murray both shine consistently throughout this album as songwriters and players. Murray's rather inspired compositional collaboration with Steve Harris, \"The Prophecy\", is loaded with catchy yet highly varied themes and contrasting sections. The syllabic and charming acoustic outro to the song is highly reminiscent of the one found on Black Sabbath's classic song \"Heaven and Hell\". \"The Evil that Men Do\" is easily the most accessible and well known Maiden track on this album, and highlights Adrian Smith's unrelenting ability to pump out classic tracks that standout amongst other, equally gripping songs. As far as lead work goes, \"Moonchild\" and \"Infinite Dreams\" are loaded with excellent solos, but the true magnum opus in this department is the title track. It is interesting to note that the song structure of \"Hanger 18\" by MegaDeth is highly similar to this song, both in terms of guitar solo sections and overall feel.\n\nSteve Harris has the lion's share of compositional duties on this album, as has always been the case, but on this album his talents are a bit more focused as he is writing songs for a single concept. \"Moonchild\", \"Infinite Dreams\", the title track, \"The Clairvoyant\" and \"Only the Good Die Young\" all contain a common spirit that links them together, yet individually they stand quite well. As far as bass duties go, his work on \"Infinite Dreams\" and \"The Clairvoyant\" are noteworthy, though his best technical display is the brief bass solo in the middle section of \"Only the Good Die Young\".\n\nBruce Dickinson's voice is amazing on here, although at times it is a tiny bit overdone, particularly on certain parts of \"Moonchild\" and \"Infinite Dreams\". But his overall performance is highly dynamic, ranging from straight-forward operatic singing, to a spoken narrative on the title track. If I had to pick a stand out vocal performance on here, it would be a toss up between \"The Clairyovant\" and the title track.\n\nThere is only one actual flaw on this album, and it is to be found on the one song that I have yet to mention, \"Can I Play with Madness\". Although it is a decent song that could be described as a shorter version of \"Heaven Can Wait\", the chorus is a tiny bit weak and redundant. The guitar solo and musical interludes at the song's center, in addition to some decent guitar and drum work, almost make up for this but it is still something that can not escape notice.\n\nIn conclusion, this album came about in the late 80s, at the end of Maidens high point in it's history. Sadly it would be the last album for more than 10 years without Adrian Smith, and his influence gave the band a good deal of it's strength. The sub-par \"No Prayer for the Dying\" underscores the impact that his playing and songwriting had on the band, and most of the better songs that have since been recorded with the fully reformed Maiden in recent years have his name on them. It comes highly recommended to fans of Power Metal, Progressive Metal, and Traditional 80s Metal. But in my personal opinion, no one who claims to be a follower of metal, in any of it's sub-genres, should make excuses for not owning it.\n",
        "\nWhen I think of IM\u2019s catalogue, strangely this album (Dance of Death, for those who forgot!) comes off as the strange one. Perhaps it\u2019s the production, which sounds rather different for Maiden, perhaps it\u2019s the \u20181-2, 1-2-3-4\u2019 count that begins the album or perhaps (and most probably) it\u2019s the hurried songwriting one can detect here. Maiden I guess must have written the album in quite a hurry to capitalize on the frenzy Brave New World created. Anyway, despite how odd it is or how hurried the writing process was \u2013 this is still a damn good album. Although some of the tracks do seem unnecessary (\u2018Age Of Innocence\u2019, \u2018Montsegur\u2019, \u2018Journeyman\u2019). Although all three are decent tracks, they just don\u2019t seem to fit in with the rest of the album. \u2018Montsegur\u2019 has Bruce singing too fast for the song\u2019s own good but the song still is decent with some excellent soloing in it. The riff though, is ripped off from \u2018The Fallen Angel\u2019. The lyrics to \u2018Age Of Innocence\u2019 is excellent but the song itself has an oddly happy chorus \u2013 just doesn\u2019t fit in with the rest of the song and the solo just sucks although the twin-lead is excellent. Maiden\u2019s worst closer \u2013 by far. Also, the chorus to \u2018No More Lies\u2019 is silly and repetitive, but the song itself has an excellent vocal performance, a great tense atmosphere (especially during the beginning with Bruce doing excellently on vocals) and masterful soloing. \u2018Journeyman\u2019 is the best of the three and is a complete ballad. Very pleasant and nice, but not quite a good way to end the album.\n\nNow that all the flaws are out of the way \u2013 only the good is left. And oh my, what is left isn\u2019t just good, it\u2019s damned excellent material which wouldn\u2019t be out of place in early Maiden. \u2018Wildest Dreams\u2019 is an excellent opener, it isn\u2019t as breakneck as Maiden\u2019s other speedy tracks but it\u2019s extremely catchy with killer melodies and a great solo by Adrian in it. \u2018Rainmaker\u2019 has that genius opening riff and is another very catchy song. The twin-lead here is marvelously melodic. The title track starts off with some beautiful strumming and picks up rhythm steadily as it goes on. This track is the strongest of the three epics (\u2018No More Lies\u2019, the title track, \u2018Paschendale\u2019) on here. It sounds epic and exquisitely epic, just check out the brilliance of that melody at 2:59 followed by the mesmerizing celtic melody after it. Also, the soloing here is absolutely brilliant \u2013 the band still has everything going right. While Brave New World sunk in the middle and gave its best at the end, DoD gives its best in the middle and sinks in the end. \u2018Gates Of Tomorrow\u2019 is an absolutely delightful track with a very catchy chorus and excellent melodies. I just wonder how anyone can deride this ultra-catchy track as filler. \u2018New Frontier\u2019 is another amazing track \u2013 this quite possibly may be the best track on the album. A very spirited performance by Bruce on vocals here. This thing has absolutely fantastic chorus and pre-chorus both of which are catchier than anything I\u2019ve ever heard, honest. The soloing and riffing here are both incredible. The song maintains a precise and tasteful melody throughout. This is an incredibly underrated song \u2013 people must be snoozing off while they listen to this as they call it a \u2018standard\u2019 Maiden track. If this was a \u2018standard\u2019 Maiden track, this might as well be the best \u2018standard\u2019 track they\u2019ve made \u2013 so pay attention! \n\nSuddenly now, after the rather happy \u2018New Frontier\u2019, the album gets all dark on us. \u2018Paschendale\u2019 is a dark epic with morbid imagery. The song starts off slow with a rather haunting keyboard melody and then turns into one of Maiden\u2019s heaviest songs with a monstrous riff. Bruce performs excellently here and of course, the soloing is excellent. The chorus is mind-blowing with a clear contrast in it, while it starts out optimistically it ends with a rather pessimistic note \u2013 which is what gives it the charm. \u2018Face In The Sand\u2019 has Nicko using double bass for the first time in his career. The orchestral build-up is excellent and charmingly dark and unsettling. The song then morphs into another Maiden classic with a brilliant performance by Bruce. The soloing once again, rules and the \u2018oh-oh-oh\u2019 singalong section at the near end fits in very well. The atmosphere around the song is what gives it its charm \u2013 very dark and unsettling indeed. The lyrics too sound absolutely brilliant \u2013 the band never ever lost their touch with the quill. \n\nThe album is very consistent and just as good as Brave New World. Although Iron Maiden would perfect this mixture of traditional Maiden and the The X Factor on their next album A Matter Of Life And Death, both these albums too are essential listening as they show the transition of the group to that masterpiece.\n",
        "\nI don\u2019t know why lots of people have been getting up recently proclaiming this to be \u2018nothing like Maiden\u2019 and a \u2018really really bad album\u2019. I don\u2019t understand this \u2018I hate the legends so I\u2019m cool\u2019 stance lots of people have taken up. This album sounds very much like a bridge between the X factor era and 7th Son Maiden. Bruce too has returned and thus the vocal performance here is much better than the previous effort. Although he isn\u2019t quite his prime, Bruce still manages to get the job done \u2013 and excellently at that. The production is just about perfect with everything retaining its place perfectly. Nicko\u2019s drumming too has shown great signs of improvement, I tell you - this guy gets better as he ages. Steve\u2019s chunking bass can be heard clearly and still maintains solidity. The riffing here isn\u2019t the dark X Factor-style riffing (although check out \u2018The Fallen Angel\u2019 and \u2018Out Of the Silent Planet\u2019 for moments of this) but a more traditional Maiden style gallop. The song\u2019s aren\u2019t at al built on weak riffs like every detractor mentions. They have three guitarists now, although the material here still remains only for two. It is still murky why they keep Gers hanging around \u2013 he obviously isn\u2019t half as good as either of his co-guitarists. \n\n\u2018The Wicker Man\u2019 starts off the album with an improvised \u2018Running Wild\u2019 (Judas Priest) riff. The song is upbeat speeder with a great chorus and \u2018oh-oh- singalong section. \u2018Ghost Of The Navigator\u2019 starts off with beautiful, dream-like strumming before beginning with the \u2018I Don\u2019t Know\u2019 (Ozzy Osbourne) riff. The song isn\u2019t as good as everyone proclaims it to be, but is still excellent with that bridge at 5:03 being especially distinctive in that it manages to sound just as if a boat were sinking in a raging sea \u2013 it shows Maiden\u2019s ability to conjure images of said lyrics in the listeners mental spectrum using only music. \u2018Brave New World\u2019 is a half ballad and once again starts with beautiful strumming. The song is another highlight as it is tinged with atmosphere and emotion and also has a sing-along chorus and pre-chorus and a great solo section. \u2018Blood Brothers\u2019 is surely one of the albums best tracks. The thing just oozes atmosphere and inspiration. The keyboards and guitar both are used excellently to develop the song as Bruce\u2019s excellent vocals and the melodies add to the tensing of the atmosphere before the mesmerizing chorus. The effect truly is stunning and especially works live. The keyboard segments on the song are absolutely fantastic and contribute excellently to it. \u2018The Mercenary\u2019 though is a low-point. Bruce sounds vicious here delivering the verses and the chorus with power and inspiration. But unfortunately the chorus and pre-chorus are absolutely grating and especially so when repeated again and again and again. Slap all this on a standard Maiden track and what we have here is a track totally not up to Maiden\u2019s standards. \u2018Dream Of Mirrors\u2019 is a nice, epic song with great, fluid tempo changes. Bruce sounds really great here perfectly bringing forth the underlying desperation in the song, although not quite as well as say \u2018The Clairvoyant\u2019. There\u2019s a heck-lot to sing-along to here which especially makes it work live \u2013 \u2018the dream is true\u2026\u2019, \u2018I only dream in black and white\u2019 and that excellent \u2018oh-oh\u2019 section in the near end. The song moves from slow in the beginning to absolutely frantic in the end with excellent, pump-like drumming from Nicko. \u2018The Fallen Angel\u2019 is a nice, small slab of The X Factor. The riffing here sounds very X and so do the chorus and the pre-chorus. \n\nNow is when the album starts getting really good. Up till now, the album has been just \u2018good\u2019 and would have earned a 70+ score but the last three epics cranked up the score quite a lot. These three songs are the best on the album. \u2018The Nomad\u2019 is a brilliant pseudo-Egyptian epic with an awesome mid-section. \u2018Out Of the Silent Planet\u2019 is incredibly haunting with mesmerizing melodies and gets really damn fast as it ends in contrast to the milder start. This and the closer both are neck-to-neck for the best song on the album. \u2018The Thin Line between Love and Hate\u2019 is an awesome way to end the album. It has a strange vocal approach and a queer chorus (at least it seems so to me) all of which work in unexpectedly excellent ways. Also, there\u2019s some absolutely gorgeous soloing here. The song in contrast to its predecessor starts off mid-paced and gets slower as it goes. The melody in the slow section is taken from Heathen\u2019s \u2018Prisoner of Fate\u2019; here it is highlighted whereas there it passed off in a mere 3 seconds. The song though, ends rather abruptly \u2013 one can immediately notice this. But heh, if one hears rather closely \u2013 he can hear the Nicko lamenting and the band laughing over him missing a cymbal, perhaps that\u2019s why. \n\nAll in all, this album is above 70 minutes in length \u2013 and still manages to be entertaining. This is quite a feat, and to think Maiden have done it a total of 4 times (The X Factor, A Matter Of Life And Death, Brave New World, Dance Of Death) already! This is truly what puts Maiden at the top of all bands including legends like Priest and Sabbath. Their music is more well-thought out which can clearly be seen in the lyrics \u2013 the lyrics are based mainly on history or literature unlike the other great bands out there who write on anarchism, sex, drugs or rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. Their style has remained similar throughout their career with significant and miniscule variations made without losing the path they originally took unlike the thousands of other bands out there. Looking at Maiden\u2019s career and winning formula establishes perfectly the difference between the legendary bands (Judas Priest, Black Sabbath, Deep Purple) and the king of them all \u2013 Maiden who have kept their material fresh and have soldiered on to be a relevant band even in this decade.\n",
        "\nThink of The X Factor. Now think of it harmonized with the dark feeling kept only to a few songs. Add a ton of repetitive choruses to the mix. That\u2019s Virtual XI. The weak production continues, this time the rhythm guitar is even thinner and bass even higher. Blaze sounds even more out of place on this one. The whole band itself sounds tired and worn out \u2013 songwriting has totally suffered as a result with poor vocal melodies and awful choruses and a general lack of ideas all making their appearance here. The whole record retains a more melodic, rock feel to itself.\n\nBlaze as has been said is all the more out of place here. The vocal melodies are at many times poorly written. The choruses are legendary for their repetitiveness. Steve does a good job on bass although it\u2019s just high enough to make it even overshadow the guitar at times. The soloing is killer as usual but the riffs are what are lacking in the guitar department \u2013 all the riffs here sound bland and uninspired. The keyboard use in the album is very tasteful and succeeds in creating atmosphere where the song can\u2019t.\n\n\u2018Futureal\u2019 starts off the album speedily. A rather tame song compared to \u2018Man on the Edge\u2019 or \u2018Be Quick Or Be Dead\u2019 but it still is very catchy with a heck of a solo and it gets over fast enough for you not to bother about the chorus. \u2018The Angel and the Gambler\u2019 is a test of patience. All the verses sound similar to each other and the chorus is repeated often enough for Bruce to contemplate committing suicide. The solo in there really is good, but the song is torrid enough for you not to notice. \u2018Lightning Strikes Twice\u2019 is a dark song, one of the two songs on here where the dark feel is retained. It is an excellent song with great use of melody and excellent soloing. \u2018The Clansman\u2019 is considered a classic and rightfully so, the chorus is effective despite being composed of a single word. Blaze sings in a beastly, proud voice which really carries the aggressive patriotism portrayed in the song. \u2018When Two Worlds Collide\u2019 is another excellent song which also features great use of bass and melody. The chorus here is totally addictive as are the verses. \u2018The Educated Fool\u2019 has good use of double-layered vocals and great melodies, but when the damn thing is repeated a million times \u2013 it totally loses its effect. The song sucks due to the infinite repetition here. \u2018Don\u2019t Look To The Eyes Of The Stranger\u2019 is rather decent, the chorus and the soft segments suck, but when the band picks up they really do rip up. \u2018Como Estais Amigos\u2019 is a lost classic, the entire song is very dark and atmospheric with an amazingly emotion tinged performance by Blaze especially in the chorus. This one has great soloing, tasteful use of keyboard, a brooding atmosphere and excellent guitar/vocal melodies \u2013 all the ingredients of an awesome song and the perfect way to close the album.\n\nAll in all, the album is a step backward. If you can get by the repetition, then you\u2019d find a pretty good album here. This album was the last with Blaze and Bruce\u2019s return in Brave New World heralded a return to form for Maiden. Unlike Priest, Maiden have still held on to their bad past and have played songs from both the Blaze albums and the Di\u2019Annio albums live, This is obviously an excellent choice as the songs sound excellent with Bruce as well.\n",
        "\nThis is undoubtedly the most underrated album ever. People ramble on and on about non-existent flaws present in the disc, about Maiden being an artistically finished band, about Blaze being a shitty vocalist \u2013 your bound to hear thousands of reasons why it sucks. Truth is, it doesn\u2019t suck \u2013 most of these \u2018reasons\u2019 seem to be hastily made inferences on first listen. Some still do stand though \u2013 the production is rather thin and Blaze doesn\u2019t fit in at times and also, some songs tend to drag \u2013 but all around, this is a brilliant, dark effort from Maiden.\n\nOn this release, Maiden drops everything \u2018happy\u2019 about them and heads straight for the dark lands. This release is amazingly morbid, creating a tense, dark atmosphere around it. It IS Maiden, but its Maiden with a schizophrenic twist to make it seem like it isn\u2019t. Chip off everything that\u2019s been added, that is, the dark atmosphere around it and the somewhat priggish song structures and lengths and you get a Maiden album more similar to say 7th Son or Somewhere In Time than a Powerslave or Number Of The Beast. The production sounds thin; it lacks the punch (esp. in the rhythm guitar department) that drives albums like 7th Son and Somewhere In Time. Blaze is overall, a good vocalist. Although he wouldn\u2019t at all suite a classic Maiden number like \u2018Aces High\u2019 or \u2018Hallowed Be Thy Name\u2019, this album is tailored to his voice. He still does sound out-of-place in certain areas but not nearly as often as people point out. Nicko and Steve (check out the bass intro to \u2018Blood Of The World\u2019s Hands\u2019 are solid, as usual. Dave and Gers too do an excellent job carrying out the more intricate structure of this album. You cannot find any fault with the guitar department here, except of course \u2013 that it still lacks the spark of Adrian Smith as Gers despite being a fairly good guitarist looks all but underwhelming in his predecessors shoes. The soloing is very good all through the album.\n\nEvery song on this release has its moments and some of the songs are absolutely spectacular. \u2018Sign Of The Cross\u2019 falls into the latter category, it ranks among Maiden\u2019s best. 11 minutes and not once does it seem to drag. A rather atypical opener for Maiden as it doesn\u2019t even approach the speed of previous openers. The dark, brooding passages here are especially awesome, adding greatly to the character of the album. Check out the awesomeness and courage in the passages from 4:42 to 10:10. Who could ask for a better start to an album than this? \u2018Lord Of The Flies\u2019 is heavier and also an excellent, intricate song with very catchy and yet dark verses and a mind-blowing chorus. \u2018Man On The Edge\u2019 then sounds more like \u2018Be Quick Or Be Dead\u2019\u2013 which instantly implies its another awesome song. The riffing is excellent and Blaze does well on vocals. \u2018Fortunes Of War\u2019 starts off with a brilliant atmospheric intro before launching into a well-done midpaced number. Blaze does seem tired on vocals here, which brings down the song. \u2018Look For The Truth\u2019 is a very memorable track with a great sing-along \u2018oh-oh\u2019 chorus except done in a very dark fashion unlike a \u2018oh-oh-oh\u2019 on 7th Son (song) or \u2018Heaven Can Wait\u2019.\u2019 The Aftermath\u2019 is another excellent dark number about the aftermaths of war. \u2018Judgement Of Heaven\u2019 then is the catchiest song on here with a very memorable chorus tacked onto it. It has especially good soloing in it. \u2018Blood On The World\u2019s Hands\u2019 has a bass-solo intro that lasts for over a minute before it kicks into a decent number with a strange chorus. \u2018The Edge Of Darkness\u2019 has a needless intro that contributes absolutely nothing to the song as a whole. The song though is an excellent one with a variety of tempos and riffs strewn out perfectly. Some excellent soloing and frantic drumming by Nicko is the obvious highlight of the song. \u20182 AM\u2019 is a half-ballad with acoustic pieces interspersed with heavy bits. It is a very memorable song even if it doesn\u2019t achieve anything different. \u2018The Unbeliever\u2019 is the most proggy piece on here and a great way to end the album. Its very bluesy with really great melodies and Blaze performs very well in the song. \n\nThis album is much better than its follow-up Virtual XI where all the dark melodies were removed (in all but a few songs) and a more rock-ish, harmonized direction was taken which wasn\u2019t at all suited to Blaze\u2019s vocals and sounded completely tired out. It takes a while to digest the entire thing as it\u2019s far away from trad. Maiden. This album played a key role in shaping Maiden\u2019s new sound starting from \u2018Brave New World\u2019 where Blaze left and the original band reunited with Gers as an extra-guitarist. This album therefore maintains an important place in the Maiden discography and is still one of the few albums where a change of singers actually worked in favour for the band. In this case, Maiden were dismal with \u2018No Prayer\u2019 and \u2018Fear Of The Dark\u2019 and took a huge step forward with this release.\n",
        "\nWoah, have Maiden hit rock bottom here. This is their most uninspired and random effort ever. This album has a hard rock overtone to it, check out glam rockers like \u2018From Here To Eternity\u2019 or the Bon Jovi-esque \u2018Weekend Warrior\u2019, This isn\u2019t bad, except in Maiden\u2019s case \u2013 it just doesn\u2019t work especially when they can make longer, more well drawn out compositions that far outclass these songs. The album ahs some absolutely amazing songs - actually six of the albums 12 tracks are amazing. These songs are anything better than the best No Prayer could offer. The problem is the remaining\nSix songs. Whereas \u2018No Prayer for the Dying\u2019 had no amazing songs but maintained a level of consistency, this release is heavily polarized. Six of the total songs totally stomp and the rest are absolute swill. \n\nBruce here continues the rasp style developed on \u2018No Prayer\u2019 on a few songs, on others though he adopts Bon Jovi-esque vocals (Weekend Warrior especially), then he also tries some 70\u2019s crooning and the most common style prevalent here is the good old\u2019 Bruce style. The guitars have definitely improved, well in 6 song that is. Dave and Janick\u2019s solos are consistently good throught the album. Steve and Nicko still don\u2019t play much of a part in album proceedings.\n\nThe six songs to be noted are the first three songs and \u2018The Fugitive\u2019, \u2018Judas Be My Guide\u2019 and of course, the title track.\u2018Be Quick Or Be Dead\u2019 starts off the album with a bang \u2013 awesome heavy riffing to be found here. This is undoubtedly Maiden\u2019s best opener and speed song, even better than Aces High! The monstrous riffing is combined with Bruce\u2019s vicious snarling and rasping and with a really great chorus, great sense of melody and nice soloing \u2013 this thing comes off as nothing short of a masterpiece. Then, \u2018From Here To Eternity\u2019 is an 80\u2019s glam-influenced track. Its very singalong and fun, another of the albums highlights. \u2018Afraid To Shoot Strangers\u2019 is a great atmospheric ballad akin to \u2018Children Of The Damned\u2019, Bruce even croons here. \u2018The Fugitive\u2019 is a nice, catchy song with Bruce doing very well on vocals and great memorable riffing to back him up. Then comes \u2018Judas Be My Guide\u2019. It\u2019d take a damn awesome track to beat the opener \u2013 and yes, this is that damn awesome track. Bruce here snarls with passion while Dave and Gers throw out excellent dual-guitars and awesome catchy riffing. The title track is an undisputable classic and holds on well to other Maiden closers. The song starts off with a beautiful pseudo-Latin strum that really does get one kicked awake after the snoozefest of \u2018Weekend Warrior\u2019. The lyrics sound delightfully na\u00efve and Bruce perfectly imitates a man\u2019s phobia of the dark on vocals. The riffing here is absolutely magnificent \u2013 very very catchy. The soloing too is excellent. \n\nThe rest of the six tracks are not worth dissecting at all. They\u2019re the songs that Maiden thought of at random just to fill in the album length as they were out of ideas. \u2018Fear Is The Key\u2019 I guess qualifies as the best among the fillers but it too is goddamn awful. Brcue sounds pathetic on vocals although the music is fine but extremely boring. \u2018Wasting Love\u2019 is the worst ballad Maiden have ever done. \u2018Childhood\u2019s End\u2019, \u2018The Aparation\u2019, \u2018Chains Of Misery\u2019 \u2013 heck, all stuff written at random with absolutely no sense of coherency or melody in mind. \u2018Weekend Warrior\u2019 I need not mention, this one is Maiden\u2019s most blatantly commercial song. If this would have been released as a single in place of \u2018Be Quick Or Be Dead\u2019, it would have hit #1 so fast Maiden themselves would be knocked over. The reason is simple, this one has them imitating a Bon Jovi. Check out Bruce \u2013 \u2018just look at youuuu noooow\u2019 \u2013 that\u2019s Bon Jovi, you could almost mistake Bruce for him. \n\nOn the whole, this is Maiden\u2019s worst album. Why they insist on keeping the fillers instead of drafting an EP of killers is beyond me. Its like adding Tabasco sauce to a plum \u2013 the entire thing (in this case, the album) ends up a mediocre mess. Download the six tracks mentioned and avoid the rest as if they were infected, this isn\u2019t even for a die-hard Maiden fan.\n",
        "\nNobody in their wildest dreams expected this after the marvelous 7th Son Of A 7th Son.\nIt is impossible to know what the band was actually aiming for in making such a release.\nThey dropped all the synths, dropped even the Maiden tradition of having a song of long (sic) duration, heck \u2013 they dropped almost everything they developed with NoTB and went for this watered-down pseudo Killers sound. I mention watered-down and pseudo here because frankly, judging by this release \u2013 it seems that the band just doesn\u2019t have the energy to go back and play such stuff again. Another thing\u2019s missing \u2013 ADRIAN SMITH. His immensely cool guitar licks are sorely missed throught this release. Newcomer Janick Gers isn\u2019t exactly a bad guitarist but he isn\u2019t an Adrian Smith. The album sounds quite uninspired (Bruce being the lone exception to this) and the energy and fun of Killers is totally missing. Also several songs sound like needless rehashes of older material and others sound like directionless fillers added in just to increase the album length. Lots of half-baked, sometimes horrendous ideas with even worse execution are to be found on these fillers.\n\nBruce adopts a rasp on the album to try and fit in with its \u2018aggressiveness\u2019. Sometimes, he sounds totally off-place needlessly overdoing the rasp while at other times he sounds energetic, fresh and menacing. The problem here is \u2013 the only one who seems to be \u2018into\u2019 the record is Bruce as he tries a variety of different styles here and always performs with inspiration and energy despite not always hitting the mark. We get the usual excellent soloing that all Maiden albums have but the riffing is totally off-mark and sounds rather odd. Its like they thought of a melody and poured it all over a standard riff instantly without thinking of how bad it actually sounded or the context in which they play it. Nicko doesn\u2019t have much of a role to play here and neither does Steve. The underperformance here definitely shows how much the band actually relies on Adrian.\n\u2018Tailgunner\u2019 starts the album off decently. It sounds like a bastardization of the classic \u2018Aces High\u2019 but I\u2019d pick this any day over a \u2018Run Silent, Run Deep\u2019 or a \u2018Fates Warning\u2019. \u2018Holy Smoke\u2019 is probably the best song on here, its fairly catchy with a nice vocal performance by Bruce (He really hits the right notes here), the soloing is particularly good here. The lyrics of the song are a satire on Bible-bashers and the lyrics contain a rather un-Maidenish line in the form of \u2018Flies around shit, bees around honey\u2019. Its just out of place for a band as honoured and hmmm, dignified as Maiden? Well, can\u2019t explain why I think so. \u2018No Prayer For The Dying\u2019 then sounds rather puny at times and the main melody sounds like a bastardized \u2018Infinite Dreams\u2019. The song itself is fun, they actually sound better when they keep it slow than try oh-so-hard to go thrashing about and failing. The hilariously titled \u2018Public Enema Number One\u2019 is just decent, there\u2019s nothing differing from the album\u2019s norms to be seen here. \u2018Fates Warning\u2019 builds up well but then becomes completely directionless with a nice but totally out of place chorus. \u2018The Assassin\u2019 is actually quite decent \u2013 it\u2019s amazing in that it manages to sound excessively cheesy and somewhat menacing at the same time. The atmosphere around the song is excellent, but Bruce goes on and off \u2013 he sometimes sounds rather vicious and at other times his vocals sound cheesy beyond cheesy. That chorus manages to be cheesy and hypnotically evil at the same time. It\u2019s hard to say what exactly works (or doesn\u2019t) about this song. \u2018Hooks In You\u2019 is a try at an 80\u2019s anthem and although it sounds overtly silly, its decent \u2013 although like the rest of the album, it sounds tired and uninspired. \u2018Bring Your Daughter\u2026To The Slaughter\u2019 is different from the rest of the album (finally), it rules with killer melodies and a killer (pun intended) performance by Bruce who sounds viciously evil and horny at the same time. \u2018Mother Russia\u2019 is possibly the best song on the album although it cannot for a minute compare with the rest of Maiden\u2019s epics. The keyboards are back and Bruce sings normally through the song (he actually shuts up for most part of the song). There isn\u2019t really a problem with the song, its like all of Iron Maiden woke up all of a sudden after playing asleep all the while and say \u2018It\u2019s the end of the album, Golly!\u2019 and throw up whatever remnants of 7th Son they could muster.\n\nAll in all, this is one of Maiden\u2019s worst albums \u2013 although it isn\u2019t quite their worst (the follow-up \u2018Fear Of The Dark\u2019 is). The album is recommended only for die-hard Maiden fans, others can stay content with downloading \u2018Bring Your Daughter\u2026To The Slaughter\u2019, \u2018Holy Smoke\u2019 and maybe \u2018Holy Smoke\u2019, \u2018Tailgunner\u2019 and the title track. The rest of the album should be left to the dogs.\n",
        "\nThis is and still remains the only album to which I'd graduate a 100%. When I first heard 7th Son, I was floored by the excellence shown here. This release stands above all; it is the pinnacle of music itself. Yes, it is a concept album \u2013 although the concept is rather loosely connected. The release itself is what \u2018Somewhere In Time\u2019 could have been if you removed the accessible overtone and the cheesiness and toughened the entire thing up. In short, this album is where all loose ends in Maiden\u2019s style were addressed \u2013 this is the perfection that Maiden were always hinting at.\n\nThe entire band delivers their best performances together on here. The synths have been pushed a bit to the background here unlike Somewhere In Time where it was in the fore. Here synths are used for atmospheric purposes. Dave and Adrian really deliver excellent solos on \u2018Moonchild\u2019 or \u2018Infinite Dreams\u2019. The solos are amazing to the core, they are very expressive and atmospheric \u2013 despite the title track having a five minute plus instrumental passage, there\u2019s absolutely no overdone soloing here unlike the several prog bands out there beating away at their instruments without making much sense. Bruce is absolutely amazing on \u2018Infinite Dreams\u2019 and delivers outstanding performances on the rest of the album as well, truly sounding desperate on \u2018The Clairvoyant\u2019 or determined and defiant on \u2018Can I Play With Madness\u2019 or vengeful on \u2018Only The Good Die Young\u2019. He delivers a variety of emotions coinciding with the concept all through the album. Nicko does his best job so far on drums, providing excellent backing to the guitars. Harris does a great job on bass here (esp. on the intro of The Calirvoyant) and played a key role in the writing of this album. \n\n\u2018Moonchild\u2019 starts off the album excellently. This I believe is a commentary of Lucifer on the birth of the prophet. It starts off with a soft acoustic intro which repeats itself at the end of the album. Right away, one is floored by the atmosphere, the pure emotion and the musical value shown here. \u2018Infinite Dreams\u2019 is undoubtedly the best ballad ever. Bruce delivers an excellent performance mirroring the insecurity and desperation of the prophet at this stage. Some mind-blowing guitar too to be found on this track. \u2018Can I Play With Madness\u2019 is a rather controversial one. People generally hate it because it was a hit. Not every hit sucks and Maiden have sufficiently proved that with a string of hits such as \u2018Stranger In A Strange Land\u2019 and \u2018The Number Of The Beast\u2019. Also, the song is goddamned catchy with an up-beat defiant and altogether stunning vocal performance by Bruce. Its bluesy solo is just 3 seconds long and still manages to rule. As such, people who call it \u2018Can I Play with Shittiness\u2019 are nothing but retards of the worst order. \u2018The Evil That Men Do\u2019 is probably Maiden\u2019s catchiest song ever, it totally stomps over with an amazing vocal performance by Bruce and an anthemic pre-chorus and overwhelmingly excellent chorus along with that excellent, expressive solo thrown in midway. It deserves its place of recognition among Maiden fans. The title track follows and is the longest track on the album with a massive 5 minute plus instrumental passage thrown in. The entire thing bleeds atmosphere and artistic expression. This one qualifies as Maiden\u2019s best title track, even better than \u2018Fear Of The Dark\u2019 and \u2018Powerslave\u2019 which is an amazing feat. No overkill on soloing in the five minute passage either, this is one of those qualities which makes a band like Maiden so damned great. \u2018The Prophecy\u2019 starts off with an amazing intro and an excellent rather off-beat riff follows it. The most noticeable thing here is Bruce\u2019s vocal performance, which is nearly paranoid. The fadeout close too is awesome. Then, we get to \u2018The Clairvoyant\u2019 which ahs an amazing bass intro. Bruce really gives an amazing vocal performance here mirroring the desperation of the Prophet at the time. The solo too is damned amazing. The lyrics are powerful, very powerful. The atmosphere around the thing and the aforementioned factors make this a strong contender for the best song on this album (which is a bloody tough feat). Who can deny the amazing lyrical quality of lines like \u2013 \u2018There\u2019s a time to live, and a time to die. A time to meet the maker. There\u2019s a time to live, but isn\u2019t it strange? As soon as you\u2019re born \u2013 you\u2019re dying!\u2019 or \u2018But for all his power, couldn\u2019t forsee his own demise!\u2019. Excellent stuff, the stuff that separates Maiden from the rest of the other legendary metal bands out there and puts them at the top. \u2018Only The Good Die Young\u2019 is an addictive end to the album. The chorus is absolutely legendary in its excellence. The lyrics here are vengeful and excellent. Excellent lines like \u2013 \u2018Only the good die young \u2013 all the evil seems to live forever\u2019 are littered through the thing. Bruce delivers an excellent vocal performance here. The soloing and melodies here too, are very tasteful. The song closes with a frenzy of guitaring and drumming while the album closes with the acoustic passage that began it. And thus ends, metals best album ever.\n\nOn the whole, really what can be said? The thing has to be heard for it to be believed. The scope of the thing is immense and the entire album just bleeds atmosphere in its purest form. Never have I heard any album so tasteful, so atmospheric, with such emotion as is tailored to the concept, with such expressive guitars\u2026.with such perfection. Maiden have accomplished something that is an impossible feat for the rest. This is the best metal album ever and in all probability, it cannot be surpassed. How unfortunate that after this pinnacle Maiden was to discontinue this sound and change their style to a bland, watered down Killers style on \u2018No Prayer For The Dying\u2019. But then again, after the peak \u2013 there remain only slopes. Maiden, sadly slid down the slope rather fast!\n",
        "\nThis is perhaps Maiden\u2019s most accessible and melodic album. The introduction of guitar synthesizers obviously plays a major part in this. Yet one is hard pressed to find fault with it as the material on here is strong. It isn\u2019t quite composed of material with the likes of say a \u2018Powerslave\u2019 or \u2018Seventh Son\u2019 but its still damn excellent. Also, the production on here is the best I\u2019ve heard from all of their releases. The clarity of the sound is amazing and the synthesizers sound excellent in the fore. The sound on this album would only reach its pinnacle in following release (and in my opinion, the best metal release ever) 7th Son Of A 7th Son. This album too, like Powerslave would prove to be a major influence on Power Metal.\n\nDave and Adrian deliver some of their best riffs and solos here. The guitars have definetly taken a turn for more melodic regions. The synthesizers allow them to explore some new territory and they use the synthesizer rather tastefully without going on overdrive with it. Some of Maiden\u2019s best solos are in \u2018Caught Somewhere in Time\u2019 and Adrian gives us an absolutely godly solo (only next to his own \u2018Hallowed Be Thy Name\u2019) on \u2018Stranger In A Strange Land\u2019. Bruce gives an excellent vocal performance, perhaps even his best vocal performance on any album is here. Lots of double-layered choruses are seen on the album. Steve doesn\u2019t quite play as much of a part on this album as Maiden have gone in a more melodic direction but his contributions to songwriting and basslines are still valuable. He doesn\u2019t quite write as many songs either as this album is dominated by Adrian\u2019s tracks. Nicko performance here is more relaxed as the album has taken a more melodic direction and he does the job well.\n\n\u2018Caught Somewhere In Time\u2019 starts the album off with an excellent synthesized melody and is the best song on the album. It\u2019s the fastest, least melodic song on the album and the best part of it is the solos. The solos midway through the song are absolutely godly, some of Maiden\u2019s best solos are here. The song\u2019s written solely by Steve \u2018Wasted Years\u2019 then has fine lyrics and an excellent sing-along chorus coupled with extremely catchy riffs and melodies. \u2018Sea Of Madness\u2019 has a more prominent bass and an exceptional sad chorus. \u2018Heaven Can Wait\u2019 starts off very well but the verse sound too hurried for my liking, Bruce doesn\u2019t quite sound good when he sings so fast. The chorus too sounds nauseating \u2013 \u2018Heaven can waaaa-aaaitt\u2019, too stretched, doesn\u2019t work at all. The song gets better as it goes with an exceptional \u2018oh-oh-oh\u2019 (this one is attempted oh-so-much by other bands who sound pathetic at every attempt) sing-along section mid-way and excellent soloing that redeems the song. \u2018The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner\u2019 has an excellent build-up. Bruce does an excellent job on vocals (especially on the chorus) with a triumphant gallop backing him. The solos once again rule. \u2018Stranger In A Strange Land\u2019 is one of Maiden\u2019s best, very very catchy riffing and an outstanding vocal performance with a godly solo from Adrian adding to its strength. \u2018D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\u2019 then is a rather forgotten song. This remains one of Maiden\u2019s catchiest song, which can be attributed to its excellent use of double-layered vocals and the absolutely awesome twin-guitar melodies. Then, \u2018Alexander The Great\u2019 isn\u2019t as strong as Maiden\u2019s other closers but is still excellent. The song builds up excellently, very very epic intro here. The song itself is excellent with brilliant soloing although the chorus is admittedly rather boring. A fine way to end an excellent album.\n\nAll in all, this album can be considered as the turning point in Maiden\u2019s discography which lead to metal and Maiden\u2019s pinnacle \u2013 7th son of a 7th son. This album merges epic with accessible to create a raging beast of an album. Well worth the buy unless you have an allergy to synths. The cover art too, absolutely rules. The detailed drawing bears many a secret one would be hard-pressed to find without the help of a FAQ.\n",
        "\nAh, this is truly where Maiden got their act together and put out a blast of an album. It is only behind 7th son and that truly isn\u2019t a fact to be ashamed of \u2013 as every metal release itself is behind 7th son! The album also has great variety, ranging from breakneck speed metal in the form of Aces High to the more mature, pseudo Egyptian atmosphere of \u2018Powerslave\u2019 and \u2018Losfer Words\u2019. The album contains what is Maiden\u2019s last instrumental (as for now) in the form of \u2018Losfer Words\u2019.\n\nThere isn\u2019t quite any weak track on the album. All the album members have now actively involved themselves in songwriting, which has brought about the best in Maiden. The riffing here is tight, inspired and would prove to be a great influence on the power metal scene. The soloing still is top-notch. The interesting thing about Maiden is, they\u2019re mainly a riff-based band. Despite having a 13 minute long track on the album, neither Dave nor Adrian perform any extended soloing in it. Bruce too is absolutely impeccable here with amazing vocal performances on \u2018Aces High\u2019, \u20182 Minutes To Midnight\u2019 and \u2018The Rime Of The Ancient Mariner\u2019. Nicko too gets better with every single release, providing fine backing to the band and going for the neck on \u2018Aces High\u2019. Steve plays a mjor part in carrying forward songs like \u2018Powerslave\u2019 (with that excellent but short bass solo) and \u2018The Rime Of The Ancient Mariner\u2019.\n\n\u2018Aces High\u2019 is speed metal with excellent riffing and great vocals and drumming. \u2018Two Minutes To Midnight\u2019 contains that excellent intro riff which is more or less omnipotent in metal \u2013 as of now its shown up in Mercyful Fate, Accept, David Bowie (!), Grave Digger, Hellhammer, Scanner and a heck-lot of artists who if I was to mention would occupy the entire review. Of all these artists, I can safely say only Maiden bring out its luster completely. What else is noticeable about the song is Bruce\u2019s biting vocal performance and the excellent chorus. \u2018Losfer Words\u2019 as has been said, is probably Maiden\u2019s last instrumental and it works in a somewhat Egyptian way. Some excellent melodies to be heard here. \u2018Flash Of The Blade\u2019 is a forgotten classic from the album, its insatiably catchy with excellent riffing and soloing. \u2018The Duellists\u2019 is another fine track with a seemingly endless instrument only passage in it. \u2018Back In The Village\u2019 is another lost classic with an excellent vocal performance and chorus and a stalwart solo. It\u2019s a worthy follow-up to \u2018The Prisoner\u2019 from NoTB. \u2018Powerslave\u2019 is one of Maiden\u2019s best, with heavy pseudo-Egyptian riffing. Steve\u2019s bass lines play a great part in driving the song, with him playing a near bass solo in the song. Bruce\u2019s voice contains a venomous biting edge here. \u2018The Rime Of The Ancient Mariner\u2019 then is another classic and would easily show up in a Top 5 Maiden list. Its 13 minutes long making it Maiden\u2019s longest song and is based on the epic poem by Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Not surprisingly, the poem was written under the influence of Marijuana (as Bruce would recount later). Bruce, Nicko, Steve, Dave and Adrian all deliver an absolutely outstanding pefromance here. Never once does this song seem overlong (unlike the thousand prog \u2018epics\u2019 out there) and never once does the band seem underwhelming or struggling to keep up with each other here. A remarkable feat indeed.\n\nOn the whole, the album is a culmination of all the maturation seen in the previous releases. This release could be marked as the release where power metal actually began as some of the songs here show elements that influenced the genre most. All in all, a very worthy buy \u2013 and one every metal fan would like.\n",
        "\n\u2018Piece Of Mind\u2019 isn\u2019t quite as good as its predecessor \u2018Number Of The Beast\u2019. On this one, the band takes a more melodic and yet more mature direction. This release is where Iron Maiden true sound actually begun. The album isn\u2019t quite as consistent as the previous one, it has some slightly underwhelming songs for Maiden\u2019s style which is what actually prevents it from getting a higher rating. Still, this is undoubtedly a damned good album. The variety on the album is outstanding, there are proggy numbers, (\u2018Revelations\u2019, \u2018Flight Of The Icarus\u2019, \u2018To Tame A Land\u2019), speed metal (\u2018Where Eagles Dare\u2019 and to a lesser extent \u2018The Trooper\u2019) and shorter, more melodic numbers (\u2018Still Life\u2019, \u2018Die With Your Boots On\u2019, \u2018Quest For Fire\u2019, \u2018Sun And Steel\u2019).\n\nBruce delivers some of his best performances on some of the songs here \u2013 just check out his outstanding performances on \u2018Revelations\u2019 or \u2018Where Eagles Dare\u2019 or \u2018Flight Of Icarus\u2019. This I guess, is because the band as it progresses is getting more and more adaptive to Dickinson\u2019s more operatic style. Dave and Adrian provide more melodic riffing this time around. The soloing here is totally ace \u2013 the solos on \u2018Die With Your Boots On\u2019, \u2018Flight Of The Icarus\u2019, \u2018Revelations\u2019 and \u2018The Trooper\u2019 rank among Maiden\u2019s best. Steve does a great job on bass, his bass is the driving force for \u2018To Tame A Land\u2019 where he provides mesmerizing, trace-like pseudo-Egyptian bass which proves to be the backbone of the song. Nicko does a good job here although he isn\u2019t quite as prolific as Clive. \n\n\u2018Where Eagles Dare\u2019 starts off with a burst of pure speed metal. Its based on Alistair Maclean\u2019s excellent novel of the same title. \u2018Revelations\u2019 is a half-ballad with excellent, murky Sabbath-style riffing and stands only next to \u2018Infinite Dreams\u2019 in the list of Maiden\u2019s best ballads. Also to be noted here is the awesome solo. \u2018Flight Of The Icarus\u2019 is regarded as a Maiden classic and rightfully so. It\u2019s slower with an excellent vocal performance by Bruce (Dio\u2019s influence on Bruce is clearly visible on this one) and excellent soloing by Adrian and Dave. \u2018Die With Your Boots On\u2019 is a melodic, hard-rockish number (the title\u2019s origin isn\u2019t clear at all). It\u2019s one of Maiden\u2019s catchiest and has a heck of a solo and chorus. \u2018The Trooper\u2019 is another short, speedy number. Although some of its char has certainly been lost by overplay, this one still does rule. \u2018Still Life\u2019 is a rather haunting song, Bruce keeps up with the tense atmosphere. It\u2019s good but not quite up to Maiden\u2019s standards, a rather underwhelming number for Maiden. \u2018Quest For Fire\u2019 and \u2018Sun And Steel\u2019 aren\u2019t amazing either, although they\u2019re in no way bad \u2013 they\u2019re both very catchy with excellent choruses. Of course, all this is made up for by the last track \u2013 \u2018To Tame A Land\u2019. Based on the frankly amazing (pun intended) Dune, this one qualifies as one of Maiden\u2019s best ever. The mesmerizing bass along with the murky Sabbath riffing is the driving force of the song. The song reflects the desert atmosphere of Arrakis (for those who haven\u2019t read Dune, read it fools!) and pays tribute to the legendary book quite well. The song feels builds up a trance-like atmosphere excellently and finishes in a truly hypnotic fashion.\n\nThe maturity of the band is clearly seen in this release and it is recommended for Maiden fans and true metal fans alike. Although some might find the \u2018lack of heaviness\u2019 here a turn-off factor, it does make up with its more epic, mature songwriting and deserves its place of recognition in the metal universe.\n",
        "\nIn 1982, Maiden raked up an album which caused quite a bout of controversy and caused quite a stir in the metal scene as well. Paul Di\u2019Annio went out the door and in came the superior Bruce Dickinson. Perhaps as a result of adaption to Bruce\u2019s vocal style, Maiden softened their style, rooted out the punk and went forward to a more epic style. The residual effects of this change can be seen on this album. There are many moments and tracks which scream \u2018Killers!\u2019 (although with the punk elements out) here which is what makes it a sort of a bridge between early Maiden and later Maiden. This album was what really broke Maiden into the mainstream.\n\nBruce Dickinson is a much more capable replacement to Paul Di\u2019Annio. With Bruce\u2019s operatic style, Iron Maiden truly found its niche. Bruce had more range, power and emotion than Paul (there are few singers with as much emotive power as Bruce) and his talent spoke for itself, quickly erasing any doubt from people\u2019s minds that Maiden had perished. Steve still shines on the bass-rich production which as I mentioned earlier, acts more as a boon than a bane to Maiden. Dave Murray and Adrian provide another solid job on guitars here, pulling off some of Maiden\u2019s best solos ever in Hallowed Be Thy Name (which has Maiden\u2019s best solo and is incidentally their best song as well), Number Of The Beast and The Prisoner. Clive Burr still hasn\u2019t missed a beat although this would sadly be his last album with Maiden before he faded into obscurity. \n\nA few weak-spots prevent this album from receiving a 99 or a 100. And these are Run To The Hills and Invaders. Both are nice and fun (esp. Run To The Hills) but lack the spark and the freshness of the rest of the album. Perhaps this is because these songs seem more like residue left off from Killers and don\u2019t work at all when slapped on a more mature release like Number Of The Beast. Also bonus track \u2018Total Eclipse\u2019 was rightfully rejected, it doesn\u2019t at all keep up with the standards set by the rest of the album.\n\nThe rest of the songs though, are some of the best if not the best of Maiden\u2019s catalogue. \u2018Children of the Damned\u2019 is a haunting ballad on the movie of the same name, Bruce really rips on vocals here. The song builds up from a slow starts and finishes off with a majestic fashion with an adrenaline-pumping twin lead and a distinct wail from Bruce. \u2018The Prisoner\u2019 is another up-beat, catchy number with excellent soloing showing up mid-way. \u201922 Acacia Avenue\u2019 is the follow-up to \u2018Charlotte the Harlot\u2019. The song though is absolutely nothing like the Charlotte. I disagree with claims from many that it drags, in fact the length is just right. The soloing and riffing are top notch and Bruce delivers another performance for the ages here. Also, this song contains what maybe metal\u2019s first bass solo at 5:57 (actually it\u2019s a bass-guitar dual lead). The title track follows and is probably the catchiest song here. This song was in many ways flag-song of metla in the 80\u2019s and especially raised the hairs of a few fanatical Christian groups with its supposedly Satanic lyrical content. \u2018Gangland\u2019 then follows and sounds like another song that could have been placed in Killers. Its probably the fastest song on here and the twin-lead midway is excellent. Next is \u2018Hallowed Be Thy Name\u2019 which is undoubtedly Maiden\u2019s best and metal\u2019s best song. The atmosphere around the song is immense and foreboding of the feeling of death lurking within one\u2019s grasp. Maiden sucessfuly render the insecurities of a prisoner before his execution and his subsequent resignation to his fate. Bruce gives an unmatchable vocal performance while the guitar themselves play a riff laced with most exquisite melody and aptly mid-paced tempo (the way its menat to be, Maiden ruins it when they speed it up live), Burr expertly co-ordinates with the rhythm while Steve gives a dirge-feeling to it all. The song passes through various tempo changes and remains excellent throught. One point to note however is the solo section, which has Maiden\u2019s best solos ever. Adrian (who\u2019s part is now being constantly butchered by Janick Gers) and Murray both belt out their best here and the solos also feel amazingly suited to the atmosphere around the song. The lyrics contain some of the best lines ever invented, who can deny the charm of \u2013 \u2018If there\u2019s a god, why\u2019s he let me die?\u2019 or \u2018When you know your time is closer, then you begin to understand that life down there is a strange illusion\u2019?. The entire song is truly an achievement and a song of such depth, emotion and brilliance will in all probability never arise again, even from Maiden!\n\nOn the whole, the album is worth getting \u2013 if only for the last track. This album contains the last traces of the Killers sound and the subsequent release totally sheds any association with the debut or the sophomore release. Although recently the album has come under criticism for being repetitive, these views are all but biased \u2013 there is great variety to be found in the album and it is evident to any listener when he actually listens to it.\n",
        "\nThis album is definitely, as Ultraboris pointed out - a lost classic. It is one of the more obscure Maiden albums today and is hardly spoken of in league with the rest of their catalogue. The songs on here are catchier and at the same time more energetic and aggressive than the debut. The more rock-ish elements have been shelved and the punk influence has seemingly increased. The vibrancy and speed shown here at times was a well-needed catalyst to the thrash revolution. The songwriting is stronger and more varied than the debut \u2013 this can be attributed to the entry of Adrian Smith and exit of Stratton, his contributions can be clearly seen here. \n\nThis album marks the exit of Dennis Stratton from Iron Maiden and Murray brought on the incredible Adrian Smith. This is of course, rather unfortunate \u2013 because some of the bands strongest material showed up here. The production on this album is clearer and heavier than the self titled. This album also marks the beginning of the bass-heavy production Maiden are known for. Paul Di\u2019Annio\u2019s vocals this time become even better. Murray and Adrian together make a very tight pair here, the riffing clearly betrays punk influences and the soloing is tight and tasteful. The guitar section with Adrian\u2019s entry became all the more excellent, which is instantly recognized by the listener. Clive Burr manages to drum along to any rhythm given by the guitars no matter how strange or sudden, Clive truly is a master at the art of drumming. The bass-heavy production also brings Steve\u2019s bass to the fore. This isn\u2019t quite the bane people would attest it to be as Steve is quite adept at handling the instrument. In my opinion, the bass-heavy sound actually gives Maiden part of their distinctive sheen which sets them apart from the rest.\n\nEverything on here is a classic. This is the only Maiden album to feature two instrumental tracks \u2013 The Ides Of March and Genghis Khan. The Ides Of March is an excellent intro to the album with amazing soloing throught it. The riff of course, is taken from Samson\u2019s \u2018Thunderburst\u2019. Genghis Khan is more like a continuation of \u2018Transylvania\u2019 in that its heavy and moves along at breakneck speed, also the distinct melody that would later pop up in \u2018Bring Your Daughter To The Slaughter\u2019 and \u2018Hallowed Be Thy Name\u2019 shows up here in 1:46. \u2018Wrathchild\u2019 is a relentlessly catchy with an irresistible chorus. This song is MADE to be played live. \u2018Murders In The Rue Morgue\u2019, \u2018Another Life\u2019 and \u2018Innocent Exile\u2019 are all faster memorable numbers. \u2018Killers\u2019 is another career highlight from early Maiden, this song changes riffs and tempo fast and manages to sound both maniacal and catchy at the same time. The soloing section here absolutely stomps over everything in sight. Paul Di\u2019Annio especially lets it rip, sounding truly like a homicide-obsessed youth. \n\n\nThen, there is a marked departure from the norms the album has set. \u2018Twilight Zone\u2019 is a more relaxed, incredibly memorable track with an excellent vocal performance by Paul and a superb albeit slightly cheesy chorus. It\u2019d fit very well into an 80\u2019s glam bands catalogue. Maiden have never again attempted to write a track of this kind, which makes this track all the more distinctive. \u2018Prodigal Son\u2019 also follows in the relaxed vein, this is one of Maiden\u2019s best ballads and stands shoulder-to-shoulder with \u2018Remember Tomorrow\u2019 from the self titled. This song is what \u2018Strange World\u2019 from the s/t could have been. \u2018Purgatory\u2019 returns to heavier pastures and its twisted, reckless riffing scream punk. The speed at which the band changes tempo, shifting from a softer segment to a heavier part becomes quite frightening at times. \u2018Drifter\u2019 sums up the entire album during the five minutes it lasts and tops it all off with an insatiable chorus and riff, it truly deserved its place as a setlist staple.\n\nIn conclusion, this album deserves much more recognition (much like its predecessor) than a passing reference during an IM discussion. The influence of the first two IM albums on the metal scene then was immeasurable. The speed and energy shown in these two releases proved to be the most influential in the formation of thrash. Sadly, this was Maiden\u2019s last album with Paul. Although successor Bruce is a talent of far greater propotions, one wonders what would have happened if Maiden had continued with Paul and stuck to this very style. What could be the next genre Maiden would land up in as a result of continued evolution of this style? Thrash? Possibly.\n",
        "\nMany bands tend to slip up on their debut and turn out a rather uninspired affair that stands inferior to the band\u2019s live shows or even their early demos. Others put up a show of mediocrity which is hardly up to potential shown earlier. Iron Maiden fall under that narrow category of bands whose debuts totally stomped over the metal scene at the time of its release and amazingly, the debut still sounds vibrant and fresh today. A variety of reasons play to the underperformance of bands on their debuts \u2013 bad production (Killing Is My Business\u2026And Business Is Good), nauseating vocals (Black Sabbath \u2013 s/t), immature songwriting (Dark Angel \u2013 We Have Arrived), inconsistency (Judas Priest \u2013 Rocka Rolla) and many other comparatively sparse incidents of underperformance. Iron Maiden on the other hand, have rolled out a release here that features a simple but rather effective production with Di Annio providing rough, fitting and at times spectacularly emotive vocals. Maiden\u2019s songwriting has already evolved and matured (for a fine example of this maturity, see \u2018Phantom Of The Opera\u2019). The entire album is very consistent, a rarity indeed for debut albums.\n\nMaiden at this period differed quite a lot from the Maiden that would be seen later on \u2018Piece Of Mind\u2019 (I do not mention \u2018The Number Of The Beast\u2019 as I regard it as the bridge between the two styles). This Maiden has a rockish swagger to it and some influences of punk can also be traced here. Overall, the material on here with the exception of \u2018The Phantom of the Opera\u2019 (which blends well with later Maiden) is shorter, faster and overall much more energetic than the Maiden seen later. The loosely connected structure and heavy, reckless riffing here and on successor \u2018Killers\u2019 would act as a base for none other than thrash which would emerge a year and a half later. As such, Maiden can be seen as being the band that laid down the blueprint for thrash with their debut and sophomore releases.\n\nDennis Stratton acts as a competent predecessor to superior Adrian Smith who would arrive on sophomore release \u2018Killers\u2019. The absence of guitarist Adrian Smith here is not quite as instantly revealing as on releases after Adrian\u2019s departure from Maiden after \u2018Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\u2019. Dave Murray is as usual solid. Paul Di Annio as has been said earlier provides rougher vocals which give the band a somewhat biting nihilistic edge. Clive Burr is in my opinion the best drummer ever and he turns in a performance for the ages here \u2013 it deserves the reverence of drummers worldwide. Steve is excellent on bass; he probably is metal\u2019s first bass guitar hero. \n\nThe tracks to be noted here, are opener \u2018Prowler\u2019 with its punkish riffing and reckless attitude. \u2018Remember Tomorrow\u2019 also deserves a mention (a half-ballad) for its ultra-emotive vocal performance by Paul. \u2018Transylvania\u2019 is ahead of its time in terms of speed and aggression. \u2018Phantom of the Opera\u2019 is a career highlight of Maiden; it merges the general style to be found on this album with the epic sound that was to follow later. It throws in tons of varied riffs and solos (Dave Murray and Stratton blaze through the track with supreme efficiency and all at breakneck speed while Clive backs them up superbly on drums) all through its length and still stays catchy-as-heck despite the odd-turns taken at many points. \u2018Iron Maiden\u2019 deserves a mention for its relentless ferocity (\u201cIron Maiden\u2019s gonna get ya!\u201d) and unbelievable catchiness, it truly deserves the title it bears. \n\nThe rest of the stuff isn\u2019t quite as awesome as the first and is more streamlined with the rest of the NWOBHM movement but they still manage to be very good rockers. \u2018Running Free\u2019 was Maiden\u2019s first single and met with a fair amount of success \u2013 undoubtedly due to its more commercial leanings. Still it is very catchy and also manages to throw a rather heavy (for its time) break mid-length. \u2018Strange World\u2019 is a complete ballad unlike \u2018Remember Tomorrow\u2019. It is a rather serene track although it tends to drag a bit as it maintains a constant tempo throughout the song length. \u2018Charlotte The Harlot\u2019 is a standard rockish NWOBHM number with a memorable chorus. The bonus track, \u2018Sanctuary\u2019 has one awesome ultra-catchy riff before it descends into mediocrity.\n\nOn the whole, the album is an evolutionary milestone for metal and undoubtedly one of the best all-time debuts. This is early heavy metal even a punk fan can enjoy and it definitely deserves more recognition than is being accorded to it at the moment.\n",
        "\nWhile on tour supporting their powerful and innovative album \"Powerslave\", Maiden compiled this, their first full length concert offering on CD. The song selection on here is excellent, though obviously their second album \"Killers\" has been neglected for more audience friendly material. But bear in mind, I have the original release which does not contain the Hammersmith Odeon concert the year before, which I am told is superior to the latter performance and features WrathChild from Killers.\n\nOverall, the performance on this CD is quite good. We kick off the concert with a speech from World War 2 given by Winston Churchill, a perfect introduction to \"Aces High\", which features some excellent guitar work. \"Two Minutes to Midnight\" and \"Powerslave\" are also featured from the latest album at this point are also well done, the latter featuring some interesting variations on the eastern theme that dominates it and a good vocal performance. \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\" is also featured on this tour, but unfortunately it's a bit overlong of a track for a live performance and slows down the pace of the show.\n\nFrom the \"Piece of Mind\" album, \"The Trooper\" wins the contest for best live song. The energy present on this composition is undeniable, and Maiden do well to recapture it. \"Flight of Icarus\" also shines, though Bruce's vocal performance is a bit weak here. \"Revelations\" was somewhat of a weak track on the studio album, and here it is missing many of the over-dubbed lead tracks, making it worthy of hitting the skip button.\n\n\"The Number of the Beast\" material is probably the weakest on here. Bruce can't hit the high notes the night of this concert the way he did on the original studio versions, and it drags down the enjoyment of \"Run to the Hills\" and the title track. \"Hallowed be thy Name\" proves to be a saving grace from this group, as it requires less singing by Bruce and more instrumental work, and overall does not push the limits of his range.\n\nThe 2 songs off the debut are the best on here. \"Iron Maiden\" has all the usual treats of a memorable main riff and a straight forward vocal line, pretty tough to screw up. And the extended version of \"Running Free\" is the highlight of the album, allowing Bruce to keep to his medium high range, and jazzing up the audience in a memorable sing along session.\n\nIn conclusion, this is a live album that does what many live albums that are not touched up in the studio afterward can often do, sound too rough for recorded material. When you are at the concert, this isn't noticed as the imperfections in sound are covered with the visuals of the show itself. It is strong at the beginning and at the end, but in between it lags much. Bruce's voice fails to hit many of the obligatory high notes called for in these songs, and this makes it difficult to listen to at times. When you take into consideration that it is a live album that is not enhanced, it passes as good, but even so Maiden has pulled off lives shows better than this one.\n",
        "\nI always get nervous before hearing a new album from a band I like. So many questions arise: Will it be good? Will it be something original? Will it get old? Well, after hearing Iron Maiden's new album, I can finally exhale. I've been awaiting the release of \"A Matter Of Life And Death\" since it was announced, and after many listens, it's safe to say this is defiantly one of Maiden's best releases. \"A Matter Of Life And Death\" is one of the most exhilarating albums of Maiden's legacy and is bound to become another classic album in their discography.\n\nJust like all of Maiden's post millennia material, \"A Matter Of Life And Death\" continues to exercise the progressive influences that began with \"Brave New World.\" Just about every song on this album contains a good amount of progression along side the typical speedy Maiden style. \"The Reincarnation Of Benjamin Breeg\" is solid proof of how the progressive influences mix with the standard heavy metal tone. This is mainly shown from the soft intro and the fast paced instrumental section. Tracks like \"Out Of The Shadows\" and \"The Legacy\" opt toward a more progressive driven sound because of the solos, keyboards, and the common presence of acoustic guitars. Aside from the progressive surroundings, some tracks on this album lean toward the heavy metal side of Maiden's influences rather then the progressive elements. \"Different World\" and \"The Pilgrim\" are the best examples of how some songs on \"A Matter Of Life And Death\" are accompanied by a more heavy metal driven sound due to their faster riffs and shorten time lengths. These songs still manage to remain progressive, but the faster musicianship and short time lengths are dominant on these tracks.\n\nDave Murray, Adrian Smith and Janick Gers put on a damn good guitar show. \"These Colours Don't Run\" is a great example of how this brilliant trio plays traditional heavy metal riffs that have hints of melody and sound quite similar to post millennia material. The guitars take a different path on \"Brighter Than A Thousand Suns\" with the darker tone and faster riffs, and I swear that's a thrash riff on \"Lord Of Light!\"\n\n\u201cA Matter Of Life And Death\u201d has Bruce Dickinson doing what he does best, which is singing his guts out. After all those years in Maiden and his solo project, Bruce is still able to have a voice that doesn't sound scratchy or weak. Bruce has some really great singing moments during most of the songs. During \u201cBrighter Than A Thousand Suns,\u201d Bruce bellows out the chorus with his signature high notes and steals the show from the rest of his bandmates.\u201dOut Of The Shadows\u201d has Bruce blending his mellow vocals with an acoustic guitar that makes a beautiful sound to the listener\u2019s ears. There is also a bit experimenting with the vocals. During the chorus of \u201cDifferent World,\u201d there is an added backing vocal that makes the song seem more memorable, but it\u2019s also something different. \u201cThe Legacy\u201d also features a strange vocal effect on Bruce\u2019s voice that makes it sound a bit faint, but it fits the mood of the song perfectly.\n\nWhen being compared to previous albums, the lyrical themes on \"A Matter Of Life And Death\" are darker and more controversial. A good portion of the lyrics are built around war, but there is a topic that Maiden haven't really touched on before: religion connecting to violence. \"Brighter Than A Thousand Suns\" and \"For The Greater Good Of God\" deal with war that was caused by religion. One lyric that really stand out to me is the stanza \"Whatever would Albert have said to his god about how he made war with the sun. E=Mc^2 you can relate how we make god with our hand's\" from \"Brighter Then A Thousand Suns.\" This is an extremely intelligent lyric because it relates with the E=Mc^2 (energy = mass times the speed of light squared) theory and how it was used to make nuclear weapons and how the term \"God\" could be used as a weapon. The lyrics on this album are some of the best these guys have ever wrote.\n\nI was completely blown away with \"A Matter Of Life And Death.\" Call me crazy, but I think this is their best album in a long time; dare I say since \"Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son?\" Out of the three Iron Maiden albums released since Bruce Dickinson and Adrian Smith came back into the band, \"A Matter Of Life And Death\" is defiantly the best one. If you enjoy metal in general, I highly recommend you get this. \n\nThis review was orginally written for: www.Thrashpit.com\n",
        "\nMaiden meticulously triumph once again with another magnum opus of majesty and might for the greater good of All That Is. This band of brothers fly the flag of freedom assuring that these colours don't run to the hilt. The divine dichotomy denotes that the meaning of life is a matter of death. With an incandescent fervor, brighter than a thousand suns, the legacy lives on. Presently, Mankind may dwell in a different world; but, from our noble birth - out of the shadows - unto our death, when we embrace the lord of light - faith endures and the eternal spirit within us all thrives, so that the pilgrim may flower and flourish.\n\nThe revolution for the fourteenth Maiden killer studio classic commences with the cry of \"Eddie\" as my speakers resound the wicker manish melody of a Different World. As Maiden explore the matter of life and death, they act as observers and spectators over a world violently spinning out of control. Concepts concerning war and religion are rife. 'Harry' has returned to his heavier, more pronounced and prominent bass signature. Adrian and Davey re-muster the galloping, gallant guitar riffage, just as Janick continues with his progressive seventies rock restive. The brigand Bruce bruits his alchemical invasion with even more discursive exploration of gnostic nocturnes. Meanwhile, Nicko audaciously hammers his heartbeat into perdition. Kevin surely knows how to produce a Maiden masterpiece.\n\nYes, war is a reality, as the album artwork intimates and vividly portrays this scenario of crucial conflict. Bruce himself has witnessed the horror epic firsthand. He has seen the grisly barbarism and carnality; yet he is also amazed by Mankind's ability to rise above catastrophic consequence, and thereby prosper. Bruce, born in '58 grew up in the cold war era, when the threat of nuclear attack was imminent. Nowadays, we are forced to be faced with impending terrorism. Bruce delves into these dutiful probabilities on tracks like Brighter Than A Thousand Suns which alludes to the Manhatten Project - a rush to become like God in favor of nuclear technology: \"Out of the universe, a strange love is born, unholy union - trinity reformed...acid veils of love and hate - chain letters of Satan... cold fusion and fury..\".\n\nHomage is also demonstrated diligently as Maiden honour the war heroes of the D-day Normandy invasion. This is a musical 'Saving Private Ryan' rendition with realistic battle banter felt through Buce's vocal cadence and Mr. McBrain's machine gun drumming. The Longest Day deals with eyewitness accounts told from the perspective of 18 year old men who are willing to die for their cause: \"...to turn men from flesh and blood to steel; from paper soldiers to boats on the beach...\". With the bellicose covenant of confidence on These Colours Don't Run, Bruce illustrates the warheart patriot ready and willing to die for his flag and country. For him morality is non-negotiable, everyone is a hero as this song is told from the soldiers personal perspective. \n\nSteve Harris has always had infinite, wild dreams of mirrors, mystery, and miracles when viewing the brave new world and celebrating the moribund dance of death. Again spiritual truths are underway for the flight of the navigator sailing the thin line between love and hate. This clairvoyant creatively continues this cautionary tale with the portrayal of the fictive man of mystery in The Reincarnation Of Benjamin Breeg. The Pilgrim is an inward journey juxtaposing Eastern arabesques with alluring antiquities anticipating hermetic causality: \"spirit holy, life eternal, raise me up, take me home - pilgrim sunrise pagan - sunset onward journey begun...\".\n\nWhether it's Bruce begging our pardon for the fallen angel - The Lord Of Light - whom he feels was served a really raw deal; or his fathoming the mysteries of birth where one is absolutely special and king for a day. Songs such as Out Of The Shadows, with it's career solo careening ghost of continuety, clearly elucidate the known fact that amidst cogent controversy, Maiden prevail. The epic closer, The Legacy lingers with concepts of truth which lies in the genesis of accoustic narration fortold through nursery like rhymes and relevant, rampant reverberation. The sonnet solos and strident strumming suggest spontaneous orchestral organization. This grandiose epic serves as the perfect closure for the climactic CD which initiates the listener from the onset with such thought provoking lyrical litanies. \n\nThe stellar standout song which underscores the live, love, and learn mentallity is to be found in the addage 'Ad Maijorem Dei Gloriam' or For The Greater Good Of God. Bruce may ironically sound like Cat Stevens letting the pussy into the cradle of filth and lucre; yet overall his vocal performance is outstanding, as he reaches such octaves as never before attained. The true parousia or second coming for me occured when Bruce rejoined Iron Maiden in 2000. The music of Maiden is so illusive and transcendent, the moral and message is ancient and simply Socratic: \"All that I know with absolute certainty is that I know nothing; so to thy own self be true\". While meditating and meandering through my inner peace of mind, my soul still searches for wisdom like the nomad knowing how to tame a land. \n\nThis is precicesly why I love Iron Maiden and metal is my way of life. There have been no wasted years, only joy. I'm in sanctuary from here to eternity with no fear of the dark or judgement of heaven. I am the journeyman on the edge who endeavours forever and ever to look for the truth; since I'm the educated fool with a future real. I'm the prodigal son purified by my own private purgatory, and I'm the stranger in a strange land ever experiencing deja-vu as a matter of life and death caught somewhere in time, so for now...heaven can wait.\n\nas origianlly posted at www.metalcovenant.com\n",
        "\nFollowing the rather amazing, yet somewhat inconsistent \"Piece of Mind\" album, Maiden offers up yet another studio effort that evolves the standardized formula that began with \"Number of the Beast\". But unlike the rather giant progressive leaps that were taken from their first two albums, the evolution at work here is very gradual.\n\nThis album is structured a bit similarly to \"Piece of Mind\", starting off with a fast track and putting most of the longer winded material towards the end of the album. However, the scope of the songs is much larger, as both Steve Harris and the other composers of this band are broadening their horizons. This can be observed both in the rather long epic \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\", which is loaded with changes, as well as the harmonic progression of such tracks as \"Two minutes to Midnight\" and \"Powerslave\", both of which are musically more complex than what is found on the previous release.\n\nThe guitar work on here has been taken up a notch, as the difference in sound between Adrian and Dave's solos has become a bit more distinct. The dueling solos on \"Powerslave\" and \"Aces High\" give us a good back to back example of this. However, Adrian's highly melodic style is really brought out in the solo of \"Two minutes to midnight\", which is super-imposed over a fairly complex chord progression.\n\nThe basswork on here is also noteworthy, as Steve Harris is never one to be upstaged by the others in the band. His own set of melodic fill ins on \"Powerslave\", as well as his dreary drone during the quiet section of \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\", reveal a character to his playing style that sets him apart from most of the other NWOBHM bassists who were content to merely play the root and do support work only.\n\nBruce's vocals are as riveting as ever, shooting up into the upper stratoshpere at times. His final note on \"Aces High\", as well as a rather nuerotic scream at the end of a development section of \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\" rival the work he did on the two previous albums. In fact, I would argue that this album is his finest work as a vocalist, not to mention that \"Powerslave\" is probably the best song he's ever written for the band.\n\nUnfortunately, just as on Piece of Mind, we have a couple of tracks that don't measure up to the standards that Maiden had already set for themselves on earlier albums. \"Back in the Village\" is not a throw-away song, but I can't really get as excited about it as I did it's lyrical predecessor \"The Prisoner\" (both songs are about the same TV show). \"Losfer Words (Big Orra)\" is probably the weakest instrumental effort Maiden has ever put out, and is probably the reason why they haven't written anymore since. \n\nBut on this album, there are so many good things happening that it makes up for the less than stellar songs. \"The Duelists\" is a bit simplistic considering how long it is, but it's quite catchy and Bruce helps it to shine with his vocal delivery. \"Flash of the Blade\" is a very unusually progressive, yet quite good sounding rocker, kudos to Bruce once again for writing this one. \n\nIn conclusion, this album has some changes in it that make it a bit more exciting than \"Piece of Mind\", yet carries a similar collection of classic Maiden tracks. Songs like \"Aces High\" and \"Two Minutes to Midnight\" rock about as hard as they come, and are probably the most accessable to fans of earlier work of Maiden with Bruce as vocalist. I recommend it highly to any fans of traditional metal, as well as to younger fans who discovered Maiden since 2000 when Bruce re-united with them. This album contains some elements of the style that they carry today, which is reaching out to a whole new generation of Maiden faithful.\n",
        "\nDuring the early 80s Iron Maiden was greeted with a measureable supply of core fans, and simultaneously established their identity with their unique and progressive approach to rock/metal. This album is often given mixed reviews by the Maiden faithful, and often gets passed up in favor of their debut album. While both the first album and this one are loaded with similarities, there are a good number of changes that give this one the edge over it's predecessor.\n\nThe first and most consequential change is the addition of axeman Adrian Smith to the fold. His melodic style is a radically different approach to soloing than the crazy pentatonic shredding that Dave Murray tends more towards, and the result is a competitive spirit to the guitar solo sections that rival the dueling guitars that Judas Priest are known for.\n\nThere is no shortage of great riffs and rapid changes in feel in this album, which is basically a concept album of sorts. \"Wrathchild\" is probably the most well known track off here with it's driving guitar rhythm and Di'Anno's over the top vocal performance, which Bruce struggled to recreate in the early 90s live. \"Murders in the Rue Morgue\" is an up tempo and quasi-punk influenced hommage to the Edgar Allen Poe classic detective story.\n\nSongs that highlight the Maiden emphasis on melody are in full display on here as well. \"Purgatory\" is probably the most catchy song from this era of Maiden, loaded with two guitar harmony lines and other hooks. \"Innocent Exile\" has a memorable theme in the guitar between the verses, although Steve Harris' bassline steals the show at the beginning. \n\nWe are also treated to not 1, but 2 amazing instrumental tracks on this album that adds fuel to an already raging fire. \"Genghis Kahn\" is structured very similarly to Transylvania, but with a highly active drum beat that sounds at times like a military march, and others like a high speed drum solo. \"Ides of March\" is a short prelude that kicks off the album, and has some great lead guitar work.\n\nMore progressive tracks include \"Another Life\", which sounds heavily rock influenced, and has a load of changes in texture and feel. This song is easily recognized by the well placed drum intro in the toms. \"Drifter\" is cut from the same line, but is introduced with an intricant lead guitar riff. The middle solo section reminds me alot of the one found on \"22 Acacia Avenue\". \"Prodigal Son\" is an impressive and quasi-folk sounding acoustic ballad that has electric fill ins that pop in and out of seemingly nowhere. The intro figure in the acoustic guitar is unforgettable. \" \n\nHowever, the most amazing and classic track on this entire album is the riveting title track. This is a song that showcases all the talents that were present at the time. Paul Di'Anno gives the vocal performance of his life, ripping out the high wails and getting down and dirty with his lower range, basically playing the role of a psycho to a tee. Adrian and Dave trade harmonic lines and leads with amazing precision, Harris flies up and down the fretboard of his bass effortlessly and Clive makes one hell of a racket on his kit.\n\nIn conclusion, this album is an underrated classic that deserves more attention. Fans of traditional metal will love this, and even the more intellectual metal head of the progressive vain can find alot to grab onto here. This ranks as my second favorite album by Maiden after \"Somewhere in Time\". I aquired it 10 years ago from a former band mate and it still enjoys regular play in my CD player, and even occasionally influences my own band's compositions.\n",
        "\nIron Maiden\u2019s newest release, A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH, continues in the vein of progressive material that began with Seventh Son, evolved in Brave New World and Dance of Death, and finally culminates in their newest album. Gone are almost all concessions to brevity such as The Wickerman, The Fallen Angel, or Wildest Dreams. This latest outing emphasizes meandering structures, time signature changes, and Maiden\u2019s fondest lyrical tropes: war and social commentary.\n\n\nThe songs are at a much more serene pace than on most previous albums, with the fastest pieces being the shortest: Different World and The Pilgrim. Although each is competently executed in traditional Maiden style, there is little depth to them, either lyrically or musically. The bulk of this album lies in the extended epics like For the Greater Good of God, Brighter Than a Thousand Suns, and The Legacy. Some may complain that the songs are too long for their own good, with far too much time spent on undistorted introes and outroes. However, at least most of the songs do not succumb to Maiden\u2019s classic Achille\u2019s Heel of having far too much chorus repetition. In fact, The Legacy (surely Gers\u2019s finest composition) is written without any chorus at all; its narrative format works fantastically for its exploration of truth and promises.\n\n\nAs is expected in any Maiden album, stunning guitar work abounds. The solos in The Longest Day evoke the roiling seas and the ebb and flow of battle; For the Greater Good of God contains guitar work that is simply sublime; and Lord of Light features what is possibly Maiden\u2019s thrashiest riffing. The bass forms an extremely solid underpinning for the Three Amigos as Steve plays brilliant melodic lines.\n\n\nOn most songs, Bruce sings fantastically; particularly the acoustic-tinged mellow song about birth Out of the Shadows, where he finally sounds completely relaxed with the softer segments and the verses in The Longest Day, in which he builds up an incredible sense of foreboding along with the chugging guitars and thudding drums. Unfortunately, he sounds somewhat out of place and strained on These Colours Don\u2019t Run and Lord of Light, but it\u2019s generally passable and no degradation to his reputation.\n\n\nThe album is not perfect, however, and suffers from several flaws. The most painful is The Longest Day\u2019s chorus: after the incredibly potent imagery conjured up by the verse (\u201call summers long, the drills to build the machine/to turn man from flesh and blood to steel\u201d), Bruce erupts into a painfully silly and out-of-place chorus, nearly destroying the value of the song and creating what is possibly Iron Maiden\u2019s single most anti-climactic moment. These Colours Don\u2019t Run is utterly bland, and it takes several listens just to discover that some of the solos are tolerable. And, of course, the songs are longer than average and slower-paced than average, and the listener who wants a concise, rapid-fire album is better off listening to Number of the Beast or Killers.\n\n\nOverall, this outing is one of Iron Maiden\u2019s absolute best. The progressive elements of their style are in full force, resulting in one of their most unique albums and most powerful. The lyrics are almost universally well-written, the songs have depth in their structure and riffing, and as a whole the album represents a simultaneous return to Maiden\u2019s traditional sound and a shocking evolution of it.\n",
        "\nIron Maiden was at the forefront of the NOWBHM, pumping out some rather intriguing and unusually progressive music considering the subject matter of their album covers. Some thought them a punk rock band because of the image of their original vocalist Paul Di'Anno, despite the fact that he probably has 10 times the vocal range of Johnny Rotten or Joey Ramone. But what made maiden unique was their radically different approach to songwriting and lyrical subject matter that gave them their identity.\n\nThis album is extremely varied both stylistically and technically, which fits with the very fluid nature of the NWOBHM, where there was basically no rules for how to write a song. We have some rather complex songs such as the first chapter of \"Charlotte the Harlot\" and the grandeous epic \"Phantom of the Opera\", which Harris regards as one of his finest works. Where the former has some rather dramatic changes in feel from the main section to the interlude section, the latter sees enough contrast in melody and feel that it sort of qualifies as it's own seven minute opera. Dave Murray gives amazing lead guitar performances on both of these songs.\n\nWe also have some straight forward rockers that will never leave your memory. \"Running Free\" kicks off with an old big band style swing beat and goes off into a hard edged electric guitar riff. \"Prowler\" is extremely catchy, and has some excellent lead riffs that accompany the vocals through out the whole song. \"Iron Maiden\" is another catchy classic with an unforgettable intro riff, underscoring why it still enjoys frequent play at Maiden's live shows after more than 25 years.\n\nMore experimental tracks include the quasi-jazz ballad \"Strange World\", which showcases both Clive Burr's ability to use his set in an atmospheric fashion, as well as Di'Anno's ability to clean up the rough edges of his voice when it's demanded. \"Remember Tomorrow\" is an early example of varying sections of music and creating tension by getting louder during the chorus and quieter during the verse. Steve Harris' lyrics on this one delve into his personal life, and his bass work here is quite active. \n\nSome additional treats on here include the instrumental \"Transylvania\", which lives up to it's name with it's spooky sounding atmosphere and it's catchy main theme. This song is heavily influencial amongst power metal bands who write instrumental works to complement their albums. The re-release of this album includes the bonus track \"Sanctuary\", which sheds some light on why Maiden was sometimes associated with the punk rock scene. This song is a straight forward rocker that is uncharacteristically simple for the band, and does at times sound quasi-punkish.\n\nIn conclusion, although the production of this album is a bit primitive by today's standards, this album is a must have for fans of traditional metal. Power and Progressive metal fans are also encouraged to take a look at this album as it contains elements of both and undoubtedly influenced both genres.\n",
        "\nThis is Maiden's follow up to their highly successful break out album \"Number of the Beast\", and the second album with vocalist Bruce Dickinson. Much like the previous release, there is a good deal of structure to the songs here, in a more basic form than the music found on the 2 albums before Dickinson. And just as on the previous release, we have an issue of an amount of sameness among the tracks that keeps it from being completely amazing.\n\nOne of the problems on this album is that we have way too much mid-tempo rocking, and not enough really fast stuff. \"The Trooper\" takes the cake for the fastest song on here, with one of the most well known main guitar riffs associated with the band, an amazing performance on vocals, and some excellent lead guitar work. \"Where Eagles Dare\" is quasi-fast, and introduces us to the less jazzy drumming style of drummer Nicko McBrain, as this is the first album he is with the band on. The guitar riff is simple and to the point, easily remembered after one listen. \"Die with your boots on\" is a strong track with some amazing guitar work, and a highly memorable chorus.\n\n\"Flight of Icarus\" is a heavier track with yet another catchy chorus, and a very intense final scream courtesy the air-raid siren (Dickinson). \"Revelations\" is an attempt at a more epic song, and although the vocal delivery is top notch and the lyrics are highly thought provoking, the music gets a bit boring and repetitive after the first 3 minutes, this one definately should have been shortened a little. \"Still Life\" is our first example of what would later become a standard quiet intro to an epic track, with a broken power chord line in the bass and rhythm guitar, lead by a gloomy sounding melodic solo. This song is a high point of interest as it is the blue print by which other amazing epics like Seventh Son's \"Infinite Dreams\", Somewhere in Time's \"Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner\", and \"Fear of the Dark\". The lyrics are quite dark, describing a man who looses his mind and drowns himself and his woman in a pool.\n\nUnfortunately, we have two utter throw away tracks on this album. \"Quest for Fire\" has some of the dumbest lyrics I've heard, completely destroying the song, despite the music being pretty hard hitting. It's really sad to because it started off with a decent intro riff. \"Sun and Steel\" is musically boring, and again suffers in the lyrical department. It gallops a bit, Bruce sings about a samurai killing his enemies, and that's pretty much it. (snore) Both of these songs are short so the damage is minimal, and with the invention of the CD, we can skip to better music with the touch of a button.\n\nThe highlight of this album is \"To Tame a Land\", which Steve Harris regards as one of his finest compositions ever. It starts off with a highly atmospheric texture, complete with a beautiful theme in the lead guitar, which has a very distant sound to it. What follows is a very dark and heavy set of riffs and a rough sounding vocal performance, all of which stay fresh and exciting through the entire seven minute plus duration. This song was originally meant to be titled \"Dune\", but the title was changed as they couldn't secure permission from the writer of the story due to contraversy that arose due to some of the lyrics on the previous album. Although the title never materialized, it still remains a great lyrical and musical hommage to the classic Sci-Fi novel.\n\nIn conclusion, this album would have been the greatest if they had ditched the 7th and 8th song and replaced them with one other song similar in structure to \"The Trooper\" or something else that would have been fast enough to give it a run for it's money. It comes highly recommended, but I can't bring myself to say it's their greatest when it contains two of their worst songs ever. But everything else on here is quality material.\n",
        "\nDuring the late 70s to early 80s the NWOBHM was a fairly loosely defined term, applying primarily to bands that had some similarities with the punk rock movement of 1977, but with more musicianship, more energy, and much better singing. Ultimately 2 very different styles would emerge from this movement, the thrash style pioneered by bands like Motorhead, and the more traditional melodic heavy metal by that of Judas Priest and Iron Maiden.\n\nThis album, along with \"Screaming for Vengeance\", represent the most standardized approach to the more melodic, yet still heavy side of the NWOBHM sound (barring that the latter came from a band with roots much earlier). It is a departure from the two previous albums not only in that Paul Di'Anno was replaced with Bruce Dickinson (which was a rather large change) but also that many of the more progressive elements on the past two albums vanished in favor of a much more standardized sound.\n\nThe song structure on this album, as a whole, is a lot more basic. Songs such as \"Invaders\", \"Children of the Damned\", \"The Prisoner\", \"Run to the Hills\", and the title track are all structured like your stereotypical radio friendly metal tune from the 80s. Although they do rock out a good deal harder and have more lyrical depth than most of the 80s mainstream stuff. \"22 Acacia Avenue\" and \"Hallowed be thy name\" have fairly complex changes, the former has a fairly sizable change in feel, while the latter has a ton of varying themes that come in and out. \n\nIf I were to rate this album in terms of individual songs, it would get a 100 easy, but one thing which this album suffers from is a lack of overall variety. Some of the songs have a sameness to them, that is further brought out by the fact that some songs that are next to each other have similar intros. One example is putting two songs with drum intros (Gangland and Run to the Hills) right next to each other.\n\nStand out tracks on this album, ironically, are the ones that are the most radio friendly. \"The Prisoner\" has some great lyrical storytelling and is a good classic hommage to the old TV series (which I saw many reruns of while I was at college). \"Run to the Hills\" highlights one of Bruce Dickinson's greatest vocal performances, along with an unforgettable chorus. The title track has it's fair share of intrigue, particularly a neat little bass riff that follows the climactic guitar solo section.\n\nOne other point of interest is the guitar soloing. Although I have a preference to Adrian Smith's lead playing on most other Maiden releases, on this one Dave Murray has the lion's share of the better solos. His solo on \"Hallowed be thy name\" is much more dramatic sounding than Smith's, and his work on \"Run to the Hills\" is quite excellent.\n\nWithout question, this is an essential part of any metal collection. I can't say it's my favorite album, because other Maiden releases after this one built on the format that this one started and were a bit more intricate. But some of Maiden's best and most well known music is on here. I can recommend this album to all whom appreciate good old fashioned traditional metal.\n",
        "\nHere we are with the follow up to their great debut Iron Maiden; for the second and last time we can hear the screaming voice of Paul Di'Anno, but, differently from the previous one, he is not at his best this time. Despite this, the overall sound of the album is not bad even if, having heard certain tracks of the debut album, some expectations are not met with this one. I cannot exactly state what is not working here: it just seems it is a little flatter than Iron Maiden and not as involving as that was, though it is still good. Also, the heavy rock influence which could be heard on that one is a little less audible here, as their sound is more decisely steering towards heavy metal; well, actually they are defining what heavy metal is.\nAnother positive note is that lyrics are starting to get more serious and smooth along the album: the main themes here are about killers (yes, you could have guessed it), murders and death in general; this last one, particularly, will return in many following albums - Dance of Death and A Matter of Life and Death just to mention some of them.\n\nI don't care much about the brief instrumental opening The Ides of March, which is quite mediocre compared to other instrumental pieces they have done; after that we get right into the album with Wrathchild which, despite being so famous, is a little boring in my opinion. Murders in the Rue Morgue is better and has quite interesting lyrics too, about a typical psychotic killer, which cannot tell if he really killed two girls or not.\n\nThen we get to three 3-minutes tracks: Another Life, Genghis Khan and Innocent Exile.\nAnother Life has very short lyrics and a quite disturbing riff: I don't know exactly what it is and if they wanted it to sound as it actually does, but it has the power to raise some evil thoughts inside you; if you like it or not really depends on your personality and your mood in the moment you listen to it.\nGenghis Kahn is another good instrumental, but I still have to compare it with Transylvania and the latter wins; the following track is Innocent Exile, which passes away without leaving any particular emotion.\n\nWe are now to the title track, Killers, which is the best one on the album: great screaming, nice riffs, interesting lyrics and, mostly important, that irony about death which is so typical of Maiden and I like so much: good work from Paul Di'Anno here; the next is Prodigal Son, the not so good ballad of the album.\nThe following Purgatory raises the pace once more and has a nice melody and powerful riffings, in the style of Aces High, even if not so fast and appealing; Twilight Zone is a bonus track which still goes under some rock influences and Drifter, the last one, is not memorable, too.\n\nConclusion: the follow up to their great debut, still interesting but not as good as that one.\n\nHighlights: Murders in the Rue Morgue, Killers, Purgatory.\n",
        "\nI will write my first review for the first album from Iron Maiden, that is the homonymous Iron Maiden (1980). I don't usually like very much the starting albums because in general they feature a very rough sound (both voice and instruments) and a poor production; however, this is not the case: what a great start! It kicks off with the astounding Prowler, which will make you headbang after a few moments even if it is your first listening: it is at the same time powerful and melodic and immediately put you on the right way for the remaining of the album; we have a great mix here, with good vocals, riffs and a nice production which let you distinguish every single instrument. By the way, the voice here is from Paul I don't like self-commemorative tracks for the latter.Di'Anno, like in the following Killers: I think that he fits perfectly the sound of these early releases, in particular in this one; I wouldn't say that he is better than Bruce Dickinson, nor that he's worse, he is simply different and both are really skilled in what they do.\n\nBack to the album, we now have Sanctuary, which is a typical rock track: I think this is pretty interesting, because it shows you a band making its first steps and trying to emerge from the panorama of that time; this is audible, but not one of my favorites; the same can be said about the following Remember Tomorrow, a quite slow track with some good riff, and the short Running Free, in which the rock influence is remarkable too.\n\nThen we come to what is, in my opinion, the most robust, innovating and headbanging section of the album, composed of the wonderful pair Phantom of the Opera and Transylvania: generally fast pace with some slowdown in the first and astonishing riffs in the second are something many metalheads will surely appreciate. Here we also start to see one of the main features of Iron Maiden, that is their unbelievable skill in the instrumental parts, which I think is one of the main reasons of their success; despite very long riffs and solos without voice you will almost never be bored and you will get right into the sound. Suffice to say that, though I like instrumental pieces, I don't usually rate them very high, except for Iron Maiden's ones: Transylvania is in my selection since a long time and I do not have any intent to remove it from there right now.\n\nThe last three tracks - Strange World, Charlotte the Harlot and Iron Maiden - are not among my favorites, even if the last two became all-time classics; too slow pace in the first, good lyrics but not very involving overall sound in the second and a self-commemorative lyric in the latter make them not memorable.\n\nConclusion: one of the best starting albums I ever heard and an essential classic, not only for the music itself, but for the sound of the period that it represents.\n\nHighlights: Prowler, Phantom of the Opera, Transylvania.\n",
        "\nMany folks thought Iron Maiden fell into the gutter after the departure of Bruce Dickinson. After all, Bruce Dickinson was THE voice of Iron Maiden. Almost every classic Maiden song at this point in time had Bruce behind the mic, and when he left the band, there was almost no hope in Iron Maiden's future. Three had passed since \"Fear Of The Dark,\" and Maiden was back with a new singer and a new album. Not only was \"The X Factor\" Iron Maiden's tenth studio album, it was the beginning of the long and painful road of rejuvenation.\n\nMusically speaking, \"The X Factor\" is a strong step toward the progressive sound that occupies the present day Maiden albums. Many songs on this album, such as \"Fortunes Of War,\" contain a large amount of progressive breaks and have longer song lengths then previous Maiden songs. The most progressive track is \"Sign Of The Cross,\" which is an eleven minute epic filled with soft guitars and progressive breaks. Even though the progressive elements seem good, they also bring down some songs on the album. \"Fortunes Of War\" and \"The Edge Of Darkness\" suffer from long and boring intros. These progressive parts have more positives then negatives, but there are the occasional moments of boredom. Beside the progressive influences, Maiden still has some songs that resemble the classic heavy metal driven tone. \"Lord Of The Flies\" and \"Man On The Edge\" are fast paced anthems that remind me of early 80's material. The riffs and drumming on these tunes, especially \"Man Of The Edge,\" are way faster then anything else on \"The X Factor.\"\n\n\"The X Factor\" also has Maiden experimenting a bit with instruments. \"Blood On The World's Hands\" has a full blown bass solo intro, which is really different. Keyboards have been brought in here as well. \"Sign Of The Cross\" and \"Blood On The World's Hands\" are the best examples of the keyboard overtones on this album. I'm not sure, but I think there is a keyboard solo on \"Fortunes Of War.\" Whatever it is, it sounds pretty cool.\n\nNo matter who was singing vocals, it just wasn't the same without Bruce Dickinson. Former Wolfsbane singer Blaze Bayley was selected to perform the vocals on \"The X Factor,\" but his performance just doesn't add up to Maiden standards. Blaze's has a deep singing voice, which does fit songs like \"Lord Of The Flies\" and \"The Aftermath,\" yet most of the songs have a mediocre vocal performance. The best specimens of this are \"The Unbeliever\" and \"Man On The Edge,\" which don't sound right with Blaze's vocals; if Bruce would of sang on these tracks, they'd be knockouts.\n\nIron Maiden took a different path when they wrote the lyrics to \"The X Factor.\" Lyrical material on older Maiden albums usually based around history, war and fantasy, but the lyrics on this album are based around darkness, depression, psychological effects of war, and questioning the existence of God. This was clearly a hard time for Maiden, and they show that by expressing dark feelings and emotions on this grim album.\n\n\"The X Factor\" is an important release in the Iron Maiden discography, not because of the material, but because it was Maiden's resurrection. This was the album where Maiden said \"Hey! Iron Maiden is NOT dead!\" \"The X Factor\" doesn't capture the perfection of the 80's material, but it is a huge step from \"No Prayer For The Dying\" and \"Fear Of The Dark.\" \n\nThis review was orginally written for: http://www.Thrashpit.com\n",
        "\nIron Maiden had an unusual amount of success when being compared to most bands. During the 1980's, Iron Maiden released seven excellent studio albums that were perfect from beginning to end. The song writing was incredible, the lyrics were poetic, and everything flowed together perfectly, but this kind of perfection couldn't last forever. The 1980's had ended and the golden years Iron Maiden once had came to an end with there first lackluster release of the new decade, \"No Prayer For The Dying.\"\n\nIron Maiden's guitar attack has severely downsized on \"No Prayer For The Dying.\" Most of Maiden's material on the first seven albums contained a decent amount of speed in the riffs; the speed element on \"No Prayer For The Dying\" has basically vanished. Songs like \"Tailgunner\" and \"Public Enema Number One\" lack the speedy guitar work that was once a key factor in Iron Maiden's music, and it makes the songs seem really boring. Repetition of the riffs doesn't help the already lame guitar work. Most of the songs have one riff that repeats until the song ends. This repetitiveness obviously makes the music seem extremely dull. The only positive factor about the guitar work is the solos. The solos seem to be much more technical then on previous albums. This does add a little comfort, but the overall guitar work is terrible.\n\nBruce Dickinson changed his vocal style on \"No Prayer For The Dying,\" and it really drags the album down. Instead of that high flying voice he had on previous albums, Bruce now has a raspy voice. His new gritty voice doesn't fit the usual Maiden tone. There are hardly any good singing moments by Bruce, just the annoying voice that sounds like someone dying.\n\nNot every song on \"No Prayer For The Dying\" is bad. \"Bring Your Daughter To The Slaughter\" has become a Maiden classic with the thumping bass lines, the numerous amount of solos, and the famous raunchy lyrics. The title track is probably the best track on the album. The title track is filled with soft guitar notes and catchy leads. There is also a nice speed metal burst in the middle, which seems to regress that old Maiden sound. These two tracks are the only songs that stand out on this mistake of an album.\n\nI've been very fond of most of Maiden's material, but this album is truly terrible. \"No Prayer For The Dying\" was the first album of Maiden's decline, which ultimately led to the departure of Bruce Dickinson. Without a shadow of a doubt, \"No Prayer For The Dying\" is Iron Maiden's worst album. I doubt they'll make something as bad as this again. Unless you're a Maiden superfan, I suggest you stay away from this one. \n\nThis review was orginally written for: http://www.Thrashpit.com.\n",
        "\nThe release of a new Iron Maiden album tends to cause a lot of mixed opinions. The inevitable grizzling and complaining tends to reach a crescendo, then settles down as those with patience allow the album to sink in and appreciate it for what it is. The same pattern has already been established at the time of the last two albums' releases, and it's as predictable as clockwork. Not to worry, because those of us who appreciate Iron Maiden's recent maturation into a prog-tinged, midpaced style will appreciate this album just as much as the last two. A Matter of Life and Death, Iron Maiden studio album number 14 and the third with the current lineup of Dickinson, Smith, Murray, Gers, Harris and McBrain, is a winner in every sense. \n\nThis is Maiden in a very contemplative, serious mood. In that sense, it's a fair bit less upbeat than Brave New World and Dance of Death. Shades of the darkness surrounding The X Factor make a return here, although it's still nowhere near as morbid as that particular dark horse. The lyrics focus mostly on either current world events (although addressed through universal themes, without specific references, CNN metal this is not), or the more philosophical themes explored quite widely on Dance of Death. As usual, war plays a major role, with tracks like \"These Colours Don't Run\", \"Brighter Than A Thousand Suns\" and \"The Longest Day\" all exploring humanity's longstanding efforts to kill each other en masse for the sake of religion or a piece of land. The closest it gets to CNN metal is \"For the Greater Good of God\", which is an obvious stab at Islamic terrorist bullshit, but even that one is wide-ranging enough not to lump itself in with the likes of Kreator or Vile's recent lyrical silliness. One title which initially frightened me a bit was \"Lord of Light\". Initially, I figured that Nicko had taken over the pen and delivered an ode to his favourite judeo-christian figurehead. As it turns out, the absolute opposite applies- It's a tongue-in-cheek exploration of Lucifer's \"good side\", so to speak. \n\nMusically, this is Iron Fucking Maiden, no more and no less. There are no glaring surprises or bullshit modern nu-shite influences, no stupid divergences into genre-splicing, nothing but pure, unadulterated epic heavy metal. The three guitarists blend in perfect unison, Nicko delivers thunderous drumming (he pulled out a 30 year old snare for this album, and it sounds absolutely monstrous), 'Arry clicks and widdles away like there's no tomorrow, and Bruce Dickinson is his usual impeccable self. Sure, he doesn't sound like he's just had his balls whacked with a cricket bat, but so fucking what? Compared to how, for example, Robert Plant or Ozzy sounded at his current age, he's in absolutely brilliant form and delivers another impassioned, energetic performance as expected. There's a wry nod to \"Children of the Damned\" in the intro to \"The Longest Day\" too, although any amusement is quickly erased by the following song's deadly serious retelling of the D-Day landing. All 10 songs here are ridiculously consistent, mostly surpassing the 7-minute mark, but never getting boring. For any band to make an album last 72 minutes without losing the plot is a remarkable feat, and this is the second time Iron Maiden have pulled it off. A lot of the songs follow the pattern established on the last few albums of a quiet buildup leading into the main body of the song, sometimes being reprised later on. This approach gives the material a welcome sense of dynamics which fits well with the overall dark theme, allowing the music enough breathing room to not become stifling.\n\nThis is an Iron Maiden album for Iron Maiden fans. Those who have matured along with the band will appreciate it, those who delude themselves into thinking it's still 1985 will impotently attempt to criticize it, and the world will keep turning. Another great thing to note is that EMI have given up on the copy-control bullshit, so this is a proper CD rather than an inferior pseudo-CD, and the first edition comes with a great DVD containing a highly entertaining 30-minute documentary covering the final stages of recording (although a lot of the banter is unintelligible due to thick accents and the obvious raw camcorder sound mix, no ADR to speak of here), the \"Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg\" video clip and another studio-footage clip. \n\n\nOriginally published at www.metalcrypt.com (c) 2006.\n",
        "\nThis one really shocked me. I was skeptical, as was everyone and I downplayed it every chance I had - now the band's back to slap me in the face for my sins. It was an exercise in futility - after all, this is Maiden, the most consistent and highly regarded band in all of metal. It's definetly a grower as well - one doesn't grasp the beauty and the atmosphere of this masterpiece in just one listen. All I can say is, the band's aged really well - unlike mentors Judas Priest and Deep Purple. One might label the the album as being on 'overdrive' by merely looking at the length of the songs but fortunately this isn't the case.You will notice that the longest songs themselves do not feature any sort of extended soloing, the album keeps the Maiden tradition of keeping riffs and rhythm high on the charts. This isn't Dream Theater or Opeth, this is Iron Maiden - what they do, they do with conviction. \n\nThe band's gone way way down the progressive and epic route. This is Maiden undoubtedly, but Maiden at their most progressive and atmospheric. It is rather dangerous for a classic metal band to go to such extreme progressive leanings - but one can't help but like this. The atmosphere really seeps in, you can almost smell the gun powder and see barren wastelands around you as you listen. Maiden have always had this unique, wonderful ability in being able to conjure images of the lyrics in the listener - the bridge of \"Ghost Of The Navigator\" resembles a ship sinking desperately in wrathful waters, \"The Nomad\" brings to mind a suny desert with a desolate man walking about it, \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\" (Best song ever, easily) expertly brings to mind a prisoners insecurities before he is lead to the gallows and his remorseless reconcilation later to his fate. Here too, the listener feels himself being transported back to the war laden 40's. Once the album is complete - he is abruptly thrown off back to the present, to find that it isn't much different. That's basically the message Maiden are trying to send through to the listener here, and they do it damn well! \n\nAll instruments play an equal role in the albums success. Nicko drumming resembles the death march of a batallion of soldiers as they march into the unknown and then he shifts breathtakingly to a more relaxed drum style and then he breaks into some really insane, refreshing creative stuff. Nicko has always been in the shadow of Clive Burr's superior drumming skills but he gets better as he grows older and now he's in Clive Burr territory following Burr's principle of being 'Catchy, fast, furious and creative at the same time'. Despite the albums immense atmospheric leanings, it strangely has Maiden's heaviest guitar tone. Adrian, Dave and Janick all do an absolutely awesome job on guitars. The soloing here is perfect and the riffing remains heavy but lapses into these amazing 'atmospheric bridges' that all the songs contain. Steve is as usual excellent on bass although his bass guitar isn't as pronounced in the mix as it was in Maiden's earlier stuff. Everyone accepts that Bruce's vocals have sharply reduced in quality since the early days, but one cannot deny he does an excellent job here - he merely does what is needed to be done with perfection and emotion intact and doesn't lapse into the excesses one sees in so many Modern Metal bands these days. There are lots of surprises here as well, and they all work - for example, the riff of Lord Of The Light which is rather atypical for how the song actually began. \"The Legacy\" has the great acoustic intro and follows with a riff ripped off directly from \"Gutter Ballet\" (Savatage - title track for Gutter Ballet. Amazing song, one of metal's best ballads) which itself stole a song from Maiden's \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\".\n\nI feel I don't need to divulge into the detailed explanations of the songs by doing a track-by-track review as it would only spoil the grandeur of the album for a listener. I re-instate that the album must NOT be dismissed on first listen, it takes some time to really seep into the listener. This certainly is Maiden's best since Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son (In my opinion the best metal album ever ;)). It takes the best parts of The X Factor (\"The Sign Of The Cross\" especially, the band certainly re-listened to it and took cues from it) and combines it with the vintage Maiden sound to create what Brave New World and Dance Of Death could have been. This may very well be the last Maiden album in a long time, but they certainly faded away with a blast of the amazing.\n\nConclusion - Amazing album, best Maiden album since 7th Son. Very atmospheric and epic. Must be listened to rigorously till it clicks.\n\nChoice picks of the lot - Brighter Than A Thousand Suns, The Longest Day, Out Of The Shadows, The Reincarnation Of Benjamin Breeg, Lord Of Light, The Legacy.\n",
        "\nAnd my long wait has come to an end. Here it is, the new Maiden. This one has had me pumped for awhile now. Ever since I saw that video for Benjamin Breeg hit the net I've been salivating for this album and every new song that came out just left me wanting more.\n\nNow that I have it... I can truely say this IS the Maiden album I was wanting in every way. The sound is smooth and flowing, the songs are loaded with hooks, and this album manages to be both patented Maiden yet strikingly adventurous. I loved Brave New World, but it was sort of a safe album that tried to recapture and in a way repeat what had been done before. Understandable as it was their attempt to bring the Maiden sound back from life support and say 'Hey, Bruce is back'. DoD then tried to experiment but came off as awkward at times. I read in an interview with Bruce that he thought this album was experimental but came much more naturally and I have to say his assessment is 100% right.\n\nThere was a time when every Maiden album really had it's own identity and sound... and that time is back. There are a couple standards here like These Colours Don't Run and The Pilgrim which follow a mid-paced gallop and would not be out of place on an album like BNW. These are two of the shorter tracks and probably the most direct on the album. The Pilgrim does have some interesting dual layer vocals of Bruce in his mid and high range though which work quite well. Different World is also fairly direct but is insanely catchy and features a chorus with a somewhat different vocal sound by Bruce that I really enjoy. Another short but sweet track is Out Of The Shadows which is an utterly incredible song that harkens back to a sound I've not heard from Maiden in some time. A truely passionate ballad the likes of which I don't think I've heard since Children Of The Damned.\n\nThis album is mostly geared towards epic sounding songs, with 6 tracks clocking in over 7 minutes in length. Most all of these start with a slow and soft intro and build into very powerful tracks that simply work. The most immediately striking remains The Reincarnation Of Benjamin Breeg with it's heavy crunch guitar and fucking awesome vocals. What the last couple Maiden songs have really been missing is a classic single and this one just succeeds with flying colors. It drew me in the moment I heard it and it stands out from the rest of the album. It is just one of those instant classic songs and is every bit as good as the classic Maiden singles in my opinion.\n\nIn conclusion, this is Maiden... but not just Maiden you've heard before, which is extremely refreshing. It's nice hearing them bring something new to the table and making it work beautifully. The one thing I can say as a sort of con to this album is that the many times over repeated choruses remain in a couple tracks, but that's never really bothered me anyways. As long as the chorus is good and delivered with conviction, I don't mind hearing it a few times over. All in all, I can't imagine any fan of Maiden being displeased with this album.\n\nHighlights: The Reincarnation Of Benjamin Breeg, Out Of The Shadows, Different World, For The Greater Good of God\n",
        "\nAfter rapidly gaining a massive following from thier debut album and extensive touring that included dates headlining for Judas Priest, Maiden returned to the studio within the year to record thier sophomore album 'Killers'.\n\nA couple of thing need to be mentioned before continuing. This album is the last with vocalist Paul Di'Anno, which is a shame because he was a truly excellent singer. It also marks the arrival of Adrian Smith, and I'm sure you all know just how important this change is to the band.\n\nThe album contains everything you'd expect from the boys; incredible basslines driving along a twin quitar attack that assaults with blistering solos on nearly every song, backed by some excellent drumming by Clive Burr, all with Di'Anno's ballsy and aggressive vocals thrown into the mix. The band throws riff after riff at you, mercilessly demanding you submit to the sheer awesomeness of it all.\n\nThe songwriting has matured by leaps and bounds in such a short amount of time, especially lyrically. Songs such as \"Murders In The Rue Morgue\" showcase the progression of the lyrics, while tracks like \"Killers\" - which feature what is arguably one of the coolest riffs ever - show how the band has come along musically. The instrumental \"Ghengis Khan\" is another great example, firing riff after riff at you in rapid succession, leaving you short of breath and wanting for more.\n\nThe song \"Twilight Zone\" wasn't included on the original version of the album, but is a cool little track that makes a great addition to the remaster. As is the case with all the remasters, 'Killers' offers up a huge boklet chock full of rare pictures and an Enhanced CD section featuring videos for \"Wrathchild\" and \"Killers\", two of the albums best tracks.\n\n'Killers' continues right where the debut left off, paving the way for the NWOBHM. Quite possibly one of the band's strongest releases, it shows enough progression to keep the formula from getting stale, and every step the band takes forward in the album is for the better. A very solid release, this classic belongs in any self-respecting metalhead's collection.\n",
        "\nWhen I learned that Maiden would release another live album, I was quite surprised. I thought they gave me enough with Rock In Rio but it seems that they really wanted everyone to hear the best pieces from Dance Of Death in all their glory. \n\nMy first quick listen was disappointing, mostly because I decided to hear the older songs. It was like listening to Rock In Rio... Nothing special... But a couple of months later, I decided to listen to it completely. A good decision, it quickly became my favourite live Maiden recording. The atmosphere created on their previous album, Dance Of Death, was very mystic and absorbing, a real passionate album. The way Iron Maiden plays Wildest Dreams, Dance Of Death, Rainmaker, Paschendale, No More Lies and Journeyman (all from Dance Of Death) is amazing. Every one of those songs get ten times better when played live, even Rainmaker, which I used to skip on the studio album. Listening to the title song from Dance Of Death once again reminded me of Spinal Tap's cheesy \"Stonehenge\", the dwarfs dancing in the Spinal Tap movie would really enjoy Dance Of Death. That doesn't mean I don't like the Dance Of Death, It\u2019s just that I couldn't think of anything else than those dwarfs dancing on the little riff in the middle of the song. You should also listen closely to Paschendale, which is, I\u2019m my opinion the most impressive song performed on Death On The Road. For the other tracks, like I mentioned earlier, they sound quite like Rock In Rio, nothing new here, maybe a little heavier.\n\nDeath On The Road, really worth buying and if you haven't bought Dance Of Death already, buy this one instead! My rating, 88 out of 100.\n",
        "\nIn early April, 1980, a heavy metal gargantuan was launched from its humble beginnings in the East End of London. That band is, of course, the now eponymous Iron Maiden, and the album that started it all is this one, their self titled LP. It\u2019s doubtful that bassist and main-man Steve Harris could have envisioned where his journey would lead him, and although this is the starting point of one of the most long-running and influential bands in metal, it is often overlooked by all but the most die-hard fans\u2026which is a shame, because there are some true gems on this disc!\n\nEnough of the history lesson, I hear you cry, is the music good, or what?! Well, while many will no doubt lose interest as soon as the words \u2018no\u2019 and \u2018Bruce\u2019 leave my lips, this is a must for all Maiden fans, or even anybody interested in the NWOBHM genre as a whole. Everything you would come to expect from a Maiden album is here; the galloping bass to the dual guitar harmonies so many love-hell, there\u2019s even an early epic number, in the form of Phantom of the Opera! However, and I must stress this at this point in the review, this is early Maiden. The production has a rough quality to it, with punchy (almost punky) guitars to match Paul Di\u2019Anno\u2019s grating vocals. All the foundation is there, it just lacks the polish that would come on later albums such as \u2018Seventh Son\u2026\u2019 or \u2018Piece of Mind\u2019.\n\nThe disc kicks off with Prowler, which is easily one of the best tracks on this disk. The main intro riff grabs you by forcefully, and when Dave Murray kicks in on lead guitar with his wah-wah pedal\u2026it\u2019s heaven. The whole song has a vibrant, jumpy feel to it, with plenty of nice fills by Dave and the short-lived Dennis Stratton (understandably, he didn\u2019t last long when held up against the far superior Adrian Smith). This is one of those \u2018play it until the neighbours complain\u2019 songs, the kind which demand to be played loud and with accompaniment, whether by headbanging, dancing, or just beating the crap out of any object or surface you can find in your efforts to match the beat. \n\nThe rock feel continues onto the next track (if you have the 1998 remastered edition), Sanctuary, which, though short, has some ridiculous lyrics and catchy solos. But its still not \u2018The Trooper\u2019 or \u2018Where Eagles Dare\u2019. It lacks the padding that those songs have, which demonstrates again the age of this songwriting. Remember Tomorrow slows things right down for a pleasant, soft ballad that picks up at the choruses and halfway through the song, with some excellent trade-offs of screams between Di\u2019anno and guitar. A mellow interlude before the single, Running Free. Really, this one song exemplifies the attitude of this young Maiden, with its simple (yet catchy) bass intro to the sing-a-long chorus.\n\nBut if at this point you feel that you\u2019re not as impressed as you should be, the next track may catch your attention. Phantom of the Opera is the longest track on this album (at 7 minutes long), and it hints at the glories of the Harris-written epics to come. An obscenely melodic and catchy (I seem to be using that word a lot in this review!) intro leads into a rapid ascending scale before bursting into one of the fastest riffs Maiden have ever written. This is head-banging material right here, and for roughly 3 minutes the song continues at this pace, before abruptly slowing right down for a loooooong instrumental section, which is frankly just brilliant. From a loud, galloping bass part to some excellent solos, this song just takes you to another world, until the main riff comes in again near the end. Every time I listen to this song I remember that Steve Harris cannot have been much older than I am now when he wrote this-this is powerful stuff, my friends. Okay, so it may not be \u2018Hallowed Be Thy Name\u2019 in your book, but you can take your overplayed epics and cram them right up your ass for all I care :p\n\nSo where can this album go from this dizzying height? Not much higher, it seems. The rest of the album is really much of the same, and what you\u2019ve come to expect from Maiden. Transylvania is an extended instrumental that sounds like Phantom Pt. II, and Strange World is yet another ballad, although softer than Remember Tomorrow. Charlotte the Harlot is, simply put, comic relief of the highest order, with yet another catchy Prowler-esque lead and a brilliant breakdown section in the middle. To end, we have the title track of this album, and the band\u2019s namesake. Played at every concert since the band\u2019s beginning, this is their anthem and their dedication to the crowd. Unfortunately, it\u2019s lost its appeal over the years, as it is simply a verse/chorus construction repeated twice with a short drum/bass section in the middle. That this song is still a mainstay alongside \u2018The Trooper\u2019 and \u2018Hallowed Be Thy Name\u2019 is strange, especially since there are far better tracks on this disk-Prowler for one.\n\nOverall, Iron Maiden is one of the best examples of the early NWOBHM movement from one of its key bands, and is an enjoyable listen, despite its shortcomings. Approached with an open mind (hopefully ignorant of the band\u2019s other releases!), it can quickly become your favourite album. The only let downs are the short length, the somewhat shallow lyrics and musical depth which pop up from time to time, and if you don\u2019t like raw, the production can be a problem as well.\n\nBest tracks: Prowler, Phantom of the Opera, Transylvania, Charlotte the Harlot\n",
        "\nThis right here is the second best thing Maiden ever did, second only to 7th son. This is pretty much straight forward NWOBHM, but this just might be the best album from that era heavy metal. I actually had to listen to the album a few times for I realised how awesome it truely is. With the addition of Adrian Smith, Iron Maiden really improved the overall musical direction of the band. Well what I mean is the guitar work improved alot and became even more enjoyable to listen to.\n\nI mean seriously this guitar playing here is some the best you'll ever hear, and this album also contains what might be Maiden's best 5 song combo. The first five songs on Killers are perfect and with these five songs are the two best instumentals the band ever did. \"Ides Of March\" is the opener and this is usually used for an opener for live shows. Ides is heavily guitar driven with great layered guitar riffs with great drumming, and great bass playing by Steve Harris.\n\n\"Gengis Khan\" is really great, because to me it contains the album's best guitar solo. The song itself goes through many changes, starting off little comlexed and fast, and then evens out and starts going into a steady tempo and then we come to the amazing solo, which is kinda subtle but it works perfectly here. \"Wrath Child\" is the first song on the album, which is just awesome, Paul Dianno really sings very well but you really shouldn't compared the guy to Dickinson. Paul is Paul, and Bruce is Bruce, but personaly I prefer to hear Paul singing on Killers/Iron Maiden era songs than Bruce.\n\nI do think Bruce is the better singer of course, but I just think Dianno voice fits these songs better. Anyways \"Murders In Rue Morgue\" is excellent as well, kinda has a power metal vibe. The chorus is also probably the best on the album. The guitar melodies like mentioned before are complexed and very melodic, this great highlight and is a fan favorite, just awesome. \"Another Life\" is actually my favorite song on Killers, it starts off with a guitar intro and it kinda creeps into this guitar galloping epic. I really love chorus here it really is sung well by Dianno, great guitar solo and very structured piece of music.\n\nI think song is about how your life could of been or what it should of been, I guess we can relate to these feelings. This really is one of the best songs Maiden ever wrote, defiante highlight for me. \"Twilight Zone\" which was a single from album, is quite nice and \"Drifter\" is which is overlooked, is real gem to. Anyone who likes cowboys or cowboy themes would probably enjoy this one. I usually think of the man with no name when listening to this one. All of the songs here are really good, pretty solid, well very solid would be more fitting term.\n\nI can't believe this album doesn't get more worship for fans, it's an essential piece of heavy metal, and if you don't own it, consider your metal collection incomplete. Get this baby on vinyl record if you can, and play it for days until you can sing the whole album by heart. No Maiden fan should be without this one, highly recommended classic.\n",
        "\nThe ebb and flow of trends within any art form have tended to be a necessary outcome of popular demand, and within the musical world it was an inevitable one prior to the advent of the internet. Certain questions regarding whether these shifts in what is considered vogue being an organic phenomenon are naturally warranted, though in retrospect they are best understood as a simple matter of fact, irregardless of how much manipulation one might attribute to the recording industry. Insofar as heavy metal was concerned in the mid-1980s, the trend was definitely leaning a bit heavy on the AOR side of things, perhaps largely as a response to the mainstream headway that was being made by the L.A. sleaze and broader glam rock scenes. Though this was a gradual shift in direction that could be traced back a couple years prior, by 1985 even once cutting edge and impact-base pioneers out of the U.K. and Germany such as Saxon and Accept were placing a heavier emphasis on keyboards, balladry and a primacy of melodic hooks over biting riff work. The only major player out of the NWOBHM that seemed poised to maintain the style's harder-edged credentials while still expanding the possibilities of their sub-genre was Iron Maiden, and following an exhaustive touring schedule on their 1985 smash Powerslave, it was anybody's guess as to how things would play out when said heavy metal icons hit the studio again.\n\nThough the casual observer will be quick to note the fairly consistent formula that this outfit has played off of since their breakthrough outing with Bruce Dickinson at the helm in Number Of The Beast, careful consideration of their cumulative studio efforts since reveal a band that is in a fairly rapid state of stylistic evolution. Faced with the ascendancy of AOR dominated heavy metal among their fellow heavy metal alumni and all the various bells and whistles that go with it, not to mention Bruce sitting out from songwriting sessions in order to recover from a punishing world tour, a rather unique musical compromise was struck that somehow managed to adopt much of the present stylistic paradigm without loosing the edge that was clearly absent from albums like Innocence Is No Excuse and Heart Of Our Time. At its core, Somewhere In Time, Maiden's 6th studio album in almost as many years and the crowning achievement of their entire career, is a pure heavy metal album that acknowledges and incorporates a number of quirks of the mid-80s and unintentionally stumbles into territory not far removed from the nascent yet still largely untapped territory of power metal. The strategic use of synthesizers, the dense and spacey sounding guitar tone and generally otherworldly character of the lyrical content could be compared to the recent exploits of Queensryche and Fates Warning, though the songwriting still largely conforms to a symmetrical character.\n\nThe jury is out as to whether the band had \"The Rivalry Of Smith and Harris\" as a working title prior to this album's release, but the hegemony of both in the songwriting department creates a rather intricate synchronicity that further fuels this album's uniqueness among that collective whole of Maiden's 1980s output. Neither really goes into full on conventional territory relative to what they've written in the past, though they end up in very different places musically, with Smith churning out three fairly complex yet moderate length songs that have a strong riff-oriented and rocking character to them. Melodic fanfare and mid-paced rocker \"Wasted Years\", which is arguably the most iconic and well-known offering of the lot, features Smith in arguably his most technical capacity and also one of the most infectious choruses every penned under the Maiden moniker. By contrast, the somewhat off-kilter anthem \"Sea Of Madness\" goes a bit heavier and repackages elements of the rocking character of \"Two Minutes To Midnight\" into a pounding, rhythmic machine that also finds itself segueing into a melancholy ballad segment following the solo section almost reminds of the spacey atmosphere of \"Strange World\". Pile on a slow-grooving and densely atmospheric ride through the ice-covered wastelands in \"Stranger In A Strange Land\", sporting a fairly blatant Dio influence between the principle guitar riff and the \"Heaven And Hell\" inspired slow-galloping bass.\n\nThe generally slower to mid-paced and largely concise handiwork of Smith on here finds a wildly ambitious and all-over-the-place foil in Steve Harris' contributions to this album, often blurring the lines between where heavy metal ends and the, at the time, extremely young style of power/prog begins. The fast-paced gallop-machine and title song \"Caught Somewhere In Time\" features a litany of forward-looking elements, sometimes coming off as mildly thrashing at a few key points, not to mention featuring a wild dueling guitar exchange between Smith and Murray that could qualify as a metallic equivalent to \"Free Bird\". The live favorite and more mid-paced cruiser \"Heaven Can Wait\" has occasional echoes of the title song off \"Number Of The Beast\", but features a far more complex presentation of ideas, often times wandering into progressive territory when not banging out a gang chorus sing-along segment or featuring Murray setting his fret board on fire. \"The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner\" ups the ante in the speed department further, falling a few clicks short of catching up with where Helloween would be a year later on Keeper Of The Seven Keys Pt. 1, and also features an earlier version of the iconic \"Fear Of The Dark\" melody while simultaneously blazing through riffing segments comparable to \"Aces High\" on steroids. Dave Murray's lone contribution to this album, in collaboration with Harris, dubbed \"Deja Vu\" manages to get a bit faster and basically offers a taste of what power metal would sound like had Thin Lizzy ever taken it up. One wouldn't be out of line in speculating that maybe Dave was paying tribute to the recently departed Phil Lynott here, that's how similar some of the guitar leads sound to a couple of notable songs from the latter days of his tenure with TL.\n\nIn essence, this album's enduring charm and unique character flows from a massive degree of emphasis upon instrumental intrigue that results in an album where the front man ends up sharing equal footing with the rest of the band. There aren't really any outlandish moments of vocal gymnastics out of Bruce Dickinson to be found on any of these songs, though he clearly isn't slouching and winds up putting a massive amount of passion into a collection of lyrical themes that were not of his own making. This is perhaps best underscored in the massive epic of a closing song \"Alexander The Great\", which stands as the most musically ambitious composition that Steve Harris had thrown together since first defying conventional songwriting formulas with \"Phantom Of The Opera\", not to mention holding equal footing with \"Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son\" as the most complex song he's ever penned. The massive collection of contrasting lead guitar themes, the odd-timed military drumming work out of McBrain, not to mention the occasional symphonic elements that interplay with the keyboard work (there's one point where a massive tam-tam is worked in to accentuate a Greek-tinged lead guitar interlude) rule the roost for this song's eight and a half minute duration, yet would be utterly directionless without Bruce's story narration, and while his voice doesn't exactly shatter glass like the glory days of 1982, the sheer force of his voice and his perfect annunciation of the Hellenistic conquests seal the deal on an out and out classic song that will forever remain Maiden's most underrated.\n\nNaturally with any auspiciously different album by an iconic band, this one is not free of controversy, largely due to the accidental conservatism that this band displayed on previous albums due to a lack of keyboard use and a far more streamlined songwriting approach that generally led to a plurality of bangers after the mold of \"The Trooper\" and \"Run To The Hills\" being accompanied by only one or two epic numbers. Even the album that immediately followed this one, which also happened to be Maiden's lone concept album, found itself relying a bit more on shorter and more streamlined songwriting, leaving Somewhere In Time in more of a unique position as the most experimental offering of their glory days. All the same, with arguably the exception of The Number Of The Beast, this would prove to be their most influential album, and probably more so on their own latter days efforts just about every album that this outfit has penned since Dickinson's return to the fold in the late 1990s has been steeped in progressive rock elements and elongated songwriting that began with this album. It isn't really a power metal album, nor does it really cross the rubicon into full on progressive metal territory, but one can't help but note the parallels that it shares with both, nor can one deny its auspicious place in metal history regardless of whether one loves or hates it. Eddie may have been bigger than the devil and at one with the pharaohs, but no matter what point in time he may find himself, his eye will always be fixed on the future, and it saw its clearest with the aid of cybernetic implants.\n\n(Rewritten on January 21st, 2019)\n",
        "\nDeath On The Road comes spanned over 3 DVDs, 2 of them having the same content with the exception of the sound mix and a DVD with studio and backstage footage, including interviews with the members on the making of Dance Of Death and interview with the crew during the tour. \n\nDVD no. 1/2. I don`t know how the 2.0 mix is, I used the 5.1 DVD to watch the concert. The sound mix is absolute bilss, if you have the corect setup for your speakers you will feel in the middle of the stage. and this is one reason alone why this DVD rules. the angles used, all picked by hand by Mr. Maiden himself, Steve Harris, are a little bit of a downfall at times, as they change pretty darn fast, and if you like to look at what one guitar player does during the song, well...bad luck, you only get about one, maybe two seconds of one angle, so you can`t really get what he`s doing. otherwise, the setlist was OK, typical maiden, not very different from the Rock In Rio DVD, only this time they included more songs from DoD and only one from Brave New World. which is a pitty, I might add... and because the DoD songs are longer, they had less space for other songs, thus Maiden anthems like 2 Minutes, Sanctuary, The Evil That Men Do and others that are usually in their list are not found here. not a very big deal, as they have played them so many times until now, that everybody knows pretty darn well how they sound live. But to see Bruce dressed up like an army soldier on Paschendale, or a medieval storyteller/grim reaper in DoD makes up for the missing songs. yes, Bruce has costume changes. 3 of them to make it clear. the songs are played allmost to perfection, allthough Hallowed Be Thy Name has had better days. All in all a nice Maiden show, with the classical setlist (they could have thrown out Paschendale and thew in Seventh Son, or Alexander the Great, or whatever else to make it be more diverse...)\n\nDVD 3 includes, as stated before, an insight into how the DoD album was made and what implies being on the road with maiden. interviews with the band, producer, technicians, basicaly all the important people involved in Iron Maiden in the studio and on the road. It gives you a nice and clear idea of how the band writes songs and how preparations are made every day for a successful live concert, and what risks they include (the part with german beer on the mixing table was not very nice...). you also get the two videos from DoD (Wildest Dreams and Rainmaker) and some sketches of both.\n",
        "\nWell here's the good and bad about maiden's new dvd death on the road:\n\nThe Good:\nThe overall audio quality is very good, sometimes the individual guitars and the bass are a bit hard to hear but otherwise very good.\n\nThe best songs on this dvd seem to be songs from the album dance of death, namely: No More Lies, Journeyman, Dance of Death, and Paschendale. Maiden also put up a great version of their classic tracks Hallowed Be Thy Name and Fear of The Dark. Their self titled song Iron Maiden is always a good live number and showed up in fine form as well.\n\nThe Bad:\nMy big problem with this is the editing, done mostly (if not all) by Steve Harris. Its very flashy (but seems to get better) and especially angeres me during the guitar solos, although i actually thought he did a great job on Paschendale and No More Lies. \n\nOther than that the song Brave New World was not nearly as good as on Rock in Rio as it seemed to lack its prior energy.\n\n\nAll in all this is an excellent DVD that seems to improve as it goes on, and is well worth the buy if your into Maiden or just Metal in general.\n",
        "\nIron Maiden are just about the greatest live band ever. I should know, having seen them fairly recently on their 2003 tour, though the performance was a tad too short. Like any band, they are subject to good nights, and bad nights. Unfortunately, this is one of those bad nights.\n\nIt's been about four or five years since I picked up this live album, and my verdict is in: it blows. Well, ok, I don't hate it (hence the 60 rating), but pretty much every live Maiden album in existance is better than this (and yes that includes A Real Live Dead One), and why anyone thinks this is the greatest thing that Maiden has ever done is beyond me.\n\nFirst of all, I don't know who is reponsible for keeping all instruments and other variables at their proper volume, be it Martin Birch, or the sound engineer, or mixer, but were they fucking stoned when they produced/engineered/mixed this? Right when Aces High kicks in, I can tell something's not right because whoever is playing the upper harmony guitar part is much louder than it should be, and I can't hear the other harmony.\n\nThen 2 Minutes To Midnight comes on, and it is much slower than the studio version. 2 Minutes To Midnight should not be slowed down when played live. Next up, three Piece Of Mind classics: The Trooper, Revelations, & Flight Of Icarus. These come off just as good as the studio versions, but not better. Revelations is missing a harmonic during the fast interlude\n\nAs far as the band's performance goes, they all do sound like they are giving it their all, but Bruce tries too hard sometimes (especially on the Beast stuff, he just can't quite hit the high notes on Hallowed). Also, I'm not impressed with Dave's improvised solo on 22 Acacia Avenue. Improv solos are so fucking annoying, especially if the one they cut in the studio was excellent like the one on 22 Acacia Avenue. Oh, and people might as well stop complaining about giving Adrian back the solo on Hallowed Be Thy Name, because not even he can get the damn thing right.\n\nNonetheless this album does have its moments: While one half of the Powerslave stuff comes off as complete crap, The Rime Of The Ancient Mariner and title track reign pure fucking destruction on Long Beach. Die With Your Boots on lays the original to absolute waste, and the \"If you're gonna die...\" intro still gets me pumped up. \n\nLast but not least there is \"The Phantom! Of The Opera!\" This is, as far as I'm concerned, the definitve version of this song. The guitars are loud and heavy enough, and Bruce's vocals get this one absolutely right. Paul Di'anno can complain all he wants about Bruce not sounding as having the right voice for his songs (what is it with singer's complaining about replacements singing their stuff, anyway? Probably bitterness.) but Bruce nails this one perfectly. \"Keep your distance walk away don't take his baaeaaaait. Don't you swaaaaaaay!\nFuck yea!\n\n\nBut yea, other than those 4 songs, I don't know what the fuss is about. Also, of these shows were sold out right? Well if this is what a sold out Long Beach Arena audience sounds like, I am not impressed. They seem to enjoy whislting more than screaming out the words when Bruce tells them to, which is fucking lame.\n\nIn conclusion, this one is worth hearing, but if you wanna hear Iron Maiden on some excellent nights, go get Rock In Rio, which is the new canonical example of Maiden concert madness. Alternatively you could pick up the Eddie's Archive box set, which has Beast Over Hammersmith, which is hands down and pants down the greatest album ever recorded.\n",
        "\n\"A Real Dead One\" comes as one half of the recordings of the '92 Fear of the Dark World Tour, with \"A Real Live One\" being the other half and \"Live at Donington\" an additional limited edition album; all of them thus being at the time the last live recordings with Dickinson. \"A Real Dead One\" contains songs from the pre-Live After Death era, and as I can assure that it is nowhere near as good as that one, one should consider it an obligatory buy to complete the loyal fan's collection.\n\nGeneral let-downs of this album:\n1. An overall bad production, which was obviously Harry's intention, but which does not add to the quality. The crowd is too loud, the guitars are too weak and the bass has too little bass (my experience learns that this must be due to the production and not to the PA of the show).\n2. A generally dull track-listing. I am a fervent Maiden-fan, but don't stand up and cheer to hear for the zillionth time the ol' big hits played with little to no variation to the previous live recording.\n3. Musicianship: fairly not up to the Maiden standards if I may say so. The leads are okay, but not exceptional; the bass is not up to its fame (as is unfortunately quite usual with Harry's live performances of late); the singer is still Dickinson, but not half as good as he should be. That is, any band may dream to make a live recording half as good as this one and be told to dream on, but hey, this is Maiden, and it's clear that there was little time left for this line-up. Besides, Gers is not up to Smith's parts, sorry to say that but it's true.\n\nBut consider these positive points:\n1. Nicko is there, and makes me regret my choice to pick up the bass in stead of the drums. Come hell or high water, Nicko is there and he garantuees to bring you the core of what I often regard as one of the key elements of Maiden's succesful golden years. McBrain is an exceptional drummer, and manages to get this and any record going along, no matter what, with his catchy and creative fills. Favourite drummer N\u00b0 1, and I must own any Maiden live album to hear what he's been up to again.\n2. The track listing has also several merits:\n-\"Remember Tomorrow\" is well-performed, and also very well sung by Bruce.\n-\"Where Eagles Dare\" is one of the greatest Maiden songs, and although it's impossible to preserve the atmosphere of the studio version on a live show, it's still pretty decent and well sung.\n-\"Sanctuary\": improvisation, it's a rare thing with Maiden but it's here indeed.\n-\"2 Minutes\": well, it's great, just great, even though it's not the same as when performed with Adrian on Live After Death.\nThe tracks not mentioned above are rather weak, even the unusual \"Transylvania\". I pray each day for some diversification in Maiden's setlists, but one has to be lucky when they play one unusual song (like Lord of the Flies during the Dance of Death tour). I also pray that they would leave behind the faster-is-better-attitude and slow down again to fit the tempo of the studio versions more. I even pray for private gigs and cheaper t-shirts.\n\nAnyway, keep in mind that most of these tracks were recorded after Bruce's announcement of his leaving Maiden, and that thus, these were his farewell performances. Looking with hind-sight, however, kind of downgrades this record and makes it less unique.\n\n70% for the great music (come what may, it's still Maiden).\n",
        "\nI recall that when I put on this record for the first time after purchasing it shortly after it had been released, I was extremely disappointed. In the subsequent weeks I gave it countless spins and desperately tried to get into it, but failed. I have since given up trying to find the true qualities of this album. Neither have I ever listened to it in its entire length (and boy, do I mean LENGTH\u2026) again.\n\nI greatly admire everything Maiden have done before and after Blaze was with the band, but \u201cVirtual XI\u201d and especially this miscarriage of an album are, apart from the occasional decent song, pretty much worthless junk. And the main reason for this is not even Blaze\u2019s singing. Granted, the man is light years away from being the singer Bruce Dickinson is, and in numerous instances his vocals are downright annoying, particularly when he goes \u201cWohohohooo\u2026\u201d \u2013 totally hideous! But let\u2019s be fair here: Blaze\u2019s vocals aren\u2019t the primary reason why the two albums on which he appeared are by far the worst in Maiden\u2019s entire catalogue. More than anything else, they were plagued by wholly unsound songwriting. I don\u2019t really know what Mr. Harris and the boys were thinking when they put together the songs for this album. If this is Maiden\u2019s version of Progressive Metal, I pray to the Unholy Lord that we shall never have to endure anything like it again\u2026 Maybe the guys wanted to make a record that sounds dark and haunting, but it all comes across as utterly dull and whiny.\n\nSeriously, at times this sounds like a crossbreed between Metal and the Art Rock of the seventies (Genesis, Saga and the likes). Almost all of the songs are mercilessly drawn out and lengthy, beginning with completely unoriginal acoustic guitar intros that seem to last for ages and ending in the same fashion. And if you should manage to make it through those epitomes of pure unadulterated boredom without falling asleep, you will unfortunately realize that the actual songs are not exactly masterpieces either: not only is this Maiden\u2019s slowest album \u2013 the opener \u201cMan on the Edge\u201d is the only exception \u2013, it is also their least heavy, which is in equal parts due to the tiresome onslaught of acoustic guitars, the lack of good riffs, and the poor production, which accentuates the drums and Blaze\u2019s vocals (why anyone would want to accentuate those vocals is utterly beyond me\u2026) while burying the guitars somewhere deep in the mix.\n\nI could go on for ages ranting about how boring this album is and what exactly is wrong with the individual songs, but instead I would like to point out the few aspects that are NOT negative (saves a lot of time, too). \u201cMan on the Edge\u201d is actually a pretty nice song: up-tempo, nice riffs, and fairly short, i.e. it comes without the completely unnecessary ballast ruining most of the other tracks. \u201cFortunes of War,\u201d \u201cThe Aftermath,\u201d and \u201cThe Edge of Darkness\u201d all could be good songs if it weren\u2019t for all the excess acoustic guitar wankery, the poor production, and Blaze\u2019s even poorer vocals. \u201cThe Sign of the Cross\u201d is another instance where a decent song is so drawn out that it gets painfully tedious \u2013 easily five minutes too long! As for most of the rest \u2013 let\u2019s spare ourselves the pain of going into further detail. \u201cLook for the Truth,\u201d \u201cJudgement of Heaven,\u201d \u201cBlood on the World\u2019s Hands,\u201d and \u201c2 A.M.\u201d are all throwaway tracks that should have never, and I mean NEVER, have made it on a Maiden album.\n\nThat should be enough to convince anyone that it is best to steer clear of this baby, which is (yes, I know I have said it before) easily Maiden\u2019s worst effort. I guess the lesson to be learned from this is that even the best bands in the entire genre can sometimes fail miserably. If it weren\u2019t for the fact that we\u2019re still talking about Iron Maiden here, the same band that brought us milestones such as \u201cPiece of Mind,\u201d \u201cPowerslave,\u201d and several others, I would not even have given \u201cThe X Factor\u201d a 50!\n\nChoicest cuts: Maybe \u201cMan on the Edge\u201d and \u201cThe Aftermath,\u201d but none of it is really up to Maiden standard\u2026\n",
        "\nI've always liked Iron Maiden and this song just happens to be my favourite from them. It stands out as different to me because of course you've got a quiet drum beat to start with indicating, as it does most of the time, that a great track will unfold. As it slowly fades in to the almighty riff which personally I think is just brilliant. A slower track than ones like Heaven Can Wait and Deja-Vu, tracks also on the same album, but it has a lot more power to it than those tracks. The vocals are slower allowing more time to finely tune them, and finely tuned they are. The high notes are hit without a trace of a flat start and not a single note is out of tune. As a matter of fact, it may seem strange but as the chorus says\"Land of ice and snow\", as you listen to the song, the guitar effects actually give the song a cold, wintery feel to it, or it could be just me.\nThe bass sounds semingly complacently played but the guitar solos make up for that. The playing isn't quite as thrashy or heavy as some of their older stuff, but it's a good song and it's worth a listen.\n",
        "\nSo, after Brave New World, I seriously had my hopes up for this one, seeing how that album was pretty damn brilliant and ranked among Maiden's top five easily. Boy, I sure was in for some serious disappointment here. Killer songs are hardly present at all, originality is mostly missing, the production is weak (in fact, any production that I point out as weak has to be pretty damn lacking, cause I don't care for it all that often) and does not in any way indicate there's 3 guitarists playing here rather than two, and many songs get old and uninteresting too swiftly. Replay value is low. The vocals aren't overly great in the first place and come out weirdly muffled thanks to the weak production. \n\nThat said, as this is Maiden, there's at least some pretty owning tracks that manage to save them from truly sucking. After all, there's not a single Maiden album that didn't have at least two to three tracks that really owned.\n\nThe truly great tracks are: The immense anti-war-epic Paschendale and the for Maiden rather strange tracks Face in the Sand and Journeyman. Face in the Sand, a dark semi-ballad, probably stands out the most, with its slow intro, a powerful emotional chorus and an even more emotional solo. Paschendale is a massive epic monster and one of the heaviest Maiden tracks around. Journeyman is a grand all-out ballad to finish off the album, and has Bruce doing some damn nice softer vocals - ever since after the World Slavery tour, that's what he was best at anyways, so of course it rules. \n\nOther good tracks would be: The semi-epic No More Lies, which is one of the Maiden songs that suffers from the syndrome that's been around ever sicne Somewhere in Time - overrepeated chorusses (( though fortunately, this is a Virtual XI case of a good chorus overrepeated, not the SiT/SSoaSS type bad chorus overrepeating), but otherwise is pretty good, especially in the verses. Age of Innocence is another slower, softer track leaning towards ballads and manages to work decently. Dance of Death is acceptable and has a brilliant solo, but overlong and fails to stand out and riffs are again overrepeated.\n\nSo, the other tracks then, what about them? Well, they're pretty forgettable at best, and pure feces at worst. Pretty forgettable - Gates of Tomorrow and New Frontier are standard semi-speeder Maiden songs with fast but very plain riffing, and happen to sound almost exactly the same. They sound good for maybe five to ten listens, until they get old and you notice there's really nothing deeper in them. Rainmaker has the best intro riff on the whole album - but after that, all goes horribly wrong, the riffs are getting overrepeated, the vocal lines are bad and the lyrics are worse. Oh man does that chorus blow. Wildest Dreams is worse yet - kinda like Rainmaker but without any good riffing at all, this is sure some crappy opener. Montsegur is the biggest piece of shit on the whole album - starts out with a heavy if simple riff, then degenerates into a poor parade of weak repetitive riffing and the worst vocals Bruce has done ever since Can I Play with Madness.\n\nThere's a lot of weaknesses on here. There's too many bad songs. There's a severe lack of killers. Chorusses are overrepeated, both good and bad ones. The production is inexcusable, seeing how Maiden are just about the biggest metal band around. It might just be my least favorite Maiden album ever. Somewhere in Time and Seventh Son had some of those lackings, but at least they were original, experimental and had good production and many killer riffs and solos, if overrepeated. This album is not good, and mostly useless. Avoid it. Download Paschendale, Face in the Sand, Journeyman and No More Lies, and maybe Age of Innocence - they're worth hearing. Possibly also Dance of Death, for the solo.\n",
        "\nHaving listened to \u201cDance of Death\u201d numerous times over the last couple of years, I thought I might enhance my original review by chiming in with a few general remarks as to whether the album has ultimately stood the test of time. For the most part, my previous conclusion still holds true: after two rather mediocre albums with Bruce Dickinson at the mic and two largely forgettable efforts with vocalist Blaze Baley, Maiden came back in 2000 with a strong release in \u201cBrave New World\u201d and then topped it off with the even better \u201cDance of Death\u201d. As far as songwriting is concerned, Steve Harris and company mostly deliver on this 2003 output, the way they unfortunately didn\u2019t on the two albums with Baley in the lineup. Let\u2019s face it: \u201cThe X-Factor\u201d and \u201cVirtual XI\u201d weren\u2019t bad primarily because of Blaze\u2019s vocals. It\u2019s true that he doesn\u2019t hold a candle to the mighty Air Raid Siren, but then again, what singer does? No, what those two albums lacked in the first place was consistently good, sound songwriting, and sound songwriting is exactly the reason why \u201cDance of Death\u201d is indeed a very good record.\n\nIt doesn't take long to realize that \u201cDance of Death\u201d is an even stronger album than \u201cBrave New World\u201d, mainly because Maiden succeed in avoiding the same mistakes that detracted somewhat from the overall very positive impression left by its predecessor: the choruses are a bit less repetitive (there are some glaring exceptions, unfortunately), there is more heaviness and speed and the trademark guitar harmonies, which were not used nearly enough on \u201cBrave New World\u201d, make a triumphant comeback.\n\nHowever, there are also a couple of downsides to this otherwise excellent record. First of all, the production once again is nowhere near as good as it should be. By now we all know that Kevin Shirley is no Martin Birch \u2013 sadly, he does not even come close. In comparison with the great production Roy Z put together for Bruce\u2019s brilliant solo efforts \u201cAccident of Birth\u201d and \u201cThe Chemical Wedding\u201d, the sound on \u201cDance of Death\u201d is anemic and weak, even more so than on \u201cBrave New World\u201d. It would be really nice, at some point in the future, to see Steve Harris either work with Roy Z (or another top-notch metal producer) or at least give Shirley a little more leeway instead of constantly meddling with his settings during the recording process (at least that's how I'm imagining it), but that will probably never happen. Maiden are and always have been Harris\u2019 baby and he is not exactly known for being open to any outside advice telling him how to handle his business.\n\nAnother downside to \u201cDance of Death\u201d is that it is again a bit overlong \u2013 the final two songs are just not on the same level as the rest of them, as \u201cAge of Innocence\u201d, while otherwise passing as a pretty solid headbanger, has a weak and awkward chorus and rather strange lyrics, and \u201cJourneyman\u201d is just a more or less forgettable ballad. (Note that other reviewers see that particular song as one of the highlights of the album, but I still believe it's rather bland and uneventful.) Luckily, as they did on \u201cBrave New World\u201d, Maiden were smart enough to put the weakest tracks at the very end of the album so as not to make us use the skip button. Anyway, I really believe they would do better to only put eight or nine songs on a record, like they did in the eighties, and save the weaker ones for EPs or single B-sides. After all, a good metal album doesn\u2019t have to run for over an hour \u2013 45 minutes are easily enough, as long as there are no fillers to be found.\n\nThe album starts off with a song called \u201cWildest Dreams\u201d, which may not be very spectacular or inventive but passes as a solid speedy opener \u2013 much in the vein of \u201cBe Quick or Be Dead\u201d and others \u2013 contrasting nicely with some of the more progressive cuts coming later on. The subsequent \u201cRainmaker\u201d, \u201cNo More Lies\u201d (despite its repetitive three-word chorus) and \u201cMonts\u00e9gur\u201d kick off the finest and most consistent part of the album. Particularly the latter is the best song on here and might as well be a leftover from the \u201cPowerslave\u201d recording sessions: it is crushingly heavy and has guitar harmonies galore that almost bring tears of sheer enthusiasm to my eyes every time I hear them, reminding me why Maiden are still one of the most revered bands in the entire metal genre. \u201cDance of Death\u201d and \u201cPaschendale\u201d are the two most complex and progressive songs the album has to offer, and they are both top-notch, even though I think they would have been even better with the keyboards a little lower in the mix and the guitars a little more to the forefront, but that\u2019s probably just me. \u201cNew Frontier\u201d, surprisingly written by drummer Nicko McBrain, is one of those gritty speed metal tunes (think \u201cBack in the Village\u201d) that were largely missing on \u201cBrave New World\u201d, although it doesn't feature much variation and feels somewhat underdeveloped. The hard-rocking \u201cGates of Tomorrow\u201d is another ho-hum affair that feels way too predictable and gets old fast, while \u201cFace in the Sand\u201d is a pounding if largely unspectacular mid-tempo banger featuring some of the best drum work on the entire record.\n\nOverall, while being far from perfect and leaving plenty of room for improvement (which promptly came in the form of \u201cA Matter of Life and Death\u201d), \u201cDance of Death\u201d is a strong release that should please most metalheads and proved once and for all that the reunion with Dickinson was more than just a short-lived cash grab. It is marred by some filler material and the production as well as the artwork (the front cover must be one of the most poorly done Photoshop jobs ever) are definitely sub-standard, but it's also more adventurous and has more truly fulfilling moments than the somewhat tame \u201cBrave New World\u201d. While it's not as good as the two albums that came after it, it serves as further evidence that after so many years in the business, Maiden are still on top of their game and deliver where many of the once-great bands from the eighties simply fall short nowadays.\n\nChoicest cuts: \u201cNo More Lies\u201d, \u201cMonts\u00e9gur\u201d, \u201cDance of Death\u201d, \u201cPaschendale\u201d\n",
        "\nWhen Paul Di'anno was handed the pink slip in 1981 due to his questionable lifestyle, many Maiden fans wondered whether or not the band would be able to successfully soldier on. As we all know, their fears were allayed when Bruce Dickinson was selected to take on vocal duties. The band not only survived--they flourished. Dickinson's powerful and evocative delivery afforded bassist and key songwriter Steve Harris a larger window for creative songwriting. The rest of the world was not slow to pick up on this, as the album shot straight up to #1 on the charts in their native England while the band found themselves embarking on their maiden (pun intended) stateside tour. As hinted at in the title, the band's third volume still packs a wallop, despite having been released over two decades ago. I can't begin to imagine what people thought of this back in 1982.\n\nThings kick off with the fast and furious \"Invaders\", an account of Viking conquests. Proto-speed metal is the name of the game here. After hearing ten to fifteen seconds worth of Bruce's wails, it is clear that he was a vital ingredient in the band's metamorphosis from a promising NWOBHM outfit into a worldwide phenomenon. Despite a fractured chorus, the track does a decent job of setting the tone for the rest of album. The second song, \"Children of the Damned\", begins with a soft, down-tempo intro, to which \"Fade to Black\" owes quite a bit. In my estimation, this song, more than any of the others on the disc, harkens back to the Di'anno days. After some impassioned, melodic vocals from Bruce, the song picks up the pace, and the listener is treated to a rapid-fire solo. Track number three is entitled the \"The Prisoner\" and begins with a clip of the intro from the old television program of the same name, followed by some nice groovy percussion work from now-erstwhile Clive Burr. Not to sound nit-picky, but this song has a more commercial flair than anything that Maiden had came up with thus far; the chorus is decidedly catchy and justs screams 'sing-a-long'. Of particular note is Harris's four-string work, pointing to Geddy Lee influences.\n\nUp next is \"22 Acacia Avenue\", one of the band's more progressive compositions. The sequel to the eponymous debut's \"Charlotte the Harlot\", it is also a considerable improvement. Bruce's delivery borders on raunchy at certain moments, but that is precisely what this tune calls for. There exist a multitude of mood and tempo shifts, bolstering the song's replay value. After the conclusion of this 6 1/2-minute metal triumph, there follows the song that enveloped the band in controversy. Religious figureheads (known as crackpots by us thinking individuals) wrongfully accused Maiden of Satan worship, pointing their fingers at the title track. Things commence calmly enough with a Vincent Price-esque spoken word section taken from the book of Revelations, but shortly after the 1:15 mark, Bruce lets loose with a scream that would rip Roger Daltrey a new one. The chorus was definitely designed with audience participation in mind, and the song has been a mainstay of the band's setlist to this day. Two back-to-back solos, by Dave and Adrian respectively, round out this classic. Maiden's best-known song \"Run to the Hills\" calls this album home, and also has yet to be discarded from live performances. It may be cheesy and radio-friendly, but few things get a crowd pumped up at a Maiden gig more than this fun little number and that instantly-recognizable drum intro.\n\nWhenever a Maiden fan is asked to pick out the weakest link from this album, the majority of replies will be the seventh track, \"Gangland\". I cannot bring myself to disagree with this viewpoint, but the song does not suck or constitute filler by any means. The riffing is relentless and Bruce is in total command here. A noteworthy fact is that Harris does not have a writing credit here; this fun little number was the brainchild of Smith and Burr. \"Total Eclipse\" was not originally found on the original album, but existed as a B-side. The lyrics revolve around the topic of nuclear holocaust, with an apocalyptic-sounding riff accentuating the verses nicely. It is unquestionably a solid track, but the band have saved the best for last. If ever a heavy metal nation was founded, \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\" would doubtlessly be its national anthem. Starting off quietly with some clean guitar and tolling bells, Bruce lucidly paints a picture of man reflecting on his last few hours of living. After about a minute in, the killer riffs begin, quickly joined by Dickinson's fiery wails. Two inspired guitar bridges give the listener a chance to catch a breath before the next verse kicks in. The final lines before the guitar histrionics begin are some of my favorites not just in Maiden's catalogue, but in all of metal, period. How can one NOT get a jolt from hearing \"When you know that your time is close at hand/Maybe then, you'll begin to understand/Life down here is just a strange illusion.\"? A grand finale in every sense of the phrase.\n\nIn spite of all the accolades I've heaped upon the album, I firmly believe that it still plays second-fiddle to 'Powerslave'. By the time that particular album was released, Maiden had honed their craft to a razor-edge and all but had the metal world's balls in a vise grip. That in no way detracts from 'Number', though. It is still a high pick for the foundation of a metal music collection, and not a half-bad album for rock fans to pick up, too.\n",
        "\nSorry, but I can't get myself to rating this album 90 or even higher, for a reason to be explained more clearly below.\n\nThis was Maiden's first live album, recorded at the end of the World Slavery tour, after having released five (all classic) studio albums. The setlist is damn good and in fact close to perfect, and also makes it stand out against the later live albums, as it contains a fair number of tracks not appearing on the those others: Aces High, Revelations, Flight of Icarus, Rime of the Ancient Mariner, Powerslave, 22 Accacia Avenue, Children of the Damned, Die with your boots on and Phantom of the Opera. With the exception of Flight of Icarus (which is fair but overrated) and the final track, all these are in theory brilliant songs and reason enough for having the album. Another big bonus goes to the idea of the intro they had for their tour - Churchill's speech followed by Aces High must have been the ultimate way to start a show. \n\nThat is, if it weren't for one simple problem: Bruce must have totally neglected his warming up practices to get his voice set. There is no other explanation for the fact that his voice sounds utterly bad on the first three tracks of the album and only gets better from Revelations on (though that and the following track are still far from perfectly sung), whilst reaching a very fair sound on the following songs. However, his best performance by far on this album is on CD 2 - he sounds better than in the studio on those songs!!! All other playing was bloody well perfect from the start, by the way - especially the guitars and bass are on a very high standard. I still have to subtract a fair number of points for the poor vocals at the start of the album, though - especially on Aces High, as this is the only non-bootleg live version easily available. \n\nThe tracklist in and on itself is very good - all songs except Flight of Icarus and Phantom of the Opera are among the best that were available to Maiden at the time, and more than half the tracks are exclusive to this album. I do, however, have to criticise that the Killers album was almost entirely left out, except for the one track Wrathchild - the other albums were all honoured with 3-5 tracks each. Also, the excellent Where Eagles Dare is unfortunately notably absent. This, along with the noted lacking in Bruce's vocal performance, keeps me from rating this any higher - and frankly, both of the later major live albums (Live at Donington and Rock in Rio) are overall superior to this one.\n",
        "\n2005, the 25th anniversary of the beast, IRON MAIDEN. The band that has made an insane amount of albums and a fan base that is only probably surpassed by the KISS army(probably) is finally 25. And all those loyal maiden fans are finally rewarded with the DVD release of History of Iron Maiden Part I: The Early Days. This 90 minute documentary covers the entire band's history, starting from the first people of Iron Maiden and running up to the release and tour of 1983's Piece of Mind. This documentary is packed with interviews, concert footage, memorabilia, TV appearances, and other such goodies. Tons of information is contained within, including such shocking revelations that the band was never really too pleased with the sound on the first album, or that Steve Harris never really liked the version of Flight of Icarus that was recorded on the Piece of Mind album The documentary itself is presented on Disc Two, with other special features on Disc One. So let us proceed in numerical orderDisc One has three concert performances. The first, Live At The Rainbow, runs for 30-minutes ,it\u2019s the band as they were touring for their second album, 1981's Killers. The performance features the following set-list: \n\nIdes of March \nWrath child \nKillers \nRemember Tomorrow \nTransylvania \nPhantom of the Opera \nIron Maiden \n\nMoving on to the next performance, we have Beast Over Hammersmith, a thirty-five minute concert capturing the band on tour supporting 1982's The Number of The Beast. This is where they dropped Paul Di\u2019Anno and chose Bruce Dickinson to lead Maiden. Paul was a great vocalist but like many people agree, Maiden was right in choosing Dickinson. Here are the songs that Maiden performed:\n\nMurders in the Rue Morgue \nRun To The Hills \nChildren of the Damned \nNumber of the Beast \n22 Acacia Avenue \nTotal Eclipse \nThe Prisoner \nHallowed Be Thy Name \nIron Maiden \n\nThe final performance on this disc is Live In Portmund, supporting 1983's Piece Of Mind album. This show runs about 36 minutes long, and is surprisingly short on Piece Of Mind tunes (only 3), with 3 songs from The Number of the Beast, and 1 from Killers. Here's the set-list: \n\nSanctuary \nThe Trooper \nRevelations \nFlight of Icarus \n22 Acacia Avenue \nNumber of the Beast \nRun To The Hills \n\nDisk Two contains a shit load of stuff. It has mores shows and an interview and some live performances. So here they are \n\nWomen in Uniform - Top of the Pops - 22/02/80, a three-minute televised performance of their Women In Uniform single. This has always been one of my favorite early-Maiden tunes, and the performance contained her is pretty fuckin raw. \n\nThe next performances are Running Free - Top of the Pops - 13/11/80 and Running Free - Rock and Pop - ZTV Germany 1980, two performances of one Maiden's signature tunes. The first one runs just over two minutes and looks and sounds fairly well, while the second one contains a ton of video noise and ghosting. Plus the quick-cutting is guaranteed to give you a seizure. Stick with the first one, even if the Murray/Smith fretwork is much sweeter on the second \n\nPromo Videos 1980 - 1985 contains five music videos from Maiden's early history: Women In Uniform, Run to the Hills, The Number of the Beast, Flight of Icarus, and The Trooper. There's also an Easter Egg here: highlight \"Extras\" at the bottom of the screen and click down. An icon appears to the right. Click it and see what you can see. \n\nEddie's Lock-Up contains even more archival footage. We start out with Live at The Ruskin, a really early Maiden performance (right around the release of their first album) captured on amateur home video. Don't expect much in terms of picture and sound quality, but what you can expect is a really raw and scrappy performance from an emerging metal talent. The set list for this performance consists of: \n\nSanctuary Wratchchild Prowler \nRemember Tomorrow \nRunning Free \nTransylvania \nAnother Life \nPhantom of the Opera \nCharlotte The Harlot \n\n\nNext we have Steve's Diary - 1975, a collection of text pages from bassist/group founder Steve Harris's 1975 journal. The entries consist mostly of gig and audition information, including how much they received in compensation and how he went to go see the Rocky Horror Show on Friday, August the 20th. Steve's Scrapbook contains stills of gig posters, concert tickets, banners, newspaper clippings, and other such memorabilia related to the band. \n\nMoving into the Discography section, we are treated to a rundown of all the band's albums and singles (up to 1983), including the album covers, release dates, UK Chart Positions, and tracks (both song titles and songwriters listed.) \n\nIn \u201cOn The Road\u201d, we are treated to literally dozens of photographs that detail the history of the band on tour. These are broken down into the following sections: The Early Days, 1980, 1981, 1982, 1983, Tour Programmes, Tour Dates, T-Shirts, Backstage Passes, and Other Artwork. All in all, this DVD is really good. A shit load of performances, interviews, facts, pics, everything that a Maiden DVD should have. This DVD is going to be on every Maidens fans essentials and is a good way to show how Maiden got its start. But as I noticed as I watching this it with my friend, if you don\u2019t like Maiden, you\u2019ll probably think its shit, but if you like Maiden, even the slightest bit, its worth it to go out and buy this DVD and spend sevrel hours infront of your tv staring at the legend that is Maiden.\n",
        "\nSo, it's been fifteen years since your band formed, and two crucial members of your lineup have returned? What is a band to do? Well, Iron Maiden decided to release this monster, almost as if to say \"We're still around, and we're not going away\". From the opening riff to \"The Wicker Man\" (even if it is ripped off) to the closing notes of \"The Thin Line Between Love And Hate\", this album screams excellence. Granted, it took a few listens to some of the slower tunes to really get a feel for them, and the repetitive choruses can be a little irratating, but on the whole, it's a worthy release that's found itself a comfortable home in my player.\n\nThe whole band goes all in one this one. Bruce's vocals seem to actually get stronger as he ages, and he nails everything this album demands of it. Maiden now features three guitarists, as they did not drop Janick Gers or Dave Murray when Adrain Smith returned. Each have their own playng style, and they bring their own touch to the album. This is particularly true of the incredible solos found on every song. As usual, Nicko McBrian's drumwork is top notch, and it provides a powerful backing to the music. Steve Harris throws some strong bass lines at us, and although they often lack the gusto that he showed on earlier Maiden release, it's still a dominant force throughout the album. He also handles the keyboard work.\n\nThe album opens with the Wicker Man, and like most Maiden openers, starts off the album perfectly. Featuring some excellent guitar work, it really sets the tone for the album. However, almost as if a sign of things to come, it has that infamous repetitive chorus that the post-Blaze Maiden has featured on far too many songs.\n\n\"The Ghost Of The Navigator\" is one of those songs that you immediatly know is going to be a live classic. It builds up from the intro inro a great riff. Bruce nails this one vocally, and does this really cool sounding thing in the prechorus where it sounds like he's dragging his voice. The chorus itself is fantastic, almost defying you to not sing along with it. The solo, as per usual, is awesome, and a nice little riff section ties it back to the chorus. All in all, a very strong song.\n\nThe title track slows things down a little bit, but it's still a great song. The song gathers speed as it goes along, gradually drawing you into it. This is one of those songs that take a few listens to truly enjoy, and you'll probably skip it until you really listen to it. However, once you really get into it, it becomes one of the strongest songs on the album. Bruces vocals are nothing short of impressive, and the lyrics are excellent. The solo section, as usual, borderlines on overkill, and is immediatly followed by a ringing guitar riff that really brings it together. The chorus repeats, and the song shortly reverts to the slow verse that opened it.\n\nNext comes \"Blood Brothers\", another slow song. A melodic riff and lead that is typical to new Maiden carry us through the intro and the verse, which leads into yet another repetitive chorus. Harris' bass is very strong during the chorus, but retreats into the background for much of the song. The first solo is short, but after some meandering and build up, the song culminates in a great second solo. However, one solo isn't enough to redeem the song, and overall, it seems like Brave New World if it never picked up. \n\nFinally, Bruce and the boys decide to kick us in the ass. \"The Mercenary\" is a balls-out return to the classic Maiden mix of speed and heaviness that hasn't been seen since \"Futureal\". However, the song suffers from, what else, a repetitive chorus. However, a killer solo section will make you willing to forget all about it, and in the end, the song delivers what it set out to do.\n\n\"Dream Of Mirrors\" has always been a bit of a toss-up for me. Again, it starts out slow, gathering speed as it progresses. It just takes longer this time. The lyrics seem familiar, probably because they released a little song called 'Fear of the Dark' eight years prior, and with yet another painfully repetitive chorus, I find it hard to want to listen to it. However, when it finally does get up to speed, it's a worthy tune. I think the biggest problem with this song is that it's needlessly long. At over nine minutes, I've often found myself wondering if they really needed to repeat the chorus so many times, or wishing that they'd shaved a minute or two off it. But, as the song nears the six minute mark, the song kicks into gear and makes it all worthwhile. In the end, I find this song to be best when you listen to it only on occasion.\n\nAfter \"Dream Of Mirrors\" you're probably wondering when the album will kick into overdrive again, right? Well, you won't have to wait long. \"The Fallen Angel\" is here to kick you in the teeth and ask if you want more. It starts off with a totally badass riff that lets you know what this track is all about, and doesn't let up until it ends. It even features a chorus with more than one line! The solo is one of the best on the album, and towards the end of it, there's some wicked guitar work where the music gives you imagery. It's tough to describe in words, but you'll probably understand what I mean when you hear it. The solo leads back into the chorus, and at the end, Bruce holds the note in that special way that he does so well. Through and through, this song just oozes the good stuff.\n\nAh, \"The Nomad\". Where would this album be without you? It opens up with a great little insrumental section that lasts just over a minute and features a killer lead riff just before the vocals kick in. The song features two (!) choruses that aren't repetitive. The first one is great, but the second one's lyrics kind of pissed me off. More specifically, the last line \"No man's, ever understood your genius\". It just doesn't seem to fit with the rest of the song, and seems a little over the top. However, to redeem it, the first appearance of the second chorus is followed by an immaculate solo section where Adrian and the boys really lay it on you with that desert feel the song is just dripping in. After another verse and chorus, the song drops off into a great melodic lead with keyboards. The song goes back to the verse and chorus, and comes to a close.\n\nNow for the really good stuff. \"Out Of The Silent Planet\" is an absolutely amazing track that really gives you a feel for what Maiden can throw at you. The lyrics are some of the best on the album, and Bruce puts some real oomph into the vocals. More than anything, this song feels like the band has reached their apex, where all cylinders are firing and gives off that spjne-chilling feel of excellent that songs like Hallowed Be Thy Name threw at you. Of course, the soloing is top notch, drives the song forward. All in all, the song is near perfect. I'm even willing to look past the repetitive chorus.\n\nThe album comes to a close with \"The Thin Line Between Love And Hate\". The lyrics are strange, and seem like they were written in high school. the whole song doesn't seem very Maiden-like. That is, until you hit one of the solos scattered throughout the first part. There are a few, and they scream Iron Maiden goodness. However, the song's climax is towards the end, when it kicks into a smart little instrumental section with an incredibly soulful solo. It leads into a wicked lead riff, another great solo, and the riff again. The song slows down again, and comes to a close. The last three minutes of this song are some of the most intelligent I've ever heard from Iron Maiden before, and when it's all over, you want nothing more than to hit play again and listen to the whole thing over again.\n\nOverall, I found the album to be fairly accessible on the first couple listens, and it became deeper and deeper on subsequent play-throughs. Depsite the repetitive choruses, this album is very strong, and heralds in the post-Blaze era of Iron Maiden. Keep it coming, guys.\n",
        "\nOn this you get absolutely tons of corking stuff! I am going to review them individually so you can see the full package: -\n\n\nLive at the rainbow\n\nThis is a nice performance, merely 30 minutes in length but what we get is a nice early snippet of what maiden was all about. Best thing is that 'Killers' on here is the one with the original lyrics before they changed them for the recording, so you get to not only hear it but see it for the first time in years. Add a blistering performance of 'Transylvania' which features tons of impromptu shredding and you have a cracking start to this collection.\n\nBeast Over hammersmith\n\nThis has been demanded for absolutely years and now finally we have it, albeit a 45 minute version rather than the complete article, but thanks to new lighting processes we are now able to see this landmark performance. The band are really playing brilliantly and it is nice to see songs such as 'Number of the beast' during the middle of a set rather than predictably in encores.\n\nLive in Dortmund\n\nThis is a very nice performance with the band really going for it. Loses points because the German tv company deleted the footage of the band Murdering Eddie, but even so it is nice to finally have some footage from the Piece of mind era. \n\nThe early Days (documentary)\n\nNow THIS is possibly one of the greater parts of the DVD, think along the lines of the 'number of the beast' dvd and you have a rough idea of what to expect. Only we have brand new interviews including footage of band members from before 1980 for the first time in over 20 years! We are also treated to some very rare photographs of the band too which gives an even greater idea of what stories lie behind the Maiden name. 90 minutes long and highly entertaining, well worth it.\n\n20th century Box\n\nWell it's only 20 minutes, kind of funny, but Danny Baker is lame, so less said the better\n\nLive at the ruskin\n\nOH YEEEEEEEAH!!! Finally footage of maiden decimating a London Pub! This is gloriously untouched so we are treated to single camera footage, with the only embellishments as far as I can see being some touch ups to the sound. This is a quality gig, also features the only known video footage of the song 'Charlotte the harlot', for fans this show is an absolute must!\n\nExtras\n\nMixed bag this, the TOP of The Pops appearances are nice as thye haven't seen light of day on television for over 20 years, but I fail to see the need to include the official promo videos, what with 'Visions of the beast' being released last year and all, ah well, there has to be a fault somewhere and this is it.\n\nThe hidden extras are some hilarious extra intervie scenes, a little hint for you all, try to find the 'ammers...\n",
        "\nWell, I've had this album for about a week, and I'm left wondering why Iron Maiden bothered to release this compilation album. It's tracklist bears staggering resemblance to the single CD version of The Best Of The Beast I already own, and it suffers from some glaring ommisions; namely, Hallowed Be Thy Name and Afraid To Shoot Strangers.\n\nConsidering Maiden's impressive list of studio albums, it's safe to assume that it's impossible to narrow their best down to 16 songs. What's worse is the quesionable selection of songs. I can't help but wonder why songs like The Wicker Man are on here. Sure, its a great song, but was it worth leaving off a much more deserving song? If they wanted to ensure a Brave New World song on the album, why not use something like ghost Of The Navigator?\n\nHowever, all is not lost. The inclusion of the Rock In Rio version of Fear Of The Dark scores some points, if only for hearing a quarter million screaming fans singing along with Bruce. \n\nAnother thing that really dissapoints me is the packaging. When I buy a best of album, I expect to be treated to a booklet full of rare pictures and other goodies. You know, kind of like Best Of The Beast. However, when I crack open Edward The Great, i'm greated with lame cover art, and shiny pages with the lyrics accompanied by a handful of pictures of the band. Less than impressive.\n\nOverall, the album left me feeling cheated. It reminds me a whole lot of Iced Earth's \"The Blessed And The Damned\". A pointless best-of album with a poor tracklist and a tendancy to leave the buyer feeling that the CD was completely needless. At least Iced Earth can say that they had no say in the release of the album. \n\nThe bottom line: Stick to one of the other best-of albums, or at least pick up a live album if your looking for a collection of songs spanning thier career.\n",
        "\nFear of the Dark, the second album without guitarist Adrian Smith and the last with Bruce Dickinson until a few years later. People have different opinions on this album, but almost everyone can agree it's nowhere near their best. I guess to put it simply: this would be quite a good album.... if it wasn't Iron Maiden.\n\nOK, on to the argument, it definitely has some great moments, but those are mixed with equally horrible ones.\n\nBad points include songs such as Chains of Misery and From Here to Eternity (and I'm sure I'm missing a couple more) that have that standard 80's/90's \"crowd chorus\", for lack of a better term, making the songs sound like generic rock, although From Here to Eternity's chorus is almost catchy enough to be a cool song. The other problem of course is Bruce's raspy voice, which is just plain terrible compared to other albums he's been on. It's perceived by many as being obvious that Bruce just wanted out of the band.\n\nOn the other hand, you've first got Childhood's End, a song that, besides just being cool, has an awesome chorus that I myself consider very similiar to some of Dance of Death's choruses. Fear of the Dark is the most popular and well-known song on the album that has become one of the most popular live songs. This is for good reason, it creates an awesome atmosphere (that some compare to Dance of Death) and great riff(s), simply a great song and simply the gem of the album.\n\nOverall, the album could use some Adrian Smith and no Janick Gers (Adrian's replacement). Bruce Dickinson's performance is arguably his worst of any album as well. In my and many other's opinion, this is one of the four worst Iron Maiden albums (but by no means THE worst), along with No Prayer For The Dying, X Factor and Virtual XI. Curiously, those are all of the Maiden albums from the 90's.\n\nTo put it bluntly, if you don't have Maiden's first 7 albums and their latest 2 (those are questionable be several people), you have no need to get this album.\n",
        "\n.. this is the last phrase pronounced by the English minister Winston Churchill after Iron Maiden bangs the stage with the unmistakable riff from Aces High; and we are introduced by Bruce's \"Air Raid Siren\" to what would be the most fantastic hour and a half of Heavy Metal Maidenesque galloping music.\n\nALL the songs here are best known as Maiden classics; and I'll go as far as to name them anthems of Heavy Metal music. This video also features a chilling epic which is Rime Of The Ancient Mariner.. Dave Lights and all the crew here surelly have made a big effort during this song to set the mood, with impressive lightwork and even some \"fog\" thrown upon the stage during the slower section of the song.\n\nThe stage set is also impressive, which is the best I've seen so far. Only somewhat matched with the great performance that the last Iron Maiden show (on Dance of Death World Tour) put up, since both feature an enormous Eddie, and who doesn't like to see that?.\n\nThe audience is cool, but not the best.. Sincerely I haven't seen any American audience to be really \"into the show\" with sing-a-longs choruses (except in Two Mins. To Midnight) and loud screams, and this is not the exception. Good thing is that Bruce plays a lot with the audience and this makes it have a more relevance feeling into the whole set.\n\nOverall, this is a VHS which I don't regret. The classical Maiden stunts are here; the songs are excellently performed and Maiden sure have a unique vibe when seen live. So if you can catch up with this, don't hesitate in giving it a chance. It's well worthed.\n",
        "\nIn 1988, Maiden released their mellowest, most epic and most transcendent album in Seventh Son of a Seventh Son. But instead of giving fans another dose of the same medicine, the band threw their keyboards into the fire and got back to the gritty basics. The result is one of the best albums in heavy metal: \"No Prayer for the Dying.\" \n\nThe album sound is dirty. Bruce replaces his comfortable clean voice with his best impression of a bat getting raped by UDO. Musicially, the songs are stripped-down and not as epic. Even the closer Mother Russia isn't really an epic by Maiden standards. This would be a problem.... if not for the fact that the songs fucking rock. This album is the perfect blend of mandatory Maiden metal and down-and-dirty hard rock. The songs stick to a verse-chorus, verse-chorus format, but who cares? The verses fucking rule and the choruses will have even mutes singing in the shower. \n\nYou don't have to sift too deep through the dirt to find Maiden's trademark sound. The band's twin guitar harmonies rear their heads in tracks like \"No Prayer for the Dying\" and midway through \"Fates Warning.\" The title track appears surprisingly early and is refleshingly concise: it's a rare example of Maiden in ballad form, with Bruce crooning his way through each sorrowful verse. \"Assassin\" has an \"I'm Watching You\" vibe that will make you get up and close the curtains. \"Bring Your Daughter...\" sounds much better here than on the Nightmare on Elmstreet 5 soundtrack. Martin Birch strips the track down, taking away the B-horror production and cheesy backing vocals. \n\n\"Mother Russia\" marks the first time that Maiden experimented with the sounds of a foreign country (they would later tackle the Middle East with Nomad and achieve equal success). Female backing vocals build a misty mood, before heavier guitars implore the listener to dance Russian-style---don't spill the vodka. Lyrically, you can expect more profanity and anger, with politicians and TV evangelists falling prey to the beast. Anger carries the vocal-driven \"Holy Smoke,\" until Jannick introduces himself with a scorching solo. \n\nWith \"No Prayer,\" Maiden took a gamble that paid off a millionfold. Sure they lost some fans (\"Boo hoo! This is too raw. Where's the cleanliness of Seventh Son?\"), but these people are pussies that are better off listening to Michael Bolton records on their parents dusty turntables. Painkiller? Rust in Peace? These albums have their supporters, but \"No Prayer for the Dying\" is the true hero of 1990.\n",
        "\nThis is a collector's item aimed at a niche part of the iron maiden fan world. For the casual listener there is really nothing new in this box. You get tracks from the new album, a thin booklet and little else.\n\nFor the fans this is an essential rarity, you get the Iron Maiden wristband but you also get some great stuff.\n\n'Paschendale (orchestral)' - is pretty good, nowhere near the blinding remix of 'dance of death' on the 'rainmaker' single but still a good listen, spoiled a bit as the orchestral parts drown out some of the guitars, but it is great to hear things such as the choir and horns which weren't as audible in the mastering of Dance of Death\n\nJourneyman (electric) - Now this is astonishing, the guitars work amazing well with some brilliant leads courtesy of Adrian Smith. Still no real solo (although Adrian did an awesome spanish/blues one live!) of such but alot here and the feel is captured exceptionally well. Fans are divided over whether this version is actually better than the album version. I prefer to abstain and instead revel in the bliss of two excellent versions of one very good song.\n\nAge of innocence (how old?) - Now this is well funny, Nicko must be the most randomly insane guy to feature in line-up anywhere. Some of the stuff he comes out with while singing just makes me crack up. To quote, 'Go on davey old son!' and 'There's no innocence in that solo is there!' This is a listen once and laugh hysterically scenario.\n\nAs I said in the title this is not for the casual listener, die-hards need only apply for this. The video for 'No more lies' is also nice, a shame that it isn't 100% live but the fusion of studio over live footage is done much better than on any other attempt (most notable being 'Stranger in a strange land' and 'Fear of the dark'). I think this is worth owning if you can find it, it is strictly limited edition and there are no more commerically being pressed, if you want to collect a modern day rarity this will serve you well.\n",
        "\nThe first thing that should be made clear about this 2 DVD set is that it is essential for anyone who doesn't own any old VHS tapes with the Iron Maiden videos on. And even if you own the enhanced reissues with the CD-ROM videos on, you should get it anyway, for increased video quality and some that were not present on the CDs. There are a couple missing such as the live clips from around the first couple of albums and the Live After Death footage (the Live After Death video should get reissued as a DVD!). No biggie though.\n\nThe older VHS owners and Maiden fans could probably live without owning this. The few Camp Chaos videos as extras really don't hold up as strongly as the originals to make them necessary material, though the end of the Aces High video featuring Lars just has to be seen I suppose! They're enough for a few chuckles. The menu kind of takes a moment to work out what you're doing, you have to select the various Eddie heads to find out what section of the DVD they are for, which is kind of unnecessary.\n\nIt is pretty much every Maiden promo video made, from the low budget early vids, through the kind of dated and restricted special effects of the mid 80s classics, through the kind of lavish sets covering the mediocrity of some of the early 90s period, and finally though the tacky, outdated CG of the late Blaze era to a stop after Rock In Rio. It's a mix up of super classics, some other fairly fun songs and some tripe too. I got a glimpse of the eras of the band after Seventh Son before making that plunge into buying the albums. And also put me off the Blaze Bayley albums for all eternity, except Futureal, a good song and good enough video. I'll otherwise probably never watch them again (I did try, and watched them all several times!). There's much fun to be had still, it's not all a reapeat of \"The Angel and the Gambler\" and it's tired and outdated CG showing off. The Wicker Man is not perhaps as good as it might have been, I just can't get into the feel of it so much, but love the song. The early 90s videos have a lot of redeeming qualities, such as the pure comedy and silliness of \"Holy Smoke\", featuring Steve Harris playing bass on a moving tractor, Dave Murray performing a blistering solo whilst standing in a stream complete with wellies, topping it all off with Bruce's facial expressions and it makes the song a little more than it probably would be on album. The smutty old early 90s feel of \"From Here To Eternity\" does a decent enough job to the same effect. The older videos should really need no reviewing, each is a classic despite their age and budget, and are always great to watch. It may be a gateway into Maiden though no \"greatest hits\" package, I don't think there has been one from this band I've been satisfied with anyhow. \n\nI think that a potential fan of Iron Maiden should pick some albums first, then heed this recommendation to go out and buy it. Far from perfect with a little disappointment on the menu and extras side, there's not too much and those Camp Chaos vids gets tired after a while. It's the best thing if you don't want to spend your time and money locating those old out of print VHS copies, which for a newer or less than die hard fan probably won't be a priority.\n",
        "\nSince this format is out of print, you will most probably go out of your way to find it. And since you will, you should go after the limited 2cd box version, for it simply is amazing. \n\nThe cover is made by none other than Derek Riggs, who, being bored of drawing Eddie covers, wrote \"Not Again!\" on the tombstone on the cover, which EMI forced him to change to \"Eddie 1975-?\" It is a nice overview of a bunch of Eddies who are out to get you!\n\nThe tracklist is something intresting for the old and new fan alike. The old fan can find the great new track \"Virus\", Blaze's awsome live rendition of \"Afraid To Shoot Strangers\" (probably the only Bruce-era song where he does a better job than Bruce himself!) \"Strange World (1979)\" (it was the first time this saw the light of day since it was scrapped from the original Sounhouse Tapes\" and \"Iron Maiden (1979)\" from the Soundhouse Tapes... A great treat for the old fans...\n\nAlso, the tracklist is balanced through all of Maiden's releases up and until The X Factor, containing tracks in live and studio form, from all periods, with a nice and fluent regressing succession order which is sure to intrigue the new fan into Maiden....\n\nThe packaging has only one flaw. Nobody wants to store these cds in a cartboard pocket! It WILL get scratched. Store cds seperately. The booklet is AWSOME (fat and harcover too!) and will leave you browsing it for hours, it has tons of visuals and photos. Check it out a couple of times and then shrink wrap it! I have done so with mine and the packaging has been in great shape since 1996 when I bought it. BUY OR DIE!\n",
        "\nOut of the silent planet is a song from Brave New World that truly sounds like something fresh and new from the boys, a nice contrast to their older works. The b-sides are FANTASTIC live versions from the Ed Huntour. Infact, by collecting all the singles from BNW, you get a nice little collection of 6 tracks from that tour. The band is at the top of their game again, and anybody can realise that by comparing the Wasted Years version on this single with the one on the 1993 Hallowed Be Thy Name (Live) single! The cover on the digipack version is the WORST Eddie in history, plus a guy on it is wearing a Calvin Klein t-shirt, how metal is that?!\n",
        "\nThis is a great live release, the band are at a critical point in their career, having just released one of their strongest albums ever and on possibly their best tour ever (bar the Seventh Son tour perhaps). The band sound uniformly great, Bruce Dickinson has a youthful energy and has a scarily enormous lung capacity. Truly one of the best ever Heavy Metal frontmen, he's full of energy and sounds great all the way through. Another great thing about this album is the bass. It has a very loud mix which really allows you to appreciate Steve Harris' intricate Basslines, which is a good thing, I promise you. Adrian Smith and Dave Murray shred on guitars, excellent as always and always in perfect unison (comparable to Tipton-Downing duo). And Nicko McBrain on drums. I've always liked his style of playing, maybe more than Clive Burr. (He's crazier, faster and more technical anyway, and I like that) Nicko has a great performance, amazing with only one bass drum.\n\nThe tracklist is great, covers all the early classics (you wish they'd play 'Killers' though, that would make it even better), and some heavy tunes from the last few albums. Personal highlights for me are 'Phantom of the Opera' (not on the original vinyl or CD, its on the bonus second disc of the remastered CD). It's a pity that so many of these songs get played on later live albums, because they start to lose their freshness if you listen to this as well as Iron Maiden's other live releases. But of course those tracks are arguably the best tracks on this album. The Trooper, Run to the Hills, 2 Minutes to Midnight and Hallowed Be Thy Name fall into this category. (They sound great on Rock in Rio too, mind!)\n\nThe only thing that prevents me from giving this 100 is Bruce's performance on opener Aces High. Although he sounds really great throughout the song, if you want to be technical he doesn't quite hit all the high notes. Actually, that's not to say he doesn't sound great, as I don't think anyone else in the world could if they sang like he did, and he does make a really good job of it, but it is a slight gripe that bothers some people, like my brother. (He makes that his reason for preferring Rock in Rio to this release). But apart from that, absolutely flawless performance that will creep its way into your CD player again and again. Buy it now, you won't be disappointed, and I really mean it this time.\n",
        "\nI know I may have given all my Maiden reviews 100% before (which is why I think my last one was rejected) but I really think that if only 1 Maiden album could get 100% it would without any doubt at all be Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son. An absolute masterpiece from beginning to end, I will go through all the tracks and my opinions of them in order.\n\nMoonchild: An amazing introduction song, and my favourite on the album, the \"7 deadly sins...\" part followed by the synth intro is a great indication of the great song and album to follow.The lyrics are based on the \"Liber Samekh\" ritual supposedly used by The Beast to attain knowledge for it's holy guardian, a very fitting subject for the band that wrote Number Of The Beast! Moonchild is a great indication that the Bruce\\ Adrian team that wrote 2 Minutes To Midnight didn't just stop there.\n\nInfinite Dreams: Continuing the mystical theme of prophecies and visions of the album, Infinite Dreams is about a person who is trapped inside tormenting dreams every time they fall asleep, and is now afraid to fall asleep at all. There is also the question of what happens after death, and the possibility of reincarnation. The last single to be released, Infinite Dreams reached number 6 in the charts, at the same time as Maiden England was released at number 1.\n\nCan I Play With Madness: A short song, and the debut single from the album, it is one of the least popular on the album, but strangely enough had the highest chart position, at number 3. It sounds very optimistic, like the later song Wildest Dreams, but the lyrics are about someone who goes to a prophet to learn the future, and finds that his \"souls gonna burn in a lake of fire\" which doesn't really fit with the optimism the music conveys. A video was also released, featuring a teacher, who after offending Eddie by confiscating a Maiden magazine from a pupil, is trapped in a labyrinth full of strange artifacts, and at the end of the song, presumably dies.\n\nThe Evil That Men Do: The 2nd single from 7th Son,reaching number 5, this is a classic Maiden song about a guy who is dismayed at slaughtering the innocence of his girlfriend, believes he is evil and is committing all sorts of rituals to try and redeem himself. A firm favourite with many, the song is classic Maiden at it's most typical.\n\nSeventh Son Of A Seventh Son:An absolute epic masterpiece, this is based on a book called 7th Son, by Orson Scott Card, and is about the abilities of prophecy supposed to be controlled by someone in the position of the title. The song also talks of the struggle between good and evil to control him (as in Moonchild, \"Moonchild, you'll be mine soon child, Moonchild, take my hand tonight\"), and the part his brothers play in shaping his destiny. An excellent song, this is an epic to rival Hallowed Be Thy Name and Rime Of The Ancient Mariner. Full of atmosphere as well, this is the highlight of the album.\n\nThe Prophecy: Following on from the title track, this is about what happens when the seventh son is grown up, and prophecises the destruction of his village by dark forces, but he is ignored by the villagers, who then blame him when the disaster happens. A short song, The Prophecy finishes with a fading out acoustic riff.\n\nThe Clairvoyant: Starting with a bass riff that seems to pick up from the end of The Prophecy, the Clairvoyant was the 3rd single, reaching number 6. It is a song relating to Doris Stokes, wondering if she can foresee her own death, as shown in the lines, \"couldn't foresee his own demise\", obviously replacing Doris Stokes with a male character but retaining the principle. The favourite song from the album live, this is still a great favourite, like Die With Your Boots On or Heaven Can Wait, as was shown on the Give Me Ed Till I'm Dead tour.\n\nOnly The Good Die Young: Concluding the album, this tells of how corrupt and sinful people are, and is given in the form of a sort of lecture, as from an angel, finishing with the lines:\"So I think I'll leave you, with your visions and your guilt, and until the next time have a good sin\", giving the impression that the deliverer of the speech doesn't expect the guilt to last long. Another great song with a great solo and a catchy chorus, Only The Good Die Young finishes off the album nicely, featuring the \"7 deadly sins...\" part again at the end, only replacing \"and your trip begins\" with a sinister little laugh from Bruce, indicating that you've already gone down the sinful route to hell.\n\nAn amazing album all in all, 7th Son Of A Seventh Son reached number 1, the first album to do so since, Number Of The Beast, and showed the successfulness of Maidens' experimentation with synthesisers. All the songs that weren't singles tell the story of the 7th son, and the singles are related diversions, enclosed between 2 \"7 deadly sins...\" parts in Moonchild and Only The Good Die Young, this album is one of Maiden's best accomplishments, as was shown by the band's invitation to Donington and the subsequent video from Birmingham NEC Maiden England.\n\nUP THE IRONS!!!\n",
        "\nI didn't think it was possible for Iron Maiden to make a compilation worth owning, or thats any good at all. Here we have Ed Hunter, aside from having a great song selection, it comes with (at the time) a great video game with pretty good graphics. It was a smart idea to have the fans vote for their favorite Iron Maiden songs, instead of having Iron Maiden make another compilation that doesn't have the songs the fans want on it. I give them alot of credit for that. This and perhaps Best of The Beast are the only Iron Maiden compilations that are worth owning if you don't have their complete discography. Most Maiden Fans have all their albums so usually Maiden compilations are worthless if they don't have unreleased material on it, in this case a video game. Whats nice is that this little package is between 20-30 dollars in a major chain store like best buy or sam goody, and it comes with a game, most games are like 50 bucks, so the value is unquestionalby good.\n\nThe music on this album is also great, having all great Maiden tracks up to Virtual XI, without having to many from one album on this. It has the best version of Iron Maiden, done live by Bruce on vocals. A nice Hidden track with Bruce on vocals for Wrathchild. Plus a bunch of classics like Fear of The Dark, Hallowed Be Thy Name, Run To The Hills, The Trooper, these are essential songs for a compilation. Then the great forgotten tracks like Stranger In A Strange Land and Waster Years, tracks usually left off of Iron Maiden Compilations, see the fans know what they are doing.\n\nI think this is a great Iron Maiden compilation, most Maiden comps suck like 17 Numbers By The Beast and Edward The Great. I would rate this up there with Best Of The Beast. Worth owning if you want a now outdated Iron Maiden themed Dom style game, or if your Iron Maiden albums are only few.\n",
        "\nThis song contains all of the qualities of a classic Maiden song. A very catchy main riff, fast paced with a good rhythm and intriguing lyrics on an interesting topic which make you want to sing along. If you're a Maiden fan this definitely belongs in your collection, I would also reccomend it to anybody wishing to get in to this band as it is as good a place as any to begin.\n\nComparing this to their previous single release this is much, much better. Wildest Dreams is a decent album track but not worthy of being a single in my opinion and not a good indication of the albums content in general.\n\nMy only real disappointment is the b-sides, which like the wildest dreams single sound liked they were cobbled together, because they were needed. Sure Dance of Death (Track 2) is a great song, but who wants to hear a version only very slightly different to the one on the album? Track 3, More Tea Vicar is good novelty value, but again it\u2019s a case of listen to it once and forget it. I don\u2019t understand this as Maiden surely has hundreds of live tracks worthy of inclusion. If you can, pick up a copy of the DVD version. This has good versions of classic songs The Wicker Man and Children of the Damned.\n",
        "\nThis is the most entertaining dvd you can own. Not just for the music, which is great, but also all the great bloody and gory magic tricks. With seventeen songs on the album, and I would say around 30-45 minutes of gore, magic tricks, and humar, this is the best Iron Maiden Dvd and the most entertaing dvd of all time.\n\nDuring this live preformance there are two stages, one stage with Iron Maiden preforming on it, and another stage with Simon Drake preforming brutally gory (without being totaly sick and lacking taste) magic tricks every two to four songs (between them). The magic tricks range from Mr. Drake stabing his arm with a knife to him decapitating Bruce Dickinson and Nicko trying to save him but running out of breath after 3 steps cause he is old and out of shape. They are very impressive, they all look very real even in front of a 1000-1500 plus audience (kinda small for maiden). The best magic trick is when Simon Drake puts a sack over Dave Murray's head and uses this 300 year old torcher machine to cuf off his hands, then Mr. Drake takes Dave's hands and plays Dave's guitar with them on stage with maiden, histerically funny. These little interludes between songs make this dvd so damn entertaining, they make me want to watch the dvd as much as the live concert.\n\nOnto what really matters with this dvd, the live preformance. While its not as good as quality (acoustically, visually its great) as Rock In Rio, it captures very well what Maiden was like at the \"height\" of thier career. Its also nice that Maiden ditched the spandex (except Nicko) and Bruce got rid of those girly bangs. The preformance is full of energy, as typical with Maiden, Yanick is jumping all over the place, Stave Harris Jumping up and down with this pissed off look on his face, and Bruce Running around everywhere, and its funny when he starts messing with Nicko's drums (they really seem to pick on him in this preformance). Aside from a great visual preformance, many of the songs are played great ( a few of the songs I have trouble hearing Bruce's vocals, but thats maybe like 3 to 4 songs). The Trooper is play well, Hallowed Be They Name the guitar work is amazing, the band plays it so coherantly and in your face. Fear of the dark and Bring Your Daughter...To The Slaughter may be the best songs here, they have good crow participation, and Bring Your Daughter...To The Slaughter Bruce does alot of improvising, which makes it more enjoyable since its something different from the studio album. The last four tracks (the ones not shown on the pay-per-view) are absolutly amazing. The songs are all played well and sound different enough from the studio songs. The fans go on stage for some reason and Bruce lets a few sing the Chorus, until security gets them. On Sanctuary the crowd does alot of cool stuff, singing along and such. The band closes with a great version of their trademark closing song Iron Maiden. The last four songs are the definate draw of the album.\n\nGreat live versions of the songs here make this dvd great. The magic tricks by Simon Drake make this dvd so much more than just a live preformance. The length of this dvd is great as well almost two hours. The dvd controls are easy and simple to use...I just wish there was like a behind the scenes or extras or something. Other than that this is the most entertaining Maiden dvd, or dvd of any band really, that I have seen or that I think I will see.\n",
        "\n...this 'thank you', commemorative, celebratory, whateverthefuckyouwanttocallit E.P. is substandard.\n\nTo start with, the 'thank you' requires the listener to purchase a four track E.P. and get a whole heap of exclusive stuff in return. The one I got cost me 6.50 English Pounds, which is less than what you'd expect to get it for in larger stores like HMV and Virgin. Did I get any value for money?\n\n1. No More Lies: Studio version. Heard it on the album. Generic Steve Harris epic. Overlong late-90s-trying-to-be-brooding bass intro (c.f. Fortunes of War, Don't Look to the Eyes of a Stranger, The Clansman, The Educated Fool, yawn, yawn). Repetitive chorus (c.f. Fortunes of War, Don't Look to the Eyes of a Stranger, The Clansman, The Educated Fool, yawn, yawn), solo by Adrian Smith saves this one. Good on the live tour, but here in it's dull format in the studio. Worthless. Value so far: \u00a30.00\n\n2. Paschendale (Orchestral). Damn you Kevin Shirley. Firstly, you manage to roll over like a dog and allow 'Arry to fuck you in the arse with his textbook songs which have been done to death (Dream of Mirrors, The Gonad, Blood Brothers). Secondly, you decide to alter the volume settings on a couple of songs and pass them off as 'alternate versions' for release on singles. Twat. Piss off back to Dream Theater and produce some of their limp-wristed wankfests like you did so expertly on Metropolis. Totally shit, barely different from the album version, which is massively over-rated anyway. I'm deducting a pound.\n\n3. Journeyman (Electric version). Ah yes, that's better. I don't know how the hell the acoustic version made the final cut for the album, because this one beats it hands down. Not a concrete solo as such, but loads of lead fills (mostly, if not all, by Adrian) all over the song. A bit of slide guitar to start and a slightly more open composition and arrangement. It's basically a much less boring version than on the album and nicely ambient. Plus 2 quid.\n\n4. Age of Innocence...How Old? Hidden track at the end of Journeyman. It's exactly the same music mix fom the studio, with Bruce's vox cut out and drummer Nicko McBrain ad libbing over the top. Mildly amusing, but not much point if you ask me. I'll give it 25p for novelty value.\n\nVideo/DVD - this is a 'live' version of No More Lies from the Dance of Death European tour. However, the music itself is from the studio version just with the audience spliced onto the top and a few chorus sections cut in favour of the crowd singing 'No More Lies'. Good video actually. Been shown on Kerrapp! numerous times though so you've probably all seen it. Another 25p? Yeah go on then...\n\nThere's a wristband in the package too so you can prance around your bedroom pretending to be one of the Maidenites if you really want to. Hmmm, \u00a31, if that.\n\nSo, total worth of the package? I would say something trite like \"you do the math\" but I'll spell it out: \u00a32.50 tops = NO VALUE. Literally all you would want to hear is the electric version of Journeyman which is pretty good. Download this, it should be available on soulseek/kazaa lite as I type.\n\n'Thank You' EP? More like 'Fuck You'. Carry on filling the coffers of Sanctuary Towers, it's time for a re-read of The Metal Fetus methinks...\n",
        "\nWhats better than Iron Maiden's live album Rock in Rio? The dvd. This is one of the best live dvds I have seen. The production is great, top notch. The millions of camera angles make it just amazing. This is the best Maiden dvd out there.\n\nThe main things that seperate this from other live dvds is the production value and the insane amount of different cameras the band was filmed with. There are so many different angles and the band playing on this dvd it never gets boring. Sometimes on dvds bands have around 5 different angles and it can get kinda boring. Here though all the most of the camera's are moving so you hardly ever see similiar shots of the band played. Also the stage is huge which allows the band to move around so much, this is a plus. Iron Maiden isn't a band that goes crazy and bangs their head while playing guitar or bass (standing in one spot) like Behemoth or Amon Amarth. Thats why the large stage on this dvd makes the band more entertaining. You can watch them run all overthe place, or you can watch Yanick kick stuff, its great. Then there is Bruce running around jumping off stuff like a madman and still singing like a champ. \n\nTo talk about the music breifly since I allready did that in my review of the live album. These songs sounda million times better than the studio versions, especially the older ones. Its also great seeing Bruce play the Blaze songs...since I hate Blaze's vocals. The band adds energy to the songs as well as intensity with their stage presence. The best thing is the band isn't affraid to be sloppy. In other words they sacrifice playing the songs perfectly for added energy and enjoyment. There is nothing more boring than a band trying so hard to play so well...and in the process they don't move around a whole lot. Not the case here, the band doesn't care and they songs come out well with something to offer the studio songs don't.\n\nThe fans in audience are great too. The all seem so into the music, headbanging, jumping, singing along. Its a sea of crazy brazilian fans having a great time and adding to the energy of this release. Ocaisionally the dvd shows some fans making hilarious faces, its so funny.\n\nThis is the Maiden dvd to buy, quality work. I have no problems with this release.\n",
        "\nThis box set is perfect if you don't own the Maiden albums here. You get the albums plus bonus tracks. That is one sweat deal. Of course this is a huge waste of money if you allready own the first five Maiden Cds. Alot of bands just package their previous albums together and call it a limited edition box set. But the problem with that is the box set material can be bought elsewhere. At least maiden offers some rare material previously unreleased. Whats also nice is that Maiden slipt this up into two different releases. So even if you own Maiden albums, but none on her, this is still a good buy. Most bands suck at making box sets, but Maiden Time and Time again prooves that they can do them well (Eddie Head, this one parts one and Two). There really ins't anything I can think of that is bad about this set, perfect for fans who don't own their old albums. I have seen it on Ebay a few times, its not to hard to get.\n",
        "\nI think its great when bands make box sets...but the problem is most of them suck. This one doesn't. The band doesn't include worthless singles...or stuff that you can't purchase anywhere else without buying the box set. Its rather annoying when a band releases a pricing box set with stuff it in that long time fans allready own, then a single cd with rare trax that is not available by itself. Thus forcing many fans to waste 100 bucks on something the almost allready own. Iron Maiden did not do that hear at all.\n\nWhats done so well on the box set is that it all the albums in this box set are available by themselves. The band doesn't include special releases of the albums either, which is good because you can get the exact same albums in this box set seperatly. Another reasons its good is because it doesn't have any bad maiden releases in it. Not that there are any really. But your not getting any crap with it, and buying the box set is a bit cheaper than buying them induvigually. So its good for a new fan who wants the collection. Plus it comes with some cool pictures and a badass box with eddie on it. If I didn't own any maiden albums I would buy this in a heart beat. Even if I owned 2 or 3 I would stiff buy it. I like how they included the live albums as well.\n",
        "\nHere's the deal folks. Maiden packaged all of their videos, many of which never saw any airplay of any kind, into one big two disc set, with some nice menu's and a few extra's. Now, to review the thing.\n\nThe songs themselves are for the most part fantastic as you'd expect, this comp actually featuring more of Maiden's best than the atrocious Edward the Great hits pack released last year. You can't deny a rolecall like this: \"The Trooper\", \"Aces High\", \"2 Minutes to Midnight\", \"The Flight of Icarus\", \"The Wicker Man\", \"Be Quick or Be Dead\", \"Wrathchild\", \"Wasted Years\", \"Fear of the Dark(live)\", \"Hallowed Be Thy Name(live)\", \"Run to the Hills\", \"The Evil That Men Do\", \"Infinite Dreams\", \"Stranger in a Strange Land\"... okay, I need to sit down. Anyway, Iron Maiden has a catalogue that stands in that hallowed land of the truly iconic. Their early albums (Iron Maiden thru Piece of Mind) are unbelievable. They're untouchable.\n\n*cough*\n\nHowever, their videos are quite emphatically touchable. The video's range from good (\"Holy Smoke\", \"Be Quick or Be Dead\", \"The Wicker Man\", \"2 Minutes to Midnight\") to the laughably bad (\"The Angel and the Gambler\", \"From Here to Eternity\", \"Virus\", \"Women in Uniform\"). I mean, man, what were they thinking with the Blaze videos? Iron Maiden has had a hard-on for CGI for a while now (check Ed Hunter *bleech*), but man those are some bad effects. \"Man on the Edge\" at least has some cool band shots, but \"Angel and the Gambler\", all six or seven minutes of it, is almost completely CGI. And it's AWFUL.\n\nAnd it's not just the new ones that suck. Look at \"The Number of the Beast\". Nonsensical clap-trap, and what was going on with Bruce's hair? The Piece of Mind vids are cool, and you gotta love em for including a rollicking version of \"Wrathchild\", but why was a video shot for \"Women in Uniform\"? \"Running Free\" was the single from Iron Maiden, and it's a much better song. Although perhaps it\u2019s better that I don't have to watch it get massacred like WIU is. Both of the Powerslave videos work well, \"Aces High\" is one of their most famous vids, and \"2 Minutes\" is one of the rare instances where a full-out concept vid works for the band. Tons of Seventh Son stuff too, \"Can I Play With Madness?\" being particularly bad save for the fact that Graham Chapman of Monty Python fame is in it. I always hated that song too. But man, electric renditions of \"Infinite Dreams\" and \"The Evil That Men Do\". No excuse for three songs from No Prayer either, although \"Holy Smoke\" is absolutely hilarious. The live performance of \"Tailgunner\" feels weak, and the \"Bring Your Daughter\" vid concept (with old stock footage from a black and white horror flick) is running seriously thin after having it rammed down your throat about five times previous.\n\nOn to vid 2, lots of FOTD stuff, which is okay by me. \"Wasted Love\" is cheesy as hell, but still fairly powerful, and \"Be Quick or Be Dead\" is my hyperkinetic fav of the Maiden video catalogue. \"From Here to Eternity\" though...whew, this is like a terrible version of a terrible hair band video. Who comes up with this shit? Anyhoo, live versions of \"Hallowed\" and \"FOTD\", the former strong, the latter weak especially compared to FOTD from Rio included on the disk. The aforementioned Blaze videos are best forgotten, just like the albums, \"Virus\" being amateurish, \"Afraid to Shoot Strangers\" from FOTD making me long for Bruce, and the rest being awful in that Blaze-era way that requires no further words to describe. Finally, some Brave New World stuff, \"The Wicker Man\" awesome, \"Out of the Silent Planet\" weak, \"Brave New World\" energetic and inspired.\n\nSpecial features, a bit thin. The Camp Chaos vids are fun, but no featurettes? I'd loved to hear the band talking about all the vids...why no commentaries?\n\nStand-Outs: Flippin\u2019 awesome package, \u201cBe Quick or Be Dead\u201d, \u201cThe Wicker Man\u201d, \u201cHoly Smoke\u201d\n",
        "\nThis is one of the best compilations on dvd I have seen, if not the best. It offers everything Maiden has done from 1980-2001. It has a ton of great videos. It has alot of the videos for songs that they don't preform live on thier dvd Rock In Rio. So its nice to see a video to those forgotten songs. Like Wasting Love, Stranger in a Strange Land, and Out of a Silent Planet to name a few. It also includes some great classics two. \n\nA few things I had about it are a slow and cumbersome dvd menu screen, which plays part of a song when you move to different options, it gets kinda annoying. Also one thing that really bothered me is that they don't include two great classic live videos I have seen, that is Powerslave and Iron Maiden. It would be nice if they included as well Remember Tomorrow.\n\nMost of the videos on here are pretty good. Fear of the Dark, Stranger in a Strange Land, and Brave New World are the best ones. For a few of the vids the band has their live preformance, then the studio version of the song over it. It would have been nice if they used the live versions, it would have added intensity to it. \n\nOther than these things I can't complain about it. This dvd should be purchased because it has so many classic and great videos on them, some are just so great they give me goose bumps. If you like seeing Maiden preform songs, then get this album, because most of the vids on this dvd are of that. I am taking points off for the dvd menu screen and the few missing tracks I love. But what they did put on here is great.\n",
        "\nThis is regarded as trash by most people, but I can't find it in myself to agree. When I first heard the album, I was appalled, I really hated it. But as years went by, I started to like it, and dammit, it really isn't that bad. \n\nThe production is a bit thin and weak (Steve, you can't produce!), though better than on X-Factor, so it's tolerable. It opens up with 'Futureal', a great adrenaline-pumping song. Not, of course, in league with openers such as 'Aces High' and 'Moonchild', but still a very solid effort. Catchy and to the point, actually. Which is not the case with the next song, which I dub \"The Epitome of Repetitiveness\". Wow, even the word itself is repetitive! 'The Angel and the Gambler' (see, even the title reveals some of the repetitiveness, contaning two the's) isn't such a bad song, but when the same line is repeated 662 times (sorry guys, a few more would make the song outstanding, now it's just lame), it gets truly boring. It's a mid-paced 70's style hard rock song, and catchy too, but man do you fall asleep! Then we have 'Lighting Strikes Twice', which is in fact a great song. It begins calmly, like every bleedin' track on the X, but this one is very nice to listen to. It quickly pacens up (pacens up, is that English? I'm not sure. You get the idea anyway, ha!)The chorus is fun and repetitive and fun, and that's good enough for me. The masterpiece on this album is 'The Clansman'. Do you like Braveheart? Do you like freedom? Then you'll love this song. It's this album's epic (every Maiden album needs one, and BNW even had 7 of them!), and everything from vocal lines to riffs and leads and drums, makes it stand out. I love shouting \"FREEDOM!!!\" the hundred times it's repeated during the song, and at last year's Maiden concert, this song along with The Clairvoyant was the greatest moments! Yes, I love it. 'When Two Worlds Collide' reminds me of 'Lighting Strikes Twice', in that it starts out just as calmly, and....wait, doesn't half of Maiden's 90's output do that? Well, I connect the two all the time for some reason. Another great song (that's three in a row, you filthy unbelievers!). I really like the dreamy mood in this one. \n\nOf course, after a very nice hat-trick, things tend to calm down. And not only does it calm down, the quality drops down 200%. 'The Educated Fool' has a nice enough intro, but who in the midst of Lametown, UK came up with the chorus? Pure garbage that chorus is. And overall quite a boring song. And it's not as if 'Don't Look to the Eyes of a Stranger' remedies this in any way. Another calm intro, before there's actually a nice mid-paced part. 5 minutes into the song, however, Maiden decides to take influences from BLUEGRASS and make maybe the worst moment in all of Maiden history! Ok, so I'm not sure if bluegrass is the correct term, but when I hear that section I think of rednecks and town idiots dancing and prancing and spitting and drinking. Truly awful, then. The last song is 'Como Estais Amigos'. It's a ballad, and a great one too! I like playing this on my guitar (because I suck, and this one is easy enough for me to play, that's why!), and I love the chorus, not to mention the rest of the song. \n\nOverall, it is worth buying this album. 5 out if 8 great songs does not make an album suck, in my opinion. Of course, there are few Maiden albums worse than this, but if you have the other ones, don't exclude this one. If you live through the gruelling pain when you're listening to it the first five times, you'll learn to appreciate it, I'm sure of it. Tata.\n",
        "\nWow, this album disappointed the hell outta me. I was expecting sheer Maiden perfection with all the praise lofted on this one, but I guess I should've looked one album back. This isn't to say that Powerslave is a bad album, on the contrary, when it's good it's literally as good as metal gets period. But when it's off, it's just tepid.\n\nThe band was coming off the 'omigodbestalbumevar'-type performance on Piece of Mind, and hopes were high for a follow-up to be just as good. Alas, just as Motorhead's Iron Fist paled against Ace of Spades (which in turn was considerably weaker than Overkill), and Sabbath's Technical Ecstasy was hardly a shadow of Sabotage, so it was again here. But man, give the boys credit for starting out the gates strong.\n\n\"Aces High\", the most giddyingly Maiden track in the Maiden catalogue just hammers out of the gates, digits flying, vocals soaring, guitars harmonizing like nobodies business...if you wanted to explain Iron Maiden to someone, file this alongside \"The Trooper\", \"Fear of the Dark\", and perhaps \"Wrathchild\" as your instant declaration of metal supremacy personified. I love love love this song.\n\nNext up, \"2 Minutes to Midnight\", the most rock 'n' rollsy swaggering track on the album, a two-fisted pummelling in which horror of horrors, Steve Harris pretends to be a normal bass player. And wow, try to follow that narrative if you can (made even more confused by the nonsensical video), or just revel in Bruce's most deliciously vile performance 'til \"Be Quick or Be Dead\" five years hence. It's a truly godly tune.\n\nNow, perhaps you're wondering why I sorta slammed this album earlier, so here it is. This album has got filler, and extremely dreary filler at that. \"Flash of the Blade\" is a waste of vinyl, the band half-heartedly trying to repeat what worked so gloriously on PoM to no avail. \"Losfer Words\" is unremarkable in the extreme, a solid little Maiden gallop they should've just used in a real song. This is, and feels like, filler. And then, \"The Duellists\" another sagging gut of a track that despite Bruce's epic approach to the lame narrative, succeeds in merely passing the time, no pulse evident. This stuff is just so horribly \u2018blah\u2019 that I barely had the heart to listen to it.\n\nBut lo and behold!, the boys come to with \"Back in the Village\" leading the way into a eventful ending suite, the song being a personal favourite of mine. Fun speedy little riff, Bruce going mad over a sing-songy and insanely catchy melody. Seriously, I sung the chorus to this over and over for nearly a week and a half without tiring of it. People around me though...\n\nAh, \"Powerslave\" how I love thee, a title-track worthy of carrying that banner. Intriguing lyric, nice moody atmosphere and then boom! that chorus hits you, a sort of song within a song, and it's even better than the rest of the brilliant track and then that godly solo break...almost an \"Aces High\" killer is \"Powerslave\". This track's that good.\n\nNow, \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\" is the start of the well that Maiden would perhaps draw from too often over the years, but damn if it isn't a good template. You can almost sense the band wondering how they can do more epic songs than \"Hallowed be thy Name\". Apparently the answer that occurred to them is 'make it long...REALLY long', and boy did they ever. Still, the track does trundle along solidly, Bruce at his most thespian telling the tale of a man wearing an Albatross (cue Monty Python) around his neck, something that you'd think would be rather uncomfortable considering his size. Gotta love those riffs though, even if not that much really happens, and that up-tempo section is so worthy I can almost forget the silly spoken sections and drawn out \"ambient\" bits.\n\nSo, we have an awesome opening, and a fine close with a truly leaden middle. I would have ranked it higher, but coming off of PoM this is a disappointment. A really big disappointment.\n\nStand-Outs: \u201cBack in the Village\u201d, \u201cAces High\u201d, \u201c2 Minutes to Midnight\u201d\n",
        "\nOk, I think I should start this review by putting up some defense for Blaze. First of all, he isn't Bruce. Get over it. With that in mind, his vocal work on this album is 100% better than it was on the previous album. I'll admit, I didn't like his vocals on X-Factor as much because he tended to sound like he was mumbling at times. Also, Blaze's vocals fit many of the songs very well on this album. Now, also keep in mind that Iron Maiden isn't Blaze's band. The comment I hear most of is \"Blaze sucks because he repeats the choruses too much.\" I will explain (at least my interpretation) this when I get to Angel and the Gambler. However, even still, I'm wondering how this is Blaze's fault? If the other members of the band really didn't like the way the songs were coming out because of the choruses, they probably would have done it over. In fact, the only songs that Blaze contributed to writing were Futureal, When Two Worlds Collide, and Como Estais Amigos. None of these sound overly repetetive to me. \n\nNow with that in mind, I like this album, with a few exceptions. Futureal is an excellent opening track. I've heard people complain that its too short, but hey, that works for me. The problem begins with Angel and the Gambler, which is first of all misunderstood. One time, just for trivial purposes, I decided to count the number of times Blaze says \"Don't you think I'm a savior...\" This line is repeated 21 times, which I think was done intentionally as part of the \"gambler\" theme (21 Blackjack for the morons who don't see where I'm going with this). However, this cleverness is not nearly enough to save this song. This is by far one of the most boring Maiden songs I've ever heard. \n\nAfter \"Angel and the Gambler\" which for many is the downfall of this album, the remaining tracks aren't too bad. Lightning Strikes Twice is one of my favorite songs from the Blaze era. The Clansman is a very good epic track which never really fails to impress me. When Two Worlds collide has a very impressive melody. For some reason, this song is constantly overlooked, but I think it is one of the better songs on this album. The Educated Fool isn't a bad song, but it is less memorable than the others. I like the lyrics to this song, but the melody just isn't as memorable. Don't Look To the Eyes of a Stranger is a good song, but it definitely could have been shortened. There is a repetetive chorus near the middle/end of this song, but it only began to bother me after constant listens. The album closes with Como Estais Amigos, which is a very solid and memorable ballad. \n\nIf you can't get over the fact that Bruce was gone for this album and The X Factor, I don't know what to tell you. It seems like Blaze is constantly being looked at as the downfall of these two albums. However, in the end, this album holds together pretty well.\n",
        "\nThe 1980 self-titled debut of the great Iron Maiden was the start of a very long and successful career and it\u2019s one of their stronger releases in my opinion. Sure, this release doesn\u2019t have Bruce Dickinson but that\u2019s ok! We all know Paul Di\u2019anno isn\u2019t as skilled or as gifted as Dickinson but his voice is still strong and a lot rawer. It fitted with the bands sound at the time, too, because, in fact, the bands sound was not as polished or as clean and definitely had some raw qualities to it in both the song writing and production style. In this sense it makes for an interesting listen to hear how Iron Maiden started out having known what they\u2019ve become.\n\nThere are some definite classic tracks on here, my favorite being Phantom Of The Opera, which is Iron Maiden\u2019s first stab at their commonplace epic track. It\u2019s very multi-faceted with excellent guitar melodies interwoven with Steven Harris\u2019s trademark bass style. Phantom Of The Opera also demonstrates something that shows up throughout the CD and that\u2019s interesting drum rhythms. Only the title track features standard snare/bass runs, as every other song has some kind of unique rhythm which works very well with the guitars and bass, and that\u2019s a large part of the appeal on this release because it makes every song sound different. Some other key points of this release include \"Remember Tomorrow\", mostly because the first riff played after the quiet verse sounds very Sabbath and \"Strange World\", which sounds like something Rainbow would have done in the 70\u2019s. So in a sense this release features some styles of Iron Maiden that wouldn\u2019t appear again.\n\nAll Iron Maiden fans should own this release because some of Maiden\u2019s best early work is found on here and even though the guitar playing and bass work, and even the vocals aren\u2019t as refined as they would be later on, flashes of brilliance show up often. It also has a classic early NWOBHM sound that was somewhat lost with most releases in the style during the mid-80\u2019s and thus has a strong historical importance as well and deserves a place in all Heavy Metal fan collections.\n\nSong Highlights: Prowler, Remember Tomorrow, Phantom Of The Opera, Transylvania, Charlot The Harlot, Iron Maiden\n",
        "\nDisappointment - this is what I felt when I listened to this single.\nI already knew what wildest dreams is but I expected much more from the b-side and the blood brothers mix.\n\n01. Wildest Dreams - easily to weakest track on iron maiden's newest album, dance of death.\nIn this track Iron Maiden tried to repeat to success of the wicker man single but although I never considered the wicker man a classic and original maiden song, wildest dreams is in no way as good as the wicker man is.\nthe rhythm is good but the chorus is simply ridiculous.\n\n02. Pass The Jam - not a usual iron maiden song. sounds more like a jam (duh). The true is that this is a very avarage song which holds nothing exciting musically.\nThere are only a few iron maiden b-sides that are really as good as the album tracks are (That Girl, Doctor Doctor, All In Your Mind) but this one is not among them.\n\n03. Blood Brothers (Orchestral Mix) - Eh? wtf?! At first I wasn't sure if someone took the brave new world version of blood brothers and put it here.\nBut after I read the other reviews here I understand that this is exactly what they did.\nI couldn't find anything different at any position of the song.\nIf you found something I'd be happy if you let me know where in the song exactly it is.\n\n\nI give it 60 because this is still Iron Maiden but the way it stands as a single it doesn't even worth 40.\nI can only hope that their newly announced EP, No More Lies, will contain more attractive contents. (at least it seems so by the track listing)\nIf you're ought this cd for the blood brothers don't buy it.\nIf you're ought this cd for the b-side don't buy it.\nand if you're ought this cd for wildest dreams, then you better go and buy the dance of death album.\n",
        "\nSomehow I've gotten hold of this, sometime back in 1999. I haven't heard it since then (as I don't have a vinyl-player), but I do remember the songs. The EP opens up with two covers, Women in Uniform and Invasion. Women in Uniform is an ok song, but it's nothing compared to the Maiden material found here. When I first saw the title Invasion, I got quite confused, since Maiden have a song called Invaders. I thought maybe it was a spelling error before I heard it. When I heard it, though, I realized this was not the same song. It's a nice little rocker, but as with many of the songs Maiden cover, it can't hold a candle to their original songs. Phantom of the Opera a godly masterpiece, originally found on their debut. It's also Maiden's first epic, and that's cool. The main riff is fast and wicked, and the song goes through various rhythms and stages before it ends. A real epic in every sense of the word. \n\nTwilight Zone is one of Maiden's very few filler songs from the 80's. It's ok, but it never sticks in your brain, making it hopelessly anonymous. The last song is Wratchild, originally found on Killers, and it's killer material. A real punkish streetwise and attitude-filled midpaced song. I'm not quite sure what it is about, it's something about someone who's trying to find his father and get revenge or something. I've never read the lyrics thoroughly enough to understand it. But I DO know it's a fantastic song. The last track on the EP is called Listen With Nicko! Part II. That's right; 8 minutes of drummer Nicko McBrain's non-sensical babble. In fact I don't remember what he spoke about, but knowing him, I'm sure it wasn't anything serious, hehe. \n\nOverall, this is a very interesting EP, with songs from very early Maiden, when noone even knew who Bruce Dickinson was, and Paul Di'Anno was the frontman.\n",
        "\nYa know, the first time I heard it, I didn't like it at all. So I didn't listen to it for another two weeks. But then I went back to it, gave it another chance, and now I'm a better person for it. Let this be a lesson for you all, everyone. Give things another chance. That includes Drano. If you can survive drinking Drano once, I don't see why you can't survive it twice.\n\nBack to the review... it's not the greatest thing Maiden has ever released, and it's not quite even as good as the album that came before this one, but it's still pretty decent and has some really fucking spectacular moments that scream \"tell me why I have to be a powerslave!\" The choruses aren't nearly as repetitive as on Virtual XI, though they still grate a bit. But still, we've got good songwriting and memorable melodies - oh and the three guitar factory is going strong, and bands like Beyond the Monkey Suck just wish they could sound like this.\n\nHighlights... intro riff of Rainmaker, is just fucking brilliant. Wildest Dreams is a great opener and is gonna be a well-deserved live staple. No More Lies is the first epic number, and it builds up well, and the only fault I can find with it is the goofy chorus. But you've got Bruce dead on ... \"time is up, it couldn't last\"... and the soloing is completely fucking excellent - more in the style of Fear of the Dark than Killers, but still quite excellent. \n\nOh and the absolute fucking highlight of the album... New Frontier. Why didn't they bring in Nicko the Songwriter before this? Oh those duelling guitars. Oh that excellent sing-along chorus. They haven't written a number quite like this since Twilight Zone, really. Magnificent. If they don't play this one live, I'm personally standing in front of Nicko's Jaguar and demanding justice!!\n\nThe rest... Montsegur and Paschendale will always be completely twisted together in my mind because they're both big words that mean nothing to me. Both songs are about average quality, except Paschendale sounds like something completely out of the X Factor sessions, except for that crazy beginning part, which sounds like something out of a Commodore 64. \n\nFace in the Sand has a nice orchestral buildup but is fairly pedestrian when all is said and done. Decent chorus, when all is said and done. Gates of Tomorrow is another decently cool upbeat number, while Age of Innocence another darker one that sounds very X. \n\nOh yeah, the closing track. Sorry, but Bruce has been involved in far better ballads recently (Tears of the Dragon, Man of Sorrows) - this one is a disappointment. And the title track is long but fails to be epic.\n\nBut great fuck almighty, New Frontier is basically this album's Ghost of the Navigator - one mind-blowingly amazing, amazingly mind-blowing number that brings to mind glorious days of caught somewhere in time and friends. So when all is said and done, this is worth getting. Though I would suggest accidentally spilling some white-out on that horrible, horrible album cover.\n",
        "\nHonestly, I wasn't expecting much from this album. Wildest Dreams didn't impress me when I first heard it a while back and I heard rumors of a more progressive, 70's rock sound. WHAT THE HELL WAS I THINKING! Even though they have put out some less than stellar albums, this is fucking Maiden we're talking about. This is the perfect follow up to Brave New World, not changing the sound too drastically, but progressing enough to make it fresh and interesting.\n\nThe songs retain the epic and slightly progressive feel found in Brave New World, but the guitars are slightly less in the foreground and instead add to the overall sound instead of being the sound, which includes some nicely placed keyboards and orchestration. Some of the riffs aren't quite as strong as they could be, as the band go for a more progressive touch, but these are minor complaints, because the weaker riffs are usually accompained by some nice keyboards or a great vocal melody. Many people have complained about Bruces vocals not sounding right. It's inescapable the fact that Bruce is getting older and he can't belt it out like he could twenty years ago, but the man can still sing. His performance takes absolutely nothing away from the overall enjoyment of the album, and in fact is quite impressive. Another thing I want to touch on is the shit Maiden has received the past couple of years about their repetative choruses. Songs such as No More Lies and Age of Innocence do have repetative choruses, but the thing that's being repeated is quite catchy and enjoyable, so I don't see a problem unless they butcher that idea to death (which they haven't IMO). Shit, even such Maiden classics as Deja Vu, Caught Somewhere in Time, and The Evil that Men Do have slightly repetative choruses, so this isn't something new for them.\n\nOne problem this album has, and it's not a huge problem, is that none of the songs really stand out as classics or as obviously better than the rest. That's not to say that the songs are weak, because I don't think there's a weak song on the album. Wildest Dreams, Rainmaker, Montsegur, New Frontier, and Age of Innocence are all midpaced, kick-ass songs. Wildest Dreams and New Frontier have excellent choruses and the beginning to Montsegur reminds me a lot of Losfer Words (Big 'Orra) from Powerslave with the bass very loud in the mix and the galloping riff. The epics on the album, No More Lies, Dance of Death, and Paschendale are all very strong and enjoyable. They aren't as strong as Hallowed Be Thy Name, or even Ghost of the Navigator and Dream of Mirrors from BNW, but still great. The orchestration in the song DOD is at it's best and the song reaches it's high point at 7:11 when the guitars, orchestration, and vocals come together to create something truly epic and memorable. This one's definitly a winner. So is Paschendale. I'm not ejaculating all over this one like most people, but it's a great song with the best lyrics on the album. \n\nOverall, this album is extremely consistent, not a bad song to be found. All the performances are top-notch and the lead guitars, of course, are absolutely spectacular. It just goes to show how great Maiden is when you consider that in my opinion, this is their NINTH best album. How many band's NINTH best album is this good? That's what I thought. \n\nHighlights(if I had to choose 'em): Wildest Dreams, Rainmaker, Dance of Death, New Frontier, Paschendale, Age of Innocence\n",
        "\nSaying goodbye may be hard to do, but sooner rather than later, it just may be time for metal legends Iron Maiden of London England. However, before we all start whimpering, I'd like to state that the end doesn't come with this album- the band's 23rd- but the warning lights come on all over the place here nonetheless.\n\nFirst of all, through all the album's greatness, the songs do feel way too similar to each other. Doesn't mean that they're not good at all- \"Paschendale\", for example, details an interesting battle (supposedly about the World War I battle), while \"Face Down\" has a rather pessimistic Bruce Dickinson lamenting that \"everyone's (in the world) nightmares will come true\". War On Terrorism reference? Maybe. Yet, as strong as the songs may be, they don't do enough to really differentiate themselves from each other and stand out on their own, either as a concept album or as a regular one, except for the final track, \"Journeyman\". In that one, you get a sharp turn from the band- the previous eleven songs were all about pain and suffering in some form and how Dickinson just can't handle it, but here, Dickinson stammers confidently that he's not going to let any of that get to him. \"I know what I want/And say what I want/And no one can take it away\" he stammers with confidence, being the album's only real eye-opener.\n\nSecond of all, this album feels too tame compared to other metal releases. Sure, it's not produced to the same extent as say, KoRn, but compare it to the likes of Cynic or Danzig and the music just doesn't feel raw or loud enough. However, my biggest complaint is their sound is- ulp- starting to get a little dated. \"Dance Of Death\", oftentimes, sounds almost like a Led Zeppelin tribute album than an Iron Maiden album- not that there's anything wrong with Zeppelin, mind you, it's just a little unsettling, that's all.\n\nAgain, it's not like Maiden don't have anything left- their musicianship is, once again, top notch and very anthemic, producing some grand guitarwork and nearly as encompassing drumming complimenting Dickinson's Roger Plant-like powerful delivery. Songs like \"Gates Of Tommorow\" and \"New Frontier\" show just how far behind imitators like HammerFall are from matching the greatness that is Maiden, as they're filled with considerably more profound material and grander musicianship than any of them could ever pull off. It's just that \"Dance Of Death\" feels like a band that's just getting too old- maybe not at the irrelevant stage like, say, The Rolling Stones, but dangerously close. That said, \"Dance Of Death\" shows that the band just may pull off another classic down the road, but as much as I'd like to say otherwise, after hearing this album, the band just seems closer and closer to retirement- after twenty plus years, mind you. It's a sad development, yes, but that's just where they seem to be headed right now, and who knows if they'll ever come back.\n",
        "\nI've been on a diet of Dance of Death only since I got it, I've played it over and over again, and god knows I've tried so hard to like it. The long awaited follow-up to the reunion album Brave New World (which was quite a lame album, but that's beside the point) is released, and I've never experienced such a bad case of Maiden-hysteria.\nBut, to be frank with you, Dance of Death sucks, even more so than Brave New World. Iron Maiden are going downhill.\n\nFirst of all, we have the production. The sound is pretty sharp, especially on the lead guitar, but the rhythm section sounds somehow watered out and shallow- and that is not only a production problem but also a lack of quality in the songwriting. We still have the obligatory killer leadwork and soloing of any Iron Maiden album, but the rhythm section is extremely weak and uninteresting. The riffs are boring and forgettable, and rarely add much to the song.\nThis is most notable in the huge amount of mindless filler found on the album. This category of songs consist of the tunes Rainmaker, Monts\u00e9gur, Gates of Tomorrow, New Frontier, Face in the Sand and Age of Innocence. Which is more than half of the entire album.\nAll these songs are boring, uninteresting and built open very weak rhythm foundations.\n\nThere is yet another huge disappointment with the album that is most notable on these songs- the vocals. Bruce Dickinson hasn't been near his top shape in more than ten years, but his performance on BNW still did the trick.\nHis performance on Dance of Death, though, does not. Most of the time he sounds like he's singing out of nose, or maybe like he's got a severe cold.\nAlso, the vocal melodies are extremely poorly written on the above mentioned songs. There are no memorable vocal lines whatsoever, no incredibly memorable parts that stand out, and there is barely any variation at all.\nMonts\u00e9gur is the very weakest part of the entire album and one of the worst Maiden songs ever. This because of a weak vocal performance and poorly written vocal lines that don't work with the music at all, and also the horrible sound on the guitars under the vocal lines. Age of Innocence also has the dumbest and most annoying chorus the band has ever written, and is overall incredibly pathetic.\n\nSo these are the album's weaker points, my friend. But there is still some good shit to be found on here. The single, Wildest Dreams, has some pretty solid although slightly forgettable underlying riffwork, catchy vocal melodies and an extremely fun singalong chorus.\nThe first of three epics on here, No More Lies, is tied with Wildest Dreams for best song on the album. The intro is pretty much a straight ripoff from their own song The Clansman, but it's still very nice, and the song has some awesome melodies throughout of total Fear of the Dark (the song) quality, and a very big, dumb and powerful yet simplistic chorus.\nDance of Death is also pretty damn solid. It gradually builds up with some nice guitar melodies until it gets into this mesmerizing acoustic section at about 1:45. The song moves on, and goes into some killer keyboard part that sounds like a bloody orchestra; a truly overwhelming moment. It then goes on at about the same pace, reaching over 8 minutes without getting boring. They've still got it in them, even though it doesn't show very often.\nPaschendale is the third and final epic on the album, and also by far the weakest. It still has some pretty cool and dark keyboard melodies in total X Factor style, and a truly powerful chorus.\nThe closing track Journeyman is also very nice, and (as you've probably figured by now) it's an entirely acoustic track. It's very well done, even though at 7 minutes it gets a bit overlong. It has a nice atmosphere overall though, and is definitely a highlight.\n\n\nI tried, I really tried to like this. But it seems as though the band has completely forgotten how to write an entire good album, even though their fans continue to hail them endlessly. The album seems to please the majority, but I'm not one of them. I shouldn't really be too disappointed, as they haven't written anything really good since '88, but I still got my hopes up.\nThere is some great stuff on here, but not enough for you to waste your money on. Download Wildest Dreams, No More Lies and Dance of Death, and you'll be fine.\nOh yeah, and the cover art sucks ass.\n",
        "\nIron Maiden reunites with Adrian Smith and Bruce Dickinson, and release an album with the coolest artwork in years- it has to be a masterpiece.\nUnfortunately, it isn't. Brave New World is the biggest disappointment in quite a few years, and definitely one of my least favourite Maiden albums.\nThe sound and production is very solid- the guitar tone is killer and the bass is just loud enough. The snare drum sounds a bit flat, but otherwise it's all great.\nThe band members are also pretty good. Bruce's voice works well, even though his performance is not close to the classic stuff, the triple guitars are excellently played, although I'm quite sure they could do alot more with three guitars than what they have. Nicko's performance on the drums is one of his best ever, in fact, delivering catchy and memorable beats as a solid base, his right foot working the pedal frenetically and for once doesn't overuse neither the hi hat nor the ride. \n\nSo why the low rating, you ask? Well, it's as simple as this: The songwriting is, for the most part, horrible.\nBrave New World was supposed to show a more \"mature\" Maiden. But what we really have here, is an album with a few supposedly classic Maiden-styled fast paced numbers that feel uninspired and watered out, and then a bunch of overlong, overemotional, failed attempts of epic masterpieces.\nOne of the most annoying factors with the album is the unbelievable amount of repetition. To mention just a few examples... The chorus of opening track The Wicker Man is simply \"Your time will come\" repeated a bunch of times. The title track's chorus is \"A brave new world in a brave new world\", also repeated a couple of times. Blood Brothers: \"We're blood brothers\" x4. But the worst case of repetition is found in The Mercenary, I believe. The pre-chorus is \"Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, you've got to kill to stay alive\" repeated twice. And the chorus is \"Show them no fear, show them no pain\" repeated four times. All this repetition gets thoroughly annoying, and it makes you wonder what the hell they were thinking.\n\nThere are, though, a few high points of the album. The Wicker Man isn't really a bad tune, the chorus is quite powerful despite the repetition, and features some really cool singalong moments. The riffage is pretty solid as well, even though the main riff is stolen from the Priest track Running Wild.\nGhost of the Navigator is also alright, actually, with some very powerful guitar and vocal melodies.\nDream of Mirrors is a very nice epic. The melodies and time changes actually work without sounding overly emotional, overly epic, or overly anything. It also has several killer singalong moments, most notably the (repetitive but still good) \"the dream is true\" part. The song, (heck, the entire album) works much better live, as it gains a whole lot from the crowd participation. But the studio version is very good too.\nWe also have Out Of The Silent Planet. It's just a solid, straightforward and catchy number with a very memorable chorus and excellent soloing (Maiden's soloing never disappoints, ever! That much you can rely on). And it was also, believe it or not, the first Iron Maiden song I heard.\nFinally, The Nomad is a very solid epic, and the only one that really manages to capture some sort of epic atmosphere. The heavy beginning, the powerful chorus and the mesmerizing instrumental section help to make this my favourite song off the album.\n\nSo really, the album consists of five songs ranging from decent to great, and five pretty much worthless songs. Blood Brothers, The Thin Line Between Love And Hate and especially the title track are all incredibly boring. The Fallen Angel goes on at an efficient pace, and despite some nice, dark riffage and a solid (and in fact not repetitive) chorus, it just falls short, and The Mercenary is just plain boring.\n\n\nIron Maiden will never return to their glorious form of the 80's, but there is some nice stuff found in here. Half of the songs are pretty damn solid, but the rest is incredibly weak. It could've been better, but unfortunately, it isn't. The fast rockers are not as catchy and in-your-face as they used to be, and the epics fails to capture any actual epic atmosphere. A crushing disappointment, indeed.\n",
        "\nWith \"The Number of the Beast\", Maiden created a classic to be known and loved by metalheads through all ages, and while it's not the BSET ABLUMN EVEEEEERRR!!1!!1 as people claim it to be, it's definitely awesome. \"Piece of Mind\" is another classic, but I myself found it slightly disappointing, and not at all as good as it could've been.\nBut Maiden kicked right back to the top with 1984's \"Powerslave\", probably their best album ever. It's their most intense and powerful album, and it constantly keeping up a very high pace in all of the songs. Musically, most of the tunes are extremely catchy and quite upbeat despite rather dark lyrical subjects (\"2 Minutes To Midnight\" especially comes to mind here), as a great part of the songs write about war. And it is done incredibly well, since this is in the time when Maiden had not completely watered out all of their lyrical subjects, not even that of war.\n\nThis is closer to \"Number of the Beast\" and \"Piece of Mind\" than to \"Somewhere in Time\" and \"Seventh Son\" (the albums that followed it) soundwise, in that the rhythm guitars have a very rough and sharp edge, yet when played together they give a strange, harmonizing effect which works extremely well.\nAnd of course, the melodic leads that we all know and love are all over this album, and they are better than ever before! They are blasted out in just the right moments, used just enough times in each song, and constantly add an amazing amount of power and atmosphere to the songs. The leadwork shines especially much in \"Losfer Words (Big 'Orra)\", which is probably their best instrumental to this point.\nThe entire band is really in top shape, with Steve's bass being slightly lower in the mix for the most part, which is in fact a good thing. It's still very 'there' and adds alot, yet never tries to steal attention from guitars, something that at times was obvious on previous Maiden records.\nNicko's drumming is as usual catchy, memorable and instantly recognizable, even though he at times overuses the ride and/or hi hat during rhythm sections.\nAnd Bruce's vocals, like on any early Maiden record, are very solid, but I still don't think he's anywhere near the best Metal singers ever.\n\nThese factors all help in making \"Powerslave\" into one of my favourite Maiden album, challenged only by \"The Number of the Beast\" and \"Killers\" - but the biggest part is of course the songwriting, as it is the only Iron Maiden album without a single weak track to be found. It's all here, and it's all great.\n\nThe energetic \"Aces High\" opens the album and is one of Maiden's greatest tracks ever. The rough yet harmonizing riffs blast out in full power all over the song, to explode in one of their most powerful choruses yet, and then continues to further kick your ass with a mindblowing solo.\n\"2 Minutes To Midnight\" is catchy as all fucking hell, with that instantly recognizable opening riff, and the awesomely memorable and dark pre-chorus and chorus lines, combined with a truly sinister vocal performance.\n\"The Duellists\" has some fun fast sung vocal lines, a very solid chorus and also that completely mindblowing middle section, showing off some of the greatest leadwork in the history of Maiden.\nAnd of course the epic closing tracks; there are two of them! We first have the title track, \"Powerslave\", which is the best song on the album and one of my top 5 maiden tracks ever. The out of this world instrumental section is just huge, with that beautiful slowed down piece in the middle and all- but what really makes the song is the absolutely fucking insanely heavy riffwork, together with the wicked vocal performance and overall atmosphere, with Steve's basslines providing a very strong, Egyptian feeling.\nAnd then we get right on to \"Rime Of The Ancient Mariner\", which is another classic Maiden epic with loads and loads of time changes and is also their longest song to date. The atmosphere it manages to build up has to be heard to believe it. To spell it out for ya; you've got to own this album.\n\nSome people say that Powerslave has four mediocre tracks sandwiched between four classics. I say that they can go fuck themselves.\n\"Losfer Words\", \"Flash of the Blade\", \"The Duellists\" and \"Back In The Village\", all of them show Maiden at their best, and I pity the fool who doesn't recognize this obvious fact.\n\nTo close this review with one sentence: If you were to own only one Iron Maiden album, this is the one.\n",
        "\nSeventh Son of a Seventh Son seems to be the most popular of the Maiden albums. But while it certainly is a great album, I don't really feel it deserves the endless praise it gets. There are several lower points obvious on the album, although as a whole it's another Maiden classic.\n\n\nThe sound and songwriting continues where Somewhere in Time left off, using lots of keyboards and synthesizers, but now pretty much only for atmospheric background effects and they don't use synthesizer guitars, like they did on Somewhere in Time.\nThis, along with the general tone on the guitars and also Bruce's vocal performance, gives the album a somewhat sharper and heavier edge, which still blends in perfectly with the mesmerizing melodies and memorable leads that are Maiden's trademark.\nThe overall atmosphere is in the classic vein, mixing together epic feelings with the intensity of classic, straightforward heavy metal in a flawless combination, only this puts even more focus on the epic side on most songs, another quality comparable to Somewhere in Time.\n\nAnd the songwriting is, for the most part, top-notch. We begin with one hell of a ride, as the classic acoustic intro to Moonchild starts playing. \"Seven deadly sins, seven ways to win, seven holy paths to hell and your trip begins...\"\nThen we are led into an atmospheric, almost spacey keyboard melody before kicking into the tumbling main riff, and from there it just rocks. Catchy and memorable vocals, classic melodies, very solid bass and guitarwork, and a crazy solo.\n\nInfinite Dreams is the first weaker point of the album in my opinion, even though most people love it. It starts as a pretty soft ballad, and then speeds up into the solo section- and the speeded up part is really good, featuring some killer soloing and leadwork. But the balladic part is just really boring. Bruce's vocals manage to suck quite badly; he just doesn't fit for that softer material. His voice has got loads of power, and here it just seems like he's trying really hard to hold back all that power, and it just doesn't work.\n\nCan I Play With Madness is a fun, catchy and straightforward rocker which is just solid all through- except for that godawful chorus. It's just so incredibly cheesy that it makes me sick. Nonetheless, it's a pretty decent song, though nothing spectacular.\n\nThe album's real masterpiece is The Evil That Men Do. We begin with that immortal melodic intro-lead, before the intensity and power is cranked up to a 110%. Bruce's vocals shine especially much on this track, where he sounds really sinister during the verses and then he just explodes with all of his power into one of Maiden's best choruses ever.\nAnd musically, as well, this just screams heavy fucking metal. The riffwork is awesome, blending Maiden's heavy and melodic qualities perfectly, and the lead and solo section is absolutely divine. This is by far the best song on the album...\n\n...although the title track is no slouch either. It kicks off with a huge keyboard intro before going into the midpaced verses, which is some of the most powerful stuff the band has ever written. The chorus is somewhat repetitive, but hey, when it's this great then who's complaining?\nThe second half of the song is an instrumental part with the exception for a very cool spoken part. And like pretty much any instrumental section written by Iron Maiden themselves, this is some good stuff. But the fact remains that it really doesn't get anywhere for about 7 minutes into the song, which is a slight problem. But when it does get going, it's completely awesome.\n\nThe Prophecy follows it up, and it is the weakest song on the album. The opening guitar melodies try to be emotional, but fails to capture any actual emotion. \nThe riffwork of the song feels really watered out, and it just leaves you very unimpressed. The vocal lines as well don't do much at all for me. Overall, despite a very cool solo it stands out as one of the weakest tracks of the classic Maiden era.\n\nBut we get right back on track with The Clairvoyant. We start with a subtle yet solid bass intro, the simple but effective riff kick in, a nice melody comes, and then Nicko McBrain gets things going.\nThe song is very nicely constructed, with the bass, one guitar and Nicko's drumming building a solid base, and Bruce's vocals remain on top together with the second guitar throwing out a couple of cool melodic licks here and there. It's overall less straightforward and more atmospheric, yet still goes on at a quite efficient pace, and also manages to be another of my personal favourite tracks on the album.\n\nThe closing track is another fast and catchy, melodic asskicker in the vein of Moonchild or The Evil That Men Do. With galloping riffs, infectious melodies and dark, powerful and atmospheric vocal lines, Only The Good Die Young rages on, closing the album in a majestic manner with the same acoustic lines that opened it.\n\n\nSeventh Son of a Seventh Son is no doubt another essential record, but as several quite major flaws are evident throughout the album, it feels like it's not quite as good as it could be. Infinite Dreams, Can I Play With Madness and especially The Prophecy stand out as average or below average, and the weak spots on the album.\nBut otherwise, there's nothing but asskickers to be found here, with The Evil That Men Do and Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son standing out as the very best ones.\n",
        "\nI don't know what these guys had in their mind, releasing this single. \"Wildest dreams\" is a nice song. A classic maiden song, without any special meaning though, that could pass on the new album simply as a good song. Maiden seem not to care about their whole image and release this track with \"Pass the Jam\", a track that I don't want to comment. Ok, I know that Maiden on their best years had many b-side tracks that were bad, but they also had some killers and some great covers. Let's return to \"wildest dreams\". It has a nice melodic part and the whole song is built around the chorus. I wouldn't give any money for this one, \"Wickerman\" was by faaaaaaaar a better single, with catchy riffs and power inside. The single is dissapointing overall but the album has great songs inside. 80 for wildest dreams and 50 for the jam thing. True...\n",
        "\nIron Maiden - the greatest heavy metal band of all time. You can't really argue with that fact. Still sold out arenas around the world, 23 years after their first album. Now it's 2003 and the Dance of Death album is soon being released, but of course there are singles being released. This single I'm going to review is the single that only contains two tracks, \"Wildest Dreams\" and \"Pass the Jam\".\n\nWildest Dreams is the song they played on their 2003 tour. It is in pure Maiden style: Fast and rocky. Wildest Dreams fails though, being too simple. There are no exceptional instrumental efforts or marvelous song writing. The song \"lives\" on its catchy chorus, which it wont come far with. Maybe you can fool some people with a fine chorus like that, but I think that the rest of the song would have needed something more. This feels more like a simple party rocker, than a memorable Maiden song.\n\nThe second track is \"Pass the Jam\". This song will not be on the full-length album. The only way to get your hands on this \"rare\" song is to buy a single. On second thoughts, maybe you shouldn't. The song is nothing special at all. It is even worse than WIildest Dreams! Iron Maiden is known (at least by me) to make long epic songs and all of them are very good. Usually they have some kind of depth and really nice song-writing. It feels like they're done with much care. Pass the Jam is 8 minutes long but can't be called an epic song. Not at all. This is just too simple to be this long. It's silly that a song like this should be 8 minutes. What's the deal with that? A simple, poorly written song! The Angel and the Gambler was long (9 minutes) but can't be called an epic song either - but it was pretty cathcy and had a good chorus. \"Pass the Jam\" hasn't got anything. I hope that they never even thought of placeing this on the real album!\n\n\nThis wasn't at all what I wanted. Two mediocre songs on their single. I certainly hope that \"Dance of Death\" will be a lot better than this. Otherwise Iron Maiden won't be here for long...\n",
        "\nThis is the new Iron Maiden single, officially released 1.9 and was available in stores 29.8. It contains one track, Wildest Dreams, from the forthcoming album Dance of Death, and two other tracks, Pass The Jam and Blood Brothers (Orchestral Mix).\n\nWhile Wildest Dreams, the main track of the single, is a basic Maiden-rocker which means that it is all about speed. Pass the Jam is something which reminds me of Liquid Tension Experiment and its annoying, never-ending improvised songs... and Blood Brothers is boring. Who cares about an orchestral mix from a crappy song anyway?\n\nI would recommend this single only to teh trve fans. There's nothing worth seeing here, really. Wildest Dreams is a decent track, hence the 60% rating, so it is not all that bad... but could have been better.\n",
        "\nWow, does this suck or what? After the awesome Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, you'd think that they'd put out something good. Instead, they put out the worst piece of shit in their entire career. On this album, the songwriting just went to hell. The songs come off as really forced and generic, and nothing really works. This is evident right from the opening song Tail Gunner- a balls-out rocker that has no balls. The opening riff is too simplistic, and the production makes it way too clean and harmless for it's own good. The verses are too happy, and the chorus is dead cool but really fucking repetitive- \"Climb into the sky, never wonder why\" x 4. It really gets old.\nMany of the songs give a vibe of lack of inspiration, in that they all seem to be trying to recreate old classics instead of creating new and fresh heavy metal. The previously mentioned Tail Gunner sounds like a really weak Aces High clone, the lead-based title track which speeds up later on is what Infinite Dreams would be if it sucked goat balls. The so-called 'epic' Mother Russia is weak as all fucking hell, and one of the worst Maiden songs ever. The keyboards that give the impression of some huge melodic backing choir were already used in a much better way on the Seventh Son title track, and the whole song seems really watered out. They just suddenly forgot how to write really good songs.\n\nMusically, the album is more riff-based than the previous two- construction-wise pretty similar to The Number of the Beast, only much simpler, and completely lacking a sense of punch or decent riffwork. The leads are also over-happy and give a watered-out feeling for the most part, most notably in the title track, which I believe is the worst Iron Maiden song of all time. What must also be mentioned is the completely atrocious opening riff to Holy Smoke- I can't describe the godawfulness of it. It's really fucking horrible.\nBut, one thing that you can always count on when it comes down to Iron Maiden is that you get some really fucking good soloing. Cause that's the only thing that the album doesn't fuck up. We get some awesome solos in pretty much all of the tracks, with Holy Smoke standing out on that point. But good solos can't save this album; it'd take alot more to redeem this steaming pile of goo. I thought it was impossible to have this huge amount of bad songs on the same Iron Maiden album. Fates Warning- the supposedly introspective lyrics are just really fucking generic and dull, the vocals go nowhere and the chorus bores me to death. The Assassin actually has one cool melodic riff coming in at about 0:22, but aside from that it's just over-atmospheric and a failed attempt of making something dark. Hooks In You has that catchy 80's styled intro riff but then gets really fucking generic, boring and completely forgettable. Tail Gunner, Holy Smoke, Run Silent Run Deep, it all sucks.\n\nFact remains though, that there is one real fucking classic on the album, which totally kicks the shit out of anything else on the album. Bring Your Daughter... To The Slaughter. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, the song rules. One of the most wicked sex songs ever, with that incredibly catchy chorus, the devastating midpaced basslines, the badass solo and the atmospheric \"aahaah\" middle part with that sinister melodic riff underneath it. Yes, that song fucking rocks.\nBut, with Bring Your Daughter being the one and only exception, this album infinitely sucks goat balls, and has no place at all in the Maiden discography.\n",
        "\nLord of the Flies is the second single from the X Factor album and a surprisingly good one! \n\nIt starts out with the title track, Lord of the Flies. Should it have been the first single, because it is better than Man on the Edge? Lets see... \nLord of the Flies is 5 minutes long and a very good piece of music, not dull for one moment! It starts out with some nice guitar play and some simple drums, in not a too high tempo. It gives the song its mood right away, which is good! Blaze singing is good and the melodies are perfect. The guitar solo is not fast or spectacular, but fits perfectly in the song with its rhythmic tempo. Lord of the Flies is certainly one of Blaze's highlights in Iron Maiden and should have been the first single I think. \n\nThe second track is a cover(!) of UFO's song Doctor Doctor and Iron Maiden adapts it marvelously. This is a surpisingly good song with very catchy melodies and probably one of the best singing from Blaze ever. \nIt starts out slow and moody, but then goes in in a bit faster tempo. I have to be honest and say that this cover is better than Lord of the Flies. It feels strange to say that a cover by Iron Maiden is as good as some of their own best songs, but the truth will set you free... \n\nThe third track is also a cover, but of a slightly more well-known song. My Generation, originally by The Who. Iron Maidens version of it has no real heavy metal feeling, but sounds very close to the real version. Blazes voice fits amazingly good. The song is great in its original version and is also great when Iron Maiden adapts it. \n\nThe Lord of the Flies single is a very solid release, but is extremely hard to find...sadly. Three great songs and I see absolutely no problem that Iron Maiden makes two covers. Try to get this single!\n",
        "\nSo you're riding low off of a boring album with a tepidly received singer and you decide to release a limited edition single that ranks among your worst material... can somebody say bad idea? I can. Bad idea. There are Maiden fans who consider \"Virus\" a triumph, some even call it Blaze's shining moment. I don't... it's a boring, unimaginative song with a 6 minute running time... hey just like the entire X Factor album!!!\n\nBasically... there is a really dull acoustic guitar part/bass line that would be better suited for a stoner rock song that drags on for 2 minutes before an incredibly 3 note \"chorus\" comes in. 4 minutes later a painfully generic melodic bit comes in that sucks harder than several newborns and a transvestite crackwhore.\n\nThis pile of steaming horse hockey was on Best of the Beast and has very little worth to anybody but extremely hardcore Maiden fans. Scratch it out of the cd with a quarter or something\n",
        "\nThis is an excellent performance from January 19, 2001 at Rock In Rio in Brazil. The band put on an excellent show, and the songs are very well performed, with all of them being on top-form throughout the whole show. Bruce's voice is better than it is on Live After Death IMO!\n\nAlthough this is an excellent performance, it would have been good to have Out Of The Silent Planet and The Fallen Angel on it, which were also played during the tour. Another minor problem I find is the camera angles change too quickly. Other than this, it's an excellent concert worthy of being in anyone's collection!\n",
        "\nWhile this single is a bit hard to find, it is worth tracking down because, along with the Angel and the Gambler singles, it contains the only official live material recorded with Blaze Bayley. But first, Futureal itself. This is a good song, in the vein of Be Quick or Be Dead, a fast and catchy album opener, and it probably should have been the first single from the album, as its appeal would undoubtedly have been greater than the appeal of the cumbersome Angel and the Gambler. Better late than never, I suppose.\n\nNow, on to the b-sides. First we get to hear the Evil that Men Do, with the lyrics butchered by Blaze, but aside from his memory lapse it is a solid rendition of the song. Following that we get Man on the Edge, the first single from the X-Factor, and once again it is a solid rendition. Finally, Maiden continues their 90s tradition of including a video clip, this time for the Angel and the Gambler, and the enjoyable video is made better by the fact that this is an edited version of the song, which doesn't drag so much. \n\nAll in all then, this is essential for Maiden completists and a good pickup for the more casual fan, who's interested in the Blaze era.\n",
        "\nFear of the Dark features Bruce's last album with Maiden for a few years, which probably was a good thing as they were going steadily downhill. Then again, Brave New World is not very good either, but that's a different story.\nFear of the Dark is an awfully inconsistent album, with a few killers, some decent songs and some boring as hell fillers.\nThe music is more straightforward than the classic Maiden, with a definite classic 80's metal vibe, while still remaining the Maiden touch.\nThe guitarwork is still very melodic but not as memorable as it usually is; many riffs are quite forgettable. Though we have some really nice solos, which also them have a classic 80's metal feeling.\nBruce's vocals are much rawer than before, and sound more aggressive and somewhat hoarse, but they are still very good.\nSteve's bassplaying is as usual very evident and well played, not much more to say on that matter.\nAnd then we have the drumming, done by Nicko McBrain. Sure, he's a very fast and nice drummer, but I do prefer Clive Burr as a drummer. His drumming was always very catchy and memorable. Not to say that Nicko is a bad drummer, but Clive is one of the best.\n\nAll in all, combining all the things I've said above, they could've put out a quite excellent album of about 8 tracks. But, now there are 12 tracks on here, and there's a bunch of forced and uninspired songs that are just plain bad.\n\nThe great songs... The speedy opening track Be Quick or Be Dead, which features Bruce's most aggressive vocal work on the entire album and some damn heavy riffing and drumming. The beautiful ballad Afraid to Shoot Strangers, which features some of Maiden's most memorable and spinechilling guitar melodies ever, and one of Bruce's cleanest and most emotional vocal performances up to date. Judas Be My Guide, which just has damn catchy riffwork and an insanely powerful and memorable chorus. And of course, the title track. Memorable guitar melodies galore here! This song is amazing. The opening verses are slow and atmospheric, before it totally speeds up, and goes into the solo which was made to play live. There are loads of guitar riffs perfect for crowd singalongs.\n\nThe mediocre songs... From Here to Eternity is quite hair metal influenced, it seems. Very catchy and upbeat, and a very straightforward guitar solo. Quite nice song, but nothing remarkable. Childhood's End is a nice, melodic song with beautiful guitar riffs playing during the chorus.\nThe Fugitive is just a decent, midpaced track. Nothing remarkable, neither bad nor good. Chains of Misery is quite catchy, more upbeat 80's metal stuff.\n\nThe bad songs... Fear is the Key is midpaced, and just utterly boring. Until it reaches the final section, where Bruce makes a complete fool of himself. Hearing him saying, \"they're telling liiies and liiies and liiiiiiiiies\" in a very whiny voice hurts my ears. Wasting Love is a ballad that tries to be beautiful, but ends up quite forgettable. The Apparition... There's just one vers, and it goes on throughout the entire song except for a rather boring solo. And that vers is the worst piece of crap they've ever done. Interesting lyrics can't save this from being Maiden's possibly worst song ever. Weekend Warrior is just awkward. It's too upbeat and silly, the riffs are annoying and forgettable, blah blah blah. Basically, this song sucks.\n\nAll in all, it could be a great album, but there's too much shit on here. If they just sad down and tried really hard, they could come up with one or two more great songs to complete this album, and then they could throw away all the crap. But, what's done is done, so in an attempt to forget this failure, I'll give Powerslave a spin. Good ol' Powerslave.\n",
        "\nThe Wickerman is one of the stronger tracks on Brave New World, as it nicely combines the elements of old and new Maiden. It's fast and very catchy, and it of course features the outstanding sing-along chorus. The video included here is one of Maiden's better ones, certainly nice departure from the standard live style that characterizes most of their recent videos.\n\nThe real treats here, however, are the b-sides. We get to hear a couple of songs from the Blaze era, sung by Bruce Dickinson, and as both of them are fast and up-tempo, his vocals are more suited. It gives a little insight into how the Blaze albums would have sounded with Maiden's best singer. The other two songs are much older, and while Killers has been a b-side twice before, it's a song one never gets tired of hearing. Powerslave is another oldie they brought back for the 1999 reunion tour, and its always been a favorite of mine. \n\nAll in all this is a great single, and a great release to re-introduce Bruce. My only complaint is that the alternate, radio-edit, of Wickerman should have been included, since it is a bit hard to track down.\n",
        "\nAlthough I am very pleased with this set, I feel that it lacks a few things. But first of all, the case and packaging are outstanding, and it really looks very nice on the shelf. The shot glass is fun and the scroll is an improvement over the version of the family tree which was included with A Real Dead One 10 years back. \n\nNow, on to the music itself. The highlight of this box is undoubtedly the Beast Over Hammersmith. This was the tour that was the real start of Maiden's reign as the best band in heavy metal, and being able to hear it 20 years later is a real treat. The setlist is wonderful, containing rare works like Total Eclipse, Another Life, and Children of the Damned, as well as Maiden's best-known songs like Hallowed Be Thy Name and the Number of the Beast. While some feel these songs have lost something over the years, this show demonstrates their power when they were new. Other highlights include Phantom of the Opera and Murders in the Rue Morgue.\n\nThe second double-cd features 4 shows originally hear on the BBC network, and while it is enjoyable, it can't touch Beast Over Hammersmith. The first bit, which is the best part, features 4 songs performed in 1979, with Doug Sampson and Tony Parsons, who were out of the band by the time anything official was released. Next we have the show from Reading 1982, which unfortunately has much the same setlist as the Beast Over Hammersmith. It is a wonderful show to hear, but given the wealth of Maiden live material, it would have been nice to hear some quality recordings of the Piece of Mind or Somewhere in Time album tours. The second disc of the BBC archives set also contains 2 shows. The first is Reading 1980, a worthy inclusion due to the presence of Paul Dianno. Live material featuring him is somewhat rare, and it's nice to have a professionally-recorded complete show. The second half of the disc is a selection of songs recorded in 1988 at Donington. I believe the only songs not included here can be found on the Clairvoyant single, so for all intents and purposes this show is complete. It of course sounds very good, and is fun to listen to, but here again I question the inclusion of this material in particular. The set is a stripped-down version of Maiden England, and I would have preferred something from another tour. Perhaps Maiden could have included some live songs recorded with Blaze? While it's true that he isn't their most popular ex-member, it seems silly to overlook six years of the band's career in what is supposed to be a retrospective. \n\nThe last double-cd contains the so-called \"Best of the B-sides.\" I don't generally like best-ofs, because the songs I would include often don't coincide with the band's choices. Furthermore, most of this material has now been released 4 times, first on the original single, then in the 1st 10 Years boxset, next on the Castle 1995 re-issues, and now here. Sadly, the songs that aren't included are also the ones which are particularly hard to track down. The b-sides to Wasting Love, for instance, including unavailable anywhere else live renditions of Holy Smoke and the Assassin, are not included. The obscure b-side, I live My Way, is also not here, nor is the live rendition of Wrathchild, only to be found on the American Maiden Japan release. Thus, \"Best of the b-sides\" is in my opinion the weakest part of this collection.\n\nOverall, however, this release is a nice way to bide your time until the next Maiden album is released, even though I can't help thinking about ways it could have been better!\n",
        "\nThis album is simply amazing, Maiden dominates and conquers every song they play on this live album. Bruce's singing on this is at its best, the triple guitar attack, Janick Gers, Dave Murray, and Adrian Smith allow for all the studio complexity to be played live. Stave Harris is flawless as usual, his base seems to blow through everything and make its presence, but not overshawdow the rest of the band. Nicko Mcbrian dominates on drums, the fills are amazing, working well with the bass. The whole band is playing so well to gether on this album, all at the same spead, its amazing.\nA few of the tracks witch stand out are Iron Maiden, Brace New World, The Whicker Man, Run To The Hills, and Fear Of The Dark. On Rock in Rio Maiden preforms the second best version of the song Iron Maiden, only to be surpassed by the live Iron Maiden from Live After Death. When that opening riff from Iron Maiden hits you it sends goosebumps down your spine, then it comes back again, and again!\nBruce blows everything away on Brave New world with his vocals. His sings with such intensity, as well as the rest of the band backing him up with intense playing.\nFear of the Dark is deliciously evil sounding on this album. What makes it even better is the audiance singing and humming along. The intensity on this track of Rock In Rio can not be matched by any of the other tracks, defiantly the best live version of Fear Of The Dark.\nRock in Rio holds the best live version of Run to the Hills ever. The catchy opening riff, followed by powerful vocals by bruce and that unforgetable chorus. This will give you all the engery you need after listening to it.\nAnother great thing about this album is the audiance, they work so well with the songs, not interfearing at all. Its great.\nThe only negative thing about this album is that Iron Maiden should have chosen so better tracks. They have nothing off No Prayer For The Dying, Mother Russia would have been nice to hear live. Maiden did to much from the Blaze years, they should have only done one of his songs. They only did one track off of Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, they should have at least done Infinite Dreams. If they did a few of these tracks the album would be much better. The actualy preformance is great though.\n",
        "\nAfter 4 great/perfect albums in a row, who would've thought Maiden could make yet another masterpiece? I don't know. All I know is that \"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\" is close to perfect. Everybody in the band does an excellent job, and the songs are fantastic. Let's start with the beginning...\n\n'Moonchild' is the opener. It starts with an accoustic guitar, Bruce singing over it. Soon enough the metal kicks in. This is arguably Maiden's strongest opener ever. 'Aces High' from \"Powerslave\" is probably better, but not by much. There is a lot going on in this song, little details you won't notice 'till you've listened to it at least 10 times, maybe because it's quite fast, and the fastness is what you notice the first few times. The chorus is wonderful, and very catchy. I feel that this album is Maiden's most progressive, along with Brave New World, but unlike Brave New World it's still very aggressive, and this makes for a wonderful combination. 'Infinite Dreams' also begins calm, though with electric guitars. And it stays calm for quite a while. I could say that this is \"Seventh Son\"'s ballad song, if only for the laidback tempo, but it would still be kind of wrong. Again there's some really impressive guitar playing that you don't notice until you've heard it a lot. The lyrics are questioning whether there is an afterlife or not, interesting stuff. Some three minutes in, the song catches some speed. This section is fucking brilliant, with a great riff, and some damn good lead guitar playing. Later comes a solo, which is ,as usual for Maiden, topnotch. It slows down for the last minute, and ends with a nice Dickinson wail, of the more quiet sort. \n\n'Can I Play With Madness' is one of the hits from the album. It's one of Maiden's shortest songs, only 3:31! It's straight to the point, with a very cool verse, and a VERY catchy chorus. The lyrics are excellent, something about a wizard, and a crystal ball. I can't explain the story, but it's cool nonetheless. 'The Evil That Men Do' is perhaps the biggest hit from \"Seventh Son...\". I don't remember the chart listings, but I know was popular. Again, a very catchy song all the way through. This is part of what is so great about this album. You get a few songs which are rather easy to get into, and then there's the rest, which is just as good, but takes some time getting to know. It makes for a fine balance, and lengthens the lifespan of the record. Then there is the title track. Sadly, it's the worst song on the album. It's bleedin' 9:53 minutes long, which is fine, but the first four minutes of the song is what bothers me. It's one of Maiden's few cheesy moments. It tries to be grand, but fails. The chorus goes like this: \"Seventh son of a seventh son, seventh son of a seventh so-oo-on, seventh son of a seventh son\" etc etc., making it too repetitive, at least when the quality of the vocal line is below par, so to speak. Well, that was the four minutes of less than great material on the record, glad to be done with it. Midway throught the song, then, it calms down, and Dickinson speak a prophecy, something about the seventh son, and this section is very cool. Nicko slowly, slowly puts more pressure on the drums, so it kind of builds up again, while the guitars in a very subtle way becomes more aggressive. And then it explodes. This section, and the wild playing that comes next, is metal made perfect! So, obviously, the song redeems itslef for the last 6 minutes. \n\n'The Prophecy' is kind of the anonymous song on the record. It takes a few listens to appreciate its quality. It's a mid-tempo song, with a haunting chorus. While the main part of the song is undeniably great, the best part is the outro (for once!). It has this amazing accoustic guitars, which play a beautiful melody. I think they could'ce used that part to make a new song, it's that solid. But, as things are, it's a most excellent outro. Now for my favourite of them all, 'The Clairvoyant'. One word comes to mind: Godly, heavenly, perfect, fantastic. Well, that was four words, but nonetheless true. This is a really haunting and catchy song, with some excellent guitar play, perfect vocal lines, and a bass that is the be-all end-all of all bassplaying. Not much more to say about it, other than that it's simply perfect. The last song is 'Only the Good Die Young'. From the beginning it feels like it brings closure to the album and its concept, not only because it's the last song, but the way it's written. Really impressive. After people think the song has ended, and the album is done, comes the accoustic part from the beginning of the the first song. This is one of Maiden's most genious ideas ever! \n\nSo the minor stuff: The production is perfect, there are indeed synths on the album, but they're so subtle you forget about them, AND, Dickinson, while having a great voice, is beginning to rasp a little, something he would overdo on the next album. There you are. Now go buy.\n",
        "\nHow many live albums does Maiden need? I guess one can never have enough Maiden, but 4 albums seems a bit excessive... As far as live albums go, Rock in Rio falls firmly in the \"eh\" category, not being too good or too bad. Just eh.\n\nThe good... The rio crowd is loud as hell, and there's not much more moving than 50,000 metalheads screaming \"666! THE NUMBER OF THE BEAST!\" Dickinson is the air raid siren and was in top form the night this was recorded, barely missing a note (the exception being Wrathchild). As mentioned in the review title, Bruce singing the Clansman is stunning, amazing, cataclysmic, hell, even orgasmic. It just don't get much better than that folks, and if you had any doubt as to whether the Clansman was a godly song, get ready to throw em out the window.\n\nThe bad.... The mix is muddy as hell... i dunno if this can be attributed to the open air nature of the Rio or the crowd or what... but when I put it on in my brother's car an incessant buzz cut through alot of the instruments and put a damper on our listening experience. Another thing is the way those 3 guitars are mixed. It used to be Adrian on one channel, Dave on the other. With a 3rd guitar to deal with, sometimes things get messy.\n\nIf you're a maiden fanboy like me, get it. If you are a n00b, go for Live After Death and be merry.\n",
        "\nPiece Of Mind is one of my favorite Maiden releases to be sure. I never quite understood what the big deal about Number Of The Beast was; yeah, it was good, but inferior on many grounds compared to their other work. But this is a Piece Of Mind review, not a Number Of The Beast review. \n\nIt took awhile, but once the riffs and melodies sunk in on \u201cWhere Eagles Dare\u201d, it made me realize how brilliant the song was from a song-writing standpoint. The bass and guitar work on this track is just amazing, some of the best melodic work Maiden has done; it is also quite drawn out and open ended for an opening track- an interesting choice. In a way, the rest of this CD was much like \u201cWhere Eagles Dare\u201d for me, in the sense that it took awhile for everything to sink in. Once I found myself fully exposed to Piece Of Mind, the number of catchy hooks, melodic riffs, memorable song structures, and great vocals really hit home. I will disagree with the other reviews here and state that I liked every song, including \u201cQuest For Fire\u201d. Yes, \u201cQuest For Fire\u201d has lame lyrics, but I really like the chorus and despite the straight forward-ness of the arrangement, obviously being too easy for Iron Maiden, I enjoyed the track. I actually think that the weakest track on here is \u201cDie With Your Boots On\u201d. It is not bad, but for some reason I just found some sections in the song to be annoying, despite other sections containing terrific melodies. \n\nDickinson really starts to come into his own with his performance on Piece Of Mind. He hits some great notes and really carries songs like my personal favorite, \u201cFlight Of Icarus\u201d- his vocals make that song! The same could be said for \u201cThe Trooper\u201d and \u201cSun And Steel\u201d, which much like \u201cQuest For Fire\u201d is a little too easy, but still good to listen to. I don\u2019t mind the more simple songs on here because the CD has plenty of cleverly arranged and progressive tracks such as \u201cRevelations\u201d and \u201cTo Tame A Land\u201d. Everything else comes to together from an instrumental stand point including a lot of quality solos and of course those Maiden melodies and galloping riffs.\n\nI don\u2019t really have any major complaints with Piece Of Mind; there are a lot of classics on here along with quality musicianship throughout, and some worthy of note lyrics (\u201cQuest For Fire\u201d being the exception). I\u2019m only taking off points because, as someone pointed out, a lot of the songs lack the certain \u201cpunch\u201d and \u201coomph\u201d that later CD\u2019s would possess, especially when compared to Powerslave.\n\nSong Highlights: Where Eagles Dare, Flight Of Icarus, Revelations, The Trooper, and Sun And Steel\n",
        "\nFor the first time in Maiden\u2019s career, they skipped a year before releasing a new studio album. \u201cSomewhere In Time\u201d was released in 1986, still with the same line-up. Something had changed, though. Maiden included keyboards (or guitar synthesizers) for the very first time. Also, the sound has a futuristic feel to it. The songs themselves are mostly about space and time and distance, so it\u2019s not far from being a concept album.\n\nIt begins with \u2018Caught Somewhere In Time\u2019, and the synthesizers are instantly there. I wonder how hard it was for Maiden fans at the time to get used to it, hehe. After a short intro, it kicks off, revealing a fast, galloping rhythm. Dickinson has the same skyhigh quality of a voice as usual, and the dual guitar-playing is present. Smith and Murray is the perfect guitar-couple. What amazed me the most when first hearing this album, though, is the superb drumming from Nicko McBrain! I feel this is his best work to date. The solos in the first song are spectacular and epic. Note that Bruce Dickinson didn\u2019t write a single song in this album, and still it\u2019s high quality stuff! Amazing. Anyway, all in all, the first track is a great opener (of course, we all know Maiden have no bad openers\u2026) Track two is \u2018Wasted Years\u2019, and works as this album\u2019s ballad. Except that it\u2019s not really a ballad at all. It\u2019s just slower and even catchier than the rest of the album. The lead intro is killer, and after listening to the chorus a couple of times, you\u2019re bound to hum it for a week. This song also features a great, \u201cheartfelt\u201d solo. Perfect. \n\nThen it\u2019s onto \u2018Sea of Madness\u2019. This one\u2019s faster than \u2018Wasted Years\u2019. The bridge and the chorus is what stands out on this song. There\u2019s a certain epic feeling going through those sections of the song. Thinking of it, nearly the whole album has this epic feel, which is only a good thing. Again there\u2019s an incredible lead guitar solo present. Halfway through the song there\u2019s a section where things calm down, and it\u2019s some of the best Maiden\u2019s done yet. So far, so good. \u2018Heaven Can Wait\u2019 is next up. Again you quickly realize you\u2019re listening to another classic, and this is perhaps the best song on the album. Perhaps. This is pretty much perfect from beginning to end, with a pretty fast tempo, and a memorable chorus. About halfway through, there\u2019s a real singalong moment, just like at the end \u2018The Wicker Man\u2019. How Maiden accomplish this without it sounding cheesy, is beyond me, but there you are. Then we\u2019re treated with a second solo, which is even better than the first. Then some twin-guitar play again, before the third verse begins. No wonder I love this song. The fifth song has the longest title from Iron Maiden yet: \u2018The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner\u2019. It begins with a nice intro, then suddenly explodes into yet another fast song. There\u2019s a certain amount of galloping, as well. The chorus on this is perhaps not the most genious one of all time, but as a whole this song is extremely well written. I\u2019m glad Bruce\u2019s contributions to this album were scrapped, hearing how wonderful it is! He actually wrote a lot of accoustic stuff, but Steve didn\u2019t think it was good enough, and didn\u2019t go along with it. Well done, Steve! \n\nTrack six is without doubt the worst song here; \u2018Stranger In a Strange Land\u2019. That\u2019s not to say it stinks, it\u2019s actually very good, but it simply can\u2019t compare to the other seven songs. It has kind of a disco-feel over it in places, but it sounds better than you might expect from hearing such a description. The line \u2018no brave new world\u2019 is repeated in this song, making me think of Maiden\u2019s latest. If I were to rate this song by itself, I would\u2019ve given it a 8/10, so it\u2019s still quality stuff. The guitar solo in this is actually outstanding. Onto what is another candidate for best song on the record; \u2018De Ja Vu\u2019. A nice and moody intro, before speeding up (about every song on the album has this progression, without it getting repetitive). There\u2019s a lot of double-bass drumming from Nicko in this song. The verse, the chorus, the guitars, the bass, the singing, the drumming, the sound, the melody lines\u2026it\u2019s all so damn perfect! What\u2019s the word\u2026yes, it\u2019s orgasmic! Talking about those feelings, there\u2019s still one song left. It\u2019s the epic of the album, (not that there\u2019s any lack of epicness elsewhere on the album, but anyway), and the title is \u2018Alexander the Great\u2019. Over 8 and a half minute long, it follows nicely in the vein of \u2018To Tame a Land\u2019 and \u2018Rime of the Ancient Mariner\u2019. The intro is kind of march-based, which sounds great. It\u2019s also very moody. Lyrically speaking, the song\u2019s a bit ackward, thanks to Steve, but Bruce does what he can to make it sound great, he he succeeds. The chorus is again perfect. After four minutes the song calms a bit down, and this is where my favorite part of my song begins. Especially around the 4:52 mark. Who needs porn when you got that section?! The best thing is, that part of the song lasts quite a while, and features several killer guitar solos. The rest of the song is also killer. As you might understand, it\u2019s between this one, \u2018Heaven Can Wait\u2019, and \u2018De Ja Vu\u2019. \n\nAnother review done. Phew! But I enjoyed reviewing this one. No need to say more, is there? Go and buy it! Meanwhile I\u2019m going to listen to it one more time.\n",
        "\nFor the first time ever Iron Maiden didn\u2019t change the line-up between albums. Congratulations! It must have been a good thing too, cause \u201cPowerslave\u201d was the best album so far in their career. Released in 1984, and little did Maiden know how big their \u2018World Slavery\u2019 tour was gonna be! They once again gained in popularity, to the point where it was smart to release a live album. But that\u2019s another review. This is all about \u201cPowerslave\u201d. The production is, as with \u201cThe Number of the Beast\u201d and \u201cPiece of Mind\u201d, excellent. Producer Martin Birch really knew his stuff, and had created a timeless sound on this one. \n\n\u2018Aces High\u2019 kicks off the album, and with style. This is an upbeat, and very fast track, with some excellent dual guitar play, and an over-the-top vocal delivery from Dickinson. This is faster than anything on \u201cPiece of Mind\u201d . Looks like Maiden was out for blood again. Note the fantastic lead-guitar solos. It\u2019s a piece of perfection. After this superb first song comes the almost as excellent \u20182 Minutes to Midnight\u2019. This is another classic, and the lyrics are extremely well written. It\u2019s a little more slow-paced than \u2018Aces High\u2019, but what isn\u2019t\u2026The main riff is one of Maiden\u2019s best, and heavy metal at its best. With a very memorable chorus, you\u2019re bound to hum it daily after a couple of listens. \u2018Losfer Words (Big \u2018Orra)\u2019 is an instrumental, and their last one ever (probably). The title is a slang for Loss For Words, I guess. The rest of it makes no sense, though. At first it may seem that this track is quite a filler. There\u2019s really not much happening. But after a while you realize that this is one kick-ass track. It\u2019s not a very hummable song, but you\u2019ll appreciate it in the end. Still, it\u2019s the worst track on the album. \n\nThen we have \u2018Flash of the Blade\u2019. As with \u2018Aces..\u2019, it\u2019s a fast song, with killer riffs, and a great chorus. I don\u2019t know what went on in the Maiden camp during the recording of this album, it seems they were on speed or something. This song has a somewhat lenghty mid-section with instruments only which sound great. Dual guitars, harmonies, the works. Great material! Track number five is another fast killer and is named \u2018The Duelists\u2019. Especially the chorus is great. Also, this song has a really lenghty instrumental mid-section, which I love. This is pure class! All other metal bands, take note. Adrian and Dave is a great team, and I\u2019m glad they both joined Iron Maiden. So comes \u2018Back In the Village\u2019, the second of two Maiden songs based on the TV series \u201cThe Prisoner\u201d. Yet again it\u2019s a fast track. The chorus may be a bit stupid and overly repetitive, but it\u2019s still a great song. And the main riff is so fast and wicked, it\u2019s unbelievable! And the solo is as with the rest of the songs incredible to listen to. Phew. This album is a rollercoaster! \n\nSo comes the title track. \u2018Powerslave\u2019 is a different kind of song altogether. It\u2019s much slower than what has gone before (except for the mid-section of it), and is the closest of all the tracks to being a ballad. Not that it\u2019s even close, though. It has an Egyptian feel over it, which is not strange, considering it\u2019s about some Pharaoh. I didn\u2019t like this song at first, but it grew on me over time. Now I love it to death! Dickinson does a really great job here. As if the vocals weren\u2019t enough, the faster middle of the song is maybe the best \u201cinterlude\u201d ever. It begins slowly, with a great solo, and then it speeds up to reveal a second solo. It\u2019s this little part that is the best part of the song. Perfect, really. Then the song slows down again, and another verse and chorus with Dickinson comes along. It ends perfect. You have to hear it to\u2026you just have to hear it!\n\nLast, but far from least, is \u2018Rime of the Ancient Mariner\u2019. It\u2019s based on the poem of the same name, and it\u2019s Maiden\u2019s longest song yet. 13 and a half minute of pure bliss. It\u2019s almost progressive stuff, with all the different verses and choruses. Plus, the middle of the song is completely calm, just some words spoken, and excellent bass and guitarwork. The best part is the build-up to the last third of the song. Pay close attention to the bass. It remains the best epic of them all, in my opinion. \n\nTo sum it up real quick: This is Maiden\u2019s second best album, only beaten by \u201cSeventh Son of a Seventh Son\u201d, and you really NEED to buy it. Every song is a masterpiece. To sum it up even quicker: This album is PERFECT!\n\n",
        "\nSo this is what happens when you decide you no longer want to make epic masterpieces, but really have forgotten what the general mood of the Killers album that you are so trying to imitate was actually like.\n\nThe problem with the album is that there are no really overwhelmingly great tracks, and some of them are just all-out horrible, and even among the good ones, some stuff seems to be overtly recycled. Example: Tailgunner. Nice speed metal, but didn't they have a song called Aces High, that did the same thing, only better?\n\nHoly Smoke is probably the best song on here, though it features the quite out of place line \"flies around shit, bees around honey\" - somehow, when I think of Iron Maiden, I don't think of them spouting off random obscenities. Maybe that's just me. \n\nOther okay songs include the hilariously titled Public Enema Number One, and even Bring Your Daughter to the Slaughter (it's not a great song, but far better than some others I'll mention in a second) and also Mother Russia, which is decent, but nowhere close to the real epic numbers they had been able to come up with. Oh and Hooks in You is fun and catchy, despite the overwhelmingly silly lyrics.\n\nBoring: No Prayer for the Dying. Nice, pleasant, but a bit too elevator-music for my tastes. Fates Warning, I cannot remember this song right now, seeing as I haven't listened to this album in a few months. The Assassin is pretty terrible. Really, enough dissecting this album - it lacks the overwhelmingly cool guitar work of Adrian Smith (okay it lacks EVERYTHING of Adrian Smith ... he's gone. Janick Gers is okay, but just not a guitar legend). Oh and the album cover is silly.\n",
        "\nWith the release of 1982\u2019s \u201cThe Number of the Beast\u201d, Iron Maiden got a big breakthrough in the world of metal, and the future of the band seemed bright. It was a little setback, then, that drummer Clive Burr decided he didn\u2019t want to continue as a part of Iron Maiden anymore. Due to \u201cmusical differences\u201d he called it quits. This was very sad, especially since Burr was one of the greatest drummers at the time. Steve Harris & Co. didn\u2019t give up, of course. Members of Maiden had come and gone for years, so they quickly looked around for a new drummer. They found Nicko McBrain. With drumming skills much better than his name, he would prove to be a staying member of Iron Maiden. \n\n1983 saw the release of \u201cPiece of Mind\u201d, Maiden\u2019s fourth studio album. An album that is a little more laidback than its prequel, it proved to be Maiden\u2019s biggest seller yet. It all kicks off with a short drum intro from McBrain, probably to prove that he\u2019s as great as Burr (Personally, I don\u2019t think he can beat Burr, but he\u2019s still good), before the guitar-riff begins. \u2018Where Eagles Dare\u2019 is playing, and it\u2019s great. A mid-paced song based on the movie of the very same name (with Clint Eastwood and all), and featuring a rather lengthy instrumental mid-section , where you can hear gunfire. The main guitar-riff is godly, both in the verse/chorus, and its offspring in the instrumental sections. As usual for Maiden, the chorus is very memorable, and all in all it\u2019s almost the best song on the record. Track two, \u2018Revelations\u2019, has got to be the best song on the album. The opening riffs are great, the song itself is great, and the ending is perfect. It\u2019s a ballad, though occasionally fast-paced. The intro verse is a passage taken from the Bible, probably from Revelations. The whole song is very melodic, and the verses/chorus are wonderful. Dickinson wrote the song himself, and proves beyond a doubt how good a songwriter he really is. For further proof, look up on his two latest solo studio albums. \u2018Flight of Icarus\u2019 is the third song, and it too is superb. It was the first single off the album, and is based on the legend of Icarus. A kind of slow-paced song, but it still packs a punch, and of course a melodic hook or two. It\u2019s really a song not easily comparable to other Maiden songs, and it stands out as a really memorable track. Dickinson shines on this with his excellent vocal delivery, and the end guitar-solo is kickass. \n\nNumber four is \u2018Die With Your Boots On\u2019. This is a faster song, though compared to \u201cNumber\u2026\u201d, it\u2019s not really fast at all. It\u2019s very cool, and the chorus is a real singalong one. And don\u2019t forget the excellent guitar solo! Really cool stuff. The song that the majority of people will say is the best song on display here, is \u2018The Trooper\u2019. And it IS great. From the twin-guitar attack at the beginning, to the in-your-face verse and the galloping rhythm, it\u2019s a real treat. I think the two solos in this one is two of Maiden\u2019s greatest ever. So what do we have so far? Five GREAT songs, almost perfect every one of them. It\u2019s too good to be true, right? Of course it is. Otherwise I would\u2019ve rated it as high, if not higher than \u2018Number\u2026\u2019. Track number six, \u2018Still Life\u2019, is sort of the title track. It begins calm, with a nice accoustic/lead guitar intro. A problem is that I found Dickinson\u2019s vocals here not quite as good as he usually is. When he tries to sing nice and calm, he doesn\u2019t quite succeed (he would in later years, though, especially on \u201cBrave New World\u201d). Overall, a good song, but nothing special, really. It just doesn\u2019t have that \u201cpunch\u201d that most Maiden songs have. \n\nThen we have \u2018Quest For Fire\u2019. Hardly a killer song, it features a very simple rhythm pattern, and stupid lyrics. It\u2019s really cheesy, and I wish it would\u2019ve been left off of the album. It\u2019s just another \u2018Gangland\u2019. Good news, then, that the b-side \u2018Sun And Steel\u2019 is better. It\u2019s featured on the remastered version of \u201cPiece of Mind\u201d as track number eight, and it\u2019s a good rocker, with a catchy chorus, and an interesting verse. Not really much else to say about it. This album\u2019s epic track is the last; \u2018To Tame a Land\u2019. Lyrically, it\u2019s based on \u2018Dune\u2019, and it would\u2019ve been named after it too, if it weren\u2019t for the jackass author of said novel that didn\u2019t want a band like Iron Maiden to represent his sacred work. Anyway, the song has a bit of an Egyptian vibe, no doubt because of the lyrical content (y\u2019know, dunes and all that). The structure of the song changes several times as it goes on, and all the instruments gets it their way. The numerous solos/twin guitars, the bass, the drums; it all comes together in this song to make an outstanding epic. Dickinson is actually shoved into the backseat. But what he does here is great still, even if it\u2019s an instrument\u2019s song. It was actually Harris\u2019 favorite song for years. \n\nOk. So what we have is another great album from the best band in the world. I rate it lower than \u201cNumber\u2026\u201d because of the weaker second half, and the slight laidback feel of the album. This would be turned around with \u201cPowerslave\u201d, luckily. Still, nine out of ten ain\u2019t bad, is it\u2026\n\n",
        "\nThis is what power metal is supposed to sound like. When you actually accent the guitar in the production, put the keyboards to tasteful use, and actually write songs instead of running off at 452 beats per minute with over-amplified double bass, just because you can.\n\nIron Maiden had had an amazing streak of having their shit together before this album. Piece of Mind, Powerslave, Live After Death, and Somewhere in Time are classics in their own right, but somehow on this album they managed to exceed even that.\n\nThe opening track, Moonchild, begins with a bit of an acoustic intro, which will actually be paralleled at the end of the album to kinda wrap things up. It's a concept album, you're allowed to do things like that. The song then blasts into full speed with some nicely done riffs, adding a few great solos in there. The lead guitar on this album is frankly mind-blowing. No wankery to be found here, everything has its proper place, and even the five and one half minute (!) instrumental passage in the title track is completely memorable and not at all overdone - if you hear it four or five times, you will remember it note for note. \n\nThe other highlights of this album include the awesome \"Infinite Dreams\", which has to be the standard by which all ballads are judged. It starts off soft, picks up in the middle, and has a great solo. Ding, we have a winner. Also, the last track, \"Only the Good Die Young\" is great especially for that bass intro. \n\nBut, the best song on here has to be \"The Clairvoyant\", just for one line.... \"but for all his power, could not foresee his own demise!!!\" - there's a live version out there that's a B-side on one of the singles, and is very much worth tracking down. In fact, the entire 8/20/88 Live in Donington show, or the 11/27/88 Birmingham show (which is available on the \"Maiden England\" video) are both worth finding, because these songs come off live absolutely fantastically. \n\nThere are no weak spots on this album - not even the controversial \"Can I play with Madness\", which yes, could have been a radio hit in 1988. All that means is that radio didn't completely blow donkey balls in 1988. So there. They used to play good stuff. Remember that the next time you hear \"War Pigs\" on your classic rock station.\n\nThe album is flawless, it is one of the best metal albums ever. Iron Maiden never had a finer moment.\n",
        "\nSo comes the third album. Iron Maiden had enjoyed success with their two first albums. They had even released a live EP called \u2018Maiden Japan\u2019 after the second album. The truth is, though, \u2018Killers\u2019 was a disappointment after the mindblowing debut album, and vocalist Paul Di\u2019Anno was starting to loose it. Maiden had to cancel several shows because of Di\u2019Anno was getting drunk or worse. They needed someone to replace him. So, they began their search and found Bruce Dickinson. Bruce was at the time the vocalist in a band called Samson, and called himself Bruce Bruce for some reason. Steve Harris and the rest of Iron Maiden was of course very interested in having him join. Bruce wasn\u2019t basking in any particular success with Samson, and thought this could be his way to stardom. He joined, and Di\u2019Anno got the boot. And then Iron Maiden recorded their third album.\n\n\u201cThe Number of the Beast\u201d was the band\u2019s breakthrough record. While they grew bigger through the rest of the 80\u2019s, this is the album that really got the snowball rolling. It is considered by rock critics to be their best album, either this or Piece of Mind, while the fans think of it as one of Maiden\u2019s best, perhaps not quite the masterpiece \u2018Seventh Son\u2026\u2019 is, but still an incredible record.\n\nThe record starts with \u2018Invaders\u2019. A fast, upbeat track, it\u2019s a great opener, though not quite the quality that most of the rest of the album possess. There\u2019s a definite improvement in sound over the first two albums, and Dickinson\u2019s incredible voice makes Di\u2019Anno\u2019s voice pale in comparison. Maiden really hit the jackpot with that decision. Song number two, \u2018Children of the Damned\u2019, is a semi-ballad. The intro is reminiscent of Metallica\u2019s \u2018The Unforgiven\u2019, though if anyone\u2019s ripped of anyone, it\u2019s the other way around. It\u2019s a really beautiful song, and the first song on the album where new vocalist Bruce really shines. Towards the end of the song, it gets faster, and Clive Burr\u2019s drums in that section sounds fantastic. He really was one of the best drummers. Then comes \u2018The Prisoner\u2019, a song based on the television series of the same name. Somehow it almost outclasses the song that preceded it, and that\u2019s quite a task. This one is a faster song, with a ripping verse, and a very catchy chorus. The most impressive section of the song is the bridge, though, where bassist Steve Harris outdoes himself. It\u2019s like a leadguitar solo, only on bass. Incredible stuff, really. Track four is named \u201922 Acacia Avenue\u2019, the sequel to \u2018Charlotte the Harlot\u2019, found on the debut album. The basis for the song was actually something guitarist Adrian Smith brought with him from his previous band, and it was reworked into this song. It starts very slow, with a cool riff, and then it suddenly gets fast. The guitar work is great as usual, and Dickinson\u2019s performance is a treat to listen to. Closer to the end there\u2019s a really great guitar solo from either Adrian Smith or Dave Murray. Although I play the guitar, it\u2019s impossible for me to distinguish between the two. They are both two of the world\u2019s greatest guitarists in the world, so it doesn\u2019t really matter if I can make them apart or not. The song itself is not quite as good as the previous two, but it still has a high quality.\n\nThen comes the title track. This is one of the most legendary songs in metal history, and of course one of Maiden\u2019s best. Not an overly complicated song, but it\u2019s perfectly executed. It starts with spoken word by some guy (I\u2019ve heard it is Vincent Price, but I\u2019m not sure), taken from the Bible, and then the riff kicks in. Bruce starts to sing, and after a few lines it all explodes in a high-pitched scream of fury. Or is it desperation. I\u2019m not sure. It sounds great anyway. And then the verse kicks in, which is so great to listen to, words can\u2019t really describe it. After a couple of verses, two of the most incredible guitar solos comes along. You should really listen carefully when those kick in. The chorus is simple, with only two lines, but still holds up by far. And this is only the second best track on the record! Track number six is probably one of Maiden\u2019s most well-known songs ever. \u2018Run to the Hills\u2019. A very cool song, with a galloping rhythm. It\u2019s very repetitive, but it\u2019s so good it doesn\u2019t really matter. You could say it\u2019s this record\u2019s version of \u2018Running Free\u2019. Bruce sings REALLY high-pitched on this song, and because of that he sometimes have trouble singing it live. He did it perfectly at the concert I went to in 2000, though. Actually, he\u2019s having more trouble singing \u2018The Number of the Beast\u2019, now that I think of it. Anyway, let\u2019s go on with the review. \u2018Gangland\u2019 is the next track. Sadly, it can\u2019t compare to the rest of the album in terms of quality. It\u2019s co-written by Clive Burr, and therefore it\u2019s kind of the drums that get the attention. The verse is allright, but the chorus is not good at all. The guitar solos are boring, and all in all it\u2019s better to skip the song. \n\nIf you have the \u201998 remastered version of this album, there\u2019s a bonus track on it. Track number eight is that bonus track. \u2018Total Eclipse\u2019 is a song that was released as a b-side to one of the singles from \u2018The Number\u2026\u2019, but it\u2019s actually better than \u2018Gangland\u2019. I think it was written at the same time as the rest of the tracks, but somehow it reminds me of the hybrid between \u2018The Number of the Beast\u2019 and \u2018Piece of Mind\u2019. It\u2019s a bit slower than most stuff on the album, and very moody. I\u2019m glad it was finally included. The last song on the album, track number nine, is \u2018Hallowed Be Thy Name\u2019. This is arguably Maiden\u2019s ultimate masterpiece. It\u2019s a real epic from start to finish, and was the start of those grand, neverending songs that Maiden concluded their three next albums with. It\u2019s about a man that is about to be executed, and about the thoughts that goes through his head in these last hours. The instrumental sections of the song are wonderful, and it\u2019s the guitars that really makes this song head and shoulders above almost anything else. One incredible riff after the next, mixed with harmonies and killer lead-guitar solos. The end is so perfect it brings a tear to my eye. My God, I\u2019m so impressed! \n\nPhew. I\u2019m finally at the end of the review. This is an album that every metal fan should own. It defined what Maiden was/is all about, and they have kept this going until this day. Of course, they skipped the 90\u2019s, but that\u2019s another set of reviews. My final words must be: If you own this album, you\u2019re one lucky human being. If you still haven\u2019t got it (and NO, MP3\u2019s does NOT count!), you should be ashamed of yourself, confess your dark sin and go buy the album. \n\n",
        "\nAfter the first album was released, the fans quickly screamed for another one. Somehow it seems Iron Maiden rushed out this album, as it's nowhere as good as the debut. The main problem is that many of the songs are difficult to remember, so the album becomes sort of a blur. I admit it now, I must listen to each song as I review them. On a good note, though, the sound has improved from the debut, while it still has some way to go before it's perfect.\n\nThe first track here is 'The Ides of March'. It's an instrumental, and really an intro to the rest of the album, as it's only a minute and a half long. But that doesn't get in the way of it's remarkable quality. It's without doubt the best intro on any record yet. Then it's show time, as 'Wrathchild' begins. It's an extremely good song, aggressive and a memorable chorus. Track number three is what I think is the best song on display here: 'Murders In the Rue Morgue' is a fast rocker with a deceivingly slow opening, and it's simply a testament to Maiden's incredible song writing skills. So far 'Killers' has all the quality the debut contains. But from song number four it goes a bit downhill. The name of the track is 'Another Life', and though it's cool, it's impossible to remember the damn song. It's fast and relatively simple, and worth hearing, but that's it. After that little setback comes 'Genghis Khan', another instrumental. It's a bit hard to memorize that as well, but it's an incredible track, with a haunting leadguitar twin solo in the middle. What you notice with the next track, 'Innocent Exile', is that Steve Harris' bass is even more present on this album. 'Innocent Exile' starts with a bass intro, and that's quite uncommon in any band. Except for that, there's little to say about this track. It's cool, but again it doesn't stand out in any way. It seems a good word for this album is \"anonymous\".\n\nNow the album gets an uplift with 'Killers'. The title track is a great one, and especially the drums are impressive. An interesting fact is that the guitars are a bit ugly, something Maiden's not exactly known for. Luckily, it's only this song. As with most other songs, it's hardly easy to remember, but it's as it is with the movie 'Raging Bull'. I seldom want to see it, but when I first do, it's incredible from start to finish. Well, so this album isn't incredible from start to finish, but it's always better than I remember it as. Track number eight is 'Prodigal Son'. It's this album's answer to 'Remember Tomorrow' and 'Strange World', if not quite as good. Surprisingly, it's sticks in your mind from day one, a rather unusual thing on 'Killers'. So comes 'Purgatory'. It's an okay song only, but with a very cool middle section. Again, it's fast and furious, as many songs on this album, but fast and furious doesn't equal good quality, now does it. All in all, a rather pointless song. Track number ten is named 'Twilight Zone'. Okay, but nothing more. This is what most people would call a filler. Gruesome to say that about any Maiden song, but it's true. 'Drifter' is the very last song, thank God, for the second half on this album leaves something to be desired. This doesn't impress me at all. It could have been the worst song of them all, if it weren't for a nice middle section, where the song calms down. Also the drums are a bit better then average.\n\nSo, we have come to the end. It's a mixed album, where the memorable tracks are few and far between. If it had been any other classic heavy metal band, this album would have been enough, but Maiden can do much better than this. It's a cool record to listen to, but when the final track ends, it's as if you feel empty inside, because you can't remember much about it at all. I know this record is for someone their favourite Maiden album, but I just can't see why. So, it may seem that Maiden are one-hit wonders; one great album, and that's it. But that couldn't be further from the truth. A year on, Maiden would conquer the world with their third album, and be proclaimed Satanists at the same time. 6..6..6...\n\n\n",
        "\nAnother Iron Maiden live album? This is the fifth live album from Steve Harris, Bruce Dickinson and company, following 1985's classic \"Live after Death\" and 1993's less than classic, but still enjoyable \"A Real Live One,\" \"A Real Dead One,\" and \"Live At Donnington.\" \"A Real Live One\" and \"A Real Dead One\" were my introduction to live albums, and as lonely teenager, I really loved them. As a lonely adult, I still like them, but realize that there are better produced and performed live albums out there. \"Rock In Rio,\" is easily my favorite live Maiden release since their \"Live After Death\" masterpiece. \n\nThis album was recorded in Rio De Janeiro, at the \"Rock In Rio\" festival, in front of Iron Maiden's biggest audience ever -- and they really make themselves heard on this album. The crowd sounds familiar with the band's newer material proving that Iron Maiden are just as vital as they've ever been. Six songs from the band's 2000 reunion opus, \"Brave New World,\" are included in the setlist, with five appearing on the first disc. Two songs from the Blaze Bayley era also appear: \"Sign of the Cross\" and \"The Clansman.\" It's interesting to hear Bruce Dickinson's interpretation of these songs. \n\nThe classics are here as well: \"Hallowed Be Thy Name,\" \"The Trooper,\" \"Wrathchild,\" etc. However, when you have 12 studio albums and have released as many classic metal songs as Maiden have, fans are inevitably going to gripe about certain songs not making the cut, especially fans who aren't into the band's newer material. Personally, I am thankful for the overabundance of new songs on \"Rock In Rio.\" The old songs can be heard on the band's previous four live albums. If you want to hear \"Aces High,\" then go listen to \"Live After Death. \n\nSo, how does Maiden sound after all these years? The band's performance is top notch, and the addition of the third guitarist gives the songs a fuller sound. Bruce Dickinson's vocals are great as well, although his voice is not quite a powerful as it used to be. If you've heard his singing on the \"Beast On the Road\" tour, then you'll know exactly what I mean. When he screams \"the Mercenaaaaaaaaary\" to introduce the song of the same name, it sounds pretty ugly. Thankfully, these \"ugly\" moments are few number, and I find that Bruce's vocal performance on \"Rock In Rio\" is much better and infinitely more inspired than on Maiden's live releases in the '90's. Bruce sings with uncharted softness on the opening verses of \"Sign of the Cross\" and \"Brave New World,\" and even growls certain words and lines throughout the album (eg. \"show them no fear\"). \n\nOverall, an absolute must have for any self-respecting Iron Maiden fan.\n"
