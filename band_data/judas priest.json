        "\nIt\u2019s hard for me to accept this, since I\u2019m taking about one of my top 3 bands of all time here, but Priest\u2019s discography is certainly a headache-inducing roller coaster in terms of quality throughout each and any of their decades of production. Unlike other metal acts with sufficiently long discographies, who had a clear ascent from solid debuts up to their masterpieces or best works in a linear, progressive way, or at least had long periods of great production and performance before some quality loss, Priest were totally hit-or-miss release after release ever since their 1974 debut, Rocka Rolla. The 80s were no different for the Brits, as the classic (but clearly overrated) British Steel brought them greater recognition amidst the non-metal masses, soon followed by the preposterous Point of Entry, one of the band\u2019s lowest\u2026 points in their career, a clear and utterly vapid attempt at even more mainstream appeal. \n\nThankfully, 1982\u2019s Screaming for Vengeance saw the band reincorporate their signature fiery metal into their sound, even though the commercial hard rock vibe wasn\u2019t entirely eradicated\u2026 as it wouldn\u2019t leave them until a new change in decade. The deadly introductory combo of \u201cThe Hellion / Electric Eye\u201d is one of the most hair-raising starts of an album ever, displaying the band\u2019s top qualities right away: the scorching dual-guitar attack by Downing/Tipton and the Metal God\u2019s powerful and inimitable vox. The guitar tone is delicious, and the warm and organic rhythmic section, while never spectacular during the 80s, sounded tighter and meaner than on the last pair of releases. \u201cRiding on the Wind\u201d might be even heavier, and Rob really reaches the stratosphere, going almost \u201cPainkiller\u201d-like on this one. \u201cBloodstone\u201d is more laid back yet still heavy, hard rocking number with great riffs and awesome lyrics and vocals, being more potent at its chorus section. \u201c(Take These) Chains\u201d, written by American songwriter Bob Halligan Jr., is a semi power-ballad with enough atmosphere and hooks to hold its own among the album\u2019s strongest tracks. Sadly, side-A ends up with a totally disposable anthem-like rocker in \u201cPain and Pleasure\u201d, which sounds like the advent of Turbo.\n\nSide-B holds longer tunes, but for me personally, it\u2019s way more uneven. The title-track is a raging heavy metal marvel which I wish the band had played more often live, especially recently. It\u2019s the heavier, most complex and angrier tune here by a thousand miles and then some. Now, that one\u2019s the advent of the faster, darker, meaner and much better Defenders of the Faith. After that helluva track comes the band\u2019s most famous song and biggest commercial hit ever, especially amidst non-metalheads, \u201cYou\u2019ve Got Another Thing Comin\u2019\u201d. Now, I honestly couldn\u2019t care less if this song awarded the band\u2019s persistence in trying to break into the mainstream with millions of Sterling pounds. Fact is, it\u2019s a (very famous) filler, as the band have pointed out many times. It\u2019s basically a \u2018Halforized\u2019 ZZ Top tune, and a 5-minute waste of time when one could be listening to \u201cThe Sentinel\u201d instead. I guess the Priest fanbase is divided between those who prefer the band\u2019s commercial side and the ones who prefer the band\u2019s METAL side, which Screaming for Vengeance\u2019s follow up has in spades. I\u2019ll take the album with the knife-throwing dude in it, thank you very much. Last couple of tracks feel more \u201cThing Comin\u2019\u201d than \u201cVengeance\u201d, with \u201cFever\u201d being the best of them. \n\n40 years later, Screaming for Vengeance stands tall as one of heavy metal\u2019s most iconic records. Nonetheless, pretty much like British Steel two years prior, it suffers some overrating due to its commercial hits, but as a whole it is a much more potent record. I also slightly prefer this to the band\u2019s final record from the 80s, \u201cRam it Down\u201d, but both have the similarity of being the precursors and stepping (blood)stones of Priest\u2019s prime form releases of the 80s and 90s decades, respectively. Perhaps if the band had managed to come up with 2001\u2019s bonus track \u201cPrisoner of Your Eyes\u201d (a Turbo cast-off with outstanding guitar solos) originally here, instead of the vastly overplayed \u201cYou\u2019ve Got Another Thing Comin\u2019\u201d, I\u2019d rank it closer to Defenders\u2026, but still, a step in the right direction for one of metal\u2019s greatest bands, albeit one with the most perplexing discographies.\n",
        "\nConsidering that Glenn Tipton is suffering from Parkinson's, and it fluctuates in severity for him; seemingly getting to be especially bad very shortly after this album was released, \"Firepower\" might very well be Judas Priest's final album. At time of writing, it remains to be seen one way or the other, but I, for one, would not be surprised if this is how it ends. Either way, after such a garbage album that was \"Redeemer of Souls,\" it's nice that they were able to put out at least one more solid album. \"Firepower\" certainly isn't going to be an album that makes it to the top of many people's list, that's for sure, but that shouldn't be a discredit to it. It's still a good, very serviceable album. Especially for how late in the band's career it is. I find \"Firepower\" to be the most consistently solid album since their reunion, but it also has far fewer highlights than both \"Angel of Retribution\" and \"Nostradamus.\"\n\nFor better AND for worse, \"Firepower\" is a very simple album. Priest doesn't try to do anything remotely complicated or out of the box on this release. Almost every song the record has to offer is a simplistic one. It follows very typical rules and never at all moves out of the comfort of simplicity. This can be a very good thing, because this late in the game, the band might not have had it in them to start to get cute and complicated. It also might have been that they were smart enough to see a lot of times their fans become extremely polarized by their more ambitious attempts and wanted to sail away with something that almost everyone can agree was solid. But at the same time, it's not a good thing, because SO many of these songs blend together. So many of them are just more of the same thing, with the only difference being the chorus. The album, as a whole, might not have suffered because of this, but it also makes it so very few of the tracks on their own are worth remembering and going back to. Priest made their own double edged sword with \"Firepower,\" in a sense.\n\nI'll start with what I find to be the highlights of the album. There are really only two tracks that I think are spectacular and stellar enough to stand high above the rest of this album. First, \"Traitor's Gate.\" The intro is a slow walk to the gallows, and an explosive riff follows behind it. The flow and rhythm of this song are quite unique. It gives me very slight pirate metal vibes in how it moves. The chorus is really where it shines. Halford is exploding with a mix of both his normal notes on the song but also backed with these panicked and frenzied high notes that give the chorus a sense of urgency and fire. \"Traitor's Gate\" has riffs, it has a small Priest chant section at the end, it has a great chorus, and it flows wonderfully. It has a little bit of everything. \"Necromancer\" is the other true highlight to me. Halford has a magical performance here. On the verses, he sounds terrified in his story telling, and then on the pre-chorus and chorus, he sounds sinister and evil. The riffs across the track are very good too, but the song really is held up by just how well Halford is selling it. He makes you feel every single moment and emotion across this track. \"Necromancer\" shows that age doesn't necessarily have to kill a career. What Halford might have lost due to his age in pure raw high note power and an ability to hold long notes, he easily makes up for with both emotion and versatility in his still amazingly impressive range. It's all about adapting to changes, not trying to fight against them.\n\nThere isn't really many times \"Firepower\" dips into 'bad' territory, but there are a lot of moments where the album is just unfortunately tedious and very predictable. \"Never the Hero\" and \"Rising from Ruins\" might as well be the exact same song, in my opinion. Are either of them bad? No. Not at all. But they follow the EXACT same patterns. I mean almost exactly. A strong start, then they both mellow back for the verses a bit to let Halford sing, and then they get heavier again for an attempt at a catchy chorus. Repeat a bit, toss in a solo, and end the song. Both of these songs really sound like they just opened a Judas Priest playbook and re-worked a single paint by numbers track twice. Both of these songs are like someone following a template and changing it very slightly and calling it a day. The songs are both serviceable, but they both lack originality and their own identity.\n\nThe title track and \"Lightning Strike\" are pretty much the same, but follow a slightly heavier template. They both have that very typical and predictable feel to them, both are just about the same length, and both have similar flow in how they move. \"Lightning Strike\" is a little bit catchier, and the title track is a little bit heavier with more well...fire to it, but they're still very similar tracks. Again, I'll point out that I'm not saying these tracks are bad. I actually like both of these songs a decent bit. The title track a bit more so, but still. The problem is that they're so typical and follow such a familiar formula. And there are SO many songs just like that. A couple of 'safe' tracks on an album is expected. But when you have a fourteen song album and the vast majority of that album are these kind of safe, familiar, predictable rockers, it gets kind of stale.\n\n\"Spectre\" and \"Lone Wolf\" are two more songs I pair together. They both have a somewhat bluesier feel, and both are slower paced and 'darker' feeling tracks. Between these two, the former is definitely the more memorable track for me. Once again, it's really Halford that's making the song. He really moves the track and tells the story. His vocals are extremely varied, and he goes from deeper and darker to higher and catchier during the chorus. \"Lone Wolf\" has that very, very noticeable blues inspired metal groove to it that a lot of bands from the same time period have. There's really nothing wrong with this, but I think as soon as this song gets going, anyone with any metal listening experience will feel like they've heard this exact song done by different bands many times. \"Lone Wolf\" is a solid song; but again, it adds to the very predictable nature of the album as a whole.\n\nThere are also only two tracks that I think are a bit below standard on the record. To preface, you can still do much worse than either of these tracks, but they're still a bit lacking. First, \"Flamethrower\" is a disappointment to me. For a song with this name, it should be WAY cooler than it is. The main riff is pretty middling, and the verse melodies are horrible. Halford is just kind of rambling this low register across a boring riff in an unpleasant and uncaring tone. Then, the pre-chorus out of nowhere has this soaring and overly optimistic tone. The chorus than lowers that to be between them both. It's weird and out of place. The chorus is okay, but really should have been better. \"Evil Never Dies\" is the other track that just does nothing at all for me. It's almost a parody track. Unlike \"Necromancer,\" where the band sells a sinister nature by letting the story telling in their playing/singing speak for itself, Halford is really being tongue in cheek here and trying to make you feel the 'evil' in the title. Much like \"Flamethrower,\" after these darker verses, the song suddenly has this really overly happy and campy pre-chorus that has no business being there before it dives back down low for a boring chorus. That one part of the song just comes absolutely out of left field and doesn't stick around long enough at all to justify itself. It's just a weird disjointed song that isn't sure where to go with itself.\n\nDespite all of my gripes about \"Firepower\" being a simplistic and rather repetitive experience, it's still a very good album in Priest's discography. It finally gives Richie Faulkner a decent studio album, too! The unfortunate thing about \"Firepower\" is that I think, when this album goes on to be 10 or 20 years old, people will have picked a small handful of tracks to lean on, and the rest will be individually forgotten, which is always a sad fate for a record to have. That doesn't change the fact that I'd put this album is better than most people thought it could have been or would have been. It can stand pound for pound with a lot of other Priest records. Even some that are from their 'classic' era. It's far from perfect, but it holds its own weight. If this is the last we'll hear of Judas Priest in terms of new material, it's a quality effort for them to end their sermon with.\n",
        "\nIt took Priest over half a decade after \"Nostradamus\" to come out with \"Redeemer of Souls.\" This is the first album to feature Ritchie Faulkner on guitar after KK Downing left. He's a great guitarist, and he really deserved a better first album than this. \"Redeemer of Souls\" is another one of those albums where it is a genuine struggle to find anything good about at all. I think what might be the best thing I can possibly say about it is that, at no point is it as unlistenable as the worst moments on an album like \"Point of Entry\" or \"Jugulator.\" That doesn't change the fact that there is pretty much nothing at all decent across this entire record.\n\nYou name it, and this album manages to make it suck. Production, guitar tone, song writing quality, riffs, drum beats, and the list goes on. It all sucks across the board. The production is horrible. The guitar tone is horribly thin and at times horrendously grainy. Notes often get lost in the shuffle because of the combination of the two. It makes the guitar playing on the record sound sloppy. Halford himself sounds aged and incredibly tired. His trademarks are all there, but he just never delivers the way he should. It ends up making you feel sad more than anything. He also sounds distant on most songs. As if he's singing from behind the band instead of in front of. It could have been done intentionally to try and hide the age in his voice, but it's noticeable either way. Finally, Scott Travis' drums are flat and quiet, too. It may not be as bad as it was on \"Jugulator,\" but listen to the power he had on \"Painkiller,\" and come back here and listen to his drum production and you'll quickly notice a massive difference.\n\nSo off the bat, the 'tools' Priest used to make this album are lackluster. But some solid songwriting should be able to at least salvage that, right? Well, it might have been able to if the songwriting across the record wasn't as bad as everything else I already mentioned. At its very BEST moments, \"Redeemer of Souls\" sounds like a half energy, half effort Judas Priest. At worst, the songs sound like a bad cover band that tried to make a record of their own in the style of Judas Priest. Not only that, but Priest ALSO fell into the exact same trap they did for \"Nostradamus\" and made this record FAR too long. People often talk about \"Nostradamus\" being a bloated album, but when all is said and done, \"Nostradamus\" only had between 14-15 full length tracks, depending on what you count as such. But take a look at \"Redeemer of Souls.\" It has 13 tracks, so if anything it is just VERY slightly less bloated than the highly criticized \"Nostradamus!\"\n\nI'll start with the more unique tracks on the album that I feel are worth the most positive attention. For me, \"Secrets of the Dead\" is the closest the record ever comes to being decent. The riffs are simple but still fun, and it has a dark, brooding energy. Halford is still doing his best to sell the nature of the song, but the fact that you can barely hear him kills it. The chorus itself is a fun doom metal-like chorus. It's a darker and somber chorus, but it's still somewhat catchy despite that. This could have been a solid track if it had a little bit more depth to it. The closer \"Beginning of the End\" is also an alright track. It's your basic ballad, and Priest has certainly done better ballads in their life than this one, but there are some decent melodies on the song that make it an okay listen. This song also needed a bit more to prevent it from being a very basic ballad that'll get lost in the shuffle, but you can do worse than \"Beginning of the End.\"\n\nOnce again, if you put a gun to my head and forced me to pick a top three from this record, \"Crossfire\" would be my third choice. I'm not the first to point this out, but the intro sounds eerily similar to Sabbath's \"I.\" Even some of the flourishes on it are done with the same timing as on \"I.\" Now, considering Halford stepped in for Dio during the \"Dehumanizer\" tour for a few shows, so he has sung \"I\" before, and the fact that this was the first new Priest album since Dio died, this song could very well be a tribute or an intentional reference. The grove to \"Crossfire\" is okay, as is the chorus, but that's pretty much it. \"Battle Cry\" is also something of a song that wasted its potential. The intro is very \"Sentinel\" like to me, and what follows kicks it into high gear. It's definitely the most energy Priest shows off on the entire record. However, it crumbles down when Halford gets to the chorus. He tries very hard to hit his high notes of old, and even at his current age, he has had some success, but here, you can actually HEAR him losing his breath on the chorus. The note lacks power by itself, but the fact that he can barely keep it together is even sadder. \"Battle Cry\" was close to being something decent if it had a bit more time in the oven to bake, but at the end, it just makes you want to go back to the older material.\n\nThere's just SO much bad to talk about when it comes to \"Redeemer of Souls,\" though. \"March of the Damned\" has verse melodies that sound like a pop song, and a chorus that sounds like the band was just as bored of it as their eventual audience would be. This is a clear 'single' song. It's as basic as a song can get, sounds commercial as hell, and has absolutely no energy nor inspiration. This song is the definition of 'going through the motions.' \"Cold Blooded\" is right there with it, though. Once again, Halford just couldn't even be bothered to care. His singing is as basic and effortless as you'll ever hear from him. For the verse riffs, the band tries this spacey guitar tone to try and make it feel different, but it's unnecessary and adds nothing. The melodies themselves are, again, sappy, and very, very poppy sounding. It's another attention seeking track to try and squeeze out some single potential, and it sucks hard from start to finish.\n\nThe intro for \"Down in Flames\" might start to get you a little excited, because the start is reminiscent of a better time, but once the main riff kicks in, all hopes will be dashed. The guitars are boring and horribly crunchy. Halford, for what seems like the hundredth time on a 13 track album, gives close to no effort. The chorus is another biker pandering mess to try and seem tough to an increasingly aging group. It's a sad and annoying song to listen to. The acoustic intro of \"Hell and Back\" make you think you're going to get another ballad, but after the song actually kicks in, you'll wish it WAS a mediocre ballad instead. Stock riffs shoot out which would suck even if the crunched guitar tone was better. The melodies are drunken blues nonsense. The song has a different feel, I'll give it to that, but different did not mean good in this case. This song seemed like they named it something tough to give the false illusion that it was more 'metal' than it really is. The song they present to you is nothing like what you'd envision when to hear a title like \"Hell and Back.\" It's a jumbled mess of a song regardless.\n\n\"Sword of Damocles\" has an interesting beat to it, and once again, is extremely bluesy. It has a few cool guitar flourishes here and there, but Halford is just dreadful on this track. Halford sounds like he's reading the lyrics off of a piece of paper on the fly as they recorded the song. During the first verse section, for example, it sounds like he tries to put emphasis on the word \"FOOLS,\" but it's barely any punchier than the rest of the words, so it feels like there was a cue on the paper for him to do so, and he caught it super late and barely got it out in time. It genuinely sounds like Halford recorded the vocals in one quick take. That's how bad the song is. \"Metalizer\" is trying really desperately to be another Priest metal anthem, too, and it falls flat. It has one of Halford's better high notes on the record, but even that is pretty flat. The melodies are decent, but the riffs are really lifeless on \"Metalizer.\" The end of the chorus is solid, but what it uses to get to the final word of the chorus feels really confused and disjointed. \"Metalizer\" sounds like it should be the hyper driving badass track of the album, but it sounds so out of gas. The song is like a sports car with a dying engine. It might be TRYING, but it's clearly just not able to succeed.\n\nThere's just no excuse for \"Redeemer of Souls.\" It just has bad choice after bad choice, and it almost feels like this album came out of some sort of commitment rather than an album made of passion. It almost makes me feel like they thought Faulkner deserved his name on a studio album and so they made this record just to help him say he was a true blue member of Judas Priest. Regardless of why, there's nothing to hear on this album. There's nothing of note and nothing of substance. There's not a single thing off this record that you'll be missing if you never listen to it in your life. I think only the most diehard of diehard Priest fans should pay money for this record. It's just lucky, though, that Priest didn't sink off into the sunset with this record. They had (at time of writing) at least ONE more decent album in them to salvage their good name.\n",
        "\nI consider this album #2 in my expanding journal of \"why double albums shouldn't exist.\"\n\nAfter a decent reunion album before this one, \"Nostradamus\" would end up being the final Priest album (at time of writing) to have KK Downing on it, so the happy reunion didn't last that long. \"Nostradamus\" is another album that is often criticized to hell and back. In all honesty, it's really not that bad of an album. It's just bloated and too long. There aren't many tracks on this concept album that are bad by itself. There are, however, a ton of only okay tracks that quickly start to become tiring and annoying when the album is as long as it is. \"Nostradamus\" is a concept first and an album second. And that should never be the case. The best concept albums are albums first, and a concept second. Even then, most concept albums are able to get it done on one record. This one felt the need to stretch it into two.\n\nIgnoring the intro/atmosphere tracks, the record is still 14-15 tracks long. The long and the short of it is, if this album was only a single album with the best tracks across it, or more fat trimmed off, it absolutely would have gone down as being as good if not better than \"Angel of Retribution.\" In fact, the better tracks on \"Nostradamus\" are definitely my favorite Priest tracks they've made post reunion! I'm not saying it would have been a Priest classic, but it certainly would have been a welcomed addition to their discography, and not the butt of jokes and groans that it is. The record across the board themes itself really well, and instrumentally has a lot going for it. The bottom line is, like every other double album to ever be released, this simply had no business being a double album, and the fact that it is is the one true reason it gets pulled down as far as it does.\n\nIf you really want to start out talking about the good of \"Nostradamus,\" you need look no further than the first two true tracks. They are without doubt where the album really shines. \"Prophecy\" both hits hard and flows really well. The core riff is biting and powerful. It also doubles as the chorus melody, and the two really come together well. Halford is really balancing the range of his voice incredibly well on the track. He's vocally telling the story of the song and puts a lot of weight where it's needed. The solo is also fantastic and still keeps the overall melody in mind as it blazes forward. It's not only a well done and catchy solo, but the fact that it keeps the 'theme' of the song makes it even more memorable. \"Revelations\" relies a lot more on the guitar work and atmosphere, but it still hits just as hard. The guitar and matching orchestrated sections really give a mystical feeling. Halford manages to impressively keep a verse melody together despite that melody being pretty much one word increments. He still manages to drive home that intentionally confused-sounding and atmospheric story telling with strength and grace. \"Revelations\" is really a song where everything clicks well. The band are all individually driving the song, but also the orchestration and 'extra' things around them are only meshing and flowing perfectly to make the song a real treat.\n\nThe title track on the second disc is the only other pure highlight I can point out on the album. It's still not as good as the first two tracks, but it definitely is memorable and holds its weight. Halford opens with a really operatic style of singing that we don't get too often and sounds great. He quickly goes into his traditional style and the riffs around him support him well. The title track of the album has a lot of variety and stylistic changes around it to make it very memorable. The band is firing from all cylinders on this track. Everyone is doing their part to make the song memorable, and it leads to a dramatic chorus that will stick with you. I also give a nod to \"Death\" because it has such a doomy and hammering feel to it. It has cold, atmospheric orchestration to it and the way it spaces out the softer and heavier moments make it a treat. The simple, but really sad sounding riff on the softer parts really drives the whole song. Halford's screaming build to the heavy part that follows is worth the price of admission itself. \"Death\" definitely isn't a song for everyone, and it could have been trimmed a touch, but due to the really downtrodden mood that Priest really delivers, I think it's a very unique and memorable song.\n\nThat's about it for the good on this double album, though. \"Persecution\" is another solid track, but that's truly where the compliments end. As I mentioned, though, there's really not much on the rest of the record that's BAD, but there's SO much more that's insanely boring and unnecessary. The second album in particular is where it crumbles apart. The title track is truly the only song on the entire second album that isn't a filler song. \"Alone\" is probably the worst, due to how absolutely nauseatingly repetitive it is. It still isn't the worst Priest track you'll find, but that one melody is shoved down your throat so many times that it's hard not to become sick of it. There's nothing noteworthy on this track at all, so you just have an overly long, overly repetitive snooze. \"Visions\" starts out like it's going to be promising, but it quickly falls on its face. It has a nice beat, and the riffs are okay, but Halford's melodies are completely off base. The vocal melodies are almost sappy across a darker riff and makes it feel disjointed. The chorus in particularly is a whiny mess. It's really a poppy and grating chorus that doesn't belong on this album at all. At best, \"Visions\" is dull. At worst, it's annoying and frustrating. Another absolute filler track.\n\n\"New Beginnings\" continues the wasted time train. The album already had a lackluster but okay ballad on the first disc in \"Lost Love,\" but they felt the need to add another in \"New Beginnings.\" \"Lost Love\" had a bit more beauty to it, even though it is far from the best Priest ballad, but here, \"New Beginnings\" really has nothing to hold itself up. Besides a decently okay chorus, it has no substance, and just turns into yet another paint by numbers ballad to pad out the record's bloated runtime. Moving back to the first record, \"War\" is our true wasted filler track there. Scott Travis has a cool beat, but the song doesn't have any depth or progression. It just kind of marches along. It occasionally tries to throw in an explosive chorus, but I feel the chorus is really flat. It doesn't have the impact or the power that I feel the band really thought it had. The middle swelling orchestral section is fantastic, but not nearly enough to save the song. \"War\" is really a song made to move the 'story' of this concept album. It's not a song that's made to be a song. It's a song done as a narrative, and it shows. It again, ends up nothing but a waste of space.\n\nAnything else not mentioned is pretty much the same. A filler track with varying degrees of boring between each. \"Nostradamus\" is genuinely such a shame on so many levels. Not only because it's the last Priest album with the core group (again, at least at time or writing), but because the potential to be a good record is clearly right there. The band let the pretentiousness of making a concept/double album mess with their songwriting, so \"Nostradamus\" is doomed to suffer. If you took the six good tracks, and maybe two or three of the more 'unique' tracks that weren't perfect and reworked them some, \"Nostradamus\" could have easily been considered a great album in the later Judas Priest catalog. I absolutely recommend Priest fans listen to \"Nostradamus,\" because there is really, really good material to cherry pick from. However, after you listen to it once and picked those songs for yourself, there sadly isn't much of a reason after that to ever come back to it as an entire album again.\n",
        "\nIs Point of Entry a bad album? For a long time it seemed that the response from the majority was yes, with many Judas Priest fans still not tolerating this album because of its heavy hard rock leanings and excessive commercialism to enter the US market. And although to this day there are still numerous fans who are not convinced by this album, its status has been changing little by little and more people have been appreciating and changing their perception of the album, I was one of those who for a long time ignored this album and on the rare occasion that I listened to it I did so with indifference, finding it to be an inferior piece in Judas Priest's vast catalogue.\n\nStill it is not an album that is completely ignored by the band itself, Heading Out to the Highway is a classic in the band's live performances, and I think this is because this is an album that was in what could be defined as \"Judas Priest's commercial and musical prime\" as it is the album after the classic British Steel and the album before the classic Screaming for Vengeance, so in a strange way the greatest virtue and at the same time the greatest disadvantage of this work was the time in which it was made.\n\nWhat do I mean by this? Well, one of the ways in which many works are perceived is depending on the moment in which they were made, or in other cases, what an artist did before and after, the best comparison I can think of is with Megadeth's album \"So Far So Good So What\", which is by no means a bad album but can be seen as a very weak one if you compare it with what came before \"Peaces Sells\" and with what came after \"Rust in Peace\". Point of Entry suffers from the same syndrome, as much as I like this album it is impossible to compare it with the titanic releases Judas Priest made during that era. But this is something vert easy to observe, what surprises me is that so many people can believe that in such a prolific era for the British band, as the 80-83 one, they could produce a bad album.\n\nIf there is something the band has proved during their long career is that they are capable of making solid music in different fields, from their beginnings with progressive tints, through different eras playing with speed, glam or groove metal, and even in their most recent era with the incorporation of traces of power metal. Why would it be any different when they tried to get into hard rock? In fact this tendency already existed in their music since \"Killing Machine\", if anything in this work they went deeper into this trend, perhaps too inspired by what they did in British Steel because there are several patterns that are repeated, as the rhythm before entering the chorus of \"All The Way\" which is very similar to the one in \"You dont have to be old. ..\", the intro of \"Troubleshooter\" is the same as \"Living After Midnight\" or the reggae-influenced beginning of \"Turning Circles\" is the same as \"The Rage\n\nAnd even with all these similarities the album has its own identity and is full of hits, songs like \"Solar Angels\" \"Deser Plain\" or the already mentioned \"Heading Out To The Highway\", which also gives us one of the best riffs in history to start an album, are masterpieces of hard rock arranged to the extreme in every detail and with a number of hooks in different segments of the songs that make them a must for any fan of the British band. The songs are so catchy that even stupid and simplistic songs like \"You Say Yes\" work thanks to a solid performance by all the members, of course they are a type of song that is not up to JP's great pieces, but I can't help but admire the Birmingham boys ability to turn almost any song into an accessible and incredibly memorable one, \"You Say Yes\" is probably the best example of this but it's not the only one of its kind, \"Hot Rockin' \" or \"On The Run\" show the best side of the heaviest and most iconic hard rock possible.\n\nIf only all that glitters was gold, and not even that desertic atmosphere, which invites you to take the car and immerse yourself in a journey without a destination with this album in the background, will prevent it from having its compendium of songs that, even for a less demanding standart like the one on this album, are quite weak. Songs like \"Turning Circles\", \"All The Way\" or the single \"Don't Go\" do the same as the rest of the songs but without that unparalleled display of genius that the band had at the time, they are the uninspired songs on the album and the ones that will frustrate anyone who is not really enjoying the record at first. Yes, \"Point of Entry\" is far from perfect, and some of the critics are justified, but every time I listen to it I can't help but think that it is also far from being the weak and passable album that many would have you believe. Judas Priest's seventh album is a solid must-have for any fan of the band and hard rock in general. JP does not disappoint, and even less so in that golden era.\n",
        "\nAfter two very unsuccessful albums with Tim Owens fronting Judas Priest, the legendary Rob Halford returned to make the band whole again. What was birthed first from this return was \"Angel of Retribution.\" This was always something of an odd album to me. There are only a few moments on this album that I really find to be unacceptable, but even the really good of this album just feels...hollow somehow. There are songs on this album that I really like a lot and appreciate, but when I listen to them, and then go and listen to older Priest, there's almost something indescribable lacking off the songs from \"Angel of Retribution.\" If I were pressed to try and describe it, I'd say that they lack the fire and the ring of passion that Priest had when they were younger and hungry.\n\nFor example, a lot of the songs have this air of cheese to them. Not that I personally mind it myself, and not that Priest never had any cheese, because we all know they had PLENTY, but some of these songs sound...cartoonish cheesy. Like it's a show, and not just natural cheese. Lets take \"Demonizer.\" It's a heavy and quick song with solid riffs all around. The time signature is in 3s, which is a bit different for Priest, and should make this song sound fresher than it does. Halford is still on top of his game, but something about the way the verse and chorus flow and groove feels a bit flat. \"Demonizer\" is still a very good song, and Halford continues to amaze with his screams at the end of the song, but I don't feel the same passion from it as I do from other songs. \"Hellrider\" is one of my favorites off the album, and it sounds like it could easily have fit on \"Painkiller.\" The intro solo is dynamite, and the whole song has this somber and foreboding aura to it that makes it stand out. It's dark and threatening, and Halford harmonizes his lower and higher registers really, really well. But once again, I find myself listening to \"Hellrider\" and really enjoying it, but then throwing on something from \"Painkiller,\" or \"Defenders of the Faith\" and being instantly more hooked on those songs rather than this. The more I listen to tracks off this album in a 'shuffle' setting with older material thrown in, the less I seem to like them. I only seem to find the highest of praises for this record when I listen to it isolated.\n\nThat's not to say I don't think any songs on the record hold their own, though. I think the best \"Angel of Retribution\" offers bookends the album. \"Judas Rising,\" being the first track is everything you could have wanted as the welcoming party in the band's reunion. A great intro solo, Halford's screams off the gate, a solid drum start, and one of the best riffs on the album. Halford's screams across the chorus help the rest of the song soar and stand on its own two feet. The track is the perfect length to hit hard and get out without tripping over itself. The closer, \"Lochness\" is just as much of a beast as the creature it's named after. It's worth every second of its run-time. It is a song that is dripping with atmosphere, but never oversteps its boundaries. It's a plodding, heavy track that takes its time from start to finish. The riffs are always very engaging, and Halford is painting musical pictures with every word he sings. Priest did what so many bands fail at by creating an 'epic' that continues to be thrilling and satisfying the entire way through. If you don't like slower or more atmospheric songs, you may not be able to get into \"Lochness\" but I think there's so much to absorb and enjoy about it.\n\nThe other note I can make in favor of \"Angel of Retribution\" is that it has some of the best ballads Priest has ever written. As a pure ballad, I think \"Angel\" is right up there with \"Before the Dawn.\" The melodies are truly beautiful, and Halford really makes you believe the story. The track is always building on itself and adding something as it goes on. It never gets stale. \"Angel\" never feels like it's just going through the motions. It's not a ballad for the sake of having a ballad. There's some love and care taken on the song, and it shows. I actually think the song suffers the most when it gets heavy at the end, but it doesn't take away too much of how good the earlier parts were. \"Eulogy\" is also almost something of an interlude. It serves as an intro track for \"Lochness,\" but...does an already 13 minute song really need an intro track...? It's very short, and sticks to one main melody, but the piano behind the guitars and the subtle ominous keyboard work make it tell its own kind of story. It's almost like Priest is paying tribute to themselves with mentions of \"Stained Class\" and \"The Sentinel.\" It both does a great job at setting the tone for \"Lochness,\" but I think the song could also stand on its own quite well with the dreary, yet beautiful atmosphere. It's very well done.\n\nUnfortunately, the bad on \"Angel of Retribution\" is really quite bad, It also happens to be two songs in a row. \"Revolution\" sounds like it might have promise with a pretty solid riff and a cool intro. Something about the riff harkens back to early Priest. But the song progresses, and it almost sounds like a show tune. It sounds like something a bad metal inspired play would come up with. The sudden slowed down part where the guitar is subdued and Halford adds a blown out speaker effect to his voice further enhances my show tune point. Halford is over the top with cheese in his voice, and the chorus chants of \"revolution\" are emotionless and flat. It's just a really unfitting track. The following track \"Worth Fighting For\" is definitely worse, though. Everything about THIS song sounds like any generic corporate rock band under the sun. Everything from the sound of the guitars to the melodies to the generic beat to the sappy chorus just reeks of corporate rock nonsense. It's definitely the song that is begging for radio airplay the most. It's a nauseating experience of cliche songwriting and a sell-out mood. Where \"Revolution\" was just out of place, \"Worth Fighting For\" is absolutely unbearable to listen to.\n\nRob Halford was welcomed back by both the band and the fans with open arms, but I think everyone can agree that there was just something missing about this comeback. You can SURELY do worse in their discography than this, and it's certainly a serviceable and enjoyable record when all is said and done, but it was very close to being more. Perhaps it's just an overall sad record to me, because I think it's clear that this was really the first sign that the Priest was starting to get old. Sure, the gang still had a lot of good to offer, and even go on to display a few new tricks here and there, but I think \"Angel of Retribution\" was a sign that it was going to take a real shot in the arm for the band to not start going downhill from here.\n",
        "\nAfter the utter disgrace that was \"Jugulator,\" the now Tim Owens fronted Judas Priest took almost half a decade off before returning with \"Demolition.\" This album seems to be the album that consistently gets hated the most from fans. And while I certainly wouldn't call \"Demolition\" a good album, it is GALAXIES better than \"Jugulator\" is. I even take it over \"Point of Entry,\" and might even take it over \"Turbo\" and a future album we haven't gotten to yet, too. Compared to \"Jugulator,\" the production is punchier and less thin and plastic. The guitarists also have a much more notable role on \"Demolition.\" They're not just filling needless space. There are some solid riffs and memorable guitar work on this album.\n\nTim Owens is also improved by a HUGE degree on this album. His cringe worthy half-baked effort at growls are mostly gone on this album. He still uses a low register quite a lot on this album, but he keeps it in a place that fits him well. Most of those equally unfitting 'atmospheric' intros and elements are gone, too. Unfortunately, what HASN'T improved on this album is the songwriting, and unfortunately, that's what matters most. Priest still couldn't abandon those 'tough guy' lyrics that plagued \"Jugulator.\" There are places on the album where they're couched a little bit better because there's more instrumentally to be interested in, but it still doesn't save anything. I'd also say the album is a bit too long, too. It's a thirteen track album, and most of the songs are a decent length. There's no doubt that fat could have been trimmed here.\n\nThe only real cringe-worthy track that comes close to being as bad as anything on \"Jugulator\" is \"Hell is Home.\" Despite an interesting acoustic intro, those horrible 'tough guy' lyrics are the worst on this track. There's nothing salvageable about this song. The riffs and melodies are boring, and the cringe factor will just make you want to skip right through this one. Another factor of this track that also comes into play in the opener \"Machine Man\" is that they CURSE a little bit on this album! And don't worry. Owens makes SURE you know that they do. When he throws in a 'shit' in \"Hell is Home\" and a 'mother fucker'' in \"Machine Man,\" he makes sure both are the most clear words he pronounces. He shouts them for emphasis, as if he's just going for the shock value that Judas Priest cursed. In general, \"Machine Man\" is a decent track with passable riffs and solid progression, though. I wouldn't call it a standout, but it's definitely a worth while track that doesn't take away from the record at all.\n\nBesides \"Hell is Home,\" \"In Between\" is really the only other track on the record that is an active struggle to listen to, although it isn't nearly as bad. This album, in general, has a few tracks that have some softer, melodic, near ballad elements. This one is the heaviest of the bunch, and while the other two just don't really go anywhere, \"In Between' is just a bad listen. Owens is once again really trying to sell that 'I'm a loner that is fighting the whole world' approach to sell the album to teenagers. That kind of pandering is nowhere more prominent than on this track. Even beyond that, it's a dully and skippable experience. I'm also rather torn on \"Metal Messiah.\" The verse melodies are almost a nu-metal rap, but suddenly for the chorus, it breaks into an almost power metal chorus where Owens is really soaring and showing the best parts of his voice. It's like they tried to mash classic Judas Priest with the flavor of the month in 2001, and it just doesn't work at all. It's like two different songs in one. I could definitely understand the appeal if someone enjoyed \"Metal Messiah,\" but it's just too disjointed and unfocused for me. It needs to pick a lane, not stay between two of them.\n\nBut where \"Jugulator\" had absolutely nothing remotely enjoyable about it, \"Demolition\" has some gems. Far and away, the best song to grace this album is \"Bloodsuckers.\" Not only is \"Bloodsuckers\" easily the best song Owens ever sang on, but the song could easily stand up there with some of the better Halford-led Priest tracks. The riff is fantastic, and really guides the song. The chorus is an absolute masterpiece, too. Owens hits the chorus with his gruffer register before following it with some of his highest notes. It creates an intensity and really fuels adrenaline. Later in the song, he builds on it, too. The gruffer parts start to get higher to match the following high notes and really keeps you hooked. The first time I listened to this album, I literally said \"Where did THIS come from?!\" when this song hit. It's THAT much better and different than almost anything else this era has to offer. I also have a soft spot for \"One on One.\" I think it has the best riff on the album, and it just moves so well. The riff, the beat, and Owens' melodies on the verses keep this song pounding and grooving the entire way through. It's so nice to hear a track that Downing and Tipton are the stars of. They show they've still got it in them on this song. While \"One on One\" isn't as incredible as \"Bloodsuckers,\" it's probably the only other Owens-era Priest track I listen to regularly.\n\nIf I had to pick a top three for Owens-era Priest, though, my third pick would be \"Feed on Me.\" It's not even close to the aforementioned other two, but it's another track that Tipton and Downing are really, really strong on. Owens primarily is using a higher register here, which makes the song feel pretty unique compared to the others. The chorus is equally unique. The chorus riff is electric and punchy. Owens gives it room to breathe while making his point and driving it home. It's a very strong track. \"Jekyll and Hyde\" is another pretty different song then the norm for this era. There's some light keyboard work across it that gives it a bit of levity and air. I don't think the guitar work is all that special here, but the song is different and has a pretty decent chorus. It has progression for its short length. It's enjoyable enough and doesn't overstay its welcome, so it's a welcome addition for sure.\n\nThe rest of the album really is just filler, though, unfortunately. About half of this record are boring or unsatisfying songs that are just there to pad the runtime. While, again, it's really nice to see that the average track off \"Demolition\" isn't nearly as bad as the average on \"Jugulator,\" it still drags the record down in general. \"Devil Digger,\" for example, has an okay chorus and some decent riffs, but it's just too slow and drags on too long. There's a lot of potential on the track, but it just needed a shot in the arm. It needed to get going somewhere to improve it. \"Subterfuge\" is very similar. It combines a little of classic Judas Priest riffing with some of the crunchier distorted guitar parts that make up most of this record. It's an interesting beast of a song because of how it flows and how the riffs and guitar parts play out, but it's still missing something. The chorus doesn't detract at all, and hits pretty hard, but also isn't good enough to help lift the tune up to the next level. Once again, just a little something more could have really elevated this song into something special.\n\nAnd with the conclusion of \"Demolition,\" the band would take another near half decade break before reuniting with Rob Halford to start the twilight part of their careers. Honestly, I wish the band would have made a side project with Owens for at least one more album. I think \"Demolition\" was such a huge improvement over \"Jugulator\" that I would have loved to see where one more album would have taken them. If they were able to improve so much from just one album, I think there was a chance they could have made something truly worth-while with one more effort. In any case, Owens has had a fine career fitting in with various bands as time went on, and Priest still had a lot to give with Halford back, too. As for \"Demolition,\" it's better than the hate it gets makes it seem, even if it's not the most stellar album. For me, \"Jugulator\" is the one that deserves the hate \"Demolition\" unfairly gets.\n",
        "\nAfter Halford decided to leave Judas Priest, the band had a half decade break before coming back with Tim Owens on vocals to release \"Jugulator.\" Let me first say that Owens is a good vocalist, but he's out of his league trying to follow Rob Halford. Almost no one would be able to fill the shoes he left, but Owens doesn't really have the best 'feel' for Priest. At least Priest as we'd all know it. Owens is a good vocalist at his best, and a horrible vocalist at his worst. Unfortunately, there's more of his worst than his best. Both albums with Owens on vocals try hard to fit in, and his voice does the same. It's hard to say how much of that influence is Owens himself, and how much of it was the band directing him on where they wanted to be.\n\nThe bottom line is that \"Jugulator\" is a terrible album. To me, the Tim Owens albums are the exact opposite side of the same coin as \"Point of Entry\" and \"Turbo.\" Where the later two tried incredibly hard to be poppy and cheesy to get mass appeal, all \"Jugulator\" and its successor do instead is try and hit this pompous and cringe worthy \"tough guy\" attitude to try and reach a broader appeal instead. Instead of satisfying their fans, Judas Priest tried to do this to try and be 'hip' with what they thought was cool at the time. They tried desperately to reach a 'new generation' of fans instead of pleasing the fans they'd already made for two decades before this. What they didn't get is that it wasn't cool then, and it hasn't become cool with age, either. \"Juglator\" is the musical personification of the dad that tries too hard to relate to and fit in with his kids. Instead of just doing what they do best with a new singer, they really shot themselves in the foot.\n\nThis time around, everything feels thin, too. KK and Tipton's guitars come off as lower and less focused than previous albums, and where, on \"Painkiller\" Scott Travis had this blasting heavy drum sound, this time it also feels paper thin and incredibly fake. His drums almost feel plastic sounding to me. While Owens has his own brand of impressive high notes, he also feels the need to throw in these distorted growls like a half-assed death metal singer in most songs. I just cannot express hard enough how cringe worthy this album is. There are few albums that make me want to curl into the fetal position out of second hand embarrassment more than \"Jugulator\" does.\n\n\"Burn in Hell.\" Really? If that doesn't tell you how much this album panders, I don't know what will. Sure. An extreme metal group that has instrumentals to fit that kind of mood might be able to make it work without making you cringe, but this lineup of Judas Priest? They had absolutely no chance at all. The riff and bass work on \"Burn in Hell\" is some of the albums best, but Ripper's pathetic tough guy melodies are horrid. It sounds like a kid who learned his first curse word just saying it all the time to try and sound cool. Just mention guns and shooting someone and you'll fit in with all the cool kids, right? The whiny chant of the chorus after the high note completely misses the mark and offers no atmosphere like it intended either. Absolutely dreadful. \"Dead Meat\" follows suit. With a boring dime-a-dozen riff, all Ripper does here is talk about cutting and stabbing instead of shooting to try and sink his point across here. Once again, the vocals are cringe inducing for the entire run time. Just change one tough guy topic and insert another and you have \"Dead Meat.\" There's not one note or second of this song worth listened to.\n\nIf that wasn't bad ENOUGH, the band also has to throw in tracks where they have obnoxious introductions to try and sell this same tough guy mood. Let us next look at \"Death Row.\" I might have never heard anything more cringe inducing in my entire life than the intro for \"Death Row.\" It's truly that horrible. It's supposed to make you feel like an inmate in death row, but they're so bad at making the mood right that instead it feels like going through a haunted house some guy put on in his backyard. It's cheap and it's pale. The chorus is also pathetically vomit worthy. Once again, a band who knows how to use atmosphere and effects could have easily pulled this off. It's not that the band decided to be atmospheric that caused the problem. It's the fact that they tried it without the tools in their arsenal to make it feel believable and real. \"Brain Dead\" follows right behind. They had to start their song with a car skidding across the road and sirens. Why? Because running from the law is \"cool,\" right? They did \"Breaking the Law\" and everyone loved it, so lets just double down on that and we'll sell millions with the kids, right? Again, it has no substance. No worthwhile riffs and nothing decent vocally either. Just more of Owen's usual stuff and his annoying growls.\n\nThe worst the album has to offer is \"Blood Stained.\" And considering how bad the rest of the album is, being the worst is really something of an accomplishment. I genuinely struggle to listen to this song. It's the combination of everything that sucks about this lineup. The chorus is a repetitive onslaught of the same tough guy talk AND Tim Owens has to do his growl across every word too! \"Blood Stained\" is an utter assault on the ears from every direction. It's easily in contention for the worst Judas Priest song of all time. And last, because I'm sounding like a broken record, \"Decapitated\" keeps the trend going. It's probably the least offensive of everything I've talked about up to this point, but like \"Blood Stained,\" we once again have the same story. Tim Owens ranting about some kind of tough guy violent act while he throws in sickening growls behind it to try and sell the mood. Being repetitive is bad enough, but they felt the need to be repetitive with some of their worst songs, too. Oh, they needed a comedy spoken word part mid way into the song, too.\n\nNow...you might be asking me...is there ANYTHING decent off \"Jugulator.\" No. The short answer is no. But if you're really going to twist my arm, I can maybe give the title track a pass. If every song on the record was like the title track, it would have merely ended up as a mediocre album, instead of one of the worst of the worst. \"Jugulator\" at least attempts to be Judas Priest. It still falls victim to some of the same things I'd already mentioned, but I can easily chalk that up to a different style with a different singer. Even if it's not for me, there's an ATTEMPT on the title track. There's effort here. The riffs are solid; the chorus is a lot of fun; and there are transitions and movement to the song. It's mediocre, but it's a shining gem compared to the rest. The chorus of \"Bullet Train\" is a lot of fun too. The chorus is easily the best chorus on the entire album, for what that's worth. The rest of the song is pretty bad, but having a memorable chorus with some emotion is a positive. I wouldn't recommend \"Bullet Train,\" but I definitely have to give it points for having a chorus that sticks with me some.\n\nSo yes. \"Jugulator\" is horrible. Quite possibly the worst Judas Priest gets. You might have also noticed I didn't talk all that much about the band itself during this review. Why? Because they're just there. Besides a few cool moments, it's just stock metal riffs crammed down your throat. They're almost a non-factor. The successor to this record often gets more hate, but I actually prefer it, if ever so slightly, to this one. But that's a story for another time. The bottom line is, this album isn't bad because it doesn't have Halford. As someone who likes quite a few bands more without their most 'famous' singer (see my Black Sabbath reviews), I'm very open to a new voice. It was just the stylistic changes that came with Owens, whether they were his influence or not, made this record dead on arrival. See what I did there? I can use tough guy words to try and make a point too, guys. The only difference is, when my tough guy words falls flat, I'm just a nobody on the Internet. Not Judas Priest.\n",
        "\nPriest's \"Painkiller\" is another essential and classic album in the history of metal as a genre. It's tough to write a review on \"Painkiller\" because there isn't much new I can say about it. All of the accolades this album gets are justified, and there's only so much more I can add to that. After \"Ram It Down,\" Priest decided to cut the nonsense and release their heaviest album of all time. Now, just because it's heavier doesn't mean it's better by default, but the songwriting across the album fits perfectly this slight stylistic change they went for here. There's no more pop or cheesy crowd service songs anymore. This is just pure Priest at the very top of their game.\n\nA lot of help with the heavier style comes from new drummer Scott Travis, who has become their permanent drummer. At least up until time of writing. While I personally think that both Simon Phillips and Les Binks at his peak were 'tastier' and more satisfying drummers than Scott Travis is, it is undeniable that he is the drummer for the job on this release. His heaviness and pure power helped define this album. He also had much more longevity to show that his solid performances weren't just a one time fluke, which could easily be argued when it comes to Phillips and Binks. Just look at the title track for proof. His drum intro on that song is one of the most iconic and most emulated and covered intros of all time. To top off the title track, Halford is hitting what is probably his most consistent streak of high notes of his career. Every musician in the band has the performance of their lives on this song. From Halford's piercing screams to the soaring guitars to the pounding drums, \"Painkiller\" is a track that just has it all going for it. I honestly feel bad every time Robbie has to perform the song live, because it's very clear that doing this song takes a toll on him every night he does it.\n\nThe following track \"Hell Patrol\" doesn't let up at all. It's definitely my favorite on the record, and one of the general most underrated Priest tracks. The whole song has this relentless marching feel with a great riff complimented by a fantastic drum beat behind it. Halford's vocal melodies are still impressive technically, but also have this beautiful sadness to them. He sounds like a civilian watching this unstoppable army march through his town. The solo is also one of the very best Judas Priest ever offers. \"Hell Patrol\" is short and to the point, and there isn't one second of wasted runtime on the whole song. \"Between the Hammer and the Anvil\" features some of Priest's best riff work in my opinion. The opening riff is dark and sinister, but it quickly transitions into a grooving and smooth riff that is extremely catchy and memorable. Once again, it's really Halford's vocal melodies that are just icing on the cake. His vocal story telling is at peak performance. Scott Travis continues his impressive debut with some very fitting china cymbal grooves when the intro riff returns. Much like classic Priest, at the end of the song, Halford turns an okay, but unremarkable chorus into one for the ages as he instantly improves it by turning it around with his desperate sounding and soaring high notes.\n\nThe thing that makes \"Painkiller\" such a good album is that it's not just one kind of track that it nails. It's not like only the fast tracks are good, and when they slow it down some, the quality drops. \"Night Crawler\" starts with a short but atmospheric intro that sets the table before digging into a mid-tempo stomper. Again, \"Night Crawler\" is ALL about the story telling Halford delivers with his melodies. Just by those melodies, even without lyrics, you instantly can put yourself into the mood on a rainy night of a town being stalked by this creature. After another classic solo, the song slows down again and goes for a fantastically eerie clean section for Halford to continue the story. This is a song to point to to show a vocalist how it's done. It demonstrates just how well you can use your voice to tell a story regardless of what the words are. \"A Touch of Evil\" is another absolute CLASSIC on the record. It's the true slower paced song on the release. It features a little bit of keyboards that enhance every single second it appears for. It fills a lot of gaps nicely. Scott Travis' heavy playing really make this song. He lays down a simple but immensely pounding beat for everyone to groove to. The verse melodies are there simply to slowly build up to an explosive chorus. It's a rather simple formula, but it's done so expertly on \"A Touch of Evil\" that it's easy to look past that. The riffs give a great amount of breathing room for Halford. Both Halford himself and both guitarists consistently give each other the perfect amount of space for each of them to work and be memorable.\n\nUnfortunately, \"Painkiller\" isn't without some slight missteps, though. I find the closer \"One Shot at Glory\" to be incredibly lackluster. The riff is actually a really sinister and strong one, but Halford is very unfitting. His melodies on this song sound like something that'd be on \"Screaming for Vengeance.\" His melodies are more uplifting and totally off the mark for such a darker riff. Not only that, but the chorus is abysmal. It really falters and isn't remotely satisfying. It sounds very confused, and it's almost like Halford put a more classic 70's Priest chorus into this darker \"Painkiller\" sounding song that makes it amazingly disjointed. I also find \"Leather Rebel\" to be a bit of a sleeper, although it's not nearly as lackluster as \"One Shot at Glory.\" It's one of the quicker songs on the entire album, and even has a slight power metal feel. It's also a short track, so it doesn't hurt to listen to all that much, but where, for example, \"Hell Patrol\" is around the same length and builds on itself and has progress, \"Leather Rebel\" doesn't really go anywhere. Where it starts is where it finishes, and it doesn't really move anywhere in between. The chorus is also pretty unremarkable again, but isn't horrible. You can do worse than \"Leather Rebel,\" but when comparing it to the rest of the heavy hitters across the album, it's a step down.\n\nThe saddest thing about \"Painkiller\" is that it once again falls into the pit of one-off Priest albums. They still couldn't make two great ones in a row. After \"Painkiller,\" Halford decided he needed a break from the band, and we'd get a whole new singer and a whole new style to come with it next. I often fantasize about what a proper sequel to \"Painkiller\" uninterrupted would have been like, but it was not to be. When all is said and done, \"Painkiller\" is a classic for good reason. I personally don't think it can touch \"Defenders of the Faith,\" but it's a very close fight between this and \"Stained Class\" for my number two spot in their discography. If you haven't listened to \"Painkiller,\" you owe it to yourself to do so right away. There's good reason it is as revered as it is.\n",
        "\nBefore properly reviewing this album, one mostly condemned by metal fans in general, I confess that Judas Priest are my favorite metal band and also being a bit blinded by nostalgia. Some feel this might disqualify me from objectivity but I will review Turbo as I do every album, on its own objective merits, reputation be damned. So of my subjectivity towards this universally panned release. After Turbo dropped in 1986 I got the chance to see the supporting Fuel For Life tour twice in a two week period. The first of these two gigs remains my favorite metal concert ever, beyond just getting to meet my favorite band, they gave an excellent performance; where the songs from Turbo absolutely slayed and every single Priest fan warmly embraced the electrifying set, especially the newer songs. My only complaint about these two shows was that in both instances they failed to play my favorite song from Turbo but more on that further below.\n\nSo my personal experience aside, what of the actual much derided album? Well, unfortunately, the biggest criticism to be found is that oft repeated, but erroneous, claim of, \u201cThis does not sound like Judas Priest,\u201d has to be heard. That sentiment should be enough to make ones eyes roll straight from their sockets at such an absurd expectation. Judas Priest do not have a signature sound, so having a skewed expectation going into a new Judas Priest album is just setting yourself up for failure. Despite this the hate still permeates but is it truly deserved? For anyone who grew up in the 1980s, the answer would be a resounding declaration that modern critiques are embarrassingly out of touch. Now even though there are a myriad of criticisms spread across every review ever given on Turbo, they all boil down to three in particular and I will review the album by analyzing these three one at a time:\n\n1. Outdated Production. This point is first since it is one with the most merit. There is no getting around that Turbo indeed sounds like it was recorded in 1986 and there are moments that sound like Whitesnake, Cinderella, Grim Reaper and the rest of the fledgling glam metal scene. If people can get behind the horrendous production of a significant portion of metal, or even some of Priest's own early albums, they should accept what is actually an incredible production that, at worse, removes some tenacity. The album is still expertly produced by Tom Allom, you know the guy, the one responsible for working the knobs while Black Sabbath crafted the genre into existence with their first three landmark releases, among many other classic genre defining efforts. It is safe to say that Tom Allom, just for his work in Sabbath and Priest, is as responsible for the aesthetic and style of metal as any of the pioneering bands themselves. All seven Priest albums he has produced have top notch production, the clean sonic texturing that provides every instrument a clear space to breathe; while some of the heaviness is lost in the approach they all agreed to on Turbo, it would not have made sense to rely on an oppressive wall of heavy sound here. Because\u2026\n\n2. Simplistic Lyrics. There is validity to this claim, but it is just a shallow observation. Due to Rocka Rolla having a couple and at least one song on every album since Sin After Sin, this makes Sad Wings Of Destiny the ONLY album in the bands history to be entirely serious in concept, tone and lyrical content. See ultra silly and vacuous lyrics are as much a part of Priest as is their DELIBERATE inconsistency. Moreover, this album actually is different from the standard Priest fare since it has none of the comic book narratives (Starbreaker, Hellrider, Sentinel) or sci-fi adventures (White Heat, Red Hot, Blood Red Skies, Electric Eye) yet is not always serious and gritty, \u00e0 la Sad Wings, either. There is no argument from me that these lyrics are rather puerile by even Priest\u2019s standards, but Priest has never exactly been Shakespearean, and since the proper head space here is energy and infectious grooves, lyrical banality is almost par for course.\n\nWhile others just want to be dismissive, Turbo should be seen for what it truly sought out to be; the most fun and carefree album of the bands extensive catalogue. Halford had reached quite an imaginative prowess at visual storytelling on the masterful Defenders Of the Faith, which is sorely lacking here but as with the above point, that approach would oppose the creative intent. Like most glam/hair metal the subject matter here spends most of its time on Jovial Highway instead of Self-Pity Boulevard, so while basic and sometimes vacuous, they never overstay and detract from the musical compositions. And speaking of the music on Turbo...\n\n3. It\u2019s Glam Metal! Well okay \u2026 and? Something is not bad just because it is glam metal because, well... glam is not a bad sub-genre and even its strongest detractors usually give the musicians their fair share of praise for the graceful fluidity of their playing. More specifically it seems Priest received hate not because they did glam metal music badly but because they did glam metal \u2026 period. As if venturing into this territory was somehow completely blindsiding for Priest fans in 1986, when record and concert ticket sales objectively - and I anecdotally - can attest that none of the Priest fans at the shows had an issue with the bands creative turn and this is, once again, because it fits perfectly in that mid 1980s everything is fun and carefree mental state. Heavy Metal Parking Lot anyone?\n\nFor all the valid criticisms this album gets, no one can claim the band phoned it in and did everything without sincerity. There is only one ballad (Out In the Cold) which most critics call one of the highlights anyway, but the other eight songs move with tremendous tempos, most of the time in speed metal territory, enough to warrant Turbo as legit contender for title of Priest\u2019s most consistently fast and energetic album prior to Painkiller. There is absolutely nothing simplistic about most of the riffs in the compositions here, they are as multi-layered as those found on the two previous celebrated records. Moreover, the solos are as sharp slabs of blistering steel as any during the decade. Judas Priest really should have released a full instrumental version of Turbo as it would find a whole new level of respect. Not only did these songs all slap incredibly hard during the subsequent tour but Turbo Lover is still in the set list 36 years on and its bludgeoning rhythm sections thunders as heavy as any on other celebrated releases; an absolute highlight of the bands live performances. Showing that besides the dated production and nonsensical nature, the music on Turbo is one of the most expressive and expansive collections of songs Priest has ever written.\n\nEven songs usually derided like the cheesy and corny Parental Guidance are still richly complex in compositional arrangement, even if it seems like an attempt to be Twisted Sister. While this is the song critics dislike most, its backstory and intent is more appealing than the track itself. It was written in response to their inclusion on the 'Filthy 15' list by the ultimate buzzkill that is the moral(?) majority and despite its scathing rebuke towards that PMRC, it became the biggest hit single from the album and still has its defenders three decades later. Meanwhile the PMRC met a hilarious end shortly after taking on the rock world. This song might seem goofy and corny but the band gets away with it because it is authentic. That which is asserted without merit shall be dismissed without merit. There was no need for the band to write a ten minute epic bore about the injustice of being labeled as filthy and all that crap, they wrote a corny rebellion song because that is all that equaled the threat. Besides, rebellion is a universal topic that has, from its inception, beaten at the very heart of Rock & Roll, which is what all of this is. It also benefited most from the raw live setting, listen to the version found on Priest Live to hear how powerful it became when that dated production was stripped away. \n\n\nSo with those criticisms addressed, a few other factors need mentioning. Turbo, unlike the previous two classics, does not end on miserable duds. In fact the album only gets stronger as it continues - a correlation for all of Priest\u2019s greatest albums - and to demonstrate this, three particular songs stand need special mentioning, one in the middle and the amazing one-two punch that concludes it:\n\nTurbo cannot be that bad since Priest, more specifically Glenn Tipton, ripped themselves, more specifically himself, off on the almighty Painkiller title track. One listen to Rock You All Around the World, a speed metal anthem with some of his most electrifying guitar shredding; the exact phrasing, along with note sequence for the majority of it, is reused in the exact same cadence and placement of his legendary solo in Painkiller. Listen to the solos back to back and if you do not hear the exact sequence again, note for note, then you are just choosing to ignore it. Must not be that embarrassing if he used it again in a genre defining song four years later.\n\nHot For Love is a complete reworking of the bands early song Starbreaker. Not only does it borrow the same template, down to the fixed tempo, they only change the drums to a synthesized guitar drone at the very beginning and nothing else. Akin to that Sin After Sin era, this track features some of the most tasteful bass licks Hill performed during the entire decade. The solo section is classic Glenn phrasing before segueing into harmonic interludes with K.K. dueling blissfully in a lower octave. This was not Judas Priest sacrificing who they were by trying to be something they are not, this is the same classic Priest songwriting just covered with a sheen of AOR production, along with some glam sensibilities. Hot For Love is one of only two songs out of the nine offered up to feature the patented dueling of Glenn & K.K., the other being the breakneck Locked In. The other seven songs see only one of them perform the lead work and while this is drastically different than how Tipton and Downing operate, the lead work is still captivating. All of Glenn's tasteful shredding is his finest outing this side of Painkiller, and this is exhibited most on the albums true highlight, the criminally underrated and thunderous Reckless.\n\nDue to Wild Nights, Hot & Crazy Days - this AC/DC knock off the only real dull moment on Turbo - being played at a few shows early on, Reckless remains the only song from Turbo to never be performed live. Beyond this most bizarre fact, there are also two special notes; it was the first Priest composition ever conceived in a tuning lower than standard, pointing to their future, but was originally considered as not just part of the OST but the official theme song for the 1986 blockbuster film Top Gun. The reason Glenn Tipton gives for this colossal failure is they would have needed to remove Reckless from the album since Warner Bros. wanted it exclusive to the OST, which Priest declined but offered four other tracks for consideration, however each were rejected. Rather one finds that a smart move or not it does prove that of the 85 original songs the band had penned by 1985, the one to define 1980s metal, it would be the enthralling and trailblazing Reckless; with its dazzlingly confident speed metal composition, efficient face melting solos and awe-inspiring performance by Halford. It provides an almost whimsical feeling of flying an F-14 Tomcat and an aura of invincibility. My second favorite song Judas Priest has ever penned.\n\nWhile no singular band has ever been responsible for sole creation of \u2026 anything, very few bands can lay claim to creating 1980s metal like Judas Priest can. After the creative zenith maxed out with the \u201cS\u201d trilogy, where they pushed the boundaries of what metal should look and sound like forever, the band began a pattern of studio output that both never deviated from the blueprint Killing Machine yet always subverted fans expectations. So if you follow that trajectory, this album is constructed very similar to the last five. Conceptually and sequentially Turbo is near identical to both Screaming For Vengeance and Painkiller. Whereas Painkiller was Priest nesting in the ever growing thrash metal scene of 1990, Turbo was Priest nesting in the burgeoning glam metal scene of 1986, where a union formed with the arena rock spectacle and heavy metal songwriting. I realize that description plants the band as running with the pack instead of leading it, but that should not be something that carries shame or detraction.\n\nEvery single one of today\u2019s revolutionary concepts will tomorrow be yesterday\u2019s mundane news, not every pioneering detail needs to stay ahead of their inspired contemporaries at all times. Besides, if falling in step is seen as a negative, the band would reinvent themselves at least five more times(Painkiller, Jugulator, Demolition, Nostradamus, Redeemer Of Souls) since this record. So this was not a career killer, it was a career footnote. A brief but still solid outing in a slightly different arena to both bolster their stock and prevent their lengthy catalogue from entering monotony. Beyond my just reviewing the album, hopefully others will understand how foolish it is to say Turbo does not sound like Judas Priest. Do not let the glossy window dressing color the fact that every single detail that had been part of the bands repertoire for the previous nine albums is on full display here. Being different at least prevents the band from the worst sin any artist could commit: being boring.\n\nOne further point to prove how vacuous the take is of Priest not trying on this release and that is the sheer volume of their creative zenith, writing 20 total songs and had planned to release the album in a wildly different manner. It was supposed to be a double album entitled Twin Turbos, which would still begin with Turbo Lover, a very natural scene opener, and gradually progress over two disks with the material becoming increasingly heavier and faster. It would begin in that much subdued state before concluding with Hard As Iron. Yes, the song from the next album Ram It Down. But what is it doing here? Well...\n\nOf the twenty written songs, nine of them make up this Turbo album while four of the ten songs that appear on Ram It Down were planned for Twin Turbos. Of the remaining seven songs, three of them were released as bonus tracks, one of which on the remaster of this very album, and three of them have never been released to the public. It shows Priest were peaking at the perfect time and was All Fired Up for this being their tenth studio release. They wanted to do something grand but newly minted management - the same that has been misguiding Priest since this very album - strapped the idea and forced the band to continue on the tried and true trajectory of the previous five albums. Notice how the next three studio albums all follow this same format as well? A trend not broken until 2001\u2019s Demolition.\n\nSo while a great number of people will always hate on this record, it will continue to be one of my favorites. Not just as an avid fan girl who witnessed it but as far as how Judas Priest wanted to be remembered; it's the real reason they can headline concerts a full half century after starting. They never cared about consistency, instead making the brand Judas Priest be synonymous with eclecticism. No metal band, from any traditional or extreme subgenre, has a catalogue as richly diverse and purposefully inconsistent as Judas Priest does. That HAS TO mean something. There is a Judas Priest song/album for almost any mood or situation one can be in, no one reaches that by channeling their inner Iron Maiden, and the mood this brings is an optimistically bright and carefree fun. If you want any other mood or style then listen elsewhere but listen to this if you want something that is less gritty, less somber and more sunshine and beach parties. Is it coincidence this album was written and recorded in the Bahamas? If Turbo can be summed up in just one word, it would be FUN!\n\nHighlights: RECKLESS! Hot For Love, Out In the Cold.\nWorst song? Wild Nights! Hot & Crazy Days.\n",
        "\nJudas Priest, what a band. My first time being exposed to them was with British Steel, then Painkiller, then Screaming for Vengeance, so on and so forth. I was told to avoid the Tim \"Ripper\" Owens era of Judas Priest, and after listening to Demolition, I pretty much agreed with people that his era was dated and pretty awful. But then I listened to Jugulator.\n\nEssentially, so to speak, this album is Painkiller on steroids. It's an unrelenting force of nature that grips you tight from the start, rips your spine out, and leaves your remains to get consumed by the Jugulator by the end. There's so much to look at with this record, so lets look at it from the start to the end.\n\nJugulator kicks off with the title track, with a strange, mechanical sounding intro, with spoken word about how the Jugulator is going to get you, and then it heads straight into that thrashing riff. This album radiates the same type of energy Painkiller had and then some. Blood Stained follows this track, and that song is pure madness. It's heavy, has a catchy chorus, and fairly catchy riffs. Another noteworthy track is Death Row, a fast thrash song with balls. It has a slow intro, but when it finally starts, it has literally every ounce of awesomeness that the first three tracks held. Also, that chorus is catchy and fun. I have to comment on this real quick by the way: Burn in Hell has got to be one of Judas Priest's best tracks. I'm not kidding. I'm not joking. It's absolutely brilliant. That awesome, slow intro that sends chills down your spine puts you on the edge of your seat. \n\nNot many people are fans of the track Brain Dead, and I really can't see why. Sure, Tim would've added a little bit more of an oomph on his voice during the verses, but his fantastic vocals on the catchy chorus save that. The speedy section in the middle is very reminiscent of Painkiller as well. Bullet Train is this album's main single (though, Burn in Hell was the best of the two singles), and it has a catchy chorus, fast riffs, and shows off Tim's vocals pretty well. Nothing super spectacular, but it is a good showcase of the album's tone and energy as a whole. \n\nThe one track on this record that I sincerely can't get is Decapitate. It's fine, but holy hell does it sound like a neutered version of Blood Stained and Dead Meat. Doesn't even have a catchy or memorable chorus to help save the track. Though, gotta say, that weird whip sound does catch your attention and saves you from boredom. The lyrics on this album are a little cheesy, but so was the entirety of Painkiller (\"This is the metal meltdown, run for your lives\"...does that not sound cheesy to you?). \n\nNow, the greatest track on this album is Cathedral Spires, a 9 minute epic about the end of the world. This track is amazing. I'm not joking, I'm not fooling around, this song is perfect, and should be on every \"top 10 best Judas Priest songs\" list. It's superb in every way, and an amazing way to conclude the album, and a decade. \n\nJugulator is an overlooked, underrated masterpiece of metal. Tim does a damn good job at filling in Rob Halford's place, the musicianship is great, and the production is superb. I'd go as far as to say that this album alone is the best thrash record of the mid to late 90s. The only other options in that are some of Slayer's lazy output after Seasons in the Abyss, Megadeth's generic Metallica ripoff albums after Rust in Peace, among other bands. Though, 2nd place in that list would be Annihilator's Criteria for a Black Widow, but that's a talk for another day.\n\nI give Jugulator a 99%, and 9 out of 10 stars.\n\nTracks to check out: \"Burn in Hell\", \"Cathedral Spires\", \"Bullet Train\", \"Jugulator\", and \"Death Row\".\n",
        "\nJudas Priest's \"Ram It Down\" is such an interesting beast in so many ways. It's really a fascinating record, even if it's not exactly the greatest. It's a rare case of an album between other albums that are entirely different and is also a near perfect blend of both of them. \"Ram It Down\" just could not let go of the overly cheesy, near cringe-worthy song writing that \"Turbo\" had, but...there are also instances of what would be coming next all over this record too. As a result, the album is an entirely mish mashed blitz of songs that volley you from one feeling to another with little to no forewarning. This would also be the final Judas Priest album to credit drummer Dave Holland, although KK Downing has stated that this album was mostly recorded with a drum machine, which makes it hard to precisely pick out what exactly he's playing on and what he isn't. As a drummer myself, there are definitely songs on the record that I'd be willing to bet were done with a drum machine, but it's not like Holland was a remarkable drummer to any degree, which makes it harder to tell.\n\nOne of the major problems I have with this album is that the guitar tone is very thin. It's buried pretty far back behind the programmed drums and Halford. Even when there's a lot of cool things going on, a lot of it you really need to focus on to notice. It is also well known that \"Ram It Down\" contains a lot of songs made while writing \"Turbo.\" A lot of the 'heavier' songs they made for the record were moved here instead. However, if you didn't know that, you'd have sworn that a song like \"Love Zone\" was a \"Turbo\" outtake. The song is...nauseatingly catchy. I do not, to any degree, enjoy \"Love Zone,\" but I'd be lying through my teeth if I told you that the chorus and some of the guitar hooks didn't instantly get caught in my head for days after hearing it just once. It's that kind of song. Halford has a great performance across the track. \"Love Zone\" really doesn't have much substance behind it, and despite great vocals, a super catchy chorus, and nice guitar work, I find myself sick of it all to soon. There aren't many songs like \"Love Zone\" that I can say I dislike, but I also find undeniably catchy.\n\n\"Love You to Death\" is another \"Turbo\"-like song that actually came from the Turbo sessions this time. The riff on this song is actually quite sinister. Halford, as always, is a perfect mood fitter. His sly yet threatening vocals fit the riff really well. However, this song also has no substance. It's extremely rinse and repeat. So while \"Love You to Death\" probably isn't going to be a painful listen, there's just not enough going on with it to keep you coming back to it. It's a serious waste of potential to a song. \"Come and Get It\" is the real snooze-fest of the album. It's another \"Turbo\" inspired track that is just wearing the clothes of a true Priest song. The opening riff and solo harkens back to better times, but as the song progresses, it's deeply simplistic and repetitive. Halford is just rambling about tough-guy stuff while that same riff just loops over and over again. \"Come and Get It\" isn't as painful a listen as some of their absolute worst material, but it's close to as clich\u00e9 and formulaic as Priest ever gets.\n\n\"Blood Red Skies\" seems to be the song that stuck the most off of this record and...I can't say I get why. It's really, really, really boring. The acoustic start is nice. Halford hits some great high notes, but also hits some of his lower and more emotional notes that he hadn't shown off in quite some time. Guitars on this song are almost non-existent. They're just holding one note at a time, and during the verses, they're quite literally not there at all. It's just Halford going on over some fake drumming and this electronic clicking sound. Then the chorus comes where the guitar stupor their way onto the song. The chorus is okay, but uninspired. It absolute does not make up for the nothingness you have to sit through to get there. The song is a screaming dud of a track that is also WAY too long. It's a pretentiously long song considering the absolute lack of effort that went into it. The closer \"Monsters of Rock\" is a bit of a better 'epic' than that. First of all, it's an appropriate length. The song actually has an atmosphere to ride with and the guitars are more noticeable. The track still suffers because it stays at one frustratingly stomping pace the entire way, but there is at least substance here. \"Monsters of Rock\" is another track that was very close to being really good if it got a bit more love and attention. It's just a few transitions or varied parts away from being an unsung classic.\n\nThe title track is definitely as good as the album gets. While I wouldn't call it a must listen to Priest track, it's got an adrenaline fueled pace and a frantic melody from Halford. His high notes are done as exclamation points in the perfect places. The solo is one of my all time favorites, and is up their in terms of pure catchiness in a guitar solo as \"Exciter\" from \"Stained Class.\" It's just good fun staple Priest material. Unfortunately, the rest of the album can't measure up to even the title track's standards. The only other track I enjoy from this release is \"Hard as Iron.\" Now, I do want to say that the unfortunate thing about \"Hard as Iron\" is that the moment their next album was released, it made \"Hard as Iron\" obsolete. \"Hard as Iron\" is another fast paced track with blazing guitar and a fierce chorus. It's exactly like what they'd go on to do on their next release. But everything that they brought to the table on the upcoming \"Painkiller\" is a better version of this. \"Hard as Iron\" is solid ground-work for greatness with a skillfully done solo and really fun chorus. It just REALLY makes me want to switch to songs off \"Painkiller\" instead. I'm not sure if you can consider that a fault of the song, though.\n\nAt its best \"Ram It Down\" is a solid mixed bag of tracks that the same band would essentially go on to one-up in their immediate next release. At its worse, it's a rehashing and maybe slight upgrade of an album that was already despised upon this one's release. So really, it just can't get out of its own way. It's a record that won't offend, but also won't be remembered. Out of their entire discography, this might be their most intentionally overlooked and passed over releases. It's the C+ child in a rather large family filled mostly with either valedictorians or drug addicts. When the parents meet other parents, they'd spend hours talking about the drama surrounding their worst kids or the successes of their best. And then one of the others will suddenly remember and say \"Oh, how's \"Ram It Down,\" by the way?\" The parents will respond \"Oh, they're fine\" and the conversation will move on. Never mentioning them again as the attention moves to other children. \"Ram It Down\" is definitely worth a listen, but there's very good reason why it doesn't come up in conversation much.\n",
        "\nIt's pretty much mandatory that immediately after Judas Priest releases one of their greatest albums ever, they'd have to release one of their worst. It's truly shocking to me that all three times the band came out with a mind-blowing album, the one that immediately followed is so bad. It happened after \"Stained Class,\" it happened this time, and it will happen one more time in the future. Priest's \"Turbo\" is usually the one that everyone points to when referring to bad Priest. \"Turbo\" and \"Point of Entry\" are often compared because they're both awful. However, the obvious and crystal clear difference between these two albums is that \"Point of Entry\" is just a meandering snooze fest of an album. \"Turbo\" has much higher highs than \"Point of Entry.\" However, it also has lower lows. That being said, I've always said that a 'bad' album is in many ways better than an album that isn't quite as 'bad,' but is more boring. That holds true here.\n\n\"Turbo\" is yet another attempt from Priest to hit the mainstream. However, where their previous attempts always had mediocre guitar parts and nothing at all in terms of songwriting besides a half-baked catchy chorus, the components are all there for \"Turbo.\" A lot of the riffs across the record are still solid, as are the lead guitar parts. However, the vocals, both in terms of melodies and choruses, are sickening. I've said before that I can handle my fair share of cheese in metal, but these songs are nauseating. They're not just cheesy. They are desperate and pandering. They are down on hands and knees BEGGING to get your attention. The songs don't speak for themselves. That is the true death sentence for \"Turbo.\"\n\n\"Rock You All Around the World\" is a perfect example. The opening riff is a quick, aggressive, biting riff that sounds like it could have been from \"Defenders of the Faith.\" The next riff it transitions into is a little bit cheesier, but catchy enough for sure. Then Halford enters, and while he still maintains his incredible vocals, the melodies and mood take a sudden shift. Suddenly the song just takes on the immediate feeling of desperation and pandering to teenagers. It's supposed to be this inspiring rebellious song, but despite an undeniably catchy chorus, it's just too sickeningly deliberate to get into. It makes no attempts to hide this fact, which makes it a strong deterrent. \"Wild Nights, Hot & Crazy Days\" also has a solid riff and a chorus that is equally and frustratingly catchy. However, once again, the song is just to blatant and pathetically desperate. This is your typical party song. This song is Priest begging you to play this song at a bar or a house party as you kick back and crack open a beer. If that's your thing, there's nothing inherently wrong with that. There are plenty of bands who make their entire careers out of making music like that. The difference is that these bands aren't usually so desperate and deliberate about making 'party' songs. They usually set a mood or a tone and let the rest of the song speak for itself in terms of what it's trying to be. Priest couldn't have made this song any more clear if they put stickers on the album cover. It's cringe-worthy.\n\nThe seeds are also planted for \"Out in the Cold.\" The keyboard intro is eerie and expressive. The intro makes it feel like a classic Priest power ballad is coming. Or a slower, powerful stomping epic. And to be fair, what it delivers isn't THAT off the mark from the former. \"Out in the Cold\" is one of the better tracks off this record. But once again, the melodies are just too pathetic to make it sink in. It sounds like a song that plays during an 80's action movie's credits. It's too whiny and misses the mark too much to be really memorable. The title track is another of the better tracks the record has to offer. It's basic. It's simplistic. It's an extremely dated song at this point in time. However, it's fun. And that's the long and the short of it. \"Turbo Lover\" is a very fun song that has JUST enough cheese. It's not overly done like most of the rest of this album. It's just that right amount of catchy without being annoying. Could it have been better? Most certainly. Is it still a fun little song to come back to every now and then? Definitely.\n\nTwo of the most sickeningly irritating songs the album has to offer unfortunately come back to back. I've mentioned pandering and desperate meandering several times already, but it gets absolutely no worse than on \"Private Property\" and \"Parental Guidance.\" The former is a want-to-be tough guy song. The mood is sickening, the chorus is boring, and the very nature of the song is worthy of an eye-roll. Once again, the song is just too much of an attention seeker even when going for its target audience. \"Parental Guidance\" hides nothing, though. It's pathetically sappy from the first second it plays. The verse melodies have this vomit inducing false nostalgic feel. The chorus is an absolute train wreck. Not only is it not catchy and serves no purpose, but it's disjointed and confused. For some reason, they feel the need to fill time to get the chorus melody in line with the timing of the song with \"no no no's\" that mean nothing and serve no purpose. \"Parental Guidance\" is disgusting and carries no weight or ambition. I cannot see this song pleasing anyone. It's absolutely one of the worst Priest has ever offered.\n\nIf there was one thing that could make \"Turbo\" salvageable, it'd be the closer \"Reckless.\" This song doesn't belong on this record. It is too good for \"Turbo.\" \"Reckless\" is like a song you might find on \"Screaming for Vengeance.\" Anyone who passes this entire album is really missing out on one hidden gem. Sure, it's no doubt that \"Reckless\" still has some mild cheese in it, but it's SO good. The riff is fantastic, Halford's verse melodies have a great balance of his higher notes and gruffer vocals, and the chorus is another balance of cool and cheesy. \"Reckless\" is easily the only song on this whole album that really feels like a true Judas Priest song the entire way through. It genuinely feels out of place on this record, but in the best possible way. You sit through this entire album that feels uncomfortable in its own skin, and then this song blazes forward to close out the album. It's almost sad, because if the entirety of \"Turbo\" had a similar feel and style as \"Reckless,\" it'd have been a very solid record. Do not sleep on this track.\n\nI think what really gets me about \"Turbo\" is that it shows the inconsistency in Judas Priest. Throughout their entire career, they've never had more than a 2-3 album string of consistently good releases in a row. And that's quite a blemish for a band as legendary as they are. They just never seemed to be able to sit down and accept what they were and where their fans were until way, way later in life. In closing, I think \"Turbo\" is better than its reputation seems to be. However, that doesn't mean it's a good record. It's far from their worst album. I wouldn't put \"Turbo\" in the bottom three Judas Priest records, but it hovers dangerously close to bottom five territory. For better or worse, there's always SOMETHING about this album that keeps your attention. There isn't a point in \"Turbo\" where you fall asleep at the wheel, and that's enough to save it to some degree.\n",
        "\nFor Judas Priest, it would get no better than this. We have reached the apex. \"Defenders of the Faith\" picks up right where \"Screaming for Vengeance\" left off. The only difference is, it kicks any commercial aspirations to the side and gives us a true Judas Priest heavy metal classic. It's heavy, it's catchy, almost every song is amazingly memorable, and it's unrelenting. It's such a relief that we go from an album so devoid of decent guitar playing to one of the two most defining guitar driven albums they have. One thing I like to point out about the guitars on this album is how influential they are. This record is the ground-work for so much dual lead guitar playing. Not only did Judas Priest continue to build on this concept, but SO many other bands built off the frame that this started, too. That's not to say Priest never did something like that prior to this album. Of course they had. But \"Defenders of the Faith\" was the first to be so driven and defined by it.\n\nHow can I start with anything besides \"The Sentinel?\" It's a fan favorite and well deserved. \"The Sentinel\" isn't a fan favorite because of nonsense and cheap pop tactics like \"Breaking the Law\" or \"You've Got Another Thing Comin.'\" It's a fan favorite because every single Judas Priest fan who hears this song appreciates the intensity. The fire. The absolute definition of what metal represents that this song nails. From an ominous and brilliant start that steamrolls over you to a quickly increasingly intense proper start, \"The Sentinel\" gives no surcease. It fires from all cylinders, and Halford's screams are brutal and piercing. \"Some Heads Are Gonna Roll\" has the same excellent and extremely catchy guitar playing as \"The Sentinel.\" And while it's not nearly as explosive or aggressive as \"The Sentinel,\" the core riff is just as memorable and catchy. The chorus too is the perfect kind of catchy. It'll get stuck in your head, and is a very 'sing-able' chorus, but it never betrays its metal identity just to achieve that. What it lacks in bombastic intensity, it makes up for in a smooth unshakable groove.\n\n\"Jawbreaker\" is my favorite Priest song of all time. On a personal aside, I actually use this song as a punchline to shame people who don't know Rob Halford's story. I have them listen to the song and get their wheels spinning asking them to confirm what a badass song it is and how absolutely metal-defining it is. After they agree that it's the epitome of badass, I reveal to them that it's about sucking a cock so big it breaks your jaw. They generally don't believe I'm serious until I talk about Rob Halford and let them really look at the lyrics. It's EXTRA fun if they're homophobic and suddenly start to double back on every positive thing they said about the song. But the song itself is just pure fire. It snaps back at you, and every moment is filled with head banging adrenaline fueled Priest awesomeness. The riffs are so frantic and intense. The ABSOLUTE best part about the song is the very end of it. Halford takes the chorus that was established and suddenly hits what may be his highest notes of all time to give it an extra thrust before it climaxes. You're welcome for that pun.\n\n\"Freewheel Burning\" starts the album off right with energetic fun. This is another song that just builds upon itself to get to the chorus. The verse melodies are so incredibly energetic, and Halford's chops are on full display. Few songs mix just plain fun playing with such an off the rails fast paced energy as well as \"Freewheel Burning.\" The solo is staple Judas Priest. It's hard to get much more out of a song. Not only that, but \"Freewheel Burning\" is one of my least favorite tracks on the album, yet it's STILL so good. Where \"Freewheel Burning\" is fun, \"Eat Me Alive\" doubles down on the dark aggression similar to \"The Sentinel.\" In fact, \"Eat Me Alive\" might be even more ominous and dark than \"The Sentinel.\" Halford sells every single moment from it. From anger to tortured, he sells the mood of the song. The riff behind him is like a shark that smells blood. It's hunting and stalking him at every turn. It's dark mood adds a great level of depth and variation to the album, much like how \"Freewheel Burning\" does in the opposite direction.\n\nEven the slower songs on \"Defenders of the Faith\" pull their weight. I have a soft spot for \"Night Comes Down.\" It has a nice bass groove from Ian Hill and Halford's emotional range really make it a treat. It adds just enough heaviness in the right spots to add complexity and range to it without diluting the emotional mood it sets. Everything about the chorus is magnificent. The chorus riff and Halford's melody are equally catchy. You can listen to the chorus, focus on one of them, rewind and refocus on the other, and both are supremely memorable. \"Night Comes Down\" is insanely underrated for a Priest slower song. I think it's right up there with \"Beyond the Realms of Death.\" Maybe even a little bit better. \"Love Bites\" is not quite as good as \"Night Comes Down,\" but it still doesn't weigh the album down any. I think there should be a bit more something there. I love how the guitar part for the chorus perfectly matches Halford, but the song just kind of chugs along the rest of the way. I think they could have added another part to it, or some way to transition it some without losing what it's going for. Again, for one of the weaker tracks on \"Defenders of the Faith,\" it's still very, very good.\n\nIn fact, the one real solid shot \"Defenders of the Faith\" takes in its title defense is the closing two tracks that merge together. \"Heavy Duty/Defenders of the Faith\" doesn't really need to exist. It's essentially just a slightly heavier version of \"United\" but without any semblance of catchiness. It's hard to have a song that just stomps and plods along like it's an anthem if there's nothing really...chant-able about it. It's a genuine waste of time. It has nothing to add and no business being on this record. Just fade the album out after \"Night Comes Down.\" The record would have been a perfect one if they left it at eight tracks. It really feels like this one was thrown in as genuine filler because they had a bit of space left to fill.\n\n\"Defenders of the Faith\" is such an isolated experience. Where the masterpiece of 70's Priest \"Stained Class\" came pretty close to the end of the decade, \"Defenders of the Faith\" is right in the middle of it. All around it are albums that just can't hang with it. While \"Screaming for Vengeance\" is FAR, FAR better than the album that came on the other side of \"Defenders of the Faith,\" it still makes this record feel like it was just an explosion of every ounce of good ideas the band had during this decade in one big bang. Priest still had plenty of good left to offer in the future, but after they burned through the fuel gauge so much with this album, they would need to crawl at a snail's pace for a couple of records after \"Defenders of the Faith\" before they'd be gassed up and ready to roll again.\n",
        "\nJudas Priest did indeed have their vengeance after the utter failure that was \"Point of Entry\" when they released another classic titled \"Screaming for Vengeance.\" However, once again, I have to be in the naysayer camp just a little bit. \"Screaming for Vengeance\" is the 'good' album of 80's Judas Priest, but it is not the masterpiece of 80's Priest. This record is often pointed to as one of the best albums from them and a rejuvenation of Judas Priest, but I don't go that far. In my opinion, \"Screaming for Vengeance\" is little more than a souped-up \"British Steel.\" At the end of the day, \"Screaming for Vengeance\" is still a very, VERY inconsistent album that falls into many of the same traps as the previous three albums did. It's just better at hiding this because it delivers more of what we as fans wanted to see. So we end up getting confirmation bias. We hone in on the electric elements of this album without really taking a deep dive at what else is out there.\n\nLike I did for \"British Steel,\" I'll get the 'hits' out of the way first. The first is good news. \"The Hellion/Electric Eye\" is another of those songs I spoke about that has broken out into the mainstream. It's not QUITE as mainstream as \"Breaking the Law,\" but when your song gets played in a decent amount of commercials, you know you've made a mainstream splash. Fortunately, \"The Hellion/Electric Eye\" is not only head and shoulders better than \"Breaking the Law,\" but it is also one of the best tracks on the entire record. Sometimes I think when people talk about this album, they just think of this song without taking into account what else is on it. The song is smooth and has so much of that patented Priest riff work. The chorus is the perfect level of catchy without being cheesy like their commercial stuff. Again, Halford really shows what an incredible vocal range he has, and the effects that go on his voice that give it that slight robotic feeling add to the atmosphere of the overall song.\n\n\"You've Got Another Thing Comin'\" isn't the worst of the Judas Priest 'singles,' but there's not much going for it besides its attitude. The song is really nothing more than a hype song. It's a party track. A karaoke song for metal fans. The riffs are non-existent. The guitar work is just there to remind you who the band is. But it has no weight or bearing on the song. The song does have a slick chorus that will get stuck in your head, but like I mentioned a lot in \"Point of Entry,\" without any depth to your song, you can't hang your hat on that. And \"You've Got Another Thing Comin'\" has some of the least depth to any Judas Priest song. It's at LEAST better than \"Living After Midnight,\" though. \"(Take These) Chains\" is your other eye-rollingly clich\u00e9 song. This is another song that bets EVERYTHING on the chorus. The start sounds very much like a 70's Priest song, and the verse melodies stick nicely, but once again, Tipton and KK aren't adding a single thing. They're adding in the most stock guitar chugging as Halford spins his tale. Priest's bread and butter is that unique, complex, dual guitar work. Yet on one of their most classic albums, we have so many tracks where the guitars are a non-factor.\n\nFor an album heralded as a pure and true heavy metal album, the riffs aren't getting all that much better. \"Pain and Pleasure\" has a slow and stomping energy to it, but the guitar playing is amazingly thin. Not only are the riffs again, barely there, but the guitar volume in general on this track is quite low. The song again is simplistic. It has no depths, no transitions, and no energy. So, we have a simplistic metal song with poor guitar playing. What's left? Well, the chorus is garbage too. It doesn't have any life in it, and it's really not catchy like some of the others aspire to be, too. \"Pain and Pleasure\" is a filler track in every way. \"Fever\" also should have been better than it is. The clean intro really makes you feel like you're going to get a track that's properly built. It feels like it's going to be a carefully crafted masterpiece. But when the heavy part kicks in, we're still missing a riff. Tipton and KK are almost just holding single notes for the verses. Even when they break into a chorus riff, it stumbles about and seems unclear where it's trying to go. The chorus, much like \"Pain and Pleasure,\" invokes no emotion. It's a chorus that is just there. It has the title of the song for the sake of it. It's not a culmination of anything. \"Fever\" winds up with just a bit more depth to it than a lot of the other songs on \"Screaming for Vengeance,\" but still isn't anything special.\n\nThe only track that I think is better than \"The Hellion/Electric Eye\" here is \"Bloodstone.\" We get an honest to goodness RIFF at the start! And it GOES somewhere! That starting riff transitions into a slicker and quicker riff that paves the way for the rest of the song. Now, the verses still resort to single note patterns too, which irritates me, but Halford's range, high notes, and emotion carry me through it. The chorus is killer too. It's a single word chorus, but Halford's high note carries it to the rafters. The best thing I find about \"Bloodstone\" is that it's something of a precursor to our next stop on the Judas Priest tour. The title track is also a solid experience for a lot of the same reasons. The guitar parts have levels of depth to them and they move a little bit. While they aren't the duo's finest, they're solid and get the blood pumping. Halford's screaming full force here. The chorus is a desperate and pleading cry that hits hard, and it follows with a rather slick transition that sounds like the song is about to slow down before it fires up again.\n\nFor what it's worth, while the majority of the riffs on this record aren't up to par, the solos and lead playing, like you'd expect are extremely good. Trust me, I enjoy \"Screaming for Vengeance\" more than it sounds. But when people say this was the album that saved Judas Priest or reinvigorated them, I have to deny it. It was, for sure, on the right track of doing that, though. \"Screaming for Vengeance\" took clear steps in the right direction. It still just couldn't let go of that aspiration for commercial success, though. It's a more metal record, but it is still looking in the rear view mirror to the road it passed. \"Screaming for Vengeance\" is a solid album. It deserves love and attention. However, it is POULTRY compared to what was to follow.\n",
        "\nAfter the huge success of \"British Steel,\" Judas Priest took all of their weight and threw it fully off the cliff into the pop-rock cesspool. Where \"British Steel\" followed a recipe of ingredients to make a dish blended with metal and more commercial elements, when they were making \"Point of Entry\" they accidentally spilled the entire bag of commercial into the stew this time. There's close to nothing worthwhile or salvageable about \"Point of Entry.\" It is an embarrassment of a record that satisfies absolutely no one fully. There is no doubt in my mind that \"Point of Entry\" is in contention for the worst Priest album of all time. There's only one that I think is close to the same level as \"Point of Entry's\" levels of bad. And spoiler alert for you...it isn't \"Turbo.\"\n\nThis is another review that I'm really not thrilled to be doing because I'm going to sound like a broken record. There aren't all that many tracks on \"Point of Entry\" that are so terrible that I can dissect and point out all of the flaws to and solidly say \"this is where this went wrong.\" Every single song is just so simplistic to the point where it insults your intelligence listening to it. It's horrible in the sense that it's painfully boring. Again, I almost WISH there were moments where the record was awful that I could tear to pieces. But it's just so insanely dull. Almost every song just blends together in your mind. You can listen to this album all the way through and then look back at the track list and not be able to point out one thing unique about each individual song.\n\nI'm going to start with the few things about the record that I find tolerable. \"Desert Plains\" is the only track across the entire record that is almost a genuine song. There's emotion to the song, and that makes it stand out. Halford sounds extremely sad and nostalgic. The verses have a solid build to the chorus, and Halford excellently uses his high notes to accent the chorus and make it feel real and explosive. \"Desert Plains\" isn't a standout Judas Priest song, but it's the ONLY fully solid thing on \"Point of Entry.\" \"Don't Go\" is the only other song that's even close to a full song, in my opinion. It's pretty boring like most of the record, and me saying this doesn't at all make it a decent song, but it actually builds, which is a great breath of fresh air. It has a slow, measured verse melody and then fires away with a rather catchy chorus. It's maybe the only other time where a song on the record has even the smallest bit of depth.\n\nThe last glimmer of positivity on the entire record is that the chorus of \"You Say Yes\" is unfairly catchy. It's catchy in almost a primal way that hits a raw nerve. Now, the song is still horrible and goes nowhere, but that chorus is just...begrudgingly solid. Halford really sells it with both his high notes and layering vocals. This record has worse than \"You Say Yes,\" but it's still not great. Every time I listen to the closer \"On the Run,\" it gets my hopes up, too. The opening riff sounds like genuine Judas Priest. The bass that comes after it makes you feel like a real song is coming but...it's all a fa\u00e7ade. The chorus has some of Halford's really serious high notes, and there are spurts of guitar flourishes here and there that hint at real Priest but there's nothing that comes together about it. It has the same swinging cliched beat as almost the entire album, and besides those few small glints of beauty, it just chugs along with mediocrity.\n\nOn the flip side, the only song that is flat out painful to listen to is \"All the Way.\" It is hands down the worst track on the record, and it's in contention for worst Judas Priest track of all time. I can BARELY finish it. I'm gritting my teeth and closing my eyes the whole way through because it is so painful to listen to. Halford rambles across the beginning of the song like he's a bad MC at a wedding you don't want to be at. He sounds lost and out of place. The chorus sounds like it's trying to go for a southern rock style and is so painfully bad. It's so uncomfortable hearing the band so out of their element. They SOUND uncomfortable playing this song. There aren't many songs that leave me begging for it to end more than \"All the Way.\" It's close to torture inducing. The following track \"Troubleshooter\" is also painful, but not quite as bad. In the world of music, someone's lover/partner has been called almost every euphemism or analogy in the book. Calling that person \"My little troubleshooter\" is in the top ten for worst of these ever written. Couple that with the fact that the song is boring and repetitive, and you have a perfectly skippable experience. It's really bad.\n\nI don't really have that much to pinpoint about many of the other songs on the album. They're all the same. They almost all have the exact same beat and the exact same formulaic progression to them. The riffs are always stock generic parts that are just made to be background noise for whatever ridiculously off the mark chorus they came up with for that particular song. Some are more painful than others, and some have the smallest hint of being a genuine song than others, but they all are just a blur of generic nonsense. The thing about being commercial is that, for the song to stick, there needs to be SOMETHING about it that holds an audience. A chorus, a chant, a particular line that the masses can cling to and scream out like the writers were writing the song specifically about them in their delusional brains, but SOMETHING. You can't just write songs with no substance and somewhat of a catchy chorus and think you'll get away with it. \"British Steel\" hit the mark in that regard. Yet \"Point of Entry,\" which is trying harder than \"British Steel\" did, whiffed entirely.\n\n\"Point of Entry\" isn't bad because it isn't traditional Judas Priest. It isn't bad because it's not 'metal.' It's bad because it's cliche, formulaic, and boring. There's not a good idea to be had. The fact that the band is completely out of their element is just the final nail in a well established coffin. I've met fans that are like \"Oh, it's kind of overlooked,\" and I want to ask them. What are you looking for that you found here? I can't even recommend this album to someone that just wants catchy rock songs, because there's not even much about it that's catchy. In every single facet, this album is one that simply doesn't need to exist. Fortunately, Judas Priest learned their lesson from \"Point of Entry's\" failure. At least for a time. Following this, the band would have vengeance and instill us with faith again. They kicked and screamed to defend their honor, and with that, they came out with some of the best material of their entire career.\n",
        "\nHere we are. We have reached the start of 80's Judas Priest and immediately get to start with their most popular record \"British Steel.\" With Les Binks leaving the band, they'd recruit Dave Holland who'd be with them for almost the entire decade. Holland isn't the absolute worst drummer I've ever heard, but calling him a good drummer would be pushing it. Not only that, but he turned into quite a terrible person later in his life, so his addition is a disappointing loss across the board. \"British Steel\" itself isn't a bad record, but it's pretty boring. For every solid track it has, there's a horrible one leaching off the belly.\n\nThe album picked up almost exactly where \"Killing Machine\" left off. The biggest difference to me is that \"British Steel\" knows what it wanted to be. Where \"Killing Machine\" tried to skirt the line between traditional Priest heaviness and radio friendly rock, \"British Steel\" is honest with itself, which immediately makes it a more enjoyable experience. \"British Steel\" begged for mainstream radio airplay. \"British Steel\" also doesn't try and short change the audience with half-baked 2 minute songs. There's a bit more thought to the songwriting. It's definitely not a pop-rock album by any means (we'll get there), but it's clearly and unabashedly reaching out for a wider audience. Trying to be more 'mainstream' doesn't instantly make the album bad. But the fact that it's quite repetitive and unimaginative hurts it a lot.\n\nI'll start with the two \"singles\" from this album to get that out of the way. \"Breaking the Law\" is pretty much THE Judas Priest track. It has become a definite metal anthem, and it's one of just a handful or two of metal songs that to this day breaks through to mainstream audiences. You can easily find people quoting or parodying the chorus to the song that have absolutely no idea who Judas Priest even is. Getting a song to that point is a feat that deserves recognition whether you love it or hate it. I stand right there in the middle. I don't dislike \"Breaking the Law\" at all. If it comes on, I can definitely get into it, but it's definitely not a Priest song I ever actively seek out. The fact that it's so short absolutely helps it, because I think the song would have gotten aggravating if it was longer. On the flip side, if I never hear \"Living After Midnight\" again, it'll be too soon. I despise this song more than words can describe accurately. It's pathetic. This is a song I'd expect out of a band like Bon Jovi or Journey. Not Judas Priest. From the SECOND the song starts, it's just so pathetically sappy. It's like the band is screaming \"Come on! Throw your hands in the air!!\" The chorus is vomit inducing. Every single thing about \"Living After Midnight\" is perfectly crafted to be radio friendly. Even down to the fact that it's EXACTLY 3 minutes and 30 seconds. The PERFECT amount of time for radio airplay. There are few songs that are as sickeningly sold out as \"Living After Midnight.\"\n\nBut what if I told you \"Living After Midnight\" isn't even the worst song on \"British Steel?\" Surely a song that loathsome HAS to be the worst. Nope. \"You Don't Have to be Old to be Wise\" takes that crap-dripping medal. This song is what I like to think plays in a bar for washed up older men who are still trying to fool themselves into thinking they're in their glory days. This track playing from a jukebox in the background as they play pool and talk about what studs they are. It's a nauseating old man's wet dream of a song with no substance other than trying to be a mock anthem. The most basic of chords and 'clappable' riffing and a chorus that is strangely built on and sloppily executed. It's such a long chorus that it just kind of comes out of nowhere. The chorus starts and you have to almost catch up with it because it was so unexpected. It's the longest song on the record, but possibly the song with the least progression and depth to it. There's nothing redeemable or excusable about this one. \"United\" is the true 'anthem' song off \"British Steel.\" It follows in the footsteps of \"Take on the World\" from the previous album. \"United\" is a little bit more tolerable than its predecessor, though. It's a bit heavier, and the chorus has a little bit more emotion to it. It's more of a song than \"Take on the World\" so it's not as big of a waste of time. I wouldn't call it stellar, but I'd sooner march down the street singing \"United\" than I would listen to \"Living After Midnight\" or \"You Don't Have to be Old to be Wise\" again.\n\nEven some of the better songs on \"British Steel\" are missing something, though. There are no better examples than the first two tracks it delivers. \"Rapid Fire\" has a rare moment of solid drumming from Dave Holland, and has a fierce riff that takes focus and then lays off to let Halford sing. It feels like a cat hunting from the grass. But...then nothing happens. There's no burning chorus. There's no fantastic transition to another point. There's no growth to the song. It just keeps going. It stalks the listener for so long that the proverbial bird flies away before it pounces. \"Rapid Fire\" absolutely should have been better. But it ends up being an okay track that only leaves disappointment. \"Metal Gods\" is a little bit better, but still isn't exactly salvageable. The chorus itself has an amazingly metallic and robotic feel that is really unique and very fitting. It's extremely catchy. But the rest of the song that gets us there is just too formulaic to be worth it. The main riff is really weak, and Halford isn't doing anything all that special himself. So there's nothing in the verses that really grabs the listener's attention and holds it tight. \"Metal Gods\" has such a fantastic chorus that I wish I could like it more, but it really needs some more depth.\n\nThe true shining gem that we got from \"British Steel\" is \"The Rage.\" First, Ian Hill gets a little bit of time to shine, which is extremely rare. The song has a really fantastic grove to it. The bass and the drums bounce off each other really nicely to get the song moving. The riff is a heavy and catchy one, and Halford shows a lot of range during his rage. The verses have his deeper and more gruff vocals, but he busts out his soaring high notes after a perfect build to the chorus. This is definitely the only song I find across \"British Steel\" that is really built with balance and an ebb and flow. It's definitely the only song I come back to with any frequency from this album.\n\n\"British Steel\" is absolutely an important point in Priest's history. It opened the door to let a lot of people in, and it's not hard to see why this album can be very appealing to a wide audience that likes harder music. At the same time, though, once you peel back the layers and look inside, you'll find an album that lacks very much depth. It's a surface level album. I'm sure this is going to sound amazingly pretentious, but \"British Steel\" is a near perfect album if you just want to throw on something fun and somewhat heavy in the background. It's a very enjoyable album if you don't analyze and dissect it. If you really take a close look, though, you find an album with no meat on the bones. \"British Steel\" starts off 80's Priest very similarly to the way \"Rocka Rolla\" started off 70's Priest. With an alright album that had potential, but definitely could have been better. Unfortunately, where \"Rocka Rolla's\" follow up only got better, \"British Steel's\" successor got worse. Much, much worse.\n",
        "\nThe image we have of this album today, 42 years after the release when I am writing these words, is difficult to explain. On one side, since it was the definitive commercial success of Judas Priest, it is considered an essential album for conversations about the band or heavy metal in general, since it became a standard of the NWOBHM, and therefore it is an album that everyone who is minimally involved in this music has listened to, but at the same time, due to its success, historical acclaim and classic status, it has made it more vulnerable to criticism. There have been many comments around British Steel questioning its quality, comparing it to the rest of the band's discography, and even questioning its authenticity, denigrating the album for containing deliberately radio friendly songs with excessive hard rock elements.\n\nTracks like \"United\" \"Living After Midnight\" or \"Breaking the Law\" are usually songs criticized by the most hardcore fans of the scene due to their highly commercial tone, I will not lie I also used to think the same about these songs, but over time I have been appreciating more these tunes, \"United\" being the weakest of them all with an extremely mellow chorus surprises me with the effectiveness of it and with the sound of their sharp guitars at the beginning of the song, musically there is something there but it is not exploited. \"Living After Midnight\" is another easy one to hate, it' s predictable and extremely repetitive with a chorus designed to be cheap and mainstream, none of that can be denied, but it's true that it fulfills the only function it's supposed to have, being damn catchy, plus the lyrics seem to be a reflection of Halford's double life when he was hiding his homosexuality so to think that this song has been sang by homophobic people makes me happy and makes me give it an extra point. And with \"Breaking the Law\" I don't even need to defend it, it's a great song and the reason why it works so well is because of its simplicity and its short duration, that's where its strength lies, its success is the result of its own quality and honestly I don't find any fault with it.\n\nThis album has also been commented a lot mainly on its side A in opposition to the criticisms of the commercialization of the sound, \"Rapid Fire\" and \"Grinder\" are the heaviest standards of the album and are undoubtedly classics in JP's discography. \"Rapid Fire\" surprises for having a structure that is not recurrent in the rest of the album, it bases its potential in a section where they intercalate crazy dualistic solos between passages sung by Halford, the rhythm is accelerated, close to speed metal, and in just four minutes it works as an opener where drums, guitars and vocalist have their space to shine. \"Grinder\" and, the sometimes undeservedly hated, \"Metal Gods\", go for this more classic structure, not so much for its speed but for its heaviness that many times is increased thanks to the use of the almost industrial percussion, fitting in with one of the main topics of the album.\n\nHowever, as the years go by and I listen to the album more and more, the A-side gets progressively more boring (with the exception of \"Rapid Fire\") and I feel that all my attention goes to the B-side, a totally underrated side in an album that has a reputation of being overrated. On that side, excluding \"Living After Midnight\" we have some of the under appreciated gems from the british band, each one deserving a special mention for one factor or another. \"The Rage\" contains an interesting experimental side with that reggae-like sound that intrudes at times, but far from being the only memorable part of the song, \"The Rage\" comes across as a heavy and calm track that has a skin-raising second half when Halford's piercing scream accompanies an instrumental that gives him room to shine but still claims his importance at every second with a laconic solo at the end marked by the powerful riff that accompanies the whole song. With \"You Don't Have to Be Old to Be Wise\" we have simply Halford's best performance on the whole album, the track is far from the heaviness or speed of others on the same album, but simply for the chorus part the song is worth its weight in gold even with its exaggerated hard rocker tone. \n\nThinking about how to close this write up I realise that I have always had problems to finish my reviews, maybe it's my problem but I think that giving a correct ending to something helps a lot to the final impression that we will take from it, at least at the first time, many bands usually close their records with the longest song of the album just for having that impression of a big finale, something epic, apotheosic. But here Judas Priest don't need more than four and a half minutes to give us what is, in my opinion, the best album ending of all time. \"Steeler\" begins like any other song, although with the subtle detail that the drums enter with the same pattern with which it ends, it has its guitar solo, its rhythmic cut to add diversity and movement and so on. But with barely two minutes left, a spectacular and unexpected build up begins to emerge, suddenly the electric and sidereal sound of the guitars begins to flood the ears while the growing riff and the drums raise more and more the intensity transmitting in a very short time an absolutely perfect exercise of tempo control. Every time I listen to this track I can't ask myself why the hell aren't more people talking about this track and why JP doesn't close every single concert with this fucking masterpiece that closes an outstanding album.\n\nBritish Steel is the improvement of the songwriting and production that started with Killing Machine, the progressive tints disappear but here I don't miss them as I did in the previous album, and the new influences are way better introduced, bringing the best of them, also if you pay attention you will hear a lot of details in the production especially in the percussion, which moves between different styles and sounds in order to adapt better to the need of each song, but this also happens with the guitars and with the vocals, this album is a perfect example of production and mastering, as it is also a perfect example of songwriting and above all a perfect example of how to be pure heavy metal.\n",
        "\nI consider going from \"Stained Class\" to \"Killing Machine\" very similarly to going from Sabbath's \"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\" to \"Sabotage.\" Every bit of progression that the former built up and worked so hard on dissolved and degraded entirely. \"Killing Machine\" marks the first time Priest kept the exact same lineup for two albums in a row. It would also be the last album for Les Binks. While \"Stained Class\" blazed ahead and provided an amazing display of skill and brilliant songwriting, \"Killing Machine\" retains none of that and focuses on short bland tracks that only have small bursts of magnificence interspersed. For my money, \"Killing Machine\" is positively the worst album of 70's Judas Priest.\n\nThe first radical difference anyone would notice is that there are only four songs on \"Killing Machine\" that touch 4 minutes. Considering \"Burnin' Up\" is pretty much silent for the first 7 seconds, I'd even go on to say only 3 tracks are over 4 minutes. On \"Stained Class\" there were only two songs UNDER 4 minutes. Now, this isn't to say that a song needs to be on the longer side to be good, but at the same time, it's extremely hard for a song to have much substance at shorter lengths. It's even harder for an ALBUM to have substance if all of the tracks that make it up are like this. To add to that, two tracks don't even hit 3 minutes, and another two just BARELY touch the 3 minute mark. There was little hope for this album when it's written that way. Not only that, but where drummer Les Binks was so creative and brilliant on \"Stained Class,\" he's simply holding the line on this record. I'm not sure if he phoned it in because he knew he didn't want to stick around or if he was asked to pull it back, but he's a shell of what he was on the previous record.\n\nWe'll start with the shortest song \"Hell Bent for Leather\" as an example. It's actually one of the better songs across the record. It has a pretty grooving riff and a catchy chorus that balances a good intensity from Halford with catchy guitar hooks. But it goes nowhere. It marches in, teases you with the promise of a solid track, and prances right back out. It's almost hard for me to call this a 'song' because there's so little going on with it. What it brings is good, but I equate it to going to a restaurant and the meal being nothing but bread. Even if the bread is REALLY good, it will leave you unsatisfied when that's all there is. The title track is very similar in that regard. I absolutely love the suave and 'dangerous' atmosphere the song brings to the table. It's a pretty unique feel to a song and musically starts to tell a great story. But the song also goes absolutely nowhere. The first half of the song just feels like it's building up to a strong and powerful transition until another part. It BEGS to have something different to expand on it. However, after a good, but extremely short solo, the song returns to what it has been doing from the start and then ends. It's one of the most unsatisfying songs I've ever heard. There should be more. This should be better. It's inexcusable and borderline lazy to me for them to almost abandon ship on writing this song properly.\n\nI find \"Take on the World\" to be almost a precursor for \"British Steel.\" Stylistically, there's so much about this song that is similar to a lot of content on \"British Steel.\" Sadly, that doesn't mean it's good Again, I think it's a stretch to even consider this a 'song.' \"Take on the World\" is nothing more than a chant. No depth. No substance. We're just wasting run-time on this album with a mediocre chant of a 'song.' There would be nothing lost to the world if this track never existed. Besides that, the closer \"Evil Fantasies\" is pretty much the worst this album has to offer. A dull, bored, lazy riff is all over this song while Halford just almost comically sings over it. He tries to be super theatrical and dramatic, but it's eye-roll worthy. It's four minutes of the same generic stomping beat and bored guitar part while Halford does everything within his power to save it. Not only does \"Evil Fantasies\" have no substance, but the little bit it provides is awful as well.\n\nThe opener \"Delivering the Goods\" is a little bit more of your traditional Judas Priest song. It's certainly not bad, but could have been better. It's heavier and has a solid groove to get the blood pumping. The chorus has a great Halford swag and is quite catchy. But very quickly, the flaws that show up all over the album don't escape this song. It doesn't have any solid progression or depth to it. It's verse-chorus, verse-chorus, solo, verse-chorus. It's generic in the laziest way possible. The bottom line is that this song is fun, but it should be better. It's fair to expect more from Priest at this point. The previously touched on \"Burnin' Up\" is the other more faithful Judas Priest track on the album, and it's about the same level of quality. It has a bit more of an ebb and flow to it that makes it hit a little bit harder, but there isn't that much depth to the riffing. There's just a little bit more progression and actual songwriting involved on this track that makes it passable. For this album, \"Burnin' Up\" is one of the more solid tracks. For Judas Priest's history? It's middle of the road at best.\n\n\"Before the Dawn\" is definitely the best standout track from \"Killing Machine.\" It might be Priest's best pure ballad. Halford hits all of the emotions you need, and where on older albums, it was always a bit unfitting, this song fits right in on this album and makes it shine. This song is actually just what the album needed to give it some substance. \"Evening Star\" is also very upfront with what it's going for. While most of this record should have more depth to it and ends up as a massive let down, \"Evening Star\" does exactly what it needs to. It has an addictive chorus, and while there's nothing intrinsically special about it besides Halford's awesome high notes that make the chorus so memorable, I appreciate its honesty for lack of a better word. It's very clear that this song is a short and sweet little rocker of a track that isn't meant to have more to it than meets the eye. Again, while far from a Judas Priest highlight, it might be the only track on this record that leaves me wholly satisfied and not disappointed.\n\n\"Killing Machine\" was an album that was outclassed in every conceivable way by what came before it the day it was released. Priest were trend setters prior to this record. This time, they just got in line. The bottom line is the subpar, borderline lazy songwriting almost makes the record dead on arrival. It's not even like you can try to defend this album by saying \"Well, they were going in a more commercial direction\" like you can on some albums that are soon to come. This record is still too 'heavy' to be a commercially driven record, but it has the level of songwriting depth as a pop album. I call \"Killing Machine\" the Judas Priest 'sampler' album. It's just small samplings of appetizers that, while enjoyable, leaves you entirely empty without a 'main course' to follow it. Judas Priest absolutely has far worse albums in their discography than \"Killing Machine,\" but this one might just be the biggest slap in the face. There is truly just no excuse why this one wasn't better than it is.\n",
        "\nAfter hitting their stride with \"Sin After Sin,\" Judas Priest's follow up \"Stained Class\" delivered. For my money, \"Stained Class\" is one of the 'big three' of Judas Priest. It is undoubtedly the best album of theirs from the 70's. For this album, drummer Les Binks takes a seat, and he is the first Priest drummer to be on more than one album. Although his two album tenure isn't that much longer, his skill left a lasting impression. Many point to him being the best Priest drummer of all time, and it's hard to disagree with that assessment. He certainly picks up where Simon Phillips left off to give this album both the grove and the chops it needed. \"Stained Class\" remains an album to show to newcomers to teach them how making a record is done.\n\nLets start with what the record starts us off with. \"Exciter\" is exactly what an opener needs to be. Binks has an absolutely fantastic drum intro to set the tone, and following guitar parts enhance the energy. The verse melodies leave Halford a lot of room to work, but at the same time, they still have the end of the melody to bite back with. Halford leads the charge with the chorus, and the sinfully catchy solos all across this song make it an absolute classic. The melodic solo after the halfway mark is definitely in my top 10 solo list. I find myself humming it constantly. \"Beyond the Realms of Death\" is also a fan favorite that is well deserved. For every album now, Priest has had duds when it comes to softer songs. \"Epitaph,\" \"Last Rose of Summer,\" and beyond. While not all of those songs were horrible, at best they were very unfitting for the record. Finally, \"Beyond the Realms of Death\" is something of a power ballad, dancing from a soft acoustic part to a fiery heavier section. There's nothing about it that detracts from the rest of the record or sounds stylistically different. Each section flows flawlessly from one to the other back and forth, and each one perfectly hits the mood it's going for. The main heavy riff leaves a bit to be desired, but the song is just so well crafted that all is forgiven. Halford's cry of the title at the end is the cherry on top. It's sad and defeated, but has that unbridled power that closes it so nicely.\n\nI often hear \"Saints in Hell\" called one of the greatest metal songs ever recorded. And while I might not go THAT far, it's most certainly a standout on the album. Halford's high notes are on full blast. It gives the song something of a 'sermon' feel behind the riff. Ian Hill gets a rare chance to shine on this song, too. His grooving bassline is really the backbone that keeps this song flowing so well. \"Saints in Hell\" is just a heavy badass song. The attitude and chops are just classic and quintessential to make a fun metal song. \"Savage\" is a HUGE 'guilty pleasure' track for me. It might be my favorite on the whole album, but I also acknowledge it's not exactly the most 'special' track there is either. The grove is just so driving and catchy, though. Halford's opening shrieks and then his cries on the chorus are blistering. The riff has this pounding gallop and Halford's notes accent certain specific points of each line so well. When they hit together during the verses, it's almost threatening. Binks' ride cymbal pattern, sporadic double bass playing, and brilliant tom fills during the chorus make it a very refreshing track. \"Savage\" isn't as memorable or outstanding as a lot on this album, but the forewarning and versatile parts to it make it such a unique track.\n\nUnfortunately, \"Stained Class\" isn't quite so flawless across the board. \"Heroes End\" just never did it to me. Nothing in this song knows what it's trying to go for in my opinion. The riff tries to be a darker and more threatening one, but the two 'halves' of the notes playing that make it up don't gel with each other. I feel it's two half-riffs smashed together instead of a fleshed out one. Along with that, Halford's verse melodies are almost too 'clean' to fit with it too. He is singing in such a traditionally bouncy way across this darker riff, and it makes him feel out of place. The band and Halford have two different moods that aren't fitting with each other remotely. The chorus riff is a bit better, but the chorus vocals are pretty forgettable to me. \"Heroes End\" is confused and never gets off the ground. The title track also leaves a lot to be desired. The chorus is pretty memorable, but the verses are mediocre. The riffs have a very weak gallop that has a bite to them that gets your hopes up, but doesn't progress all that much. Halford's notes are on point, but he never reaches a satisfying conclusion. There's a bit of irony to me that, while not a terrible song, the title track might be the most forgettable across the whole record. Certainly nothing about \"Stained Class\" is horrible or irredeemable, but the low points are certainly there.\n\n\"Stained Class\" is a Judas Priest highlight, but I wouldn't quite call it their magnum opus. They still had one more album from the 70's to deliver, but it's no secret that this one is as good as it gets. Another reason I think \"Stained Class\" has such a great reputation is due to how raw it is. It's just an album chock full of no frills and well written metal songs. The production is crisp and clear, and there are no bells and whistles like sound effects or keyboards to distract from the playing. For the purists out there, an album that is so masterfully made at a basic level without anything to disguise or distract is very alluring. In any case, if you remotely enjoy Judas Priest, \"Stained Class\" is a must have. There aren't many albums out there that attain what the record is trying to attain better.\n",
        "\nJudas Priest just kept one upping themselves album after album from the start of their career, and this was a trend that would continue for another few releases. Indeed, their third album \"Sin After Sin\" is absolutely an improvement in every regard to \"Sad Wings of Destiny.\" The songwriting is more consistent and has more depth and variety to it. Even the next revolution of drummers was a massive step up. Simon Phillips, who was only a session drummer for this release, is a very, very good drummer. He's worlds better than their previous two, so this is the first time Priest had a drummer that was something of a match in skill to the rest of the band. I think Phillips may be my favorite Priest drummer, but it's a bit hard to say that because he didn't have the longevity that's needed to make that kind of claim. Phillips has a lot of subtle and very hard hitting playing that is a really great fit for \"Sin After Sin.'\n\n\"Starbreaker\" is such a perfect example of what he brings to the table. It also happens to be my favorite track on the record. He starts the song with a very powerful and infectious groove. His snare sound is so punchy, and his tactful use of ghost notes helps give \"Starbreaker\" a real flare and an extra layer of complexity. The track's main riff plays perfectly off that groove, too. It might not be the best Priest riff they've ever belted out, but there's something very infectious and catchy about it. It flows perfectly to the chorus riff too. The whole track is smooth across the board. The solo is electric, and Halford's increasingly high notes at the end help it end on well...a high note. I, along with many others, also find the closer \"Dissident Aggressor\" to be very, very heavy for this era of Judas Priest. Halford's opening high note is just as good as \"Victim of Changes.\" Phillip's double bass drumming and grooving patterns makes the song have the aggressive stomping destructive energy it needed. The guitar work is just utterly pissed off, and Halford compliments it by letting it all hang loose. Both his aggressive side and legendary high notes are on full display.\n\n\"Raw Deal\" is another track off \"Sin After Sin\" that I really point to a lot. It's not even a personal favorite track for me, but the musical storytelling is really fantastic on it. Musically, the band is hitting notes and laying down an atmosphere fitting of the story they're telling. This is another track where, even without lyrics, you get a very guarded and defensive feel from just the instruments. This kind of fittingly atmospheric playing was what I feel \"Sad Wings of Destiny\" was lacking so much of besides on \"The Ripper.\" Halford is really selling the song with his melodies, too. From quicker paced verses to slower, deliberate high points, he too is hitting the mood the track goes for. The title track is another highlight, but it took quite a few spins of this record for it to really sit right with me. I don't think the verses are spectacular either vocally or instrumentally, but the track has a really infectious build to it. The pre chorus just revs the engines and gets the listener built up for a catchy and hard hitting chorus. The solo is also absolute staple Judas Priest. It's a solo that's good enough by itself, so it really keeps the song interesting and moving.\n\nThe one real harsh blow on this record is \"Last Rose of Summer.\" The guitars are very pretty and the bass work is smooth. Halford is also as good as ever. Much like \"Epitaph\" on the previous album, though, this song is just stylistically unfitting for the album. It's a track that comes out of left field and once again leaves me tilting my head asking myself why the song came and killed the flow the album was building on. It is almost head-smashingly repetitive. You will be BEGGING for \"Last Rose of Summer\" to just fade out half way through. Almost half the track is just pure repetition. It's painful. I also have a bit of a love-hate relationship with \"Call for the Priest.\" It has a fun and heavy frantic nature to it that hits hard, and I absolutely adore the insanely melodic solo that hits before Halford soars over it. But that section only happens once! That should have ABSOLUTELY been the chorus melody of the song, but it just kind of works itself in and slides out just as it really started to build and become amazing. I find \"Call for the Priest\" just a little bit stale and JUST lacking in something to become incredible. Every time I listen to \"Sin After Sin\" I get to \"Call for the Priest\" and want to love it. Instead, I just often being a little bit let down that it's missing that one little it factor it desperately needed.\n\nI said before that each decade of Judas Priest has one legendary album and one very good record amongst everything else. \"Sin After Sin\" is the 'very good' album of 70's Judas Priest. It's the first album in their catalog that I really feel entirely satisfied with when the record finally ends. This is the release where it really started to click. The songwriting got tighter on this album, the band seems more comfortable in their identity here than the two previous records, and the addition of a decent drummer really made a huge difference too. \"Rocka Rolla\" was just an album, \"Sad Wings of Destiny\" was an iconic but short-sighted second attempt, and the third time was the charm with \"Sin After Sin.\" In my opinion, it was with the release of THIS album that the band finally became the Judas Priest we love.\n",
        "\nThis is another review I really dreaded getting to. I know the high esteem that Priest's second album \"Sad Wings of Destiny\" is held in, but I just can't agree with common praise of this album. I honestly only think this release is marginally better than \"Rocka Rolla\" was. That certainly doesn't make it a bad album by any stretch, but...I'll have to take a pass at the claim that this is one of the greatest metal albums of all time. Hell, I don't even think it's in the ballpark of the best 70's Priest album! There are at least two that are head and shoulders better in my opinion. As far as lineups go, the revolving door of drummers Priest started their career with made its first turn, giving us Alan Moore on drums, who is slightly more competent than his predecessor, but still not someone to make a splash.\n\nThe one thing about this album that is clear as crystal and really sets it apart from \"Rocka Rolla\" is that this record is undeniably the one where Priest started to build their true identity. Where \"Rocka Rolla\" could have been a one off 70's album done by almost anyone, \"Sad Wings of Destiny\" is an album that could have only been pulled off by Judas Priest. The signature guitar playing, both in terms of solos and riffs really took shape here, and Halford is letting the high notes of his voice fly here, which was very reserved in the debut. I think another reason this album gets such high praise is because where \"Rocka Rolla\" was a rock album, \"Sad Wings of Destiny\" is definitely a metal album through and through. This being a rather early album in the birth of the genre means that a lot of roads lead back here, which is definitely something to be commended.\n\nBut truth be told, the only tracks that I really think are worth holding up here are the two that are most often cited. \"The Ripper\" is the best song on the album by far, and one of Priest's all time best. \"The Ripper\" has EVERYTHING you could want in Judas Priest. It has amazing riffs, killer solos, mind-blowing vocals, and an overall spooky atmosphere to it that makes it extremely fitting for the subject they wrote about. There's not one second during \"The Ripper\" where it lets up. It is a constant barrage of awesomeness. In fact, I often wish it was a bit longer! There are few songs that just give you everything as much as \"The Ripper.\" \"Victim of Changes\" is the other track that is always pointed to and, while I definitely really enjoy the song, it doesn't nearly hit me as hard as it does others. We've all marveled at Halford's high note at the end of the song, and that cannot be understated. The song is almost worth the price of admission for that alone. I think what loses me a bit on \"Victim of Changes\" is that every riff is a derivative of the opening riff. Each time the riff changes, even during the slower atmospheric section in the middle, it's just a slight variation. For an eight minute track, it kind of gets tiring to me that every riff I'm hearing is so similar. The song BEGS for a little bit more variety to it. But that might be my slight over analyzation. I enjoy \"Victim of Changes.\" It's a very good track. I just don't think it's THAT good.\n\nThe only other track I come back to off \"Sad Wings of Destiny\" with any kind of frequency at all is the closer \"Island of Domination.\" While I wouldn't call it a Judas Priest standout in their entire career, Halford has a fantastic flow and groove to fit the riff. It has a gallop and bounce to it that is undeniably fun along with a catchy chorus. The band is having such a blast that it's hard to not have fun listening to this song too. Like much on this album, I just feel the song could have used a bit more substance and variety to it to really hit harder. \"Epitaph\" which is kind of a lead in to \"Island of Domination\" is also a bit of a head scratcher for me. Halford's voice is absolutely beautiful on it. His range and true skills as a singer are on full display. However...the song sounds like an old school crooner ballad. It has no substance beyond Halford's range and is almost uncomfortably unfitting. It really has no place on the record. It's just so different in so many ways to literally every other moment of \"Sad Wings\" runtime that it's jarring.\n\nThe rest of side two of the record isn't really anything to write home about either. Both \"Tyrant\" and \"Genocide\" are pretty mediocre Priest tracks. \"Tyrant\" has a cool bass-heavy groove and an absolutely electric solo, but that's where the compliments end for me. The verse melodies are a jumbled mess. There are several times where Halford is almost struggling to fit the lyrics into the melody. It's an utterly thoughtless melody. The chorus itself is equally lacking. A rather bored backing call of \"tyrant\" rings out in almost a yawn from Halford, and the rest of the chorus is very flat. It's not low enough to be threatening, nor is it sung with enough soaring energy to cut above it. It's just a flat track that should be better than it is. \"Genocide\" is pretty much the definition of a Judas Priest filler track. An okay-at-best riff is laid down and Halford just kind of calls over it. If that wasn't enough, the song never goes anywhere. It's another song with zero substance or depth. A song with such little progression or substance to it shouldn't be nearing the six minute mark. If this song was \"Ripper\" length, I think it'd have been salvageable. As is, \"Genocide\" is probably the biggest waste of space on the entire album.\n\n\"Sad Wings of Destiny\" is a solid release. It is also a massively influential and important album to both Judas Priest's history and the history of the genre. But I always found that when you really peeled back the layers and bravado presented by \"Sad Wings of Destiny,\" you find an album that is still very much confused. The record has very clear growing pains and there is an equally small amount of consistency in quality or songwriting throughout it. The album ends up spitting up a couple of gems from an otherwise bloated body. What might be the biggest deathblow is hindsight. Only one year later, Priest's next release would pretty much make \"Sad Wings of Destiny\" obsolete. You'll find much worse in Judas Priest's catalog than \"Sad Wings of Destiny.\" Unfortunately for it, though, you'll also find much, much better too.\n",
        "\nJudas Priest is another band that I need to give absolutely no introduction to. If you're currently looking at this review, or even looking at this website, you more than likely know Judas Priest (or should be here to rectify that immediately if you're one of the few that don't!) Halford, Tipton, Downing, and Hill's first effort ended up with \"Rocka Rolla.\" Priest has always had a revolving door of drummers for most of their career, and John Hinch got the honors for the debut. Like most bands, Judas Priest didn't start out with a legendary release. They still had a lot of growing to do before they'd hit the status we all know and love them at as now. I am also one of the people that are of the opinion that \"Rocka Rolla\" was a fine debut, but really nothing remotely special.\n\nWithout having the foresight in knowing what Judas Priest would go on to become, if you listen to \"Rocka Rolla\" by itself, you could very easily think this was just another album by some random one and done band from the 70's. While it's a solidly enjoyable album, there's very little uniquely Priest or defining about it. I actually think the title track is quite a bit of fun. The riffing is pretty weak, and I wouldn't call the verse melodies some of Halford's best, but Hill's bass work has a lot of energy, and the chorus is electric. It's got that 'classic rock' style catchiness to it that just does not leave your head. One listen, and it's in your head for the rest of the day. The following solo is just as memorable. Best of all, it doesn't overstay its welcome. \"One for the Road\" is the other track that I find myself coming back to. Halford shows off some of his signature high notes that he'd only improve on later. It's a song that has the framework of what would be signature 70's Priest. Halford's notes, and the smooth, detailed, memorable guitar parts. The verse melodies are more memorable than the chorus is. Halford is grooving perfectly with the guitars, and it shows what a tight band Priest was. Even at this point, they were tight musicians, even if the track itself isn't much better than average.\n\nHowever, for every decent track \"Rocka Rolla\" might have to it, it has a \"Run of the Mill.\" \"Run of the Mill\" gets going with rather pretty guitar parts which Halford is a perfect fit over. It gives you the false impression that the song is going to be an epic that's really going to be building on itself. But the heavier parts are almost random. They're very disjointed and just sound juvenile. The tightness I just bragged about Priest having above is definitely not there for the heavier sections of \"Run of the Mill.\" The track has no business being the length it is, either. While the song will go on to add some small bits of energy and progression, the very foundation of it remains the same throughout. There's no build where there should be. It's just a pretty bluesy rock track that shows no clear purpose. \"Never Satisfied\" is another extremely dull offering. The riffs across it have the sad combination of not being very good but also being quite repetitive. Halford's melodies match the repetition, so when your few note melodies are repetitive, it really shows. The solo section has a slightly odd time signature, but it's another example of 'just because you can, doesn't mean you should.' It comes off as pretty random and unimpressive yet again. John Hinch, who throughout this album is generally a competent drummer for what it's going for, is lost during this section. Instead of doing a cool fill or pattern like another drummer might, he just hits each tom twice in order. It's drumming as rudimentary as it gets in a section that is supposed to show some chops from the band.\n\nWhile \"Dying to Meet You\" is also far from a stellar track as well, it has a memorable riff, and Halford is using his much lower register on the song which he'd do much less of later in his career. It's really cool to hear him showcasing the other side of his voice than he is known for. \"Dying to Meet You\" would have been a much better track if the band had wrote it after they had a bit more experience. I think if this song came even a few albums later when Priest would have had at least a bit more experience in polishing their songwriting, this would have been a really memorable track from their first decade. The fact that the end of the song changes tempos and gets a little heavier shows that Priest knew the concept of good songwriting, but just didn't have the experience to execute it. Instead, \"Dying to Meet You\" leaves us with another okay-at-best experience that has the seeds of something great but can't hit the mark.\n\nOne of my favorite things about Judas Priest is that they almost reinvent themselves every decade. 70's Priest, 80's Priest, and 90's-Present Priest all sound extremely different, and it's not uncommon to find fans of the band that might just like one of these eras. Or might like one or two but not the third. For me, each era has both one phenomenal album, and one that's pretty good while the rest are kind of just there. \"Rocka Rolla\" is in the later half for 70's Priest. There's not much to hate about it, there's not much to really sink your teeth into, it's just kind of there. If you're a big fan of 70's style rock, or are a big Priest fan, there's definitely enough going on with \"Rocka Rolla\" to give it a spin, but I can't see all that many people wanting to come back with much frequency. Priest was here; now they just needed to make a splash.\n",
        "\nJudas Priest are, in a nutshell, a chameleon. The one fact you can consistently rely on, ironically, is the band redefining the meaning of inconsistency. Never wanting to repeat themselves or become stale in an overloaded scene they inspired, they did what every successful musical institution does; they evolved. Anyone fortunate enough to grow up as a fan of Priest while in their heyday can attest to the band being ridiculously hard to love everything offered. Everyone is free to dislike any song they choose but beginning with this album, accusing a song by Judas Priest of not sounding like Judas Priest is an exercise in missing the point.\n\nSome bands prefer being the metal equivalent of an AC/DC but Priest prefers to have a core structure and then build onto it by observing whatever is popular at the time. One could make the case Judas Priest are the most plagiarizing band in metal since they have spent every album since Killing Machine mimicking the trends of whatever era one points to. No musical act could have a stranglehold on their genre for as long as Judas Priest have without being incredibly daring. It is why they chose to followup their chart topping comeback album Angel Of Retribution with an album that sounds like nothing they had done in their previous 39 years with Nostradamus.\n\nSo what does the above point have to do with this here third album? Well that point started on Sin After Sin; it is one vast album and its eclectic proportions make it my second favorite of the \u201870s albums. The band had already verified their songwriting abilities on the previous effort and that growth, combined with proof of their commitment to the cause, prompted CBS to come in and rescue the band from obscurity. Bit shocking to realize the world was mere days from Sad Wings Of Destiny being the last piece of music a band named Judas Priest ever released. So how did a band just mere days from the grave get here? The first step was obviously CBS Records; they were a proper record label, with financial security and clout, but beyond just signing the band they also teamed them with Roger Glover and gave them carte blanche to record what they wanted. It was time to show the entire world who the band was.\n\nIt is important to note that each member came from diverse backgrounds musically and culturally; with equal input from core members of such variety, the compositions would seem to be destined for a mess of an album. What was produced instead was an in-cohesive but strong case of songwriting maturation. What exactly made did this happen? One could point to the better studios, financial security, better production team but it was really Roger Glover, for it was he that introduced the band to one of its most important members, the double bass percussionist.\n\nWhen Simon Philips entered the studio no one knew that the future of metal was being germinated. Philips was 19 at the time but already a Jazz trained percussion extraordinaire so his use of those techniques on this record set it apart in a fantastic way. He had very little rehearsal time with the band and never wrote any part of the album. The band, like CBS had with them, let Phillips be unrestricted and play on intuitive impetus, further cementing the point that this his performance would be tinged with Jazz. Some of the albums strongest moments are supported by Philips\u2019s intricate musical fills, something he would become synonymous for throughout his career. An identifiable mark as rich as his three snare drums.\n\nIt is ironic that most of the speed and energy this album bleeds comes from Philips\u2019 and Hill\u2019s Jazz training. Ian Hill\u2019s father played the double bass in a traveling Jazz unit during the early \u201860s, and its influence is felt on this album more than any other Priest effort. Due to great production from a fellow bassist, Hill gets to shine on this album more than any other until the years with Ripper Owens. More than just a no-frills timekeeper for the guitars he lets loose some very slick bass runs that are imaginative and cut through at just the right times the dense heaviness of the guitars. And speaking of those guitars. The razor sharp growth of Downing and Tipton individually and collectively, they focus on intricate chord progressions that opened up an infinite range of possibilities for fast lead playing.\n\nAn excellent example of this is with the albums centerpiece, Let Us Prey/Call For the Priest. This was a concept the band had already attempted twice before - marrying two diametrically opposed songs into one - but while the attempt on Rocka Rolla (Dying To Meet You/Hero, Hero) was soulless, attempt on Sad Wings (Epitaph/Island Of Domination) was barely-metallic, both compositions were connected lyrically. Here the two songs are polar opposites both musically and lyrically. The composition might begin soothingly with a church organ but once the track kicks in, fittingly with a Simon Phillips drum roll, it becomes a manic assembly of breakneck riffs, breakdowns, interludes that never stray from a 254 bpm tempo. All spearheaded by Simon who adds spectacular color to the thundering bottom end by making cymbals and toms ring in unison as only he can, forging a style that makes this stand above any other song preceding its release that could claim it was speed metal before this.\n\nLike every Priest album there are the very strong metallic moments and besides Call For the Priest there is the opening(Sinner) and closing(Dissident Aggressor) tracks. Both can be seen as the perfect accretion of all the ideas that would come to characterize power and thrash metal respectively. So while this album is overlooked from their \u201870s output, Sin After Sin can legitimately boast that it contains, arguably, the first ever power, speed & thrash metal songs. Diamonds And Rust, Starbreaker and Raw Deal round out the rest of the \u2018metal\u2019 songs and not only are these three songs far too pop oriented to sound like the snarling beasts of rage they were live, all three lack a great deal of metallic instrumentation. The fact that this album has so many non metallic moments might be the biggest reason for it being overshadowed but the two ballads really extend this concept.\n\nI would like to say a few words about the ballads on this album. Every Priest album has some mellow songs without a bunch of distortion, so it is not unusual that this album has two (three if you count Let Us Prey). These ballads are rather amusing because they show Halford really emulating his contemporaries. In the initial section of the uneven Here Come the Tears, Rob sounds dead ringer to Eddie Money while the music has a very Spectres-era Blue Oyster Cult vibe to it. During Last Rose Of Summer, particularly during its climax, Rob sounds like he was temporary replaced by Robert Plant.\n\nSpeaking of Last Rose Of Summer, this is my absolute favorite song on the album and my second favorite ballad the band has ever written. It is a completely non metal composition that sounds lifted from a Gordon Lightfoot or Dan Fogelberg catalogue. Because the song has no tenacity or tension it is easy to see why people find it as a cement block that breaks the albums consistency, but if one can accept that this is who Judas Priest are, it becomes easier to recognize why this song appears. I could repeat how Priest made these odd decisions deliberately, but would rather point out how veracious and tactically expressive the guitar-work is on this track. That intricate guitar interplay between Downing & Tipton, who doubles on splendid keyboard arrangements, preternatural vocals by Halford, elaborate but judicious bass work by Hill and Jazz augmented brush percussion by Philips - thus utilizing the skills of each member to their complete zenith - creates perhaps the biggest conversation piece of the bands historic career... The same five men that lent the definitive artistic statements for the future of metal, willingly wrote a complex arrangement befitting contemporary Folk artists. This was not a halfhearted attempt to gain cult status among Folk music fans, I doubt any Joni Mitchell fans became fans of metal as a result of Last Rose, instead it was intentional. The band wanted to show not only that they were capable of performing such a feat but, more importantly, they wanted to show their brand and identity had room for Folk as it did metal. They would eventually become a monolith where the band has sampled more genres both within and outside of metal than any other band in the broad and proud history of metal in general.\n\nThis was the first time Priest\u2019s lone identifier was first revealed. Whereas most say Sad Wings of Destiny was the true start for Judas Priest, that distinction goes to Sin After Sin. They may have identified themselves with the previous effort, but this is where they established their one and only constant, ironic as it is, which was to never be constant. They were never the band to just release ten versions of the same song to fill out an album, a la Painkiller, they were a band who would deliberately sabotage their own efforts by thinking it could work to add in truly bizarre head scratching moments in the middle of their album. If you can handle a deliberate inconsistent tone then you will find yourself thoroughly enjoying all the many, MANY, eclectic styles this masterful album contains.\n\nHighlights: Last Rose of Summer, Dissident Aggressor, Call For the Priest & Sinner.\n",
        "\nDescribed by my good friend as \u201cRush\u2019s debut album with winter depression,\u201d the legend-status band Judas Priest has a debut that\u2019s also fun to look back on in comparison to everything they\u2019ve done in the nearly 50-year timespan. As most know now, Rocka Rolla was the cold foundation built on bluesy/doomy hooks, working well beside their counterparts of the time. Somewhat an inconsistent release, it manages to find charm in the vague direction. But sidestepping the obvious, there\u2019s plenty to dig up.\n\nFor a band never known for being huge on suspense, Rob Halford and co. certainly hid plenty of it here. The entire disc can be summarized by working as a plethora of gazy and dreary scapes of noodling that work up to a release, oftentimes being catchy. Most notably, we\u2019re looking at the \u201cWinter / Deep Freeze / Retreat\u201d trilogy that invokes confusion and dysphoria through unsettling noise, and softer licks. This works wonderfully breaking into the famous proto-metal banger \u201cCheater.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, the back half of this doesn\u2019t swing this style in a way that leaves quite as strong an impression. Executed almost identically, it deals in bleak passages combined with hard riff surprises, and clean licks. A fun trip, especially when we hit that break on \u201cDying To Meet You,\u201d or the Stranglehold-esque vibes in \u201cNever Satisfied\u201d before that song even existed; it just feels overshadowed by the front. There\u2019s also the bias factor of the stacking against the opening one-two punch, arguably the strongest standalone tracks. They have to count for something.\n\nWeird progression and inconsistency aside, there\u2019s so much to get out of Rocka Rolla that I find myself returning often; especially in these colder times. The strong moments are incredible, the weak moments are forgivable, and the experience as a whole is desirable.\n",
        "\nIn 1980 Judas Priest released British Steel. Its wonderful cover, by Rozslav Szyabo, was a faithful preview of what was between the cover arts. Fingers were holding a blade that wasn't cutting, as heavy metal wasn't harmful in that critical album of its social, political art supporting the multitude of workers who were fired by the British Steel company in those moments of liberal Thatcher reforms.\n\nWith no doubt, Tom Allom produced it in an outstanding way, and the album changed everything as it would define the genre at their best ending off the last vestiges of blues. So Allom did it without falling into the commerciality blunder he has been erroneously blamed. British Steel is as hard or heaviest as anything this band had ever produced, and offers an impressive display of what heavy metal was at that time, as well as providing an insightful vision of what they were going to become. This one faithfully captures the moment when heavy metal was beginning to attract the attention of the masses but hadn't fallen yet into commercialism.\n\nJudas Priest's sixth studio album alternated glorious hymns that were going to define with faster, more intense themes surrounding mythological, dark lyrics closer to speed metal that would witness the soon birth of thrash metal. \"British Steel\" is a really varied mix that encompassed everything that made Judas Priest an accessible and even horny band. These guys wouldn't remove the heavy feeling in their sound as they would do years later. Brutal assault of killer guitars, dizzying tempos and angry vocals do personify all in the same way they did with leathers, chains, studs and boots, aesthetically speaking.\n\nK.K. Downing and Glenn Tipton take another step forward with their brutal, aggressive dual guitar work. The devastating melodies by those twelve strings became the emblematic band's sound. Rob Halford is as angry as ever, truly one of the best and most characteristic voices in metal. Ian Hill's bass and Dave Holland's drums, in their debut with Judas Priest they were surely the weakest ones of the quintet, although their performance on \u201cBritish Steel\u201d is way worthy and places them above average.\n\nBritish Steel is truly one of their best works, a mythical album of the British heavy metal scene in the early 80s, one of the most respected and influential albums, recognizable by the vast majority of fans due to its magnificent cover.\n",
        "\nKilling Machine has some notable differences respecting the predecessor one as the lyrics tend to be simpler and more direct, in the style of Rocka Rolla and on the other hand, Halford moves away from so many high-pitched tones compared to Stained Class. Now, in keeping with a darker and denser overall atmosphere, Rob's throat shakes like keeper's chains offering more seasoned, dirtier records in keeping with an insisting distortion production.\n\n\"Delivering The Goods\" flags up an omnipresent guitar, not only because of the high-pitched riffs at the beginning but also for the endless galactic dotted, which gives way to a quasi-stopped tempo between instruments at the end when the chorus explodes thanks to Rob's scream. \"Rock Forever\" is fresher and lighter, perhaps it lacks altogether but it's a more punchy number, the one that will come in the 80s as it's still covered with a blazing guitar layer. This lack of forcefulness comes to the fore in \"Evening Star\", which has its moments and the chorus is a bit kindergarten playground-like by today's standards.\n\nHell Bent For Leather is pure heavy metal signed up by Tipton with a steady beat and a super catchy brutal bass line. Take On The World highlights its depth with those rhythms that rivet your steel soul as the choruses come up as pure elixir. Burnin 'Up comes out of nowhere and immediately engulfs you, squeezes you and knocks down Rob's intimidating setting. Title track Killing Machine is catchy and has a mysterious sound where the axes rapport themselves to sharing the chords.\n\nHow does Rob's voice convey the lyrics and passion? Running Wild transmits magic and good vibes, one of the most proto-heavy songs for the rhythm and instrumental ideas at that time. Before The Dawn is the \u201cperpetual\u201d acoustic ballad made for our vocalist to show off. This album ends with dignity with Evil Fantasies, which highlights the huge drumming as the guitars disperse chords in a slow tempo like few others.\n\nYou can smell the atmosphere the 80s shows off on here. Killing Machine is the natural evolution of a band looking for glory. Like any album by these British musicians, this one was also important in its own way, being in Judas' career an interesting episode of high voltage, rawness and shadow of their own dose, with the occasional famous bomb (Delivering The Goods, Hell Bent For Leather, Running Wild) and memorable moments of emotion (Before The Dawn, the Evening Star and Burnin 'Up), without forgetting the brief commercial numbers (Evening Star and Take On The World) contrasted with the caustic essence of an intimate vintage where Hard Rock was devilish (Killing Machine, Evil Fantasies). In the visual and cultural component, let's not forget the historical importance that this album brings with the birth of the leather age in metal.\n",
        "\nPainkiller \u2013 the album so good, it nearly ended Judas Priest. Well, that, and the 90s happened. Either way, it\u2019s a terrific album that they couldn\u2019t possibly follow up without either disappointing the fans, changing their sound entirely (which still just about evokes the former but not as harshly), or performing some real voodoo black magic shit. Well, let\u2019s put it this way. Is it Painkiller? Ooh\u2026 \u201cyes\u201d with an \u201cif\u201d; \u201cno\u201d with a \u201cbut\u201d. Is it a good album? Ehh, almost. Basically, the 80s sounding speed metal stands tall as some bonafide fun, fun songs while the more blatantly 90s groove metal was an investment with no dividends and significantly declining returns.\n\nBut boy fuckin\u2019 howdy, does this album start off with aplomb! \u201cJugulator\u201d riding off that \u201cPainkiller\u201d energy as KK Downing and Tipton riff like their arms are sewing machines while Scott Travis lights up the night with some mad percussion. Ripper Owens makes a hell of an impression with his commanding range and all American charm. He hits them highs like no one\u2019s business and those middish highs drive the song with rigorous force. Similarly, the riffs muscle through with either gale force speed metal riffing or a more chunky mid-paced affectation.\n\n\u201cBlood Stained\u201d and \u201cBurn in Hell\u201d have a lot of force behind the riffs and the choruses \u2013 catchy in their approach \u2013 strike their melodious might into your mind. Even then, it is ultimately the speedier cuts that win out in the end. Just some deliciously dynamic, energetic cuts of Painkiller-esque speed metal with a ton of vigor. \u201cJugulator\u201d builds up to its manic chorus with gusto while \u201cDeath Row\u201d pounds the listener with some real machine gun riffing, and \u201cBullet Train\u201d\u2026 well, riffs like one. There\u2019s hardly any way to go wrong with the more bombastic speeding locomotive that was Painkiller, and Jugulator maintains that spirit quite well in those speedier hits (plus \u201cDead Meat\u201d). Even then, one of the major highlights is actually a bit of a slower cut in \u201cCathedral Spires\u201d, with a composition being bigger than a cathedral spire. Then again, it\u2019s got that real sense of finality \u2013 the calm before the anthemic riffing, concluding with a reprise \u2013 and it\u2019s got all the tenants of the other tracks discussed thus far amped up to eleven.\n\nSounds like a terrific comeback album, doesn\u2019t it? But then what in the H-E Double Hockey Sticks is shit like \u201cDecapitate\u201d? You get this groove that drags its feet and does absolutely nothing to work. No push, no drive, no pulse \u2013 nothing! Travis Scott and Ripper Owens, the poor souls, are desperately trying to figure out how to put some energy into it. Goddamn, \u201cBrain Dead\u201d definitely lives up to its name, doing the same thing. \u201cAbductors\u201d \u2013 like, if you squint at it real hard \u2013 kinda picks up about halfway through with a little bit of kick after a meandering groove\u2026 before going back to exactly that meandering groove! Having the latter two one after the other definitely doesn\u2019t do any favors to anybody. This weak ass, go-nowhere groove shit makes KK Downing\u2019s upcoming solo album sound like fucking Sad Wings of Destiny! Korn and Pantera made this look easy.\n\nNot too keen on a lot of the extended intros because they don\u2019t really drum up an awful lot of atmosphere (and \u201cBurn in Hell\u201ds intro could definitely use a trim at any rate), and the solos are definitely the worst in Priest\u2019s career. They tend to meander about, barely even existing outside of about three seconds of Painkiller-esque soloing in \u201cDeath Row\u201d \u2013 even then, they are all ruined by having some real comically distorted production on them. Still, when Jugulator\u2019s on, it\u2019s on! Perhaps the gap between Painkiller and Jugulator worked out for the band as they manage to pen tip top joints like \u201cDeath Row\u201d, \u201cBullet Train\u201d and the monolithic \u201cCathedral Spires\u201d. But then \u201cDecapitate\u201d pops on and, yeah, this definitely only comes as a recommended trek to the past with a hefty asterisk.\n",
        "\nStained Class is the favorite album of many priestlovers, and is considered as the album that reinvented heavy metal. They also claim is their darkest album and was a bold leap in metal music back then. I'm also a Judasboy, however, I always say that the quality of songs varies too much on this record. Stained Class presents great stuff but also features songs that are kinda out of place. People tell you that \u201cSSS\u201d (Sad Wings-Sin After-Stained) is the quintessence of Judas Priest's music, yet the only true magnum opus is Sad Wings of Destiny, because this album features entirely Priest material with no covers or bland songs like Sin After Sin (Last Rose, Diamonds) and Stained Class (BBYBTM). The lack of consistency becomes an extra value, precisely coming from the concern to experiment and mix up many styles that star it out. Thus, their cover letter \"Exciter\" acquires a more logical meaning, and although it shows the forcefulness and originality that'll distinguish their music, few ones still don't offer enough evidence and approximations of it. Well, let's break down this funny though overrated album.\n\nLet's start with the bad first. Only thing I don't like is the cover of Spooky Tooth, a poppy song that, far from adding, gets in the way. It feels so out of place and every time I listen to this album I have to hit \u201cskip\u201d to avoid it, something that also happens with Peace Sells' I Ain\u2019t Superstitious and Persecution Mania's Iron Fist; you know, is that \"kind\" of album. They supposedly released this cover because they needed a radio single but many metalheads ignore that this album has several AOR elements that are brilliantly camouflaged in the songwriting. \u201cInvader\u201d is another poppy radio-oriented that has the high potential to be the single (not to mention the simpleton Hawaiian style that surrounds its solo). This album doesn't really need a cover song to promote itself. \"Savage\" is a bit cheesy and boring though it\u2019s saved by the solo and all the little guitar ornaments that decorate it; this song even repeats the same vocal lines twice and the riffage actually has a very glamorous style. These kinds of tracks don't have the amazing dynamics of the other ones.\n\nRegarding musicians, the guitarists work fine despite the weak production (softness sound, they'd say). Halford is at 75% of his power since he doesn't convince a bit, hell, he has such annoying performances and at times I'd rather prefer his falsetto opening on \u201cAll Guns Blazing\u201d more than these. An example of Halford trying too hard is this line:\n\nTransfixed at deliverance, is this all there is?\nFaithless continuum, into the abyss.\nFierce is my conviction, absolute my belief.\nI spit at you apathy and seducer deceit\n\nThat's the part of the title track where he sounds quite annoying, but then redeems himself in \u201cLong ago when man was King...\u201d where he looks more serene. Another annoying line is the one of \"White Heat Red Hot\" (02:49) with that strange and unnecessary effect, where Halford sounds the same or worse than a horde of cicadas at mating season:\n\nThe heat's hot burns a lot.\nWho are not cut out to fight this day will surely fall.\nThe few who stand to take command forever and ever are men.\n\nI'm surprised when people think Stained Class is underrated, I rather feel it's overrated by fans and critics alike, overshadowing Sin After Sin and Killing Machine in the mind of most listeners. Another thing that bothers me is when they say it\u2019s a prototype of thrash metal, as Sin After Sin is the most appropriate reference for its crunchy, rough sound. In Stained Class the guitars sound a bit thinny respecting their two previous deliveries; also, the musical balance leans more towards early-Rush than thrash metal properly. Weak production takes away much of music's powerness, but when I listened to \"Saints in Hell\" in concert I admit it was such a revelation and proves that Halford is truly a monster, almost inhuman or from another planet.\n\nNow let's get to the good stuff. \"Exciter\", \"Beyond the Realms of Death\" and \"Heroes End\" are some of the best metal songs ever written. Here you realize that Tipton and Downing gave free rein to everything that occurred to them in form of art, as they cram all their endless skills which do them so particular, they actually didn't stingy it musically speaking. At least things continued to go well on \u201cWhite Heat, Red Hot\u201d with its seductive, elegant hard rock signature, while the title track is an addictive delicatessen that perfectly defines the effervescence and sparks that the band ignited on this album.\n\nOverall, each song doesn't follow a similar pattern and they\u2019re structurally different from each other, but it is far from being the ultimate masterpiece as many claims. Sad Wings of Destiny is an album that created more relaxing atmospheres, as also brutal ones; it offered a hot and cold climate, and a unique musical storm, showing the best of Judas Priest ever. That's why there's a lot of talk about British Steel, Screaming for Vengeance, Defenders of the Faith, Painkiller... and very little is said about this Stained Class, because it was a moment of electric ecstasy that could have been much better, but did serve as a harbinger of the musical direction they'd take in later years. Halford is a surprise as a vocalist among his generation of singers with whom I got an excellent impression, but on other albums he had provided more revealing, otherworldly lines than on this one.\n\nJudas Priest is a band that started to follow fashions since 1978: with Stained Class they joined heavy metal with the outfit change, with Point of Entry they were focused on the American market, with Turbo they joined the synth fever, with Jugulator they followed the trends of groove metal, with Demolition they followed the steps of nu metal bands (very fashionable in late 90s and early 2000s) and finally Nostradamus wanted to catch up with symphonic metal bands. In short, Stained Class is an anecdotal LP that would win whole without the expendable cover song. What it really brings to the discography, predictably, is the performance of the axes Tipton/Downing. In summary, 5 really innovative songs plus 3 normal songs and a cover, ruined by little few Halford\u2019s vocal lines yet he would impress us again in his next presentations. It's a good and essential pick, but not a perfect one.\n",
        "\nComing from this band, these guys have made epic passages of sublime darkness and elegance in their own way, yet this Nostradamus is far from emulating those years. On this album the orchestration and keyboards almost completely engulf electric guitars and the essence of heavy metal band is lost. If the production had been better it would create a better balance between solemnity and forcefulness. Just listen to Damnation And A Day by Cradle Of Filth, even if seems that it has nothing to do.\n\nRegarding compositional quality, this album looks like been composed in a hurried way, and we know that they're capable of making our hair stand on end effectively. Whether they're innovating or not, they never lost their stamp, be it the americanized Point Of Entry or the synthesized Turbo. Solos have already taken a formula/mania of just showing whip and quickness, but without the hint of feeling. Where are those painkiller-esque solos? Those moments of fierceness and melody; or those ones of Between The Hammer & The Anvil, Jawbreaker, The Sentinel, etc. If we talk about ballads, do you remember the solos that they used to do? Dreamer Deceiver, Beyond The Realms Of Death, A Touch Of Evil, Blood Red Skies, Cathedral Spires...\n\nMy disappointment couldn't be worse every time I listen to, but still think that they're capable of giving more. At least Halford knew how to limit himself by his age, not giving as much treble as before but moving us with his quality, feeling and versatility, something that he did achieve in Angel of Retribution and Firepower. This Nostradamus concept album hasn't left a very good impression on me, as at this point these guys had good ideas, but they were spoiled at the end of the day. The decent to good production barely manages to enhance the songwriting. As a major defect, I'd say that Halford is more restrained than usual, the years take their toll and despite his vocal technique is perfect, he misses his ability to rise up to infinity. Travis's drums aren't as imposing as we were used to on Angel of Retribution, and Tipton/Downing guitars are unmistakable, but they run at half gear. Ian Hill fulfills his eternal yet testimonial role on bass.\n\nThere are fans who wonder why there are uneducated people who always compare any record with Painkiller. I've read everything and people use to claim that each Judas Priest disc is unique and incomparably beautiful, simple, creative, powerful, dazzling, thunderous, innovative, warm, somber, worthy of a battle hymn. A friend of my friend discussed with me and called me \"mentally ill\" for mentioning Painkiller in every comparison. He told me Nostradamus is a truly remarkable work and another evolutionary step without a doubt, done by musicians of 50-60 years old and they supposedly deserve our absolute respect just for that. I did question the few heavy metal connotations but he replied that basically \"it's the Judas Sound, period\" to a greater or lesser degree, but after all, JUDAS SOUND.\n\nSometimes I think they manage to innovate with their modern sound while still sounding like Judas Priest, but in this case, I couldn't be more wrong. I remember when I got excited and bought this album at the time. I believed that time would take over to change my opinion but 13 years later, this didn't stand the test of time and fortunately they redeemed themselves with Firepower. At this point we fans don't want experiments or exotic ideas as this band had a bad background with glam metal. When I put an album from the metal gods I want to enjoy a good handful of songs, a good heavy metal album, and this is what Nostradamus lacks. Altogether it's a random album that sits safely somewhere between the commerciality (not the style, watch out) of Turbo, merged with opera rock (it was the trend I guess). If you're a fan of concept albums, I remind you that there are infinitely better works than this one. I think I'm going to listen to Operation Mindcrime now in order to get rid of this insipidity.\n",
        "\nCan Turbo live up to Sad Wings of Destiny, Stained Class, Screaming for Vengeance and all those classic Priest albums? Hell no. Does that mean it is a bad album? Well, also no actually.\n\nPriest's Turbo is an album I can enjoy in a 'Afterburner' (ZZ-Top) ) kind of way. Just don't think about anything else the band has done, especially way back in the seventies. Just listen to it as it is. In the case of both Turbo and Afterburner that would be an album with typical eighties electronic drums, added keyboards, sing-a-long chorusses and a few hardrock riffs and leads to spice it up for the normies.\n\nIt's very much pure eighties pop-rock. It's the kind you'd expect in some eighties coming-of-age or highschool movie with a few fast cars and scantily clad teenage girls thrown in, including that first kiss during a sunset. If you're in that mood, this album is exactly what you need. You think you can expect something else with titles like 'Wild Nights, Hot & Crazy Days' or 'Hot for Love'. Of course you don't!\n\nThe production? Well I personally bloody love it because it makes me go back to the second half of the eighties. To some that is 'dated' to me it is timetravel.\n\nBut even to me, not all songs are equally great. The first three songs ('Turbo Lover', 'Private Property' and especially 'Locked In') are just great fun songs! Only matched on the B-side of the album by 'Out in the Cold' and 'Reckless'. The rest of the song is okay-ish. 'Parental Guidance' could've come straight from any late-eighties Kiss album and if the title 'Rock You All Around the World' doesn't remind you of Status Quo already, the chorus will do so!\n\nEvery time I hear the first 30 seconds of 'Reckless' I imagine how cool this would've been in a movie. Even the chorus could fit so many fun movie scenes.\n\nSo you see, this album feels -to me- like the soundtrack of some eighties movie which was never made. If music can activate your fantasy and conjure up images, it is doing something right and therefor I cannot and will not discard Turbo. Can someone please make a fanmade video to 'Reckless' with a DeLorean, Phoebe Cates in bikini and Anthony Michael Hall puting on his sunglasses? That'd be great, thanks.\n\nIf Priest had released this under a different bandname, as a side-project, I'm sure slightly more people could've enjoyed it for the quirky fun rock album it actually is.\n",
        "\nWell, I don't really enjoy writing negative reviews, as I did on Point of Entry. I hope it's the last time I'll write about this band's bad quartet records (also Nostradamus and Turbo, which I haven't reviewed yet and probably won't even bother doing it). When I think of Judas Priest, I think of the soloing skills and sensitive lyrics from their first era, loaded with the doom, hard rock spirit; and also think when they began with those leather outfits and the bombastic riffs and solos. Can you imagine Judas Priest trying to sound like a mix of doom metal and nu metal? We've actually already seen this band treading those grounds in Jugulator, but in their previous offer there were at least decent songs as they were shining on their own, and the fire was still there. Tim Owens was never my favorite vocalist, but he somehow managed to fit his voice on Jugulator, so to avoid misunderstandings, my problem with this album is not the vocalist.\n\nBelieve me, I listen to this album many times, just to see what the hell is wrong with me, and with each listening my perception only gets worse and worse. Besides the four British references (Deep Purple, Black Sabbath and Iron Maiden), if there's something I like about this band is when they try to explore other musical fields. There are experiments that worked for them to a certain extent and the one I really like is Jugulator as they managed to create a convincing groove atmosphere that doesn't suck at all. However, on this album the instruments (especially guitars) sound sterile and soulless, considering that on Jugulator the Painkiller aura was still perceived and the solos sounded more extreme. In Demolition, even the solos seem to have no direction and at times, they're imperceptible.\n\nThe worst examples are \"One on One\" and \"Feed on Me\" which feature those annoying synth effects that lash you out with frenzy, followed by a solo even worse than Kirk Hammet's Wah effects. Another example of a faceless, directionless song is \u201cHell is Home\u201d which sounds very lame and without a clear structure, it simply limits offering a medium rhythm and a senseless acoustic interlude that doesn't contribute anything. \"Jekyll and Hyde\" barely has any kind of solo, and I listen to it again to check it out. The closer \u201cMetal Messiah\u201d seems like a disgusting mix of a random Limp Bizkit song and the catchy chorus of Manowar's Brothers of Metal. I could talk about others songs but to sum it up, there's nothing remotely resembling Cathedral Spires or Burn In Hell here, or anything melodically memorable. However, there are moments that lifted my spirits as the very brief solos on \"Close to You\" and \"Devil Digger\", or the only true heavy song \"Bloodsuckers\", but it doesn't compensate to save the situation.\n\nEvery song is slow, overloaded and insufferable. There are songs that aspire to be proto nu-metal power ballads, and make Slipknot's \u201cDead Memories\u201d sound like Painkiller compared to these abominations. Regarding lyrics, I have no complaints, as is public knowledge that their strength lies in music itself than the lyrics per se. In short, Demolition is a ticket to boredom and monotony, a trip to the absolute nadir. I don't very like Tim Owens but there was a reciprocity between him and the band, and somehow the musicians managed to fit Owens into Judas Priest without sounding insufferable on Jugulator. On this record, they renounce all that and risk waiting \"let's see what comes out of this\". Remember when I said that there are Judas Priest albums that have a twin brother? Ok, this is Jugulator's bad twin one and limbless. Horrible, disastrous, a waste of time.\n",
        "\nAn album that many fans consider expendable but it's earned a place in my collection. Ram It Down is nothing more than a prelude to what Painkiller would be in terms of sound, however, this album still retains those Turbo songwriting scraps because some songs were taken from the 1986 sessions. Anyone would believe that this album is inconsistent but I truly find a similarity with Defenders of the Faith since both albums present an extraordinary side A with hard headbanging songs, while the B side is more normal and relaxed with more singalong songs than anything, comparable to Heavy Duty, Some Heads Are Gonna Roll or Night Comes Down.\n\nConcerning musicianship, the protagonists are undoubtedly guitars and vocals. The bass and drums are not as audible as they may, as the autopilot effect can be noticed a bit, and much more noticeable in \u201cLove Zone\u201d. The two guitarists are in great shape and the title track's soloing is an example of being at the forefront of power metal, not the sense of the lethal technical shredding but the speed and rawness that it's handled with. Lyrically you find clich\u00e9d songs like \u201cHeavy Metal\u201d but that doesn't bother me at all because the musical content weighs more than you can believe, and this constant thing is solidly maintained throughout the album. The production is quite homogeneous, no song has any irregularity that makes out of tune along the rest, they're all connected; it's also solid and very polished, the guitar chorus resembles Screaming For Vengeance, although the drums seem like an intermediate return between Defenders and Turbo.\n\nSongwriting is very varied, fun, entertaining and spectacular. After those criticisms respect the band taking a glam sound on previous offering, I think they gave an aggressive response to their fans, just look at the lyrics of Heavy Metal and Come And Get It. There's a power ballad that clearly outlined as one of their magnificent works; the first two minutes of \u201cBlood Red Skies\u201d emanate a disciplined Halford that transports you to the choruses of Dreamer Deceiver, but instead of repeating the formula, this time they innovate with the secondary and moderate use of synthesizers and programmed drums that give it a sinister, futuristic air. Although this power ballad has a Turbo atmosphere, I still like it because the sound hits the mark and proves that Somewhere In Time is not the only album that can succeed with synthesizers. I'd wish this same sound on Turbo, but it would only break the tradition of presenting a totally different album respecting the previous one, and that's what they do best, contrary to AC/DC which know how to pre-fabricate perfect clones.\n\nThis album is very very very 1988, and while they didn't invent anything new at that time; the title track, Hard As Iron and Blood Red Skies are worth tons of pure gold. As much as people tell you that it's dated and \"only rocked in its moment\" and \"artificial drums made age it poorly\", this underrated disc deserves the same credit as overrated ones like British Steel. This album already gave signs of the way the band was taking, it's the embryo of Painkiller. Those contemporary critics who dare to call it one of their worst simply have no idea. If this is considered \"bad\", then where does Demolition belong?\n\nGolden highlights: Ram It Down, Heavy Metal, Come And Get It, Hard As Iron, Blood Red Skies, I'm A Rocker\n",
        "\nWhen it comes to debut albums, some are born with the gift of being legendary and others are no more than less transcendental, as they use to be overshadowed by their successor album. But what most obscure them is the critical perception as they unfairly vilified them. This has happened with Killing Is My Bussiness, Morbid Visions, Obsessed By Cruelty... and Rocka Rolla is no exception. You could say that each Judas Priest album is a different world, and there are \"twin\" albums which one really always stands out, therefore Rocka Rolla is the younger brother of \"Sad Wings of Destiny\" due to the rock music orientation it has. While this album offers everything you expect from a rock band from 1970s, their next stuff reinvents the wheel on a more masterful level. This album is really good and maybe my rating is too high for anyone who met these guys listening to British Steel or Screaming For Vengeance.\n\nIf you're a fan of the most innovative, hooker heavy metal, yeah, I recommend to listen this one when you're in a good mood. This album features many passages, preludes and interludes with bluesy touches, which would have less prominence on their next work. \"Run of the Mill\" justifies the whole album as it presents an astral halo with those organ effects which is succeeded by one of the best performances you can expect from Rob Halford. Rob's vocal lines here are more disciplined and flawless than on his 80s records. I actually divide this band (or rather Halford) into two stages: their first Rocka Rolla-Stained Class period, and their Killing Machine-Painkiller heyday period. Not even the second period can offer such an epic, astral journey as Run of the Mill, the one that One Shot At Glory can't even offer, without detracting this last one since it reached fields that the band had not explored until then.\n\nThis is more reminiscent of first Sabbath album, although the use of harmonicas are more discreet than in Sabbath's debut. Perhaps Rocka-Rolla has not yet defined the band's sound, but that doesn't make it a less worthy album. There are solos and riffs far more memorable than the ones of their new releases. So, you must have an open mind and face this album understanding the circumstances and admit to your collection such immortal gems as Never Satisfied or Run Of The Mill, because in the last one there's one of the best vocal performances in Halford's career. Some songs were recorded in 1974 but they were released off on Sad Wings for record label reasons, and I understand why many don't love this gray sheep so much, as the discarded compositions took a bit of time in order to be rewritten and perfected.\n\nIt was an album that firstly left me a strange impression, neither bad nor good, yet over the years I discover that they have experimental albums with good and bad results. Anyone would put this debut at the level of Point of Entry or some bad record of them, and yes, it doesn't have anthems with catchy choruses like British Steel, nor Painkiller's speediness or Stained Class guitar skills. I admit without shame that this little brother of Sad Wings of Destiny transmits the hippie, hard rock spirit in the purest Priest style. Even for a live recorded album (i.e. not mixed per track), this is too amazing. With my rating I'm not saying it's one of their best (on the Judas Priest scale if you ask) but surely a colossal record in its own right, leaving aside the irrational point of view that initiated fans have about this.\n",
        "\nJudas Priest is a band that tends to release irregular records since Jugulator, with some stumbles in their classic age such as Turbo and Point of Entry. The only record that I fully enjoyed was their latest release, Firepower. Redeemer of Souls is an album with correct songs, songwriting problems and poor production, which could be solved as Ram It Down, which has basic compositions but a magnificent production, especially on the guitars. I even liked the drums on \"autopilot\" on that 1988 record. With so much technology within reach, this band shouldn't have any such inconveniences. These old deities have made me suffer more than football.\n\nIt is better than Turbo, Point of Entry, Demolition and Nostradamus, but it's below the level of Firepower, Angel of Retribution and Jugulator. Unfortunately, poor production and the predominance of average songs over good songs it receives a low rating compared to Fear of the Dark, which has a good production and at least half of the album is really good. I'm not comparing both bands, it's a simple analogy I like to do with my two favorite bands. In Fear of the Dark I gave a more favorable opinion about British Steel than the reviewed album. Well, when it comes to an album with too many songs, I like to group them into three different groups in the review.\n\nThe Good: Dragonaut, Halls of Valhalla, Down In Flames, Battle Cry. This handful of songs show references to their early and later years. \"Dragonaut\" is a decent opener, it's good but it's too small compared to \"Judas is Rising\", if we talk about Rob's comeback. \"Halls of Valhalla\" and \"Battle Cry\" are the best tracks but they are nothing spectacular, in fact, they would be unnoticed on the B side of Screaming For Vengeance or any 80s album.\n\nThe Average: Redeemer of Souls, Sword of Damocles, Hell & Back, Cold Blooded, Metallizer, Beginning of the End. Most of them lack of speed, while \"Beginning of the End\" has a Rocka Rolla vibe but sadly it is inferior to any song from the band's debut. I'm not saying they're bad, they're entertaining, but pretty average, and even after a few days you forget that these songs exist. And regarding solos, I don't remember any memorable solo, even Rocka Rolla has more killer solos than this album!\n\nThe Bad: March Of The Damned, Crossfire, Secrets of the Dead. If things seemed very uneven, you find three forgettable fillers. Being such a long disc, the danger of filler is imminent. But focusing on the positive thing, if these songs were composed thirty years ago, they would be praised. \n\nIf the album remove some fillers and improve its production, many songs would look lucid than they really are. Metallizer's sound is criminal and not in a good sense because it has the potential to be a good song. Undoubtedly the band try to return to their roots and they try to give variety going through blues touches, even through references to Rocka Rolla or Painkiller, but without the magic, intensity and punch that I would liked to hear. I wanted to be generous with the rating but nothing justifies the inconsistency of this. The abuse of mid-paced and the lack of versatility don't help so much. I find it excessive and a lack of respect for their discography if I try to put it on the same level as Ram It Down, British Steel, Killing Machine or any second-rate stuff. Just notice that I rated 90% to Firepower. Too little to be Judas Priest.\n",
        "\nLike any comeback album: some will love it and others won't. I listened to the album again after a long time without visiting it, and my impressions improved a lot. It is a satisfactory album for the group's career because of whoever sings it. We once again hear the Judas we want to hear, and that point makes them gain a lot without too much effort. Contrary to Redeemer of Souls, I don't find any fillers or bad songs on this album. They're all correct. My big drawback is four songs. While 7 of them seem very remarkable, three songs have not yet been recorded in my mind but they entertain me at the moment, a worrying thing coming from some legends who, in past decades, were able to build and carry classic heavy metal beyond other understanding levels.\n\nThere are some simple anthems loaded with clich\u00e9s for the average rocker/metalhead. The results are good, don't find anything genuinely disposable or forgettable, but the way they build is exhaustingly flat, a matter that the passage of time might not forgive. Compliant record and little else, said in simple words. I admire their attempts to do other things, such as the beautiful ballad 'Angel', and the mid-paced 'Revolution', perhaps also 'Eulogy' or the closer 'Lochness' (which would be the band's warning of what will come in Nostradamus), I would ask for more effort and complexity on these songs. Worthy mention for 'Judas is Rising' -a good song that, if it had been developed further, would reach a very remarkable level (the one necessary to welcome Rob after so many years)-, also \"Deal with the Devil\" and \"Hellrider\", which convince me enough and even kindly remind the jewels from the past.\n\nThe transition between each track is satisfactory and overall they sound very compact, modern and fresh, but the content is a little less than what I expect from this band. I dare say that if this album did not mark the return of Rob, it would hardly say much and would not escape being expendable. Fortunately, Angel of Retribution is much more interesting than Nostradamus and Redeemer of Souls. If this album fails for its simplicity, the others fail in songwriting, production problems and the inability to coordinate a full-length. This band is not able for releasing very long LPs, as it is more difficult and tedious to evaluate them.\n\nYou will find songs that are reminiscent of Black Sabbath and have Led Zeppellin influences. As for the musicians, they all deliver and do a great job. I don't see a leading role or predominance of one over the rest, they all synchronize perfectly. They're very inspired but not more than on Firepower. Firepower... well, I'm more and more convinced that is the best one the group has released since \"Painkiller\" as it corrects the mistakes of previous albums, and they really sound like Judas Priest as I want, which in \"Redeemer\" was a throwback as they had too much to polish and their production was deficient to outrageous extremes. In order not to deviate, I conclude by saying that I'm still in the same position, Angel of Retribution is a fair return to form. This is the Judas Priest I love.\n",
        "\nBy 1984, Judas Priest\u2019s star was firmly on the rise. The more anthemic and commercial direction taken on the albums made after \u2018Stained Class\u2019 had led to the band\u2019s first major breakthrough in 1980\u2019s \u2018British Steel\u2019 and the release of \u2018Screaming For Vengeance\u2019 a couple of years later saw the band well and truly break North America, the album eventually going double platinum in the US. The refinement in the band\u2019s sound had been accompanied by a similar honing of their image, and by the time of the \u2018World Vengeance\u2019 tour the band\u2019s trademark look of studs, leather and Halford astride a motorcycle was a familiar sight to concert goers everywhere.\n\nMore so than any of their contemporaries at the time, Priest had taken metal to the masses and onto mainstream radio in a manner arguably not replicated until Metallica followed a similar path in 1991. But there had been something of a trade off in the song writing department in return. While classic songs in their own right, hits like \u2018Living After Midnight\u2019, \u2018Breaking The Law\u2019 and \u2018You\u2019ve Got Another Thing Coming\u2019 were distinctly slicker, less complex and \u2013 to some at least \u2013 less interesting than the musical directions Priest had been exploring on their albums up to 1978. The albums following \u2018Stained Class\u2019 had continued the general focus on riffs and direct song structures Priest had taken on that seminal work, but had filed down the edges and exchanged depth for hooks. \u2018Point Of Entry\u2019 had verged on being more radio-friendly hard rock than metal for the most part, and though the band had refound their harder edge the following year, Priest\u2019s music seemed to have strayed some way away from the gloom, ambience and mysteriousness which had made the band\u2019s 70s records so captivating and unique.\n\nFrom an initial perspective, \u2018Defenders Of The Faith\u2019 seems much like a continuation of \u2018Screaming For Vengeance\u2019, retaining much of that record\u2019s radio-ready hooks and sprinkled with enough anthems to fill arenas and stadiums (indeed, \u2018Rock Hard Ride Free\u2019 was initially laid down during the \u2018Screaming For Vengeance\u2019 sessions, but held over and reworked for this record). What elevates \u2018Defenders\u2019 above its predecessor however is that here Priest decided to get interesting again for the first time in a long while, continuing the anthemic leanings of the previous four albums while finally adding back into the band\u2019s sound the potent twin-lead aggression and attack that had underpinned their best 70s work. This process had already begun on \u2018Screaming For Vengeance\u2019 but on \u2018Defenders\u2019 it reaches its true flowering, best expressed in the barnstorming opener \u2018Freewheel Burning\u2019 (which somewhat incredibly was the lead off single from the album) which starts with a ferocious guitar line and books along nicely from there on in, being more akin to speed metal than anything else and certainly the most uncompromising start to a Priest album since \u2018Exciter\u2019.\n\n\u2018Freewheel Burning\u2019 lays down a marker for the record\u2019s approach as a whole. \u2018Defenders\u2019 sees Priest upping their technicality and instrumental tightness as a band, honed by successive mammoth American tours and with plenty of studio time under their belts to deliver an album which does not fuck about but gets straight to the point and delivers the riffs and songs. Tipton and Downing are on sparkling form, and the result is a polished, professional outing which retains enough grit and edge to avoid feeling like it\u2019s just product. Perhaps influenced by the nascent thrash metal scene (upon which they had been a major influence), Priest up the ante and aggression on \u2018Defenders\u2019 and go full-bore and straight for the target in a way that they had arguably not done since \u2018Stained Class\u2019 eight years before. The first side of \u2018Defenders\u2019 is a very strong contender for the best side of any Priest album, featuring the tight riffage and double entendres of \u2018Jawbreaker\u2019, the upbeat, over the top \u2018Rock Hard Ride Free\u2019 - one of Priest\u2019s best 80s anthems (as detailed below), and the mysterious, atmospheric \u2018The Sentinel\u2019 which rapidly became a live staple over the years. Again, the song writing and arrangements of the tracks bring to mind \u2018Stained Class\u2019 more than any other Priest album, riffs and hooks coming at the listener with great rapidity and the band taking a very direct approach which had been either somewhat lacking on the preceding albums or not perfected quite as much as it is here. It has to be said that the second side of the album is not quite as ruthlessly focused, but there is still a cohesiveness and consistency to it that elevates \u2018Defenders\u2019 into one of the most consistent and well rounded offerings in the Priest catalogue.\n\nThe appeal of \u2018Defenders\u2019 in comparison to the rest of Priest\u2019s 80s output is not, however, solely reliant on the band\u2019s playing and the directness of the songwriting. The overall vibe and ambience of the album is very distinctive. In contrast to the widescreen vistas of the preceding couple of albums, Priest opt for a much more noir approach on \u2018Defenders\u2019. Helped by a suitably atmospheric production job, the whole album has a brooding, melancholic feel to it that is perhaps best expressed in the single \u2018Some Heads Are Gonna Roll\u2019. The return to a more gloomy and atmospheric sound is a welcome nod back to Priest\u2019s 70s albums and helps add an extra layer of emotional depth and resonance to \u2018Defenders\u2019 that had been absent from their work for too long. The lyrical content of songs such as \u2018The Sentinel\u2019 \u2018Night Comes Down\u2019 and \u2018Love Bites\u2019 reflects this darker aura, emphasised by Halford\u2019s vocal delivery across the album which has a yearning edge to it rarely emphasised since in Priest\u2019s work to such a degree, adding extra bite and feel to the record. In addition, \u2018Defenders\u2019 marked the first time Priest used drum machines and effects in a serious way, giving a cold, technological feel to some songs. The overall vibe of the album is in some ways similar to many Hollywood action or sci-fi films of the 80s, particularly the \u2018Terminator\u2019 franchise (and possibly \u2018Die Hard\u2019), a sort of American techno-noir, and in many ways \u2018Defenders\u2019 is an album very redolent of its era, although like the aforementioned movies it manages to transcend its time and not seem dated (an issue Priest would very much fall foul of on their next album).\n\nThe general ambience of the record, from the lyrical references to the general brooding aura, the tightly played, tense riffage, and the urgency with which many of these songs are delivered makes for a thrilling, captivating and urgent listen that hooks the listener in quickly and doesn\u2019t let go. The infamous \u2018Eat Me Alive\u2019 deals with the subject of oral sex in a way that feels intense and primal, suffused with longing. \u2018Freewheel Burning\u2019\u2019s crescendo sounds thrilling and raw in a way Priest would not be again until \u2018Painkiller\u2019. The heartfelt \u2018Night Comes Down\u2019 (which could possibly be regarded as a successor to \u2018Before The Dawn\u2019) has a sombre and pleading tone that elevates it above and beyond the usual ballads found on hard rock/metal albums of the era and gives it a genuine emotional weight and honesty that make it a deeply affecting listen. Again, Priest had not made a record since 1978 which felt as sincere or went to such emotional depths as this, or one that was so musically consistent. Unlike \u2018Stained Class\u2019 however, not all the songs are sombre or gloomy, and Priest were still a band touring arenas and pumping out anthems. \u2018Rock Hard Ride Free\u2019 is one of the band\u2019s all-time great singalongs, featuring an insanely catchy chorus (with Halford going wildly and gloriously over the top with his vocals) and a continuous, driving rock steady tempo that underpins the celebratory and affirmative lyrics. Priest\u2019s commercial leanings would arguably never again be expressed as successfully as they are here, the song perfectly capturing the zeitgeist of the band\u2019s ascent to world dominance. Yet even here, the ringing guitar line which opens the song seems to have something plaintive and slightly wistful about it.\n\nThe only song which is really fully rooted in the band's more recent work prior to this album is the closing \u2018Heavy Duty/Defenders Of The Faith\u2019, a hand-clapping, foot-stomping audience participation number which can basically be described as \u2018Take On The World, Part 3\u2019 (\u2018United\u2019 off \u2018British Steel\u2019 being Part 2), and feels more akin to the sing-along aspects of Queen than anything else, albeit without the subtleties of Mercury et al. This is underscored by the lyrics, which are self-referential and knowingly anthemic, although as with \u2018Take On The World\u2019 and \u2018United\u2019 they are delivered with enough sincerity to come across as genuine and not cheesy. However, this particular trait would be overplayed to cringe making effect on the following two albums at times.\n\n\u2018Defenders Of The Faith\u2019 remains to this day the undoubted high point of Priest\u2019s 80s \u201cimperial phase\u201d, and more than any record made by the band in this era, it has a depth and emotional hook to it that rewards repeat plays. This is reinforced by the consistency of the music and the across the board tightness and intensity of the playing, especially Halford\u2019s impassioned and genuine vocal performances which (as noted above) lend a great deal of feeling and power to the music as a whole. \u2018Defenders\u2019 is a satisfying blend of the accessibility of the band\u2019s best 80s work with the dark and mysterious aura that had characterised their 70s output and had proven so influential in the nascent heavy and thrash metal scenes, and stands to this day as one of Priest\u2019s top two or three releases and a cornerstone of early to mid 1980s heavy metal. It is, perhaps above all, an album that really feels like the complete package, from the music and overall vibe to the performances and the artwork (which is a great representation of the album\u2019s assured and powerful nature), and it is not surprising that on the subsequent tour for the record the band felt enough confidence in it to play nearly all the songs from it live in the set. \u2018Defenders\u2019 is Priest at the apex of their creative and commercial stride, a supremely confident band in full flight and drawing on the best of their abilities. Recommended, and highly so.\n",
        "\nWith all the times I've talked about Turbo, it was only a matter of time before I have to review it. It pains me to talk about this, because Judas Priest can make great music, and they have shown that they're more than capable of making great music. \"British Steel\" and \"Stained Class\" in particular are classics and are arguably one of the greatest albums in traditional heavy metal. So imagine how shocked fans were when in 1986, the band released \"Turbo\" as a way to join the glam metal scene that was prevalent at the time. Literally everything about this album sucks, and to this day, it remains their worst album.\n\nLet's start off with the instruments. The best way to describe them is if you were to take all the popular glam metal songs that were popular at the time, morphed them together, and add in some cheesy moments that would make Kraft cheese look plain. A great example of this would be in the track \"Turbo Lover\". The guitars play some of the most generic glam riffs ever, and they feel really dull and boring. The drums also beat in quiet patterns, and even when they beat more \"aggressively\", it still feels weak. And don't even get me started on those poorly-aged synths. They sound so bad and feel so out of place, that you could get rid of them and the song won't change a bit. Not only that, but the production on this album is terrible. It feels polished, but it's also rough enough to not feel clean and simple. While there are a couple of okay moments, they are very rare and aren't enough to make up for the poor instrumentals and production.\n\nAnd then there's the vocals. Rob Halford's vocals on the previous albums were great, but here, they've been severely butchered. He goes for a singing style similar to other projects before, but the execution here is horrendous. He tries hard to sound epic, but there's some restraint in his voice that stops him from going all the way. A good example of this would be in the track \"Parental Guidance\". This track serves as an attack against the parental guidance war that was happening at the time, which sound alright for the time period, but Halford's vocals sound uninspired and weak. It's almost like he doesn't care about not wanting parental guidance. The vocals flow terribly to the instruments, and it doesn't do much to help out the already weak tracks.\n\nBut possibly one of the worst qualities of \"Turbo\" is the lyrics. Glam metal has its cheesy moments, but \"Turbo\" takes things a step further. In the track \"Rock You All Around the World\", this verse quotes:\n\nIn the cities of the world\nYou know every boy and girl\nGoes crazy to the beat of rock n' roll\nAnd as the volume is soaring\nAll the crowd is roaring\nLet it roll\n\nThis verse talks about how everyone is going crazy at a rock concert. The way it's worded makes the concert seem generic, and its repetition of the line \"We're gonna rock you all around the world\" gets annoying very fast with Halford's aching vocals. The lyrics are also executed horribly. As I've stated earlier, the instruments and vocals suck, so combining this with the half-assed lyrics makes the story in the lyrics sound clich\u00e9 and outdated. The lyrics are abominable, and I'm not kidding when I say this album has some of the worst lyrics in glam metal history.\n\nLook, I don't hate glam metal. I get that some people don't like the genre and think it was the biggest embarrassment in metal before nu metal and metalcore arrived, but each genre has its own good works, and glam metal has plenty of good albums and songs. I even thought Celtic Frost's \"Cold Lake\" was good, even though virtually every single Celtic Frost fan loathes it. But while I'm more inclined to defend those albums, \"Turbo\" is something I can't defend. From the generic instruments to agonizing vocals, plus lyrics that would make the members of M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce cringe, and it's safe to say that this is Judas Priest's worst album. Thankfully, they redeemed themselves with \"Ram It Down\" and eventually \"Painkiller\", but as it stands, \"Turbo\" is an album that will make you hit the brakes.\n",
        "\nBy the mid-1980s, Judas Priest had well and truly made it in the big time. Not only had they spent the previous few years working their way up to arena headliners and breaking the North American market on their own terms with their own sound and image \u2013 no mean feat for a British band, incidentally \u2013 they had also just released one of the best albums of their career in \u2018Defenders Of The Faith\u2019 and were generally riding high at the pinnacle of the metal scene alongside Iron Maiden, as well as being one of the key influences and inspirations for the emerging thrash scene. As they approached their tenth studio album therefore, they decided to commemorate this milestone by stretching themselves a little, broadening the diversity of their song writing and styles. The band spent much of their time writing and recording for the planned career celebration double album which was to have been entitled \u2018Twin Turbos\u2019. The record would utilise the band\u2019s recent discovery of guitar synthesizers to showcase a broad mix of styles, ranging from \u2018Defenders\u2019 style guitar wizardry to romantic ballads and more straightforward radio-friendly material, theoretically providing something for every Priest fan.\n\nThe project foundered, however, when the record company vetoed it. So what were Priest to do? There were several choices available to them. They could continue in the same successful stylistic direction that had made \u2018Defenders\u2019 such a classic of 80s metal. They could try and utilise the new guitar technologies to broaden their sound and add something extra to the mix. Or they could take the ten most commercially viable songs and vie for space on US FM radio with Poison and Cinderella, because they weren\u2019t satisfied with their already considerable achievements and wanted to push themselves into being the next Def Leppard.\n\nThe above rating should give a fairly obvious indication of which route Priest took in 1986.\n\n\u2018Turbo\u2019 is a pathetic and totally unnecessary attempt to cash in on the zeitgeist of the hair rock scene, a chronically forced and embarrassing record which nearly finished Priest\u2019s career and dealt a fairly severe blow to their status as metal legends which the band would spend some years recovering from. Above all, it\u2019s just phoney. There\u2019s nothing wrong with a band wanting to hone their commercial success, but when you decide to pretty much abandon the sound and song writing approach (which has already made you pretty successful) for a musical direction that you calculate will make you more money, then you\u2019re usually compromising your integrity to some degree, with predictably unconvincing results. Especially when (as here) your band\u2019s new image results in you all looking like the cast of Star Trek after a heavy night at the disco.\n\nThis record is nauseating. Straight away the intro to the opener \u2018Turbo Lover\u2019 strikes the wrong approach \u2013 it\u2019s a long drawn out guitar synth wash, rather than the pedal to the metal riffage that opened the previous album\u2019s \u2018Freewheel Burning\u2019. When the drums kick in, processed and noise gated to the point of no return, the listener realises very quickly that a major sonic shift has taken place here, and not for the better. When the song gets going, it has a certain techno pop-metal groove to it, quite mechanical, actually. Priest had used this kind of approach before in their work with some success, but here it sounds robotic. The production primarily appears to emphasize the incorporation of synthesizer technologies into the band\u2019s music, sapping the guitars of life and filing down the edges of their tones, and there\u2019s a distinctly radio-ready sheen to the whole thing which sounds incredibly polished and rather contrived, underpinned by the large but empty drum tones which add an extra level of cheese to the whole sound. \n\nThis sonic approach is basically the hallmark of \u2018Turbo\u2019 and is badly mishandled across the entire album. In comparison to Iron Maiden\u2019s \u2018Somewhere In Time\u2019 released in the same year, where guitar synths were used with a sense of taste and innovation, adding a technological/sci-fi edge to the music which still sounds contemporary, Priest\u2019s efforts on \u2018Turbo\u2019 resemble an old guy trying to work out how to use social media in order to get \u201cwith it\u201d in the computer age. The synthesizers are everywhere on this record, and they\u2019re usually unsubtle, obnoxious and annoying, drenching the few passable riffs in a gleaming, plastic sheen and loudly announcing their presence in various song intros, at times comically so (\u2018Private Property\u2019 starts with a chirpy synth line that seems to then go out of tune before the song starts). The effect is at times unintentionally hilarious, and in fact the album is an interesting piece of sociological and musical evidence as to how some bands in the 1980s were so taken with the new and emerging technology of the age that they allowed themselves to be completely engulfed by it, resulting in albums that sounded dated from the minute they hit the shelves. Even by 1990 \u2018Turbo\u2019 already sounded like a quaint relic from a more naive time.\n\nThe dominating synth excesses and shiny production would still be somewhat tolerable were the riffs and song compositions on or near the same level as they were on \u2018Defenders\u2019, but the major flaw of the album is that the song writing is a nosedive from Priest\u2019s usual standards, the band seemingly dumbing down their approach for this record in order to pick up chicks (perhaps not wholly true, but not without some foundation). The riff work on many of these songs is either lame or non-existent, the music turning away from the complex and intricate arrangements Priest were known for towards a much more open and simplistic pop-rock sound. Sometimes this approach works to a degree, giving songs like \u2018Turbo Lover\u2019 a full-on epic feel, but at other times it\u2019s just insulting to the listener. \u2018Rock You All Around The World\u2019 is the most egregious example of this, starting with an initial riff that is quite tasty and makes you think the album might be picking up a little, before shifting to a chord juxtaposition and song structure so inane that BulletBoys would have been ashamed to bring it into the studio. \u2018Wild Nights, Hot and Crazy Days\u2019 (that title!) is lowest common denominator party rock that you\u2019d be embarrassed to play even when driving down the Sunset Strip, not helped by the fact that the guitar tones and drum sounds are at their most overbearing and obnoxious here. \u2018Hot For Love\u2019 manages to plumb new depths in terms of synthesizer misuse and makes you wonder if this is really the same band who wrote \u2018Dissident Aggressor\u2019 less than a decade before. Only on the closing \u2018Reckless\u2019 do the group pick things up a bit, shift through the gears and stretch out a little in a nod to the classic Priest style, but it\u2019s not exactly something you\u2019d put on the same level as \u2018The Sentinel\u2019.\n\nIt is true that Priest had made more commercially oriented and radio-friendly music before on several of their albums (particularly \u2018Point Of Entry\u2019), and a certain accessible and anthemic element had been a part of the band\u2019s sound ever since the late 70s. However, it had never been allowed to truly dominate the song writing and composition across a whole record to the exclusion of nearly everything else as it does here, and certainly it had never been done in such an artificial and contrived way. On \u2018Turbo\u2019 Priest sound like they\u2019re conforming to what they think will get them on the radio and confining themselves to those limits, rather than having the confidence to just do it on their own terms. Comparing \u2018Desert Plains\u2019 or \u2018Living After Midnight\u2019 to anything off this album is like night and day \u2013 those songs sound natural and are the product of a band deciding to make less complex and more accessible music because it feels right to them. \u2018Turbo\u2019 on the other hand sounds incredibly forced. The closest thing Priest had previously done song writing wise to this was probably \u2018Take On The World\u2019, but even that seemed to come from a more genuine place, despite its relative cheesiness and openly commercial leanings. \u2018Turbo\u2019 is Priest trying to construct a monster hit album for themselves at the expense of their true artistic inclinations, and the result is so artificial it fools no one. Even as a \u2018fun\u2019 or \u2018party\u2019 album it doesn\u2019t work \u2013 despite the much darker subject matter and approach, \u2018Defenders\u2019 is way more fun and exciting to listen to than this.\n\nIt should also be noted that the lyrics are as low-grade and shallow as the music, for the most part. Gone are the tales of sci-fi figures, dystopian worlds and observances on the human condition, to be replaced by generalised romantic yearnings (\u2018Out In The Cold\u2019), odes to partying all night in the summer heat (\u2018Wild Nights\u2026.\u2019), exhortations for everyone to go crazy to \u2018rock and roll\u2019 (\u2018Rock You All\u2026.\u2019), or embarrassing attempts to challenge authority like the band are pretending they\u2019re still 18 (\u2018Parental Guidance\u2019). Again, the lyrical style is much more in keeping with the idea of a record calculated to sell to the new, younger crowd who were lapping up anything that came out of California as long as it had hairspray and spandex. The general decline in the music and lyrics would be shocking in most circumstances, but when you consider that just two years previously the band had released one of the best albums of the decade in \u2018Defenders\u2019, it\u2019s mind boggling. It\u2019s one of the most glaring artistic contrasts in any metal band\u2019s catalogue, and even now there\u2019s still an element of bizarreness and unreality about the whole thing.\n\n\u2018Turbo\u2019 is not, it must be said, completely without redemption, and under the synthesizers and mundane song writing a few bright spots can still be found. \u2018Turbo Lover\u2019 has an excellent solo from Tipton which lifts the song up considerably and for a few moments the blending of the new musical technologies with the Priest sound coalesces into something futuristic yet resonant of its era in a way that doesn\u2019t feel dated. \u2018Out In The Cold\u2019 has a certain cinematic feel to it (once one gets past the lengthy synth intro) and sounds quite powerful in places, helped by Halford\u2019s emotive vocal performance. The band as a whole are actually on fairly good form musically, carrying on the tight-knit feel perfected on \u2018Defenders\u2019, it\u2019s just that they\u2019re bogged down by playing such substandard material. If you want to hear what the record could possibly have been had the band tried to force things less and take a more genuine approach to the song writing, the live version of \u2018Turbo Lover\u2019 found on 2003\u2019s \u2018Live In London\u2019 album sounds much more muscular and organic and has a power and depth that the studio version lacks. Additionally, some of the unreleased tracks from the writing sessions were better than what was put on the album, (particularly \u2018Heart Of A Lion\u2019 which is easily found on YouTube) and had some of these songs been included, this album might have received a higher rating.\n\nAt the time of its release, as a commercial ploy, \u2018Turbo\u2019 initially seemed to justify itself. The album sold quite well, and the new fans attracted by the more commercial style ensured that the subsequent Fuel For Life tour was Priest\u2019s biggest ever. However, in the long run \u2018Turbo\u2019 signified the end of Priest\u2019s 80s rise. The sales were respectable rather than stratospheric, the new fair weather element of the fanbase soon moved on to Bon Jovi, and by the late 80s Priest were struggling to regain credibility amongst their older and more loyal fans who were largely disgusted by the \u2018Turbo\u2019 debacle. Somewhat unbelievably though, \u2018Turbo\u2019 would not prove to be Judas Priest\u2019s nadir. The next album, \u2018Ram It Down\u2019 (partly composed of leftovers from this period) is actually worse, though in a different way. \u2018Turbo\u2019, though, remains possibly one of the two or three greatest musical errors by a legendary metal band, and despite attempts by various people to re-evaluate its merits over the years it remains for the most part a serious artistic dead end which is not recommended for the listener except as a sociological and cultural point of interest, and for the lesson that it\u2019s always better to stick to your guns and be true to yourself as an artist, rather than chase approval or recognition from more fickle sources.\n",
        "\nI often wonder which is the worse Judas Priest album with Rob at the mic, and the final duel seems to be a showdown between Turbo and this one, their seventh studio LP, Point of Entry, an entry (no pun intended) in their catalogue that leaves much to be desired. Though both represent low points in their overall discography as well as lackluster attempts at banking at the trends, they have one big contrast in approach. Whereas Turbo shows a desire to experiment and broaden their sound by incorporating the synthesized sound of mid-80s and hair metal sensitivities, Point of Entry is firmly entrenched in classic hard rock tradition and eschews any innovation. The Metal Gods' entry into the new decade was met with commercial acclaim, as the iconic British Steel catapulted them fully into worldwide success, but musically it wasn't nearly as inventive and groundbreaking as their previous decade material. So their decision to hone into the style they believed would entice them more quid was only logical\u2026 from a financial point of view. \n\nPoint of Entry feels as if Judas Priest were traveling back into the 70s, but not on the same road by which they arrived into the 80s, rather, alternate routes already traversed by other bands previously. And while, since their inception, the Metal Gods weren't strangers to hard rock, they always complemented their influences with their signature harder and faster traits. Here there's a blend of low energy and creativity-deprived riffs and ideas stuck in excruciatingly monotonic mid-tempo and already concocted by the likes of AC/DC, UFO, Thin Lizzy, ZZ Top, Ted Nugent and others with far better results. Only the guitars' tone and The Metal God's voice remind us that this is actually a Judas Priest album, although the production values are not as pristine as on British Steel. Had this been marketed like a 'tribute' of sorts to those bands and their seminal 70s works, perhaps I would give it a higher value, but as a 'brand new' Judas Priest album, it ends up pretty short of the quality mark they had previously established\u2026 as well as what they'd accomplish farther into the future. \n\nHowever, like most of the Priest's works, Point of Entry is not entirely without some solid moments, though for me personally, there's basically only one from this release worthy of my time; opener \u201cHeading Out to the Highway\u201d. I mean, I enjoy AC/DC despite the fact that they've released the same album over an over since forever, so why not? The thing about this track is that it displays some catchiness and swagger the rest of the compositions here entirely lack. Yeah, it isn't really energetic or outstanding, but at least you can wave your fists and (mildly) bang your head to it. Rob's voice and the double axe-team guitars are the highlights (surprise!), and even though the song is mid-paced the riffs carry enough drive to make it quite enjoyable, along with a short and simple solo and a brief harmonic passage of those beloved dual-guitars. Tom Holland manages to provide a few cool fills to an otherwise plain performance here, and the good ol' Ian Hill is as dependable as usual. A B- tune for a A+ band, that's the sole oasis in this desert for me. \n\nThe rest of the tracks range from totally boring and skippable to somewhat listenable from time to time, those latest being \u201cDesert Plains\u201d and \u201cSolar Angels\u201d. The first one heralds some of the things to come in Turbo, both in style and themes, and the second appears to be a similar but much less powerful \u201cMetal Gods\u201d, seemingly describing UFOs instead of tyrannical robots. Again, it's the Holy Trinity of Rob-Glenn-K.K. the engine that provides just the sufficient potency for this pair of compositions to avoid remaining stranded in the wasteland of oblivion, though neither would enter my 'Priest Top 50 Best Of' playlist. The remaining 25 minutes are composed of rehashed music which I simply won't waste time and finger movements to describe. If you happen to listen to the bonus material from the 2001 remaster, you'll be transported right to Turbo with \u201cThunder Road\u201d, which actually fits the original style of this record quite well, and is in fact superior to most of its original tracks. The live rendition of \u201cDesert Plains\u201d is also amusing, much more aggressive that the studio version. In any case, I wouldn't recommend to purchase Point of Entry in any version, it's just too dull. There's really no point.\n",
        "\nAfter the acclaimed British Steel, Judas Priest picked up their simple but intense beam to continue in the scene, but taking a smooth and straight highway this time, without many potholes, where the influence of American desert they were crossing gave life to this \"road soundtrack\" called Point Of Entry. Due to pressure from the record company, the band could not continue with its increasing roughness, since those who ruled the business did want to conquer the American market. This band softened their music and recorded one of the most controversial albums and one of the least valued ones.\n\nThe album opens with Heading Out To The Highway, a classic one that still survives in concerts. It's a very effective song, with a lot of punch from the measure. After that decent opener, the album suffers a slump, with caramelized refrains that contrast with the dirty and torn verse in a very uncomfortable way. Along with Turbo, it is Judas Priest's worst album in their classical epoch with Halford. It's incomprehensible that they released this album after British Steel, it's like a huge step back, an involutional album. Then came Screaming for Vengeance\u2026 the album that British Steel had to follow, but anyway, record business.\n\nBut... \"WR95, I thought you had a little more metal culture, but your ignorance leaves me with a jaw drop because you have said so much nonsense that I hardly know where to start. To say that Point of Entry is the worst Judas Priest album should be punished with a red card. I can understand you like it more or less, but not knowing how to appreciate what Point of Entry is is the same as never having understood Judas Priest, one of the biggest experimental bands of the world\"... I don't deny it, Judas Priest is one of the few bands that has never been afraid to evolve. I would say, even more, evolving is part of their essence. And it's something we'll never thank them enough for. Now, I don't share that false vision of those who think that there is no evolution for better or for worse. This album is an involution in terms of sound and songwriting. This band is able to do better jobs than ever and then gather all the elements from each work and transform them into a single album, as they did in Painkiller.\n\nSome say that this disc was a continuity that can't compete directly with British Steel, and that's the reason it has all to lose. The riffs are simple, while Halford surprises us with his glam voice. Those \"a-ha, a-ha\" sung with a certain sensuality, talk clearly the intentions on this album. Point of Entry can be a decent rock album, but not for Judas Priest standards. Even for rock standards, this is mediocre. Also, the cover art is not that memorable, far from it. Anyway, I consider this album better than Demolition and Nostradamus. Metallum Rating: 15%. Rock Rating: 45%.\n",
        "\nThis didn't need to happen, Priest could have taken the loss that was Jugulator as a sign and called it quits after 1998, but no. They had to shit forth another mess of an album, this time however, it was somehow ten times worse than its predecessor. \n\nNotable replacement for rock god Rob Halford, Tim Owens was unfortunately still in the band at this point, so I didn't have high hopes about the vocals side of the album, given his absolute rock-bottom performance on Jugulator. Yet somehow he still managed to sink to a brand new low on this record. Bizarre rapping on \"Metal Messiah,\" electronic voice change effects in \"Cyberface,\" awful layered-tough guy vocals on just about every other song on here and a stomach turning attempt at emotion on this album's two ballads \"Close to You,\" and \"Lost and Found.\" *shudder.*\n\nThose layered vocals and effects I mentioned really do drag this album down way beyond the depths of plain bad, because not only do you have to listen to Tim's dry, monotone normal voice, but you also have to contend with him screaming and growling poorly and having strange effects applied to his voice, like excessive distortion and a VERY early 2000's robot-like voice. Couple that with Rammstein riffs and drum beats and it is like hell on earth for lovers of GOOD music. Everything is so out of place, it is all so uncalled for and it is beyond bad. Tim does however hit some rather high notes like we all want him to in \"Bloodsuckers,\" \"Subterfuge\" and \"Hell Is Home\" that while technically they are impressive, they just lack that ear piercing shriek and warble of Halford's voice. Speaking of the man in black. If Rob Halford was on this album, it wouldn't have made much of a difference because he wasn't into the whole screaming like a banshee thing anymore, as evidenced by his Fight and 2wo projects. Halford was more interested in groove and industrial metal. Well, come to think of it, he might actually have loved Jugulator and Demolition then! In any case, his presence would not have saved Demolition. Tim Owens had to take the fall.\n\nI want to speak a little more about Tim Owens actually, because he was just NOT a suitable replacement for Rob Halford, he wasn't a suitable replacement for Matt Barlow of Iced Earth either. Actually, Owens just didn't really suit any band for the longest time. Only when he did his solo stuff in 2008 did he find his niche. His voice, tone, range and style on Demolition rub me up in such a wrong way that I cannot express how it goes so wrong enough here. If you haven't heard anything from the 1997 to 2003 era of Judas Priest, do yourself a small favour; go download a few tracks from Jugulator and Demolition just to hear and experience for yourself what this period of the one of the greatest heavy metal bands was like. You won't be impressed.\n\nTurning to the instrumental side of this record, things do not fare much better. Tipton and Downing's guitars have been downtuned yet again into mush, so naturally they sound weak and lack impact, unlike the razor sharp tone of \"Painkiller\" or even some of \"Ram It Down.\" Ian Hill can actually be heard this time, surprise, surprise. And what is he doing? Literally just following the rhythm guitar and nothing else. No dips or dives (not that I expected much) or anything interesting. No wonder he is mostly hidden in the mix. A shame. Scott Travis on the other hand has somehow lost the ability to play fast or to play anything that isn't a Lars Ulrich, my first-day on the drums beat. Seriously, Scott plays the most basic of drum beats imaginable, mostly because these songs call for that but it is so crushing to hear a drummer who once played \"PAINKILLER\" play crap like \"Cyberface\" or \"One on One.\" No frills or drum fills either, it seems. \n\nThis is a nu-metal album at its core, with industrial elements thrown in at random times and also a healthy helping of groove metal. Practically everything that could go wrong with heavy metal in the late 90's and early 2000's can be found Demolition. The cover art is disgraceful and so is the production. Everything is so flat and quiet with the song \"One on One\" having especially annoying buzzing, electric sounds and melodramatic breakdowns in between. Tim Owens continues to molest the senses with his layered vocals from every angle on stuff like \"Devil Digger\" and \"Jekyll and Hyde,\" while axemen Glenn Tipton and K.K. Downing continue farting about on their respective guitars and producing the worst riffs and solos this side of the century. \n\nThe two ballads on Demolition, \"Close to You\" and \"Lost and Found\" actually aren't half bad, despite Tim Owens moaning into the microphone. \"Close to You\" is definitely the best song on this album because it actually has a few seconds of passable singing with great melodies and flow. It is slightly soppy and dramatic, but hey at least it isn't DRIPPING with 2001 effects and ear rape like the rest of this hour and ten minute monstrosity. I'll take what I can get.\n\nHonestly this isn't even a Judas Priest album, like Jugulator before it. They should have renamed the band during this time to Tipton or something because this is essentially a Glen Tipton solo album as he assumed total control since Halford left the nest. He had full control of the lyrics, music style and attitude as well as having full control of the way Tim Owens sang on Jugulator and Demolition; \"If I want you to scream like a woman, you scream like a woman, if I want you to do a death growl, you do a death growl.\" That was an actual quote from Tipton himself. So we know who was pulling Owens and the rest of the band's strings.\n\nOne song out of thirteen is worth your time from an album that has been rightfully forgotten by Priest themselves. This is album is a product of its time. Anything that was popular around 1999 to 2001 you will find on Demolition and, seeing as they never made an album this bad since, good riddance to bad rubbish.\n",
        "\nJudas Priest's debut is a odd ball in their classic catalog due to being completely overshadowed by their sophomore effort Sad Wings of Destiny in 1976 with that record being considered the \"true\" start of Judas Priest as a metal band. While I do agree to a certain extent Rocka Rolla is definitely a solid debut and shows a more hard rock/classic rock sounding Judas Priest. Most Judas Priest fans tend to skip over this one but there is some stellar tracks on here and to me it's a shame this album doesn't get lumped in with their other classics by some fans. This album is the only album to feature John Hinch on drums as the band would cycle through different drummers for the next few records. \n\nThe production/mix here is pretty damn good in my opinion it has that classic 70s vibe to it and everything is super clear and audible. No instruments aren't heard or drowned out everything is pretty level in volume. Halford sounds as good as ever even during this era the dude never fails to perform. Glenn and KK don't have the heaviest guitar tone here but they still crafted some classic and memorable riffs right off the bat with Rocka Rolla and would continue to do so for the next 16 years with the band. Ian Hill cuts through with ease and you can hear his bass lines with no issues. Hinch's drums are thin sounding and super articulate his playing really suited this more classic rock type of vibe the band started out with really well. \n\nThe tracks on Judas Priest's debut are pretty damn good not all of them but majority of the songs here deliver. The album starts with \"One For The Road\" which has this swing feel to it and is quite catchy. Next is the title track which is slightly up beat and kind of has a 50's rock vibe to it especially during the chorus part. I may be wrong but it just has the vibe to me it isn't one of the best songs on here but still pretty damn good. After this the record kind of nosedives a bit with the nest 3 tracks \"Winter\", \"Deep Freeze\", and \"Winter Retreat\" these seem like they should have just been one long song but instead they broke them up into 3 separate tracks and honestly they don't do much for me and cause the record to go stagnant after 2 solid songs. \n\nThe album starts back up again with \"Cheater\" which sort of drags along but its not a bad song that drags in a way it has a sassy type of vibe to it with harmonica laced through out its run time, overall a decent track. Next is my favorite song from this record \"Never Satisfied\" which has a killer opening riff and guitar solo. This song is hands down a classic and wish the band busted this one out live sometimes. \"Run of the Mill\" is a mellow track that clocks in at 8 and a half minutes, its a semi ballad that builds up and has a mix of heavy riffs and mellow parts and overall is a really good tune. \"Dying to Meet You\" is set up just like \"Run of the Mill\" but slightly shorter a semi ballad with a mix of heavier parts and more mellow soothing guitar parts. The last track \"Caviar and Meths\" is a short instrumental that closes the album but doesn't really do much. \n\nIn Conclusion I do think is the one of the more under appreciated Judas Priest records and I would go to say in my own personal opinion I would take this record over anything the band has done post Painkiller, It's that good to me. I know this isn't heavy metal Judas Priest yet but I would urge anyone who is a fan of the band to delve into Rocka Rolla as it contains some really good material. The material on this record set the course for what was to come in the future for Judas Priest and for me I think Rocka Rolla is a great debut. for 1974 this album is pretty stellar not every track is great but for what it is worth I feel most Judas Priest fans or fans of 70's hard rock would really get a kick out of this record.\n",

Come on!\n\nNah, forget this plead; both you and I know very well that this album simply doesn\u2019t deserve them. And the disappointment, at least from my side, was bigger as I was expecting \u201cJuggernaut\u201d, the most logical follow-up to the \u201cJugulator\u201d\u2026 instead we got this \u201cDemolition\u201d. Well, title-wise it sounded like a deal, but on the music front it bears very few resemblances to the preceding steam-roller. It seems as though the Priest team were so enamoured with their departed frontman that they had voted to follow his every step and emulate it if possible. So they produced one rowdy on-the-verge-of-thrash modern metal album along the lines of Fight\u2019s debut, and then they softened and grooved it on the sequel in the vein of \u201cA Small Deadly Space\u201d. Thumbs up.\n\nA pity cause Owens deserved a more dignified exit from his short-lived stint with the band. The interesting thing is that this effort begins with MM (\u201cMachine Man\u201d) and finishes with MM (\u201cMetal Messiah\u201d). The first MM sounds like this offering may eventually bear something to match its predecessor, a modern energizer with vitality to spare, but the second one is a blas\u00e9 frolic quasi-industrial rocker\u2026 those two very well exemplify the metamorphoses this album has to go through in the span of 1h10min; yeah, a long ride which inevitably features tunes that save it from complete oblivion; tunes like the boisterous mid-paced march \u201cOne on One\u201d, the macabre doom-laden \u201cJekyll and Hyde\u201d, and especially the intense shredder \u201cBloodsuckers\u201d, another possible dropout from the \u201cJugulator\u201d sessions. The rest is a sea of numerous dramatic balladic idylls (\u201cIn Between\u201d, the soporific \u201cLost and Found\u201d, etc.), goofy dancey nods to Rammstein (\u201cSubterfuge\u201d), groovy draggers (\u201cDevil Digger\u201d)\u2026 the lots. A handsome tribute to the past decade, summing it up at the dawn of a new millennium\u2026\n\nsure, but if such a summation was needed in the first place, why did Judas Priest, of all bands, find it necessary to provide it? A most shining illustration of a creative cul-de-sac this is\u2026 the guys had no ideas about how to prolong their existence so why not compile the influences that rocked the previous decade, and try to present it as their own as a belated farewell gesture to it? \u201cYes, we do have a talented singer who could do much more on a more classic-fixated material, but we don\u2019t have the ideas for it. And, do we really need to mosh like demented like we did on the \u201cJugulator\u201d? Let\u2019s just relax and jam in the groovy 90\u2019s way\u2026\u201d.\n\nWay to go, lads, only that few would be the old fans to follow them down that path provided that Halford had already shaken off all detrimental partnerships (remember the ill-fated joke Two), and was ready to conquer the metal arena once again. If this was a needed exit from a contractual obligation with Steamhammer then I can possibly understand\u2026 but even then, imposing an old fad on a new beginning for the classic metal canons? By one of its instigators and most ardent in the past advocates? Man, how lucky the guys were that they weren\u2019t living in the times of the witch and heretics\u2019 hunts, in the times of the bonfires and the crucifixions. \n\nOwens\u2019 swansong was a very downbeat one, unfortunately; a pity again as the man surely deserved more. Still, he had his more than 15-min of fame, fulfilled a childhood dream, jammed with his idols, bathed in the spotlight for a bit\u2026 and was by all means noticed by the circuit, taking part in quite a few acts (Beyond Fear, Charred Walls of the Damned, The Three Tremors) at present, including the one under his own name. All\u2019s well that ends well, like people used to say, including in the Judas camp that saw the return of the lost son Halford for a fairly decent string of new albums in the new millennium. Well, you can\u2019t keep everyone happy with the \u201cgrumpy old men\u201d period from life knocking on their door with all the bloody knuckles, with KK Downing having staged an exit from the team\u2026 demolition this isn\u2019t, not to worry, just an unmitigated argument typical for all age-old families.\n",
        "\n\u201cPriest, priest, priest\u2026\u201d, yeah, I can still hear the chanting of the priests\u2026 sorry, fans\u2026 we\u2019re talking 20,000 maniacs out there, after all, raving like lunatics\u2026 it was only Scorpions who were able to attract larger crowds at the time. Yes, the mid-80\u2019s were successful times for Rob Halford and Co., no doubt, and judging by the reception the \u201cTurbo\u201d album enjoyed commercially, there was little to complain finance-wise either. \n\nQuality-wise, however, things were vacillating, and this opus remains one of the weakest achievements in the Priests\u2019 discography, tussling at the very bottom of the list with \u201cPoint of Entry\u201d and the goofy rocky debut. The band\u2019s diehard fans mustn\u2019t have been very happy with this caramelized stylistic shift; I mean, did Europe really need a Motley Crue clone to jump around, sing \u201cHot for Love\u201d, \u201cWild Nights, Hot & Crazy Days\u201c, and throw toffee and other sugar candies at the audience\u2026 what about those with diabetes? Cause the danger back then was pretty big that the once-British steelers and metal gods would throw all this down the drain and would become pop-metal entertainers\u2026 and the latter possibility became even bigger when the album sold very well, prompting the band to come out with a massive tour in support of it. America was the coveted place to conquer and here they were, five English veterans, revitalized and unmetallized with cheese and glamour to spare, landing on the other side of the Atlantic, by all means eligible for immigration. \n\nJudas proved themselves immaculate live performers on the extraordinary \u201cUnleashed in the East\u201d, one of the five greatest concerts ever produced in the history of metal, and probably in music in general. With the lathe raised inordinately high some eight years earlier, this compilation here had quite a bit to live up to\u2026 and it did for sure as the musicianship is top-notch all over, the sound is tremendous, the support from the audience is absolutely inspiring, and the song collection is\u2026 well, that last part seems to hobble a bit, and this is the reason why this effort doesn\u2019t get a higher score. Putting \u201cOut in the Cold\u201d up front, the only ballad on the album\u2026 well, sending 20,000 people out in the cold on a June night, at an impossibly hot place like Texas may not be the worst idea ever, and why not cross the romantic material off the list first? Sure thing, that could be forgiven after a few-hour deliberation, but why \u201cHeading Out to the Highway\u201d right after? It never ceases to beat me why the guys like this song so much, playing it everywhere, humming it in the bathroom even I\u2019m sure\u2026 the only justifiable reason I see for this to be included here is as a mere obligatory entry from the mediocre \u201cPoint of Entry\u201d\u2026 although for me personally \u201cHot Rockin\u2019\u201d from there is a much better choice anywhere anytime, a decidedly hotter rowdier, more boisterous proposition. \n\nNope, doesn\u2019t do it for me, this introduction to the first disc but then it all steam-rolls from there with the evergreens \u201cMetal Gods\u201d and \u201cBreaking the Law\u201d from \u201cBritish Steel\u201d, and when this glorious triptych (\u201cLove Bites\u201d, \u201cSome Heads Are Gonna Roll\u201d, \u201cThe Sentinel\u201d) from \u201cDefenders\u2026\u201d enters the fiesta easily hits the roof, with \u201cPrivate Property\u201d wrapping it on, hardly a major party spoiler with the rowdy chorus and the catchy rhythms. Not too many cuts from the \u201cTurbo\u201d so far\u2026 just the first and the last one. Strange\u2026 and good.\n\nDisc two is much better arranged with \u201cRock You All Around the World\u201d tossing everyone in the air initially, sped-up here and turned into a near-speed metal roller-coaster, the finest song on the \u201cTurbo\u201d and a prime flag carrier. Any concert that comprises \u201cElectric Eye\u201d, one of the finest numbers ever composed, is destined to remain in the annals of history, and the guys make no mistake, the \u201cScreaming for Vengeance\u201d opener is here, notching up the atmosphere to fever-pitch proportions. It\u2019s hard to completely ignore \u201cTurbo Lover\t\u201c, sounding much better live, a bouncy heavy lover\u2026 sorry, rocker which, if nothing else, is the most emblematic piece on the entire tour. It has to be here, but whatever cheese and glue have been left in the aether after it, are irrevocably washed away with the hyper-active speed metal delight \u201cFreewheel Burning\u201d, the \u201cPainkiller\u201d prototype which Halford proudly post-announces as \u201cprimal thrash metal\u201d. Nearly there, Rob, nearly there, but we\u2019re not enjoying a Slayer or Destruction concert here, and such brutal frivolities may come as too much for the Americanos, especially when the majority of those are closely watched by their parents who would thoroughly savour \u201cParental Guidance\u201d, another safe bet from the \u201cTurbo\u201d. Enough with the cuts from there, some would say, and yes, the show goes on with the impossibly infectious rockarolla \u201cLiving After Midnight\u201d, and the staple sing-along anthem \u201cYou've Got Another Thing Comin'\u201d.\n\nYep, there\u2019s nothing like a Judas Priest live out there, hey; the lads have done it again, more commercially viable, more audience-aware, marginally less energetic and youthfully exuberant. Well, it\u2019s one thing to visit Japan in the late-70\u2019s as half-tourists and half-enthusiastic rockers, having no expectations whatsoever from the ensuing concerts; and it\u2019s an entirely different thing to perform as millionaires in front of a targeted US audience that is sure to catapult you higher into any rankings imaginable\u2026 the agendas were different but they hardly had any influence on the quality of the music. Proficient accomplished musicians can pull it anywhere, even in front of a sentenced-to-death prison bunch; and this is why they have millions of fans and remain in the hearts and mouths of many way after they\u2019ve retired. I guess it also helped a lot that they never became full-time pop-metal practitioners although the tepid follow-up \u201cRam It Down\u201d was largely saved by leftovers (the title-track, \u201cHard as Iron\u201d, \u201cMonsters of Rock\u201d) from the \u201cTurbo\u201d recording sessions\u2026 you can clearly see that those far superior numbers couldn\u2019t have possibly fitted into it. All supposed shame washed away irrevocably by the indomitable \u201cPainkiller\u201d, the absolute pinnacle in the band\u2019s career, and possibly in the entire metal arena\u2026 after it nothing else mattered (Metallica must have composed their hit with the \u201cPainkiller\u201d in mind); literally\u2026 departed frontmen, fights, jugulators, gruesome twosomes\u2026 even the reunion stint in the new millennium seemed anti-climactic compared to what the guys achieved in 1990.\n\nFrom \u201cTurbo\u201d to \u201cPainkiller\u201d\u2026 a road often travelled; with a fascinating stopover in-between where 20,000 maniacs will deafen your ears and will probably eat you alive\u2026 but phoenixes and Judas fans are the only two species that are doomed to rise again\u2026 so there\u2019s no ending to this saga, neither happy nor sad; the goods\u2019 deliverer works 24/7, a proud American Express-certificate carrier with a bonus British steel... sorry, seal.\n",
        "\nThe keyboards are on the blink, the organ is broken, and Judas Priest are for the first time little more than just pure raw metal \u2013 this is one of those albums that just keeps me coming back for more and deserves every compliment it can take. If it was still 1977 and you thought that the likes of previous songs such as \u201cGenocide\u201d and \u201cDissident Aggressor\u201d had been unnecessarily heavy or a little inaccessible, perhaps hoping for more commercial ditties like \u201cStarbreaker\u201d or \u201cLast Rose of Summer\u201d then the following year Priest have come back with a record to upset you. This is man\u2019s release where guitars and drums rule, and the age old tried and tested pop-song structure we love and loathe so much has been half-forgotten.\n\nThe album\u2019s opening phrases of toms, cymbals and double bass drumming set the tone for a confident celebration of prowess and power. Priest immediately sound like they love what they\u2019re doing as \u201cExciter\u201d hastily drives home their technical capacity and accomplished pace. There weren\u2019t many bands around at this time playing at this speed, and thrash/speed metal fans should know all too well how influential this piece really is. Whilst a few songs fade out at the end there are plenty of climactic punches ending several tracks \u2013 \u201cWhite Heat, Red Hot\u201d switches from a 4/4 arrangement to 6/8 and then positively kills it on the last note, and \u201cHero\u2019s End\u201d leaves us with that superb lead guitar outro that helped so well shape some of the most eerie moments from early Slayer.\n\nIf there\u2019s any let up there isn\u2019t much. Even the cover of Spooky Tooth\u2019s \u201cBetter by you, better than me,\u201d which carries some added keyboard effects, still hits the mark with its morbid and terminal tones, and the catchy and comical \u201cInvader\u201d hypnotises enough to make a nice drive home. But in terms of giving the listener an easy break that\u2019s your lot. Even Halford\u2019s versatile range is pretty much confined to the upper notes with little experimentation and a straight delivery at the higher-level throughout.\n\nAll songs delight, but it\u2019s \u201cSaints in Hell\u201d that really gets my air-guitar hot, and it was hearing this again that really made me listen to what Judas Priest are saying... not just musically but lyrically too. Never having read what they\u2019d been writing before, some 25 years after originally getting my mits on this release did I stop to think what was being said \u2013 and what great song-writing there is here, with the bold musical structures supporting fine and colourful words.\n\nPriest always had this release in them. We just had to wait for album number four for them to crack it. Ace drumming, wicked riffs, distinctive solos and vocal venom to boot. A true heavy metal classic.\n",
        "\nAww \u201cRocka Rolla\u201d, what an....interesting way to start ones genre defining career. To be completely honest this album was probably either one of my last or the last Judas Priest albums I listened to in full. Now \u201cRocka Rolla\u201d is nowhere a bad album, matter of fact I think it\u2019s a good / decent album, but it is lacking a lot of the charm and interesting writing that Judas Priest would have later with their next release \u201cSad Wings Of Destiny\u201d and beyond. What\u2019s interesting is that some songs that would be highly influential in the metal genre such as \u201cTyrant\u201d and \u201cRipper\u201d that was written by recently joined Glenn Tipton was actually cut from \u201cRocka Rolla\u201d and makes me wonder if this album would have been more well received and revered from critics and audiences if they weren\u2019t cut. Just an interesting \u201cwhat could have been\u201d. \n\nWith the writing on the album, the original member / frontman, Al Atkins, had some of his material appear on \u201cRocka Rolla\u201d. You can really tell that this release is a transitional period between the Al Atkins era and the classic Priest era as the songs that Atkins wrote feel more fitted to him vocally than it does Rob Halford. Compared to what would come next, the albums writing is pretty simple and feels calm and carefree to listen to. I don\u2019t personally find a good portion of the soloing and riffs to be overtly complex but there\u2019s some real nice soloing to be found here that is a little more intricate in \u201cNever Satisfied\u201d, \u201cRun Of The Mill\u201d, and \u201cDying To Meet You\u201d. If there\u2019s two songs that would give a hint to that \u201cleather and chains\u201d feel that later Judas Priest material would adorn, it would probably be found in \u201cCheater\u201d and \u201cRocka Rolla\u201d as Robs gruffer side seeps out. Overall the whole album is written as a simple affair with little treats for the hardcore Priest fans to pick apart and recognize where their distinct sound came from. \n\nI found the performances to be the best aspect of the album as this is a Rob Halford, Ian Hill, Glen Tipton, and K.K. Downing in their prime after all. John Hinch, who provides his only appearance on a studio album with Judas Priest behind the drums, also offers a well rounded performance. Ian Hills bass is very audible and has every much of a presence as Tipton and Downings slick guitars. The bass isn\u2019t written with much variation outside sticking with the rhythm of the song but I do like how tight it is and hits you with its loudness. John Hinch gives a very tight performance but I do wish he was able to dish out more of those jazz-rock influences throughout the album. \n\nTipton and Downing really complement each other as they always have and this album is no exception. From their more melodic somber moments in the last half of \u201cRocka Rolla\u201d to their more classic metal / hard rock / bluesy sound in \u201cOne For The Road\u201d, \u201cRocka Rolla\u201d, and \u201cWinter/Deep Freeze/Winter Retreat/Cheater\u201d, Tipton and Downing know how to play to each other\u2019s strengths. Finally Rob Halford makes a great impression here as he brings a tame yet sturdy performance. His operatic singing would come out more in later releases but you can find his higher yells and squeals in \u201cDying To Meet You\u201d or \u201cRun Of The Mill\u201d. \n\nNow moving over to what I found to be the worst aspect of the album is the production. From background information gathered by the band it seemed that there was technical issues during the studio sessions. There\u2019s a noticeable hiss or static found in all the songs that detract a little from the listening experience. It\u2019s not the worst in the world but it is something that adherently effects the quality. Add that along with the fact that they also preformed the whole album live in the studio and you get...well...this.\n\nAll in all \u201cRocka Rolla\u201d isn\u2019t really much of a memorable album, outside of possibly the song \u201cRun Of The Mill\u201d, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bad album in the least. It\u2019s mostly a simple written record wrapped in a gentle identity (fun fact; most of these songs were much heavier during live shows before the recording process but somehow that gentle nature bloomed on this record). I don\u2019t think simplicity makes something of lower quality as the execution is what really matters and I feel \u201cRocka Rolla\u201d achieves that for the most part. If you\u2019re not really a big Judas Priest fan then this debut probably won\u2019t sway your feelings to like more of their music but if you are a fan, I recommend at least checking it out once, it might just rock ya ah little.\n",
        "\nOriginally the boys in Priest were going to do a double album, called Twin Turbos, until they're label made them do separate releases, which resulted in 1986's \"Turbo\" and this album 2 years later. The common consensus is that \"Turbo\" is disappointing and too 'glammy' and that this album is better because it's more metal. I'd argue that this album is the weak, disappointing one.\n\nThe album's best material is located mostly on the first half. The title track sucks you in immediately with a piercing scream from Rob and launches you into near thrash intensity. The second track, simply called \"Heavy Metal\", starts with a nice solo before going into that trademark Priest \"steel\" sound. When the rhythm kicks in for the first verse the bass hits you in the chest and the band maintains a sinister vibe throughout, similar to \"Metal Gods\". Things take a slight turn, though, with \"Love Zone\", which sounds like a \"Turbo\" leftover given a more metallic coating. Very so-so. Same goes for \"Come and Get It\", which sounds like it went through the shredder or something, that opening riff cuts through, and not in a good way. It does improve for the pre-chorus though, so not a total bust, but it does give off a bad first impression.\n\nThe next two tracks, however, may be the most interesting. \"Hard as Iron\" is pre-\"Painkiller\", without a doubt; it wouldn't have been out of place on that album, although it would've been one of the weaker tracks. On here, though, it stands out in a good way, and it shows were the band was heading, with almost speed metal ferocity. \"Blood Red Skies\" is the epic of the album, skirting an 8 minute length. It harkens back to Priest's 70's period, while still being of its present era, with an emphasize on synthesizer sounds. \n\nIt is here, unfortunately, that the album teeters off into the void of boredom. \"I'm a Rocker\" and \"Love You to Death\" do nothing for anyone; they are as mediocre and forgettable as they come. \"Monsters of Rock\" sounds like bigger deal than it is, but it doesn't pick up much at all and ends the album unceremoniously. The worst song here is the cover of \"Johnny B. Goode\", a baffling inclusion on this album. The song sounds like it belongs on a Mega Man soundtrack, which isn't a bad thing, but considering that this is originally a Chuck Berry rock 'n' roll classic it seems somewhat tasteless.\n\nLooks and first impressions can be deceiving, kids. Before judging \"Turbo\" give it the time of day. You may find yourself enjoying it, I know I did, which I can't say for this.\n",
        "\nDemolition, the Judas Priest album no one asked for, has spawned many detractors from the onset of its release and it is easy to understand why. During the \u201880s and \u201890s the albums were energetic and exciting whereas Demolition is mid-paced and very seldom ventures into breakneck territory. During the \u201870s the albums were progressive and transcendent whereas Demoltion fails at even relevance. There is one significant connection to those '70s classics however and that is the return to the style of composition. It might seem strange to write that about this release, mostly due to its universal disdain and lack of Halford\u2019s songwriting, but it was created in the same vein as Sin After Sin or Killing Machine.\n\nFor all of the excellence found on Jugulator, it worked for most metal fans for the same reason Painkiller did, it stuck to a particular style and rode that wave of \u2018consistency\u2019. It may have been \u2018consistent\u2019 but just like the two albums before it (Painkiller & Ram It Down) it can become a chore to enjoy in its entirety. For the first time since Turbo the band goes back to the light and shade formula - perhaps their lone identifiable mark - and developed a very inconsistent plethora of songs. None lack power so a knock on its consistency cannot be about that. Perhaps the biggest culprit behind the critical reception is the lyrical content and this is one of the few times that the silly inanity hurts the compositions. None of them are disasters by any means but for all of the talents Tim Owens has as a performer, he never mastered the ability to sing lyrics soaked in cheese (Devil Digger, Metal Messiah) and own the role.\n\nHalford had the theatrical style and charisma to still be taken seriously while singing silly lyrics so he would have brought the absurdity (Machine Man, Hell Is Home) to different heights. However if we are going to credit Rob where it is due then we must credit Tim as well for laying down vocal melodies that would be impossible for Rob given both his current or his 2001 voice. Because Tim has a naturally lower register than Rob he really gets to shine on the tracks that utilize his low end skill. If Jugulator was Tim's chance to scream like a banshee, Demoltion was Tim's chance to snarl like a dog. Like Subterfuge, with a throaty snarl denouncing totalitarian empires, he bemoans the subjugation with banshee shrieks and guttural grunts within seconds of each other. He uses the death grunts to great effect in Jekyll & Hyde, Devil Digger, Metal Messiah and Cyberface. The entire album is a vocal tour-de-force, Tim is certainly not the reason this album failed, however I will concede that it is absent of the operatic screams the band is synonymous with.\n\nJudas Priest were just being their typical self, \u2018borrowing\u2019 what was contemporary in 2001. From the digital artwork, aggressive title, industrial percussion, down-tuned instrumentation, low registered and spitfire rap vocals, this album could not have been crafted to fit into the nu metal and groove metal scenes any more if it tried. As stated before however, this album does not wish to consistently beat you into submission for its entirety, it is more like Sin After Sin where there is a journey with plenty of circumventing forks.\n\nSo what of the music that exists behind the vocalist? The biggest knock against this record (and Jugulator to a lesser extent) is the lack of amazing solos. This criticism is slightly warranted but has also always perplexed me; while it is true that very few can shred like Tipton or Downing, guitar solos were not a very common element of metal music in the era. It should be noted that Demolition does feature some well crafted solos, they are just more restrained here, less about flash and more about functionality. This is not the air-guitar glory days where solos served like a vacation from the composition itself, this brand is more about concise expressions. While this is subjectively good or bad, it does fit objectively within the context of what Priest were trying to achieve. They are nothing if not sufficient at copying the styles of others.\n\nWhile the album does not contain as many memorable riffs as prior efforts, there are still plenty that are substantive and the heaviest the band has been to date. By tuning down to C# the band was embracing the groove metal styles and this can be heard mostly on the albums two greatest tracks Subterfuge and Cyberface. While being strong lyrical compositions, musically the former is the bands sophisticated take on the Neue Deutsche H\u00e4rte style made famous by bands like Oomph!, Weissglut or Rammstein, while the latter is an industrial themed opus of building thematic tensity. Much like Nightcrawler, this is high on atmospherics and suspense, while both are lyrically about an unnamed creature and sung mostly in a baritone range. The difference is the much slower pace, which allows it to build to a morbid crescendo similar to Depeche Mode, accompanied by Don Airey\u2019s synthesized backdrop. The mechanical arrangement lends a sort of credence to the lyrics, and it should be noted that this track was co-written by percussionist Scott Travis, adding to its deafening bottom end sensibilities.\n\nAs much as I have raved about this album, it does have some weak moments that keep it from being a top five release. The first two tracks are a terrible way to begin the release because even if they had been artistic masterstrokes they are entirely too long. One On One has a great driving riff but is six minutes when it should have been three, and Machine Man is a cheap second rate attempt at recreating Painkiller. As is most often the case with Priest the album gains serious momentum as it continues, with more vivid compositions buried in the grooves. The other weak moments are the other \u2018hits\u2019 from the album, Feed On Me and the second ballad Lost And Found. \n\nJust like the other duds, these tracks have strong performances by Tim, the music is just uninspired and lacks a goal, meandering around before finally limping to the finish line. This is made even more egregious by the fact that Lost And Found is somehow the albums lone promotional video. What is wrong with the band\u2019s management? Most of these songs have vivid depictions of the macabre, which would have translated well to video form, but little to no promotional effort was made with this release. It is one of the bands worst managerial missteps since 1986. If they wanted to promote a ballad they should have chosen, Close To You, one of the albums vocal and musical highlights. Beyond the ballads are some killer gems like Hell Is Home, Jekyll & Hyde, In Between and Bloodsuckers, compositions in the vein of any from Stained Class. An array of different moods, atmospherics and tempos, the vocals snarling and shrieking at the appropriate measures.\n\nThe Japanese version of this record contains a bonus track called What\u2019s My Name, which is significant since it is the only song that Tim Owens had a hand in writing. The fact that his lone contribution was relegated to a bonus track shows the band could not sustain the novelty of a competent replacement for too long. The albums potential lost much steam as a result of the terrorist attacks of September 11. Priest were in Mexico and heading to the US for a tour that would begin on that night, but they had to wait four months before their plans could be continued. The trek across the US was slated to be with Anthrax and while that is a great lineup, the US was under the grip of Amerithrax and it was seen as poor taste. The bonus track What\u2019s My Name is an enjoyable but forgettable track that is worth getting the Japanese release for.\n\nSo why has this album not found much warmth during reevaluation? Why do most still see it as one of their worst? It comes down to how diverse the album is. Judas Priest has only ever released three albums someone would call consistent - Stained Class, Screaming For Vengeance and Painkiller - so it comes down to how you like your metal. If you can handle a metal band doing what a portion of artists in each genre to exist do - sampling outside of the genre - then Demolition will capture your imagination.\n\nWhen it comes to any metal that does not fit under the more extreme styles, some of its greatest creations are those that feature songs which serve to break the monotony. These light moments cause the heavier moments to become even heavier. A rule that should be understood about traditional metal is, \u201cIt is not going to be heavy if it is heavy all the time\u201d \u2026 You need the those lighter moments to strengthen the heavier moments and no one understands this better than Judas Priest, who is also never better than when they compose like they did on this release.\n\nHighlights: Subterfuge, Cyberface, Bloodsuckers & Close To You\nLowlights:: Machine Man, Feed On Me, Lost And Found.\n",
        "\nThe first five years of metal titans Judas Priest is an incredible tale I would suggest learning about. They first formed from the ashes of a group called Jug Blues Band in 1969, wrote two songs, toured their home country but disbanded within a year. Vocalist/songwriter Alan Atkins joined a local band who swiftly changed their name to Judas Priest as a way to elevate their traction in an overcrowded circuit. From January 1970 to April 1973 the band composed a dozen songs before one of the most ironic shifts in music history happened.\n\nIn April of 1973, strapped for cash, taken longer than their contemporaries to get a record deal, and on the brink of collapse, Atkins stepped down as singer. He was replaced within a month by Rob Halford and while no one could deny that this move was for the best, it overshadows just how superb Atkins was, and still is, as a vocalist and songwriter.\n\nBecause of this shift, the bands debut Rocka Rolla is a transitional one, a conscientious evolution from two diametrically opposed front voices. Rob had only been in the band for a year by the time Rocka Rolla was recorded so each composition with the name Atkins attached sounds disjointed. Halford is a vocal god, and in some ways already was by 22, but these songs were composed for a voice Rob had not perfected yet, a raspy mid range timbre with bellowing wails.\n\nMore than just disjointed though, a big mark against the debut is how gentle and virulent it is, which is unfortunate. Any soul who heard these songs before this was recorded (circa 1971 - 1974) knows this does not do the band justice in anyway. The music was heavier and harder than it comes across here, leaving Rocka Rolla so totally unmatched that it makes Point Of Entry sound like Firepower. Most of the songs sound thin and brittle, bereft of inspiration, due to vacuous production.\n\nIt is easy to point to Rodger Bain\u2019s production as the weakest link but I think the blame falls on circumstance mostly and, to lesser extent, the band themselves. They were naive and the only member with studio experience had left to be a family man. Just like Rodger gets a lot of flack for his role here, he gets many defenders because of his work with Sabbath\u2019s first three immortal classics. What those defenders forget was that Rodger had the services of the legendary Tom Allom who engineered those same three albums. Of course Tom Allom has now produced seven of Judas Priest\u2019s eighteen studio albums and four of their six live albums, all of which are expertly handled, so perhaps he was the missing link in the production chair for the debut.\n\nNo matter the faults of production, the more significant culprit for this albums failure is the naive songwriting. This album was recorded only weeks after Glenn Tipton had joined and his lack of ideas is a glaring flaw. The band was not only still trying to find an identity with a new vocalist, but now another member who is an absolute tour-de-force creatively. Adding Tipton has proven to be one of the greatest additions to any established band in history, but he is very underused here. So what about the album itself? What makes it so bad? Are there some good ideas to be found?\n\nThe songs on this album written (at least partially) by the recording lineup are:\nOne For the Road\nRocka Rolla\nWinter Retreat\nCheater\nRun Of the Mill\nDying to Meet You\n\nOf these six tracks, only one carries an actual progression, which is Run of the Mill, the only real highlight of the album, its one saving grace. Of the five other tracks, they boast a grand total of nine riffs. I am not being hyperbolic about that, nine riffs in five songs! Winter Retreat has zero and Rocka Rolla has the most with three. The lack of riffs in these five songs would be acceptable if there were good ideas but the only idea worth noting is in Dying to Meet You. The band made two completely different songs and put them together, an idea fully realized two albums later with Let Us Prey/Call For the Priest. The compositions of all six of these songs are lifeless, deliberately plodding in place, as if in molasses.\n\nThe songs on this album written by the previous lineup (including Atkins) are:\nWinter\nDeep Freeze\nNever Satisfied\nCaviar & Meths\n\nTo demonstrate the albums flaws I need only discuss the two biggest offenders here, which are Never Satisfied and, especially, Caviar & Meths. The few scattered bootlegs from the Atkins era as well as his rendition some twenty years later both reveal Never Satisfied had a blues-laden acoustic intro before coming to life in a vivid display of equal part aggression and speed. Whoever made the decision to drop the acoustic intro and slow down the progression took an anthem and made it a complete bore. The solo break, and its strange 19/16 time, is one of few clever ideas the album can boast but the song never goes anywhere, and is played too slow here for having just 2 total riffs. Between this being the most known song from the album and the one Priest chose to represent it at recent retrospective concerts, on top of being incredibly weak, quite frankly, this is the weakest composition Judas Priest has ever attached their names to. Not to put too fine a point on this but Never Satisfied remains the only song in the Priest catalog where someone else did a better job than Rob Halford.\n\nGull Records are notorious for both mismanaging and driving away the priceless gem of a band they had signed, as well as coasting a half century on Rocka Rolla, Sad Wings of Destiny, and a few scattered demos. I am positive then when I state that no one regrets the ditching of this lineups recordings of Caviar & Meths more than Gull Records. Oh, what could have been...\n\nSpeaking of Caviar And Meths, it was first penned by Al Atkins in 1971 and remains the crowning achievement of his long and storied career. The song is very dramatic, its narrative tastefully woven with the punishing riffage, an idea used later in Victim Of Changes, it was heavy and intense, the riffs biting with metallic might and inflections that mirrored the lyrics. The song begun life as a two and half minute number in the vein of Bo Diddley that evolved through live performances and rehearsals to become highly emotional, with Atkins in a woeful soliloquy about life in the most depressing of natures. Painting a vivid picture of brutal enslavement, where every soul has next to no future, only alive to harness enough energy to keep their masters in well financial standing. A tale that might have been personal for growing up in post-WW2 England but appears to, unfortunately, have a timeless quality to them.\n\n\"Never to own. Always to strive. Just want a little piece of something, in this life\".\n\nThe song that began life as a two minute block of plodding blues and evolved alongside the band who made it to a fourteen minute epic is reduced back to a two minute block of guitar noodling, utterly destroying all traces of Al Atkins in the band in the process. To hell with you, Gull Records.\n\n\"Want to be like you, want to see your views. Want to taste your life of ease\".\n\nThe biggest irony here is that the extreme poverty the song speaks of gave us the Judas Priest we know today, had the band come from better fortunes, Atkins would have never left, he was only forced out by circumstances. As much as one can sympathize with Atkins, even he agrees that he would have never done what Rob Halford had and losing him has been a fair trade considering what these metal pioneers have given the world of music ever since. That does not excuse the injustice done to this one song though, it is unforgivable.\n\nIt is not like this was just Atkins\u2019 song and was dropped after he exited, the band continued playing it as their encore during Halford\u2019s first two years with the band, including the tour to support this very album, which was its very last. While the song was shortened by a good four minutes, it still kept the core section and was recorded as a demo, which Gull Records has \u2018misplaced\u2019 in some way.\n\nThat might be a lot to say about what is, on just a musical level, a pretty bad album but I also feel that its failure overshadows just how creative early Priest was. I would suggest any person interested in this album, or any Priest fan who is otherwise unaware of them, to listen instead to the albums Atkins made after his departure. Every Judas Priest song he ever had a hand in writing he has rerecorded and is the only way to hear a take on how these songs were all those decades ago.\n\nAs for Rocka Rolla, download the song Run Of the Mill, the first half of Dying to Meet You and avoid all the rest.\n",
        "\nJudas Priest formed in 1970, but wouldn't gain mainstream success until the mid 80s with \"Turbo\". While the album gained commercial success, it had mixed reviews from critics. That's because the band literally sold out. With generic guitar riffs, generic production, generic lyrics, virtually everything on the album was bland and generic. When the band released their next album \"Ram It Down\", it still had its radio-friendly moments. However, compared to their previous work, they had a bit more edge on the style.\n\nThe overall style on this album has more diversity. The guitars have less of a sterile sound and comes with more distortion and power. The drums also have more beats and sound to them, compared to the barely acceptable sound in \"Turbo\". And Rob Halford's vocals have improved. His voice comes with more dramatic shouts and clear power. However, there are still the occasional bland moments in the album. In \"Heavy Metal\", the song does begin with a fantastic solo guitar. However, it then kicks to typical 80s synths, a bleak guitar riff, poor drum performance, and average lyrics that won't impress any decent poet. The overall song sounds more like glam metal.\n\nThe ballad \"Blood Red Skies\" is one of the highlights of the album. We start off with a space-like atmosphere. We then hear an acoustic guitar playing a nice, emotional riff. Halford's sings the intro part very nicely, and the screaming he does has a dramatic tone and fits perfectly in this section. We then move on to the second part, where we hear an industrial-like drum with a loud guitar. This section is one of the more powerful moments on the album, as it gives off an epic atmosphere. Hatford's vocals here are also more powerful and epic voice in this section, as he sings about how he will continue to fight, even when he loses. The lyricism on this part is excellent with poetic descriptions of continuing to fight, and are executed well with the overall atmosphere. It's one of the best songs off the album.\n\nThe album, however, does have a complete sellout song, and that's \"Love Zone\". It's one of the shortest songs off the album, not even clocking in at 4 minutes. Everything on this song feels like a leftover from \"Turbo\". The guitars have a more generic riff that doesn't sound special, the drums are sometimes ignored, as it occasionally gets a little quieter in some parts of the song. Hatford's vocals also sound forced with the mediocre 80s hair metal atmosphere, and the lyrics he sings are a typical love story you'd heard from other 80s love songs, just in a glam metal style.\n\nWhile the album still kinda maintains the sellout style of \"Turbo\", the band still went for a different style. The overall production is a far cry from the sterile one in the previous album, and Hatford put a lot more effort in his vocals than before. While it's not perfect, especially when compared to \"Painkiller\", it's still an overall good album that I would recommend.\n",
        "\nSlipped out of sheath back in 1986, two years after veritable beast and heavy metal hallmark in Defenders of the Faith, is all-time Judas Priest head scratcher Turbo - called thus out of ax man KK Downing's affinity for his recently acquired Porsche - gifted to circumstantial victims by square-john, working stiff record executives at CBS. (Hmpf! Couldn't they have stuck with Dan Rather's daily evening news?!)\n\nFret not, fellow illustrious citizens of a newly Covid-ed age, as the British masters' tenth LP ain't all that worse for wear. Alongside that blazing \"All Fired Up\" bonus track, which first appeared on Columbia Records' 2001 re-mastered CD, we've the indelibly corny, if not creepily twisted, hand-jobbing cover art, as well as unforgettably memorable, slam bashing and oh-so-iconic titular opener, complete with aerobic, 80 style synth pump-age/prosaic-as-all get out mechanized drum beat and Rob H.'s quivering ode to electric elopement to rejoice in, with Glasgow smile fit to order.\n\nWell, in fairness, procure inevitable jollies from terrible artwork's close resemblance to kinked out, axe strumming hand gracing the cover of, you know, my very first cassette proper, at age of five or so, Slade's Keep Your Hands Off My Power Supply, in addition to a couple further tracks which readily get me grooving - namely, the second piece, here, after \"Turbo\" proper, the slap-master-bop fest \"Locked In\", but especially, without doubt, a killer Priest number ranking up there with \"Devil's Child\" and \"(Take) These Chains\", closer \"Reckless\", for which the opening bars and wicked refrain inevitably return my strength, be it whence down and out, living out of my back(pack) on wet n' gnarly, pigeon-shit smeared downtown mean streets, or even cozily going mad, slowly, and ever-surely, diplomatically ensconced within a drying-out program, where music reigns king, even above snacks, showers and salubrious settings. In any case, the song simply sounds...so gosh darn cool, particularly the gate-smashing intro solo in tandem with breezy vocal lines, bad-ass bridge riff and, last but not least, squelching, high-wire, cybernetic lead demarcating said comfy closer like a quiff parting fastball inside the strike zone. \n\nIn other words, both are hard-driving, knife-jacking, roundhouse adumbrating seizers fit for valedictory, pick-up bar bloody caesars. Arf! Much of the same, however, CANNOT be said, or espoused in any manner, as far as pedantically stiff, twin \"P\" arena clearers \"Private Property\" and \"Parental Guidance\" go! The jury's still out regarding which fares worse. Yeah, so the keys at former's inception prove mildly auspicious, but that's the bulk of it as remainder epitomizes the most contrived, boxed-in and cornered brand of corporate clap-trap known to man, woman, hermaphrodite or transvestite (without even considering wacky world of select, made-up-on-the-spot pronouns). That chorus! \"Keep your hands off! My private property!\" Sure, Halford's voice still contains power and oomph. It's simply such a waste he's got to yawp such limp-wristed diatribe, especially, as fellow colleague(s) reminded the masses, how could the gang so fiercely protect all that's holy and worthy in rock and metal, prior to relaying this broken, tepidly ha(s)ted mess of facile rhythms, compounded so by lack of pyrotechnic leads across the board?!\n\nMost everything depreciated, I believe, has been yelled to MA rafters and beyond, particularly for G rated mega-turnips \"Parental Guidance\", the anthem-sized, albeit utterly banal, \"Rock You All Around The World\", and, notably, a number so bad it's actually great, in its own lopsided, kitsch way: \"Wild Nights, Hot & Crazy Days\"...Haha! Guys and gals the Earth over wince in delight as Rob and co. wax bubbly and ribald like a bunch of beach-combing, horny teens on Spring Break.\n\nThe equally synth-a-fied, if not veritably longer, 6.5 minute B Side \"Out In The Cold\", along with randy crotch-grabber \"Hot For Love\" (on which we're treated to some of Rob's cranky low-mid range), for their part, have moments, few and far between - certainly no Riot or UFO, or any Priest, proper. Looking back at the 1980s, if I wanted token glam reprisals (of both nature) would hit up some Cinderella, Mama's Boys, Ratt, or, for want of something saucy, France's glamy-but-unclammy Fisc. \n\nInsofar as JP's Turbo is concerned (and spurned), save for token few gear breakers, demarcates Metal Gods' lowest point. Only, remember to release emergency break before pushing through at low to (bi)nary throttle.\n\n\"No one can stop me now\nI'm like a human dynamo\nLive wired and chargin' out with power\nThis time I won't hold back\nI'm rarin' to get up and go\nFuelled up and growin' by the hour\n\nLook out!\nI'm blastin' through the lines\nAlive and kickin'\nWatch out\nI'm young and lethal\nI'm goin' from here until eternity!\"\n",
        "\nJudas Priest are one of the most important bands in the history of metal. They exist since the 1970s and have influenced thousands and thousands of acts. Yet the pinnacle of their career coincides with a record released just in 1990, probably the most extreme and heavy of their entire discography.\n\nIt obviously is Painkiller, one of the most powerful albums in the history of music. In facts, while the first records were still quite \"delicate\", while remaining metal, this is the musical version of taking a hammer to the teeth.\n\nTo confirm this, the titletrack starts with Scott Travis pounding the drums and a nice riff, not particularly fast but pressing and completely devastating. There is not a moment of rest for the whole song, which runs for six minutes between rapid solos, apocalyptic scenarios starring the splendid metal angel portrayed on the famous cover and Rob Halford demonstrating all of his vocal power with absolutely perfect screams. There's a reason it's a metal anthem now. Hell patrol is slower and perhaps more catchy and controlled but equally engaging, as well as a second magnificent opportunity to admire the band's technique, and All guns blazing, another fast and violent piece, in just three minutes destroys the listener's resistance to the power of metal. \n\nLether rebel is the most melodic song, although characterized by rapid verses, a bombing bridge and an explosive refrain, but it is just the calm before the storm. Metal meltdown, track number five, is, as you can guess from the name, even more destructive than Painkiller. After a very technical initial solo, the descent into molten metal begins (and Halford almost breaks through the sound barrier with his vocal prowess). Night crawler is introduced by a disturbing choir and proceeds with a full-blown horror atmosphere created by distressing riffs, a scratchy voice and a spoken interlude that describes the physical and psychological sufferings of a monster's unfortunate victims.\n\nBetween the hammer and the anvil is more regular, but the riff is still perfect, fast and suspended between hardness and melody, the drums really look like a hammer that beats on an anvil and the voice, as well as being powerful as usual, provides other vocalizations which are certainly enviable. The start and end are very peculiar, slow and oscillating, perfect to create expectation. A touch of evil begins wonderfully with the tolling of a bell and a rather gothic keyboard sparkle and continues even better with a mid-tempo with sensual and desperate tones. Battle hymn lasts less than a minute, but it is slow, solemn and bewitching enough to lead to the final piece, One shot at glory. The latter is the closest thing to a power metal song that has ever been inserted in a record of another genre, with lots of epic and warlike lyrics, and it is perfect thanks to the mixture of speed, melody and aggression.\n\nThe line-up is the classic one and you can hear it. After all they are musicians of the highest level, among the best of the last fifty years, and in this album they really show off all their skills, both in terms of technique and of expressive ability. Few releases can make understand what metal really is in its purest essence and Painkiller is one of them.\n\nIn addition to the music, the lyrics are also heavier than the rest of the Priest discography. They are dystopian, apocalyptic, even horrifying, and even come to touch on \"uncomfortable\" but always fascinating themes such as religion and sin (Between the hammer and the anvil and A touch of evil).\n\nThe result is pure metal ready to overwhelm the inexperienced listener (but also the expert one). Despite how many artists it has influenced, it is a unique album of its kind, which has also remained unsurpassed by its predecessors and successors. And this is why it is legendary and will always be.\n\nBest tracks: Painkiller, Metal meltdown, Night crawler\n",
        "\nThere are two specific questions that keep me busy since I came across the name Judas Priest. The first question is why Judas Priest fans seriously expect a new genre-defining classic from a band that has been active since 1969 and has shaped a whole genre like no other band? And although this group released at least a handful of albums in their careers that are considered undisputed classics among fans and musicians around the world near every fan expect an new timeless classic. To speak for myself this won't happen, and I think that this fact is a normal conclusion for a band of that age.\n\nThe second question is, what the Hell is wrong with \"Jugulator\" and the entry of Tim Owens to replace Rob Halford who left the band years before? This guy is cool! Yes, it is hard to replace a legend like Rob Halford, also because he has a unique voice and is one of the best singers ever. But seriously, Tim is a great musician. Wicked voices claim that Tim Owens' compositions could be the main reason for the very dark orientation of the songs on this album. Bullshit! Anyone who is just a little bit concerned with the topic will find out that Tim Owens just joined the band after the whole album was written. So it was not his fault, get rid of it folks! \n\nSo is \"Jugulator\" a bad album just because it is not a new classic in the history of heavy metal, or just because Tim Owens has sang on it? The answer is a clear no! \"Jugulator\" is really good and I like the work of Tim Owens alot here. To speak for myself \"Jugulator\" is my second-favourite album with him behind the mic after \"The Glorious Burden\" by Iced Earth. The album itself is the darkest, most thrashy, and by far heaviest album this band had ever put out. The production is more raw than on previous releases and the mood becomes dark and darker with each passing song. Even the lyrics contain a more morbid content as in the past. This and the dark mood may be the reason why so many fans can't cope with this album.\n\nFor example the titletrack starts weird as Hell, with droning guitars and a haunting spoken word section before transforming in an thrashy headbanger. Tim sounds so evil the whole playtime that it is fun to listen. He never sounded so aggressive in his whole career again. And everyone who has a sense for good groove in riffs will love \"Blood Stained\". Killer riffs and basslines slaughter the ears, and Tim's vocals burns in the brain and did not leave that fast! The same can be said from \"Dead Meat\" with its grand chorus and crunchy guitar work. The most of the songs does not differ extremely from each other, the whole album feels like a natural stream as if it were written in one session. But this fact is the reason why I adore it so much, it feels like the band had fun to show their destructive site.\n\nAnd then there is \"Burn in Hell\", a song that builds up slowly with its haunting atmosphere and Tim's chanting dark words. Some say that this song would work much better in the single version in which the complete intro is cut out. I say no! The album version has a much stronger build up and works far better! It is a headbanger to kneel down, and I recommend every metalhead to take off the tomatos from their ears and to enjoy this little piece of Hell. All in all I would consider \"Bullet Train\" as the most classic Judas Priest song on \"Jugulator\". Not too dark, more melodic and speedy. Great song and a earcatcher. But I doubt that this one song will comfort the ones who mourn the departure of Rob Halford. \n\nAt the end of the day I can just say: Please give this album a listen, folks. Just listen to the closing epic \"Cathedral Spires\" and try to explain me why this masterpiece is not worthy to call it a Judas Priest song. Just because Rob Halford did not stand behind the microphone, or because of the change in direction? \"Jugulator\" is not a typical Judas Priest album, but it is worth every minute of your time. I think Judas Priest created an album that is a class of its own, a more aggressive and morbid record. I hope it will get more attention because it is something of a forgotten Diamond. Thank you for your time, my friend.\n",
        "\nLet\u2019s be honest: if that fucking amazing drum fill was the whole album, I\u2019d get why half of the reviews here (13 of 26 as I write) award 100% to Painkiller. But, since it\u2019s only 14 seconds at the start of the title track, I suppose I need to look beyond that, right? It\u2019s also wise to look beyond the title track as a whole, since the pedal to the metal attitude of the opener doesn\u2019t quite expand itself over the entire album, as some might have you expect. I\u2019m trying to get a grip on how this album actually fitted into the scene of 1990, and - my lack of interest in Judas Priest\u2019s career trajectory withstanding - can\u2019t help feeling that it was against the current, sort of going for one last hurrah of \u201880s principles. I mean, the most obvious influences I pick up (barring Priest\u2019s own British heavy metal brethren) are from the US power metal of Omen and the like, the German speed group stirred up by Walls of Jericho, and King Diamond, which you\u2019ll hear as soon as you start listening to Rob Halford shrieking his way through \u2018Metal Meltdown\u2019.\n\nNow, I\u2019m not saying that the artists listed above exclude the idea that Priest were innovating, though this could only be viewed as innovative in the sense that it combines the purity of those other bands into an extremely pure concoction. Again, I don\u2019t want to step the wrong way and say that Painkiller is pure like whiskey or rocket fuel. It\u2019s more like\u2026a really good coffee, in the sense that it\u2019s strong and satisfying, but there\u2019s no danger that I\u2019ll get wasted or go crazy or torch myself alive. Why am I saying that? Because I feel that Priest weren\u2019t actually going for the heaviest album they could make, nor the fastest; in fact, it\u2019s more like these veterans had a plan to make an album full of anthems. Check out the slightly muted main riff of \u2018Between the Hammer & the Anvil\u2019, which sounds as if it wants to be sung by a crowd in the same manner as \u2018Fear of the Dark\u2019, while possessing the atmospheric quality of contemporary King Diamond. This set of songs was designed to be as catchy as Iron Maiden and push traditional heavy metal to the same limits as Mercyful Fate and their face-painted singer.\n\nWithin those bounds, I think Judas Priest did one thing well, which was to create a unique identity for Painkiller. The song titles alone tell a tale of proud heavy metal worship related through certain characters and metaphors - Manowar done up for a night in the city. Most of the songs strike the right balance between cockiness and menace, the bent notes in the verse riff of \u2018One Shot at Glory\u2019 the extra spice that prevents this being simply another good time metal record, while the grit in the guitar tone also ensures that Halford\u2019s ball-busting high notes don\u2019t become too much to take. What gets me every time I listen to the album, however, is just how simple a lot of the songs are, almost always focusing on one main riff - possibly with another added for the chorus - alongside a big refrain and raucous bouts of soloing that positively become tiring during longer cuts like \u2018Painkiller\u2019 and \u2018One Shot at Glory\u2019.\n\nAnd another thing, you\u2019re kidding yourself if you think this is a fast-paced album. Only \u2018Leather Rebel\u2019 and \u2018Metal Meltdown\u2019 outpace the quickish title cut, a few lead sections excepted, such as the cooking solos in the aptly-titled \u2018All Guns Blazing\u2019. That gives a handful of moments where the guitarists really take charge, sometimes just shredding mindlessly through their leads and stepping back for Halford and Scott Travis on drums to drive the energy elsewhere. Given that those main riffs tend to be pretty good, it\u2019s somewhat of a shame to let Travis take the focus so often. Perhaps changing the mix around and giving the guitarists a little more freedom to affect song structure would have made a difference, since Halford clearly gives his all on every song, though vocals can\u2019t generate all the excitement. The ascent into the solo on \u2018Leather Rebel\u2019 is a good example of savvy songwriting: a very simple technique to bridge effectively between sections, which isn\u2019t used nearly often enough. On a different note, am I the only one who thinks that song starts off sounding like Running Wild?\n\nSo, here\u2019s the big moment: am I really as lukewarm on Painkiller as I sound? Well, I still think it\u2019s a great album, just obviously not for being utterly groundbreaking or perfectly executed. The anthemic approach that Priest took paid off well on most counts, \u2018Night Crawler\u2019 coming out with an excellent chorus, \u2018A Touch of Evil\u2019 making the keyboards work surprisingly well, and \u2018Metal Meltdown\u2019 getting the edge for craziness. The finest achievement probably remains the title track, yet I\u2019d say even that\u2019s overlong. On balance, however, Painkiller definitely rids the world of much more pain than it causes.\n",
        "\nMeltdown is the first of two live records with new American singer Tim Owens who had joined British heavy metal legend Judas Priest in difficult times to give them a new face. The studio record Jugulator with its industrial metal style and sinister soundscapes had been received controversially and the same could be said about this release recorded during numerous concerts all around the world in the late nineties.\n\nOn the positive side, Meltdown sounds surprisingly fluid. The transitions between songs are smooth. Intercations between the new singer and the crowd are energetic and entertaining. The fans came in big numbers to cheer the band and the enthusiastic crowds can be heard throughout the double album. This release offers value for money with twenty-four songs and a generous running time above two hours. One gets to hear classic and recent songs and no fillers in form of vapid instrumentals or self-indulgent solos. The set list is quite balanced with the band's greatest hits, some obscure fan favourites and five new tunes. The band sounds great performing songs like the energetic \"The Ripper\" and the brutal \"Painkiller\" but also smoother songs like the rocking \"The Green Manalishi (With the Two-Pronged Crown)\" by Fleetwood Mac and the soulful ballad \"Diamonds and Rust\" by Joan Baez.\n\nOn the negative side, the band chemistry still sounds somewhat shaky in a few tracks as \"Electric Eye\" is a stuttering start and \"Metal Gods\" lacks enthusiasm. The first disc has its highs and lows while the second one sounds much more coherent and energetic. The new tunes from the Jugulator record don't sound as convincing on stage as on the courageous studio record as they are lacking their pitiless production and atmospheric vibes. The guitar play is overall solid but at times too much by the numbers and not adventurous enough for a live record in my book while the bass guitar is acceptable and the drum sound constantly great.\n\nIn the end, Judas Priest's Meltdown reflects the band's strengths and weaknesses throughout the nineties and is an authentic product of its time. It's certainly not among Judas Priest's best live albums but should appeal to anyone who would like to hear a talented new singer breathe new life into some timeless heavy metal classics. Faithful fans and collectors should purchase this release without any regrets but occasional listeners or newcomers should start with legendary Unleashed in the East.\n",
        "\nScreaming for Vengeance by Judas Priest is one of the hallmarks of heavy metal history and has influenced millions of bands since its release. Many mainstream critics choose to pay their attention to British Steel, however this album was much better and on top of that, more successful. Regardless of me being born in 1995, this album is easily one of my two favorite Priest albums with the other being Painkiller. Commercial-sounding or not, this album is pure gold and I'm going to explain why.\n\nScreaming for Vengeance has so many high points for a Judas Priest album with it's three big hits all deserving some mention. \"The Hellion / Electric Eye\" is not only the opener to this amazing record but it displays the return of the heavier side of Priest that was mostly absent from the lackluster Point of Entry. In my opinion, it's Priest's \"Highway Star\" similar to how \"Exciter\" was their \"Speed King\". The second single, \"(Take These) Chains\" is probably the most 80s sounding song on the album, mainly because I think of new wave bands whenever I hear it. The third single is Judas Priest's signature song, \"You've Got Another Thing Comin'\". This song is a really good example of a filler track that gained a large prominence, and is such a good song with a driving beat that whenever I hear it during workouts, it adds an extra bit of motivation.\n\nSpeaking of motivation, the musicians on Screaming for Vengeance have noticeably improved compared to the album's two predecessors. Dave Holland's drumming techniques are stronger on this record as his faster tempo is unleashed on songs like \"Riding on the Wind\" and the title track. The twin guitar attack of Glenn Tipton and K.K. Downing also improved with virtually every song having some of the best guitar play that Judas Priest did during the 80s, with \"Bloodstone\" getting bonus points for having some really catchy guitar riffs. The metal god Rob Halford screams for vengeance on this record as his vocals pierce the sky, even when you begin the title track on Side B. Ian Hill's bass playing is quite funky on this record with his best playing being on \"Fever\".\n\nAnother thing I love about this album besides the care that was put into this is the fact that (for an 80s metal album) there are no cover songs on the album. Not trying to say that the cover of Fleetwood Mac's \"The Green Manalishi\" or Joan Baez' \"Diamonds and Rust\" were bad, but I think Priest did the right thing with straying away from covers on this record. Since covers are usually filler tracks, I believe \"You've Got Another Thing Comin'\" is a perfect compromise for the two aforementioned covers being included on the legendary Unleashed in the East live album (the studio versions of \"The Green Manalishi\" and \"Diamonds and Rust\" were originally on Killing Machine and Sin After Sin respectively). I don't think Screaming for Vengeance would be as awesome as it is if the big hit wasn't on the album.\n\nBut when it comes down to the wire, Screaming for Vengeance is an album that not only defined metal music, but it's also one of the most important rock albums ever made. It served as an inspiration for bands of one of the most beloved metal subgenres known to man: power metal. Without this album, you'd probably have no Helloween or Blind Guardian as we know it. And the world would be 100% less manly, the score of this album's review.\n",
        "\nLess than two years after the lukewarm Redeemer of Souls, Judas Priest released live album Battle Cry that proves that the legendary British heavy metal quintet doesn't think about retiring yet and still delivers the goods on stage. The concert was recorded at the overrated Wacken Open Air, so you can't expect the most enthusiastic crowd but the atmosphere is better than expected because lead singer Rob Halford is simply a great entertainer that makes the sleepiest mainstream audience react. \n\nSeventeen songs were played that day and the DVD or BluRay even includes three additional tracks recorded in Poland that weren't played in Germany that night. The CD version of this release sadly only features fifteen songs and one has to wonder why the label didn't make this a double-disc record with all twenty tracks on it. The best version of this release to pick up is hence the combination of the DVD with the CD to have everything your ears and eyes need.\n\nThe set list is quite convincing. Even the tracks from the last effort sound more dynamic on stage and blend in relatively well with the classics. ''Dragonaut'' is a powerful opener, ''Halls of Valhalla'' is a fierce anthem with a varied vocal performance and even the unimaginative ''Redeemer of Souls'' is passable in its live rendition, even though it might be the weakest tune of this album.\n\nThe band obviously played numerous classics tracks. The crowd participation in ''Hell Bent for Leather'' is certainly a highlight. ''You've Got Another Thing Coming'' underlines how entertaining the band can be and never gets tedious despite an extended running time of above eleven minutes. The final track on the CD version is a relentless interpretation of ''Painkiller'' and it never ceases to amaze me how great Rob Halford's voice still sounds at his age.\n\nWhen playing a festival, it's difficult to insert tracks that are rarely played live but the band at least included a solid rendition of ''Devil's Child'' on this output. This version isn't spectacular but it's quite refreshing to hear such a song after a while and one has to congratulate the band on continuing to vary its set lists and bringing back forgotten pearls from time to time.\n\nIn the end, Judas Priest's Battle Cry isn't an essential record by any means. It might even be the band's weakest live album but that's just because all the others are so particularly great. However, it's a relief to hear and see the band in full strength after a disappointing last studio record. Those who were afraid that the band was about to retire can witness five musicians who still play with addictive passion.\n",
        "\nTurbo is essentially a decent album, but it's not 'real' Priest for me. I mean, let's consider the facts, Priest were probably the most important metal band between 1976 until 1984 - filling in that time period between thrash's dominance and Sabbath's post-Sabotage slump and creating so much of the stuff we take for granted (so much so that it seems so might forget just how much Priest gave us) and this album, simply, represents the start of their downfall (from which they never really recovered - sure, they managed to get a boner on Painkiller but it was not without much puffing and panting in the bathroom prior to that). Certainly, Point of Entry was the first chink in the armour - or was it that Rocka Rolla first showed they were willing to release an album they thought to have substandard production? - but that album merely lacked direction whereas Turbo shows the band actively following trends rather than starting them. \n\nTurbo was, for the first time, Priest showing themselves to no longer be leaders in the metal scene, but rather a band searching for direction.\n\nIt's not erroneous for those who consider this to be Priest's hair metal album; the LA DNA is certainly splattered all over this thing but there's also other aspects of the 80's mainstream rock zeitgeist here. I mean, the synths certainly have something of a resemblance to ZZ Top's incredibly successful and pretty damn cool Eliminator album. Hell, even KK's solo on 'Locked In' seems a little laidback and Gibbons-esque, especially in comparison to Glenn's more typical shredding. That's certainly cool, too, it shows they can play this style very effectively. And that, in itself, serves as a microcosm of Turbo; Priest can almost get away with it when you forget that this is Judas fucking Priest. \n\nOf course, some things can't be forgiven so easily. There was never any reason for a band with as much class as Priest to write something like 'Parental Guidance'. I mean, guys pushing 40 trying to write the aural equivalent of having an argument with your parents? Fucking shite. It sounds like something that Def Leppard would have left on the cutting room floor. 'Rock You All Around the World', again, aims for anthemic and ends up us trite. If only you would have stopped trying to speak to dunderheads in high school and write some real metal. \n\nAt its best, however, Turbo shows that Priest could be a great pop metal band (that point was proven by several tracks between '79 and '84, however). Particularly, it's great to see Halford spreading his wings in this new sound. The double tracked chorus on 'Locked In' and the whole very 80s but very cool chorus on 'Out in the Cold' work well for me. Again, it's weird to hear him going from a state-of-the-art metal performance on, say, 'The Sentinel' to very poppy material here. But man, Halford could sing the phone book and sell it well. \n\nKK and Glenn really let things slip here, though, it's just baffling hearing them go from writing the metal rule book to seeing them taking cues from Pete Willis and Steve Clark (good players in their own right, but not really heavy metal legends). I mean, the riff work on this album is flaccid in comparison to anything prior to this. I mean, what's the best riff here? 'Reckless', perhaps. Would that even make the top twenty best riffs on Screaming for Vengeance? And the best song on the album, 'Turbo', isn't really driven by the rhythm guitar at all. \n\nHonestly, Turbo is disappointing not due to an outright lack of quality, but rather a shift that reeks of finance. Priest were desperate to move on to a bigger audience at this point. Perhaps they thought they were really capable of a Pyromania style album? But that ignores the most important chapter in the \"How to Sell Out (and Get Away with It)\" book: you need to appease your old fans, too. In the documentary on the making of Metallica's eponymous album, the band and producer discuss how you need to have some songs on your sellout album that go back to an older style. I have a hard time believing that the Priest twin-turbo engine was running so low on fuel (gas, sorry, you were an American band at this point, right?). Then again, they did release the incredibly fucking poor Ram it Down (or, \"Turn it Off\" as I call it) two years later and that was apparently the 'harder' stuff meant for an aborted double album, so maybe that was it. Oh, well, nevermind. \n\nFile under: Saxon putting potatoes in the spandex.\n",
        "\nI won\u2019t go through the full history of the band, you can read about that anywhere. What I will say is that Judas Priest hit a steep decline after the release of their genre-defining Painkiller. Sure, there were a lot of good moments on a lot of records since then, but it felt as though Judas Priest, as we knew them, were basically out of rocket fuel at this point.\n\nWell, good news. Judas Priest is fucking back! For all the shortcomings of the post-Painkiller albums, they have finally gotten back to the basics. Now, here\u2019s the bad news. If you wanted Judas Priest to do something fresh and new, they didn\u2019t do that. This is the sequel to Painkiller, essentially. It has elements of most of their late-80\u2032s and early 90\u2032s output. It\u2019s blazing, muscular heavy metal with anthemic choruses and it\u2019s polished as hell.\n\nFirst off, let\u2019s talk production. That was the biggest issue on their previous album and it\u2019s been totally rectified here. Everything sounds larger than life and nicely polished without becoming sterile. For many Judas Priest veterans, that is probably reason enough to take interest in this record.\n\nRob Halford, the voice of heavy metal himself, sounds excellent here. His voice is used to great effect on this album. He has aged like a fine wine. His signature low-to-high vocal style totally intact. There are less falsettos on display in the front, but not to the detriment of anything. His mid-ranged vocals are full of venom and dripping with style. The use of vocal layering really stands out as a highlight. You will often here several Rob Halfords singing key parts of the song in different voices. Miraculously, it never becomes cheesy.\n\nThe guitar takes the lead when Halford isn\u2019t. While there are some really blazing riffs on some songs, it is mainly a mid-paced affair. That being said, even the mid-paced riffs are so driving, they feel as though they are charging down their enemies! There are a few power ballads, but not the sappy sort. They are epic, heroic anthems like the rest of the tracks. One minor disappointment is that the guitar doesn\u2019t stand out as much as it did on the classics. It feels more like a Halford album, in that regard, than a proper Judas Priest record.\n\nThis could have easily been my album of the year. The only thing that really prevented that, for me, were the abundance of songs. Fourteen tracks just felt like a few too many and I\u2019d have rather cut some of the fat. That being said, Judas Priest\u2019s Firepower is a must-listen for 2018. A totally anthemic heavy metal stomper, just like they used to make!\n",
        "\nThis is the first truly classic groove metal album since Cowboys From Hell. Took someone almost 30 fucking years, and I think that's proof perhaps the damn thing should stop here (I'm afraid I mean this regarding multiple entities here). Who'd of thunk that of all people we have long in the tooth and down one Kenneth Downing Judas Priest to set the perfect example. Perhaps that's an edict that ALL metal sub-genres should be following along on. ESPECIALLY the female fronted symphonic ones.\n\nIn case you think I'm kidding with the review title, let me inform you that Firepower is a VERY slow and groovy album compared to previous albums of the past (yes, even British Steel and Killing Machine). Issuing the Tazmanian Devil turnt-up tornado that was the title track as one of the first singles was probably the smartest (and ballsiest) move the band had made in a long time, but also the most misleading. Issuing Specter as a first single would have acted as a much more appropriate harbinger of what's to come.\n\nSpeaking of Specter, that's probably the highlight of this damn thing. That riff kicking in is what most scholars would classify as an INSTANT CRANK UP HEAD FUCK. Furniture, stuffed animals and waifus be very afraid when you hear this modern classic monster rolling through your neighborhood. Another highlight is Children of the Sun, with a slight recycling of lick from Voodoo Child, but goddamn is it an effective one. You know what else, the \"commercial songs\" (i.e. Never The Heroes, No Surrender) ain't too shabby either, being at the very least less lyrically cringey than Revolution. Wouldn't mind either of these taking off as a Living After Midnight of this generation. Then again, the first two songs mentioned in this paragraph would be fine car commercials too (with perhaps one or two customers even demanding to take the companies entire stock whilst hazy from heat stroke).\n\nThe negatives are the usual flaws i.e., too many songs, but there's not a whole lot of choices on what to cut. Flame Thrower sucks, that chorus melody change is really cheesy. Not to mention the song wants to be something from Painkiller so bad, but the problem is in order to be Painkiller, you have to be fast. Scott Travis ain't the new kid anymore, and I don't mean that in \"especially since an actual new guy came in about 5 ago.\" I will say this for current actual new Ritchie, if he helped write a majority of these riffs and songs, he's definitely earned his spot for Judas Priest and deserves to play along Glenn and/or KK on the Priest stage. Andy on the other hand...next. As for Rob, well, the metal God is damn near his 420s, so the days of full voice high registering through half an album have gone the ways of Lemmy, Jeff Hanneman, and Stan Lee. The screams are here though, and when you hear them you will shit bullion.\n\nLet me put it this way, this album was so good after KK Downing spilled the guts of what most of us in-the-know people knew about Glenn Tipton and Jayne Andrews, the collective fandom gave zero fucks when the dust cleared. Firepower is a fine Judas Priest album, and is probably the last great thing the band will ever put out. \n\n(But seriously Bill Curbishley, get KK back, it really ain't the same without one of them).\n",
        "\nHere I am again, reviewing another maligned and disliked Judas Priest album, and giving it a great score like the other ones. At this point I think my musical tastes may be out of whack, but whatever. Point of Entry, of course, came out about a year after the successful British Steel album. While British Steel is pretty much a hard rock/heavy metal album (though I would consider more hard rock), Point of Entry finds itself being a much more brisk and more poppy rock album. Though this does sound bad on paper for many, I think Judas Priest almost perfectly created a great commercially viable record that is fun and enjoyable to listen to.\n\nTo me, Judas Priest's strength has always been more so their song crafting prowess rather than their technicality. This is especially obvious with their 80's albums. The songs on Point of Entry are very representative of this fact. None of them are technically demanding at all (except the vocals, naturally). Each are a little short in length, and none exceed 5 minutes. However, they all are packed with awesome melodies and brisk guitar work. I think the greatest example of this is the first song on the album, Heading Out to the Highway. It has a relatively simple but catchy main riff, and the vocals take center stage throughout the song. All parts of the song, though, work together. And this brings me to the main reason why I like the album so much: It's very consistent, but each song is unique and fun. Even silly ones like You Say Yes are just stupidly enjoyable and I can't help but love the song. Don't Go, while being dismissed by others as being too much like an AC/DC song, is also a very groovy and great tune, and so is Troubleshooter. These are the best songs on Point of Entry.\n\nThe other great thing about Point of Entry is its production. Simply put, it is the best out of any of their albums. I heard they did this album while in Spain in some barn house makeshift studio. Apparently that's the secret to success in this field. The production isn't horribly different from British Steel, but the guitars have a bit more \"crunch\" to them (I think), and the album is also a bit more echoey and atmospheric, which benefits it a huge amount, in my opinion. Ian Hill is also very audible, probably the most he ever has been on a Priest record (along with Rocka Rolla, British Steel, Nostradamus, and Demolition).\n\nAs mentioned previously, individual performances are the tamest they have ever been on a Priest album. Riff wise, I suppose British Steel is not really much more complicated, but on that album a lot more power chords are used, as opposed to Point of Entry. Ian Hill's bass lines are still simple, but nice to hear. Dave Holland has always received criticism towards his drumming, often being compared to Phil Rudd, but it works really well here, as the album is simpler as a whole. Rob Halford, however, has not slowed down at all. In fact, this album some of their best vocal moments, just look at the choruses of Desert Plains and On the Run. He did a phenomenal job on this record. My really only criticism of Point of Entry are its lack of a lot of guitar solos. They could have used a lot more.\n\nI want to devote a small paragraph to the bonus track on the reissue, Thunder Road. Supposedly, it was replaced on Ram It Down by Johnny B. Goode, so there would be a single or something. Let me say, that was a horrible mistake. Thunder Road has to be one of Judas Priest's greatest songs. From the nice sing-a-long lyrics (just listen to that first verse), and to the epic chorus and solo, it makes no sense why they would have chosen to get rid of this song over others like Heavy Metal or Love Zone. But, that's how it is, so make sure to listen to this song!\n\nPoint of Entry is a very unlikable album to many JP fans; a result of the fact that it is their least metal album besides maybe the debut and Turbo. If approached with an open mind, however, Point of Entry is actually a really stunning example of Judas Priest's versatility. I recommend this album to people who love great melodies, and to those who listen to normal rock music. And to those that don't like either, please give it a chance; you may very well change your mind.\n",
        "\nJudas Priest is among the greats of heavy metal, being a forefather of the genre and influencing almost every metal band since in one way or another. Even though it's been almost half a century since their debut, it's still a big deal when they drop a new LP. Personally, Priest is one of my favorite bands of all time, and their monumental 1990 release, Painkiller, almost single-handedly piqued my interest in heavier music. However, I can't say I'm in love with their latest release: Firepower. Not that it's a bad album, or that I dislike it, but it's just something they've done before. Firepower is a collection of heavy riffs and anthemic choruses that's enjoyable, but overstays it's welcome, and is certainly nothing new. Depending on what you're looking for you may love this album, or you may be pretty lukewarm on it. I am of the latter variety.\n\nUpon my first listen of Firepower I would often get the urge to listen to Painkiller... and that isn't really a good thing. Firepower functions like many a Judas Priest album: driving guitar, bass, and drums, accompanied by Rob Halford's epic vocals, all packaged in easily digestible song structures. This, to me, is Firepower's biggest problem. The album is great if you've never heard Painkiller, Screaming for Vengeance, or any of their other classics from that era. But we've all already listened to those albums a million times haven't we? Don't get me wrong, the album is packed with with plenty of great guitar riffs, and loads of catchy vocal refrains, there's just nothing new or interesting enough to really warrant much excitement. On top of all this I also prefer the production of the aforementioned classics. Firepower is an example of good modern production, it's very punchy and easy on the ears while still feeling pretty lively. Yet I still prefer the more bombastic, arena sized production of their 80s material.\n\nFirepower also has some pretty severe length and overall structure problems, the almost one hour run time causes the album to more than overstay it's welcome. There's far too much similarity between tracks to justify the album going on for as long as it does. I noticed that by two-thirds of the way through I usually started to get bored and was ready to do something else. Considering the album does little in regard to album structure, it would've been all too easy to remove some of the later tracks. Outside \"Sea of Red\" very clearly being a closer, the rest of the tracklist just feels like a collection of tunes somewhat randomly sewn together. I can only fault Firepower so much for this as Priest has never exactly been a master of album structure, and their style of songwriting tends to lend itself to the \"just a collection of tracks\" method of album assembly anyway.\n\nHad one managed to have never heard Priest before, this album would likely blow them away. Rob Halford is in peak form, delivering some of the best vocal work of his career. He's in his sixties, yet somehow he still more than represents what one of the greatest metal vocalists of all time should sound like... the man is immortal, I swear. And you've got your classic soaring choruses on \"Rising from Ruins\" and \"No Surrender\" to prove it. The instrumentation is unrelenting, naturally, save for a few moments like the piano interlude: \"Guardians.\" Some of the finest guitar riffing being found on tracks like \"Evil Never Dies\" and \"Flamethrower.\" The drums never stood out to me, but get the job done. The lyrics are pretty standard Priest: very dramatic, a tad goofy at times, but ultimately self-aware and lovable.\n\nFirepower is a good Judas Priest album, maybe a great one, but it comes at a time when we've already heard numerous other great Judas Priest albums. If I want to listen to Priest I'm going to choose an older album over this one every time. Yet I think this album far surpasses other more recent outputs like Redeemer of Souls, so maybe it's good that this came around as an example of a solid modern Priest album. As much as I may criticize Firepower for not reinventing the wheel, I would still recommend every metal-head give it a listen. It's great while it's on, just nothing I think I'll find myself coming back to.\n",
        "\nFew would say this album is excellent. However, if we place it in its historical context we start to appreciate it, right? Stained Class supposes a certain rupture with the past, since that moment, Judas Priest would begin to do their own way on the heavy scene. Keep thinking, in 1978 were not Iron Maiden, Saxon, even Black Sabbath at their worst moment, the last one being their likely sources of inspiration, and the one which wandered through no man's land with Technical Ecstasy and Never Say Die, waiting for Dio who was able to bring new airs. Judas Priest is a band whose sermon of a social nature is sung by Rob Halford, the voice that overwhelms after his first tongue twisters (being famous at the end), of very accurate metrics and rhythm, undertaking his verbal tirade until reaching a moment when he seems to chew with eagerness what he sings, giving way to a ceremonial riff that'll inaugurate the imminent birth of a frenetic solo, be it from Tipton, be it from KK\u2026 unfortunately we\u2019re not talking about Sad Wings of Destiny. As much as I insist, in my judgment Stained Class is the most irregular work of Priest catalog, only surpassed by the lousy Ram It Down, but that's another business.\n\nTo open your mouth and stay with it open, Exciter presents one of their glorious pre/post bridges as the brand has been offering since the Sad Wings era, a fast-paced song which justifies the whole \u00e1lbum. It'd reach its sublimation as a perfect machinery under the name of Painkiller, another savior like this song, but coming soon as a whole musical genre. White Heat, Red Hot gets your feet back on the ground and sets to a lower level that'll be maintained for a good part of the album. Better By You, Better Than Me is a Spooky Tooth cover and was the reason which they were accused of suicide induction. In short, a real crime against art itself is to use music as a scapegoat for such macabre acts, although luckily some fans did not take it seriously after all, and that's why I'm still alive after hearing this. With the title track we left the bike for a while just to get a trot in a darker path. Musically, the change is not comparable to what Sad Wings supposed regarding Rocka Rolla, the intention of distancing themselves from previous influences affect fundamentally their appearance. They abandon the hippie aesthetic after a small stage of transition and adopt the leather and studs definitively. The gothic logo is replaced by a red one, more aggressive and known, which looks like it would prick you if you touch it. After two magisterial deliveries, I find Rob Halford very forced and out of tune in several moments, unforgivable from someone of such class.\n\nLittle by little I'm getting cold, and when I start to assume that I'm facing a not so good LP, it appears, like an ostrich-sized Easter egg, Beyond The Realms Of Death, a piece of shit which turns brutish and returns to set the bar where Exciter had left. The tip still missing, Heroes End is a compact closer for a record that most times doesn't seem particularly interesting but hey, it contains at least two or three really memorable songs. Interestingly, they released Killing Machine in the same year; I always thought what would happen if Priest waited a little longer to release Stained Class, it would have the heaviness of Killing and would be a good disc in the vein of British Steel, like a heavy metal band which writes heavy metal songs. Surely someone looked for a decent prequel to what they'd write in the eighties, a pity that this album is only a slight hint for that.\n\nI try to like it, however, the whole album is not as impressive as it might seem. Numerous unfortunate songs dotted here and there the \"stain\", case of poor Invaders with its pseudo-Hawaiian solo which doesn't help too much to raise the level of the album. Savage very simple and with Halford very out of tune, although with a good solo of KK. There are good solos by Tipton which save some moments but Rob mostly gives acute tones that don't convince because, again, he goes out of tune like a chicken. Stained Class announces new times and marks ways to face a harder future, but it is clearly inferior to Killing Machine and of course to the extraordinary Sin After Sin. Rob Halford is not up to his \"legend\" condition as what he is, the \"metal god\". This album is the least better of their 70s era. The evident big rooster Exciter, the solo of Beyond the Realms, and the majestic closer show the album purpose. There are people who say this is a record to enjoy quietly, for trained ears, the one that escapes from any genre, which supposedly is beyond the metal music, hell no. Far away from the impressive Sad Wings Of Destiny, this last does touche perfection. Well, I thought to rate it with 25%, but DonutBoy is generous, DonutBoy is genteel, so it deserves more than its own value, just for the aforementioned songs. Hope you to re-think after reading this.\n\n45/100\n3 out of 5 stars\nBeyond the Realms of Death 101/100\n",
        "\nI\u2019d like to respectfully dedicate this review to MA\u2019s contributor Diamhea, may he rest in peace.\n\nWith ten studio albums already under their belt (glittering belt, for Mr. Halford), Ram It Down arrived at a strange point in Judas Priest career. Commercially, they were at the top, touring world-wide and selling out arenas and whatnot. However, the most hardened metalheads out there were starting to lose their faith in the Priest, as the appalling Turbo seemed to be the end for the Brits high octane metal of old. Not many knew about the Twin Turbos project that never materialized, as their label decided against it. Thus, the fear remained that Judas Priest had sold out for good. But their eleventh studio release brought hope in the form of a chromed fist pounding the Earth, to demonstrate that no synthesizer could slay the metal in the Priest's heart. \n\nIndeed, some of the heavy/speed metal tunes recorded for that double album that never came to be, appear here, and a couple of them prove to be excellent. First and foremost, \u201cRam It Down\u201d itself is truly a treat; a speedy opener that drenches the listener in adrenaline and awe, with an exciting and explosive multi-part solo by Glenn and K.K. in their signature 'now its my turn' formula. I remember listening to this material for the first time, after already experiencing the mighty Painkiller. The title-track deceived me into dreaming (ha!) I was in for a previous form of the famed 1990 album. But then, \u201cHeavy Metal\u201d appears, and after another monstrous introductory solo, the remnants of Turbo rear their ugly head for the first time on the record. The riffs are ok, but the song has a strange industrial/synth feel that doesn't really scream 'HEAVY METAL!' as it should. The mid-section solo is badass, again, but there's just something weird about the sound of the vocals uttered in this one by the Metal God, and the robotic percussion doesn't convince. \n\nIndeed, it is known a drum machine was used here even if Dave Holland is given credit. I have my doubts he could manage that super fast double bass in \u201cHard as Iron\u201d in a live environment, my favorite song here along with the title-track. But the drums sound too robotic as well. Fortunately, this would be Holland's last album, replaced by the much superior and less polemic Scott Travis. In any case, the songs (and the percussion in particular) have too much 80s reverb for their own good, and perhaps that's why the band declined to use Mr. Allom's services for their 1990 masterpiece. It's not too bad of a production, but makes the music extremely dated, even more so than Defenders of the Faith and all the previous records all they way back to their 70s. Just check out \u201cLove Zone\u201d or \u201cCome and Get it\u201d, which unsurprisingly sound like Turbo leftovers. \n\nI haven't stressed enough the fact that \u201cHard as Iron\u201d kicks major ass, a speed metal obliterating tune that's been criminally forgotten by the band and its vast majority of fans. It would find itself like a fish in the water in Painkiller, and I can only imagine how it would slay even more with Tsangarides (may he also rest in peace) mixing. \u201cBlood Red Skies\u201d is another industrial-ish track that originally lasted over ten minutes (that version came as a bonus track somewhere, later, but I haven't listened to it yet), and this album's incarnation at almost eight minutes long became their longest studio track of all their 80s material. It's a dark, cyberpunk-influenced composition, that despite feeling kinda alien to the rest of the Priest catalogue, somehow it manages to inspire respect and be enjoyable. It starts as a tranquil ballad and then some electronic beats change its face entirely at the 1:15 mark. Mr. Halford's vocals become sexy whispers (uuuhhh) amidst its synthetic mid-pace, as he describes a Terminator-esque dystopia\u2026 while sounding closer to Cyndi Lauper than to what King Diamond was doing at the time. It's strange to admit it, but I dig this tune.\n\nThe rest of the album carries on with its lows and mild highs, though side B is stronger than side A, and not only because of \u201cBlood Red Skies\u201d. \u201cI'm a Rocker\u201d is a typical rockstar-life anthem, but it's a solid composition, and I enjoyed the band playing it live a couple of years ago. Doomy and slow-paced closer \u201cMonsters of Rock\u201d, seems to pay homage to Black Sabbath in some way, as it describes the advent of heavy metal music\u2026 oddly, in a much more metal way than track no. 2, \u201cHeavy Metal\u201d. \u201cLove You to Death\u201d you can do without. And finally, the much publicized and polemic version of Chuck Berry's \u201cJohnny B. Goode\u201d, which seems to be loved and hated with equal measure. I'm on the first group here, I honestly like what they did with it, with the melodies after the main solo combining nicely with the classic rock guitar work that preceded them. \n\nIt feels really strange for me to say this, but I think our beloved Halford's vocals in this one are the element which excites me the least, whereas Ian Hill's bass tone is strangely satisfying (when audible). Tom Wilkinson's artwork promises some rapid fired metal, and some rapid fired metal is what you get here\u2026 sporadically. Ram It Down may not be perfect, and has some really embarrassing moments, but it's a big step towards eliminating the bitter drink that was their previous studio release, as well as setting the bases for their ultimate creation at the turn of the decade. Like the solid metal clenched fist, the first of many cover images crafted by Mr. Wilkinson for the Priest (for good or bad, relieving Doug Johnson's iconic style), Ram It Down pounds with the might of the often ignored jewels it holds, and bears some solid metal numbers enough to warrant some listens.\n",
        "\nSince the early 1980s, Judas Priest has had their ups and downs. Despite the legendary status of the early records, inconsistency has plagued the band\u2019s output for years. They still can create good metal records, but it all depends on what they seem to be chasing at the time, whether it\u2019s hit singles, high-minded concepts, or just the latest heavy music trend. For every \u201cDefenders of the Faith\u201d there\u2019s a \u201cTurbo\u201d. For every \u201cRedeemer of Souls\u201d there\u2019s a \u201cNostradamus\u201d. With Faulkner replacing KK Downing several years ago, and Tipton\u2019s recent health issues, the notion of a modern metal classic from the Priest camp seemed forever unlikely.\n\nDespite all of this, the idea of two producers prove to be a saving grace. The combination of Andy Sneap and Tom Allom are somehow able to forge a quality metal record from the mighty Priest. Firepower is a powerful, gripping modern metal record with plenty of sly nods to Priest\u2019s early days. \n\nThe real magic of the album lies in the slower grinders. Take \u201cSpectre\u201d, it\u2019s wispy melody and thrilling harmonized solos recalling early classic \u201cThe Ripper\u201d. \u201cTraitor\u2019s Gate\u201d is pure, unadulterated headbangers delight, Halford\u2019s deadly bark soaring over irresistible crunching riffs like its\u2019 1982 all over again. But the tour de force is \u201cRising From Ruins\u201d, starting with a piano intro \u201cGuardians\u201d to get things going Sad Wings style. It leads to a slow burning, metallic masterpiece, the clean guitars during the verses teasing a melody like \u201cVictim of Changes\u201d before moving into an anthemic chorus \u2013 \u201cWe\u2019re standing as one / We\u2019re carrying on / Rising from Ruins\u201d one of Priest\u2019s best to date. Headbanging lives in 2018, who\u2019d have thought it?\n\nWhile some of the faster cuts on the album (\u201cFlamethrower\u201d, \u201cFirepower\u201d) are decent, the faster the band seems to play, the more the subtle nuances of this marriage of past and present get lost. At any rate, at least half of this album represents an incredible return to form, melding the classic with the here and now. Exciting stuff.\n",
        "\nSince Judas Priest reunited with Rob Halford in 2003, the band has still been putting out some pretty good music. However, none of the past three releases have really wowed me. Firepower, on the other hand, was completely unexpected. This is one of hell of an impressive album, and I am greatly pleased as a long time fan. \n\nThe style here is everything we've always loved about Judas Priest, but it still sounds amazingly fresh and creative. Without question, Rob Halford's performance here is by far the greatest aspect of the album. He sounds pretty damn close to how he sounded on Painkiller, which is incredible considering his age. The high pitched screaming is less in quantity but very high in quality. Most of the songs are sung at a moderately high pitch, with the occasional ear-piercing falsetto scream thrown in at all the right places. He still can belt pretty damn high most of the time, and from what I've heard he is still doing very well on tour. \n\nI honestly love every song on the album. They're short, sweet, and very well written. And, like the Painkiller album, there are no soft songs, with the exception of \"Guardians\", which, actually is just the intro to \"Rising from Ruins\", and the final song on the album - the beautiful, passionate ballad \"Sea of Red\". For me, there are 4 magnificent songs - \"Lightning Strike\", \"Never the Heroes\", \"Flame Thrower\", and \"Never Surrender\". All the rest are still really fucking great. I really can't think of anything bad to say about any one song on the album, which is really quite remarkable.\n\nSeeing as though Rob Halford dominates the whole album with his kickass voice and lyrics, I suppose one could offer some slight criticisms in regards to the degree of musical virtuosity of the other band members, when compared to some of Priest's other records. I myself am not a guitar player, so I'm probably not the best person to judge the quality of the guitar solos. I can just say that I very much enjoyed everything I heard. Without question, the blazing guitar sounds of Painkiller tears Firepower's lead guitars apart. However, a good song is still a good song, and if it can succeed in making me enjoy it, and it does, then I still can't even really complain here either. Additionally, there's some pretty damn nice drumming throughout the album, and when Scott Travis plays a good fill, it definitely gets noticed. \n\nAll in all, it is a very enjoyable album to listen through, from start to finish. Highly recommend.\n",
        "\nExcuse me if I had doubted the Metal Gods, but my expectations weren't that high for their 18th studio LP after the lukewarm Redeemer of Souls, which itself came six long years after the maligned Nostradamus, their symphonic metal experiment gone not that bad. Firepower does have a magnificent eye-catching cover artwork by Chilean artist Claudio Bergamin, worthy of all accolades, managing to lift the spirits of doubtful fans as well as to modernly recall previous metallic beasts of the Priest back catalogue, like the Hellion, the Metallian or the Painkiller. In addition, this new metallic bad boy has all the intention of utter obliteration, his dynamic stance starkly contrasting with the three previous cover characters, who seemed content to stare back to the onlooker in a passive, self-righteous way. Thus, the art faithfully reflects the Priest approach in this, fairly entertaining and fiery modern 'comeback' release. \n\nFirepower is not as intense as Painkiller, as some have claimed, but it is indeed the one album released after that gorgeous milestone of all things metal that resembles it the most\u2026 not so much in speed, as in attitude. In particular, the searing combo of the inaugural three blasts of \u201cFirepower\u201d, \u201cLightning Strike\u201d and \u201cEvil Never Dies\u201d are a headbang-fest of prime Priest quality, and they'll be quite a treat to witness in a live environment. The title-track and \u201cLightning Strike\u201d are the more speed-oriented songs, as there are many mid-paced and even slow-paced compositions that are, nonetheless, excellent for the most part. \u201cEvil Never Dies\u201d is probably my favorite composition of the whole album, with a catchy-as-fuck chorus in which the Metal God uses a very aggressive intonation, not unlike in \u201cAll Guns Blazing\u201d, with a magnificent set of riffs to go along. The four-minute song even manages to showcase an elegant and calm breakdown gracefully placed in its mid-section. After that, great tune after great tune just keep comin' at ya! \n\nThere's a monumental chorus to be found in \u201cNever the Heroes\u201d, followed by the nefarious \u201cNecromancer\u201d, one of the heavier tunes here, in which the riffs steal the show. \u201cSpectre\u201d should have been the last 007 flick's main theme, hands down! As the lyrics say, 'in a league of its own'. It has a creepy melody that recalls the mid-section of \u201cThe Ripper\u201d, cross-bred with the whispered part in \u201cNight Crawler\u201d. \u201cTraitors Gate\u201d is the quintessential mid-paced example of heavy metal epicness, five an a half minutes of non-stop fist pumping and head banging, not without a sense of melancholy and grandeur enforced by its simple but effective lyrics, usual Priest business. The concise \u201cNo Surrender\u201d has a similar pace and style, with a more uplifting character. I can't recommend a particular guitar solo in the whole album\u2026 because all of them kick ass! Ritchie Faulkner seems to have been given more liberties here, and his varied array of techniques greatly complement riff-master Tipton's, in a way that reminds me of good \u2018ole K.K. And Scott Travis still has enough gas in his tank to severely punish the pair of bass drums from his kit.\n\nBut it's not all perfect, and the album does get a little bit monotonic for moments, however scarce. \u201cRising from Ruins\u201d is like a slow, epic, modern power metal track that is enjoyable but not particularly memorable. \u201cFlame Thrower\u201d disappointed me, since it has such a cool (but generic) title, and despite the great swaying riffs, it has a hard rock-ish feel that reminds me of \u201cRevolution\u201d from Angel of Retribution, the lyrics not clicking that good with its chosen musical style. \u201cChildren of the Sun\u201d sounds strangely stoner-esque, an experiment not particularly enticing to my ears. In its favor, however, the mid-section breakdown has some of the most notorious bass guitar playing by Ian Hill I've heard in their entire career, and I'm glad he got a good presence due to the stupendous production and mixing of the record, the work of the returning Tom Allom. No surprise this albums sounds MASSIVE and there's just not a damn flaw about it. Finally, closer \u201cSea of Red\u201d has a good use of acoustic and electric guitars but I feel it losses the mark by a hair because it is a tad too cheesy.\n\nIn many ways, Firepower is a triumphant return to form by the Metal Gods, and given the advanced state of their illustrious career and the fact they could call it quits without nothing more to prove, it shows their real intent to remain relevant, potent and on the top of metal royalty. Personally, it is my second favorite, second Halford era release, after Angel of Retribution, since that 2005 comeback release represented such a welcomed re-emergence of the classic heavy metal band I cherish the most (along with Iron Maiden), and despite its flaws, I found some of its compositions and experiments, like \u201cJudas is Rising\u201d, \u201cAngel\u201d, \u201cHellrider\u201d and \u201cLochness\u201d, marginally more powerful and memorable than any track here, but still, from an honest and general point of Priest fanbase's view, there's no doubt Firepower will be a more cherished record, with its red hot aesthetic intact, classic in spirit but with a modern outer armor.\n",
        "\nWhen English dogs wanted to sound like US poodles... Just look at the band photos from this era! The guys didn't have enough hair to compete in the Big Hair League (TM), but they certainly wanted to sound like hair bands.\n\nOkay, North America was a huge possible market for metal music, and it surely was noticed by record labels and managers of good artists and bands hailing from good old England. Just think about Def Leppard and Ozzy Osbourne. But Judas Priest? Judas fucking Priest! There cannot be any other reason for these atrocities but sweet, sweet US$. Okay, the band was always looking for news ways to make heavy metal and rock music, but some roads should have left untraveled. But what's done is done...\n\nThis album includes heavy use of guitar synthesizers. Not the first time for the band, but more extensively than before. A good example is cold-sounding yet hot-souled 'Turbo Lover'. Its machine-like, irresistible thumping rhythm, steely guitar licks and Rob Halford's unique vocals made the song legendary. It still sounds British enough, but already on the second track, 'Locked in', them glam/hair rock traits come on stronger. They come to make the music fluffier, not stronger.\n\nPoppy guitar playing, their airy and syrupy tones, and love lyricism abound (the opener went straight for sex anyway). 'Private Property, 'Parental Guidance', 'Rock You All around the World' and 'Wild Nights, Hot & Crazy Days' show Judas Priest peaking those \"sweet\" levels of sex, syrup and rock 'n' roll, the US way. Images of sunny Venice Beach, with people wearing \u00fcber-colourful clothes and massive hairdos, that's what these songs conjure. Plus rolleskaters... And definitely not motorbikers! That vibe is a big part of the album, and while other songs have more familiar JP vibe to them, many contain heavy glam rock elements. It just sounds too much like Van Halen, Poison or any other cream-assed glam rock band at times. So, This was a cash grab, period. Maybe there was something to do with the choice of recording studio, which was Compass Point Studios in Nassau, Bahamas... But then again, JP's mighty contender, Iron Maiden, recorded their three legendary and epic albums there, and they definitely contain no glam, not one bloody bit!\n\nSlower and more heavy metal-ish, somewhat eerie 'Out in the Cold' contains a lengthy guitar synthesizer intro and fine symbiosis of guitarists K.K. Downing and Glenn Tipton. Generally, there is no shortage of great soloing, as expected. The thing about JP's guitar solos is that that they are melodic and memorable, being really composed, not just shredded out as fast as possible. However, machiney guitar tones make the album often softer and lighter that it would be with the real crunch. On the whole, this was an experiment gone too far, because sometimes the album feels like \"spot the guitar\" game. 'Hot for Love' sounds streetwise, despite for its title, and is the bright shining star of the album. And the closer 'Reckless' comes close. These two songs also were b-sides of the singles cut from the album, 'Turbo Lover' and 'Locked in', by the way, so the band knew what was the best material here (with 'Out in the Cold' if you ask me). So, majority of the album is glam-infested. But, fine bonus track 'All Fired up' is another saviour, reminding of previous albums' stuff.\n\nRob Halford sounds more or less strained on this album, especially when he goes to higher notes. Uniqueness of his voice does help to some point, but his abuse of drugs and alcohol can be heard. This point was brought up on \"Behind the Music\" television series, so I'm not judging it, just telling the truth. Surely, there are some neat high-pitched helium-shrieks and screams heard here, too, but here his lower frequencies work better. Dave Holland was a drummer with simplistic styles. He did provide the beat here, for sure, but bassist Ian Hill give it life with his playing, that is sometimes straight, and at others more finger-twisting. The rhythm section made the guitar synthesizer-plagued album sound meatier, surely. This remaster's sound is very clear, but the lower end is what it is.\n\n'Turbo Lover' is one of the most played songs by the band on radio and TV channels, and that's why it is easy to buy the album; it's simply a fine single. Sadly, the majority of the songs have too much pink bubblegum in them trying to keep them together. Far from the essential JP albums in general. When you buy the two singles cut off of this, you'll get 4 best songs, but miss 'Out in the Cold'. But then again, this is sold cheap as dirt these days (including great 'All Fired up', 'Locked in' live version and very short liner notes; please note, that score is given with these extras, especially 'All Fired up' getting it up a bit). There's also more extensive reissue with 2CD live out which might not be as cheap...\n\n(Originally written for ArchaicMetallurgy.com)\n",
        "\nI would first like to dispel the possible notion that Priest are trying to capitalize on nostalgia by having an opening that is identical in feel to Painkiller and album art that is a bastardization of Screaming For Vengeance. These could be seen as cringeworthy attempts to cash in on old successes (just as Sonata Arctica did when they started putting wolves back on their album covers but decided to start sucking) if the music wasn\u2019t so goddamn good. Judas Priest have become the living definition of \u2018talking the talk\u2019 and \u2018needing no introduction\u2019, having influenced and pioneered basically the entire genre and all the imagery that comes with it. Since Halford returned to the fold with the brilliant Angel Of Retribution, their output has been solid, but never reached a point where all fans could honestly say they were satisfied. Even though I absolutely loved Nostradamus, it seemed experimentation might not be the way to go for the British legends. Good old-fashioned heavy metal with riffs, solos, catchy choruses and screams is the realm in which Priest belong, and Firepower has absolutely got you covered (then again, my favourite Priest album is Jugulator so what do I know?).\n\nThis album is brilliant. How refreshing to hear a heavy metal album here in 2018 that does away with excessive bells and whistles to focus on the core of the genre we love. Furthermore, how satisfying that it comes from the group frequently hailed as the \u2018Metal Gods\u2019. There\u2019s something grossly vindicating about Judas Priest showing any newcomer who considers themselves within the NWOBHM perimeters exactly how it should be done. This new record kicks off with the one-two punch of the title-track and \u201cLightning Strike\u201d, which may as well be \u201cPainkiller\u201d and \u201cHell Patrol\u201d for the 21st century. The former is a rapid-fire (pun intended) monster which should instantly zip the mouths of naysayers; and the latter is a galloping anthem with one of the best riffs on the album (2:25 \u2013 simplicity is the key!). Instead of dropping the ball, Priest opted to keep the energy rolling by knocking out tune after tune of some of their most metal work since 2005. The steamroller riffage of the menacing \u201cEvil Never Dies\u201d is especially headbang-worthy.\n\nThe production quality is absolutely spot on. Scott Travis\u2019 legendarily precise kit-work is a pillar of reliability; Ian Hill\u2019s bass rumbles underneath satisfactorily \u2013 receiving a few shining moments here and there; Tipton and Faulkner brought a plentiful bag o\u2019 riffs with them, all in that classic Priest, blues-scale vein \u2013 beefed up by the band\u2019s meatiest tone since Jugulator. Naturally, Halford\u2019s voice was predicted to be a huge talking point, after his waning performance on 2014\u2019s Redeemer Of Souls. Within seconds, the icon proves his credentials as Metal God. In this humble reviewer\u2019s opinion, this is the best he\u2019s ever sounded. Bold statement, I know, but I\u2019ve always been a fan of his lower range, and his increasing age just means he spends more time in a controlled area. The ear-piercing screams are still present, sprinkled effectively throughout Firepower \u2013 (especially the chorus line of \u201cSpectre\u201d). For god\u2019s sake, the man is 66 years old! Hill is 67 and Tipton is a mighty 70! The sheer quality oozing out of these veterans is incredible and fills me with faith for the future.\n\nStructurally, this album is so well crafted. Starting off are five dynamic gems (especially the truly evil-sounding \u201cNecromancer\u201d whose main riff sounds eerily like Iron Mask\u2019s \u201cHoly War\u201d), then dipping the vibrancy down a tad for the hymnal \u201cChildren Of The Sun\u201d and the beautiful interlude \u201cGuardians\u201d, just to end on a flourish with blazers like \u201cFlamethrower\u201d and \u201cNo Surrender\u201d. It\u2019s this latter half of the album that cynics have latched onto for their criticism. Sure, the lyrics aren\u2019t stunning, but who actually gives a shit? Just shout some stuff about fire and steel that we can all shout along with, then get on with the hefty riffs and blazing solos. Tracks eight through fourteen have been accused of \u2018fizzling out\u2019\u2026and I\u2019m starting to think the naysayers have genuinely been listening to a different record. Perhaps it\u2019s because the album ends with the epic, balladic \u201cSea Of Red\u201d? But when you\u2019ve got the hulking groove of \u201cLone Wolf\u201d to precede it \u2013 with one of Priest\u2019s greatest riffs ever \u2013 you have no valid point.\n\nRight here, we have the perfect fusion of Painkiller and 2005\u2019s Angel Of Retribution. The chugging riffage, Halford\u2019s badass attitude and iconic vocal tone, the mid-tempo swaggers, the awesome album art\u2026 It\u2019s all like a dream come true. I don\u2019t see how even the die-hards who insist on listening to only \u201970s Priest couldn\u2019t find some tasty morsels on Firepower. They\u2019ve done away with the experimental flabbiness, the overly-flowery melodies and cheesy \u201980s synth, and provided us with nothing but pure, unadulterated, riff-centric heavy metal. If this doesn\u2019t please the masses, then I don\u2019t want to live on this planet anymore. A planet which, I might add, Judas Priest rule once more. Halford and co. are absolutely killing it in the studio \u2013 whether or not this will translate to a live environment remains to be seen \u2013 and all is right with the world. All hail the Metal Gods! Now, all together: \u201cFI-YA-POW-WAH!! MAN\u2019S DE-MIIIISE!\u201d\n",
        "\nSo here we go, my first Judas Priest album review. Until a few weeks ago, I never would have imagined that my first one would be Firepower. After all, I generally don't even bother to listen to new albums by bands that I think are past their prime, and in my opinion Judas Priest's prime was over when the calendar hit 1980. Sure, British Steel has a few good songs, and the same can be said of Screaming For Vengeance, but everything else in that decade just doesn't interest me. But I took a chance on this, and boy am I pleasantly surprised!\n\nThis album sounds like how 80s Priest should have been in my mind. Ballsy, tight, catchy, menacing, slick, satisfyingly familiar, and fabulously produced. From the opening seconds of Firepower you know exactly what you're in for, yet that's an attraction, not a knock. The opening guitar riff draws you in, and then before you know it Halford enters with a trademark yell and you're properly hooked.\n\nThis album is loaded with lots of catchy riffs and great solos. The guitar tone is excellent, and generally Tipton and Faulkner leave nothing to be desired. While most of the songs have a mixture of crunchy and bright metallic guitar tones, the tone on \"Lone Wolf\" is particularly dark and Sabbath-esque. There are also many great melodies, which are at times admittedly a bit cliched sounding, but not to the point that it's a problem (ask me again in 10 years though). A couple of guitar solos that particularly stood out include those on \"Children Of The Sun\" and \"Spectre\", but in all honesty there are several more of note.\n\nThe drumming is very competent, and finds a great balance between holding back and keeping time, to all out blistering attacks. The opening song is a great example of this balance, and sets the tone for the rest of the album. I don't know much of Scott Travis's other Priest repertoire (other than some stuff from Painkiller of course) but I can safely say that he does a more than satisfactory job here.\n\nPerformance wise, it's Rob Halford's vocals that make this worth owning. While the guitar riffs are indeed catchy, the playing competent, and the songs easily accessible, I tend to think that this album would just sound like a cliched metal album if not for Halford's incredible vocal performance. He really does shine, and it's his greatness that makes this album a keeper. His ability to sound menacing and intense in both the lower and higher registers is extremely impressive, even when judged against his earlier work. His growls during the slow breakdown near the end of \"Evil Never Dies\" sounds like something out of a Megadeth song\u2014if Dave Mustaine actually had a good voice.\n\nWhile to me it's mostly a throwback to how they did/should have sounded in the 80s, there's also the obvious nod to 70s Priest with the piano track \"Guardians\", which is a perfect intro for the crunchy, and catchy, \"Rising From Ruins\". For that matter, some of Travis's drum work is reminiscent of Painkiller, but in general this is like 80s Priest. Just 80s Priest that I actually enjoy listening to all the way through the album.\n\nThe only thing that this album really suffers from is it's formulaic predictability, and my suspicions that it won't age well. But the former is also one of it's strengths, and the later cannot be verified for years to come, so I digress with my criticism.\n\nFavourite tracks: \"Firepower\", \"Lightning Strike\", \"Lone Wolf\", and \"Sea Of Red\"\n\nLeast Favourite track: \"Never The Heroes\"\n",
        "\nRam It Down is rather an interesting release. Riding off of the success of Turbo, Judas Priest decided to take the remainder of songs they had (which were heavier and faster) and put them into another full-length release. To many, this album was better than Turbo (not my opinion, personally), but to the masses it was still kind of generic and kind of stagnant. Though I would say this is probably my least favorite Judas Priest album, it still manages to be awesome, despite some minor flaws. \n\nTo get my issues with Ram It Down out of the way, there are two things that hold it back: The production and the drum machine used on the album. The production on Ram It Down, while kind of 80's sounding and cool, just manages to sound somewhat bad. I think there may be too much reverb, or the aforementioned drum machine is dragging it down. For whatever reason, Dave Holland decided not to commit to Ram It Down, so a drum machine was used. Though it does play more complex stuff than Holland ever did in Judas Priest, It sounds extremely lifeless and annoying. It made my first listen to the album almost unbearable, really. However, I got used to it over time, though it still gets on my nerves sometimes.\n\nBesides those two hitches, the actual songwriting and performances on this album are spot on. This is probably Rob Halford's most high pitched vocal delivery (in a consistent manner) since Stained Class, and he definitely is the main highlight of Ram It Down (like he is in most Judas Priest albums.) The riffs provided by K. K. and Glenn are good, but they aren't as memorable as they could have been. Ian Hill is still kind of plodding around like usual, being pretty hard to hear (which is also normal). And then of course, there is the crappy drum machine.\n\nEveryone talks about \"Blood Red Skies\" as the main highlight of Ram It Down, which I'd have to agree with. I didn't really like it at first, but I grew to enjoy it immensely (this is the only track where the drum machine actually sounds pretty good.) \"Monsters of Rock\" is also a highlight: The drum machine creates an interesting pattern, and Rob Halford gives kind of a subdued but powerful vocal performance (the songs about actual monsters of rock, not some rock star sort of thing.) The other main highlights are the title track and \"Hard As Iron.\" They are fastest songs on the album, and they work to near-perfection. I don't mind the cover of \"Johnny B. Goode\", but \"Thunder Road\" was originally supposed to be where the cover is on the album (and it is a much better song, believe me.) The other songs, while being cheesy, still manage to be quite \"Heavy Metal\" (get it!?) The two live tracks tacked on to the reissue are fine, I guess.\n\nThough it still is a great album, Ram It Down has a few glaring issues which hold it back from a higher rating for me. The production and its drum machine are quite irritating, but if you can get past these issues, there is a heap of boiling hot metal lying in wait. It is their worst, but it still provides for a great listening experience. Priest has always managed to be consistently awesome from the beginning to their near end.\n",
        "\nThere's probably 4 or 5 albums in existence that I can honestly say are perfect, and Screaming for Vengeance is one of them. Perfection doesn't come easily; I've got standards. First of all, I'm way too impatient for tracks that don't quite measure up to the rest of the disc. If tracks 5 and 7 are head-stomping awesome, guess what? Track 6 is probably going to be skipped often because frankly, why wait? That knocks an album down a notch. And I'm fickle, too. For example, it took me awhile to really catch on to the greatness of Queensr\u00ffche's Operation Mindcrime. I admit it. It sat on my desk for 6 months, and then it suddenly clicked and I couldn't get it out of my head for a year. There might be a hundred other albums that are amazing but for whatever reason didn't penetrate my thick head. You can't very well rate an album as perfect if you don't hear it now can you? On the other hand, some discs just wear out over time. Symphony X's Paradise Lost played constantly in my car for months when it was released. Now I'm rather indifferent to it. The same can be said for Destruction's Infernal Overkill, which has aged poorly and is relegated to the dark recesses of my iTunes catalog, but used to receive regular play way back when. I thought Kreator's Pleasure to Kill was the ultimate violent outburst of thrashy awesomeness. It's still awesome but not quite as 'ultimate.'\n\nTo rate something as perfect every damn song has to be worthy every time the disc is played. I've got to want to play it from beginning to end, and not just cherry-pick the top 3, 4, or even 5 tracks. When I create a playlist it's a given that I drag the whole album over. And it's got to slay my brain the same today as when I first heard it. Thirty years have to go by and even then I've got to feel like a newly-spawned metalhead teenager playing that album. Fucking impossible. Classic, milestone metal albums often don't exist in that kind of rarified air. Kill 'Em All and The Number of the Beast can't measure up to that standard. Bonded By Blood doesn't quite get there. But Screaming for Vengeance makes it over the hump.\n\nThis record is actually a dramatic change from what Priest had been doing, having reached a career peak with Hell Bent for Leather, following it up with a British Steel record that was well-crafted but contained a considerable helping of radio-friendly cheese, and then completely tanking out with the horrifyingly lame Point of Entry. It's like Screaming for Vengeance was a stab from the grave, as the coffin lid was being shut with \"here lies a band that used to be metal\" written in epitaph upon it. It felt like one last cry against the fading light as the metal genre moved into a new era, threatening to leave them behind. Many bands would have whimpered and died, perhaps with a final batch of iffy tunes lacking in creativity or inspiration. But not The Mighty Priest. With Screaming for Vengeance, in one stroke, Judas Priest pounded their already hefty legend into the firmament like few bands have ever done 8 albums into their career. They climbed up from the grave and soared all the way into the sky in a blaze of glory, all in the space of about a calendar year. Interestingly, they would do so yet again with Painkiller, which just further proves how indestructible this band was over and above any other act outside of Black Sabbath or Iron Maiden.\n\nScreaming for Vengeance is a muscular, pile-driving experience from start to end owing in equal parts to a top-notch production, varied and thoughtful songwriting, a driving pace, and Halford's sick, over-the-top delivery. Gone are cheesy commercial songs like \"Heading Out to the Highway\" and \"Living After Midnight,\" which frankly made everyone uncomfortable since the tracks were just caricatures, like walking around town wearing a cartoon mask of yourself. Gone are the weak-ass lyrics of \"Hot Rockin'\" because, well, it sucked and like I said, Screaming for Vengeance is \"a case of do or die.\" There is no time for anthems like \"United\" either: too slow and not pissed off enough.\n\nInstead, upon pushing play, \"The Hellion\" roars forth with its iconic soaring melody and crushing chords, evoking apocalyptic visions of fire and glory. \"Electric Eye\" follows quickly with power chord crashes underneath Tipton's classically-inspired opening riff, and we've achieved blastoff. After that there's no doubt you're in for a metallic slab of red meat with no veggies on the side. You're in the hands of the masters. And they are going to deliver a lesson in how to do metal, and do it right. You thought they were done? Think again, pal.\n\nEvery song is carved on to the platter in its perfect place, and each one has its own distinct personality. Hard-charging songs like the title track and \"Electric \"Eye\" are balanced out beautifully with more thoughtful and intricate pieces like \"Bloodstone\" and \"Fever.\" Snarling anger and disdain is dealt out in abundance, but topics like world politics and heartbreak are slotted in to break things up, just at the right time. Most bands put together a group of songs like a baseball lineup. The best songs go at the top and it goes downhill from there, with the exception of that one guy who is having a surprise breakout season sitting near the bottom of the lineup. With this album, side B is arguably the better of the two, containing the rip roaring metalfest that is \"Screaming for Vengeance\" followed by the iconic \"You've Got Another Thing Comin'\" and ending with one of my favorite Priest tunes ever in \"Devil's Child.\" Throw in \"Fever\" - the most unique song on the record - and you've got a B side that any band would proudly feature at the top of their set list. There wasn't a need to cover up a weak tune, so they just put everything together into a complete work. If ever there was an album that iTunes should disallow single song downloads, it's this one. You can't just pick out \"You've Got Another Thing Comin'\" and \"Electric Eye\" and say you know Screaming for Vengeance. You may as well grab two ears and an eyeball and say you know the person's face.\n\nWidely acknowledged as one of the top metal vocalists of all time, Screaming for Vengeance might be the greatest moment in Halford's career. This is the album where the ferocity of the music finally caught up with his capabilities. For years he had been astonishing audiences with his range and delivery, but it was here where the only approach that would work is to combine his considerable range and power with equal shares of piss and vinegar. He delivers a truckload of attitude throughout the disc, but it is on the title track that The Metal God shows up and just goes off like a bomb in your living room. In 1982 there were 4.5 billion people on the planet, and exactly one who could do \"Screaming for Vengeance\" the way it needed to be done. Then he follows up with \"You've Got Another Thing Comin'\" which is a testosterone-fueled fuck you requiring the utmost disdain on the vocal track. The whole album is full of what makes Halford a legend but other high moments include \"Devil's Child\" with that snarling, screeching chorus and the more earnest stylings present on \"Bloodstone.\"\n\nOn the topic of musical ferocity, Tipton and Downing's dual guitar attack reaches a new peak on this album both in terms of sheer muscle and the riffology employed crafting these songs into existence. Much can be said about the better-known passages such as \"The Hellion\" - which is on my short list of greatest intros in the history of metal - and the amped-up grind of the title track. But I'm actually more fond of the intricate riffs, such as the opening of \"Bloodstone\" and the clean, echoing lines that set the tone of \"Fever.\" There's a craftsmanship here that I feel is overlooked. It's not just power chords and Halford's high-register shrieks. Tipton and Downing are no joke. They consistently wrote amazing stuff for decades, throwing in twists that you wouldn't necessarily expect given their skillset isn't based on technical wizardry. The writing trio of Tipton, Downing, and Halford is among the greatest and most enduring in rock history, not just metal, and if I had to point to one body of work that exemplifies what they are capable of, it's this disc. There's almost no repetition present across the album. When you take each track it can stand on its own yet each one is undeniably Priest, save the cover of \"(Take These) Chains.\" As if to put a cherry on top, some of them have these amazing lead breaks where key changes happen out of the blue, and some of the best riffs happen only once. Witness the mid sections of \"Devil's Child\" and \"Bloodstone.\" And the leads themselves are well written, with that trademarked interplay between Tipton and Downing's distict styles. It's an equal partnership, and a long-lived one at that. This isn't the dominant Hetfield and the submissive Hammett. It's not Mustaine and his latest plug-and-play partner. Tipton and Downing are equal-share stakeholders. Big difference folks. Listen to these songs with that in mind. You'll hear it.\n\nUnderpinning this entire disc is Tom Allom's amazing production. The best way I can describe the sound of Screaming for Vengeance is dense and layered, full of pounding drums and wall-of-sound guitars that belie the 4 musicians playing it. Allom uses Tipton and Downing's dual guitar work to perfect effect, putting the rhythm guitars right in your face and utilizing radically different tonalities between the two axemen as they trade solos. There's a considerable amount of overdubbing going on, creating a layered guitar sound that wasn't present on British Steel, and not to this extent on Point of Entry. Notably, this is the first album where the drum mix is given much more thump, a theme that would carry forward to the next few releases. It's not a modern sound by today's standards, but the bass drum in particular is very prominent, especially on tracks like \"Pain and Pleasure.\" Listening to these songs feels like being walloped over the head with a hammer at times, and caught in a whirlwind at others. While this kind of listening experience is a given today, in 1982 it was much more difficult to accomplish. For its time this was some of the heaviest stuff going. Screaming for Vengeance was big boy metal. If you were listening to it, your parents were probably concerned. They'd rather you settle in to some Kiss or Whitesnake like a good boy.\n\nAs I write this review I'm sad to learn of Glenn Tipton's diagnosis, which combined with K.K. Downing's retirement brings to an official close the most identifiably metal band in history. But with albums like this one, their legacy will live on forever. Bands come and go. Time passes by. Judas Priest is no exception to this rule but what they leave behind is so special that I can honestly say it added more than just entertainment to my life. It worked its way into my identity in some fashion. I submit Screaming for Vengeance as their crowning achievement; a perfect metal album and on the short list of greatest moments in the history of heavy metal.\n",
        "\nMany fans seem to overlook \"Ram it Down\" as it lacks a consistent stylistic theme. It seems contain musical elements from both Turbo and Painkiller. I happen to like the Turbo-esque elements myself, and I think the songs that resemble the Turbo style are stronger on this album than they were on Turbo. And, interestingly, the speed metal elements of the album, in my opinion, are just as strong as the songs from Painkiller. \n\nThere are a few weak songs here though, most notably \"Johnny B Goode\", which, along with the crappy promotional video they released, turned a lot of people off, myself included. But actually, I don't mind their version; it's just an obviously bad cover version of a classic song. The other forgettable track here is \"Love You to Death\". These two songs stink, but the other 8 songs are top notch. \n\nThe title track alone is so damn good that even if every other song on the album sucked, I still might be inclined to give it a passing score. \"Ram it Down\" is pure fucking speed metal and it contains some of the greatest dueling guitar solos I've ever heard from Judas Priest. You can really hear how Glenn and KK have continued to improve their abilities as they showcase many playing techniques here that you've never heard until this album. The title track, \"Heavy Metal\", and \"Hard as Iron\" are full of all kinds of skillful and interesting guitar tricks, such as sweep picking, classically influenced arpeggios, dive bombs, whammys, tapping, and pedal work. There's some very nice stuff going on with the lead guitars here indeed. \n\nAt this point Dave Holland was about ready to leave the band, and although he is credited as the official drummer, much of the drumming was done by a machine. I personally think that the drum machine here was a great success, and I have no complaints at all about it. Though I often prefer organic, human playing styles, I think in this case their lack of a drummer worked out for the best. The samples they used really sound great and they really pack a punch. They have a pretty strong reverb effect going on, which is a sound I have always loved. It resembles the times, as a lot of metal bands in the 80's were utilizing this type of effect to create a big, arena rock kind of sound. \n\n\"Love Zone\" and \"Come and Get it\" both resemble the style of Turbo, but the riffs on these songs are much better than the riffs from the songs on Turbo, and the rhythms have a real nice headbanging, fist pounding drive. The choruses are real catchy too. \"Blood Red Skies\" stands apart from the rest of the album as an epic masterpiece that sends chills down your spine. Keyboards are used on this track to create a really emotional and symphonic mood. Rob Halford sings with passion, and the lyrics are just magnificent. \n\nFor me this is one of Priest's best albums, despite the unfavorable reviews it has received from some. Definitely a highly underrated album and arguably the most underrated metal album ever produced.\n",
        "\nComebacks are usually associated with breakups and reunions, but they can also be associated with bands who put out bad albums or change in too radical a direction for their core fanbase to care. Painkiller absolutely falls under this category, as I'm sure Screaming For Vengeance did in 82 after the lukewarm reception of Point of Entry, however, over time the perceived comeback can be eroded as catalogs increase in size and even said comeback standards can change.\n\nSo yes, I do think Painkiller is Judas Priest's finest album, but the race is a lot closer than most fans of this album like to admit. It's not so much the best as it is the \"least flawed.\" Screaming For Vengeance is a tad soft in the middle, Stained Class's production is questionable to victims of the loudness wars, and even Sad Wings of Destiny is tainted by haphazard execution. Painkiller's flaw is Rob's lyrics. I'm sure the thrashers were relieved to see that most of the odes to love and sex were gone, but \"Me-tal Melt-down Me-tal Melt-down\" isn't exactly a worthy substitute. Especially depressing is that these words are from the man who wrote \"So much self-indulgence results in shattered eyes, dominant complacency leads to beguiling lies.\" The lyrics should just be smarter, particularly since this album was in direct competition with one Dave Mustaine, who's Rust In Peace revealed a man who seemed to know more about the world after traveling it for five years than a man who has been on the same sojourn for over 15 at that point. I mean really, \"vapor-ipize?\" Sounds like someone was \"vaporipizing\" some pretty good shit to think that sounded tough.\n\nWith all that aside, hearing just how far Scott Travis pushed this band to its limits is both impressive and depressing. Impressive because what a monolithic spiked sword the Priest wields with this one, and depressing because you can't help but wonder how much better Defenders of the Faith, Turbo and especially Ram it Down would have been with Travis behind the skins. Then again, I seem to be the only one wondering what Priest would have been like if fucking Simon Phillips had stayed with the band after Sin After Sin. But back to Travis, his burning chops elevate each band member to be that much tighter and more powerful of a unit. Rob Halford's violent raspy screams are what poser nightmares are made of, and Glenn and KK's licks seem to possess disdain for the incoherent tendencies of their Slayer spawn, wondering why violence, technical proficiency and melody can't co-exist together in the same solo!\n\nThe opener's status as a metal classic is eternal, although some days I have to question whether or not KK's solo makes the song overstay it's welcome. Particularly since it feels tacked on after the song reaches a climax. Perhaps if KK didn't feel he could follow Glenn's legendary lead in this track he should have exercised restraint, like he seems to on A Touch of Evil. It's not like he has anything to worry about, as he lays down two of the best performances of his career on album highlights Between The Hammer & The Anvil and One Shot At Glory. These two songs are magnificent slabs of power metal which would help herald the album to influential status, particularly in Germany. Plus, just in case you think this album might be one dimensional, pay close attention to Travis's drumming underneath Glenn's solo in A Touch of Evil. This is one of my favorite minimalist percussion performances in all of music, almost ghosting the ride cymbal beats, in the first few measures. This slowly builds tension until finally we get a simple but effective drum fill at 3:46 before the rhythm switches back to the hi-hat in a manner that makes you want to give yourself self-induced whiplash. Who said ballads can't make you want to head bang?\n\nCertainly from a musical perspective, Painkiller feels like a journeyman finally logging in that 10,000th hour, and would catapult Judas Priest right back to the top, ready to compete with this strange new upstart calling itself extreme metal. While a smidge over the top lyrically, it is that spirit of going over the top which negates the silliness of some of the lyrics and rewrote the rulebook of metal yet again. Not only does this belong in your collection, this is one of those albums you should look for in other people's collections to make sure they have it.\n",
        "\nEvery since they started out as a blues rock band, Judas Priest have always diversified and pushed their sound on almost every album they have released. Even criticized releases like Point Of Entry and Turbo are far different than their predecessors (British Steel and Defenders Of The Faith, respectively.) Even the Tim \"The Ripper\" Owens releases were in styles new for the band. However, Angel Of Retribution was somewhat stagnant on the level of experimentation. I'm sure to most people at the time, Judas Priest was going to be another nostalgia act in the vein of Saxon or AC/DC, forever making minute changes to their style but not really doing anything to it at the same time.\n\nHowever, the Metal Gods would not put up with this silly notion. To put it simply, Judas Priest was not going to be another lethargic mass of sludge. They released Nostradamus. No one was prepared. \n\nStorytelling and reminiscing aside, Nostradamus sticks out as Judas Priest's most epic and lengthy studio album, being about an hour and forty minutes. Be forewarned; Lovers of fast and to-the-point speed metal will not be able to comprehend this album and its inner workings. At the same time, this album manages to also feel about half as long as it actually is. The first CD is mostly filled with diverse assortment of tracks, with most being around mid-paced. As noted by other reviewers, the songs do slow down into more steady and slow paced tracks in the second CD; However, don't let this fool you into thinking the songs are any worse. \n\nMost of the songs on the album are preceded by a interlude or sort of a beginning piece of music. However, they are done exceptionally well; This album would not be the same without nice intros like \"The Four Horsemen\" or \"Sands of Time\", which bring grandiosity and grandness to their coinciding songs. The actual songs on the album are extremely varied. There are slower, more emotional tunes like \"Exiled\" or \"Alone\", and there also a few speedy thrashers (\"Persecution\" and \"Nostradamus\".) However, most of the tracks are mid-paced often laden with keyboards. For example, \"Pestilence And Plague\", \"Revelations\", and \"Future Of Mankind\" fit this criteria. They also manage to be the best picks of the album. All of the songs on this album manage to be epic and rather grand.\n\nRob Halford kind of tries something a bit different on Nostradamus. The only ravenous screams on this album are found on the two previously mentioned fast songs. Instead of being aggressive and raspy, he instead opts for a more operatic tone of voice on this record. He manages to do this with flying colors, only sounding a little strained on the ending segment of \"Revelations\". Somewhat like Demolition, the guitars on this album play a much more rhythmic role; Mr. Halford is the main centerpiece more so than on any other Priest record. However, unlike Demolition, this album has some truly god level solos. The one on \"Revelations\" has to be on of the best I've heard by any band, period. Scott Travis and Ian Hill are a bit behind in the mix, unfortunately. It doesn't make a huge difference to the overall quality of the album, but they should have been a bit louder. The production of this album is rather nice and acoustic; It is very much enjoyable. \n\nThe only full length song I have an issue with is \"War\". It does feel kind of like an extended interlude in contrast with the whole rest of the other full-length songs. It shows off the orchestra well, but it definitely is the worst track on the album (It still is pretty great, don't get me wrong.) The most surprising one is \"Death\". It's laden with an epic doom style, and it features a very awesome vocal performance and doomy riffs to boot. I especially like the \"Death rides out from the storm...\" bit. It is one of the best moments of the record.\n\nOften, innovation and experimentation tend to lead to two very different outcomes. Some bands fail completely, so they backtrack to their previous album to never again do anything different. Others succeed and chisel out a place for themselves to reside in the great halls of heavy metal. Judas Priest further entrenched their greatness and ingenuity with Nostradamus. Though many disagree with me, I know, I think many of those who do would also like to see them attempt to do something different once again, for the remainder of their existence among in the realm of us mere mortals.\n",
        "\nBoy, oh boy, do people love shitting on this album. Martin Popoff calls it the worst album of Judas Priest's career (has he heard Point of Entry or Demolition). I have both of my feet planted firmly in the \"fuck you, this is underrated\" camp, but it's by no means perfect. For one thing there are three absolute duds here, Love Zone (which rips off the coda riff from Back In Black), Love You To Death (forgettable), and I'm A Rocker (slightly less forgettable) which someone in management thought was a good idea to bring back live as a deep cut, as opposed to the far superior Hard As Iron or Blood Red Skies.\n\nThis album has a very oddball sound to it, it feels a little slick and overproduced, but then there are times when it's a few decibels (or a few joints) away from sounding like Under The Sign of The Black Mark, tonally anyway. In addition, no one can seem to conclude just how much drumming Mr. Holland had laid down on what would be his swansong album with Priest and how much is a drum machine. It certainly sounds like a real drummer on the title track and Hard As Iron, which has enough double bass drumming to make you think Scott Travis joined the band early. I know that sounds like the exact opposite of Dave Holland, but I have a difficult time believing that drum machines in the late 80s were capable of some relatively intense rhythms. Ram It Down feels like a sonic successor to Defenders Of The Faith while adding in the more polished production of Turbo. Perhaps that was the direction Priest should have went to begin with.\n\nHighlights: I'm a sucker for a quality deep cut that nobody talks about, and in this particular case that cut is Hard As Iron. One could make the case that this was the last song written for the album and it was here we see the flashes of the Painkiller to come. What I'm trying to say is, this song totally could have been on Painkiller. The title track as well, and I think Scott Travis taking a barebones single bass drum approach would have made a great method of switching things around without sacrificing the intensity. I kinda wish they would have had Scott flat out go back and re-record the drums on this album, or at least the songs Holland didn't play on. \n\nOf course, no review of Ram it Down is complete without talking about the metal mantlepiece known as Blood Red Skies. Priest tried to reinvent the wheel many times, and some attempts were better than others, but it is so, SO satisfying when they get it right. This is Judas Priest getting it right in almost every regard. Even if this is a drum machine song, it gives Priest a daring new canvas to work with that they otherwise might never have had the opportunity to use. Take Jimmy Miller sitting in for Charlie Watts on You Can't Always Get What You Want for example. But that impassioned, vengeful vocal performance from Rob! The wild yet somewhat classical solo from KK! That bass groove that fits in the pocket so well (at least in my headcanon it's a bass groove)! The brilliant weaving of keyboards and guitar chords! Blood Red Skies is a song every power metal and symphonic metal band should fastidiously study.\n\nWould I call Ram It Down an essential purchase from Priest? Not quite, but it certainly isn't as bad as it's detractors claim it is. Your Priest collection won't quite be satisfactory until you get your steely fingers on this one.\n",
        "\nSometimes a new record fills me with enthusiasm and I think that I am listening to a modern classic, but mostly I am convinced that all classic albums have already been written. \"British Steel\" celebrates its 38th anniversary this year. Maybe it is a somewhat dubious classic, because it holds two terribly commercial songs. \"Living After Midnight\" and \"United\", radio-friendly, harmless and perfectly timed with three and a half minutes, threw themselves to the ground in order to lick the feet of the mainstream industry. Painfully stupid lyrics meet overly simple, repetitive song patterns and everything spreads a malodorous aroma. These two useless stinkers blurred the picture in the public eye. Even in 2018, they are still like some leftovers in Fukushima and try to contaminate the entire album. This attempt is doomed to failure, but they make it impossible for me to give a higher rating, although I really worship the majority of the other tracks.\n\n\"Breaking the Law\" was, together with - of course - the two commercial cardinal sins, one of the singles of the album and it shows the \"real\" Priest. From an objective point of view, it is as simple as its two crippled neighbours. But this is completely irrelevant, because its catchy guitars, the rebel lyrics and the siren after the second chorus create a totally different aura. A great number, a little bit short, but very compact and exciting at the same time. Just do yourself a favour and don't check its embarrassing video clip on YouTube. I am sorry that I cannot describe its plot, but this brief movie is just too stupid.\n\nHowever, music is made for the ears and not for the eyes and Judas Priest had really forged some iron weapons. \"Rapid Fire\" lived up to its name. A great speed metal pioneer, direct, sharp and somersaulting. It was the ring tone of my company mobile for years, but this was no good idea, because its fantastically abrasive guitars at the beginning mostly announced an asshole who wanted to talk to me. Yet apart from this small detail, \"Rapid Fire\" can be taken as the prototype of a fast heavy metal song. No, this is not an exaggeration. Together with tracks such as the hymnal \"Metal Gods\" or the mean \"Grinder\", this song helped to define heavy metal once and for all. The screaming solo guitars, the vehemence and commander Halford's variable voice delivered outstanding components.\n\nAt a time when each and every (good) new metal album enriched the little and fragmented scene with new impulses, nobody saw a reason to write a mega-complex output. Progressive metal had not yet been invented. Happy times! Nevertheless, Judas did not only concentrate on simple song configurations. The second half of \"British Steel\" surprised with pretty multi-layered tracks - with the exception of \"Living After Midnight\", but this is needless to say. Judas found a good balance between instrumental parts and sections that were dominated by Halford and this mix laid the foundation for little epics. Okay, I admit: from today's perspective, everything sounds very traditional. Or let's say it clearly: one can call the material old-fashioned and outdated. But I beg to differ. Just take the closer. \"Steeler\" still emanates a certain freshness and its different parts do not lack liveliness. Of course, one must like the sound of the early eighties and the then great production cannot be considered as objectively competitive with the recordings of the 21st century. But I think this is exactly the sound that the material asked for. So let's keep it short: if you want to get back to the roots of (mostly) aggressive heavy metal, you must be familiar with \"British Steel\". Its iconic artwork does not promise too much. You are listening to a classic.\n",
        "\nI watched a video on Youtube a while back which had the members of Judas Priest going through each of their albums, and they gave a decent amount of commentary on each one released at the time, without glossing over any single one... just kidding. As expected, they completely glossed over the two albums they crafted with Tim Owens. Whether they did this because Rob Halford was back in the band, or they just hate the albums, I don't really know. However, glossing over these albums simply because they had a different singer just seems rather weird. Are these albums so bad they need to be erased from history, forever smitten from existence itself, worthy of rotting in the deepest pits of Hell?\n\nOf course not. \n\nTo begin with, many have said Demolition reeks of nu-metal influences. If this is true, this then must mean it is horrible, right? Let me elaborate on why this is said. Certainly, it is true that the guitars in this album play a background role, mostly providing groovy riffs for Tim Owens to sing over. Additionally, this album's kind of raw but \"modern\" production also gives off the air of the era. The lyrics are also more aggressive and personal than usual. However, besides these three things, it still is quite a metal album. Guitar solos are still found on this album, though they are not horribly memorable, I'll admit. The riffs, while downtuned and groovy, are still based in metal. I can actually hear Ian Hill play bass, which really is rare in Judas Priest. Scott Travis mostly just keeps the beat on this record, like he has tended to do, unfortunately. Vocally speaking, Tim Owens is obviously more talented than your crappy mallcore vocalist. Though more restrained than he was on Jugulator, he still gives a great performance on every song, I think this was the album where he showed his unique sound that separated him from being a Rob Halford clone.\n\nSpeaking of songs, this album is remarkably consistent. Though being over an hour long, Demolition actual seems to go by rather quickly. I really didn't feel like it dragged at all. The only song I really would mark as filler would be \"Devil Digger\". It is simply the most bland song on the album, though it has some weird guitar riffy thing going on. The two ballads on the album are also done very well; \"Close To You\" is one of Judas Priest's best songs, no doubt about it (the mellow feeling around the second verse is quite nice.) The other ballad, \"Lost And Found\", is more acoustic guitar driven, but still pretty good. The other songs on the album, which are more heavy metal focused, are also quite great, especially \"Bloodsuckers\", \"In Between\", \"Cyberface\", and \"Metal Messiah\" (which has one Judas Priest's best choruses.) Overall, every track on this record besides \"Devil Digger\" is very pleasant and great. \n\nDemolition is actually one of Judas Priest's most consistent and killer albums. I think it is better than Jugulator, though this more of a subjective opinion. It isn't as riff driven, but it just has better songs than Jugulator. However, Demolition is really not a good starting place for new listeners. It is completely different from their more popular and famous albums. It sounds nothing like\"Sad Wings of Destiny\" or \"Screaming For Vengeance\". This is like Priest's own \"Virtual XI\", though better. I think that if you listen to Demolition with an open mind without any expectations of them sounding like they did previously, you will gain much enjoyment from the record. It's a shame they'll probably never reprint it ever again.\n",
        "\nMost of the new Judas Priest albums have been safe and reliable, not breaking the ground they used to or taking many risks. Albums like Redeemer of Souls could be reasonably called pastiches of cliches of the band, almost self-parodic in how much they just hit every box for what the band was known for, from Painkiller-esque ripping guitars to Halford\u2019s vocals and even the cover art depicting badass metal creatures doing badass things. And some fans, myself included, have bemoaned this. \u201cWhy can\u2019t they release something innovative and experimental again?\u201d we asked, even despite knowing bands often do not continue reinventing the wheel 40+ years into their careers.\n\nWell, actually, they did try and innovate again with Nostradamus in 2008, perhaps the biggest argument against the whole \u201cPriest isn\u2019t breaking ground anymore\u201d idea, flying directly in its face. And honestly, I had to really ask myself, was I being unfair in my critiques of Priest? Was I really just talking out both sides of my mouth, criticizing them for both trying and failing at something new on this album, and also playing it safe on other new albums?\n\nThe answer I came up with was that Nostradamus is a very poor album. And that\u2019s just down to the writing and performances.\n\nI appreciate what they were trying to do on here, the whole rock-opera thing. They hadn\u2019t ever tried it before and maybe about 20 or 30 years ago they could\u2019ve really ripped out some great, compelling music in this style. But what we got with Nostradamus wasn\u2019t that. This should be dramatic, grandiose music, but instead the slow passages are just dull and listless. The melodies are theatrical in nature, but the delivery renders them just boring, banal and basic, almost sleep-inducing a lot of the time.\n\nYou get some good shit like \u201cProphecy\u201d early on, a classic Priest track played a bit slower and darker. \u201cRevelations\u201d is good, albeit dragging on a bit at seven minutes. \u201cWar\u201d and \u201cDeath\u201d are the most experimental songs on here, showing off the opera style integrating the fullest with the band\u2019s usual identity, but they\u2019re more interesting than actually exciting. Halford just sounds a bit restrained and the stuff he\u2019s singing just isn\u2019t as stirring or powerful as I\u2019d like.\n\nAfter that, it all kind of goes down the drain. Most of the rest of this is just corny borderline AOR stuff played in a much darker manner than usual. \u201cConquest,\u201d \u201cAlone,\u201d \u201cVisions\u201d - these songs are full of a bunch of contrived, cliche melodies and choruses that repeat far too often despite not being compelling or memorable. \u201cLost Love\u201d is a boring ballad, and \u201cNew Beginnings\u201d is somehow even more boring. I guess some of the other ones like \u201cPersecution\u201d or the title track are attempts at Painkiller stuff again, but they\u2019re hardly the band\u2019s best efforts at that style. In between these, you just get a bunch of interminable interludes, dull and dragging.\n\nI get that they\u2019re trying to really stretch themselves, and I like the concept of a classic band like this really trying something way out of the box. But Nostradamus is a lackluster effort, without many compelling melodies or engaging songs. It doesn\u2019t flow in a way that really draws me in and the execution aims for epic and just hits slow and ponderous instead. The ambition alone can\u2019t make up for the inanity of the writing on this thing. At an hour and 42 minutes, the amount of good songs on here compared to boring stuff is not a good look for Priest.\n\nSo while I hate to dog on Priest for only putting out safe, by the numbers material after this, it really does come down to the songwriting and execution - both areas that Nostradamus as well as its follow-ups in recent years have lacked in.\n",
        "\nJudas Priest is perhaps the number one band out of the old classic acts whose modern albums have been largely bashed. Everything they've released since 1990's Painkiller has been seemingly met with a majority of criticism and skepticism. I might be biased as a huge fan of the band, but I find some of that negativity being exaggerated towards the level of elitism. There have been some problems with the modern JP releases but rarely due to the actual music. Some albums were missing Rob Halford's vocals, some had too much going on, and the one prior to this one had horrible production values. Regardless of what problems fans may have had with the past three Halford-fronted albums, the Priest listened and delivered their most fail-safe result in a long time - the mighty Firepower.\n\nMany fans have been quick to point out that this is \"the best album\" since Painkiller. I don't know if I agree with that, seeing as I've liked most of their albums, but there certainly are some things that feel more connected between the two albums. Just like with the former classic, this album starts off in a similar fashion with its rapid, powerful and catchy title-track. In fact, the entire A-side has the album's most fast-paced material which do indeed give away a strong Painkiller vibe. After that, however, the remaining bunch of songs tend to take a more mid-paced approach as well as adapting to earlier Priest albums. Side B to D is more like a running manifest presenting all styles and sounds of JP, past and present. \"Never The Heroes\" sounds like it could've been on 1986's Turbo while songs such as \"Lone Wolf\" takes on a more doomy, almost Black Sabbath-y, 70's-era doom metal sound. \"Necromancer\" on the other hand almost sounds like Primal Fear typically sounding like Judas Priest (in a positive way), if that makes sense. The band combines sticking to their old guns while also thinking outside of the box. I must say that it works rather well.\n\nWhile I never doubted the song material being enjoyable at the very least, I was fearful about how the production value would end up. 2014's Redeemer Of Souls was perhaps not a bad album musically, but its end result left a lot to be desired. Its production value was exceptionally bad for an A-list band in this day and age of modern technology, but the self-producing didn't really help pushing the performance potentials either. This time around the band instead enlisted two outside producers - their old hit-album maker Tom Allom and modern-day wizard Andy Sneap. That was probably the best choice they could ever do regarding this album, seeing as the result is simply fantastic. The production is very clear and balanced but most of all - the band sounds great. Especially Rob Halford does a killer job with the vocal delivery. Miles better than he performed on the preceding album and exceptionally good for the age of 66!\n\nAs this album comes to its ends, I'm left feeling very satisfied with what the band gave me for my money and ears. One thing stands for certain - it exceeded all my expectations and then some. At this point in their career, after having experimented some in the past few decades, the band did the right thing by playing it \"safe\". The thing about this record is that it's kind of safe without feeling like it. The only complaint I've got, and it's a minor one, is that some songs such as \"Flame Thrower\" could've been even better if sped up ten percent or so. The album's middle section becomes a bit dragging after a few songs of similar pace, with that one particularly sticking out as something that perhaps would've been better left out altogether. I guess it can be a case of where too many is better than too few and vice versa.\n\nIn conclusion I only have this to say: get this album! It's a damn good release that's sure to please most fans of the band. In many ways it does share a musical resemblance to Painkiller in particular, but I would never limit its sound to resemble just that one alone. To me it can just as well be another Nostradamus without all the -ludes in between the tracks. It's simply a Judas Priest record. One that has already climbed high on my top-list for JP records.\n\nCheck-outs: \"Guardians / Rising From Ruins\", \"Traitors Gate\", \"Never The Heroes\", \"Lone Wolf\", \"Lightning Strike\".\n",
        "\nWith all the debacle surrounding Judas Priest and the recent reveal of Glenn Tipton\u2019s struggles with Parkinson\u2019s disease, it\u2019s worth noting that Firepower is the most confident album they\u2019ve released in a long time. It\u2019s not a greatest hits album masquerading as new material like Redeemer of Souls or even Angel of Retribution, nor is it as overcompensating as Nostradamus or the Ripper-era albums were. There\u2019s obviously still pressure for the band to make a good album, but it\u2019s clear that this is the album that they wanted to make.\n\nAs evidenced by the Screaming for Vengeance-style artwork and Tom Allom\u2019s joint producer credit, Firepower has more in common with Judas Priest\u2019s 80s era than its immediate predecessors. Shades of Painkiller and Rob Halford\u2019s solo works can be felt in Scott Travis\u2019s precise drum work, but the more upbeat material has more in common with albums like British Steel or Defenders of the Faith. \u201cRising from Ruins\u201d goes even further by channeling a tensely somber undercurrent reminiscent of Ram It Down\u2019s \u201cBlood Red Skies.\u201d\n\nA more centralized style focus also allows the band members to stay in top shape. Richie Faulkner feels more thoroughly integrated in the band, working well with Tipton\u2019s established sound and offering a more natural style than Redeemer\u2019s overly processed tone. Halford\u2019s delivery also comes off more balanced as his mid-range bears much of the weight with screams coming in as sparse support. The band may be playing it safe, but it\u2019s a case where it\u2019s best to see them in a more comfortable position rather than trying to do the undoable.\n\nThe songwriting is also consistent, despite having a slew of fourteen tracks to choose from. Tracks like \u201cTraitor\u2019s Gate\u201d and the closing \u201cSea of Red\u201d offer plenty of power metal flavor, and \u201cNo Surrender\u201d makes for the album\u2019s best burst of energy. \u201cNever the Heroes\u201d is also noteworthy; the mid-tempo pace has potential for dullness, but the epic flair gives it character while the chorus goes deeper than the other singles. \u201cLone Wolf\u201d is the closest you\u2019ll get to a clunker with its grungy main riff and its verses\u2019 slowed down \u201cSad but True\u201d vocal lines, but it\u2019s more out of place than outright bad.\n\nAngel of Retribution remains the best of Judas Priest\u2019s reunion era, but Firepower\u2019s consistent style and grounded musicianship is enough to put it miles ahead of the two albums in between. The lack of exploratory elements does keep it from reaching the heights of the band\u2019s best works, but avoiding the kitchen sink album process also keeps them from repeating past blunders. I hope this is the last we see of Priest considering Tipton\u2019s retirement from touring, but fan satisfaction is pretty much guaranteed here.\n\nHighlights:\n\u201cNever the Heroes\u201d\n\u201cRising from Ruins\u201d\n\u201cTraitor\u2019s Gate\u201d\n\u201cNo Surrender\u201d\n\u201cSea of Red\u201d\n\nOriginally published at http://indymetalvault.com\n",
        "\nJudas Priest return with new guitarist Richie Faulkner and an awakened Scott Travis on Firepower, an album which is the living definition of \"pretty good.\"\n\nOn this album, Halford's shrieks are limited, and as the recent live Priest albums show, he cannot scream across the stratosphere as well as he once could. (His last 150% recording was the double live Halford album, which has the unbelievable shriekfests, \"Hell's Last Survivor\" and \"Sad Wings\".) Even with a lower ceiling on his voice, Halford is terrific, my favorite singer in metal history, and he sounds great singing any reasonably good vocal idea. Whether rough or smooth, high or low, staccato or melodic, angry or dolorous, Halford is the master. (Perhaps only Eric Adams and Ronnie James Dio have ever turned in comparable work.)\n\nSo...there are a bunch of thoughts on only the vocalist of this classic metal band...and there's a reason for that. This album feels like a Halford solo album more than a Priest album. A similar argument could be made about Black Sabbath's 13 for similar reasons: The riffs aren't particularly memorable or unique to their respectively historic riff writers. There is no \u201cwow\u201d when Iommi and Tiption talk with their axes on these albums. Almost all of the best material by each band has the synergy of great riffs and great singing. The Sentinel. Sign of the Southern Cross. The Ripper. Touch of Evil. One Shot at Glory. The Wizard. Symptom of the Universe. Falling Off the Edge of the World.\n\nAnd thus, songs on both 13 and Firepower almost entirely succeed or fail based on the quality of the vocal ideas, in particular, the quality of the chorus refrains. The strong riffs and sinister metal landscapes found in the finest Priest songs are wholly absent on this album. So on Firepower, this band that trailblazed twin guitar harmonies and high energy hammer-on riffing is largely there to give Rob Halford something to sing on top of.\n\nAnd sing excellently, he does. The lush, somber chorus of clear album highlight, \"Rising from Ruins\" (which conjures up memories of \"Night Comes Down\"), the anthemic \"No Surrender\" and the biting, clipped approach he takes in the refrain of \"Traitor's Gate\" show but three facets of the platinum standard of metal singing. Similarly, songs with lousy or mediocre choruses are thus torpedoed by their refrains--\"Necromancer,\" the dual stabs at modern macho (\"Flamethrower\" & \"Lone Wolf\") and the forced album nadir, \"Evil Never Dies\". Other tunes with pretty good choruses are consequently...pretty good. \"Never the Heroes,\" \u201cSpectre,\u201d and \"Sea of Red,\" (which is a bit too Broadway/chromatic, but not embarrassing like \"Loch Ness\").\n\nCould \"No Surrender\" and \"Spectre\" be Halford solo songs? 100% And to me, that means that the full potential of the band Judas Priest has not been tapped, and the album falls into the category of \"fun,\" rather than \u201ctimeless.\u201d Even derided albums like Ram it Down and Turbo have \"Blood Red Skies,\" \"Out in the Cold,\" swaggering, twisted blues like \"Love You to Death\" and the monolithic stomper \"Monster of Rock\". All of these tunes and their respective albums feel like all of the guys are creatively participating at a full level. Not so here.\n\nThe production on Firepower is the best of their post-Painkiller albums. Drums are beefy and all of the leads sound like they went through blasting amps, which hasn\u2019t been the case for a while. Welcome back producer Tom Allon, (technologically?) aided by Andy Sneap. Perhaps because of Allom or Sneap or some good coffee, Scott Travis woke up. This technically perfect drummer was good on Painkiller, but has been keeping time and creatively unremarkable for nearly three decades, other than on the song \"Down in Flames\" and a few spots on Nostradamus. He wakes up on here--the extra China crashes and accents in \"Lightning Strikes\" are quite good and his fills and accents really help all around. Raise an iron mug of coffee to Travis for finally delivering more of his potential.\n\nI wish Priest didn't feel obligated to make hour long albums, since both this one and Redeemer of Souls have enough good material to be far better full experiences if they were 40 or 45 minutes long. It's great that Halford sounds this good, and I'll continue to buy and keep albums of this quality level, but hope for something more. Obviously they were quite inspired as a band when they made Nostradamus--\"Alone\" and \"Death\" are their two best post-Painkiller songs--but that huge double album has far too much filler as well.\n\nShould you get this album? Yes, if you're a Priest fan. \u201cRising from Ruins\u201d is really good and has a departure section that develops other dimensions (and keys) and helps make it feel like grand, classic Priest (and oddly, the departure in the lemon, \"Evil Never Dies\" also has some cool key changes and grandness in the departure, but is torpedoed by the chorus).\n\nFirepower has 4 winners, 4 mediocre tunes, and 5 decent/above average songs. Very good Halford; pretty good Priest.\n",
        "\nAfter almost 50 years, 18 albums and basically shaping the way heavy metal was meant to be played you can hardly claim the Birminghamn boys aren't pulling their weight. Firepower, the 19th full length album, comes four years after its predecessor; Redeemer Of Souls (2014) which proved that modern day Priest still had lots of thunder to strike. Yes, I was one of like three people to actually really like the return to form that Redeemer was.\n\nThe guitar work is generally as strong as can be expected from the originators of the twin axe attack. Glenn Tipton, who was sadly diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s disease before the recording of the album (producer Andy Sneap (Hell) will carry his duty on the subsequent tour), defies all said hardship and alongside Richie Faulkner makes Firepower the rifflicious revelry in gritty and melodic guitar dueling and powerful heavy metal thunder that it is. It\u2019s a safe album, but by Priest\u2019s standards, that does not mean bad. Arguably their lowest points have been pretty strong as well, and Firepower is far from their lowest point, as it punches the metal with a fresh and modern sound.\n\nOpener and title track 'Firepower' is actually a rather dull, playing it safe, kind of affair that doesn\u2019t quite to the album justice. Aside from the raunchy guitar intro and a couple of fiery licks strewn throughout, it does little to get the ball rolling. Instead, the following 'Lightning Strike', used as the single for the album, does all of that and more. After that, the beginning picks up strong and heavy with a few menacingly heavy tracks and rolling thunder with hints to Painkiller (1990) and Angel Of Retribution (2003)\n\nThis culminates mid-album, in 'Rising From Ruins' (and its building piano intro 'Guardians'), which - quite frankly - blows the rest of the material straight out of the gate. A mid tempo semi epic with an atmospheric touch thanks to the low rumbling of Ian Hill\u2019s dense bass lines and a slow, melodic guitar solo that extends to the climax of the song. While the rest of the album holds a few great tracks, none fully match the intensity of 'Rising From Ruins', which will likely stand as Firepower\u2019s crowning moment in years to come, alongside 'Traitor's Gate'.\n\nRob Halford, now 66 years old, delivers with massive amounts of passion for the metal trade and great power in those vocal lines. Staying mostly in his comfortable, yet lethal mid range, he strikes into the higher banshee shrieks in a few choruses where they make great effect. While not going out of his way to once more break the ground he once broke, he shows no sign of his voice faltering. The album is not as experimental as Priest have been known to; most notably with Nostradamus (2008), but sticks to safe ground while still feeling fresh and new.\n\nThe new life that Faulkner (replacing K.K. Downing) brought to the legendary band before the last album still rolls well, giving Firepower the same sense of love for the craft that was present on Redeemer Of Souls, which it clearly matches, and arguably even overtakes. Obviously, no new Judas Priest album will ever hold up to the classics in the eyes of the fans, but with an open mind there\u2019s no doubt that the Priest has lost no love for heavy metal, as Firepower is nothing if not a testament to the everlasting power of the metal gods.\n\nStandout tracks: Lightning Strike, Evil Never Dies, Rising From Ruins, Traitor\u2019s Gate\n",
        "\nWhat can you really say about a new Priest album? Even more than bands like Maiden or Sabbath, Priest is an intensely personal band for people and everyone has differing feelings on their wide, eclectic catalog of work \u2013 somehow people can argue about this fucking band even while agreeing which albums they like. That's how you know you made a cultural impact. This new one, Firepower, is probably their best in a long time, though that isn't really a statement on how amazing it is so much as how lame albums like Nostradamus were.\n\nThis one gets back to what they're good at, sounding like a refined version of Redeemer of Souls from a few years back \u2013 the songs are tighter, the production is better and Halford sounds about ten times better than he has in ages, with real grit and power now again. The writing is kind of a mix of everything from Screaming for Vengeance to Painkiller, sort of right in the middle of their 80s rocking sound and the screaming aggression of Painkiller. It's Priest by numbers with little innovation, but honestly what else did you want at this point anyway? If this isn't their last album altogether, I'll be surprised \u2013 recent drama with their guitarists hasn't been a good sign and this album is already sounding like kind of a tribute act anyway, with Andy Sneap's cookie-cutter production and Richie Faulkner's guitars just being a bit alien for a band this classic and iconic. He wasn't gonna live up to what they used to be like. But it's still not bad.\n\nI hate to say 'oh, well what do you expect from an old band?' because that just sounds like I'm saying to lower your standards. But I am saying I didn't expect a Priest album in 2018 to sound like anything other than this \u2013 and I'm surprised at how clear and tight it is, as opposed to the sometimes dragging and dull stuff they were doing on other recent albums, so there IS that.\n\nIt's almost kind of pointless even to review this at all. An old war-horse band like this, one of the most iconic and popular in rock, was never going to do much else at this stage of their career. And there is certainly a conversation to be had about how artists in other mediums tend to get better and more experienced as they age \u2013 blues musicians and other genre stalwarts play well into their 90s and film directors and actors continue putting out quality work as they age. So we maybe shouldn't use 'oh, they're old' as a defense for judging bands like Priest with low standards. But maybe heavy metal is a youthful, ephemeral thing like lightning in a bottle and it doesn't age well.\n\nThe album is fine though. My main critique is how middle-of-the-road it tends to sound in terms of identity \u2013 a lot of the time, if you took out Halford's vocals, these songs could be mistaken for a Priest worshiping modern metal band if you weren't paying much attention. But at the same time, they're entertaining tunes. The title track, \u201cLightning Strikes,\u201d the epic \u201cRising from Ruins\u201d and the classic stormer \u201cNo Surrender\u201d are quality tunes. Maybe the 14-song track list makes it hard for individual tunes to stand out, and maybe the hooks aren't as catchy as the band's heyday. But it's a fine, very decent album overall. There's nothing to envy of a band with Priest's pedigree having fun and just rocking out. I didn't expect much else from Priest and they gave me about what I thought I'd get, just in a slightly better quality. So there is that.\n",
        "\nIt'd been clear to me for well over a quarter century now that one of my favorite childhood bands had long jumped any shark of possible progression or creative stimulus. So I apprehensively bounced back and forth between the frustrations of the tryhard Ripper years, or the overly 'ambitious' dullard Nostradamus, which was anything but, to the slight disappointments like Angel of Retribution which teased at having some redeeming qualities until I realized that I had no compulsion whatsoever to revisit them as years dragged on and I could just listen to the extensive backlog that I already owned and adored. With 40 years behind them, they were no longer just in contention with themselves and their post-midlife metal crises anyway, but with generations of bands that had fostered their inspiration into magnificence and already produced extensive careers unto themselves. So it's with no small degree of surprise that I sit here in 2018, entirely absorbed by a Judas fucking Priest album that I held little to no expectations for whatsoever, an easy favorite for me since the mighty (and apparently divisive) Painkiller back in 1990.\n\nThe cliche is that when veteran bands with gaping holes in their discographies drag themselves out of the dregs, and crawl back on the quality wagon, they tend to start by releasing an effort that sounds like the next natural step after some breakthrough or popular recording of their studious past; often playing it safe with material that sounds like it could have just fit on a prior album. I'm not sure that Firepower eludes that trap, since so much of it feels like an extension of where the band was at through the 80s, culminating in their hardest hitting material at the dawn of the next decade. From the very cover art, of which the symmetry and design channels Defenders of the Faith or Screaming with Vengeance, to the ridiculously strange, over the top imagery paraded through the lyrics in the heavier tunes circa Painkiller, this is well-trodden terrain. But here it's being crossed with such a high level of dignity, care and professional pageantry that I can excuse any and all redundancies, because it doesn't just exceeds its five predecessors in one or two categories that give it an edge. No, it clobbers them in every conceivable department. Not merely a Painkiller II, that a teenage me would have slavered over had it arrived around 1992-3, but a more mature, dynamic offering packed with 14 tracks, not all of which are equally memorable, but any of which I'd take over the entirety of a Demolition or Redeemer of Souls.\n\nThe production is excellent. Smooth, streamlined, consistent from fore to aft, whereas the last album from 2014 sounded like someone dicking around a little with ProTools for the first time, or some other software and unevenly distributing the punch of the riffs and the overall tones. Scott Travis' drums thunder along seamlessly to the rhythm guitars, while the leads and vocals are placed at just the right level to stand on the shoulders of the workmanlike riffings and beatings. The leads here are wonderful, volcanic little explosions that punctuate strong bridge sequences, memorable to listen through on their own despite their brevity. The rhythms sound excellent without any big studio gimmicks, just a vibrant and fluid tone that flawlessly delivers that balance of aggression and majesty which the double guitar attack has conjured up on all their better material. As for Rob, while he is clearly and understandably not offering up screams on par with his youth, he otherwise doesn't sound like his voice has aged a day past 1990, and the verses and choruses here are well arranged even if they aren't going to come off as highly original to anyone who's been kicking around heavy or power metal these last several decades. Not much to say about the bass...it's there, just as relevant as on any of their older material, but not a major feature. \n\nSynths and acoustics are tasteful and sparse, the band never relies too much on pure balladry, as with the closer \"Sea of Red\" which proves to be a better rock opera than anything on Nostradamus by several orders of magnitude. A good portion of the album is devoted to Screaming With Vengeance or Painkiller styled ragers, which you can usually spot from miles away by titles like \"Lightning Strike\", \"Flame Thrower\" or \"Firepower\" itself, but as much as I dug these, and the fact that they weren't too intensely cloned from earlier songs, it was really the mid-paced, epic stuff like a \"Rising from Ruins\" or a \"Spectre\" which really drove this one home for me, a lot of which happens after the halfway point of the album. Still, this is not something I plan on listening to in pieces, I really wouldn't want to skip any of it as it establishes a great momentum and continues meting out pleasurable if not unpredictable riffs and vocal lines which, thankfully, don't always mimic others they've done, even if there is a good deal of familiarity. All in all, I'm just beside myself at how much I dig this, and my appreciation has only increased as I've listened to it repeatedly since it arrived in the mail. Doesn't quite ascend into the starting lineup of my 'Big Five' Priest albums (Sad Wings, Stained Class, Defenders, Screaming and Painkiller), but it might just be first off the bench if I need to swap out a center or power forward. At the rate they're going, I'm not sure whether I'll die before this band disappears into the annals of time, but if this was the very last Judas Priest album I ever heard, I could go off satisfied. Well done, gentlemen, and because I could never say it enough in all the years you've entertained me, thank you.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nIt certainly sounds like it too. Love it or hate it, this was the commercially successful era of Priest and the crowd is certainly an indication that this very well could have been recorded in a stadium. Unlike Live After Death, the crowd also seems to give enough of a shit to sing along when Rob asks them to, whereas Long Beach couldn't even be arsed to sing \"to midnight.\"\n\nI don't think it's entirely fair to constantly compare this to Unleashed In The East. For one thing, the Tyrants and Genocides and Exciters that seemed to grow on trees during that era are relatively scarce during this era, and that's not taking into account the final track listing. Call me crazy, but I think the Turbo songs are fine here. Matter of fact, if I'm usually going to listen to specific songs from Turbo, I'm going to choose these versions. Still, the lack of Locked In is questionable, especially considering it was the second song in the set. Look Priest, I know you feel like you're throwing your fans a huge curveball by starting out with a song that's practically a ballad, but I don't mind waiting for Heading Out To The Highway if it means I get to rip the stuffing out of my pillows to Locked In.\n\nThe performance is, all things considered, pretty good. Halford's performance alone should convince anyone who mocked the previous live album as Unleashed In The Studio to get fucked, as he is in top form here. I wouldn't even disagree with any critics who say he sounds better here than he did on Unleashed In the East. Glenn & KK riff and shred as well as rip and tear through the 80s repertoire they've helped establish, not to mention they have a nice wall of guitar tone going to give these songs the punch they need. Ian provides the proper bottom end counterpoint (was there anything else to say about him), and Dave Holland is actually decent here as well. Some of the songs here are played considerably faster than their studio counterparts, and at the very least you need a simple drummer that can hold that pocket, and dammit, Holland holds that pocket (though I suppose not well enough for someone to quip on how Simon Phillips would have done so much better).\n\nStandout performances of Priest...Live include Heading Out To The Highway, Love Bites, Breaking The Law and believe it or not Rock You All Around the World. Ten times out of ten when I go to iTunes I will prefer these versions of the songs over their studio counterparts. Heading Out To The Highway has a damn fine classic guitar duel between Glenn and KK that for some stupid reason didn't make the album, Love Bites has an absolutely sickening lick around 2:11 that I guess just wasn't played with enough venom on Defenders of the Faith because you could barely make it out. Not to mention Halford's nightmare inducing runs at the song's conclusion. Breaking The Law goes from slightly corny PMRC irritant to a vicious slicer. THIS is what should have been on British Steel (complete with an equally dangerous lead from KK). If You've Got Another Thing Comin pissed you off with it's fadeout, then fear not, because it absolutely brings down the house on this album.\n\nThere is one other track that deserves special mention here, and that's Freewheel Burning. The first time I heard this version of the song I thought it was a sketchy recording cos I wasn't sure why the riff sounded so odd, only to have my face smashed in with hammer a few seconds later as this fucker is played at Exciter speed. Yes, Exciter speed. Some fans will say that this is the highlight of the album and I completely understand why. This perfectly captures the sonic fury of Exciters and Tyrants of years past, and even at double speed neither Holland nor Halford miss a beat. Lookbeforeyouleaphasneverbeenthewaywekeepourroadisfree!! Creamy Jesus, my tongue wants to shoot me in the head for just typing that, but Halford sings it flawlessly without fucking up a single syllable. I'm sure there's some vocal coach who can praise this for diction and breath control. As great as it is, I can't quite call this the definitive version of the song. Sure the studio version is slower (heh), but it's tighter and more controlled. Plus we never really got too many Priest songs at that tempo anyway.\n\nAs for flaws? Well I'm sure most will say too many Turbo songs but it was the new album they were promoting so I can let it slide. It would have also been nice to have gotten one extra song from Screaming For Vengeance. Hell I'd have taken Take These Chains (it certainly wouldn't have been out of place in this set). Inexcusable however is the exclusion of the now-Harley-anthem Hell Bent For Leather. Yes, it was from the previous era but it also wasn't on the original version of Unleashed In The East either (the original version had 9 tracks that ended with Tyrant). They left it off here which meant Priest fans had to wait until fucking Live Meltdown 98, and even that version was detuned! For shame. Thankfully on the 2002 remaster of this album (which I assume is the way everyone gets it these days), it's included along with a couple of other schweet gems from 80s tours.\n\nPriest....Live is a fine live album that in my opinion holds its own against other metal live albums, and a pretty swell snapshot of the 80s metal mania. If you love the 80s era of Priest the most there is no reason why you shouldn't own this.\n",
        "\nHaving heard the Firepower-video released on Youtube earlier I was interested to hear what Priest was up to. Firepower (the song) the fast-paced Priest opener I had expected - but what really got me excited was the melody section right after the second chorus. It sounded fresh, like something in as style that Priest hadn't done before. Maybe it was Faulkner's influence or maybe Tipton had an ace up his sleeve, I don't know. It peaked my curiosity.\n\nAfter listening to the whole album (13 tracks plus one short prelude, Guardians), that melody section on the title track still remains my favourite moment on this new Priest disc. That is not to say the album does not have some other great moments on it - it just that Priest has done all this before. Lightning Strike is a great song akin to Hell Patrol or Redeemer of Souls. Sea of Red is the obligatory epic closing track. Flame Thrower and No Surrender offer us the straightforward rocking in the style of Wheels on Fire. The fateful atmosphere and fast riffing of Traitor's Gate reminds me of Battle Cry.\n\nYet, this album does seem the most cohesive of their albums since Painkiller. The production is clearly better than on Redeemer of Souls and even the song material is more even. The biggest highlights are gone - no Painkiller, Hellrider or Halls of Valhalla. On the other hand, there are no bad tracks either. All the 70's style throwbacks are gone, no Revolution or Crossfire. I admit, I worship all of their 70s albums, but there is no point trying to recapture the early years again. This album simply seems to make more sense for the current Priest.\n\nHalford still screams on occasion, but seems to have accepted his lower voice register and uses it to his benefit. He uses distinct styles and phrasing on many of the tracks, so there is some experimentation and variety. What an amazing talent he still has! Guitar sections have that classic melodic Priest quality (thanks to Tipton?) but here and there you can hear some more modern influences (thanks to Faulkner?) like that melody section in Firepower as well as the more modern Lone Wolf. Solos are brilliant, not overly technical, but more concentrated on evoking emotion. Scott Travis uses double-bass drums with a fury I haven't heard for a long while. As a whole, this album cuts to the chase and trims out a lot of the fat we heard on their previous releases.\n\nAll in all, these classic Priest tracks combined with a cover art that is basically the cousin of an eagle Screaming for Vengeance, what you have will certainly delight any Judas Priest fan (like myself). The only gripe I really have is the length: With 58 minutes of music, it is a bit overlong. I could have done with a concise 40-45 minutes album leaving out tracks like Children of the Sun and Flamethrower, maybe also the midpaced Never the Heroes. Actually, the rest of the music is pretty solid. But is this essential listening to anyone else? Well, everyone should check out the title track. If it graps you (as it should any fan of classic metal), continue with Lightning Strike, Necromancer, Guardians/Rising from the Ruins, Spectre, Traitor's Gate and Lone Wolf.\n",
        "\nThe historical tap of the last 38-years of my life have re-emerged by way of the latest Judas Priest offering, Firepower. Admittedly, after the abomination that was Nostradamus and the better, albeit lackluster followups, I wasn't expecting much from the aging vehicle that is the Birmingham quintet. Dare I say I was almost dreading hearing it. However, as I always say in the most self-deprecating manner possible, I'm always happy to be proven wrong. \n\nFirepower,in its basest form, is a much-heralded call back to the glory days of NWOBHM and British metal in general; the road paved by Black Sabbath, Priest, Saxon, and a slew of other like-styled bands forged a solid foundation with which to stand all of those years ago. Sadly, timing and lack of long-term vision sent many of the lesser-known bands packing into the nether of anonymity, with only the truly magical among the fray able to emerge and withstand the coming years of changing genres, MTV intrusion and the era of downloading and streaming services. Judas Priest has carved for itself one hell of a long and mostly brilliant highway in the grand pantheon of metal music. I'm happy to say that the band still has some incredibly creative sparks going for itself in this recent offering.\n\nRather than breakdown tracks individually, I like to take a different approach in finding the overall mood and feel of a given album, especially if it's from a band that has been so dear to my heart (good, bad and befuddling) since 1980. For my elder ears, Firepower offers a familiar and comfortable catalyst back to a time when heavy metal was all about crafting and style and less about conformity and marketability. Make no mistake, I'm not saying they nestle into a chasm of forced familiarity; the band just knows what formula has always set them apart from the casual observers. Rob Halford has managed to use that resonating mid-range tone to its best plateau, despite being somewhat limited by Father Time. The high notes aren't as prevalent as, say, \u201cThe Sentinel\u201d or \u201cThe Ripper,\u201d but, again, style over conformity. Too many bands attempt to recapitulate on former glories to a usually embarrassing level, but Judas Priest manages to utilize its storied status of \u201clegends\u201d to its fullest potential. Knowing when to work within your personal limits is always the first step to keeping up the proverbial Jonses. \n\nFirepower manages to offer up some of the finer work that Priest has put out since the now-distant Painkiller days or yore. Musically, the band is on-point, coveting and shaping that familiar guitar tone to a perfect, leathery shine. The effects of K.K. Downing being gone aren't nearly as fluid as they were when first he left the fold; Richie Faukner has all but solidified his place in Judas Priest history by adapting to an otherwise hostile fan base questioning and scrutinizing his every note. His presence on this latest record is, without question, one of the positive elements that make it so damn good. Glenn Tipton, of course, is blazing as always, which is bittersweet now considering his recent news of his Parkinson's disease becoming too hard to muster through. I suppose that makes this album all that much sweeter, knowing how much suffering was actually put into it. That said, no amount of nostalgia could get me to lay praise to something subpar or less than acceptable in such a strong lineage. Thankfully, Judas Priest has managed to just go with the proverbial flow and create another powerful album.\n\nThe songs here are your \u201ctypical\u201d Judas Priest style heavy metal, with incredibly memorable riffs that nicely round out the overall sound. The one track that keeps coming back to me is \u201cSpectre,\u201d a heavy, pounding entry into what can only be described as a journey into the inner workings of a tempestuous visage created by veterans who know exactly what will work and what would be contrived lethargy. Thankfully, other than one full-on misstep, Priest has never really failed to accurately put across its collective vision, and Firepower is no exception; rather, it's a nice glance backward to a time when metal music was both reclusive and deeply personal for those of us on the outer fringes of society. It's always been ours to covet, and Judas Priest has always been one of the larger-than-life wielders of the well-worn battle flag for heavy metal.\n\nOther standout tracks that immediately pop into my head are \u201cLightning Strike,\u201d \u201cChildren of the Sun,\u201d \u201cNecromancer\u201d and \u201cSea of Red.\u201d That said, there isn't a weak track to be found anywhere on here, and I am more than pleasantly surprised to like it this quickly. This is a feeling I haven't had with Judas Priest since 1984 with Defenders of the Faith, an album that was sheer perfection for me, and it feels really good to put this on repeat. \n\nJudas Priest is a legend, we all know this to be an indisputable fact among those of us who are true metal fans, old and young. Sadly, not many legends hold up the lineage to any sort of acceptable or worthy standard, preferring to just keep churning out mediocrity and phoning-in the latest effort to live off of the status given to them (I'll mercilessly leave the names to your own imagination and assessment). If my two cents is worth anything here, get out and grab a physical copy of the latest JP and allow yourself to be taken back to a time when everything heavy was easily discernible and welcomed. This is going to be a nice addition to the already-fantastic Priest discography, straight from the cold, overcast umbrella of England's machine-belching Birmingham area. \n\n(Originally written for www.metalbite.com)\n",
        "\nThere are countless reasons why Judas Priest and Rob Halford are highly esteemed by the metal community, the latest being the long-running British masters' nineteenth full-length, Firepower, released Friday on CD under Epic Records. Indeed, the ballyhoo surrounding this highly anticipated affair is warranted as its fourteen solid tracks totaling just under an hour prove without a doubt you can't keep good men (or bands) down. Indeed, although he's pushing 70, one of heavy metal's greatest orators is back in top form, be it on lean and mean, uppercutting tracks such as \"Necromancer\", \"Flamethrower\" and \"Traitor's Gate\" (damn, I really should get around to reviewing the similarly named NWOBHM stalwart) or downwind, lighter waving cruisers such as \"Never the Heroes\", \"Rising From Ruins\" and a wispy yet appropriate closer in \"Sea of Red\". In fact, there are no weak tracks on this release; it's as if Halford and Co. crawled right back to their roots, in the process shedding the \"bugbear\" (i.e. generalized dramatics over watered down song constructs) which plagued the British \"juggernaut\" for the last two decades.\n\nThe downright meaty opening title track kicks things off with a bang, readily proving founding ax man Glenn Tipton and his post K.K. Downing brother in arms, Richie Faulkner, still have it in spades whilst fellow founder and bassist Ian Hill has tremendously stepped up his game as the battery, complimented by drummer Scott Travis, assures rock steady, mercurial support; effectively, the rhythm section no longer simply constitutes weak-kneed, groveling musing (as was the case on say, British Steel or Turbo) but is now unequivocally part of the big picture, namely, a stout, uncompromising and classic five-man line-up towards which up-coming generations of rivet headz will look up and continue to draw inspiration from. \n\nAlso, it's as if the devil-horn throwing veterans (not vegetarians) have combined best elements of past fan-favorite gems; we easily discern the caustic, razor-sharp edge of \"The Hellion/Electric Eye\" and \"A Touch of Evil\" in \"Firepower\" proper and \"Evil Never Dies\", a Southern bayou boggling, fire & brimstone sermon on the mount/messianic overture which snugly fits within the album's heat seeking, scorching themes, whilst the orchestral and pendulous \"Lightning Strikes\" sways like an L.A. skyscraper during an earthquake. While it's actually one of the simpler, slower tempo'd tracks, its fist drawing verses and chorus make a strong impression:\n\n\"I'll bring you the head of the demon\nI'm peeling the skin from his face\nThe life that you lead is inhuman\nIts cause and effects a disgrace\n\nYou're sowing the seeds of a nightmare from hell\nYour prayers and your demons are tolling the bell\n\nWalking through fire, fate's in my hands\nWaiting for lightning to strike\nMan on a wire, bearing the brand\nWaiting for lightning to strike\nLightning to strike!\"\n\nOne pictures Halford in his leather vest and biker cap jamming a foot up on the crowd barrier as he grips the mike and points at the crowd, while delivering his poignant vocals. The leads are also quite commendable, even if not quite as sky high or \"freewheel burning\" as before. Still, there's no denying the duo's various chops' are still combustive, emotional and effective - especially the squat, squelching solos on \"Evil Never Dies\", not to mention those rock-ish-ly soulful breaks to \"Never the Heroes\" and \"Rising from Ruins\". For their part, keyboard and atypical JP warp-drive sound fx are, as always, conservatively, albeit wisely, employed throughout. \n\nWhile the modern, straight-laced, hellishly rampant guitar riffs bring to mind present-day Accept and Lechery (yet another gripping genre purveyor who, in January, turned around and fiercely knocked one out of the park with its We Are All Born Evil third release), a couple tracks in particular sound lifted straight off the Hero, Hero 70s compilation, which mashes together the best cuts from Sad Wings of Destiny and Rocka Rolla. These would be the bluesy and swinging, as well as clean guitar progression infused, \"Children of the Sun\" and placidly mellow, minute-long and wistful piano-driven instrumental, \"Guardians\", which sweetly paves the way for the semi-crooning, semi-rocking \"Rising from the Ruins\" (I particularly revel in the fact it feels loaned from Accept's modern-day Blind Rage...How do you dig them apple jacks?!) \n\nAs much as I fancy Firepower's first half, I'm pleasantly shocked at how tight the second is. Thus, \"Flamethrower\" is no longer just a tasty (and spicy!) Dairy Queen burger, but a freaking raw, hair-raising sonic experience thanks to its quirky yet pummelling palm-muted riff-age which roughly yanks the rug beneath you once the crankily cranked up and side-winding chorus rounds the bend. This is classic Priest, classic Halford at his most jovial and sardonic. I love how the deceptively gay, sing-along pre-chorus brusquely transitions into said grouchy brow-beater of a refrain: \n\n\"You're on the run from the stun of the flame thrower\nSealing your fate, incinerate by the flame thrower!\"\n\nNow, excuse the overt track-by-track play-by-play here, but hot diggity! The following haphazard brooder of an \"evil\" track, \"Specter\", is yet another sleazily slick humdinger sure to to make countless denizens rush over to e-bay in order to purchase a commemorative Firepower T-shirt! Commencing with said killer cosmic electronics, this cut possesses an undeniable avant-garde, hypnotic flair which assuredly brings on fond recollections of Stained Class, from its poised, demonic mnemonics to Halford's lazily rendered and spell-binding evocations alongside a rad as all-get out, space-faring solo section...All I can say here is \"Yippie!\" as it just may be my preferred track as far as nostalgia goes - although the loud and proud, Dio-ish \"No Surrender\" and punchy, Black Sabbath evoking \"Lone Wolf\" give it a good run for its money. \n\nMarch 9th was a heck of day; not only was it my sister/eldest nephew's birthday, but also marked the grandiose return of one of metal's finest and timeless greats. In addition to being a super well-rounded, super solid effort, I'd even venture as far as ranking Firepower as one of JP's strongest offerings alongside Sad Wings of Destiny, Sin After Sin, Stained Class, Screaming For Vengeance, Defenders of the Faith and Painkiller. Furthermore, seeing the legend play live sits high on my bucket list so I can breathe easy now and revel in the fact it's still a viable possibility considering Halford doesn't appear ready to hang up his bootstraps. For now, heed the call and home in on Firepower asap as it's a golden opportunity to re-kindle the flame.\n",
        "\nFirepower from Judas Priest is a very well written album. It's mind-blowing to know that after 49 years of releasing solid and highly influential music, Judas Priest can still bring forth something this outstanding. Rob Halford's vocals on this album sounds as though he had recorded it in his younger years with the band, notably the ''British Steel'' era. Yes, its that good. The guitar solos from Tipton and Faulkner are very well composed and really have a striking 80's era feeling. The drumming ranges from fast to slow to mid-paced which at times makes it predictable when the guitar solo would kick in. Firepower is about 58 minutes long, but time moves fast when listening to it; and once its over you're left yearning for more. Most of the songs are very memorable thanks to the majestic guitar work from Faulkner and Tipton and of course Halford's absolutely commanding vocal deliveries. Songs such as Firepower, Traitors Gate and Spectre happen to be my favorites on an album in which every track competes to be the best. Most of the album is mid-paced with Firepower being the fastest track on the record. Personally, I think Halford's screams sound better on slower tracks; it has been that way since I first heard Victim of Changes on Sad Wings of Destiny. Firepower evokes feelings of hearing their earlier material especially with songs like Never the Heroes and Spectres which reminds me of \"Night Comes Down\" off Defenders of the Faith. The album closes with \"Sea of Red\" which begins with an acoustic guitar and gracefully builds towards the end with the electrical guitar being introduced.\n\nOverall the album is an excellent entry into an already prodigious catalog by a band that refuses to step down from the throne. Judas Priest seems to have tossed kerosene on a flame that has never ceased in burning bright with passion for the genre. Firepower serves as both a special release for the die-hard Judas Priest fans and newcomers now discovering the band. I am absolutely looking forward to the next album Judas Priest has to offer the metal world given the stunning musical performance displayed on Firepower. At the current echelon of Priest's career, one must acknowledge the fact that they sound just as good as they did 34 years ago; which is quite an amazing feat to accomplish after performing live and releasing albums for nearly half a century. Long live the Priest!\n",
        "\nLook who's back! Judas Priest sadly sounded quite old, tired and uninspired on the depressing last output Redeemer of Souls. On Firepower, the band still sounds somewhat uninspired but it doesn't sound old and tired anymore at all. \n\nThis album might be the band's most energizing record since Jugulator two decades earlier. Rob Halford's vocals sound quite diversified as he hits high notes perfectly as in the strong opener and title track ''Firepower'' but he also nails the lower registers in ''Evil Never Dies'' which is one of the very best songs of the band since the singer rejoined the band fifteen years ago.\n\nRichie Faulkner's guitar play already sounded promising and was one of the few positive elements on the last output. He certainly is an integral part of the band today. His melodic and skilled guitar play harmonizes perfectly with Glenn Tipton's classic heavy metal riffing. This means that the guitar play on this album sounds equally fresh and traditional. ''Necromancer'' is a song with modern production and sinister riffs recalling more contemporary genres such as industrial metal but its backbone is still melodic heavy metal of the early eighties. The infectious melodies of ''Spectre'' are played with feeling but the track also offers pounding mid-paced riffs supported by a vibrant rhythm section and finally comes along with a technically impressive and gloomily atmospheric guitar solo that might as well be the best on the record. Firepower might be Judas Priest's most balanced record between experience and freshness.\n\nThe rhythm section isn't spectacular by any means but adds a solid dose of oomph to the record. Even a more mid-paced and melodic tune like ''Never the Heroes'' convinces with a few vibrant bass lines and a drum play that follows the smooth undertone of the tune but plays it with a lot of feeling. The energizing and melodic ''Traitors Gate'' has a vivid pace and even a few select up-tempo drum passages that make all the band members sound at least thirty years younger than they actually are. While the rhythm session wasn't too spectacular on some of the more recent records, it really has a bigger impact on Firepower without being overproduced.\n\nThe only element one could criticize is that Judas Priest certainly doesn't reinvent the genre. There are a few nice ideas like the vintage instrumental ''Guardians'' with its melancholic piano sounds leading towards almost anthemic guitar melodies but large parts of the album offer heavy metal by the numbers. One could argue that a band of old age doesn't need to innovate anyway and I certainly would agree. However, the band recently came across with a doom metal monster like ''Lochness'' or the conceptual double record Nostradamus which proved that the band was still willing to experiment. This will isn't present on Firepower which recalls the gripping heaviness of Ram It Down, at times even the power and speed of Painkiller and on a few select occasions the more industrial and sinister sound from Jugulator. While Firepower isn't surprising, this mixture makes for a fluid record that is enjoyable to listen to from start to finish. If you like Judas Priest, you will certainly enjoy Firepower.\n\nMy final verdict on Firepower is very positive. The band proves it still has its reason to be and offers an album that sounds both fresh and traditional. Rob Halford's vocal performance is spectacular for his age, the rhythm section takes some more presence that before, the guitar players develop great chemistry and the song writing is more concise than on the predecessor. The record even includes some songs that have the potential to be remembered like the skillfully sung mid-paced ''Evil Never Dies'', the experimental ''Spectre'' meandering between gloomy and melodic parts and the heavy stomper ''Lone Wolf'' that recalls Black Sabbath at its very best. Judas Priest easily beats the recent outputs of similar bands like my favorites Iron Maiden or Saxon. I'm going to attend one of the band's concerts by the end of the month and after listening to Firepower, I'm really looking forward to it.\n",
        "\nAfter the regular Redeemer of Souls, these british sirs of Birmingham have come with this new release entitled \"Firepower\". While the cover is not the best achieved, since nothing beats Metallian's or Hellion's one, is a very worked that undoubtedly will call the attention of every metalhead who wants to buy it. Attractive to eyes, yes, judging by the content and the quality of it. And I can swear that you won't regret it at all. Could Judas Priest continue to release more albums or simply close their career with this worthy stuff? Time will show it, and they will continue to give their best. The reality is that this is the best thing they ever produced since Painkiller, far surpasses poor production and Halford's vocal reluctance from \"Redeemer of Souls\", the pompousness of \"Nostradamus\" and the bad songwriting of \"Angel of Retribution\". Imagine combining these worst characteristics of cited albums, and put together in a single album, as a result, aberrations as Point of Entry emerge from the ground.\n\nAfter advances of title track and Lightning Strike, my expectations were little enthusiastic, and the number of songs seemed enormous and risky to me. After tasting slowly the whole album, my expectations were from \"regular\" to \"good\". There are a lot of jewels to highlight here, there are certain inspiration and dedication from the musicians. The production is polished and more elaborate than previous work, very Painkiller-like, especially the first songs. \"Risings From The Ruin\", \"Traitors Gate\" and \"Sea of Red\" are candidates to be consecrated as instant epics. I mean, if you enjoyed Beyond Realms to Death or Blood Red Skies in the past, rest assured that you'll be delighted with those ones. Richie Faulkner seems to become increasingly familiar with the band, and he's always there to meet the demands and patterns if we talk about musicianship. There's no to talk much Scot and Ian, they're just fine as always. Rob Halford sounds less forced than on Redeemer of Souls and anyone already thought that the end of Judas Priest was coming due to instability and the \"I can't anymore\" of Halford in terms of vocals performance. There are also British Steel moments to be found on the album, it's as if they reinvented and extracted the best of each album from their entire collection. Even the \"Guardians\" piano-wink is a clear reminiscent of Sad Wings of Destiny material.\n\nNot in vain Deep Purple, Judas Priest and Iron Maiden are (affectionately) my favorite prehistoric ones, because in a world where pioneers are ceasing to exist on the scene, these British bands continue to squeeze and scrutinize their creative juice. Note how Black Sabbath has retired because of different reasons unlike Motorhead, which this last one could continue to contribute to metal music if not for Lemmy's decease. In general lines, an outstanding work worthy to invest your money, savings, whatever. On the podium I place Painkiller, Sad Wings, Screaming, Defenders, Sin After Sin and Stained Class; in a second step are Rocka Rolla, Ram It Down, British Steel, Killing Machine and... this record! While in a third step are Redeemer, Jugulator, and Angel. The remaining discs are pariahs. If you're a demanding listener and you want to place this record to the same level of musical standards you're used to listening to, don't do it. Is not just ridiculous, just not worth it. Be mature and give it a chance. Enough said.\n",
        "\nThis is about as dark and heavy/thrashy that Judas Priest would get with Dave Holland. Having learned from the British Steel to Point of Entry mishap, Priest decided to swing around in a much more sinister direction for the follow up to their commercial monster Screaming For Vengeance. There's a mood here that we haven't quite gotten from Priest since Stained Class.\n\nWith that said, I have a hard time agreeing with the metal maniacs that believe this is Priest's finest offering of the 80s. I mean it has a few things that it's earlier counterpart doesn't (we went from the Falconzord to its convoluted looking brother Pingaszord for one). There is certainly a more morbid atmosphere to be found here rather than there as well. So I can sort of see where they are coming from. At first you could even argue that the weird moments that were on SFV, like Fever and Pain & Pleasure just aren't here. Except...they are. Theose moments are called Night Comes Down and Love Bites. Some of you might like these songs, guess what, I love them too, but let's not pretend that these lighter moments are the second coming of Beyond The Realms of Death. Another point against this album is Eat Me Alive, which just sucks. No, it's not because of \"I'm gonna force you at gunpoint to eat me alive,\" it's the fact that the song sounds like something a hardcore band would write to take the piss out of bands like Priest and Maiden because they don't understand what makes heavy metal great music\n\nNonetheless, at this point in the timeline Judas Priest are becoming more and more consistent. Side A of this album just might be the greatest album side of Judas Priest's career. An absolutely scorching four song killing streak consisting of speed metal symphonies Freewheel Burning and Jawbreaker, respectable arena attempt with Rock Hard, Ride Free, and the pre-Helloween EP power metal fury of The Sentinel. Other killer songs include Night Comes Down, and Rob Halligan Jr.'s attempt to make a more menacing Green Manalishi, Some Heads Are Gonna Roll. The production, while, again, not quite as crystalline as its predecessor is still fairly heavy and won't confuse any ignorant nu-metal fans of this being glam metal. People also tell me that Dave Holland manages one or two decent double bass passages here, but I can't quite hear them (Jawbreaker maybe?).\n\nDefenders of the Faith is another essential metal classic from the Priest. It doesn't quite have the teeth of a Painkiller, but if you want to see the genesis of those particular molars, that's the best reason I can think of why you would want to get this before Painkiller.\n",
        "\nIt could be argued that this is the most important album Judas Priest ever made. Yes, more important than the 70s albums (more than Stained Class? Ask me when I'm not high). The importance of this album can be stated in two simple words: Co-opting commerciality.\n\nOne thing that's frequently reviled by the metal community is just how important record sales and good business are in metal. Not everyone is equipped with the proper mental tools to dig underground at first. It's another reason why it was so frustrating that all those damn hairbands were so successful in the 80s. It was a complete watering down of the music. It was like Pat Boone covering Little Richard. Yes, British Steel was a commercial success before this album, but this album was a bigger success and it was a better album. Better songs, better track combinations, even Dave Holland seems to pull his act together for his best drum performance ever in Riding On The Wind.\n\nAnother important factor is that even the weaker moments aren't too soft. Even the supposed \"ballads\" like (Take) These Chains and Fever are merely soft for a short time before giving way to a AC/DC-esque bash. This is heavy fucking metal the way it was made to be played, and the fact that You've Got Another Thing Comin' was just another track that just happened to be the biggest success of Priests's career is just another reason why this album has the acclaim and respect it deserves. I'm much less inclined to shove Painkiller in the face of someone who says this is the best Priest album over British Steel.\n\nAnd that production, Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song, is this production amazing or what? This is the perfect combination of an \"of it's time\" production job and a \"timeless\" production job. This is better than anything Martin Birch ever accomplished. The guitar tone alone, no one would dare call this classic rock. If there is a flaw with this album (or at least any of the re-releases), its that I still don't understand why anyone still assumes in the current year that The Hellion and Electric Eye should be two separate tracks. Priest never have substituted one before the other live! They even corrected this flaw on Priest...Live! Never dissuade your listeners right to shuffle, dear artists! Thank God for the iTunes join tracks function.\n\nHighlights: The aforementioned Hellion/Electric Eye and You've Got Another Thing Comin are popular staples from this album for a very, very good reason. They're just great songs, with Hellion in particular being just about the greatest intro to an album ever! Other notable tracks include mid-paced rocker Bloodstone, which makes me think wonder just how much David Draiman stole from Rob Halford, Devil's Child being the greatest Brian Johnson era AC/DC song the Young brothers never wrote. But this album is legendary for the title track alone. This song could have been on any of the 70s albums and what have instantly stole the show. Rob is at his most dastardly and psychotic on this song, particularly with the final salvo of \"SCREAMING...VENGEANCE.\" It segues into YGATC so perfectly that one almost, almost wishes two songs were one big Rush-esque epic.\n\nScreaming For Vengeance is a must own for anyone calling themselves a fan of rock & roll, full stop. It is the gold standard of artistic integrity and accessibility than many bands try and fail to match. If you don't own this, run to buy it yesterday.\n",
        "\nHaving tasted the sourness of inconsistency, Judas Priest seemingly recovered their ways in the ninth studio album, without representing a return to the good old songwriting habits. Instead, the band relied on the commercial formula used in the late 1970s. The difference is that this time the album features numbers holding a heaviness of bestial proportions that they did not dare to write for previous releases (perhaps, with the only exceptions of \"Rapid Fire\" and \"Running Wild\"). However, the band kept the tendency of including filling material, and this is what affects its consistency in general. If these Britons had dealt more carefully with the songwriting department, something better could have resulted.\n\nIn general terms, the performance from Tipton and Downing displayed substantial improvements compared to previous studio albums. They sound more natural, showing that they can keep on doing what they are best known for. The only weakness is still the drumming. For whatever the reason, since Dave Holland joined the band, the drumming in the albums he features is too distorted by sound effects, and his technique is not able to reach the levels of quality shown by other drummers that used to play for the band. It does not mean he is a bad drummer, is just that his technique is way too average, and as a result, the exciting moments are quite a few.\n\nThe album starts in quite an impressive fashion with the instrumental prelude \"The Hellion\", which features some of the best riffs played by the twin-guitarists during the 1908s, and heralds one of the best songs in their catalog: \"Electric Eye\". This number is greatly played and written, as well as, a perfect precursor for the space-themed power metal played by bands like Scanner and Screamer. The next number is another highlight, and of those few moments provided by Holland. Wow! It is fucking heavy, speedish and steps on the border that divides men from children, and so on. Then, \"Bloodstone\" runs a little bit slower, but is still a killer. Its intro riff is a masterpiece in guitar playing, while Holland still sounds in good shape at this point. These three pieces make up a solid part of the album, what a godly beginning! Here is where the band put things together.\n\nUnfortunately, the album going forward becomes too dull and is quite irregular. The title track and the AC/DC-inspired closing number get lost between some ballads like \"Pain and Pleasure\" and \"Fever\", which are not even half as good as (for instance) \"Beyond the Realms of Death\". Regarding the title track, it represents a comeback point in the album after the dull ballads. Its frantic speed and insane drumming almost destroyed Halford's lungs on account of the effort he makes to reach the velocity of this outrageous speed metal number. Along with the astonishing opening section of the album, this song is part of the most memorable moments thereof. With no doubts, this work is quite a remarkable part of their catalog, but its inconsistency does not allow it to reach the heights of the band's earliest stuff. Anyway, it is still something that should be part of your collection.\n",
        "\nJudas Priest is a name every metalhead knows. Therefore I won't waste time going over much band history because not only would I be wasting the time of others much more knowledgeable then myself. I would also be wasting my time by making this review redundant for the simple reason of not knowing much at all about the history of this band and metal in general. There is one thing I do know. This album is a classic that rules very much. Before the recording of the band's debut album, the very good Rocka Rolla, the band found its major core for the next several years in Rob Halford and Glenn Tipton. Judas Priest went on to record Rocka Rolla, and then eight more studio albums, while being hailed as one of the best heavy metal bands in the world. Then for some fans of the band a terrible album happened. Turbo was released, an album which many fans hated or downright condemned, although not me. Experiments were added to their work, such as synths for example, an unforgivable decision for some. Again, although, not me. But not even the most faithful fans (or unfaithful for that matter) knew what greatness was to happen after Ram It Down.\n\nJudas Priest released Painkiller. It was an instant classic. Painkiller is a heavy metal masterpiece, and its take no prisoners style was very influential over the next decade and a half, especially to power metal bands. Every song is strong on Painkiller. Such as the riff heavy, intense title track with the greatest solos around; the short and of course energetic Leather Rebel; The very metallic huge sounding Metal Meltdown; or the mid paced brooding and dark Between the Hammer and the Anvil; each song is of course more than worthy of listening to. Among the finest moments of the album come from the intense riffing combined with Halford's godly vocals. In almost all of the songs, the guitar work is very aggressive, especially in the relentless title track. Special mention to me is the song Hell Patrol. And especially the riffs and to a certain extent the solos. But these riffs drive the song forward to great things rarely heard in music period let alone heavy metal. Quite the perfect metal song both in title and overall experience with brilliant lyrics. Judas Priest now had a new drummer named Scott Travis who in technical ability had enough chops by a huge measure to make everything he put down on tape work to the letter. His highlights include the title track and Night crawler.\n\nIf Painkiller had a weak point, it wouldn't be the lyrics and people who care about lyrics over other aspects of music I don't agree with. To each his own. The album doesn't have any weak points anyway that I can find. Not a nice try detractors. This album also features stellar production work with a near perfect drum and guitar sound. Painkiller is influential aggression, particularly in the field of power metal, where many bands tried to copy or recreate it's intense riffing and unforgettable leads in their own albums. Painkiller is easily one of the all time great metal albums, and definitely ranks among Judas Priest's top 3 albums.\n",
        "\nJudas Priest after their third album were in a state of flux. After an average hard rock debut in the form of 'Rocka Rolla', their next two records \u2013 the seminal 'Sad Wings Of Destiny' and the somewhat more varied 'Sin After Sin' \u2013 had shifted the band\u2019s sound towards heavier territory. However, 'Sad Wings', despite its heaviosity, still sounded like a seventies band developing a harder edge and a darker atmosphere to their music. 'Sin After Sin' boasted some bold steps such as the proto-thrash \u2018Dissident Aggressor\u2019, but also some songs which seemed to still be rooted in the band\u2019s past, for example \u2018Last Rose Of Summer\u2019. However, with their fourth album \u2013 the gloomily titled \u2018Stained Class\u2019 - Priest shifted up a gear.\n\nIt is still something of a mystery where the laser-like focus and relentlessness that dominates 'Stained Class' came from. Some might point to new member Les Binks, a significantly better drummer than any the band had had previously (with the exception of Simon Phillips), capable of solid double-bass work and tight playing as demonstrated on the proto-speed metal opener \u2018Exciter\u2019. Some might highlight the contributions of producer Dennis Mackay, who helped to refine the band's sound in the studio by emphasising the importance of getting to the point and putting the message across directly when it came to the song writing. Others might simply note that a band\u2019s natural development over the course of time will enable them to hone their craft after several albums, and therefore the quantum leap Priest took here was to be expected. What the record does seem to show, however, is that Judas Priest had found a steely, remorseless determination by early 1978, and were fully engaged with their song writing and the point of their message like never before.\n\nThe fat of their first few albums falls away here, ruthlessly trimmed. In its place are nine songs of tight intensity, diamond hard, yet coal-black in their seriousness. Priest take the opportunity on 'Stained Class' to look into the darker corners of human history and the psyche with a commitment that still feels haunting and eerie to the listener, even four decades on. Although the previous two albums had ventured into similar territory, here the message of the album is just remorseless. The lyrics look for darkness and find it everywhere, dwelling almost exclusively on downbeat subjects such as war, invasion, colonization and the poignancy over the relentless savagery man is capable of. This gloom pervades the record. Only the aforementioned \u2018Exciter\u2019 seems to lift its head up and look to the heavens, telling of a mythical being from the skies who will leap among mankind with \u201ccombusting dance\u201d until we only have the option to \u201cfall to your knees and repent if you please!\u201d Elsewhere on the title track, however, Halford mournfully opines that it may be too late, that society\u2019s heart is irredeemably tainted, and is no longer clean as it was \u201clong ago, when man was king\u201d. The final track, \u2018Heroes End\u2019, seems to take these conclusions to the logical point that in this world, only the good die young. \u201cWhy do you have to die to be a hero?\u201d Halford muses, seemingly metaphorically shaking his head. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame a legend begins at its end\u2026.\u201d\n\nThe darkness and inner turmoil laid down into the grooves is well and truly hammered home by the musical style Priest commit to here. No pianos or acoustic songs ease the ambience a little, as they did on the previous two records. This is metal to the core, all the way through, the band playing ferociously and with a sense of discipline and a take-no-prisoners attitude that is almost frightening. The album is a definite pointer towards the thrash and speed metal scene of the 1980s in this regard, and can be truly described as game-changing. For the first time across a full LP, another band had taken heavy metal beyond where Sabbath had pushed the idea. It is difficult to imagine the Big Four thrash bands, or much of the NWOBHM without this record, and listening back to it now one can see why. It feels like a step change from anything made prior. Something more intense, faster, focused, driven. When considered, 'Stained Class' is easily the most influential record Priest have ever made, concentrating the disparate energies of the fledgling heavy metal scene of the late 1970s into a much harder-edged beast, decisively cutting ties with the past and pointing to the future. Priest well and truly mean business here in a way that they have rarely done before or since, and arguably would not truly do so again until 1990's 'Painkiller'.\n\nThe combination of tighter, more aggressive music and the gloom of the lyrics draw you in whether you like it or not. The intensity of the music grabs you from the start and never lets you go for a single second. Every solo Tipton and Downing play is like a welder\u2019s torch, pinpoint and piercing, white hot and pulsing with the core energy that is at the heart of heavy metal and supplies its immediacy, its very life force. Every riff is precise and ruthless, drilling into your psyche. The result is an album it\u2019s impossible to just ignore, or apathetically leave on in the background. It takes the listener by the scruff of the neck and shows them the darkness, the melancholy, the sadness. Yet, somehow, it does not leave one feeling drained or downbeat, perhaps because of two things. Firstly, the sheer energy of the riffs and the band\u2019s playing is invigorating. The second factor is that no other band has really sounded like Priest did in their 1976-78 period, and arguably never will. The vibe of the Priest albums from this time is almost indescribably distinctive. The records are gloomy and dark, but in a way that feels observant rather than resigned. It is a darkness, a brooding, sombre melancholy permeating the music, but one which it is somehow cathartic or even cleansing to dwell in for a while, to allow oneself to wander in. We all get moments of sombreness, ponderance and melancholy in our lives, to varying degrees. Priest in this period seem to tap into it in a way few other bands have truly managed.\n\nArguably, this vibe and feeling finds its truest, rawest expression in the second to last track on the album, the epic ballad \u2018Beyond The Realms Of Death\u2019, a song infused with Halford\u2019s sadness at the depths people can be dragged under by depression, from the sombre, melancholic opening chords (written by Binks) to Halford\u2019s screams in the chorus, pleading to the cosmos at large to \u201ckeep this world, with all its sin, it\u2019s not fit for living in\u2026.\u201d, before finally lamenting in the closing verse that so many others like the main protagonist in the song \u201cseem to have lost the will\u201d, and featuring a truly unreal solo from Tipton that wails with raw emotion and power. Words cannot do this song justice, and it is recommended that anyone getting into Priest and curious about 'Stained Class' should start with this track to get an idea of what the album is about. It stands to this day as Priest\u2019s finest hour, a song of rare, deep feeling and sorrow, echoing the sadness felt by so many down the ages in a way that makes the listener empathise and reach their own catharsis.\n\nJudas Priest would not make an album that approached the depths and darkness found on this record for nearly twenty years. Only after an enforced layoff in the 1990s did the relentless, incendiary drive, gloom and venom that had fuelled 'Stained Class' truly return with the savage \u2018Jugulator\u2019 album. In the years to follow the band would also mostly retreat from the driving speed metal tempos laid down on 'Stained Class' which would influence so many bands in the 1980s, perhaps due to the departure of Les Binks from the drum stool prior to 1980. The overall impression is that the band were possibly unable and unwilling to dwell in gloom and sombreness for much longer by 1978, and once the record was made consciously turned away towards lighter styles and melodies, although certain songs and albums still retained the dark, brooding melancholy vibes from their late 1970s period here and there. Priest\u2019s change of direction made them household names, particularly in America, and deservedly so. Yet forty years on, 'Stained Class' still stands at the heart of the Priest discography, a dark monolith of unrelenting power, infused with the sorrows of its protagonists who have looked into the depths of the world and humanity, and found them sorely wanting. It still sounds today like it has been freshly forged from the furnace, glowing and pulsating with the raw energy that is the force not just of heavy metal music, but life and nature itself. It is, therefore, highly recommended not just for anyone curious about getting into Judas Priest\u2019s body of work but also for anyone who wants to know and understand more about the foundations and keystones of heavy metal.\n",
        "\nWho thought that after Epitaph, especially after K.K. Downing's departure, Judas Priest would release another album ever again? After I've heard about this back then, I was totally excited and thanked God for blessing me with another Judas Priest work, especially because to my ears, neither Judas Priest, nor the solo projects of Halford have released anything bad yet. I even liked most of the totally ridiculous album Turbo and to me, Nostradamus was an epic masterpiece.\n\nBut on Redeemer of Souls, Judas Priest showed that they clearly had no ideas anymore, nor the power to at least keep the flame burning they've ignited and kept burning during their whole career. Already the two singles, the title track and March of the Damned, were totally old man's rock music and I'm sure that nobody would have even cared about these songs if any other band would have written them. But in case of Judas Priest they even get cheered on when they play this live, while most of the other songs that clearly have more life and energy in have never found their way to the concerts.\n\nIt's really sad to hear that Judas Priest tried to make acoustic references on each of the songs to their albums they've released so far. They try to sound heavy on Dragonaut and Sword of Damocles like back then on Angel of Retribution, they try to unleash the power they had back then on Painkiller with Battle Cry and Metalizer or try to sound epic like on Ram It Down with Halls of Valhalla. Cross Fire and Snakebites from the Special Edition should remind of British Steel and songs like Cold Blooded, Bring It On and Hell & Back should refer to the Screaming for Vengeance/Defenders of the Faith times. But you can clearly hear that these guys have already reached the zenith of their creativity and especially of their stamina, because the songs get boring at the second where the opening finishes. Except for the songs Metalizer and Battle Cry with its epic solo duet, none of the other songs are even able to reach your ear. I have literally listened to the songs without clearly recognizing them.\n\nIt really hurts me to say that Judas Priest, one of my former favorite bands died with this album, because the saddest thing is that they clearly haven't done anything shitty in their whole career. Halford and the others created hymns and pushed themselves further with every album they've released, they didn't betray their fans, they didn't make shitty unlistenable experiments, so the sad thing is that the guys from Judas Priest simply don't have the power to rock like about 10 years ago.\n\nSo after this really uninspiring adventure of 17 songs, I was even sadder when I've listened to their farewell song Never Forget. Unfortunately, Redeemer of Souls is a totally powerless album with barely any catchy song that was able to keep in my ears.\n",
        "\nLive albums are often debatable releases, especially since Judas Priest has released quite a few of them in its career. A Touch of Evil: Live is however an output that makes sense from several points of view. First of all, it's the first live album in over six years when Tim ''Ripper'' Owens was still in the band and celebrates the last two world tours with Rob Halford. Secondly, the album focuses on songs from the band's two most recent studio albums Angel of Retribution and Nostradamus. Thirdly, the other tracks are mostly rarities that the band doesn't play regularly except for the classic ''Painkiller'' which was though released for a very first time featuring Rob Halford on vocals on this record.\n\nThe quality of the eleven songs is very good. Even the more boring tunes from the sluggish Nostradamus such as ''Death'' and ''Prophecy'' evoke a gripping atmosphere and passionate vibe in concert. The thrashing performance of ''Dissident Aggressor'' won the Grammy for Best Metal Performance which is an unusual but justified choice. The live version of ''Painkiller'' is absolutely stunning and pushes the limits both instrumentally and vocally to end the record with a gigantic bang. The sound of the instruments and vocals is aggressive but organic and easily surpasses the studio versions. The fact that some noises of the crowds are exaggeratedly raised in the mix doesn't harm either and adds some more vivid live atmosphere. Plus, Judas Priest has already done this on the critically acclaimed Unleashed in the East.\n\nThere exist numerous versions of this release featuring different bonus tracks. Die-hard Judas Priest fans should get their hands on the Japanese version with the dreamy performance of ''Worth Fighting For'' and the aggressive rendition of ''Deal with the Devil'' that ends the bonus section on a high note. Other versions include the smooth ballad ''Angel'' or the classic ''Breaking the Law'' that isn't really essential anymore.\n\nThe downside some people might bring up is the fact that A Touch of Evil: Live doesn't feature one full length concert but tracks recorded in 2005 and 2008 in different locations. Usually, I prefer a coherent release with a complete set from one location but in this particular case, Judas Priests attempted to focus on more recent and rare material which makes this release stand out. Even though a few more interactions with the crowd would have been enjoyable, it's not a bad move to abandom formalities and deliver one hour or so of passionate heavy metal music performed on stage. It's something the band had never attempted before and a welcome change compared to the numerous other live albums. This release will entertain you for sure.\n\nI would even say that A Touch of Evil: Live is Judas Priest's most interesting live release since Rob Halford joined the band nearly one and a half decades ago. It doesn't beat the legendary Unleashed in the East release of the late seventies and I've always had a soft spot for the live records involving Tim ''Ripper'' Owens but A Touch of Evil: Live certainly is better than its reputation and a welcome addition to the collection of any occasional or faithful fan of the band while new fans should rather stick to a more traditional live album or compilation.\n",
        "\nIt had to happen. But WHY?! Just like Judas Priest took the metal throne from Sabbath's clutches a decade before, the second most influential Birmingham (and world) metal outfit saw themselves outpaced and deposed by a London quintet named after an iconic torture instrument. And as with Sabbath, the throne was Priest's to lose, which they did following their mentors' steps by producing sub-par material in a pathetic attempt to 'sound fresh'. As the Irons passed them by, heading into a kingly first-place finish of the 80s decade in the classic metal category, the Priest reached its lowest point, plummeting from the glorious heights of Defenders of the Faith into the unexpected vapidity of Turbo, or as I like to call it, Rejecters of the Faith, an album that is as heavy and interesting as the cardboard mattress of an unfortunate hobo. That's what happens when you trade the badass Metallian with its baboon/lion menacing stare, fiery roar and two pairs of red-hot Gatling guns for a nail-polished bland hand grasping a kinky-android-looking gear shift. \n\nTruth be told, Iron Maiden's discography had been more exciting and consistent in quality that Priest's during the 80s, but at least, before this album, both bands were on the top echelons of classic metal mastery. The turn for the worse was a decision Priest took due to several factors, but since Defenders of the Faith and its subsequent tour had been commercially successful, money was not an issue. Supreme guitar duo Tipton and Downing manifested their appreciation for the new sounds and technologies the mid 80s were providing, a trait they shared with Dave Murray and Adrian Smith, as noticeable on Somewhere in Time. But that's where the comparisons ended between those two great Brit bands, and their '86 releases. Probably the main reason that made Priest go all glammy on us, was Rob Halford's experiencing really tough times. But the Metal God, who is no ordinary man, decided to not be dragged down, and instead focused his passion in being more colorful and changing his lyrical subjects into more laid back and casual themes (meaning: 'pop'). Post-apocalyptic antiheroes and belligerent metallic beasts where replaced by relationship issues, the merry aspects of rock 'n' roll life, self-esteem and a disdain for censorship and well, \u201cParental Guidance\u201d.\n\nCan't blame the Metal God, nor the rest of the Priest for steering this way. If this is what needed to be done so they could carry on, then we're more than grateful, as just four years after this they would produce la cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of all-time metal music with the Painkiller. But that doesn't erase the fact that this sucks big time. BIG FUCKING TIME. Turbo is an album so rooted in mid 80s clich\u00e9s that as I listen to it I can't avoid picking up the scent of cheap hair spray and feeling my denim jeans turning to spandex. Indeed, the only positive aspect I can think about this, apart from saving the Metal God's emotional sanity, is that a few of the tunes here provide a casual, playful relief from time to time. The title-track and \u201cLocked In\u201d are undoubtedly catchy, and once the cheese bombardment leaves your 'I-only-listen-to-real-metal' defenses like a fondue, you can't help but to consider adding them to your 'hidden guilty pleasures' list. A couple of other songs are saved from utter suckage by perhaps a pair of solid riffs or a kick-ass solo (\u201cHot for Love\u201d), but don't offer much apart from that. \u201cWhite Nights\u2026\u201d unabashedly borrows more AC/DC than needed, even when the style of the Aussies was starting to feel tiresome already at that time. And I won't waste time in writing about other tracks\u2026 with the exception of \u201cOut in the Cold\u201d, The six-minute Side B opener is a somewhat different specimen, more serious in tone, like a longer, yet lighter spiritual younger brother of \u201cLove Bites\u201d from Defenders, featuring a compelling synth intro. That one and the first two tracks are the only passable material here. \n\nFor those of you money wasters, if you happen to own the 2001 Remaster, you can enjoy a more than decent bonus track named \u201cAll Fired Up\u201d, which recalls more the style of the preceding record, and basically it's just as good as the best track on the original pressing. The original idea for Priest was a Twin Turbos double album with a second LP of harder and faster songs that never came to be, some of the unused tracks appearing on Ram It Down instead, but I can't think why \u201cAll Fired Up\u201d wasn't used in any of those releases. In any case, its existence alone is not good reason enough to buy this, unless you're a Judas Priest completionist. And in that case I'd advise to get the Turbo 30 version instead, which has an appealing retro-80s color palette on the original Doug Johnson cover artwork and a dual disc live concert from the Fuel for Life World Tour gigs. \n\nAs a Judas Priest fan (without-'atic'), Turbo signifies a descent in quality that just can't be forgiven, even to the Metal Gods. But for the record, I do dig Doug Johnson's nail polish design.\n",
        "\nIf I had a nickel for every rube I encountered whose preferred Judas Priest track is (gulp) \"Metal Gods\" or (groan!) \"United\" - which, by the way, sounds like a nebbish 70s advert for the now consolidated pan-global airline - I'd use the money to build a JP intensive boot camp (sanitarium?) where the clarion call would consist of the main riff to either \"Tyrant\" or anything off Stained Class and where pre-1980 Priest lore would make up the better part of the curriculum (with severe repercussions for anyone humming the pedestrian riff to \"Breaking The Law\" or worse, chanting the godawful chorus to \"Living After Midnight\"). \n\nJoshing aside, and excluding the revved up \"Rapid Fire\", \"Grinder\" and \"Steeler\", what is there to rave about in regards to the commercially watered down errant NWOBHM wayfarer which is 1980's British Steel? Not much, as apparently I'm not alone in my crestfallen deception, judging from its host of despondent reviews. \n\nAt least things get off to a decent start with \"Rapid Fire\" and its compelling, hard-driven choogling; the riff change at 01:20 is flawlessly executed while the crisp, hypnotic, single string riffing shortly after has something of a Stained Class - and modern day Wolf - feel . As well, the ensuing battalion of solos sees them fired off like so many machine gun bursts. Drummer Dave Holland actually stands out by way of his \"rapid\" jab-like beats and fills. Also, the lyrics are kind of fun: \"Pounding the world/ Like a battering ram/ Forging the furnace/ For the final grand slam\u2026\" \n\nWhile the pre-chorus to \"Metal Gods\" sounds like the killer chorus to \"Grinder\" (my go-to track on this otherwise lacklustre release) vocal and riff wise, its actual chorus just kills it - not in a good way - as it's way too anthemic in a corny \"United\"/ \"clap your hands, stomp your feet\" way. To be fair, the leads are your usual K.K. Downing/ Glenn Tipton fare, that is scorching hot and piercing but the eventual return to (ill) form lumps this track in with British Steele's weaker fare, which largely makes up the A side.\n\nUnpleasant business aside, allow me to offer warranted praise to British Steele's top highlight, the poised up stroke JP classic which is \"Grinder\", a fiery, grouchy brow beater of a track complete with a highly expressive, off-the-chart solo up there with any of K.K.Downing and Glenn Tipton's magic from Sin After Sin, Stained Class, and some of the winners off early 80s stuff such as Screaming For Vengeance, Point Of Entry and Defenders Of The Faith (sorry Turbo, what did you expect?!). \n\nUnfortunately, the excitement's short-lived as what could be JP's worst outright stinker, \"United\" comes next. The less said about this track the better; I think the title of this review says all but for the record, let's put it thus: this floppy & sad \"let's gets shit-faced and gimpy-ly prance around while making a mockery of heavy metal\" turn of events is best skipped over to make way for the B Side and its slightly improved opener \"You Don't Have To Be Old To Be Wise\". Other than a wicked mantra to live by (and snap back at your homeroom teacher), it offers up a slice of Hell Bent For Leather like cheer along similar lines as \"Rock Forever\" and \"Take On The World\". While definitely not JP's strongest moments - more like C class anthems -, they're still a far cry from the insipid and forgettable \"Living After Midnight\". From a flat drum machine sounding intro to a grossly bland and generic guitar riff by way of Halford's elementary and oh-so cheesy sing-along chorus, this one's best left for the elevator. Even the solo fails to save this one from utter disgrace. \n\nThankfully, closers \"The Rage\" and \"Steeler\" push British Steele into passable territory. On the former, Hill provides a jaunty, pseudo digital bass intro soon upheld by his tougher return to form, including meaner or less disoriented Halford taking back control of his domain, while the latter makes a valiant effort to reach Stained Class-like glory as it readily picks up the pace and earns itself a spot among British Steels unimpressively small compliment of highlights alongside \"Rapid Fire\" and \"Grinder\". As well, leads wise, Tipton and Downing redeem themselves in spades without encroaching on what could be Hill's strongest showing on this release anyhow. Dave Holland is no Les Binks of course but comes out on top, hopefully erasing his unforgivable lapses on the (much) weaker tracks. Now, although \"Breaking The Law\" somehow made it as one of \"Guitar World\"'s top 50 heavy metal riffs of all time (in all fairness, this was a mid 90s issue before heavy metal's global - and glorious - reincarnation), I find the novelty quickly wears off despite its inherent catchiness. Although it's \"razor\" sharp edge was quite imposing back in the day, it still pales in comparison to JP's stronger showings. \n\nIt always frustrates me when I meet talented musicians fortunate enough to possess perfect pitch and an uncanny ability to figure riffs, even solos, out by ear yet choose to stick with a legend's commercial fare as opposed to the classics. I say this because I know a very skilled guitarist who (cringe) is just obsessed with outright stinkers such as \"United\" and \"Living After Midnight\" (please God, don't put these in my head!) and plays them to the point of me wanting to jump out of the window of his sixth floor apartment. It baffles me how he frowns his nose at JP (and ZZ Top for that matter)'s more extraneous and exciting fare whilst rehashing the same crap over and over. All I can do I is defend the faith to the best of my abilities...\n",
        "\nJudas Priest's reverential Stained Class - hot diggity, what a classic! Everything about this titanic release exudes professionalism and class. From a vociferous, free-wheeling opener in \"Exciter\" right up to posthumously introspective closer \"Heroes End\" (\"Why do you have to die to be a hero?\"), Stained Class is everything a rabid metal head can ask for: tightly jocose drumming, razor sharp riffs and extraordinary solos, confidently enhanced bass playing and not least, stratospheric high-pitched operatic vocals on behalf of one of music's most esteemed front men, the great Rob Halford, a heavy metal legend in his own right. \n\nWithout missing a beat, Halford and Co. clutch it up with \"Exciter\", largely heralded as THE precursor to modern day \"speed\" metal. A rat-a-tat-tat style drum intro gives way to a super \"ahead of its time\" shuffle/jangle riff the cause of many a busted lawn chairs. Comprised of multiple bridge and solo sections, \"Exciter\" easily ranks high on my list of JP classics - in fact, each and every song on Stained Class tops the chart. (Even the somewhat hokey Spooky Tooth cover, \"Better By You, Better Than Me\" earns select status.) The way K.K. Downing and Glenn Tipton blazingly let 'er rip lead wise after Halford's vigorously passionate \"Fall to your knees and repent if you please\" makes me want to pump my fist and throw devil horns, clich\u00e9s be damned! Not once, but twice does this furious onslaught of epic guitar soloing occur, first at 01:19, then again at 03:26, after which a somewhat carnival-esque harmony bridges the gap before Halford returns in full force - epic with a capital \"E\": \"Stand by for Exciter!\" (X4). Now I know why this track gives me a strong urge to play Nintendo's Excite Bike...Hands down, Tipton and Downing are at the top of their game on Stained Class, easily making it the masters' #1 offering among many. (I once saw a young girl jaw-droppingly cover \"Exciter\", proving that with enough dedication and practice gals can rock just as hard than their male counterparts). \n\nNext up is the sassy-as-fuck \"White Heat, Red Hot\", likely my favourite \"swing boogie\" track among Stained Class' vaunted discography. The first time I heard it I literally trembled with awe, it's so grippingly good. I love the loose high-wire feeling the main riff instills, as it really does evoke a blinding, searing red hot flash of white lightning behind the eyes. \"Feel good\" chutzpah aside, I especially dig the opening verse:\n\n\"The father's son, thy kingdom come, electric ecstasy,\nDeliver us from all the fuss and give us sanctuary.\nLead us all into arena, magnificent in death.\nWell let us serenade the sinner, we'll follow in his step.\"\n\nAs for the solo, it's got an endearing, highfalutin twang which never gets old, although it's funny how I always confuse the track name by mixing the words up (i.e. \"Red Heat, White Hot\"). The end result is the same as it's also one of my all-time favourite Judas Priest tracks (along with \"Tyrant\", \"Starbreaker\" and \"Thunder Road\", to name a few). \n\nOverall Stained Class' level of production is fantastic, along with Tipton and Downing's super crisp and clear guitar tones, be it rhythm or lead. As well, bassist Ian Hill creeps out of his shell much more than elsewhere, notably on the Spooky Tooth cover - which alternates between coy pontifications and sheer bad-ass-ery i.e. the breakdown bass/guitar a minute or so in. Compared to the original, JP's take on \"Better By You, Better Than Me\" takes the comical hard rocker to the level of a bona fide goomba stomp/ heady heavy metal pseudo-anthem (!). Drummer Les Binks doesn't overplay his hand as he provides the perfect counterpoint to his bandmates' articulate musical exonerations. To wit, he solidly plows ahead with his head down on the oh-so-rad title track, which bleeds a fun and genial flow enhanced by team Tipton/Downing's steadfast triplets and poised power-chordage. The opening few bars/ guitar riff (and slick, catapulting opening lead) are nominally compelling, setting this one off with the forceful grace of an eagle. The leads here spiral up down and around, at one point even uncannily evoking a hard tooting goose honk (see 03:38!) sure to knock some feathers off your tree before cruising ever higher, followed by a face-planting return to form, tight triplet riffing and all. Great stuff! \"Invader\" is a sure-fire winner and fan favourite as well, also distinguishing itself as a speed metal precursor for which many aspiring - and eventually successful - heavy metal bands are grateful for. Commencing with a classic JP sci-fi-ish warp drive effect/ electronic embellishment (i.e moog, mellotron, keyboard, whichever!), \"Invader\" is right up there with - let me get it right - \"White Heat, Red Hot\" as far as top highlights go. Binks and Hill gift wrap this winner up for Halford's commanding presence and Tipton/ Downing's crescendo of hot-to-trot riff-age, which makes me want to rock out \"all nite and every day\". Dig the opening verse and chorus:\n\n\"I came across a smoking field, pulsating afterglow.\nI saw a seering flash of light erupt and skyward go.\nI staggered back in dazed surprise, what was it I had seen?\nAs I stood there mesmerized I heard my spirit scream.\n\nInvader, invader nearby.\nInvader, invader is nigh\u2026\"\n\nLead wise, there's some real gems here, be they congenial little fills or absolute zingers like the one zipping by at breakneck speed between 02:45 and 02:53; it's hallucinatory to say the least. Be sure to perk your ears up for this one as it's quite mind-blowing. Backtracking a bit before the incepting lead breaks, I found Halford to sound distinctly Ozzy like when he alters his pitch at : \"When they come to take control every man must play his role./ They won't take our world away when the children we leave will have to believe in today.\" \n\nStrewth! I haven't even covered the (technically speaking) B-Side. Having gotten this far I may as well see things out to the end. Now, It's no surprise a JP cover band by the name of \"Saints In Hell\" has been caroming around Vancouver (B.C.) for some time as the eponymous track, while perhaps a slightly less imposing number, still does a fine job of establishing the faith. After getting off to a fairly humdrum start, it shakes off any misgivings with some of Stained Class' snarky-est instrumentation, including a plump little drum solo and incremental bridge soon giving way to a whirlwind of space faring/ \"Starbreaker\" style single string palm muted riffing and a subtly cranky sounding Halford waxing ever so on the subject matter at hand. \"Savage\" is no slouch either, ensconcing itself nicely between \"Saints In Hell\" and Judas Priest's grandiose tour-de-force, the widely acclaimed elegiac eulogy cum mountainous dirge of Halford's most compelling crooning, extensively beautiful prose and overall vocal meanderings. \"Beyond The Realms Of Death\" rocks harder than its opening clear guitar progression implies so stick around for its entirety in order to take in a complete and unabridged Stained Class experience. Its soulful lead sections are highly commendable and a must for any aspiring lead guitar hero - mark my words!\n\nLast but least is \"Heroes End\", one of my preferred tracks along with \"Exciter\", (urf!) \"White Heat, Red Hot\" and \"Invader\" as it sounds like a forgotten cut from JP's masterpiece of a debut, \"Sad Wings Of Destiny\". I'm not going to say this outright but the sinister sounding guitar riff at the beginning and throughout sort of reminds me of a legendary doom metal band I'm (as you all know) very fond of whose moniker starts with the letter \"P\"\u2026either way, \"Heroes End\" is a strong number with a gripping chorus and super wonky solo to boot - all in all ending an already high quality release on an equally high note. \n\nChildren of the upcoming heavy metal generation, consider listening to Judas Priest's Stained Class from 1978 your homework. \n\nClass dismissed!\n",
        "\nSide B to be precise.\n\nI know I'm in the minority on this, but I think this album turned out better than Sad Wings of Destiny did. A year or so of touring and rehearsing allowed the band to temper their British steel a bit further. Just in time for a record deal with CBS and a production job from Deep Purple's own Roger Glover! The tones and execution have slightly more punch to them...but not quite enough (Raw Deal with Stained Class or British Steel's production would have been a Joker pencil-through-the-eye slammer).\n\nBefore we go any further, we need to talk about the entity that is not only this album's secret weapon, but the key component in the development of thrash and speed metal drumming: Simon Phillips. I love Les Binks, I truly do, but it is Phillips Keith Moon-meets Billy Cobham assault alone that made the ears of Slayer, Metallica, Helloween (possibly even Motorhead) and other delinquents perk up and declare \"good lord is he doing a double time bass lick under that [Let Us Prey] rhythm? At that speed?!\" He has much more tricks up his sleeves than that, kids. Dissident Aggressor is legendary for many reasons: the most insane Rob Halford vocal performance up to that point, KK's equally insane guitar solo, but its Phillips' fills and attack that pushes this into the \"practically thrash before thrash\" innovation category. When Slayer covered this song, some minute liberties were taken here and there for obvious reasons, but Lombardo copied Phillips' performance to a tee, as he should have.\n\nThree songs from here would make Unleashed In The East, and their performances here would hold up slightly better than the Sad Wings of Destiny studio tracks. Sinner being the best one, the one I can listen to both studio and live. KK Downing's little jam in the middle being what truly brings the titular creature/character to life. Diamonds & Rust is merely acceptable here, which is more than I can say for Starbreaker. I was expecting a brilliant fade-in of that glorious extra-terrestrial feedback and I get....Living After Midnight's opening? And are those handclaps? The fuck is going on here? Did I slip through a crack in time to the British Steel sessions where the band is telling Tom Allom those ideas of his are way too pop? Here I was hoping to find a version of this song without that minute long drum solo!\n\nThere are two ballads to be found here, Last Rose of Summer and Here Come The Tears. I used to love the former, and I might still love it if that \"repeat til fadeout\" of the title wasn't half the fucking track length. If you're gonna repeat a phrase ad naseum, at least make it sound sensical. Here Come The Tears might seem a little more of that at first, with its slightly wimpy title, but then around 1:58 comes the musical equivalent of Jack Nicholson whacking that black guy in the chest with an axe in The Shining. Perhaps this is where where Nightwish got the idea for Deep Silent Complete. Despite going from 0-100 real quick, it's a very natural heavy buildup, with a compelling sense of melody. It's a shame this one kind of fell through the cracks and was never played live. Hell the Turbo tour would have been a great spot for it!\n\nIt's also a goddamn shame Jack Bruce stole Simon Phillips for his go-nowhere solo career. I have great respect for Les Binks, but just imagine how much further Phillips could have innovated metal and pushed Priest forward just by playing like he always did. Not to mention the possibility that if its true Binks couldn't really cut it live, we could have had Phillips' sensibilities for British Steel and the 80s years! True, we would have lost Beyond The Realms of Death to beyond the realms of death, but Priest already had two solid ballads under their belt at this point, and lets not bullshit each other, the lack thereof would have saved them millions of dollars and bad publicity in lawsuits....but then they might not have had the fire lit under their asses to make Painkiller....ARGH, INNER TURMOIL!\n\nSin After Sin is essential if you are a drummer, but is more mid tier in terms of Priest albums to buy. Still very much rough around the edges, but when you drop the needle on Call For The Priest your furniture is in for one hell of a walloping.\n",
        "\nAfter releasing the finest metal album of all times with his comrades, Rob Halford decided that the old school held no more fascination for him, and decided to check the new possibilities that were opening with the influx of the groovy/grungy/alternative trends. His departure left a huge gap in the Judas line-up; one that took the remaining members quite some time before they managed to fill it in. Quite a few names were tossed around, some of them fairly prominent, but the guys voted to settle for the complete unknown at the time Tim Owens. For the more initiated the man wasn\u2019t a total obscurity as he had taken part in Winters Bane, a fairly cool US power metal outfit, and earlier in the excellent thrash metal formation Brainicide, a forgotten gem from the late-80\u2019s, of whom very few fans out there were, and still are, aware. \n\nBeing a most devoted fan to Judas and the Metal God, Owens had his dream come true when he was summoned under the British legends\u2019 banner. This only meant one thing: the veterans were planning to produce a follow-up to \u201cPainkiller\u201d, the metal album to end all metal albums\u2026 not the most enviable task in the world at the time which ironically coincided with the emergence of Halford\u2019s new project after the Fight demise, the industrial nonsense Two. The Metal God had already stained his reputation beyond repair\u2026 it seemed as though his former colleagues were preparing to head in the same direction\u2026 a follow-up to \u201cPainkiller\u201d, are you crazy!? \n\nAnd not only, but the band\u2019s intentions were only too clear from the very album-title; from \u201cPainkiller\u201d to \u201cJugulator\u201d, the road least travelled I guess. And a journey most risky for sure which starts with the title-track its creepy steam-rolling beginning only boding well with Owens\u2019 hellish screams nicely adding up to the drama that turns out a fairly pleasing modern power/thrasher with lashing steel guitars the overall delivery not that far from \u201cPainkiller\u201d, truth be told. Tipton and Downing seem in very good form exchanging hard biting guitar duels the whole time, the boosted modern production suiting them only too well. A surprisingly good start, and things only get better from here, first with \u201cBlood Stained\u201d, a pounding proto-thrashing modernizer; and then with \u201cDead Meat\u201d which is an intense speed/thrashing shredder Owens\u2019 outstanding vocals pouring more pathos into the \u201cfurnace\u201d. More \u201cdead\u201d, or rather \u201cdeath\u201d, stuff with \u201cDeath Row\u201d which has a misleading balladic inauguration the latter cancelled by seismic stomping guitars that remain for most of the time, guiding this relatively linear mid-pacer without many ups and downs.\n\n\u201cDecapitate\u201d is the doomy respite, a volcanic heavy number with oppressing, dark atmosphere, and \u201cBurn in Hell\u201d is a brooding mid-tempo piece with an overlong quasi-balladic overture. \u201cBrain Dead\u201d notches up the heaviness again although the several more aggressive digressions threaten to turn it into a headbanging melee at some point. \u201cAbductors\u201d has none of the kind, though, and its doom-laden aesthetics are seldom violated enhanced by a few atmospheric balladisms. \u201cBullet Train\u201d has to be fast in order to justify its title, and the fans won\u2019t be disappointed as this is a more dynamic composition, a power/thrash hybrid with great piercing leads and an urgent, jumpy rhythm-section. \u201cCathedral Spires\u201d is an ambitious 9.5-mn saga, something the guys haven\u2019t attempted since their very early days (remember \u201cVictim of Changes\u201d and \u201cBeyond the Realms of Death\u201d). The balladic beginning works fine with Owens suitably emotional and subdued, but the real show stealer are the faster-paced crescendos which elevate this closer to the highlight status, not without the help of the superb memorable chorus and the nearly operatic doomy finale.\n \nIt sounded like a mission accomplished to these ears as this \u201cJugulator\u201d was by no means a flop, and could even be considered a small victory against Halford\u2019s controversial stylistic metamorphoses. At the same time, it didn\u2019t sound radically different from Fight\u2019s \u201cWar of Words\u201d which could make one doubtful regarding the reasons about Halford\u2019s departure from the band since some media pointed at \u201cstylistic differences\u201d between him and his colleagues. There isn\u2019t a very big difference in the execution of the two efforts although the preferences may go towards the juggernaut.. sorry, jugulator here due to the still preserved echoes of the classic period. Owens does a very good job almost filling the Metal God\u2019s very big shoes securing him at least one more showing with his idols. \n\nDespite being a huge fan of the band, I can\u2019t act hypocritical and pretend that Judas\u2019 ride has been the smoothest on the field. In fact, their career has had the most fluctuating trajectory among the Big Five, and compared to the discographies, till the early-90\u2019s at least, of the band\u2019s main rivals Scorpions, Iron Maiden, Accept and Black Sabbath theirs has been by far the least consistent one comprising inordinate highs (\u201cDefenders of the Faith\u201d, \u201cPainkiller\u201d) and deplorable lows (\u201cPoint of Entry\u201d, \u201cRam It Down\u201d). In this train of thought the album reviewed here tends to gravitate towards the highs as it saw the veterans sounding totally relevant to the ruling fashions, and more than well equipped to race with the new stars on the field every bit of the way. \n\nWith the heavy burden taken off their shoulders, the guys were granted the permission to branch out into the unexpected, and \u201cDemolition\u201d appeared as a result. An album that tried to embrace as many numetal gimmicks as possible, it fell flat on its face prompting the Judas team to reconsider their partnership with Owens, and to let him go eventually. A timely decision that nearly coincided with Halford\u2019s intentions on checking on his former partners, and see whether they were entertaining the thought of a possible reunion. Yes, they were, amazingly, and a few years after Iron Maiden Judas Priest were also back again in full \u201cmetal jacket\u201d, being alive and well at present, with three more albums behind their backs. Any ideas or reviving either The Painkiller of The Jugulator? Better not; \u201cmonsters\u201d of such earthshaking proportions should be better left hibernating\u2026 for good.\n",
        "\nIf the predecessor was evident with the intentions that the band had of writing up more accessible stuff, this album emphasizes those intentions. The people did not praise this release due to its set of songs, but rather since the same achieved the goal of reaching the masses and satisfying their whims. Other than that, there is no real merit in this album. The songs here tend to be short, they lacked heaviness, and even worse, they kept the mixing style from the previous release, which was too inefficient. Unfortunately, the band neglected to include the powerful jazzy drumming as in their early albums, the guitar playing is too simplistic, like if Tipton and Downing had their hands tied; and although Halford's vocals are still powerful, they are not enough when the overall package does not seem to stick well. \n\nWith the only exceptions of the speed metal number \"Rapid Fire\" and \"Metal Gods\", the album is what they had done when you thought that there weren't any chances to make something more simple than Hell Bent. For instance, \"United\" is pretty much a repetition of \"Take on the World\", featuring the same damn cheesy choruses and a somehow similar dull pace. And no, no single release in their discography featured an enhanced version of the song. In that case, Accept would be a better reference on how to write songs of this kind. The same applies to other catchy glam-inspired songs like \"Living After Midnight\" and \"You Don't Have To Be Old To Be Wise\". Both songs would be expected from a band like Kiss, as they run at the same pace as the songs of this band do.\n\n\"Breaking the Law\" is a clear example of why metal was not made for those who are not metalheads. Mainly, since back then, many non-metalheads in radio stations picked up the wrong songs and hailed them as metal anthems when they were just catchy songs. Thus, all these fallacies killed not only the creativity of Judas Priest but the entire genre. This so-called \"anthem\" fulfilled the whims of the masses and took the posers into the stage, as well as being the relief for those who had been left traumatized due to the complex musical foundation of the heavy metal written at that point. Although its guitar work is acceptable and somewhere around acceptable compositions like \"Running Wild\", this so-called metal anthem is too short and even incomplete. The band could have added some guitar work (starting with a better solo) and drumming so that this becomes a more competent number.\n\nThe next track is a much more powerful speed metal number. \"Rapid Fire\" comes up with the famous fast-paced intro riff that would be ripped-off by many flower metal bands to be able to make the fools think that their music is metal/powerful speed metal. Leaving that aside, the intense Holland's drumming and the excellent riffs introduced therein make the song quite memorable, and also an influence for many thrash metal bands around the globe. That said, this album is unfairly overrated, and also the bridge between metal music and the audiences that should have never been built. Regardless of its improved production work, the album is too meaningless, and it lacks good ideas. If what you want is a release with more structured numbers, then it would be better to listen to Accept's '80s stuff, which is full of compositions that sound like enhanced versions of the songs included on this album and also because they know how to write metal anthems correctly.\n",
        "\nReleased in 1978 under the name of \"Killing Machine\" for the European market, Hell Bent marked the beginning of a new era for the band. It said goodbye to what became a well-established sound, as well as to the spectacular and complex music that influenced much of the metal that would start its road a few years later. Instead, the band released an album that resulted much more simple and with less musical merits than any other previous release. The British metallers relied on a mainstream-oriented musical foundation that gradually drove away many of the most loyal fanatics of the band while reaching another type of listeners who found this sound catchy and innovative.\n\nUnfortunately, in an aim of achieving popularity, the band traded almost all their unique heaviness and ambitious songwriting work for a more basic and straightforward sound that in general terms resulted disappointing, and their memorable moments are not as much as in their previous releases. That is, the band stopped being the dark outrageous juggernaut that ruled the metal scene in the past and turned into a commercial act that was just following the trends that the stadium rock bands established back then. Furthermore, the mixing work somehow affected the heaviness of the songs since instruments like the drums sounded softer and even synthesized, and the drumming work done by Dave Holland was far from the impressive one featured on previous albums. And although the guitar playing here is still effective, it is not engaging nor attractive, mostly due to the short length of the songs that did not allow more room for insane solos and extended guitar riffs.\n\nThe remarkable moments on the album include the opening track which is somehow similar to \"Invaders\" from the previous album, the title-track which is the heaviest and fastest song here, and \"Running Wild\" and its riffs that are an exception to the above regardless of the short duration of the same. The British metallers provided the numbers with good average riffs and impressive paces, and the latter is the obvious live hit from the band. Of course, and they will improve its sound in the live album released in the same year, which is wilder and even faster. On the other hand, the ballads are boring, and they are not as good as \"Beyond the Realms of Death\". However, the ballads outweighed its limits when they had the great idea when they composed their version of \"We Will Rock You\", that is, \"Take on the World\". In general terms, the number is dull, and the most worrying part is the fact of this being a cheering up number. Even William Wallace would fall asleep on his horse after listening to the song.\n\nIn summarized accounts, the album not only represented a relevant step-down from its predecessor but the beginning of a slow and torturing creative death that the band would suffer at the moment they decided to make all those changes in their sound and imagery. Unfortunately, the band neglected to see the negative impact from a futurist perspective, since the productive business they created was working when all is said and done, but suddenly, it fell, and the loyal fanatics were even more disappointed. Nonetheless, the album is still good in a few ways, starting with the title, which fortunately, is not \"Point of Entry\" or \"Turbo\". Leaving that aside, the album is still worthy-listening due to few numbers, which provided some influence for the way forward.\n",
        "\nHeralded by a maniac drum intro and aggressive guitar riffs blatantly inspired by their classic \"Exciter\", the title song represented a sign of resurrection for the fanatics of the band who were sick of the musical direction they took during the last half of the '80s. Also for Rob Halford who was affected by the creative death that the successful project was gradually suffering. Leaving behind the mainstream trends followed by the band, the album features many exciting moments and a revitalized sound that was able to drive away the attention from the silly lyrics written for this release (e.g., the fact of singing about the creature depicted on the album's cover without any compelling epic story behind).\n\nThe album takes some cues from its predecessor and other previous releases, mixing them with certain ideas developed by many thrash and power metal bands like if the British metallers were basing their sound on the music they helped to create. Surprisingly, for the first time in a decade, the band released a consistent album that features a solid formula and an acceptable set of songs. And this formula is what took the respectability of the band back to life and contributed to many changes in the musical foundation of certain subgenres going forward.\n\nOnce again, the clearest example of this formula is the rampaging title track, which sounds like a thrashier version of \"Exciter\". Other songs written in a similar fashion include the frenetic \"Metal Meltdown\" and the accelerated number \"Leather Rebel\". All these share the solid guitar work done by Tipton and Downing, the thunderous hyperactive drumming of Scott Travis (formerly a member of Racer-X) and Rob Halford shrieking like if a demonic entity possessed him. Not dissimilar, is the memorable mid-paced song \"Between the Hammer and the Anvil\", a number that goes straight to the ears from the beginning to the end, especially during the addictive NWOBHM-inspired solo played in the middle of the same.\n\nAlthough \"A Touch of Evil\" seems to be the weakest number in the album (think about a version of \"Pain and Pleasure\" fitting the album's atmosphere and musical foundation), it is still far from being filling stuff. Not having filler material is what results unbelievable about a band that during a decade followed musical/creative trends from glam and other similar stuff. Unfortunately, three years after the release of this album Rob Halford would leave the band, while another debacle was seeming to come up (the successor would be a copy of this album). Afterward, things would not be the same creatively, and even musically, so the remedy was to keep on being a good live performing band.\n",
        "\nIf it isn't obvious, this easily earns the title of my favorite live record of all-time, performed by my favorite band of all-time. While something that is nothing more than a compilation with tweaks to the playing and a live audience in the background may seem redundant to talk about, there's key things that go into a great live record. Bar none, this easily hits them all. Obviously the song selection is a big part of this. I own the original on vinyl, but what's special about this CD version is that it includes three more tracks from Killing Machine and one from Sin After Sin. Given the year, it's strictly tracks from the '70s, when they were fairly stripped down and straightforward, no gimmicks. Not that I have any issue with later Judas Priest records, but those songs were never performed as well as the early cuts when it came to hitting the stage. So with it being straight to the point, true to a sound, and of course playing some of the greatest tracks from the earliest albums, it's easily a good sign. (If only they included \"Dissident Aggressor\" as well....).\n\nThe tracks selection somewhat gives way to the next key thing, performing them in the most entertaining way. Sounds dumb, but some bands butcher their own songs. Embellishment (though seldom on this record) is always a plus, which adds some energy and interaction to the mix, but here a lot of things are tweaked, rather embellished. Example, the way that Rob belts out the vocals of \"Tyrant\" in this is much more ferocious than on Sad Wings Of Destiny. They're sped up as well, and of course Tipton and Downing pick up the guitar intensity as well. Their cover of Fleetwood Mac's \"The Green Manalishi\" is performed even better on here because of the rawness, and the fact that there's more emotion into it than the studio one. Bottom line, small things can make a huge difference; even take the slight ten second intro that is tacked onto \"Diamonds And Rust\". Subtle, but I think it's a great touch. One last example that I can't fail to mention is that the buildup in \"Victim Of Changes\" is even more suspenseful, and the instrumentation and screams are even more impressive. Absolutely incredible performers.\n\nThough the selection and performance are the biggest selling points on a live record, sound quality can still have an effect. I never believed this to make a huge difference until I bought Alice Cooper's 1979 DVD show called A Strange Case Of Alice Cooper. Amazing musician and performer, and amazing setlist, but I flat out don't even like that one because of how awful the sound quality is. Thankfully, Unleashed In The East is far from doing anything like that. For an energetic performance filled with distortion and many screeches, it's crystal clear. Rumor has it that some of it was tampered with in a studio, but I'm not complaining.\n\nThe impact that this record withholds and the mass popularity makes it pretty obvious how great it is, but there's a lot of small details that make it what it is, and I truly could not ask for this to be any better. Granted, I'd have added a few tracks, but I'm reviewing what's here, not what isn't here. You've never lived until you've given this a spin.\n",
        "\nSad Wings of Destiny is daring and forward thinking in scope, but very sloppy and haphazard in execution. You can detect this right away with a glance of the title. What the fuck does \"Sad Wings of Destiny\" even mean? It sounds pretentious, confused, and damning of all, not threatening. At least titles like Sin After Sin, Killing Machine, Stained Class and even British Steel convey a clear, confident message of what weight tis bout to be mounted on the listener's shoulders. Even some of Black Sabbath's more ethereal album titles like Master of Reality and Technical Ecstasy have clear statements of intent (even if in cases like the latter it's false advertising). If you've heard Unleashed In The East before you've heard this, you are almost certainly going to be let down. Even if you haven't, everybody rants and raves on how great this album is and I have a very hard time believing their enthusiasm for it because of how piecemeal and amateurish it sounds. I consider the live version of Genocide from UTTE to be the greatest Priest track ever, but here? Laughably, insultingly dumb. It's Rocka Rolla part two, but this time with politics. As legendary as Judas Priest is, they did not have their shit together for the first few years of their existence. Even a classic like Stained Class, one can't help but wonder how much better it could have been if recorded by 1980 or even 1979 Judas Priest. Say what you will about 2112's inconsistencies, but Rush had their shit together way more than Priest did in 76. Quite a few \"lesser metal\" bands did. Now, one can argue that it's unfair to compare the songs in 76 to how they would be in the future, saying that they are something they weren't supposed to be at the time. I might be willing to accept that if fans and the band themselves didn't consistently anchor this album as where the band found its metal calling. Sad Wings of Destiny is frequently credit with germinating the seeds of power metal, thrash and NWOBHM, but when you actually go back and listen to these songs as they are here, they just don't have as much punch as they should. Perhaps also, fans of the You Got Another Thing Coming's and such will hear how the \"old stuff was so much better.\" \n\nLet's get this out of the way right now, Sad Wings of Destiny starts with Prelude. I don't want to hear shit about how Victim of Changes is their most famous song and generally legendary songs are the first track on albums. It makes absolutely no sense for this album to start with Victim of Changes. Not to mention about 3/4 of that legendary harmonic intro is completely cut out because of that stupid fade-in. You should never do a fade-in on a guitar harmony, especially a long complex one. Fade-ins only work if the musical passage in question is simple, repetitive and possibly creeping. High On Fire's Eyes & Teeth is a great example of this done right, and of course there is Eye Of the Beholder and Orion (although you could argue that those are good passages to fade-in on because they're dull). But Victim of Changes fails with this because you could turn the volume all the way up and you still won't catch the beginning of that harmony. If you want to hear this trademark properly, you need to hear it live. Speaking of live, whenever Priest plays Tyrant live, they never play Prelude as an intro track before (though they did, interestingly enough, use the Harley), and this is the band that does that exact practice with The Hellion/Electric Eye, to the point where they just have to make them two separate tracks even though everyone knows one follows the other. Prelude is meant to start Sad Wings of Destiny, and Deceiver is meant to conclude it.\n\nSpeaking of Deceiver, while I think everyone will agree that this and the previous track Dreamer Deceiver make one song, I don't think everyone realizes that the full track itself is altogether called Dreamer Deciever, not Dreamer Deceiver Deceiver. Deceiver? Deceiver. The first, slower part of the song is called Dreamer (it does have that dreamy quality to it, wokka wokka), and the uptempo part of the song is supposed to be called Deceiver. It just ended up that way on the vinyl artwork for the same reason there is even confusion about the album sides in the first place: Gull Records were an underfunded, exploitative hack record company that had no big connections and no idea what they were doing. We all can agree that Judas Priest jumping to CBS was the right choice. Nevertheless, what a fucking wallop of a song, a wallop of a performance from Rob Halford (he goes super high AND low), and an amazing way to close the album. The clean guitar noodling is a much more haunting and effective conclusion than Island of Domination's fadeout echo. Which also isn't bad either, but come on now.\n\nOf the four songs that are on Unleashed In The East, two of them are listenable here. Those two are Tyrant and The Ripper. I actually think most might confuse Tyrant for classic rock because its execution just doesn't quite have that proto-thrash punch that it would a couple of years later. Part of the problem is Alan Moore's limp-wristed execution of the song. He plays these tracks like he's in REO Speedwagon. Amusingly, he also felt the need for a crash cymbal hit on every beat of Dreamer. Never thought I'd say this, but I think Dave Holland could have done a better job (he plays Tyrant relatively well on the British Steel/Point of Entry bootlegs). In addition, the way Tyrant is sung low in the chorus just makes it seem less frantic and chaotic, and here that hurts more than it helps. The Ripper is played at a slower tempo than we're used to on Unleashed In The East, but that performance seems to be more of an anomaly as future versions (like the one on the Live Vengeance 82 video) are played at this track's speed. I must admit playing it slower does give it room to breathe a little more, but when you're being chased by Jack the Ripper, you shouldn't have room to breathe.\n\nSome might claim Island of Domination is a great track because of nothing else to compare it to, I'm afraid I have to disagree, at least with regards to the opening. The way this opening riff is intended to be interpreted is akin to the intro of Belly of the Beast, a vicious triplet based thrasher. Unfortunately, because Glenn and KK hadn't quite figured out how metal works yet, the riffing in the intro seems a bit too subdued for the songs good. I will say that the breakdown and Halford's vocals are top of the class. It has a really deadly, but sassy swing to it, like it's being sung by one of those piano vixens in a tight dress (similar to Hand of Doom). That's probably the best take away from this album. It's probably the greatest pure, non-screechy vocal performance the man has ever given. If you're buying albums solely based on vocal performances, it's highly recommended in that regard.\n\nThere's no denying the potential in the songs of Sad Wings of Destiny. Again, Unleashed In the East is proof of that. But Unleashed in The East was three albums and three years of Judas Priest rehearsing and honing their sound. I apologize for the repeated comparisons, but it frustrates me when this album as the acclaim that it does when it sounds like it doesn't gel. I suppose it's a compliment of progress when your mid and later periods make the early periods sound feeble and weak, but not if the songs show more promise than say, Living After Midnight and Breaking The Law. \n\nI would recommend Sad Wings of Destiny only for hardcore Priest fans looking to complete their collection. It is a fun historical document I spin from time to time, but nothing I use for fucking on the floor and/or breaking things. You should get it before Point of Entry, Demolition and Turbo, but not before Stained Class, Painkiller, Screaming For Vengeance, or even British Steel and Ram It Down. And Unleashed In the East of course, but you knew that already.\n",
        "\nAfter a quite notorious turnaround from the energetic and aggressive sound in \"Sad Wings\" to the progressive direction taken for the next release, the band decided to move their musical direction towards a more accessible sound for the different audiences (especially in the U.S.) they tried to reach. As such, they were not interested in listening to quite complex and lengthy songs (regardless of their brilliance), while making their music more radio-friendly. And along with all the complexity of their compositions, they gradually said goodbye to all their hippie imagery and all those musical influences from Zeppelin.\n\nNotwithstanding all these changes, the band did not sell their souls as much as Sabbath was doing at that time when they played low-quality AOR. Rather, they kept the heaviness that characterized them since the beginning and simply as innovative as in their previous releases. Said innovation was blatant from the start with the influential speed metal opener \"Exciter\". The intense drumming and the guitar riffs featured in the song were something new for this music, and even more innovation resulted in the melodic neoclassical notes played during the solo. Furthermore, the song seems to be the answer for those who wonder the blueprint on which \"Painkiller\" had been building.\n\nAfterward, the album runs in a slower fashion, but there are still many outstanding numbers that somehow keep the intensity of this track. \"White Heat, Red Hot\" is a perfect example. Although a little bit slower than the previous song, it is still running in a fast fashion, and during its chorus, Halford seems to sing \"Am I Evil?\" rather than the chorus of the song. Clearly, this comparison explains pretty much how the song influenced many bands, starting with Diamond Head and its well-known hit, as well as many other thrash bands around. \"Savage\" and \"Saints in Hell\", a couple of underrated numbers also provided several ideas for the way forward. Both songs have interesting riffs that surrounded the thrash metal vibe and are references on how the band would develop their sound going forward.\n\nAnother remarkable change is the fact that the band returned to their old songwriting techniques for their ballad \"Beyond the Realms of Death,\" which is however much more aggressive than any other in their catalog. Jumping from soft lines to the mid-paced choruses and bridges, it seems to highlight the guitar playing of Tipton and Downing, as well as, the Halford's powerful vocals. On the other hand, some of the songs above appear at their best in \"Unleashed in the East\" due to the energy injected by the audience and the band members themselves, which is completely different to the dark atmosphere featured in this album. That said, this album represented the end of an era since afterward, the band would not be the same, and their way forward would have some memorable moments and other forgettable works (sadly, the most).\n",
        "\nI don't know, maybe I'm the only one that hears this. But the first time I heard Burnin Up, I heard Issac Hayes; specifically South Park's Chef era Issac Hayes. \"We've got to make love, the time is right.\" I always wanted to make one of those South Park animation style videos where the kids come up to Chef and complain about their usual problems, and then Chef goes \"Aw children, let me sing you a little song, it might clear things up.... 'You stitch me up good and you cut me down.'\"\n\nI wouldn't even bring this up if that track was an anomaly of Hell Bent For Leather, but then the end of the album brings us Evil Fantasies, which sounds like an Arethra Franklin heavy metal makeover track if I've ever heard one. Especially with the way Halford sings the vocals. Has he ever made a pitch like that with his vocals since then? There were bits of this sass floating around Sad Wings, Sin After Sin and Stained Class, but it just explodes on this particular track. It gives him (and Priest by extension) a sense of that rootsy Memphis soul that you never hear in metal. \n\nA third example of this is none other than Killing Machine, which has a groove almost too ballsy and funky. Of course trying to claim that disco was having an influence on Priest, especially in 1979 would be the ultimate insulting accusation of selling out, so its best to claim that chemtrails of it had been slipped into the pounding metal foundries Priest claim influenced them so much. Special credit has to be given to Les Binks for this song as well as the other two examples. This idea that he wasn't able to cut it is ridiculous when he's able to lay down grooves like this (dear lord is this song where groove metal was born?).\n\nIn any case, despite being considered a part of the first era of Priest, Killing Machine/Hell Bent For Leather would be where Priest finally found their groove and every album they would make afterwords would be based off of. The album has more than enough of your Priest-style heavy metal to go around. Running Wild, Hell Bent For Leather, Delivering The Goods, Green Manilishi and Rock Forever are all killer riff based classics with the 'speed of the heavy kind.' Special mention has to go to Hell Bent For Leather for being 3 minutes of shredding brilliance courtesy on Glenn Tipton all by himself. It's remarkable that such a song becoming a statement for the band features no input from Rob at all even though there's also a subtle nod to Rob's sexuality. \n\nFun Fact: This was not the original Harley song. Tyrant was. Go listen to some bootlegs from the British Steel and Point of Entry tours. Hell Bent For Leather was played near the beginning of the set, but no Harley. The Harley would come out for the final song, which was usually Tyrant. Honestly its better that way, the metal Tyrant causing suffering from his motorcycle carries a lot more character than just a bike coming out during a song about a bike. But that's just my opinion, whatever that's worth.\n\nThe final notable song is Before The Dawn, which is a straight up acoustic number. It's not as good of a ballad as Beyond The Realms of Death or Dreamer Deceiver (what is), but it's a solid atmospheric tune that lulls you back down for the final funky assault of Evil Fantasies. I'm kind of annoyed this was never played live, especially since they would often play Diamonds & Rust as an acoustic number as it was originally concieved. It's like motherfucker, the reason your version of Diamonds & Rust was notable was because you made it heavy! If you want to bring the live vibe down, just use what you already have!\n\nIn conclusion, I'm not sure British Steel would have been as successful without this album (and Stained Class as well as Unleashed In the East) laying down the foundations. If the record company had put as much money into promoting this album as they had Priest's other 80s albums it might have been just as big if not bigger. It's not for nothing that this album still carries quite a few live staples. Essential Priest, and strangely underrated to boot.\n\n\nRecommended Tracks:\nHell Bent For Leather\nEvil Fantasies\nRunning Wild\n",
        "\n\"Rocka Rolla\" is the debut studio album by legendary heavy metal band Judas Priest. \"Rocka Rolla\" shows quite the different Priest compared to their more well known 80's works and even their other 70's albums to some extent. As with many early heavy metal acts, Judas Priest began with a blues-based form of heavy metal. While they would still have hints of this sound on the following few albums, this debut remains a pretty unique album in their discography.\n\nMany of the songs from this album were actually co-written by Al Atkins, who was Judas Priest's frontman and vocalist preceding Rob Halford. However, once he had a family to take care of, he left the band in May 1973. Al Atkins later made his versions of some early Judas Priest songs on his \"Victim of Changes\" solo album, which includes a longer version of 'Caviar and Meths' which was originally a 14-minute long song to be released on \"Rocka Rolla\" but sadly shortened down to only the 2-minute long intro as the final song featured on the album. It's a shame, because listening to the longer Al Atkins version, it sounds like it would have been a fantastic epic. The whole history of the album and the early years of Priest are actually quite fascinating, so if that sounds interesting I would highly recommend reading about it. Now that I've finished mentioning some of the history, on to the music.\n\nMost of the songs are blues-y hard rock/heavy metal tunes, with the heavier tracks resembling the likes of Black Sabbath. The opening two tracks, 'One for the Road' and the title track, are examples of the blues-y hard rock sound, the latter in particular being a nice catchy tune. After the 'Winter' suite, one of my favorite songs 'Cheater' comes. There's a nice galloping drum beat, blues-y harmonica, and Halford's vocals are killer. There's also the epic 'Run of the Mill', which has some nice dark diminished chords reminiscent of Sabbath. However, it changes sound quite regularly, with beautiful slow guitar/bass work that reminds me of parts of Eloy epics. There is also some fantastic soloing shortly following, and in typical epic fashion it certainly has a climatic ending with some great screams from Halford. \n\nMy favorite on the album has to be 'Dying to Meet You', which opens up with a killer blues-y bassline before getting dark guitar work. Halford's vocals sound pretty different at the beginning, being much more lower-pitched then what he's known for. His low bluesy tone shown here sounds really nice, but he wouldn't really ever sing like this again. However, the song eventually picks up in speed with Halford's classic higher vocals and more great galloping guitar.\n\nOverall, while not my ultimate favorite Judas Priest album, it's still among my favorites and an amazing album especially for a debut. It's interesting to listen to this more blues-y form of the Priest, and I think it's essential listening to hear what this legendary band sounded in the beginning.\n\nAttribution: http://www.metalmusicarchives.com/review/rocka-rolla/296712\n",
        "\nWhen you grow up, there are certain things that are simply instilled into your being. Among those things are that you must always say please when you want something, hitting is always wrong, and British Steel is a classic metal album. Undisputably, Judas Priest had the image down before anyone else (Sabbath had a certain something with the crosses, but weren't really thinking about it very hard) and this album screams \"classic\" from the moment you lay eyes on the cover. The hand with the spiked wristband arrogantly brandishing a razorblade of all things, and not only a razorblade but one bearing the ultra-cool logo of the band and iconic album title as though they really were the maker's mark. That's what classic means. A glance through the song titles will tell the same story: 'Living After Midnight', 'Breaking the Law' - 'Metal Gods'. This is verse and chapter.\n\nYet, when you actually get the album out of its package and start listening to the music, the sounds of the Birmingham five-piece can't possibly match up to the status of such a classic. This is not merely a case of the legacy being so exaggerated either. This is a cut and dry example of a lacklustre album from a great band. There are many things about British Steel that don't meet the standard of a heavy metal album from 1980, regardless of the position that Priest had worked themselves into by that juncture. The songs are firstly lacking energy, with many bereft of passion and power as well. Just take a look at the lame stomp and hum of 'United'. In the first place, it's essentially a Queen song that anyone over the age of 8 could probably recognize ('We Will Rock You' gets unsubtly fisted by 'We Are the Champions'), while the instrumental ideas are effectively nil, being made up of that stolen \"handclap\" beat and a few stabs of power chord, even if the bassline does contribute a little of worth. The vocal as well, which should be soaring and emphatic, just kind of drones on: instead of making me want to stand in union with the band, I begin to feel as though I would much prefer to stand by myself if they insist on singing the chorus another time. On the other hand, some of the dull nature of the album can be put down to the production, which has suffered through more than 35 years of progress, yet still comes out less shining by comparison than the much sharper Iron Maiden, which is of the same age.\n\nThere are of course some songs that move ahead more vigorously than the likes of 'United', though it's distressing to see that they are only just in the majority, since 'Metal Gods' and 'Grinder' pale in the lukewarm sound, allowing the bop of the drums to dominate until Rob Halford asserts himself. One issue here is that the guitarists do not get precedence either in the mix or in the compositional hierarchy, undermining the claim that this is a classic metal album by virtue of the fact that there are fairly few standout riffs on offer. Many of the riffs fall closer to rock territory than metal, which should not alone be reason to complain, yet the rock riffs tend not to have the power or memorability of the more punchy nuggets on 'Breaking the Law' and 'Steeler'. The solos fare mildly better but still aren't cause for dusting off the old air guitar, because the slower pace of the steady rockers doesn't enhance the excitement of such pieces. Only making matters worse is the seeming reluctance of Dave Holland to control things with his drumming performance, allowing those mellower songs to lose their focus at times. Rob Halford can be counted on to raise the standard in most cases and thankfully the singer is in decent form here, adding something majestic to 'You Don't Have to Be Old to Be Wise' and supplying conviction to the faster numbers. However, there are still moments when 'Metal Gods' becomes humdrum - a problem that should be avoided for songs about robots with \"Laser beam hearts\".\n\nJudas Priest may have been in rather a conundrum at the time they were writing and recording British Steel. It seems that the more explorative phase of the mid-'70s was passing and a determination to write tighter, more focused songs led the band to strip back their sound. The leanness of some of the songs works well here, 'Steeler', 'Rapid Fire', and 'Breaking the Law' working the best on the seek-and-destroy route, although it paralyzes the mid-paced efforts, robbing them of their interest factor, which results in 'Living After Midnight' and 'Grinder' feeling like mediocre efforts despite some good sections. There is also the commercial factor to contend with, since some of the writing was most probably done with an eye on sales, which is where 'United' totally falls off the horse and 'Living After Midnight' starts to look pretty deliberate. For an ardent metal fan, it's disappointing to realize that such a highly-regarded album is not all it's cracked up to be, but such is the way of life. At least one can still claim that British Steel plays a part in the mythology of metal and sure as hell looks the part.\n",
        "\nImagine yourself in a concert taking place in Japan with one of the biggest names in the 70's metal scene on the stage, playing what is probably one of the most energetic and explosive performances ever seen in metal history. Is there any way to object that it is an experience that much us would like to live? Probably, the answer would be an absolute no. But then, what is special about this performance so that it became one of the most memorable releases of Judas Priest?\n\nDefinitely, the band picked up some of their best cuts and injected them with a dose of heaviness that would not be expected from a Zeppelin-inspired band like Judas. The songs from \"Sad Wings\", were the most benefited by the improvements done by the band, perhaps with the exception of \"Victim of Changes\" whose drumming lost some of the intensity that made the studio-version song sound quite special, though it is still a worthy-listening number. Out of said song, \"The Ripper\" and \"Genocide\" featured intro riffs that would characterize some of the songs written by many NWOBHM bands, whilst \"Tyrant\" sounds a little bit thrashier than the studio-version (somewhere around a mid-paced Metal Church song) and it became one of the most quoted influences for the creation of Slayer's sound.\n\nOther anthems like \"Exciter\" and \"Running Wild\" were empowered by the rough guitar playing displayed in the scenario by Tipton and Downing. Definitely, the former resulted somehow faster and more intense than the already speedish studio version. But the demonic guitar playing did not stop there. While many people who have listened to the studio version of the awesome proggy cut \"Sinner\" might think that there would not be something to be added to the song as it was played in the required pace and with exactly the riffs that best fit the album's atmosphere, the band was showing in that performance that they were able to play rougher versions of whatever song, even the innocent cover of the Joan Baez's hit \"Diamonds and Rust\". The band realized that it was just a matter of bringing up their roughest and heaviest riffs in the stage.\n\nDespite the polemic vocals done for this album by Rob Halford (due to an alleged re-recording of the same), the band delivered a level of musicianship that played down this issue among the fanatics of the band. Furthermore, said performance became a source of inspiration for the music that was written during the 80's and not just for the NWOBHM, but for many thrash and power metal bands, including those named as Exciter, Running Wild (at some point) and Sinner. With that in mind, there is just one conclussion: get this album or die.\n",
        "\nShifting your style to something more commercial and accessible isn't necessarily a bad thing. I mean, some bands should simply never go down that route, but for others, adopting an accessible sound and basic song structure can reveal some good qualities that weren't present before. It's a slippery slope, because going too far down that route can cause a band to forget about what originally made them great and alienate their core audience. However, when you remain tasteful with that marketability, you get a true classic. Case and point; Hell Bent for Leather. Yes, I'm calling it by its American name, you limey. If you disregard the censoring motives behind the title, then you have yourself what the Priest's mindset was. Balls-out, no fucks given, leading the pack on a movement that's about to emerge. Judas Priest were trail blazers with this release and have defined what 80's heavy metal was going to be.\n\nEven if you loved Judas Priest's earlier output and all of its prog-laden, acoustic guitars introducing incessant, sappy ballads, you have to understand that the band had to have changed. They probably would've suffocated from sniffing their own farts all the time. While I absolutely adore albums like Stained Class and Sin After Sin, I would've hated to have seen the band go further down the prog rock path. Especially since bands like Mot\u00f6rhead and Saxon were beginning to overtake them in the heaviness department. That's why it was a good idea to throw all of that pretentious songwriting and crank up the god damn distortion.\n\nSpeaking of which, my god that guitar tone is beautiful. What Stained Class suffered from was a squeaky clean guitar tone which downplayed the ferocity of otherwise amazing tracks like Exciter or Saints in Hell. The Priest actually incorporated heaviness into their sound to make this shit heavy metal. Songs like Hell Bent for Leather and Delivering the Goods are serviced with that all too important heavy riff. Those riffs really do make it to your head and do not let go. Another benefit from being more commercially viable as well as the lyricism. Gone are the days of quasi-intellectual lyrics quivered by Rob Halford's youthful tenor. Commence the age of badass themes like street racing, chicks, gang-related violence, bounty hunting...uh, S&M and lovers separated...well, that was more homoerotic then I remember. \n\nFor all of the excellence that this album produces, it does have its moments of outright awfulness. The power ballads really take their toll on this album. Don't get me wrong, Judas Priest have written some great power ballads. But for ever Beyond the Realms of Death and A Touch of Evil, you have your fair share of pure melodrama like Before the Dawn and Evening Star. God, those songs can suck a basketball throw a drinking straw, they're that bad. Not even Glenn Tipton and K.K. Downing's guitar chemistry can save them. And to think, that these power ballads would fester in their terribleness on every Judas Priest album for the next ten years. Another issue with this album is Rob Halford's vocals. Not in general, he still gives an astonishing performance. However, on tracks like Evil Fantasies, he turns into fucking cookie monster with his gruff vocals. I don't know why either. He's demonstrated that he's a developed a sandpaper-rough snarl on this album. It's like he was trying to deliver something vicious, but didn't want to scream the lyrics since that wouldn't match the guitars. So, he did the 70's version of a death growl, but my God, does he come off as goofy as hell. Admittedly, this vocal concern is a rather minor issue and doesn't bog down the quality of the album. \n\nOverall, I thoroughly recommend this album. It's a classic for a reason and it serves as a great example for how being more accessible can be a good thing. Rob Halford has greatly improved his vocals with his freshly developed snarl. Glenn Tipton pens some catchy as hell guitar riffs and chord progressions while also displaying his talent through his dual guitar solos with K.K. Downing. While the power ballads really do affect this album, the highlights soar far higher to even be affected by the shit. Songs like Hell Bent for Leather, Delivering the Goods, The Green Manalishi (With the Two-Pronged Crown),and Running Wild(I think Glenn Tipton needs to talk Adrian Smith about royalties for stealing that riff for The Wicker Man)are in no way ruined by being sided with Evil Fantasies or Evening Star. This album deserves all the praise it gets. Although, I can't really say the same for what's to come.\n\nBonus: The 2001 remastered, reissue version of this album features two bonus tracks. One, a live version of Riding on the Wind which I'll not be focusing on. The other, a balls to the wall anthem against those that may hinder you known as Fight for Your Life. Apparently, it was the original version of Rock Hard Ride Free and was written during the Screaming for Vengeance sessions. You can tell it was written during that era given Rob Halford's more emphasis on screams. Tonally, it fits well with the album even though it was written in a different era. I guess that's why they threw it on here. I'd recommend getting this version if you can. To be fair, it's a bit slim pickings when it comes to bonus content. However, the shear greatness of Fight For Your Life should serve as the only justification for buying it.\n",
        "\nTime can be a rather cruel mistress. Equipping oneself with the most elite technology and sound at the time may make you seem like the avant garde of the time, but 20 years down the road, only God himself will know whether or not your shit sounds dated and quaint. Which is not to say that I think this album sounds dated and quaint, I just understand why there are those that do.\n\nTo be honest, one of the problems with why this album sounds so stranded in time to the modern metal fan is because half of it was never touched live. Sure if a song sounds twice as fierce live it still makes the album version sound slightly inferior, but you make peace with that because you are aware of the raw power a song is capable of when unleashed in the right circumstances.\n\nI feel very privileged to have heard Exciter, White Heat Red Hot, Better By You Better Than Me, Stained Class, and Beyond The Realms of Death live. It provides me with the foresight to emotionally give back more energy to these songs that the songs themselves may even be capable of conveying simply because I know their true power. That\u2019s why albums such as Unleashed in The East are so important. It\u2019s simply not possible for bands who recorded the \u201cold way\u201d to give off their maximum potential, they\u2019re only playing to an engineer who 90% of the time could probably care less.\n\nThen there's the poor man's Simon Phillips, Les Binks. Ok, let's be fair, everybody except Neil fucking Peart is the poor man's Simon Phillips, and Les doesn't do a bad job of imitating him, but all the little fills and flourishes that made Sin After Sin's high points stratospheric just aren't here. Let's not act like Phillips couldn't have come with that double bass beat to Exciter. While Les Binks should deserve credit for innovating metal drumming, he isn't really doing anything that Simon didn't do on SAS. Speaking of Exciter, as much as I love Motorhead, they really need to stop getting THE credit for thrash drumming that Overkill gets considering Stained Class (and by extension, Exciter) predates Overkill by a full year. They deserve some credit sure, but Priest did it first. Deal with it you punk rock assholes.\n\nI also can't help but wonder if there should be a \"Tipton,\" a \"Downing,\" or even a \"Hill,\" next to the credits of Beyond The Realms of Death. Ok yea he wrote that intro lick which the meat of the song is based off of, but what about the thrash-esuqe bridge or double time ending under KK Downing solo at the song's conclusion? Maybe KK should get the credit since according to him it was his guitar Binks picked up and jammed with since \"Glenn would guard his with his life.\"* I'm not trying to retroactively demonize Binks or claim he was some kind of hack, just that he was a placeholder for Simon Phillips. He's better than Holland, I'm sure we can all agree with that notion, right? RIGHT?\n\nDespite how near 40 years of progress makes Stained Class seem like no more than a building block, the important thing to remember is the importance of that building block. There\u2019s a reason the guys from Slayer (well Kerry King) drop Priest\u2019s name left and right. It\u2019s the thrashy middle-eight of Saints In Hell; It\u2019s the impossibly high note at the end of Exciter; it\u2019s the double time double bass at the tail end of White Heat Red Hot; it\u2019s the doom-riff breakdown following the most violent, gory tirade Rob Halford had gone on up to this point in the title track (can you think of an earlier example that \u201chung drawn and quartered\u201d was used in a rock song?); it\u2019s the idea of wondering why good men die like dogs, but with sass, like in Hero\u2019s End. it\u2019s the matching of deep emotional lyricism by two distinct guitar solos shining for 16 bars wondering if knowledge is indeed worth the bitter cost. Stained Class is not only solely responsible for every sub-genre of metal, it\u2019s when heavy metal became heavy metal. Period.\n\n*(Metal Works liner notes)\n\nRecommended Songs:\nExciter\nBeyond The Realms of Death\n",
        "\nThe true birth of British Steel. \n\nThis is the album were metal as a style of music was really born. On earlier Priest albums, as well as those by Black Sabbath and other early innovators, there was as much distorted blues rock as actual metal, which was to be expected as the genre of metal was created. Here the blues was thrown to the side and only the gleaming metal was left, launching many styles and bands, and in a way laying down the bedrock of modern metal. \n\nRight off the bat you get one of the foundational tracks of speed metal, Exciter. Starting off with pounding Binks drums before launching into speed riffing, this tune is pretty much the basis for all the American metal legends of the 80\u2019s and the drive to be faster . Halford\u2019s wails fly over the top of this and destroy any idea that you are in for a record of bluesy rock with some crunch. No sir, this is heavy metal as the gods intended. A sonic distillation of steel, leather, and chrome. The title track is pure metal bliss. Opening with some excellent lead work over rolling drums, then settling down into an iconic heavy metal riff before Halford\u2019s vocal acrobatics begin. Add in an amazing chorus and you have a total gem of a track. Other standout tracks include the cover of Better by You, Better than Me which I love for the wonderful vocals of Halford and the punch of the drums Binks lays down. Listening to Halford sing this is nearly worth the price of the record alone. Beyond the Realms of Death is a guitar and vocal masterwork. Binks only writing credit on the record is a pure classic. He knew when to inject himself into he songwriting process I\u2019d say. Soaring emotional vocals lift the listeners up to Beyond the Realms of Death while the band plays probably the best ballad ever written. The solos...oh my the solos. Words can\u2019t describe the emotion of the playing. You need to check it out for yourself. Immediately. The rest of the tracks all are solid examples of what metal is and would be for all time. Sharp riffs, screaming leads, thumping bass, pounding drums, and Halford over the top. Deny this and as Halford says, Fall to your knees and repent if you please!\n\nMusically the band is on fire and inspired. Halford wails like only he could when he was young. He also shows off how amazing he sounds in the mid ranges on songs like Stained Class, and Invaders. Just perfectly executed. KK and Glen are...well KK and Glen. Tight leads, tight rhythms, and wonderful song structures. The guitarists of Priest have always been at the head of the pack when it comes to trading off leads and solos and this is one of the masterpieces that established them as the legends they are. Les Binks drums sound just amazing, a perfect crack that punches though the guitars like well recorded drums should. He tosses in double bass now and then for accent and his fills are top notch. I\u2019ve always thought he was the best Priest drummer but Scott Travis always gets the praise due to a lot of double bass. Well there is more to metal drumming than just that and he puts on a show here. I wish we could have heard the 80\u2019s records with a drummer of this caliber. Ian Hill is the member of the band who is usually ignored but he does a fine job here supporting the music with basslines that fill out the sound and give the tunes the necessary low end Nothing flashy, but perfect for the songs. \n\nThis is the true birth of Judas Priest, despite the amazing quality of earlier records, and really the true birth of the style heavy metal. Utterly mandatory.\n",
        "\n\"Ram It Down\" followed \"Defenders of the Faith\" and \"Turbo\". These albums had been completely different, but they had at least one thing in common. They evoked strong emotions, for better or for worse. By contrast, \"Ram It Down\" was the \"I don't care\"-album. The suicidal change of course between its two predecessors was not yet forgotten. Thus, the here presented album had a tough job right from the start.\n\nTipton and the other dudes had a bad conscience - and this with good reason. The lukewarm piss called \"Turbo\", euphemistically called \"experiment\", was still in their minds. Thus, the opening title track sent its thundering greetings right from the outset. It delivered pure metal, while the lyrics were completely irrelevant. One rather had to read between the lines. The composition was constantly screaming: dear metalheads, forgive us the release of \"Turbo\", we will never do it again. For those simpletons who still had not understood the strategy of reparation, the next song had the most primitive title a metal band can choose: \"Heavy Metal\". Yes, we understood that a formation, which had run into serious trouble, wanted to be headbanger's best friend again. Yet it is not a matter of minutes to regain lost trust. \n\nLeaving aside the question whether Judas Priest were still authentic or not, the opener tried to build a bridge to the fanatic \"Freewheel Burning\". Due to its velocity and sharpness, \"Ram It Down\" was fairly comparable with this classic, but it failed to reach its compositional excellence. Just compare, for example, the bridges of these two tracks. Here we have the toothless \"Shout it out, we're all together now\" trilling, there we are overrun by the determined \"Look before you leap has never been the way we keep\" vocals that sounded like a machine gun. Nevertheless, due to the metallic purity and some high-pitched screams of Halford, the song was much better than any softener of the \"experimental\" predecessor. (Please note my politically correct wording.) The aforementioned \"Heavy Metal\" also hit the mark. Driven by a bulldozing bass, the song lived up to its name. The lyrics were as stupid as those of \"Turbo\", but to be honest, the value of lyrics stands and falls with the quality of the composition itself. This might be a little bit irrational, but it was great fun to scream painfully primitive lines like \"All heads are banging\" or \"Fists pumping everywhere\". Although the song bordered on parody, it worked. Doubtlessly, the imperious screams \"Heavy metal, heavy metal, what do you want?\" had an impact.\n\nIt was no coincidence that these two songs kicked off the A side and it was also no coincidence that the sinister \"Blood Red Skies\" kicked off the B side. This large-sized number combined profound heaviness with an apocalyptic atmosphere, did not lack of epic elements and generated a majestic overall impression. \"Metal God\" Rob was in his element while delivering expressive vocals with some high-pitched or elongated screams. The performance of the other guys was also convincing, but Halford left his mark in the most impressive manner. \n\nThree strong songs marked a big improvement, but unfortunately, this was no EP and the further seven pieces were as ordinary as their titles. \"Come and Get It\", Halford sang \"I'm a Rocker\" while standing in the \"Love Zone\" and some unknown \"Monsters of Rock\" realized that they were \"Hard as Iron\". Excellent poetry. Anyway, mid-paced pieces passed by, sometimes a little bit sleazy, sometimes a little bit heavy, sometimes a little bit commercial. \"Come and Get It\" scored with a pretty sharp bridge, but self-declared \"Metal Gods\" must be able to deliver more suspenseful pieces. The howling guitars at the beginning of the closer were also promising, but the number did not turn out well. Its slow-moving chorus and the computerized beats left me cold. The same applied to \"Hard as Iron\" (enjoy its completely misplaced earthquake sample) and to \"Love You to Death\", because its guitar lines sounded like some of the worst compositions of Gene Simmons. Yet I am not talking about Kiss and I do not want to speak about the Chuck Berry cover as well. Just one remark, it is a ridiculous if a band praises itself for its regained heaviness while delivering this happily rocking piece. However, here is the quintessence of the review: the appropriately produced \"Ram It Down\", the last album with Dave Holland on drums, did not have a massive impact. I don't care.\n",
        "\nTo avoid misunderstandings, I have never drunken piss and I do not intend to do it. Nevertheless, I am sure that the headline is right. \"Defenders of the Faith\" was larger than life, gigantic and heavy. \"Turbo\" was painfully commercial, totally polished and gruesomely meaningless. One might think that the ridiculous cover says it all, but far from it! The sonic atrocities are much worse than the mechanized artwork.\n\nSynthesizers, everywhere synthesizers, already the quasi title track makes me sick. Like armies of vicious beetles, the synthetic sounds crawl out of the speakers in order to infest your mind, your skin and your ear canals. I hate to say it, but in order to stay fair I must admit that \"Turbo Lover\" spreads a certain atmosphere due to its proper construction. Judas Priest know how to utilize the computer comrades. Congratulation. Better still, to play with keyboards seems to be their new core competency. But generally speaking, I do not want to listen to music pieces which are based, firstly, on synthesizers, secondly, on synthesizers and, thirdly, well, guess you know what I want to say. This beginning sets the course for a trip into perdition. Well, it is the most sterile form of perdition you have ever seen. Anyway, it is terrible. Songs like \"Out in the Cold\" are cheesy, harmless and superficial, but exactly this track wants to be a kind of ballad. With that said, one can accept one track with this configuration. I admit that some dignified instrumental parts and the slightly nested ending are almost tolerable. With a large dose of good will one can say that \"Turbo Lover\" and \"Out in the Cold\" make the best of the situation.\n\nThe sad rest of the album - and \"rest\" means seven tracks in this context - is nothing else but a pile of sonic and lyrical excrements. Help me to forget these useless and stereotyped lines. It does not make sense to have a close look at the texts. Already the song titles speak volumes: \"Rock You All Around the World\" - innovative! \"Hot for Love\" - spectacular! \"Wild Nights, Hot and Crazy Days\" - jackpot! Do you really want further details? Lines like \"You know every boy and girl / Goes crazy to the beat of rock n' roll\"? I don't think so. But there is another strange detail that leaves me stunned. A more than solid speedster was dropped during the record session. Total triumph of stupidity! Check out \"All Fired Up\", a more or less close relative of songs such as \"Rapid Fire\" and \"Freewheel Burning\". You can find it on YouTube. Ask yourself why this sledgehammer has not been taken into account. The answer is clear, it was just too heavy and would have destroyed the nerve-shattering homogeneity of the completely relaxed song material. As a logical consequence of this dubious strategy, Judas Priest wallowed in their self-made hell of airy tones and cheap melodies. Do what thou wilt has always been a very ambivalent motto and here it shows its ugliest face. You are always welcome to defend the faith, but you cannot betray your followers just two years later. Too bad that the presentation of timid guitars, powerless vocals, clicking drums and overly simple - I beg your pardon, I wanted to say catchy - lines is nothing else but an act of betrayal.\n\nIt does not take much to hate this emotionless masterpiece of sterility. Just listen to a plastic tune like \"Parental Guidance\", the exact opposite of everything which can be deemed as good music. Or lend an ear to \"Locked In\", another prime example of songs that the world did not ask for. In a nutshell, this album is only recommendable for those who visit this website due to some unintentional inputs. Anyway, if a turbo engine really sounds like this soulless crap, I prefer to drive go-cart.\n",
        "\nSurprise, surprise, I am not the first dude who writes a review for \"Defenders of the Faith\". Moreover, guess I will not be the last one as well. Even 32 years after its publication, it seems as if the album still emanates an awe-inspiring, ultra-large fascination. The reason is plain. Judas Priest defined the formula of heavy metal made in 1984. To put it more precisely, Priest covered a wide spectrum that presented more or less all facets of contemporary metal. From the high-speed opener \"Freewheel Burning\" to the ballad \"Night Comes Down\", from the (partially) clinical \"Love Bites\" to the earthy \"Some Heads Are Gonna Roll\" and from the complex \"The Sentinel\" to the straight \"Eat Me Alive\", the pioneers dished up a varied menu. Neither beforehand nor later, the band reached such an outstanding form again. Even the groundbreaking \"British Steel\" is forced to lay down its arms, regardless of its immortal classics like \"Rapid Fire\" or \"Breaking the Law\".\n\nI did not like the gay outfit of Halford, but I was able to ignore it successfully and well, to be honest, I never intended to marry him. So what! Instead of thinking about his sexual preferences, I just enjoyed his highly charismatic, sometimes almost lethally piercing vocals and the great music. The only number that did not fully meet my taste was, of course, the ballad. Nevertheless, its melancholic touch had its charm, too. Moreover, this song was not as commercial as \"Living After Midnight\" or \"United\", the overly polished and embarrassingly smooth good times rocker from \"British Steel\". Seen from this perspective, I appreciated \"Night Comes Down\" up to a certain degree. Anyway, the really mind-blowing tracks had other names. The ironclad, perfect production gilded the highlights - and there were a lot of outstanding songs.\n\nJudas Priest demonstrated in a furious manner that they knew how to combine robust heaviness with the necessary amount of melody. Tracks like the prototypical, somewhat shady \"Jawbreaker\" did not lack of meticulously designed yet extremely lively parts and they also possessed some hymnal elements. Nevertheless, the fundament was built of pure steel. Speaking of hymnal sequences, the heavyweight \"Rock Hard Ride Free\" must be mentioned. In particular its suspenseful bridge with Halford's high-pitched screams and the ultra-effective chorus reflected the compositional talent of the formation. This down-to-earth song sounded like the epitome of heavy metal. Okay, I hear the visitors on the cheapest places of the metal arena screaming: the chorus is too simple. My dear blockheads, the best things in life are the simple things: a well-tempered drink, a kiss of your girlfriend (if one exists), some heavy music and so on. I know, the apostles of progress will never share this point of view. Come on guys, leave the arena and join the Dream Theatre while we are listening - among other things - to the overwhelming, thoroughly thought out solos of the here collected tunes.\n\nAs mentioned above, the production was second to none. It matched the musical content in any respect. Inter alia, it shared the music's diversity, at least to a certain extent. Some sterile beats (\"Heavy Duty\") and a lot of reverb (\"Love Bites\") stood in sharp contrast to the generic overall impression. However, all technical elements fit together magically and one could bang his head in an enthusiastic manner. The only danger was to lose one's self-control in view of fanatic crushers such as \"Freewheel Burning\". I do not want to know how many thrash and speed metal bands have been inspired by this metal storm. Each and every tone of the guitars hit the mark, Halford pulled out all the stops and the rhythm section acted flawlessly as well. The figurative lyrics (\"Born to lead at breakneck speed, with high octane - we're spitting flames\") put the cherry on the cake. I am sorry, I have no English word to describe this masterpiece. Back in Germany in 1984, we used terms like \"ultraoberaffengeil\", but that's another story. \n\nDespite true classics like \"Eat Me Alive\" or \"The Sentinel\", \"Freewheel Burning\" was the Alpha and the title track the Omega of the defenders' alphabet. Hell yes, the title track with its minimalist length of 90 seconds was rather an outro and its entire lyrics came together in its title. And yet, it was an impressive, triumphant ending. Forgive us, we were young and clueless and we really believed that these guys were the defenders of our faith. Two years later, the band released \"Turbo\" - and my mates and I were totally disillusioned. Anyway, this is not the time to moan about one of the greatest disasters in the history of metal and the review deserves a more positive end. Plainly speaking, if you want to meet the spirit of natural heavy metal, you must get in touch with \"Defenders of the Faith\".\n",
        "\nRiding high on the strength of two late 1970s studio releases, Stained Class and Hell Bent for Leather, Judas Priest returned with their first official concert recording, Unleashed In The East. Recorded during dates in 1979, from Japan, Judas Priest is captured blowing out an energized set of unrelenting metal. While the live tracks underwent serious doctoring during the mixing process, Unleashed in the East slays with aggression. The sheer intensity of this entire live set is riveting\n\nUnleashed in the East is by far the best metal live album ever if not the best album in metal! Its showed the band's true sound, and pulled metal out of the psychedelic element that it was attached to. The drums are really punchy, which was lacking on their previous discography, Glenn and KK guitars are really alive here, and on top of that we have Mr. Halford with his high range vocals that become melodic at times. After all this live album is what really turned me into a fan because this showed the band's true sound, and pulled metal out of the psychedelic element that it was attached to earlier. \n\nYes Unleashed in the East was doctored, the record had a bit of studio touching up after the fact, and Rob Halford may have even redone all his vocals. It's a common practice among live albums and it's actually kind of interesting to see that bands who were known for being untouchable live couldn't even record a show without fixing a bunch of stuff along the way.\n\nWhatever the case may be, Unleashed in the East is legendary and super influential. It's like someone took an alchemical distillation of the aggressive side of Judas Priest's 70's albums and then turned the metal-ness knob up to 11. The result is here, and it might very well be the blueprint for how the genre of heavy metal developed in the 1980s. Everything is faster, heavier, delivered with twice the energy and backed with a good amount of crowd noise (real or not). The set list is great, of course I would have liked to hear Stained Class and Dreamer Deceiver but everything here is crucial. Make sure to get the version with the bonus tracks as they're from the same show and of equal quality!\n",
        "\nRegardless of the inconsistent musical foundation behind \"Sin After Sin, the album shows a more mature side of the band and the blueprint on which they built their way forward. Furthermore, the music featured herein would also provide much of the rhythmical construction for several speed, power and thrash metal bands, in other words, almost everything but the most extreme subgenres/forms of metal. And believe it or not, this rhythmical construction would be provided not just by the tremendous guitar duo formed by Tipton and Downing, but also by the teenager, talented drummer Simon Phillips, who in just few minutes of an impressing performance would show the first references of certain drumming techniques such as the double-bass.\n\nThe album is opened in such an impressing fashion by \"Sinner\", which is quite tricky, since despite of the softer riffs and the Zeppelinesque influences featured therein, it is full of speedish drumming passages, such as the ones played during the chorus, which are somehow similar to many other that would be featured in \"Painkiller\". Then, the Joan Baez cover \"Diamonds and Rust\" is much more of a Halford thing due to the strong emphasis given to his vocals, and his intonation throughout the lines of the song would be part of different compositions of many European power metal bands; but rather than simply that, it is one of the best covers ever done in the heavy metal history, simply played in their own way.\n\nAnd even though the band left behind much of the atmosphere and sound of their preceding album, the ballads did not run with this luck. The band wrote two impressive ballads (\"Last Rose of the Summer\" and \"Here Comes the Tears\"), and the dark and gothic lyrics embedded in the songs would fit perfectly the soft and dark atmosphere of these ballads. \"Call for the Priest\" holds one of the basic constructions that would be featured in speed metal music, and it is possible to mention a good number of songs built on this blueprint, starting with the slower-paced epic Blind Fury's number \"Out of Reach\" and also their faster opening track \"Do It Fast, Do It Loud\".\n\nThe stellar moment of the album is the closing track \"Dissident Aggressor\", which is tremendously ahead of its time. Firstly, since the song features a drumming technique which would not be common during the 70's, that is the double bass drumming. Furthermore, its riffs are stronger than in any song of the album, providing a very aggressive sound, which altogether with \"Tyrant\" would estimulate the creative abilities of Kerry King and company in such a way that no single band would ever do. Definitely, it is the most vicious song and the heavier moment of the band in the album.\n\nPerhaps \"Sin After Sin\" is not considered the most memorable release of the band; however, it is one of the most influential. And after their succeeding release \"Stained Class\", the band was leading into a huge commercial success that unfortunately would put things in a wrong place. That is, masterpieces like this one would be forgotten and abandoned, and other average releases like \"British Steel\" would be overrated. Therefore, the album is recommended for people who really want further knowledge on heavy metal music, but it is mostly advisable to give it a chance. It would provide excellent moments for sure.\n",
        "\nNo single album from the British metallers could ever match the complexity and musicianship of their sophomore effort. It is clear that the band left behind the hippie influences that made up their debut, and their ability to mix the hard rock music with the doomish/gothic sound of Black Sabbath made of this album a unique heavy metal work. And while Black Sabbath traded their heaviness for a softer music (i.e., AOR) in \"Technical Ecstasy\", Judas Priest was bringing out a quite innovative musical concept, in which they took heavy metal into new levels of darkness, musical precision and roughness.\n\nIts solid songwriting work is shown from the beginning to the end, and the songs featured herein became an important influence for bands like Iron Maiden or the Danish black metal band Mercyful Fate, but also for whole subgenres like the NWOBHM and thrash metal. However, much of this influence is pretty much owed to the abilities of the band on writing quite memorable songs which remain as classics and unavoidable concert numbers, starting with the lengthy multi-sectioned powerful opening track \"Victim of Changes\". The riffs that it features, the powerful vocals of Rob Halford and the quite complex but astonishing drums played by Alan Moore brought altogether a subtle, outrageous sound.\n\nLeaving behind the lyric topics related to frustrated romance, the band took things far beyond through their remaining songs which definitely remained loyal to the obscure, dramatic and tense songwriting style of Black Sabbath. They address all kind of horrors and fantasies related to the torture and powerlessness (going from the abuse of power and oppression in \"Tyrant\" up to the murders and terror of \"Genocide\"). Besides \"Victim of Changes\", the album features other three classic numbers (\"Tyrant\", \"The Ripper\", and \"Genocide\"). What they have in common, is once again, the tremendous influence that they had in the way forward. Of course, the three songs are musically different. \"Tyrant\" is played in a more thrashy fashion and it exploits the guitar innovations of Tipton and Downing, \"The Ripper\" would establish some rules on how NWOBHM riffs should sound like, and \"Genocide\" sounds like a faster hard rock song with heavy metal riffs, though.\n\nOf course their work would become a little bit improved, while other innovations were waiting to appear as soon as their albums were released. Nonetheless, these innovations would not outweigh the musical performance displayed herein, which should be borne in mind when talking about the meaning that this album has for the genre. Although this album did not reach the commercial success that was expected by the band at the time of its release, it came to the attention of Columbia. This is indeed the beginning of a successful career and a new chance for heavy metal music to gain respectability. [The CD versions start with \"Victim of Changes\", while the Gull's vinyl version starts with \"Prelude\".]\n",
        "\nJudas Priest with the biggest and possibly the only heavy metal producer at the time... Rodger Bain! The boys in Priest thought the producer of the first 3 Black Sabbath albums could make them into one of the next biggest metal bands but they would unfortunately wait another two years for that happen because Rodger Bain had other plans in mind. Leaving later classics from the album such as The Ripper, Genocide, Tyrant and the epic Victim of Changes (titled Whiskey Women at this time) resulted in a very bluesy album different to the Metal Gods we all know and love today. \n\nThe album turns out to be a bluesy mess without a direction although amongst the mess are standout tracks such as the title track and Run To The Mill with Glenn Tipton and K.K. Downing showing off their new found powers with their twin lead guitar although not to the extent of intro of Victim Of Changes for example. A few songs off this album were written suited more to former singer Al Atkins' bluesy like voice which did not show Rob's full abilities with his high pitched screams and growls that we all know today. \n\nThe music has more of a bluesy feel compared to the albums that were gonna come after this. Ballads like Run To The Mill gives a glimpse of what was to come with songs like Dreamer Deceiver and Beyond The Realms Of Death on the next album. The title track and Never Satisfied show what Judas Priest could do with Glenn and K.K. doing twin leads on the former and the latter being known so well to be played on the band's Epitaph tour which was meant to be their farewell. \n\nThe main problem that Priest fans find with this album is that it simply doesn't sound like classic Priest. All of their albums were different in a way but all retained a heavy metal feel to it but this one really doesn't. Maybe if Bain decided to add all of the classic songs that were cut off from this album, it would have resulted in a much better album. The future holds quite a lot for Priest though....\n",
        "\nWell yes, you guessed it right: this is my favorite album in existence. For my 100th review in MA (with apologies to the moderators) I had to do something special. So\u2026 are you in for non-stop fanboy masturbatory praise mini-novel? If you are, welcome, my valiant friend. I applaud you. If you're not, well, I honestly don't care much\u2026 after all, Painkiller's better than you, better than me ;) It all started at the end of the 80s, when Priest realized they were famous and successful enough but needed to ante up their game, as younger, bolder bands were producing more powerful metal; faster, heavier, meaner, tighter. Thrash metal, speed metal, power metal and even the nastier nascent death metal, which had already reared it's rotten head here and there, made their last couple of albums, Turbo and Ram it Down, sound like Duran Duran. It has been reported that the Metal Gods themselves where actively listening to all this metal bonanza made by their human followers, so decided to descend back to Earth to push the limits once again, as they did during the mid-70s, when they took the metal throne from Sabbath. They did so, thus unleashing upon the masses their utmost champion, the ultimate metal creation: THE FUCKING PAINKILLER!\n\nI was around fourteen years old when a friend lent me THE GREATEST METAL ALBUM OF ALL TIME. I had not listened to Judas Priest previously, so didn't have any expectations about it. My friend told me the vocals were \u201ctoo much\u201d, but after you got used to them they kicked ass. Before that point, my experience in metal was reduced to worshipping Metallica above everything else, listening to them on a daily basis while also listening to some Scorpions, Megadeth, some Pantera and 90s Sepultura\u2026 so you can imagine my head exploding the first time the title-track came blasting forth from my speakers. Sweet baby Rob!!! What the hell is this?! So much power, so much energy! Those mighty riffs, those stratospheric screams, Scott's thunderous double bass battery\u2026 they changed my life forever. Before pushing 'play' a Metallica fanboy existed. After listening to the whole thing, a metalhead emerged. Painkiller got me delving further into Judas Priest past discography, along with Iron Maiden's. And from there, I just kept exploring and exploring. I thank this record for giving me my current taste in metal, and not allowing myself to be transformed into a nu metal adorer and consumer during the mid-to-late 90s, as most of my generation in Mexico did. Black Sabbath, Slayer, Blind Guardian, Immortal, Suffocation, Candlemass\u2026 they were all waiting for me out there. The Painkiller showed me the way. So to this day, you can understand why there isn't an album I cherish, enjoy and worship more than this one. \n\nStarting with Mark Wilkinson's cover artwork (the band\u2019s concept, actually), this got me by the balls with a grip of steel and never let go. I was already immersed deep into all things fantasy, sci-fi and horror, so watching a badass but sensual, maybe even a bit homoerotic (perhaps Rob's suggestion) metallic angel riding a flying, living dragon-Harley over a red-hot apocalyptic landscape, complete with humans jumping out of the falling buildings into their fiery demise, had all the right elements to make me really interested. The booklet also, as some of my fellow reviewers have already mentioned, is also iconic in its own right. Red pages with a clear grey Judas Priest cross logo stamped on them, a simple but monumental black and white photo of the band posing amidst a rocky landscape, looking like some rejects from Lord Humungus' gang in Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior. Even the buzzsaw shape of the CD\u2026 damn, this album was conceived to slay and kick so much ass! Though nothing could have ever prepared me for what I was about to listen. Not even if I had been able to listen to Priest's material before this one. Oh no, this is another whole fucking level! \n\nRight from Scott Travis' immortal drum solo intro 'til the final fading notes of \u201cOne Shot at Glory\u201d this is pure metal mastery, supreme and stainless. The addition of the Racer-X drummer brought additional power and speed (two words I will repeat ad nauseam in this review) to their rhythmic section, which hasn't been this interesting and mighty since the late 70s. A master of double bass pummeling, you can witness his awesomeness in all songs, but I'd say \u201cLeather Rebel\u201d is the composition in which he shines the most. Fortunately for the band and the rest of the World, Scott would become Judas Priest's definitive drummer, as he continues to play in the band, 27 years and counting, playing the classics with ease while still hitting the skins at full speed when needed. Honestly, Ian Hill's bass playing has never been more than compelling, an often quiet but always solid backbone for the rest of the band, and that didn't change here. But that doesn't diminishes this tour-de-force's quality nor status at the top of the metal elite masterpieces, not when you have the Holy Trinity of Downing-Halford-Tipton putting to tape the best work of their lives. \n\nThe speed metal anthem that is the colossal opening title-track is arguably the best metal song ever, despite being born 20 years after the birth of heavy metal music. The riffs and rhythm are just irresistible to headbangers worldwide; there's just no fucking way to listen to it and not bang your head as fast as possible. It also features one of metal's greatest guitar solos ever, at almost one and a half minute in length probably Glenn Tipton's magnum opus. K.K. Downing's output is no less stellar, and one can attest he was and is as great as Glenn in the slightly overlooked closer \u201cOne Shot at Glory\u201d, which happens to be one of his and the record's strongest compositions. But the riffs in each and every tune here have enough personality, complexity and raw power to propel every song into metal stardom. Most compositions are fast, but not everything's relentless blazing. Pace is slowed down a bit during the creepy and nasty \u201cNight Crawler\u201d or the dark ballad \u201cA Touch of Evil\u201d, which compensate their apparent lower energy levels with awesome atmosphere. Between the two Priest axemen, at that time already veteran riffcrafters, they gave the World a masterclass in how to compose and play metal, AGAIN. And there, my metal brothers and sisters, resides some of the magic and importance of this work. Not only it rekindled Priest's career and artistic credibility, but cut their ties on living from past glories and helped push the whole scene into new territory. This is indeed a 1990 album, and the 80s where left behind in its scorching, influential path. Newer bands would look up to the Metal Gods again, with their new level of aggression, speed and power as the measuring stick. \n\nHere is where I comment on the Thundersteel comparison issue. Well, no one can deny there are similarities between Riot's and Priest's masterpieces, and to be honest I love them both, both deserve a 100% rating in my book. Perhaps that American album is one of the many that influenced Priest in their change of direction, though that was already hinted in 1988's Ram it Down. But there's something that makes the difference evident between the two. Or more aptly said, someone. With all my respect and love to Tony Moore's vocals\u2026 he's just not The Metal God. Robert John Arthur Halford delivers here what is indisputably (at least for me) the greatest performance by a metal vocalist \u2026 ever. His vocals on \u201cPainkiller\u201d are something from beyond this plane of existence. He truly sounds both divine and evil, omnipotent, badass beyond compare, simply mind-blowing! For me the only comparison would be himself on \u201cDreamer Deceiver\u201d from Sad Wings. It took me some time to adjust to his level of awesomeness, but I remembered what my friend told me. He does shine in the whole record, just like his bandmates, but the title-track remains my favorite from him, and when he sings it live\u2026 DAMN! That is certainly something to behold, even now, 26 years after recording and performing it for the first time. \n\nThundersteel and Painkiller are also differentiated by their production values. Another sign of the changing times Priest was committed to undertake, is the fact that Chris Tsangarides replaced long time collaborator Tom Allom, giving them a meatier, clearer but at the same time harder edged sound, while contributing to the composition of \u201cA Touch of Evil\u201d. Riot's album sounds deeply rooted in the 80s, while Painkiller sounds way more modern, and its powerful mixing holds up to today's standards of quality with ease. And finally, the former record has a greater power metal influence, belonging with the great USPM classics Ample Destruction and Unstoppable Force as the top of their style, while Priest's twelfth studio LP is unadulterated heavy metal accelerated to rapid fire velocity; the quintessential speed metal record. Complete with simplistic but hymn-like unforgettable lyrics, nothing beats it:\n\n\u201cLike wildfire\nComes roaring\nMad whirlwind\nBurning the road\n\nBlack thunder\nWhite lightning\nSpeed demons cry\nThe Hell Patrol\u201d\n\nMetal maniacs, metal saviors, blazing salvo, darkness, fire, glory\u2026 it's all metal ethos here. Clich\u00e9 as hell? Sure. Metal 101 lore? You fuckin' bet your ass! Sure, it isn't the fastest, more technical metal album ever released, it wasn't in its day for a start, but the sheer power, class and spirit this magnum opus possesses will never be matched, not to mention NO ONE can or will ever match the Metal God\u2019s metahuman singing on this record. For me, this is the One Ring, the apex predator in metal, the masterpiece of masterpieces, the one album I would play to aliens visiting our planet not knowing what metal music is, the one album I would play to humans from an alternate dimension in which Dio, Lemmy, Cliff, Pete Steele, Midnight, J.D. Kimball, Clive Burr, Jimmy Bain and Nick Menza are alive and well, still playing, but there's no Judas Priest. If you are new to metal and interested in learning, picking this record is probably the best thing you can do. If you're a veteran like myself, or even more veteran, well\u2026 let's sing along: \n\nPAAAIN!!!\n",
        "\nJudas Priest's comeback record with original singer Rob Halford is quite a mixed bag. ''Angel of Retribution'' is clearly better than the tame predecessor ''Demolition'' or the overlong successor ''Nostradamus'' but it can't mess with the band's classic records at any time. While this record includes a few potent tracks, it includes just as many uninspired fillers. Inconsistency is the key word to describe this release.\n\nOn the positive side, the opener ''Judas Rising'' is a glorious and powerful heavy metal anthem that convinces with fierce riffs, uplifting melodies and a strong vocal performance by Rob Halford. This juvenile song goes straight back to the style of Painkiller and sounds as if the band had never been restructured over the past one and a half decades. Still, the band has also kept the more experimental spirit of the studio records with Tim Owens. The calm and bass-driven half-ballad ''Worth Fighting For'' is a real grower and one of the most original tunes in the band's career. The emotional ballad ''Angel'' might be among the best mellower tunes in the band's extensive career and this song underlines Rob Halford's still outstanding vocal skills best on this album along with the opener. The epic album closer ''Lochness'' will divide fans and critics alike. Some might find this song too long, plodding and unspectacular which is perfectly understandable. Still, this song has become my personal highlight of this release. Judas Priest's longest track ever is a gloomy doom metal epic with an extremely heavy main riff, unusually distorted guitar solos and a glorious chorus with majestic proportions of a national anthem. It's a quite unusual track for the band and reminds me a lot of Black Sabbath which happens to be one of my favorite bands. Let's add to the positive points that the production of the record is clear and powerful and that the cover artwork is simple yet appropriate and one of the band's best in my book.\n\nOn the negative side, this record includes many uninspired heavy metal tunes that try to go back to the band's earlier records but fail to develop the same authenticity, creativity and energy. These songs aren't memorable at all and would have been bonus tracks at best two and three decades ago. Especially the mid-tempo stomper ''Revolution'' with its annoying chorus is maybe the band's worst single choice ever and sounds like a lackluster leftover from the Jugulator sessions. The most boring tune is the vapid interlude ''Eulogy''. Instrumentally, this track is sleep-inducing, the vocals are powerless and the lyrics mildly amusing as if an inexperienced high school student had attempted to write a poem quoting some Judas Priest song titles in about five minutes. There isn't any valid reason for this tune to even exist.\n\nIn the end, ''Angel of Retribution'' isn't a very strong comeback album. It has less than a handful of strong moments, one controversial epic that fans either love or hate and a lot of uninspired mediocrity. This album is only partially going back to the band's origins and also includes more experimental elements of the past two releases which makes the final result sound directionless. Most tracks have a slightly gloomy tone which gives this album at least a little guiding line. Ambitious collectors and faithful fans of long date might buy this record but occasional fans should only grab this average output for a handful of dollars from a cheap storage box.\n",
        "\nThis was the first Judas Priest album I have listened to and it still stands as one of my favorites. This seemed like the band's most creative peak in their career as the album breaks a lot of ground and has a great layer of diversity to it to cap it off. After following Sad Wings of Destiny, which was a lot more blues rock based, they drifted away from relying on what had been the trend for most metal music in the 1970s and started what music would become in the latter portion of the 1970s into the early 1980s. \n\nThe musicality on this album shows the Priests at their most creative. The energy is intense on many of these songs and push the limits on what was acceptable on metal album during this period of time. Downing and Tipton show what it can be like to have duel guitars on tracks bounce either off each other or together in a masterful way. One of my favorite aspects of this album, however, are the guest drums by Simon Phillips which add a layer of heaviness to the album especially on tracks such as Let Us Pray / Call the Priest and Sinner. Halford's vocals are amazing on this album and hits some of his highest notes in his career in songs such as Starbreaker and his most emotional and dramatic on songs like Last Rose of Summer. Overall, this is one of the band's tightest albums together. \n\nThe production on this album is heavy and clear. The sound isn't too mushy but at the same time, it isn't too thin either which would be the problem on their next album, Stained Class. The double bass sounds amazing with the guitar tones that have their own signature sound. The vocal harmonies are on point and don't overpower the guitars, bass and drums. You can even hear the bass on this album which was something that was hard to hear on many albums during this era. \n\nWith all that I have said, this album could have been perfect. There are a couple of songs here that completely kill the vibe of this album. First, Raw Deal is just another bluesy track that has a slow start but redeems itself in the latter half. Here Come The Tears is what essentially brings this score down to, well, not a perfect score. It's just boring and grows very dull and tired after the first couple of listens. Rob's vocals are missing the edge on them as he had on other tracks and the guitar work is pretty generic. This song would eventually start a very bad trend of piss poor ballads that would show up on future Judas Priest Albums. \n\nWhile this albums has its Diamonds and Rust, I cannot deny that this is one of my favorite Judas Priest albums. With the band inspiring acts that would dominate the NWOBHM scene in the next year or two, this was a solid start of an amazing era of game changing music. However, the end of the Priest's creative era.\n",
        "\nStained Class is easily among the absolute greatest heavy metal albums ever produced. All 9 songs, all of them, are exceptional. There is never a dull moment in the entire 43 minutes of the album. There is a musical depth and creativity here that is unmatched by any other Priest album. In my opinion Stained Class is Judas Priest at their creative peak. \n\nIn addition to being among the best metal albums ever, it's also one of the most influential. The opening track, \"Exciter\", is quintessential speed metal, and can be said to have laid the foundation for what was to come later, 80's thrash. The tempo for Exciter is about 132 bpm, which is not super fast by today's standards, but for it's time it could be said to be pretty blazing. Exciter also features double bass drumming from Les Binks, which was pretty groundbreaking for its time. \n\nEvery track features top notch guitar riffs that really stand out melodically. The riffing is not as thick or as heavy as on, for instance, British Steel. They are generally more groovy, and they are spectacular. Every song has at least one really great guitar riff, and several songs have more than one. \"White Heat, Red Hot\", and \"Better by You, Better Than Me\" both begin with a few measures of an excellent opening guitar riff, after which the rhythm section kicks in, creating a perfect, groovy, pounding melody. The lead guitar parts are played harmoniously, and with beautiful feeling and soul. Tipton and Downing's twin guitar teamwork produces some of the finest melody and counter-melody action I've ever heard. Their playing technique is delivered with impeccable skill and precision. \n\nOf all Priest albums, this one takes the cake featuring the clearest, cleanest vocal sound by singer Rob Halford. He's perfectly on pitch, vibrant, and ripened with an operatic, high ranged tone that he delivers with great passion and power. The vocal melodies themselves are also very well composed. Lyrically, Stained Class is of a darker, deeper, and more sophisticated nature than other Priest albums. The lyrics for songs such as \"Savage\", \"Beyond the Realms of Death\", and the title track are all masterfully crafted and contain very passionate, heartfelt meanings. The overall level of lyrical artistry and creativity on Stained Class is better than any other Priest album in my opinion. There is also great use of harmonic, studio backing vocals on many of the tracks, such as \"White Heat, Red Hot\", an absolute gem. The opening of \"Savage\" features an amazingly high note sung by Halford which is just mind blowing. Rob Halford's performance on Stained Class might very well be the greatest work of his career. \n\nThe production and the mix on Stained Class is damn near perfect. Every note from every instrument can be clearly heard and is dialed to just the right volume. The drums have a particularly crisp sound, and Les Binks makes good work of the entire drum kit. The bass guitar can be heard and is distinguishable from the electric guitars over top of it, and Ian Hill uses an appropriate playing style which backs the band without being excessive. The bottom end of the music is not overly heavy or distorted, rather it is nicely tuned to a very clear sound which makes everything easier to hear and enjoy. \n\nThere are no weak songs on the album. As I said, all 9 of them are great. There are only some parts which are slightly less interesting than others. Listening to this album, from start to finish, truly is thoroughly enjoyable on multiple levels. The entire band plays with passion, depth, and talent. Stained Class highlights every great feature of Judas Priest in its best form. It surely will stand the test of time for it's outstanding musical quality and tremendous influence.\n",
        "\nStained Class. One of the single greatest metal albums ever to be recorded. From start to finish it is loaded with fantastic musicianship across the board, a brilliant balance between straightforward and complex song structures, lyrics and an atmosphere that was as dark as they came at the time, and embodied that rockin' attitude and coolness that came to define the genre and this band in the following decade. The prototypes for the NWOBHM, speed and even power metal can be traced back to this album.\n\nAs far as what the sound of the album as like, it's quite interesting. Based on the music alone, I would say that this album is the exact moment where Priest started to become dumber and dumber, a slide that continued throughout the '80s. Don't get me wrong here - this is hardly Turbo, and is still a far more nuanced and intelligent album than what would follow, but compared to the two albums that came before this is a comparatively streamlined and simple effort. And just as well, the band ditch a lot of the progressive and atmospheric leanings that were found in earlier efforts, instead going for a highly riff-driven and aggressive sound that focuses on shorter songs and more verse-chorus structuring than before. This is for all intents and purposes straight and true heavy metal in the purest sense, the streamlined and polished kind that this band would peddle throughout the '80s, albeit with far dumber lyrics than what is presented here.\n\nThe instrumentation on this album is ace. The drumming, for instance, is some of the most inventive and varied of its day. Les Binks here knows exactly the right beat for the right moment. For more rock based songs like the Spooky Tooth cover, he elects to go for simple straight beats. He might throw in a few fills on more complex (but still distinctly rocking) tracks like 'White Heat, Red Hot' or 'Savage'. He might slow down beyond even that for Priest's last proper progressive song on 'Beyond the Realms of Death'. From out of nowhere though, we get some  double bass in the vein of '80s speed metal with 'Exciter', which is easily the most cutting edge song on here. That type of drumming would be aped by bands throughout the next decade, even by this own band over a decade later. He may not be as intense as Scott Travis, but he is by far the more creative and varied drummer.\n\nThe guitars are, as you would expect, fantastic. Ian Hill's bass lines can't necessarily be heard as is the way, but in spite of the clinical and thin production that was a norm for the day they can most certainly be felt. He doesn't have any time to his own \u00e1 la their debut, but he works in perfect unison with the rhythm guitars to give them a driving, hard edge. The riffs on this album are absolutely superb, being highly metallic while still being cut from a hard rock-infused cloth, and are just so damn cool that you will find yourself instinctively nodding your head and swaying to 'Saints in Hell' or the title track. They are memorable largely due to how well-crafted they are along with a tasteful amount of repetition. And the leads of the famed shredding team of Downing and Tipton? Needless to say, they kick ass! Whether it be that utterly fantastic power metal-esque second solo on 'Exciter', the haunting and mournful work on 'Beyond the Realms of Death', you would be hard pressed to name a more awesome pair of guitarists than these two.\n\nThe vocals are out of this world. Halford shows off just how dynamic and powerful a vocalist he truly is, with haunting and searing highs being found all over the place, placed perfectly in the songs to coincide with a climactic point. His mid-range is commanding and powerful, and the transition between high and mid is as smooth and natural as they come. He can be aggressive when necessary, like the hard drivin' 'White Heat, Red Hot', put a surprising amount of attitude while still being agonisingly heartfelt in the ode to the tribesmen that is 'Savage', or just go all guns blazing like on a certain bit of pioneering speed metal.\n\nThe songwriting is a nice mix between the straightforward and the progressive, and captures the perfect balance in the streamlining process the band was going under with every album. Barring the incredible 'Beyond the Realms of Death', which is a brooding near 7 minute epic that alternates between acoustic and melancholic verses, an agonised and heavier hook and a frantic ending, the songs here are streamlined while still carrying great variation. Even the commercial and simple Spooky Tooth cover throws in a nice throwback to the era that spawned it with a vaguely psychedelic part. The songs on the whole generally throw in two to four differing sections despite their short length and streamlined nature, and overall this is an album that is as varied and eclectic in the moods and textures produced as Sin After Sin while sonically being a more homogeneous record. The greatest example of this album's nuance would be 'Exciter', which aside from the twin soloing sticks to verse-chorus structures greatly, and uses the moods produced in the similar sounding sections to create variation, as opposed to chucking in a moody, synth-led section \u00e1 la 'Victim of Changes'.\n\nThis album is the perfect balance. Streamlined without being plain and dumb (even if that isn't a bad thing either), technical without being an ego pump, stylistically consistent without being boring, and very clearly '70s in its nature while still being cutting edge for its time and utterly timeless to this day. It shows off the band at their finest, and while this may lack the double bass, shrieking and thrash riffs of the almighty Painkiller, that album is pretty much this one after several implants, steroid injections, intense workout and diet regimens and being painted silver. The root of the burning metallic glory that we would all come to love about Priest can be found here, as can the introspective intelligence of their preceding '70s albums. The only thing fans of their '80s period should look out for is the thin production, which is hardly an issue given that everything is still clear and reasonably heavy, but the album doesn't quite sound like it is made of metal akin to their mid '80s efforts.\n\nAnd really, just *look* at that cover art. The sheer '70s coolness of that alone should be enough to get the vinyl, even if you hate this kind of metal, just to put it on a shelf.\n",
        "\nYou know a band like Judas Priest is freakin' awesome when you hear so many unique opinions about their many different albums. The trilogy of Sad Wings of Destiny, Sin After Sin, and Stained Class is downright legendary, all three of these are essential listening for every metalhead. This is obvious, these records were groundbreaking and kick total ass even to this day, but metal fans young and old differ on one question - which one is the best? I know people who say Sad Wings is Priest's best, and others who say that Stained Class is the best. But no matter your opinion, you can't count out Sin After Sin! In my book, this album is inferior to its predecessor and successor, but it is still a force to be reckoned with.\n\nDespite my opinion of it currently, I had a really hard time getting into this album. To me, this is far weaker than both Sad Wings and Stained Class. The music within is largely the natural progression from the previous effort to Stained Class, which means less blues influences and more speed and aggression, at least for the most part. I, for one, think that this album is a bit soft. It's not even as heavy as Sad Wings was. There are three ballads, and one mostly mid paced track - so right off the bat, this album is not the even close to metal beasts that were the slices of bread that make up this proverbial sandwich. This can be a big turn-off to those coming from one of those to this one, but do give it a chance. It took a while to grow on me, but now it gets frequent spins from me. \n\nWhen this album wants to be awesome, it's downright badass. The album opens with \"Sinner\", which is one of JP's most insanely badass tracks to ever come from their entire discography. The song features a set of ballsy and driving guitar riffs accompanied by awesome bass and drums for its entire running time, not to mention the eerie interlude section. This song is by far the best on the album, and it gives a showcase of the kind of 70's Priest angst that the album dishes out a good bit of. Other highlights include the famously wicked \"Dissident Aggressor\" with its pounding drums and borderline thrash riffing - for 1977, this was nuts. It still is nuts. These two, along with \"Call For the Priest\", \"Starbreaker\", and parts of \"Raw Deal\" are the bread and butter of Sin After Sin. Totally riveting classic heavy metal awesomeness. \n\nThe lesser parts of this album are the ballads. One of the biggest songs from this album, the Joan Baez cover \"Diamonds and Rust\" is the stand out among these. The song is extremely creative, as turning this old folky song in to what Priest have done to it is pretty unique. That being said, this song is not as good as everybody says it is. It's a good and memorable track, but it loses its charm quite quickly. There is also \"Here Come the Tears\", and this song drives me freaking nuts. It is not a terrible track, entirely, but it comes across as a whiny, dramatic ordeal that wastes no time in grating on the ears. I don't care if this is considered \"emotional\" or \"touching\", it's a total flop that detracts from the album. \n\nI think rather harshly of \"Diamonds and Rust\" and \"Here Come the Tears\", but I do love \"Last Rose of Summer\". In fact, it's my second favorite song on the album. It's actually in my top 3 Judas Priest ballads, its entire being is beautiful, peaceful, inviting, and delightfully relaxing. The charming acoustic guitars accompanied by the soothing electric leads craft a marvelous soundscape for Rob's creamy soaring vocals. Definitely a winner of a song, but in the long run, it's the ballsy, aggressive tracks that make this album great. \n\nThe instrumentation of Sin After Sin is fantastic. Many claim this as Rob Halford's best performance, and while I say that goes to Stained Class, Rob kills it on this record. He never pushes the register too high, but he makes perfect use of his insane talent to its full extent. The legendary twin lead duo of Downing and Tipton bring their full bag of tricks as well, each featuring a blazing performance of fretboard wizardry. The solos are a bit frenetic, featuring some very early usage of whammy spamming in addition to some more noisier soloing techniques. The leads that sometimes accompany Rob's vocals and the leads on \"Last Rose of Summer\" are amazing, showcasing these guys' ability to give warm soaring lead melodies. \n\nIan Hill is awesome on this album, with the bass lines being groovy, creative, and the perfect backbone for the band. Thanks to the albums crystal clear production, his bass tone fits the guitars perfectly - he punches through the mix while also blending with it nicely. He also locks in wonderfully with drummer Simon Phillips, who brings an insane performance to the table. Simon Phillips is utterly fantastic here, and the drumming is one of my favorite parts of the whole album. He is fast, creative, dexterous, and his fills are way ahead of their time. The drumming on the interlude of \"Sinner\" is one of the best highlights of the album, and he adds a ton to the song. Overall, Priest rocks hard on Sin After Sin, just like they did on the previous album. \n\nWhile Sin After Sin is definitely my least favorite of Judas Priest's legendary trilogy, it still is a great heavy metal record. The musicianship is top-notch, the production is sheer perfection, and even though there are a few weak tracks, this album ends up being one of the best JP albums. I'd be lying if I said this didn't take 4 or 5 months to grow on me, but I would recommend this to all fans of classic heavy metal. \n\nSinner rider, rides in with the storm.\nThe devil rides beside him.\nThe devil is his god, God help you mourn.\nDo you, do you hear it, do you hear the thunder?\nDeafen every living thing about.\nCan you, can you see it, can you?\nSee the mountains darken yonder.\nBlack sun rising, time is running out.\n\nSacrifice to vice or die by the hand of the Sinner!\n\nSinner!\n",
        "\nIf ever there was an album that could define both power and speed metal, one which is completely evocative of metal in the '80s and the blazing, carefree spirit that supercharged the genre in that decade, it would be this. The one, the only, the almighty, chromium plated blazing steel bolt that is Painkiller. It isn't the most intelligent album ever, lyrically, structurally or aesthetically, but that is missing the point. No other album in metal is quite so capable of embracing its fun side without delving into comedic territory; this is the absolute pinnacle of the light of heart side of metal that from start to finish is an all-out assault on the senses in the most headbangable, melodic and catchy of fashions. Nothing before or since has been quite such an effective love letter to a bygone era in metal's history (not to say the '70s or '90s weren't awesome for metal in their own way, but we don't care about those times right now.) \n\nAnd not only is this *the* flagship album of the time, sub-genre and mindset it represents, but it is also the culmination of the almighty Priest, at least in their leather-clad, silly '80s form. It is the perfect combination of the rockin' heavy metal of Killing Machine up to Defenders of the Faith, the undeniable synth-laden catchiness of Turbo and half of Ram It Down, and the hard-edged aggression of the other half of Ram It Down and other classics like 'Exciter' or 'Freewheel Burning'. Wrap that all up with a new metal god behind the kit and you have a shiny, new, blazing Priest, ready to kick the thrash scene's ass with the perfect modernisation of all their past developments.\n\nRight from the off, this album grabs you by the throat and unleashes its first form of attack: THE DRUMMING! Seriously, Scott Travis of Racer X fame is an absolute tour de force behind the kit here, crashing into every single song with flurry after flurry of double bass and pounding, stomping beats. He injects the songs with so much noise and energy that he takes the songs to new heights of intensity and energy. His performance reminds me of a stampede of prize bulls running down a red brick road, all loud, stomping, over the top and furiously fast. The difference here though is that unlike said sirloin steak, he also knows when to slow down to fit with the pacing and atmosphere of the song and not throw everything off-time with his exuberance and power. He shows restraint when needed, but is otherwise balls to the wall, restless and wild, and a fucking rebel. Accept would be proud, as would any metal drummer, nay, any metalhead listening, in fact.\n\nNot to detract from the very next thing this album shoves down the listener's throat, the very body of any good metal album, the riffs. Oh yes, there are bags and bags of razor sharp and classic riffs to be found here. They perfectly nail the balance between melodic power metal epicness and hard-driving, speed metal fury, to create the ultimate in high octane metal riffing. They drive the songs like nothing else, and the album is loaded with so many of 'em, in addition to memorable licks and melodies, that everything sticks with you after one or two listens. Whether it be the thrashing goodness of 'Metal Meltdown' or 'Leather Rebel' or the more epic, power metal-esque 'Hell Patrol' or 'A Touch of Evil'... every last riff is awesome on this, every last one is memorable, every last one is headbangable, and energetic, and inspired, and just a masterclass in power/speed riffing. And of course by 'they' I meant the metal shredder tag team of Glenn Tipton and K. K. Downing... holy shit do they deliver here as ever, and not just on the rhythm front. Needless to say, the Tipton/Downing trade off leads here are as amazing as ever. The soloing is complex and lengthy without being noodling or unmemorable. They are melodic and flowing whilst still being aggressive and sharp, and are the perfect counterpoint to the pounding riffs and drumming surrounding them. Whether it be a simple harmonised lead or an all-out shred fest that would make Malmsteen smile, they do it all, and nail it every fucking time.\n\nAnd we haven't even got to the best bit yet. Rob Halford is a fucking demon on this album; he truly is a heavy metal maniac (Exciter bows down in awe.) He really gives it his all here and delivers the finest performance in his entire career, better even than the likes of 'Victim of Changes' way back in 1976. His standard mid-range is powerful and commanding as it always has been, but his constant shrieks and sporadic glass-shattering high notes are otherworldly. They are stunning, awe-inspiring, and will give anyone goosebumps. They are placed in the songs perfectly to create a haunting and tense atmosphere of unprecedented levels. And every last lyric, no matter how over the top and cheesy they may seem, is a love letter to the burning spirit that drives metal, the very core of what makes the genre so wonderful. Who cares if 'paratamize' isn't a word? They made it a word, and made it convincing enough that I'll sing along every fucking time, and if a listener has even an inkling of activity in their heart and head, they'll do the same. Something like 'Nightcrawler' is an amazing horror story of electric atmospheres and creatures clawing at the windows, told in a frantic and yet brooding way that only the best narrators can manage. Of course, the namesake 'Painkiller' is the epic tale of the metallic saviour on the cover who destroys all in its path. This is why it is called POWER metal, people!\n\nAh poor Ian Hill, he was never the most prominent of bassists and thus is seldom mentioned in the context of Priest unless it is to criticise how hidden away he is. Not on this, he isn't. It may be the production itself, which I'll get to shortly, but this album is extremely heavy for what it is, and I know for a fact that Scott Travis isn't the only one providing bass on the album. This album is as heavy as a fucking anvil, with the already hard as fuck and sharp riffs being given that bit more low-end muscle by good ol' Hill. Of course, he is being helped by the production, which is hands down one of the single best production jobs I have ever heard. The whole album sounds like it is made of stainless steel. Everything is sharp, crisp, loud and slick. The drums, particularly the omnipresent double bass, resonate like nothing else. The guitars can cut through solid lead. The vocals are the sound of a man with a metal heart, and the low end is punishing and powerful. The whole album is vivid, pulsating with energy and fucking alive, and this production is a pretty big reason as to why that is.\n\nAdd all this sheer HEAVY FUCKING METAL awesomeness together, and you get 9 unbelievably awesome monuments to metal. Judas Priest get everything right about the songwriting on this one - sticking to verse-chorus structures while making the songs evolve throughout, giving the songs a fluid, flowing texture through near constant use of the double bass, long and gratuitous soloing that never overstays its welcome, it\u2019s all here! The vocal lines are insanely memorable, which is important for something anthemic akin to the epic closer 'One Shot at Glory' or the blazing power metal track 'Between the Hammer and the Anvil'. Songs like 'A Touch of Evil' or 'Nightcrawler' evoke a strong atmosphere through either clever use of synths or haunting melodies and (relatively) occult lyrics. And then there are the speed metal masterpieces in the form of the title track (a top 3 greatest metal song for me, that is), 'Leather Rebel' and 'Metal Meltdown' - each one combining frantic drumming, thrash riffs, insane leads, Rob's alien shrieks and the fastest tempos of their career to produce burning slabs of speed metal fury. No one before or since has done it quite like these guys did it here.\n\nAnd that my friends, is that. The very definition of metal's intangible spirit, as well as the ultimate incarnation of both power and speed metal. Every aspiring power or speed metal band since looks toward this shining beacon of all that was good about metal in the '80s for inspiration. It was defined by a generation and defines generations even today. Really, for those trying to get into Priest and don't know where it all started to go wrong for the band, it was after *this* album. The insane fury of this release is the result of heightened tensions between the band, and with the loss of Halford and the release of that thing we call Jugulator, that was where it all went wrong for the metal gods. Let us not dwell on that though, for we are in the presence of the Painkiller, which is once again, the very definition of '80s metallic excess. The album that sums up and defines where it came from and what it belongs to, the ultimate tribute to all that is trve and pure and elite in metal.\n",
        "\nThis is it folks. One of the all-time classics of heavy metal along with Iron Maiden\u2019s Powerslave, Jag Panzer\u2019s Ample Destruction and many more. Seriously give it just a few listens and some part of each and every song will be stuck in your head for good! I mean it. This album is super addictive and catchier than AIDS. Of course there will be many fans out there who would proclaim Stained Class, Defenders Of The Faith or Painkiller to be their crowning achievement (and they wouldn\u2019t be wrong), but this album is where every single diverse element of the band comes together to full and perfect fruition. Still doubt my words? Well, you go right ahead and listen to any of the songs so I can watch you eating your own hat right away. \n\nAs soon as the harmonized intro of \u201cThe Hellion\u201d explodes into the opener-to-end-all-openers (yep you read that right!!) \u201cElectric Eye\u201d leading up to the uber-catchy \u201cRiding On The Wind\u201d, you just know that you\u2019re in for one hell of a ride. And seriously all of them are fucking scorchers, from \u201cPain and Pleasure\u201d to the killer title track (arguably the heaviest and fastest song on the album) \u201cDevil\u2019s Child\u201d (awesome solo) to my personal favourite \u201cBloodstone\u201d with a ridiculously catchy main riff at 0:17. Ohh boy this is just too good. Just can\u2019t keep this doozie of a song off repeat. Not all of the album is heavy metal mayhem as the metal gods show that they even rip it on the ballads with the amazing \u201cTake These Chains\u201d with another super catchy chorus and the slow spellbinding build-up of \u201cFever\u201d. Yes, diversity folks, this album has it too. And no matter what you say; whether you\u2019re a metalhead or not, there\u2019s no way in hell you can look at me and tell me that \u201cYou\u2019ve got Another Thing Coming\u201d is not one of the most fist-pumping classic 80s heavy metal songs you\u2019ve ever heard, even as a casual fan. Of course along with many other songs, but that\u2019s a list for another time. That song is just too damn catchy to be true and it could even convert non-fans. Although the last song is quite a surprise as Judas Priest showcase an almost progressive side to their music with the slow and heavy ballad \u201cPrisoner Of Your Eyes\u201d this unusual approach works marvellously and how! With amazing solos rounding off the song, this is the proper and grand way to end a classic album. \n\nAs for the individual performances, what can I really say? I mean the guitar duo of Tipton And Downing are one of the best in all of metal. Period. Together they weave a maze of delightfully catchy classic riffs and solos that are bound to stick in your head for days on end. One of the rare cases where you\u2019ll not only be humming the guitar riffs but also the vocal melodies! Yep I said it right. And this happened to me after just two spins of the album! Also Rob Halford proves it to you in fucking spades why he\u2019s considered one of the best vocalists in metal history. Although I hate to say this, but in terms of sheer consistency and songwriting perfection alone, this album destroys any of the Iron Maiden or Jag Panzer releases at the time, leaving all the other releases coughing in the dust and truly standing alone in its glory. Well Ample Destruction does come close, but not quite. \n\nBottom line is: I don\u2019t give a hoot which metal genre tickles your fancy; if you have yet to hear this album, then you\u2019re not a metal fan. As simple as that. Essential listening.\n",
        "\n\u201cCHANGEEEEE-EEEEEE-EEEEEESSSS!\u201d\n\nJudas Priest's sophomore album starts with one of the greatest metal tunes written in the 70s\u2026 or in any posterior decade. And basically, never tones down quality for the rest of the LP. Great changes were applied indeed, from their somewhat unimpressive debut from two years before, Rocka Rolla. The legend of the Metal Gods really started with the tour-de-force that is Sad Wings of Destiny, considered by some as the first, unadulterated, 100% heavy metal album ever. Personally, I'll give that title to Black Sabbath's Paranoid, but I agree that Priest took the metallic sound to glorious, unthought-of new heights, dethroning Sabbath themselves in the process and taking their place as the superior monarch of all things heavy. From '76 onwards, 'til the end of the decade, Judas Priest reigned supreme atop heavy metal's still formative kingdom, unleashing a series of unparalleled influential masterpieces in that period. \n\nThe band sounds really cohesive here, not a single note or sound out of place, in contrast to the more uneven compositions and performance of their first record. Glenn and K.K.'s riffs and solos have been propelled to mythic level, and while Rocka Rolla had sporadic episodes of potential, here it is set loose in the form of non-stop grandeur. Even the acoustic guitars and the quite decent piano paying by Tipton sound massive. The production is superb for the time, and perhaps only Ian Hill's bass guitar is muddied a bit, but I believe that's more a constant trait of the band and not an isolated flaw of this particular album. Alan Moore's drumming is solid and steady as clockwork, and while he wasn't particularly flashy or technical like some prog rock drummers of the time or even Bill Ward himself, he really doesn't needs to be. His simple but forceful beats are the great backbone on which the rest of the instruments are anchored. I believe he really shines in \u201cGenocide\u201d. But as with every Priest album that's worth listening to, it is the power of the Holy Trinity of Downing, Halford and Tipton the thing that elevates this helluva record into the stuff of legend.\n\n\u201cDreamer Deceiver\u201d, despite the more popular status of other tunes here, remains my favorite track, and it's really a shame that they haven't played it much live. But it's understandably they won't play it anymore; that song features my single favorite performance by any vocalist, ever, as Rob Halford splits the stratosphere and soars past it when he seemingly effortlessly switches from a masculine mid-tone to a diamond-shattering godlike shriek. That's just as spectacular as anything ever produced by any singer in the history of rock music. This power ballad also showcases my favorite Glenn Tipton solo of this record. But going back to the Metal God in his prime, he also shines quite brightly in the Queen-ish \u201cEpitaph\u201d. The rest of the tracks have been greatly covered by my reviewer peers, so I won't delve much into them. But rest assured that ALL OF THEM are essential pieces of heavy metal history. Personally, I enjoy even more the faster, more aggressive \u2018live\u2019 versions of \u201cVictim of Changes\u201d, \u201cTyrant\u201d and \u201cGenocide\u201d found on their amazing Unleashed in the East, but even these original incarnations are flawless. \n\nA true masterpiece can't be complete without an iconic cover artwork, and the illustration of a then young Patrick Woodroffe is an epic perfect match for the nine tales of ill-fated strife that compose this masterwork of metal; a lamenting fallen angel upon a fiery, hellish landscape, whose only remnant of faith seems to be bound to his neck in the form of the Judas Priest crucifix-like emblem, making its first appearance here. With all the right elements now aligned for the Priest, Sad Wings of Destiny is the album that allowed them to ascend a path to greatness destined only for a handful of bands in the history of metal. It would also set the bar for metal newcomers in the subsequent years, and even now, 40 years after its release, it remains a must-listen to any proven fan of our beloved music, and it will remain so 40 years from now and beyond.\n",
        "\nBuilt on the blueprint of its predecessor, \"Defenders of the Faith\" is definitely a step-up in terms of musicianship and speed; however, it did not sell as much copies as \"Screaming for Vengeance\". Even, Halford himself told that while sales of Defenders came to their peak, they were still selling copies of Screaming. And is better to not compare it with \"British Steel\", which was by far their best-seller. Furthermore, the main reason for the decrease in the sales was the lack of songs that could be as catchy as \"Breaking the Law\", if considering that not only metalheads made of the latter such a popular track.\n\nWhereas Screaming has a more simple sound, Defenders seems to trade catchiness for a speedy, more technical oriented music, featuring the well-known qualities of their 1970's stuff (e.g., guitar driven songs that feature incredible neoclassical guitar solos and harsh riffs) and some other characteristics of the NWOBHM, such as bassy drums and speed metal stuff. This formula results in very solid songs and quite elaborated compositions that are very engaging and interesting for the listener. Moreover, Halford's haunting vocal performance provides to the songs a touch of madness and aggressiveness that make them unique.\n\nThe true musical ability of the band is heavily exploited and displayed in the first side of the album in which they tried to put their heaviest and most poisonous stuff. As mentioned above, they try to live up the NWOBHM to the extent possible, and while the twin-guitar mainly played in their 70's albums is present, they also include NWOBHM riffs like the ones played in Def Leppard's earliest stuff. Thus, all those who know the sound of songs like \"Stagefright\" could easily figure out how \"Jawbreaker\" sounds like, even though the latter is an enhanced version of the former. Furthermore, the crazy speedish drums played Dave Holland end up sounding alike to the ones played by Rick Allen, even in the frenetic speed metal song \"Freewheel Burning\" which is the album's glorious opening track that recalls the spirit of the freeway madness. \n\nUnlikely, \"Rock Hard Ride Free\" is a softer song that can be compared to Def Leppard song \"On Through the Night\", mainly due to its melodic riffs (Helloween took notes from here and that is how they made \"I Want Out\"). On the other hand, the second half is full of mid-paced songs that provide a happier vibe to the album, and it is less based on Def Leppard's stuff. The songs herein kept in a certain way the sound of the preceding album, as they are somehow glammy, being \"Some Heads are Gonna Roll\" a good example. However, they refuse to stop playing speedish stuff, like the polemic alleged speed metal ode to oral sex \"Eat Me Alive\" which sounds like a mix of the opening track with some glammy elements of Screaming. \n\nThat said, the album definitely passed the test of time, and after 32 years of its release date, it remains as one of the best metal releases of all times. A necessary album for those who are interested in the genesis of power metal and the agony of the NWOBHM, which took place in the middle of the 80's. Thereafter, the band had serious difficulties finding a new sound and adapting to the constant changes that heavy metal experimented, either for good or for bad, which were mainly derived from the aforementioned decay of the NWOBHM.\n",
        "\nJudas Priest walks into the major leagues with their second LP Sad Wings of Destiny. After the semi-psychedelic, but highly underrated Rocka Rolla, Priest tighten up their songwriting a little bit, and push the psychedelia further into the background and bring the metal. Unsatisfied with the production of their debut LP, they were decidedly more involved in their second album. The sound quality is a big step up, though because it was released independently it spawned many cheap fly by night reissues like the first album. Though the Repertoire Records was the best CD version of Rocka Rolla, your best bet is to get the Line Records version and add on some treble as it's a very flat sounding CD. The RCA is a little bass heavy, but it's good as well. Overall the production is a step in the right direction with less tape hiss and a better track selection. Rodger Bain forced them to leave off \"Victim of Changes\", getting rid of him was the right decision, though I'm glad he did because it opening this album is right where it belongs. Though there is some controversy about reversed sides and that Prelude should actually start this one, my RCA CD started with \"Victim of Changes\", and that is the only way I'll listen to it.\n\nThe band takes a huge step up in the songwriting department on this album. Whereas most of the Rocka Rolla material was written before Glenn Tipton was in the band, he has a writing credit on all nine songs on this one. As the best writer in the band, the material is noticeably more focused and just better. While Rocka Rolla was underrated and had a couple of great tunes and mostly just good ones, every song on this album is a classic. \"Victim of Changes\" and \"The Ripper\" is the greatest opening one-two punch in all of heavy metal, and \"Victim of Changes\" is likely the best Priest song ever recorded. It contains all the trademarks. Opening with a twin guitar attack it moves into a rather slow bluesy number with an infectious riff and Rob Halford's godlike shriek. The song builds and builds and then breaks down and you get to hear Halford's underrated lower register. The song builds up again with Halford singing \"changes\" with growing intensity until the song kicks back into gear heavier than ever with a Halford scream, ending in another that by the ending leaves you thinking \"what the fuck did I just hear\". \"The Ripper\" is the perfect follow up to this epic as it is short and to the point. It's a nice dramatic song about Jack the Ripper featuring great guitar work and some jaw dropping vocal work from Halford. \n\n\"Dreamer Deceiver\" is a psychedelic ballad that is the greatest showcase of Rob Halford's vocal range on any LP. It along with the superb \"Epitaph\" are the two albums ballads. For a band not at all known for ballads, they're sure damn good at writing them. The rest of the album offers some mid-paced to fast metal tunes with lyrics that have not reached the cheesiness that they started to with Killing Machine. They're mysterious and actually have social commentary on \"Genocide\", and about the discrimination Halford felt as a homosexual in \"Island of Domination\".\n\nConcise tunes such as \"Tyrant\", \"Deceiver\", \"Genocide\", and \"Island of Domination\" had a profound influence on the music of the '80s, and solidifies Judas Priest as the single most important influence on heavy metal in the future. Twin guitar attack, tight and catchy riffs, concise running time, killer vocalists, and blistering guitar solos. Sad Wings of Destiny is their definitive LP, as it shows these traits in fully realized form for the first time, and also the best time.\n",
        "\nJudas Priest has made music all-over the map in terms of style. Throughout their long career, they have consistently produced albums that effectively reflected the shade of the metal scene at the time of their release. They've done it all: psychedelic (Sad Wings of Destiny, Sin after Sin) glam (Turbo, Ram it Down) and straight 4/4 heavy metal (British Steel, everything else). \n\nAfter 4-years of 80's glamdom, and enough synth to make you wanna piss in a mason jar and dump it out of a skyscraper, they made a complete 180 degree turn with Painkiller (1990). With its disgustingly cheesy lyrics, smokin' Tipton/Downing leads, and Halford's operatic accordian-bladders for lungs, it makes for a very unique power-metal record. \n\nScott Travis makes a beautiful maiden voyage with Priest with the drum-intro and double-bass bushwhacking he delivers on the title-track. Tipton and Downing gouge out the mid with snarling riffs and leads, as Halford soars 2 octaves over everybody. Once again, the title-track is a scorcher that is about to become your sing-along staple. \"All Guns Blazing\" opens violently: leading into the scorching double-bass anthem of \"Leather Rebel\". The rest of the album doesn't stray too far from this path. The bass guitar, like most metal that came out between 1987 and 1991, is barely audible, leaving you with some good ol' mid-range noise fatigue. Can you handle it? Of course you can, because you are a jelly-brained metal-listener. \n\n\"Between the Hammer and the Anvil\" is a throaty-epic with surprisingly great-lyrics and some of my all-time favorite vocals from Rob Halford. \"A Touch of Evil\" also stands out from the rest of the album with its bruising, synthy riff, and Rob's raspy voice dripping with lust. \n\nThis album is cheesy as fuck, and that is part of what makes it so enjoyable. The lyrics, as a whole, sound like they were ripped out of an elementary-school poetry compilation. The \"Night Crawler\", as described, would make a fine villain in Sesame Street. The Painkiller, who I assume to be the studly dude on the cover art, starts off as \"faster than a bullet\", and two verses later: Voila! He is now faster than a LASER bullet! Mixed with Rob's utterly ridiculous falsetto, the compulsion to sing-along is gosh-darn irresistible. I can only imagine the engineer sitting down to record this album: \"What's the game plan Rob?' \"TREBLE. Treble is the game plan.\"\n\nThis is one of the most fun-to-listen-to metal albums I have ever heard. \n\nHighlights:\nPainkiller, All Guns Blazing, Leather Rebel, Between the Hammer and the Anvil, Touch of Evil. \n\nLowlights:\nMetal Meltdown, Night Crawler\n\nPairs well with:\nIntoxication and Karaoke\n",
        "\nAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! says the metal god, and I concur! For this mess of headbanging metal can only be addressed and reacted to by a scream. The strange period of Judas Priest releasing radio-friendly metal and roaring heavy fucking metal on the same albums, Defenders of the Faith and Screaming For Vengeance being the heaviest and Turbo and Point of Entry being.. well.. catchy? More on that on those reviews, Ram It Down is the focus, and they try certainly try to justify the title by shoving both the heavy and friendly into one album intended to be a second on a double album. Twin Turbos may have changed the whole perspective on Turbo (considered the sellout album of Priest) and Ram It Down (the album before the masterpiece) since they would have balanced each other. But Ram It Down feels like they tried to go in the direction of Painkiller, while keeping the synths in the mix, and god it's so catchy and heavy at the same time somehow! \n\nNow this album to me is special because it shows Priest want to be taken seriously again and they show it very well for the most part, Glenn and K.K. unrelenting in their dual guitar onslaught, Halford tearing his seventies incarnation roaring into the late eighties with banshee cries only he can create, Ian thumping away with his simple but perfectly matching bass licks working with the guitars and.. drum machine.. oh god.. Dave wasn't ever my favourite drummer from Priest but this is awful.. He could play a beat, he could keep and change tempo, he did justice to the albums and songs he was on and deserved better than to be credited on an album where a machine butchers his beats like a fat ugly hog. The machine does well enough, but it just sounds so lifeless. I'll try to keep from freaking about the drums through this review and focus on the fact that this album is an evolution and return to form that would show they know all too well how to move forward with their sound with passion instead of marketing.\n\nThe opener/title track gives you a good idea of what to expect from there on out, pulsating metal that's either uptempo and heavy or really fucking happy as shown in the middle of the song. While the Turbo amounts of cheesiness are still here for the bridge, this whole song is a sure sign of what's to come on the next album and starts the album off with a bang. Halford's scream starting off the track gives me chills every time, with how well the guitars chime in and drum machine starts blasting it is one of Judas Priest's finest tracks ever created in my opinion (It just needs real drums!) It personifies metal in every sense, chanting on about decibels no doubt the band would reach and one up on the consecutive tour but acknowledging the guitars in metal scream as much as the singers and it only solidifies this anthem and when they cheerfully ask me to shout it out midway through I gladly oblige, especially since Halford refuses to use his lower octaves through the majority of the song. But I really don't care god damn I love me some metal god screams! Halford really belts it out at incredibly high notes through most of the album. He relents to use a sort of \"Come on everybody let's rock!\" style when not wailing, and he seems to shine the most for me in Blood Red Skies, his screams thrown into the mid-tempo chanting anthems like Love Zone, Come And Get It, Heavy Metal and I'm A Rocker (Which lyrically seems to sound like they all want to do what they want and no one is gonna stop them, ironically what Halford does shortly after Painkiller) really do fit perfectly but man nothing for me can top Rob Halford's greatest moment on vocals. Blood Red Skies is nothing but passion and power. The acoustic rendition of The Hellion urging him to soar which he certainly does once he gets the chance and doesn't stop till the drum machine(the only song where the drum machine works almost as good as real kit could have), haunting guitar leads and thrum of the bass guitar fade with his cries, leaving Halford's shining moment forever ingrained into my mind. \n\nPounding drums actually are a staple of this album even though fabricated throughout the majority of the album, but it works very well in making Ram It Down, and Hard As Iron feel like they should have been on Painkiller. I may have bashed them but at the same time, it seems to work well with the synthesized guitar parts when they rear their automated heads. The ridiculous sound of the drums and synths may be annoying but with the level of happy go lucky they induce, the inclusion of their hilarious cover of Johnny B Goode doesn't even phase me, as it is two hundred more times catchy that good old Chuck could have ever made and I don't mean to dwell on the Metal God so much this album but damn does he go nuts with screams on this song and it fits perfectly!\n\nWhile this album is cheesy in some moments and a bit frightening at times, Monsters of Rock being an extended version of the horrifying segment in Night Crawler and the whip crack at the beginning of Love You to Death drives home a darker side to the leather look I choose not to delve into, Glenn and K.K. really show they know how to shred and make true heavy metal riffs that accompany Ian on his journey to disappear and yet always be noticed in each song written by Judas Priest (his bass-work actually being more prominent on here than usual). The songs are solid and even the live bonus tracks really shine as grade A performances of songs not heard in their live repertoire often, with Halford showing his pipes again and the dual leads showing their shredding capabilities. Ram It Down shines as a bridge (with manufactured parts) that stands on its own but really gives us a great taste of the speed metal shred fest up next. They show happiness and heaviness go hand in hand, even though they ditch the happy one album later, and it makes for one of my favourite Judas Priest outings.\n\nApologies for being such a huge fanboy throughout this. Rob Halford is my idol as a vocalist and all time favorite singer with Judas Priest being my favorite heavy metal band of all time and my first coincidentally. So for just for a hint of negativity, the flow of the album is kinda wonky from time to time, switching from speed metal to rock anthems a couple too many times, thus the 85% rating. It could have been at least 92% if structured better and had real fucking drums!\n",
        "\nI have to start somewhere and 'Angel of Retribution' album was chosen as a subject for my first ever Judas Priest review. The album is a very important piece in the band's history: The classic formation was back together again, as singer Rob Halford had returned to the line-up in 2003 (Tim \"Ripper\" Owens sang on 2 albums), and it is the first ever number one on record sales lists (in Greece) anywhere.\n\nThe cover shows an angel (of retribution), but music-wise this album didn't go as far into the past. I feel this revisits 'Painkiller' era (1990) quite a bit. This is evident from the beginning, as 'Judas Rising' is conjured with tapping guitar and banshee screaming when it explodes into marching double kick drumming, courtesy of Scott Travis, and tight riffing with Halford's commanding vocals. The solos... I think I do not have to say more about one of the most respected guitar duos in history, do I?! A magnificent Black Country metal opener! The album's rocking pieces follow with 'Deal with the Devil' and 'Revolution', of which the formed is more powerful and head-bangable, plus we get the twin guitar harmonies from K.K. Downing and Glenn Tipton, while the latter is the album's most US-sounding piece; a tad too laid-back, bringing something like Slash's or ZZ Top's material to my mind, but good at that.\n\nContrary to my expectations, the album's first softer song is up next, 'Worth Fighting for'. However, a song that is softer music and playing-wise is harder on emotional level. Actually, it's absolutely affecting song, yet with strong pulsing beat, where Ian Hill's bass guitar simply slays. Halford's vocals and guitar lines really capture soul's woe, but there's always something worth fighting for... \"The painkiller rises again...\" on 'Demonizer, and again that means tough metal forged in the mills of Black Country. Dramatic and exorcising, double bass drum driven injects molten metal in listener's veins, and does it with style. 'Wheel s of Fire' is a rolling US-vibe heavy metal song, but it does not reach that streak it was meant to do. Hmmm, another US style song, that happens to be my least favourite here...\n\n'Angel' is a ballad, that doesn't choke a listener with too much honey, while it is one of the more beautiful songs I've ever heard. It actually is touching, but not annoyingly sticky. Starting acoustically, the song catches beat in its midpoint, but do not wait for firey guitar solos, please! 'Hellrider' isn't a ballad, as you might've already figured out, but another 'Painkiller'-ish metal mayhem. There's even some classical-inspired guitar work in the solo part. The chorus is another hymnal/horror piece. Fantastic! Talking about hymns, 'Eulogy' is one gloomy song. A bass guitar, piano (plus some synthesizers) and Halford make magic happen.\n\nThe album ends with huge 'Lochness'. It's a slower song, which has doomy atmosphere going on. Nothing too typical JP here, but more like a nod towards Black Sabbath. Starting with moody sounds bringing images of Scottish nature to mind, and then weird sounds depicting the monster, the song contains sturdy heavy metal riffs and rhythm section. Awesome vocals lines culminate to hymnic chorus. Solo parts liven up the song in drastic places. This was the first song I heard from this album on a radio, and it grabbed me hard. I believe this didn't happen to many a people, because the song is so ostracise. I love the song; it is a giant, yet it flows beautifully, and is so atmospheric.\n\nSome things do not happen as much as wanted: Halford's singing is more on lower notes now (understandably with ageing), despite a few shrieks/high vocals, and twin guitar harmonies could have been more frequent. These aren't real complaints. Only those songs with US-vibe are, but still the songs are okay at least. If you want another negative remark, it's about ugly booklet artwork and layout (NOT about the cover art).\n\nProduced by the band with Roy Z (Tribe of Gypsies, Bruce Dickinson, Rob Rock etc.), the album sounds great. It is powerful, it resonates, it is clear and nicely balanced. Plus, there's no preset recording adjustments, of course. It's a \"picture\" of its time, as there is no 1980s synthesizer influences. Performances are top-notch, as expected, nothing weak or \"thereabouts\". Even if Mr. Halford isn't screaming out his bollocks, he's got thew. The lyrics are METAL: Horror and monster stories, band and music itself, with some more moving texts.\n\nDamn this album is good! If you happen to enjoy Judas Priest even a bit, then give this one a go. It was such a strong \"comeback\". Actually it might need more then a go, so why not give it some time, okay? It is worth fig... I mean, it is worth that much.\n\n(Originally written for ArchaicMetallurgy.com)\n",
        "\nThere are few albums out there that combine musicianship, creativity, great songwriting, and raw talent in such a way as Sad Wings of Destiny does. This album made a huge impact on heavy metal and remains one of the genres greatest works. Black Sabbath were doing their thing experimenting with the beast they created, and then Judas Priest came along with this masterpiece and completely refined the genre. This album takes the blues-inspired riffing and song structures that had been a part of earlier heavy metal and injects it with a healthy dosage of speed, power, and aggression. \n\nSad Wings of Destiny has a very unique and diverse set of songs. From the bluesy yet heavy \"Victim of Changes\" to the fast and powerful \"Tyrant\", Sad wings has a lot of different material to offer. All of the tracks, with the exception of the prelude, \"Dreamer Deceiver\", and \"Epitaph\", are Mid-tempo to fast and are all heavy and powerful, especially for their time (1976!). Along with the unmistakable heavy metal vibe the album has, there is a progressive element that is actually quite evident. If you look at the awesome \"Tyrant\", there is a lot of different riffs and uniquely arranged chord progressions present. Not even the solos have a similar riff backing them, each solo section has its own unique rhythm supporting it. This is also quite evident in \"Island of Domination\" and especially \"The Ripper\". \"The Ripper\" is very oddly arranged, yet it works extremely well, and is actually a fan-favorite, and a favorite of mine. The main riff to \"The Ripper\" is really wicked sounding and it fits the subject matter perfectly, well, its not really a \"riff\", more of a quick set of notes. Call it a riff or not, it's awesome, and it really shows the true songwriting talent that Judas Priest possessed. I could go more in depth into the songs to try to prove my point on how good they are, but I don't have to, as each song and the album especially as a whole prove themselves. The album is supposed to start with \"Prelude\" and go to \"Island of Domination\", then play the rest of the songs, but the miserable record company screwed up the sides on the original vinyls apparently, so most of the CD's and a bunch of the vinyls have this error as well. Whether you care or not is up to you, but I recommend listening with Prelude, Tyrant, Genocide and so on, but its not that big of a deal. From start to finish Sad Wings is a listening experience that never gets old. \n\nThe musicianship on here is absolutely spectacular. This was the dawn of twin-lead guitar playing, with KK and Glenn storming through each riff and solo with a dual axe driven fury that was unmatched at the time. The guitar playing is absolutely top notch, the riffs (which in some places are pretty complex) and the solos are mindblowingly cool. What is also really impressive is when the album enters a softer or creepier section, the guitars match the mood of the section, which adds to the awesomeness of the song. Go listen to the middle part of \"The Ripper\", the buildup part of \"Genocide\" or the slow, relaxed part of \"Victim of Changes\" to see what I mean. Do I even have to mention Rob effing Halford? Definitely in the top 5 metal vocalists of all time. In my opinion this is actually Rob's best performance, I like his vocals here just a *tad* bit more than I do on Stained Class, although I do like that album a *tad* more than this one. My reasoning behind this is that he delivers some stunningly beautiful vocal passages on some of these tracks, such as on \"Dreamer Deceiver\", \"Epitaph\", and of course the middle section from \"Victim of Changes\". Not to take anything away from his singing on the heavier tracks, because it is amazing as well, unrivaled actually, but his soft singing back to back with his soaring highs is just icing on the cake. I think this is Ian Hill's best performance out of his entire tenure with the band. You not only can actually hear him, but his basslines are very creative and sometimes very awesome. The bass backing \"Deceiver\" is very awesome, even if you don't immediately notice that the bass is actually in a higher octave than the guitar. The bassline to \"Tyrant\" is the greatest one he has ever played and it shows that if he really wants to, Ian can jam. Playing along side Ian is Alan Moore on the drums, who has a very good performance here, it's not spectacular but for its time this was great, and it actually still is. The production on here is the best as possible for back then, everything is clear and crisp sounding, but due to its age, it has a distinct punch and crunch, a sound I love to hear so much that only these old heavy metal albums can offer. \n\nOverall, Sad Wings of Destiny is an absolute classic, not just in heavy metal terms, but for music in general. This album has stood the test of time for a very long time now, and it still stands as one of the greatest heavy metal albums ever. I never get sick of this masterpiece, and honestly Judas Priest only matched this with Stained Class. I definitely recommend this to all rock music and heavy metal fans, this should be a staple of every heavy metal fan's collection. If you are very new to heavy metal, check this album out if you haven't already, it will blow you away. Sad Wings of Destiny is a frighteningly good album that is, from start to finish, as close to flawless as possible.\n",
        "\nJudas Priest's Painkiller is one of the best comeback albums in metal history. It takes the speed/power metal of the previous album, Ram it Down, and combines it with the thrash metal style of bands like Metallica and Megadeth to create one of the greatest speed metal albums of all time.\n\nThe easiest way to describe Painkiller is as an intense speed metal shredfest. The opener/title track is a shredfest both guitar wise and drum wise, with its legendary drum intro, and it's unforgettable guitar solo. \"Metal Meltdown\", a metal anthem, opens with a dual guitar shredding solo, and then leads into some brutal riffing with almost thrash metal like intensity. This is how a lot of Painkiller is. The aggression here has increased by a great deal. Ram it Down and its predecessors were more melodic, and a bit softer. Painkiller is a fairly melodic album, it sounds more aggressive, and less like power metal. Glen Tipton and K.K Downing can shred like crazy. Both of them can do sweep picking as well as all out shredding, heard on songs such as the title track.\n\nWhile Judas Priest have always embodied metal and its stereotypes, Painkiller shows a whole new level of metal embodiment. The title track may or may not be a metal anthem. \"Metal Meltdown\" is about Judas Priest's music itself. It is almost like they were thinking \"Let's see how metal we can be.\"This is part of what makes Painkiller such a great album- it's pure metalness.\n\nRob Halford's vocals have gone to a whole new level as well. His range is unbelievable. His extremely high screams at the end of the title track sound almost like the high notes of a guitar. \"All Guns Blazing\", a title that perfectly describes the track, may freak the listener out with its high screaming intro that is very fun to hear. Lower vocals are used with just as much proficiency as the high vocals. The epic \"Hell Patrol\" features a more traditional Halford low vocal style. \"Leather Rebel\", on of the best songs on Painkiller, also has excellent lower vocals.\n\nWhile Judas Priest did go very slightly glam metal with the Turbo album, Painkiller shows almost no traces of glam. The one trace of glam is the guitar and synthesizer ballad \"A Touch of Evil\". It isn't overtly glam metal sounding, but it heals just the right amount of glam. It is definitely one of the best power ballads of all time. It is unforgettable catchy, and it also features some great vocals, both low singing, and high screaming.\n\nJudas Priest have stolen quite a few elements from thrash metal here. Painkiller is not a thrash metal album, that title would be a more apt description for the next Judas Priest album, Jugulator. Painkiller is more of a melodic speed metal album. However, a lot of the riffs, most notable \"Metal Meltdown\" are in a fast, thrash metal chug style. Both \"All Guns Blazing\" and \"Metal Meltdown\" have thrash metal style \"mosh breakdowns\" in the middle, which are some of the heaviest things written by Judas Priest.\n\nPower metal also comes to mind when thinking about the influences on Painkiller. It takes the early power metal of Accept and Metal Church, and yes, early Judas Priest themselves, and adds an \"epic\" feel to it, making it one of the first \"epic type records\". \"Leather Rebel\" is a very melodic song with a catchy, sing along chorus. So, while Painkiller was influenced by power metal, it is also one of the biggest influences on the genre.\n\nThe drumming on Painkiller is the best drumming of any Judas Priest album. Scott Travis provides extremely fast rhythms, fills, and other interesting things. \"Painkiller\" has its legendary drum intro. \"Metal Meltdown\" has some of the greatest drumming ever heard in metal. Scott Travis is like a machine behind the drums. And not in the way of the drum machine controversially used on Ram it Down. I'm talking about his immense level of technical skill.\n\nThe album ends with the slower song, \"Living Bad Dreams\". It is not really a power ballad in the sense of \"A Touch of Evil\", but it is \"ballad like\". Still, it is much closer to an epic, with its powerful lyrics and delivery.\n\nPainkiller is Judas Priest at their most powerful. The lyrics are almost as good as Ronnie James Dio's lyrics. They are deep and emotional, and could mean various things, as they use a great deal of symbolism. The melodic delivery on the vocals gives them even more power. Simply put, Painkiller is Judas Priest's best album, and on greatest metal albums ever to be released. The album should be enough to tell you that this is required listening for any metalhead.\n",
        "\nHere we go boys, Stained effing Class! This album is by far one of the greatest metal albums of all time. I first heard this when I was just getting into heavy metal and I still listen to it all the time, and it does not, and will not get old. From the blazing riffing of \"Exciter\" to the bad ass, sassy verses of \"Heroes End\" this record is pretty much as close to perfect as possible. There is not a bland moment on here, each song is completely unique and they all are ridiculously awesome. The entire band is firing on all cylinders, with KK and Glenn playing some of the coolest licks in the JP catalogue and Rob blowing your mind with his insane vocals. Stained Class was the first with my favorite of the Priest drummers, Les Binks, and he is outstanding on here. Ian Hill is not the type of bassist to come out of his shell much, but all of his playing here is adept and tasteful, and his playing supports everything superbly. Everything on here is absolutely spectacular. \n\nThe songs on here are all magnificent. The tracks are all very diverse and each of them are quite unique in their own way; even though they possess this trait, they all sound like they belong together. Each of the songs flow seamlessly with each other, which makes letting the entire record play a joy. I don't ever skip anything from Stained Class, everything is just awesome. The production is obviously going to sound a bit dated (It's from 1978), but it still sounds very clear and everything sounds great. Some people will say that the guitars sound a bit weak due to the old recording equipment; which is completely valid, you might share this opinion, but I think they still sound bad ass. There are some slower songs like \"Beyond the Realms of Death\", \"Savage\" and \"Better by you, Better Than Me\", but none of them are ever too slow paced, and never boring. Especially \"Beyond the Realms of Death\", which is one of the highlights of the album, it's a rather sad song, with lovely acoustic passages and brilliantly sung lyrics, and then it explodes in your face with that super epic chorus kicked off with robs awesome \"YEAH!! I've left the world behind!\". The song also has some wicked soloing, and for its time, that soloing was downright insane (heck it still is). \n\nThe rest of the album adheres to a much quicker pace, and sometimes kicks into overdrive (Saints in Hell), and lets not forget that legendary opener: Exciter! \"Exciter\" is probably one of the best album openers ever. This song is just insane, you really have to hear it to know what I mean. A song this fast and heavy in 1978 was just unheard of, and it was a real game changer. It is blazing fast, with wicked drums and riffing, it has awesome lyrics (I love the thermal lance part so much) and spectacular solos. I could try to name the standout tracks, but it's kind of pointless, as everything is really that freaking good. I've known fans of this album to have different favorites than I do from Stained Class, but in my personal opinion, the best are the title track, \"Invader\", \"Saints in Hell\", and \"Beyond the Realms of Death\"\n\nThe instrumentation is, as always with Judas Priest, masterful. The riffs, the solos, the vocals, the rhythm section, all epic. The riffs on the album have a very cool style to them. This was the era of Priest where they were progressing further and further, and developing heavy metal. They were still transitioning from their more bluesy sound and getting more complex and heavy, as a result the riffs and licks all have a groovy touch to them, while still being pretty hardcore. The result is a bunch of very creative riffs (See \"White Heat, Red Hot\" or \"Saints in Hell\"). The soloing is top notch (it's KK and Glenn, so that goes without saying), in some cases they can be super fast, but as with the riffs, they all have this awesome groovy touch to them. My favorite solos on Stained Class are the ones from the title track (the part at around 3:40 into the song is killer, especially how it transitions back into the verse) and from \"Invader\". Also, Stained Class is my favorite album for Rob, his singing is so awesome on here. I think it was around here where he really mastered the use of his super high pitched side, as in some cases he sings entire verses with it (See the title track). \n\nThe rhythm section is awesome too, as I said, Les Binks rules. His drumming is top notch and he does not have a weak part any where on here. The same goes for Ian's bass lines, he has always been the type to play whatever benefits the song as a whole, and he never really showed off any. His bass tone is actually pretty awesome, with a mean growly low to it, you might not notice it at first, but it is actually him that contributes a ton to the super heavy sound of the record. All in all, this is Judas Priest firing on all cylinders and I think this is their greatest achievement (Sad Wings is a close second for me, although a lot of people like that one more). The songwriting is absolutely fantastic, you can just read the lyrics to this stuff and be amazed at the gravity to what they were writing. Another thing I would like to point out is how well everything is done when it comes to not just the lyrics, but how they are sung. For instance, to sing a line like, \"Transfixed at deliverance, is this all there is? Faithless continuum, into the abyss.\" When you hear how the song is structured, it's really amazing how such intricate lyrics can be sung effectively, that alone is no easy task, and they pull it off flawlessly. \n\nStained Class is truly one of greatest achievements of not just heavy metal, but rock music in general. The sheer combination of talent, skill, art, and class (no pun intended) make for what is undoubtedly one of the greatest albums of all time. Each and every track is outstanding, heck even the artwork is badass. I would recommend this to anybody who likes good music, and this should be a staple of any heavy metal fan's collection. There is a reason why my username on everything is named after this album, it's just that great.\n",
        "\nAfter the not so great Nostradamus that was released in 2008, Priest fans were wondering what was going to happen next to the band. Judas Priest tried experimenting in the last album, were they going to drift more to that sound? Or return to the more straightforward sound fans have known Priest to have? Sure enough, they came back to release a powerful new album as aging rockers. Sure, it isn't Painkiller or Screaming for Vengeance where Halford is waling into the microphone, but it is him giving it his all for an almost 65 year old man. \n\nThe one thing that may take Priest fans to get use to with this album is the production. It is not the best production in the world but it isn't terrible either. It's simply \"good\". The drums at times seem to be a little overpowered. However, it does at times make the song seem a little more grand, especially in Halls of Valhalla. Another thing that is notable in this album is the absence of long time guitarist of the band, K. K. Downing. Replacing him is Richie Faulkner, who surprisingly makes the band sound a bit younger again with some very energetic and memorable guitar solos; especially in Halls of Valhalla after Rob screams towards the end of the song. Who wouldn't want to shred that fast on a guitar after hearing that? \n\nThe songs themselves are pretty good for the most part throughout the album. The album starts off with the killer Dragonaut which sounds like classic Judas Priest. The killer guitar riffs, the evil lyrics and the tight playing. Judas Priest continues to change up the way the sound on this album digging into a little bit of what I would call power metal on songs like Halls of Valhalla and Swords of Damocles. Very heavy songs with lyrics about triumph and victory. Towards the middle of the album, the band goes back in time with songs that sound as if they were either out of Killing Machine or British Steel but with a heavier production. However at times, it can drag a little bit. Richie adds some twists in the band's sound with songs like Crossfire, which as a very similar intro compared to Black Sabbath's 'I\". The album picks up speed and aggression vocally and instrumentally on Battle Cry that has a very Painkiller like vibe to it. The last song is another Priest Ballad, which is one of the better ballads that Priest has done. \n\nFor a band this old and with all the things that they have gone through, this is an album that does not disappoint. It's not an album to be taken seriously but it's an album to head bang too and to have a good time with. Of course, it has its flaws as do most albums but that will not stop me from listening to this again. It makes Iron Maiden's new album \"Book of Souls\", look like it was made by by dying old men.\n",
        "\nIn 1977 Judas Priest released their third full-length album entitled 'Sin After Sin'. For me, this is the perfect follow up to their second release 'Sad Wings of Destiny'. This is when the almighty metal gods found their 'formula'. What do I mean by this? By this, I mean their cohesive ability to write songs to their full capacity and in their own unique style. This 'formula' which I speak of is very apparent in their previous full-length release but not completely consistent yet. This album shows their experience kicking in and as a by-product of this they found the freedom to write a consolidated album in which I find myself in awe with every play. No matter how many times I listen to this gem I simply cannot get enough.\n\nNo other album opener from the top of my head can impact me so such as the 'Sinner' song found on this record. As soon as you are blasting this opener you know you're head banging! My favourite part in this song would definitely have to be the middle break down part. Just listen to the intensity of those guitar squeals! Yes, this album starts off with a right screamer. The album just flows nicely from here. Up next is a beautifully recorded cover of Joan Baez. Rob Halford continues to show just what a great vocalist he is by showcasing his huge vocal range. \n\nWhat you will realise with this release of Judas Priest is the fact that it has everything on offer. If you want a faster paced belter then you have songs like 'Sinner', 'Let Us Pray', 'Dissident Aggressor' and if you want a slow paced ballad then you've got songs like 'Diamonds and Rust', 'Last Rose of Summer' and 'Here Comes the Pain'. The album will literally take you on a journey bringing you up and taking you back down to earth at those most crucial moments. There are also a couple of mid-paced songs which are great too, 'Starbreaker' and 'Raw Deal'. As you know Judas Priest love to harmonize their melodies and riffs and this album doesn't lack in that department. Sweet harmonisations followed by crushing riffs (just listen to Sinner for a slice of this action). If we move on to the musicians you will find Simon Phillips on the drums. I thought he provided a great performance. Bass on the album is audible and good but that's about as far as I'll take that. The best performers as always come from the guitarists (Tipton and Downing) and vocalist Rob Halford. \n\n'Sin After Sin' is definitely a must need for all heavy metal maniacs out there. This is simply an inspiring and very enjoyable album to listen to. I believe it deserves to be in every metal fans music collection and that goes for anyone who's into the more extreme side of metal because quite frankly without bands like Judas Priest raising the bar with such albums like this I seriously don't know how metal would have evolved. \n\nMy personal opinion tells me for the worse!\n",
        "\nAnd this isn't a beginning of a joke. These five men happen to be Judas Priest and together they recorded these two heavy metal classics. This promotional single off of 1977's \"Sin After Sin\" features two Judas Priest tracks, and was the perfect choice for a promotional single.\n\nSide A features \"Dissident Aggressor,\" which could be perceived as a forerunner to thrash metal (Slayer mentioned Judas Priest as one of their key influences and even covered this track), as it features some very tight palm muted riffing by KK Downing and Glenn Tipton, double bass drumming (a thing not seen again until Accept's \"Fast As a Shark\") and the last but not least, Rob Halford's vocals. As the atmosphere of the track settles down, Halford unleashes a banshee scream that even King Diamond couldn't handle by himself. His vocal range is far beyond any vocal range in metal, and plays a crucial part in the entire Judas Priest discography, especially around this period. The riffs solos here are also worth mentioning, as they are traded between Downing and Tipton and feature 16th notes, which is another renovation Judas Priest featured and used until today in every genre of metal.\n\nSide B features \"Diamonds and Rust,\" a cover of a folk rock song by Joan Baez. This version has no folk characteristics, but it still gives respect to the original version. The guitar parts are altered to fit the atmosphere of \"Sin After Sin\", as they were sped up and distorted. They accompany the tight drumming that is heard throughout the album, and last but not least Rob's mesmerizing vocal delivery, which is the most notable thing this single features.\n\nThis single shows perfect musicianship, great lyrics and an overall perfect performance of two perfect songs. Mandatory for any metal fan.\n",
        "\nI think it's fair to say that Judas Priest simply doesn't owe us anything anymore. For over 40 years these brave lads from Birmingham have delivered heavy metal in its purest form, and still they've never been afraid to experiment and change things around a bit from time to time. They already provided us a fair amount of great records, so I tend to be very charitable about their most recent input to heavy metal music. I mean, if there's anyone who can make a living out of former glories, the guys from Judas Priest should top the list, right? So please forgive me if I'm about to write a sympathetic review to \"Redeemer of Souls\", because I just think they deserve it, really. And not only because, you know, they're Judas Priest - but also because \"Redeemer of Souls\" is a good album. Maybe not a fantastic CD, but surely a nice enough one.\n\nThings changed a bit since \"Nostradamus\", the (somewhat ill-fated) attempt to create a 2-CD epic that (unfortunately) never materialized upon a stage. K.K. Downing is no longer there, being replaced by Richie Faulkner - a change that may reek of sheer betrayal for more die-hard fans, but seems to have been adequate in musical terms at least. New man Richie does a commendable job here, trying to fill K.K's shoes with dignity while adding a few touches of his own. I hope no one will want to hang me for this, but sometimes you can hardly remember it's a new guitarist playing the riffs and leads there. Of course the presence of Glenn Tipton is the best guidance a newcomer could ever have, and Faulkner assumes a very respectful position towards Downing's legacy most of the time - sometimes he actually seems to be emulating the legendary guitarist note by note, which I take as a sign of respect more than anything else. But he's also not afraid to roll up his sleeves and show a few nice tricks of his own, especially in the solos department, which is a good stance when you have such a life-changing chance like this one. Well done, mister.\n\nAnother perceivable change comes in Rob Halford's voice. Age sure took its toll, and the memorable high-pitched screams and shrieks are forever gone for him. But is it a real problem? I sincerely don't think so: he's no longer screaming like a beast, true, but his presence and confidence are still impressive and working for great effect most of the time. Yeah, maybe Halford will never nail \"Painkiller\" live ever again, but he still can deliver the goods (sorry) in less demanding songs, keeping his dignity pretty much intact throughout this new CD. Sometimes his performance is even reassuring, as he leaves no room for mistakes: he is still the Metal God, and no one can beat him in his game.\n\nAnd what about the music, you ask me? Well, it's sure a departure from the overblown \"Nostradamus\", and it's also different from \"Angel of Retribution\" - an album that, let's be point-blank honest, was an uneven listening experience all around. \"Redeemer of Souls\" is classic Metal in very direct, sometimes almost stripped-down terms, with 13 songs that revisit almost every avenue Judas Priest ever crossed with a confident, yet very down-to-earth approach. It's heavy metal as the masters forged it decades ago, no regrets and no room for mistakes. The opening tune \"Dragonaut\" is almost heavy-metal-for-dummies, in a good way: opens with sounds of thunder, then a ultra-typical metal riff and Rob Halford singing \"Welcome to my world of steel\"! If you don't get it, pal, then I'm afraid metal is really not your cup of tea.\n\nThe songs are mostly good, sometimes even bordering on brilliant, although you won't get any mind-blowing attack like \"Hellrider\" (the best song Judas Priest wrote since Halford's return IMO). My personal favorites would be \"Sword of Damocles\" (excellent guitar work), \"Down in Flames\" (almost hard rock but quite memorable), \"Halls of Valhalla\" (somewhat cheesy lyrics, but excellent twists and turns), \"Battle Cry\" (good old-fashioned headbanging here, and also the closer you'll get to hear Halford actually screaming his lungs out) and \"Hell & Back\" (a more contemplative, yet heavy tune with a commanding rhythm section). The title-track is also good, but much of its thunder is stolen as soon as you realize it recycles the exact formula of old classic \"Hell Patrol\". The other songs may not be as strong as the tracks mentioned above - some, as \"Metalizer\" and \"Secrets of the Dead\", really failed to impress me in any way - but the good thing about \"Redeemer of Souls\" is that it's a pretty solid album as a whole.\n\nUnlike \"Angel of Retribution\", you won't have to search the goods among the dross around here, and you won't submerge in a sea of melodramatic boredom like in \"Nostradamus\" either. This is Judas Priest doing what they do best, without trying to sound modern or grandiose and wasting no time on detours. Far from being a classic of course, \"Redeemer of Souls\" is a good addition to Judas Priest's discography, and I think it will be a suitable final album if they never enter the studio again (though I surely hope they do). And the deluxe edition presents no less than five unique extra tracks, including a few nuggets like \"Creatures\" and \"Tears of Blood\". Go get it straight away, if you still don't own a copy.\n",
        "\nAs it happens with other bands possessing large discographies, there're several distinct groups of Judas Priest fans defined by their preference towards a given style of the band. There are those who cherish their 70s output the most, the seminal metal they started to forge when Ozzy's Sabbath's fuel started to go low; classic rock-tinged heavy metal, and primeval proto-speed. Others prefer the more in-your-face hard rock punch of albums such as Killing Machine and British Steel. Another group favors the ultimate speed metal record, Painkiller, considered by some of them as the peak, not only of the Metal Gods' prolific career, but of heavy metal music itself. Personally, while I enjoy all of their styles and epochs, I undoubtedly stand among the latest group of Priest fans. So, after perfection itself, half man, half machine\u2026 what album comes in second place for us speed freaks? What album shares Painkiller's perfect combination of aggression, explosive catchiness and intelligent compositions that sears past trends and mere commercial intent? \n\nFor me, it's Defenders of the Faith. While it isn't pure blister up and singeing the whole 39 minutes, the mid-paced tracks compensate with emotive heavy metal that's just as memorable but a tiny notch more elaborate than most of the tracks found on their previous four releases. The opening punch though, it's as devastating as the \u201cHellion + Electric Eye\u201d combo. \u201cFreewheel Burning\u201d takes no prisoners, leaving the faces of the listeners charred on the pavement. Dave Holland's finally unleashed here, even more so than in \"Rapid Fire\", and while he's no Scott Travis, the song's propulsive beats are more than legit for a mid-80s metal album. Legendary guitar duo Downing/Tipton are on fire here, the rhythmic riffs and the solos are pure joy, as The Metal God delivers with high-octane, impossible highs and spits words inhumanly fast during the bridge of the track.\n\nThe bruised survivors then prepare to face the \u201cJawbreaker\u201d, a slower (though still pretty fast) number that has one of the greatest K.K. solos in Priest's discography. And the way Halford finishes the song, with an impossible high singing of the title, it's just mind-blowing. \u201cRock Hard, Ride Free\u201d rocks fucking hard indeed, a change of pace and the longer tune of this compact album, which feels longer than it is, in a good way, as most songs have so much to savor in them. If you happen to have the Remasters version of Killing Machine with the bonus tracks, you'll see how this tune originated from the demo named \u201cFight for Your Life\u201d, evolving from a so-so composition into utter ass-kickery. Then comes the much feared \u201cThe Sentinel\u201d, which happens to be my second favorite Judas Priest tune of all times. My skin hairs rise every time I hear that into, such a powerful, ominous a monolithic guitar work. A tale of a post-apocalyptic villain, maybe an antihero, I imagine the guy as if Boba Fett was placed in the Mad Max universe. The guitar solos dueling in the mid section of the song is definitely out of this world. JUST. AWESOME. I've had the privilege of listening to this masterpiece live and now I can die happy\u2026 even if it's one of the Sentinel's throwing knives the one that gets the job done.\n\nThen, starting side B of the LP, we have a double treat of sexual-charged anthems, \u201cLove Bites\u201d and \u201cEat Me Alive\u201d. The first one is more in line aesthetically and in length with \u201cThe Sentinel\u201d, also displaying a menacing intro, this time by the hand of Ian Hill, who's processed bass guitar sounds total 80s as fuck there, but remains cool to this very day. It's like a dark, electrifying rendezvous, with Halford's commanding vocals all over the place. The tune wouldn't be out of place in an erotic 80s flick or maybe a hentai anime. I'm thinking something classy, like Wicked City. The second one is a shorter, faster, speed metal blitz that features a wild display of guitar orgasm, as \u2018the rod of steel injects\u2019. Fancy some god ol' BDSM? Damn. Both tracks feature extremely suggestive lyrics that are quite open to interpretation in terms of the sex genres, number of participants and roles played, so all of you can get to imagine your kinkiest fantasies just as Rob intended, you cheeky bastards! \n\n\u201cSome Heads Are Gonna Roll\u201d is a more straightforward tune, with a somewhat different lyrical approach to the rest of the songs, thanks to the contribution of Bob Halligan, Jr., who also wrote \u201c(Take These) Chains\u201d from Priest's previous album. A critique of the merciless social classes scheme, or perhaps only the business world or the politicians' evil in this world, it contrasts with the badass characters/sexual themes of the other tracks, perhaps as a negative, balancing view of the positive feelings displayed on \u201cRock Hard, Ride Free\u201d. Consequently \u201cNight Comes Down\u201d feels like the tender/slave counterpart to \u201cLove Bites\u201d Eat Me Alive\u201d savage/master themes. The album finishes poorly with \u201cHeavy Duty/Defenders of the Faith\u201d, which seem to be a couple of unused songs from Point of Entry. Those four minutes constitute my only real complain with this otherwise excellent, almost-masterpiece record, which has great production values, dated but still amazing, and yet another sophisticated cover artwork by Doug Johnson. I'll put my money on the Metallian over the Hellion anytime, though. \n\nDefenders of the Faith was and still is Judas Priest epitome of 80s metal, in terms of musical quality and pure artistry. It's vastly superior to both British Steel and marginally better than Screaming for Vengeance despite not having the \u201chits\u201d. And that's because\u2026 This album fucking HITS faster, harder and deeper! While it lacks crowd favorites like \u201cBreaking the Law\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019ve Got Another Thing Comin\u201d, 90% of the material here is pure heavy metal mastery, cherished by hardcore fans of the band. While the average rock enthusiast probably thinks in those two songs when the name Judas Priest is mentioned, for me it will always be \u201cThe Sentinel\u201d or \u201cJawbreaker\u201d. And just like with Painkiller I wish they had carried on with this direction, which is why the synth-happy Turbo will always be a much despised album by me. But the ultimate Defenders of the Faith, our Metal Gods, resonate strong with this outstanding 1984 release. Our heavy duty: to keep the faith. Forever.\n",
        "\nWhile in the year 2014 we witness the release of UK metal veterans Judas Priest's much anticipated 17th full-length album, \u2018Redeemer of Souls\u2019, we also celebrate the 40th anniversary of their debut release, \u2018Rocka Rolla\u2019. 40 years is indeed a long time to be in the music industry and Judas Priest have seen a lot over the decades. They were one of the bands from the UK to be a part of the NWOBHM and have grown to become one of the best and well known metal bands in the world.\n\nPriest have also changed with the times, either with trends musically at the time, or taking risks and going on the front foot concerning changes to the band. The appointment of Tim \"Ripper\" Owens marked a significant change of musical style for Priest after Rob Halford left and while \u2018Jugulator\u2019 and \u2018Demolition\u2019 aren't the best albums in the band's career, it showed that Priest could mix it up and become multi-dimensional. And lastly, Priest\u2019s concept album \u2018Nostradamus\u2019 may not have worked with the majority of fans, but again proved that Judas Priest were not afraid to take a gamble and do something against the grain.\n\nSo, what to expect from the Metal Gods' latest effort, \u2018Redeemer of Souls\u2019? A mistake that us fans tend to do with bands we love is to put massively high expectations of a new album. What you have to remember is that Priest have been around for over 40 years and, by this stage of their careers, it is quite unlikely that we'll ever see anything reminiscent of the near-perfect \u2018Painkiller\u2019 ever again. Rob Halford is 62 years old and time has taken its toll on his vocal cords, but he knows his limits and that's what you get on the new album. \n\nWhat you will find, however, is a good to solid album in which the song-writing tends to delve into Judas Priest's previous eras, ranging from their early \u201880s stylings of \u2018Screaming for Vengeance\u2019 and \u2018Defenders of the Faith\u2019, to their late \u201870s bluesy stylings of \u2018Stained Class\u2019 and \u2018Hellbent for Leather\u2019; and lastly the vigorous tenacities of \u2018Angel of Retribution\u2019. My first gripe of this album is that it's probably two maybe three songs too long. 13 tracks and 18 if you include the deluxe edition, is a lot of songs. Kudos for the five bonus tracks, which most of them are actually decent and should have replaced the few rather lacklustre tracks found throughout this album.\n\nI also feel that Judas Priest could have done more on this album. \u2018Redeemer of Souls\u2019 is missing a bit of grunt and power that we\u2019ve come to expect over the years and decades from the Metal Gods. Yes there are a few speedy, thunderous tracks that take your back to the glory days, the ones that sweep you off your feet, those being classic 80\u2019s-90\u2019s Priest sounding wonders that are \"Dragonaut\", \"Battle Cry\", and \"Metalizer\". Sadly though, those ripping tracks are unfortunately too few and far between and you are left feeling almost cheated and confused by the lack of vigour and tempo. \n\nI don't mind the band recreating styles from previous eras of the four decades they have been around in, as it makes for a diverse CD. With that said, however, ultimately this approach has made the disc fairly directionless and frustrating, particularly when some of the songs just prod along (take \u201cCold Blooded\u201d and \u201cSecrets of the Dead\u201d for examples) and fail to really take off because of that lack of crunch, heart, bite and grit. They sound tired and almost put in there just to \u201cfill the quota\u201d; it\u2019s the cold hard sign that this band\u2019s flame is beginning to extinguish. \n\nAll is not lost, however, with Priest as the seasoned veterans that they are, can still write catchy songs that deliver the goods and win over the majority of their fans, providing further glimpses of their rockin\u2019 best, with powerful tracks in the names of \"Hell & Back\", the mid-paced but effective \"Halls of Valhalla\" (which originally I had as a filler but has since grown on me), \"March of the Damned\" and the swift \"Crossfire\", that stand up over the filler rest.\n\nOverall, Priest's new album is just that; a Judas Priest album. Neither spectacular nor terrible, \u2018Redeemer of Souls\u2019 is just a good solid release from one of the best metal bands in the world, who have been churning out albums for 40 years. Diehard fans will enjoy this just like they have with previous albums, but there will be some criticism from the media, highlighting a number of disappointing things on the album, as expected. \n\nTime waits for no man and in the case of Judas Priest, we have to acknowledge that now we are starting to see its vulnerability after 40 years in the game. Despite that, hopefully with the injection of some youth and new blood into their ranks (Faulkner), it may rub off onto the aging dinosaurs that are Halford, Tipton, and Hill; and we might just get maybe one more Priest album before this band is put out to pasture and into the Hall Of Fame.\n\nOriginally written for www.themetalforge.com\n",
        "\nEverybody knows that Judas Priest was the catalyst for millions, if not billions of metal bands that were to follow them. They defined the aggression that followed the heaviness, and were basically the very first bricks laid after the cornerstone, said cornerstone being Black Sabbath. They were still refining themselves in the mid 1970's, however, and even on their third release, \"Sin After Sin\", there remains some pieces of their \"Rocka Rolla\" days. Nevertheless, the album still soars with hints of the band's more powerful direction in the future.\n\nThe album opens with what I consider to by my favorite track, \"Sinner\". The reason being that it's just as fast-paced as \"Tyrant\" on the previous album, and has more licks to get behind. Like the long songs on \"Sad Wings of Destiny\", it also seems a little progressive, as it consists of more than just the standard two or three verses found in \"Tyrant\". It even slows down near the end, but that doesn't mean that the entire song is ruined by any means. It just demonstrates the band's experimental style that was going on at the time of the album's release. One song that doesn't do much with experimentation, however, would be the classic, \"Dissident Aggressor\". It's pretty much crunching and powerful the whole song through, not much more than just mostly aggression. It is kinda slow during the verses, but the song barely lasts more than three minutes - hardly a typical 70's progressive rock song, if you'd ask me. \n\nRemember, this is the 70's, and heavy metal was still in its embryonic stages. As such, there's songs on \"Sin After Sin\" that borderline hard rock, 'cos that's what dominated the airwaves around that time. \"Last Rose of Summer\" is anything but hard, and hardly anything that anybody'd expect from Judas Priest. Simply put, it's basically a 70's hard rock ballad that sounds exactly like something Bad Company would cough up. Unless you don't really appreciate classic rock much, I really wouldn't consider \"Last Rose of Summer\" to be that bad of a song. Although it's considered another ballad, \"Here come the Tears\" is a potential candidate for a good song. It's harder, more metal-based, despite being at a plodding pace, not to mention Rob Halford's varying vocal range, from his signature high notes, to a sobering, baritone/bass that comes during the chorus. That song alone shows just how talented Rob Halford is when singing. It proves that he's capable of more than just his metal screams to convey one song's anger. He can also convey the sorrow of another.\n\nDid you know that \"Diamonds and Rust\" was originally a song written and performed by Joan Baez, the female equivalent of Bob Dylan? I'm sure you do, since you've most likely read the album's notes on this website. We all know that Baez never really used electric guitars, so would a Judas Priest version of \"Diamonds and Rust\" be the 70's equivalent of the band's ill-conceived cover of Chuck Berry's \"Johnny B. Goode\" on their \"Ram it Down\" album in the 80's? Not so fast! The band took \"Diamonds and Rust\" and made it their own thing. They've introduced the heavy guitars that made them famous, sped up the tempo, and otherwise made the song more aggressive in a sense. For this reason, if you listened to this song before the original, you'd find it hard to believe that it's actually a cover! They've taken what's a folk song, and turned it into a hard rock/heavy metal song, and that's covering a song done right.\n\nEven as a more experimental effort, it still carries quite a few good songs. It might not be what we'd all expect Priest to be, but hey, this was only their third album, and the raging speed of \"Exciter\" would come much later. Even with that being said, there's quite a bit of heaviness to be found on \"Sin After Sin\". It may be a product of its time, but it's still got what Priest would do plenty of in the decades to come soon after.\n",
        "\nIn 1976, there were many big bands that were classified as \"heavy metal\", yet there were only a few that actually were, the biggest one being Black Sabbath. It would be a band that at the time, was somewhat overlooked, that would bring help bring forth the NWOBHM, and with it, the rejuvenation of metal as we know it. That band was Judas Priest, and while many bands that the public put into the heavy metal category didn't quite fit the credentials of most of us, Priest was the band that would. Their first album, \"Rocka Rolla\", isn't quite what we expected from them, as they just started out at the time, but it would be \"Sad Wings of Destiny\" that would predict the band's destiny as one destined for heaviness.\n\nJudas Priest was still experimenting with their style, even at this stage, so you'd expect to hear some songs that aren't quite at the same level as \"Painkiller\". Even so, they still managed to inspire quite a few people, including the young Dave Mustaine, who mentioned its significance in his autobiography. From the hard and driving power of \"Tyrant\" to the slow and menacing \"The Ripper\", this album totally fits into everything that would qualify as true metal. When experimenting, Priest has made quite a few promising results, even when they aren't quite fast. Such is the case for \"Victim of Changes\". Despite its slow tempo, it would be the heaviness and the raunchiness of the guitar power that would help make it stick. An even better song is \"The Ripper\", which also has a slow tempo. A fast tempo isn't needed in order to fulfill its status as a Priest classic, all it needed was sinister-sounding riffing with lyrics that conveyed the even more sinister nature of the titular Ripper, and everything was in place. It might not have been the most headbangable of a song, but bear in mind that this was the 70's, and songs at this pace were perfectly acceptable at the time.\n\nOh yes, there will be power...a lot of power. \"Deceiver\", for example has a crunching and chugging main riff, but that would be nothing compared to the fast and driving aggression of \"Tyrant\". Not only does that one have that driving pace that would be a stepping stone for Priest to get into \"Painkiller\" mode, but it's also got that crunch that defines heavy metal. Its main riff also consists of the power chords that many other bands at the time would never even dare to use, due to their aggressive nature. Those groups have only one goal in mind; to sell as much records as possible so that they could live the rock n' roll dream. Judas Priest sort of had the same goal, except they were willing to innovate. A dual guitar attack wouldn't be uncommon today, and that's mainly 'cos of Glen Tipton and K.K. Downing being the pioneers of this phenomena. During the 70's, nobody could ever expect the dueling guitar solos of \"Tyrant\" and \"Genocide\" to come out of any band. \n\nEven when the band is at its softest, there seems to be something to like. Take for instance the gloom of \"Epitaph\". At first glance, it might seem like a bit of a cheesy barbershop quartet song about love and whatnot, due to the backing vocals ooing and aahing, but the lyrics convey something much more serious; the inevitability of death. The piano, along with the somber vocal delivery of Rob Halford, only adds to the dark and sad nature of the song. It's sort of a memento mori for anyone of any age, from the time of its release to today and beyond. \"Dreamer Deceiver\" actually has some guitar power, but it's mainly acoustic guitar power, making it very soft. It has a more mysterious and eerie tone to it, so it's perfectly acceptable to enjoy it. \"The Ripper\" has a mysterious vibe to it as well, but it's much more aggressive to fit the more abrasive, bloodthirsty nature of the song's subject matter. \"Dreamer Deceiver\", however, appeals more to fantasy and thus it doesn't need to be as hard as \"The Ripper\". \n\n\"Rocka Rolla\" may be the first full-length effort by Judas Priest, but it would be \"Sad Wings of Destiny\" that would truly define Priest as a metal band. It would lay the cornerstone to the band's career, as well as set the standards for the millions of metal bands to come in the future. Everything has to begin somewhere, and the fastness and aggression of the metal that we're familiar with began here. If Black Sabbath invented the heaviness, it would be Priest who would invent the aggression, and songs like \"Tyrant\" are proof of what musicians can truly be capable of.\n",
        "\nOut of all the albums in the 80's, \"Defenders of the Faith\" is my definite favorite ever to be released by Judas Priest. It's got more power and aggression than \"Screaming for Vengeance\" and \"British Steel\" combined, and up until the release of \"Painkiller\" in 1990, was pretty much the hardest album the band ever released. Sure, we do get some traces of commercial sound that CBS pressured Priest to create, but those don't affect how awesome it is in any way, 'cos even they're worth something. \n\nThe sweet album cover art by Doug Johnson is only the beginning to the awesome power of \"Defenders of the Faith\". On every song, Judas Priest put more power into their signature sound, creating something any metaller could be proud of. From the fast and blazing \"Freewheel Burning\" to the haunting and somber \"Night Comes Down\", there's something on this album for everyone. One of my favorite tracks, however, is \"The Sentinel\", which begins with an aggressive, yet elusive-sounding intro by K.K. Downing that builds up to the fast and driving song itself. The guitar solos of Downing and Glen Tipton clash against each other, both playing some sick and tasty solos before combining to create a single harmonic solo to finish the break. They do the same thing in \"Rock Hard, Ride Free\". Despite being at commercial tempo, \"Rock Hard, Ride Free\" doesn't necessarily need speed in order to be an underrated classic. We got harmonic riffs played by Downing and Tipton great enough to rival those of Iron Maiden's Adrian Smith and Dave Murray. \n\nSure, this album isn't without its more commercial songs (the band was, after all, under the iron fist of CBS Records!). The song which I'm sure would get a lot of complaints would be the ballad, \"Night Comes Down\". I actually kinda like it better than other people would. It's got a more eerie and somber vibe to it rather than a pretentious and synth-infused one. The chorus, however, could've been better, but it had to be catchy in order for it to get noticed, right? Then there's \"Love Bites\", a song with much more power. It's at that same commercial pace as the classic hit \"You've Got Another Thing Comin'\", but it actually has a more mystifying tone than an abrasive and crunching one. There's also \"Heavy Duty\", which fades into the title track, which mainly consists of a crowd chanting \"We are defenders of the faith\". Both songs have that pounding, and somewhat anthem-like tempo to it, but it's hard rocking tone doesn't quite make it reach the more majestic, anthem-like level of \"United\" on the \"British Steel\" album. \n\nBut there's also songs that are driving and powerful, all the way through. The opening track, \"Freewheel Burning\", is one of them. It's one of many songs on \"Defenders of the Faith\" that are grinding and full of energy, more songs than \"Screaming for Vengeance\" or \"Britsh Steel\". It's also the fastest track on the album, giving us the impression of leading at breakneck speed with high octane, as the lyrics describe, and the power of Rob Halford's vocals is part of the reason for it. With the previous album, \"Screaming for Vengeance\" we only get two or three songs where Rob is able to use his powerful voice to its fullest potential. With \"Defenders of the Faith\", \"Freewheel Burning\" is one of several songs which feature Halford's high pipes. They also carry these songs higher than the production quality could ever dare to. The production quality that makes the album heavier is good, but such an album with high-energy vocals is even better. They make even slower songs, like \"Rock Hard, Ride Free\" incredible tracks, 'cos the song gets more energy than it would without Halford. \"Eat Me Alive\", however is an exception; Halford barely screams in this one, and uses his more gruff and snide side. Even so, it still manages to be just as good as the songs that do feature Halford's metal screaming. \n\nI honestly don't see how such a tremendous album could get so little fanfare, even from the band itself (its commemorative 30th anniversary edition didn't come out until almost a full year after its actual anniversary date). It's quite an underrated album. I get that we've got the classics, but why didn't any of the songs on here become classics themselves? How come \"Defenders of the Faith\" didn't get the recognition it deserved? And more importantly; why does \"Turbo\" get more respect? The answers to these questions might never come to light, but nevertheless, \"Defenders of the Faith\" is the \"Painkiller\" of the 80's, a true forgotten masterpiece.\n",
        "\nI've mentioned in another review that I preferred \"British Steel\" over \"Screaming for Vengeance\", and there are reasons for this. It's not that \"Screaming for Vengeance\" is a terrible album (come on, I did give it more than 80% after all!), it's just that it doesn't have as much of Priest's aggression as the other albums have to offer. It's mostly commercial-sounding, but we do get some of that grinding and pounding sound that we crave, and the songs that contain them are classics that remain in our memories and will do so in the decades to come.\n\nPossibly what made this album a classic among metal fans are the songs that are actually awesome. The whole album begins with a very effective harmonic riff that makes up \"The Hellion\", which goes into the equally powerful \"Electric Eye\". The latter is a fast and driving song that, with the improved production quality, set new standards for Judas Priest. Just as some of their songs got more and more radio-friendly, others got more and more aggressive. Sure, there were songs with faster tempos released even before \"Screaming for Vengeance\" (\"Exciter\" being one of my favorites), but the production quality of this album makes this song, along with the fast-paced title track, seem more aggressive and heavier than before. I guess being with a big record label like CBS was sort of a double-edged sword for the band, as they did seem to create some good stuff like \"Electric Eye\", but at the same time, they also released songs like \"(Take These) Chains\" (more on that later). \n\nSome of the radio-friendly songs are more tolerable than others. For example, we've got the famous \"You've Got Another Thing Comin'\". It is at a more commercial pace, but it still has all the swagger that it needs to be a good song. More little-known songs, like \"Bloodstone\" and \"Devil's Child\" are sort of the same way, but the latter seems to have a more glam-like style. This might be foreshadowing the days of the dreaded \"Turbo\" album, the band's equivalent of Celtic Frost's \"Cold Lake\". Even with that said, it's not as bad as it could be. It's still kinda out of character for the band to release it, but what's even more out of character is \"Pain and Pleasure\". It's a slow, hard rock song that would be lousy enough to compete with \"Don't Go\" from \"Point of Entry\". The song I have the most complaints about, though, is \"(Take These) Chains\", a song written not by the band, but by a guy named Bob Halligan Jr. He was responsible for some songs by KISS, Kix, and, get this, Cher. Yeah, that Cher. No, not \"chair\", Cher. If you listened to the song, the evidence couldn't be any more glaring. It's got some insanely stupid melodies, especially in the chorus, so the heavy guitars and vocal performance of Rob Halford don't excuse the song from being ostracized by fans (including myself). In fact, Halford's vocals just don't seem to fit with that kind of melody. If you want someone who's more capable of pulling it off, I would suggest Paul Stanley instead. Rob Halford is too gruff and aggressive for those kinds of melodies. Sorry Mr. Halligan!\n\nHowever, \"(Take These) Chains\" is just one song on the album, so it's not like the whole album has that insipid sound found there. If you want an excellent song that still has a bit of radio-friendliness (what very few of you there are), let's just ignore \"(Take These) Chains\" and go for \"Riding on the Wind\". Man, is that a powerful song! It's got a hard, rocking riff, but it's also set at a fast, driving tempo, like the more metal-influenced \"Electric Eye\". It's also where Halford's soaring and screeching vocals shine brightest. I can't really think of any song that consists entirely of Rob screaming his lungs out for every lyric of the song that had been released earlier. It puts a lot more power into the song, and that's one reason why it's one of my favorites on \"Screaming for Vengeance\". It's also the reason why I didn't give the album a rating lower than 80%. While the more commercial songs do take some points off, it's songs like \"Riding on the Wind\" that keep the album in the air. \n\nThose songs, however, aren't enough for me to get \"Screaming for Vengeance\" a higher rating. The radio-friendliness is more prevalent here, and it's hard to ignore the sheer cheesiness of those songs. Nonetheless, some people still seem to enjoy it. I do, but not as much as other Priest albums. In my personal opinion, it's not as good as it could be. If it cut back on the radio-friendliness, it would've been on the same level as a much better, but often overlooked album released later, \"Defenders of the Faith\". I do have to admit, though, I love the album cover art!\n",
        "\nOkay, maybe I'm wrong about \"Point of Entry\" being Judas Priest's first attempt to please Columbia Records by creating some commercial-sounding songs, but nonetheless, \"British Steel\" is a classic among everyone. It's basically where they further cemented themselves into the public mind while still maintaining their edge that made them one of the first heavy metal bands in recorded history. Since it's got some commercial sound, it's not all that perfect, but to be fair, neither was \"Screaming for Vengeance\", considered to be one of their greatest besides my personal favorite album, \"Painkiller\".\n\nAs a matter of fact, I actually consider this album to be slightly better than \"Screaming for Vengeance\". Now before you start running towards my home with pitchforks and torches, hear me out. \"Screaming for Vengeance\" has a lot more radio-friendly sound than \"British Steel\", but not as much as \"Point of Entry\" or the horrendous \"Turbo\". \"British Steel\" keeps more of the edge that Priest had in the preceding decade that they were together, and the proof of that is in \"Grinder\". While it is a little slower than expected, we can't expect every Priest song to be fast and driving. \"Grinder\" just needs the crunch and the power of the guitars, along with the growling vocal swagger of Rob Halford, and it does its job nicely. Those, my friends, are what make a Judas Priest song what it is. Want something a little faster? Check out \"Rapid Fire\", the fastest song on the album. Its speed and ferocity is likely one of the factors that influenced NWOBHM, as well as the subgenres that came afterword, like thrash metal. It's no wonder that bands like Metallica looked toward Priest as a source for inspiration. On top of that, its tempo faster than any song on \"Screaming for Vengeance\", especially its title track. There are many other songs on \"British Steel\" that feature the pounding aggression that made Priest famous, like \"Steeler\" and the super-famous \"Breaking the Law\". The number of more commercial songs on \"Screaming for Vengeance\" outnumbers that of the Priest's signature sound, which is another reason why I prefer \"British Steel\" over \"Screaming for Vengeance\".\n\nOf course we get some radio-friendly songs, and unsurprisingly, these were the songs that were constantly played on the radio. In fact, the very first song I heard from Priest was the crowd favorite, \"Living After Midnight\", which I think I heard when I was in eighth grade or so. Due to its peppy and upbeat nature, I had no idea of Priest's more famous and amazing works (\"Painkiller\"). While some critics may say that it was totally out of character for the band to come up with the song, it remains a favorite even to this day. It's the complete polar opposite of the band's more aggressive style, yet Halford's growling vocals and heavy guitars are still present. The guitars just play a more light-hearted riff and Halford just sings in a more hard rock-oriented style. Though it might not be as famous as its label-pleasing counterpart, \"You Don't Have to be Old to be Wise\" is sort of the same way, except it has a bit more swagger than \"Living After Midnight\". The song's length is also longer, suggesting a song that wasn't necessarily meant for radio airplay. \"Breaking the Law\", despite its overall power, is a more likely candidate. It only clocks in at two and a half minutes and has the brief noise of a car siren in place of a proper guitar solo. Nonetheless, it does carry a pretty addicting hook, and that's probably part of the reason why it got the attention it did. Even if they sound more radio-friendly, they at least have the power and audacity to back them up. It's why I'm not really complaining about \"Living After Midnight\" being a more rock-oriented song than a metal one. Those songs still carry the power that Priest needed in order to maintain their status as a metal band, and influence many metal bands to come in the future.\n\nAs much as I'd hate to think that much of the more famous songs Priest made for this album were the result of the record label trying to make another Captain and Tennille out of a metal band, they're still enjoyable. As I said before, \"Screaming for Vengeance\", despite being a good album, just isn't as good as \"British Steel\". I know that's generally considered a form of heresy in the metal community to say that an album like \"British Steel\" is better than the more famous ones, but I still think \"Painkiller\" is better then the both of them. It's likely on my personal top five list of the best Priest albums, 'cos it still has the sound that we all know and love, and a little more.\n",
        "\nAfter the release of the abysmal \"Turbo\" and the mediocre \"Ram it Down\" albums, Judas Priest finally decided to get their act together and craft some of their best material, and then some. As a result, we have \"Painkiller\", which turned out to be one of Priest's best since \"British Steel\". Gone is the goofiness of the poodle-haired \"Turbo\" and here we've got an album more serious. Possibly more serious than any Priest album released before. \n\nEvery song on here has some form of aggression on it, and that means getting rid of that rock influence as well as that pop influence that plagued the previous two albums. In fact, this might as well be the most aggressive Priest album ever made at that time, since there is a song, \"Metal Meltdown\", which contains a blindingly fast tempo. Other songs, like \"All Guns Blazing\" and \"Between the Hammer and the Anvil\" include fast and driving tempos, not to mention the foreboding vibe during the intro and the bridge of \"Nightcrawler\". This is proof that Priest didn't just try hard to eliminate the influence of \"Turbo\", they completely vaporized it into oblivion with an aggressive, flamethrowing sound. In terms of vocals, Rob Halford had brought back his signature screaming with \"Ram it Down\", but it wasn't until \"Painkiller\" when it really had the chance to shine the way it should. Here, his vocals are more powerful than ever, as he puts a lot more energy into them than in any song released previously. There are few moments in the title track where he calms down, and when he does, he never runs out of energy, he just sings a little softer. Even when he's not belting out metal screams, he can produce a very convincing performance. Take for instance, \"Nightcrawler\". During the bridge of that song, Rob sings/speaks with a gruff, yet soft sneer to convey a terrifying story. \n\nThe album is known for its more aggressive side, like with the title track and others, but the synthesizer has not disappeared. In fact, the band decided to use them the way they should be used; to supplement the sound of some of the songs rather than creating a glossy pop single. \"One Shot at Glory\", along with its intro \"Battle Hymn\", has them, but it's more aggressive than you'd expect it to be, 'cos the synthesizers are there, but the guitars take up much of it. They create an epic, powerful tone during before each chorus as Rob Halford sings a powerful melody \"Nightcrawler\" has a dark and forbidding tone as well, thanks to the synthesizers, which create a dark atmosphere, setting the stage for the titular monster as it stalks the streets. Even with the ballad (yes, there's a ballad), \"A Touch of Evil\", there isn't even the slightest hint of goofy radio-friendliness, not even with synthesizers involved. That's only 'cos the synthesizers don't choke the song with their influence, and let the guitars do all of the dirty work. There's also the fact that it's not wimpy and syrupy, like most ballads are, instead, we have a darker, more sinister tone that's actually punctuated by the synthesizers playing a cold, eerie hook as the guitars kick in.\n\nJudas Priest didn't just come back with \"Painkiller\" they burst through the room at full-throttle, delivering what is arguably their finest effort. This album is one of my favorites, and it's not hard to see why. It's an album where Priest redefined their sound almost completely, and it ended up sounding excellent. The album's glory was not to last, however, as lousy alternative rock bands began to become the norm in the 90's. Priest was just coming back, too, so it couldn't have come at a worse time, when metal was almost completely wiped off the face of the Earth by the popularity of bland artists like R.E.M.\n",
        "\nAs with anything, age and the passage of time are often cruel and unforgiving masters to whom we are undeniably submissive. Sure, we can do everything to try and combat the inevitable, but eventually the laws of gravity and life give way and we have limits set for us. Sometimes we have to have the good sense to know when to hear that last bell and follow its dreaded tolling into that gentle goodnight. After hearing teaser tracks from the latest Judas Priest effort, Redeemer of Souls, I'm caught between a barbed wire fence and nearly 35-years of heavy metal greatness (dismissing the one or two bumps in that long and storied road). \n\nOkay, long and short, this latest Priest record is criminally missing one of its major components in terms of sound, and that is Mister Ken \"K.K.\" Downing. That familiar tonal assault I'm so used to hearing on each Priest record since 1980 is just gone, vanished into the nether of a myriad of conjecture and quick dissociative blurbs. As to why Downing decided to opt out of one of the greatest metal bands to ever walk the planet, I hear the rumors and see the aforementioned block quotes, but I can only surrender to my own personal feelings of something completely off and just not right. That little OCD moment aside, I sat here and more or less convinced myself that the utter disaster that was Nostradamus couldn't possibly be matched, and thankfully I was right. This newest record isn't anything close to that double-disc insult, but it also isn't at the level of credibility of Angel of Retribution, harkening the return of Rob Halford to the fold after a lengthy foray into Trent Reznor-esque boredom and an eventual return to the very medium once sarcastically declared \"dead.\" Musically, Redeemer of Souls is a competent, even good album for your run of the mill NWOBHM band vying for a selected spot in this current resurgence of that primitive, yet fundamentally important sound. There are standout tracks, such as \"Valhalla\" that really overpower me and get me feeling good about the Priest again, but I'd be remiss if I didn't say that there is so much studio magic on Halford's voice it should be a Honey Nut Cheerios commercial. The high register days of \"The Sentinel\" and \"Dreamer Deceiver\" are long over, I understand that, but the vocal performance here sports a very thin border between rudimentary and a simple going-through-motions. Is it offensive? No, not by any means, but I will say that the little clean vocal crooning in \"Sword of Damocles\" is downright painful and should have been cut out completely from an otherwise decent track. These little indiscretions don't pile up too much, but they do tend to throw off the vibe and flow of the album. I suppose after 40-years going, Judas Priest no longer needs to worry about such things.\n\nSandwiched between spurts of goodness, tracks like \"March of the Damned\" read more like a mediocre bar band trying to fire up a corner saloon filled with drunken leftovers from the 80's hair metal scene. Vocally, lyrically, even musically it falls well short of being anything close to memorable. The soloing is about as lackluster as it gets, which is depressing considering the magic sweeping from at least one set those fingers for all of these years. I'm not knocking Richie Faulkner or his ability to play his instrument; truth told, he is a very good guitarist, but if he was supposed to be some sort of cortisone injection into an aging Priest, that shot missed the target muscle. The closest we get to former glory is the opening riff in \"Down in Flames,\" which recalls, quite vividly, \"Heading Out to the Highway\" with its chunky riff and thumping bass line that made me momentarily smile. This track is one of the sandwich tracks I mentioned and resonates pretty well as something you might have heard from either Point of Entry or Painkiller. Even the vocals on this track are really as close to \"nailing it\" as Rob Halford will come, but I am anxious to hear some of the leaked live shows when they start trickling out there to see how this material stands up in the purest form possible. \n\nAgain, this album shows us an aged Judas Priest, and that little fact isn't lost on me. However, as a lifelong fan of the band I don't think it's unreasonable to assume (and hope) for a more spirited performance from these guys. When I hear this album all the way through for about the sixth or seventh time now, I am left wanting more. I want Downing and that familiar Tipton/Downing trade off that still makes Dave Murray and Adrian Smith so damn potent in the same age bracket. I want a fire in the belly; the same fire that kept a dying Ronnie James Dio going strong and powerful for a lot longer than probable as he approached 70. My point is, despite the ever-declining lifespan of us all, there is still something to be said for giving it your all and just going for it with the proverbial metal on the floor and the open wind slapping you into violent submission. Even the opening notes of \"Cold Blooded\" seem so lifeless and solicit no real emotional engagement, and that's the saddest part of this record for me (though the solo in this song is the best on the album.) There are definite moments of pinhole-lighted magic disseminated throughout the entire album, but overall Redeemer simply fails to thrill me like it should, but I keep myself satiated by telling myself, \"At least it ain't that last pile of crap.\" We all have our little pick-me-ups.\n\nI love Judas Priest. I love everything about the band: the history, the black leather-studded, whip-carrying, motorcycle-riding, unearthly-screaming Judas Priest that I grew up with all through the 80's into the present day. It pains me to my core to see one of my favorite bands simply lose a fire that has been burning for so long, and please don't sedate yourself with talk of them being older and still being a great band for its age. Even worse, I've seen it bandied about that they are legends and should \"get a pass\" for being less than stellar now, and this is where I vehemently disagree. Picture, if you will, an aging pugilist, whose better days of single-vision are long behind him. He knows nothing else but how to fight, and despite the brain damage and obvious grasping at straws to stay both relevant and competitive, he simply doesn't have the tools to keep up any longer. Yet he stays. He takes beating after beating, swelling and bleeding from every orifice on his head, and he simply won't quit. Why is this man so stubborn? Pride? Conviction? Stupidity? One too many blows to the head? Who can say? All we see is this shell of former greatness that is well past his prime, and the last visage we'll have of him is a weary and stumbling artifact walking away, not to a Bill Conti composition, but to a quiet, pitying darkness that will slowly envelop him as he shrinks from sight into the rest of his broken existence. The bell has rung, and it's time to let it go gracefully while the last visuals are ones of amazement and triumph. It will not get any better from this point on, and we need to see that and accept it.\n\nThe world isn't fair, but it is consistent. \n\n(Originally written for www.metalpsalter.com)\n",
        "\n. . .the Jugulator will reach in and rip your spine out.\n\nBefore we go any further we will note how much the sound of Judas falcon Priest has varied over the years, always staying current yet putting their own spin on things, often influenced by bands they themselves inspired. Here they play power/thrash metal which is a logical step up from Painkiller, an excellent album just a little too homogenized. Painkiller was mostly speed metal that ran together with a few mid paced riffs and songs to break it up and the horribly misplaced A Touch of Evil that threw the mood askew. The songs on it's a damn Jugulator sound similar as well, yes, but there's better track placement and no Touch of Evils. \n\nThe reason I mention all this is because this album is hated by many Brain Dead folks, after all there's a fucking new guy: Tim fucking Ownsyou, who's even better than Rob \"Ripper Sr.\" Halford, and that fact really bums out the fanboys. Now, I love classic JP or Japes; hell the Halfordian is one of the prime metal voices, without him to inspire Tim fuckOwensing, who knows if the man would have ever sang the way he does. He's a more extreme version of his dad which suits the mindset of late 90s Japes, a time when groove metal was all the rage. The lyrics have taken a beating on this disc and they are, along with T.O. at times, almost too brutal, but they fit the rip-throat riffs. And because it's so heavy (easily the heaviest offering from Japes) it makes sense to have a younger, pissed off version of 'ole Rob on vox like it makes sense to have 'iron clawed' lyrics. \n\nBlood Stained is a religio/politico observation and the vicious Bullet Train shows how Japes can integrate groove metal into their classic, melodic aesthetic with both thug-like vocals and actual singing. Toronto Tim Owens does the Anselmo 'HUH!!!' thing for the \"Death defy me scrutinize me\" lines while howling \"With each new mile standing on trial\" during the pre-chorus. And there's no weak songs on here, everything is tits. Let's look at these alien Abductors (see this album is less dumb than Painkiller) with that unnerving clean strumming/chanting break at the 2 minute mark where Toronto Tim carries it for a bit. Then there's the apocalyptic Cathedral Spires with lyrics that I imagine anyone can relate to at some point in their lives, we all get tired of the miserable existence we've created for ourselves and the eventual doom we have coming regardless. \n\nAnd yet rather than wallow in the depression that such knowledge can bring the Jugulator destroys everything. Quenched by violence these guys, these fucking guys, were having the time of their lives playing this shit; and they all get their chances to shine. Ian steps-out-from-under-Hill in a way not seen since the very early days of Japes. Take Burn in Hell with its anxious, brooding intro where the guitar picking creates the unease while a throbbing bass riff creeps from the shadows. In comes the (Heart of a) killer whaling, asking the question: \"HAVE YOU GOT A GUNT?!\" Eventually we explode into mid-paced yet furious riffing; the whole thing streamlined by the bass, providing the murder demon with a strong spine. And during the \"stuck like a hog\" segment Toronto descends into sleazy, unholy lows before turning it around for the ending chorus reprisal. Halford's only son then steps up octaves until he hits the stratosphere and stays there in pitch perfect comfort, earning his place in Heavy Metal Valhalla. \n\nThis is the most musically rich thing that the Japes pantheon has done since their 70s deeds, what with your steel bass and its little quick licks, adding weight to the meaty riffs. The riffs cycle through different styles and often, while there's a main riff being played, another guitar will do an accent riff run off of it. And of course, let's not forget about the solos, they burn fast but frequently, passing by in a tasty flash kind of like the solos on Painkiller; only condensed, overdriven and shredded. The drums of Goro err. . .Scott Travis are a little in the back with this mix but he gives his kit a sound thrashing nonetheless. \n\nCloser Cathedral Spires is one of the most epic deeds done by Japes, right up there with the Dreamer Deceiver/Deceiver suite; only where that was introspective Cosmicism, Cathedral Spires is Doomsday. It starts with the cold ring of clean arpeggios, picked crystalline harmonics joining in a dolorous symphony, as woeful vocals slowly rise until we escalate into the devastating riff of the next level. Attempts to leave the chaos earth and reach the clouds are made until a triumphant doom metal riff, as triumphant as the sadness of heaven, takes us to the final level. Hear chanting vocals are steadily dubbed in with more vocals, rising higher and intensifying until this song explodes in mighty ruin, ending an awesome journey. By now there should be no doubt that this Welshman is the new Metal God. \n\nAnd I'm spent, denouement time.\n\nI must touch upon how well produced this is and how underrated the 90s metal scene was in relation to that. The 80s was the Golden Age when the best music was written, but the 90s are superior sound-wise. Between the basement lo-fi of yore and the sickeningly clean, overly produced stifle of today was the perfect 90s, where the sound was cleaned up just the right amount without losing teeth, instead the crunch is tempered by a modern touch. The Chemical Wedding, Paradise Lost and this goddamned album are cases in point.\n\nJugulator is a classic in its own right folks, and I know some of you are open-minded enough to realize that. It's not The Heavy Metal Bible that is Sad Wings of Destiny but from the Japes mythology have sprung many different beasts. This particular beast: the Jugulator, kills posers and drops panties. At times it's a little cheesy, yes, but that isn't always bad, it all depends on the delivery. And with Tim the FNG, who is so ultra confident it's an understatement to just call it astounding, they get a tongue-in-cheek pass. Even more astounding is that this was his debut with a band that carries as much weight as Japes does. \n\nAlso, it is beyond cheesy to call him Ripper. The name is Owens. Tim Owens.\n",
        "\nI'll start off with the verdict for once: it could have been worse.\n\nThat is not to say Redeemer of Souls ranks on any meter as the sort of career redemption the UK vets implied through their choice of titles, but had they produced what amounted to another overblown waste of time like Nostradamas, my faith in the metal gods would have become incredibly difficult to defend. No, this is essentially a sort of pseudo career retrospective wedged into a supposed swan song, of which the worst crime is that compared to any of Priest's classic run ('74-'90) it feels clunky, retread, uneven, and certainly lazy in enough places that you wish they would have spent a lot more time putting it together...even though it feels like they already spent aeons. But I have to be honest...this is a band I've listened to now for 35 years, and for 2/3rds of that time they have not had much wind in their sails beyond touring, keeping their brand out there, trying out another front man, failing, reuniting with Rob, pressing on, losing K.K. Downing...effort was put into this band on most fronts, but just not in the studio. There was almost no possibility this was going to be good, so I'm simply content that it doesn't suck.\n\nAs the cover hints, and many reviews I've seen would have us believe, this appears at first like a call back to the Painkiller years, which is only partially true. The album front loads an inconsequential '88-'90 rager in \"Dragonaut\" which features some of the most tepid riffing on the whole of the disc, and then follows that up with the title track, which is nothing more than a paraphrasing of \"Hell Patrol\" only nowhere near as timeless. But once you go in and break down the rest, there is quite a lot of representation here for both their groovier hard rock roots and more heavily conceptual 70s material. In fact I'd say that, from a distance, the album seems to be about 50% what they were doing with its predecessor, Painkiller-lite, albeit with less or no orchestration involved, and then 50% waxing nostalgic for the era in which they were a dominant radio force in hard rock and heavy metal. At the same time, nods to the Halford solo records, which represented the man's best work since 1990, are also ubiquitous here. I felt like I was listening to Halford IV numerous times, what with the ProTools-ish punch of the rhythm guitars and the heavily moderated/souped up vocal harmonies that partially hide the wear in his voice...don't get me wrong, he still tears out some fucking lines here that remind us why he is perhaps the most important vocalist in his medium, but this is not \"The Ripper\" or \"Victim of Changes\"....\n\nRob is dealing with the inevitability of time, but most people would pass on both their testicles to science in order to sound like this beloved man at the age of 62. Elsewhere, the band sounds on/off in equal measure, phoning in a slew of saccharine rhythm guitar patterns which dive into basically the lion's share of NWOBHM which the band predated and subsequently outlasted, especially a couple licks that recalled vintage Maiden in addition to their own substantial canon. They can snare us a little more consistently with a bluesier hard rock groove more so than a recycled proto-power metal lick, and the leads are fluent and flashy enough to distract the ear from the relative mediocrity of what is typically happening before, beneath and after them, but whether it's due to the newcomer Richie Faulkner or the lack of Downing, I can't really say. If K.K. were performing these very same songs I don't think the results would fare much better. Elsewhere yet, Scott Travis shows up for a paycheck: the guy can play, but he's only ever as good as the music he's providing the skeleton for, and while you can 'notice' Ian Hill following along the root notes, well grounded as usual, he has just never had a presence with this band that could earn him a place among the ranks of essential bassists. I mean I know it's not how Judas Priest writes, but I'd just love it if for once in 44 years he could just let loose, let us know what he's been hiding all those decades...\n\nStructurally, the album starts off with the aforementioned, skippable harder/faster tunes and then actually picks up in quality with \"Halls of Valhalla\" (decent power metal, superior to anything of Nostradamas) and the mid-paced, driving \"Sword of Damocles\", in which only a few of the vocal lines really feel exceedingly familiar, but it has a nice swagger, as does \"Marched of the Damned\", which functions largely because of Halford's vocals and a nice chorus riff. \"Down in Flames\" starts off pretty strong too with a nice melody cut into the intro lick, but that song is actually where this brief flurry of 'decent' material kind of drops off, and never recovers, with an unbroken sequence of the worst songs on the disc, like the cheesy Painkiller-era wannabes \"Metalizer\" and \"Battle Cry\", or the bluesy, generic \"Crossfire\". In short, there is about an EP here of material worth saving for a B-sides compilation, but it's really just not good enough for Priest. In a few weeks, who will care about any of this? They might suffer you a few of the tunes live, but you know you'll be pining for the 50 or so brilliant songs they wrote so long ago.\n\nFor a group so bloody consistent through the first third of its career, one would really hope they could reach somewhere deep within their imaginations and produce an epitaph worth remembering, but I fear that's too much of a Hollywood storyline to apply to reality. Redeemer of Souls is more or less this year's version of Black Sabbath's 13, symptomatic of a band which still recognizes what made it so special in the first place, but cannot achieve that level of songwriting because it has run short of riffs that feel even tangentially compelling when compared to the impressive legacy they stamped on heavy metal a lifetime ago. At the same time, it's not complete trash...a few of the ideas are not half-assed, if not exemplary either, and there are about 15-20 minutes of pleasant Priest to sift through. It's better than the two Owens-era records, and certainly Nostradamas, but slightly less solid than Angel of Retribution. It's just not a high note to go out with...and considering Rob can still hit some high notes, I'll hold on some sliver of hope. That gibbering late 70s/80s fanatic child within me wants to hear a record he loves by this band again, and not by Halford or Primal Fear or any other band. Kick the new guy, get K.K. Downing back and do it right. We deserve as much, and more importantly, YOU DO.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nGoing into Redeemer Of Souls, I had some pretty moderate expectations but also some worries. I feared that, with 13 songs, the album would have been cluttered with filler and it would fall under it's own weight. Angel Of Retribution felt good with 10 songs, but 13 sounded like it was going to go overboard. The amount of tracks was pretty much my main worry, but after listening to the album via the iTunes stream, I was able to tell myself that I had immensely enjoyed it. I was set to purchase the album, although I was skeptical about buying the deluxe edition because 5 bonus tracks seemed like a bit much. In the end, I even managed to enjoy those. \n\nNeedless to say, I enjoyed this album much more than I thought I would. It has some classic Priest sounded stuff (Down In Flames, Dragonaut, Crossfire) along with some original sounding material that still has a Priest vibe (Halls Of Valhalla, Secrets Of The Dead) to them. If KK Downing leaving the band made you worry that the new Judas Priest wouldn't sound the same, I can assure you that this still very much sounds like Judas Priest. There are plenty of riffs scattered around that make you go \"Yep, that's the band I've come to know and love all these years\", there's some killer screams by Rob Halford that remind you of Painkiller, and there are even some blues-y moments that sound like something from their first couple of albums. Even with one of the major members of the band gone, their first record without him still manages to capture the feeling that you're listening to the same band. \n\nThe production seems to be a major target of criticism for people. I've seen some say it's too loud, too compressed, it sound like a demo, and so on. Although I will agree that the sound isn't nearly as polished as it was on Angel Of Retribution or even Nostradamus, I actually really like how raw it sounds. That's just my preference, although I can see where people are coming from when they criticize how the production was handled. The lyrics are mostly solid, but can come off as a bit cheesy, such as in Down In Flames (\"They want blood. Yes, it's true\"). For the most part though, the lyrics are far from bad, but do you really listen to Judas Priest for that? \n\nAll in all, I'm very happy to say that I really enjoyed Redeemer Of Souls. There are a couple of not so memorable tracks (Secrets of the Dead, Beginning of the End), but the positives definitely outweigh the negatives. I also recommend picking up the deluxe edition for the 5 bonus tracks.\n",
        "\nI'm not sure why Judas Priest chose to go for a more radio friendly, road trip feeling hard rock approach for \"Point of Entry\", but it feels like a 180 degree turn from where they were, especially when you consider the direction that heavy metal was going with fellow countrymen Iron Maiden leading the way. True, their previous albums \"Killing Machine\" and \"British Steel\" boasted a cleaner production and radio potential, but they both clung to the metal speed of their late 70s material. With \"Point of Entry\", Judas Priest took those musical principles to their next step, resulting in an album that, in spirit, is not far off from their debut, \"Rocka Rolla\".\n\nNot that this album is a total throwback, of course. For one thing, this album has a more consistent musical vision than \"Rocka Rolla\" could ever have. Obviously, the production is cleaner, and Judas Priest are at this point fairly comfortable with the idea of utilizing myriad sound effects in their production. But in spirit, this album is not far off from the spirit of their debut, in it's aim to make feel good hard rock perfect for airplay. \"Don't Go\" has an AC/DC feel in the music and Halford's vocal delivery and \"You Say Yes\", \"All the Way\", \"Turning Circles\", \"Hot Rocking\" and most of the other songs on this album would not be out of place if they were played on the Sunset Strip, while \"Heading Out to the Highway\" and \"On the Run\" feel like the song you play to footage of bikers traveling across the American desert. The only songs that appear to dissent from this platform are \"Solar Angels\" with a somewhat foreboding riff and fantasy lyrics, and \"Desert Plains\", where Halford's vocal presence is strong as ever, and he remains the highlight of the album. \"Heading Out to the Highway also has a nice twin guitar solo worthy of K.K Downing and Glen Tipton's talents as musicians.\n\n\"Point of Entry\" isn't exactly what one would call a fan favorite, and along with \"Turbo\", this album is usually ignored or derided by die hard fans. As with \"British Steel\", I feel like one's opinion would be based primarily on whether or not they can appreciate the type of sound Judas Priest is going for, let alone whether they can tolerate metal gods Judas Priest performing this sound. I can't give it my highest recommendation, based purely on personal preference, but I can't condemn it either. At the most, this has a few good ideas here and there, but it feels like a step back or two for Priest. Especially when you consider that this is the band that damn near revolutionized the heavy metal genre.\n",
        "\nBy 1980, Judas Priest had found themselves at the forefront of heavy metal music, and were arguably the most responsible for its thunderous breakaway from the heavy blues scene from which it spawned, resulting in the NWOBHM that would storm the scene that same year. Although they had a healthy amount of material released in the 70s, their ascent as metal gods in the 80s is usually attributed to \"British Steel\", an album with their most commercial sound yet, and one that helped to bring them to the masses, via \"Breaking the Law\" and \"Living After Midnight\". \n\nTo a certain extent, \"British Steel\", is no more commercial than say, their previous effort \"Killing Machine/ Hell Bent For Leather\". The production is crystal clear, the tempo is, mostly, slowed down, and Rob Halford's voice stays at a mainly moderate range. What truly differentiates \"British Steel\" is that the heavy metal thunder is, in this output, a subdued thunder. Only one song, \"You Don't Have to Be Old to Be Wise\", makes it to the five minute mark. The rest of the songs are kept at a time perfect for the radio and the composition remains consistent and straight forward throughout. Lyrically, Judas Priest seem to have found a new focus on this album as well. While previous albums contained the same sci-fi doom and gloom that metal bands still obsess over, the lyrics here are more positive, optimistic and boastful. \"Now I don't care if the people stare, And accuse me of going mad, Just get a long hard look into the mirror, Then tell me who's been had\", proclaims Halford in \"You Don't Have to Be Old to Be Wise\", and songs like \"United\" and \"Metal Gods\" resemble the lyrics of Manowar and Twisted Sister, with their celebrations of youth and heavy metal culture. Judas Priest are proud, loud, ready to conquer and their songs make it clear. Even \"Breaking the Law\" is more a celebration of the narrator's outlaw status than a regretful condemnation.\n\nComposition wise, there are two songs that are very much in the vein of classic Priest, \"Rapid Fire\" and \"Steeler\", both of which are placed as openers and closers of this album. Sandwiched in between are mid-tempo songs like \"Grinder\", \"United\" (the least metal song on the album, which is as repetitive as it is ridiculously anthemic), \"The Rage\" (with a nifty bass line and a clean guitar opener that seems reminiscent of the Police, of all bands) and the swaggering \"Metal Gods\". This also may be the first Judas Priest album without anything resembling a ballad, which seems odd given the commercial hard rock tendencies of this album. Of the album's three singles, \"Breaking the Law, \"United\" and \"Living After Midnight\", I want to bring up \"Living After Midnight\", since this song, with it's mid-tempo guitar riff, melodic chorus and lyrical ode to rock star debauchery, seems like a predictor of the tone and attitude that mainstream heavy metal would take in the 80s with bands like Motley Crue. Not that Judas Priest were the first to make feel good hard rock, but given their influence, it wouldn't be a wild leap to see this song as the missing link between 70s hard rock and Quiet Riot, much like Priest's 70s material was the missing link between Black Sabbath and Iron Maiden.\n\nOne's enjoyment of this album will depend largely on a) their tolerance for commercial sounding metal and b) their tolerance for Judas Priest playing commercial sounding metal. While I will readily admit to preferring a faster, more aggressive Judas Priest, there is nothing on this album that is particularly offensive to the metal fan, and I myself quiet enjoy this album. Do I enjoy it as much as their late 70s material? No. But \"British Steel\" still has enough of a metal sound to it (however subdued) for the classic metal fan to enjoy.\n\nIt even gave us a \"Beavis and Butt-Head\" gag-though I'm still not sure if that's something for Judas Priest to take pride in.\n",
        "\nI'm not sure what force lurked in Judas Priest to be able to release two albums in one year, let alone two albums with different sounds from each other. Bemusement at their workaholism aside, Judas Priest's \"Killing Machine/ Hell Bent For Leather\" (\"Hell Bent For Leather\" is the title it is given in the states, where it has Fleetwood Mac song \"Green Manalishi\" as an added track) is a different machine than it's (very immediate) predecessor \"Stained Class\". Like their previous effort, you have Judas Priest with their own energetic heavy metal sound and a clean production. While I consider myself no expert when it comes to music production, I would argue that this album boasts an even cleaner production than it's immediate predecessor. Not that it's a bad thing, mind you; the guitars have an added crunch in the songs, which counterbalances the otherwise commercial tendencies of this album.\n\nTo a certain degree, I wonder if the two albums were released for two different audiences: \"Stained Class\" for Judas Priest's core fan base up to that point, and \"Hell Bent\" (I know the American title better) for whoever else would listen. Not that the music is devoid of metal of course, as you have \"Delivering the Goods\" the roaring opener that immediately catches you as being even more aggressive than \"Stained Class\", due to the volume on the guitars being turned up and Rob Halford giving his voice a bit of a snarl. The track \"Hell Bent For Leather\" has a sound that is reminiscent of Ted Nugent's \"Stormtroopin\", down to the guitar lick in the chorus, and is a celebration of the visual presentation that Priest had carved for themselves. \"Take on the World\" almost brings Manowar to mind, especially \"Die For Metal\" and similarly catchy mid-tempo metal anthems. The blues roots of their sound come back in 'Rock Forever\" and the Led Zeppelin sounding \"Evil Fantasies\", but the guitars have enough of a crunch in them to avoid sounding like their previous bluesy material. The commercial elements really come in on the title tracks for both versions of this album, as well as \"Evening Star\", with it's clean, ballad like intro, and the actual ballad of the album, \"Before the Dawn\", which, despite a well written guitar solo, doesn't stand up to the musical complexity of \"Beyond the Realms of Death\" from \"Stained Class\".\n\nThere are two things this album lacks, however, that I felt defined the artistic triumph of \"Stained Class\". The first is the lack of true high speed rockers, as even the fastest songs on this album seem to be at a comfortable moderate pace compared to \"Stained Class\". The other is high pitched vocal attack of Rob Halford. Not that he rejects his classic high range entirely, and at certain points he really lets loose the way he does best. On this album, his voice mainly stays a comparatively lower range, with an added bit of the aforementioned snarl to give it a bit of attitude.\n\nAll things considered, \"Killing Machine/ Hell Bent For Leather\" is a solid record by both Priest and traditional heavy metal standards. I would recommend listening to this before the superior \"Stained Class\", if only because following this up with \"Stained Class\" would lessen your appreciation for this album as a whole, making it instead something to be compared with their previous work. This was undoubtedly an album made for hard rock and heavy metal fans not yet familiar with the work of Judas Priest, and it is certainly a good way to be introduced to the band. It has its fillers (mostly the straight forward hard rock songs and \"Before the Dawn\"), but you have to give credit to a band that has the talent to make even fillers sound awesome.\n",
        "\nAdmittedly, I'm not a huge live album guy, but this is a very good album by my standard. There are some things here that are greatly improved from the studio. The guitars are much more potent than they were on any of the previous album and so is the bass. On the other hand, I'm not sure I like how Halford sings these songs or how the drumming sounds. I also have a few qualms with the tracks.\n\nI'll start with the songs from Hell Bent. These songs are better on here than on studio, and it's noticeable. The production on this album is punchier than they had had on the studio albums, so the stringed instruments came out awesome. There is not a song on here that has less energy than it's studio version and the most recent tracks benefit most. Running Wild isn't a particularly good song on Killing Machine, but here it becomes a nice speedster that best encapsulates what this album does best. It takes the songs from the last four albums and beefs them up to speed metal territory. This is also great on a song like Diamonds and Rust from Sin After Sin, where a mid-paced number is made pretty fast.\n\nThis approach doesn't work as well on Exciter, where certain other elements start to come into play. For one, Halford's vocals are in his Hell Bent-era mold, so the airy highs that the song requires aren't as easy for him to pull off. He does get high, but the sound is very different, much rougher. The extra punch on the guitars is also offset by the loss of Binks' audibility. On Stained Class, he was a major part of the sound, and his lower mixing does actual harm as opposed to the tracks off Hell Bent where he wasn't as big a factor. It's also a factor on Sinner, where he can't seem to hit it hard enough during the chorus to imitate it's studio sound.\n\nLastly, we have the songs from Sad Wings, which take up almost half the original album. Sad Wings functions differently than most albums. It's several great songs with some others that are more mood-continuing than anything else, much akin to an early Queen album. By removing them from their continuity, you take away that atmospheric strength, and you force them to function on their own. Most of these tracks are still roughly equal to their studio counterpart, except Genocide. As many who have reviewed that album mention, it's not a particularly strong song individually. On here, they beef it up, but that's not enough to offset the padding they put on it as well. Personally, I would have rather another track from Stained Class, probably Savage which would have made for a great speedster a la Running WIld.\n\nIn an odd twist, it's the stronger albums that aren't really helped by all of this. I suppose that this is a function of the feeling and atmosphere that those two have in comparison to Hell Bent. That's a good collection of songs, but Sad Wings and Stained Class are artistic statements in every sense of the word. I can easily see why some would prefer this, and it sounds great on paper, but something is lost in translation. The winding, lurching turns of Sad Wings can't be duplicated on here, nor is this as heavy as any of the \"S\" trilogy.\n\nI still enjoy this album. As they say, it's nice to hear different versions of classics, and this is the metal live album for changing things up. As a sort of alternate versions collection, I think some of these are better, but most are essentially equal, and the live atmosphere just doesn't do as much for me as the ones found on the studio versions. I don't find this as essential as their \"S\" trilogy, but it still should be had. It has its own charm and it is possibly the best live album I've ever heard. If you were going to buy a few live metal albums, this needs to be one of them, and I'd say anyone into metal at all should at least give this a shot.\n",
        "\nThis is my favorite band's newest album. It isn't a masterpiece. This is far from the artistic statement of Stained Class, Sad Wings of Destiny, or even Sin After Sin. It also isn't nearly as fun as Screaming For Vengeance, Hell Bent, or Defenders, let alone Painkiller. This is better than their lousier 80's albums like Ram It Down, Turbo, and probably even Point of Entry. I would also take this over their last four. The main weak points are the age to Halford's vocals and the guitar playing. Oddly enough, I think the songwriting is slightly improved from their last few.\n\nHalford's vocals are still good, they just sound different. He doesn't sound like younger Halford minus an octave, he sounds like a good, but nondescript singer. He handles the songs and occasionally he has a moment, but they just don't grab me like many of his younger performances do. It's weird, even his stuff with his solo band sounded more like him. On an interesting note, Halls of Valhalla contains one of his lowest notes of all time. He hits a Bb1, which is about as low as he's ever gotten. For his lyrics, most of them are similar to older songs, but not as overtly as the last couple. There are a few metal cliches, but nothing that directly references a previous song. I found Cold Blooded particularly interesting. A song about a man who is dead in hell is rather intriguing, just for the fact that I've never heard a song cover the topic. I imagine there have been other songs on this topic, but none that I've heard and can recall.\n\nThe guitar playing on this album is a mixed bag. The riffs are alright, but nothing special. Most of the songs don't get too fast, and many that don't aren't very good. The solos also aren't particularly interesting. This all gives a restraining feeling to the album that I could have done without. The production is a little weak as other's have mentioned, but it doesn't bother me very much. The music is decent, but not very special. There are several songs that remind me of Electric Eye put to modern production. I also get a Gamma Ray vibe at times. I think that this is a direction Priest should consider. They could all handle the extra speed of power metal, and it seems like it would make for more of a consistent listen. The last few have felt like they were trying to see what stuck to the wall.\n\nAs usual, I have to strain to try to hear Ian. In this instance, I couldn't. Travis hasn't been able to do anything really exciting since Painkiller. Personally, I think he should get some jazz instructions. If he won't be given the volume and speed to jackhammer, then I believe he should work on his fills. This brings to mind my other idea for what Priest could do next. I would actually be interested in them taking an album in a more groove-direction. Don't read that as Pantera, I mean more like a Melissa type album. If Tipton won't or can't write the riffs like he used to, then give the rhythm a little more room. A metaled up Crossfire with louder bass and drums could work well for an album.\n\nWhy am I giving this album a high rating if I'm not as impressed with the instruments? The songs are better than they've been. The screw-ups on this album aren't as big as Retribution's, nor are they as frequent as Nostradamus'. Dragonaut and March of the Damned are legitimately good songs, and only Down in Flames, Hell & Back, and Secrets of the Dead are really weak. Even their ballad is better than usual. In short, this album could have been Defenders had Halford a better voice left in him. Had Tipton his muse still as well, then this could have been Screaming. As it sits, it's in between Rocka Rolla and Jugulator. \n\nWhat would I recommend of this? I think a Priest fan might want the two I mentioned. An early metal or power metal fan could take a look and might like a little here and there. That's about it. This just isn't necessary or recommendable to anyone else.\n",
        "\nSix years, one false retirement, and departure of K.K. Downing after Nostradamus, Judas Priest has finally released their seventeenth album Redeemer of Souls. It should seem fitting that would could potentially be their final album was released forty years after their debut Rocka Rolla. From the bluesy and hard-rocking 70's albums, to the larger-than-life anthemic 80's albums, to the faster and more aggressive albums of the 90's, to their glorious reunion with Halford, all the way to the ambitious symphonic concept album Nostradamus, Judas Priest has always been able to adapt and evolve with the times. Some may point that as their downfall with their supposed inferior 2000 albums, but it's really a testament to their longevity. For forty years Priest has waved the banner for heavy metal and continue that tradition with Redeemer of Souls. Is it perfect? Of course not. Is it still good? You better believe it.\n\nFirst, I feel the need to get the negatives out of the way. The biggest issue with this album is the mixing and production value. Now while this does not hinder the songs in any significant matter, it's still a bit noticeable. The guitars especially have a drier and somewhat thinner sound than the well-polished and booming Angel of Retribution and Nostradamus. This is most evident on the Painkiller and Angel of Retribution-styled Metalizer. While definitely the fastest and one of the heavier songs on the album, it doesn't command the same kind of power that it could have been capable of. There are even a few (albeit rare) occasions where Rob Halford's voice supercedes the guitars more than is necessary. This is most notable on the title track, as the riffs feel under-mixed beneath Halford's loud verses. While bassist Ian Hill and drummer Scott Travis have never truly at the forefront of the band's sound, they still don't really stand out and continue to play supporting roles here. But considering Priest's sound has always been rooted in the guitars and Halford's voice, the rhythm is not in question here. Ultimately, the production value doesn't really take much from the songs. Some may blame the sound as a result of \"old age\", but it really seems to be a result of the band's desire to produce a rawer sound and overall production issues. It make take a listen or two, but one learns to overlook the production and mixing.\n\nThe band itself still sounds very good. While the guitar solos aren't as crazy and imaginative as they have been on past albums, both Glenn Tipton and K.K. Downing's replacement Richie Faulkner are on top of their games here. As I mentioned before, Ian Hill and Scott Travis are still in the background but keep the rhythm tight. The real standout performance on the album is by Rob Halford. What makes Halford exceptional on this album is that, at sixty-one years old and having spent the past forty years screaming Victim of Changes, Freewheel Burning, and Painkiller, he knows what he can and cannot do. Like Robert Plant, Klaus Meine, and Bruce Dickinson, his voice has aged smoothly and comfortably. With Halford keeping most songs at the low tenor/high baritone level with a slight rasp, not only can he still keep up with the music, but he can still convey the emotion in the lyrics and command power. He can even hit some shrieks at a reasonable yet impressive level. There's no way he could do Blood Red Skies at an 80's level anymore, but he doesn't need to. No songs better show what Rob Halford is still capable of than Halls of Valhalla and Sword of Damocles, as he sings, screams, and even growls his way across the former and hits the falsetto on the latter.\n\nOne sin that this album is free from is filler. Even at eighteen songs and a nearly hour and a half run time for the bonus edition, each song has its own identity and sound. Despite the fact that most songs are mid-paced, Priest finds an excellent balance between melody, speed, heaviness, and style. While not the all-out speed fests reminiscent of Painkiller and Angel of Retribution, Dragonaut, Metalizer, Battle Cry serve as a nice contrast to the more mid-paced (yet still powerful) songs like Sword of Damocles and Hell and Back. The same can be said for the extremely catchy Down in Flames. Cold Blooded also deserves recognition as it keeps an excellent balance between melody and heaviness. There's also a fair degree of familiarity. The title track is reminiscent of the marching riff from Hell Patrol, Secrets of the Dead hearkens back to darker songs like A Touch of Evil and cuts from Nostradamus, and Bring it On has a similar swagger to Worth Fighting For. While March of the Damned may not be one of the strongest tracks, it has the undeniable feel of a classic Priest anthem. The band even expands into different styles and genres, with Snakebite having an AC/DC feel and Crossfire being a tribute to the blues. Even the ballads are in top form, as both Beginning of the End and Never Forget carry plenty of heart-felt emotion without becoming sappy. Both songs are notable in the fact that they serve as possible farewells to the fans, with Beginning of the End containing death metaphors and Never Forget being a thank you to their loyal, long-time fanbase. However, if there's one undisputed champion of the album, it's the epic Halls of Valhalla. From the arrival of the opening riff to Halford's shrieks and anthemic chorus, Halls absolutely delivers.\n\nAll in all, this is a very solid release. Don't set yourself up to be immediately satisfied though, it may take another few listens before one can truly begin to appreciate what Priest did here. The only real drawback here is the somewhat dry and occasionally uneven production value, but it really doesn't take all that much from the songs. Judas Priest may be forty years old, but they've grown into their age comfortably and know how to deliver even this late in the game. Anyone expecting another Screaming for Vengeance, Defenders of the Faith, or Painkiller is being unrealistic. But if one is looking for a very solid, well-rounded album by one of the most experienced metal acts today, look no further. I'm sure Priest is stopping themselves short from announcing another retirement, but if Redeemer of Souls does indeed become their swan song, then they'll have gone out in a \"blaze of glory\", to quote from Down in Flames.\n",
        "\nWith all the hubbub that has already built up over the release of Judas Priest's seventeenth studio album, I can't help but find parallels between it and 1997's Jugulator. A lot of pressure has been on the band as Redeemer of Souls is their first album since the controversial Nostradamus came out in 2008, the first to feature guitarist Richie Faulkner in place of founding shredder K. K. Downing, and is here amidst a three year strong \"farewell tour\" and rumors of a hiatus. But like Jugulator, it's a flawed effort that does make for a fun listen.\n\nIn a way similar to 2005's Angel of Retribution, Redeemer of Souls serves as a sampler of the different sounds that Priest's tried out through their career. The classic 80s albums are predictably referenced the most as the band often aims for accessible rockers when they aren't trying to rewrite Painkiller. There are a few exceptions to the rule as \"Crossfire\" rides a 70s blues groove, the plodding \"Secrets of the Dead\" invokes Rob Halford's Fight project, and \"Sword of Damocles\" is a theatrical waltz that sounds like something Blind Guardian would've put together.\n\nOf course, the band members' performances appear to be the biggest point of contention and they are indeed a mixed bag. Halford can still deliver when he's in his comfort zone and Faulkner adequately keeps up with Glenn Tipton, but the higher screams do show their age and the production does make the guitars sound a little stilted at times. They do fare better than the rhythm section as usual with bassist Ian Hill being as invisible as ever and drummer Scott Travis offering a heavy but rather downplayed performance.\n\nThankfully the songwriting keeps things from straying into bargain bin territory. Things start off strong with \"Dragonaut\" serving as a high speed opener and the title track offering an upbeat groove reminiscent of \"Hell Patrol.\" From there, \"Halls of Valhalla\" and \"Battle Cry\" are borderline epics in the vein of The Headless Children-era WASP, \"Down in Flames\" is a light but energetic rocker, and \"Beginning of the End\" serves as an airy closer. The bonus tracks are also pretty solid as \"Snakebite\" has an AC/DC swagger and \"Never Forget\" is an emotional swan song for Priest's legacy even if it is a bit saccharine...\n\nOverall, Redeemer of Souls is a respectable outing if this does turn out to be Priest's last effort but is still pretty decent if it doesn't. Angel of Retribution was a little better at the sampler approach but there are plenty of songs to like even if there isn't an honest to god classic among them. I'd check in with Accept or Queensryche if you want to see 80s metal still going strong but this is certainly better than Nostradamus...\n\nOriginally published at http://psychicshorts.blogspot.com\n",
        "\nThis album sits in-between Sad Wings of Destiny and Stained Class. I can count on one hand the albums more influential to metal. The number of albums better is similar in scarcity. Sin After Sin is not as great as those two, but it is still amongst the very best Priest ever mustered. Most of the contributors are in good form for this, the songwriting is pretty good, and there are some classics on here.\n\nThe guitarists on here are superb. The riffing on the non-ballads is very good. It does have a hard-rock vibe as often as not, but the songs themselves are pretty definitely metal. The soloing on here is worth noting. This is Priest's first album to have their high-end oriented sound, so their famous piercing, screaming guitar leads are on full-strength here. The solos on Sinner, Starbreaker, and Dissident Aggressor immediately come to mind. The first and last also showcase another aspect. Downing was the first metal guitarist to specialize in atonal whammy-abuse solos. Many hate this kind of soloing, but it is at least interesting to see it's origins.\n\nThe drumming, is one of Priest's first good ones. The session drummer, Simon Phillips, was very technical for the time. He shows good use of the double-bass for a drummer of this time period, and he has been cited by many metal drummers as inspirational. Due to prior commitments, he declined to join Priest, but his replacement was even better. Ian isn't really special on this one. I would say that this is the first Priest album where Ian isn't really contributing. He can be heard, barely, but he does much less of interest compared to Sad Wings.\n\nSome have argued that this is Halford's best outing, and it is very possible. Halford's vocals in his prime were something. The range, vocal control, and consistency are pretty much the pinnacle for a clean metal vocalist. Dio and Dickinson can take him for power, but that is all. As far as rock vocalists go, Freddie Mercury and maybe Ian Gillan could match him. This is where Halford first really milked his lower pitch for an album, but there's still plenty of high notes. Lyrically, this is one of Priest's better albums. Sinner, Call For the Priest, and Dissident Aggressor would be well-written metal songs in any era.\n\nI touched upon the production earlier, it is higher pitched. It was apparently state-of-the-art for the time. I don't feel that it serves the music very well. It's more fitting than the debut, but the adjacent albums used their weaker production to invoke very heavy atmospheres. This can't do that. Also, for being big, it's kind of thin at times. I'm not sure how, but it sounds like the studio just inflated the sound like a balloon. If they wanted it louder, I would have rather them simply double-tracked or something. One thing for it's atmosphere, it has a very Gothic feel. The mausoleum on the front and the very depressing songs give it a depressed feel at times. I would rather a heavy feel, but this is rather unique in their catalog.\n\nAll in all, this is a pretty good effort. This isn't as good as the adjoining masterpieces, or Painkiller later, but this is still better than their 80's albums. Nothing troughs as badly as Take These Chains, United, or the goofy duo that ends Defenders. This also contains much of Priest's 70's aura. It is hard to put into words, but there is an art to what Priest did around this time. They took the dull, thudding instrument that Sabbath had forged, and they forged it into a sharp-edged rapier. This feel doesn't get to shine as well here, but it is still unmistakable. This is recommended to all fans of early metal and hard-rock.\n",
        "\nNew album's hype coming from a \u201cbig band\u201d (and with \u201cbig\u201d I mean successful, famous, etc.) it\u2019s always so high that is hard for me to believe, and I don\u2019t even know why. Well, I actually understand why, but I think it\u2019s kind of unnecessary considering the fact that these guys are not even in their prime anymore, some of them are around their sixties (with the exception of Richie Faulkner, the new guitarist). So the question is: do you actually expect them to surpass their best albums? \n\nPersonally, I don\u2019t think so, and the reason is because they got nothing to lose, they already are a legend, they had made history and last but not least, they got tons of money, so even if this album doesn\u2019t sell too well, they should not care too much. There are always two options: release something new and different or keep doing the same, and it doesn\u2019t matter the choice, people will always complain anyway. So I guess Judas Priest chose the last one, they didn\u2019t take a risk and gave people what they like.\n\nSo what does the album sound like? I would say this album summarizes more or less Judas Priest's career. There are moments that could have been in Stained Class, Sad Wings of Destiny or Painkiller, it surely sounds like Judas Priest, but I think is kind of generic. I feel like most of the main features are just there for the sake of being there and not because they feel passionate about them. It\u2019s like: \u201cOh yeah, we\u2019re going to make a song about a badass guy who\u2019s coming for you because classic Judas Priest used to have one or two\u201d or \u201cWe need to sound exactly like this because classic Priest used to\u201d\n\nMost of the album is mid-paced, with some exceptions like: Metalizer, Dragonaut and Battle Cry. As I previously said, there\u2019s your Painkiller-esque song, there\u2019s an epic ballad, there\u2019s a song that sounds very similar to Hell Patrol and a lot of heavy riffing styled ones. Also, I think they kind of ripped-off a riff from Sign of the Crimson Storm by Riot in their song March of the Damned, and the intro from I by Black Sabbath in Crossfire, but maybe that's just me. Another problem I find is that this album is too long, get rid of few songs and there you go. I liked Dragonaut and Halls of Valhalla though. The production is alright, I\u2019m not an expert in this subject, so if I can listen to all the instruments is fine for me. That said, this is not an awful album, it\u2019s funny to listen, but certainly they didn\u2019t try hard.\n\nSo that\u2019s pretty much the whole thing. It\u2019s a decent try by these heavy metal legends and I acknowledge their effort, but at this point I feel like they don\u2019t need to prove anything, they\u2019re pretty much there for the money. Of course hardcore fans will find this appealing, but for the rest of us better stick to the classic albums.\n",
        "\nJudas Priest is one of the most influential metal bands of all times that released many world class records between their blues, rock \u2018n roll and progressive rock infused debut \u201cRocka Rolla\u201d in 1974 and their aggressive and more speed and thrash metal influenced \u201cPainkiller\u201d in 1990. I even adored the controversial \u201cJugulator\u201d in 1997 that headed for a dark groove and industrial metal approach with a vivid new singer and I\u2019m glad that this record finally got some re-evaluation and recognition over the past years. The last three Judas Priest records \u201cDemolition\u201d, \u201cAngel Of Retribution\u201d and \u201cNostradamus\u201d were though of a good average quality at best. Judas Priest still have their moments at several live shows and I would go see the band in concert anytime but it isn\u2019t for their more recent material. \u201cRedeemer Of Souls\u201d is pretty much on the same level as the previous three outputs. It\u2019s an average record with a few highlights and a few more fillers.\n\nI feel that this record is only slightly better than the boring, inconsistent and overlong \u201cNostradamus\u201d but it\u2019s on the same level or even slightly below the comeback record \u201cAngel Of Retribution\u201d and even the hit and miss record \u201cDemolition\u201d. Judas Priest delivers predictable mid-tempo heavy metal stompers where everybody performs in a very solid way but apart of new guitarist Richie Faulkner nobody really performs with unchained passion. The record is okay but if the name Judas Priest wasn\u2019t written on the album cover, not many people would care about this old-fashioned release. While comparable bands like Aria, Iron Maiden and Loudness still have the pace, the passion and the will to experiment here and there, Judas Priest sound like they never arrived in the new millennium.\n\nThe new record kicks of well with the dynamical mid-tempo stomper \u201cDragonaut\u201d and the catchy and more melodic title track \u201cRedeemer Of Souls\u201d but you soon realize that many tracks sound quite alike. Many songs sound like reinvented and slowed down tracks from classic records like \u201cPainkiller\u201d or \u201cScreaming For Vengeance\u201d. A good example is the longest track on the regular version which happens to be \u201cGates Of Valhalla\u201d. The mid-tempo song tries to be heavy and anthemic leading to a simplistic but powerful chorus and I\u2019m sure it will be a great live song. On the other side, I feel like I\u2019ve heard very similar and better executed songs by Judas Priest in the past. It\u2019s the same thing with the faster \u201cBattle Cry\u201d which is probably the heaviest track on the album but it simply sounds like a cheap \u201cPainkiller\u201d rehash. These kind of songs would have been original and passionate thirty years ago but today it feels old-fashioned and will only please to nostalgic heavy metal fans and die-hard Judas Priest maniacs. \n\nA couple of songs start in a promising way as if the band wanted to try out something new. The beginning of \u201cHell & Back\u201d has a slightly melancholic and ballad orientated touch but it ends up being another standard mid-tempo track. \u201cCold Blooded\u201d sounds much better because the calmer and psychedelic parts are recurring elements throughout the entire track and because Rob Halford tries to sing in a more longing manner than usual. Logically, it\u2019s one of the better songs on the record but the band should have sounded even more atmospheric and original to really impress me here. The band finally evolves in a more distinguished way with the closing blues and psychedelic rock infused ballad \u201cBeginning Of The End\u201d. It\u2019s maybe not the best song on the album because it sounds a little bit too tame to me but there is no doubt that this is by far the most original track by Judas Priest in 2014.\n\nThe limited edition of the album includes a second disk with five more songs that can\u2019t really impress. The melodic and slow ballad \u201cNever Forget\u201d would have been an emotional closure if Rob Halford\u2019s powerless vocals had sounded a little bit more passionate. The track feels somewhat strange as if this last track of the special edition was the very last song of Judas Priest\u2019s entire career. It saddens me to realize that these old heroes might soon be history and that they end their career in such a lackluster manner.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s time for these legends to go and maybe they should have gone much earlier as well. I\u2019m a quite big fan of anything Judas Priest released between 1974 and 1997 and I really wanted this new record to be a return to form for the British legends. I didn\u2019t really believe in this miracle and the album sounds as if the band believed even less in itself. The final result is a lukewarm and old-fashioned mid-tempo heavy metal release with too many fillers, a tame instrumental and vocal performance and a sad rehash of idea\u2019s from glorious past days. Maybe Judas Priest will carry on because it would be disappointing to leave with such a weak release but on the other side it\u2019s hard to believe that this band can still improve and progress at this point.\n\nMy final rating is probably still a little bit too generous but I take into consideration how old this band is, that they had to deal with an important line-up Change recently and that this record would have had a better Impression on me if it had been released thirty years in the past with a Rob Halford in top form. As it now turns out, this record is for a few extremely faithful Judas Priest fans and truly nostalgic heavy metal fans only. Everybody else will either feel bored or sad about this record or both just like me.\n",
        "\nWhere to begin with this review? I mean, come on, it's Judas Priest. The Metal Gods. This band defined heavy metal for the generations that followed. There's no question that this band single-handedly took what Sabbath started and refined it to create heavy metal as we know it. It actually pains me to write this review because Judas Priest was my first metal band back with the release of Unleashed in the East. I blew my the speakers on my parent's console stereo while losing my voice trying to emulate Rob's vocals on The Green Manalishi at 13 when my voice was changing, facing possible damage to my young tender vocal chords. This was music like I've never heard...a young metal head had been born!\n\nIf you look at it, this band has only had a few periods where they had consistently quality albums. The 70s were the period where the band produced some the finest metal the world has ever known. The 80s were loaded with radio friendly songs due to the band having commercial success. Painkiller in 1990 is lauded as setting the bar for future Priest releases. The 90s and into the early 2000s...well, we won't even go there. In 2003 Rob Halford returned to the fold and it seemed all would be right with the world. After one okay album and one absolute catastrophe 2014 brings us a new Judas Priest album, Redeemer of Souls. The hype leading up to this album was the band making statements of this being the heaviest they've done in years. The teasers released were even decent enough for me to be cautiously optimistic. Sadly, the finished product is not what I expected at all. Instead we have an album that is inconsistent with a few songs being good but most being mediocre at best.\n\nSo let's start with what's good about this album. The band starts off good with \"Dragonaut.\" The title is silly but the song is pretty good. The song has a nice riff in the beginning and has high energy. It is a decent album opener. Actually the only other high energy song on the album worthy of being an opener would have been \"Battle Cry.\" The title track is also a song that can be catchy at times and is one of the songs that got my hopes up for this album. \"Sword of Damocles\" has a really cool 70s vibe in the opening riffs, a catchy chorus, and is actually a pretty cool song. The solos on these songs are good as Ritchie Faulkner is a worthy replacement for K.K. Downing as far as solos go. Another song that just screams 70s Priest is \"Crossfire.\" This song could have been on Sin After Sin...maybe only as filler but it still could have been on there. That bluesy riffing has always worked with Priest and it still does after all these years. Even Rob hits some high notes, which is rare on this album. His voice is competent since he's always had a good tenor and baritone to his voice. This is the best song on the album and the best song the band has written in a long time.\n\nWell, that's it folks. The rest of the album is just plain mediocre. \"Halls of Valhalla\" shows the band over reaching as they did on Nostradamus. It may have been a better song if they shaved about two to three minutes from it but at six minutes long it becomes redundant. Same with \"Secrets of the Dead.\" In fact that song sounds like a leftover from Nostradamus. \"March of the Damned\" sounds so safe and Halford's vocals are so monotone he actually sounds like Ozzy in places. \"Hell & Back\" is just awful. It begins like a ballad and although it picks up the pace a bit, it just doesn't keep me interested. Instead it plods along with no balls or direction. The chorus isn't even that catchy. \"Metalizer\" is the worst offender because you can tell the band is trying way to hard to be heavy and it just doesn't come off the way it should have. Not sure if it was the production or what but it just doesn't work. The riffing is just chugging riffs that sound like they could be heavy but instead they just plod along. It's speedy in places but not enough to save it. The solos are the only thing that's good about this song.\n\nI'm torn because this could have been a better album. There is proof on this very album that this band still has some chops and can still write catchy tunes. I'm not sure what they were trying to do with some of these songs but sometimes the \"let's try to be heavy again just to be heavy\" doesn't work. Instead it comes off as old men trying to capture some of their former glory. It's embarrassing. Some claim this is the best they've done since Painkiller, and they are right. But what is that really saying? It's the best of their worst? I'm not sure what the future holds for this band. I really wanted to love this album but there's so little to love.\n",
        "\nThe name of Judas Priest has become synonymous with heavy metal, equally if not more so than fellow Birmingham pioneers Black Sabbath. It's all but impossible to observe the evolution of old guard USPM, several strains of German speed/power metal, the current early 80s heavy metal revival, and even several prime movers in thrash metal without seeing the mark of their influence. As such, it is likewise assume in certain quarters that their legendary status has relegated them to a present curiosity, rather than a still formidable metallic machine capable of delivering the goods in this day and age. While their output has been a bit slower of late as opposed to their high period from mid 70s to the early 90s, they've been relatively consistent in the quality department, barring the occasional hiccup here and there, and their latest endeavor Redeemer Of Souls is more the rule than the exception.\n\nIf an instant feeling of familiarity doesn't hit the average metal maniac at first view of the album cover (which features a gloriously modernized version of what appears to be the original Painkiller), the music contained within brings back memories of bygone days quicker than one could utter \"Metal Gods\". The exodus of longtime axe man K.K. Downing hasn't done much to deter the guitar onslaught typical to this band, though the introduction of newcomer Richie Faulkner does present a slightly looser feel, with two diverging rhythm paths forming to make for a slightly freer, less mechanistic feel in line with a slightly progressive character. However, the general character of this album is definitely a throwback, but more towards the early 80s mold of Screaming For Vengeance and Defenders Of The Faith than the modern Painkiller character that typified much of Angel Of Retribution, though this album definitely tilts a bit more towards said 2005 comeback in terms of compactness than the experimental, epic concept album of a predecessor in Nostradamus.\n\nPerhaps most surprising about this album is the lack of out and out speed monsters, culminating in an album that tends to feel more rocking and upper-mid tempo than an outright fireball of metallic insanity. Even would be speeders in \"Metalizer\" and \"Battle Cry\" are noticeably restrained compared to the likes of \"Ram It Down\" or \"Metal Meltdown\", coming off more like the fast but not quite blinding character of this band's faster works prior to \"Freewheel Burning\". Much of this album spends its moderated up tempo land in a heavy, punchy mode with a good array of catchy and reasonably flashy songs in \"Dragonaut\", \"Redeemer Of Souls\" and \"Down In Flames\", the latter of which almost wants to cross into \"Point Of Entry\" at times. Indeed, a number of the slower songs on here almost want to try to merge elements of Priest's mid-80s commercial era with their older, crunchier sound, and the results prove to be fairly gripping in the cases of \"Cold Blooded\" and the rocking semi-ballad \"Hell & Back\".\n\nWhile this album tends to play it a little safe at times and falls back on elements more regularly associated with Priest's early 80s era, which is generally their most widely praised, they do have a couple riskier moments on here that should be noted. The more bluesy and almost Black Sabbath oriented \"Crossfire\" tends to reach back a bit further into this band's mid to late 70s era, which functions as an apt yet somewhat out of place nod to the band's oldest fans. On the other hand, the longer and adventurous \"Halls Of Valhalla\" is an absolute winner, embodying every single thing that was great about 80s Judas Priest, including a somewhat more animated vocal performance out of Halford (who is showing his age a bit, but is still able to belt out his banshee wails proficiently) and a tasty deluge of lead guitar gymnastics right out of the Painkiller mode.\n\nAfter more than 40 years in the business, if nothing else, Judas Priest has showcased that advancing ages doesn't mean hanging up your songwriting suit and being relegated your own tribute band. While definitely not the most astounding of their studio endeavors, it stands in stark contrast to the recent outing of Black Sabbath, and also puts a lot of their younger imitators on notice as to how this game should continue to be played. Although I wasn't terribly disappointed in Nostradamus, this is more along the lines of what Halford and company do best, writing moderate length, straightforward heavy metal with just a bit more edge and attitude than the average leather-toting fanatic. Rain the fury of a million flames from the sky and may the redeemer have mercy upon trembling masses.\n",
        "\nI'm a pretty big Priest fan, they're the band that got me into metal. They have a very deep catalog, and several great albums. This isn't a great Priest album. This is just bad. Along with Turbo and Demolition, this seriously contends for their worst album. The only really good thing about this album is the guitar playing.\n\nStarting with that, yes the guitar playing is superb. It had probably been ten years since Priest's guitar playing would have been considered even somewhat technical. This is different. Priest had been learning in this decade, and they showed a good deal off in the solos on this album. The riffing is also Priest's usual level, a bit more advanced, but still at the same quality. The only real problem is that the synthesizers are still present on this album. Priest did not use the synthesizers well on Turbo and they really aren't much better here. Don't get me wrong, I don't hate synthesizers. Priest just didn't use them well.\n\nHalford's singing on this album is essentially to par as well. He doesn't sound like usual here. Halford was beginning to incorporate the shrieking he would utilize on Painkiller. He isn't all the way there, but he's close. To me, this isn't as good as that sounds. Halford had one foot in the old and one looking forward, so it doesn't sound ideal.\n\nIan hasn't been a force in their sound is some time, and this is no different. Holland apparently was ill and unable to do some of the drumming, so they got a machine to do some of the songs. I don't too much mind this, as he really didn't do much more than a machine anyways. This is also Holland's last album, which is pretty good. His replacement was several notches better, and Holland ended up being a less than great individual. I often ponder if this is part of the reason Priest has never made the Hall of Fame. The people in the Hall have inducted a couple of metal bands. I have wondered if Halford's defense of Holland isn't part of it. The Hall of Fame would loathe to induct a convicted child-molester, but it would be hard to leave out one of their longer-tenured members, especially one that a major member seems to consider a friend.\n\nThe biggest problem is the songwriting. It's just awful. Turbo was cheesy, this is just dreadful. You have a song about Golems and what is easily the worst cover of Priest's career. Diamonds and Rust and The Green Manalishi were gems, Johnny B. Goode is horrid. I have no idea how this got nominated for any sort of award. On a related issue is the total lack of focus. Some of these songs are left over from Turbo, and it wrecks the consistency. Priest were known for unnecessary love ballads, but they also weren't usually this aggressive. The end result is like Take These Chains on Painkiller, It makes no sense.\n\nI do enjoy Hard as Iron from time to time, and the title track isn't horrible. This caught Priest in a transition, and it shows. I honestly think Turbo was probably better, at least it had an idea in mind. This is Priest in Limbo, but they did get better. Their next album is much better, and calling this Painkiller Jr. just insults Painkiller. Anyone who criticizes the lyrics on Painkiller really needs to read these. My recommendation is that Priest fans might want the two tracks I mentioned. Everyone else can do without those two, let alone the rest of this garbage heap.\n",
        "\nThis is Priest's best selling and charting album. Apparently when it came out, they even used the Hellion to sell cars. I don't view this as Priest's best, or even contending, but it is the best they did during the 80's. It's got some very good stuff going on, Halford brought back his high notes, the music is very fun, and very little of this run time is bad.\n\nConsidering the last three albums, it seemed Halford was phasing out his higher register. The trend is reversed here, and he's using every area of his range. The result is quite nice, and these are some of Halford's best songs. His mid-range, with a slight mechanical tone, on Electric Eye is fantastic. His vocals on Screaming For Vengeance are as close to his Painkiller vocals as he had gotten thus far. The guitar playing is quite good. The duo do as well as would be expected in the riff department. The majority of this album is very nice, even by Priest's high standards of riffing. The solos are almost as good. They didn't yet have quite the level of response that they would have on the succeeding album, but this is close. They had learned a few of the new tricks, and while they weren't to Painkiller technically, they were definitely up from British Steel. \n\nProbably the biggest selling point, commercially and metal-wise, for this album is the tightrope that it walks. This managed to take most of their metal traits and package it with a fun, hard-rock vibe. This definitely is fun music, with more atmospheric commonality to AC/DC than Bathory. It's hard to pin-point how they manage this, but I'm thinking that it has to do the brevity of the tracks and the lightness of the lyrics. None of these tracks are epic length which was good for the rock-metal fans that didn't want much complexity to their music. The lyrics themselves are fairly catchy and seldom attempt serious subject matter. The exception is Electric Eye, which was probably the last set of good lyrics that they ever wrote. Now for metal fans who aren't as interested in the rock-metal variety, there is something to be said for variety. There isn't a ton of metal that pulls off \"fun\" without being dumb. Many even feel that Anthrax failed, which goes to show how hard it is. Almost no one ever really criticizes this for it's fun, as it does this better than pretty much any other attempt at \"fun\" metal that I've heard. Priest also achieved this on a few other albums, but this is the strongest example.\n\nThe rhythm section is as weak as ever during this time. Ian doesn't have any real moment to shine, and he isn't very audible either. The drumming is probably worse. With Priest speeding up the music, it is clear how much Holland isn't cut out for this. Part of me wonders if the band understood what getting rid of Binks would mean to future compositions. In any case, this is one of the main failures of this era of Priest in general, is their weak rhythm. Supposedly, Priest even had to either keep the pace and complexity down or get a machine in order to make things doable for Holland. I don't know if this is true, but the music hardly debunks this theory. The other weak spot to this album is the middle. Take These Chains and Pain and Pleasure are examples of 80's commercial songwriting that has aged horribly. I've no idea why the band thought these were good ideas, but they are there nonetheless and do nothing but blow a hole in the middle of the album. This does have one of the few bonus tracks from the remasters that are worth hearing. Prisoner of Your Eyes isn't Dreamer Deceiver, but it's a big step-up from their norm. Between some legitimately tense playing and atmosphere, this is one of their best 3-4 ballads\n\nThis is the best Priest did between Stained Class and Painkiller. I have it as a fraction greater than Hell Bent For Leather owing to it's more consistent track-list. The margin is small, but I only have two points between them. I view the year of this release functions as a changing of the guard. Essentially, this is the last year where all the best albums were of the early metal variety. Metal was about to splinter into many directions, and would stay that way. As to who would enjoy this, the power and thrash that split off are the main ones, along with the previous early metal and hard-rock fans.\n",
        "\nThis is possibly the greatest metal album of all time. It's the source of my username. I've probably heard every song on this album about fifty to a hundred times, and it doesn't get old. The compositions, lyrics, instrumentation, vocals, and songs themselves are mostly perfect. There is not a single metal band, excluding doom and the stuff this site doesn't consider metal, that doesn't draw influence from this album. Bands from Slayer to Helloween praise it as a major influence and inspiration for them.\n\nThis cover is in the pantheon, for it just seems to epitomize so much of early Priest, the darkness contrasted with the fineness like a morbid, metal version of classic Queen. Whenever I look at it, I associate it with Halford for some reason. The cape or robe he seems to be wearing is not unlike that of Halford's stage get-up, and there's just something about looking at it that makes me think Halford is that guy. On an artistic level, I interpret the glittering rod through his head as a sign of man's reliance on technology and his turning away from nature. That would somewhat fit the lyrics, but i'm not an art critic. On a related note, you really can't find this on any t-shirts or clothing, I've tried. \n\nThe songwriting here is pretty much as good as Priest ever were. The music enough twists and turns to keep the longer songs interesting. The light and shade switch on Beyond the Realms of Death is perfection. The lyrics are also headier than anything Priest would do afterwards. Tales of far away forces wreaking havoc, man's own feebleness and decline, and his inability to tolerate his existence is way past anything in their future, save possibly Electric Eye. Compared to previous albums, lyrics aren't particularly better, but they are heavier. Tyrant and Dissident Aggressor were heavy, almost-thrash, but there was only one of those on each album. This has about five around their level. That's not to say that Priest don't have any songs that aren't meant to be more playful. The White Heat and Better By You combo don't have light lyrics, but they're not as heavy and lean on being almost danceable.\n\nThe guitar playing is as rifftacular as usual. Most of the riffs are very heavy, and quite a few are fast as well. This combination is part of what made Priest stick out from many of their peers. The hard-rock bands couldn't match either of these, Sabbath couldn't get this fast, and Motorhead couldn't get this heavy. The soloing isn't super technical, but compared to 1978, there wasn't much better. It's got a pretty good feel, and it's also fast at times. To an extent, it seems to me that Priest's dueling solos were set-up differently on the earlier albums. These are more normal length solos following each other. The succeeding albums would feature more of an alternating licks approach. I associate them more for the latter, but the former does allow for more expression on several songs.\n\nThe drumming is quite good and technical for it's time. The stuff Les Binks was doing was not common in any form of rock or metal. It honestly would be another decade before stuff he was doing on here became common, such as frequent double-bass, rolls, fills, and some good aggression. This sounds ordinary, but this was still largely limited to fusion and prog at the time. His shining moment to me is on Savage. To me the song feels almost drum-driven and has plenty of good fills and rolls, typical of his style on the album. The bass is pretty much as usual. I don't view this as Ian's best, or even close. The thing is though, that the difference between his best and his average isn't much. \n\nThe vocals are a little different for Halford. This is one of his younger performances, so the highs are beautiful. The difference is mainly how their mixed and their predominance. They sound almost airy for large parts of the album, like he's a specter delivering the lyrics. He also doesn't vary his pitch very much. I don't view this as a problem, as his highs are his signature, and this is essentially their peak. The track Saints In Hell is the major example of this. I had to read along with the lyrics several times to really figure out what he was saying. On a qualitative note, I think this is possibly the greatest vocal performance in metal history. Most metal vocalists can't keep their natural sound as they reach their ceiling. Even Dio can't maintain his roar, and Dickinson sounds like their in a vice towards the top. Halford doesn't really have this problem, and it's almost inhuman how consistent his voice is as his register heightens.\n\nThe songs themselves are pretty much excellent from start to finish. I suppose Invader would be the weak one, but it's relative. I do love that slower section that starts with \"When they come to take control.\" It's just cool, and it makes you stop what you're doing in the way an anthem would. I've always found it odd how much Exciter and Painkiller resemble each other, but it doesn't really reduce either song in my eyes. Suffices to say, if you've heard Painkiller, this will sound very familiar. I could pretty much say the same thing for Beyond the Realms of Death and Fade to Black. I somewhat prefer the former, and it really is one of the greatest metal songs of all time. Everyone has heard the story of Binks piddling on a guitar creating the unusual acoustic rhythm and Tipton writing most of the rest of the music, though if you haven't, there it is. I implied this previously, but this is essentially the template for 80's metal epic ballads. From Maiden to Metallica to Testament, this is the first that served as the blueprint. As far as these epics go, I'd still say that this is the best.\n\nI do find giving perfect scores odd, but I see this as a serious contender for the greatest metal album of all time. That is an entire genre that this is maybe the best of. Beyond the Realms of Death is also probably one of the ten or so greatest metal songs of all time, with Exciter, the title track, and Saints in Hell being serious contenders for the top 100. The only shame I see is in hindsight. Priest never did anything this good again. Painkiller and a few others were awesome, but not in the total way that this is. This album takes you to a different place, the place of its pain, and forces you to endure it. After this, Priest took a more commercial turn with Killing Machine/ Hell Bent for Leather and the lyrics, more complex song structures, and even some of the speed left. They continued to occasionally craft a very good and even one great album later, but nothing genre-defining, except perhaps Painkiller to modern German power metal. I'm not gonna merely recommend this, this flat out is necessary for any metal fan. This is probably too aggressive for most hard-rock fans, but really fans of early, thrash, and power would probably love this.\n",
        "\nTo my mind this is Judas Priest's seventh best album. For most bands, that would make this garbage, but Priest were a strong band. For as much had decayed from their greatest years, this is still a good album. It suffers largely from annoying 80's cliches that renders almost half the album comletely uninteresting.\n\nI'll start with the guitars, as they're possibly the best aspect of the album. The riffs to songs like Freewheel Burning and The Sentinel are really, really good. The leads are even better though. I can't put my finger on why, but this just seems their most synchronized display of soloing. Each and every solo is matched by another in perfect succession, and for the last time their leads are roughly equal. After this, Tipton began to really dominate the soloing, which I think is why people often associate Tipton as being the greater guitarist, which I don't disagree with so much as find the near-unanimity odd. I recall watching one of their live concerts on TV from this era, and Tipton definitely had more of an arrogance to him on stage than KK had. His ego pushing Downing out was my first thought. My second is that as Tipton absorbed the new techniques first, he decided to give himself more solos to show them off. I don't know which it is, but considering the way KK worded his departure, I tend to think the former may have at least been on his mind.\n\nThe next great aspect about this album are Halford's vocals. He gives one of the best performances of his career on The Sentinel, and he's pretty good elsewhere. Supposedly, it was around this time that Halford kicked his addictions, but I don't hear any real improvement. Honestly, I like his vocals on the previous album better, and I think he just sounds his normal, high, quality here as opposed to some new heights. Compared to Screaming, these vocals are more heavily slanted to his gritter hard-rock style. He definitely has some great screeches, but they're not as common as they were on Vengeance. \n\nMy metal and really music interest in general began with 70's bands, including Priest, and most of those bands worth hearing had a strong rhythm section and some good progressive songwriting. This era of Priest has neither of those, and so it leans far more heavily for me on its track by track impact. I've mentioned the two classics, and one could toss the whole of the first five into the success pile. Eat Me Alive is a little different for two reasons. The first is that it's a good deal more aggressive than the rest of the album, so it seems almost out of place from the start. The second are the infamous lyrics; they're dreadful and pretty easy to make out. The two ballads afterwards don't do much for me, and the attempt at an anthemic stomper is boring. There's something about the cliches of the 80's that have aged far more poorly than that of the 70's. The latter is that of rock music stretching out into uncharted new territories, and the mistakes are still listenable to some degree. The 80's, goaded by god knows what, spurned these gains and went straight for the allure of singles, thus creating such pandering cretins as what squats at the end of this album.\n\nOne could argue that it's unfair to criticize an album on the basis of what was common in its time, but Priest predated this trend, and they could have chosen otherwise. They showed an entire generation of metal bands how to craft epics with Beyond the Realms of Death and Dreamer Deceiver still stands as one of the greatest metal ballads of all-time. They also knew what they were doing when they dumbed down the lyrics and kicked out Binks. Priest chose financial success over consistent quality, and this album's second half is part of what paid the price. Obviously this is still one of their better albums, but it's nowhere near a must for metal fans like a few others are. This is just recommended to fans of early metal and hard-rock, or at least the better songs are.\n",
        "\nStreamlined and simplified is the most obvious way to compare this album to the band's previous works, and while I'm usually leery of simplification for sales purposes, this is still quite nice. This is pretty distinct from the albums that came before, and it ushered in a new era for Priest. This was the beginning of their most successful period, but not their best in terms of musical quality.\n\nThe most obvious difference is in that of the songs. Prior to this, Priest had a progressive influence that showed up in the way of epics and relatively atmospheric ballads. Gone is Beyond the Realms of Death, Sinner, and Dreamer Deceiver. These are replaced by songs like Evening Star and Before the Dawn. This album brings in much more hard-rock influence. A song such as Killing Machine brings to mind some of Kiss' more grooving numbers, and their first stab at an anthem bears a stinking resemblance to one of Queen's weakest moments, the bane of every sport's fan. Whereas previously Priest were trying to get heavier and faster, here they get much lighter. Delivering the Goods and the other title track are fairly fast, but they both come with a more \"fun\" vibe than before. \n\nIt's worth stating now that I don't view this shift as a complete loss. The two title tracks and Delivering the Goods are the three best songs on here, but the album as a whole isn't as out there and boundary-pushing as the previous albums had been. Priest are still making good music, but there's no sense of awe at the artistry and craftsmanship like their was before. Instead of engineering the future of metal, they're creating a Frankenstein out of 'roided-up parts of AC/DC and Kiss. As my analogy implies, this just isn't as consistent and cohesive as the last three albums had been. It's very fun and catchy, but it lacks what the \"S\" trilogy had backing up the music.\n\nHalford is still great on this album, though his performance isn't as good as the ones before. He utilizes fewer screams on this album, but he doesn't abandon them completely. What he does abandon is the spectral quality. Halford continued to have great vocals, but he never went for the spectral approach after Stained Class. Binks is an interesting case on this album. This is his other studio album with them, and it's not as good of a performance as previous. His sacking was an interesting circumstance of a band actually wanting a simpler performer, and Holland certainly fit that bill. Delivering the Goods actually has a drum solo at the end of the song. In of itself, it's not particularly interesting or impressive, but it takes on greater meaning in the context of the surroundings. The solo allows you to really feel Binks' frustration at the shift in sound and the restrictions that it imposed on him. It's a shame they didn't go back and get him when they beefed it back up a few years later.\n\nThere are a few similarities and even improvements that can be found on here. The production is like that of Stained Class but better. Everything on this album is definitely crisper and louder than that of their previous albums. Yes, this does mean that you can often hear Hill. In particular, he does a nice job on Hell Bent. He doesn't have any fills, but he provides the groove to even that speedier number. The guitar players are in a partial transition from their more epic days into their commercial, but their skill and creativity has lost nothing. For as short as it is, that Hell Bent solo is one of their best. Tipton and Downing both wrote some pretty good stuff, both speedy and groovy. That's actually probably the main appeal of this album. Priest could turn on the groove for a song or two, but this is the first time they attempted for the groove to carry much of the music. On Killing Machine, Green Manalishi, and Burnin' Up, it works exquisitely.\n\nThis simplification took away a few of Priest's strong points, and they would forever more write lyrics of this reduced quality, but it was not by any means a total loss. They did increase the hard-rock and grooving portion of their sound, so depending on which of their styles you prefer that's a plus or a minus. Frankly, if you chose to consider it as or compare it to hard-rock it wouldn't diminish this album. The hard-rock of comparable quality in 1978 was almost as rare as the comparable heavy metal. All in all a good outing by Priest, and every fan of early metal or hard-rock should have at least a few of these songs.\n",
        "\nIn the 1970's, Judas Priest was adored by their fans, but was maligned by music critics. Their heavy, angry, and fast heavy metal musical style was simply too much for a lot of people at the time, so for some reason, the band decided to take their music further. And by further, I mean they tried to make their music more pleasant-sounding to mainstream audiences. In doing so, they made a few sacrifices, and those sacrifices kind of watered down their music, and turned Judas Priest, a heavy metal band, into just a plain-old hard rock band. Still, it would not be their last time in trying to sell out, yet it certainly wouldn't be their worst.\n\nFor starters, there is the fact that the tempos on all of the songs on here aren't as fast as songs on previous albums. You never get a song that's as fast as \"Exciter\". In fact, the song \"Don't Go\" is actually pretty slow, a complete nasty surprise for any diehard fan. Time signatures aren't the only thing to be cut down to size with the making of this album. The band decided to cut back on using aggressive power chords to keep their songs driving. Instead, a few of the albums songs use basic chords to make a sort of late 70's hard rock sound. As a result, we end up with incredibly goofy, if not idiotic, songs like \"You say Yes\". It's a song that doesn't sound like anything you'd expect Judas Priest to come up with, even though they had hit the charts with \"Living after Midnight\" just a year earlier. \"All the Way\" is kind of the same way, too, and the cheesy factor of it is topped off with the way that Rob Halford sings the verses. It sounds like he's trying to sing a Creedence Clearwater Revival song or something. This really isn't like Judas Priest at all. Their fans expected the raw power and fast and aggressive tempos that they were familiar with, like in \"Rapid Fire\", not this. \n\nBelieve it or not, despite these shortcomings, there is actually something that can actually be enjoyed on this album. You can still find remains of the Judas Priest that we know and love on this album, unlike \"Turbo\", which would come five years later. \"Hot Rockin'\" is the closest thing we get to good old-fashioned heavy metal that Judas Priest is known for. Like I said, it's basically the track with the fastest time signature on the album. While it's not as fast as we hoped it would be, it still manages to have that same driving pace and sheer force reminiscent of \"Breaking the Law\". \"On the Run\" also has that Priest-style heavy metal vibe, for it's one of the few songs on here that features the crunching riffs that mirror anything on \"Hell Bent for Leather\". It's proof that while this album is a more commercial approach made by Judas Priest, they still have soft spots in their hearts for the music they made famous. \n\nOn the other hand, though, this is also Judas Priest's most commercial effort in the early 80's, therefore, there has to be something expected in more commercial music. Sing-along choruses appear in great numbers on \"Point of Entry\", and some can get irritating to some degree. You'll hear them in songs such as \"You say Yes\", \"Don't Go\", and even the hard rockin' \"On the Run\". At least the last one isn't as moronic as the chorus to \"Turning Circles\". That one's got an \"a-ha, a-ha\" that is repeated over and over, and usually when something goofy like an \"a-ha, a-ha\" or a \"na-na\" gets repeated, it causes the song to be a disgusting earworm. Priest has used sing-along choruses before, but never to the extent we have here on \"Point of Entry\". The sing-along choruses that do appear on the album aren't all bad, for \"Heading Out to the Highway\" still seems to be pretty decent, even with a catchy chorus. It's got kind of a nice hook to go along with it, too, and okay, I admit, the chorus is actually kind of decent, as opposed to \"Turning Circles\". I think the chorus of \"On the Run\" is even better, though, for it leans more towards Priest-style heavy metal than any other song on here.\n\nSure, this album has more of a commercial direction, but believe me, there is still some good on here. The album isn't terrible, in my opinion, it's just different. Yes, we get songs like \"Don't Go\" that don't quite fit, but at least we can enjoy a little bit of Judas Priest's magic while listening to the album. It's different, but it's definitely not the very worst Judas Priest album ever created, not by a long shot. At least \"Point of Entry\" tries to sound like Fleetwood Mac instead of Boy George, like \"Turbo\" would.\n",
        "\nRedeemer of Souls is the new song by heavy metal legends Judas Priest, ahead of the release of the album of the same name on July 14th.\n\nIt's the first new Judas Priest song since 2008's Nostradamus, and also the first since the departure of founding guitarist K.K.Downing left the group in 2011 and was replaced by ex-Voodoo Six guitarist Richie Faulkner. The song has all the elements of the classic Priest sound, such as the strong operatic voice of Rob Halford which is much better than expected, a good deal of catchiness in the riffs and the chorus, as well as a strong melodic guitar solo, and there's a strong sense of enthusiasm and passion coming through. But although it contains these elements, what it lacks is power. It might be unfair to ask them to recreate the power and sheer epic sound of Stained Class, or Painkiller, but the track is a little flat, especially in the chorus. It's a little too melodic and commercial sounding, and although he sounds good over the rest of the track, on the chorus Rob's voice is lacking in energy somewhat. And although the riffs in the track are catchy, but they're not particularly fast, they seem to plod along without reaching the powerful sound of earlier output. It's the same with the solo, it sounds nice and melodic, but its ultimately a bit too slow and a little uncreative compared to others in the Priest canon, it's not even close to Beyond the Realms of Death.\n\nUltimately it's a decent enough track, and it sounds about as good as you would expect Judas Priest to sound in 2014. With most of the band members being in their sixties it's a good effort, and though they've lost a bit of pace and energy compared to the early years, they make up for it with enthusiasm. By slowing it down a little they seem to be playing to their strengths, rather than trying and failing to recreate their older material. It's decent enough, and if they can write some faster, more powerful tracks on the rest of the album then it could very well be an interesting listen.\n\nOriginally written for swirlsofnoise.com\n",
        "\nThe late 70s were a prolific time for the metal gods known as Judas Priest, if not in terms of popularity and album sales, then certainly in productivity; between 1976 and 1978, they had at least one album recorded for each year and in the case of 1978, managed to record two albums in one year, a feat few bands are capable of doing in today's environment. That any of these albums would be top notch records in that kind of recording schedule is a miracle in itself, since bands usually require some a lot of time to evolve their sound. Yet in a manner of two years, Judas Priest had an evolved sound removed from the psychedelic blues rock of their debut and transformed into a unique metal machine. With \"Stained Class\", we see Judas Priest come into their own with a sound that, for the first time, pulls all of their influences together without appearing disjointed.\n\nThe album is more polished than their previous three, and not just in terms of production. The songs are focused without being one dimensional and varied without appearing desperate to be progressive. Despite a production that, for it's time, must have been considered clean for a heavy metal album, there is an underlying darkness in the songs, both musically and lyrically. The music takes most of it's cues from the speed of their previous \"Sin After Sin\" but brings back the catchy hooks we saw in the debut \"Rocka Rolla\", giving the heavy metal aggression a bit of swing that keeps your head banging throughout. The lyrics themselves have grown more colorful, evolving from the hellish themes in previous songs like \"Dissident Aggressor\" and creating entire heavy metal fables centered around sci-fi and war tales like \"Saints in Hell\", \"Exciter\", \"Stained Class\" and \"Invaders\". Matching the fury of Judas Priest's heavy metal storm is Rob Halford, who utilizes high notes even more on this album, rising to a crescendo that matches the violent excitement of the music. The opening track \"Exciter\" is pure proto-speed metal joy that opens with a brief but impressive drum fill by Les Binks, who throughout the rest of the song proves his mettle (no pun intended) as a drummer for the fiery heavy metal Judas Priest are going for on this album. Judas Priest include a cover song, \"Better by You, Better Than Me\", which despite it's catchy riff, is best known for being the focus of that absurd lawsuit involving suicide. Which is funny, because \"Better By You, Better Than Me\" makes me want to do anything but kill myself. \n\nDespite all of the impressive songs on this album, one in particular has become a fan favorite that is still performed in concerts to this day, and that is \"Beyond the Realms of Death\". Aside from being an awesome song with an impressive musical dynamic, \"Beyond the Realms of Death\" feels like a fulfillment of Judas Priest's attempts at fusing their progressive influences into their heavy formula. We've seen them make ballads in previous albums, but those felt, for the most part like standard ballads. With \"Beyond the Realms of Death\", you have a melancholy acoustic intro that kicks into a heavy chorus with an impassioned performance by Rob Halford, a soulful guitar solo, and flawlessly dark lyrics that match the tone of the album. It's just too bad that other tracks on the album, like heavy hooked \"White Heat, Red Hot\" or the pre-NWOBHM ferocity of \"Exciter\" or \"Savage\", haven't become quite the concert staples they should be.\n\nIn my opinion, this is probably one of Judas Priest's best 1970's albums, if not one of their best albums over all. It sheds any connection with the hard rock of the time, in favor of being it's own steel monster that predicts the speed and thrash metal attack of the 80s. Judas Priest spent their first few albums searching for a place for the best of their influences in their music, while trying to maintain a distinct identity. With \"Stained Class\", Judas Priest not only developed their own approach to the heavy metal sound, but helped give heavy metal it's own unique identity.\n",
        "\nSometime back, during my quest to seek out the earlier works of Judas Priest, I had skipped over this album in favor of it's successor, \"Stained Class\". Which is disappointing, not only because this album is crucial (from the metal critic and historian's point of view) in seeing the transition Priest made to that album, but because this album immediately kicks your ass less than 10 seconds in, and continues to do so with minimal reprieve. Probably their heaviest album up to that point, \"Sin After Sin\" shows a band who is growing closer to discovering their identity as a band. The heavy songs are heavier, faster and more frenetic than before, and Rob Halford's voice soars over the songs, like an opera singer for a hellish orchestra.\n\nAlthough every track has it's own highlights, there are a few tracks in particular that I feel deserve notice, since they show the musical progress Judas Priest has made, and since they continue to influence heavy metal to this day. Mid-way through the album, we are hit with \"Let us Prey/Call for the Priest\", which mixes the prog elements that we've come to expect from Priest's previous albums with the up tempo metal attack of the rest of the album, almost helping to invent the idea of prog metal. The song also contains a duel guitar solo that predates Iron Maiden's albums by three years. \"Here Come the Tears\" is one of two ballads on the album, but I mention this over the excellent \"Last Rose of Summer\" (a song with a watery guitar tone and soulful melody that sounds as if it could have influenced Pearl Jam, of all bands) because it grows closer to what Judas Priest would accomplish with \"Beyond the Realms of Death\" in terms of mixing melancholy with metal. Of course, there is \"Dissident Aggressor\", the epic finale of the album, where Rob's falsetto reaches unprecedented heights and the guitar attack sounds like a precursor to the thrash metal that dominated the 80s (no wonder Slayer covered it!). The closest thing to a \"commercial\" song on this album, even more so than \"Last Rose of Summer\" is the Joan Baez cover \"Diamonds and Rust\". With remarkably calm guitars and a rhythm line that brings Heart to mind, the song seems a prediction of Priest's more commercial work in the 80s, as well as much of the commercial metal in the 80s in general.\n\nAlthough those songs deserve note because of the influence I feel they had on heavy metal (as well as rock in general), this isn't to discredit the rest of the album, especially the ripping opener \"Sinner\" that feels like the logical realization of the \"Born to Be Wild\" riff. I also can't help but pass up the hard rocking \"Raw Deal\" if mainly for the innuendo in the lyrics: \"All eyes hit me as I walked into the bar/ Ad seeing other guys were fooling with the denim dudes\". Though the reference to gay culture should now be blatant to anyone familiar with Judas Priest's career, it wouldn't have been as obvious then, when leather gay bars were still in the shadows of society, and such a reference would be an esoteric in joke. So I have to admire that, even when Rob Halford was \"in the closet\", he still left subtle hints to his sexuality with only a wink and smile to any possibly knowing fans (though the line \"The true freedom of expression I demand is human rights\" should have been a no brainer even then).\n\nReleased in 1977, the year punk rock was king, the speed of the songs on the album seem like Priest's answer to bands like the Sex Pistols, and some of the songs are still fast and heavy enough to go up against today's metal. The progressive elements feel better integrated into the album than their previous two efforts, and Judas Priest now have their own identity as a band separate from the rest of the crowd at the time.\n",
        "\nAs a bridge between early heavy metal and the NWOBHM, Judas Priest are looked so highly upon by metalheads and music critics for how they pushed the boundaries of heavy metal, by taking the best elements of hard rock, heavy metal, progressive rock and mixing the elements together to create one behemoth that forced the genre to grow and evolve from it's late 60s blues rock roots. I mention this because I consider this crucial to understanding not only the improvements Judas Priest made on their sound on \"Sad Wings of Destiny\", but how this album stands out from its contemporaries.\n\nOne major improvement from \"Rocka Rolla\" is the composition of the songs, as the songs here function as more focused machines with guitar riffs that instantly make your head move and surprise you not only with the heaviness of the guitars themselves, but with the variety injected. The opener, \"Victim of Changes\" opens with a riff that comes out at you, moves to its shrieking solo, makes a transition into a calm, clean sound. This section gives you only a slight breath for the closer, where only Rob Halford's high note could compete with the guitar. Though not to what today's standards of \"speed\" might be. K.K Downing and Glen Tipton increase the tempo of the songs beyond the simple mid tempo of their first release, giving the songs an added sense of edge and urgency. The \"twin guitar attack\" that they have become known for is also beginning to show signs of emergence. Where they particular show themselves as efficient composers is in songs such as \"Tyrants\" and \"Islands of Domination\", which have the heaviness you want from the genre, while remaining exciting and throwing in the necessary variety.\n\nThe influences of the band themselves, while held together a little more seamlessly than in the conservative hard rock of \"Rocka Rolla\", still show clearly. In the case of \"Epitaph\", we are treated to a song that is almost piano driven, and sounds as if it could have come from a Queen album of the era. The progressive elements of the previous album are also to be found in \"Sad Wings of Destiny\", but are incorporated more intelligently, such as the soft sections of \"Victim of Changes\", \"Dreamer Deceiver\", and the acoustic part at the end of \"Deceiver\". Really, the only track that seems out of place on the whole album is \"Epitaph\". Fitting as tribute to Queen it may be, it does not quite match the musical tone of the rest of the album, and if it were to be placed anywhere, it should be at the end, where the melancholy ballad eases us out of the half hour of otherwise solid heavy metal we just endured.\n\nPerhaps the final word goes to Rob Halford, who as we expect him to, is at the top of his game, wailing and shrieking his way through the album in a way few vocalists have managed to replicate (try as they might). Sad Wings of Destiny is an essential album for any fan of heavy metal, and though I consider it to be neither the definitive Judas Priest album, nor my absolute favorite, it's importance is unmistakable, as we see Judas Priest begin to develop the sound that would ensure heavy metal's survival into the 80s, and beyond.\n",
        "\nFor a band as revolutionary in the heavy metal genre as Judas Priest, it may come as a surprise that their debut album, far from being a groundbreaking explosion, is a rather conservative album. Not just by the standards of our modern era where anything softer than Gorgoroth or Suffocation could be deemed \"not heavy enough\", but conservative for it's own time as well. Released in 1974, when Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple had been pumping out release after release of heavy blues rock since 1969, Judas Priest were late comers as far as record releases are concerned, and had yet to develop both the distinct musical and visual style that so many metal fans associate with Priest (look for a video of Judas Priest performing \"Rocka Rolla on British television at the time and you will see exactly what I mean). What we have on \"Rocka Rolla\", their debut LP is fairly simple hard rock/early heavy metal in the vein of Thin Lizzy, Led Zeppelin and Ted Nugent, with subtle hints of the beast that was not yet unleashed.\n\nThere are two elements on this album that distinguish Priest from the other bands around this time, the first being the vocals of Rob Halford. Even early on, his range is fantastic and its clear that his voice has been the most consistent part of Judas Priest's sound (minus the time he wasn't in the band). His voice is better suited to the rockers than to the ballads on this album; his voice still sounds great on the soft parts of \"Run of the Mill\", but its when the guitars grow loud that he lets his voice loose.\n\nThe guitar work of K.K Downing and Glen Tipton is the second distinguishing factor, though to a lesser degree. In the riffs for the title track, \"One for the Road\" and the heavy sections of the other songs, they show traces of the guitar work they would be most remembered for. For the most part, there isn't much of the \"twin guitar solo attack\", and their style remains firmly rooted in the hard and progressive rock tendencies of the age. The occasional use of a blues harmonica and Pink Floyd-esque sound on \"Winter Retreat\" and \"Run of the Mill\" are reminders of the time the album was released, with the closest indicators of the classic Judas Priest sound lurking in \"Cheater, the later half of \"Dying to Meet You\", and the title track. Though I'm not much of a production freak, I couldn't help but feel that the sound of the electric guitars was a little too tame for what Judas Priest appeared to be going for on this album-especially when the producer is Roger Bain, who produced the first three Black Sabbath albums.\n\nIf you are a huge Judas Priest fan but have not yet heard this album, I recommend that you do so to see the roots of one of heavy metal's greatest bands; whether you will actually enjoy the album will depend on whether you like early 70s hard rock with a few progressive influences. There is nothing in \"Rocka Rolla\" that is abysmal, and I rather enjoy the title track, but compared to what they would soon be releasing, \"Rocka Rolla\" seems too mundane and doesn't seem that much different from any other band at the time. You will definitely find a track or two on here that you will be listening to again and again, but it's unlikely that you will give the album as a whole the same treatment.\n",
        "\nThis is Judas Priest's very first album. The first from a band we would later regard as being \"The Metal Gods\". It was released during the time that the band couldn't keep a drummer for too long, and had just began to embrace the idea of having a second guitarist (Glenn Tipton was brought in during the album's recording to do some additional guitar parts). The band already had a lot of original material that won over their audiences during shows, and all that was left to do before going on an upward spiral of success was to record these songs in a studio and release them as an album.\n\nHowever, things didn't quite turn out as planned. Priest ended up with producer Rodger Bain, who, although had production work for some of the classic Black Sabbath albums on his resum\u00e9, did a poor job here. He had too much control over the album and left off most of the fan favourites. The album's sound also suffered in the process, and it flopped upon release. It would seem as though the structuring/ordering of tracks wasn't properly thought out, either. \"Winter\", \"Deep Freeze\" and \"Winter Retreat\" form a single piece of music that doesn't really need to be split into three. There is no one part that is any better than, or much different to the others, really. \"Dying To Meet You\" contains a hidden song known as \"Hero, Hero\", though it is only the penultimate track on the album, whereas usually hidden tracks are found at the very end of an album. It seems unnecessary to combine these two songs when the \"Winter\" piece is split into three.\n\nThe material itself isn't all that bad, but it's a rather far cry from the powerful brand of heavy metal they would create in later years. Even its album cover is very unlike the iconic covers that were made for their later albums (Paying homage to Coca Cola on an album cover is hardly the sort of thing you'd expect from Priest). The music is much more in the vein of Led Zeppelin influenced hard/blues rock with some progressive elements. The straight hard rock songs here, such as \"One For The Road\", the underrated title track, \"Cheater\" and \"Never Satisfied\", generally work better than the songs that attempt to be progressive, and it is through the hard rock tracks that the band shines the most on this album. \n\nSinger Rob Halford's vocals are consistently solid through the album, but are short of anything groundbreaking at this early stage in Priest's career. It's also worth noting that this was long before the world knew of Halford's homosexuality, and some of the album's songs are explicitly about women, the title track and \"Cheater\" especially, the latter in which he sings \"You cheating bitch! Here's what I think of you!\", likely an attempt to display masculinity. This does also mean that the album is somewhat on the clich\u00e9 side, and Halford was yet to make an attempt at expressing his homosexuality through S&M leather and the like, and none of the other members were indulging in that stuff, either. In fact, they were going through a hippie phase during this time period!\n\nRocka Rolla is an album that is rather lacking in focus, which is not helped by the poor production, and the decision to cut down what was supposed to be a 14-minute epic to a meaningless 2-minute instrumental (\"Caviar and Meths\"). Half of the album has progressive tendencies that generally fall flat, whilst the other half does contain some solid hard rock with stellar guitar work from both Tipton and K.K. Downing. The band's potential isn't fully demonstrated here, but what we do hear of it is no real disappointment. This album has been ignored by most, picked up mainly by aspiring Priest completists, and it will likely remain that way. But some of the songs here are definitely worth checking out by any hard rock and heavy metal fan.\n",
        "\nAfter Judas Priest released their ill-conceived album \"Turbo\" in 1986, many of its fans began to abandon ship and join the legions of thrash metal fans. The album was a dismal failure that showed that Priest had an identity crisis in terms of musical style in the mid '80s. Realizing their near-fatal mistake, they decided to make another album as a way of saying \"please forgive us, we won't do it again\" to their fans. That new album was 1988's \"Ram it Down\", and although it still has traces of \"Turbo\" on it, there's no doubt that the band wanted to appease its fans while making more money. The album isn't as bad as \"Turbo\", but it isn't as good as \"Sad Wings of Destiny\" or \"Stained Class\" either.\n\nJudas Priest has actually improved quite a bit on this album. Although it's slightly melodic before it gets to the solo, the opening/title track is at that ripping, blazing speed that made Priest the band that we all know and love. \"Hard as Iron\" is also worthy of mention, for its riffs don't sound like anything radio-friendly like the horrendous \"Parental Guidance\". The use of synthesizers is cut down as well. Aside from \"Blood Red Skies\", synthesizers on this album are almost virtually nonexistent. Oh, did I mention the phenomenal solo at the beginning of \"Heavy Metal\"? It's a sign that Priest is slowly returning to their roots and shrugging off the \"sellout\" label.\n\nDespite these improvements, though, there is still that shadow of \"Turbo\" that is cast on \"Ram it Down\". Even the songs that are actually good on this album still have some melodic quality to them, especially \"Hard as Iron\". Even with the melodic sound, the songs are at least better than what they could have been (*cough* any song on \"Turbo\" *cough* *cough*) and are actually good to listen to. There is also the fact that there are songs on here that sound almost entirely like they were meant to be hit singles (e.g. \"Come and Get It\", \"I'm a Rocker\", etc.). But even then, those songs aren't entirely bad, they're just somewhat bland and forgettable.\n\nBut all of these would only be a chuckle compared to the song on this album that everybody should skip, regardless of their musical taste; Priest's cover of Chuck Berry's \"Johhny B. Goode\". Why? Just why? What's the point of that? Have you learned from ANY of your mistakes? It's like what would happen to Celtic Frost, still reeling from the failure of \"Cold Lake\", if Tom G. Warrior said, \"Hey guys, you know what we should do? We should do something fun, like covering an old Beatles song. That'll be cool enough to put on our next album.\" That's what it's like. I could go on and on about how Priest made an even bigger mistake than their previous album, but I would have to type it in all caps and take up several pages, so my rant is over.\n\nThough it's not as bad as their previous effort/disaster, \"Ram it Down\" still might have been a better effort. There are some songs on here that are forgettable while others are actually decent enough for me to actually listen to them, let alone, like them. It's not a horrible album, it's just not anything to crow about. Their next album \"Painkiller\" would prove that Priest would enjoy a new beginning, but fans had to wait until the '90s for that to happen. It's a shame, cos Priest's last release of the '80s, a decade in which metal flourished, was one of their weakest efforts. Still, it could have been a whole lot worse.\n",
        "\nThe main thing that strikes you when you first discover this album is that Rob Halford is absent. He left in the early 90s and was replaced by a Judas Priest tribute singer named Tim 'Ripper' Owens. However, this is by no means an attempt to write another Painkiller just because they have a similar sounding vocalist. In fact, it's a refreshing attempt to move forward with a darker sound that seems to take an influence from thrash and groove metal and features down tuned guitars, something the band had not previously tried. Being fond of thrash metal, myself, I find that there is a lot to like here.\n\n\nThe album uses drums and guitars of varying speeds. This is especially evident in the title track, which opens the album and is an intense tune. It begins with a strange kind of rhythm that sounds like machines clattering together, which is followed shortly by sinister guitar riffs and drums. 'Ripper' delivers many spoken word and sung parts in a lower octave throughout the album. But of course, he also shows off his high vocal range by screaming and wailing much like Halford, yes his high singing is put to good use rather than just being there for the sake of it. \n\n\nThere are songs like \"Dead Meat\" that remind me a little bit of bands like Pantera and Slayer, who are generally labelled groove metal and thrash metal. \"Bullet Train\" certainly wouldn't feel too out of place as a Slayer song, either. Of course, I'm only making comparisons because of the musical influences on this album. At no point do I feel like Priest are ripping them off. It's tracks like \"Dead Meat\" and also \"Brain Dead\" that I feel use the down tuned guitars the most effectively; the lyrics explore themes such as the apocalypse, non-conformity, and death. The band makes something of a statement in \"Brain Dead\" that a man shouldn't live off a machine, incapable of doing anything and trapped in his thoughts due to the loss of any physical functionality. It's part of what makes this album much darker than their past material with Halford. We hear almost-demonic vocals from Ripper in \"Burn In Hell\", a song that starts out quiet and builds up to heavy guitars and drums, like many other songs on this album.\n\n\nOne of the best songs is the closing track, \"Cathedral Spires\", which is a 9-minute epic. The first part of the song is perhaps the first time the music actually feels sad. Up until this point, the music sounded consistently angry, whether it was slow, fast, quiet, or loud. It's a song about the world ending, about how we should \"rise up and retire / watching as the world expires\". It carries on from the lyrical topics of the end of the world and evil that were explored in previous songs. It's fairly slow but still containing the heavy down tuned guitars. The song ends with a repeated chant of the chorus' lyrics before the music ends with a crash, like the world has exploded.\n\n\nOverall, Jugulator is a strong effort from a band faced with the challenge of replacing a key member. For fans of groove/thrash metal and fans of Priest, this album is worth picking up. You may end up really enjoying it. Their next and final album with 'Ripper' Owens, Demolition, is more of a mixed bag, experimenting with other styles, but still has several moments of brilliance. But that is for a future review...\n",
        "\nLet's face it, it's happened to nearly every metal band in the 80's. It happened to Raven, it happened to Saxon, it even affected Celtic Frost. This happening is when a band signs on to a major label, or is one one already, and they are told by their producers to go for a more radio-friendly sound. What really surprises me is that this album was produced by none other than Tom Allom, who produced many of Judas Priest's albums as well as many of Black Sabbath's. He even produced Def Leppard's \"On through the Night\", at a time when Def Leppard actually sounded good. I have no idea what Mr. Allom or Judas Priest were thinking when they cranked this out, cos it sure sounds WAY different than their previous releases.\n\nOne thing that makes this album stick out like a sore thumb is its use of synthesizers. Up until now, Judas Priest had practically never used synthesizers, and now, songs like \"Turbo Lover\" and \"Out in the Cold\" are full of its sound, so much so that it kind of outweighs the heavy guitar sound that Priest is known for. Now, synthesizers aren't really bad, I mean, there are bands like Dio that use them to a great effect. It's just that when synthesizers are used to create a sci-fi-like sound that mirrors that of Devo, and the band that is using them to create that sound is known mostly for music made with guitars, there's bound to be problems. Oh, and there's also the robot-like voice in the chorus of \"Turbo Lover\", another thing that bothers me about the song.\n\nAnother fault with this album is that Judas Priest almost completely strayed from their style of heavy metal. In the case of \"Parental Guidance\", the band discarded the idea of making a blasting, aggressive-sounding song in favor of making a cheesy one revolving around getting away from your parents. This kind of songwriting would work well with Twisted Sister, but Priest? Nuh-uh! \"Wild Nights, Hot & Crazy Days\" is a pretty goofy and dumb song about partying. Priest writing songs about having a good time is nothing new (ex. \"Living After Midnight\"), but this particular song just sounds like something straight out of a Motley Crue album. Just put your hair up as high as a four-story building, and Priest would be set to make Bon Jovi fans squeal with excitement....or not!\n\nI swear, I must have heard those riffs before! \"Hot for Love and \"Locked In\" contain some of the most generic, cookie-cutter riffs I have ever heard. Come on you guys, You're Glen Tipton and K.K. Downing, you have GOT to come up with something more creative than this! Are you even trying to create music, or are you trying to imitate, or even become, one of those glam bands? Cos those I'm pretty sure that glam bands at that time wouldn't think too much about creativity and focus more on what kind of lipstick they should use. Guys you're not Poison, you're not Bon Jovi, you're JUDAS PRIEST. We should be hearing more songs like \"Tyrant\", or \"The Sentinel\", not this garbage!\n\nI'm not sure if Tom Allom had a hand in making this album sound the way it does, cos it really doesn't sound like anything he'd produce (except Loverboy, yeah he produced an album for Loverboy). Maybe he was pressured by Columbia Records to try and make Judas Priest into a glam band that would be easy for mainstream audience to follow. Still, Priest could have made the better choice and create something like \"Painkiller\", which, fortunately, would happen in 1991. But \"Turbo\" is a horrific pile of dog dung that should be known not as a classic, but as one of the biggest mistakes Priest ever made. Guys, you're already filling up arenas with the sound you have and you've already made your mark in the music world. What more do you want? You have bands named after your songs, you have GOT to know better than this!\n",
        "\nAmong the Halford-era Priest albums, this would seem to be the one fans like to rip on the hardest. And frankly I can't blame them. Turbo here was Judas Priest's big foray into that sweaty, testosterone-filled jungle that was late-80's glam metal, and they certainly didn't leave in any stops in their effort to fit that mold. Gone are the rip-roaring screamers about hellions on motorcycles, government satellites, space invaders and evil warlords; instead we get 9 super-synthy pop-rockers about sex and partying all night long, a la the poppiest tracks off of British Steel only made much more embarrassing in this case. For longtime fans of Priest it was a blatantly commercial bid for a good spot in the charts, and left a bad taste in everybody's mouths that only Painkiller 4 years later was able to cleanse.\n\nThis makes it all the more begrudging to admit that I actually kind of like this album, and listen to it way more often than I probably should. The fact of the matter is that, even being that the songs are as objectively vapid as they are, when I take the opportunity to take my head out of my ass for a bit it turns out that a lot of them are also pretty fun. I have to confess here that glam bands are kind of a guilty pleasure of mine, and it's really for just the reason that their music is just catchy, dumb, easily digested rock music. And certainly one of the more remarkable characteristics of Priest was that they were at one point able to make their music accessible while keeping it creative and at the forefront of what metal could do, but really they're so damn good that even their glam album rocks harder than what most of the competition was doing.\n\nThe lyrics are a common complaint in regards to Turbo. I'd certainly be insane to claim that they were anything but moronic, but really most of them are not that much dumber than the ones on, say, \"Living After Midnight\" or \"Fever\", and those songs rule my balls and yours. There are some true stinkers here, particularly \"Parental Guidance\" which takes the \"grown-ups are so lame, man!\" style of songwriting to levels of cringeworthiness that I don't think even 80's children's cartoons are allowed to. Lines like \"How would you know, anyway? You're just Mr. Dull!\" ...Gaaaawd, it sucks. I also think \"Wild Nights, Hot and Crazy Days\" is both the laziest title and chorus for a Friday night party song I ever heard. Lucky for me, I tend not to focus much on the lyrics when I listen to most music, so the crap-factor here doesn't detract for the experience for me that badly.\n\nThat leaves me then with the instrumentals and the quality of Halford's singing, which are really quite good for the most part. The biggest and most glaring problem for most people is the extensively and awkwardly used synthesizers, which come to the front everywhere and gave me a pretty bad first impression of the album. I did get used to them, but I give you fair warning that they are everywhere, right from the first notes played in \"Turbo Lover\". This track, by the way, is one of my favorites on the album. Again ignoring some inane lyrics, it works really well by starting out kinda quiet and building up to the first chorus. The solo is decent but nothing to write home about. The other two standout tracks for me are \"Locked In\", which has a good headbanging riff, and \"Out In the Cold\", which has more force and weight behind it than most other glam songs out there. Most of the percussion unfortunately sounds like it's coming from a robot, which for this particular album may actually be half-true, but Glenn, KK and Rob are all still forces of nature even when performing songs as silly as these, and as the reigning metal gods they certainly show the competition a thing or two about how to play glam metal, even if not how to actually write it. The other tracks are a mixed bunch, sometimes fun, often boring, but generally don't deliver anything too memorable. The closer \"Reckless\" always disappointed me, never bringing anything to a satisfying end the way Priest's best closers are able to. It just kinda rocks along on autopilot for a few minutes and then fades out.\n\nOn the plus side, it doesn't leave the listener clamoring for more. Turbo is an enjoyable listen, with the right mindset, and for what it is it is a worthy album indeed. But it was not a direction that Judas Priest was really comfortable going in, and in choosing not to pursue it any further I can confidently say nothing of value was lost.\n",
        "\nBeing that this is the album that really broke out beloved Judas Priest into the big time, it's easy to see why this album has garnered so much recognition over the years. But the question here is, does \"British Steel\" live up to the ever-present hype? Read on to find out my opinion.\n\nOverall, this is a very strong album. In fact, it's a hands-down classic. But in my opinion, yes, this album has been worn out with some of its songs played to death, like the (still enjoyable) hits \"Breaking The Law\" and \"Living After Midnight\".\n\nThe album opens up with a speed metal riff-fest in \"Rapid Fire\" with lyrics at their finest and a musical approach that has undoubtedly influenced such thrash metal giants as Megadeth and Slayer. The slower, but just as powerful \"Metal Gods\" follows right afterwards and is four-minutes of chugging, stomping, and headbanging riffs. The third song is the legendary \"Breaking The Law\" and although it lacks a guitar solo, the riff is classic NWOBHM material. \"Grinder\", \"United\" and \"Living After Midnight\" are all prime examples of combining heavy instrumentation with catchy melodies and sing-a-long lines that defined the NWOBHM. The album closes with another speed metal headbanger in \"Steeler\" and reminds us why Judas Priest are the metal legends that they are.\n\nWell, 30+ years later this album is still an essential piece of heavy metal history, albeit over-talked about, that should be in every metalhead's collection regardless of the overhype. Strongly recommended if you want to build a collection of stone cold classics. Cheers!!!\n",
        "\nThere are some albums that absolutely everybody should hear at least once in their lifetime, due to the fact that they are written so well that anyone, no matter what their preferred genre, can get into them. Judas Priest wrote several of these releases, but the one that was slightly overrated, Painkiller, is also the most interesting of these. Upon the time of its release, there was simply nothing out there that could boast quite the brash, unadulterated nature that Painkiller carried so proudly, and for this reason it truly is a landmark album, despite not being perfect as one would expect from an album of such a stature.\n\nKicking right off with the thrashy title track, it becomes immediately clear that something has changed about Judas Priest. Gone is the softer, more radio friendly styling of albums such as Screaming For Vengeance, and in its place we have a stunning, extremely heavy drum solo, before diving headfirst into a very aggressive song. This is one of the highlights of the album, coupling intense drumming with memorable riffing and Rob Halford's signature high pitched vocals, that match the apocalyptic feel of this song very well. However, in my opinion, it is the soloing on this song that really makes it as good as it is, with some incredibly powerful use of solos that are almost unmatched in all of metal.\n\nPainkiller showcases that which is great about this album to great effect, showing off some very talented guitar work and fast drumming for its time. Rob Halford's vocals are still the high pitched style that much of the metal community will be familiar with, but it seems as though on this album he took it up a notch, hitting some ridiculously high pitched notes. Rob Halford really is one of the few metal vocalists out there who can come close to hitting some of the notes that fellow revered metal vocalist Bruce Dickinson can hit, which is an achievement in itself.\n\nThis album is considerably heavier than anything they had put out before, really pushing the boundaries of what was acceptable in its day and age to a near insane degree, but without ever being too off putting. When stacked against the extremities found today, it does not give off quite the same atmosphere nor impact, but when put into context, the true magic of this album seeps through. The musicianship on its own is stellar, but imagining what this must have sounded like upon release is where the beauty truly comes from. This is faster and far more aggressive than anything of its day, and delivers a truly lasting impact that does not deteriorate following numerous listens.\n\nDespite having memorable riffing, however, Hell Patrol does not quite pack the same punch as the title track. In fact, only one of the songs on here can claim to be quite on the same level as Painkiller, and that is track 7, Between the Hammer And The Anvil. This has some of the most well thought out guitar work of its age, and is pure heavy metal at its finest. Night Crawler suffers from being a little too long but has some great drumming , whereas All Guns Blazing has an annoying vocals only intro, before going into some nice guitar work throughout, including a nice lead lick near the start. Metal Meltdown is another great song, with the chorus in particularly standing out as being rather catchy and having some great vocals to it.\n\nThis album, however, is just not a consistent one. Many of the tracks have one or two points that really do drag them down, with All Guns Blazing having the worst vocal performance on the album by a long way, and Battle Hymn feeling exceedingly unnecessary, despite just being there to prepare the listener for epic closer One Shot At Glory. This is another song that is just a tad too long, being the most drawn out song on the album, but having some brilliant vocal work and exceptional guitar playing to keep it away from being a poor song.\n\nThis is just an album that feels a little underwhelming when stacked up against the countless albums that have come out since that are a lot better. It is not a bad album, having a lot to love, especially the incredible guitar work throughout the entire release. The guitars on here are some of the best ever written, with crazy soloing across the board, and memorable riffs by the dozen. However, some of the songs are either too long or just have something dragging them down.\n",
        "\nThe great Judas Priest. Ah...anyway. Well the greatness of the British metal output seemed to grow stronger with each of their solid 70's releases, culminating with the finale of their unholy trilogy of 70's classics, \"Stained Class\". \"Sad Wings of Destiny\" was something fantastic with its immense and emotionally-charged songs, while the frankly overrated \"Sin After Sin\" brought on an inconsistent array of songs ranging from wimpy ballads to electrifying proto-thrashers. But \"Stained Class\" is something special. Judas Priest's 4th full-length studio album is THE roaring, blazing blueprint for modern speed, power and thrash metal as we know it. With its dark lyrical content, throat-grabbing dual guitar assault, hammering double bass and Rob Halford's signature nightmare wailing, there was never an album like it at the time, and arguably never will be again.\n\nYes, the members of Priest are truly firing from all directions on then some on this LP. Rob Halford's piercing wails and hum-laden mid-level singing just sound fantastic, plain and simple. KK Downing and Glenn Tipton have fully-perfected their signature duel guitar assault on here, and bring the attack into full force like on the back-and-forth slicing on \"Exciter\" or the spirited textured solos of \"Beyond The Realms of Death\". Ian Hill, so often buried on a many Priest record to come, gets his moments on here, particularly some booming riffing on the title track or \"Saints In Hell\". Last but absolutely not least is the group's 2nd greatest drummer, the incomparable Les Binks. While maybe not as aggressive as the band's later skin-basher Scott Travis, he at least matches him stick-to-stick for technicality and speed alike. Just listen to the guy's legendary double bass intro (a rarity for the 70's) to \"Exciter\" and you'll be a true believer in this guy's abilities. \n\nNine songs is not enough for \"Stained Class\", but you bet your sorry mortal ass that Judas Priest is gonna make the best of that and then some! The only major downside to this album as many have pointed out is the somewhat lousy production, mostly in that the guitars can sound too wimpy and the drums are a bit hollow at times. Shit, if this album had the production of \"British Steel\" or even \"Hell-Bent For Leather\"...aw fuck, it would be fucking UNREAL! Hell, it'd probably be my favorite Priest album instead of \"Painkiller\" even! But that's that; can't change that shit so MOVING ON!\nSome highlights? Basically every-fucking-thing, though one of the best and a fan favorite would have to be \"Exciter\", the speed metal song to end all speed metal songs. From it's speed riffing and relentless drums to the blazing proto-power metal soloing and Halford's madman wailing it kicks down doors and rapes mortal skulls for every millisecond of its 5 1/2 minutes runtime. Not to mention it's got one of the best breaks in a metal song ever: \"FALL TO YOUR KNEES AND REPENT IF YOU PLEASE!\" The title track is also really fucking wicked, with some cool as hell galloping riffage that beat Maiden to the punch; Halford's shrieks are totally capable of breaking down a tower of glass on this track. Then we have a personal favorite and very underrated bit o' awesomeness in \"Saints In Hell\". It's black metal before black metal with lyrics a telling of holy men burning and all a manner of man and beast going to apocalyptic war; a very cool track with a catchy main riff and a Sabbath sort of relentlessness. Let's not forget the best metal ballad of all time, \"Beyond The Realms of Death\". It's acoustic verses never fail to mesmerize me before the song breaks into a rushing mid-paced chorus, not to mention the spirited, creative Tipton-Downing solos are one of the best things ever. Other solid songs include charging closer \"Hero's End\" (which I think should have been second last to \"Beyond The Realms of Death\" instead\") or the morose, stomping cover of the Spooky Tooth song \"Better By You, Better Than Me\". Hell, even lesser cuts like \"Invader\" or \"Savage\" are worth merit as well; they're that good!\n\nLiterally the only things I have wrong with \"Stained Class\" is that the production could be better, and that I wish the positions of the last two songs could have been switched. That's it. This album is a true masterpiece of the genre and easily of the best Priest albums ever, not to mention one of the greatest metal albums. If you don't own this yet, first you repeatedly hammer your genitals with a rusted crowbar for several hours straight for not owning it already. Then, if by some miracle you're still conscious or even alive, then maybe you'll be deemed worth for the greatness that is \"Stained Class\". Metalheads and music-lovers alike, you won't be sorry. \n\n\n\n\nPS- Sorry about your genitals.\n",
        "\nYes, the title of this review is a terrible pun, but the collection presented today is anything but. Judas Priest is a landmark heavy metal band. Some regard them as part of the holy trinity of metal bands along with Black Sabbath and Iron Maiden. Columbia Records celebrated the legacy of this band by releasing their single collection starting with \u201cSin After Sin\u201d and ending at \u201cPainkiller.\u201d In total this collection has 51 songs presented on 20 CDs. This is a must have for any Priest fan and collector. \n\nThe discs are presented as mini-LPs complete with faithfully restored packaging and sleeves just as they were when released as records back in the day. All the CDs fit firmly in the box and are compact and easy to carry around. Going through the single history of the band makes for intriguing listens by seeing what they were trying to do spreading certain tracks to the audience. \n\nThe b-sides on these singles are usually other studio songs or live cuts. The live tracks are fruitful listens as there some energetic performances of \u201cFreewheel Burning\u201d and \u201cExciter.\u201d My personal favorites were the tracks recorded in my hometown of Cleveland in 1978 with \u201cBeyond the Realms of Death\u201d, \u201cWhite Heat Red Hot\u201d, and \u201cStarbreaker.\u201d The live version of \u201cStarbreaker\u201d is much faster and has more aggressive drums and \u201cBeyond the Realms of Death\u201d shows Rob Halford\u2019s godly vocals. He is the Metal God for a reason.\n\nThere is one quirky aspect of this collection though that I don\u2019t understand. After reaching the singles from \u201cTurbo\u201d, the next ones found are for \u201cPainkiller.\u201d The singles from \u201cRam It Down\u201d are missing. There were four singles from \u201cRam It Down\u201d, but none are here. In reality, this really isn\u2019t the complete collection and there is no excuse to leave them off.\n\nBesides that omission, to round out the set are a pack of album magnets to proudly represent Judas Priest fandom on a refrigerator and also a booklet detailing each single and the songs found on each along with chart positions and so forth. There are also some neat pictures to stare at to keep each listener entertained.\n\nEven though the \u201cRam It Down\u201d singles have been rammed out of this collection, do not let this deter a purchase. It is a limited set and since this came out last year, I suggest any Priest fan to pick this up before there isn\u2019t a \u201csingle\u201d one left.\n\nnicksmetal.blogspot.com\n",
        "\nAh, yes. The hated Turbo. The much maligned Turbo. Accused of everything from being glam to murdering infants, I was much surprised to find my head banging in a quintessentially 80's sway. Ok, I'll easily admit it's not typical Priest. The songs DO sound dated and very mid-80's. Yeah, it is VERY cheesy. But hey, when has cheese stopped a self-respecting Priest fan? Their entire sound is based around being the most ridiculous band around. There are a few dud songs here, but this is not just a radio rock album. There are a few gems on this album, one of which appears towards the end (Reckless) and another that appears right squat in the middle of the album (Out in the Cold.)\n\nLyrically, I'll admit, this is hard to take seriously (is Priest ever easy to take seriously?), but that doesn't hinder my appreciation of this album. Halford sings his heart out as always, so WHAT he's singing is irrelevent. Halford's still Halford, Tipton is still Tipton, and KK is still KK. While most of the songs here are mid-tempo, they're still a fun bunch. This is not Judas Priest's most musically deep album, and it doesn't seem to warrant as many repeat listens as other albums, but I still catch myself rocking out to more up tempo songs like \"Locked In\" or \"All Fired Up\". This music wouldn't sound out of place in, say, Back To The Future or its ilk. It's great to listen to, and like most of Priest's post-1980 catalog will get you energized. If they performed these songs live they wouldn't sound out of place in the middle of the usual setlist. \n\nThis is Judas Priest's most commercial album, but do not let that deter you from enjoying this. There are kickass guitar solos on Turbo, and, to put this plainly, Judas Priest will blow whoever their competition is clean out of the water. I've seen them live, and they always find a way of completely owning the competition. This is the case with Turbo. It's mid 80's radio metal, but it completely demolishes the competition still, proving that whatever Priest decide to do, they will usually come out on top in the end. Besides, British Steel is almost or equally commercial. Despite my personal feelings on the matter, it's usually hailed as a JP classic. \n\nAt the end of the day Judas Priest are good songwriters. They're good at writing catchy, rocking, and heavy songs, and even on their more commercial ventures, they still manage to put out an album full of what we expect from Priest: catchy licks, molten steel guitar solos, energetic drumming, powerful and ear-splitting wailing from Rob Halford, and Ian Hill standing near the back, doing his thing, and chicken-necking the whole time. I understand a little trepidation about the \"radio\" feel of Turbo, but it's worth it to leave our self-consciousness at the door and rock out to Turbo.\n",
        "\nWhen it comes to a discussion on heavy metal, you cannot ever forget Judas Priest or their seminal album Screaming For Vengeance. No other album has been more influential in the development of metal, and after Screaming, heavy metal was never the same again. While Priest took a little detour into bar-based hard rock in the early 80's, they came back here with, well, a vengeance. It's hard to believe that this came right after Point of Entry; while PoE was subdued and generally relaxed, Screaming delivers riff after headbanging riff with little let or hindrance. In fact, I would say that SFV had a singular role in the development of traditional metal (think power metal, speed metal, heavy metal, etc...) unlike anything seen before or since. This IS that wrecking ball album, an album that changed the way people go about making metal. \n\nAnd it couldn't have come at a better time. The way I see it, Priest had been in a bit of a creative slump, with the last two or three albums being more commercial pandering than straight up heavy metal. As well, Iron Maiden was starting to steal all of Priest's thunder, with a succession of speedy and melodically-played albums that threatened to knock the metal heavyweight off of its iron throne. Well, luckily enough, Judas Priest came out swinging with this pugilistic tour de force. And as much as I love Iron Maiden, this is knocks the ball out the park. Seriously, though, if you haven't heard this, play it from track one. From the first resounding chord of the intro, the metal-ness comes out in a way Priest wouldn't get near until Painkiller 7 years later. If you have listened to this album, then all I have to do is start humming the first line of \"The Hellion\" and you should be able to hum the entire rest of the album without break. This is literally that classic of an album. \n\nSo what should you expect from Screaming? Well, if that name didn't tell you, or the metal eagle swooping down for the kill on the cover didn't either, you should expect balls-out metal. Expect ridiculous guitar solos, expect driving and headbang-able riffs, expect soaring falsettos from Rob Halford, and expect enough heavy metal to give you lead or mercury poisoning. I could give a track by track review, but that would get repetitive, since each song is brimming with metal. If I had to pick the best songs here, though, it would be The Hellion/Electric Eye, Riding on the Wind, and Screaming for Vengeance. Each song, though, demonstrates a band at their prime. All cylinders are firing at optimum, and even the ultra-simplistic You Got Another Thing Comin' manages to get repeated listens. \n\nI don't know any other way of putting it. Everything I look for in Priest I find in Screaming For Vengeance. So, I guess you could say this is the quintessential Judas Priest album. If you need a place to start in Judas Priest's truly massive catalog, let Screaming For Vengeance be that starting point. Even after listening to the rest of their large discography, I still find myself returning to Screaming For Vengeance. So stop reading this review, get this album, and see what I'm raving about.\n",
        "\nThe year was 1980 and a new wave was crashing down upon the face of hard rock. It featured faster tempos and pentatonic-based song structures coupled with more extensive guitar solos. It was called NWOBHM, or New Wave of British Heavy Metal. At the vanguard was Judas Priest.\n\nOk, so that was a bit sarcastic. I love JP, and I am the dude you will always hear singing along to them. Still though, this has got to be the most generic and bland album they've done. I swear to God, every song ranges from mid-paced bland NWOBHM to fast-paced, bland NWOBHM. There are no aggressive cookers like Screaming For Vengeance or The Sentinel, nor are there any epics like Beyond the Realms of Death or Dreamer Deceiver. This is, for the most part, 1st grade heavy metal. \n\nAlso for a good chunk of this it's not even heavy metal, it's just bland-ass hard rock. It doesn't get a whole lot of listens because this really isn't all that groundbreaking. Considering what Priest have done before and what another (at the time) way more obscure heavy metal band was doing: Iron Maiden. This is the album that got Priest famous, but that was simply because they became way more accessible on British Steel. Frankly, I'd bet that most people are hard-pressed to come up with a single Judas Priest song other than Breaking the Law. \n\nSuffice it to say, no instrument shines here. Halford delivers, and I will never call Rob Halford a bad singer, but you won't see his stunning range or piercing high end here. Here he gives a mostly mid-ranged performance. The guitars, bass, and drums are no different. This is late-'70s/early '80s bar rock mixed with their early sound. It's not bad in any sense, just really less special than albums like Screaming for Vengeance or Stained Class. I guess I could make a pun here and call British Steel \"Stained Classless\" or something like that. Either way, Judas Priest have a whole catalog of better albums than this. If you're new to Priest, do not be deceived, you should definitely start elsewhere. The two other albums I mentioned would be a good place. British Steel, unfortunately, is not.\n",
        "\nI, like just about everyone, was shocked when Rob Halford parted ways with Judas Priest in the 90s. The blokes were really on top of their game. They'd managed to breathe fire and passion into their traditional formula to produce the greatest record in their career, and there was no question in anyone of sound mind's mind that they were and would remain the metal gods we grew up with. But then, like with so many other great acts, it happened. The chicken flew the coop, to land only at a bad series of thrash/groove albums and industrial rock mediocrity that could never compete with or further the legacy he left behind. Eventually, he came to his senses and began putting out heavy metal records again in his eponymous solo outfit, but by then the damage had already been done, the void had widened to the point that, despite his cavalier efforts, Tim 'Ripper' Owens was about to be swallowed into it.\n\nWhat's not a shock: after two weak albums, the guys would work out their differences and return Halford to the fold. And who doesn't? There was money to be made, nostalgia to be cashiered, and midlife (or past midlife) crises to avert. Of course he was getting back together with the band, barring an untimely death, and it was only a matter of when. The when was 2003, and two years later we had a new studio album in our hands, Angel of Retribution, its proud Painkiller-like winged angel in armor spreading for the artist while it tiptoed through the flames. Metal fire. Metal meltdown fire. Unfortunately, anyone hoping that 15 years of proper studio association was going to inspire a dream comeback record was sadly mistaken, for this is just not that great of an effort. It TRIES to be, and in terms of sheer audio spectacle, it's hands down one of the best produced albums of the band's career, Roy Z more than earning his paycheck, but even after seven years I can't think of a single song on Angel that I would feel compelled to return to were I not concluding this discography of reviews.\n\nThis is essentially a lot of old ideas dressed in a sparkling new suit, and I can't help but feel that the band were pushing hard to play 'catch up', to create an album that was just cohesive enough that the fans wouldn't pull their ears off and trample them in the offal. Why else include all the self-referential lyrical bullshit? To that effect, Angel of Retribution is certainly no failure. The songs flow well enough in sequence, the tones are all loud, the album lacks for none of the heaviness of its predecessor while still managing to draw on the more accessible hard rock inflected albums of Priest past. Seriously, this is just as clean cut as anything Z produced for Bruce Dickinson, and more importantly, Halford doesn't sound as if he'd skipped a beat in the 15 years since he'd helmed an album for this lot. The guy kept busy in the interim, after all, and his pipes seem just as capable of hitting their youthful heights as ever, even if he has the maturation to restrain himself for much of the run time.\n\nUnfortunately, while a few of the songs 'rock', they don't exactly roll out the red carpet into my memory. A number like \"Deal with the Devil\" is pure power metal electricity, only by 2005 the riffs had all been played a thousand times by Germanic groups who were biting off Priest to begin with. \"Revolution\" sounds like the bastard stepchild of Jane's Addiction's \"Mountain Song\" and some old Sabbath (like \"Sweat Leaf\"), only it runs out of steam real quick with its sassy, whiny chorus; definitely feels like something that would have made it onto a Halford solo record as filler. \"Judas Rising\" is a competent if average opener, the measured charge of the guitars reminds me a lot of how Omen used to structure their songs in the early 80s, though the vocals sound nothing alike and the guitars are less Maiden-esque. \"Demonizer\" is perhaps the heaviest tune on the album, matching the harder cuts off Jugulator or Resurrection in groove power, but while it's entertaining to hear Rob stretch himself for the chorus, and I love the bubbly lead noises, it's just not as catchy as it needs to be...\n\nAngel of Retribution gets a little ambitious at the end with the 13+ minute \"Lochness\", but despite the doomed trawl it moves at, there is just no way in the 21st century of making this particular legend cool. Especially if you've seen the Penn & Teller \"Bullshit!\" episode about cryptozoology, or that episode of Celebrity Deathmatch in which a claymation Nessie battles Bigfoot. Still, at least this experiment is 'contained' to some slow, steady riffing and harmonized choruses, unlike the following double album Nostradamus where they bit off far more than they could chew. The worst here is probably \"Angel\" itself, because as competent as Halford is, I really have no need for a Judas Priest power ballad anymore. \"Eulogy\" also uses clean guitars, but it's shorter and more downcast in nature (though not much better). Others I could skip on include the pedestrian rock of \"Worth Fighting For\", or \"Wheels of Fire\" which is an attempt to recapture the pacing and catchiness of \"You've Got Another Thing Comin'\" (at least one lick in there seems strikingly similar).\n\nAll told, though, this is not an utter fuck-up for a comeback effort, and even the weaker tracks are far from horrible. I just didn't care, and still don't. When I can dial back a few years and listen to Resurrection, or even a few of the better songs on its successor Crucible, or anything 1990 and earlier from the Priest canon, there's no need for something sub-par. I don't think there's a single song on this album that anyone would consider a 'hit'. If the British steel-mongers were out to prove that they still had 'what it takes', then I say they followed through. They can still pick up their instruments and write a metal record for the studio. Now let's move past that and write some goddamn screamers again. Is there another \"Breakin' the Law\" in you, Judas Priest? Another \"Exciter\"? Because, frankly, the world could use one.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nI can't help but wonder what might have been had Judas Priest decided to pursue an experiment like Nostradamus earlier in their career, when they were in full writing capacity and churning out hit after hit. Perhaps they might have chased the idea in place of Point of Entry, or Turbo, or one of their other divisive records. Certainly they've got a front man with the capable range, and all the tools to create a satisfying rock opera concept album, but the problem is that by 2008 they were coming off almost two decades of mediocre music, and this was not really the time to be reaching so far outside the comfort zone. As a result, Nostradamus is a whole lotta ambitious nothing that is effectively one of the saddest studio efforts of their career (and I'm including the 'Ripper' Owens records in that statement). Not for lack of trying, mind you, but for the lack of results.\n\nHell, they couldn't even make this album LOOK good. Why in the name of the powers would you replace your iconic, wonderful logo with a shitty font like that? Yeah, it's a concept album about Nostradamus, and it makes sense that they were going to showcase the prophet, but it comes off like some cheap Photoshop. I didn't even think the album was real when I first saw this artwork, I felt like someone had played an online hoax. As it stands, I'd rather stare at the cover of Demolition than this eyesore, and that's not even really a cover. Of course, had this been two hours of lightning bliss with the compositional fortitude of a Painkiller of Stained Class than I'd be more than willing to overlook its outer shell, but sadly its lackluster quality does not end at that, but at the 100+ minutes of good intentions gone awry, a bloated and dramatic musical narrative which at its very best rips off past Priest triumphs or revels in haughty, \"Carmen Burena\"-like nonsense, the caveat being that they focus in on Rob Halford's voice rather than backing choirs.\n\nThis was produced by the guitarists, and I must say they didn't do a bad job of it, though it's not so bold and bright and polished as Angel of Retribution before it. The strings and keys swell accordingly to the emotional tension the band thinks its creating, but the real downfall is that across 23 tracks they can't even manage to pull out one that is remotely memorable. The double-album is divided into a series of shorter vignettes that often alternate with 5-8 minute pieces, the latter of which usually contain the harder guitars. The riffs on this song are simply abysmal, pulled from about 35 years of history and loosely paraphrased from metal tunes you've no doubt heard in the past. At the most 'exciting' you'll get a piece like \"Persecution\" which wants to very much belong to the Painkiller era, only the delivery of vocals and lyrics just don't cut it, and the note progressions feel tired and unsurprising. Others like \"Prophecy\" try to creep along with a very simple, almost heavy/doom driven riff like something you might have expected on the Halford solo records, and while I can't deny that he manages to conjure up that same, strong character in his voice, the songs really lack excitement.\n\nThe leads actually seem like they put some thought into them, but since they're not launched at you from the foundation of killer rhythm guitars, their uphill battle can't seem to reach the summit. Most of the pieces are so heavily multi-tracked with strings and synthesizers that it feels like the soundtrack to some big budget video game, like a God of War score without the menace and bravado. The bass lines are boring, the drums somewhat caged in by the orchestration. Add to this the rather cheesy lyrics in a cut like \"Lost Love\" and the whole things feels like an immense failure to broaden the band's horizons towards Trans-Siberian Orchestra fans (who don't realize Savatage was better). The worst thing about this is that the ratio of pay-off to duration is frustrating, who wants to listen to two full discs of mediocrity? Perhaps they should have reined in the writing to a single album and given a 'trial run' to the whole concept album, before going overboard. It's hard to believe this even got the green light from Columbia/Epic, but I guess they've just been around so long that they can pull their own strings.\n\nNostradamus is not the most incompetent bumbling of a career I've heard from a major metal outfit like this one. It's no Virtual XI or St. Anger. In fact, there are elements to its execution which show me that all of the band's constituents still know how to play, in particular Rob's pitch is still quite stunning. But I would be hard pressed to find a more lackluster skeleton in their closet than this one. Okay, Demolition is a sliver worse, but at least we didn't have to spend nearly two hours to find that out. What might have been an interesting, in depth glimpse into the life and times of a near mythic figure is gimped by generic, uninspired lyrics, and weak music that puts bombast above ballast. It's a little late to close my eyes and pretend everything after 1990 didn't happen, but Judas Priest are a long, long way from home here. Time to book a return flight.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nLook! Up in the sky! Is it a cat? Is it a tank? Is it a cat-tank? A battle-cat? A cattle-tank? In any case, we've gone from mecha-avian to mecha-feline with Doug Johnson's second cover for Judas Priest, but this predatory juggernaut mascot is strangely appropriate for what was one of the band's heaviest records of the 80s, one I might have dubbed Painkiller, Jr. if Ram It Down were not slightly more aggressive, enough to steal that retroactive title away. Certainly this is a more ballistic effort than its predecessor Screaming for Vengeance, and even though it lacks a true breakout hit at the level of \"You've Got Another Thing Comin'\", it's pound for pound competitive in terms of quality for much of its playtime, disintegrating only when you've gotten pretty far in the track list.\n\nBy 1983-84, the rest of the metal world was starting to catch up with Judas Priest. In England alone, you had Iron Maiden riding on the success of albums like Number of the Beast and Piece of Mind, while Def Leppard was exploding with Pyromania, and the lesser known Venom had by this point forced and soiled the boundaries of the traditional NWOBHM. Across the pond, American bands were reaching new extremes as the thrash and speed/thrash generation was just then emerging through Slayer and Metallica. By contrast, a group like Priest was, frankly, starting to feel old. Or rather, they would have, had they churned out another Point of Entry right in the middle of the mass evolution taking place. Fortunately, Halford and crew managed to stave off any notion of irrelevance with a pair of fine albums, first Screaming for Vengeance and then the Defenders of the Faith, the latter of which proved they had the muscle to go the distance, and that there was no known limit to which you could push Rob's lungs and the syncopated headbanging of the ax men.\n\nThe first seven tracks on this album completely destroy, with pure power metal pacers like \"Jawbreaker\" and \"Eat Me Alive\" highlighting just how rich and lethal Rob's vocal lines had become. The guitar tones fucking crush here, meaner and fatter than they had been on Screaming for Vengeance but just as resonant. Of special note on the album are the leads, which are in my opinion among the best of the band's career. In \"The Sentinel\", \"Some Heads Are Gonna Roll\" and \"Jawbreaker\", they really let themselves dash all over the fretboards, whammy bars and all, with the sort of excess you'd expect out of a guitar hero like E. Van Halen. The dual melodies pop along to the beats, the rhythm tone is impenetrable. Dave Holland had gelled into a pure cipher of thunder. The slight use of atmospheric synthesized effects here like the intro to \"Love Bites\" is tasteful rather than out of control (as is often the case with the following album Turbo). What's more, just about every riff on the album up to this point, while often reminiscent of others they'd written in the past, is perfectly placed into a verse/chorus structure and immediately memorable.\n\nThen, about the time we arrive at \"Night Comes Down\", the storm starts to subside. Not because this is a slower, near power ballad, because it's still pretty atmospheric and has a nice build into the chorus with some heavy riffs, but just because those leading up to it had been so much damned fun. \"Heavy Duty\", with its Queen-like steady rock beat and generic riffing sequence fares far worse, and I could completely do without the afterthought/outro \"Defenders of the Faith\" in which they just repeat the album title ad infinitum. Had Judas Priest clipped these last 8 or so minutes and included one more bridge burner, I'd likely rank this above Screaming for Vengeance and possibly up there with Stained Class in quality, but alas I can't ignore how the album just goes limp.\n\nEither way, Defenders is still a ripper of a record that begs a question: why, after such a pounding as this, would they suddenly decide to drift oft into the more mainstream/electrified overtures of Turbo before Ram It Down (considering they were supposed to be a double album at first)? Granted, I still enjoy that album to a degree, but couldn't they hear the spark of something so intense here? They'd already given us the hard rocker albums like British Steel and Point of Entry, so even in my youth I was hoping they'd take the material on Defenders and take even further. Heavier. After all I was starting to get into the faster and more aggressive metal around this time where I could sneak dubs of it off older kids whose parents wouldn't ground them for buying the tapes (I was like 10, forgive me). Ram It Down would have been a far more natural progression from this, though I admit the songs there aren't quite this amazing. Alas, it would take until 1990 to get exactly what I wanted of Judas Priest, but get it I would. At last.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nScreaming for Vengeance represented a return to the level of ambition that Judas Priest had seemingly sidetracked for the previous albums British Steel and Point of Entry, but at the same time it also retains those records' flair for production and accessibility. Featuring the first of Doug Johnson's iconic cover trilogy (the stylish, metallic raptor who many bands like Primal Fear would later tweak and adopt as their mascot), this was a smashing success largely due to its major single \"You've Got Another Thing Comin'\", which experienced so much penetration into Western culture that you'd be hard pressed to find someone who didn't know it that wasn't deaf. But Screaming was and remains quite pleasing in its entirety, the best of Priest's recordings in the 80s, and while it's a few inches shy of perfection, even the worst songs in the roster are a match for nearly anything on Point of Entry.\n\nOne of the things that first struck me about the album is its lyrical awareness and even forward thinking nature, which the band had sort of dropped out of with a lot of songs on the few albums leading up to it. Not to say that the lyrics are as complex as some of the 70s material, or that every song here is necessarily deep in intent, but I rather appreciated the relevance of \"Electric Eye\" and its observations on...well, modern observation. Or corruption (\"Bloodstone\"). Granted, there are a number of sassy sex songs here like \"Fever\", \"Devil's Child\" and so forth, and your typical 'hit the road' feel goodness (\"Riding on the Wind\") and 'don't fuck with me' anthem (\"You've Got Another Thing Comin'\"), yet even these seem well handled. Unlike Point of Entry, Screaming for Vengeance seems far more structured and plotted out rather than just spontaneously created in some exotic studio locale to fit a particular theme. But it doesn't hurt that so many of the individual songs are bastions of strong writing and hooks that likely won't escape your memory...ever.\n\nIt also doesn't hurt that \"You've Got Another Thing Comin'\" is either tied with or surpassing \"Breaking the Law\" as the band's singular, most recognizable song. And at twice the length! The simple chugging in the verses is flush with Halford's diatribe of revenge and rebellion, and the (predictable) chorus is simply a timeless miracle that will probably sound as fresh and poignant in 2082 as it did in 1982. The lead, while not the best in their canon, also seemed a step up from most on the previous two albums, all tying in with the notion that Priest had once again attained some forward momentum here. Remarkably, the rest of the songs on the album are not nearly so popular. The dire melodies that instigate the brief intro \"The Helion\" are pervasive, and \"Electric Eye\" has some of the most unforgettable guitars in it since \"Breaking the Law\" and an ace chorus, but even this was not the hugest hit when the album first arrived. Other notables include \"Bloodstone\" with its airy screaming in both the verses and chorus, and a pretty sweet intro-lick reminiscent of something Eddie Van Halen might have pulled on one of his group's earlier records. Or \"Riding on the Wind\" with Dave Holland's opening battery and some cutting highway hard rock that makes it feel like a Point of Entry outtake (only a lot catchier thanks to that harpy chorus).\n\nPriest also shows a softer side at points, but not for very long. Cleaner guitar tones introduce \"(Take These) Chains\" and \"Fever\", but it's not long before the chords erupt. Both highly underrated songs, but then, so is everything on this album that isn't named \"You've Got Another Thing Comin'\". The only tune I'm not a huge fanatic for is \"Pain and Pleasure\", which implements more or less a swaggering bluesy groove riff in the Zeppelin vein, yet even here the chorus is admittedly pretty good. In total, there is no imbalance to Screaming for Vengeance as there was with its predecessors. I never felt that I was experiencing a glut of creativity or phoned in filler; all the songs are very unified due to the production and pacing, but distinct from one another.\n\nIt helps that Rob is really on fire throughout the 39 minutes of the album, relying heavily on the screamed lines that he'd reined in for a few of the recent albums. I don't know about you, but while I appreciate the guy's adventurous nature and willingness to experiment and broaden his range to include its depths, I like it best when he's screeching over the iron-clad mesh of the guitars like acid raining from the sky, and we get plenty of that here. The guitar tone is boxy and effective, the leads spurious but entertaining, certainly some of the most acrobatic they'd yet delivered but still mindful of a good dual melody (as in the title track). The bass once again doesn't do much but follow the guitar, yet you can hear a few of his fills, and this was also the most muscular execution yet from Dave Holland, the powerful pounding undercurrent that the band would further exemplify as they blasted into the late 80s with Ram It Down, and of course the inevitable Painkiller.\n\nAnother element that I so love about Screaming for Vengeance is that, while it's immortal in quality, the album is very easily dated to the 80s and influential on so many greats to follow from Europe and the states. The zephyr-like reverb on the instruments, the huge if simple guitar hooks built to fill an arena, this was all a blueprint for hundreds of speed, power and even hard rock acts through the decade, and I really loved this sense of grand production, something we seem to miss in this modern age of excess tracking and digitized over-polish. Not that Screaming for Vengeance isn't 'clean' or mainstream enough sounding to satisfy even the most ardent pop audience, but there's just this sense of glory through the album that I don't get out of Rhapsody or Dragonforce, despite all their advancements in speed and technicality. This is not the best of Priest, but it's very far up the scale, hot enough to burst the mercury from its thermometer.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nOf all the Judas Priest records up to and including Painkiller, Point of Entry probably received the worst rep. Turbo was more of a divisive side step, clearly it had some great songs and ideas, but not all fans were on board. With Point of Entry, it was more a case that it didn't have a blazing array of hit singles like the two albums before it. The band also moved a fraction further along the axis of accessibility here, and thus there's a bit more of a laid back hard rock vibe throughout the songs, even more so than was heard on British Steel. Clearly the band wanted to write an album of broad hooks and limited aggression, fit for cruising large open spaces like the implied desert/computer paper roadway of the (US) cover, and I think to that extent it's a success. But inevitably, it resembles its predecessor in having a selection of wonderful tunes offset by some obvious filler that proved anything but inspiring, and the ratio of the latter to the former is higher here.\n\n\"Heading Out to the Highway\" is the only track that most people I know play any lip service to, a straight and somewhat dirty rocker with a glorious chorus that celebrates personal initiatives in life. Motivational metal, but the riffs aren't all that heavy despite the spacious, slicing tone Downing and Tipton draw from their axes. My favorite cuts are actually those in the middle of the record, \"Desert Plains\" and \"Solar Angels\". The airy picking and resonant vocals definitely feel like a desert blues, but especially in the former I love the effects created over the chorus and Halford's loner, drifting delivery. \"Solar Angels\" has some riffing patterns similar to \"Heading Out to the Highway\", and once again they throw a brief flurry of wild electronic effects which foreshadow Turbo but add a necessary atmosphere to balance out the rather predictable riffing. Of the rest of the songs, however, the only ones I pay much attention to are \"Troubleshooter\" for its fun, choppy hard rock riffing and \"You Say Yes\" for that climactic, if silly chorus melody. Others like \"Don't Go'\" and \"Turning Circles\" are bland and would be difficult to distinguish from bands like KISS or AC/DC if not for Halford's timbre.\n\nSonically, this is an album that favors the convertible owner. Roll down the top and just let these songs pound off into the dusty night as you race down the dusk. Internal landscape stereotyping lends me to believe that this would be a far more effective album for a road trip in Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada or California than the band's native United Kingdom. But then, that makes sense, because they wrote and recorded this on the summery Mediterranean isle of Ibiza, and it definitely carries that seasonal aesthetic to it even if it seems better suited to larger stretches of desert than an island. Unlike the previous records, this was more of a sporadic creation of mood, and in a way it's more conceptually unified and consistent than most of their records (save the 1990 magnum opus Painkiller). The guitars and vocals are set just right in the mix, the drums solid and comfortable, the bass taking a backseat to the rest. I wasn't impressed with the leads on this disc but then neither was I all that enamored with them on British Steel. In one ear, out the opposite.\n\nPoint of Entry is indeed one of the least impressive of Priest's early offerings (about equal with Rocka Rolla in quality), but I feel like the negative reactions are often misrepresented or overinflated. It's still an enjoyable disc if you're in the proper mood or environment to experience it, even if the riffs and vocal hooks don't match up to the five albums leading up to it. Hell, I'd still take this in a heartbeat over any of the middling-to-crappy studio efforts the band released post-Painkiller, but there's no denying that around 50% of the content is stodgily average for a band who's prior ambitions launched them into the metallic stratosphere. If you're not on a desert drive, with time to kill, then there's not much reason to visit more than a handful of the songs. The lyrics are in general quite pedestrian. I should point out too that all of the best tunes here are remastered for the Metalogy boxed set compilation (2004) where they sound superior.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nBritish Steel is not an album requiring much introduction, since it's one of the most popular of Judas Priest's outings and one of the better known in all of the heavy metal spectrum. The English legends had already built up a staggering momentum by the time 1980 struck, and this put them well over the top into the living rooms and tape decks of enthusiasts the world, and many galaxies over. I've met extra-terrestrials from far down the nearest Spiral Arm who have this on their .mp3 player. Seriously, if you've not heard \"Breaking the Law\" by now then you're either three years old and under (in which case you've probably STILL been exposed to it, just not retained the chorus), or you're from some undiscovered tribe of aboriginals on some uncharted island who worship overhead air traffic as deities; in which case I should not be addressing 'you' in the second-person since it's unlikely you have the Intertrons.\n\nAnd it makes sense: British Steel is a more commercial venture, not unlike Hell Bent for Leather before it, only far better written. This album is a veritable hit machine, built for radio without abandoning the whole heaviness of the chords and distinctive screaming that got them to that point. Yet, some of the songs are so damned unforgettable that their appeal transcended wide beyond the borders of the metal/hard rock audience, as prevalent as it was through the 80s. Hell, a live version of pretty much the entire album was available to download and play in Rock Band. I have family members two generations removed that know \"Living After Midnight\". Despite this level of saturation, though, I would find it dishonest to qualify British Steel as one of my very favorites from the band. Essential to own? Probably. Consistent? For the most part. But I've long felt that there were a few chinks in its armor which brokered the album's dominion from an empire to a fiefdom. A killer fiefdom that hosts a large range of jousts and events, mind you, but it couldn't win a war with its more stunning and grandiose siblings like Stained Class, Sin After Sin, Screaming for Vengeance or Painkiller.\n\nI've already mentioned \"Breaking the Law\", and where would we be without it? The vocal patterns are so pristine that they truly feel as if they've been engraved into the razor blade on the cover along with the logo and album title. The melodic lead-in guitar pattern is a thing of legend, learned by hundreds of thousands of aspiring six-stringers, and the chugging aggression of the chorus is enough to start a riot in any crowd of inebriated or even sober witnesses. Not to mention the atmosphere on the vocals, and the fact that the whole tune clocks in at around 2 and a half minutes. Concise and mother fucking immortal. \"Living After Midnight\" is the other giant in the room, with its party rock guitars and chorus that might just as well have been attributed to KISS or the Rolling Stones; but then you've got this 'second string' of semi-legendary tracks that have become regulars in the band's set list throughout the decades. The forceful, airy power metal staple \"Rapid Fire\" which has been emulated to precision in hundreds of cases; the mid-paced stadium anthem \"Metal Gods\" with its burly chords and laconic but hooky chorus; the dark grooves of \"Grinder\" and highway ready \"Steeler\", both of which would spawn bands using the titles as monikers (as other Priest songs had done in the past).\n\nSo what's my hangup? The rest of the album. I can forgive \"The Rage\" for its reggae-like introduction since the chords in the verse swagger with a particular degree of bad-assery, and I enjoy the flecks of rust Rob Halford places on the vocal lines. But the arena anthem \"United\", despite its cheesy melodic chorus, simply does not stand out to memory, paling in comparison to \"Metal Gods\" from the very same album, and suffering from a pretty generic guitar riff even for 1980. Not sure why this was chosen for a single. As for \"Don't Have to Be Old to Be Wise\", I would not have even remembered the song was on British Steel were I not listening again to review it, a pretty bare bones hard rock track without much appeal to the chorus, though it certainly feels classic Priest in its execution. All things considered, neither of these is necessarily a 'bad' song, just painfully average and overshadowed by the many great tracks that would catapult the band even further into the collective metal conscience. Another slight nuisance is the lack of devastating leads. A lot of the songs have them, but they get lost in the shuffle and often feel more atmospheric than impressive, even in the bigger numbers.\n\nProduction is good and dry, clean and appropriate for the mainstream steamrolling that the album would take straight to the bank, but perhaps not one of their best in terms of driving the songs into my noggin. This was the first album with new drummer Dave Holland, who would remain with Priest for six studio efforts before Scott Travis came in for Painkiller, but his output isn't all that wild here. Capable and dependable, like most of the albums he would appear on, and certainly heavy enough to add some ballast to the riffing, but not quite the powerhouse equivalent of his successor. Ian Hill's bass is present, but hardly exemplary and I feel it does get lost under the dry, ruddy industrial strength sheen of the chords; while Halford is his normal self, but he's not executing the same screaming and variation that he manifests on earlier (and later) works. Lyrically, too, this was never one of their most interesting records, especially tracks like \"United\" which have the poignancy of a kindergartner reciting the Pledge of Allegiance while privately thinking how he's going to stealth a few hours on his dad's XBOX later that evening.\n\nIn the end, though, the songs really win out here. At least six of them, and British Steel earns its keep despite the sagging, unremarkable middle cuts. Certainly the first 15 minutes of the album are comparable in quality to nearly anything else in their catalog, and its logical that this would be one of their better sellers in England and the States. Heavily promoted, and not surprisingly, defined as a major milestone in the genre due to its success and the utter stickiness of some of the songs.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nRather than waste my time and yours vomiting over the dozen or so other approved and unapproved collections of Judas Priest material that have been released into the open arms of suckers through the past 30 years, I'll instead focus on the only one that matters: the special edition Metalogy boxed set from 2004, which features 4 discs and a bonus DVD swathed in mock leather and studs. Now, this thing isn't cheap, it'll probably put you out at least 40 bucks US if you can find it today, but trust me when I say that it's worth the cost for any diehard follower of the band's legacy. There are a few areas in which it could have used some improvement, honing it into a near perfect product, but hands down this is superior to garbage like the Metal Works '73-'93 collection or the Gull cash-in Hero, Hero which muddles with the first two albums, and a damn sight better than the rest.\n\nAnd it's not the packaging or the sheer wealth of content here that's impressive. No, if Metalogy was a mere reprinting of 65 cuts from the albums with no tinkering, it'd be a heaping helping of useless shit. The audio remastering of every cut on the four audio discs is absolutely phenomenal. In fact, in almost all cases, these are the very versions of the songs I prefer to experience. The leads, the cutting vocals, the reverb levels sound incredibly across all the eras of the band's material, and even though you're not getting the lion's share of their catalog, you're at least getting all the hits that you'd expect at a Priest gig, and then some. In particular, I dug how the selections from Point of Entry and Turbo, two of the band's more divisive albums seem to have a harder edge to them here that makes them flush with the more aggressive material from Ram It Down, Painkiller and so forth. \"Desert Plains\", \"Solar Angels\", \"Troubleshooter\" and \"Heading Out to the Highway\" sound so fucking great, and the guitar tone on \"Turbo Lover\" and \"Private Property\" seems to be brought out a little richer than it was on the original release of the album. The leads take my breath away...and as someone who does not own any of the indivdidual remastered albums, the value skyrocketed.\n\nThat said, one of the downsides to Metalogy is that there's very little to no rare content included. Most of the previously unreleased to CD material are live tunes drawn from B-sides or promotional EPs, titles like \"The Hellion/Electric Eye\", \"Grinder\", \"Breaking the Law\", \"Starbreaker\", etc. Granted, the live songs replace their studio incarnations in the lineup (circumventing any possible redundancy), and sound every bit as great but I would have loved if there were an entire disc of remastered rarities. As it stands, the only track new to me was the \"Heart of a Lion\" demo, a leftover from the Turbo sessions, and it's not much to write home about, trumped by just about anything that made it onto that record. Also, I don't see much need in including the Tim 'Ripper' Owens fronted material here. It's tucked gently away on the last four tracks of the fourth audio CD, where it belongs chronologically, but considering how recent this stuff was at the time of the compilation's release I would have rather had four more remastered classics. After all, I dislike Jugulator and Demolition quite a bit and I can't imagine anyone caring about it...\n\nThey could have at least clipped these and fattened up the selection from Rocka Rolla, which consists of only \"Never Satisfied\". But of course they want to acknowledge that sad, sad period of their career...so we can compare and contrast it to how good they were leading up to it?! Otherwise, Metalogy is a beast due solely to the sound quality, and well worth spinning on your car or home stereo as a proxy to the original albums (though you'd be missing a lot of great songs). The DVD included here is a reprint of the old Priest VHS known simply as Judas Priest Live, from a Tennessee gig in 1982, redubbed Live Vengeance '82. Stock, cult footage, nothing special, but nice to have here instead of shelling out for the independent DVD release. At any rate, despite it's rather 'tough' looking exterior, it's packed in there pretty tightly, enough that it might be worth ripping in high quality and then leaving on your rack for display, but aside from that fact and the shocking dearth of rarities, it's the one comp in over 40 years of this band's career you'll want. Skip the bullshit like The Chosen Few (tracks selected by famous metal celebrities) and grab Metalogy while you can still find it.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nStained Class was the third masterful album in the 1976-1984 'hot streak' of what is indisputably one of England's most exciting bands of the period. Excluding Point of Entry, each of the individual records the band released was overflowing with songwriting envied the world over, and though there were clear 'hits' among the batch, even here, it's the sort of experience you can still sit through today, 30+ years later and enjoy from beginning to end with painfully few hurdles between them. The cover is iconic, rather artsy for its day and age (even compared to the three previous albums) and for some reason always reminds me of wacky sci-fi pinball machines. And I LOVE wacky sci-fi pinball machines, so you know where this is going...\n\nIt's often considered to have a 'cleaner' production than its predecessors, a point which I don't exactly debate, but frankly I thought albums like Rocka Rolla and Sad Wings of Destiny sounded great, so all I really heard was that it felt like a more developed set of songs. Rob Halford was starting to grow more and more into his screams, the strut of Ian Hill's bass was a sound anchor to the generally higher pitched guitar line, the bluesy and reined in distortion of the rhythm guitars was very clear while retaining a full body, and Les Binks' steady and polished pounding was pretty intense for the time, if not incredibly adventurous. This album actually had quite a number of moments where the band returned to some of the groovy rocking of the debut, with the Led Zeppelin/Cream feel of the licks, but even here they strike it rich by executing an unflinching sense for catchiness and an atmosphere and aesthetic that places it in the arcades, roller rinks and high schools of the late 70s. In fact, while it might seem a strange observation, I think this was a pretty cool record even for disenfranchised disco fanatics to find shelter in.\n\nThere is just so much you could say about \"Exciter\" alone, but it's only the first track on the album. Rob's chorus has the ability to burn itself straight into your memory, and the shuffling pace of the rhythm guitars in the verse provides one of the more memorable. Lots of little nuances here, like the 'bow to your knees...' break which Venom would later adapt rhythmically into one of their own famous lines. Or the epic transition of the bridge (around 2:00) where they transform it into a near rock opera with the layered harmony. Or the dual melodies deeper in the track which spawned a million impersonators in power metal with their classical rhythmic configuration. The leads are great, not a lick wasted, and it's simply one of the best fucking songs this band has ever written, fairly advanced and progressive when paired up against even the better songs off Sin After Sin or Sad Wings...\n\nFortunately, the album has a far deeper roster. No one is warming the bench this time out, whether he or she prefers the searing wails over the driving hard blues of \"White Heat, Red Hot\", the iron grooves and shrill seasonings of \"Saints in Hell\" which feels like a track Sabbath might have written and passed off to Priest since they know the Birmingham gods could do it much better. The panning of those chords in the bridge is so testosterone inducing epic that you could probably plug in a car battery and some Dr. Emmett Brown pseudo-science and transport yourself back to any major conflict in history. \"Savage\" makes you want to beat back smilodons with a giant mammoth-bone maul, and then of course you've got \"Beyond the Realms of Death\" with its glimmering acoustic intro and driving mid-paced metal eruption that I often use as a meter to determine who can or can not be my friend. They also pull out another of their classy covers here with a version of Spooky Tooth's \"Better By You, Better Than Me\" (from the previous decade) which is so bad ass sexy that members of the opposite (or sometimes, the same) gender will immediately begin gyrating and stripping.\n\nI haven't yet mentioned \"Invaders\", or \"Heroes End\", each of which could serve as an alternate energy source for Western civilization once the petrol wells run dry. Stained Class is so saturated in greatness that it almost begins to feel claustrophobic, and there isn't a song written for this which can't turn back the dials of time to a point at which the emerging metal genre felt so fresh, inventive, and lethal. The leads blaze with a bluesy abandon into your subconscious, and Rob's sharp-edged pitch is not something he refrains from using to its fullest here. How many power, trad or speed metal singers do you hear lately that have even a minute fraction of this guy's immediate distinction? Brilliant, slicing harmonies everywhere. The lyrics here also reached a new plateau of restless imagery and relevance, proving that the infant extremity of this genre had the potential for a literary, not pedestrian message. Frankly, I would not have thought it possible that Sin After Sin could be trumped in such a short span of time, but for Judas Priest that took only about a year. Perhaps not a 100% flawless record, there may be a note or two that I scoff at or a riff that sinks below the rest, but nonetheless an essential, timeless experience which is mandatory for anyone who dares call him/herself 'metal'.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nThat Judas Priest could follow up a masterpiece like Stained Class with another great album so quickly was nothing short of a miracle, so I can probably forgive this 1978 successor if it does possess a marginally higher ratio of filler to the truly captivating material. By this time they had proven to be one of the most productive and consistent acts in the hard rock spectrum, destroying peers like Black Sabbath who were starting to dive in quality around this time, and continuing to expand the number of unforgettable songs they could fuse into their existing live sets by at least 3-4 on this very disc. For once, also, we Americans didn't get the short end of the stick: we got the version with the better title, not to mention the Fleetwood Mac cover. Yeah, yeah, fuck you, across-the-ponders.\n\nI kid, of course, but though Killing Machine was a decent and extreme cliche for a metal record in the 70s, Hell Bent for Leather is simply put one of the best album brands I've ever seen among the tens of thousands in memory. However, either is a fitting label for the amount of aggression Priest have put into this record, the primary characteristic which differentiates it from its direct predecessor. Stylistically, there's not much of a gulf between the two, but the chords hit a lot harder, the heavier songs seem a lot more gnarly and vicious. One of the reasons for this is Halford's delivery, which on a tune like \"Hell Bent for Leather\" or \"Take On the World\" was downright nasty as he focused more on placing a gritty, barbaric edge to his lower and mid ranged. In fact, the screams don't really define his presence on this album like they did on Stained Class: truly, they still existed, but there is admittedly more variety in general with this album. Not that the vocals are better, necessarily, but it's good to know that Rob had no intention of discontinuing his growth.\n\nI always caught a vibe of an almost science fiction, apocalyptic undercurrent to this record which likely stems from the tapping/effects used in tunes like \"Burnin 'Up\" or the title track, but really the album seems to travel all over the place. \"Take on the World\" could be viewed as a progenitor to the whole Manowar, muscle metal trend, since lyrically and musically the New Yorkers have spent over half their career simulating it (even the vocals seem like they had a huge influence on Joey DeMaio). The anthem-esque shouts of the vocal harmonies, the simple cadence of the war drums, and the simple chord structure. They do a huge Zeppelin groove in \"Evil Fantasies\", an almost KISS-like swagger to \"Killing Machine\", and a further, bluesy boogie to \"Rock Forever\" with wild, almost conversational vocals in the verse that burst into incredible screams and chorus harmonies. There's even a straight up, psychedelic/prog rock ballad in \"Before the Dawn\", which while admittedly is one of the least interesting or impressive on the album, shows that they've still got that same dynamic range they did years earlier on the debut.\n\nBut none of those songs are the best here, and in fact a number of them settle into the 'above average' range which ensured you wouldn't be seeing them on a whole lotta set lists. There are four in particular which shine brighter than the remainder. \"Delivering the Goods\" flexes a little of Glenn Tipton's whammy wanking and tapping as it drives from a memorable, saturated blues metal lick into a total bad ass (though obvious) chorus. \"Running Wild\" is a prototype power/heavy metal song that even bands like Iron Maiden would emulate (in the central riff), not to mention that, like \"Exciter\" on the previous album, would transfer over to provide the musical inspiration and moniker of another legendary metal outfit. \"Evening Star\" has a gorgeous intro with clean guitars that sounds like something The Cult would pull, but explodes into a friendly but truly catchy chorus. And last but not least, one of the finest rock-to-metal transformations in history in the band's cover of \"Green Manalishi (with the Two-Pronged Crown)\", so good that I feel it surpasses the original Fleetwood Mac version. Pure, mid-gait fuel injection rock & roll under a wailin', bluesy salsa with Les Binks riding that hi-hat for all it's worth.\n\nUltimately, this is not the crown jewel in the Judas Priest legacy, but it's got enough value that I still find myself listening decades down the line, even through its entirety. The pacing of the record is pretty sweet, but there are only a few points at which it creates that same level of breathless exhilaration that I felt from Sin After Sin or Stained Class. The lyrics are marginally more generic, creating a biker/party atmosphere that lacks the same depth, and it almost seems as if they were providing a blue collar alternative to their more heady material. That said, when it does shine, we're talking 'greatest hits' good for the songs I mentioned in that last 'graph, and the iconic cover image and status as the Les Binks 'swansong' with Priest ensure that it belongs in your collection alongside the more refined ambitions of its elder '78 sibling.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nA Touch of Evil: Live isn't the worst of the Judas Priest live offerings, but considering that it was recorded across numerous tours and following up a pair of double disc releases (fronted by Tim 'Ripper' Owens), you would think that Epic Sony and the band would desire to unleash something far more substantial. At just under an hour, it's not exactly a dearth of material, but clearly the skimpiest they put out since Unleash in the East, only without the awesome working in its favor. Don't get me wrong, it was great to have Rob back in the band and I'm always excited to check out live material and see just how he's held up over so many years, but the heavy focus on newer songs was hardly a boon, and there's just not enough here that I'd recommend spending money on it.\n\nI was neither a fan of Angel of Retribution nor its bloated and boring successor Nostradamus, so the inclusion of four tracks from these records out of a total of 11 did not sit well with me. Of course they were going to be present, because the band has traditionally introduced the more recent material into the live records each decade, but opening the disc with \"Judas Priest\" and \"Hellrider\" was not in its favor. Both are acceptable but painfully average tracks, lacking the catchy melodic chorus lines or the intensity of the band's better songs. Halford gives a fair performance, he's lost some of his range but still better than the lion's share of other heavy metal singers out there half his age, and the guitars have the expected heaviness and chugging you'd expect from a very natural live performance post-Painkiller. However, the even newer tracks like \"Prophecy\" are yet more bland, despite the orchestration with the keys and Rob giving it his grimy best. Just as much a drag on stage as they seemed in the studio.\n\nSo it's really up to the rest of the track list to compensate, which it certainly strives to do. Painkiller is fairly well represented with \"Between the Hammer & the Anvil\", \"A Touch of Evil\" (of course) and \"Painkiller\" itself which I doubt the band will ever leave off a live album since it's creation. The songs don't have that same enthusiastic energy that they once had when I was seeing the group gig in the early 90s, but then again that was 15-20 years in the past and with age comes some inevitable slowdown. That said, the leads sound pretty great here, the guitars good and choppy and the crowd response never tramples the performance. The earlier classics include \"Eat Me Alive\" (Defenders of the Faith), \"Riding on the Wind\" (Screaming for Vengeance), \"Beyond the Realms of Death\" (Stained Class) and \"Dissident Aggressor\" (Sin After Sin), the last of which sounds like a pretty decent update with the harsher vocals and the chugging grime applied to the guitars and serves as my personal highlight for this collection.\n\nAll in all, though, there is little or no reason to hunt this down unless you're a huge fan of the newer albums and wanted to hear Rob singing a few tunes that he hadn't done on the previous lives Priest...Live! and Unleashed in the East. There is simply not that much going on here, outside of proof positive that the band still 'has it' as they approach retirement. A second disc would have benefited this greatly, especially as the material was drawn from entire tours. There was nothing else we could have tossed on here after...how many gigs? The meager rationing of A Touch of Evil: Live isn't even a match for Live in London.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nInitially, I wasn't going to include Live in London in my coverage of the Judas Priest discography, because, frankly, I couldn't be bothered to track it down and add it to my collection after being underwhelmed by the very similar '98 Live Meltdown. But, thankfully I've got friends who are far more thorough and obsessive than I am over particular bands, and as it turns out, Live in London is actually a step better than its predecessor in terms of delivering a more memorable performance from the newer singer. Not so much that I would plunk my money down to find a copy, but enough that I could recommend it over Meltdown to anyone seeking out it's probably the definitive 'Ripper' Owens Priest experience without actually being there in person.\n\nThis was issued as both a DVD and CD, and as usual I'd advise everyone to just go for the DVD since that has extra footage and multi-sensory rewards. The caveat is that I believe this audio double disc has more actual songs from the set than the DVD incarnation. Either way, it's Ripper's last official release with the band, and the last that would be issued through SPV/Steamhammer before Priest returned to the major Columbia for the reunion with Rob Halford. Unlike the other gulfs between live efforts, Live in London was only five years after '98 Live Meltdown so the set list hasn't changed a lot, and in fact about 19 of the cuts are retreads from that double album. Some of the Jugulator material (\"Bullet Train\", \"Death Row\", and \"Abductors\") and Painkiller (\"Metal Meltdown\", \"Night Crawler\") selections have been nixed here in favor of Demolition pieces like \"One on One\", \"Feed On Me\" and \"Hell is Home\", and a few added classics, but in general this is mostly a similar experience in terms of its flow and content.\n\nHowever, I think Live in London unquestionably sounds superior, in both the tightness of the musicians' performance, and the swell of the crowd's volume. This is because it was all taken from a single set at Brixton Academy in December of 2001, and thus you don't have all those constant edits to mix and match tighter tunes from numerous gigs. This is how it played out, on that night, and we get to experience it forevermore. But most importantly, while he's still not and never will be Rob Halford, Tim Owens sounds far more refined here than on the previous double-live. His tone is better, his pitch richer, and he relies more or an inherent sense of melody than the angrier disposition he had a few years before. He'd apparently come a long way with the band by this point, and likely thought he was in it for the long haul, and quite frankly if he had kept moving in this positive direction he might damn well have deserved it. In particular he gleams on the classics like \"Electric Eye\" and the unexpected \"Desert Plains\". I don't give much of a damn for the Demolition material, it's one of the worst of Priest's discography, but even these songs sound a little more alive in this setting, despite their dullness.\n\nTechnically it's not a huge difference from '98 Live Meltdown, but I feel as if the band played tighter, the chugging of the guitars and the force of the chords was more impacting, and it feels more genuine. It's without any doubt my favorite audio of this band with Owens (studio-wise I'll stick with the Winters Bane record Heart of a Killer), and if you've got to choose any live offering from the Metal Gods post-80s, then it might not be a poor decision. There are flaws, there are imperfections, and there is still that pervasive sense of a band covering itself due to the different vocalist, but there is more content here than Touch of Evil: Live, and the swarthy sound of the mix sounds great coming from the speakers. Not bad, and a fitting way to send this lad off, and set the band back on track after the whole sidestep that was 1996-2003.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nIt seems with each iteration of the Judas Priest live record, the contents are swelling alongside the body of studio work they can drawn upon, so '98 Live Meltdown, with over two hours of content, is justifiably the fattest exchange for your currency. Alas, this is one of the Tim 'Ripper' Owens fronted lives, so anyone seeking to experience the magnificence of Rob Halford performing Painkiller tunes to an audience on disc will be out of luck for several more years (beyond the obvious bootleg alternative). I bring up Painkiller, because this is probably where Owens grates on me the least in these 24 tracks. He uses a lower, more feral approach than Halford, more like a David Wayne or Udo Dirkschneider, but the raw aggression of his voice does work well with the heavier tunes from that album like \"Night Crawler\", \"Metal Meltdown\" or \"Painkiller\" itself.\n\nUnfortunately, I can't really say the same of the numerous early classics that populate the double album. His inflection on tunes like \"Metal Gods\", \"Electric Eye\", \"Grinder\" and \"The Sentinel\" might seem beefy enough to get the fists and necks of the crowd pumping, since they already paid for their tickets to the gig, but it's by no means exemplary or proof positive for me of why this guy was chosen to front the band. I suppose there's a certain barroom appeal, that the hard working everyman can live out his dreams (as captured by that Mark Wahlberg film loosely based on Owens' ascent to Priest), but hearing these tunes with anything other than the siren of Staffordshire is just not a satisfying return on my investment. Perhaps I could forgive the dearth of quality due to the quantity of Meltdown's selections, but that's like paying for an eight course meal of mediocrity. Who does that? To top off the disappointment, there are a number of lame Jugulator tracks here like \"Blood Stained\", \"Bullet Train\", \"Burn in Hell\", \"Death Row\" and \"Abductors\" which sound no more exciting or memorable here than they did in the studio. Makes sense, since they were still heavily promoting and touring on the album, but each time one comes up I feel an impetus to hit the 'skip' button.\n\nThe audience interaction here does feel fresh and flush, which is surprising since this was recorded across numerous dates on the tour and meshed together. The guitars feel a lot more raw than they did on the previous Judas Priest...Live! over a decade earlier, but this matches the heavier modus operandi the band had been pursuing since Ram It Down. Scott Travis was obviously a more powerful presence on the drums than his predecessors, and the guy shines through the recording, but I felt the bass a little subdued, and the delivery of the guitar chords and chugs to seem somewhat sloppier, forgiving that the work involved was more technical. Certain climaxes in songs like \"The Ripper\", \"A Touch of Evil\" and \"Breaking the Law\" seem less effective than they do elsewhere, and really there are points on the discs where it feels like a complete cover band. On the other hand, there is something genuine and workmanlike about the more raw approach than the last two, so it's not that this is some complete failure or even all that offensive to the ears, because it feels very much 'live' and in your face and the 90s were pretty much THAT decade for the Brits.\n\nI picked up this album for the same reasons I picked up Jugulator, or the Blaze Bayley era records of Iron Maiden, to give this new vocalist a chance and continue to support a band that had entertained me for many years before. Ultimately, though, there is almost zero possibility of me ever choosing this over the first two lives if I'm in the mood for Priest in the stage setting, and even the far more limited duration 2009 release A Touch of Evil: Live is preferable. Owens is not a poor front man, he engages the audience and does his best with the weapons he was given. I thought he was fine on \"Painkiller\", and he didn't necessarily do any disservice to the weaker tracks of Jugulator, but his presence in the band seems to be a hurdle I just can't get past, and one of the major obstacle which delegates this to the realm of the 'average'. Granted, I would rather sit through this than either of studio albums the guy sang on, or both of them combined, but it's not among the live efforts in my collection I feel compelled to dust off for even an infrequent listen.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nAfter releasing two of not only their best albums, but two of the best metal albums of all time (Screaming for Vengeance and Defenders of the Faith), Judas Priest went all in. Instead of playing it safe and releasing another similar album, pleasing the fans with maybe some minor complaints of being a little repetitive, the band decided to experiment with their next album Turbo. Originally meant to be a double album with material from Ram it Down and be known as Twin Turbos, only the first nine songs made the cut. And thus, Judas Priest's most controversial album was born. Adding in elements of synth and pop characteristics of the then-rising genre of hair metal, the band no doubt incited massive backlash from their legions of fans who longed for the days of Breaking the Law and You've Got Another Thing Comin'. But what many fans to realize is, behind the new bells and whistles and glossy coat of paint, it's still Judas Priest and Turbo is still a a pretty good album.\n\nThe main change of this album is the presence of more electronic keyboard/synth elements, often times used to distort the guitars and give them a more computerized and electric feel. But no, Glenn Tipton and K.K, Downing's superb guitarwork is not \"corrupted.\" On the contrary. Not only do the riffs have a cool cyber feel to them, they still deliver shredding guitar solos on nearly every track. And while there are certainly more pop and \"feel-good\" elements in the songs' melodies and choruses reminiscent of hair and glam metal, vocalist Rob Halford has never missed a step, and this album is no exception. While not shrieking quite as high as he did on songs such as Screaming for Vengeance or Freewheel Burning, more times than not Halford is singing in the higher registers while still utilizing his famous baritone. And while pop influences mean the lyrics aren't quite as rebellious or in-your-face as Judas Priest is known for, there's still plenty of songs based on love, sex, and rock n' roll. Turbo Lover gives you the feeling of actually speeding down the road and launching into outer space with its electronic and synth sound effects and intense build-up (coupled with lyrics consisting of hilariously cheesy double entendres). Private Property is medium-paced but has one heck of a catchy chorus, and Rock You All Around the World is fast and fun. Out in the Cold is an interesting power ballad that starts off soft and builds up in intensity and heaviness, and Reckless is an extremely solid rocker. \n\nWhile many of the songs on Turbo utilize synth sound effects and have a lighter pop feel, this is still by and large a Judas Priest album. Rob Halford is still singing, Downing and Tipton are still shredding, and Turbo is still metal. Just because a band like Judas Priest was willing to change and experiment, that does not mean they completely forgot who they were. Diehard fans will still most likely be polarized, but if you've never listened to the album, don't listen to everything you hear. Give it a listen, you might be surprised to find it's still a Judas Priest. And a pretty underrated one at that.\n",
        "\nPriest...Live! might lack the personality and controversy surrounding the first Judas Priest live effort Unleashed in the East, but it compensates by providing a natural update to the band's canon in that it doesn't seek to retread the use of the 70s material in the set list. So, for the fan of the band's 80s period, this was the 'modern' Priest, and since they had been pursuing a new style for their latest studio outing Turbo, it makes a whole lotta sense, really. Would that they had stuck to this policy of recording only newer material for subsequent offerings of this sort, one per decade, I'd have a savage respect for the squad, but due to the change in singers and the long gaps in their recorded output through the ensuing decades, that would not turn out to be the case.\n\nSo the tracks chosen for this set were once again culled from numerous dates performed in June '86 at The Omni in Atlanta, Georgia and the Reunion Arena in Dallas, Texas. Having seen the band a few times here in the States, I can vouch for their collective professionalism and explosive sets across the aeons, but what I enjoyed the most about this offering was simply that I got to hear a number of tunes in the set that I don't normally or would never again normally expect on any of their big tours. Namely because it incorporates a bunch of the Turbo material. \"Out in the Cold\", \"Rock You All Around the World\", \"Private Property\", \"Parental Guidance\" and of course \"Turbo Lover\". That last one is admittedly a fixture at many of their gigs, but to hear the others from such a divisive record (which I happen to enjoy) is pretty sweet. I'm not sure of the validity of using \"Out in the Cold\" as the opener, it feels mildly lethargic (as it does on the studio incarnation) and doesn't exactly build up the listener's excitement, but for all I know they didn't actually do the songs in anything near this order at the actual dates. Otherwise, the material sounds pretty smooth. The synthesizer elements aren't as wild as they were on Turbo, Rob's voice is well sharpened and right on the money, and the guitar chords sound robust without leeching from the rest of the band.\n\nOf course, this was also the first opportunity for me to have a live album with some of my favorites from their earlier 80s material, some of which numbered among my favorites of that period. Obviously the huge hits like \"Breaking the Law\", \"You've Got Another Thing Comin'\", \"Heading Out to the Highway\" and \"Living After Midnight\" were included in the set, after all these were the ones loading up their bank accounts, but I was also pretty excited for versions of \"The Hellion/Electric Eye\", \"Freewheel Burning\", \"Metal Gods\" and \"The Sentinel\", all of which sound pretty clean here, though occasionally too clean that they come of so polished that some of the natural, inherent aggression seems leeched. I feel like this is due to the mass levels of reverb and expansive sound that were likely needed to fill these arenas, but they still sound pretty close to their studio counterparts, although a few of the lead sequences are altered. The crowd response sounds a lot more genuine than Unleashed in the East, and Rob's voice a little broader and less piercing, and then there's the fact that this is simply more substantial of an offering at well over 70 minutes and nearly twice the set.\n\nPriest...Live! doesn't carry that same nostalgic value I had for the first album, and some of the songs seem a little too tidy and restrained, but I'll take this any day over the Ripper-led live albums the band would produce many years later, and it's nice that the band decided not to rehash the material from Unleashed in the East, as if to let it all stand on its own as a documentation of the band's evolution. Or, they were likely just tired of those songs by the mid-80s. Ultimately, though, this is worth a pick up only to those who are not turned off by the heavy presence of Turbo. In recent years I've been starting to fancy live albums that feel more focused and authentic (from a single gig), but looking back at the past favorites this was almost never the case. Priest...Live! is certainly not a favorite from this period, but it does its job enough to satisfy an ear attuned to Screaming With Vengeance, British Steel, Defenders of the Faith, Turbo, etc.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nIt's difficult not to be sentimental over Unleashed in the East, since it was one of my first metal records, and certainly the first live album I ever owned, gifted to me at an age so ripe and impressionable that it helped plant the seeds of rebellion forevermore into my skull. That I hadn't the slightest clue back then what sort of music I was listening to goes without saying, I was just barely old enough to start kicking my training wheels. I had no inkling of where Japan was on a map, or that I'd ever become a culture-o-phile for that country. I had no idea what leather pants were, or that the man so stalwartly thrusting his microphone into the air above him had little interest in the googly eyes of the female audience members no doubt staring down his lightly haired chest and inviting handcuffs. Or that the person on the left of the cover wasn't a woman. Or that this record was stylistically distanced from the others I owned by KISS, Van Halen or the J. Geils Band. All I could understand was that it was exciting. Fresh. That it rocked. That I wanted MORE.\n\nI could do my best to beat back the tears and memories, to take a more objective view of this first Judas Priest live album, but any way I try to slice it, any aural lens through which I glean it, any meat grinder I attempt to render its fats and proteins through, it's still a fucking kickass experience for the young and old, man and woman, square or hesher. Captured at a pair of Tokyo locations on their February, 1979 tour (their second in Japan), and produced by long term collaborator Tom Allom, it translated the sheer intensity and promise of the band's studio backlog straight to the stage, and helped to promote the worldwide domination of the heavy metal medium in the years (and decades) to come. Wisely avoiding the debut Rocka Rolla in terms of its set list, Unleashed in the East instead concentrates on the blazing aggression that would inspire a thousand neck strained followers to form their own musical endeavors in its wake. I've got the nine-track, US issue of the album, so it's lacking some of the content that the Japanese version has, but even considering those omissions it's easily one of the best lives in my collection, standing alongside Maiden's Live After Death and Destruction's Live Without Sense as a mandatory purchase in its medium.\n\nNothing too complicated, just 45 minutes of excellence spanning some of the best heavy/power metal of the 70s. Cuts like \"Exciter\" and \"The Ripper\" are a given, pumping the crowd into a polite frenzy as they witness the future unfold before them. However, the moodier and more extensive \"Victim of Changes\" feels superior even to its studio version on Sad Wings of Destiny. The guitars are meatier, the psychedelic breakdown feels more vibrant and the tiny spikes of the lead guitar gleam like they were just affixed to the shoulders of some new leather jacket. The cover of Joan Baez' \"Diamonds and Rust\" is present, not to mention that of Fleetwood Mac's \"Green Manalishi (with the Two-Pronged Crown)\" which completely rules to the point that I couldn't believe it wasn't their tune to begin with. Rounding out the track list you get a pair of additional greats from Sad Wings of Destiny: \"Genocide\" and \"Tyrant\"; \"Sinner\" from Sin After Sin, and \"Running Wild\" from their latest studio album at the time, Hell Bent for Leather (US title). A formidable selection, even for so early in their career.\n\nThe sound is still as rich and bright to me as it was when I first listened through it, the crowd's response ebbing and flowing gracefully into the mix at appropriate times. Obviously a little studio wizardry went into the recording to prep it for market, but Unleashed in the East seems so authentic that it would be hard to imagine they tweaked with much outside of the vocal overdubs (which Rob admits to) and maybe a solo or two. Some also say the audience is part faked, not beyond the realm of possibility. We might never know. The vocals are grafted with a good amount of echo, and even where he can't quite emulate the multi tracking of his studio performance (like the important scream in the first few lines of \"The Ripper\"), he still exhibits that he was quite possibly the best in the entire business at this time. Ian Hill's bass lines feel fluid and corporeal, while the two guitars are slicing, crisp and panned out into their respective tracks that converge on the listener like a pair of horseshoes being simultaneously tossed onto the same spike. Les Binks, who had gelled with the band after two studio outings, sounds like a beast here, taut and peppy but capable of lots of rumbling fills that dress up the riffs in a skirt of natural savagery.\n\nThe pacing is great for the order of the set here, the mix sincere and potent, the riffs melt your face, and even the cover image to this thing seems iconic, one of the best pure shots of a metal band in action that you'll ever witness. So wonderfully does it capture the time and place of this recording, with the smoke and lights that once served as crucial components in the stage show (and still do). The Anglicized 'kana figures seem a bit cheesy, but they fit the modus operandi and create just the right level of ignorant Western exoticism. Okay, so there's no motorcycle on the front cover. We can't win them all, but just about everything else on the album demands your immediate attention. One of the live essentials of British hardness. I've heard others that I prefer to this, and I wouldn't call it flawless, since I feel it could certainly have come across as more 'live' than this, but it's still up there. If you don't own this album by now, then clearly we old school nutters have failed at our duties, so while we address this oversight by flogging ourselves the full 40 lashes in the corner, go swipe your credit cards and make yourselves one album poorer (or more importantly, richer). Now, I wonder if my ass is too fat to fit on that old Huffy in the garage.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nDemolition presents somewhat of a conundrum to me, for while I felt that Tim 'Ripper' Owens was better integrated into the band's overall sound, there are many laughable, lame choices in songwriting and lyrics that I find it incredibly difficult to take this seriously. I mean, really, this should have been the album that evolved the few tracks laid out by Jugulator into something worth experiencing, not some phoned in devolution into weaker, pedestrian riffing that felt out of touch and out of place in the new century. Even the cover to this album is immensely lazy, with that goofy title font and the lack of even the corny steel-limbed shredder beasts that fronted the two albums before it. If something looks uninspired, then it quite likely could SOUND uninspired, and Demolition is a swollen, 70 minute waste deposit that drowns its few positives in sewer loads of swill and shit.\n\nLike Jugulator before it, the production was kept in the family here, with Glenn Tipton taking on the duties himself. I can't say that the album sounds all that terrible, because it's got a modern gloss and clarity to it that matches the dull thrashing clamor of its music. The chords and the endless chugging sequences are effectively punchy but vapid due to their basic and undeveloped notation, but they're flush with the volume of the drums and the more focused vocal lines. Ian Hill's bass-lines plunk along aggressively, but the problem is that the riff patterns being strewn out over him just feel like rehashes of Painkiller and Jugulator with mild differences, as if the band was, unsurprisingly, lazily trying to relive their past successes to no avail. Demolition is an album that would have GREATLY benefited from an outside input, in terms of the song quality. I mean, none of these are good, but the fact that they keep coming in an endless tide of mediocrity speaks to me that they might have tried to cut this down to 40-45 minutes of the most intense material. Demolition is an obese pedestrian in dire need of vehicular homicide...\n\n...and it doesn't take very long to sink to the bottom of the toilet bowl. \"Machine Man\" starts out with a Scott Travis drum solo redolent of...well, \"Painkiller\", before erupting into this dull cycle of chords and a chugging verse sequence. Owens feels more controlled and restrained, and as a result I think he's a better fit to the surge of the music. Unfortunately, that music fairly sucks, and once he breaks into the lyric lines of the pre-chorus/chorus I nearly fall out of my chair and puke coffee out of my nostrils. 'So you motherfuckers want to race/you've all got LOSER tattooed on your face!' They dress the song up with the spurious, wild little affected guitars that lead into a decent if forgettable lead, but it's incredibly haphazard and painfully average. The sad fact is that Demolition gets no better as it progresses. Mid-paced power/thrash tunes like \"One on One\" and \"Bloodsuckers\" often feel like they just rephrases some of the Painkiller licks, and not formed into a positive configuration.\n\nIt gets worse. \"Hell is Home\" sounds like some garbage Black Label Society track that lost its way into Tim Owens' vocal booth. \"Lost and Found\" is the requisite power ballad, and while Tim does a decent doppelganger of what Rob Halford might have sounded like phrasing the same track, it's incredibly mediocre musically, with lamentable blues lead lines. \"In Between\" follows a similar course, only with more electric guitars, but it still seems dull. Tracks that attempt to take on a more epic, atmospheric structure like \"Cyberface\" and \"Metal Messiah\" come up far short of their intention with the Eastern, lurching flavor (though Owens pulls off a couple decent hooks here, too little and too late), and really there is not a single piece here that I would incorporate on ANY highlight reel in reference to this particular band. I realize that moving over to a label like Steamhammer from CBS/Epic might have lessened expectations, but didn't the suits even give this album a listen before releasing it? It should have been confined to its demo reels.\n\nI don't know about you folks, but Judas Priest is not a band I turn to for generic, flatline drivel, and there's really no excuse for such an insipid recording from a band who once wrote classics like Sad Wings of Destiny, Sin After Sin, Screaming With Vengeance, and Painkiller. That this album would more or less put the nail in Ripper's coffin and eventually steer towards a reunion with the siren himself Rob Halford is no coincidence: just listen to this. Ironically, I don't think that Owens was primarily at fault here. His delivery was solid and concentrated, if not exemplary; he just had nothing interesting to sing over, and don't be surprised that these tracks (and those from Jugulator) find themselves increasingly absent from both the memory of the audience and any future set lists.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nWhen I think back on the Tim 'Ripper' Owens era of Judas Priest I have to consider it against the greater schema of the band's legacy and my reactions to it. By the time Painkiller had been released, it was in my opinion the pinnacle of their career. They were touring arenas, kicking asses everywhere, much to the surprise of those who might have felt underwhelmed at Turbo or Ram It Down, and they had honed their traditional nuance for catchy chorus melodies and huge, inspirational riffs to its most aggressive and memorable potential. They were, in short, on the top of the world, and I think they would have easily been forgiven, if after all that touring and murdering audiences, they took a break through most of the 90s to pursue solo projects and perhaps ease tensions in the ranks.\n\nBut that's just not how it panned out. The band wanted to continue without Rob Halford, and he wanted to try his hand and lungs at different sounds like the street-oriented thrashing groove outfit Fight, or the later NIN clone Two. The rest of the band had families to feed, a reputation to uphold, and a genuine desire to keep touring and enjoying the lifestyle and livelihood they had pursued for over 20 years. Granted, unless they had been pissing their money away on coke and gambling, these guys were probably already set for life. A well paid and well loved entity who could tour the world on short notice, and whose famous singles were so heavily embedded into radio rotation that royalties would be paying for the education of their great grandchildren. And, fuck it, as mediocre as their following studio output would prove, they had every right to go on about their business and leave Halford behind them.\n\nBut here's the problem: if you took the best elements of EVERY studio record this band would record post-Painkiller, with Owens OR Halford at the helm, and mashed them together into the skeleton of a single album, it would not be good enough to serve Painkiller its high tea. Or clip that album's hedges. Or deliver its milk to the door. In fact, I don't think a single full-length produced past 1990 could compete with any album the band released prior to that date, not even the heavily divisive efforts like Point of Entry or Turbo; and unfortunately, Jugulator, the debut of Rob Halford's 'replacement', was the first in the barrage of lackluster studio offerings which itself has now spanned nearly two decades. This is a downright miserable record which attempts to season the aggression of their magnum opus with a relish of darker, trendy thrashing 'tough guy' hostility (circa Pantera) while at the same time introducing a new voice which, despite an obviously earnest effort, fails to meet expectations.\n\nNow, everything I've read or seen of Tim Owens tells me that he's a stand up guy, with a good heart and a professional attitude. On a personal level, I think a chap like this deserves a shot. His performance on the Winters Bane debut Heart of a Killer seemed to suit him well, and he's a well practiced technical singer with a range, part of which encompassed the shrieking heights of his predecessor. This was no 'Blaze Bayley' choice. Priest were intent on snapping up someone who could handle their vast backlog of material without rocking and capsizing the boat. But for some reason, when listening to his throughput in either of the records he fronted for the metal gods, I can't help but think Owens tries too hard. Whether this was at the direction of the band veterans or producers or his own judgment is somewhat obfuscated, but his inflection always seems like a chameleon attempting to blend into a new environment rather just relaxing in its native climate.\n\nHis presence here is splattered with all manner of schizoid dynamics and special effects that are balanced off against a rather dry, central scream which is devoid of that same, piercing timbre that was so memorable about Halford. You can barely go through a handful of lyric lines on this album without some erratic, distracted bullshit happening, like the lame gang shouts in the first track (\"Jugulator\") itself, or the constant multi-tracked sneers and snarls or almost guttural vocals he uses to support his angrier mid range (\"Blood Stained\" and elsewhere). Again, on a technical basis, he hits his targets and does not shy away from the angrier persona required to complement the 'toughness' of the guitars' thrash orientation, but ultimately it feels the least genuine performance on any Priest record. Incredibly forced, as if you were to trace an image on paper, peel it off the original, then try and match them again physically to find that they weren't quite congruent.\n\nBut then, I can't really blame Owens for the underwhelming bravado of the musical composition, which lies squarely on the shoulders of the old timers. Predictable, power/thrash architecture which sacrifices much of the melodic, memory searing brilliance of the previous album for the sheer weight of force. The riffs and rhythm section are incredibly precise, with Downing and Tipton never backing down from their own physical exertion, but it's just so banal and boring. Manic, frivolous leads that build upon the Painkiller formula sans the catchiness, and even where the pair rips into tremolo picking sequences or churning hardcore/thrash grooves, they still do not seem to be able to implement this belligerence into anything that warrants recycled listens. Even after 15 years and numerous returns to re-evaluate Jugulator, I can find nothing new here, nothing 'grown' upon me, nothing subtle or interesting, just a washed out meat tenderizer to the face, bludgeoning away past its shelf life.\n\nSeriously, listen to the riffs in the verse of \"Blood Stained\" or the slower grooves in \"Abductors\". Any quartet of Pantera-driven 15 year-olds in my county in 1995 might have crafted a more compelling, violent groove than this mundane, muted patterns. Jugulator is not without some atmosphere, as they incorporate a lot of dour, cleaner guitars to let Owens resonate with his multi-tracked screams (much like Rob), but even at its most 'tender' moments the album feels like a dud. I can't imagine that if Halford were to jam with, say, Dimebag Darrell or Rob Flynn, that the results would turn out so soddenly average and uninspired. Are there a few exceptions? Perhaps \"Bullet Train\" maintains an interesting, mechanical aesthetic for 30 or so seconds, and the epic finale \"Cathedral Spires\" is stronger than everything leading up to it, but even these tunes have their moments of disinterest me like the bombastic bridge grooves of the latter.\n\nTo its credit, Jugulator is not the very worst of the Judas Priest records, nor is it as awful as other midlife crisis records like Risk, Diabolus in Musica, Virtual XI or St. Anger. It still draws a pretty clear lineage from the band's prior works in 1988-1990, and it feels distinctly 'Priest' even with Owens at the helm. I like the loud and abrasive production of Scott Travis' drums, and where the band layers on the effects and atmosphere, even the varied vocal tracks it all gels from a production standpoint as this modern evolution of their sound. The lyrics are very often trite and pedestrian but at least many of them have a relevant point. I just can't help but think that the Brits would have turned out better if they just waited for a reunion album (which did happen eventually) or toured with guest singers. Or maybe they should have just gone and hired Ralf Scheepers, whose wild and absurd tones feel like a better, more powerful match to the band's material for me (hell, for all my post-1990 JP needs I just turn to the better Primal Fear records like Black Sun, Nuclear Fire or Jaws of Death).\n\nThere simply aren't enough of those wonderful vocal melodies here for me to grasp, or volcanic guitar riffs that drove Painkiller into an instant, accessible immortality. Jugulator is heavy, and it tries to keep with the times, and I don't fault it for those traits, I simply wish they had been better implemented. The jump da fuck up chorus parts like in \"Blood Stained\" are like a terrible foreshadowing to crap like Drowningpool's \"Bodies\", and despite the myriad personalities of Owens' inflections, I never felt a genuine threat to the music, whereas \"Painkiller\" made me clutch my blankets in nervous sweat as I looked out into the night, fearing what might be coming down through the skyline in a wreath of irradiated fire. Jugulator seems little more than weak flesh being grafted onto a solid steel skeleton, and I'm no more able to get into it today than I was in 1997.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nLike skilled snipers sharpening in on their marks, it wouldn't take Judas Priest long to fire their fatal bullet. Sad Wings of Destiny might not be a complete digression from the groundwork they had laid with Rocka Rolla, but it's a far more focused record which puts to rest some of the indecision I felt on the debut. Where Rocka Rolla was teeming with the psychedelic rock and heavy blues influences of other British heroes, Priest refined their songwriting here to really strike out on their own, and one could argue that this was the 'birth' of the band we all know and love today, at least in the sense that tracing this point A to any later point B is a smoother course. This is still an admittedly '70s' sound, with some moody, almost tripped out moments strewn through the metallic surges, but I'll be damned if this isn't one of the better records of its type in the whole of the decade that fashion forgot.\n\nThe second and last record for the Gull imprint, whom they'd have a few issues with down the road (with the Hero, Hero reprint compilation the band shunned in '81), Sad Wings of Destiny would be heavily responsible for getting Priest signed to CBS, the major label on which they'd explode in the ensuing decade. It's not difficult to reason why, when you hear this thing. For one, the guitars and chorus hooks are far more determined and memorable, on nearly every track. I'm not incredibly enamored of the atmospheric ballad \"Dreamer Deceiver\", or the Queen-like piano/vocal piece \"Epitaph\", but just about every other song is gold. The riffs still tug upon the influences of Zeppelin, Cream, Sabbath and Thin Lizzy, but they've fashioned the chord sequences into progressions so powerful in places here that they rival any of their forebears, and there is a distinct increase in the use of 'chugged' guitar lines that flow rather well in the context of the bluesy, wailing leads and the incessant charisma of Rob Halford's piercing timbre.\n\nThough it wasn't my first experience with Priest (that would a Christmas Gift of their first live album Unleashed in the East from '79), this was the first studio album that I ever experienced from the band, probably around 1980-81, and even as a child I remember thinking just how powerful and creative the songs were. \"The Ripper\" is in particular an ambitious piece for its perfect use of momentum, the vocals and chugging setting up the rhythm section and a wicked sense for melody that felt like you were in some creepy, haunted mansion. Fuck, I wouldn't be surprised if the entire blueprint for the Castlevania games' VGM was based on the one riff in this song, though it also reminds me of Satori from another 70s group, Japan's Sabbath inspired Flower Travellin' Band. There's even some experimentation tucked into this piece, through the trills and wailing noises in the bridge.\n\nAnother monstrous number here is the opener \"Victim of Changes\", a song that likely needs no introduction to anyone who has been following the genre for any decent length of time. Massive, striking and unforgettable bluesy grooves drive the narrative of Halford's multi-pronged assault, and this is one of the points where they get really psychedelic in the bridge, with a simple guitar repeated over smooth, subtle bass and great vocals. \"Genocide\" has this incredibly, leaden and smoky barroom feel to the guitar lines in the verse, and the chugged guitar lines in \"Deceiver\" felt nice and relatively complex for their day. \"Tyrant\" also breaks balls with its heavy as fuck power chords, plunking bass and the nice contrast of the softer 'tyrant' in the chorus with the louder counter-lines. Halford also does a lot of self-harmonizing here (and through the rest of the record), which works astoundingly well, because really, the only thing better than having one Rob is two Robs. (I know what you're thinking, perverts. Stop it.)\n\nNot every song is a hit, but even where Sad Wings... does falter, it's not remotely frustrating or bad. I just felt that \"Epitaph\" might have been better served elsewhere. Halford sounds great with Glenn Tipton's pianos, as he does with almost anything, but it feels slightly too dramatic, and I like my Priest with the kick ass guitars and cloud piercing harpy vocals. \"Dreamer Deceiver\" is slightly better because the guy's voice is brilliant, but despite that and the strong bass lines of Ian Hill, I just felt I was waiting for some big, catchy riff that never happened. Another song I often teeter over is the finale \"Island of Domination\", but thankfully it's got this really interesting structure where the rhythm collapses down in the middle and that one, evil riff sequence around 2:00. You also get a taste for Halford's lower, swaggering 'soul' vocals here which feel to me like the guy could've cut a record for Motown.\n\nNot surprisingly, Priest had a new drummer here (their 5th), Alan Moore, replacing John Hinch, but I didn't notice a major difference in the playing of the two, only that the aggression of the music had been ramped up so it feels more structured and marginally less 'jammy'. As for the production, it's comparable to the debut if slightly more 'aged' when I listen to it today. You can still make out all the nuance, expression and instrumentation as clear as day, but there are a few points where the rhythm guitars feel more muddled than others. Ultimately, though, while this is perhaps not an absolute favorite of mine when rubbed up against certain other gems in the Brits' lexicon (Sin After Sin, Defenders of the Faith, Painkiller and a few others have always seemed somewhat more consistent for me), it's a damn fine record worth anyone's time and money, so any holdouts might want to pony up and set themselves and revoke their poseur licenses.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nIt's not every day that I review an album as old as I am. Sure, I've got a month on Rocka Rolla (the album, not the single), having emerged from the womb of my unknown mother (I like to think it's Satan) in August of '74, but I don't think that there's any question the Judas Priest debut has aged far better than I have. Not that I'm fighting back shocks of white plumage, mind you, but despite being one of my lesser loved albums in the British gods' pantheon, Rocka Rolla has such great production and vibrant songwriting that even today, some 38 years in the future, it still seems 'fresh' when I compare it to some of the most modern music coming out of the rock/hard rock field. That's not to say I'm giving this the most glaring of recommendations, as I find the track list somewhat inconsistent, but there have been far worse debuts to take for granted from longstanding, outstanding bands such as this one.\n\nI'm sure that arguments have been made to disqualify Rocka Rolla as a pure 'metal' record, just as they have for many thus labeled, but of course this is all coming from a retrofit perspective which is not necessarily valid. In a world with Cannibal Corpse, it would be difficult to claim an album like this was even remotely heavy, but for 1974, there were not a whole lot of options. You had Sabbath, Zeppelin, Deep Purple, Thin Lizzy a few lesser known groups who only today seem to get a nod and a welcome, and then the emergence of three more of the most influential 'hard rock' bands in all of history: Canadian progressive Rush, theatrical New Yorker man-whores KISS, and a bunch of Birmingham boys who had been kicking around since '69, bred on the hard blues of Cream and Hendrix and soon to shape the 'metal' sound in such a way that they would go on to influence so many in their wake that you might go less insane trying to count the stars on a clear night.\n\nRocka Rolla is iconic. The coke bottle cover image and admittedly lame old logo would be difficult to forget for any child of the 70s (or 80s), and this was the sole album to feature drummer John Hinch, who at that time was already the fourth to hold that position. The sound on a number of the cuts was much groovier in nature than what we've come to expect. Sabbath was the clear comparison, especially on songs like \"One for the Road\" where Halford's piercing pitch rubbed up against the bluesier based rhythm guitar not unlike. Or the conceptual trilogy of \"Winter\", \"Deep Freeze\" and \"Winter Retreat\", where huge mournful grooves explode out of a psychedelic din only to return to devolve into wailing experimentation and a smooth, clean closure. Zeppelin also plays heavily into the swaggering dirty blues metal of \"Cheater\", and there's a progressive and psychedelic Pink Floyd current flowing through the numbing \"Run of the Mill\" or solemn \"Dying to Meet You\" (before it explodes).\n\nBut, of course, none of those bands featured Rob Halford, who is all over this thing, showcasing the vast range and personality of his voice. He can brood sullenly against the bluesier undertow, he can scream off like a siren, and in general maintain an incredibly consistent higher pitch for just about as long as he needs. This is more than evident on my favorite tracks here: \"Rocka Rolla\" itself in which he measures off a lot of groovy swagger with a higher pitched counterpoint that cuts right across the throat like jagged glass, or the heavily atmospheric \"Never Satisfied\" where he's incredibly expressive across both the mid and upper registers, giving even a bark and bite once he arrives at the chorus before that giant Page-like bridge groove with the lead. \"One for the Road\" is another of the stronger pieces, with some nice percussion from Finch that really highlights the bluesy spit of the guitars and the more top heavy, resilient howls of Halford.\n\nWhile I don't think Tipton and Downing had quite come into their own here, still adapting the signature dual style they are so known for, both are pretty solid at emulating the grooves of their individual influences. A lot of Clapton in there, even more Hendrix, but it works very well against the impressive rhythm section. 40 year veteran Ian Hill has long been one of the less outspoken members of the band, and I've often heard or read the guy being criticized for his low key stage presence, but he really got a chance to shine here, his subtle strutting perfectly accommodating the bright and rich tone of the guitars. If there's any real problem with this record, it's only that in hindsight the songs are nowhere near as striking and effective as the heavier style they would evolve towards on later records. Not all of them are equally memorable, and if you took Rob out of the equation, Rocka Rolla might well have been any of several other bands in this period.\n\nStill, the production and performance ensures that, while it's never to be hailed as some great masterpiece of psychedelic heavy blues or proto-metal, Rocka Rolla has a timeless nature about it that should sate most people who find themselves in a mood for some of the harder 70s sound. Blues, progressive rock, hard rock, all can be found frothing in the spirit of these musicians, and there's a sense that this is one of the most 'honest' of their works. It's not the hi octane, fire breathing, S&M strapped Judas Priest we'd all come to recognize and worship, but a group of guys carving a sincere, dynamic and refreshing piece of the pie from their own forebears. It's not very consistent. There are few if any 'hits'. Nor is it as musically wealthy or important as other debuts like Iron Maiden, KISS, or Black Sabbath, yet it weathers the decades like a diamond, in whose facets one might glean the firestorms to follow.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nThe 70's was a time a major classics for then fresh band Judas Priest. They had the grand metal milestone \"Sad Wings of Destiny\" under their belts, and would soon the birth the fearsomely fast and dark \"Stained Class\" and the rambunctious, condensed \"Hell-Bent For Leather\". But in 1977, the band (under new label Columbia) put out this odd offering, the cooly-titled \"Sin After Sin\". To say this sucker is inconsistent would be an understatement, going back and forth between moody love ballads to bouncy mid-paced stompers to all-out brutal speeders. Fans oft consider it to be a bonafide classic, but I don't know.\n\nThere is a timeless feel to it, though still rooted in the 70's in a nostalgic manner. The performance of the bandmates are top-notch. Halford's voice is as golden as ever, his range across the boards from mournful hums on \"Last Rose of Summer\" to ear-piecing death shrieks on \"Dissident Aggressor\". Tipton and Downing lead on strong with a number of riff-happy leads; while I'm not huge on the album as a whole, it does feature some of the greatest solos of these guys, whom weren't quite yet fully at their dueling stages. Ian Hill's bass is quite solid and fairly audible in the mix. He has a few nifty fill moments and keeps an especially solid rhythm in numbers like \"Raw Deal\" or \"Sinner\". Then we have one-time Priest drummer Simon Phillips. Too bad he popped up just once, because the guy's one of this album's fucking highlights. His range is astounding, allowing for diverse speed and sound to the songs. His fills are vicious, his solos killer, his contributions unforgotten. \n\nThere's only eight songs on ere, amazingly adding up to forty minutes. The \"weaker\" moments, as they are, are the sappy slow ones. \"Last Rose of Summer\" is barely a Priest song in any guise, staying mellow and even boring in its near six minute run-time. \"Here Come The Tears\" is in a similar vein, but more condensed with a bit more attitude; Halford's vox and Hill's bass shine nicely here. \"Starbreaker\" fares a bit better with its bouncy, bluesy riffage but comes off a little unmemorable after the fact, as does the pedestrian and frankly kind of annoying cover Joan Baez's \"Diamonds And Rust\". \"Raw Deal\" is fairly solid; it has a raw (duh) guitars assault and cool vocals, but the middle solo goes on for a bit too long. This leaves us with three songs. Opener \"Sinner\" is absolutely cool, armed with a sharp, bouncy main riff, some of Halford's most diverse singing on the album, wicked drumming and a moody solo that offsets the rest of the song. \"Let us Prey/Call For The Priest\" is even better, somewhat eliminating the former song's bluesiness. It starts with a sort of Queen-like intro (Call For The Priest) and after a short, quiet buildup, we crash headfirst into the album's fastest, best track, coming quick with Phillip's best drumming and the best solo on the album, a truly spirited tour-de-force from Tipton and Downing. Closing things up is what was probably the heaviest song in the world at the time, \"Dissident Aggressor\". Odd sound effects give way to quiet but heavy guitar plinking and some cymbal taps, then one of Halford's highest screams ever; it's almost inhuman. Wash it down with brutal riffage and highly aggressive vocal shouting.\n\nOverall, I don't find it to be a true classic. While the band's performance is top fucking notch, the highly unusual inconstancy of the song selection is very off-putting, going from heavy as fuck to quiet and lightweight whenever it wants. There are some okay moments, and the last three songs I mentioned are fucking fantastic, but I find this one to be a little overblown. Don't listen to it expecting heavy metal band Judas Priest; expect a more \"I'm not quite sure where we're going with this\" Judas Priest, and hopefully maybe you'll like it more than me.\n",
        "\nThough it's not one of my favorite full-lengths in the Judas Priest backlog, and I found the songs marginally less hooky than its direct predecessor Turbo, there is something Ram It Down did VERY right. Essentially, it would steer Halford and company back on the path they had abandoned with their divisive '86 record, and seemed the perfect staging for what would follow, the band's almost entirely unexpected, more aggressive masterpiece Painkiller. This album certainly curries a lot of the elements that seem to point at a Priest who had awoken from an oblivious torpor, shucking aside a security blanket and realizing that they weren't getting any younger, but they could still get HARDER, and thus assimilate themselves against the evolving metal landscape without betraying the traditional sound that they were so critical in helping create in the first place.\n\nPerfect it is not, but heavy it most definitely fucking is, at least in comparison to the band's output up to its release. The guitars feel more pronounced and potent, the leads quavering, intense and more acrobatic than many others in their discography, and Rob's voice was becoming more dynamic and defined than even his youthful years. All the experimentation with the guitar synthesizers has been cast to the curb and they've gone for straight, ballsy songwriting with the huge vocal hooks that have immortalized them. Interestingly enough, they kept on long term producer Tom Allom here in conjunction with several of the band members, and though this is one of his last appearances in that role, he's managed to help get them back on track. For if I've got any complaints at all about Ram It Down, the actual studio sound is not among them, this is one of the finest 'sounding' albums the band have ever released to date, voluminous and balanced to a cutting perfection.\n\nWhere I don't strongly succumb to its charms is in the songwriting. Most of what you hear on this record was actually intended to be released with the Turbo material as a double disc which would mix and match the heavier and more glam/pop inspired material, but it eventually was decided that they'd separate the two aesthetics into their own entities. Ram It Down clearly still has a few of the hard rock songs present, like Zeppelin-groove heavy screamer \"Love Zone\" or the melodic cover of Chuck Berry's \"Johnny B. Goode\". \"I'm a Rocker\" would have fit in quite fluidly with Turbo since it has that same sort of percussive guitar rhythm beneath the chords, and the same might be said for the nearly 8 minute, escalating \"Blood Red Skies\" which adheres to the heavy use of synth from the '86 album, though effectively. \"Love You to Death\" wouldn't have been out of place for KISS or Jimmy Page. Strangely, though, while I liked the summery party aesthetics of Turbo, none of these particular tracks have ever really stood out to me...\n\nBut then, the rest of Ram It Down is really quite good. \"Come and Get It\" is one of those classic mid-paced hybrid hard rock/power anthems which would influence about a hundred German bands not the least of whom would be Primal Fear (or U.D.O.'s solo works). \"Heavy Metal\" opens with some flashy, frivolous leads before evolving into some of the best Halford screaming lines on the album, not to mention a chorus so dark and catchy that it compensates for just how goddamn obvious you knew it was going to be. \"Hard and Iron\" and \"Ram It Down\" itself both serve as the foreshadowing of Painkiller, what with the driving double bass in the former, the scathing and effective leads, the more aggressive sting on the vocal effects and the general sense of added majesty, anger complexity that the band would pursue on tunes like \"Leather Rebel\", \"Metal Meltdown\" and \"All Guns Blazing\". Had this album never existed and those tracks were bonus material on the 1990 effort, they'd fit in quite fluidly, even though the payoff of the chorus hooks is nowhere near that level.\n\n\"Monsters of Rock\" was another interesting piece, with a slow build to it that I would expect from a band like Manowar, and vocal elements that also match such a manly aesthetic. Even though the chorus (like a lot of \"Rock\"-titled tunes) is almost laughable, this song is perhaps the most individually distinct stylistically when compared to its neighbors, and I imagine Dave Holland must have had a lot of fun laying out those resonant, warlike drums which feel like you're in some alternate universe Sign of the Hammer. In general, though, this album is rather well balanced. You've got your non-ballad power-ballad epic, your mighty and crushing pieces, mid-gait fist smashers and rapid fire accelerations. It's not difficult to understand why so many fans breathed sighs of relief when it first arrived, having had negative reactions to Turbo. I think, pound for pound, that record had more songs I enjoy in the long term, but only because of the memorable chorus sequences.\n\nIn retrospect, 1988 was perhaps my favorite overall year in metal music, with an enormous amount of acts boiling over from the underground that took the genres of speed, thrash and power metal to new heights. Like its predecessor, Ram It Down could hardly compete with what else was happening. Albums like Riot's Thundersteel or Sanctuary's Refuge Denied walked all over what I heard on this record, and some of the exciting European speed/power records like Scanner's Hypertrace, Rage's Perfect Man and Running Wild's Port Royal remain among my favorite in all of music and examples of NWOBHM/power influences taken to a greater level of musicianship and bolder conceptual extremes. Operation: Mindcrime had vocal hooks that created orgasms in my eardrums. Even Iron Maiden's Seventh Son of a Seventh Son matured better than this record. But those comparisons aside, Ram It Down does not age poorly, and it's still fun to break out once in awhile. I mean, if you can't weight train to \"Monsters of Rock\", \"Come and Get It\" or \"Hard As Iron\", you are no hesher, in which case you should go listen to Adele or cuddle up to some butter-free microwavable popcorn and watch Dancing with the Stars. 'But I LIKE \"Rolling in the...\" SHUT UP.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nTurbo has always caught a bit of flack from a segment of metaldom due to its ridiculous levels of accessibility, but let's be honest about this: Judas Priest, bless their hearts (up to and including 1990) has never exactly but Public Enemy No. 1 in terms of the aggression they incorporate into their music. Nonsensical accusations of subliminal messaging aside, they've always had a knack for the huge, friendly chorus parts that thrust them into the spotlight alongside the rest of the popular hard rock/metal radio of the 70s and 80s, and while their music might have seemed edgy in '78, hits like \"Breaking the Law\" and \"You've Got Another Thing Comin'\" always held an appeal to a wide cross-sampling of society, from the rich to the poor to the young to the elderly to the black brown white yellow green purple or whatever other compartments we place ourselves in.\n\nSo it's not really hard to believe that Priest would follow up the success of such pieces with an album that is largely wrought of a more 'commercial' party rock aesthetic that might have been generally associated with but not limited to KISS and Twisted Sister. For me, Turbo has always been THAT album, that cutting loose of the more serious elements you'd heard on most of their prior efforts and a focus squarely on catchy rock tunes that could appeal to the average high schooler of its day (or middle schooler, in my case). Granted, 1986 was the year of such lauded monoliths as Master of Puppets, Somewhere in Time, Reign in Blood, Fatal Portrait and Awaken the Guardian, so it might not have been in Priest's best interests to pursue this course when such quality was emerging from the underground (or from their own British peers). When held up against any of those records, or many others, Turbo seems trite, silly and juvenile by comparison, but in of itself I think this is still a fun record for a road trip to summer camp, arms and legs flailing out of the bus or your parents' station wagon en route.\n\nIf I've got any complaints, they'd revolve more around the actual production of the record and the fact that, despite nearly every song having some catchy sequence somewhere in the vocal progressions (Judas Priest was not a band known for much 'filler' on their early albums), not all are equally memorable in the long term. This is perhaps the most 'synthetic' sounding of their full-lengths, with the guitar synthesizers sounding immensely cheesy dowsed in their post-prog relish (the intro to \"Out in the Cold\" being a prime example), but in general the guitar tone does not feel adequately vibrant or powerful to really carry its hooks into infinity. The songwriting is of course meticulous, with tracks like \"Turbo Lover\" perfect sequences in alternated verse-chorus pop bliss, and very little flair or flash to the guitars beyond their measured, muted verse riffing, emboldened power chord chorus escalations and the requisite leads, but in retrospect I think the sound Judas Priest and Tom Allom settled with here might have benefited from actual fucking balls, as opposed to the timid tones of a turtle half afraid to emerge from its shell.\n\nAs for the consistency of the cuts, I will say that it's hard to tell Turbo was extracted from the theoretical double LP that the band initially proposed (Twin Turbos). All of the tracks seem to flow smoothly, the first half loaded with memorable choruses like the instantly recognizable title track, the desperate and uplifting \"Locked In\", the beefy mid paced rocker \"Private Property\" with its clapping electronic percussive strikes and the youth anthem \"Parental Guidance\" which felt like a more constrained lyrical alternative to Twisted Sister's \"We're Not Gonna Take It\". As the album progresses, you get some moodier, slightly more serious pieces like \"Out in the Cold\" which might have been a passable Journey, Foreigner or Triumph track sans the slicing timbre of Rob Halford, or the ballsier \"Wild Nights, Hot & Crazy Days\" which is total cock rock that could just as well fallen under the banner of KISS, M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce or the Scorpions, but catchy nonetheless. Some of the later tracks, \"Hot for Love\" and \"Reckless\" don't exactly stand out to memory, but they're flush enough stylistically with their lead-ins.\n\nThe individual performances on Turbo are enthusiastic without hinging on the provocative. Rob clearly paves the way, his melodies the most impressive on the album, but Downing and Tipton throw in a few good, curving hooks while the rhythm duo of Holland and Hill keeps pace like a team of horse-drawn metronomes. The guitar synthesizes, which are careening and cavorting about the structure of the songs as if they were just testing the ice and afraid to go skating, can prove distracting in places, and the leads in tracks like \"Locked In\" and \"Rock You All Around the World\" are worthwhile if not their most memorable. But as usual, they practice enormous restraint in their performance, with no undue fills or excess wanking (aside from perhaps the over use of the synth atmospheres), letting Halford run the show, and for this reason the divisive reaction of some of the metal audience to Turbo, or Priest in general, is not unsubstantiated, even if I happen to disagree due to the typically great hooks the band tended towards.\n\nAfter Screaming for Vengeance and Defenders of the Faith, two of the better albums in their entire canon, Turbo did and still does feel like a mild disappointment, but only in the way that this was the first point at which they felt like they were not keeping current with what was happening elsewhere in the genre. The momentum seemed to grind to a halt, even if they were still able to elicit some fun from the songs. With thrash, speed and power metal exploding, death metal just on the horizon, Turbo feels like an evolutionary step backwards, and Judas Priest weren't really able to reinvent or reinvigorate themselves until the explosive, and unforgettable Painkiller which stood out even against a far heavier landscape of thrash. As far as its song selection, I do prefer this record to its successor Ram It Down, of which a few tunes were also drawn from the 'Twin Turbos' writing sessions, but when held up against their greater legacy, Turbo doesn't emerge a favorite. A sunny, melodic and lighted hearted romp that I'll break out seasonally, fun for the whole family (including the girlfriend, who will generally rock out to at least \"Turbo Lover\") but nothing exemplary is happening and it doesn't feel like a direction I'd want Priest to further explore.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nJudas Priest apparently wanted to get heir act back together after the infamous 1986 album, \"Turbo\". 1988's \"Ram It Down\" was almost as equally controversial, due to it infamously being made up of \"Turbo\" leftovers, semi-pandering \"WE ARE SOOOO METAL\" rockers, and more technological interruption, resulting in what is probably the oddest in the band's discography. It's inconsistent, often lame, sometimes heavy, with a feeling of Priest going through the motions and a dated, uber-80's sound to it. Yet, is \"Ram It Down\" that awful?\n\nWell, most of the band add a bit more power this round. Halford lets loose more of his traditional shrieks and wails this time around, sounding more aggressive (but also more rushed) than on \"Turbo\". Glenn and KK are yet again the stars here, their trade-off solos scorching, memorable, and again aggressive, though the still apparent use synth guitars gets a bit nerve-shredding. Then there's Ian Hill again. Competent, but unremarkable. He again manages to shine on quieter or heavier tracks like \"Blood Red Skies\" or \"Come And Get It\". Then there's Dave Holland...who's nowhere to be found. From what I understand, he was sick during much of the recording, though he did pound out a few numbers. He was replaced by a drum machine, a drum machine which I will not critique because it's a fucking drum machine. It makes the songs sound processed and synthetic...because its a fucking drum machine. Bad choice guys.\n\nLuckily, some of the songs are pretty damn solid. Everybody's gotta love the title track and \"Hard As Iron\", a pair of fearsome, adrenaline-pumping speed metallers with killer vocals and blazing guitar dueling. Not even the synthetic drumming can bring these rabid dogs down! A personal favorite of mine is the epic \"Blood Red Skies\". Corny? Yeah, maybe, but man is this song beautiful too, with its experimental intro, lavish vocals and an emotional main solo. Great, great stuff. Much of what I also find decent are also pretty fillerish, too. I have a soft spot for numbers like the mid-paced \"I'm A Rocker\" in spite of its corny lyrics, as well as the slightly heavier \"Come And Get It\" with its catchy main riff and stomping vocals. The REALLY cheesy \"Heavy Metal\" is kind of a fun listen as well, the heavy metal pandering just goes off the charts here. Avoidable numbers are \"LA LA Love Zone!\" Blech! Another bad one is \"Monsters of Rock\", one of the most boring, plodding Priest songs ever, and probably one of their worst album finales since the end of \"Defenders of the Faith\". \n\nOverall, this is one odd album. It's inconsistent, and reeks of unwanted technological inference, causing an unwanted dated feel. The bad songs downright suck, but some of the technical filler moments I think are actually kind of fun, while the trio of \"Ram It Down\", \"Hard As Iron, and \"Blood Red Skies\" help bring the album up to an at least semi-respectable level. A decent keeper for Priest purists, but not a good start for new fans. Think twice on this monster of rock.\n",
        "\nThere is a longstanding consensus that in the mid 80s, particularly in the year 1986, Judas Priest ceased to be a metal band and went the path of other earlier heavy metal mainstays like Grave Digger and Celtic Frost and jumped on the glam rock train. Now if there is one thing in the world that I truly hate it\u2019s a consensus, that decrepit destroyer of all things original and individualistic about the music we all know and love. Be this as it may, like with any other viewpoint, it lives or dies by its accuracy and not by how many people hold or refuse to hold it. \u201cTurbo\u201d is an album that isn\u2019t so much troubled, but rather tends to trouble a lot of people, but often for the wrong reasons.\n\nTo dispense with the two clich\u00e9s that often followed this band of either them starting to lose it after \u201cStained Class\u201d or that this album simply leaped out of the mid 80s due to pressures from the changes in the rock mainstream, there is a logical way to look at this album as the logical conclusion of a progression from mainline 70s hard rock with a few pioneering metallic elements to 80s mainline rock with a few left over metallic elements. The result is a sound that is signified a bit more by the over-processed, mechanical drum sound that was very popular in the 80s across the musical spectrum, and a barrage of synthesizer and guitar effects that are not associated with Priest\u2019s past efforts.\n\nBe this all as it may, when discounting the similarities this album shares with Bon Jovi\u2019s \u201cSlippery When Wet\u201d and Cinderella\u2019s \u201cNight Songs\u201d in a production sense, there is still enough distinctively Judas Priest about this album for it to be recognized as being one of their albums. The distorted guitar tone is still well within the paradigm established on \u201cDefenders Of The Faith\u201d; the riff work still has some bite to it that cuts through much of the keyboard malarkey. Sure, songs like \u201cParental Guidance\u201d and \u201cReckless\u201d are about as formulaic and clich\u00e9 as they come, but they aren\u2019t that terribly far removed from a lot of the fun that happened on Ozzy\u2019s \u201cThe Ultimate Sin\u201d, and if they cut the synth-like character of the drums, some of these songs could pass for Twisted Sister.\n\nOne of the factors that really make this a fun listen in spite of itself is the unavoidable catchiness of the whole thing. Granted, this holds true for a number of fairly sappy albums that were burning up the charts while the likes of even Metallica and Anthrax were considered fringe, but when hearing the upbeat rocking of \u201cLocked In\u201d and the unforgettable mix of punchy power chords and spacey keyboards that is \u201cTurbo Lover\u201d, I tend to hear the same good natured rock that won me over to 80s ZZ Top when I was a mere 6 year old lad with no real sense for music. Leave us forget that this was also a time when the mainstream rock scene didn\u2019t completely frown on musicality and both Tipton and Downing put on a riveting display of lead shredding that actually rivals most of their previous solos.\n\nSure, this is one of the weaker albums that bear the Judas Priest insignia, yet it somehow manages to keep me coming back despite my general all metal, the entire time attitude towards music of late. It could be chalked up to it just sounding worlds better than the shit the radio plays nowadays, or childhood nostalgia, but this just sounds fine to my ears though it is definitely among the shallowest and formulaic of albums to come out of the 80s. I can understand someone who was in his teens during the mid 80s and fighting the mainstream by spending their cash on the likes of \u201cReign In Blood\u201d or \u201cDarkness Descends\u201d hating this with a passion, I just don\u2019t.\n",
        "\nThe legend of Judas Priest\u2019s 80s era is something that is rarely disputed amongst any self-respecting metal head, with the exceptions of \u201cPoint Of Entry\u201d and \u201cTurbo\u201d which are both usually dismissed as mysterious stumbles amid a skyward path for the original bearers of the eagle\u2019s emblem. But as with anything else, legends are based upon a reality and the reality is that Judas Priest\u2019s material could be argued along the lines of their 70s contemporaries before the NWOBHM as rock music trailblazers who found themselves in the midst of a revolution and then decided to go along with it. When dealing with the so-called unquestionable slab of metallic perfection that is \u201cDefenders Of The Faith\u201d, there is a dissenting view that should be taken if one wants to throw any of the other 80s albums under the bus.\n\nWhenever dealing with the non-speed metal elements of this album, I always find myself hearing a revamped version of \u201cScreaming For Vengeance\u201d that is a good bit catchier, but at the same also a bit more shallow. While I\u2019m not one to knock a band for throwing out some tongue-in-cheek sexual lyrics to complement the science fiction and arena celebration material that normally goes with a Priest album, with a couple of exceptions this album is as much of a party album as \u201cPoint Of Entry\u201d from the lyrical angle. This is further bolstered by a guitar tone that is a bit more rocking and smooth than the crunchy, fuzzy edge that dominated the previous album, and also by a safer riff set that doesn\u2019t exploit the harmonic potential of their dual guitar set up the way classics like \u201cElectric Eye\u201d did and later came to push along the concept in the USPM realm.\n\nBy no means is anything found on this album bad nor lacking in energy, but there is a general sense of safeness within the rock box that is rarely abandoned for some really kickass metal. For all the blustering fury that this album begins to unleash with the undeniably astounding slab of speed that is \u201cFreewheel Burning\u201d, arguably one of the most intense songs the band put out before \u201cPainkiller\u201d, this album essentially blows its load too quickly (no pun intended) and a little more than halfway through just sort of falls asleep and goes into autopilot. This becomes apparent soon after \u201cEat Me Alive\u201d, which functions as a decent up tempo afterthought after the album\u2019s first break from annihilating the ears in the slower \u201cLove Bites\u201d. When \u201cSome Heads Are Gonna Roll\u201d comes into the picture, the beginnings of what became \u201cTurbo\u201d come into focus with a slow, stripped down rock groove that sounds closer to a glam radio hit out of Dokken or Motley Crue.\n\nThe only point where I actually find myself outright considering skipping a song is the subdued ballad \u201cNight Comes Down\u201d, which sounds dangerously close to sappy power ballad territory of the 9th degree. Granted this approach to writing a radio hit was not as horridly widespread as it would become later, but the overly predictable formula wears thin even for the pioneering versions of this format. The closing duo \u201cHeavy Duty\u201d and \u201cDefenders Of The Faith\u201d are essentially one song, and a rather plodding one at that. It functions as sort of a regression into AC/DC territory at a time when most bands with an eye looking forward, and it lacks the grit and attitude to give it the charm that Motorhead regularly brings to this sort of song.\n\nTo be fair, the majority of what is on this album is really solid, with a couple of songs such as the aforementioned \u201cFreewheel Burning\u201d and the near equally intricate and animated \u201cThe Sentinel\u201d being certified classics that all should hear and approve of. But while some may refer to this album as the leaner, meaner follow up to \u201cScreaming\u201d, I can\u2019t help but see it as the smaller and slightly weaker of two twin brothers who were separated at birth and developed slightly different personalities. This one is a bit faster and can run a good sprint, but its predecessor has staying power and can run a marathon with the best of them. This is an album that any fan of old school heavy metal should have, but a lot of the excessive praise that it tends to get is solely focused on the handful of songs where things are at the top of their game, and ultimately to the detriment of a clearer picture on the mixed nature of the whole. They did better than this before, and would do better still later on.\n",
        "\nFrom out of the ashes and looming shadow of \"Screaming For Vengeance\" comes \"Defenders of the Faith\", the evil twin brother of Judas Priest's most popular 80's accomplishment. Underrated and sometimes even totally overlooked, this sucker can more than hold its own against its fellow brethren. However, as with its counterpart, \"Defenders\" suffers from inconsistency, which makes this all the harder due to a number of songs being some the band's most AWESOME of the decade, if not ever.\n\nThe band takes their talented (well, mostly) musicianship from the previous album, and add a darker, more evil slant on things, all seen over again by a big Tom Allom production. Dave Holland still just trudges along with his boring, meandering drumming, but at least he has more of his fast, hard fills to show off now and again. Ian Hill has slightly more notable bass here, but sounds a bit too laid back in the final mix. Still he pounds it when possible, adding serious power to a few numbers. Glenn Tipton and KK Downing still whoop ass here with their solos and riffing, but come up with even better stuff here with the decision for added aggression. Of course, Rob Halford lets it loose here, sounding really mean on some tracks with near growls and his rough 'n' tumble mid-range vocals. The man throws in a number of classic screams as well, though not as operatic as those on \"Screaming For Vengeance\". \n\nThe album starts off like any good Priest album should: AWESOME. But this isn't just any song. Oh no, this is \"Freewheel Burning!!!!\" *Da-na-NAA-da-na-na-na-na* \"Freewheel Burning!!!\" *DA-NA-NA-NAA* Too fucking awesome, this one of Priest's finest openers. It has a sense of evil, aggression, lots of cool riffs, a vicious and memorable solo with slight but chilling tempo changes, and vicious Halford vocals, including his legendary spitfire shouting during the song's middle portion. A fucking killer start! A pretty killer followup is \"Jawbreaker\". While still dark and menacing, it lacks the speed and overall aggression of \"Freewheel\". Still, its stomping midpace and abundance of catchy riffage, as well as some neat melodic vox, make it one killer keeper. In third is the great, woefully underrated \"Rock Hard, Ride Free\". With a more hard-rock tinged sound, as the title suggests, this big and beautiful semi-ballad comes complete with a gorgeous, epic-sounding chorus and an aboslutley rockin' solo that runs over two minutes long with time changes and Downing-Tipton dueling a plenty. DO. NOT. SKIP! Up next is probably the main reason why I gave this album the high rating it has: THE FUCKING SENTINEL! Take the \"big\" feel of \"Rock Hard\" and give it the evil of \"Freewheel\", and here you have this masterpiece. Beware of Ian Hill's bass attack in the intro, Halford's wild shrieking, the nifty time changes, and that chorus, which at the end builds and builds until we get a glorious heavy metal explosion, ending in a slow fadeout. After that, \"Defenders\" sort of trips and falls on its face, but manages to get back up with relatively minor injuries. We get a triple shot of \"Love Bites\", \"Eat Me Alive\" and \"Some Heads Are Gonna Roll\". The 1st has more immense bass to it and a good atmosphere, but it lacks the glorious punch of the last 4 songs. The 2nd thumps along with some of that more \"Freewheel\"-sounding speed and aggression, but its repetitive nature and goofy lyrics (less subtle than those In \"Jawbreaker\" by far) hold it back from being really good. The 3rd stands out as the strongest; while still kinda repetitive, it comes with a thundering mid-pace mixed with more melodic riffage, giving it a sound that somehow makes it stand out. Unfortunately, the album falls to its face a second time, but now never recovers. \"Night Comes Down\" is an unholy boring ballad that stops the flow dead, followed by the lame and forgettable \"Heavy Duty\" which fades into the pointlessly short title track. What the fuck could have went wrong? \n\nOverall, this album, like its predecessor, is a mixed bag, only at greater points across the scale. It starts out absolutely awesome, and then gets progressively weaker after the first four songs. I highly recommend the first four, while the next three are just okay, but beware the lousy finale. Buy at your own risk, I guess. It could've been a good EP.\n",
        "\nPriest decided to go back to a more traditional heavy metal sound after the poorly-received, lame, rock-influenced \"Point Of Entry\". A few months in the studio produced \"Screaming For Vengeance\", the band's highest-selling album, as well as the creation of one of their most massive world tours. But is \"Screaming\" all it's cracked up to be? No, definitely not, but it's certainly not terrible either.\n\nThe 80's team is here and accounted for, serving under a particularly big and metallic Tom Allom production. Rob Halford does great vocal work here, letting loose his wide range of screams, wails, and some good and often melodic mid-range work. Ian Hill's bass is practically invisible here, but does shine when some songs get quieter. KK Downing and Glenn Tipton are the stars here, their trademark guitars dueling on full blaze, trading off catchy riffs and nasty licks. Dave Holland trudges along and keeps it steady with his drums, though to be fair, he does have some good, hard moments here and there like on \"Electric Eye\" or the title track.\n\nThe song set is like many other Priest albums; songs that are awesome, and songs that are okay, and some songs that suck. Numbers like \"Riding On The Wind\" wouldn't have been out of place on \"Point Of Entry\", though it's slight speed, metallic sound and catchy chorus save it from being too hard rockish. Closer \"Devil's Child\" is along a similar line; a catchy, simple chorus, but slightly more aggressive and that this song falls, sadly, more into the way of a filler. What of Priest's unfortunate greatest hit, \"You've Got Another Thing Coming\"? Well, I do like the heavy main riff, and the loud solo ain't bad, but the lyrics and buildup to the chorus kinda suck, and the lengthy fade-out gets on my nerves a bit. Totally overrated. But this album is worth your time for 3 1/2 songs. The instrumental \"Hellion\", rising like some great mechanical beast, bashes into \"Electric Eye\", an Orwellian sci-fi tale chronicling the invasion of privacy. Halford's voice is monotone, but in good way, sounding very robotic; Tipton leads a cool solo while Downing spits up some catchy throwaway riffs. \"Fever\", despite its corny lyrics, has a great sound and atmosphere; it's almost like nothing you've ever heard before. The gorgeous opening is almost hypnotic. Then there's the title track. Fucking A this bastard rules! It's so aggressive that it's probably the closest classic Priest ever did to thrash metal. There's a cool Downing-led solo, a memorable chorus and easily Halford's most vicious vocals on the album, not to mention some surprisingly decent drumming from Holland.\n\nOverall, it's 3 1/2 great songs, 3 okay songs, and some filler. \"Screaming For Vengeance\" is a good start for Judas Priest newbies, and while it's not a bad album at all, it's not nearly as good as many make it out to be. Worthwhile for the 3 1/2 great tracks though.\n",
        "\nLadies and gents we're back to my favorite band in the world, JUDAS MOTHERFUCKING PRIEST! The album today...\"Turbo\"? Uh-oh. 1986's \"Turbo\" was an album that marked a change for Priest. They began to experiment with a more commercial sound, adding synthesizer guitars, synth pulses and even those awful drum machines to the formula. The result was an album that till this very day still continues to violently divide metal fandom right down the bloody middle. \n\nAdmittedly, the performance of the band is a bit more lackluster this time around. The usual aggression, wailing and punch of Halford's voice is scaled back here; he now sings a good chunk of the album with a slightly bored-sounding mid-ranged hum. It works well for some of the more atmospheric numbers, but what the Metal God was thinking and feeling during the recording sessions is anyone's guess. Downing and Tipton on their guitars are the brightest spots here, riffing it up big time and trading off their solos with more gusto than album offers overall. Ian Hill is nothing special here; he just sort of drones along himself, although he does spout a few okay riffs or fills occasionally. Dave Holland rounds it out (unevenly mind you) on the drums. I have a personal vendetta against this guy, as I solely blame him for a majority of Priest's lack of sonic speed and technicality during the 80's. His drumming is so boring, so pedestrian, that Halford, Tipton and Downing had to write WHOLE albums down to painfully simplistic levels so his lame \"tap tap taps\" could keep up with the wholly superior musicianship of his fellow cohorts. Why they kept this guy through the whole damn decade is beyond me, but I guess what it is what it is. \n\nThere are two kinds of songs of this album: basically, ones that suck, and ones that don't. Major suckage: \"We don't need no...NO NO NO Parental Guidance yeah.\" Ugh. Aside from that SLIGHTLY groovable chorus, this is one lame, pandering little number that should be forgotten at all costs. Shoot on sight! This is immediately followed by \"Rock You All Around The World\". The chorus is slightly better, as is the surprisingly scorching solo, but the lame, kitschy lyrics kill it dead. Up next is that album \"epic\", \"Out In The Cold\" with it's aggravating overabundance of synthesizers and slow, plodding nature. Skippable! Then there's worst song on here, \"Wild Nights, Hot and Crazy Days\". This is fucking garbage; it's totally lame Poison worship from the back to the front. Hazardous to your health! \n\nHigher Points: \"Turbo Lover\", the album's quasi- title track, has rich atmosphere, a damn fine solo with goof Downing-Tipton trade-offs, and a slow, spine-tingling build-up to the chorus. The more uptempo \"Locked In\", despite its corny lyrics, is catchy, fun and has probably my favorite solo on the album, short as it may be. The heavy, slightly sinister (sounding) \"Private Property\" is now up. More silly lyrics, yes, put it's offput by the heaviness, a loud Tipton-led solo, and a great rhythm to the song. A personal favorite is \"Hot For Love\", with it's dark, sleazy atmosphere, hard drumming and some of Halford's meaner vox on the album. The fantastic \"Reckless\" ends it all. This a cool, high energy song with a killer upbeat chorus, damn good melody and lyrics, I must admit, I fucking love. And if you're lucky to have the Columbia remaster, you'll also get the great \"All Fired Up\" a speed metaller in the fearsome but upbeat vein of \"Reckless\", only faster. \n\nOverall, this album does have some serious problems. About four of the songs are pretty bad, some so much so that I'm sure it'll ruin the experience for a few of you. But fear not, the good songs are indeed stronger. If you can get past the bad numbers and sense of commercialization, then you'll be rewarded with a metal nugget of fun.\n",
        "\nJudas Priest had their rock music discography (1974-1981) when they played classic/hard rock, then they turned into heavy metal music (1982-1984) when they played classic heavy metal. Then comes pop music break with Turbo, and again they go back with heavy metal (1988-onward) where they did classic heavy metal releases, power metal release (this one) and symphonic metal (Nostradamus). Too many genres and sub-genres. This studio album deserves respect, but not too much, 'cause things are not always how we imagine. This was one of the most influential albums which had special impact on power metal bands. In fact, this is Judas Priest's power metal release. However, it's one of the most overrated albums ever. I mean, not excellent one, and definitely far from being perfect. This studio album is very good, but I can name tens of other albums where you can find every song which is excellent. It's not the case here. This is the only interesting and the most creative Judas Priest album, where you can find more excellent songs than in 2-3 albums together from the rest of their discography.\n\nI give a limited respect to this release because it is so well-known, but the facts about its sound and idea are not well-known. This is known as one of the wonders of heavy metal music, one of the most original, unique studio albums and shit like that. But really, is it so? The answer is simple - no. This album is a pure rip-off, its sound, the whole image and idea. Distortion is improved, and doesn't sound like the stuff they did before. It sounds like Sanctuary's Refuge Denied. Sanctuary is underground band, but their studio album was known back then, and was accepted well. I bet they got it in their hands, and decided to sound like Sanctuary. Maybe I'm wrong, but no-one can deny the identical sound. Another reason why this release is not unique, because they stole the whole idea from Riot's Thundersteel. Just like Thundersteel, Painkiller is some kind of powerful fictive messiah who comes from the sky, rides horse of steel/metal monster, and slaughters evil, etc. Not just that they stole lyrical image, but both songs have fast drum work in the beginning with sharp riffs, although Painkiller's drum intro is more creative, high-pitched screams, fast tempo, technically demanding solos etc. Basically everything, just this studio album has better production.\n\nSo, whole work from album Painkiller, was inspired by work on Thundersteel. Thunder-steel, Pain-killer. Hm, kinda has the same feel. I did not come just to compare these three albums (Thundersteel, Refuge Denied and Painkiller), so I'll stick to the Painkiller now. I'm not hate-boy who came to piss on Judas Priest's work. I just state the facts. From these excellent songs which this studio album has to offer, Painkiller is the absolute highlight. A furious and powerful opener, which will catch every listener's attention after the very first listen. High-pitched singing parts and screams, blazing riffs, killer drum work, fast tempo, very good technical guitar solo, everything is perfectly packed. It really made impact on Kai Hansen who used this song as inspiration for some songs in Gamma Ray, and specially Ralf Scheepers, who made his entire discography with Primal Fear, influenced with this song. But both Kai and Ralf are god-like singers, and Rob can't match with them. Face it fanboys, Rob sucks live. He was never capable of singing this song live, and he rarely pulls some higher notes from other songs where he screamed. When he attempts to sing this song, he sounds like a baby crying, even worse.\n\nMetal Meltdown is another excellent song done with the same pattern. The only difference is that Metal Meltdown has insane guitar solo in the beginning, and the rest, well... again lyrics without deeper meaning, blazing riffs, fast tempo, high-pitched screams and again very good technical guitar solo. Between The Hammer And Anvil is rare song which has lyrics with deeper meaning. If I'm right, it's probably about Judas Priest, when they were accused for having hidden messages in their songs, when two fans of theirs committed suicide. It is slower song comparing to these two above, but still it has faster tempo, heavy riffs, enjoyable rhythm, tempo etc. One Shot At Glory is another heavy riff-driven song, with Rob's higher register, Manowar inspired lyrics. I can feel Manowar influence in this whole release, specially influence from the aggressive, furious, and powerful song Black Wind, Fire And Steel. A Touch Of Evil is much different song than the ones I mentioned above. Mainly because it is powerful ballad-like slow, lustful song ('cause of lyrics of course, yeah, second song with meaningful lyrics).\n\nThe rest of the album is not impressive at all. Leather Rebel's intro sounds like Helloween's Victim Of Fate, which is another rip-off part of this album. It has mediocre lyrics, great riffs and drum rhythms, fast tempo, but fast doesn't mean excellent. Hell Patrol is mid tempo song which has enjoyable drum and guitar rhythms, nice singing parts, but guitar solo is not special at all, lyrics are crap and Rob's screams are annoying here. All Guns Blazing has annoying opener screams. It has similar guitar solo to Painkiller, tempo which is the same like in Painkiller and Metal Meltdown, in fact, it was done with the same pattern like Painkiller and Metal Meltdown, but not as half as good as these two songs. Mostly because of shit lyrics again, and making so many similar songs in one album is not impressive at all. Night Crawler has some catchy rhythms, but that's all.\n\nGood sides of this release:\nSome excellent furious, aggressive, melodic songs with blazing riffs, fast tempo, great high-pitched screams, also great slower songs.\n\nBad sides of this release:\nFairly overrated, mostly crap lyrics, some boring songs, and songs with less creative effort, whole thing is a big Riot's Thundersteel and Sanctuary's Refuge Denied rip-off. It's not the most unique, original or whatever studio album. However, it had influence on other bands.\n\nHighlights:\nPainkiller, Metal Meltdown, Between The Hammer And Anvil, A Touch Of Evil and One Shot At Glory.\n",
        "\nAh, the almighty Judas Priest. can they do any wrong? Well, besides Turbo. And Demolition. And Point of Entry. That concept album was pretty iffy, too, but the least offensive of Priest's missteps in their career has to be \"Ram It Down.\" It's really all-around not a bad album, but it's among the most filler-heavy in JP's discography. Yeah, there's rip-roaring solos everywhere you go and Rob Halford does plenty of his signature wailing, but the lyrics... good God, the lyrics are pretty abominable, akin to the worst of Manowar's \"metal-as-fuck\" material like \"Metal Warriors.\" Anybody who knows Judas Priest knows that they rock; they don't need songs describing how \"metal\" they are. They're the Metal Gods, for Chrissake! Ironically enough, most of the songs on here are among the LEAST metal in JP's discography. \"Love Zone,\" for example, reeks of glam metal overtones, almost more so than anything on \"Turbo.\" That Motley Crue-esque catchy-but-simplistic guitar riff, that drum machine churning out an equally simplistic beat...it just sounds really dated. It's been said that Turbo and Ram It Down were originally going to be a double album. Admittedly, a lot of the material on here wouldn't sound out of place coupled with \"Turbo.\" \n\nLuckily, there are some saving graces here, like the opening titular track. It's still cheesy as hell, but dammit if it isn't enjoyable. \"Hard As Iron\" is also a pretty fast cooker. Nowhere near the best JP has ever done, but more enjoyable than a lot of the other schlock on this album. The following track, \"Blood Red Skies\", is an 8-minute epic. It still sounds totally '80s, but a good part of the '80s where music videos that took place in dark alleyways that had fog machines made sense and were socially acceptable. The cover of \"Johnny B. Goode\", while completely unnecessary, is still mildly entertaining but a bit overlong considering the original song is only like 2 and a half minutes. This cover is FOUR MINUTES AND FORTY SECONDS! I understand they wanna throw in a few extra solos, but an extra two minutes worth? Isn't that a bit overkill? \n\nThe title \"Monster of Rock\" would make you believe that it's just another song about how much Judas Priest rocks, but they threw a curve ball at us! It's a song about a monster made of physical rock, which arguably sounds just as stupid, but it's really not a bad mid-paced tune. Rob Halford gives a menacing performance, but the lyrics are still pretty bad. \n\nOther than the aforementioned songs, most of the songs on this album have the same problem - for how much JP talk about how much they rock on this album, the material presented doesn't rock too hard, especially compared to some of their earlier works. There are no \"Bloodstones,\" no \"Sinners,\" no \"Tyrants,\" no \"Freewheel Burnings,\" not even a goddamn \"Living After Midnight.\" Just several mediocre hard/glam rock tracks coupled with some signature Priest solos. It's far from the worst they've released, but also far from the best. Only hardcore Priest fans need apply.\n",
        "\nObviously, there is no need to introduce the band, but it is worth to bring nearer this diamond among other Judas Priest albums. In my opinion, this release shows the greatness and quintessence of all Priest's stuff. Being such a good album, it is also one of their most underrated work at the same time. Maybe underrated isn\u2019t the right word, but for sure it\u2019s some of their less well-known vinyl. Originally planned to be released with Turbo as a twin album, it was finally published two years later as Ram It Down. It\u2019s quite interesting that all the songs from Ram it Down were recorded during the Turbo sessions. Between those albums is a deep gulf as they are completely different. Fortunately, they were separated and released singly . The next thing is that after releasing Turbo, the band moved to a more commercial sound. They needed an album that would help them go back to the top and repair their image. The gods came to fight for domination and the hearts of their fans. They have dominated mine. \n\nThis disc contains a few of my all time favorite Judas Priest songs such as I\u2019m a Rocker, Hard as Iron, Monsters Of Rock, and Come and Get It. Each of them are powerful and fast, especially Hard as Iron (which probably is the best song here, by the way), although here we can find slower ballads such as Blood Red Skies. The reason that I was so bewitched by this is the second song, Heavy Metal. The intro solo belongs to my favorites as well as I believe it is the best solo in the genre. Recorded with the classic line-up, this material is high quality and contains 10 solid songs, all worthy representatives of Priest's creativeness.\n\nLet\u2019s move on further. Ram it Down has become a classic speed metal song, straight forward metal from 0:00 to the end. The next song perfectly captures the content of Heavy Metal when your head will survive after the gorgeous and ridiculously-fast intro; you will know why Judas Priests members are called metal gods. Then the tempo slows down in Love Zone, allowing a rest before the next giant song, Come and Get It, a song where Tipton and Downing spin up to fall with a flourish into Hard as Iron, the fastest and the best song on Ram it Down. After this anthem, the tempo slows to introduces a pair of slower, but very interesting ballads such as I\u2019m a Rocker or Monsters of Rock.\n\nFinishing, I would like to mention that this album is way better for me than Painkiller. My final remark is that this masterpiece will always be in the shade of other Priest albums and the content is inversely proportional to popularity. If you want to hear essential Judas Priest, get it right now!\n",
        "\nJudas Priest \u2013 Turbo \u2013 1986\n\nHere is a little lesson in music history:\n\n1986 was the year that everyone began experimenting with synths and drum machines. Bands like Halloween from Detroit and even Iron Maiden began to dabble into the mainstream with these keys to disaster, although Halloween and Maiden pulled it off without compromising their roots. It was metal mixed with the typical mid-1980\u2019s sound. They moved with the times and mixed the elements. Priest, on the other hand, went all out commercial in 1985 with the start of the Turbo record. This was no dabbling into commercialism, this was like a fat kid doing a cannon ball into the shallow end of the pool. Not a very pretty scene, is it now? Turbo is not entirely awful. In fact, it has some pretty worthy cuts, but back in '86, it looked as if Priest was riding the murky wave of commercialism. \n\n\nThe album kicks off with a track that I hate with a burning passion, the annoying \u201cTurbo Lover\u201d. The song is devoid of any life that Priest once had. This is more of a drum machine driven, synth- laden, radio friendly tune that gets on my nerves due to the overuse of the song by my local station. It is not a bad song in moderation, but everyday gets a little tough for a diehard Judas Priest fan like me. The next song is also very 1986-ish, but the tempo is kicked up a notch, and that is where it stays for most of the album. The album is virtually devoid of any traditional Priest numbers that hark back to the days of Stained Class. The only one that seems right on the album is the 6 and a half minute \u201cOut In The Cold\u201d. With that, the number is still laced with sappy synthesizers that tend to get a bit obnoxious at times. Processed guitar synths are another thing that is rampant on this record. Go and listen to the beginning of \u201cLocked In\u201d; that is what I am talking about here. There is no real guitar sound on the album, and if there is the lucky chance, it is only about a few seconds long. The only song devoid of these is my personal favorite, \u201cReckless\u201d, the album\u2019s closing track. This has to be the track that makes everything worthwhile on this relatively boring glam metal platter. The only reason this gets a rating above 70% is because of effort. This album really show the effort Priest showed. There is a good amount of great guitar work, but is obscured by the guitar synthesizers. The vocals are in top notch form here. They are loud and proud as always in the delivery from the metal god himself, Mr. Rob Halford. I have two copies of this record, one on the original Columbia pressing (CD) and the remastered CD version that features the amazing outtake \u201cAll Fired Up\u201d, which is a great road rage song (from personal experience) and a worthless, dime-a-dozen live version of Locked In that sounds almost identical to the studio version, guitar synths and everything. \n\nThe lesson here, kiddies, is don\u2019t sell out. Not everyone will like it. It is a lucky thing that I liked it a lot. It is a rare occasion. I have not met one other person that likes this album who also has a mind for early Priest. Don\u2019t give into the big labels that makes you look like suckers for the money. Will I ever place this above Stained Class or Sad Wings Of Destiny? No way, I never will! But it is a good listen every once in a while. K.G\n",
        "\nBy 1982, heavy metal\u2019s spearheads Judas Priest were dangerously heading towards \u2018sell-out\u2019 road with British Steel and Point of Entry. It was clear to the band that they either had to keep up with the legions of NWOBHM bands that they had helped influence, or deliver another British Steel that would guarantee them even more commercial success. However, Halford and the boys seemed to have asked themselves, \u201cfuck it, why can\u2019t we just please everyone?\u201d, and 1982\u2019s 'Screaming For Vengeance' was the answer to that question, being the perfect storm between commercial success and classic heavy metal. The band\u2019s well-received return to their heavy metal roots spurned even greater success and was arguably the pinnacle of their popularity. \n\nIf there\u2019s anything Priest had a knack for, it\u2019s creating albums filled with songs that each have their own charm and individuality, and this album is a testimony of that. From the AC/DC-tinged \u2018Devil\u2019s Child\u2019 to the blistering title track, it is clear that each song is noticeably different from each other. There are still the \u2018poppy\u2019 hooks to attract casual listeners, but songs such as the classic \u2018Electric Eye\u2019 and \u2018Riding On The Wind\u2019 pack enough of a punch to satisfy the average heavy metal fan. Halford, as usual, remains in top form, transitioning effortlessly from his mid-register to his trademark screeching falsetto and never comes off as overbearing. Downing and Tipton continue to breathe life into the songs with crunching riffs and memorable guitar duels, and while the solos aren\u2019t exceptionally great, they\u2019re a welcome change from those present in the previous 2 albums. Ian Hill is well, Ian Hill, and Dave Holland puts up a more inspired performance which, while allowing the guitarists to do their thing, isn\u2019t much to write home either. Rest assured, he still gets the job done.\n\nThe album gets off to a roaring start with \u2018The Hellion\u2019 reveling in all of its unabashed \u2018epic-ness\u2019, that transitions into \u2018Electric Eye\u2019, which, in my opinion, is the best Priest song from the '80s. You\u2019d be hard pressed to find a major fault with this song as it thankfully doesn\u2019t fall victim to the dreaded '80s cheese factor usually expected from the band. Riding On The Wind and the highly underrated \u2018Bloodstone\u2019 do an excellent job of keeping the listener engaged and are both catchy and generally fun tracks to listen to. Another great thing about this album is the track order, as one never seems to get burned out with the slower numbers \u2018(Take These) Chains\u2019 and 'Pain and Pleasure' to 'calm' the listener down before preparing them for the hellacious title track. Make no mistakes, this songs has BALLS, and big ones might I add. From the memorable opening scream, Priest launches a heavy metal attack on the listener\u2019s eardrums with Halford spitting out lines in his powerful falsetto while Tipton and Downing deliver some great riffs and a swank guitar duel, topped off with a hair-raising wail Rob hits towards the end of the song. This would have been my pick for the album closer, simply because it kicks so much ass, but 'Devil's Child' works as a serviceable album closer. And screw the haters, because \u2018You\u2019ve Got Another Thing Comin\u2019 rocks. Yeah, it\u2019s simplistic, but it drives the message home and is infectiously catchy, serving as a far better anthem than \u2018Take on the World\u2019 (seriously, fuck that song). Sadly, there is the usual filler with the incredibly bland \u2018Pain and Pleasure\u2019 and the somewhat weak ballad \u2018Fever\u2019. These aren\u2019t exactly bad songs, but fail to live up to the standard of the other tracks and detract from the album\u2019s quality just a bit. \n\nThe best summary I\u2019ve heard for this album is that \"when it\u2019s hot, it\u2019s HOT. And when it\u2019s not, it\u2019s not\", and that summary is absolutely correct. But that\u2019s not to say that this album is bad, because it\u2019s really not. There\u2019s a little something for everyone, and it\u2019s fair to say that \u2018Screaming For Vengeance\u2019 is one of Priest\u2019s greatest accomplishments as they successfully created an album that stays true to metal, yet contains enough hooks to ensure commercial success and remains the epitome of '80s Judas Priest. Sadly, the band would never enjoy the same levels of popularity again, which eventually led to the teeny-bop crap they put out in 1986 and 1988, in a desperate attempt to reach the masses, but that\u2019s for another review. Enjoy a landmark heavy metal album and one of Judas Priest\u2019s most popular ones.\n\n\nStandout Tracks:\nThe Hellion/Electric Eye\nRiding On The Wind\nScreaming For Vengeance\nYou\u2019ve Got Another Thing Comin\u2019\n",
        "\nI felt that I needed to leave a review for this album because it is probably my favorite Judas Priest album. Although some of the lyrics in the song in this album can be a bit cheesy, it is still great due to the fact that Rob Halford is singing them.\n\nTo start out, the title track, \"Painkiller\", starts out and just instantly crushes you. The drum solo at the beginning is just spectacular. Even the first guitar solo is amazing. This whole song just crushes you for the whole 6 minutes and is easily the best song on the album. I was once watching \"That Metal Show\" and Rob Halford was a guest on it and the audience was asking him questions and one of them was asked what is the greatest song ever. Rob Halford replied that the greatest song ever was \"Painkiller\", and I must say that I will agree with him. This is just a kick ass song.\n\nThe next songs, \"Hell Patrol\" and \"All Guns Blazing\", are also awesome. The guitar parts and drumming in it are just great. I also personally feel that the chorus of these songs rock. When the high scream comes up in the song \"Hell Patrol\", it is probably my favorite part of the song. The song that comes after that, \"Leather Rebel\", is another fantastic song. The opening guitar riff (fast and heavy) is what instantly tells you that it will be a great song. Even the chorus of this song is just like classic Priest, having the high pitch scream in the background and it is just awesome.\n\n\"Metal Meltdown\" is what comes next and the opening guitar solo in that song is remarkable and even when that ends and the rest of the song starts, it is fast and awesome. The song \"Night Crawler\" is also amazing. It opens up with kind of an eerie sound to it which is what to me adds some of the greatness to it. The style of how Halford does the vocals is just amazing and with his voice right beside that is a key to making this song awesome.\n\nTo sum it all up, this is maybe the greatest metal album of all time and I would recommend any metal head to listen to it. The intensity and the speed throughout the whole album is just fantastic and is why i love it so much. You are just amazed with the whole 46 minutes that it plays and you will not be able to resist to head bang or at least move your head a little bit when listening to this.\n\nI can do this for all of the songs on this album. I think that all of them are really good. I have heard some people say that this isn't a good Judas Priest album. Sure it isn't like other Judas Priest albums but that doesn't mean that it is bad. I just can't fathom why people would think that this album isn't as good as the other Judas Priest albums. I must say that this is probably my favorite Judas Priest album along with \"Screaming For Vengeance.\"\n",
        "\nFor a quick summary if you can\u2019t be bothered to read my long review scroll down:\n\nAfter what could be considered a \u201csafe\u201d comeback to lead vocals of Rob Halford with Angel of Retribution Judas Priest decided they need to do something more creative with their 16th LP release Nostradamus and by creative I mean they have ventured into Symphonic metal. This time round Judas Priest attempt to do a concept album based upon the life and visions of the famous French seer and I have to say I think it is a great success.\n\nThe album\u2019s production is fantastic, everything is clear and precise. Every lyric is audible and every instrument is perfectly placed. Individual performances are as good as any this band has ever recorded. Rob may not be the youngest boy on the block but he still has a hell of a voice on him and one that is still better than most on the scene. He shows a great range from the almost operatic intro to the title track, to the soft and gentle ballad Lost Love and the straight ahead metal approach of Prophecy. Glenn Tipton and K.K Downing are as good here as anytime in their career, the riffs are powerful and varied and some of the bands greatest ever solos are present on what could yet be Priests last ever album. Scott Travis and Ian Hill are both consistent and powerful on drums and Bass and the former has some great fills over the course of the album. A special mention has to be given to Don Airey who provides the keyboards here too, very well done. Overall production wise Judas Priest has created an album that focuses as much on the music as it does on Rob\u2019s powerful voice, never sacrificing one for the other and always finding the balance between the two.\n\nThe atmosphere throughout the album changes constantly and never are you in one frame of mind for too long, this is helped a lot in my opinion by the various interludes spread throughout the album which help break the pace down to something which helps balance everything.\n\nInterludes:\nDawn of Creation, Solitude, Awakening, The Four Horsemen, Sands of Time, Peace, Shadows in the Flame, Hope, Calm Before the Storm.\n\nThese tracks are not full songs by themselves but lead seamlessly into the next track and may as well be as a whole the next song because they work perfectly and are in no way out of place. They are all soft pieces and all lead into something heavier but it works. The first two tracks listed are the respective intro\u2019s to each disc as Nostradamus is split over two disc and both are amazing ambient songs that with no more than a little piano and a few strings build the atmosphere to a point where you know things are about to explode.\n\nThere are various moments throughout the album where you hear some great orchestration, the sort of thing you would hear in a movie soundtrack. This can be shown to very clear effect in the song War which has a beautiful build up half way through the song and is something not to dissimilar to what you would expect from Hans Zimmer. The song Death has an almost Epic Doom metal sound to it and contains some great Doom styled riffs and one of the albums great guitar solos. The albums obligatory ballads are Lost Love and New Beginnings both of which are very nice, the former especially has a beautiful guitar solo, even if it is a bit short. The song Plague and Pestilence is one of the best songs here and contains some lyrics in Latin but more importantly one of Priests best solos ever. The atmosphere throughout the song is hopeful despite the opposite being described lyrically. The weakest song here is Visions and it also happens to be the most commercial sounding on the LP. Nostradamus has an epic blood pumping orchestral intro which leads into possibly the best vocals of the album which are almost operatic up until what is the best scream Rob does the entire album. The final track The Future of Mankind another amazing track containing everything you would expect from a great Priest song, powerful vocals and an amazing dual guitar solo from Downing and Tipton. Tracks like Exiled and Alone are also very strong the former expressing a lot of emotion lyrically and the former sounding almost rebellious. \n\nIn my opinion this is Judas Priest greatest ever album, better than Painkiller or British Steel purely because of the variation they show here. They have shown they are not afraid to try something new and not allowing themselves to be the stereotype band that many people think Judas Priest of. Everything here is perfect, the vocals, guitar riffs, the solos, the atmosphere, the orchestration, the lyrics are very good, the production\u2026 hell even the booklet is beautiful to look at. This is in my view Judas Priests best album, their magnum opus. Does this mean all Priest fans will like it? No\u2026. but there are many people out there who will appreciate this album for what it is and I hope to one day see this album played in it's entirety\n\nA quick summary for those that can\u2019t be bothered to read a wall of text\n\nPros:\n- Lyrics and vocals are brilliant\n- Some of the greatest guitar solos Priest have ever done\n- Production is perfect\n- Interludes between songs create a great atmosphere and keep the pace of the album varied\n\nCons:\n- As good as the solos are I wish there were more of them\n- Priest used some symphonic elements during this album; I would have liked to see them be a bit more forward with it. I hope next time they use a real full orchestra, choir and really give it the beans\n- Only 102 minutes of music, I want more god dammit \n\nMy choice tracks\n- Plague and Pestilence (Amazing solo)\n- Nostradamus\n- War\n- The Future of Mankind (Amazing solo)\n\nGod I love this album, I hope Priest continue this path and create a even more bombastic and grandiose symphoic album next time, rather than revert back to thier more traditional style... as good as it was I want something new and fresh.\n",
        "\nAfter the success of Living After Midnight and Breaking the Law singles from British Steel, Priest went for an album in a similarly radio-friendly style, taking those two songs as their inspiration. And, to give full credit to them, some of the songs on here are pretty good - Heading Out to the Highway and Hot Rockin', in particular, are decent up-tempo pop-metal pieces which wouldn't have seemed out of place on the previous album or as B-sides to the preceding singles.\n\nHowever, that's not to say the album doesn't have issues. Fact is, the third single - Don't Go - is a plodding clunker, a stab at precisely the sort of classic rock delivery the band had otherwise left behind after Rocka Rolla. A similarly retrogressive approach can be heard on Turning Circles, Desert Plains - and, for that matter, most of the rest of the album. This is a disappointment considering that even on the commercially-leaning Killing Machine and British Steel the band had still managed to forge ahead and continue to expand the boundaries of metal, whereas this time around they seem happy to simply retread old ground and mimic more typical classic rock styles.\n\nThis difference is probably why this album gets a bad rap from Judas Priest fans, because going from British Steel to this is admittedly a bit of a shock, but I wouldn't say it's the absolute failure that it's often painted as. The fact is that even though it's a classic rock-influenced pop-metal album, it's a classic rock-influenced pop-metal album performed by Judas Priest, and even though they were giving their creativity a rest this time around, the musicianship on display is still second to none - and Heading Out to the Highway is a catchy song. But even though I would say that Point of Entry is a notch better than Rocka Rolla, I'd still rather listen to any of the albums between them rather than this one or the debut.\n",
        "\nWhat a surprise! Seven years after the very well received band classic \"Painkiller\", the band parted ways and seemed to be buried for all times. But at a certain moment, the remaining members of Judas Priest reanimated the band without their charismatic front singer Rob Halford and chose the young American Tim \"Ripper\" Owens who was playing Judas Priest cover songs in his early years. Everybody would have expected a poor attempt to earn some money and copy the style of the band's greatest successes. \n\nBut this album came as a surprise that went straight and without any compromises in the face of many fans. At least the record is accepted and got some positive reconsideration by most of the critics but at the time of its release, this album was a shock. Judas Priest doesn\u2019t play hard rock or heavy metal on this record. They play straight thrash metal with some death metal elements plus industrial sound effects and discordant disharmonic guitar solos that remind a lot of Voivod on this dark album. The main topic is about the dark side of life, death and sinner and finally the end of the world. \n\nMany people will now judge quickly and say that the band tried to catch up the trend train and win some fans among the younger generation that rather listened to thrash and death metal during the nineties when many heavy metal bands quit or had difficult times and when metal music became once again an underground movement that couldn't attract as many people as grunge, pop punk and rap did. Well, these people are not so wrong as this record sounds pretty modern and open-minded. \n\nCritics will compare this release to Iron Maiden's dark and mostly unpopular release \"X Factor\" and compare the situation of Judas Priest to a situation that many bands lived during the nineties such as Voivod: they walked on new paths; they had to replace some original members and faced rather poor crowds during concerts and mediocre sell quotes. The critics are once again right. \n\nCritics will judge this era of Judas Priest as a weaker one as the original line-up ultimately reunited as it was also the case of Iron Maiden or Voivod. They will claim that many fans forgot about \"Jugulator\" and also \"Demolition\" and rather hailed the comeback release \"Angel Of Retribution\". They will say that the quality of this record can't catch up with old and new Judas Priest releases. They are once again not far away as many people still don't overall accept this release and the band gained more popularity after the comeback.\n\nBut as in the case of Iron Maiden's \"X Factor\" or Voivod's \"Phobos\", I must admit that \"Jugulator\" is one of my very favourite releases of Judas Priest. It sounds raw, fresh and simply unexpected to me. It's a welcome change of style and rebirth of a legend that nobody expected. After the mediocre last release \"Nostradamus\", a strange series of concerts and the unexpected departure of K.K. Downing, I would even say that I would have preferred the band to stay together with Tim Owens. He's not yet as amazing and technically skilled on this release as he would be later but he has a very charismatic voice, a lot of talent and some much needed energy and did a very well job on here that can mess up with Rob Halford's performances. His stage acting might be less charismatic but he is a very gifted singer.\n\nConcerning the music, the band used a lot of atmospheric interludes, industrial sounds and sound collage effects that give this album a very desperate atmosphere. The drums are heavy and powerful, the main riffs very heavy and memorable, the guitar solos disctorted and insane and the bass guitar is very charismatic with its galloping chords as usual. The title track kicks off the album on a high note and already resumes what awaits us for the next hour to come: dark industrial sounds with intense riffs, distorted guitar solos, piercing screams, progressive and surprising changes of style and catchy vocal lines.\n\nThe album sounds very coherent without being closed minded and dull. The structures of the tracks are comparable but never ever alike. Every song has something special to offer. One of my favourite tracks is the very dark, aggressive and intense \"Death Row\" that has an atmospheric introduction that shivers down my spine each time I listen to it. The main riff is maybe the heaviest one the band has ever pulled off in their career. The sound effects in the chorus and in the bridges a lot of intensity to the track, the vocals are unchained and insane and the guitar riffs are gone wild. You must be deaf to not head bang along to this treasure. Another highlight is the surprising single \"Burn In Hell\" that kicks off very slow and develops into a more and more intense and pitiless track. The opening guitar riff is simple but effective, the bass guitar feels like pumping blood and the vocals are amazingly diversified as I never heard it from Rob Halford. The song is also catchy as hell. As a third highlight, I would cite the great epic album closer \"Cathedral Spires\" that is a little bit calmer than the rest and features an amazing vocal performance by Tim Owens who simply beats himself once again. That being said, there is not one single weak track on the record maybe a part of the groove metal orientated \"Blood Stained\" that is only pretty good but not as excellent as the rest. Let's also add that this album has really grown on me. A few years ago I would have given about ten percent less than today but as I got more and more open-minded musically and especially towards extreme metal stuff, this record gets more and more precious to me. \n\nMy final verdict may surprise you as much as it surprises me. I really like early Judas Priest with albums like \"Sad Wings Of Destiny\", \"Sin After Sin\" and \"Stained Class\". Without a doubt, I have hailed tracks like \"Breaking The Law\", \"The Hellion / Electric Eye\" or \"Painkiller\" but my ultimate favourite record is \"Jugulator\", the most surprising album of the band. Give this album a fair try after all these years and rediscover it. Don't even try to compare this to the records of the band as this is completely unique and this is what this record's charm is all about. I cut off one point for \u201cBlood Stained\u201d and one point for a minimal lack of diversity at some parts and another point for the mediocre album cover but I'm still surprised about this forgotten little masterpiece. It will never have the status of \"British Steel\" or \"Painkiller\" but open-minded metal maniacs and true Judas Priest fans should nevertheless adore this album.\n",
        "\nDid you like Killing Machine - AKA Hell Bent for Leather? Well, in that case British Steel should go down well with you, since aside from a change of drummer the album is pretty much a refinement and polishing of the general approach of that album. There's the tedious attempt at a football chant that would have been better off removed from the album (United, taking the place of the predecessor's Take On the World), there's the kickass pop-metal fast tracks (Breaking the Law, Living After Midnight) and the occasional nod to the style of Sin After Sin or Stained Class (The Rage, Steeler).\n\nOn the whole, the band are on good form, new drummer Dave Holland integrating well into their sound and Rob Halford giving enthusiastic vocal performances as always. Musically speaking, however, the album is a bit less varied than Killing Machine, which had the groovey as hell title track and the intriguing ballad Evening Star to break things up a bit. Still, it's an accessible and very listenable album which will appeal to a broad range of listeners, though aside from the classic Breaking the Law I wouldn't put many pieces of here on my personal Priest \"best of\" list - a lot of them are rather interchangeable.\n\nThe bottom line is this: if you want a Priest album where every single song is distinctive, original, packed with personality and an inspiration to legions of metal bands following it, then go for Sin After Sin, or Stained Class, or Sad Wings of Destiny - well, in fact any Priest album whose title starts with S is a good one. If you want a Priest album which kept the band competitive against the NWOBHM scallywags who were starting to challenge them on their own turf but doesn't exactly break a whole lot of new ground compared to its predecessors, British Steel's got your back.\n",
        "\nLadies and gentlemen, the only other Judas Priest album featuring the vocals of \"Tim\" The Ripper \"Owens\". How does this one stack up to \"Jugulator\"? Well, it's weird. The good songs on here are probably even better than the good one of the previous album, while the \"bad\" ones are arguably even worse. Well, \"worse\" is a harsh choice of words. They're not really bad per-say, but pretty generic and unmemorable. To me, that's almost worse than an outright bad song.\n\nThe sound, lyrical content, and structure here is almost totally different from the last album. As opposed to the demonic and apocalyptic jackhammering of the former, the songs on \"Demolition\" go for more of the classic Priest sound. The melody and catchiness are are more up and front here, the lyrics a bit less evil but still kinda dark, and most of the songs sound more condensed. It's sort of a modernish mix of \"Screaming For Vengeance\" and \"Turbo\" with a bit of \"Jugulator\" sprinkled on top.\n\nThe bandmates put out their usual great efforts here. Glenn and KK have come up with some decent solos here, though not as good as some of the ones on \"Jugulator\". Still, their efforts are strong. Ian Hill still pounds out those bass riffs with attitude, while Scott Travis is unfortunately wasted more so on this album thanks to the mostly mid-pace of the songs. PRIEST, make you songs faster!!! Give this guy more to do; as he has so clearly demonstrated on \"Painkiller\", he has fucking talent! Lastly, The Ripper is very good here. His vocals are clean and melodic, and while he doesn't utilize his obnoxious grunts and growls near as much here, he doesn't unleash his fantastic screams near as much either. Great effort on his part still, though.\n\nThe songs are a mixed bag here and not as consistent as the work on \"Jugulator\". But like I said, the better numbers are pretty great. Opening track \"Machine Man\" is really cool and catchy, with memorable riffing, a good solo, and some fun shouted vocals wrapped up in a \"Freewheel Burning\"-like package. The closer, \"Metal Messiah\", is similar is structure but slower. It has a short but good solo, but the main event here is The Ripper's vocals; he RAPS! Well, sort of. It's semi-rapping, and since it doesn't last too long, that makes it more tolerable than the real thing. Plus, it's worth the weight for the gorgeous main chorus. Believe me, you won't soon forget the elegant heaviness of \"Heeee's the one, The Father, The Son, Creaaator, Destroyer, METAL MESSIAH\"! Good stuff. Other good moments include a personal favorite, \"One On One\", which is a bit repetitive but has a great riff and an ass-kicking chorus, and \"Jekyll and Hyde\" with it's pounding bass work under the song's building pre/main chorus. However, it's also far from perfect. Heavier moments like \"Hell Is Home\", Devil Digger\", and Feed On Me\", just sort of come and go. Ballads (yes there's honest-to-science ballads here) like \"Close To You\" and \"Lost And Found\" feel somewhat tacked on and not particularly necessary, although I will admit \"Lost And Found\" is kind of a nice song.\n\nOverall, \"Demolition\" is an inconstant album, and pays for it. While the melody and classic feel are a little more in play this time around, only a few songs are really good. Most are just unmemorable and feel a little out of place and, like some songs on the last album, overly long. Worth a check for the more traditional feel, but again, only a few songs are really anything good, but at least they're really good. Though weak, \"Demolition\" isn't nearly as bad as people make it out to be.\n",
        "\nLet's get thing out of the way; this isn't really Judas Priest. Sure it's labeled as such, but think about. This is kind of like the American Godzilla film from 1998; it may be a movie about a giant lizard dubbed Godzilla that attacks a major city, but can one really label it a true Godzilla film? OH FUCK NO! Not even close. This album isn't really true Judas Priest. Sure it carries the label and sound a little like it, but when I think a Priest classic, I don't think a quasi-thrash album.\n\nHowever, having said that, is this a bad album? Well, sort of. A number of the songs downright blow and are mostly forgettable. But the songs that are good are actually pretty fucking awesome. Most of the Priest badboys are here and accounted for. Glenn Tipton and KK Downing create a killer whirlwind of cool solos and some vicious riffs, as well as the album's dark, apocalyptic lyrics, a move often incorrectly attributed to then new guy Tim \"The Ripper\" Owens. Speaking of whom, this guy is actually pretty damn good in all fairness. He has quite a great Halford-esque wail, as well as a pretty cool and even classy-sounding mid-level voice. However, his overuse of guttural growling and similar vocal techniques gets worn out and even a little obnoxious at times, again further from differentiating this album from the classic Priest mold. Rounding out the cast is Ian Hill on bass, now more up front thanks in part to the songs' heavy and vicious riffs, and the great Scott Travis on drums, who is now more in the background thanks to the production, but thankfully he pounds those skins hard and fast enough so his immense talents aren't totally wasted. \n\nA number of these songs, with their thrash-like speed and heaviness, don't exactly scream classic Judas Priest as I've mentioned, but a few are pretty cool. The title track has a goofy but interesting mechanical-sounding opening that segways into a song with decent riffing and a great solo; The Ripper's vocals soar in particular on this track. \"Dead Meat\", oft disliked by my fellow metalheads, I find pretty kick-ass. It starts with a synthesized sound of a growling dog, letting the listener know that they certainly will become dead meat. This leads directly into arguably the album's heaviest and most brutal riff, yet it's still somewhat catchy. A particularly classily-sung chorus from The Ripper rounds this one out. \"Blood-Stained\" has cool lyrics and more killer riffing, though I find the solo to be a bit long and forgettable. The legendary \"Bullet Train\" is also great, with a great solo, catchy vocals and screams, a catchy pre-chorus and main chorus, catchy riffs; it's catchy all around! The 9-minute closer \"Cathedral Spires\" is also often maligned for some reason I can't think off; it's so epic! Melodic guitarwork mixes with the super-heavy bass work to make for something both beautiful and harsh. Most other songs don't cut it. \"Death Row\" is mostly taken up by a too-long spoken intro that was done better on Priest's own \"Night Crawler\" or the hilarious opening to Grim Reaper's \"Final Scream\". When the song eventually does get going, it has \"filler\" written all over it. The too-heavy yet not heavy enough \"Decapitate\" is also fillerish and suffers from overly-simple lyrics, while songs like \"Burn In Hell\" goes on for too long with an over-long solo and yet another over-long opening.\n\nOverall, \"Jugulator\" suffers somewhat for its overlong songs, occasionally too-dark lyrics and inconsistent vocal work, but what few songs that rock rock pretty hard and use the album's flaws to their advantage. Is it a good Judas Priest album? Not really. But look at it as just another metal album, it's not too bad despite the flaws which hold it back.\n",
        "\nThe brief period of the early 80s, just before thrash metal began to rage out of New York and California, was an interesting one. For many bands hailing from Britain, Germany and The States it was a time of discovering a newer, faster, harder edged style that paved the way for heavy metal's faster and uglier cousin as exemplified in the early works of the Big 4 and a few others. But for the likes of Judas Priest, a band that had wandered into the early workings of speed metal a few years prior, it was a time of soul searching. In essence, they were trying to figure out whether they were going to take a step back to their rock roots or to fully embrace the ongoing heavy metal experiment that the NWOBHM was ushering in. 1981's \"Point Of Entry\" exemplified the former path, while the powerful beast that is \"Screaming For Vengeance\" takes something much closer to the latter path.\n\nWhile I was not outwardly hostile to the catchy yet restrained character of \"Point Of Entry\", the heavily energized and aggressive tendencies of this album are more to my liking, and most of the metal faithful tend to agree. While the underlying riff set still retains a heavily bluesy character and the formula is still quite straightforward, the attitude is much less celebratory and much more hard edged. In fact, this album stands as the closest that Priest has ever gotten to sounding like a NWOBHM band, particularly that of the parallel early days of Dickinson era Iron Maiden. Whether it be the melodic contours of the riveting opening duo \"The Hellion\" and \"Electric Eye\", or the strong resemblance to the speedy and busy guitar and drum work of Maiden's \"Invaders\" with an even more pervasive air-raid siren in the towering title song.\n\nBe all of this as it may, the earlier rock sensibilities and simplicity of the past couple of albums are still very strong, and actually better accomplished due to a crunchier guitar edge. The catchy arena favorites that walk the line between Accept and AC/DC in \"You've Got Another Thing Coming\" and \"Bloodstone\" definitely steel much of the attention, though the wickedly grooving \"Devil's Child\" holds its own, all of them featuring Halford's versatility both as a standard singer and screamer. But the real essence of what makes this an outstanding album is captured in the somewhat underrated \"Riding On The Wind\", which basically distills all of the strongest elements of \"Heading Out To The Highway\" and ups the ante in the tempo and vocal department. In typical yet not so typical fashion, the solos tantalize, the choruses entrance, and Ian Hill's bass work proves that AC/DC doesn't have a monopoly on making their bottom end do the bare minimum and still carrying some relevance to the arrangement.\n\nThe charms carried by each individual Judas Priest album are unique, and amongst the various masterpieces and lesser works of the 80s, this one has the edge in terms of the total package. It's a bit more versatile than \"Defenders Of The Faith\", a bit less happy-go-lucky than what came after, and is not quite as archaically produced as \"British Steel\". The beginnings of what ultimately becomes the Sci-Fi oriented tendencies of their 80s tenure take shape here with a few occasional studio gimmicks, but the real meat of this thing is still in the guitars and the vocals, though Dave Holland makes a decent racket on the kit as well. Song for song, it's a consistent ride from point A to point B with a fair share of twists and turns, all of them working well, even in the slower ballad department, which generally tend to be the band's weak spot and linkage to the glamish side of 80s rock. If nothing else, it proves that versatility is not a bad thing when approached with an eye for consistency.\n",
        "\nFreed from Gull Records and with a new confidence about them following the success of Sad Wings of Destiny, Judas Priest brought a follow-up to the table that was almost as mighty as its illustrious predecessor. With fast-paced songs like Sinner and Starbreaker consolidating the outlaw biker image the band were beginning to cultivate, the blueprint for later albums such as Killing Machine and British Steel began to take shape. Meanwhile, slower, doomier songs like Here Come the Tears or Let Us Prey/Call For the Priest proving once again that Priest could move from quiet moments of reflection to raucous cries of despair as on Dreamer Deceiver/Deceiver on the previous disc.\n\nUnlike Sad Wings, however, Sin After Sin isn't an absolutely perfect album. The end of the side presents the unwelcome spectacle of Priest turning their hand to romantic soft rock in the form of The Last Rose of Summer. It's not incompetently done soft rock if you like that sort of thing, but it's hard to deny that it feels ludicrously out of context; it just doesn't fit on the same album as Raw Deal, for goodness sake.\n\nStill, other experiments on the band's part are more successful. Their first cover version, Diamonds and Rust, takes a Joan Baez folk rock tune and turns it into an emotionally powerful metal anthem whilst album closer Dissident Aggressor might just be the angriest thing the band had produced up to that point. Close to perfection, but kept away from it by a flower of all things. Kind of a shame when you think about it, but the album's merits more than overpower its flaws.\n",
        "\nStained Class captures Judas Priest in the middle of a transition from the fearsomely innovative metal pioneers of Sad Wings of Destiny and Sin After Sin to the accessible (but still inventive) megastars of the Killing Machine/British Steel era. New drummer Les Binks is probably the weak link in the chain, since there's really not much to separate his performance from dozens of other hard rock drummers of the era, but he can keep time and that's all Tipton and Downing need to raise a storm with their dual lead guitar solos.\n\nIn terms of the material presented, the album kicks off with a blueprint for speed metal in the form of Exciter - featuring some of the most ear-piercing wails Rob Halford would ever muster - before delivering an album divided between accessible, catchy tracks like Invader or Better By You Better Than Me and murky, mysterious, death-obsessed experiments such as Stained Class and Beyond the Realms of Death. The latter song is the piece most reminiscent of previous material - mainly progressing as a quiet, low key ballad before erupting for the mighty choruses, with Halford singing the praises of death as an escape from an unacceptable world over some of the doomiest riffs the band would ever produce.\n\nBeyond the Realms is probably my favourite track from the album, although picking a favourite is necessarily a rather arbitrary process with an album as fearsomely consistent as this one. Although it is not as groundbreakingly innovative or crushingly heavy as its predecessor, Stained Class is at least a highly listenable album from beginning to end, with each and every track more than justifying its presence - quite simply, there is not a single piece of filler on the thing. Though I wouldn't put it above the two immediately preceding albums, Stained Class more than qualifies for a place in the top tier of Judas Priest albums.\n",
        "\nAfter making next to no impact (critically, commercially, or historically) with Rocka Rolla, Judas Priest returned with Sad Wings of Destiny and knocked the music world flat on its ass. Opening track Victim of Changes takes the heavy blues-rock template as driven into the ground (taking as its lyrical subject matter the classic blues topic of a no-good woman who done you wrong) plays that particular style of proto-heavy metal far heavier than any of its early proponents ever did, and then absolutely tears the format apart with wailing dual lead guitar solos and a frenzied vocal performance from Halford, who unleashes his trademark ear-shattering scream on record at long last.\n\nFrom the closing scream, all bets are off - having blown away all metal that came before it, the album proceeds to completely rebuild the genre in its image. Want a blueprint or two for the NWOBHM and speed bands who would take this album as their gospel? Have The Ripper and welcome to it. Want an acoustic ballad that turns into a prog-metal workout? The one-two punch of Dreamer Deceiver/Deceiver has your back. Want a death, destruction, and mayhem-obsessed suite of songs that would set the pattern for every classic Judas Priest album to follow? Turn the record over, you'll find all that and more on side two.\n\nAs well as giving the instrumental performance of their lives, carving the dual-lead blueprint into the decapitated skull of metal, the album also marks the point where Rob Halford truly came into his own as a singer. Even today, his vocal performance - ranging from demonic moans to banshee screams to delicate crooning to megalomaniac ranting - is a joy to hear, and I can only imagine what an incredible shock to the sense it must have been when the album first came out. Compared to every other singer on the hard rock and early metal scenes from the era, Halford sounds absolutely possessed on this album, and the rest of the band are raging berserkers to match.\n\nThis, quite simply, is the ship that launched three or four subgenres of metal, as well as establishing a credible alternative to the blues-rock basis of metal as established by Zeppelin and Sabbath. If you care even slightly about the history of metal, you need to own this album. If you just want to hear top-notch metal performed by a band at their absolute peak, then guess what, you still need to own this album.\n",
        "\nThere my friend sat. He sat on his leather chair, slumped in curved ball of mass in front of his computer screen. His face was trapped in a near-orgasmic expression, as though his mind literally been blown. What appeared to be drool leaked in a little drizzle from his mouth, a warped grin. Upon closer inspection, I realized that it wasn't drool; it was mercury. LIQUID METAL! Turning my head oh so slightly to the right, I faced the monitor. The words \"Judas Priest-Leather Rebel\" were scrawled across the top of the screen. Morbid fascination overtook me, and as a happy smirk began to crawl across my mortal lips, I clicked the play button...\n\nor some shit like that.\n\nBut seriously, this is IT! THE most metal album from THE best metal band of all damn time! There is absolutely NOTHING wrong with this album. You want bone-crushing speed? You got it! You want head-exploding vocals? You got it! Do you want Olympian heaviness? You got it! How about merciless guitars and sizzling drums? You got that too! Do you want a beatbox? Fuck that shit! \n\n\"Painkiller\", released in 1990, is oft considered to be Priest's magnum opus, a complete triumph in speed, aggression, and heaviness. And I totally agree. It's my favorite album from my favorite band. There's just nothing wrong with it! Rob Halford's voice is practically demonic, a wailing scream of immense proportions that he has never achieved before or since. Glenn Tipton and KK Downing's guitars twin-shred in such a way that me thinks the mighty sea god Poseidon has just shit his flipper in terror. Ian Hill's bass is shattering; totally a maker of earthquakes and volcanoes! Last but certainly not least, the blasting, light-speed, monster-sized double-bass hammering of Scott Travis, JP's then-new drummer and arguably the best thing to ever happen to the band.\n\nThe songs are all just perfect in their own ways. From the soul-mincing speed and legendary aggression of the title track to the upbeat hyper-speed of \"Leather Rebel\" to the monstrous solos and heavy ferocity of \"Metal Meltdown\" to the dark atmosphere of \"Nightcrawler\", all 10 tracks scorch with an all-mighty blaze of technical perfection that no other band has even come close to measuring up against.\n\nNow, why 98% instead of the full hundred? Well, just some nitpicks. The lyrics of most of the songs are rather cheesy nonsense, but it never gets on my nerves enough to stop listening to any particular song. Also, while still really good, the songs \"All Guns Blazing\" and \"Battle Hymn/One Shot At Glory\" tend to be forgotten soon after a single listen.\n\nThis album is the epitome of speed metal perfection. If you don't own it, then you are no metal fan. If you've never heard of it, then you are NO music fan. THIS...IS...THE PAINKILLER!\n\nSTANDOUTS:\nEverything, although the two previously-mentioned songs are slightly forgettable.\n",
        "\nOh lord, another glowing review for Judas Priest's foray into the heavier side of metal. Let's face it, the praise isn't thrown this way on accident, this is a beast of an album. There is one thing I'd like to address before I even really get down the grit of the review here, and that is that Painkiller is NOT Priest's best album. Not at all, I'd never claim otherwise. Sad Wings of Destiny, Sin After Sin, and Stained Class are all better albums from a musical standpoint. The holy trinity of S albums in the '70s carry a monstrous wealth of musical depth and complexity that Painkiller can only dream of reaching. The dynamics and vocal acrobatics are completely otherworldly and quite ahead of their time. I mean really, how many straight up heavy metal bands, that can still be classified as such by today's standards, were there in the mid '70s? Priest wasn't only in a league of their own, but their seminal works of the time still hold up today as absolute milestones of songwriting. Painkiller can't claim any of those technical landmarks as its own, not at all. It's nothing but big stupid speed metal riffs and mindless double bass. But honestly, given the choice, I'll pick Painkiller every single time, without even hesitating.\n\nPerhaps this makes me a dullard, but god damn I'd rather hang out with the cavemen than the physics professors if this is how they party. This album is a perfect example for dissecting the difference between an album being \"the best\" and \"my favorite\". Some examples, like Megadeth's Rust in Peace, are both my favorite and what I would also consider the band's best work. But Priest is different, they completely fucking nailed it early on and only got dumber as time went on. This, to me, seems to be their zenith. This is the perfect combination of retarded silliness, the leather and rock n' roll attitude of their '80s era, and the modernization of their music with heavier, faster songs and a much more aggressive approach. I mean look at the album cover. That ridiculous image right there sums up this whole album perfectly. It looks like Silver Surfer finally got his wings and then celebrated by stealing Wheel Gator from Sigma's Fortress. If that one-two punch of nerd references was lost on you, I'm sure you can still just look at the damn thing and see how over the top and silly looking it is. It's the perfect visual representation of what you'll find underneath.\n\nThe album begins with the title track, which probably still, after all these years, ranks as my #1 most favorite metal song of all time, across all subgenres. There's nothing wrong with it, this is Judas Priest working out some immeasurable amount of pent up anger and aggression, and the addition of drummer Scott Travis shows its merits right away as the album begins with a moderately short drum solo. It's fast, it's pounding, it's double bass out the wazoo, and it shows what Priest is now capable of with this young fellow behind the kit instead of the droning, mustachioed kiddie fiddler of Dave Holland. Once the song itself picks up, Rob Halford also shows off his pipes in a way he hasn't done since the glory days of those magical three S albums I mentioned earlier. Some of the passages he belts out are amongst the most heartfelt and agonized of his career, you can really tell he's giving it his all on this record. At not one single moment on the entire album does he sound content or laid back, he is always a snarling, raging beast behind the mic and is determined to scare off all of the infidels in the area. The title track also contains some of the best soloing that heavy metal has ever witnessed, the legendary Tipton and Downing team are also completely on top of their game here. They shred like they never have before, pushing themselves to the limit and beyond, which is quite remarkable considering Tipton was well into his 40s at this time. \n\nWith all of the band members pushing themselves so hard and possibly even trying to outdo each other, the whole album carries an inescapable frantic pace. Even the half ballady track, \"A Touch of Evil\", carries a sense of urgency unlike anything the band had ever done. In a way, this is kind of like the Judas Priest counterpart to Anthrax's Persistence of Time, which came out around the same time. Both albums are the band's darkest and heaviest works to date and were a result of outside factors and tension within the band. On tour for this album, as we all know, Rob Halford managed to wreck his motorcycle onstage, which somehow acted as a catalyst for him to essentially give the band the finger and walk away, thus ushering in the oft maligned Ripper era of the band.\n\nAnd again, that tension and aggression shows itself throughout the duration of Painkiller. \"All Guns Blazing\" is one of the more violent tracks in their repertoire lyrically, and the title track, \"Leather Rebel\", and \"Metal Meltdown\" are all completely balls out speedfests. \"Between the Hammer and the Anvil\" and \"Night Crawler\" are both sheer heavy metal anthems with catchy choruses and huge, hard hitting riffs. This is abundant in the one element that I always felt the '70s era lacked, fun. This is one of the most fun albums in heavy metal history, and while this is overblown and idiotic, I never feel like going out on a Friday night and cranking Sad Wings. This is over the top, headbanging fun and there's no other way I'd rather have it. This straightforward speed metal is something that Priest apparently completely rocks at, and even though they never really expanded upon the sound found here, it's still an everlasting testament to what makes Painkiller so damn awesome. It was a glorious one-off in an already glorious career. The internal strife and pent up frustration with the band members resulted in some of the most high octane music heavy metal as a whole has ever put out, nothing gets the blood pumping quite like throwing on \"Metal Meltdown\". It retains their '80s signature of being incredibly infectious while providing the goofy AOR anthems with a much needed shot in the arm. \n\nAnd that's what makes this close to being the perfect album in my eyes. It's a magnificent mixture of everything that made the band so noteworthy up to this point while also keeping it fresh and interesting. The aggressive style really works with Priest's songwriting skill and Painkiller is absolute proof of it. I'll be the first to admit, despite my vigorous masturbation, that this is a flawed masterpiece. The album loses steam at the end, with \"One Shot at Glory\" not being quite as big, over the top, or anthemic as it wants to be and preceding the kind of disappointing ending with the ballady track really seems to give it a weak back end, but in the context of the entire album it's just a quirk that I don't think brings the album down all that much, if at all. You'd still bone Marilyn Monroe, regardless of whether or not she's got that mark on her face, and I'd still bone this album, even if it does have that mark on its butt. I still recommend this to every newcomer who seems interested in metal, to every jaded veteran who for some stupid reason hasn't heard this, to anybody with a pulse who seems to realize music exists, really. I write love notes to this album weekly, and this time I decided to publish it.\n\nCall me!\n",
        "\nYou would, after all, have expected Judas Priest's debut to have hit the scene with an earth-shattering kaboom as opposed to an unenthusiastic thud. The fact is that whilst the essential elements of the band's sound is in place, they're not quite firing on all cylinders yet. Tipton and Downing's twin lead guitar playing is all present and correct, and shows a certain influence from Wishbone Ash (who'd been doing the twin lead for years in a folk-rock/prog-rock sort of style), though of course with more of a metallic edge than usual, though except for on the title track or Run of the Mill they never quite manage the full roar of their usual sound. Likewise, whilst Rob Halford's high-pitched singing voice is already developed, he never lets rip with the sort of shrieks we are used to hearing from him.\n\nCompositionally speaking, the set isn't particularly compelling either, being mostly rooted in the sort of blues-influenced hard rock that was hardly uncommon in 1974, with the occasional nod to fellow Birmingham residents Black Sabbath spicing things up. According to the band, they wanted to include some of the material which would eventually appear on Sad Wings of Destiny on this album, but were pressured into delivering a more commercial album to start off with; I don't know whether that's true, but I can certainly believe it, because there's a lack of enthusiasm evident on this record which is absent from the followup. A piece of metal history, but one that has not aged at all well.\n",
        "\nEven though Judas Priest has been a good band from the start (early 70's) in my opinion, they didn't explode until the 90's/2000nds. Painkiller, which had a very big impact on the world of heavy metal in 1990, helped Priest prove that they were far from dead. And in 2005 came Angel of Retribution, maybe not as fulfilled as the pre-mentioned Painkiller, but still a very very good Judas Priest album.\n\nThe overall sound of the album is that of liquid steel coming straight from the stereo. Utterly heavy and ferocious (with the exeption of Worth Fighting For and Angel) Angel of Retribution delivers a sound fans of heavy music should love! Fans of Judas Priest's heavier sound, developed from 1990 and forwards know whats coming. Gone is both the gloomy, somewhat depressive 70's Priest sound (small traces can be heard in Revolution though), and the more positive upbeat 80's Priest sound (also this sound can be found however in Deal with the Devil). Angel of Retribution instead delivers metal fit for the 2000nds. Well-produced crisp clear sound with plenty of artistic energy. You might think a band like Judas Prist, that's been along for so long would loose their energy and attitude after so many years in the music buisness, but Priest proves over and over again that they deserve their unofficial, but greatly accepted title \"Metal Gods\". \n\nWhen it comes to the songs on the album, Judas Rising, Deal With The Devil, Demonizer, Wheels of Fire and Hellrider are all mid- to fast tempo songs. Aggressive and energetic, these are the songs you are most likely to remember if you don't like slow metal. However, if you do, you might like the rest of the album, which contains some calmer songs, and even two ballads: Angel and Worth Fighting For. These songs are more emotional in their lyrics, opposed to the other half of the album, where the lyrics mostly revolve around demons, motorcycles and heavy metal. Revolution and Loch Ness are the only songs on the album not as energetic as most of the songs, but still not ballads. \n\nSo how are the musicians you ask? Glenn and K.K are excelent, as usual. Very solid riffing and many good solos. This is what the duo of Tipton and Downing are famous for, and they don't let their fans down. Scott Travis shows of some impressiv drumming skills, and Rob never seems to loose that high pitched voice of his. Ian Hill delivers some strong base, especialy on Worth Fighting For.\n\nAs a whole, I'm not afraid to say this is one of Judas Priest's strongest albums. As one of my personal favorites, I give Angel of Retribution a score of 90/100.\n",
        "\nI was really expecting to like this record; Painkiller's been my favourite Priest since time immemorial and I've always been somewhat enamoured, or at least more sympathetic than most, of the Ripper era. At the end of the day, I prefer the newer, heavier, stupider version of Priest over that old bunch of nerds that did Victim of Changes and shit. This breaks the streak of good Priest albums though; it's quite mediocre, in fact maybe not all that good, in fact maybe it's up there with Turbo and RiD as the worst Priest ever written (haven't heard Nostradamus yet, probably won't).\n\nMusically, it's rarely truly horrible (Angel being an exception, it's the worst ballad they've ever done); most of the songs have a lot of almost-there moments with a predictable stumbling block. 'Worth Fighting For''s effective, bummed out road ballad (feelin ya there, Halford) vibe ends up going nowhere very quickly- i'm not sure what annoys me so much about the bridge in that song but it does get irriating quick? 'Hellrider' has a brilliant instrumental section that's ruined by.. the rest of the song. Demonizer's retarded chorus, Lochness's close-but-no-cigar shot at Candlemass-esque despair and grandeur, well, the band tries hard on this album, but none of the songs do itt- musically speaking. \n\nI say \"musically speaking\" because while Downing, Tipton and co generally hover around the mediocre mark here, that's not the main issue with the album. As mentioned earlier I've generally preferred Priest at their heaviest and stupidest (Painkiller is my favourite Priest song, after all) but here there's just too much stupid without the heavy- or at least without quality music, anyway- balancing it out. By and large, my philosophy has been one of \"I don't care about lyrics but if they're really bad they can drag an album down\", and here's all the proof of said train of thought. Demonizer (OUT DEMONS OUT), Lochness, Wheels of Fire- probably the best song on here, with it's rocky British Steel esque good times- not musically awful, not brilliant, but not bad- but the lyrics, man. They just kill it for me! Wouldn't be bad if this was a death metal album, or they were soaked in reverb, mixed down and what have you, but they're there high in the mix, highly audible, and meant to be sung along with.\n\nI daresay if you can ignore the lyrics you will, at least, find this passable and mildly entertaining in sections. For the rest of us though, the stupid/heavy ratio is just too shitty. Avoid, as it's basically a really bad version of Painkiller.\n",
        "\nWow priest has created a symphonic concept album, full of bombastic keyboards, tasty orchestral elements, interludes, and all that stuff a la Nightfall In Middle Earth, and the great thing is that they manage it perfectly. This album sounds fresh and is something adventurous for Priest, a stark contrast to the safe comeback of Angel Of Retribution. As the name suggests, this is a concept album about the 17th century French prophet Nostradamus. The sound of this album is closer to Virgin Steele\u2019s Atreus series or Jag Panzer\u2019s Thane to the Throne, except that this sounds more dark and brings out a mysterious atmosphere with it. One more thing about this album is that Judas Priest sound reenergized something that has failed to happen since Painkiller.\n\nThe highlight of the album is once again Rob Halford. On this album he proves to the world that he isn't called the Metal God for nothing. Even in this age the man has got an amazing power in his voice that none of his thousand imitators have. He sounds aggressive and possessed on tracks like Persecution, Death but also melodic on softer tracks like Lost Love or Sands Of Time. His range is intact and he uses it to perfection. KK and Tipton are also in great shape. Their soloing in tracks like Persecution, Future Of Mankind reminds me of the glory days of Painkiller and Stained Class. The riff work of these two is equally competent as evident on songs like Death. Scott Travis is as competent as he was on Painkiller, but avoids his excess showoff here as he did on that album. Ian Hill is the bass player so I think it would be wise not to speak anything about the bass. The keyboards are used perfectly. Some people claim that they drown the guitars, true, but they are instrumental in creating the dark, mysterious feel of the album. The production has drowned the guitars much more than it should have done, otherwise it is great.\n\nThis is a double CD album with 23 total tracks comprising over hundred minutes of music. It contains several interludes of which most are soft, containing lot of keyboards and calm vocals of Halford. Containing 14 tracks with variations this album is bound to be a bit inconsistent which I expected, but surprisingly it is a lot more consistent than expected. We start the first disk with a keyboard intro and a great one that too. Not one like the countless silly modern European power metal bands put in their album. It has a great atmosphere. It leads it way into Prophecy, a catchy up-tempo Priest rocker with atmospheric keyboards. Revelations, another great song starts with an excellent guitar work. It contains interesting vocal pattern during the verses. It is another highlight. War isn\u2019t as interesting as the above songs. It is overlong, but again great atmosphere in this song. Surprisingly, the interlude Sands Of Time sounds great thanks to a great vocal performance. Pestilence And Plague is another song which sounds like an epic-fied traditional Priest rocker. Then comes the essential highlight of the album, Death, which is Judas Priest successfully attempting doom metal. The vocals are the real standout in the song. Halford sounds fucking possessed and aggressive. The atmosphere is also superb. Lost Love is a ballad and one of the low points in the CD. The closer Persecution is the fastest and most intense song in the first disk. It is one another of the essential highlights of the album.\n\nThe second disk starts again with an interlude, not as good as the one that opened the album but still well to do. Exiled is another slow and mid-paced song, with a well to do chorus. Alone is a ballad and a fine one. Again it has a very catchy chorus. Visions is another song which sounds like an epic-fied priest rocker, so not much to say about that song. New Beginnings is another ballad and the worst song off the album. Then comes \"they, never broke my will\", the title track which is the heaviest, the fastest and the most intense song in the album, and yes it maintains the epic nature of the album. It starts out softly in an epic way, but the suddenly it gushes out like a storm. Halford's scream which might be one of his most vicious is indeed hair raising. The lead work in this song is truly spectacular. The album closes with Future Of Mankind which is the longest and the most epic song in the entire album. Some of the best vocals by Halford are found here. It contains an excellent interplay between the guitars and the keys.\n\nThis is one of the best albums ever put out by Priest, yes I dare to compare it with Stained Class or Sin After Sin. It may not be as aggressive as Painkiller, but the songwriting and composition attempted here is one of the highest levels by Priest ever. Surprisingly the lyrics are good. Again the reason for this album to sound this good is that Judas Priest attempted something new and unexpected here. Many of the songs are traditional Judas Priest rockers but with the atmospheric keyboards and orchestral elements they sound completely new. So concluding Nostradamus is an amazing album and a must have for any heavy metal fan.\n",
        "\nIn 1990, Judas Priest had already been a well-established band and were considered one of the first true heavy metal bands since the 70's. However, some accused the band of losing a few steps with the releases of Turbo and Ram it Down. Whatever criticisms were thrown in their path, Priest blasted them into the air with the quintessential Painkiller in 1990. Twenty years have passed since then, but metal has still never been the same.\n\nPerhaps Judas' Priest's first \"speed\" metal album, each song sounds like a heavy metal anthem injected with jet fuel. The album starts off with the title track and features a fast-paced, rattling drum solo by then-newcomer Scott Travis before ultimately erupting into a booming riff. Not just heavy, but booming. Halford shows off his range with shrieking vocals telling us the story of the metal savior, the Painkiller. Duelling guitar solos by the always excellent K.K. Downing and Glenn Tipton fill the bridge before Halford delivers one final verse and chorus before ending with a note held for what seems like twenty seconds while Travis plays another drum solo that starts slow but picks up in speed and intensity before the song ends in an explosion of sound with Halford shouting \"Pain!\" How can the rest of the album possibly follow that? Surprisingly, it does.\n\nHell Patrol has a griding riff that sounds similar to that of a military march, All Guns Blazing features more shrieking and high-pitched vocals by metal god Halford, Metal Meltdown is quite literally a metal meltdown with a mindblowing opening guitar solo, and Night Crawler tells the story of a viscious monster with a bridge that is strangely quiet, but dark and sinister. All of these aforementioned songs are classic, but nothing prepares one for A Touch of Evil. Starting off with what sounds like wailing winds in a graveyard is followed by a spine-tingling keyboard and then heavy riff. The keyboard and later guitar solos give the song a real chilling and haunting feel with a mix of Halford's baritone and shrieking vocals. A song about forbidden and forsaken love, this about as close as you will get to a power ballad, but to say that it is isn't even close.\n\nThe bass by Ian Hill is sometimes lost in the speed and loudness of the guitars and drums, and songs like Between the Hammer and the Anvil and One Shot at Glory may not be as memorable as Painkiller or a Touch of Evil, but there is really nothing at all wrong with this album. Incredibly fast and incredibly heavy with songs of appocalypse and impending disaster, the emotion deliverd by Halford in his vocals is as powerful as the sound of the music. Judas Priest were already metal legends before this album, but Painkiller is what makes them immortal. If one looked up heavy metal in the dictionary, one would see the iconic album art of the Painkiller and the faces of the band members next to the definition. This isn't just metal. This is the Painkiller.\n",
        "\n\"Oh master, master...\"\n\n\"Yes...who is this again?\"\n\n\"Your faithful servant, o god of metal! I live to serve thee!\"\n\n\"Good. Suck my dick.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"DO IT! OBEY YOUR MASTER!\"\n\n\"Y...yes, god of metal...\"\n\nUndoubtedly an exaggeration, but yes, there was a time when I literally worshiped Priest and Rob Halford as the metal gods (and god) and would have done anything they demanded. Including sucking off the metal god himself, although I'm not gay. Oops...did I just say that outloud? *nervous laughter*\n\nHomosexual references aside, Priest truly are the metal gods, for so many reasons that it's hard to count. Defenders Of The Faith, while not the band's very finest hour, comes close to that peak that would be reached on Painkiller.\n\nWhy? First off, let's go over the worshiping side once more. As those who have been fortunate enough to read my other reviews, often of Iron Maiden albums, are most likely aware, I have often referred to this album as a masterpiece, a heavy metal album by which to judge other heavy metal albums, a standard which is rarely ever met. I have railed against those who dismiss it as commercial while fellating Maiden's cock without shame (no offence to Maiden fans, and I do love the band too, just not as much as I love Priest...usually). I have called it a masterwork of real heavy fucking metal.\n\nIs this accurate? Yes and no. When I'm in fanboy mode, then yes, I do worship albums such as this and Painkiller. When I'm not, and I step back and look at it seriously, this album isn't perfect. So close, oh so close, but not quite.\n\nFor a start, like almost all metal from this same period with the exception of any and all thrash, doom, or early death/black metal acts, Defenders of the Faith is filled with gray areas that are somewhere between hard rock and heavy metal. The two terms are often interchangeable, and there's nothing wrong with good hard rock; Purple, Zeppelin, AC-DC, Kiss, etc, are all fantastic bands, whether metal or just plain ol' rock 'n' roll. However, Priest are usually regarded as \"pure\" heavy metal.\n\nThe problem is, just what is \"pure heavy metal\"? Does it even exist? And if it does, what is it? The NWOBHM? Thrash? Doom?\n\nI would say the latter. Like it or not, heavy metal started out low and slow. The first metal band I ever heard was not Priest, nor Maiden, nor Metallica, but Candlemass, and they blew me away. Everything else, with the exception of thrash and death metal acts, seemed very light in comparison. There's something about downtuned guitars playing monstrous power chords in a slow, oppressive fashion that is just so motherfucking heavy. Priest never really sounded like this - they were fun, fast, upbeat, and yes, aggressive and heavy, but were they always 100% metal? Of course not, because they started in an era when heavy metal hadn't even been properly defined yet. That was the 70's, baby. Filled with experimentation of all kinds. Are Rainbow metal? Or just plain ol' hard rock? Who can say? That's the whole point...and it doesn't really matter.\n\nThe 80's were a different manner. By then, the use of the term heavy metal had become widespread, and the genre was increasing in popularity hugely. Ironically, this was mostly due to the glam metal acts from the same period, which had a lot more in common with hard rock than \"pure\" heavy metal. Nevertheless, some of these bands (Early Def Leppard, Motley Crue, Twisted Sister, etc) were at one point or another definitely heavy enough to be called heavy metal. \n\nAnd Priest? They'd been metal for years. Not the same kind as Sabbath, though; they were always a different beast. They showed that metal didn't have to just be slow and oppressive - it could also be fun, upbeat, aggressive and very exciting while also being really heavy. No downtuned guitars of course.\n\nSince I seem to have gone off on a tangent here, let me bring this back to my original point (and yes, it does fit in): Defenders Of The Faith, like many glam metal acts of the time, is not 100% pure heavy metal. This is not a criticism by any means, I am simply pointing out something about genres (but yes, that does have something to do with the way I am rating the album, to a point) If the NWOBHM ever was pure heavy metal, then the only songs that really fit that mold were the aggressive ones, because let's face it, no matter how much distortion you give your guitar, if you aren't downtuning, and are simply playing standard rock riffs, then you aren't heavy metal. If you play fast and aggressive, on the other hand, that's a different matter entirely. When Priest go for the jugular on this album, then yes, that's definitely heavy metal, of the same kind that would lead to thrash - and by this point in history already had (1984, the same year Ride The Fucking Lightening was released, fucking hell). That's speed metal, one could argue, and yes, heavy metal that undoubtedly is. \n\nOn the other hand, when they slow down and play with more of a groove, it's no more pure heavy metal than AC-DC. Back in Black was pretty damn heavy, as you surely all know, but it was just heavy rock, not heavy metal. It's still heavier of course, as Priest did have a heavier guitar tone, but when they weren't playing chugging riffs, they could easily have been hard rock. Perhaps that's the whole point; Hard Rock and Heavy Metal aren't all that different, but at the same time they are - it all depends on the band.\n\nThe main point here, however, is that \"pure\" heavy metal, as a genre, doesn't really exist outside of the Sabbath mold, and that's doom metal. The idea of \"pure\" 80's metal is often a fallacy. Speed and thrash? Fuck yeah. Doom? Definitely. Black and death? Absolutely. NWOBHM? Questionable. Everything else generally comes under the glam label, which is rarely ever pure metal. Sure it all depends on how fast and aggressively you play, which is why Maiden are often considered to be more pure heavy metal than Priest. Perhaps they would have been - I have no idea, as their guitar tones were often unbearably shitty. That's one mistake Priest didn't make here: Defenders has an incredible tone, really thick, heavy, and all around powerful.\n\nWhen this album slows down, though, it is generally weaker, and closer to straightforward 80's hard rock. There's nothing wrong with this, in and out of itself; I love 80's hard rock, and I love a lot of glam too. But it doesn't really fit with what Priest were trying to do with this record, which was, I believe, to get further away from the more commercial side of Screaming for Vengeance and more in line with the original speed metal they had helped to create back in the 70's. Freewheel Burning is a perfect example of the latter: with its pounding speed, aggressive feel, over the top vocal delivery, and very fast riffing, this is without a doubt heavy metal, of the speed/power variety that Priest pretty much invented. It's quite an odd choice for a single, being very heavy and not really typically commercial at all (aside from the polished production), and an even odder choice for a first single. (the second would make more sense, but not in a good or metal way. More on that later) Nevertheless it's brilliant, Halford giving as great a performance here as ever, the guitars crushing and heavy, some really interesting moments (Halford's near rapping during the bridge), and brilliant leadwork. The solo here is fantastic, very powerful, metal, and all around good. It's about as perfect an opener as one could ask for, and ends in a very classic heavy metal way, all the instruments pounding away before ending with a power chord. \n\nJawbreaker continues in this same style. It's slower, but definitely metal, with a chugging main riff and a somewhat desperate tone (quite amusingly, considering the song is apparently about fellatio with the giant beast on the cover) that sets it well apart from standard 80's arena rock. Of course, parts of the album are like that, and despite what I said earlier, they do add to its charm somewhat. Arena metal could easily be used to describe an album like this - it's got a big, expansive, and not at all suffocating sound - very wide and open, and epic.\n\nNow we come to a more hard-rockish song, in \"Rock Hard, Ride Free\". The very title includes the word rock, so why not? This is a classic song in every way, perhaps less metal in terms of the riffs overall, but with enough chugging riffs and super-melodic solos to place it apart from standard 80's rock, like its predecessor (although Jawbreaker was more obviously metallic). It's a rock anthem, a metal anthem, and a biker anthem all in one. The middle section is the most interesting, and there are some fantastic solos to be heard here. Again, the song has an epic, expansive feel that places it squarely in the best part of the 80's.\n\nMost Priest albums also include a true epic, some really memorable (and usually, very metal) song that really stands out. Defenders is no exception. The Sentinel is one of Priest's finest songs, with a brilliant, epic opening, epic riffs, epic vocals and...well, epic everything. Seriously, this is just one of those songs that you have to hear in order to understand. This is crushing, without a doubt real heavy metal (with its speed metal riffing and over the top vocals), possessed of some fiery power and edgy nature that is best exemplified by Rob's performance, which is nothing short of mesmerising. That it's cheesy and OTT is irrelevant; it just plain works. The best version of this song can be found on an 80's live video from Texas, where Rob really gives it his all. I urge you to find this video, for it is truly amazing.\n\nAbout here is where the album temporarily trails off, first into something rather boring, less metal, and a little stale, then wildly into totally insane territory for a brutal speed metal crusher that unfortunately has some of the worst lyrics Priest ever wrote. The former is \"Love Bites\", Defenders Of The Faith's second single, and a rather obvious choice too - it's not very heavy due to it's slow, rockish verses, and very predictable chorus. The best part is, again, Halford's singing. He goes a long way towards making the song more unique. Sadly, that's all there is to \"Love Bites\", which, if not for its dark lyrics and cool vocal delivery would just be a generic 80's hard rock song.\n\nThe latter is \"Eat Me Alive\", which is not about being devoured by some monster, so much as about a deranged, super-macho homosexual forcing some hapless (male) victim to eat HIM alive at gunpoint, and keep on doing it until he has a huge orgasm made clear both by his own exclamations and the \"explosion\" of guitars and drums, which slowly fades out as he relaxes after...I'm sorry. I think I got carried away there. \n\nIn all seriousness, this song would be fantastic if not for the ridiculous lyrics. It's got everything: pounding drums, crushing speed, aggressive riffing, and a vicious tone that almost places it in the same ballpark as thrash. Unfortunately, it's about a subject so absurd that it couldn't possibly be menacing. Well, truthfully it probably could be. How would most straight guys feel about being forced by a huge, powerful gay man to either suck his cock or have their brains blown out? Probably rather scared. I know I would be...even if it was the metal god.\n\nEven if you look at it like this however, you've then got the bit towards the end where said metal god has a huge orgasm, and the guitars and drums seem to be following it. Which is plainly laughable. Genuinely funny, yes, but was that the band's intention? Who can say...all I know is that this song does have a legacy, and that is being No. 3 on Tipper Gore's \"Filthy Fifteen\" list of \"offensive\" songs. From that point of view, it rocks. \n\nThankfully, the album now heads back into more familiar territory, with a pounding rocker. Some Heads Are Gonna Roll was the third single from the album, and it's not hard to see why - it's catchy, quite heavy but not too much so, and a far cry from speed metal. However, its chugging riffs and desperate vocal performance set it apart from standard hard rock. Like most of the rest of the songs on the album, and unlike Love Bites or (to a degree) Rock Hard Ride Free, this is a heavy metal song. It's also one of the album's stronger cuts, being a welcome return to the more serious after Love Bites and Eat Me Alive, and also just works better than those songs. It's very simple and straightforward, but that doesn't matter. Like The Sentinel, it just works.\n\nEvery Priest album must have a ballad, it seems. All their classic 70's albums included, so I can't fault them there. \"Night Comes Down\" is one of their greatest ballads. It's slow (duh), but also heavy, somewhat depressing, and very dark. It's certainly not a standard love song. The lyrics are about being alone after a relationship, yes, but there's also a reference to nightmares and the hints that the song is about genuine depression. Does it have a layer of 80's cheese to it, though? Yes. But how many emotional metal and/or rock songs of the 80's didn't? Metallica's ballads (and Megadeth's 'In My Darkest Hour') were the exceptions, not the rule. In this case, the cheesy side doesn't hurt the song at all, and Halford again gives a brilliant performance. He almost always gives everything his best, and he fails to disappoint on this very emotional song. It sounds almost as if he's really feeling what the lyrics are about.\n\nOf course, this is a Priest album, and we can't end on a downer, now can we? The band clearly didn't think so, as the last song here is not the aforementioned Night Comes Down, but a pounding anthem known as Heavy Duty, which trails into what passes for this album's title track. The former is quite heavy, but rather silly, with lyrics that demonstrate Halford's true affection for his audience, if you know what I mean, wink wink nudge nudge. Seriously, I'm not remotely homophobic; it would bother me just as much if a female singer was constantly talking about fucking or being fucked by her predominantly male, or even female audience. It's simply that Halford does this too much. From Killing Machine onward, there hasn't been a single Priest album without at least one sex song. Heavy Duty is hardly the worst of these, it's just kinda grotesque; which, in and out of itself isn't really a bad thing. Rock isn't always meant to be pretty, and we've all seen what happens when it gets too pretty (certain glam metal artists). Still, a little more subtlety would have gone a long way towards making these songs easier to respect, along with their writer. Not that I don't have a huge amount of respect for Rob - on the contrary. (You've all read my tirade at the beginning of this review, and probably gotten excited, you dirty bastards) I simply think that he could have toned it down a little.\n\nNevertheless, Heavy Duty is a passable song. What follows is simply a massive chant of \"Defenders of the Faith\" repeated over and over, which continues for a while before slowly fading out. Again, not bad at all, and very anthemic, but this is how the album closes? It could have been a lot better.\n\nWhen analysing Priest's material, it's very important to look at the differences and the relationship between rock 'n' roll and heavy metal. Defenders, for all its power, is not a total heavy metal maelstrom like its third successor Painkiller. Like many other albums of the era, it is content to rest somewhere between plain ol' rock 'n' roll and the most extreme excesses of heavy metal. It is not an album filled entirely with metal cliches; for every Freewheel Burning, Jawbreaker, or Sentinel, there is a Rock Hard Ride Free, a Love Bites, and a Night Comes Down. The former are almost extreme, overstated metal cliches (Jawbreaker, regardless of the fact that it is most likely a song about cocksucking, is still very much metal in its delivery, lyrics, and sound), while the latter are blatant rock and roll cliches. Rocking, sex (even with vampires), and lost love. Bon Jovi, Kiss, AC-DC, Aerosmith, and pretty much every other classic rock band out there has written songs like these. The difference is that Priest gives them more of a metal coating, in keeping with the spirit of the rest of the album. Nevertheless, it is for this reason that the lines between heavy metal and hard rock are often blurred. It would take Priest another six years, during which they would flirt with the cheesiest excesses of glam metal to a huge degree, attempt a return to their old sound with some extra speed and heaviness, and suffer through a horrible trial, before finally reinventing themselves into something so purely heavy metal that it abandoned all rock 'n' roll pretenses and gave in to the most absurd, ridiculous, and extreme metal cliches possible for a band.\n\nFor what it is, Defenders of the Faith is a fantastic album. Drawing a line somewhere between the speed metal they invented, hints of thrash (if only slightly), and good old fashioned heavy rock, they crafted a fine album, one to be savoured much like a vintage wine. But also, one to be played loud, without shame, and at parties. Yes, parties. It might not fit as easily with the majority of guests as Slippery When Wet, or even Appetite for Destruction, or hell, even Back in Black. It dares to rock harder than any of them, and in doing so possibly alienating those who fear rock 'n' roll's most extreme breed, Heavy Fucking Metal. But come now, would anyone who truly loves Priest or heavy metal ever even have friends like that? (I should know...I do, but they are more tolerant and like some metal, so I forgive them)\n\nSo basically, treat this as a party record, but one to really rock out to. In the (not entirely accurate) words of Manowar - Play it loud, be proud, and fuck anyone who doesn't like what you love. Its small flaws aside, Defenders is a great record that any metalhead should be proud to own. True Heavy Metal (for the most part) at its finest, by Britain's own metal gods, from the industrial wastes of Birmingham. Essential.\n\nEpilogue:\n\n\"Ah, that was very good, indeed. Well done, servant of metal.\"\n\n*gasping for air* \"Thankyou, o god of metal...\"\n\n(For the record, I never sucked off Rob, and anyone who says otherwise is a liar and a faggot. I mean a fool. Or a poser. Whatever...)\n",
        "\nAwe. That was my initial reaction upon hearing this for the first time. On a normal occasion, it might not be as such. But, this was one of my first metal albums; I bought it at a garage sale on cassette for 50 cents. This was when I was beginning my love affair with metal, so this sonic assault was entirely new to my virgin ears. This intense amalgamation of speed, power, NWOBHM, and maybe even a tad bit of thrash remains just as aggressive two decades later.\n\nThe album certainly looks menacing enough from its cover. A winged, metalloid demon riding a flying, draconic motorcycle with lethal buzzsaws for wheels, roaring at the sky in triumph?! Metal enough for you?! It was amazing for me as a padawan of the metal order. The booklet has the pronged Priest insignia inscribed behind the lyrics on every page and a black and white photograph of the band in traditional leather and studs. Immediate icons for a boy of 15.\n\nAnyways, onto the music! The guitar work is absolutely blazing in all senses of the word. The riffing is fast, tight, melodic, and original. Chugs, staccato, melodic wank up on the high frets, it's all present. A tinge of technicality is definitely present; not just boring power chords anymore. Glenn Tipton and K.K. Downing have stepped up their game to keep it extremely innovative. The riffing style is normally fast and melodic, but some are more mid-paced, and Between the Hammer and the Anvil starts with slow, doomy chords. And the solos! RADICAL!! Both guitarists trade off lead and rhythm duties, and each of them do both jobs to a T. Tipton seems to be more structured and Downing seems to be slightly more chaotic with squeals and dive-bombs. The tone is crisp and saturated with brightness and distortion.\n\nThe vocals are generally high pitched and soaring way above everything, with some slight reverb at times to add some epic effect. Halford is a legend in his own right, on par with Bruce Dickinson, and Ronnie James Dio, and has set the bar high on this album for future power and speed metal vocalists and is THE example to be emulated. He sings generally cleanly, with a coloring of harshness and anger at times.\n\nIan Hill, the resident bassist, is audible, but nothing of true note here. He thunders along behind the rhythm guitar and never anything very special, but then again, keeping up with the ferocity is quite a feat.\n\nThe best thing they ever did was hiring Scott Travis to sit behind the skins. Replacing the mundane Dave Holland, who could have easily been in AC/DC (yes that's an insult) was a wonderful move, for he without a doubt could not have kept the pace Travis sets forth and would have been a liability to the rest of the band. Scott relies heavily on double bass, relatively simple beats, and lightning fast fills and rolls.\n\nLyrically, the album is both \"trve\" and goofy at the same time. The poetic verses about glory, mythical and apocalyptic beings, leather, metal, and more leather are amazing but also somewhat ridiculous. They are over the top at times but are also extremely metal, in the most literal sense. Also, Touch of Evil sounds like a totally romantic cheesy plea of infantile lust.\n\nThe production is very clear. Every instrument can be clearly heard, or at least felt. The vocals are a center point obviously, rising above the writhing guitar. The drums are audible and the bass pounding with the kick drum can be clearly felt as well as heard. The snare has a nice sounding snap to it.\n\nStandout Tracks:\n-Painkiller is a blazing song complete with killer, pounding double bass intro, melodically deadly riff, greased lightning solos.\n-Hell Patrol has a really interesting staccato riff syncopated with the snare drum and some lower-end singing which is a nice touch.\n-Metal Meltdown has a lovely fast-paced thrashy riff in the beginning, an insane intro solo, and an interesting chord progression.\n-One Shot at Glory is an anthem of metal, hands down. It has a great riff, chorus that makes you wanna run and never stop, and singing that sounds like a call to war if I've ever heard one.\n\nOverall, this is a really good album, for either a beginner like myself or a seasoned metal veteran. No real weak points, and every song is good by itself or in sequence. There are no real bad songs, and even the filler, Battle Hymn, is pretty gnarly. It has everything a metal masterpiece should have: pounding drums with awesome double bass, soaring vocals from a legend, heavy, melodic, and fast riffing, magnificent, chaotic solos, and production where everything is audible.\n\nPros:\n-Amazing Guitar, both riffing and solos\n-Much Better drumming\n-Clear, Thick Production\n-Rob Halford (yes, he is a pro by himself)\n\nCons:\n-Can be same-y; same basic structure, solos similar\n-All Guns Blazing intro is kinda awful\n-Touch of Evil sounds like a pre-pubescent romantic attempt\n",
        "\nLet's just come right out and admit, right from the get go, that \"Ripper\" Owens never adequately replaced the mighty Halford. I mean, there are few voices in heavy metal history that can compete with Halford's pipes. So it's no wonder that the majority of reviews of Jugulator one reads tend to view the record from an automatically biased viewpoint: i.e., Owens is no Halford. I'd like to NOT dwell on the obvious differences between Halford and Owens, and take the album on its own merits. It's difficult, but I'll try.\n\nListening to Jugulator with fresh ears, if you will, I have to say, right off the bat, that this is a pretty heavy album. The guitars are solid and crunchy, with a nice death metally low-tuned sound to them. The drum work is consistently solid. And whoever says Owens lacks Halford's high notes is simply not being honest. (Whoops, I'm already comparing Owens to Halford...see what I mean?) Anyway, Owens does some truly frightening screaming on this record, and his lower range is really growly and--dare I say it?--masculine. At the moment I'm writing this, I'm listening again to \"Dead Meat,\" and the range Owens displays is tremendous: everything from a low, menacing growl to a high, strident metal scream. (You also have to love the guitar solos on this track, jumping from speaker to speaker.)\n\nBacking up a little bit, I'd also like to present the title track \"Jugulator\" as an example of excellent late 90s heavy metal. The atmosphere starts out with a bit of an industrial flavor, and opens up into some pounding, thrashy metal. (Once again, props to Scott Travis for the excellent drum work.) Try listening to \"Jugulator\" (the song) with a copy of the album cover art in front of you. The menacing ambience of the track matches that horrific monster on the cover beautifully.\n\n\"Burn in Hell\" was made into a video, which I will admit I haven't seen, but is a nice example of the range this incarnation of Priest was capable of. Sure, the title is a little corny, but there again, \"You've Got Another Thing Coming\" isn't exactly the least cliched song in heavy metal history. The nice thing with \"Burn in Hell\" is how it starts kind of quietly sinister, then builds into a raging screamfest as the song continues. And I hate to belabor the point, but anyone who says \"Ripper\" can't scream hasn't listened to this song, either. The guy's got some fierce rage in his voice that fits quite well with this incarnation of the band.\n\nOne more track that stands out is the final tune \"Cathedral Spires.\" The opening slow section is really beautifully written and performed, and when it kicks into the heavy section, it's a thundering success. Heavy, menacing, raging...this track is a good example of what Priest was capable of in this era, I think. For those who like a little harmony singing in their heavy metal (as I do), this song has a little something for everyone. At over nine minutes long, this is a battering assault on the listener, and a fine way to wrap up a Judas Priest album. \n\nAs I said above, it's not easy to approach this album in an unprejudiced fashion. Rob Halford is not the kind of lead singer who can leave a band without leaving a gaping hole behind. It happened with Iron Maiden when Bruce Dickinson left. And honestly, I think JP did a far better job of finding a replacement than Iron Maiden did. No, Tim \"Ripper\" Owens was not a Halford copy, but he was a fine lead singer in his own right. And the band certainly didn't give up their vitality when they made this record. Is it as classic as British Steel? No. Is it a good, solid heavy metal that is a treat to listen to? I think so.\n",
        "\nThat\u2019s right my metal brothers and sisters! That\u2019s what this monster of a band has kept on doing for more than 30 years now! And that\u2019s also the task the Metal Gods themselves (well, perhaps only in my mind) have bestowed upon me, by defending this kinda underrated album and its quality! So don\u2019t believe the naysayers, here I\u2019ll tell you why\u2026\n\nIn the first place, this was the reunion album the metal masses were craving for after Iron Maiden did their thing at the turn of the century. And the Judas guys knew this. They knew they had to come up with a killer album. So their approach to this was creating a record that encapsulates most of the elements of their long, influential and productive career. Maybe they did it for the fans, trying to please everybody, but I\u2019m convinced they did put a lot of true passion and worked hard to come up with something worthy of being labeled \u201cJudas Priest heavy metal\u201d. The result, in my opinion, is one of the strongest albums in their repertoire.\n\n\u201cJudas is Rising\u201d starts with a \u201cVictim of Changes\u201d like guitar intro. Then Scott Travis double bass start to pound and as soon as you ask for it, Rob\u2019s ever-powerful vocals enter the equation. That\u2019s right, I said \u201cpowerful\u201d, and though he\u2019s past his prime, the Metal God still delivers in an awe-inspiring way. Add a Priest signature guitar solo as only the masters Downing and Tipton can craft and you end up with an ass-kicking opener. I firmly believe that the blond-haired pair of guitarists is responsible for the most memorable guitar solos in metal. Well, they still have the magic, believe me.\n\nThe rest of the album follows in magnificent form, and since other reviewers have already written song per song descriptions I shall only point out the best tracks here, each of them representing a different Priest style. \n\n\u201cWorth Fighting For\u201d is the best of their hard-rocking numbers (the others being \u201cWheels ofFire\u201d and \u201cRevolution). While perhaps it lacks a cool solo, the chorus and structure of the song are really worth listening to. \n\nThe passionate \u201cAngel\u201d is the best calmed one here, and one of their all-time best ballads, high up there with \u201cBeyond the Realms of Death\u201d and \u201cDreamer Deceiver\u201d, with powerful lyrics performed by Rob. This one really is emotive when played live.\n\nFor those speed metal craving maniacs, here comes the \u201cHellrider\u201d, totally in for the kill, which kicks-off with a memorable fiery guitar intro, even better than the one in the opener, devastating top-class solos and Scott\u2019s trademark bursts of double bass. Images of raging red-hot metal beasts clashing come to my mind every time I listen to this one. While obviously this is no \u201cPainkiller\u201d it could easily fit into that album. That\u2019s my favorite song of the album.\n\nI cannot fail to mention the closer, and epic in the true sense of the word, \u201cLochness\u201d. Their equivalent to \u201cRime of the Ancient Mariner\u201d (I hope not to end up being crucified for that comparison) came a bit late in their career and it\u2019s something different of what the band usually have us accustomed to. But I think it\u2019s a nice experiment gone well, a doomy, memorable and menacing as the monster itself helluva song and a great way to end this album, slowly fading out just as we imagine Nessie submerging its dark hide into the pitch black waters of the famous scottish loch.\n\nThe only song here I think is a bit weak is the other ballad, \u201cEulogy\u201d, though I think the lyrics are rather cool, mentioning Priest songs of old (something which happens frequently in other songs of this album).\n\nAll in all, this album is a varied but excellent recollection of the different stages and styles the band has explored in their never-ending quest for metal. I even recommend this to any one not familiar with the band, since here they can witness the versatility and power of this titanic band, and taste the different flavors of Priest\u2019s metal. Sure it\u2019s no Painkiller, but to expect Pankiller II at this stage of their career is a rather foolish thing. I\u2019d say Angel of Retribution is more akin to Defenders of the Faith, each song memorable within it\u2019s own style. \n\nI think this masterpiece is the best 2005 metal album, one of the finest comeback albums ever, and a nice starting point for a Judas Priest newbie, though I strongly recommend it also to any avid Priest fan that hasn\u2019t listened to it yet. Get it now and embrace the faith!\n",
        "\nFollowing Stained Class, the evolution of Judas Priest displayed a gradual decrease concerning the brand of heavy metal they helped create and a rise in pop rock sensibilities to the degree that after Point Of Entry the next logical step would be to release an album sounding something akin to Loverboy or Foreigner material. Thankfully, the band took a step back, saw the mellower direction they were heading, and brought back the metal to an almost jarring but not quite complete degree. Still, the lack of enthusiasm for their previous release by their fanbase and a lack of commercial success turned out to be a godsend.\n\nFrom the first seconds of The Hellion, there was no doubt that this Judas Priest offering was a different beast than the hard rockin\u2019 boogie of Point Of Entry with its explosive dual guitar heroics channeling the album\u2019s cover art perfectly, a soaring iron eagle about to strike the listener. The bombast is aided by a production that brings the guitars clearly to the forefront where they belong, and the guitars themselves sound magnificent, sharp and gleaming but warm enough not to sound tinny whatsoever. Like two swords dripping fresh blood. It\u2019s a rush. \n\nWith an intro like that, expectations would be set sky high, and Electric Eye does not disappoint by any means. In fact I\u2019d say it\u2019s one of their strongest tracks in general with its fast pace, killer riffs, Rob\u2019s icy delivery and cool sci-fi lyrics. The drums and bass in this track, as well as the rest of the album, are serviceable in that they basically provide a base for the guitars to unleash their fireworks. An argument could be made that a more dynamic approach by the rhythm section could have electrified the songs to a higher level of intensity, but personally I can\u2019t say it really bothered me in the least, since my focus would still be on Rob\u2019s voice and the skillful guitar antics.\n\nThe reason why I stated earlier that the band hadn\u2019t completely shed the straight up rock & roll skin that had gradually grown over their steel frame is that there are still a few songs in this release that seemed designed for mainstream rock radio airplay, in which You\u2019ve Got Another Thing Comin\u2019 became a resounding success. But let\u2019s face it, it\u2019s a hell of a good hard rock tune with a punchy, ultra-catchy chorus and a mid-paced but driving pulse. Unfortunately other rockish numbers here don\u2019t fare nearly as well, such as the pop-rockish (Take These) Chains and the sluggish Pain And Pleasure. They recall their last album\u2019s style to the point where they seem odd nestled within an album containing a raging speed demon like the primal title track and the glorious Riding On The Wind, in which the guitar solos sound like two fighter jets in an intense aerial combat. Rob\u2019s vocals on those two tracks are particularly stellar, high pitched angry screaming while boasting amazing control and skill. His vocals actually save the last track, Devil\u2019s Child, from being a rock & roll disaster, giving the song a surprising edge with his barely controlled venom spitting.\n\nScreaming For Vengeance was definitely a transitional album that displays the band in the process of shaking off their recent excursion into mainstream rock and developing a stronger and much heavier sound that would be further enhanced in their next album, Defenders Of The Faith. It has some shaky moments, and yet contains some of the most essential slabs of metal in their catalogue, thus it\u2019s definitely worth getting as it certainly remains a prime showcase for what Judas Priest was all about in the 80s.\n",
        "\nWhen you say Judas Priest, your mind instantly travels through time and you name up classics like \u201cTyrant\u201d, \u201cBeyond the Realms of Death\u201d, \u201cMetal Gods\u201d, \u201cLove Bites\u201d or \u201cPainkiller\u201d. Without hesitation you think about Rob Halford\u2019s high-pitched vocals and the superb guitarduels between Glenn Tipton and KK Downing. But there\u2019s a darker side to this band and it came right up when Halford called it quits. As a result Tipton and Downing, both accustomed to writing good songs, took Halford-wannabe Tim Ripper Owens to replace the Metal God on vocals. Don\u2019t you want to know how that turned out? No you don\u2019t. I usually dig albums other people loath, but Jugulator just lacks creativity in every corner and sounds terribly uninspired. It\u2019s been seven years since previous album Painkiller, which everyone remembers as one of Priest\u2019s greatest. Whether Downing and Tipton wanted to create something in the same vein or something totally new is not clear. The music sounds like a parody of what Priest was before and I daresay the band just needed a reason to tour. And of course, there are enjoyable parts on this album, but most of it\u2019s pushed towards the end of the record or it\u2019s ruined by what follows.\n\nLet\u2019s begin with Halford\u2019s replacement Tim \u201cRipper\u201d Owens. Some people praise his vocal talents and his range, saying he resembles Rob Halford. Well, he tries very hard to resemble the man, but he does not really succeed. Halford could actually sing in the higher regions of his range, while Owens only screams and he doesn\u2019t even hit half the height Halford does. Not that it matters, but the man really is annoying to listen to. His screams sound fucked up, his lower voice sounds cheesy as hell and sometimes he just sounds like a barbarian that\u2019s about to attack a wild boar. Then there\u2019s the boring songwriting. There are riffs I made up the first year I picked up a guitar. The best example is the opening track \u201cJugulator\u201d. It begins with a nice machine-like rhythm (could make you think Priest is joining the industrial rise), but is quickly ruined by a cheese-evil theme and eventually bursts out into a three chord riff that is just too ridiculous for words. The lyrics on the song are so wannabe Halford, about freaky monsters and terribly beasts. But this is not convincing. The same formula of boring riffs and annoying vocals is used at tracks like \u201cDead Meat\u201d or \u201cDecapitate\u201d. It sounds just so unprofessional it\u2019s like a textbook \u201cHow to make my first metal song\u201d. Then there\u2019s \u201cDeath Row\u201d, which actually flows pretty well if you don\u2019t count the tiresome fragment at the beginning... that is, until you hear the chorus. Are we listening to a band playing (or trying to play) metal or is this a child\u2019s party and we\u2019re singing nice cozy songs?\n\nThen the positive side of the album... I\u2019ve been negative for far too long now. As I mentioned before there are some better songs near the end of the album with the exception of \u201cBlood Stained\u201d, which is number two. The said song is not really different from the others around it in terms of sound, riffage or structure, but the major difference is: it flows and stays cool \u2018til the end. This is also what makes \u201cAbductors\u201d and \u201cBullet Train\u201d more successful creations than crap like \u201cBurn in Hell\u201d or \u201cDead Meat\u201d. And if a song doesn\u2019t flow, it\u2019s not a good song. If it does, then you can be proud like on \u201cBullet Train\u201d, which is full of adrenaline and deserves to be written by Judas Priest, and \u201cAbductors\u201d, which begins evil and stays evil. And when you\u2019ve achieved that, you find you can also like Owens\u2019 vocals. Then there\u2019s \u201cCathedral Spires\u201d; the long song of the album. Peaking at a little over nine minutes, this song is a true epic consisting of three parts: the first part is a ballad, the second a rocker with an anthemic chorus and the third is a mesmerizing continuation of the anthem from part two. And when you\u2019re done listening to these tracks, you begin to wonder why they didn\u2019t bother to write more songs that actually sound good?\n\nIn short, Jugulator is a bad album with some positive surprises. This is Judas Priest being totally confused about what the hell they are, what they\u2019re supposed to do and what the hell metal is. Still, I would recommend the last three tracks to any Priest fan, since they are really good tracks. As for the overall album; avoid it. Don\u2019t be seduced by the cover.\n\nStrongest tracks: \u201cBullet Train\u201d and \u201cCathedral Spires\u201d.\nWeakest tracks: \u201cJugulator\u201d, \u201cDead Meat\u201d, \u201cDeath Row\u201d and the others minus \u201cBlood Stained\u201d and \u201cAbductors.\n\nhttp://thecryreviews.blogspot.com/\n",
        "\nYou can keep telling me something is black when it's really white until you're blue in the face; Unleashed in the East is nothing great. The performance on this album is pure vanilla though it does have some good spots in it. But I wanted a great live experience on the record and henceforth, I will be highly critical of it as just that or not that as it's supposed to be: a live recording. Rumor has it Unleashed in the East is a victim of studio changes i.e. overdubs outside the venue. Rumor? Ha. Yeah and rumor has it that Rob Halford would have a room for Doro before Joey DiMaio. Oh yeah and rumor also has it Tim Owens will forgo a vocal slot in another power metal band so he can work on getting his PGA tour card. No, that this album has been worked over in a studio after the fact is no rumor. It is so. Anybody who doesn't doubt the veracity of the fact has to do me a solid and rest their ear from track 3 on album 4 for a bit and step back for the truth. Do it! And do it now! And while the performance on this live album is better by most than better by me, I need nothing subliminal to convince me of the fact that Priest is sublimely awesome! I wish this really was as good as it's cover art. \n\nNote: This is the band's best album cover! When I think of Judas Priest, the front and back photos always pop delightfully to my mind. Back in the late 70's, Judas Priest was heavy metal back when heavy metal wasn't \"cool\" and the cover is still today just too damn awesome for those disco duck mainstream motherfuckers anyway. Rob Halford sporting that leather and police paraphernalia was my adolescent dream. Only he could make the glisten of his handcuffs outshine the Village People's Glenn Hughes' pair so that we would only notice that merkin on his face and Rob's crotch would get the deserving attention instead AND Rob was such a badass with singing ability that he could kick the Deep Purple singer Glenn Hughes' ass at the same time! \n\nNow that I showered rightful praise on the beautifully typical heavy metal-ness of Unleashed in the East, I must get back to being skeptical about the sound on here before I break into song and just say \"fuck it, this album rocks\" like so many others have when it just isn't the case all around. I will start by dropping these titles on you: Live After Death. Alive!. Made in Japan. On Stage. Live Evil. Live Undead. Those are a sampling of great live albums. Albums recorded live and more importantly, feel live. Unleashed in the East doesn't do that live part well as those titles did. That this album is not authentically live is not my complaint one bit. As a matter of fact, one of those examples I gave was recorded completely in a studio setting and passed off as live. Another was studio dubbed as this album was. But at least they sounded live. This record doesn't sound it. It sounds unconvincing. I want it to sell me that it's in concert even if it's knowingly otherwise. Ever heard Rob's 2001 solo release Live Insurrection? That, my friends, was a live album! Intense, dynamic with the crowd sounds in full force and in your face responding to the performance. When I hear a concert album, I want concert atmosphere! I don't care how small or how big the audience, it's got to feel in the flesh. \n\nExciter is one of the greatest songs to ever open a heavy metal album and being as awesome as it was on Stained Class, I expected it to do the same when kicking off this record but it went limp on the live front at 3:38 with that crowd rave. PUH-LEASE! Where did the engineer swipe that byte from? Cheap Trick? Those cheers were about as convincing as the crowd cheers on Tecmo Bowl for the Atari 7800 after Detroit scores on Dallas on the road. What is really confounding is that Priest was the sexiest sounding metal band of their day and that such audial duplicity was needed in the first place. When the band belts these songs out it should have every bit the authenticity of excitement as Madonna would get strutting down rapist row. Were Japanese metal audiences really that flaccid and nonchalant? No. There's no reason to turn down reception noise. Take some time and work it in properly into the optimal channels. Even if it was going to be manufactured crowd sounds, they could at least do it correctly. I wanted a true depiction of everything there. Stand by for disappointment is more like it. \n\nI wasn't too pleased with the soloing on Exciter either at least in comparison to the studio track. K.K's riffing is great but Tipton's soloing sounds synthetic (more blatantly obvious studio tinkering) and a pull off is missed. Running Wild then breaks on way too suddenly than I thought was needed. Tipton and Downing's chaotic twin attack solo on this song was pry the best emulation of a live arena setting. The song that has the most awkward mix and dub is with The Ripper. Rob's vocals sound lively but the echoing effect is overdone. Throughout the whole album, Ian Hill's bass tracks seemed unaltered as I noticed the output drifted quietly about the same channels the guitars were placed through. Victim of Changes is a song from Sad Wings of Destiny and it's a track played on this live recording which is a natural because that song even in its studio incarnation always sounded lively. Rob's ending wail at the tail end is of course screamed right as always but not as long as I've heard it on other concert performances. \n\nUnleashed in the East has gotten much praise. I like the actual performance by the band on it whether it is live or doctored to be live. I know many admire it just for the playing alone. But I don't think the band played uniquely enough on it to give it a pass as a live recording. I wish I could raise this album up to a higher score for it's cover but the musical content is what matters. 70's Priest is my favorite era of the band so it's disappointing that the live treatment heard on here is not a heavy metal great among the classics. We get the Green Manalishi with the Two Prong Crown, sure. But if you're looking for what I was looking for, you get the big green weenie. What a shame.\n",
        "\nAfter reviewing the Nightfall in Middle Earth album, I have no idea when compelled me to put on Judas Priest\u2019s Nostradamus. Perhaps it was a subconscious attempt at suicide due to an overdose of interludes and synthesized pompous epic metal. It was an album I don\u2019t think I\u2019d listened to more than a few times since I bought it, which to be honest was about 50% for the music and 50% for the free Priest ticket code inside. (Which I claimed the free lawn seat and then got a free better ticket from a guy from a radio station at the show. I got mid-pavilion seats on Rob Halford\u2019s dime.) I brought up how I enjoyed this album, and a friend asked how I could enjoy Nostradamus and yet be so indifferent, and at times so critical, towards Blind Guardian\u2019s so-called masterpiece.\n\nThe first thing I noticed was that there are 9 interludes and 14 real songs, a big difference towards the 11 interludes and 11 songs of Blind Guardian, and only of the interludes clock in under a minute and all feature instrumentals of some kind. A difference from many of the ones on Nightfall being under 30 seconds and many just being speech or sound effects. Are the interludes on here still rather pompous and unnecessary? Yes. But I feel like there was some real effort and energy put into them.\n\nNow, the synthesizers, choirs, and all of the epic sounding elements are very different for Priest, but I felt they were used in a very interesting way. They never truly drown out the guitars, except on some palm muted chug riffs, so I have no complaints about that. There are some great interesting solos, and there are many different and new (well, for Priest) ideas tried out in the writing department. Revelations features an interesting start-stop vocal pattern (I\u2026 See\u2026 All\u2026 Things\u2026), which I never expected to hear from these guys. And despite songs like Prophecy sounding like classic Judas Priest with synthesizer and even the song Nostradamus sounding almost like an epic-ified Painkiller, the boys try things unlike anything they\u2019ve ever attempted before. I don\u2019t know what I could describe War sounding like, perhaps something similar to what Manowar did on their Gods of War album, except if that album didn\u2019t suck. And on the song Death, we hear Priest attempt what could almost be doom metal. And while not exactly Black Sabbath, they do the style justice. It\u2019s a little overlong but very interesting. And other ideas just feel like a re-vamp of a classic style. I don\u2019t know what it is, but the song Alone brings to mind Priest\u2019s classic anthems such as United or Take on the World. It feels to me like the kind of song the crows would be singing the chorus to in a live environment. But maybe I\u2019m crazy.\n\nNow, I know the band has attempted ballads before, but I don\u2019t think I can remember them trying anything quite like Lost Love. It\u2019s VERY mellow. I can\u2019t think of something to compare it to, mostly because I tend not to listen to anything comparable to it. And yet, it\u2019s followed by Persecution, probably the heaviest song on Disc 1.\n\nAlso a lot of the album is mid-paced. Persecution and Nostradamus are really the only speedy rockers, Nostradamus, again, being almost Painkiller-esque after the initial buildup. It\u2019s really a great piece of fucking furious metal. Other than that it\u2019s almost all mid-paced or slower.\n\nBut for all their experimentation, do these new ideas work? That\u2019s what seems to cause the arguments over this album. Some people might tell you this album was a failure, and others may put it with Priest\u2019s masterpieces. If the idea of Judas Priest playing epic, sometimes longer songs, with synthesized orchestra and choirs, to both classic sounding metal and other new experiments like doom metal, you might want to go back and put on Painkiller or Sad Wings of Destiny and just forget about this. On the other hand, if you\u2019ve played all of your Priest albums too much, and Stained Class is starting to sound old, you might want to give it a shot. However, I do not recommend this for someone new to Priest, as it\u2019s not the best representation of their style. On the other hand, if you\u2019re new to Judas Priest, and you\u2019re on a metal site, you might just be in the wrong place.\n\nThat being said, I personally enjoyed the experimentation Priest attempted. I felt that many of the ideas worked out well, but that while my favorite song is on Disc 2, and Disc 2 is still solid, Disc 1 is the better overall Disc. I\u2019m glad to hear new ideas like this. Sometimes, even if a new idea is a failure, it\u2019s better than rehashing the same ideas a million times. Someone should mention that to AC/DC. I wouldn\u2019t consider this a failure, and I\u2019d recommend this to a Priest fan, but urge them to have an open mind about it.\n",
        "\nThis compilation was my first encounter with Judas Priest. My friend had lent me a copy to listen to. At the time I was unaware that it was a compilation of Judas Priest\u2019s work from 1977 \u2013 1984. So as I listened to the album I was extremely impressed. I remember thinking \u201cDamn! Every song on here sounds like single material!\u201d Well, what do you know, I was right. Even today this compilation never ceases to impress me. Especially compared to the three best of / compilations released by Judas Priest in three years (two of which were in the same year). \n\nNow of course, almost every compilation of singles from any band would naturally get good feedback, as the best songs the band has produced are on that album. The only problem is that Judas Priest has released a total of 20 best of / compilations! They have been around for 40 years now, and with 20 compilations they would have released a compilation every other year! They have more than obviously been exploited by their record company. With 20 compilations, each one basically makes the previous releases redundant. Obviously, there are going to be several songs featured on every compilation so buying only one compilation would be necessary. This is that one compilation that is worth buying. \n\nThis album features songs from Judas Priest\u2019s glory days, taking songs from the classic albums British Steel and Defender\u2019s of Faith. Along with several other very popular albums that were acclaimed by both fans and critics alike. Also, unlike like many Judas Priest compilations, this one does not feature any songs from album Turbo, which is said to be the worst in Judas Priest\u2019s entire career. So we have a great compilation with nothing but songs that are truly the best of Judas Priest, and not just 12 songs pulled out someone\u2019s ass and put onto a CD. \n\nWhile each song on this compilation is superb, it can be compared to a 400 meter sprint. The album starts out strong and holds it for a long time until about mid-way through. At this point the album is still good but not as strong as it started out. Then on the final stretch of the album it picks up speed again and delivers a strong finish. Another good thing about this compilation is the fact that all of the songs (minus Loves Bites, and Some Heads are Gonna Roll) all have the same feeling as the rest of the songs on the album. They have those positive uplifting riffs that fill you with joy, hope, and energy. These songs are definitely perfect for revving up a Harley and driving off into the sunset.\n\nPersonally, the best part of this compilation is the fact that they are taken from many different albums instead of about three, which a lot of bands tend to do. This is especially good because you will be more likely to get songs from albums you don\u2019t own on this compilation as the odds are less because of their wider range of albums featured on the compilation. Unless of course you own the entire Judas Priest discography, but then why would you even buy a best of \u2013 album? Because like I said, it does feature songs from classic Judas Priest albums, but also from underrated Judas Priest albums as well, which is what makes for a great compilation album.\n\nSo this is great for a veteran Judas Priest listener as it features songs from the earliest of Judas Priest\u2019s releases, but it is also perfect for someone who is just getting into Judas Priest because of the wide variety of albums featured on the compilation. What makes this release even better for new-comers is the fact that you can get it for $5 on ebay very easily. I bought my copy on there a few years back for under $5, and Prisoners of Pain is still that price on ebay, so definitely a great buy.\n",
        "\n\"Sad Wings Of Destiny\" is definitely my favorite Judas Priest album, and it is also considered one of the best Judas Priest albums. But what makes it a classic like \"British Steel\"? This is where Judas Priest found their sound. They hadn't quite discovered themselves yet on \"Rocka Rolla\" but here on this record we have the Judas Priest that we all know and love. \n\nThe production definitely makes this record seem like a product of its time, but to me that is a good thing. It sounds like it was recorded in 1976, and rightfully so. The music is heavy and sinister much like Black Sabbath at the time, but the riffage is different and it is generally a bit faster than Black Sabbath. At times this even sounds like early 70's Rush, but a bit more metallic. The music is definitely blues based, which is the case with most early metal. Rob Halford has just as much vocal range here as he does on any other Judas Priest record. The guitar now has a thick sound that wasn't present on the first album. There is also a more powerful rhythm section now. This is a quite different Judas Priest than we had on \"Rocka Rolla\". \n\nThis album is full of great metal. There are a couple of faster songs on here, such as one of my personal favorites \"Tyrant\", which appears to be war oriented. \"Ripper\" is the other fast song on here, it's also very catchy and has some insane high notes provided by Rob Halford. Some of the songs are mid paced. Such as the very 70's sounding \"Genocide\", and \"Deceiver\". There is also my other personal favorite \"Victim Of Changes\", which is considered one of the albums highlights. My favorite part of the song is the trippy part near the end of the song, it's very melodic and very unusual for Judas Priest. \"Island Of Domination\" is also a very 70's sounding mid paced song, but later on it gets very slow and bluesy, it sounds like a heavier AC/DC. There are also a few non metal songs here too. \"Prelude\" is the opener of the album, it is an instrumental with drums and a piano. \"Epitaph\" is a choir like piano ballad, very out of place on this record. \"Dreamer Deceiver\" is another ballad but is closer to Judas Priest's style of music. It sounds pretty hippy like, but it is much more guitar based than \"Epitaph\".\n\nI think that this is a great metal album worthy of any metal collection. However, I wouldn't recommend this album to anyone who is only familiar with albums like \"British Steel\" or \"Painkiller\" because some might find this too dated. I thought the same thing when I got this album, but now I think that it rules. Now all of you metalheads who love 70's metal should respect your metal gods and purchase this album!\n",
        "\nIs this the greatest thing ever or what? Not only does it have 2 of the best Judas Priest songs known to man, god, nature, bhudda, and everyone else in between but the other one (Exciter) is a live version and good god almighty is the live one better than the studio one or WHAT? \n\nThe main song is generally accused of being one of Priest's more mainstream moments but with those uplifting in your face lyrics and built-for-the-road feel, does it really matter? Oh, and those crunchy as fuck riffs, those infectious leads and of course Halford's vocals. I actually prefer 80s Halford because listening to his 'tougher' voice here actually makes him sound more like a man as compared to his kinda faggy voice in those 70s records. The song has a pretty basic structure, simple riffs, and a catchy chorus with the vocals perfectly intertwined with the guitar work - built for arena crowds, basically. And in that regard, Priest pretty much destroys Motley Crue, Scorpions, and all those other bands who built their sound in order to cater for bigger audiences. This isn't the British Priest of old, it has a very Amrican-ized sound - kinda mainstream but a lot more powerful. And those lyrics! This is the type of song you hear in your angsty moments and instead of wallowing in self pity it kicks you in the fucking balls and gets your ass up and running!\n\nExciter, does it need any introduction? Classic, classic speed metal song. Apparently this version is from their Japan live album according to the blog I downloaded this single from but I wouldn't know. It's packed with energy and the guitar tone is fucking vicious (compared to what I've come to expect from Priest) and serves as a nice contrast to the upbeat fistpumping of the earlier track. This one will bang your head faster than that shitty (okay, so it was good, very good!) Quiet Riot song.\n\nBut yeah, pretty much the best single ever.\n",
        "\nThough they had already delivered numerous masterworks in British Steel, Screaming for Vengeance and Defenders of the Faith, it is Painkiller which stands the test of time as both the de facto Judas Priest experience and their heaviest effort to date. Which begs the question, why in the Nine Hells did they not continue in this direction? I realize they had the falling out, and the 'Ripper' Owens period (my head still aches), but even the two reunion albums so far have been garbage by comparison.\n\nPainkiller was like the culmination of an architectural masterpiece: the foundation had been laid, brick by brick, carefully for years; the riffs a geometry of melodic aggression; each of Halford's vocal lines delirious with ham-fisted metal imagery and stark passion. The title track EXPLODES, the heaviest fucking anthem this band has ever manifested. Halford soars forth like an escaped asylum inmate who wants to end your pain AND YOUR LIFE. Who cares that the song is about some figurative alien metalloid angel of salvation (Jesus with a flying motorcycle and double chainsaw action). That's just bonus.\n\n'Through boiling clouds of thunder\nBlasting bolts of steel\nEvils going under deadly wheels'\n\nRide on! Right on! It doesn't hurt that the rest of the album is equally solid support for this blazing avatar. \"Hell Patrol\" is a melodic anthem which celebrates the machinery of final judgement. \"All Guns Blazing\" is just...well, let's just say when I saw the band on their Painkiller world tour back in the day, Rob Halford dedicated it to Saddam Hussein.\n\n\"Leather Rebel\" opens with a whirlwind of melodic speed picking before glorious verse and chorus, a sweet and pure tribute to the tr00 metal elite. \"Metal Meltdown\" ranges from shredding to thrashing, with it's ominous and silly chorus. Fuck, just how many songs on this album have the word 'lazer' in them? Okay, only two, but that's two more lazer references than YOUR favorite metal album! En garde! \"Night Crawler\" is a creepy horror anthem and yet another hybrid of power and thrash metal with poppy melodic riffing similar to \"Painkiller\". \"Between the Hammer & the Anvil\" starts with some slower, doomy chords which are revisited later in the track with an actually beating of such solid objects together. \"A Touch of Evil\" is a seductive tune with silly synthesizers, it's similar to the stuff Ozzy was doing at this period, and a little Zeppelin influence. I love it, especially that chorus:\n\n'In the night, come to me\nYou know I want your Touch of Evil\nIn the night, please set me free\nI can't resist a Touch of Evil'\n\nTouch me, Rob! Oh, touch me! Too much information. The majestic instrumental \"Battle Hymn\" sets up the album's final number \"One Shot at Glory\", which is pure Priest and again features that amazing, unforgettable chorus.\n\nGlen Tipton and K.K. Downing once again proved their worth as the genre's pre-eminent straightforward axe duo. Tasteful leads when required, but never over-wanking or attempting to upstage the vocal and verse. Ian Hill has never been an amazing bass player, and here he just continues to follow along with the guitars. Scott Travis delivers a pretty stellar drum performance, especially the memorable fills which open the title track. The lyrics are hokey but loveable throughout; they function perfectly with the pseudo-metallian concept. The album has been remastered but the original still sounds fantastic.\n\nTo describe the influence of this band (and album) is beyond the parameters of a mere mortal's humble review, but I can assure you, it's worth the hype. You didn't need me to remind you, of course, because you already have and love this. Or so the voices told me. Now I just need to forget about what the slew of atrocities the band issued post-Painkiller, so I can sleep.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nThough many would argue Judas Priest had begun to stagnate in the 80s, content with party rock albums like Turbo or Ram It Down, there was a day when they were far ahead of the pack. With Sin After Sin, the band's 3rd album, they were already crafting the caliber of hard rocking chorus parts that many bands today (32 years after the fact) still cannot mimic. Certainly, the tinny popping drum cadence lodges this record firmly in the 70s, but it is a beast while nary a weak track to be found, and one of the band's greatest albums, which I look back upon with only fondness.\n\nWhen you open a record with the unforgettable \"Sinner\" and Rob's clinically excellent, surgical vocals, you cannot fail. The Joan Baez cover \"Diamonds and Rust\" is melodic and soothing, each line delivered with clarity, the guitars and bass plodding gently below as Halford delivers you into the sky. \"Starbreaker\" delivers AGAIN, with beautiful vocals and a primal, shuffling beat, plus the immortal hand clap! Even when Sin After Sin steers into balladic territory with the \"Last Rose of Summer\", it does not falter, though I'd say it's one of the least interesting tracks on the album. \"Let Us Prey\", \"Call for the Priest/Raw Deal\" and the amazing \"Dissident Aggressor\" truly round out the album and bestow it unto history as one of the best Priest would ever record, a worthy prototype and inspiration to so many bands to come.\n\nThe production was top notch, the lyrics well written and even 'hip' (for Priest), and the songs were carefully balanced and crafted to provide an entertaining experience. This was when the concept of the 'album' reigned supreme. Whether you listen to this on crackling vinyl to wax nostalgic about your not so innocent youth, or discovering it for the first time, you can begin to understand why this band made such a huge splash, a splash that has yet to dissipate.\n\nHighlights: almost every song on this fucking record, now run along!\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nIn 1991 an atomic bomb exploded in the metal world shattering the dreams of many fans. The mythical singer of Judas Priest, Rob Halford, a man who influenced so many other singers, announced that he was going to leave the band! He wanted to do something personal and either he couldn\u2019t manage to give the best of himself in two fronts either he was not satisfied with Priest\u2019s music direction. By the way, it turned out to be a completely wrong move. For a time the band thought of splitting-up. Finally they decided that they had the strength to move on. After many auditions his replacement was found in the face of a not so well known singer, Tim \u201cRipper\u201d Owens and only seven years later they returned with their new album, Jugulator.\n\nAt first I was not so sure on whether he could stand up to his role. Yet he proved me wrong. Owens is a good apprentice of Halford both in singing and performing. That part went well. He may not possess the extreme high notes in which Halford had got us used to; still he stands decently giving the best of him. But what about the album itself? Was it worth the expectation after years of silence? Well\u2026\n\nIn terms of music, Jugulator is kind of strange to me. They follow paths they had never attempted to tread in the past. It is one of the toughest things they have recorded with heavy, sharp guitars and very heavy drums but the thing is that many themes bring in mind bands so different from them like Machine Head or Pantera. I am not the only one to think of this. The straight-in your face metal riffs have become more complex and it make it somehow difficult to believe that this is a Judas Priest album. Of course I didn\u2019t expect it to be Painkiller Pt.2 but something quite similar.\n\nThere are certain songs that I really liked too much like Dead Meat with the very heavy solid guitars and bombastic drums. Owens screams and yells with much aggression and harshness and he is clearly a pleasant surprise. Another track that stands out is Burn in Hell. An atmospheric intro is followed by strong drumming by Scott Travis who is proved to be an excellent choice for Priest. The guitar riffs are heavy as fuck making the song a blaster that blows you to pieces.\n\nAnother favorite of mine is Death Row. The once again razor sharp guitars stick to your head and the chorus is so inspired that I found myself singing along many times. Of course Tipton and Downing remain in great form, composing amazing solos and guitar parts for most of the time. The bass as always is firm and steady though a bit in the background.\n\nBut who would expect them to be the only three fantastic songs in a total of ten in a Judas Priest album? The band that gave us so many heavy metal hymns in the past seems to have run out of ideas. The majority of the tracks are less interesting to the point of becoming boring. Such is the nine-minute last song, Cathedral Spires. It sounds endless every time I listen to it and to be honest, it challenges me to push the STOP button before it ends.\n\nThank God there is no balladry stuff here like they have done on their next albums and that\u2019s a good thing. Yet all the remaining songs are pretty mediocre and they have nothing special to contribute. Decapitate, Jugulator and Brain Dead are pure fillers. They are all heavy but somewhere on the way the cheese prevails. Their heavy breaks are not enough to save the day.\n\nIn overall, Jugulator is an album most likely to confuse you. If you wish to see a change and development in Priest\u2019s music, this one is for you. But if you want to remember them in the way they used to be then you must surely listen to it before investing your money or hopes of a glorious comeback.\n",
        "\nJudas Priest's newest live album consists of songs recorded live when Rob came back to the group in 2003 all the way up to the Metal Masters tour just last year. What makes this live album stick out is more obscure and lesser know songs being featured on here rather than the hits like \"You've Got Another Thing Comin'\", \"Breaking the Law,\" and \"Living After Midnight.\"\n\nThe great aspect of this live recording is all the songs are injected with energy and extra added heaviness which spice up the crunch and power of the guitars. Songs from newer albums like \"Angel of Retribution\" and \"Nostradamus\" are on here and are all performed brilliantly. \"Prophecy\" is a track to check out as Rob Halford nails it perfectly in the live setting. It captures the feeling given off by the studio output. The other \"Nostradamus\" track is \"Death\" and it does a good job of setting the dark mood onto the audience. \"Judas Rising\" and \"Hellrider\" were both strong tracks from \"Angel of Retribution\" and were good choices to include on here.\n\nFinally, a live version of \"Painkiller\" is available and it does not disappoint. Halford does a magnificent job of singing such a difficult song and of course K.K Downing and Glenn Tipton perform the back and forth soloing brilliantly. \"Beyond the Realms of Death\" was also an excellent choice to include on here and it sets the dark and evil atmosphere and delivers from start to finish. The minute the opening guitar part starts, chills are sent up your spine.\n\nOther songs included are \"Riding on the Wind\", \"Dissident Aggressor\", and \"Between the Hammer and the Anvil.\" It is nice to hear the extra energy and excitement live and Halford delivers a more rough and tumble \"Dissident Aggressor\" which makes the song thrashier. An interesting song choice is \"Eat Me Alive\" from \"Defenders of the Faith.\" The live version sounds more sinister and is much more aggressive than its studio counterpart. \"Riding on the Wind\" starts with Halford playing with the crowd for a little and then roars and blasts as Halford's rougher tone gives the song an extra edge not heard before. Even 20 some odd years later from when these songs were released, the band makes them sound fresh and amped up.\n\nAny fan of Priest would do themselves good buying this album. It is definitly worth repeated listens and kicks a lot of ass. From top to bottom, the whole band performs flawless. They show that after all these years that they still got it and it rivals \"Flight 666\" which was released by Iron Maiden earlier this year as well.\n",
        "\nI clearly remember the day when I was a freshman in high school back in 1983 when a buddy of mine walked up and handed me this album, stating he wasn't into it anymore, and since I was discovering heavy metal, did I want it? Sure, I said, took it home and threw it on the turntable. That moment was a life-defining moment for me. I was exposed to one of the all time great British metal legends, and this is easily my second favorite album of theirs, one of my yardsticks for metal period. I say second favorite (and second best in the review title) since \"Painkiller\" is my favorite and their personal best in my eyes.\n\nThe Mighty Halford was in his prime and it shows on this album with his attitude-laden vocals ringing forth like the clarion call of the war trumpets of Hell, with some of his most impressive screaming and wailing ever recorded on display here. Even more subdued songs like \"Bloodstone\" feature plenty of attitude and spirit in his delivery, and he more than proves his status as one of the all time great metal gods id more than merited. If I were a singer, he'd be a huge influence on me, for sure.\n\nGlenn Tipton and K.K. Downing also really came into their own as guitar monsters on this album, their biting, soaring, screaming, moaning leads blazing forth with fantastic tone--Tom Allom's big, booming production set a standard for the time, I think--and burning passion. Their blues influence insured that plenty of feeling was included as well amongst the aggression, and it set them apart. Glenn's fluid shredding and K.K.'s more savage style were good counterparts to each other and made their guitar duels all the more furious. Some of the best playing is on the title track, Glenn's moody and emotional intro to \"Bloodstone\" (total blues with chilling majesty), \"Electric Eye\" with its dramatic intro (\"The Hellion\") and galvanizing opening riff that any banger worthy of the name will jump up screaming in delight over, and also \"Riding on the Wind\" with its searing whammy bar vibrato and diving. Simply delicious! Ian Hill and Dave Holland make for a formidable rhythm tank thundering away for the two guitar gods to go wild over, rock solid and un-fuck-with-able. Hill is not a technical wizard on the bass front, but he is just what the band needs, a steady and reliable player who lays it down and makes certain things stay in place.\n\nSongs, so many good ones on here! The only ones I really don't care for as much as the others are album closer \"Devil's Child\", as while it is good it's not as good as the rest of the album--it doesn't seem to really fit with its overtly AC/DC influenced riff in the beginning, and \"Pain and Pleasure\", which drags in comparison to the rest of the album. Otherwise, this album's selection of songs is amazing, positively incredible in its scope of powerful riffing and fantastic guitar and vocal wizardry; the title track alone will get your heart pounding and your blood pumping and your face turning beet red as you try and fail to hit that insane high note Halford hits and holds at the end as the song crashes into concert staple \"You've Got Another Thing Comin'\", which is deservedly a classic with its lyrics extolling living your life for yourself and not letting others tell you what to do--how metal is that? In a very positive manner, too, something you don't normally hear.\n\nIn short, anyone who considers themselves a headbanger at all must own this album or they are unworthy. It's that simple. It was one of my first really serious metal albums and still in my vinyl archives to this day.\n",
        "\nDespite being something of a vocalist myself, I never get too caught up in the drama of a certain lead singer's departure. Many of my favorite bands such as Black Sabbath and Iced Earth have gone through many different singers over the years yet continued to release quality material and I've always held to the belief that any line-up can release something successful as long as there is still a strong songwriting team at its core. But what happens when a great change completely transforms a band's sound and leads to a completely different sounding outfit; should they continue under the old name or adopt a new moniker? That is the question that is posed with the release of 1997's downtuned mindfuck \"Jugulator,\" the very first Priest album to feature Tim \"Ripper\" Owens on lead vocals.\n\nAs much as I hate to take away credit from the other Priest members of the past and present (especially band founder and original vocalist Al Atkins), I don't think it's really Judas Priest anymore when you take away Rob Halford's influential voice and solid lyrics. That's certainly not said to insult Owens either for he is one of the most powerful vocalists in modern metal and went on to do great things in future projects. I just feel that the absence of the Metal God had somehow resulted with the creation of a completely different sounding band...\n\nFor one thing, the album's style and musical content sounds nothing like the Priest of old. There are absolutely no references to the \"classic\" 80's era and the style of 1990's \"Painkiller\" is only felt at a minimum on faster tracks such as the Grammy nominated \"Bullet Train\" and the somewhat robotic title track. Even then, the speeds never even come close to approaching those of anything on that album. Instead we are presented with some kind of hybrid that combines Slayer, Pantera, Alice in Chains, and Metallica with a guy who can shriek like Halford here and there...\n\nAs expected with this combination in mind, most of the songs on this album tend to revolve around heavy downtuned riffs and groovy mid-tempo song structures with a few darker touches here and there. \"Blood Stained\" and \"Death Row\" are probably the strongest tracks of this style with their muddy riffs, muscular drumming, and solid hooks (especially on the latter). Other tracks such as \"Burn In Hell\" and \"Cathedral Spires\" also have their mid-tempo moments, but the former is made memorable by an infectiously building structure and the latter is an apocalyptic epic that even the haters of this album can enjoy.\n\nAside from the drastic musical changes rubbing some listeners rubbing the wrong way, this album's biggest flaw lies in its lyrics. Just as Halford did with Fight, the band seems to go for a much darker outlook and more socially conscious themes. The album's topics range from the state of the world (\"Blood Stained\"), execution (\"Dead Meat,\" \"Death Row,\" and \"Decapitate\"), to the end of said world (\"Cathedral Spires\"). Unfortunately, Priest failed where Fight had succeeded and come off as primitive rather than clever...\n\nAll in all, I can say that album makes for a pretty enjoyable listen for any open-minded music fans out there. Of course, I still think Priest should've changed their name to fit this album's style. Hell, Jugulator sounds like it would've been a good name for the band as well as the album. Kinda like how Winters Bane's first two albums after Owens' departure were released under the Kill Procedure moniker...\n\nPros:\n1) Heavy riffs, hard-hitting drums, and excellently delivered vocals\n2) The songs themselves are pretty enjoyable for the most part\n3) Good variety of styles\n\nCons:\n1) Primitive lyrics\n2) Drastic change of style may turn off some fans\n3) \"Abductors\" and \"Brain Dead\" fall short of the other songs' quality\n\nMy Current Favorites:\n\"Blood Stained,\" \"Death Row,\" \"Burn In Hell,\" \"Bullet Train,\" and \"Cathedral Spires\"\n",
        "\nWhen a band changes an important (i.e. non-bassist and non-drummer) member of its band, and people dislike the new sound, it is often blamed on the vocalist. People who hated The X Factor often blamed Blaze Bailey, people who hated Falling Into Infinity often blamed Derek Sherinian and people who hate Jugulator often blame Tim Owens.\n\nBut the vocals aren't a problem here. Tim Owens is a competent vocalist \u2013 he just doesn't get used as he should. The problem is that it's just so dull.\n\nThe majority of the riffs on this album have no memorable quality about them at all. They're not horrible, they're just so bland and mediocre. The band also down-tuned for this album and, while this isn't necessarily a bad thing in and of itself, it brings with it the implication that the band down-tuned and started playing these mid-tempo groove based riffs in an attempt to \u201cmodernize\u201d the band's sound.\n\nA specific example of dull riffs would be the song Brain Dead (a title that describes how I feel when listening to the song). The verse riff is just a power chord, with a typical 'Slayer at 90bpm' riff every 4 bars. Before the chorus, the riff changes to a purely power chord based riff, with distorted guitar harmonics over it. The guitar harmonics are there because the song is about someone who is on life support, but it doesn't help with the comparisons to numetal because it just reminds me of Machine Head.\n\nThe leads of K. K. Downing and Glenn Tipton sound dull and uninspired, and specifically sound like the work of Hanneman and King.\n\nMost of the songs begin with either a clean passage, or some sound effects and spoken words, or a clean passage underneath some sound effects and spoken words. These range from the mildly annoying (Brain Dead opening with the sound of a car crash, followed by police car sirens rushing to the scene), to the truly cringe-worthy (Death Row opening with a conversation between a prisoner, evidently on death row, and a gruff security guard who says without a word of irony \u201cSorry, son. Commit a crime \u2013 pay the price,\u201d later following it up with \u201cDead man walking.\u201d). I expect sound effects and samples in every other song from some bands, but I can't help but get the feeling that the band didn't think that their audience would understand Tipton's deep lyrics unless they included all of these annoying sound effects and samples to show them what the songs were about.\n\n\u201cDeath Row? Hm. I wonder if this song's about Glenn's feelings on Accept's 1994 album. Or a song about Dr. Dre's former record label. ...oh, no. What a buffoon I am. It's about someone who has been sentenced to death, and whose warden thinks that he is Kurt Russell\u201d\n\nLyrics have never been the band's strong point, but these are some of the worst I've ever heard. If you look at the song titles list and think \u201cman, those are some infantile song-titles,\u201d then the lyrics will make you either wince in agony or howl with unstoppable laughter.\n\nBut the thing that bothers me most about this album is that there are some nuggets in here that are good, and a couple that are really great. Once you get past the awful intro, Death Row is fun and has a catchy chorus. The song that actually annoys me the most is Bullet Train, because after listening to the intro to Demanufacture by Fear Factory, and getting through some awful lyrics, the pre-chorus is actually catchy as fuck, the chorus is not too bad, then it goes back to shit.\n\nAnd then there's Cathedral Spires. And I'm not sure if it's because by this point I've listened to some really woeful stuff, but I have to say that I really, really enjoy this song. It begins with a clean intro, but unlike the rest of the album, it begins with a clean intro that isn't terrible, and Tim Owens actually gets to show off what he can do with his voice. The verses aren't great, but the chorus is without a doubt the catchiest, most fun and most memorable thing about the entire album \u2013 it is huge, epic, with twin guitar melodies, clean guitar parts, and layered vocals. Cathedral Spires almost makes me stop thinking about the two pints of lager I could have bought with the \u00a34.99 I spent on this album, though I can't help but wonder what Glenn Tipton really meant with the lyrics \u201cOh! We're so tired,\u201d and \u201cTime that we retire.\u201d\n\nThis album sounds like a mid-life crisis. Tipton and Downing realising that the young kids don't listen to (or commit suicide) to their music any more, and trying to recapture the ears of the youth again, with mostly disastrous moments. If you're a completist who just has to have every studio album that Priest released (like me), then I'm not going to stop you from buying this album. If you want typical Priest fare you're not going to get it, but you could probably buy Cathedral Spires as an mp3 on Amazon or iTunes or something. It's not all bad, but listening to it for the few good moments there are is a bit like wading through shit trying to find peanuts. You'll probably find some, but afterwords you'll just wish that you'd bought a bag of peanuts.\n",
        "\n\"Before the Dawn\" is the long-forgotten ballad off Killing Machine. It\u2019s strange nobody seems to know this one; its sharp contrast with the rest of the album seems to me like it would cause people to remember it. Alas, this isn\u2019t so, and the song has unfairly dropped under the horizon.\n\nWhat is immediately noticeable is the lack of drums. It\u2019s not often Priest scraps the drums (actually, I don\u2019t recall any other such songs) and so this is a unique song in itself. \u201cBefore the Dawn\u201d also makes use of soulful acoustic guitar that mostly replaces the usual electric fare used on similar songs like \u201cBeyond the Realms of Death,\u201d though a nice electric brooder of a solo permeates through the darkness. The bass is nothing to write home about, but it wouldn\u2019t be the same song if Ian Hill hadn\u2019t contributed his part.\n\nOf special impressiveness are Halford\u2019s vocals. Again comparable to \u201cBeyond the Realms of Death,\u201d he employs a sad, mournful moan throughout the song. The way he sings the title is absolutely spectacular. The lyrics remind of \u201cHere Come the Tears\u201d and fit well in the song \u2013 as usual, great songwriting in the lyric aspect. Overall, this is one of Priest\u2019s late \u201870s gems that unjustly slipped under the radar.\n\nSide B contains the more upbeat \u201cRock Forever.\u201d Incredibly funky like most of the album, the song begs the listener to sing along. But that just happens to be near impossible, as Halford shines with his inimitable falsetto and awesome grunts. The bass is very noticeable here, and this time contributes a large amount to the song\u2019s backbone. The main riff is gold and perfect for such a great Priest rocker.\n\nKilling Machine was definitely Priest\u2019s weakest \u201870s effort, but considering the grand majesty that era represents for the band, that just means it isn\u2019t quite as awesome. These two songs are some of the better off the album, just behind the better-known \u201cGreen Manalishi\u201d and \u201cDelivering the Goods.\u201d Priest fans, I beg of you, overlook this no longer.\n",
        "\nFrom the opening riffs of \"Sinner,\" you know you are in for a hell of a ride on this classic Judas Priest album. The dual guitar attack of Tipton and Downing is in full gear from the get go, and Halford's vocals have a great edge to them. Then the screams of \"Sinner!\" combine with the blistering guitar solos, and we are rolling. \nI have to admit, when I saw Joan Baez's name on the credits for \"Diamonds and Rust,\" I thought, \"Waitaminit, this is a metal album, right?\" But this track is superb. Baez's lyrics and melodies fit the rhythmic drive of Priest's metal beautifully, and Rob Halford has rarely sounded better. \n\nHats off to Roger Glover's excellent production skills. This album sounds so clear and powerful througout, it's amazing to consider that this was recorded in 1977. Glover's ear is put to good use, and he brings out the best in the band throughout the album. I've always admired his abilities in Deep Purple, both as bass player and producer, and this product just increases my admiration.\n\nI think the greatest surprise for me on the record is the laid back grooviness of \"Last Rose of Summer.\" It's definitely not the kind of sound one generally associates with the legendary metal brashness of this band, but it's really a nice track. I think it's no shame when a metal band can lay it back, and the playing and singing on this track show a tremendous sensitivity. Anyway, heavy metal was just in its young years in these days, and a band like Judas Priest could afford to explore their soft and hard sides, as they do to great effect on this album.\n\nI have read reviews of Sin After Sin that speak of Queen's influence, and I definitely heard that influence on the opening of \" Let Us Prey/ Call for the Priest.\" In fact, as I listened to this bit, I found myself thinking of Queen's early track \"Great King Rat.\" It's not the same style, exactly, but there are similarities in the overall sound of production: the layers of guitars, the upbeat drum pattern, and even Halford's vocal is reminiscent of Freddie Mercury. Fun track...\n\nAlthough Judas Priest had not yet ascended to the prominence they would attain in the eighties, this album definitely laid the foundation for what they would later achieve. I'm not even sure they were strictly a heavy metal band at this point in their development, but regardless, this album is a hell of a good time, and is a great example of early heavy metal style. From beginning to end, it's a rock and roll treat.\n",
        "\nJudas Priest \u2013 Deceiver\n\nAnother great \u2018Priest single with two strong numbers. I fucking love the artwork which is of course a slight development of the full-length artwork for \u2018Sad Wings\u2019 \u2013 classic heavy metal artwork. Anyway, the early Priest sound on here is great, if a little more simplistic than much of their later stuff.\n\n\u2018Deciever\u2019 itself is a strong number that starts off with a cool simplistic riff that I really enjoy. Anyway, the gallopy kinda quality that comes out with the three guitars is really neat, and I like the prominence of bass that\u2019s evident in this track \u2013 particularly that verse riff. This cut is a very guitar driven song with incredible soaring vocals by the always impressive Rob. The acoustic twin guitar stuff at the end is memorable, and sounds great through headphones - Solid number.\n\n\u2018The Ripper\u2019 is a phenomenal track that I\u2019ve always had a proclivity for. The subject matter is tackled excellently by Rob, who crafts out some awesome lyrics in this original approach to a (contemporarily) popular song subject. I f**king love what he does with the lyrics, for example \u2013 \u201cexcept for the ripper \u2013 or if you like Jack The Knife\u201d \u2013 f**king brilliant. Theres plenty of other little devices that work to create a truly memorable number \u2013 such as the creepy, sinister high-pitched guitar squeals at the start, and the section with the vocal \u201cyou\u2019re in for a shock\u201d \u201caaaaaaaaaaaah\u201d \u2013iv\u2019e always loved that bit. This track is an amazing symphony, with great things going on throughout that makes for an absolute thrill to listen to \u2013 particularly when walking past graveyards on cold, wet winter nights.\n\nBoth songs thoroughly enjoyable and excellent (no big surprise \u2013 it\u2019s \u2018Priest after all). I like the packaging of these two numbers together feeling it was a good choice. Both of these ones are pretty dark, with \u2018The Ripper\u2019 clearly dealing with some nasty subject matter. I guess I prefer the latter as a favourite, perhaps due to the subject matter and excellent vocal devices I mentioned earlier. Get it.\n",
        "\nJudas Priest \u2013 Exciter\n\nA great little single from priest released during a great period of their career. This release contains two great hits \u2013 one an early live favourite and speed metal masterwork, the other a drawn out epic of legendary status.\n\nExciter was a song I was taken with immediately. The most memorable part of this track is the part with the lyric \u201cYou'll never see him but you will taste the fire upon your tongue\u201d which great, with excellent vocal harmony and a change in the furious tempo of the song giving it added effectiveness. Also, the triumphant power-metal style guitar lead (you know the one I mean) is an excellent high point in this fantastic number. Halford\u2019s vocals are the usual: Amazing, with the drums being particularly well-done in this piece.\n\n\u2018Dissident Aggressor\u2019 satisfies the metal purist with damn heavy power metal-ish attack. In the typically dark style of this era of Priest, a drawn out intro builds tension before an all-out assault begins with multiple layers of that typically high Halford scream. The most memorable feature for me is the excellent and incredibly \u2018heavy\u2019 lyrics in the chorus, and its phenomenal delivery by the man himself. \u2018Stab, Bawl, Punch, Bawl!\u201d are delivered with a shitload of intensity that is seldom matched by any other band (especially when this was released). The guitar lead section is impressive in that usual sense with priest, and works well with the dark nature of the song, without being their hallmark solo section. Anyway, I found it weird that this song was included on the b-side. This has already served as the b-side on at least one other single I can think of, and I think it might have been a wiser choice to go with another cut.\n\nAnyway, a great priest single continuing their flawless progress to date by this point. Two thoroughly enjoyable tracks that are definitely \u2018metal\u2019 by anyone\u2019s standards. Pretty good as a condensed version of what Judas Priest was all about during this period. Solid stuff here.\n\n-DeathRiderDoom\n",
        "\nI just had to give this album a listen, because I just watched a great documentary about Judas Priest's highly publicized court case in 1990, in which they were blamed for the death of a young man who shot himself while listening to \"Better By You, Better Than Me.\" (The documentary is called Dream Deceivers, and it's very good.) Well, I'm glad I gave it a listen, because it was well worth it. \n\nI can see why this album has received such high praise from most of the people who have reviewed it here. Even though the production values date the album a bit, it gives the listener the chance to experience heavy metal in its young years. (The sound lacks some of the weight of eighties heavy metal production, but that's how things began in the seventies.) Stained Class has many of the hallmarks of early heavy metal. The soaring vocals of Rob Halford, with a bit more falsetto than later Halford vocals; the crashing cymbals and crisp drum work that would become heavier in ensuing years; the crunchy, energetic rhythm guitar work with solid riffing, that would also become heavier on later albums; and some very nice lead guitar that sets the foundation for later heavy metal extravagance. It really is like looking at photos of people when they were younger. You can see (or in this case, hear) many of the elements that change and solidify in later life.\n\n\"Beyond the Realms of Death\" is a classic track that develops in a classic progression: acoustic guitar and laid back vocals at the beginning, gradually building emphasis on the solid, thundering riff; and the vocals that get higher, louder and more frenzied; leading to a classic guitar solo; and finally, the finale, where everything builds in intensity and speed, with a sudden dramatic pause at the end. Beautiful stuff, really.\n\n\"Saints in Hell\" is another standout track, that reminds me a bit of Black Sabbath in its style of guitar work, but the vocals are classic Halford. None of that somewhat whiny Ozzy Osbourne stuff here! (I can almost hear the Ozzy fans shout in protest--I'm just saying Ozzy sounds a bit weak when compared to a vocal giant like Halford. I love Sab, really I do.) And some fun echo effects on the vocals half way through. Great.\n\nI could go on, but I won't. Suffice it to say that this is a seminal work in the development of heavy metal. It absolutely deserves its status in the pantheon of great British heavy metal albums.\n",
        "\nI can see from this album why Judas Priest absolutely defines metal for many people. This is classic 80s metal at its zenith. I have to admit, I've never cared for Judas Priest too much myself, perhaps because I've only heard what rock stations currently play from the JP catalog. These days, that means that about all you'll ever hear from this album is \"Another Thing Coming.\" And, looking at the record objectively, I believe that song is actually one of the weaker tracks. \"Electric Eye\" carries a whole lot more speed and punch, which is probably why it was chosen as an opener. And then there's the title track \"Screaming for Vengeance.\" I guess I can see why it's not played on the radio, what with that opening scream and all (thus the title of the track and the album). But THAT is a fine metal performance, Halford at his powerful best. Blistering guitar work and some mighty fine drumming make this track an absolute thrill to experience.\n\nThe double-guitar attack at the opening of \"The Hellion\" is a great intro to one of my other favorite tracks on the record, \"Devil's Child.\" The crunchy guitar work and Halford's balls-to-the-wall vocals make this an outstanding track. The edge on Halford's voice is particularly gritty, which shows how versatile he is as a vocalist. No doubt about it, \"Another Thing Coming\" simply does not give a reliable impression of how good this album really is. I suppose we have to be thankful that some stations still play a little Judas Priest at all, but is it any coincidence that, when Pat Boone decided to record a \"heavy metal\" album, he chose \"Another Thing Coming\" as one of his songs to...um, reinterpret? I think not. \n\nI'm beginning to listen a little more closely to Judas Priest now, and it's all thanks to this classic of 80s metal. Just goes to show you, never trust what you hear on the radio, especially when it comes to heavy metal.\n",
        "\nDiamonds and Rust\n\n\nWhat a phenomenal wee single form the \u2018Metal Gods\u2019 we have here. The excellent cover \u2018Diamonds and Rust\u2019 coupled with a distinctly late 70\u2019s Priest \u2018metal\u2019 track Dissident Aggressor \u2013 with both tracks being taken from the excellent yet often overlooked \u2018Sin After Sin\u2019.\n\nAnyway, \u2018Diamonds and Rust\u2019 is a great track I first heard in the early 2000\u2019s on the \u2018Unleashed in the East\u2019 live album (great album). I was instantly taken with the emotive qualities of the track and for a couple of years didn\u2019t know it was a (particularly dark) track from Joan Baez (folk artist). This track works incredibly well when delivered in the fabulous vocal talents of the \u2018Metal God\u2019 himself, Rob Halford. Of particular note is the excellent vocal harmony he does in multiple layers of his own voice during the repeated \u2018Diamonds and Rust\u201d lyric, which is very much a hallmark of Rob\u2019s style. The song is interesting, with a haunting quality, and some somewhat dark imagery, with the lyric \u201cI\u2019ll be damned \u2013 here comes your ghost again\u201d coming in after a rumbling and raw Tipton/Downing combination. I thoroughly enjoy what qualities Tipton/Downing bring to the song, compared with the (obviously far weaker) original. They spruce it up with some typically great guitar licks in their trademark twin guitar approach. Anyway a great, dark interpretation of an already haunting number written by Baez, which was the title track of her 1975 album.\n\n\u2018Dissident Aggressor\u2019 satisfies the metal purist with damn heavy power metal-ish attack. In the typically dark style of this era of Priest, a drawn out intro builds tension before an all-out assault begins with multiple layers of that typically high Halford scream. The most memorable feature for me are the excellent and incredibly \u2018heavy\u2019 lyrics in the chorus, and its phenomenal delivery by the man himself. \u2018Stab, Bawl, Punch, Bawl!\u201d are delivered with a f**king intensity that is seldom matched (especially contemporary to this single). The guitar lead section is impressive in that usual sense with priest, and works well with the dark nature of the song, without being their hallmark solo section.\n\nA f**king solid 2 songs on this classic 70\u2019s Priest era release, hinting at what\u2019s on offer on their phenomenal album \u2018Sin After Sin\u2019. Two well-chosen songs; your typical softer/harder dichotomy being followed, yet with both songs having that darkness typical of Priest from this era. This one would be a great investment, because both songs have considerable amounts of staying power furthered by their epic, haunting qualities. \u2018Diamonds and Rust\u2019 is a Priest fan favourite \u2013 at least where I come from, being rocked out-to regularly at parties and the like. Great release!\n\n-DeathRiderDoom\n",
        "\nSo the story has already been told to death; that about Priest\u2019s increasingly\ncommercial direction after \u2018Stained Class\u2019 and the pop-metal sound and synthesized guitars which were used for this recording. The end result of this is an inconsistent Priest album structurally \u2013 most of the tracks have at least a couple of solid sections, but the pop elements which are prominent in several tracks serve to weaken and limit the potential for the sound, especially during the choruses of \u201cRock You All Around the World\u2019 and the terrible \u2018Wild Nights, Hot & Crazy Days\u2019. With this said, the synthesized guitars are mostly prominent in some intros and solos, such as \u201cHot for Love\u2019 and \u2018Turbo Lover\u2019 respectfully, but don\u2019t really get in the way of some screaming heavy metal riffs to form the backbone of this underrated Priest album. \n\n\u2018Turbo\u2019 begins with the title track, \u2018Turbo Lover\u2019, which is probably the most unique song on the album due to its slow buildup, relatively deep and melodic vocals and incredibly catchy solo. This might be the best song on here \u2013 the riff at about a minute and a half in kicks the song into high gear, and the epic chorus and cheesy lyrics drive the point home. Also definitely worth watching is the music video for this song, for the epitome of mid-80\u2019s cheese. \u2018Locked In\u2019 has a nice opening riff and lead (again with those heavily synthesized guitars) before turning into a midpaced rocker, the verses of which can almost be described as speed metal due to that riff :-) Again, an excellent chorus here melodically, albeit with cheesy as fuck lyrics. Also worth mentioning is Ian Hill\u2019s consistent pummeling of the low end. The opening section of the title track as well as the verses of \u2018Locked In\u2019, have some excellent rumbling bass work and a few little runs here and there.\n\nThis is the point where a lot of fans turn on this album, and it is definitely understandable. Aside from possessing a decent main riff and another catchy-as-fuck chorus, the riffless verses and uninspired vocal performance by Halford definitely sink \u2018Private Property\u2019. Dave Holland is pretty much a Lars here as well, pure plodding beats and generic fills (fills?). Again, \u2018Locked In\u2019 is a great example of how a more complex drum pattern could have loaned a more metal touch to it, and turned the verses from a \u2018tap your foot\u2019 to a \u2018smash your head\u2019. But here, he is at his worst with a drum score that would make \u2018The Unforgiven\u2019 look like \u2018Bleed\u2019 in comparison. \u2018Parental Guidance\u2019 is much more of the same, good chorus (as far as sounding like Whitesnake goes) but a complete lack of riffs, aggression, speed or anything resembling metal aside from the decent solo.\n\nAlthough those last two songs certainly blow and are not metal, the next song \u2018Rock You All Around the World\u2019, is a sad attempt at some speed and fails even more than those. This piece of shit fails miserably on almost all counts. And that includes the ok opening riff and the good solo section. The repetition of the chorus is vomit-inducing, and I skip this track almost every time I have listened to this album save for when writing this review. Weak drumming, complete nonexistent bass lines, lyrics which read as though they were written by a cretin, and that damn stupid fucking chorus. This song makes me that angry, and is a perfect example of the several failures of this album. Lucky for me, things pick up again with \u2018Out in the Cold\u2019. Showing for the second time (after the \u2018Turbo Lover\u2019 solo) that the synthesized guitars can be effective, the intro is epic and melodic and sets the tone for the dark and well crafted ballad. (\u201cI feel as though I\u2019m out in the cold!\u201d). A great solo and redeeming, heavy metal song later, the track is over and I am satisfied\n\nUnfortunately, the rest of the album does not live up to this, and for the most part, sucks as bad as the worst of \u2018Demolition\u2019 and \u2018Point of Entry\u2019. \u2018Wild Nights, Hot & Crazy Days\u2019 (not typing that again) is easily the worst song on here, with its AC/DC, plodding verses, the second worst chorus on the album. No redeeming features here; even Halford sounds like shit during this one, and the drumming is of course absolute crap. \u2018Hot for Love\u2019 has a bit going on with that \u2018Defenders\u2019 style opening riff, but turns into another \u2018Private Property\u2019 during the verses and has a boring, terrible chorus. The rest of the song feels drawn out, and \u201cReckless\u2019 does nothing to fix this. Aside from a decent opening riff, it is basically the most forgettable song on here, and definitely the most mediocre and middle of the road. Here the album ends, in an unspectacular fashion. Sure, there was some magic on \u2018Out in the Cold\u2019 and the first couple of tracks, but was that worth having to listen to boring, derivative tracks like \u201cRock You All Around the World\u2019 and that other crappy AC/DC ripoff?\n\nWith the 2001 remasters came several bonus tracks which were from the \u2018Turbo\u2019 sessions but were left out for one reason or another. The score for this review however, will not take these songs into account seeing as they were not included on the original release. Of these, I have heard two, \u2018Red White & Blue\u2019 and \u2018All Fired Up\u2019. The former is an awful homage to their home country, but it is full of cheese and bad production, as well as a complete lack of riffing. Had this been on the final album, it would be amongst the worst. However, the other track is a complete enigma. Why \u2018All Fired Up\u2019 was left off \u2018Turbo\u2019 remains a mystery to me. Fucking brutal speed metal! Awesome opening riff, devastating verse riffs, soaring vocals by Halford, and holy shit, this song is definitely in my top 5 for Priest! Having heard it after buying the reissue of this album a couple of years back, it has been in heavy rotation anytime Priest is on. Had this been included on the album, it would have been the best track far and away, and would\u2019ve pushed this review up a few points. It would have worked so much better ending the album than \u201cReckless\u2019, or provided a speedy afterthought to \u2018Out in the Cold\u2019 instead of the worst song on here. These are the mysteries of life and death.\n\nSo as I said, overall, this is pretty bad. I\u2019ll give it a 72, because despite the pop, most of the songs are at least catchy and pleasant to hear. It\u2019s not like having to endure Mudvayne or Poison or anything like that. Songs like the title track, \u2018Locked In\u2019 and \u2018Out in the Cold\u2019 make this worth listening to though, just skip past songs 5 and 7. And for god sakes, check out \u2018All Fired Up\u2019!!\n",
        "\nJudas Priest\u2019s back on track at last! After two not-so-great albums, they came out of nowhere with their glorious comeback. This whole thing screams \u201cmetal,\u201d from its title to its cover to its songs. And what a set of songs we\u2019ve got here! The whole band is in top form. The guitars screech with fury, the rhythm section thunders, and above all, the vocals soar. This is, by far, their greatest moment in the 80s. Every song is full of amazing riffs and at least one blazing solo, stuffed to bursting with cool sci-fi and independent lyrics. There are even metal ballads here!\n\nIt\u2019s immediately apparent from the moment \u201cThe Hellion\u201d comes on that Priest aren\u2019t fooling around. The opening sequence is melodic yet oddly menacing, and at its climax the song gives way to one of the most legendary riffs in all of metal \u2013 the opening to \u201cElectric Eye.\u201d Yes, it\u2019s that good; it\u2019s powerful, inspiring, and energizing all at the same time. The lyrics detail, in rich imagery, a space-age surveillance machine that reminds of Big Brother, delivered in a restraint that further gives a feeling of something being hidden from the listener. One of the album\u2019s most memorable and awesome solos graces this song with its presence, sealing its status as a legend in the realm of speed metal.\n\nThe speed continues in \u201cRiding On the Wind.\u201d This time, the restraint is gone; in its place you get shrieking falsetto \u2013 the kind Halford got famous for in the first place. The solo in this one is so high-register that it almost literally slashes your face off.\n\n\u201cDevil\u2019s Child\u201d is yet another example of metal at its best. The song employs an awesome \u201cBack in Black\u201d style crunch, making it great to headbang to. There\u2019s yet another light-speed solo, not to mention an incredible falsetto-infused bridge. This is what \u201cheavy rock\u201d really means.\n\nAnd at the top of the pack rushes the title track. You can tell from the scream only a few seconds in that this isn\u2019t just any old song. And as if that weren\u2019t convincing enough, \u201cScreaming for Vengeance\u201d continues to maul your body with ridiculously good riffs, insane wailed vocals, and to top it off, a face-melting, speedy solo. This isn\u2019t a clich\u00e9, folks \u2013 this is a precedent.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s more to this album than speed. Take the cruelly underrated \u201cBloodstone,\u201d for example. Though the tempo is toned down, the song is still undeniably metal. The best part of the song has to be the chorus, with its awesome vocal prowess. \n\nOn the lighter side of things (if you can call it light), you have the ballads. \u201c(Take These) Chains\u201d is something a bit new for the band, not quite progressive like \u201cVictim of Changes,\u201d but not quite standard either. The chorus is quite memorable, and through the whole song Halford comes across as genuinely depressed. \u201cFever\u201d is more of the same (that is, more of the good) but also involves a masterful falsetto bridge much like that of \u201cDevil\u2019s Child.\u201d\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget \u201cYou\u2019ve Got Another Thing Coming,\u201d the other Priest song everybody knows. The song has strong, competently written, defiant lyrics, a great chorus, and an immortal and instantly memorable solo. Unlike many other bands\u2019 \u201chits,\u201d this is actually awesome.\n\nAll in all, Screaming for Vengeance is a glorious return to form for this storied band. Not a single song (except maybe \u201cPain and Pleasure\u201d) ever dips in quality, and there\u2019s enough greatness to keep listeners coming back again and again. It\u2019s too bad this greatness didn\u2019t last.\n",
        "\nI never saw any point in releasing compilation after compilation with almost the same songs, a tactic very well used (and abused) by major labels. Furthermore I'm wondering who actualy buy them. I can understand the release of a compilation if it contains something valuable like unreleased tracks, demos etc, with other words something that will justify the release in the first place or atleast to be beautiful and well done. This is not the case here.\n\nTo begin with, the artwork and the layout is so lame that it can only be used in a business flyer or advertisment in a cheap newspaper but not for any heavy metal release! Cheap, disgusting and very basic. Not only this, but the booklet is so minimal, almost non existent. No info, no liner notes, no artistic touch, nothing, whoever designed it had not the slightest relation or knoledge so the result is far more than bad. Ok, even though the tracks are good, Judas Priest we're talking about, but the whole outcome is so... FUBAR. \n\nIn the end we've seen it before with many bands, so what can you expect from all these bureaucrats behind major labels like Sony? Quality? No! Just releases like this one here, serving as pointless exploitations of big and well known bands and nothing more. Have you ever see a quality release from these businessmen? In the other hand you can see small labels with minimal budget releasing diamonds, but they love music, it's not just business from them. In conclusion avoid this piece of shit like plague. Another cheap attemp to cash in Judas Priest name.\n",
        "\nI bought this album for like 9$ when I was about 13 or something, and it was my first experience with a band that later would become one of my favourites. Unfortunately, I was not impressed at the beginning because I have never seen such a lazy and half-assed release. For someone that never heard of Judas Priest, this will be really confusing. The booklet in the CD case is a 5 minute output; 4 pages, the album cover, album cover AGAIN but now the \"Simply the Best\u201d image is above the picture with K.K, Glenn and Rob. And the MS Word version of the band logo is a little bigger. BIGGER!!!! And it's all black and white people! Fuck, that must have been exhausting to make. Then there is the song list, without lyrics, and we are not told what album they originally were released on. The last page has the same picture as the front- and second page. The third opportunity to look at Rob's chest hair. \n\nNow to the songs. 13 songs are not enough to show the variation of Judas Priest, but it gives the listener enough ideas of what to explore later. I bought Painkiller afterwards and it is one of the best albums ever. Probably why I bothered to reward this album with 10 whole points. The best songs on here are the trio from Painkiller (title track, All Guns Blazing, Night Crawler), Diamonds and Rust (live) from Unleashed in the East and the two closing tracks from Defenders of the Faith; Jawbreaker and Freewheel Burning.\n\nThe less exciting songs are Living after Midnight and Breaking the Law. They really aren't any interesting and it is a bad choice that they were the first songs on this album. Don't Go and Parental Guidance are just boring songs. Rock Forever is good and gives some contrast, especially when Night Crawler comes afterwards. There you can see the bands' evolution in sound, and it is a quite good song too. \n\nAs stated before, the main problem with this compilation album is the lack of input. No good booklet, no lyrics, pictures, notes from the band and too few songs. Clearly a desperate last-minute cash grab from Sony that hoped for simple minded idiots like me as customers. But hey, I was a metal newbie and I hadn\u2019t heard of Metal-Archives. And at least I didn\u2019t buy St:Anger which cost just as much\u2026\n",
        "\nAfter releasing \"Stained Class\", Judas Priest decided to put out, in the same year, \"Killing Machine\" and there are definitely lots of differences between the two. While \"Stained Class\" relied more on relatively complex song structures and on pure heaviness, \"Killing Machine\" is a lot more accessible and, at times, even commercial, with shorter (and simpler) tunes. That said, this is definitely the same band, so to speak, that released \"Stained Class\": Halford's vocals remain incredibly strong, the guitar playing is always excellent and the drumming very strong, even though less intricate. Still, Les Binks delivers a nice performance, adding some new nuances to the songs with his fills and varied beats. He's an excellent drummer and it's a pity he left Judas Priest after this record. Holland, a less original musician, occupied his place then.\n\nMoving on, the songs on the record are all quite short, but there's a fascinating diversity here: the tunes are easily distinguishable from each other, which is a plus in my books. The commercial side of Judas Priest is represented here with \"Evening Star\" and \"Take on the World\", both hits. \"Evening Star\" is a little power ballad with an incredibly catchy chorus. That said, it still is an enjoyable song, even though the record contains much better ones. \"Take on the World\" sounds like \"We Will Rock You\", albeit stronger (yeah, I've never been a Queen fan anyway). Ironically, those two tracks are the blueprints for many of the songs on \"British Steel\", an album on which Judas Priest adopted an even more commercial and accessible sound. \"Evening Star\", particularly, is quite similar to \"United\", even though the latter is a tad heavier. As for the other tracks, they represent the heavier side of Judas Priest, all straight-forward, energetic heavy metal tunes. \"Delivering the Goods\" opens the record perfectly, with a nice long drum fill near the end. The cover \"The Green Manalishi (and the two-pronged Crown)\" is another killer song, with excellent, sing-along vocal melodies. Judas Priest used to release some pretty good covers back in the day (\"Diamonds and Rust\" on \"Sin After Sin\", \"Johnn\"... well, forget it) and this one is no exception (proof: the band still plays it live, nowadays). The highlight of the album is \"Hell Bent For Leather\" though: one of the best Judas Priest songs ever (that's saying something), together with heavy metal classics such as \"Painkiller\", \"Exciter\", \"Victim of Changes\", \"Sinner\", \"Beyond the Realms of Death\", \"Rapid Fire\", etc. Everything about this song is mind blowing: the solo, the catchy chorus, the main riff, everything.\n\nThe catchiness is, finally, the most important characteristic of this album, all the choruses being quite catchy. I remember every one of them, really. So, I like \"Killing Machine\", and that's quite surprising, since I generally prefer more developed and complex songs (my favourite songs are very long, etc.), but this album is a notable exception to the rule. Straight-forward and simple? Yes. Quite commercial at times? Yes. Weaker than \"Stained Class\", \"Sin After Sin\" or \"Sad Wings of Destiny\"? Yes. Bad? No, definitely not. If you like your metal extremely catchy and straight-forward, yet quite heavy and solid, get this album: I definitely recommend it.\n\nConcluding, two notes: Iron Maiden ripped off the first riff of \"Running Wild\" (check out \"Wicker Man\") and the first vocal lines of \"Burnin' Up\" incredibly sound like something Dave Mustaine would come up with: really, listen to it and tell me that Halford doesn't sound like Dave there!\n\nBest Moments of the CD:\n-the solo of \"Hell Bent for Leather\".\n",
        "\nBreaking The Law \u2013 The first riff I ever played on the guitar, the first actual song I finished, the first I ever performed on stage and the song I heard 25 times a day without fail for more than half a year. This short sweet evergreen classic gives me Goosebumps till date. \n\nIt\u2019s a song of their first majorly successful release, British Steel. And after you listen to it, you\u2019ll know why it\u2019s the band\u2019s most popular and easily recognizable song. Despite having the simplest structure, a length less than three minutes and no achievement in technical brilliance, innovation or special skill, this song can probably be found on every metal head\u2019s list of all time favourites. Now that\u2019s something!\n\nThe lyrics are equally simple yet powerful, instantaneously memorable and meaningful. \n\nThere I was completely wasting \nOut of work and down \nAll inside it's so frustrating \nAs I drift from town to town \nFeel as though nobody cares if I live or die \nSo I might as well begin \nTo put some action in my life\n\nSo much for the golden future \nI can't even start \nI've had every promise broken \nThere's anger in my heart \nYou don't know what it's like \nYou don't have a clue \nIf you did you'd find yourselves \nDoing the same thing too\n\nComing to the other song, Metal Gods, which the band members are called today, is another evergreen classic. Unlike the previous one, this has a perfectly bent out solo and is comparitively slow in tempo. \n\nNow these guys clearly know how to compose and design songs in such a way that they get stuck in your head forever. I just wish I could give this more than a hundred.\n",
        "\nHere we have two songs from the mighty Priest\u2019s 1988 release, Ram It Down. This was Dave Holland's last album with the band and god, does he bring a whole new dimension to their sound or what! While Priest\u2019s fans during the might have thought their band\u2019s music is sacrosanct, the band members were probably thinking otherwise when they chose this completely new sound with the drums. The music has reached a whole new level. \n\nDave\u2019s uncontrollable energy and the other members\u2019 need to keep up with him pushes the music beyond limits of virtuosity. Rob Halford displays his incredible range and variety in vocal techniques, going with the flow and trying something completely new in \u201cHeavy Metal\u201d, a heavy metal anthem by the mere looks of it. Glenn & K.K. make audiences realize they can shred the shit out of the useless wankers out there with those electrifying and invigorating solos in the title track. \n\nThe sheer intensity, viciousness and ferocity of this release will captivate you like a storm. If you\u2019ve only heard their 70s and early 80s stuff, you\u2019ll be blown away by seeing what this band is capable of and you won\u2019t believe that the band which got you into metal with \u201cBreaking The Law\u201d is the same which wrote something as fast as Ram It Down. \n\nAnd ladies and gentlemen, this isn\u2019t even half as good as the album with which this same band reached an unbelievable level of perfection in its genre. I\u2019m talking about Painkiller, yup; you still haven\u2019t seen the true rage and fire of these metal gods. Though I recommend you wear a helmet and seat belt before you try that out.\n",
        "\nThis album really disappointed me. Their last offering, Angel of Retribution was actually quite good but here they\u2019re just pushing it. I appreciate the whole experimentation with a concept album but the music is still the same old tried and tested formula that was invented 20 years back with Ram It Down and worked amazingly well on Painkiller (Ahem, my favourite album of all time). It was surprising to see that they had another album in them with it in form Angel of Retribution but I guess that was it. \n\nThese 2 songs, released before the album, really got my hopes down. I mean, it was the exact same aggressive form of drumming put together with Halford\u2019s aging voice and a couple of poor solos. The passion and emotion they put in Painkiller is completely absent here; making the whole thing sound bland and incomplete. They tried their best to replace the feel with epic-ness but they\u2019ve failed miserably. \n\nThe title track of the album starts with some keyboards but then we hear Halford trying to some male opera vocals or whatever you call it. And gosh he sounds just terrible. But that\u2019s not it; throughout the song he sounds tired, pallid and pushed. We can hear the keyboard overtones throughout the song too, which make it sound even more forced and unnecessary. The solo is just blind shredding which is very unlike Priest. I was expecting a good solo but my hopes were shattered in that department as well. The song, almost 7 minutes long, sort of overstays its welcome. All I can catch from the whole song is \u201cNostradamus! Nostradamus!\u201d\n\nThe second song presented here is entitled \u201cVisions\u201d and is about five and a half minutes long. Now this just another average song no different from those mainstream hard rock bands out there, just that the riffs and drums are a little heavier. Keyboards are present here as well but luckily don\u2019t disturb the composition. The tempo is painfully slow, the riff is generic and the solo consists of very obvious notes which take no genius to write. All I can say about this one is that it\u2019s catchy, but then so was the other one and besides it really isn\u2019t a big deal.\n",
        "\nA lot of people say that Judas Priest material has been going downhill since 1980's magnum opus release British Steel. This point seemed to have been driven home with the last album, Nostradamus, an underrated concept album about the life and times of Michel De Nostredame, a philosopher and visionary.\n\nA few months before its release, Priest gave us a couple of tracks from it in the form of the Nostradamus EP. Its two songs, Nostradamus and Visions, both come from the second disk of the double-album, and represent the dichotomy of the music in the new album. Nostradamus is a melody-driven metal anthem, and long by Priest standards (Almost seven minutes! How long was Breaking The Law, 2:35 or something?) in the vein of older material like Killing Machine, with an orchestra playing in the background. Visions is almost nothing but orchestration, an interesting counterpoint to the riff mastery of Nostradamus. Clearly, these songs point out how different the music in the new album is.\n\nIf you can find a cheap copy of this EP, it may someday be a collector's item, but it's redundant if you already have the Nostradamus album. If you're knew to the Nostradamus argument, this might be a good place to start. Solid, if short.\n",
        "\nWhen discussing Ripper Owens' tenure in Judas Priest, the smart fans usually focus on the outright terrible releases: 'Demolition', for instance. But when broaching the subject of 'Jugulator', most Ripper detractors, I've noticed, get decidedly quiet. One could interpret this a number of ways, but I think saying simply that Priest fans who enjoyed the heaviness of 'Painkiller' and 'Defenders of the Faith' genuinely have nothing major to complain about with 1997's effort: 'Jugulator' is probably close to the mark. \n\nYes, there is a general lack of the classic 'Priest twin-guitar solos that we've all become accustomed to, and the album undoubtedly suffers for it, but there really is no attacking Ripper's phenomenal vocal performance, or the album's quality as a whole. In fact, after revisiting this album time and again, I've found myself missing Halford less and less. Ripper's masterful performance on the album's title track, 'Burn in Hell', 'Bullet Train', and of course the now-legendary 'Cathedral Spires' put any doubt of his abilities immediately to rest. Accusations of his 'ripping off' (no pun intended) Rob Halford don't hold water, either, as he definitely has a more forceful delivery and a more gravelly sound on the whole when compared to the metal god in question. Even filler tracks like 'Dead Meat' somehow get far better when Ripper is delivering lines like \"I will not give in... Not while I'm Liviiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiing!\" \n\nIt's more the intangibles that Judas Priest's faithful were expecting that seem to fall by the wayside on this album. That isn't a mark against 'Jugulator', though. When taken as a balls-out vicious Heavy Metal release - which is exactly what Jugulator was meant to be - it's difficult to level any genuine complaints since it is so damn solid. Judas Priest effortlessly transcend the banality of the modern Metal they have been accused of attempting to emulate on this album. The fact that so many songs are memorable alone speaks to the record's worth, with some even being declared classics, in retrospect. The music isn't quite as theatrical or overblown as past Priest albums, but now that 'Nostradamus' has been released, I would like to think that 'Priest fans have begun to understand that one can, in fact, be too theatrical. \n\nBasically, this album is a natural progression from the sound in place on 'Painkiller', it steps in the same direction as the former - that is, a more modern one - but it also shakes off some of the best elements of classic Priest in favor of a heavier, more rhythmic sound, and darker lyrical content. Ripper's vocals ultimately save it from being too generic, and a few moments of songwriting brilliance allow it to remain a fond memory for most fans of the Metal Gods. I highly recommend it. Even the filler is worth headbanging to. \n\nStandout tracks: Jugulator, Dead Meat, Burn in Hell, Bullet Train, Cathedral Spires \n\nStinkers: Abductors, Brain Dead\n",
        "\nMy, my... what do we have here? Could this be... no, it couldn't be... it is Priest, after all... wait... no, this can't be! This can't possibly be the same band who wrote \"Victim of Changes,\" or the same one who so elegantly covered Joan Baez's \"Diamonds and Rust,\" or even the band who came up with \"You've Got Another Thing Comin'.\" They're too good for that. Surely they wouldn't disappoint their rabid fanbase, right?\n\nWRONG.\n\nThis is worse than Metallica's blunder. It's worse than Diabolus in Crapsica. It's even worse than Heretic. What we have here, quite simply, is possibly (actually, likely) the worst sellout the world has ever known. To think that Judas Priest, the righteous Gods of Metal, would create such an abomination is a disgrace - no, a kick in the groin - to everything heavy metal, and good music in general, has ever stood for. Never before or after has there been such a shameless conformity to trends, and there likely never will be. This, not Slipknot, and not Job for a Cowboy, is the absolute worst piece of steaming mule dung the bowels of the music industry have ever spewed forth.\n\nHalford - the godly, the amazing - has become nothing more than a degenerate and lifeless glam singer. He never screams; he never shows any range. He's constantly in the high register, and not in a good way. Ian Hill, an underappreciated bassist, gets the treatment he deserves, but at the worst possible time. He plays nothing but eighth notes below the guitars for the entire album, and probably would have been better off not playing at all. Dave Holland does no wrong, if by wrong one means straying from a boring and typical heavy drum beat characteristic of the worst of glam rock. K.K. Downing and Glenn Tipton lose all of their soul, all of their heart... everything they churn out is glam of the lowest quality. This, by far, is the worst performance any of them has ever done, and probably will ever do.\n\nThe album opens up with \"Turbo Lover.\" Now, what could anyone expect from such a title but boring glam? They say not to judge a book by its cover (or a song by its title) but it really doesn't apply in this case. What you see is what you get - trendy glam with all the requisites: dumb, bland instrumentation; soulless vocals; obnoxious lyrics - and this one even comes with a crappy, uninspired \"solo.\" This is the song that would immediately become a \"hit\" back in the mid-eighties, what with every idiot on the street blasting stupid Winger songs from their car radios.\n\nWith such a terrible opener, it couldn't possibly get much worse, right?\n\nAgain WRONG. Next we are subjected to \"Locked In,\" which is pretty much the same thing, except without the, ahem, \"catchiness.\" Once again we have love-obsessed glam lyrics, and some more terrible instrumentation. You can pretty much expect to hear the first song again, for the most part. And then... it just gets worse. The next two songs are filled with the one and only... teenage angst! Yep, it's just \"you just DON'T UNDERSTAND!\" written a bunch of different ways. And \"Parental Guidance\" is the worst offender. Wait, since when does Judas Priest play pop punk? It's like Green Day fused with blink-182 and AFI and every other craptastic band you can think of in that style, only a hundred times worse simply because it's coming from a notoriously awesome (at least in the past) heavy metal band. Check this line out: \"You went through the same thing too!\" If that's not the most angsty line in history, then nothing is. It's enough to make you puke out your intestines. More follows suit with \"Rock You Around the World,\" \"Hot for Love,\" and \"Reckless.\"\n\nThen there's \"Wild Nights, Hot & Crazy Days.\" Think washed-up era AC/DC at its worst, combined with stolen riffs from every other rock band out there, then amplify it by a hundred orders of magnitude. Now you've got this song. It's so shamelessly copied, it might as well be a cover song. And even then, it wouldn't be a cover of Priest caliber.\n\nAnd what's this? A ballad? Could this be the saving grace of this total sellout? Perhaps a \"Beyond the Realms of Death,\" a \"Before the Dawn?\" No, it's not. In fact, it's a power ballad - of the most ridiculously cliched type. Starting with a synth intro that unsuccessfully attempts to be brooding, the song drags on for six minutes and should end much, much earlier. It is the most irritating song on the entire album (a veritable feat).\n\nAll in all, Judas Priest's Turbo is the album of choice for one who wishes to end his miserable existence by smashing his head against a wall in disgust. Thankfully, the band would improve a bit on Ram It Down, writing a couple of real classics - but they would not truly redeem themselves until 1990 with Painkiller.\n\nTake this as a lesson - the bigger they are, the harder they fall.\n",
        "\nI've never been able to understand why this album gets so much praise and acclaim; or, rather, I've understood why it gets the praise and acclaim, but never seen why people have found it deserving of such. Scratch that, I see exactly why people have found it deserving of such, but I'm not fooled by the bells and whistles that dazzle so many and don't believe it actually is deserving of such. The sound and fury signifies nothing. \n\nTo start with, the band wisely chose the title track to open the album; it's basically the only really good song of the bunch. Just listen to it: after the drum barrage, the razor-sharp guitar riffs slice in, shortly followed by Halford's falsetto, probably more aggressive than we've ever heard him before. Then the melodic solos, hot poop! If you don't turn into a flailing neanderthal during this song, you hate metal. The lyrics are kinda stupid, but in this endearing tongue-in-cheek, over-the-top way that can't help but make me smile. I mean, a man made of metal on a flying motorcycle is going to ride down from the sky and save the world? And fuck your speeding bullet, the Painkiller is faster than a goddamn laser bullet!!!!! The song is so good, the positive feelings and adrenalin spill over into the rest of the album, coloring its mediocre pace, lack of quality riffs, and the repetitive crowd-pleasing tripe they call melodies. That adrenalin still left in your system from the title track makes these feel like good songs. They're not. \"Hell Patrol\" is plodding and devoid of good riffs; mostly the guitars just go through chord progressions with a lick or two. The drumming is flashy but can't hide the mediocrity, and Halford is still a great singer but even the best voice in the world can't save crappy songwriting. \"All Guns Blazing\" is like the title track with all quality leeched out, leaving nothing but blandness (except the little opening vocal bit, which is cool I guess). \"Leather Rebel\" is OK, decent speed metal but without much more going for it than speed and energy; it's repetitive as hell, and what it repeats wasn't even that good the first time around.\n\nI could go through every song like this, but I would essentially be saying the same thing over and over, which is pretty much what the album is after the opener. Each song has the required one cool bit to carry it, after which Halford and Scott Travis try to distract you as much as possible from the boring songwriting. \"Metal Meltdown\" has a good main riff, \"Nightcrawler\" has a cool chorus, but the songs are pretty bare-boned with a facade of drums and vocals stretched over them, like a big zeppelin or something. Looks solid from a distance, but there's only gas inside. I know metal isn't the most serious or lyrically intellectual of genres, but come on, how can anyone listen to the chorus to \"Metal Meltdown\" without feeling retarded? It would make Manowar blush. The tongue-in-cheek of the title track seems gone in the boring-ass description of a metal meltdown; whatever the fuck that is, this song isn't. More like popping a paper bag. And then what's with \"A Touch of Evil\"? Sounds like \"bad touch\", you can't tell me Halford was thinking about some buxom wench while writing those lyrics! I'm sure it was some barely pubescent metalhead with peach fuzz on his balls, or perhaps some big burly biker type. Any subliminal messages that may have actually been in Judas Priest songs were assuredly trying to convince people to bugger ol' Rob's lonely cornhole. \n\nYou mesmerize slowly\nTill I can't believe my eyes\nEcstasy controls me\nWhat you give just serves me right\n\nYeah, I'll bet Halford's getting it just right. The whole song sounds like he's wrestling with being in the closet: \"I'm so afraid/But I still feed the flame\" for example. It seems somehow appropriate the song is saccharine, plodding, and repetitive as FUCK. That fucking drum beat is like getting pounded in the ass over and over and over and over. I've never engaged in homosexual relations (you'll just have to trust me on that one), but somehow after listening to \"A Touch of Evil\" I know just what it's like. \n\nPainkiller is essentially a comic book movie. At first there's the joy at recognizing a beloved character up on the big screen: for a second, all your childhood nostalgia comes rushing back, and you think for that fleeting second that this movie will portray the superhero with all the bells and whistles modern special effects can provide, yet still remain faithful to the original character you know and love. After that initial thrill, you slowly realize that aside from those bells and whistles, the plot and characters have been trivialized. Corny romance, laughably inept villains, eye-rollingly bad dialog, clearly family-oriented humor - all serve to bring home the reality that no, this is not the beloved Judas Priest of old. It's cartoon versions of themselves, two-dimensional, with the target demographic clearly being the Saturday morning market. Watch the music video for \"Painkiller\", Halford looks like a Looney Tunes character. Homo Hal, or something. Metal isn't always the most mature of genres, sure, but these are no youths, swept up in dreams of knights, gore, and Satan; these are middle-aged men with huge budgets indulging in regression. Midlife crisis? You betcha. There's nothing wrong with traditional metal themes, but there are much better ways of dealing with them. You know, like Judas Priest used to, over a decade before writing this crap. Unsurprisingly, the thought put into the music reflects the thought put into the lyrics.\n",
        "\n\"Painkiller\". What is there left to say about a true classic in the pantheons of metal? This surely remains one of the greatest 'comebacks' in music history, as the legendary Judas Priest - after two sorely lacklustre records - reinvented themselves in a blaze of molten steel. \"Painkiller\", from the thunderous drum-roll-to-the-power-of-100 intro of the title track to the cathartically epic closer \"One Shot at Glory\", showcases metallic masters firing on every cylinder they possess.\n\nWhat immediately impresses is the sense of vitriolic rage that blazes from the music. This is priest burying the synth-pop horrors of Turbo, and rediscovering the dark, Sabbath-ian-plus-extra-epic sense of Romantic (big R; I'm talking \"Frankenstein\" here, not \"Love Actually\"), Gothic gloom that haunted their early 70's classics. Channelled through a ripping post-Thrash sensibility, the results are truly immense. This is Priest sounding angrier, hungrier and more dangerous than they have in a decade; the slow degeneration into a strange kind of camp comedy metal - \"the REAL Spinal Tap!\", as one eminent British rock publication put it - is swiftly and irrevocably wiped out. This, I contend, is the album which cemented their place as true legends of Metal.\n\nBold words? Think of Priest's 80's output; slick, heavily produced, streamlined. Along with the bombastic Bruce Dickinson-era Iron Maiden, they set the blueprint for 80's metal. But as the new wave of metal forged on, and as thrash, black and death metal formed around them, Priest were in danger of being left behind. Where once they were the leaders and innovators of a burgeoning, revolutionary genre, now they led huge tours with numerous stage props and enough pomp to bankrupt a small African country. Where once they plied their trade with fury and deadly determination through the clubs and pubs of England, now they resembled nothing so much as a strangely mobile Broadway musical production. This album was a symbolic turning point for Priest; it is the sound of a sleeping beast awakening.\n\nFor if any band - or any human for that matter - can truly claim to have pure METAL flowing through their veins, it is Priest. Casting aside the big, anthemic choruses and fruity excesses of their 80's sound, they blast forth with a lightning bolt of pure steel. Scott Travis - their new drummer - invigorates and energises the band immediately; unlike the plodding and pedestrian Dave Holland, he attacks the kit with a frankly blistering combination of power, intricacy and rhythmic perfection. Glenn Tipton and K.K Dowing unleash raging, dark and relentlessly powerful riffs left, right and centre, adding a sprinkling of furiously technical, face-melting solos. And Rob Halford lets rip with the most hair-raising performance of his entire career; a tour-de-force of shrieking vocal mastery, delivered with intense power and conviction.\n\nThe lyrics follow suit. You'll find nothing here but nearly formless expressions of rage, violence, terror and glory; archetypes of metal. These lyrics delight in the exultation of pure power. They are great because they invoke; rather than sticking to the descriptive, story-telling aspects of traditional metal, Halford summons the primeval energies that fuel these dark fantasies, and expresses them directly and viscerally. Music and Lyrics together constitute a clenched fist; a mighty blow that lays a true benchmark for traditional metal. There may be many imitators, but none come close to this; a true masterpiece.\n",
        "\nI've always been rather indifferent to much of Judas Priest's catalogue. Their 70's albums were hurt by the flat and punchless production while much of their 80s material sounds dated, especially their big singles like \"Hell Bent for Leather.\" The only studio album of theirs that I can enjoy from start to finish is \"Painkiller\" because it actually sounds like they're trying to break new ground as opposed to getting more and more commercial appeal. The Ripper albums do not really need to have anything said about them other than that they were failed experiments. A lot of people seem to like 2004's comeback reunion album \"Angel of Retribution\" even though for the most part Priest just seemed to be going through the motions and doing what is expected of them, as well as a terrible bid for mainstream airplay in \"Revolution.\" There really is not anything on that album worth listening to more than several times other than the speed metal of \"Judas Rising\" and the epic \"Loch Ness,\" despite the laughable lyrics. \n\nI'm not exactly sure what spurred the creative minds in Judas Priest to go the route that they have taken on \"Nostradamus,\" because judging by the reviews and fan reaction, most people would be quite happy with Priest becoming the AC/DC of heavy metal. Perhaps Halford, Tipton and Downing realized that they were not quite ready to become a nostalgia band, releasing the same basic material every few years as an excuse to tour and play \"Breaking the Law,\" \"Living After Midnight\" and \"You've Got Another Thing Comin'\" to thousands of screaming fans. Whatever the reason, Judas Priest have revamped their sound and have put out an album that surprised many a fan, including me.\n\nAnyone with even the slightest knowledge of metal knows that Nostradamus is an idea that has been done to death, and sadly, the lyrics of this album are still pretty bad, although certainly not their worst. However, it seems like for the first time in twenty-five years, the band actually HAS something to sing about, as opposed to more songs about super-heroes, machines, machines that are super-heroes, and self-references. For the first time in years, it seems like the band is actually trying, without being influenced by what the rest of the music scene is doing like they were on the two Ripper Owens albums. It's obvious that Judas Priest have put a lot of work into this album; a lot of labor is put into the arrangements of the songs. The band has said in interviews that many of the strings heard on this album are real, and the strings do factor prominently into several songs, most notably \"War,\" which actually has a orchestral interlude in the middle.\n\nThe songs are almost universally epic in nature, thanks in part to interludes which serve more as intros to the songs that follow rather than displays of self-indulgence (take that Jon Schaffer!). However, despite the epic nature of the songs, there is a wide variety of sounds and emotions on display. Some songs, like \"Revelations\" and \"Persecution\" exhibit a sense of urgency that has been largely absent in Priest's music for many years. Others are true epics in nature, such as the aforementioned \"War,\" \"Alone\" and album closer \"Future of Mankind\" which features fantastic interplay between the guitars and the strings. Album opener \"Prophecy\" should remain a concert staple for years as well as the title track. Special mention should go to \"Conquest\" as well; I cannot figure out why this song is so enjoyable, it is just so well-written that it stays in my head for hours after I hear it. The pinnacle of \"Nostradamus\" is the track \"Death.\" This is what Judas Priest would sound like if they were a doom metal band, and I am blown away with the result. The atmosphere for this song is lethal, and Rob Halford is stunning vocally, it sounds like he is Death, and Tipton and Downing just slay on guitars.\n\nTipton and Downing have been one of the most famous and arguably best guitar duos in metal history, but on this album they take their playing to a whole new level. There is genuine emotion along with the shredding. They add a neo-classical influence to some of their solos and they kick Yngwie's ass by introducing an element that he cannot comprehend: subtlety. Some of these solos are not the type that knock one on their ass on the first listen, it takes several listens before it dawns just how well-written these solos are. There are some solid riffs featured throughout the album as well.\n\nIn addition to all of the positives mentioned above, Judas Priest have done something that they have not done in their entire career. I mentioned earlier how apathetic I was to most of Judas Priest's earlier studio albums, but I left out just how good their live albums are. I consider the 1979 album \"Unleashed in the East\" to be the greatest live metal album of all time, and anyone who saw Priest live in the 80's or even more recently can attest to how great their live show is. Earlier songs take on new life in a live setting, even Painkiller songs. \"Angel\" from \"Angel of Retribution\" is ten times better when performed live. However, with Nostradamus, Judas Priest have finally written an album where the songs reach their full potential in a studio setting. There are no songs that are watered-down so that they can be played on the radio, even the more straightforward songs like \"Visions\" or \"Prophecy\" are not simple enough to receive a large amount of airplay.\n\nSome minor complaints include the fact that Scott Travis seems unfortunately restrained throughout, a shame because he is so talented. Also the two ballad-type songs, \"Lost Love\" and \"New Beginnings\" are not quite as good as the songs that follow and precede them. As mentioned before, the lyrics are still pretty weak, but thankfully it is not that noticeable unless one reads the liner notes.\n\nIf approached with an open mind, \"Nostradamus\" is a very rewarding experience. However, people who are expecting \"Angel of Retribution 2\" (Or \"Screaming for Vengeance 3\") will be disappointed. Many of the poor reviews for this album come from people expecting another re-hash of an earlier album. In a way, Priest is to blame for this because that's what their fans have come to expect from them, some just are not ready or willing to accept a Judas Priest that does something different this late in their career. Whether you like the album or not, Judas Priest have made a statement that they are not out of ideas yet and that they refuse to be a nostalgia act. Perhaps with a few more albums like this, Priest may experience a second life similar to what Iron Maiden have done with their past three albums.\n",
        "\nY'know I'm really starting to think that as long as the band doesn't go groove metal, a heavy metal band selling out and just trying to record the catchiest thing possible is actually a very good thing! I'm just basing this off this album, the early 90's releases of Me & Me, and, err, Celtic Frost's Cold Lake- that was a travesty, sure, but still 3 out of 4 isn't bad. Judas Priest's release is firmly in the camp of \"excellent rocky sell out\", a quick streamlining of the previous formula; a natural progression that's been executed well and doesn't sound forced, and some crisp, clean production giving the whole thing a radio-friendly sheen.\n\nI like most of Priest's work but I've generally found that they're at their best when they go for the shorter song- Nostradamus being good proof of this. Here's it's all short and it's all gold - yes, I am a fan of United, in all of it's cheesy, desperate attempt at sing-a-long glory- and the end result is a good-to-excellent selection of heavy metal tunes.\n\nEverything's kept simple and straightforward in this album; the solos short and economical, the structures, simple in their verse/chorus type, the riffs, simple but catchy. Downing and Tipton are in great form throughout, and I find the riffing in particular to be really first-class. Breaking the Law's a good enough example of what's on offer- an intro riff that will stay in your head for years, short and catchy verse and chorus sections, and a bridge that dispenses with any progressive pretensions and keeps you interested until the chorus comes back in. The formula is repeated over and over again with varying amounts of success (Living After Midnight and Rapid Fire being keepers, You don't have to be old and Steeler, not so much) but overall it works, and even when Priest shrug off the restraint and go for the unabashed, completely undignified sing along that's United it's still catchy and short enough to be inoffensive and effective.\n\nThis certainly isn't an album that's for sitting in the lotus position, with headphones in a darkened room. An in-depth listening is more liable to make you realise that the slower tunes plod along fairly heavily, that most of the songs lack any really concrete climax or progression, and that some more solos would've been welcome. However, putting this on in the car, or at a party will get you singing along extremely vigorously (Rapid Fire and The Rage in particular must be responsible for a very large amount of car crashes over the years) and it seems that's what Judas Priest wanted to achieve with this.\n\nThere's not really much else to say here. The aim, as far as I can tell, was to make a short, catchy album and that aim was achieved. It seems that everyone had a fairly good time doing it- the album has a fair bit of energy and in various interviews Downing, Tipton and Halford named this as their favourite JP record. It's a fun record that will get you head banging and pretty much appeals to everyone. Well worth getting, although those hoping for some more substantial heavy/speed metal may find themselves disappointed.\n",
        "\nJudas Priest\u2019s second official live album was released with much bombast and an accompanying video; the question you\u2019re probably all asking is \u201cIs it any good?\u201d. Well that\u2019s a two part answer, there are really excellent things about it and some not so desirable things too. I\u2019m going to start with the good and then point out it\u2019s shortcomings. \n\nFirst off, the production is crystal clear. This was one of the first metal concerts to be recorded using Sony digital tape and it really shows. You can even hear Ian Hill\u2019s bass if you listen carefully! Another positive point is the performances themselves are excellent. Rob Halford had recently cleaned up his addictions and he's absolutely on fire here, hitting all the highs with ease and confidence. Songs such as Breakin' the Law and Heading Out to the Highway have extra lead breaks and solos not on their original studio versions.\nLastly, the increase of tempo really helps some songs. Freewheel Burning in particular borders on thrash!\n\nNow for the negative: I've always said good album art, while not necessary, is an asset. This album has probably one of the ugliest sleeves I've ever seen on an official commercially released product, take a look for yourself. Next, this album was recorded on the Turbo tour. Take what you will from that fact but I feel that the amount of Turbo songs in the set list really detracts from the album. Especially considering Out in the Cold is the first track! I'm not sure who thought opening the set with a ballad was a good idea but it doesn't set the mood well at all.\n\nOverall, it's pretty enjoyable but the set list just kills it for me. Now to be fair, the band has said in interviews that they didn't include classics such as The Ripper or Tyrant because they were already on Unleashed in the East. I understand not wanting to repeat themselves but I believe that with less emphasis on Turbo and more tracks from bonafide heavy metal classics like Screaming for Vengeance and British Steel, it would've made a good live album even better.\n",
        "\nAh, another Judas Priest live album. What makes this different from all the rest? Well, Rob Halford wasn\u2019t in the band at this time, instead Tim \u201cRipper\u201d Owens is filling in the god-like shoes of Mr. Halford. This could be quite the nerve-raking task. Is this live album as good as all the others?\n\nWell, the music itself is performed great. Glenn Tipton and K.K. Downing do their part as they always do delivering crazy solos and energy to the stage. Ian Hill, is well, Ian Hill. His bass playing is as good as it gets. Scoot Travis can set fire to a drum set. This leaves one person\u2026 Tim Owens. His vocals as a whole are good, but on live performances it just seems like he\u2019s holding something back. It\u2019s sad how much potential he always seems to wasting. In the studio he\u2019s amazing but it always feels like he\u2019s not doing his best on stage. Anyway he does his job here, although he is no Halford he can still pack somewhat of a punch. \n\nThe set list itself is typical Judas Priest, which isn\u2019t a bad thing. All time classics like \u201cPainkiller\u201d, Hell Bent For Leather\u201d, and \u201cYou\u2019ve Got Another Thing Coming\u201d are all present and performed well. The crowd isn\u2019t as loud as you\u2019d expect them to be, but at least there existent. The songs performed off \u201cJugulator\u201d are better on this album; much more energy and they feel like their performed a little faster.\n\nThis is a solid live performance from the extraordinary Judas Priest. Many die-hard fans will hate the fact that Rob Halford isn\u2019t singing, but Tim does do a good enough job. Check it out if you haven\u2019t heard anything from the Tim Owens era, you may find it interesting. Most Judas Priest fans should enjoy this, unless their that upset that Rob Halford isn't singing on it.\n",
        "\nNostradamus is no doubt an album that has split Priest fans in half. I personally belong to the half that loves the album. It definitely is not traditional Priest, and that is why it is so good. Angel of Retribution was a solid Priest record, but it felt too much like Priest was trying to imitate the 80s and early 90s. Nostradamus is a departure from that; it blazes new ground and is completely unlike anything in Priest\u2019s back catalogue.\n\nThe album is much more mid-tempo than most previous Priest albums, and more significantly, it uses some very unconventional features like choirs and strings. This of course creates a very epic mood to the album, and they are much easier to hear when the songs aren\u2019t as fast as Painkiller. It seems I find something new every time I listen to the album; for example, last time I listened I noticed a nice acoustic guitar in the background of Revelations.\n\nThe album flows smoothly from one song to another and at no point does the music pause. This is achieved with guitars fading out from one riff or melody to another that starts a new song, the aforementioned strings, or a combination of both. Almost half the songs are interludes that progress the music from one song to another, and though some do not like them, I find them quite enjoyable. The music has a flowing and elegant feel because of them. Though few songs are instant hits like Breaking the Law or Painkiller, the album as a whole is very cohesive because of the interludes. It\u2019s almost like listening to a long piece of classical music.\n\nThe lyrics are well above your traditional Priest lyrics (Breaking the Law etc.) as they tell about Nostradamus. I haven\u2019t paid that much attention to the story as I know the basic idea anyway and I just haven\u2019t been that interested. I won\u2019t go into more detail about that, but I\u2019ll say that Rob\u2019s vocals work well on this album. He\u2019s not trying to hit the super high notes like he does when he struggles live. \n\nThe songs are mostly mid-tempo and longer than usual, but Priest do manage to sneak in some songs that just sound like the fast, aggressive Priest we all love: most notably Persecution and Nostradamus. However, most of the songs are slower and more emotional; e.g. Revelations, The Future of Mankind, Visions, Alone, and War are the best ones. \n\nOverall, this is probably the most consistent Priest album after Painkiller. It features few definite hits, but it\u2019s so epic, atmospheric, and just different that it earns a very high mark. This is an album that is always a great pleasure to listen to, for both artistic and entertainment value.\n",
        "\nHow many of these have been released in the past year? I occasionally pick up one for myself, my friend, and if you really want-- your boyfriend/girlfriend. In fact, this could probably ease one of them into metal (if that is your intention). Why do I say that? Well it is sort of structured for it. By now most of you have heard all these songs, except possibly the Sin after Sin song \"Dissident Aggressor\". Sadly, there is nothing new brought to the table here besides a live version. I don't know why the hell they recorded yet another (!) best compilation when they could just as easily stockpiled on their old compilations which contain exactly the same tracks, if not more.\n\nI picked up a CD that was a compilation for the hell of it about a year or two ago, and it was fantastic. It had more live versions, more songs, and thus a longer play time. This is sort of a cash-grab if you ask me. I mean, yes you could use it to get someone into metal (notice how the tracks go from mainstream to metal [climaxing at Painkiller])-- but you've heard all this before on 100 other compilations. There is not a single point to this besides the $$$. I would recommend this only to people who need to pay the full price for a new live song, or those who had no idea who Judas Priest are. Even then, I would tell them to get another compilation.\n\nThe song choices aren't bad. I have no idea what is with the last two songs to be honest. All Guns Blazing... probably didn't sell the best. I would have expected Leather Rebel, or A Touch Of Evil. Revolution is the most overplayed song and the worst on the Angel Of Retribution CD, so I can't understand why it is on here.\n\nOther than that, It sums up Judas Priest pretty well, despite the fact it has forgotten about Rocka Rolla and Sad Wings Of Destiny. Neglecting Victim of Changes was a bad move. Any compilation that is considered their \"best of\" without that song... isn't a true \"best of\". I know they can't do it because they pretend it never existed (yet they play it live... nice job forgetting it) because of the record label, but they could have done maybe a re-hash of it like Gamma Ray did with Blast from the Past... or better yet, do a live version of it! They have no problem doing live versions for good songs, so this shouldn't be a problem.\n\nNeglecting the annoying sellout'ish factor laced with this CD, it is pretty decent. Without the above flaws, this could have worked out to be a decent compilation. Oh well...\n",
        "\nThere have been many bands which go through the already clich\u00e9d act of \"Rise/Fall/Comeback\" albums. But most bands who pull it off just do it once; a series of good albums, followed by one or two mediocre ones, and then a \"comeback album\" which most of the time sucks. However, by 1983, Judas Priest were already releasing their EIGHTH album in the form of 'Screaming for Vengeance'. And by 1983, Priest had already went through the 'Fall', in the form of the boring 'Point of Entry'. I mean, by 1983, bands like Maiden were just releasing their fourth albums, and Anthrax/Slayer/Metallica their debuts. Priest were able to repeat the Rise/Fall process three times, with 'Point of Entry', then 'Turbo', and more recently 'Jugulator'.\n\nSo this is Priest's comeback off Point of Entry, and it was a huge improvement over that one. It seems that they listened to some Maiden before recording this, because it's influence seems frequent in tracks like 'The Hellion', with it's harmonized guitars, and in 'Bloodstone', with it's melodic riffs (it's just a small influence, there are no galloping riffs, which are a trademark of the 'Irons, for example). Following the harmonized layers of 'The Hellion', the album explodes with the first 'proper' track, which is 'Electric Eye', and it has one of the most metal riffs I've ever heard; those kind of riffs which you show to random non-metalheads and they'll automatically know it's a Heavy Metal riff! My only problem with 'Electric Eye' is that Halford doesn't wail or hit any high notes, and he just does those British Steel-like midrange vocals.\n\nHowever, since Halford didn't wail at all in 'Electric Eye', then he proves he CAN fucking do them on 'Riding on the Wind', which is filled with falsettos and screaming guitar solos; Halford going \"riidinng on the winnddd\" at full power is really great too. But what keeps Screaming for Vengeance from getting a higher score is '(Take These) Chains' along with 'Pain and Pleasure'. The first is a take on a radio-friendly pop-metal hit, while 'Pain and Pleasure' is very quiet, almost harmless, and I can't find anything really good in it, perhaps that guitar solo at 2:33, but nothing else. \n\nWhen 'Pain and Pleasure' ends in a rather unremarkable note, we fucking have another Halford wail coming out of nowhere, and it's actually the goddamn TITLE TRACK! It's pure speed metal which marked the beginning of things to come (yeah, Painkiller). 'Screeaaminng! Screaming for Vengeance!\", if it wasn't for Dave Holland thinking of child porn the whole time instead of focusing on drumming, this song (and the whole album for that matter) would be much better. It's sad how we have Glenn and KK doing their best at the guitars, with Halford killing himself to get those falsettos, Ian Hill at least writing some songs, while Holland is just a fucking metronome with some cymbal hits. Okay my rant is over. After the title track, it wouldn't be wise to put some more speed metal, since it would either overshadow the already awesome Title Track, or fuck itself do to it's own suckness. No, what they needed was a huge hitting, Arena Rock style classic! Fuck yes! 'You've Got Another Thing Comin' ' is this album's Breaking the Law, it's catchy, pretty simple, and a really fun sing-along, specially the pre-chorus of \"if you think I'll sit around as the world goes by\". It of course was a huge hit, and the guitar solo in the middle is a nice touch.\n\nAt this time you may be wondering why the Title Track wasn't the best song. That's because we fucking have 'Fever'! It manages to do what '...Chains' didn't, which was being a pop-metal ballad like arena rock song. It starts with a very mellow acoustic intro, with Halford singing a melody which will get stuck in your head for WEEKS to come. There's also a little synth doing the bass lines (I'm not sure if Ian Hill did them on the rest of the song though), then the song just explodes doing circles around 'Chains'. The chorus is fucking majestic, although I have no idea why did it hit me so, since the melody in the verses is so great! Then there is a harmonizing guitar solo between Glenn and KK, and though it's not very shreddy, it suits the song perfectly. After it there's a little bridge, then out of nowhere, it explodes into one of the best moments in the history of metal: \"So destiny has bought us oh so close together!\" that thing comes out of nowhere, the first time I heard it, I wasn't expecting it at all. 'Fever' is the best song in here, beating 'Electric Eye', and the Title Track; it's sad how it's never played live, and it's not on compilations, and pretty much nobody gives a shit about it. \n\nScreaming for Vengeance finishes with 'Devil's Child', and it kinda starts weak, until the chorus which has Halford viciously shrieking \"II BEELIEEEVEEEE\". It's cool how that chorus gets louder with every repetition, though the closer is kinda overlong, and it ends in a very unpleasant mode, it just...stops! You should get this for the best Priest album of the 80's, it's the most consistent of them all, since British Steel has even more 'weak' tracks, and 'Defenders...' is just good for the first half. It has it's moments though, and when it does, IT'S FUCKING KILLER!\n",
        "\nI make no qualms or secret about the fact I'm a massive Judas Priest fan, I love the boys dearly (not in the same way Dave Holland does either) and they've provided me with hours upon hours of fun much like some enormous heavy metal jigsaw. But with 'Nostradamus' all the excitement and hope of a new Priest album was quashed, once the floodgates had been opened 'Nostradamus' just sort of waffled its way out. All the heraldry, trumpet fanfares and strippers exploding out of cakes that so often comes with mainstream metal releases only added to the disappointment and as such 'Nostradamus' has sat collecting dust and the exoskeletons of all sorts of creepy crawlies (it seems renting a flat with Miss Havisham wasn't the most hygienic of my decisions). And upon revision it seems 'Nostradamus' hasn't gained anything, absence may make the heart grow fonder, but in this case it made me reckon that Priest's latest simply isn't a good one. \n\nHonestly, I feel a tad guilty taking pot shots at this, I mean it's Priest - two guitarists with a strange similarity to those gin-drinking single mothers, a singer who is developing a back problem from his auto-cue and um... a rhythm section. I feel for the guys, the lovable eccentric (strangely spouseless in Rob's case) uncles of heavy metal. But something is very much astray here and I can't ignore it any more.\n\nOn his summer holiday someone must have given Halford a copy of Blind Guardian's 'Nightfall...' or maybe Virgin Steele's 'Atreus...' series. Obviously, he didn't listen to the bloody things and simply went;\n\"Yes, we are Judas Priest, we can pull off ambitious concept albums... quick Glen, to the Pro Tools!\". And there we have it, Priest gave us 'Nostradamus'. This whole thing reeks of Pro Tooled castration, everything is ruthlessly neat and largely sterile. Honestly, I don't give a shit how much you dig all this modern equipment, you should still be striving to capture an organic feel to your record if you play in a traditional metal band. A main aim of 'Nostradamus' was to prove that Priest could still cut it with the young guns, they'd already done this with 'Painkiller' see, and it worked. The album actually succeeds in this aim, as this isn't the Priest of old or even the safe comeback of 'Angel of Retribution'. Instead this rather a saggy, bloated album is Priest for the 21st century: overblown and overlong much in keeping with most of the young fellows out there. The Pro Tooled vibe is best seen in the albums drumming. Scott Travis is an excellent drummer, that I can't doubt. But here he is bound and chained to functioning as a metronome simply to keep Glen and Ken's adventures in banality in time. But guess what? The boys haven't even worked out Pro Tools properly... they managed to delete most of the guitars from the verses in 'War', or at least I hope they did, I mean Judas Priest wouldn't have submitted that as a complete song, would they? \n\nOh lord, there are a whole bucket load of iffy moments to be had with 'Nostradamus'. 'Pestilence and Plague' for instance, nice enough verses here but then an Italian chorus? Ew, if I was of Italian descend I would have much preferred a big sing along of;\n\"GREASY WOPS, GREASY WOPS, PIZZA PIE!\". Xenophobic as that may have been, it's much less awkward than the novelty of an Italian chorus. 'Death' is a complete snorefest, this was one of the tracks I was exposed to prior to this albums release, at the otherwise fantastic Download festival performance. It's heavy and sinister I'll give them that, but completely lacking in that necessary black magic (not the chocolates) to make a sinister metal classic. But honestly, most of the whole first side of this is pretty much interchangeable in its blandness and overwhelmingly modern in its approach to shit. There are a few glimmers of hope every now and again but this is a Judas Priest album, even 'Ram It Down' had more killers than this!\n\nBut there are two excellent numbers on the first half of this incredibly overwrought album, 'Prophecy' and 'Persecution'. The former is a tacky, schlock-tastic song with a storming mid-paced riff that will fill up those arenas quite nicely. Halford's vocals are still in excellent form, albeit a tad raspy and are generally well accented by the cheesy B-movie keyboards that aren't too far from Geoff Nicholls' work with Sabbath. And of course, the chorus had us in all in a bought of laughter all over the world... brilliant stuff. The guitar break is nice too, recalling 'Defenders...' era stuff like 'Love Bites'. But it's a lulling you into a false sense of security, I suppose I shouldn't hear the first song of a record and go \"Agggrh best album ever *insert band name here* are back!\". 'Prophecy' begins with an atmospheric if slightly processed guitar motif and then settles into some comfortable speed metal, good stuff but hardly awe-inspiring, but by the low standards this album has given itself, quite enjoyable, especially in such a nadir of none-starters. \n\nThe second disc generally continues the album's true concept - the none-starter. But somehow it feels a little a better, maybe it's because you can see the light at the end of this dry concept album. After two go-nowhere-nothing-special Priest tracks, we get 'Alone'. This one is a nice anthemic balladic song, it does seem like it's trying a little too hard, but then again so does the whole album. Just before the five minute mark we get a nice little UFO reference, hear that? Pinched from the truly beautiful 'Love to Love' from UFO's 'Lights Out' album... yeah KK, I fucking spotted it. Ears like a hawk! Earlier in the song we get a nice bit of 80s arena metal Priest riffage which is pretty satisfying. 'Visions' is a standout here, something a little different for the band. This wouldn't sound out of place on any modern power metal album, for instance it's not far removed, stylistically at least, from some of the Deris era Helloween ballads. Still compare this to the truly moving 'Night Comes Down' or the psychedelic haze of 'Dreamer/Deceiver' and it falls far short of the immense emotional depth Priest have been capable with their ballads in the past. The title track is another good 'un, a complete retread of 'Painkiller' but enjoyable. The synths are well used here and Halford's quasi-operatic vocals are a nice touch (but don't you think it should go into the Gloria Gaynor song after the 'But I will survive!' line). It's very cheesy, even by the Priest's own standards, but somehow it works... maybe that's because we all loved 'Painkiller'. However, the timing of this being the first single has only gone to further undermine 'Nostradamus' as it's the only song of this sort on the album. Nowhere else do Priest achieve this velocity or bombast on this album... so it simply crushed the expectations of many fans. \n\nGlen and KK do rip it up here with the leads, no surprise really. But then again guitarists often dig stuff like this to shred over. Give a guitarist a nice simple chord progression or riff to work over and they can really let rip (I'm not implying that they can't do this over more complex arrangements, mind you) . So in all actuality, this album is Glen and KK getting with the Joe Bonamassa crowd- boring songs and killer solos! Guitar World loves you! \n\nThe segues here are generally dull too, the only advantage they have over the rest of the album is that they're much shorter! So that's a positive I guess... I'm going to put this album up on the fridge, well done guys. A lot of the time the band are trying to capture that beautiful epic feeling of 'Children of the Sea', but the magic is gone, the dragon slain and the it's a complete case of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu - it's been done before and it was much better. Conceptually this album doesn't achieve much either. The lyrics are generally poorly done. I've been told that this is what happens when Glen Tipton gets a big hand in writing lyrics, it happened with the Ripper era too. The rhyme schemes are painfully obvious... love/dove/above stuff, GCSE English fodder. Historical and literary lyrics have always been Iron Maiden's forte, so it is completely beyond me why the authors of 'Living After Midnight' decided to go down this route. Perhaps, it's a case of keeping up with the Harris'... but Priest need to come to terms with the fact they are Judas Priest, not a European power metal band and not Iron Maiden. However, this isn't the first time the two's careers have intertwined - from the synth experimentation, the dodgy replacement singers, the solo careers which both involved Roy Z and now the controversial reunion albums. In all these periods it seems Iron Maiden have come out on top, as their latest actually maintained my interest for more than one listen! Astounding! \n\n'Nostradamus' is a functionless album- if I want a Priest album I'll listen to, wait for it, a good one and for the ambitious conceptual stuff I'll also want, shock horror, a good one! The idea of the double CD album has proven itself a bad one, again and again, see Helloween's third installment of the Keeper series for another example (though that is perfect in comparison to this the ugliest of Judas' ducklings). Artists seem to be taking the same amount of good ideas they would have used for a single CD and are dragging them out, with all means of padding and fluff, into ungodly lengths of time (I figure this thing takes more time to listen to than it actually did to write, you know copy and paste on the old computer recording tool). Hopefully, this idea of the double CD album will prove itself a teething problem of the 2000s and be what goldfish in platforms were to the 70s, Flock of Seagulls hair was for the 80s and what Courtney Love was to the 90s. Also the packaging sucks, especially for the \u00a310 I shelled out for this and more importantly, I want the old Priest logo back!\n",
        "\nFirst of all, I'd like to start by saying I'm relatively new to Judas Priest's music. Of course, I've heard their stuff before, but I've never really listened. I heard about this new album \"Nostradamus\" coming out... a concept album. 2 CD's... being hailed as a \"Masterpiece\". Just like everyone else, I heard the promo track \"Nostradamus\" on the internet and was banging my head and thrusting my horns. On top of that, being somewhat fascinated by ancient prophecies and Nostradamus my interest really started to grow, and upon it's release I bought my first ever Judas Priest record - and what a record it is! If you take this at face value for what it is, then you can really appreciate the greatness of this album.\n\nI'd like to start by mentioning that Rob Halford absolutely tears it up on this - for a 56 year old man you've got to give the guy some credit. His voice is truly powerful and epic. There are some truly emotional and epic moments on here that make this record one to be reckoned with.\n\nThe music is relatively simple throughout. There are very few scattered dual guitar riffs, but when they do happen it is a feast for the ears. However, most of the riffs here are BAD-ASS. The opening riff to \"Prophecy\" is killer - even though it's so simple my grandmother could probably play it. Of Course, \"Nostradamus\" is the fastest and heaviest track on the record, but that doesn't mean the rest is bad. \n\nYes, there are a lot of slow songs here. At first I wasn't too impressed with them, but after a few repeated listens they grew on me, and now I can't stop listening. The melodies are simple yet memorable. The keyboards are atmospheric. The album probably could have been a lot shorter, and only 1 disc long... but in reality, there really is no bad material on this disc. Every song has it's place and is solid. I'm sure Judas Priest knew this and hence decided on the double concept album format. If that's the best way to express their artistic intentions then so be it. \n\nSo if you're a fan of MUSIC then I'd recommend this album. If you want fast head-banging metal front-to-back about chicks & booze then skip over this. It has an old-school metal vibe to it, great artwork, solid lyrics, and of course the performances by Halford and Company are excellent. Although a bit late, I now consider myself a Judas Priest fan due to this album, and have already collected some of their past albums. \"Nostradamus\" is a must own for any metal fan.\n",
        "\nThis is one of the three singles to come from Judas Priest's groundbreaking 1980 album 'British Steel'. Although it is perhaps not as well known as 'Breaking The Law' (possibly their most famous and recognisable song of all, partly due to more mainstream exposure and a hilarious video to go with it), it is, in my opinion, just as good. In some ways, better.\n\n'United' is a slow-paced anthem with a catchy and motivational chorus with the lyrics 'United, United, United we stand. United we never shall fall.' It reminds you of the kind of thing fans would chant at a football match. The main riff is similar in style to 'Don't Go' from another album, in that the guitar chugs along in a 'stop-start' fashion and it is heavily driven by the gloriously audible bass, courtesy of Ian Hill. Towards the end of the song, the guitar and bass cut out, leaving Halford singing the chorus over a solid drum beat. It could be criticised by some for not having a guitar solo, but strangely it seems right for once not to have one.\n\nNow then, the other side is much more typical of Judas Priest. 'Grinder' starts off with a fucking tasty riff which WILL make you headbang ... it's beyond your control... The chorus, like most Priest choruses, is infectious and sticks in your head for hours. When you've listened to this single, your brain will be forcing you to sing the choruses to both of these songs all day, which can hardly be a bad thing! \n\n'Grinder' is my personal favourite out of the two, and that's because it is blessed with a truly face-melting guitar solo, making it seem as though Glenn Tipton has 10 fingers on his left hand! Overall, this is a great release with two of Priest's best songs. If you can get your hands on it, don't hesitate!\n",
        "\nJudas Priest is without hesitation, one of the most influential heavy metal bands of all time. Many bands these days tries to play as Judas Priest, but it never is \u201cthe same\u201d as it is with the metal gods. After been rocking for more than 30 years, the guys now decided that it was time for their first concept album ever, and what a fatal step that was!\n\nWe all know what Judas Priest does best, if you do not know, listen to their albums \u201cPainkiller\u201d or \u201cDefenders of the Faith\u201d as good examples. Yes, the answer is heavy metal in the classic Priest-ish vain. Therefore I was sceptic already when they first spoke about a concept album and that they were going to do it \u201cbig sounding\u201d, epic and use keyboards + orchestra. It isn\u2019t Judas Priest\u2019s \u201cthing\u201d, was what I immediately thought, and the proof are the two CD\u2019s that lies in my stereo at the moment. The latest JP-album called Nostradamus.\n\nAn album that clicks in over 100 minutes is what this is, and that is absolutely something this band has never done. This is such an album that contains too many songs for it\u2019s own good (I count all these short intros/interludes). The purpose of these shorter interludes like \u201cThe Four Horsemen\u201d, \u201cSands of Time\u201d, \u201cPeace\u201d and so on is to make a nice atmosphere to the concept of the album I guess. But what they do is just being annoying. Ok if it had been one or two, but on here there\u2019s nine and that\u2019s too much and very unnecessary. I only find two of them good which is the intro \u201cDawn of Creation\u201d (leads perfectly into \u201cProphecy\u201d) and \u201cThe Four Horsemen\u201d (leads perfect into \u201cWar\u201d).\n\nHow many are the actual songs then? It\u2019s 14 of them. Do they impress more? Some of them yes, but awfully too many of them, no. What most of the songs - and this album in general \u2013 misses is the \u201creal deal\u201d. Which means Judas Priest playing their classic heavy metal, what they are best at. I mean where are THEE songs? I can only find 5 songs on here that I can say are great, but the rest? 5 songs out of 23 that are good, sadly it\u2019s a very bad result, people. These five great ones are \u201cProphecy\u201d (classic, heavy Priest, possibly best song of the album), \u201cDeath\u201d (Priest goes doom metal. Heavy stuff! Maybe a bit too long, though), \u201cPersecution\u201d (could\u2019ve been on Painkiller), \u201cNostradamus\u201d (Another very Painkiller-ish, with those awesome leads that\u2019s missed through almost the whole album) and finally the ender \u201cFuture Of Mankind\u201d (a heavy one with nice chorus, and a heavy mystical ending). They are the proof that shows the true Judas Priest and what they does the best...but they\u2019re too few as you can see. The general feeling of the remaining songs is that the guys has focused too much on the orchestra-stuff and try to make them \u201cfit into the concept\u201d, making them atmospherical and so, instead of making actual good songs. They are very melodic and positive sounding. The choruses of most of them are very lame and almost poppy, while some can have nice verses. \u201cVisions\u201d and \u201cRevelations\u201d are such, and it only helps them reaching OK.\n\nBut listen to songs like \u201cConquest\u201d, \u201cAlone\u201d and \u201cNew Beginnings\u201d and I know that you WILL think what the fuck is this? I remember I did, and still does after many listens...especially \u201cNew Beginnings\u201d, how could it have sneaked in under the name of Judas Priest? Some of these songs could easily have been on \u201cPoint of Entry\u201d which has two good rockers, and the rest is something I can\u2019t put a name on. These weaker songs mentioned above are brothers with for example \u201cSolar Angels\u201d or \u201cYou Say Yes\u201d.\n\nWhat\u2019s as good as usual though is the performances of all band members, in all departments. Rob has worked really well with the lyrical content, and his vocals sounds great. I think he could\u2019ve put in more \u201cHalford screams\u201d in there, though. Guitar-players KK and Glenn obviously, the best guitar-\u2018brothers\u2019 in the world. Though there\u2019s less blistering solos than we\u2019re used too. That\u2019s a big minus because those guitar solos are important in this band\u2019s music. Scott does a solid job with the drums, a tad more finesse than on last album. The production of the album is quite thin with a quite bluesy feeling over it. Drums sounds a bit farty and in general it feels like everything is a bit pushed back to highlight the orchestras. It\u2019s in the vein of the \u201cAngel Of Retribution\u201d-sound, though a bit weaker because of the orchestra-stuff maybe. I wasn\u2019t too happy with it anyway.\n\nI have really tried to \u201cget into\u201d Priest\u2019s world of Nostradamus but I can\u2019t because it\u2019s not good enough. It\u2019s very atmospherical and with well made orchestrations and so, but the album misses songs. I mean good songs. Eventhough there are some highlights on this album, it\u2019s just not enough. I am disappointed with it and I hope that the guys will steer the ship back on the right course. They have now tried - and they\u2019ve done it as they planned probably - to do a concept album with (for them) a bit more unusual material on. It\u2019s absolutely cool that the guys are trying out things, but it obviously stands clear that this development done on here was wrong for them. This is not what I want out of one of the best heavy metal bands of all time. To develop doesn\u2019t always mean it\u2019s positive, remember that. \n\nI must say that \u201cAngel Of Retribution\u201d was much better. That was a \u201csafe-play\u201d from the band ok, but at least it was good. And isn\u2019t that the meaning with music? I believe so. But sadly, Nostradamus isn\u2019t that.\n",
        "\nWhen everybody is still talking about the new Priest album, the conceptual (and pretty good) \u201cNostradamus\u201d, I'll review one of the past masterpieces of the band, the legendary \u201cSad Wings of Destiny\u201d. While I haven't heard all the discs already released by Judas Priest (I still need to get \u201cSin After Sin\u201d, \u201cDefenders of the Faith\u201d, the debut and the Ripper-era albums), this already is my personal favourite, mainly because it is a amazingly beautiful record, but not beautiful because all the songs are soft and emotional, beautiful because there isn't a single note misplaced on the majority of the songs of this album, beautiful because of the amazing songwriting talents that the band displayed with this piece.\n\nSo, one of the biggest complaints I have against this album is its weak production. The guitars lack punch and power, the drums aren't that audible, the same goes to the bass guitar. However, this weak production also gives to \u201cSad Wings of Destiny\u201d, a special, retro-sound that I, at times, appreciate. About the performance of the musicians, the two guitar players deliver amazing performances, not that technical, but still playing some nice solos and absolutely godly riffs (the first one on \u201cVictim of Changes\u201d, the main one on \u201cIsland of Dominations\u201d, the first one of \u201cDeceiver\u201d, ahhh so many!). The drumming is very simple, yet decent, I don't know why but I like Alan Moore's performance here, still simple but... effective, in my opinion. He's no Les Binks (nor Scott Travis) though, so don't expect anything ultra-technical here. About Rob Halford, he was really in a wonderful shape during the recording of this opus, I mean, he sounds very emotional during the songs, from the desperate screams on \u201cVictim of Changes\u201d (interesting lyrics too) to the beautiful performance on \u201cDreamer Deceiver\u201d, he proves here the awesome singer he really is. What a mindblowing performance, indeed.\n\nAs for the songs, there are lots of variety here, which is a plus, obviously. There's some calm songs, \u201cDreamer Deceiver\u201d and \u201cEpitaph\u201d, the latter even containing piano lines, an intro, \u201cPrelude\u201d, some aggressive, true heavy metal songs, like \u201cDeceiver\u201d or \u201cTyrant\u201d, and a marvellous epic, called \u201cVictim of Changes\u201d.\n\nAs for highlights, almost every song is excellent in its own way... The record kicks off with the afore-mentioned intro, that leads us to the fantastic \u201cTyrant\u201d, which features an insanely catchy chorus and fast guitar work, this is a proto-speed metal classic that's for sure. \u201cGenocide\u201d follows, being another aggressive tune, a bit more elaborated than \u201cTyrant\u201d though. Halford's performance is especially raw on this track, and even rawer on the \u201cUnleashed in the East\u201d version of it, which is, by the way, absolutely worth listening. After the little \u201cEpitaph\u201d, \u201cIsland of Domination\u201d kicks in, being one of my favourite songs of the bunch. It begins calmly and then becomes heavier when a fantastic guitar riff kicks in. Great stuff.\n\nSide B opens with the epic, mindblowing, masterpiece known as \u201cVictim of Changes\u201d. From the Led Zeppelin's Black Dog inspired (but much better than it) first section, to the awesome breakdown, this song is absolutely perfect. Rob Halford delivers here the performance of his career, when he screams like a mad man, near the end of the song. \u201cThe Ripper\u201d follows, taking you back to the rainy and cold streets of London... Great great ambience. \u201cDreamer Deceiver\u201d is the next track and it is another masterpiece, one of the best metal ballads ever made, that's for sure. Moore's drumming works pretty well here, accompanied by yet another masterful performance by an inspired Halford. Finally \u201cDeceiver\u201d ends the record but unfortunately it is a pretty weak track, the worst of all (it still carries a sweet main riff, though).\n\nConcluding, there are some weak tunes here (\u201cGenocide\u201d and \u201cDeceiver\u201d, the latter is the weakest by far, though), but the whole listening experience is great and there are some masterpieces to be found here too (\u201cVictim of Changes\u201d and \u201cDreamer Deceiver\u201d). All the songs are also extremely well composed, the song structures are, at times, intricate, and all the musicians sound pretty good here (the man of the album is Halford, undoubtely). A fine work of art by Judas Priest, after all, and my favourite album by the band. I'll think if this record deserves some more points as the time passes by. \nAh, and the artwork is great too, perhaps my favourite artwork ever!\n\nBest Moments of the CD:\n-the breakdown and ending of \u201cVictim of Changes\u201d.\n-the part when Rob Halford begins to sing on \u201cDreamer Deceiver\u201d.\n-the riff explosion of \u201cIsland of Domination\u201d.\n-the beginning of \u201cThe Ripper\u201d (ah, how I love that song).\n",
        "\nReleased between their greatest commercial successes in the form of British Steel and Screaming for Vengeance, Point of Entry seems to have ended up as the forgotten cousin in the Priest discography. While a success in its day, it hasn\u2019t stood the test of time well, and frankly it\u2019s not hard to see why.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say there\u2019s anything wrong with it per se. Far from it in fact. The songs on here are mostly decent hard rock tracks very much in the vein of Killing Machine/Hell Bent for Leather and British Steel. The problem is that it comes across as more of the same.\n\nIt\u2019s like listening to an entire album of the lesser known songs off British Steel but without anything that leaps out and grabs you as immediately and effectively as the distinctive riffs from Breaking the Law or Electric Eye. It\u2019s hard to be more specific about tracks, because they\u2019re mostly good but all so forgettable.\n\nIronically, the album doesn\u2019t really kick off until it reaches the bonus tracks, which are available on the 2001 remaster. Thunder Road is to my mind the forgotten classic of 80s Priest. It\u2019s also another example of the bizarre bonus track choices made with these remasters, as it was actually recorded during the Ram it Down sessions!\n\nSo while it doesn\u2019t belong on this record, Thunder Road nonetheless shares the outstanding production and song writing on the inconsistent but occasionally brilliant Ram it Down. It starts off sedately enough, then dives into a long sequence of traded solos and vocal brilliance that has to be heard to be believed. In short, it\u2019s a highlight.\n\nThe other bonus track is a live recording of Desert Plains that takes the fairly bland and pedestrian original and injects it with immensely more power and energy. One wonders how Priest keeps dragging up such obscure live tracks yet hasn\u2019t made a decent live album since the 70\u2019s. It\u2019s worth hearing, but don\u2019t buy the album for it.\n\nIn short, Point of Entry is a \u2018listen and forget\u2019 sort of album. It\u2019s not bad, but it\u2019s nothing special either. Pick it up if you see it cheap or you\u2019re a Priest completist (in which case, good on you). Otherwise, don\u2019t panic.\n",
        "\nBefore I continue, I just need to inform you of the real track list.\n\n1. Dawn of Creation / Prophecy\n2. Awakening / Revelations\n3. Sands of Time / Pestilence and Plague\n4. Death\n5. Persecution\n6. Exiled\n7. Alone\n8. Calm Before the Storm / Nostradamus\n9. Future of Mankind\n\nThe track list shown above is Nostradamus. I don't know what was printed on the CD, but please ignore it. Now that I've wheedled out the shit, I may go on.\n\nNostradamus is a very ambitious project. Priest, a relatively simply, dare I say, primitive heavy metal band, is attempting to create a flamboyant and extravagant album filled with synthesizers, orchestras, and classical influences. What the hell? I personally loved the idea, but many questioned it. Why? I couldn't quite comprehend it. Well, after listening to Nostradamus many (and I mean many) times, I can finally understand why people had concerns, but why they should now feel free to forget them.\n\nThe album, as printed, is an hour and forty minutes long. The real album is 70 minutes long, but either way you look at it, the damn thing is long . . . which kicks off the first part of our discussion: where the album fails in most peoples' eyes. \n\nFirst and foremost: variation. At times, the album is just too slow, and for an album as long as this, that is a serious problem. This is no Painkiller. The band made the terrible decision of releasing the fastest track from the album as a first glimpse which got people excited for another speed metal album, of which this is not. The song \"Nostradamus\" is in no way representative of the album as whole. Personally, I was hoping for a nice mix of fast and slow, and that's what I got, though there were times when I sat there waiting for a song to end. The mid-paced gallop can become very tiresome, and even worse, the slow-paced crawl during the second disc can become downright brutal. I'm looking at you, New Beginnings. There's not enough change to keep someone interested for so long without it becoming a grueling challenge.\n\nNumber two: the guitars are too soft. This album is from the same people that brought us Beyond the Realms of Death, Victim of Changes, The Hellion, Savage, A Touch of Evil, Hell Bent For Leather . . . all songs that rely heavily on the guitar. Yet, for some reason or another, they decided to make the guitars almost inaudible at points. And the guitarists are the ones who produced the damn thing! You'd think that they would want to be on top, which I personally would have much preferred, but unfortunately, they relegated themselves to the bottom. They're still there, and their solos still rock, but even with their presence, there lingers the feeling that Glenn and K.K. were not utilized to their full potentials. Even with this issue, though, they are still incredible. Listen to Prophecy, Nostradamus, or Future of Mankind and try to convince me that they aren\u2019t. It\u2019s just a shame that the volume is so low. \n\nNow that I've covered the basic faults, it's only fair that I speak of where this album succeeds, and let me tell you, this album succeeds a lot. The two faults mentioned before, in honesty, really don't detract from the experience as much as other people make it seem. The addition of synthesizers was a brilliant decision, enabling them to create a unique atmosphere unlike anything they\u2019ve done before. It really makes you feel as if you're witnessing the story right as it unfolds. It's incredible. The intros and interludes (of the good tracks) link the songs perfectly and allow the story to feel like one entity instead of a bunch of separate stories thrown together. The first couple of times you HAVE to listen to the album in order, otherwise the magic just won't be the same. Now with my track list I did kill off some of his visions, his wife and children\u2019s death, and his second marriage, but they only serve to drag the story on. Do we really need four separate songs for the Four Horsemen? How about another song dealing with his visions? No. Like I said, what you see above is the real track list. It works much better this way and truly invokes the Priest magic. Oh, and speaking of magic . . .\n\nRob Halford. Throughout the entire album the man is simply phenomenal. I don\u2019t think I have ever heard him sound better. This is no hyperbole, either, Halford sounds fucking astonishing. From his sinister, ominous tone in Death to his shrieks and screams in Persecution, he sounds completely unstoppable. Even in the songs that suck, Halford sounds unbelievable. He is a force to be reckoned with, and this album only serves to confirm his status as one of the greatest metal singers out there. This could quite possibly be the greatest performance in the history of his career. Yes, it\u2019s that good. \n\nIn closing, Nostradamus is a damn fine album and one that you should not miss out on. The pros FAR outweigh the cons. Have a listen for yourself and you, too, will understand. \n\nNow, I must address a possible discrepancy with the score. I would easily rate the track list that I have given you a 90+. However, I cannot justify giving Nostradamus the same score when I had to remove half an hour of the music in order to truly enjoy it. As such, I deemed it necessary to lower the score a tad.\n\nPros\n-Synthesizers and orchestras add new dimensions to Judas Priest\n-Rob Halford is incredible\n-An hour of ten minutes of truly remarkable music\n-The solos rock\n-The lyrics are actually good\n\nCons\n-Guitars should be louder\n-Half an hour of the album sucks\n",
        "\nI've tried twice before to review this; obviously both times prior were failures. I really feel strong for this album that I am not going to give up on getting through.\nThe album itself is quite hit and miss, the full power the album holds can only be sought if you listen very hard. The album itself quite long but the length though is not something to take to solely judge an album by, though it is quite a long album clocking over 100 minutes compare to Iron Maiden's \"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\", that was only 43 minutes long and still delivered a hell of performance from all band members. Judas Priest's \"Nostradamus\" is different to that though, the way it delivers the story is more diverse and deep than \"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\" a lot of the songs are sang in the persona of Nostradamus himself, even if they are spoken in third person, lyrically the man telling the stories of the visions he has seen and the prophecies he has predicted is Nostradamus while in \"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\" only several of the songs were sang in the persona of the Clairvoyant character of the story in that album. \n\nBecause its different and that there's obviously so much to say, to tell about Nostradamus who unlike the character in \"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\" was at one point real. While not exactly on the point of the music itself, the story of the album is very important. When it comes to concept albums the story needs to be well though of and the songs need to tie in with one and other to create the atmosphere and that is what the intro songs are for, it adds to the length of the album sure, but I feel that they're essential to keep the album tight and focused.\n\nThe music itself is indeed Judas Priest; there are elements of \"Sad Wings of Destiny\" and \"Sin after Sin\" I can hear in the darker slower songs such as \"Death\" and \"War\" with the likes of \"Angel of Retribution\" in songs such as \"Revelations\" still prominent. It\u2019s a long album and you need to listen carefully to appreciate it, its pretty much one of those albums that grows on you over time.\nThough the album has its good points with the story telling and the performance, I feel like there's just something missing from it, something that could turn this album from a simply epic album into a masterpiece of music that should be worshipped for many years to come, maybes a fast paced song to contrast with the slow and mid paced songs, or a song depicting about how to this day, the name and prophecies of this prophet are talked about, just as he himself predicted in the opening song \"Prophecy\", either one would have made a perfect finisher to the album. \n\nApart from the fact I feel it lacks in some category, its still a fine album by a fine band, the eerie lower tone of Halford's voice in the likes of \"War\" and \"Death\" literally send shivers down my spine and more or less reminds me for some reason of early Black Sabbath, with the \"doom\" element in the riffs of those songs. There are though, still signs of the Judas Priest sound old and new in some of the songs, \"Revelations\" sounds an awful lot like \"Hellrider\" from \"Angel of Retribution\" in the singing style for example and \"Visions\" sounds like \"Solar Angels\" from \"Point of Entry\" with the roaring guitars working together, whilst vocally it sounds a lot like \"When the Night Comes Down\" from \"Defenders of the Faith\".\n\nSo, even for a lengthy album, even after almost 40 years, Judas Priest still have the ability to make some brilliant music and its not everyday you hear Nostradamus being brought back to life in these songs. Though the album lacks in some departments, I still salute it, I still love it. Though, if asked, I wouldn't dare choose a favourite, for there are too many songs to choose from, though if forced I\u2019d choose Awakening/Revelations, or maybe The Four Horsemen/War, I could go on and backtrack my decision, but its just too difficult to choose from an album where there are so many songs I enjoy listening to, and that at the end of the day is all that matters, as long as you enjoy listening to, doesn\u2019t matter who it\u2019s by or what expectations one previously had, if it\u2019s enjoyable, it\u2019s worth it in the end.\n",
        "\nI can appreciate what Priest tried to do with this release \u2013 after the reunion album Angel Of Retribution, which was the textbook definition of \u2018playing it safe\u2019 albeit a solid release overall, they wanted to experiment. This album, as you\u2019ve no doubt inferred, is a concept album about the prophet Nostradamus, who for those not in the know, was a 16th century purported prophet who made predictions, or quatrains, about major events to come \u2013 and whether or not you believe he was the real deal, some of the quatrains are adequately creepy in their similarity to the events that they supposedly predicted \u2013 so it\u2019s an interesting lyrical concept and I\u2019m glad to see a band as able as Priest take on the job. \n\nWhat we have here is a massive album \u2013 it\u2019s as long as a full-length movie and spans two discs, so you\u2019re definitely getting your money\u2019s worth in that regard \u2013 with a smorgasbord of mid-paced tracks and symphonic influences. So this could have worked out one of two ways: we could have here a sweeping, epic number that uses its symphonic elements in creative and moody ways, building up to majestic swells or brooding tones where the themes demand it, and a solid sense of dynamics between heavy and soft \u2013 or we could have an album that ultimately collapses under the weight of its own grandeur, unable to sustain such a lofty concept for its running time and songwriting style.\n\nI\u2019m sorry, Priest. But to me, this album is mostly the latter.\n\nThe biggest problem at work here is that the album, especially at the midsection, just drags on without the musical adventurism needed to sustain interest on repeated listens. Look at the song Alone, for example: it\u2019s a number that gradually builds with some sweeping vocal work and tastefully-subdued guitar licks, and it could have worked in half its running time. There\u2019s just not the diversity or freshness to sustain a seven-minute clock-in. Actually, many of these softer songs just aren\u2019t up to par as stand-alone tunes. They\u2019re the kind of thing that you\u2019d see as filler on previous Priest albums, but here they\u2019re placed at the forefront as the meat of the album. They\u2019re formulaic in composition and performance, which gives me the impression that the band wanted to create something with an epic exterior whilst not putting forth as much effort to make it so on the interior.\n\nOkay, so maybe that was a bit harsh; perhaps they really, really did try. Because there are a few points on this album where the whole mid-paced symphonic thing really hits home with exactly the atmosphere that an album like this deserves: take the excellent song Death (Title is about as subtle as a sledgehammer, but it\u2019s lovable in its forwardness). Rob\u2019s vocals in the first half go from a slightly regretful, but powerful and subtle rasp to the occasional high wail that hits on just the right emotional frequency. All the while, Priest\u2019s beloved dual guitar attack is there in the background, pounding out doomy licks at just the right places, gradually building in intensity. You can almost feel the cold wind brushing through the nighttime cathedral cemetery, or the feel of the dark one\u2019s scythe against the back of your neck. I typed that last sentence up just by closing my eyes and focusing on the music right now, so it\u2019s very effective for me. The last parts of the song have this strong, sorrowful moaning illuminating the background under Halford\u2019s increasingly-urgent vocal delivery \u2013 it\u2019s a wonderful song, and something refreshingly different for Priest.\n\nUnfortunately, Death speaks for the minority of the album. Many other mid-paced songs here suffer from being \u2013 I hate to use this term, but it\u2019s honestly the best one I can think of \u2013 uninteresting at best, and not at all fitting with their supposed mood, at worst. Come on \u2013 far be it from me to tell a band as legendary as this how to write their music, but something like War would be far better served by being an aggressive, vicious thrasher, for example. Speaking of which\u2026\n\nI\u2019m not ragging on Nostradamus for being a mostly mid-paced album. No, it just seems that Priest are out of their element, and it shows. Pestilence And Plague is a genuinely solid song, and guess what? It shows Priest in their more traditional element and rocks pretty hard. I\u2019ll give the up-tempo title track a pass for pretty much borrowing the Painkiller riff in its verse, because the song is very good overall. Halford\u2019s vocals take on a storyteller\u2019s dynamic, shifting appropriately throughout the verses and chorus.\n\nThe band as a unit plays tightly. I was worried about Halford\u2019s aging vocals after his performance on Rising In The East (Poor guy seemed like he was going to keel over during Painkiller), but he does very well here. His softer vocals have much more emotional depth here than on the band\u2019s other albums, and his singing is the high point of the interludes \u2013 they do slow an already-dragging album down, but at least his vocals prevent me from writing them off as a total loss. The other band members don\u2019t ever seem to go out of their way to really show what they\u2019re made of, but their performance works.\n\nThe lyrical direction is something that I\u2019d like to point out on personal preference. Ideally, an album about Nostradamus\u2019s life would strike some kind of balance between his life, and the content of his prophecies. I can\u2019t be the only one who felt that certain prophecies would make excellent stand-alone songs. Instead, we get a series of songs about war, conquest, pestilence and death, and otherwise only vague mentions of the fact that he has prophecies \u2013 otherwise it\u2019s just a story about a man persecuted by the Catholic Church, which while interesting from a historical perspective, just can\u2019t be the angle that the band hoped for. For what they are, though, the lyrics are eloquent and effective. So that\u2019s just a personal point.\n\nYou almost had it, Priest. Much of the album suffers from not being interesting enough to keep one\u2019s attention through a whole listen. Interestingly, Loch Ness from the last record was like a foreshadowing of this album: a unique and intriguing lyrical concept that nobody\u2019s really dared to tackle before, albeit bloated more than Garfield the cat. But make no mistake, there are some gems to be had: the before-mentioned Death, Pestilence And Plague, the building Persecution, the well-plotted Revelations and the rousing title track, for example. This album definitely works better for me when the individual tracks are picked apart and listened to separately, rather than having to sit through much of the bloat. Die-hard Priest fans owe it to themselves to give Nostradamus a look. All told, I\u2019m glad I bought this, because repeat listens \u2013 mainly, of individual tracks \u2013 have fallen in the album\u2019s favour, so I amended my ranking of this album from a 65% to a 70% - to me, a low B and a commendable effort. If you\u2019re just getting into the Metal Gods, avoid this album for now and pick up Sad Wings Of Destiny, Painkiller or Unleashed In The East. I went in with a reasonably open mind, but the problem isn\u2019t with the direction \u2013 it\u2019s the execution.\n",
        "\nFirst up, let me state that I have nothing against the use of keyboards and symphonic elements in metal. And neither was I too apprehensive when I first read that Priest are going to go symphonic with Nostradamus- bands like Primal Fear have shown that Halford-like vocals can fit in snugly in power metal scenarios too. If bands such as those can pull it off, why shouldn't JP be able to, is all I thought. But now, after half a dozen spins, I've decided that this is the worst move that Judas Priest have made in their long and illustrious career. Showing Halford the door, albeit temporarily, was a masterstroke in comparison. \n\nThe biggest problem with this album are the intro pieces that precede most songs. None of them are memorable (read 'Embryo' from Master of Reality), and most of them are not even the right kind of build-up to the song that follows. It really is not enough if all the intro does is segue right into the next song - anyone with a basic audio mixing software can achieve that. And no, random keyboard melodies do not do the trick either. Nor does verses sung at one third the usual tempo. In fact, if you remove all the intros, and edit the songs a little, you'd have had a very good single-CD release on our hands.\n\nEven the main tracks sound very formulaic, and not very different from a lot of power metal one comes across. Rob Halford sounds a jaded man, especially when singing the slow-tempo parts. He comes into his own during most choruses though. The guitaring on most songs is almost hidden behind all the bombast of the keyboards, and if you are expecting a whole lot of Tipton-Downing fireworks, chances are that you are going to be sorely disappointed. Scott Travis keeps time competitively throughout and does not do much else. As for the 'concept' of this album, there is not much scope for innovative storytelling and has a constant 'I told you so' leitmotif to it. Of course, when the story is about Nostradamus, there are not too many other themes one can explore. And my last, and trivial, crib are the song titles - very, very unimaginative.\n\nIn spite of everything, there are still a few positives one can find on this album. One - Judas Priest still knows how to make catchy music (Prophecy being the best example). Halford can still scream for vengeance (the title track Nostradamus has a couple of good ones). And on the song 'War', the band nails the whole atmosphere-building stuff quite well.\n\nTo sum it up - the Gods of Metal experimented. Things went 'poof' instead of 'bang'. I'm sure they'll change the ingredients a little, and get it right the next time.\n",
        "\nOk, I'll start this review by saying that this album is NOT a typical Priest album... I mean, its very different from their other albums and that's the main reason why some people don't/won't like it.\n\nNow, is the fact that it sounds different from Priest's other albums a bad thing? In my opinion, it isn't. I've always been a big fan of epic music and Nostradamus is one of the most epic albums I've ever heard. Yeah, the music on this album is very epic and its also very melodic, in fact, Nostradamus is probably Priest's most melodic album.\n\nAnyway, lets talk about the songs now. I'll skip the interludes because they are pretty useless, I mean, they aren't bad at all, but I usually skip them unless I feel like listening to the album all the way through. \n\nFirst CD:\n\nThe first song, Prophecy, is one of the best songs on the album, it reminds a bit of Angel Of Retribution, it has a great main riff that is used during the verses and the chorus, the pre-chorus is quite dark and I like it and the chorus is good, but its not one of the best choruses on the album. The next song, Revelations, is even better, the verses are very epic and I love them, the song is very epic and symphonic overall (but so is most of the album). War sounds more like an interlude than a real song, but its a great one, it does sound like a war song, the chorus is very dark, but its not very original, I mean, the riff during it is the typical dark metal riff (you'll understand what I mean when you'll listen to it). After that, we have Pestillence And Plague which is a favorite of mine, a lot of people don't like the chorus because its in italian, they think its cheesy, but personally, I think that its one of the best choruses on the album, its very epic and Rob Halford's vocals during it are great. Next is Death, its quite forgettable, but it has a few great parts, the riff at 2:12 really reminds me of Death (the band), I mean, in terms of harmonies (I'm sure that Death fans will get what I mean)... The part at 5:12 is the best part for me, the synth sounds great. Conquest starts with a pretty catchy riff and like Pestillence And Plague it has a very epic chorus. The next song, Lost Love, is the first ballad on the album and its definitely a great ballad! Its very soft, but its simply beautiful. I'm not a big fan of ballads, but this one is very good. The first CD ends with Persecution which is the heaviest song on the CD, its good, but to me its one of the weakest songs on the first CD... Its one of the songs that sound the most like typical Priest, but you know what? I prefer the epic sound of the other songs.\n\nSecond CD:\n\nIn my opinion, the second CD is nowhere as good as the first one. Actually, it mostly consists of ballads. The first song, Exiled, is good, but its nothing special really... The next song, Alone, is MUCH better! Actually, its one of the best songs on the album, its a ballad, but like Lost Love from the first CD, its a great one and it has a really memorable chorus (one of the best on the album). Visions is one of the first songs that we all got to hear, when I first heard it, I thought that it was average and I still think that its average... Like Persecution from the first CD, it sounds quite a bit like a typical Priest song, but its simply nothing special, the chorus is very generic... Next, we have, in my opinion, the weakest song on the album, New Beginnings. It isn't bad, but its very forgettable, its just a very average ballad. The title track starts in a very epic way, a lot of people don't like the intro, but personally, I love it! Anyway, its one of the heaviest songs on the album, the riff under the verses really remind of the main riff from Painkiller (which can be a good thing or a bad thing) and the chorus is quite catchy. The last song, Future Of Mankind, is one of the best songs on the second CD, its very epic and the chorus is not overly original, but I love it!\n\nNow lets talk about the musicians. I've never really cared about Rob Halford's voice except when it goes very high, but I have to admit that I like his voice on this album a lot, he doesn't sing very high as much as on the other albums, but his voice is very poweful! We all know that Tipton and Downing are great guitarists, I've always loved their solos, but I must say that I'm quite disappointed with their playing on this album... Tipton's solos have always been very memorable, but his solos on this album are not very memorable. A lot of the riffs aren't really incredible either... I mean, the album has a few great riffs, but the riffs are not what make the album good (the melodies are)... Oh well, to add some positive, a couple of the songs have very cool melodic (melodies, harmonies, ...) sections. Scott Travis is a great drummer and I guess that he's great on this album, but I don't know much about drumming... Ian Hill, well, he's Ian Hill. Last, but not least, the orchestration/keyboard/synth on this album is one of the best things about it! A lot of people think that Judas Priest and orchestration don't go together and maybe they're right, but without the orchestration/keyboard/synth, this album wouldn't be anywere near as good as it is. Its an epic album, it needs orchestration. Seriously, do you really expect an epic album to consist of guitar, bass and drums only?\n\nWhat about the lyrics? Well, honestly, they aren't bad, but they aren't great either, they're quite cheesy, but lyrics have never been Priest's strong point. Personally, I don't really care about them... Yeah, I realize that the album is a concept album, but the music is great, so I don't really mind the lyrics.\n\nSo, overall, Nostradamus is a great album. Its obviously not Priest's best album, but, for me, its better than Rocka Rolla, the overrated British Steel, Point Of Entry, Turbo, Ram It Down, Jugulator, Demolition and Angel Of Retribution. Like I said earlier, its not a typical Priest album, its more epic than heavy, but who cares? Just accept that Priest tried something different. Listen to it with an open mind like I did, don't expect a second Painkiller.\n\nBest songs (in no specific order): Prophecy, Revelations, Pestilence and Plague, Conquest and Alone.\n\nWeakest songs: Visions and New Beginnings.\n",
        "\nHonestly, when this pompousness series took off, I never ever would've guessed that Judas Priest, the metal gods themselves, would ever release an album that would qualify to be covered. I mean really, what made the band special? Heavy fucking metal, speed, power, Halford's inimitable wails, Tipton and Downing's dual guitar attack, this was THE band right after Sabbath in the 70s. Sure, I understand they can never release Sad Wings of Destiny or Painkiller again, but they don't have to release garbage instead. Like most metalheads with an internet connection, I anxiously awaited the day the title track was streamed. Upon hearing it, I was completely stoked, it was a bit of a Painkiller rehash, but it was really fucking good. What's not to like? Judas Priest sped up again, nothing bad could happen. I resisted downloading the full leak and instead rushed out immediately after work on the day it came out to buy it. The last time I blindly bought an album, I wound up with Iced Earth's Framing Armageddon (the second installment of this particular series, actually), so you figure I'd've learned my lesson. Long story short, I haven't learned, and I probably never will.\n\nNearly everything that made the band special is gone. The solos are still there, but that's really about all that managed to sneak into the record. The majority of this album is midpaced and symphonic. While epic string sections aren't normally a part of Priest's repertoire, it isn't grounds for immediate hatred; but the fact that all but three tracks aren't even ear catching in the slightest, is actually offensive. Take note of these tracks, Prophecy, Persecution, and Nostradamus. Those three are the only three worth listening to, and Prophecy is more comical than balls out metal madness (seriously, I actually burst out laughing when I first heard that chorus). But again, just because a band that has been around longer than my parents tries something new, it doesn't make it terrible. There are very few riffs that even sound like they were written by Tipton and/or Downing. We all know what they are capable of, but it seems like they decided a project and concept as ambitious as this was above solid riffs, and instead needed a bunch of pointless string sections, piano, and synth guitars. What in the living dick were they thinking? \n\nLet me take a small detour here and tell y'all a story. Back when I was about 12, I had some friends, two brothers of Vietnamese descent. The older was my age, and the younger was about 9 or 10. One day, the young one came running up to me, laughing his ass off. He explains that he just caught his brother in his room making his dick look longer by molding Play-Doh on the end of it. In essence, he was making a penis extension out of clay. I shared that with you because I believe that there is no better way to describe all of the goddamn pointless interlude tracks. They do nothing except make the album longer. They're pointless, they're impractical, they don't function, they're ugly, they are nothing but penises made out of Play-Doh. This is one of the exact reasons I disliked Nightfall in Middle-Earth, and yet Judas Priest apparently decided to emulate the album in both physical and spiritual form.\n\nI say this because not only is it just a handful of mediocre and half assed songs mixed with a couple classics broken up by pointless interludes, but the story is completely convoluted and difficult to follow without prior knowledge of the concept. Nostradamus fares a little better here considering I knew the story beforehand, but it doesn't help that the album is arranged in a way that makes no sense at all. Why are there five tracks alloted to the segment about the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse? Was that even a big part in the life of Nostradamus? Why the hell is that section happening before he began making his quatrains? The story, while interesting, seems to be thrown together haphazardly and nearly ruins the album.\n\nAnd what the shoddy storytelling doesn't kill, the uninspired and/or boring music definitely does. There is absolutely no reason for Death or Alone to be nearly eight minutes long, especially when they are as stupidly boring as they are. It seems like they never got the song lengths right, and it severely hinders a lot of the enjoyment. For example, War is only five minutes long, but you start begging for it to end after about two minutes, the track would've actually worked better as one of those fucking interludes I hate so much. And what's even more annoying is when they actually meld the interlude into part of the main song. This would usually be something I'd enjoy, as it'd eliminate most of the pointless bullshit tracks, but the only fucking song they do that on is one of the only good ones (Persecution), therefore delaying anything good from coming out of your speakers. Also, don't believe any of the hype about Halford's voice still being in top form, it's not. He sounds like he's either straining to hit some of the higher notes in his lower octaves, or he's trying way to hard to convey emotion. Listen to Exiled, Revelations, Lost Love, New Beginnings, or pretty much any of the songs I didn't mention as being good, you'll see what I mean. Alone stands as one of the few hard rock songs on the album, and while it's enjoyable to a point (the chorus is catchy, that's about it), it drags on for far too long. Most of the tracks tend to plod along and never really drive the point home.\n\nWhat this means is that the highlights of the album are obviously the heavy metal monsters. The title track is a great song, and is definitely worthy of the Judas Priest moniker. Unlike twenty other tracks, Nostradamus doesn't meander about with boring riffs and sorrowful strings backing Halford's aging croons about whatever adversity he had to endure and whatnot. The title track actually starts off with a string melody and a really non-convincing emotional verse (you know, just like nearly every other song on the record), but after that it just fucking explodes. Rob Halford nails one of his trademark falsetto wails (the first time since Persecution nearly an hour beforehand) and the song just takes off. When you really break it down, it's just a watered down Painkiller, but that song is so damn awesome even watered down versions of it smoke most of anything else written nowadays. Even the synth guitar part about four minutes in that sounds like the boss battles from Final Fantasy VII is nothing but pure unadulterated asskickery. But again, this boot-to-ass mentality really only shines through here, Persecution, and the chorus to Prophecy, everything else is boring and just meanders about with no real purpose.\n\nHonestly, only pick this up if you have the Judas Priest logo tattooed on your ass. If nothing else, check out the title track and the outro to Persecution, as they are the only parts of the album good enough to bear the name of Priest. I think it's about time for the guys to hang up their robes and call it a career. I have a bad feeling that they'll pull some stunt like play this album in it's entirety on tour or something, as they seem extremely proud of their newest creation. Maybe I just don't want to accept this new direction and will constantly pray for another Hell Bent for Leather, but I find it hard to enjoy anything besides a couple tracks here, and three out of twenty three is a really bad percentage.\n",
        "\nJudas Priest- a name known by all metalheads. Releasing quality work like Stained Class and Sad Wings of Destiny, they helped define the image of metal. 3 years after releasing the ho-hum album Angel of Retribution, they have completely wiped the slate cleaned, using a new formula and releasing the concept double album Nostradamus. The music is something completely new for Judas Priest, and some hardcore fans may groan in nostalgia for the old Judas Priest.\n\nHowever, they have nothing to worry about. The music is still powerful, as usual. They used an orchestra and keyboards for some of their songs, which is something definitely out of the ordinary. There are 23 tracks total, with most of them having short, 1-2 minute introductions. Of the 14 tracks that are not interludes, most are straight up heavy metal, while some constitute as ballads.\nNow, onto the music itself. The first album starts out with a short symphonic introduction, then it goes into Prophecy, which is straight up metal. It\u2019s got heavy riffs, and Halford show\u2019s he\u2019s still got that vocal range. It doesn\u2019t feel like a traditional Judas Priest song- it\u2019s got more of an epic and mysterious vibe. Solos are present, and then an acoustic, calm interlude comes up. The next song, Revelations, is full of energy. This is the first symphonic heavy metal song that pops up on the album.\n\nThe rest of the album continues in a similar fashion. An interlude with Halford doing his thing, following a kick ass song (in most cases). I have a problem with Pestilence and Plague though- the chorus gets repetitive and in my case, gets on my nerves. The first ballad on this album is Lost Love, which is a pretty slow, beautiful (if not cheesy) song. Overall, the first Act was pretty damn good, especially for a band as old as Judas Priest. Some favorites include Persecution, Prophecy, and Death.\n\nThe second album picks up where the first album left off. In this point of the story, Nostradamus has been tried at court, and is exiled. The album starts off with an ambient introduction, flows into Exiled, a slow, yet heavy, song. I personally found this unmemorable, but still decent. The next song starts off slow, then it starts to pick up the beat. It sounds like a traditional heavy metal song, but it doesn\u2019t go with the flow in this album. Nevertheless, it\u2019s still a fine song.\n\nAt first I thought to myself \u201cWTF? The first part was awesome, what happened to the second part of the album?\u201d But then the action starts kicking in, with Visions. It\u2019s upbeat, full of power, and it\u2019s very catchy. To me, this is when the second Act starts to pick up its act. The next few song follow the same, powerful formula, especially the title song and Future of Mankind.\n\nAnd now to the lyrics. All I can say is WOW. I\u2019ve never known that Judas Priest can write lyrics and intelligent as these. Not that they don\u2019t make good lyrics, it\u2019s just that these are\u2026amazing. I give my kudos to them. Just read them over, and they revolve around an interesting concept- Nostradamus\u2019s life, his life after he was exiled, his death and how the world realizes how right he was; these people had to do some research on his life.\n\nGet this album. It\u2019s a great album made by the legends of metal. It has great music and lyrics. Other old and legendary bands have made some pretty good albums in their later years (Iron Maiden, A Matter of Life and Death; Celtic Frost; Monotheist), but you\u2019d never believe that after over 40 years, Judas Priest still have it, and they still deliver.\n\nPros- new formula (maybe not a pro for some) which feels powerful, Prophecy, Revelations, Visions, Nostradamus, Future of Mankind, first Judas Priest concept album, Halford still has it.\n\nCons- Too many fucking interludes, more solos here and there wouldn't hurt.\n",
        "\nJudas Priest is one of the most famous metal bands, a lot of people consider it to be one of the best metal bands ever... Are they right? Of course! British Steel is one of the most famous metal albums, a lot of people consider it to be one of the best metal albums ever... Are they right? In my opinion, they aren't. Personally, I consider this album to be one of Priest's worst and one of the weakest famous metal albums. Besides, I don't really consider it to be a metal album, it sounds more like hard rock to say the truth.\n\nThis album is extremely overrated. I can't believe that Priest went from awesome albums like Stained Class to this only 2 years later... They went from awesome metal songs with great riffs to simple hard rock songs with average riffs. I fail to understand why so many people consider it to be Priest's best album. My guess is that most of those people prefer 80's mainstream hard rock over 80's metal.\n\nThe bad:\n\nThe songs on this album are so ridiculously simple... Most of them have only 4 riffs in total and those riffs are nothing special compared to most of Priest's riffs from the 70's. Ok, there's nothing wrong with simple songs, but the songs aren't only simple, they're also nothing special or in other words, they aren't like most of Priest songs from the 70's. Breaking The Law is so overrated, I used to like it, but I got bored of it fast... Some people think that it has an awesome chorus, but what's so awesome about it exactly? Its one of the least melodic choruses ever! Just say 'breaking the law' 8 times and you have the chorus. Living After Midnight is pretty catchy, but its just a generic and cheesy rock song... Ok, I guess that it wasn't generic in the 80's, but its just a very average song. United has a catchy chorus, but that's it. You Don't Have To Be Old To Be Wise and Steeler are extremely forgettable.\n\nDid I mention that this album has some of Priest's weakest solos? Now I did. I guess that I should also mention that its one of their least melodic albums.\n\nThe good:\n\nThe best song on the album is definitely The Rage. Its actually a great song, it has a cool intro, a great main riff (the best riff on the album) and the verses are pretty catchy (the best verses on the album). Rapid Fire, Metal Gods and Grinder aren't bad either, but damn, they're really nothing special, they're really simple, there's nothing really original about them and they aren't anywhere near as good as most of Priest's songs from the 70's. I know that I'm repetitive with that, but it has to be said.\n\nSo, its 50/50, half of the album is very average and the other half is just good. There's nothing really bad on this album, but there's nothing awesome either, its just very average overall.\n\nNow, I have a question... How can anyone prefer songs like Breaking The Law and Living After Midnight over songs like Exciter, Beyond The Realms Of Death, Victim Of Changes, Sinner, Starbreaker... ? Ok, I understand if you're a fan of 80's mainstream hard rock, but otherwise I don't.\n\nThis album was nothing more than an attempt at becoming more famous. Thank god that Priest redeemed themselves with Screaming For Vengeance. Even Turbo is better than this album. \n\nDo I recommend it? Well, I guess that most of the people who look at this site have already heard it, but if you haven't, I don't recommend it, but I can't really tell you to avoid it because a lot of people like it, so maybe you'll like it.\n",
        "\nFirst of all I want to say that Iron Maiden and Judas Priest are my all time favourite bands. I just begin with this statement to make clear that it\u2019s really hard for me to be so critic with a Judas Priest album. Believe me, I don\u2019t like to say this, but \u201cNostradamus\u201d goes directly to the bench where my least favourite Judas Priest albums lie (\u201cRocka Rolla\u201d, \u201cPoint of Entry\u201d, \u201cJugulator\u201d and \u201cDemolition\u201d). Is this new album \u201cthat\u201d bad? In my opinion it is. Nothing should be working well if, since the first listen, I considered \u201cNostradamus\u201d as one of the worst five albums in the historic career of this British institution.\n\nI really adore Judas Priest, and I received Rob Halford\u2019s reunion as a great happening, as I\u2019ve been listening to them since 15 years ago and I never saw the \u201cclassic\u201d line-up back in the day (now I\u2019ve solved this problem, with the exception of Dave Holland). \u201cAngel of Retribution\u201d was a really solid album, offering some of the elements that we expected from Priest: fast cuts, some great Heavy Metal riffing, catchy choruses, the typical ballad\u2026 and after all it was a really good Heavy Metal album in the Priest tradition.\n\nWhat happens with \u201cNostradamus\u201d? As something has to happen with it, as my first moment of joy came with the last song of CD 1, \u201cPersecution\u201d, after almost 50 minutes of music (and don\u2019t think that I\u2019m referring to this song as an outstanding tune, no, it can only be considered an acceptable track). \n\nMy first thought goes directly to this fact fact: Judas Priest never did a concept album. And it\u2019s even worse if we realise that this is a double album. This fact should obey to a good reason: they don\u2019t know how to do concept albums. They\u2019re one of the best bands in the world writing Heavy Metal hits, but this task seems to be far from their possibilities. \n\nSecond fact: A concept album can work if you also include good songs on it. Will someone say that \u201cThe Clairvoyant\u201d, \u201cCan I play With Madness\u201d, \u201cThe Family Ghost\u201d, \u201cSleepless Nights\u201d, \u201cI Want Out\u201d, \"Eagle Fly Free\", \u201cChainsaw Charlie (Murders in the New Morgue)\u201d\u2026 (just to name a few) can not stand by themselves? \u201cNostradamus\u201d has not one single song to be considered as an outstanding track, worthy of being included in a set list with hymns as \u201cPainkiller\u201d, \u201cThe Sentinel\u201d, \u201cElectric Eye\u201d, \u201cBreaking the Law\u201d\u2026 (I can go on for hours). \n\nThird fact: The album ends being boring. Most of the songs have a mid paced rhythm that makes the structures really monotonous. The best Priest albums usually were a good combination of fast Power Metal songs, Heavy Metal anthems and some melodic mid tempos and ballads. \u201cNostradamus\u201d lacks of this \u201cvariation\u201d offered in previous albums presenting a really boring dynamic for most of the songs.\n\nFourth fact: If the songs are boring, what can I say about the interludes? They slow down the album dynamic even more. Really slow melodic pieces guided by Rob\u2019s vocals, quite beautiful, but they insist in the global softness of the whole album.\n\nFifth fact: The keyboards. Their presence is predominant during the 23 songs, sometimes even bringing the band close to Symphonic Metal. This is another element that contributes to make me think in \u201cNostradamus\u201d as a bland, boring and uninspired album that won\u2019t be well accepted by most of the traditional Priest fans. \n\nRob\u2019s performance during the whole album is excellent. We have to take notice that his voice does not sound as 20 years ago, but he perfectly knows how far he can go, showing a really professional and consistent work in all the songs. Rob\u2019s vocals are probably the highlight of the album. What about the rest of the guys? Unfortunately I have to say that \u201cNostradamus\u201d won\u2019t trascend as one of the best performances given by Glenn, K.K. and Scott. Obviously there\u2019s nothing wrong with them, they are really skilled musicians, but the album lacks of brilliant moments in the instrumental aspect, we won't find killer guitar solos, thundering drumming... I\u2019m not forgetting Ian Hill but, as everyone familiar with Priest should know, he has always remained in a second level in the instrumental weight of the band.\n\nEven the production sounds a bit lifeless this time. I\u2019ve compared this album with \u201cAngel of Retribution\u201d, listening to both in a row, and their previous effort roars like a thunder compared with \u201cNostradamus\u201d.\n\nAfter all, in my opinion, \u201cNostradamus\u201d can only be considered as an album for the Judas Priest completists, all the rest won\u2019t find anything particularly interesting here. Those braves who want to listen to the whole album in a row, will have a hard time arriving to the end, but that will be a mistake as the best songs can be found in CD 2.\n\nBelieve me, it\u2019s really hard for me to write a hard review about Judas Priest but, after giving some opportunities to the whole album, I don\u2019t think that I\u2019ll change my mind on \u201cNostradamus\u201d. \n\nAnd one more thing, what the hell have they done with their logo? The cover art is so terrific\u2026\n\nHighlights: Persecution, Alone, Visions, Nostradamus, Future of Mankind.\n\nLow points: all the rest.\n",
        "\nExpectations were fairly high when Halford returned to Judas Priest. After all, was the band ready to deliver a \u201cPainkiller\u201d part II? Had the band the motivation, the will and the talent to compose another great record? And so, is \u201cAngel of Retribution\u201d any good?\n\nYes, it is good, that's for sure, it is a very good record, in fact. This album still sounds somewhat fresh and powerful, the typical heavy metal the band had performed for years blending perfectly with a pure classical rock sound deeply incorporated in this piece. \u201cWheels of Fire\u201d is a perfect example of a song that while containing many heavy metal elements, still carries a strong classic rock vibe. The variety of \u201cAngel of Retribution\u201d is also a plus, with the presence of some ballads and even an epic number, which speaks about the Lochness monster (how power metal-ish, boy!).\n\nHalford can't do that high pitched screams often again and that is clearly shown here: don't expect a Painkiller-like performance by him, bear in mind that he's older now. He still delivers a very nice performance, though, songs like \u201cAngel\u201d benefit a lot from his emotional, heartfelt performance: he still sounds passionate and lively throughout the entire record, good work, Rob! The same thing goes to the pair of guitar players, as this record is filled with intense riffage and blazing solos... Ok, not as blazing and intense as the ones on, say, \u201cMetal Meltdown\u201d, but still energic and headbangable. Scott Travis is not the monster he used to be (at least the performance here doesn't match the level of intensity he was able to put into the music in some of his past performances), but still a solid player, expect lots of double-bass parts and such.\n\nHighlights? There are no weak songs here, nor pure masterpieces, but there are some great numbers that are absolutely worth mentioning. \u201cJudas Rising\u201d mananges to be a pretty good and intense opener, thanks to the raw drum work of a powerful Travis and to the catchy chorus: \u201cJudas is risiiiiiing\u201d! Yeah, I think so! \u201cDeal with the Devil\u201d is another powerful song, a typical heavy metal take filled with some good solos, recalling the golden past of the band. Another saddly underrated song is \u201cHellrider\u201d that despite sharing a similar intro with \u201cJudas is Rising\u201d is a great track, one of the heaviest of the album. Its lyrics also recall the Painkiller times (\u201cHellrider\u201d - \u201cHell Patrol\u201d). All those songs also benefit from a pretty good production, which highlights the guitar work and the vocals. The bass is, again, inaudible, but oh well...\n\u201cDemonizer\u201d is, simply put, the best aggressive, straight forward song of the album, its outro absolutely brings the track to heaven (\u201cDemonizer!! Out, out Demons out!\u201d - fantastic vocals, indeed).\n\nHowever, there's also a couple of more calm, more laid-back songs, that still sound pretty good, and turn this album into a varied listening experience. \u201cAngel\u201d is a nice little piece, even containing some tasteful acoustic guitar licks and also featuring a passionate vocal performance. \u201cWorth Fighting For\u201d, despite also being a ballad, is a bit different, mainly because of the use of the drums, since \u201cAngel\u201d is a 100% drum-free tune. Anyways, \u201cWorth Fighting For\u201d isn't a great song, all in all, despite being the one where the bass guitar is more audible (tehre's even a bass intro, yay!). \u201cWheels of Fire\u201d, despite being a lot heavier than, say, \u201cAngel\u201d, is a bit different than the other powerful, straight forward songs of the album, as it is one of the tracks that carries a lot of classic rock elements, the same thing going to \u201cRevolution\u201d, the single, a tune that is INSANELY catchy and vicious. About \u201cLochness\u201d, it sounds like a decent, almost atmospheric, metal take, but not a masterpiece, far from it unfortunately. The chorus is pretty epic, though, but the song could be better if it was written about some other subject. Meh, I guess that there are other bands that write even more stupid lyrics, so nevermind.\n\nConclusion: after years and years of composing music, Judas Priest manages to create a new album that still sounds fresh and interesting, after all. Forget Halford's high pitched screams of the past and prepare yourself for a varied and tasteful listening experience with \u201cAngel of Retribution\u201d. The production is amazing and there are no really weak tracks, so every song is solid in its own way and deserves a listen. Another good album by one of the bands responsible for the creation of one of the best music genres ever: heavy metal (the Manowar spirit!).\n\nBest Moments of the CD:\n-The explosion of \u201cJudas is Rising\u201d.\n-the breakdown of \u201cRevolution\u201d.\n\nDecent, solid and worth listening, all in all.\n",
        "\n...but rip a couple of songs first. If this were two separate albums it would be: Disc one \"50,\" disc two \"87.\" It's not sooo bad, then again it's not exactly Priest in the East.\n\nThis is their third official live album and it's also the first, if not the only, one with Tim 'Ripper' Owens. I actually like him, he's not Halford, that's a fact. He CAN sing like Halford but he puts his own little twists. Listen to \"The Ripper\" or \"VICTIM OF CHAAAAAANGEEES!\" and tell me that he sucks donkey balls. Among the other songs in this rather strange show is \"Rapid Fire(!),\" \"A Touch of EEEEVIL!\" \"Metal Meltdown,\" and a very special version of \"Diamonds and Rust\" this one being more faithful to the original. As of now, the band no longer plays the 70s version very often or at all, *sigh* I really liked that version. Owens is in top form in those songs, he is a remarkable singer and I'm definitely glad that Priest chose him over Scheepers.\n\nThe production is quite good, although the guitar tone leaves much to be desired. I'm not sure if the guitars are tuned real low or the guitar tone is too thick, but the guitars sound awfully muddy especially during the riffs. The bass...Aw c'mon guys! Give Poor Ian a break! He's not often audible though you CAN hear him, you just have to actively listen to him. The drums are very clear, but it's a little 'low' in the mix. The vocals benefit considerably from the production. I'm pretty sure Priest produced it like this just so they can say \"Hey, Owens is a great singer!\"\n\nBeing a double live album, this kind of suffers from the setlist. Disc one is kind of blah, except for a couple of songs. Rip \"Rapid Fire (now with chorus),\" \"The Ripper,\" \"Beyond the Realms of Death(!)\" and \"The Hellion/Electric Eye\" before throwing it to the bin. The second disc is actually the best part of this album. All the Priest classics are in the second disc: \"Hellbent for Leather,\" \"Painkiller,\" the aforementioned \"Victim of CHAAAAAANGEEES!\" Damn, what a selection.\n\nNow folks, I wouldn't recommend you to buy this at full price. Buy it used, or borrow it. Or buy the DVD instead.\n",
        "\nMany so-called 'professional' reviewers have bashed this album for being of very inferior quality and showcasing Judas Priest rapidly declining as a band. Well, I say fuck them, because Priest really comes alive on this album!\nThe album contains a decent mix of old and new songs, good and bad ones\nThe tracks range between ones that suck, and have always sucked, like 'Out in the Cold' and 'Turbo Lover', songs that sound pretty much like the originals, albeit with a crowd of fans going nuts, like 'Some Heads Are Gonna Roll' and 'Heading Out to the Highway', and songs that actually work out really good as live tracks, 'Metal Gods' and, especially, 'Living After Midnight' really stand out here.\n\nOne of the coolest things about livealbuma is, obviously, the whole 'live feeling', and that works out really well on this album. Hearing the crowd go crazy shouting 'Priest! Priest! Priest! Priest!' and their satisfied cheering when Halford reveals one classic after another is something really awesome.\nSome tracks, most obviously 'Breaking the Law', suffer from the mistake that many bands do live: it's played at a way way way too fast speed, which suits it really badly, and destroys the otherwise so beloved riff...\nOn the other hand, when 'Living After Midnight' kicks off, I tend to get goosebumps because of the collective shouts from the crowd - a really really awesome feeling. Also, the solo in the song has been changed and is a great improvement over the original.\n\nThere are almost no of Judas Priest's early songs present on the album - actually there are none from the pre-British Steel era, so this works nice as a continuation where Unleashed in the East left off.\n\nSome of Halford's speeches honestly tend to get annoying at times, when he for the sixth time starts shouting 'Let me hear you say OH YEAH!' and you start thinking 'get on with it already!'.\nHowever, these things are insignificant and overall this IS a very good live record, and can be recommended to any Priest fan that like this stuff from British Steel and up.\n",
        "\nIt's kind of sad that K.K. and Glen keep improving over the years while Rob seems to be losing his voice. This DVD was released, according to the liner notes, to celebrate more than 30 years (wow they're old!) of Priest and the \"Unleashed in the East\" record. The DVD does not contain bonus features, odd since it's pretty much a standard for a DVD to have a bonus. Even Deicide's \"When London Burns\" had one bonus. \n\nBut I digress, The DVD makes up for it with a quality tracklist that would pretty much please every Priest fan. It seems though they never play \"Rocka Rolla\" ever, 'cuz there is no live album or video that has any \"Rocka Rolla\" tracks. Ah well, never really liked that album anyway. The other albums are represented with at least one track, I forgot but I think they left out one more album. Oh and obviously the Tim Owens stuff is not here, shame 'cuz I really liked \"Cathedral Spires\".\n\nOn to the performance. The DVD is filmed in Budokan and there is a LOT of people in attendance. But the audience doesn't do anything other than the odd headbanger in the front row. Seriously the Japanese are weird folk for going to a concert (we're talking about Priest here, how can they just stand around?) and not do anything other than clap at odd moments. \n\nThe band starts with \"The Hellion/Electric Eye\" combo which they've done at nearly every concert so why did they split it into two tracks in the album? I see no point for that. Okay, the stage backdrop is a giant electric eye and first it starts to shoot lasers at the crowd as if scanning them. After a while, the guitars start playing with a backing track. K.K., Glen, Ian and Scott then come on to the stage before \"Electric Eye\" starts, Halford later appears from the electric eye. The band performs admirably, as Priest should, for the entire concert although Rob Halford seems to struggle to hit the high notes, particularly \"Painkiller\" he looks like he's about to die.\n\nThe DVD is a bit cheesy at times with the transition effects and multiple angles of the same person (I swear there was a shot of Halford from the side and from the front at the same time). Now as I said before, this DVD is a great video for the fans because of the songs. The old songs are done well although \"Diamonds and Rust\" is not the \"Unleashed in the East\" version but a more faithful cover to the original, personally I like the other version better. It's very nice to have four great songs in a row near the end (\"Victim of Changes\" to \"Hell Bent for Leather\"). Of course Halford comes in a motorcycle for \"Hell Bent for Leather\" which makes the crowd cheer and shout.\n\nOverall: This DVD is a great recording of the band. Although Halford struggles to hit the high notes, he puts on a great performance for a man in his 60s. The band also performs excellently, particularly the guitar duo that is K.K. and Glen. The drums ain't bad either (hey it's Travis). But poor Ian is rarely audible but he makes up for it with stage presence. The DVD could've been 87-94 if they had some bonus features, maybe a retrospective of Priest or \"Unleashed in the East\" which is what they were celebrating according to the liner.\n\nI don't consider this worthy of a full price purchase. If you find it used or dirt cheap or a friend yours wants to give it to you, then go ahead. Again it's not a bad DVD it's just lacking in the features department.\n",
        "\n... but not especially good.\n\nThis one takes a lot of pounding even from hardcore fans of the band, and it's pretty easy to see why: this record is the culmination of the pop-metal style pioneered by the band on Killing Machine. It's also the last record Priest would create in that vein; following the critical failure of this album upon its release the band would return with a 'vengeance' on the follow-up. Nevertheless, Point of Entry is not bad for what it is, and I regard it as far superior to the other 'infamous' album by this line-up, Turbo.\n\nThe most famous track from this album is also the opener, and \"Heading Out to the Highway\" is just as good as any other opening track that Priest has recorded. It captures succinctly the feeling of traveling through the desert to escape from the modern world, a feeling that any metalhead worth the title can agree with. The next track, \"Don't Go\", is much more atypical of Priest, with a strange clockwork grove to it which has earned it the hatred of many fans. I thoroughly enjoy it nevertheless, even the oddly proletarian vocal delivery of Halford. \"Hot Rockin'\" closes out the trifecta of singles from this album, and it sounds essentially like a slightly more metallic successor to \"Living After Midnight\" from the last album, with the same vapid party theme and the same instrumental virtuosity.\n\n\"Turning Circles\" opens with a strange guitar line that sounds almost to me like something an alternative rock band would play, but quickly evolves into a tolerable, if not especially memorable, slow burn. \"Desert Plains\" is one of several oddball songs on this piece, sounding interestingly enough like late-60's psychedelic rock ala Iron Butterfly recorded somewhere in Death Valley (note: this album has a definite 'arid' atmosphere, and does a pretty good job capturing it). One of my favorite tracks on the record. \"Solar Angels\" opens with a tremendous chugging sound before erupting into an even sunnier psychedelic rapture than the preceding track. Halford's vocal delivery has rarely been more emotional or powerful than here, and combines with the music to create what I can only call a sun-baked, spiraling cathedral of sound. This, together with the previous song, is my favorite cut on the album.\n\nUnfortunately the record takes a tremendous dip in value with the last four pieces, with not a single song being note-worthy. \"Troubleshooter\" seems to be regarded in certain circles as a 'lost classic', but I don't buy it. \"On The Run\" is occasionally listed as a fan-favorite also, but it sounds to these ears as a fairly generic piece of power-rock with an interesting vocal line which alone redeems it from mediocrity. None of these cuts are particularly bad, just not rave-worthy. This would itself be admirable -- if this were not Judas Priest.\n\nOn the whole, I'd not recommend this to anyone not already a fan of the group. It has quite a few gems, but also a lot of baggage. I will say in its favor that it is not nearly as 'poppy' as many make it out to be, and sounds more experimental than anything else. A worthy buy for the long-term Priesthead, but it's not going to be winning any converts any time soon.\n",
        "\nNo time like the present to explain why I worship the Priest. Off the top of my head, I can't think of any other band that has managed to release a substantial catalogue of 15 studio albums, each of which manages to be distinct from the other whilst shifting dramatically between styles amongst groups of albums, and yet still remains distinctly Heavy Metal - Judas Priest style. Angel Of Retribution continues this pattern, and does so very well if you ask me. But will there be new elements that could put off some listeners? Eyes down to find out, dear reader...\n\nThis album seems to be a microcosm of Priest's entire career, in the way that it shifts between styles. This is not to say that different songs on here sound overtly like they're from older albums. Though heavier songs such as Demonizer and Hellrider have the aggressive, razor-sharp elements of Ram It Down and Painkiller, and the relatively more laid-back songs hark back to the catchy yet punchy British Steel era, this is a distinctly new Priest album.\nThe album has it's own distinct sound, and does the full range of traditional Heavy Metal songwriting within it. Angel redeems every soppy ballad you've heard dragging down a Metal album with evocative lyrics and a brilliantly paced crescendo throughout the song. Worth Fighting For and Wheels Of Fire represent a laid-back, 'driving music' style of rocking - the former quietly, almost semi-acoustically (in terms of lack of distortion, not campfire guitars), while the latter packs more punch with distorted chugga riffing. From there we have the middle ground rockers that should please everyone, including the chorus-filled Revolution. Anthemic stadium rocker or just too repetitive with the choruses? It just boils down to how you feel about those kind of songs! The heaviness is upped with the aforementioned Demonizer and Hellrider, before culminating with the epic Lochness. Clocking in at 13 minutes (16 if you count the brooding, tranquil Eulogy preceeding it), it's length alone is a first for Priest. It lumbers along almost like the beast it describes - awkwardly? Maybe. Helping ground this monstrosity is a crazy pinch-harmonic riff, something I haven't heard from Priest before, unless I happily overlooked it on one of the Ripper albums. All in all, something for everyone. Luckily it all merges together into a coherant whole - no good having something for everyone if they hate the stuff that doesn't suit their exact taste.\n\nI feel obliged to point out the 15 years between this and Rob Halford's previous album with Priest, Painkiller. What's apparent from his return? For starters, the shriek from bygone years seems to be reserved for the choir of backing vocals. The lead vocals are mostly mid-range, though all the different pitches in the background suggest that Rob had great fun in the studio making all sorts of noises. A Fight-esque grunt is even apparent on Hellrider, indeed some of the riffing is reminiscent of the Fight project. However, they do not dominate the album. The traditional twin lead guitar attack is still the cornerstone of Judas Priest, and Glenn and K.K. do more than just trade solos here. Lots of meedly-meedly playing off each other, yes please.\nSomething else older fans will pick up on is the recycling of lyrical ideas from previous albums. The Hellion, Painkiller, sad wings, the Tyrant ramming it down, the Sentinel's stained class...it's all there. The lyrical theme of Deal With The Devil even harks back to Made In Hell from Halford's Resurrection album. The continued association of Halford with producer Roy Z gives the album a thick and chunky sound similar to that of Resurrection, and don't we just love the way it leaps out of the speaker. Do we? (some don't...) *ahem* anyway...recycling lyrics...lazy and unrewarding to hear? I dunno...when you're familiar with the artwork and sounds associated with these, it helps to evoke some pretty dramatic images. Take it as you will.\n\nMaybe it's a loaded review, because as a Priest fan I'm instantly going to jump on what's good about the album. I do honestly think, though, that Angel Of Retribution pulls off enough tricks to satisfy both the grizzled, bitter old fan, and the n00b. Bring on the next one and another tour passing through Plymouth, I say. Can't get enough of this stuff...\n\nOriginally written for http://www.metalmongrel.com\n",
        "\nI really like this album... No... I actually LOVE it. It's one of my favourite albums ever. The only problem is, that it's not Judas Priest. Well, of course it's them, but the feel, the sound and the music is just not Priest. The album is soft and inspired by the 70's progressive rockbands. I have heard from people that the songs in \"real life\" e.g. when played live, where a lot more powerful, and I easily can imagine that. But for me, there's nothing missing on this album with the production, sound and songs, except that I am a bit dissapointed since Caviar and Meths (which is actually a great short track) were supposed to be an epic 10 minutes+ song. It was later released by Priest's first singer Al Atkins on his album Victims of Changes in a long version (around 8 minutes).\n\nIt should be noted that some of the CD-issues of this albums has wrong track-splits in Winter, Deep Freeze and Winter Retreat, where Deep Freeze is actually the last bit of Winter, and Winter Retreat is both Deep Freeze and Winter Retreat.\n\nThe first track \"One for the Road\" is simply just one for the road. Nothing special here, just a hard rocking track.\n\nRocka Rolla, the title track, clocks in at 3:06 making it a short track compared to the others on the album, but it still is one of the strongest on the album. The sound is rocking, though there is a bit hiss on the production. The lead-guitar solo stuff that starts around 1 minute sounds a bit \"happy\" but still work very good with the song.\n\nWinter - Starts out quietly where Halford sings some lyrics that's hard to hear. Then the song it self starts out and contains one of the best, most rocking riffs on the album. This is also the first time we really hear Halford's voice with the caracteristic sharp tone, though it's not the classic Priest scream. The guitar, bass and vocals stops and a quite boring and not very talented drum \"solo\" is added, until a bridge riff make the song return back to the inital riff and a final verse.\n\nDeep Freeze - Just some guitar play-around in a couple of minutes. I cant really see the reason to include this track on the album, when Caviar and Meths could have been longer, and would have been more important to include.\n\nWinter Retreat - Short song, with soft sound and lyrics. Nothing special, though you hear a side of Halford's voice you never heard before.\n\nCheater - Great song and in my opinion it has the most catchy line: \"She was a cheater!\" Well... You'll have to hear it to understand.\n\nNever Statisfied - A track with a very weak sound on the guitars. I think it would be a great rock song with more power. The guitars just fall in with the drums and bass, and doesn't really creat any melody or such. Even with the powerless sound it's in my opinion a very very good track. After the first part of the song, it moves over to the most heavy riff on the whole album, the best in my opinion. A solo is played and the song returns to it's initial riffs and sound.\n\nRun of the mill - The track is slow, quiet and somehow relaxing and has got a bluesy feel to it. It's too long though. At 8:32 it could easily have been cut a minute or two. The intro is in my opinion not necessary, as is the very very very long solo part in the middle. I think this mostly because I am a bit dissapointed that Caviar and Meths were not included on the album in it's intended length. If they had room for both tracks on the album, they should definitely not cut this one. It's still a good song. At the end you really hear halfords voice screaming with power, and that's something i really enjoy with this track.\n\nDying to meet you - A track with two parts, that I actually think could have been to different songs, since the first part is a bit in the same lane as run of the mill with slow riffs and soft sound/voice. Halfords voice in this part, is quite deep and I actually think this is one of his best vocal performances that I have ever experienced. The second part is faster and with Halford singing a lot higher than before.\n\nCaviar and Meths - I think I have mentioned it a couple of times above. This track should have been included in it's originally inteded long run. Still this short instrumental part of the original track, is actually very awesome. I think it could have been extended and maybe even have been made to an instrumental Priest track. It's soft, relaxing, simple and yet very melodic. Because of it's short length (2 minutes) I often play it two or three times just to enjoy the soft and relaxing feel it has to it.\n",
        "\nIf you were to ask a random metal fan to name the one album that they believed defined metal music, chances are many would reply \u201cNumber of the Beast\u201d, \u201cParanoid\u201d, \u201cBritish Steel\u201d or even \u201cMaster of Puppets\u201d. Few would reply with Judas Priest's 1978 masterpiece \u201cStained Class\u201d, an album heavily underrated by all but the more dedicated Priest fans for reasons unknown. Sabbath may have played the first metal riff ever back in 1970 but it was Judas Priest's \u201cStained Class\u201d which stripped away the blues influence and pushed metal in a new direction. From the blazing fast opener \u201cExciter\u201d to the thrashy mid-paced \u201cSaints in Hell\u201d, one can see/hear the huge influence this album alone has had on metal.\n\n\u201cStained Class\u201d features in my opinion, the band at its peak. Halford's voice may not be as high as it is on Painkiller but he sings with such energy and passion (check out that scream at the very end of Beyond the Realms of Death for evidence!) that one can overlook that small detail. This album also holds some of Glenn Tipton's and KK Downing's best solos and riffs. No one can deny the the quality of Tipton's solos in \u201cBeyond the Realms of Death\u201d or \u201cExciter\u201d, nor can they deny the influence on thrash metal of that intense riffing around 3 minutes into \u201cSaints in Hell\u201d. Les Binks' drumming is also top notch. While the vastly underrated Binks may not hit the drumkit as hard as Scott Travis would 12 years later, his fills are always interesting without being self indulgent. Ian Hill's bass unfortunately is barely audible in the majority of the tracks although it is solid, if not spectacular on the few songs it can be heard in. \n\nAnother strong point of this album are the lyrics. After listening to British Steel, Ram it Down or even Painkiller one could be forgiven for thnking that the band were incapable of writing meaningful lyrics. However, that was not always the case. With the lyrics touching on topics such as colonialism in \u201cSavage\u201d and suicide in \u201cBeyond the Realms of Death\u201d this would be the band's last album before the lyrics would move in a more commercial direction. \n\nIn conclusion this is a heavy metal masterpiece that every metal fan should pick up, even if only to hear the influence it has had on whatever their favourite metal band may be. It is consistent from start to finish and there is bound to be something in it for everyone. Make sure to pick up the remastered version as it features the only official live version of \u201cBetter By You, Better Than Me\u201d (the infamous \u201csuicide song\u201d) that the band has released.\n\nStandout tracks:\nAs mentioned previously, this album is consistently strong but \u201cExciter\u201d, \u201cStained Class\u201d, \u201cSavage\u201d and \u201cBeyond the Realms of Death\u201d would be the songs that stick out to me personally.\n\nWeak tracks:\nNone, although \u201cInvader\u201d is the weakest track of the album in my opinion.\n",
        "\nReleased in 1976 when the popularity of heavy metal was beginning to wane, Judas Priest\u2019s second album injected new life, speed and energy into the genre, and along with its successors paved the way for what would ultimately be defined as the New Wave of British Heavy Metal. Still commonly regarded as one of the band\u2019s finest releases, it was unarguably a vast improvement over the messy and long-forgotten debut \u2018Rocka Rolla,\u2019 abandoning its blues-tinged, hard rock sound \u2013 for the most part \u2013 in favour of a highly charged approach that was in equal shares melodic and aggressive, based on the shrieking vocal talents of Rob Halford and the dual guitar harmonies and discordance of Glenn Tipton and K. K. Downing.\n\nEven at first glance, with the album\u2019s hellish cover art, vicious song titles and new gothic logo, it\u2019s clear that Judas Priest has begun to define itself as a heavy metal band rather than the slightly confused hippies who recorded an album in 1974, and the presence of old live favourites from the early seventies (refused inclusion on the previous album due to the incompetence of producer Rodger Bain) makes this in some ways the first \u2018true\u2019 Judas Priest album, although ownership disputes with Gull Records sadly mean that the band still won\u2019t receive any of the proceeds for albums released before \u2018Sin After Sin.\u2019 More focused than its predecessor, \u2018Sad Wings of Destiny\u2019 still finds time to experiment with softer songs and longer compositions comprised of numerous changes, while the arguable song cycle that leads to its conclusion may demonstrate that the interest in lofty and progressive ideals has not been entirely eliminated by the desire to achieve commercial success.\n\nA peculiar feature of this release is that its two original sides on the vinyl LP were switched around when the time came to re-issue the album on CD, causing the original opening \u2018Prelude\u2019 to be moved to the fifth track. This move was probably for the best, as the first few songs are among the band\u2019s most popular, still being live staples today, and \u2018Deceiver\u2019 wouldn\u2019t really work as a satisfying ending in the same way that \u2018Island of Domination\u2019 achieves, while making the opening fade-in of \u2018Victim of Changes\u2019 more relevant in its new context. Of course, any stubborn fans intent on recreating the original experience can simply stick the CD player on repeat, start from track five, and stop complaining.\n\n1. Victim of Changes\n2. The Ripper\n3. Dreamer Deceiver\n4. Deceiver\n5. Prelude\n6. Tyrant\n7. Genocide\n8. Epitaph\n9. Island of Domination\n\nOriginally under the title of \u2018Whiskey Woman,\u2019 \u2018Victim of Changes\u2019 is undeniably one of the most well-loved and accomplished Judas Priest songs, so it\u2019s regrettable that my initial response has to be: \u2018this isn\u2019t as good as the live version.\u2019 The same could be said for many tracks later released on the definitive \u2018Unleashed in the East\u2019 live album, however inauthentic and plagued by studio tampering that may be, but this song in particular has a long tradition of excelling in the live format, explaining its presence on the \u2018Metal Works\u2019 compilation in place of this original. It\u2019s a great song split into several parts, though the transitions are all smooth and natural, with some classic riffs and great solo spots for the guitars, the bass and in particular the ear-piercing screams of Rob Halford. The resurgence of the main riff towards the end in the lead-up to his final screams has to be one of the best executed moments in the band\u2019s entire discography, but this song really does suffer from the lack of crowd interaction in the quieter and slower moments. An excellent heavy metal song, but one that could never be successfully captured onto disc.\n\n\u2018The Ripper\u2019 is Priest\u2019s classic short piece about Jack the Knife, led primarily by Halford\u2019s squeaking narrative and with one of the band\u2019s most memorable choruses. The simplicity of this song is its real charm, ushering in an entirely New Wave of British Heavy Metal without even knowing it, and clearly directly inspiring much of what Iron Maiden did in the first few years, both musically and thematically. The central section features a cool creeping guitar riff that speeds up subtly as it goes, which may or may not be attempting to imitate the eponymous Ripper\u2019s stalking antics, though I like to think that it is. Once again, Halford lets rip a piercing scream at the end for good measure. Wisely, the next song \u2018Dreamer Deceiver\u2019 takes a complete detour from the sounds already established, beginning with a murky acoustic guitar and soft singing that sets an effective tranquil atmosphere. Once again, this can be traced as the direct inspiration for many softer metal songs from the late seventies to the present day, even if it gets a little dull and repetitive along the way. Halford\u2019s more energetic screams in the second half are a nice touch, and work strangely well despite the rest of the music staying the same, and there\u2019s a really long and mellow guitar solo that I can\u2019t help but love.\n\nConfusingly and unwisely bearing a similar title to the previous song, \u2018Deceiver\u2019 was formerly the final song of the album (see earlier explanation), but works much better being shoved into the middle, where its mediocrity doesn\u2019t really get in the way. It isn\u2019t a bad song, it\u2019s just disappointingly generic after the great pieces that have come so far, the riff failing to stay memorable for sounding just like every other medium speed guitar line the band would play throughout the seventies. Things become much more interesting with the ominous \u2018Prelude,\u2019 a little strange in the middle of the album but nonetheless perfect in bringing in the second half of offerings. The deep, booming piano is joined by a church organ and high guitar, leading into one of the finest songs of the album, the suitably monstrous \u2018Tyrant.\u2019 This song showcases everything that was great about Priest\u2019s classic early period, with a great heavy riff, slow and pounding chorus and an irresistible break into a second, lesser-used chorus that\u2019s as fun as hell. To make things even better, Tipton and Downing execute a full dual guitar solo, remaining ever so slightly out of tune with each other in a performance that really has to be heard. Unlike the first song, I can\u2019t specifically remember whether the \u2018Unleashed in the East\u2019 version is superior, but in this instance the record really does it justice.\n\nAlthough technically not associated, the similar subject matter of \u2018Genocide\u2019 has always linked this song with its predecessor in my mind, perhaps exacerbated by the lofty \u2018Prelude\u2019 deceiving me into delusions of a song cycle along the lines of the first album\u2019s \u2018Winter\u2019 suite. This song essentially stands alone as another cool, early metal song, but it somehow lacks the energy of \u2018Tyrant\u2019 and the earlier pieces until the very end where everything speeds up and Halford has to yell along at an exhausting pace. Thankfully, perhaps sensing that the sound has started to become repetitive, the album offers up its greatest deviation yet with the entirely piano- and vocal-led \u2018Epitaph.\u2019 This is bound to be a very challenging song for Priest fans or metal fans in general, as the performance by Tipton (on piano) and Halford severs all connections to the sound being pioneered elsewhere on the recording, though overall the experiment is a success. Supplementing his deep croon with a very strange higher pitch in the chorus that sounds almost like a choirboy, Halford is impressive here, if not quite at his best. It\u2019s an interesting song to break the album up, but not really the sort of thing anyone would get this CD out of their collection specifically to listen to. A nice touch is that it fades directly into the final song \u2018Island of Domination\u2019 (again, not helping my paranoia in searching for patterns and song suites that aren\u2019t really there). The energy of \u2018Tyrant\u2019 is back, even if this song doesn\u2019t live up to the monumental task of beating that earlier classic, but it\u2019s still a great song based on all the usual ingredients: shrieking Halford and a pounding chorus. The band considered re-recording this for the follow-up album \u2018Sin After Sin\u2019 for some reason, but there isn\u2019t any problem with the original.\n\n\u2018Sad Wings of Destiny\u2019 is a heavy metal classic, though one that may take some getting used to for younger fans or those more accustomed to modern music. It\u2019s a melodic and very heavy album, though not in the way a Suffocation album is heavy, and despite the praise heaped onto the later \u2018British Steel\u2019 release, leaves behind most of the blues influence of early heavy metal (exempting songs such as \u2018Victim of Changes\u2019 which were old live favourites), paving the way for the fast and catchy metal of the early eighties that are more commonly accredited to the punk explosion. The few weak songs and unsuccessful experiments prevent it from being my personal favourite Priest album, and the inclusion of superior live versions of some songs on the excellent \u2018Unleashed in the East\u2019 a few years later makes these studio recordings a little redundant. Still, this is a great source for those songs and many others, containing definitive heavy metal classics and some great unknown treats too.\n",
        "\nThe first release from Judas Priest is quite different from the sound and image they would very soon become associated with, as the loud young Brummies ditched their hippie look, prog aspirations and disappointing drummer and producer to begin recording the definitive albums of early heavy metal. \u2018Rocka Rolla\u2019 is an infamously flawed record, but this is largely due to unexpected problems with the studio equipment and personnel more than the material, which is often of a surprisingly high standard. Even if the band members themselves look down on this release, they are the first to admit that there are some great early classics scattered throughout... it\u2019s just that the whole thing doesn\u2019t sound quite right.\n\nHaving established a large local fan-base with their loud, melodic, masculine rock, the burgeoning Judas Priest were quickly manhandled into a studio and assigned the famous local record producer Rodger Bain, whose results with the early albums of their contemporaries Black Sabbath are justifiably praised. Gull Records were confident that Bain would capture the heavy sound they were hoping to promote and gave him totalitarian control of the recording process, something the band looks back on as a big mistake as they were completely under his thumb. Nevertheless, it was a decision they were understandably content and confident to go along with at the time, if it meant paving the path to fame. Unfortunately, Bain\u2019s eventual results were severely disappointing, failing to capture the energy of the studio and ending up with a very thin sound that affected all the instruments. He also unwisely, and for whatever reason, decided to eliminate the band\u2019s most popular songs from the track-list, requiring them to come up with what often sounds like filler, rather than the timeless material that would eventually find its way onto \u2018Sad Wings of Destiny,\u2019 commonly seen as the first \u2018real\u2019 Priest album.\n\n\u2018Rocka Rolla\u2019 should not be easily written off, especially as part of the band\u2019s problem with the album is their lack of ownership or royalties from its sales, something Gull Records have taken full advantage of over the years with far too many re-releases attempting in vain to remedy a thirty-year-old problem with new technology. The band\u2019s dissatisfaction even extends to the original cover art, a bottlecap design with the album\u2019s title written in copy-cat Coca Cola font, which for some reason they later decided to swap for Mel Grant\u2019s \u2018The Steel Tsar,\u2019 an average-looking image that may have had the right apocalyptic message, but wasn\u2019t quite as cool or distinctive as the original, especially as Grant\u2019s painting had also been used for a book of the same name, and for a random early video game box. The band\u2019s dislike of the album\u2019s overall style may be due to its association more with traditional rock than metal, something that is partially appropriate in this mixed bag of radio-friendly pop rock and high-concept suites. It may lack the distinctive Priest sound, but it\u2019s an interesting listen, and it\u2019s clear the band is really onto something.\n\n1. One for the Road\n2. Rocka Rolla\n3. Winter\n4. Deep Freeze\n5. Winter Retreat\n6. Cheater\n7. Never Satisfied\n8. Run of the Mill\n9. Dying to Meet You\n10. Caviar and Meths\n\nThe album begins on a disappointing note with the repetitive and bland \u2018One for the Road,\u2019 based on a tedious blues riff that lacks the usual Judas Priest energy in all areas apart from Rob Halford\u2019s voice, which is up to its usual high standards regardless of production. After taking far too long to fade out, the album begins to reveal its real charms with the great title track, a typical Priest song about love and rock with plenty of great harmonies, solos and riffs from Glenn Tipton and K. K. Downing. It\u2019s a little derivative, with contemporary influences all over the place \u2013 the verse sounds like Roxy Music, while the chorus sounds like David Bowie \u2013 but the guitars are distinctly Priest. Halford even offers a brief harmonica section similar to Black Sabbath\u2019s \u2018The Wizard,\u2019 completing this eccentric and enjoyable, but sadly forgotten piece.\n\nThe most creative section of the album comes in the \u2018Winter\u2019 suite, spanning tracks three to five but almost always mislabelled or wrongly edited on CD releases. In its true form, the opener \u2018Winter\u2019 is a good slow song that unfortunately can\u2019t really be described as heavy due to the production, though that was certainly the intention. The introduction is haunting in a primitive way, with whispered vocals before the drum kicks it into a \u2018proper\u2019 song, and once again Halford steals the show. \u2018Deep Freeze\u2019 is essentially nothing more than a spacey interlude between the two halves of the suite, similar to Sabbath\u2019s \u2018FX\u2019 in that its target audience will be easily impressed stoned people who enjoy the effect of a guitar whine fading in and out of volume for a minute and a half (\u2018woah dude, he\u2019s going closer to the microphone, and then moving far out. Do you have any bread?\u2019) Overall, the effect is closer to depicting a UFO than anything winter-based. Unfortunately, the final piece of this trio doesn\u2019t live up to the first, attempting the kind of proggy soft song that would be perfected later in the album but coming off as somehow unconvincing, Halford\u2019s voice sounding less impressive in a more downbeat style. It was still an interesting experiment overall, but perhaps explains why the band hasn\u2019t attempted anything similarly conceptual since (at least, not until next year\u2019s highly anticipated Nostradamus album).\n\n\u2018Cheater\u2019 is the first song that really sounds like classic Judas Priest, with a fantastically simple and violent subject matter \u2013 a man finds his wife in bed with another man, and shoots them both in primal vengeance \u2013 and it\u2019s hard to resist joining in with the chorus towards the end, and thereby clearly condoning the speaker\u2019s actions. This is stupid and fun heavy metal the way it was supposed to be, leaving behind the conceptual nonsense, although it doesn\u2019t offer a lot musically, the guitars sounding thin and similar to the first song. \u2018Never Satisfied\u2019 is similarly cool, the main riff and chorus sounding so stereotypical of early Priest that it could belong to any song on the first four albums. It lacks the power of the title song, but Halford holds the notes like he is famous for, including a final extended wail that sadly has to take second place to the more famous \u2018Victim of Changes.\u2019\n\nThe final phase of the album plays more along the lines of mellow progressive rock, and offers a great distinctive sound in the band\u2019s discography that they carry off surprisingly well. \u2018Run of the Mill\u2019 is the better of the two, mostly acoustic but occasionally launching into a rockier riff, although the reliance on a very dull backing drum-beat is a little irritating. Halford has really cracked the croon after the disappointment of the fifth track, and sounds just as good as he would later in the earlier sections of \u2018Victim of Changes.\u2019 There\u2019s even a rare spot in the limelight for Ian Hill\u2019s bass, and Halford puts in his finest performance of the record with the final reprise of the chorus, which easily ranks alongside anything else he would accomplish up to the 1990s. \u2018Dying to Meet You\u2019 is much the same, only less impressive, beginning slow and changing later on to the extent that it\u2019s essentially two different songs tagged together. It sounds good in isolation, and at least isn\u2019t a wimpy ballad that would really spoil things, but grants Downing greater lenience in unleashing some quite cool and lengthy solos. The main problem comes with the lyrics Halford takes so much time to communicate, which are quite terrible even for a band not renowned for its poetry. The final song is a missed opportunity, the introduction to epic live favourite \u2018Caviar and Meths\u2019 that was apparently \u2018too long\u2019 to fit onto the record. The guitars work brilliantly to compliment each other despite playing different tunes, but this snippet primarily makes me sad and angry that we didn\u2019t get more of it.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t hesitate to recommend \u2018Rocka Rolla\u2019 to anyone who enjoys the early Judas Priest albums up to the excellent \u2018Stained Class,\u2019 before a desire to be American took over and affected the quality of the band\u2019s output for a decade of highs and lows. The production is a big problem, extending to the background hiss that still hasn\u2019t been eliminated by re-masters, but many of the songs fit excellently into the band\u2019s established style, and the ones that don\u2019t offer something completely and excitingly different. Many of the songs are far too short, or far too repetitive (leading to the paradox of tracks such as \u2018One for the Road\u2019 that is too short to get anything out of, but that also takes far too long to finish), but the majority are real classics with that great and slightly amateurish first-album feel. It\u2019s clear that this album should never really have existed in the form that it does, its successor \u2018Sad Wings of Destiny\u2019 being more true to the band\u2019s live shows of the time, but all the same it\u2019s an album with a lot to offer, even if some of its more elaborate aspirations (specifically the \u2018Winter\u2019 trilogy) don\u2019t really go anywhere. It\u2019s really quite good.\n",
        "\nFor some inexplicable reason, Priest's return-to-form and first record with high-flying vocalist Rob Halford has become something of a whipping boy in the metal community. Doubtless a great deal of this is backlash from a number of fanboys heralding it as the greatest thing since, well, Painkiller, and we've seen this same sort of reactionary swing in regards to the three Maiden comeback albums as well. Fortunately, *most of* this criticism is *mostly* unwarranted; and, while this is by no means the greatest thing in Priest's back catalogue, it is a fine collection to any metalhead's collection.\n\nThings kick off in a big way with the intro track \"Judas Is Rising\", and almost immediately one senses the return to a sort of camaraderie long missing in Priest's 90's output. Featuring a trademark wail over a riff that is nothing short of molten, Halford makes himself a welcome addition to the Priest fold. \"Deal With The Devil\" follows, and slows things down a tad while hearkening back to Priest's mid-80's sound - and there's a lot of that all over this record: as one past reviewer has put it, it does try to please everyone, and, for the most part, it works.\n\n\"Revolution\", the lead-off single, is one of the lesser tracks on the album, but not bland enough or commercial enough to be called filler. Fortunately it is brief, and segues nicely into a trilogy of excellent tunes, \"Worth Fighting For\" (one of the better ballads the band has recorded) and two smoking cuts in \"Demonizer\" and \"Wheels of Fire\". The former sounds like a synthesis of Painkiller and Jugulator, and, while this might sound unappealing for the old-school metalhead, it works surprisingly well and also happens to be my favorite track on the album. \"Wheels of Fire\" is slower, but no less powerful, featuring an incredibly crunchy and slightly-dissonant riff and a vocal line so contagious that I've been humming it since I first heard the record two years ago (and my throat is quite sore, I must say).\n\n\"Angel\", unfortunately, is an almost intolerable ballad: Priest has never been good at this sort of thing (\"Dreamer Deceiver\" notwithstanding), and one would hope that they'd have realized by now that balladry is quite outside their niche. Things pick up, however, with \"Hellrider\", which does sound a great deal like a Painkiller cut, but with far more atmosphere than anything on that record save for \"Nightcrawler\" and \"A Touch of Evil\" - the choir-like refrain in particular is suitably dark. \"Euology\" is yet another ballad, but much more suitable than the aforementioned \"Angel\", and \"Lochness\" closes the album on an epically high note, both literally and figuratively, albiet one laden with cheese. \n\nThis is not a bad album. Neither is it exceptional. What it is is a heartfelt return by a band that had strayed from the straight-and-narrow and returned to it in fine form. While it is no doubt grating to see fanboys shrieking about how this is one of the best albums of all time, it is just as annoying to detect the trace of resentment in individuals who feel the need to downplay the album in reaction. This is a very good - not great, but very good - record made by a great band. Let us be happy, at least, that it marks the end to Priest's stylistic heresies.\n\nBring on Nostradamus.\n",
        "\nYes, I am one of the few people who actually enjoy this album. Sure, it sounds nothing like classic Priest, and the solos aren't really that great, but damn is this album heavy. Most people who reject this album, because there's no Rob Halford here. However, I actually like Tim Owens as a singer. He does a nice job on this album except when he uses those \"tough guy\" shouts. Sure, he's The Ripper may not be no Halford, but he's nonetheless a good singer. However, it's the drummer, Scott Travis who really shines on this album. He really shows off his talent here, and actually saves a few of the songs from being crappy. He has to be one of my favorite drummers. The closest thing I compare this album too is a mix of traditional and groove metal with thrashy moments, paticularily on the song, Death Row.\n\nAmongest the highlights here are the title track, Blood Stained, and Death fucking Row. The first two mentioned tracks are groove metal numbers that actually have nice riffs that make my head bang. Then, there's Death Row, holy shit, this song fucking rules! It actually sounds pretty thrashy, with some nice Horrorscope-era Overkill moments. Not only that, but I love that fucking chorus. \"OH NOOOO, I WON'T GOOO, YOU'LL NEVER GET ME DOWN TO DEATH ROOOW!!!!!\" that right there is Owens' shiny momemt, right there. This is easily the best song on the album. Cathedral Spires is also a pretty awesome song too. It starts off like a ballad with a dark atmosphere, and then gets heavy as fuck. The only weak moment on this song is the cheesy chorus, but that's a small price to pay. \n\nHowever, I will admit that there are some pretty bad moments on this album as well. I agree fully with Mr.Boris on this one that Decapitate, Brain Dead, and Abductors are the weak songs here. However, I don't really hate these songs, there just pretty boring, and bring the album down as a whole. Brain Dead is the best song out of the three, and it sounds almost like a doom metal song, just without the punch. However, the other two tracks are absoluetly mediocre. They're not nessecarily bad songs, it's just that there nothing special, and don't contribute to the album at all. The riffs are boring, and Owens sounds pretty dumb on here as well.\n\nIn conclusion, this song is certainly not bad. In fact, it's quite underrated, and is better than several of their earlier albums, paticularily Point of Entry and Ram It Down. If you can tolerate a little bit of change, and can tolerate groove metal, than you'll like this album. It's no Painkiller, but it's solid, and is certainly worthy of the title, Judas Priest. You are going to BURN IN HEEELLLLLL!!!!!!!\n",
        "\nSo now, we come to the album that put Judas Priest on the map, a band that has already trudged the murkiest of waters and paid their dues for twelve years finally gets their just dues. That story is a commonly told one in the entertainment business it is heart-warming and humorous. Nevertheless, with popularity always comes debts, and a band is always bound to piss off some fans whenever they achieve a substantial amount of success. It has been beaten into the minds of record buyers that if an album sells well then it is because the band has \u2018Sold Out\u2019 and it\u2019s not worth buying, another comparison with the \u2018underdog\u2019 theory.\n\nWhat does this have to do with British Steel? Everything if the majority of people had any sense of music, credibility just about everyone would put British Steel right where it belongs, at the very top of any metal list. What sets this album apart from the loads of highly overrated material is the fact that the band never changed their original sound to achieve success.\n\nNo, what we have here is a nine-track album, eleven if you have the Re-Master, which is 100% Priest 100% of the time. Therefore, so what if the album does not sound like Stained Class it is not supposed to, it is supposed to sound like British Steel. Besides Stained Class currently ranks number fourth on the \u2018All-Time Most Overrated Albums\u2019 list but that is a different review.\n\nThe bottom line is one should expect such large debates since this album appeals to a much broader scope of people. Face the fact you are not going to hear FM Radio play Beyond the Realms of Death before Living after Midnight; is that a bad thing? That is up for the individual listener, but I can sympathize with one little fact they often mention, the better songs on BS are sadly overlooked for the lesser ones, but such is life.\n\nThere is a different track listing depending on which version you buy but the version I am reviewing is the commonly known, beginning with Breaking The Law on side one and You Don't Have to Be Old to Be Wise on side two.\n\nWe begin with the simplest of all songs here that was the logical choice to open the album, simple yet effective. While this is a metal anthem it is not your typical one, it is not about \u2018Everybody Rise and Scream for Metal\u2019 garbage, no it\u2019s actually very progressive. The chorus is simple but the story is about\u2026 well you know. The 1:35 mark is the best part as all the build up finally reaches the point of no return as we are told we do not know what it is like and an abundance of sound effects hit us. The main riff returns and brings us back to the chorus that effectively ends the song. Okay so it is not Exciter but you must remember that Judas Priest is a band that will do their best to not always sound the same. They do either something they have never done before or something they have but update it with whatever year their in, which brings us to\u2026\n\nRapid Fire, a song that screams metal from 1982 - 2007 more than anything before it does, including Stained Class. Poetic lyrics, fist pumping rhythm sections, heart-stopping vocals, astonishing percussion as the band roars at full throttle. The guitars are louder, crisper and much more demanding of your attention than at anytime in the past. Interesting to note that the 1:51 mark begins what some could argue helped jump-start the whole rapping of the vocals in any given metal song. Overall, the song is fabulous and the following five songs all follow in that nature, yet have a life of their own, which leave us with the last two.\n\nNever before in metal was their a song quite like the Rage, dramatic, pretentious, childlike and\u2026 reggae?\n\nThe explosive and second best song on the album begins with a bass intro, something we would not see again for four years, that extends into a reggae journey. Dave may be simple but for drummers they understand how effective he is in creating the backbone of all the songs here, but this one in particular. We would have never been given these outstanding riffs without the simplicity of Dave\u2019s drumming. Some of the best lyrics ever conceived by Priest are located here and it is because they and the riffs are allowed room to breathe instead of changing faster than a person and their underwear. By doing so, the song is allowed to go where it needs to, keep even those who are not Priest fans, interested in the twists, and turns the tracks take. The song also gives a chance for KK to show his licks and ability to play a slower, bluesier and meaningful solo without being crazy; essentially, he is trying to beat Glenn at Glenn\u2019s own game.\n\nHowever, in typical Priest fashion they save the best song for last, a head banging ferocious monster otherwise known as Steeler. This song is that of an angry monster ready to sink his slime-covered jaws into your cranium and swallow it completely, it is that demonic and very creative. While the riffs are like that of the other songs, simple I mean, they interplay with each other so well you lose your mind in them. The lyrics are once again very poetic and make your imagination open up, but the true greatness of the track begins at 1:36, that pseudo thrash break is flooring. The vocals are the pinnacles of Rob\u2019s career, never before or after will he so naturally go through four lines of aggression and poetry. Each line is louder and harder with the same riff thrown in again before Dave gives us a drum roll and the final verse begins, except this one is that much more aggressive. The riff returns and then ends at 2:46, so the last 1:42 is single-handedly the greatest part of the record. Never before had their been a single pedestrian riff repeated a billion times sounded so refreshing and buoyant, complete with electrifying whammy bar work that reaches in and grabs your most inner desires and strangles them. With each drum roll, the music becomes louder and even more evil sounding before the ending finally climaxes with a scream and explosion. The only Priest song in the entire catalog that can match this one is the final track from Turbo, otherwise known as Reckless, but that is a whole other story.\n\nThere are also two bonus tracks, which is my only complaint, the quality of the material was brought down by doing so, but once again so is life. The first is 'Red, White & Blue', a very patriotic song recorded in 1985 (I have no clue why it was included on an album from 1980). The first time I heard it, I fell in love with it, it is has a very uplifting feeling to it and the use of crowd noise and interaction was great. In addition, the second track was from the DEFENDERS OF THE FAITH tour at the Long Beach Sports Arena, Long Beach, California on May 5, 1984. The original song may be from the album but the tour it came from was not, Rob\u2019s vocals are embarrassing. Moreover, a more deserving song from here could have been added, like The Rage or Steeler, mostly because we already have a live version of Grinder elsewhere.\n\nSo there you have it, an album crafted in fine style by a band that had it\u2019s core members together for six long years at this point. A drummer who may not be as skilled as the two previous ones, but was veteran so he brought that to the table and he was stable. An album that deserves to sit on your mantle, forget the whole talk of it being overrated, the only reason that is mentioned is that it sold well and continues to do so.\n\nBesides it has the greatest Priest song ever recorded as the final track, that being Steeler, with only Reckless coming close. Do yourself a favor and get the album if you do not have it already, then again if you do not\u2026 what is wrong with you?\n",
        "\nOne of the most often derided Judas Priest albums, Point of Entry marks the precise moment when the band stopped sounding like themselves and became mostly indistinguishable from the brunt of 80\u2019s hard rock acts like Krokus, Helix, and Foreigner. Though the shift to the hard rock sound began as early as Killing Machine, this album was the full realization of that movement. The result: a poorly written and uncharacteristically unoriginal Priest album that while catchy enough that it isn\u2019t rendered unlistenable, still sticks out like a sore thumb in what would otherwise be a strong era in the band\u2019s history.\n\nFor an album that was designed to be commercially appealing, it has an ironic lack of hit singles when compared to the band\u2019s other 80\u2019s albums. The only real hit is album opener \u201cHeading Out to the Highway.\u201d Rightly so, as despite the song\u2019s simplicity, it\u2019s catchy enough to stand up to past classics like \u201cLiving After Midnight.\u201d Unfortunately, this simplicity, while charming here, will soon become overly apparent in the succeeding tracks. All the songs have very simple structures. All the songs have simple riffs and solos. Worst of all, the songs all have terribly simple drumming. Dave Holland, acquired for the British Steel album, proves himself to be one of the worst things to ever happen to this band. While his plain, fill-fearing style was tolerable on that album, his lack of talent becomes painfully apparent on subsequent albums, Point of Entry included. The effect is a bit diminished for this album, but only because nobody else is performing up to standard either. Glen Tipton and KK Downing write the bare minimum in riffage with not a memorable solo between them; playing generic hard rock leads that Angus Young could oust even on a bad day. Ian Hill plods along unremarkably, as usual. Even Halford fails to utilize his high register or his ability to write convincing, memorable melodies. \n\nBut even with the mediocre presentation, a few gems still shine through the rough. \u201cHeading Out to the Highway\u201d is obviously one of them, while the upbeat, catchy \u201cHot Rockin\u201d is less so. As previous reviewers have stated, \u201cSolar Angels\u201d is one of the album\u2019s highlights, being the heaviest and featuring one of Halford\u2019s better vocal performances. \u201cDesert Plains\u201d is also indicative of the band\u2019s past glory, carrying a bluesier atmosphere than most of the tracks on here. The rest, other than the blatantly straightforward yet subtly groovy \u201cDon\u2019t Go,\u201d is textbook definition meh. Hair metal Judas Priest style, without the metal or the style.\n\nLike most of the mediocre albums I review, I can still jam out to this without shame. But it\u2019s not an album that I would ardently recommend, especially to fans of the heavier, better Priest albums. Hey, at least it\u2019s better than the Owens years\u2026\n",
        "\nSo Rob Halford is gone and Judas Priest is trying to recover without him. Left with the decision to either disband or find a suitable successor, Tipton, Downing, & Co. enlist Winters Bane singer Tim (soon to be nicknamed \u201cRipper\u201d) Owens to keep the band alive. But just how alive could he keep the band with their legendary vocalist off in Fight? Not very much, it seems, as Jugulator is one of the weakest albums ever conceived by such a talented ensemble.\n\nPerhaps the only replacement singer more infamous than Blaze Bailey in Iron Maiden is Tim Owens in Judas Priest (note the irony in the similarities of both singers former bands, Wolfsbane and Winters Bane respectively). But his performance is notwithstanding in the event of a musical catastrophe, so I\u2019ll get to him later. And the music is almost catastrophic. Gone is the speed of early Priest albums, replaced with what is basically groove metal. I hear a lot of industrial influence as well, considering the ultra modern guitar tone and the overuse of fucking sampled sounds. Does every song have to start with some kind of stupid intro? Apparently, as they all do. Regardless, most of these songs start slow and go nowhere. The handful of downtuned riffs that are recycled throughout each song are unmemorable, some even bordering on mallcore. But the double bass\u2026you say. Fuck that, I already knew that Scott Travis was a good drummer from his performance on Painkiller; that won\u2019t justify the lack of riffage here. Same goes for the lead guitar. I\u2019ve heard KK and Glen shred better than this as early as Turbo. Hell, as early as Sad Wings. A few choice solos here and there don\u2019t compensate for some poor ones, not to mention once again the lack of good riffs. One plus is that Ian Hill actually pulls his weight, circumnavigating the sludgy modern guitars with his newfound knack for playing fills, but the scales remain unbalanced in the favor of this album\u2019s shitty aspects. Let me add that all the brief \u2018clean\u2019 riffs used for intros and \u2018atmosphere\u2019 blow. They\u2019re all cut from the same cloth (just as the distorted riffs are, only from a different cloth of course) and merely delay the inevitable suckage of their heavier counterparts. \n\nSo now on to Owens. His delivery consists of two parts: a lower register growl that would be a bit more intimidating if the lyrics weren\u2019t so cheesy, and his singing voice that\u2019s capable of hitting every note that Halford could. Best comparison I can think of is John Greely from Iced Earth\u2019s Night of the Stormrider. Unfortunately, rather than make the most of his powerful voice, Owens tends to spend too much time trying to make that unimpressive growl-singing work, to no avail. This is the primary difference between 90\u2019s Maiden and Priest. While Maiden\u2019s roman numeral albums were incorrigible, the presence of Rob Halford might have saved Jugulator. I can\u2019t prove it of course, but I imagine that he\u2019d somehow have made this a bit more listenable than it is. I sympathize with Owens for the mammoth shoes he was expected to fill, but his vocals didn\u2019t save this album where Halford\u2019s might have.\n\nSo any tracks worth salvaging from this wreck? Well, the title track kind of owns, primarily due to its remarkable up-tempo nature on an album mostly composed of down-tempo bullshit. Owens vocals are brand new here, so they sound far less grating than they would by the album\u2019s end. Plus he uses plenty of those high notes that he executes so well. Then there\u2019s a bunch of songs with cool titles they fail to live up to (\u201cDead Meat,\u201d \u201cBurn in Hell,\u201d \u201cDecapitate,\u201d \u201cBlood Stained\u201d) until we get to \u201cBullet Train,\u201d which actually has some interesting ideas both vocally and instrumentally. Closer \u201cCathedral Spires\u201d is the last of the interesting songs, and fairly epic at that. But that\u2019s really it. Three interesting tunes out of ten, not good odds for a Judas Priest album. \n\nSo Jugulator will go down in history as one of Judas Priest\u2019s heaviest albums, but it will also go down as one of their worst ones. Part Owens and part modern influences to blame, it\u2019s just not a pleasant listen anyway you look at it.\n",
        "\n...but when I say \"everyone\" I mean EVERYONE.\n\nJUDAS PRIEST \u2013 UNLEASHED IN THE EAST - 1979\n\nFirst off, I'm not the world's biggest Priest fan. Okay, honestly, I don't even understand how they have so many fanboys. Sure, the 70's material is largely classic and they are one of the progenitors of the classic metal sound, but they are really fucking hit or miss otherwise in my book.\n\nBut anyway, there's three main reasons why this album owns so hard.\n\n1) Other Judas Priest offerings pale in comparison consistency-wise. Judas Priest, more than any other band, do not really have a signature sound. Sure, there's Halford's vox, and you could argue that you could listen to a song and know it's Priest. But if I just said to you \"Hey want to listen to some Priest?\" would you know what to expect? There's 70's hard rock, 70's/80's proto-thrash, slow piano/power ballads, clich\u00e9 80's happy/party \"metal\", the whole 80's Turbo sound, the whole (different) 80's Painkiller sound, the whole 90's Ripper-era sound, etc. It's all over the place. You can't honestly expect someone to enjoy every Priest song. But this album has a distinct consistent sound from track one to track thirteen (get the remaster!).\n\n2) The production annihilates, especially for 1979. This is sort of related to point one because the classic 70's trilogy of Sad Wings, Sin After Sin, and Stained Class suffer from a somewhat bland production. The guitars here are fucking present and accounted for and delivering a fucking metal assault. The bass is audible, something that is unfortunately quite rare in the metal world. The drums maybe have room for improvement by today's standards (you won\u2019t hear any crisp ear-annihilating double bass fills like the intro to Painkiller) but when you remember both the year (1979) and the original studio albums, you'll be fucking satisfied. Finally, Halford is Halford, love it or hate it. He has a great performance, no issues with him. Production is usually why live albums suck, but in this case, it is perhaps the greatest reason to purchase\n\n3) The setlist (given the available catalog) owns.\nSad Wings \u2013 The Ripper, Tyrant, Genocide, Victim of Changes\nSin After Sin \u2013 Sinner, Diamonds and Rust, Starbreaker\nStained Class \u2013 Exciter\nKilling Machine \u2013 Delivering the Goods, Rock Forever, Hell Bent for Leather, The Green Manalishi, Running Wild\nPerhaps too much Killing Machine, but it was the album they were supporting at the time. My only gripes are the lack of Dissident Aggressor, Call for the Priest, or Stained Class. And maybe Rock Forever isn't the greatest track in the world. But they are minor gripes really. This set owns. It's an hour long already.\n\nAll three of these factors come together, and you just have to realize why this is essential. Every song is just so much better here than on the studio version. Diamonds and Rust, a song I otherwise either borderline despise, is amazing here as it becomes another typical 70's Priest proto-thrash tune. Really, the whole proto-thrash feel is prevalent here and perhaps that's why I love this record so much.\n\nBut really, why are you reading these reviews. This is a record EVERYONE should own. I don't care what kind of music you like. EVERYONE needs to listen to this at least once.\n",
        "\nNow I've bought compilation albums before that always have \"The best of...\" in their title, but there always manages to be at least one or two tracks that you don't like. That's untrue with this album seeing that everyone of the tracks on this album is absolutely fantastic. The begining of the album focuses on the early Judas Priest in their heavy metal roots. As you start to go through the album, the songs become faster and more aggresive as Judas Priest tried to keep up with the times of thrash and speed metal. And speed metal is what you get towards the end of the album.\n\nThe album kicks off with some mid-paced songs such as Breaking The Law, Living After Midnight, and The Green Manalishi. Each one of these songs contain epic dual guitar solos by guitarists K.K Downing and Glenn Tipton. And as expected, as the songs get faster so do the solos. This especially sticks out with the intro solo to Metal Meltdown. If you are set out to prolonged exposure to this type of soloing, one might find that his/her ears are begining to melt. That's how fast and impressive these solos are. The main riff for Metal Meltdown has a bit of a Metallica feel to it in the rythym of the guitars. \n\nThere is also one instrumental on the album, which is only a mere 41 seconds. Its almost a dividing line between the early Priest and the latter Priest. As impressive as all the instruments are, Rob Halford manages to soar over the sound of the guitar with a truly talented voice. He can hit high notes with ease, but can also bring his voice down for an angry, aggresive feel. \n\nTo close off this review, the only reason I wouldn't give this album a 100% is because it doesn't contain one of my favourite songs from them, Hell Bent For Leather. Other than that all the songs are timeless classics which are \"...blessed with a true melodic intensity.\"\n",
        "\nWith how much acclaim this release has, it may seem impossible to find any faults here. This has become an album that one, seemingly, is not allowed to hate and should be cherished for its merits. Some even somehow claim this is Priest\u2019s definitive work when, as a musical unit, the band never had an identity to make anything ultimate. The band clearly has themes and concepts that everyone expects but the very identity of Judas Priest is to have no identity.\n\nIf a fan was introduced to Priest by Stained Class and then heard Painkiller immediately thereafter, the fan would not be blamed for thinking it was a completely separate band. Yes anyone can point to the twin guitar attack of Tipton and Downing as what constitutes as Priest\u2019s identity, maybe even Halford\u2019s screams or Ian\u2019s usual silence. However, how many other bands in Metal would that describe? There were falsetto singers before Halford, twin guitar attacks before Tipton and Downing and inaudible bassists before Ian. To further illustrate, there were special guest keyboard spots by Don Airey before this and double bass phenomenon\u2019s before Scott Travis, including in this very band.\n\nSo while there are obvious links between all albums, so very few of Priest\u2019s albums have been similar to others. Killing Machine was Funk, British Steel was hard rock, Sin After Sin was speed metal and Turbo was synth-driven Power Pop. Similar to the question which one is Pink regarding Floyd, when regarding Priest, what exactly IS Judas Priest. If there is one element that shone through every effort was the notable lack of consistency between the songs. I am not referring to the enjoyment of them since that is subjective, I am referring to the consistency of the metallic sound.\n\nWhen one listens to Priest they should expect that deep album clunker that appears to get a lot of hate but is equally brilliant, see: Savage. Or expect that inexplicable ballad with vocals that utilize Halford\u2019s wide range, see: Before The Dawn. Then expect to get their ass kicked by a roaring metal anthem, see: Call For the Priest. That is what made Priest great, how diverse there albums were. Priest was never about consistency they were about dexterity and diversity, not just between albums but the songs themselves. This album though walks a fine line along sheer talent and respectability to utterly dull mediocrity. There are some ruthlessly amazing tracks of boiling metal here, but for those precious few, there is a stale and fruitless slab of predictable distortion. What this album suggests is Priest decided to abandon their only hint of identity, the evolving chameleon, to sound like any of interchangeable bands they had inspired.\n\nThe best way to sum up all of what I wrote above is by pointing the songs that actually work well and we start with the title track which needs no description, just look at the ridiculous album cover. A machine man with wings riding on a motorcycle made out of a snake with large saws as wheels. It should make you wonder who they were trying to impress, with the album art that accompanies all the infantile lyrics, horrible cliches and screaming dullness captured within. One can still enjoy the title track, from it's powerful drum intro to the melodic riffs and solos but as good as this is, how is it superior to Hard As Iron or Ram It Down?\n\nNight Crawler is another highlight of the album since it at least tries to have atmosphere and a variety to the fixed tempo. However this song was done eight years later - and with a different vocalist - on '98 Meltdown and renders this offering entirely irrelevant. Between the Hammer and the Anvil is mildly interesting because it details their feelings towards the utterly stupid trial they had to go through and has a mesmerizing solo but still sounds like something lifted off of the first page in the \u201cHow to write Metal\u201d songbook like almost every second of this album.\n\nSince I am reviewing the remastered version I will mention the bonus tracks and they are not worth purchasing the version for. The production is not superior to the original and the tracks are more of the same tired formula found on the album. The only other highlight is All Guns Blazing, with that driving rhythm and inspired solo by Glenn, demonstrating his extreme writing capabilities. It's astonishing that the band could give us everything they were aiming for on this album in just these four minutes.\n\nNone of what I write is to suggest this is not a listenable album, far from it. Not surprising by my score given, this is still a well performed and higher quality release than other bands of the same genre. Even the bland songs have moments of enjoyment in them and does achieve its goal of blending aggressive and melodic songwriting. So it does succeed in its goal but that goal is where I find issue, this just simply is not how anyone should define Judas Priest. I listen to them for their eclecticism, the expansive compass of musical offerings, numerous diverse ambiances and thesis\u2019. Here it is mostly just drivel of a one note approach that gets very old and very quickly so.\n\nAny newcomer should not be blinded by the superficial qualities of this release that may color or blind them from the more stories pieces in this amazing bands lavish and outstanding discography.\n",
        "\nUnleashed In The East is an album that should be owned by not only Priest fans or metal heads but anyone who has the slightest understanding of real talented music, it is simply out of this world. One can always judge a bands true skill by how good they are in a live setting, when they summon their talent at will and are shown in raw form. Judas Priest does that here and give what is arguably the greatest heavy metal live album of all time, but perhaps the greatest live album period.\n\nRather it is Exciter, Running Wild, Sinner, The Ripper, The Green Manalishi, Diamonds And Rust, Victim of Changes, Genocide, Tyrant, Rock Forever, Delivering the Goods, Hell Bent for Leather, and Starbreaker, every song is performed so powerful it will reach in and pull out every desire you have and give further proof why Judas Priest is the greatest live heavy metal band ever.\n\nDoing a song by song review here is pointless so let's stick to the best tracks, which is Genocide here, if that extended opening or closing sections don't pick you up and kick your ass all over the place then nothing ever will. The music is so vibrant and clear, yet never loses it's aggression. The rapping on the end and the haunting screams send the song and whoever is listening out of this world, climaxing and leaving you breathless.\n\nThe other highlight here is by far the finale(on the original US version) Tyrant. While totally awesome on Sad Wings Of Destiny this version here just blows away anything released before it. The first ever true thrash song was given a whole new life on this heart-stopping version which shows the band take all the originals potential and give a performance that is for the ages. This one song alone makes this album worthy of every penny you may spend for it, single-handedly the greatest live song ever recorded. Need any more proof of how great this version is? Then listen closely after that incredible third guitar solo and you will hear something you cannot hear at any other part of the album, during a song that is, the crowd goes absolutely crazy. Screaming in pleasure after the full minute of absolute greatness K.K. and Glenn rewards.\n\nBut every song is great and better than the studio version, especially Running Wild, the screams at the end is shocking and breath-taking. The \"Sinner, Sinner, Sinner, Sinner, Sinner\" part at the end is also that songs highlight.\n\nSimply put nothing about this record is bad and as said before it should be owned by anyone who has any sense of real talented music, this will take your breath away and leave you floored no matter how many times you hear it. The greatest release by Judas Priest in the 1970's. Get It NOW.\n",
        "\nThis double album, for fans of Classic Priest, does not disappoint in that the bands play the songs with as strong of musicianship as the originals. I don't have the dvd, so I don't know if Ripper actually comes out on a Harley, but it sounds good as hell on the cd! \n\nThis album's pretty much the Metal Monster you'd expect from 90's era Priest, with all the aggression, if not more, than it's Live Meltdown '98 counterpart. It's genuinely a great concert with Priest at the top of their game.\n\nNow for the shortcoming. With these first 2 paragraphs, you'd think this review would read like a high 80s maybe low 90s. Unfortunately, this is not true. Here are the cons:\n\n-Ripper Owens, while possessing a great set of pipes, cannot hit those notes Halford basically invented. This is made pretty embarassing considering my next point.\n\n-THE BAND IS TUNED IN SOME NU-METAL SHIT TUNING! This is what kills this album for me....GAH IT'S HORRIBLE. Nu-Slayer....sure. Nu-Metallica...meh yes it's there. But Nu-Priest!?! That's fucking blasphamy. But it's true. \n\nWhile the classics are all played excellently, the tuning completely ruins the classics. Yes, it is that bad.\n\nOn another downside, Ripper's Jugulator and Demolition tracks do not gel very well with the Halford Classics. It's like Priest...lost their equipment, had to borrow the Nu-Metal opening act's gear, then every 4 songs, a shitty Metalcore band comes in and plays their supposed \"Hit song\" all those 14 year olds love. \n\nThis album is DECENT, but if you lust to hear Priest classics played how you know and love them, go get Unleashed in the East...hell even Priest...Live! is better than this.\n\nProbably for completists only.\n\nIf you do feel you need more Live Priest, just get Live Meltdown '98. It has no Demolition songs, so it's about a gazillion times better.\n",
        "\nI consider this one of of Judas Priest greatest albums, yup you heard me. Sure, it may not be one of their most heaviest or most aggressive releases, and it sure as hell is no Painkiller or Stained Class, or even a Defenders Of The Faith, but it's defiantly one of their most catchiest album, and it's fun as hell to listen to. This album is not for everyone, especially if you're not a fan of glam/80s metal, but if you absolutely love the genre (like I do), than this album surely has something to offer for you.\n\nIn 1986, Judas Priest wanted to do something different for their next album. They decided to use guitar synthesizers which makes the whole album sound very 80s like. 1986 was also the year where glam metal's popularity was arguably at it's peak. As a result, many metal fans accused this band of \"selling out\", because of the amount of glam elements Turbo has. However, Judas Priest were already very popular at the time. \n\nOnto the album now, my favorite songs on here have to be Turbo Lover, Locked In, and Rock You All Around The World. The first song has sets a pretty cool atmosphere with the guitar synthesizers, and it's very catchy. Locked In has some pretty cool lyrics, and that guitar solo is absolutely amazing. Rock You All Around The World is a pretty cool fast paced song, and it almost sound speed metalish if it weren't for the cheesy chorus. However, it's very fun to listen, in my opinion. Some other good songs on here are Parental Guidance, Out In The Cold, and Hot For Love. The first song reminds me of something that Bon Jovi would do in the 80s, with it's chorus. Out In The Cold is a ballad thta sets a great atmosphere. It has to be one of their best ballads. Hot For Love is an awesome 80s metal song with very catchy lyrics, and awesome guitar soloing. The worst song on here, even though it's still pretty good, is Private Property. It just isn't as interesting as the other songs on this album.\n\nIf you dig 80s metal, or if you just want a Judas Priest album that just sounds different, than defiantly pick Turbo up. However, if you don't like this style, than stay away from this album. After Turbo, Judas Priest would go on to continue to pursue their trademark heavy/speed metal sound, and they would nail it pefectly four years later on Painkiller. However, Turbo is the only album with this unique style of heavy/80s/glam metal fused together with a whole lot of fun in between, which is why I like it so much.\n",
        "\nIt's almost absurd how incredible Judas Priest became in the short period of time after Rocka Rolla to the point that they recorded this masterpiece of all things heavy. After spending some considerable time getting into the former album, listening to the latter is astonishing. This is the album where everything came together in every way instrumentally, compositionally, and aesthetically. The band had come to the perfect crossroads of youthful ambition and time-honed experience and just so happened to record an album while that window was open. And as anyone who has heard this can testify, the resulting masterpiece is among metal's finest records. \n\nThis album is downright epic. From the grand piano mood-cementer of \"Prelude\" (yes, I know the CD versions have the sides swapped. The album really does flow better this way) to the sweeping classic \"Victim of Changes\" to the short, potent riffage of \"The Ripper,\" this album exudes power. The Downing/Tipton guitar combo has improved significantly. No longer do they sound like they've made up their rhythms the day before (as throughout Rocka Rolla); rather, every note and chord is placed purposefully. Their solos are just as poignant, never out of place and always effective. But as is typical with Judas Priest of this decade, no one outshines the mighty Rob Halford. Here he's at his absolute prime and graces us with his full force. He wails, he swoons, he rips through octaves as naturally as if he were speaking the words casually, rather than blasting them through his vocal cords with all of his might (which is what he's doing when he's not singing softly). Albums like Sad Wings of Destiny are what established him as one of the best metal vocalists of all time, a reputation that still stands today. \n\nOne of the best things about this album, besides its historical importance and general ass-kicking goodness, is that there wouldn't really be another Judas Priest album quite like it ever again. Sin After Sin and Stained Class both maintained the feeling that this incarnation of Judas Priest brought to the table, but not in such a free, well-flowing manner. The emphasis on mood and feeling throughout \"Dreamer/Deceiver\" would not be rivaled again, nor would the riffs of \"Tyrant,\" the grandness of \"Victim of Changes,\" or the superb atmosphere of \"Epitaph.\" I mean, come on, Glenn Tipton plays piano all over this thing. And as for the two piano-only tracks, lost Elton John tunes these aren't by far. These are classier, with \"Epitaph\" being easily among my favorite Judas Priest songs (and definitely the best of the ballads). \n\nYou can talk up your Machine Head or your Paranoid all you like. Hell, even your Overkill. Because the fact of the matter is, your 70's metal collection will be perpetually incomplete without this gem. Fans of later Judas Priest, come and witness what these guys were capable of a few mere albums before....\n",
        "\nNot unlike many of their 70's contemporaries' first releases, Judas Priest's debut is a raw unpolished classic heavy metal album, a mere proto-incarnation of their true sound. Looking at it that way, as a traditional metal album, it actually comes off quite nicer than if you view it as a Judas Priest album, since it bears only a passing resemblence to the Priest that most are familiar with. Be sure to give this more than just a listen or two, it really has to grow on you.\n\nThe first impression I got of this early Judas Priest is that they really wanted to be like Black Sabbath. It's as if Glen Tipton and K.K. Downing had just heard Volume 4 and wished to emulate it as best they could. Naturally they add their own swagger to things, but the sound is mighty Sabbathian. Listen to the guitar tone when they're really crushing out chords in \"Winter\" or \"Never Satisfied.\" Same goes for the way the solos interplay with one another, highly reminiscent of the way Tony Iommi would layer his solos. There's also a lot of mellow territory on here, with lots of atmospheric clean lines calling to mind Pink Floyd and early Rush epics. There's a hint of psychedelic rock mixed in as well, another reason for this album's unique sound. This is Judas Priest to sit around and mellow out to, rather than headbang and rock out to.\n\nThe band's main distinguishable factor is Halford (as would be the case later in their existence as well). He sounds a bit different than usual (the first half of \"Dying to Meet You\" especially), but youth is on his side here and allows for some fantastic melodies and a few well-placed wails. Check out \"One for the Road\" and the end of \"Run of the Mill\" for example.\n\nAs I said, this album took a bit to grow on me and is good, but it cannot be recommended to all, simply because of how primordial it is. The production is old-school, the band's talent is in its infancy, and it might just be too slow for the average Priest fan to cope with. Keep in mind that this is as 70's as they come and you may just find some value in it.\n",
        "\nOK... Despite the bonus track \u2018Hell Bent for Leather\u2019 and possibly the opener \u2018Exciter\u2019 and \u2018Diamonds and Rust\u2019, there aren't that many all time classics on this live album, however when you listen to it you simply cannot deny that you are listening to the greatest live album ever recorded, and possibly one of the greatest albums in general.\n\nI highly advise you pick up a copy of this album, however I STRONGLY suggest the remastered edition for it contains 4 bonus tracks, one being the evergreen \u2018Hell Bent for Leather\u2019.\n\nWe kick things off with the only Stained Class track to make the cut, the thrash gem \u2018Exciter\u2019 which wipes the floor with the studio version, as do all the songs on this album. From then on in you are treated to pure heavy fucking metal until the very end. This album (not counting the remastered version) also features 4 tracks from Sad Wings of Destiny, 2 Sin After Sin, 2 from Killing Machine and with none from Rocka Rolla and this makes for a VERY solid tracklist.\n\nNotable tracks include: An extended version of \u2018Sinner\u2019, the vocally complex \u2018The Ripper\u2019 (which Halford performs brilliantly), a great version of the Fleetwood Mac song \u2018The Green Manalishi (with the Two-Pronged Crown)\u2019, the classic \u2018Diamonds and Rust\u2019 which is sped up a decent amount and the epic \u2018Victom of Changes\u2019. To be honest every song on here is amazing which is why this stands as one of the greatest albums of all time.\n\nWhen it\u2019s all said and done, odds are you\u2019ll be flicking all the way back to \u2018Exciter\u2019 to be taken on the ride of your life once again.\n\nAs for the actual quality of the album, well what can I say? It\u2019s perfect, nothing is drowned out by the singing or the other instruments and unless they add a whole new part to the song (which happens quite a bit) the songs are performed note for note perfectly. The only real production complaint I have here is you can\u2019t hear the crowd much at all (similar problem with Motorhead\u2019s legendary live album No Sleep \u2018til Hammersmith), but at least that means the actual music doesn\u2019t get drowned out.\n\nReally the whole album is virtually perfect, and even after almost 30 years it still stands up as one of the greatest albums ever... the only complaint is Beyond the Realms of Death was performed at the show, but not used on this album(even in the remaster).\n",
        "\nChances are, if you like metal, you've at least heard Judas Priest. You've probably liked them too, at some point, but I'm not sure if everyone can vouch for that. Judas Priest was one of the first metal bands that I have heard. When they're on their game they can create great things, as seen songs like Electric Eye and Metal Gods which had me hooked after mere listens. Throughout their almost 40 years of existence (That's right. 40 next year!), they've had many ups and downs, extreme highs and extreme lows. Over the course of their highly successful career, the Priest has recorded three albums of which I shall affectionately call \"The Big Three.\" These albums, of which include 1984's Defenders of the Faith, Stained Class, and Painkiller, are some of my favourite metal offerings, and include some of the genre's top songs. \n\nSimilarly to both Painkiller and Stained Class, Defenders of the Faith is driven by constant aggression and power. You know, the kind of supremacy that can only be matched by classic metal stalwarts Iron Maiden. Yet at the same time, the album still contains that laidback feel found on the ever popular Screaming for Vengeance or Angel of Retribution. Tracks which effectively balance this combination of song writing include the ever impressive Freewheel Burning and anthem Rock Hard, Ride Free. Both songs capture the raw emotion and strength of your standout Priest track, and satisfy both the hardcore metal head and the casual hard rock/metal fan. But on the album you also have songs like The Sentinel. Containing what is arguably Judas Priest's most memorable chorus of all time, the track runs on the pure power, speed, and well, everything that makes classic metal such a treat to listen to. The duelling guitars, aggressive riffs, and catchy vocal lines are among the album's finest. Definitely one of the tracks that Judas Priest will (or should) be remembered for. Judas Priest's 9th release features interplay from the Tipton/Downing duo countless times throughout its 40-or so minute runtime, and really, anyone who calls themselves a fan of metal should find something which they enjoy.\n\nSo where else does the band excel? I'd say Rob Halford's performance behind the mic is quite good. Superb, if you will. In fact, this would have to be one of the \"Metal God's\" best efforts of his career, and definitely his strongest since Stained Class. Just look to again, the likes of The Sentinel and Freewheel Burning, as well as the slower track Night Comes Down and Jawbreaker for tracks that back up this claim. Rob Halford mixes his trademark high pitched, falsetto with the gritty menacing style he'd been employing for years at that point. Aside from perhaps The Sentinel, Rob doesn't quite hit the same high notes as in Painkiller, The Ripper, or Stained Class, it remains very impressive, especially when compared to some of his contemporaries.\n\nLooking to buy a Judas Priest album? Though most would undoubtedly point to the likes of British Steel, I would instead recommend this (or Screaming for Vengeance, I guess). For while Defenders of the Faith isn't the pinnacle of the Birmingham band's career, it is certainly one of their better albums and exemplifies the attitudes of traditional metal quite well. Fast yet precise; Gritty yet classy; Aggressive yet accessible; heavy yet melodic; the band's ninth release may not have been as commercially successful as the likes of British Steel, Hell Bent For Leather/Killing Machine, or Screaming for Vengeance, it certainly bests them in musical quality. Defenders of the Faith contains some classic Priest tracks, and those looking to delve deeper in the world of classic metal should not hesitate to check it out.\n\n(Originally written for Sputnikmusic)\n",
        "\nWith one fuck of screech and a killer riff, this album starts off with a bang that threatens to rip you to pieces like pre-Turbo Judas Priest did. Unfortunately, the rest of the album isn't as consistent as it's opener (the excellent title track) which not just opens great, but has some excellent soloing throughout the song, a thumping rhythm section, and sees Rob in excellent form, after being somewhat toned down on Turbo.\n\nThe reason for the inconsistency, I'm almost positive about, is the fact that quite a few songs on this were recycled from the Turbo album after the idea for Twin Turbo was turned down by the record company. Which makes it go from the speed metal of \"Ram It Down\", to speedy 80's metal almost. Despite that though, all the songs are done here in a style similar to Defenders Of The Faith with a bit of a twist, which makes it all fit together, and sound good, but unfortunately has that inconsistent filler feeling due to the pure raw energy the title track gives and the obvious change between that and the rest of the album.\n\nAs for the rest of the songs themselves, you have some excellent stand outs, and then some filler, and one very badly placed cover. The cover of \"Johnny B. Goode\", while done well, DOES NOT fit on this album. I know it was done for a movie, but come on Columbia, release it as a single, not placed in the middle of an album where it shouldnt be. The other stand outs start with the song \"Heavy Metal\" , which has an intro that is good, but almost (well to me anyway) sounds like a carbon copy of Van Halen's \"Eruption\" or part of Vinnie Vincent's \"Speedball Jamm\", not to say that its bad, just that its familar sounding, and doesn't seem to do anything that those two solos havent already done. The song as a whole is pretty good however, minus the chorus, which seems to be lacking something, but it does follow the title track well. \"Love Zone\", and \"Come And Get It\" stand out along with these with all the twin lead work, screeches and speedy vitality you'd expect from a Judas Priest album by now. \"Blood Red Skies\", this albums epic, is the last track that is truly excellent and memorable, which despite being slower just rocks out loud. The rest of the songs have some great parts, but on the whole arent all that great in their entirety.\n\nI strongly suggest buying this album though, its still one of Priest's best, despite its flaws and inconsistency.\n",
        "\nThe late 70s and early 80s were an interesting time in heavy metal, marrying the aggression of Black Sabbath with the speed and energy of jazz and later rock influences. Bands such as Riot, Motorhead and Judas Priest created signature speed metal songs in the late 70s that directly influenced both thrash metal and the earlier NWOBHM, as did much of their slower work. \u201cBritish Steel\u201d carries a sort of accessible brilliance and energy that, in addition to some certifiable metal classics that are still worshiped by the current metal faithful to this day, differed a bit from previous works in its tendency to augment catchiness over progressive and elaborate songwriting.\n\nAmong the more obvious classics are \u201cBreaking the Law\u201d and \u201cLiving After Midnight\u201d, both of which have received a great deal of radio play since their inception and have appeared on various tribute albums. The former is quite simple in its approach (there is no guitar solo), but you can\u2019t help but love what you hear. Likewise the latter is straightforward and features a chorus that is quite easy to sing along with and devoid of any high end vocal wails. \u201cMetal Gods\u201d follows close behind in catchiness, though we get some more metal sounding lyrics and some cheesy metallic sound effects in the background. (The sounds were actually the band banging on pots and pans with a ton of reverb)\n\nFor once the lads in Priest have decided to allow Ian Hill to stand out a bit with a bass intro on \u201cThe Rage\u201d; man I\u2019d hate to have his job. The rest of the song is highly bluesy and subdued, but still carries that essential metal spirit that this band has come to personify. \u201cGrinder\u201d and \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be old to be wise\u201d are also cut from a simple grain, but are quite hard edged nonetheless. \u201cUnited\u201d is probably the lightest of the fold, listening almost like a slower version of a late 90s power metal anthem; in fact I believe Freedom Call borrowed part of this chorus for \u201cFarewell\u201d off the Crystal Empire release.\n\nObviously these 5 Brits are no slouches in the speed department either, bringing forth two fast moving classics in \u201cRapid Fire\u201d and \u201cSteeler\u201d. Although the latter has the advantage in terms of aggression, speed, and sheer metalness, both of these songs listen well and give \u201cExciter\u201d a good run for its money, to speak nothing for the other various speed metal songs put out by Motorhead and company. These two songs alone make the album worth buying.\n\nThe thing about Priest is that because they\u2019ve been around so long and evolved so much, different fans will gravitate to different things. If you haven\u2019t heard this album, it most closely resembles \u201cKilling Machine\u201d and to a less degree the later album \u201cScreaming For Vengeance\u201d. If you\u2019ve heard either of those albums, this carries a similar sense of straight up songwriting that didn\u2019t go off into mainstream party metal the way \u201cPoint Of Entry\u201d and \u201cTurbo\u201d would. If you somehow have not gotten a hold of this due to owning a compilation containing a few of the songs found on here, it is still strongly recommended that you pick up the album as there aren't any songs here that qualify as filler and it is doubtful that any compilation will contain all the tracks found on here. \n\nLater submitted to (www.metal-observer.com) on January 11, 2009.\n",
        "\nJudas Priest has had their share of ups and downs in the opinions of many, be it the Ripper Owens years according to core Halford enthusiasts, the Turbo album according to fans of their heavier music, or this album due to its implicitly light subject matter and heavy amount of rock elements. \u201cPoint of Entry\u201d is different from its recent predecessors \u201cBritish Steel\u201d and \u201cKilling Machine\u201d primarily in that it contains a lot of radio friendly and repetitive rock songs with rather fluffy and happy lyrics. When one forms an opinion on any album, one must obviously take into account personal taste, and in the case of this album one must have an equal affinity for NWOBHM and LA style cock rock.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t go\u201d, \u201cYou say yes\u201d, \u201cAll the Way\u201d are among the more repetitious of the cock rock mix on here. The riffs are fairly simple, there is very little variation, and the primary focal point of the arrangement is the vocals. Halford\u2019s vocal interpretation on these are mostly a mid ranged to somewhat high approach, but nothing quite like the high end screams heard on \u201cBeyond the Realms of Death\u201d or the aggressive low end approach of \u201cDelivering the Goods\u201d. \u201cTurning Circles\u201d and \u201cOn the run\u201d are the happiest sounding of the bunch, the former being all but completely removed the stereotypical metal image of aggression, while the later is heavily blues inspired but with a solid high end performance by Halford.\n\n\u201cHot Rocking\u201d and \u201cTroubleshooter\u201d are also cut from a more cock rock format, but contain the necessary balance of riff variation and lead majesty to make them a cut above the rest. The former in particular is an enjoyable listen if you like up tempo early 80s rock with plenty of soloing. The latter carries some resemblance to the other 5 songs, but has a stronger chorus and a bit more variation amongst the various parts. One truly sad aspect of this band that is further magnified amongst all 7 of these songs is the utter lack of bass work.\n\nAmong the more metal tracks on here we have all the essential elements for a set of Judas Priest classics. \u201cHeading Out to the Highway\u201d has the edge over all the songs on here in the riff department; this was definitely a fine way to start the album. \u201cSolar Angels\u201d is the heaviest track on here, from the phaser driven guitar intro to the slow and straightforward song that follows. \u201cDesert Plains\u201d is my personal favorite from the bunch, mostly because Iron Savior has written several choruses similar to this one, \u201cWings of Deliverance\u201d being the most similar though quite a bit heavier. \n\nCore fans of Judas Priest mostly tend to hate this album because of the lack of heaviness and aggression. But for those of you who liked bands such as Motley Crue, Dokken, and the Scorpions there are plenty of songs on here that are highly comparable to what they did during the 80s. If you like your metal hard and heavy, the best place to find the 3 truly metal tracks on here will be on the Metal Works 73\u2019-93\u2019, so unless you are a rabid Judas Priest collector that would be the place to go. People may rip on this release, but I like it and still occasionally pop it in for extended road trips.\n",
        "\nAmongst the various Greatest Hits compilations out there under the Judas Priest name, the one that truly is worthy of it is the one that just preceded the unfortunate exodus of original singer Rob Halford from the band. \u201cMetal Works 73-93\u201d is more of an anthology than a typical greatest hits release, containing many songs that probably enjoyed less airplay than others did. By the band\u2019s own testimony they compiled these songs more as a collection of what they thought was their best work, not necessarily what the sales indicated, although in most cases the more radio-friendly songs were among what they thought was their personal best.\n\nThe order of the songs on here is not chronological, which is a bit unusual for an anthology release, and instead is put together almost like a new studio effort. Both CDs begin with material off of \u201cScreaming for Vengeance\u201d and end with a song off of \u201cPainkiller\u201d, which are my two favorite albums and likely the most widely respected of their massive back catalog. In between there is a lot of back and forth between extremely fast and somewhat slow songs, the most abrupt change is probably the jump from \u201cTurbo Lover\u201d to \u201cRam it Down\u201d, which underscores the enormous change that occurred between the two albums they were lifted from.\n\nIn addition to having a massive selection of classic Priest songs, we also have commentary on the CD sleeve by all of the members of the band on the events surrounding the composition and recording of each song. Among the more elucidating testimonials for the younger fan that wasn\u2019t around during the 80s is the brief explanation by Rob Halford and Ian Hill of the flack that they caught from prude and brainless dumb fucks like Tipper Gore and their armies of quasi-Fascist censors in Washington D.C. over the spoof driven sexual lyrics to \u201cEat me Alive\u201d. \n\nAlthough all the material on here can be found on the various studio releases between the dates mentioned on the title, we have some oddities on this CD that might give it some extra value to completists who actually already have all of these songs. Most notable is the missing 3rd verse from \u201cExciter\u201d, while the missing guitar solo at the beginning of \u201cMetal Meltdown\u201d also is a bit strange. Neither of these songs were really tailored for radio play and I doubt that Exciter really needed any parts cut from it.\n\nTo fans of Priest whom don\u2019t have the loot to purchase the entire massive collection of CDs in this band\u2019s past, this is the compilation to have. It has some good perks to it and well as plenty of background information for anyone curious as to how Judas Priest evolved into the Metal Juggernaut that they became in the 80s and still pretty much are today. Even though I have less and less use for it as I begin to complete my own collection of Priest\u2019s discography, I still get a kick out of reading the band\u2019s commentary about the songs found on here.\n",
        "\nIt remains a mystery to me how an album this perfectly metal could have been produced only 6 years after the genre's founding. In any case, this was a seminal masterpiece and an incalcuble contribution to the cause of metal. From the masterful opening of Tyrant to the closing strains of Deceiver, there is absolutely no filler here. None of the random bluesy jamming that plagued Sabbath's first two albums. No lyrics about how I wanna go hot rockin', or livin' after midnight, or breakin' the law, or you've got another thing comin'. Tipton and Downing are great throughout the album, and Alan Atkins' drumming, while inferior to Simon Phillips or Les Binks, gets the job done. And this is Rob \"the Metal God\" Halford at his best. There are six songs here and all of them need to be highlighted. \n\nTyrant is, in my opinion, one of the greatest songs ever made. The solo (the third one!) is pure brilliance of the sort not heard since Deep Purple's Highway Star four years earlier. Rob Halford gives one of his most gripping vocal performances ever, including the 10 - second scream at the end, and the verses headbang with authority. \n\nGenocide is less impressive, but still great. It's a medium paced pounding song with a Man-on-the-Silver-Mountain-like riff. The really amazing thing about it, though, is the climax at the end with Halford almost rapping the lyrics. It segues into a great fade-out solo, too. Epitaph and Island of Domination are no less awesome. Epitaph is a slow piano ballad with an impressively emotional lyric and vocal. But it's real job is to set up Island of Domination. As the piano fades, you hear a bass line coming in. And then the song explodes into the vocal intro -\"BEWARE...\" It absolutely sounds like the most awesome thing on the planet every time I listen to it. The song itself features an intricate riff, a driving bass line, and Halford showcasing his whole range - the lower parts as well. \n\nVictim of Changes has a slow, pounding, Sabbath riff, a cool break and solo in the middle. Did I mention that the vocals kick ass? Well they do. This is Rob Halford's crowning vocal performance. The Ripper is a short song, but it is definitely full of suspense, especially with that eerie breakdown in the middle. As well, it is one of the first songs I learned on bass. \n\nAnd now we come to Dreamer Deceiver and Deceiver. How to describe this song? Stairway to Heaven without the boring parts? That's probably the best description. Halford sings an entire verse in that falsetto banshee scream of his. There are two beautiful solo sections (one in each part), and the last half a minute of the build-up really earns Halford the title of Metal God. And when it breaks through to Deceiver, the song slams into gear. Pure metal euphoria, with the high point of the whole album being Halford's desparately screamed last verse and chorus. And after that, it fades out with a few acoustic riffs. And there is nothing more to say. \n\nI highly recommend this to any sane person who likes good music, not just metal.\n",
        "\nThe large, vibrantly colored metallic beast on this album's cover should serve as warning enough of the contents within. For every fast, dark, magnificently written classic on this album, there's a generic, uninspired, too shitty for mainstream success rocker to ruin the energy. Defenders of the Faith could have been unbelievable, but instead ends up being far too inconsistent to be considered a great album. \n\nDarker and heavier than the last few albums, when DotF does right, it really fucking does right. The listener is immediately overwhelmed by the heavy metal fury of the album's masterpiece, \"Freewheel Burning,\" and the old Priest nostalgia kicks in. Halford is amazing, the guitars are fast and heavy, the leadwork is phenomenal and the lyrics are cool as hell. And the album keeps up the pace for the next few songs. \"Jawbreaker\" has crushing dark overtones and magnificent Halford vocal melodies. \"Rock Hard Ride Free\" has some of the best overall guitarwork since Stained Class. \"The Sentinel\" is another absolute Priest classic, with all the elements of their best works. The only thing holding these songs back is the drumming, which does little more than keep the tempo for much of the album. \n\nThen we get to \"Love Bites,\" and the album never recovers. The mediocre drumming becomes so unbearably predictable that every song starts to suffer because of it. The lyrics start at bad and go to worse (the lame two-song outro) and even Halford can't make them work for the songs. The Tipton/Downing lead guitar combo becomes the only thing to look forward to, and the solos should never be the only redeemable parts of a song. \"Love Bites\" is the worst of the worst here, with \"Heavy Duty\" and the title track being just as boring. \n\nAnd yet, the album is still worth getting, if only for the first four tracks. The inconsistency kind of ruins it as a whole, but those four tracks are untouchable. Priest's greatest this is not by a long shot.\n",
        "\nAs a fan of the faster, heavier early Priest albums, it took me a long time to appreciate this album for what it is. The band kept their tempos limited to mid-paced rockers, simplified their songwriting formula, and started writing songs that didn't sound too out of place on rock radio of the time. A sure recipe for disaster, and yet Priest managed to do it without making themselves completely unbearable. For the most part, this is a great classic metal album, if not necessarily a great Judas Priest album.\n\nThe most apparently mainstream aspect of this album is the tempo. Aside from the burst of speed that is \"Rapid Fire,\" the album is pretty consistently slow to mid-paced. The guitarwork and drums are simplified, allowing the songwriting emphasis to shift to the vocals. Therefore the album can't be approached like a metal album; this is pretty much hard rock in the flavor of Judas Priest. However, it works because of Halford. Though he keeps his falsetto in check for most of it, his vocal melodies absolutely rule. He's the primary reason for the album's overall catchiness. Not that the riffing is terrible, just that most of the rhythms are applied solely to highlight the vocal lines. \n\nThe songs are highly anthem oriented, and many of them will stick in your head long after listening. The big hits off the album, \"Breaking the Law\" and \"Living After Midnight\" are solid examples, although this songwriting approach climaxs with \"United,\" which is possibly the catchiest song ever. Again, it's Halford that makes this own so much. The other great aspect of this album is the Downing/Tipton lead combination. While their riffwork has been simplified, their leadwork has not, and the soloing throughout the album is great. Typical of classic metal, but I'm not about to start complaining.\n\nWhile there is no song I really dislike on this, the album is weaker overall than their earlier works. The mainstream influence works here, but it's not the ideal Priest sound. For the high-speed, rifftastic Judas Priest of the past, check out Stained Class, but if you don't mind a little hard rock influenced metal, British Steel is pretty much the best Priest album of its kind.\n",
        "\nLive Vengeance '82 takes place during the Screaming For Vengeance tour and is a joy to watch. At this point, Priest's discography consisted of Rocka Rolla, Sad Wings of Destiny, Sin After Sin, Stained Class, Hell Bent For Leather, British Steel, Point Of Entry, and Screaming For Vengeance. What does that mean? That means Priest is on top of their game. Other than the Abysmal Point of Entry and Rocka Rolla, you can't go wrong with what they have to offer.\n\nSo, now to the actual concert. It isn't filmed in the best quality, but considering it's from 1982, it isn't bad at all. You'll occasionally see some reddish/yellowish graffiti looking things on the screen, but they're not much of a bother. Other than the few quality issues, it's filmed excellently, and doesn't change angles every half a second (Death On The Road) which makes for much better watching.\n\nThe sound of the album is in good quality too, and I don't believe it has many overdubs. One issue a lot of people seemed to have was a problem with Glenn's guitar being much lower in volume than KK's. Yes, for some reason it was mixed that way, but it really isn't \"much lower\" as people were saying. It is a tad bit lower, but you can still hear their guitars seperately quite well. The only noticeable thing you'll hear is that KKs solos are higher in volume than Glenn's. Other than that, it's not a big deal.\n\nNow to the actual content. The setlist is excellent and they even manage to make a Point Of Entry song (Desert Plans) very enjoyable. They play all the classics that we'd come to expect from Priest, but at this point, You Got Another Thing Comin' hasn't become the concert ender quite yet. That's left to Hell Bent For Leather, an awesome song: two and a half minutes of excellence. The only gripe with the setlist I have is that they didn't play Beyond The Realms of Death. Other than that, there's really no issue with it. It's a great setlist and is what made me get this dvd rather than Electric Eye. The Priest....Live! concert was filmed after Turbo had been released. That's another great thing about Live Vengeance - No Turbo!\n\nAnother thing about Live Vengeance is that you get to see Priest interact with the crowd. Sure, Halford doesn't go diving into the crowd, but unlike many others he gets the crowd excited, has them chant with him, and all sorts of things. Halford and the rest of Priest really play for the fans, which is a great thing to see.\n\nIn closing, this is a great concert that any Priest fan should get. Even if you don't like Priest that much, this dvd showcases why Priest is such a great band. Starting with The Hellion and ending with Hell Bent For Leather, this is one of my favorite live concerts and being able to see Priest play 25 or so years ago is really cool to watch.\n\n95%. If it wasn't for the few quality issues I'd definitely give it 100%.\n",
        "\nLooking back in time, 1984 was a great year for releases in the fledgling metal genre. There were a number of strong releases by veteran and newer bands alike such as Iron Maiden, Metallica, Mercyful Fate, Celtic Frost, Dio, Manowar and Queensryche. Judas Priest\u2019s Defenders of the Faith is better than all of the above and ranks as one of the greatest heavy metal albums of all time. The funny thing is this album is sometimes forgotten by metal fans as more attention is given to Priest albums \u2018Screaming for Vengeance\u2019 and \u2018British Steel\u2019. Where as \u2018Screaming\u2026\u2019 contains too many filler songs and \u2018British Steel\u2019 too many dumbed down songs (Breaking the Law and Living After Midnight) Defenders of the Faith crushes all with the metallic fury within. \n\nThe first five songs of this landmark release are five of the greatest written and recorded metal songs of all time. The last four tracks plus outro are all very good songs, especially Night Comes Down and Eat Me Alive, and would rank as most bands best work. The possible exception would be Heavy Duty which is a somewhat bland song compared to all that preceded it. However the track listing of Freewheel Burning, Jawbreaker, Rock Hard Ride Free, The Sentinel and Love Bites overshadow these songs. I won\u2019t spend time talking about Rob\u2019s vocals and Glenn and K.K. playing ability. That is a known quantity. Production, performance, song writing and track ordering are all top notch on this album. \n\nFreewheel Burning starts the album on a fast up tempo pace that never relents. When Rob Halford sings \u201cLook before you leap\u2026\u201d in concert with the palm muted guitars in the middle section of the song, the single greatest metal event has been created. This is again repeated after a solo section with Rob\u2019s screaming vocals. The unison solos of Glenn and K.K. are also another highlight of this perfect song. I am not aware of a metal album starting with a more fitting song. If anyone asks why I love metal, I play this song. \n\nJawbreaker is awesome in the intro riffing and darkness of the verses as sung by Rob. This is probably one of the darkest and desperate sounding Priest songs since the middle 70\u2019s. The solos of Glenn and K.K. highlighted in these first two songs surely influenced the likes of In Flames and At The Gates. Rock Hard Ride Free lightens the mood a bit with a more rock approach. The song is still great and filled with cool riffs and a very catchy verse and chorus. \n\nThe Sentinel is another perfect epic metal track. The intro riffs are some of the most sinister and identifiable in the metal pantheon. What is more metal than the chorus of \u201cSworn to Avenge, condemned to Hell, Tempt not the blade, all fear the Sentinel\u201d? Nothing is! The middle section is also pure genius. It gives me the feel of looking out over a battle strewn field as two contestants face off to the death. Up Next, Love Bites contains what should be the most recognizable and coolest guitar riff/vocal combo ever. Unlike say a song like Iron Man, the vocals following the guitar of \u201cIn the dead of night\u2026\u201d is brilliant and not just a poor attempt at mimicking the guitar. This simple but heavy song is again a classic and should be known by all.\n\nThis is easily Priest\u2019s best work since Hellbent for Leather, and is easily one of the top 10 albums of all time.\n",
        "\nJudas Priest was in a sort of reckoning period in the aftermath of the success of \u201cTurbo\u201d, which unfortunately cost them some respect among their core fans. Judas Priest is credited for helping pioneer the Speed Metal style that brought about thrash metal, and rather than continue to pump out great speed classics, they elected to sweeten up their sound with some pop influences. Although \u201cRam it Down\u201d is more of a transitional effort than a pure speed fest the way \u201cPainkiller\u201d would be, it rocks a hell of a lot harder than anything they had done in a few years and ranks high in their back catalog.\n\nThe essential speed classics are present in all of their blazing glory, incarnate in the triumphant and unforgettable title track and the equally blazing cooker \u201cHard as Iron. From start to finish these tracks ratchet up the technical prowess of the guitars and drums, and showcase Halford back where he belongs, breaking the sound barrier with his high frequency banshee cries. Other tracks such as \u201cLove Zone\u201d and \u201cBlood Red Skies\u201d are a bit more mid tempo, but are still riff monsters loaded with unforgettable themes and sci-fi inspired lyrics in the case of the latter.\n\nOther tracks on here are still more in the 80s rock vain, particularly the somewhat Deep Purple inspired tracks \u201cCome and Get it\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m a Rocker\u201d. We get something a bit slower yet menacing sounding in \u201cMonster of Rock\u201d, almost to the point of having a doom quality to it. \u201cHeavy Metal\u201d showcases further the technical excellence of the guitar players, in addition to the heavier tendencies of this total album. \u201cLove you to Death\u201d is a bit more in the turbo vain, though it highlights the more positive riff driven aspects of it.\n\nThe Chuck Berry cover is probably the most interesting part of this album for me, as I\u2019ve always been fascinated at how bands can take older songs like this and all but completely change them. The guitar work is a lot less primitive than the original version, venturing well outside of the repetitive blues riffs that Chuck Berry elected to play a little bit too fast for the mainstream of his day. Essentially metal can trace some of its roots back to this music, but when one compares this version with the original, it is obvious that evolution has created a completely different beast.\n\nIn conclusion, this is a solid release for fans of older Judas Priest, although if there are some out there who liked \u201cTurbo\u201d and \u201cDefenders of the Faith\u201d, there are still some remnants of those on here. Come ye traditional and power metal fans, this is a treat for the ears that ought to get a nice loving home among you collections\n",
        "\nThis album is undoubtedly Priest's worst, worser than Turbo, Demolition and Jugulator combined. The strangest part about the album is that it starts off incredibly - 'Heading Out To The Highyway' is an awesome catchy opener although it too shows a more streamlined side of Priest. After hearing this track, I had (falsely) believed that all the critics were wrong. If this was what the album was like, it would definetly have joined its legendary predecessors on stage. Unfortunately, every other song on the album with the exception of On The Run are easily among Priest's worst. You pretty much get this right off the bat after the opener, Priest deserve a huge thumbs up for being considerate enough to tell the listener right away that they're going to suck, and do a really thorough job of it. 'Don't Go' is among the albums worst songs (an honour indeed!) with an incredibly repetitive half-riff and irritating vocals - this is a failed attempt at the antics of the psychedelic 70's. In fact, that's what a lot of the album sounds like - pseudo psychedelic 70's rock. Songs such as 'Desert Plains', 'Solar Angels' and many moments on the album are a complete blues-fest with a lot of meandering riffing in a failed, vomit-inducing attempt to rehash the glory of acid rock. \n\nThe entire album is boring, meandering, repetitive and has no place in a discography of a band like Priest. 'Troubleshooter' is probably the worst song on the album and a top contender for worst Priest song ever along with other abominations like 'Abductors' (Jugulator) and 'Last Rose Of Summer' (Sin After Sin). Quite a tough contest indeed, as Priest may very well be (with the exception of their efforts till British Steel and Painkiller) the most inconsistent band ever and have a fetish for ruining albums with some totally vapid songs that have absolutely no place in it. We pretty much have nothing to cheer about except the opener and the closer. On The Run finishes the album off rather strangely. After all the sewage we've been through listening to this wreck, we've come upon a gem which ranks among Priests best! With an amazing vocal delivery, soaring chorus and great riffing this one just burns the entire album to ashes and flys away - leaving you stunned and unable to recover. \n\nWell, the album can be summed up with three words - boring, repetitive and awful. If you have the remaster, it contains two nice bonus tracks - Thunder Road and a live version of Desert Plains. Thunder Road is a nice hard rock number that should have made it onto the album. Desert Plains which is quite boring on the album absolutely slays live. Priest have always been one of the best live bands out there, live even their worst stuff shines through. This is due entirely to the bands contagious energy when they perform with the guitars, vocals, drums and in other words everything on absolute overkill. In fact, the definitive versions of the songs on their studio releases are the live versions - such as Tyrant, which ruled on Sad Wings but was turned into a juggernaut in Unleashed In The East. So one would do good to hunt down as many Priest bootlegs he can, they're better than the studio releases!\n\nIn conclusion, stay clear of this release. Download Heading Out To The Highway, On The Run and the two bonus tracks and that's all you'd ever need from this wreck.\n",
        "\nIn the year 1990 metal was going through a strong period of reckoning. Many of the previous masters of metal were beginning to have their credibility questioned due to the over-the-top image the many bands had exhibited, and the lack of musical intrigue to back up the flamboyance. The thrash scene was on the verge of being overrun by a group of minimalist groove bands, whom ultimately grew out of the seeds of Metallica\u2019s overrated \u201cMaster of Puppets\u201d album and it\u2019s similarly overrated mainstream counterpart in \u201cThe Black Album\u201d. Bands such as Pantera and Sepultura would end up completely dumbing down their sound soon after and the way was paved for a generation of musical malformations which properly labeled themselves \u201cGrunge\u201d. \n\nHowever, as all was seemingly slipping away from metal and the end seemed looming, a seed was planted that would start to grow even as the old guard began to fold the tents and the metal mainstream would go back to the underground that it came from. The seed was an album that had all the melodic hooks and technical intrigue that defined 80s power metal, and yet had the speed and the attitude of early 80s thrash, and the resulting growth would be the rise of a generation of new bands who would focus on the untapped potential of this innovation in Europe, most notably Germany and the Scandinavian countries. And that new generation would come gradually from obscurity to laugh at the short and utterly pathetic rule that the so-called Nirvana wave had at the top.\n\nPainkiller is, from start to finish, an all out assault on the conventional wisdom that heavy metal is either fluffy glam music or inaccessible/atonal art dominated by nihilistic darkness. It throws caution to the wind and blazes away with blinding speed and technical flair from start to finish, forcing the listener to take a musical breather after the close of a listening session. Even the more mid-tempo tracks such as \u201cA Touch of Evil\u201d, \u201cNightcrawler\u201d and the somber lead-in to the bonus track \u201cLiving Bad Dreams\u201d are pulsating with power and glory. It takes the soft ambiences of the synthesizers that dominated \u201cTurbo\u201d and married them to the endless assault of metal riffs and dueling solos with a genius that would inspire many speed metal bands to pursue the possibilities outside of the traditional bass, drums, and guitar arrangement. \n\nWe kick off this album with a thunderous drum intro to the title track, which sets the tone for the rest of the album. Rob Halford screams away with the best of them, and the atmosphere is dominated with a driving heavy guitar riff. \u201cHell Patrol\u201d follows with more double bass work, though a bit more melodic emphasis. We have a riff on here that somewhat resembles \u201cChildren of the Grave\u201d, a riff that is often looked to for inspiration by the early thrash fold. \u201cAll Guns Blazing\u201d brilliantly continues the merging of melody and speed that the previous track exhibited, with some brilliant drum work. \u201cLeather Rebel\u201d is probably one of the most inspirational songs to the current wave of power metal acts, and showcases a trademark riff that is often paraphrased by speed metal bands in the late 90s to now. \n\nThe high octane thrill ride continues with an amazing guitar shred fest of an intro that leads into \u201cMetal Meltdown\u201d, which showcases more of the brilliant marriage of thrash and melody at work on this album. Probably the easiest chorus to remember and sing along with on here, especially considering that the verses are most likely not within the range of most male metal fans. \u201cNightcrawler\u201d is a more mid-tempo anthem with a spooky keyboard intro, but bear in mind that it is mid-tempo in comparison to what has come before it, which means it\u2019s still pretty damn fast. The main guitar riff is highly memorable, as are the horrifying lyrics which provide a super-villain contrast to the heroic figure depicted in the title track. \u201cBetween the Hammer and the Anvil\u201d has a quasi-doom inspired intro that reminds a bit of early Sabbath, though the rest of the song is more amazing riffs and a good amount of speed. \u201cA Touch of Evil\u201d is probably the only track on here that could be qualified as down tempo, but the guitars are heavy and dominant enough that you still can\u2019t sit still. We also have another brilliant, yet less spooky keyboard intro that would later be paraphrased by Nocturnal Rites on their latest album. \u201cBattle Hymn\u201d is a brief instrumental segue to \u201cOne Shot at Glory\u201d which is a highly memorable metal anthem loaded with melody and yet still kicks ass in the riff department, great closer to a riveting album. \n\nThe re-mastered version of this album contains a bonus track titled \u201cLiving Bad Dreams\u201d and a live version of \u201cLeather Rebel\u201d to complement the collection of brilliance on here. The former is a ballad that is still loaded with power and amazing guitar work, though it doesn\u2019t have the speed that dominated the original album. The latter is what I would call a perfect performance of a highly difficult song, as I had a hard time distinguishing it from the studio version, except for the sounds of the crowd. \nPeople may ask, what is the significance of this album? Especially when considering all the groundbreaking work that was done on Priest\u2019s earlier efforts, one would definitely be tempted merely to shelf the significance of this release as a great band merely going out with a bang. To this I respond, look at what is contained within this bang of an album that they ended their 80s era sound with. Even Pantera\u2019s \u201cPower Metal\u201d, though having a good deal of speed and power, doesn\u2019t quite capture the groundbreaking formula at work here. The problem is that it took 7 years for the full effects of this album to be realized, when Gamma Ray released \u201cSomewhere out in Space\u201d and Iron Savior released their debut, which ushered in a new era of melodic speed metal. Metallica may have killed metal in the 80s, but Priest brought metal back in the late 90s, and the fruits of this work are still be realized in the metal world as bands such as \u201cRhapsody\u201d, \u201cLuca Turilli\u201d, \u201cSonata Arctica\u201d and a bunch of other European bands mix the standard set by \u201cPainkiller\u201d with their own unique symphonic and electronic influences.\n\nIn conclusion, this album is essentially for any fan of speed metal and melodic power metal. Fans of the current scene in Germany and the rest of Europe will not only find a great album, but the very manifesto of the music that they love and cling to as a haven from the mediocre garbage that has dominated the radio for the past 15 years. Some may downplay this album as merely being good, but I know better, and am unapologetic in giving it a perfect score.\n",
        "\nJudas Priest fans, the wait is finally over! The mighty Priest has come roaring back with a brand new Dual Disc that is absolutely stunning. From the killer theme of the cover and packaging to the \u201cReunited\u201d DVD disc side to most importantly, the awesome actual album itself. \u201cAngel Of Retribution\u201d is a show stopping listen as the group once again joins forces with vocalist Rob Halford in order to create what could possibly be considered to be the defining Judas Priest album. \n\nThere is a vibe that flows through this record that gives you the impression that nothing ever changed with the band and the time Halford has spent away seems to have resulted in a bout of creativity and focus that is unparalleled in the group\u2019s tenured history. This is a record that long time fans of the group have been hoping and praying for and it does not disappoint in any manner whatsoever. From the blistering metal anthem \u201cDeal With The Devil\u201d to the harmonic and truly beautiful ballad \u201cAngel\u201d, this album has everything that fans love about the band and then some. \n\nRob Halford\u2019s high pitched scream seems to have a rejuvenated power on the first single, \u201cRevolution\u201d. Here, the vocalist uses his signature dynamics in order to create a powerful ambience that shows exactly why he is one of the most highly regarded singers in the history of metal. Speaking of history, Priest do much to rewrite their own history by nailing tracks like \u201cWorth Fighting For\u201d and \u201cJudas Rising\u201d with a feeling they only can create, expanding on sounds they originally created on \u201cStained Class\u201d and \u201cBritish Steel\u201d to a high degree of success. \n\nThe massive, doom laden strains of the 13 minute tour de force \u201cLochness\u201d in one song, manage to symbolize everything that this record, and for that matter, Judas Priest are all about. Powerful harmonies, crunching guitars of steel and gigantic beats all mesh perfectly on this track, summing up the album with an enormous point of exclamation that screams \u201cPriest IS heavy metal!\u201d \n\nThe DVD side of this disc is worth the cost alone, featuring interviews with the respective band members on the reformation of the metal gods along with some superb footage taken from the band\u2019s 2004 \u201creunited\u201d tour that show the band back on stage in fine form, Harley-Davidson, leather, spikes and all. This lengthy documentary includes clips of classics like \u201cA Touch Of Evil\u201d, \u201cDiamonds And Rust\u201d and a version of \u201cLiving After Midnight\u201d which displays an enthralled crowd with fists firmly in the air pogoing to the song with savage intensity. The greatest part about the DVD is the opportunity to hear the members speak passionately in regard to the reformation, which makes for some truly memorable moments. As an added value, the DVD side also contains the entire \u201cAngel Of Retribution\u201d album in it\u2019s entirety in enhanced stereo sound. While each individual track plays, a different screensaver featuring the astounding art which graces the album cover and liner is displayed. Although Priest is known for metal, well known as the band that originally took metal to its most extreme in the 70\u2019s, they truly shine on the mellowest track you will find on \u201cAngel Of Retribution\u201d, the haunting ballad \u201cAngel\u201d. This cut is quite simply, one of the best songs the group has ever put together. \n\nOmnipresent keyboardist Don Airey also makes a guest performance on the eerie \u201cEulogy\u201d, bringing warmth to the track with a somber piano performance. As the preeminent godfathers of metal, Judas Priest manages to accomplish here what few others have, a reunion effort that outmatches the greatest works of their career. That in itself is no small feat for a band that has created so many classic songs. \n\n\u201cAngel Of Retribution\u201d reestablishes Judas Priest as a heavyweight in the metal world, and for long time fans of the band this album will resonate with tremendous force for quite some time. All hail the metal gods!\n",
        "\nThe trouble with Judas Priest has always been their inconsistentcy, and this album is no doubt one shining example of that. If some of the filler tracks had been pruned off, this would have been the album that Stained Class is (namely, the first \"true\" metal album). It sounds as if they wanted to make Sad Wings Part II as well as a commercial rock album at the same time, and it can come off as plain goofy in parts (namely the first 4 minutes of Raw Deal and the ballads). These songs' placements in the tracklist just kill the feel of the album, and really do it a disservice, which is unfortunate.\n\nIt's obvious that Priest can't do wrong when they crank the metronome up and just play fast on 10, like on Painkiller. The good ol' speed metal tracks on Sin After Sin are all incredible, and highly worthy. Let Us Prey/Call For The Priest is easily the standout, and still possibly the fastest song they've ever done (280 BPM), all while maintaining an excellent sense of songwriting and melody; the riffs and solos are both phenomenal. This is also the first Priest song with a true guitar duel (Tyrant seems a bit underdeveloped, and only has 3 solos) and also a killer harmony section. It's a shame this song hasn't been played live in the past...28 years or so. Hearing that organ melody as opposed to The Hellion open their live set would definitely be a welcomed change.\n\nStarbreaker, Sinner, and Diamonds And Rust are no slouches either, though Starbreaker is the weakest of the three. All are packed with yummy riffy goodness, and again, Priest's sense of melody at this time was impeccable. Halford is spot on here, and really never screams for the sake of screaming, which plagues a majority of their post British Steel output.\n\nThe album's closer, Dissident Aggressor, has to be the heaviest song ever released for its time. After a few seconds of some pick scrapes and triplet-eighths guitar strumming, the most intense scream Rob has ever unleashed arrives. It's almost inhuman sounding (actually, it sounds pitch-shifted...or his boyfriend at the time was a bit too aggressive the night before...but who cares!), and the song never lets up after that. The riff set is punishing, crushing, and all the while, clear and melodic. Slayer had 9 years to think of a way to make this song heavier, and even they failed; that truely is a testament to this song's place as the first \"extreme\" metal song, blending Deep Purple's speed and aggression and Black Sabbath's bludgeoning and heaviness in a mix that not even Priest has managed to recreate (though Slayer is still trying to recreate the hurricane/cat-in-a-fan sound of the solo). For 1977, it would have scared the shit out of someone, like The Excorcist of metal. In 1987, it was still heavy as fuck. In 1997, it was still heavy as fuck. It's safe to assume that it will still be heavy as fuck in 2007.\n\nThe musicianship here (save the ever-inaudible Ian Hill, poor bloke) is superb. It's a shame Simon Phillips couldn't stay on as part of the Priest lineup, especially comparing him to mediocre drummer extrodinairre Dave Holland. The drum sound on this album is second to none in the Priest catalog. Glenn and KK really stepped up the riffage here, too, creating a highly varied musical feel with (I mention it again) a killer ear for melody, and their guitar tone is clear, bright, and heavy. Halford is also at his vocal peak (let the phlegm-filled scream in Metal Meltdown be evidence that he has been sliding down hill since this album), using his full range as needed. A very underrated slab of 70s metal.\n",
        "\nI don't believe that an album of this magnitude will ever be achieved by this band ever again. To be perfectly honest with you, this was also the first time in their career that they'd managed to achieve such a level of greatness as well. Here is basically how things occurred;\n\nPriest, is generally viewed as the forefathers of heavy metal, alongside Sabbath and to a lesser degree Deep Purple and the Scorpions. If you listen to many of the aspiring metal acts from the eighties, including the Bay Area thrash bands from this time, you will hear a lot of striking similarities with Priests' earlier efforts. More notably albums such as Sad Wings of Destiny, or even Screaming for Vengeance. But as the 1980's came to an end, Priest slowly changed their sound to a more \"friendly\" sounding collage of songs. Hence giving birth to albums such as Turbo and Ram It Down.\n\nAt this same time however, many of the bands who began their careers, citing Priest as a major influence continued to get progressively more technical and heavier. This included bands such as Forbidden, Metallica, Pantera, and Overkill. It wasn't until 1990 that Priest was able to release an album which was a fusion of past formulas, mixed with some of the current and explosive elements of thrash metal into what many still consider to be their pinnacle achievement...Painkiller.\n\nEverything about this album, from the lengthy compositions, to their technicality, the anger of Halford's delivery in the vocal department, or the addition of new double bass monster Scott Travis, Painkiller was a tour de force for this band, and I believe that this album was worthy of re-establishing Priest as one of the genre's leading artists.\n\nThe most predominanty technical aspect of this album is without a doubt the guitar solos of Glen Tipton and KK Downing. Where the fuck did these solos come from? Are these the same guys who do the lead on Living After Midnight? Yes, by point of fact it is! And although many revere the solo in Painkiller (the title track), to be the greatest solo on this album, I actually can't pinpoint the best one, since every song with the exception of Nightcrawler has a face melting guitar solo.\n\nThe production on this album by Chris Tsangarides is phenomenal for its time. I did recently purchase the remastered version of this album, but don't really notice that big of a difference in the sound quality from the original, it was pretty much done to perfection the first time around.\n\nEach song gets 10 out of 10 for being true metal greatness. Lyrical content is diverse and intelligent, with the mandatory cliched heavy metal hero context from time to time (see Leather Rebel or Metal Meltdown). Even though I am a self proclaimed Priest fanatic, this is the only album from their lengthy catalogue that I never neglect for more than a month before throwing it on for about a week at a time. A classic in a league of its own!\n",
        "\nThe bleak and mournful mould for this album was somewhat cast forth by the tomes of Black Sabbath, Atomic Rooster, and other shadow dwellers of metal\u2019s early days. But with this, their second album proper, Judas Priest made a hopeless and forlorn turn that was carved out of the blackest granite yet heard in metal\u2019s then brief life span. Their 1974 debut Rocka Rolla was similarly icy in flavor, but this was something new altogether. An album where no light shines, mankind is doomed, and Priest opened the dark possibilities of metal\u2019s psyche to reach previously uncharted depths. \n\nFirst off, Rob Halford gives a vocal performance for the ages, loaded with range, feeling and mood setting par excellence. For their part, twin axe-men K.K. Downing and Glen Tipton provide him with an almost unfathomable collection of riffs and atmospheres that bespeak of a particularly grim but musically sturdy worldview. The true majesty of the dual guitar interplay would begin its ascent here, revealing the pair as writers with knowledge beyond their (then) tender years. \n\nAnd then there are the songs. Never again would Priest pack an album so tightly with such resonant and affecting cuts. Make sure your Zoloft prescription is full before airing these woeful tales. Feel your romantic relations disappear into despair as you become lovelorn in the epic \u201cVictim Of Changes.\u201d You\u2019ll likely be slaughtered by \u201cThe Ripper,\u201d and your soul will be stolen and left to drift eternally among the cosmic ephemera by the \u201cDreamer Deceiver.\u201d And as your soul drifts away, the \u201cDeceiver\u201d cements his evil deeds with riffs cast in pure evil concrete. No kidding kids, the way these two cuts work in tandem and on their own is one of the most morbidly beautiful musical successes in heavy metal music ever. And that was only side one!\n\nFlip the thing over (like we used to have to in the good old days of analog) and you\u2019ll find yourself under the oppression of the \u201cTyrant,\u201d you\u2019ll be submitted to \u201cGenocide,\u201d and pay an unpleasant visit to the \u201cIsle Of Domination.\u201d Captured in a flat but appropriately dated production job, the album\u2019s soul is blacker that most could handle, hence it\u2019s almost complete lack of sales upon release and ensuing legendary status. \n\nAnd just a note to younger death/black/grind metal-heads out there: give this work of art time. At first, its soul penetrating powers may sound conservative up against modern ideas about metallic brutality. But trust me\u2026like a possessed tapeworm, it will slowly but inevitably wrap itself around your psyche\u2026and then eat it. A true genre landmark.\n",
        "\nPriest are in top form, even after over 30 years together. The concert, filmed in front of Japanese fans, has the band tearing though several classic songs, and only a few not-so-good sections of the performance. Production wise, the vocals are loud and up front, and the guitars and crisp and tight. Ian Hill's bass is a steady pulse (a good subwoofer is recommended), and the drums are clear.\n\nNegative points on the DVD are some of the cheesy camera angles (I mean, this is a 2005 release), such as the 4 way splitscreen, and even a star fade (if i remember correctly). Also, a few unworthy songs are performed; Diamonds and Rust is entirely acoustic, and while it may have been boosted in 'emotion' or whatever, it's lacking that killer opening riff. Hot Rockin' is decently performed, but again, the song itself is pretty lame. The new material goes by well with the fans, who eat up pretty much anything Halford says or does (including the somewhat annoying chanting before the last song, You've Got Another Thing Comin'.\n\nHighlights? Of course; The Ripper, Breaking the Law and Painkiller are rendered brilliantly by a trained veteran band, and Halford's still great shrieks pepper the latter. Beyond the Realms of Death saves a near 5 song shitstream near the middle of the performance, with 2 pretty bad newer songs, and then Turbo Lover. However, they really get their shit together at the end of the concert, ending with 5 great songs after Hellrider.\n\nA good DVD, a worthy purchase. Much better than anything live released during the Ripper era.\n",
        "\nThe first thing that came to my mind when buying this DVD was whether or not Tim \"Ripper\" Owens was a worthy replacement for Halford live. The answer to this is simple - yes he was. He had some big shoes to fill, but man, did he fill them well. \n\nBy the time Metal Gods is done, you already have a good feeling about the whole DVD - the band plays very tight, the crowd are well into it, and Ripper is very impressive. Though at times Ripper seems somewhat laid-back and even boring on stage (his stage antics somewhat resemble those of Halford), otherwise he's into it, and he really nails some massive screams. The scream after the calm interlude on Victim of Changes (\"VIIICTIIIIM OOF CHAAAAANGEEEEES!!!\") is hit with incredible power, surpassing Halford's original by far. Ripper sounds very good in the lower registers, but it's when he screams that you really get to see what he's made of.\n\nThe DVD is of suitable length, with plenty of great Judas Priest classics and newer material from Demolition. The stage and lighting is very simple but effective. The band look very good and play well on stage. There are a few flaws on some solos (Tipton on Painkiller being the most obvious one) but mainly the songs are executed to perfection. A few tracks from the concert are left out, which is a shame; I am especially disappointed that Beyond the Realms of Death was left out.\n\nThe bonus material isn't all that worthwhile - it's nice to watch, but nothing that special. However, that's only a minor flaw - the concert is the main thing, and that part of the DVD is executed in splendid fashion. The show is interesting from start to finish, and Judas Priest and Ripper really show what they're capable of.\n\nDefinitely a DVD worth getting for Priest fans, and it is also a good introduction to Priest for others, despite not having Halford at the front. Excellent release from the one and only Judas Priest.\n",
        "\nThe album that launched Judas Priest into the minds of the masses. That is British Steel. It also started a string of Priest albums that were more or less written to be as catchy as they could. The albums until and including Ram It Down - perhaps even including Painkiller - were written in the same formula. Simple, mid-paced songs with catchy choruses and perhaps a ballad and a couple of faster songs to vary things a bit. This is perhaps a good way to appeal to the masses but as an piece of art, its merits are few. \n\nThe whole album suffers from being overtly pedestrian. Simplistic guitar patterns aiming for catchiness, formulaic songwriting and a mediocre performance by Halford lend this album no credentials to rise among the revered group of Sad Wings of Destiny and Stained Class. Plain heavy metal or hard rock do work in some contexts like say Mot\u00f6rhead, but Judas Priest don't manage to do that. British Steel isn't all bad though. Rapid Fire, the Exciter of the album, strives to break away from the mediocrity of the rest of the album and actually accomplishes this feat along with Steeler though the songs are rather similar with each other and their forefather. Both songs feature excellent lead play by Downing and Tipton as well as increased tempo compared to the clutter.\n\nThe lead work of the two guitarists is what saves the rest of the songs from being a total waste of time. Downing and Tipton may not be technical wizards, but they do know how to write leads. Not much else sets the mid-paced rockers apart from each other. I believe the album would have benefited from more variance in the tempo department. The production on British Steel is very fitting. It is as average and odorless as the rest of the album. Every instrument is clear, in its own space and nicely mixed together but that just adds to the albums lack of distinctiveness. The beginning of Judas Priest's descent into the world of non-flavor.\n",
        "\nWhen you think about it, Kiss choosing their last ditch effort as a audio document of a live show without a video to go with it was really fucking stupid. I mean how the hell were the exactly going to capture Ace\u2019s smoking guitar, Peter\u2019s drum riser, Paul\u2019s smashing of his guitar, and Gene\u2019s fire breathing and blood spitting on vinyl? You what I think the real reason they made a live album was? Because they realized how dull, plodding and ultimately incomplete a good 75% of their shit was in the studio. So it wasn\u2019t an attempt to capture a \u201clive show\u201d it was a sneaky smoke and mirrors excuse to re-record their songs and make them suck less. Sure enough, the plan worked, and let me tell you, that thing didn\u2019t go double platinum because people were trying to figure out where exactly Gene spits fire on Firehouse, it\u2019s because that version of Firehouse kicked major ass.\n\nNow this is of course not to say that all of Judas Priest\u2019s studio songs up to this point were weak sauce, just Starbreaker, and most of Sad Wings of Destiny. Seriously, if someone unironically (or even ironically, fuck irony) tries to credibly claim that the studio version of Victim of Changes is superior to the live version (with a reason other than \u201cDon\u2019t you know you\u2019re driving me insane\u201d was omitted), punch them.\n\nSo while this is still a 100% live album (in spite of what a few snarky mouth breathers may think. Look, just because a few assholes came out of the closet saying their live album is fake doesn\u2019t means the ones who don\u2019t aren\u2019t telling the truth), it\u2019s not so much a concert as much as it is a diplomatic statement: \u201cWe\u2019ve grown and gelled as a band considerably since four years ago, and the way we performed has changed without becoming trendy. We think the way we play most of these songs now is superior to the way we played them on the album.\u201d And God dammit, they were right. Goddammit I wish this was a double live album. CBS couldn\u2019t take a chance with that while Casablanca put out Alive knowing they were gonna either succeed or go bankrupt? Having heard Beyond the Realms of Death from these sessions, I have to wonder which coked up idiotic executive (or band member) decided that was a good idea.\n\nIf nothing else, this album should be owned to hear the Sad Wings of Destiny songs come to life; and eradicate all other life in its path. The closing punch of Genocide and Tyrant. My God, after hearing that closing devastating riff set and Halford\u2019s tortured dying screams, the whole thing is just a divine Shakespearean Tragedy told with screaming guitars instead of actors onstage. Add to that the performance of Tyrant, sweet creamy Jesus. If Exciter wasn\u2019t Ace of Spades before Ace of Spades in that it was the embryo of thrash, this certainly was. With that killer breakdown and that excellent harmonic shredding near the end. Did that part even need to be there? Did it have anything to do with the song? Who the fuck cares? \n\nSomeone at the record company seriously needs to do an excavation into the vaults and give this album the full treatment that Live & Dangerous, Live At Leeds and so many other classics have gotten. Because the fact that the greatest live musical document ever conceived isn\u2019t even a complete account is an outrage.\n\nI can't give it an 100 for being an ultimately incomplete and out of order document, but it's a better product than 99% of the complete live albums every other band releases.\n\nRecommended songs:\nGenocide\nTyrant\nStarbreaker\nVictim of Changes\n",
        "\nWhen I first watched this DVD I was a minor Judas Priest fan; I only owned Rocka Rolla and heard a few of their major songs. I knew they were a great band with a long legacy behind them, but I was never really into them. Then a good friend of mine told me about this DVD, and that I should watch it the next time I was over at his place. After viewing it I went from a minor fan to a big fan. This is why:\n\nContents\n\nThis DVD has quite a bit of material on it that will satisfy any Judas Priest fan. Contained on it are 13 music videos, a live concert of 19 songs (used for the Priest\u2026 Live! album), five TV appearances and a discography. Now, I believe the more crammed on a DVD the better, regardless if the material is pointless or not. That way I feel I am getting more value and the DVD becomes a worthwhile purchase. Even if the DVD has a few pointless features, someone is going to find those particular features worth taking a look at. For those who would find the features useless, they can just ignore them and view the features they find interesting. See, everyone is satisfied.\n\nMusic Videos\n\nThis is my favourite section of the DVD. Here is a collection of 13 videos that date back to Judas Priest\u2019s early 80s era up until 1990. Before watching this DVD I had never seen a Judas Priest video, but I must say they make awesome videos that are very entertaining. For the most part they are not serious videos and are comedic like Breakin\u2019 the Law (one of my favourite music videos of all-time), Locked In and Free Wheel Burnin\u2019. While the majority of these videos may be regarded as cheesy or lame, one must remember this was back in the 80s, and that it\u2019s Judas Priest at the helm. Plus they\u2019re awesome enough to get away with stuff like this. There are a few more \u201cserious\u201d videos such as Painkiller and A Touch of Evil, which were very well done. They add a nice balance to whole collection that makes it feel complete. On a different note, I was rather disappointed with the video for Johnny B. Goode. I have never been a fan of videos for covers. While the video itself didn\u2019t really have anything wrong with it (the video portrayed a typical concert scene), I think it would\u2019ve been better if Judas Priest made a video of one of their own songs; they certainly don\u2019t have a shortage.\n\nThroughout watching this collection, one gets to see a few interesting things about the band itself and how those things evolved or changed over the years. The most specific things I noticed was Rob Halford himself and Dave Holland\u2019s drum kit. It was interesting to see Rob\u2019s many haircuts looks throughout the videos. He even sports a moustache in Don\u2019t Go. The other interesting thing to witness was how as the videos progressed, the drum kit became progressively larger too. I always seem to notice things like that.\n\nConcert\n\nI really enjoyed watching this concert. Seeing Rob and the rest of the band back in their prime was exciting, and made me wish I was around back then. The production and sound quality are excellent; you can hear everything perfectly from the drumming to Rob\u2019s signature screams. That\u2019s one thing of this concert that stands out: Rob\u2019s vocals. He does a phenomenal job that almost outdoes his studio efforts. I can definitely see why this concert was used for the Priest\u2026 Live! album. Also worth mentioning is Rob\u2019s stage presence. He certainly knows how to get the crowd going. I just saw Judas Priest in June and he\u2019s still doing similar things, although not as actively, but one cannot expect 20 years of aging and world touring to not wear someone down. Of course Glenn and K.K. are awesome as well. Their presence adds to Rob\u2019s and makes the whole thing feel complete; you can really tell they\u2019re enjoying themselves while onstage, and that makes the crowd even happier to be there. The set list was pretty good too. To me the opening seemed a tad slow, but the band got the show roaring in no time. They played such classics as Love Bites, Hell Bent For Leather, Free Wheel Burnin\u2019, You\u2019ve Got Another Thing Comin\u2019 and Breakin\u2019 the Law, and finished strong with Metal Gods.\n\nTV Appearances\n\nThese TV appearances are very interesting. They begin with a very rare live performance of Rocka Rolla. This made me particularly happy because Rocka Rolla was the first Judas Priest album I owned, and I knew it from cover to cover. I enjoyed seeing Rob when he was very young and had long hair; he looked much different. Also the band\u2019s performance for Dreamer Deceiver/Deceiver was exceptionally good. Makes me rather watch this live performance rather than listen to the CD. Rob definitely stole the show for that performance. Rob\u2019s vocal performance for Take on the World was terrific. It was kind of short but was pleasant to watch nonetheless. Living After Midnight was dubbed over, or at least appeared to be; it sounded virtually the same as the CD. Nevertheless the band had good stage presence and I don\u2019t doubt it was an enjoyable show. All in all the TV performances were well done and it\u2019s a section of the DVD worth checking out, even if you just want to see the band in their youthful days.\n\nDiscography\n\nThis is the least useful part of the DVD, but, as I mentioned before, someone will find it useful. This section does exactly what it sounds like: it provides a discography for Judas Priest. There are no surprises and the discography goes up until their newest live album, Live in London.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nGet this DVD. Seriously. I would assume most Judas Priest fans would already own it, but if you don\u2019t and you\u2019re a Judas Priest fan, buy it. You will not be disappointed. The concert, music videos and TV appearances make this DVD worth picking up. And if you\u2019re new to Judas Priest, this is a good way to get into them. The DVD makes a perfect introduction to this awesome band.\n",
        "\nJudas Priest is, without a doubt, one of the bands that introduced heavy metal to the world. For over thirty years, Priest has recorded, and released, some of the most mind-blowing songs and albums known in the metal industry. That being said, in 2004, to celebrate their thirty year anniversary as one of the most renown metal bands of all time, Judas Priest released \"Metalogy\", a must-have box set for any metal fan.\n\nJudas Priest's \"Metalogy\" consists of four CD's loaded with the essentials from the kings of metal, a bonus DVD of a live concert and a nice booklet with a detailed history of the British band packed in a very appropriate leather studded box.\n\nThe first four Judas Priest albums are represented in disc one, with one track from the band's 1978 release, \"Hell Bent For Leather\", played live. The track selection from Priest's debut album, \"Rocka Rolla\", is fairly disappointing. Disc one begins with the only song from \"Rocka Rolla\" represented in the entire box set: \"Never Satisfied\". This track definitely belongs on \"Metalogy\". However, one more great song from \"Rocka Rolla\" could have, and should have, been selected: the title track, \"Rocka Rolla\". \n\nThe band's 1976 release, \"Sad Wings Of Destiny\", is represented on \"Metalogy\"'s first disc, as well, with the appearance of three wonderful songs: \"Deceiver\", \"Tyrant\" and a live version of \"Victim Of Changes\". However, \"Genocide\", \"Island Of Domination\" and \"The Ripper\", three great tracks from that same album, are nowhere to be found on \"Metalogy\". \n\nNo mistake was made when five songs from Priest's 1977 LP, \"Sin After Sin\", were selected to be on \"Metalogy\"'s first disc while two of those tracks, \"Diamonds And Rust\" and \"Starbreaker\", are previously unreleased live versions. \n\nAnother five songs from a single LP are represented on disc one, that album being the band's 1978 release, \"Stained Class\". Although \"Stained Class\" is a very good album, I, personally, think it's a little overrated. Therefore, selecting five tracks from this album, and leaving out many Judas Priest classics from the previous years is somewhat of a disappointment. \n\nThe final song on disc one is a previously unreleased live version of \"The Green Manalishi (With The Two Pronged Crown)\", a great track from the album \"Hell Bent For Leather\". Although many great songs are missing on \"Metalogy\"'s first disc, the fifteen tracks that do make an appearance on this disc definitely belong there.\n\nDisc two consists of ninteen tracks from the albums \"Hell Bent For Leather\", \"British Steel\", \"Point Of Entry\" and \"Screaming For Vengeance\". Six songs from \"Hell Bent For Leather\" appear on disc two of \"Metalogy\", the only questionable one being \"Evil Fantasies\", which should have been replaced with one of Judas Priest's quicker tracks: \"Running Wild\", a song that is, sadly, nowhere to be found on \"Metalogy\". \n\nDisc two's next six tracks, two that are previously unreleased live versions, first appeared in 1980 on Judas Priest's LP \"British Steel\". Once again, no mistake was made with the selection of these songs. All four studio recorded tracks from \"British Steel\" are Priest essentials and the two live ones, \"Breaking The Law\" and \"Grinder\", sound terrific. One of the band's best studio albums is very well represented on \"Metalogy\".\n\nThe tracks from Judas Priest's 1981 release, \"Point Of Entry\", are very well chosen on disc two of \"Metalogy\". \"Heading Out To The Highway\", \"Troubleshooter\", \"Solar Angels\", \"Desert Plains\" and an amazing live version of \"Hot Rockin'\" are the songs from that album that appear on the box set's second disc. Once again, an excellent song selection from another excellent Priest album. The title track from the band's 1982 release \"Screaming For Vengeance\" and a live version of \"The Hellion/Electric Eye\", which also appears on \"Screaming For Vengeance\", are the last two songs from disc two.\n\nDisc three consists of seventeen tracks. The first four songs on this disc are from \"Screaming For Vengeance\". Other than that, tracks from only two albums, \"Defenders Of The Faith\" and \"Turbo\", appear on this disc. Judas Priest's 1984 LP, \"Defenders Of The Faith\", is a great album and the boys demonstrate their pride by selecting eight tracks from it, one of those, \"Love Bites\", being a live version. Also, four tracks from the band's 1986 release, \"Turbo\", make an appearance on this third disc. Finally, the last track on disc three is a great previously unreleased demo of the song \"Heart Of A Lion\", a Judas Priest song that first appeared, as a bonus track, on Halford's \"Live Insurrection\".\n\nThere's no better way to start the fourth, and final, CD of Judas Priest's first ever box set then with the title track of the band's 1988 release, \"Ram It Down\". After that comes three more mind blowing tracks from that album: \"Heavy Metal\", \"Come And Get It\" and \"Blood Red Skies\". \n\nThe next album represented on disc four is the amazing \"Painkiller\". Judas Priest's 1990 LP certainly gets its recognition with the presence of six tracks on \"Metalogy\"'s final disc, a aspect that any metal fan would approve of. Although \"Leather Rebel\", one of the nicest and fastest Priest songs ever, does not appear on \"Metalogy\", the track selection from \"Painkiller\" does not disappoint. \n\nSadly, only four songs from \"The Ripper Years\" appear on \"Metalogy\". Many fans were unimpressed when Tim \"Ripper\" Owens joined the band and even less impressed when Priest released \"Jugulator\" in 1997 followed by \"Demolition\" in 2001. Judas Priest certainly changed their style when \"Ripper\" joined the group and although it might have been a kick in the balls for Halford fans, \"Ripper\"'s two albums aren't that bad. Therefore, there are a few more tracks from \"Ripper\"'s two studio albums that could have been chosen. For example, \"Dead Meat\", \"Abductors\" and \"Bloodsuckers\" are all songs that would have fit in perfectly on \"Metalogy\"'s four disc.\n\nJudas Priest's \"Metalogy\" aslo consists of a live concert on DVD. The show is recorded in December of 1982 at Mid South Coliseum in Memphis where the band played seventeen Judas \n\nPriest classics in a little over nighty minutes. Having been recorded in the early eighties, the concert looks and sounds great for its time. The band has a great time playing in front of a crowd that stays energetic for the entire concert. A great example of this is at the beginning of the last song of the show, \"Hell Bent For Leather\", when Halford rides out on stage on his kick-ass Harley Davidson motorcycle.\n\nJudas Priest's first ever box set is a definite must-have for any metal fan. Although \"Metalogy\" has some flaws, its four CD's are packed with some amazing tracks from the gods of heavy metal and a DVD of a great live performance all stored in a beautiful leather studded box. If you're ready to get your ass kicked by one of the best metal bands ever, you should definitely check out Judas Priest's \"Metalogy\".\n",
        "\nAll right, as you now know by now Rob Halford has rejoined the Judas Priest fold. Which translates to 80 percent of their mullet-headed, brain dead fanbase \u201cforgot\u201d that they actually had another singer, you know that guy from Akron, Ohio? Ergo, \u201cPriest is back!\u201d \n\nAnyhow, surely by now you have either dusted off your Defenders of the Faith vinyl or remember that there actually IS a Judas Priest album out there called Jugulator, surely you have all heard the call for the Priest. Angel of Retribution, the first Judas Priest album with the \u201coriginal lineup\u201d in 15 years, so can the almighty Priest do it? Can they break the habit of releasing a stagnant album in the aftermath of a stellar reunion tour? Yes and no. \n\nI won\u2019t lie to you kids, even the Metal Gods themselves are still mere mortals and just like the rest of us they piss the bed from time to time. However, they don\u2019t totally fall into cruise control. We start off with Judas Rising. We get a nice guitar intro that builds up and up and then the drums kick in. I have to say that despite that divided stance that fans have taken from the 97-02 years, this is DEFINITELY the song that screams Priest is Back! \n\nYou have it all, the guitar crunch of Glen and KK, the hammering low end of Ian and Scott and of course, the wails of the mighty Metal God himself, Rob Halford. Some will say that by song title alone, its nothing more than self indulgent dreck but to you I say shut the fuck up, even Judas Priest can indulge in self indulgence once in a while. \n\nComing up next we have Deal with the Devil. Listening to Deal with the Devil right after Judas Rising is like coming down from a speedball: the rush isn\u2019t as intense but it\u2019s still there. A few references to past accomplishments aside, it holds its own in Priest-dom. \n\nNext we have Revolution. This is a question for those wrestling fans out there: you know how once in a while you\u2019ll see a wrestler that has a vintage image? You know you laugh and you remember the good times you had back then? Then you remember the here and the now? Revolution is that song. It\u2019s not bad, it\u2019s just simply too much nostalgia too early in the album for a band that never really went away. \n\nNext we have the red headed stepchild black sheep of the album: Worth Fighting For. This falls into the same category as previous songs such as Before the Dawn, Night Comes Down, and Out in the Cold: you'll either love it because it shows a tender side of Priest or you\u2019ll hate it because it shows a tender side of Priest. This writer does like it but for those that have not heard the album you have been warned and for all the jackasses out there that will continue to bitch, I told you so. \n\nNext we have Demonizer which continues the rapid fire (no pun intended) approach that we had with tracks 2 and 3. When putting the terms Judas Priest and kicks ass together, I don\u2019t have to explain much. However, I would like to note that judging from the lyrics, we finally get to see a written out story of the cover of Metal Works, you know where The Hellion, The Metallian, and Painkiller are duking it out? My money is on Painkiller. \n\nWe keep the adrenaline rolling with Wheels of Fire and to modify my previous statement, when the term\u2019s adrenaline and Judas Priest go together, I don\u2019t have to explain myself. \n\nNext we get Angel, which in all actuality sounds like a nice distant cousin of their revamped revamped version of Diamonds and Rust. As with Worth Fighting For, listen at your own risk and I told ya so. \n\nNext we have Hellrider. This song reads more like a copy of Judas Priest\u2019s Discography for Dummies more than it does Judas Priest circa 2005. Next we have a song called Eulogy. I am suddenly reminded of a previous album featuring an ANGEL on the cover, this ANGEL looked very SAD, he had something wrapped around his WINGS, I think it was called \u201cThe Angel Who Was Sad About Something\u201d. \n\nIn all honesty, not a bad song and definitely a nice build to the album finale: Lochness. Now the epic metal song is something that Judas Priest doesn\u2019t really do. However, for a band that has built its reputation for the past 30 years on whips and chains and heavy metal, they do pull it off. \n\nTo understand the scope of the song, it\u2019s about the Loch Ness Monster. A creature that was supposedly seen in one of Scotland's many lakes and many scientists have theorized that perhaps it is a surviving creature from one of those ages when dinosaurs walked the earth. The song has the perfect buildup required of a heavy metal epic; you can actually picture the creature rising out of the gray mists of Scotland. I have to admit that the chorus is pretty damn catchy and at least for this writer, it does leave a sense of longing for what he knows amongst its listener. \n\nAlrighty then, the album is now over. I\u2019ll be honest; this album is a bit of a builder. When I first bought the album the only two songs I cared for was Judas Rising and Demonizer, but it has since grown on me as a whole. \n\nI\u2019ll be honest with you: there are going to be those that completely embrace this album because its Judas Priest; and there are going to be those that do in fact call it self indulgent dreck; there are going to be those that are going to be disappointed because we didn\u2019t see Rob\u2019s newly acquired interest in black and death metal get a bit of Priest injection. However, there are going to be those that will actually LISTEN to this album over a period of time and let it grow on them in some manner and not automatically dismiss it as some 13 year old girl saying its worse than Turbo. \n\nAt the end of the day if you like it, keep listening to it. If you hate it and can\u2019t stop bitching about it, then get your Cheeto-moustached ass off the computer and go to a used CD store, they do exist for a reason you know.\n",
        "\nPriest's 1988 album \"Ram it Down\" is a far cry from their previous album, being the sub-par, 80s influenced \"Turbo\". On this effort, Halford and the band prepare to win back the fans of the heavier side of Priest with some nice molten metal. \n\nThe album opens with the smoking title track, easily one of (if not the) best Priest song ever. The soloing is completely off the wall, and Halford's vocals are in top shape after sounding a bit shakey on \"Turbo\". One thing that has definitely returned on this album, especially the title track, is the energy that was last seen on \"Screaming for Vengeance\". The band seems really \"in\" to the music, and Halford's vocals are more impassionated than ever before. The second track, the aptly titled \"Heavy Metal\" (there's Priest for ya...), begins with a solo that tears your body limb from limb before careening into a full on assault, chugging riff with Halford's classic high vocals. The chorus is absolute destruction, albeit very simple. Overall, a very enjoyable song. \"Love Zone\" is quite the lame title, but the riffs are not lacking. The drum pattern here is really nice as well. Halford is back with the screeching, the lyrics also have a semblence of continuity with their cheeziness as well. The chorus on this one is nice as well, especially with the addition of the \"marching\" bridge into the next verse (of death). \"Come and Get It\" starts off a bit too typical, but the intro solo is a nice touch (once again). Halford also seems to have settled his voice down as well, but his aggression is astounding. Another nice chorus (1), + Halford's killer vocal range (2) + a riff monster (3) = four excellent songs in a row.\n\n\"Hard as Iron\" is a return to speed, and is a complete riff beast. Halford's vocals are extremely cool, gotta love the doubled low parts. The riffs here have to be heard, as Priest comes up with their best track on the album since the opener. It's songs like this one that make me wonder why this album is so widely regarded as insignificant in Priest's career, albeit, it has to live in the shadow of \"Painkiller\". That being said, the speed found on certain songs on \"Ram It Down\" would have no problem standing toe to toe with \"Painkiller\" tracks, which is certainly saying something considering that aforementioned 1990 \"Excalibur\" of metal records is godly. \"Blood Red Skies\" slows things down a lot, but retains the quality, showcasing a different side of Halford (that one you saw on \"Take these Chains\" and \"Last Rose of Summer\"). The track picks up, and attacks with some potent riffs, but in my opinion, it lacks the power of the previous tracks. \"I'm a Rocker\" - lame title/excellent rock song. Pretty slow, but the chorus is huge, and the energy presented in the track is absolutely amazing, I believe that \"Johnny B. Goode\" is a cover (of which blues musician I do not recall...Chuck Berry was it?). It's okay, but doesn't stand up to the power of the other songs. \"Love You to Death\"...or was it \"Criminally Insane\"? An excellent build-up to a unique riff used in the verse. A real headbanger, gets one back into the music after the sub-par \"Johnny B. Goode\". The album ends in typical epic fashion, \"Monsters of Rock\". Talk about \"anthem rock\"...the first minute of this song wouldn't look out of place on a soundtrack to an epic battle scene. Halford's whispering is nice, the riffs here are killer. A fine end to an excellent, underrated Priest album. Get it!\n",
        "\nMoving further into the 80s, Priest courts controversy by embracing the \u201cglam\u201d sound that was making waves on MTV. With all the new developments metal was exploiting to the full now, this must have seemed immensely lacklustre, not only compared to the old Priest albums, but to everything that was going on. If I was into metal at this time, I probably would have just laughed this album off and gone back to cranking \u201cPleasure to Kill\u201d up to 11. But listening to it in this environment seems to benefit it more. \n\nI have a bit of a weakness for the whole 80s \u201cglam\u201d thing, but even so it seems almost inappropriate that the molten metal machine that is Judas Priest should be making dabbles into it. They don\u2019t do it nearly as well as many bands that were committed to churning out this stuff, but the mix of it here with Priest\u2019s haughty metal sound turns out some sumptuous tunes and marginally less embarrassment than might have been the case.\n\nIt may seem like it doesn\u2019t gel satisfactorily at first, from the perverse pomp of \u201cTurbo Lover\u201d, rife with electronic, inorganic sounding drums and sweeping guitar synths. Though, it\u2019s a popular Priest tune and the fired up riffs beneath the surface do keep it on its toes. Glenn and K.K. are unfortunately understated on the studio version. The production reeks of the Hollywood strip more than anything and does makes it measurably dated compared to their other albums. The main thing for most of it is that the new ideas get more or less overdone, with the exception of Rob\u2019s voice. He\u2019s wilfully holding back his extreme falsettos on this, and attempts to fall in line a bit with the Vince Neil\u2019s of the day.\n\nThe album does work okay in Priest\u2019s favour as they always creep in those undeniably rock solid metal riffs that play crucial parts in \u201cPrivate Property\u201d, \u201cRock You All Around the World\u201d, \u201cOut in the Cold\u201d and \u201cHot for Love\u201d. They aren\u2019t just tucked away into a small corner, instead ringing out loud and proud up with the drums in the mix. See? They\u2019ve still got it. The lavish guitar synth decorates Glenn and K.K.\u2019s solos with a lush coating, and they still rip out some quick fingered, hell blazing fury on \u201cRock You\u2026\u201d and \u201cHot for Love\u201d that leave the rest underneath. Though the dated cheese is not always fresh, \u201cParental Guidance\u201d is an insipid anthem that got them a hit for the album, but loses all touch with the Priest identity still here. Even the fun, pop showiness that gives the album a certain charm loses its flavour with this one. This is just way too prissy for Priest, but I kinda dig the chorus. \n\nThe bonus tracks don\u2019t need much of a mention. \u201cAll Fired Up\u201d sounds like a more typical 80s Priest number but is a weak recording and has \u201cB-side\u201d firmly stamped on it. \u201cLocked In (Live) is another fairly decent live recording but also appears in a different (and probably better recorded) version on the \u201cPriest\u2026 Live!\u201d video so it loses purpose. It does sound a lot more \u201cPriest\u201d without the synthetic layers though.\n\nThey were definitely trying to go some way to emulating the \u201cglam\u201d bands that were flavour of the week, but used their established sound as a convenient foundation, so it\u2019s not totally indistinguishable from the traditional Priest sound. They got more new fans out of it, but realised this wasn\u2019t the direction they were most comfortable in, and four years later we get \u201cPainkiller\u201d. A winner is you!\n",
        "\nI pride myself on being objective about metal records. True, I can't resist dropping in my fanboy moments (look away from that Train of Thought review), but on the whole I like to think that I'm one of the more objective reviewers on this site. Pure oozing metal man-love is a nice read, but does it help you choose what records are good enough for your hallowed collection? At the least I try to offer something in my own particular idiom. Now that that's out of the way... Angel of Retribution.\n\nAoR is a record that is aimed for the long time Priest fan, which is all things considered the way it should be and probably the only way to go because Priest's reputation has suffered over the years with the mainstream. So, like good little elves, Priest stuffs every nook and cranny of this record with references to older works. You can scarce go ten feet in any direction without stumbling over tyrants and painkillers and sentinels soaring down on sad wings from blood red skies, and frankly its a little distracting. I appreciate that they are embracing their history (if not so much revisiting it), but when you reference say, \"Deceiver\", you invite comparisons to past triumphs that you more than likely cannot top. But hey, they don't have to anymore do they? FINALLY, Judas Priest is in a position where they have general good faith on their side. All they had to do was beat Demolition and Jugulator and people would be glad to worship at their (w)heels. Mission accomplished guys.\n\nTruth be told, Angel of Retribution is an admirable record in a lot of ways. Yep, I ADMIRE a Judas Priest record. That fact alone is enough to make this entire Angel of Retribution experience worthwhile for me. I admire them because they decided not to ape their old sounds and ram a whole album worth of British Steel or Painkiller-lite down our collective throats. This stuff is pureblood heavy metal, with a welcome side of classic rock, and the results are occasionally lovely. \"Worth Fighting For\", for example, houses no truly innovative thoughts but my fucking God, its mellow Judas Priest that manages to be moving. I don't give a damn about the lyrical content (which is actually quite good on this track) or the story being told, I am moved by the purity of these riffs, by the warmth and passion in Rob Halford voice, by a solo that (no lie) can put a hitch in my throat by being so honest. Honesty alone, something that has been lacking from Priest's work since Hell Bent for Leather is enough here, the sheer absence of artifice and pretension helping me to accept Angel of Retribution into my heart.\n\nThere's a sweet naivet\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd here, a nostalgia invoked even on tracks that are utterly alien to the Priest catalogue. \"Lochness\" is a bloated, overwrought piece of epic doom that has such a silly base (its about the fucking Lochness Monster!) that you laugh and accept Priest at face value because they conceal nothing from you. We're writing songs about children's stories, and we're writing them with utter seriousness and considerable heaviness. Well okay Priest, I'll let it pass and rock on without regret. Yes, the song is artificially extended (most ill-advised faux-fade out ever) but Halford is so thespian, his performance of these words so inspired and those riffs so damned heavy and propulsive that even this befuddled boggy abortion becomes worthy of the thirteen minutes spent on it. And hell, lyrically it isn't even that bad. Were it not for the screaming fact that this song is being written about the Lochness Monster, these lyrics would rank as perhaps the best on the album.\n\nRob Halford rarely shreds his upper register as he did on past triumphs, but in exchange he delivers a heartfelt and impeccably chosen performance that leaves a deep impression. Halford was often saddled with the job of saving the band from its own stupidity, the man gifted with an innate ability to deliver us from the demons of cheese, his undeniable talent and sheer presence making us forget words like 'vaporapeize' and songs about forced oral sex. He faces his greatest test here on \"Angel\", wherein he is charged to stand alone and redeem an irredeemably sappy song. Seventh-grade quality poetry, and an opening few minutes in which he is near enough acapella, left to endure the attentions of the unbelievers who inevitably laugh at the fragility of it. Rob Halford delivers a sobbingly emotional performance, raw and yet perfectly shaded. The way his voice wavers on those opening few bars, almost tricking us into believing he hasn't got what it takes to make this thing work, then grows stronger and more confidant as Tipton & Downing contribute a stirring Spanish-flavoured acoustic guitar line underneath, building up to the point where it works in spite of itself, like \"Lochness\". \"Angel\" reminds me of works like \"Last Rose of Summer\" and \"Dreamer Deceiver\", and although it is not a classic by the very fact that Priest is able to evoke such tender memories of their 70's output I am compelled to honour their effort.\n\nPriest doesn't neglect the more extreme aspects of their sound either, immediately obvious from the opening of \"Judas is Rising\"/\"Hellrider\"... err, sorry, they apparently forgot that they used that trebly guitar intro twice on the damned record, but in spite of this little lapse the trio of 'intense' Priest songs (\"Judas is Rising\", \"Demonizer\", and \"Hellrider\") is highly impressive. Of the three, my favourite is \"Demonizer\" which features quite a lot of vengeful preaching which I as always dig, particularly the delivery of the line \"Its Gideon's quest to take Satan's throne!\". Now, I always thought that Gideon was a guy who distributed little red bibles to school kids, but I guess I was wrong. \"Demonizer\" is all evangelical fire and brimstone and the riffing is deadly, both of which can be said about \"Judas is Rising\" which is actually pretty damned good lyrically. It\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds always interesting when you get power metal through the looking glass, generally from bands who predate the form and know how it SHOULD have been done. \"Hellrider\" is the weakest of the trinity, being too much of a construct in some ways, too pseudo-Painkiller in a way that \"Demonizer\" somehow isn't, but even so the almost churchy outro riffery is bloody brilliant.\n\nAnd wonder of wonders (he says, gleefully hopping to a new topic), Tipton & Downing have excised the wretched modern soloing of the Owens years and have created varied, interesting, and memorable solos of a quality at least on par with the Painkiller album. Consider closely the solo-riff section of the deathly catchy \"Revolution\", or the jagged Dave Mustaine-like whammy-wrecking first few seconds of the \"Demonizer\" solo which descends into hearty shredding, more riffing, and an almost \"Victim of Changes\"-like solo fill which churns into more riffing underneath a shattering Halford vocal.\n\nAnd oh, oh... \"Deal with the Devil\" is another one of those freshly unoriginal tracks that kicks ass. It gives off vibes similar to Maiden's \"Wildest Dreams\" (one of these days I'll review Priest without mentioning Maiden, I fucking swear it...), its a 'we built this city on [metal] 'n' roll' type lyric, its a standard quick-but-not-speed riff, with standard darting solo-fills coming out of the woodwork (Scorpions were probably best at this)... and its just so effortlessly crafted that it seems timeless. It is perfect for driving down the road to a concert, gettin' juiced on heavy rock, hanging out with your buddies. And if Rob talks about whips and chains, who's to know and who'll judge? Not I.\n\nIf it sounds like I'm making excuses left and right for Angel of Retribution, well, I'm not. Angel of Retribution is cheesy at times, poorly thought-out at others, even laughable (\"Conjures up an ageless spell/guarded by the sentinel\" in a ballad ferthaluvvagawd) but it rises above (on sad wings or something) this to be their best record since 1984. Most times when bands try many different styles on one album, they're just throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks and more often than not the only result is a shitty wall and a half-baked album. Others have every song the same and the effect is lost (Painkiller, Dehumanizer, Reign in Blood, etc.). Here, Priest has made a diverse album that has an impressive array of stylistic changes track to track (the first four tracks particularly), and if it isn't as overflowing with ideas and ethereal creativity as Sin After Sin, at the very least it makes me think of that record.\n\nJudas Priest has made a record that is flawed, but not deeply so, and good, but not profoundly so. It is a record that takes steps forward by refusing to stagnate, by denying the sins of the 90s, by not being afraid to be metal in all of the commercial suicide glory of that word. They even launched this record in the same week 50 Cent's massively popular The Massacre was released. So as an album, it was quite good and worth your hard-earned dime. As a testament to Judas Priest, and as an album that creates a comforting warm in my belly, Angel of Retribution is worth more than words.\n\nStand-Outs: \"Worth Fighting For\", \"Demonizer\", \"Deal with the Devil\"\n",
        "\nLast night I was out shopping, looking for the perfect present for my adorable girlfriend, of whose name I\u2019ve forgotten at this stage. I wanted something cute, something cuddly and something as trendy as a lipstick tube that contains over one thousand and one shades of pink. Then I saw it. I locked eyes on it, going into stealth mode as I crept down the aisle, making sure that others were oblivious to my movements. My hands grasped the jewel case of the large ringed object, a gem on anyone\u2019s mantelpiece. It was Judas Priest\u2019s \u201cPainkiller.\u201d The album that stole my girlfriend and saw me land out of her door into the mud-filled gutter with a spine-crushing thud as she wrapped the wrapping paper on my head like a broken party hat. The CD came last, striking me between the eyes, knocking me out with the force of an origami spoon, a soggy origami spoon. Not that I cared, I was in hell.\n\nDrill sergeant Robert Halford gave me my mission as we stood on the edge of the world. I was dressed in an over-worn faded black t-shirt, jeans with ripped knees and a broomstick strung around my neck with an ingenious strap made out of a mix of an old kite string and a colourful collection of rubber bands. I was not wearing a backpack. The edge of the world doubled as my garden shed, made out of corrugated iron that had reached boiling point in the sweltering sun, causing my bare feet to tingle as my the warm northerly wind blew through my hair. I did not feel any pain, as a painkiller was present in my blood stream, or should I say, THE PAINKILLER. My mission was simple to destroy all that opposed, with strength, honour and bravery. I set off zealously, but not before falling eight-feet to the ground, back first, careering into the concrete below. Again no pain was felt. \n\nAdrenaline was rushing to my head as the thunderous drums spurred on my one-man army, as we attacked the enemy with frenetic riffing, in mixture with intricate soloing. They did not know what hit them as the Metal reigned supreme, unleashing its fury like a dragon scorching a prince into crispy smithereen. No sex for you, you lascivious wench-like princess. Comrades rejoiced everywhere as Speed Metal influenced by traditionally flavoured Metal, incorporated with palm-muting, melodic tremolo and the epic embrace of tonic power chordal structures. This was brutal. Even more brutal than those modern gore bands that blast at 391.62 beats per minute over visceral guitars played using a bone from a small child as a plectrum. They could not match our purposeful mindset as we stormed at them, \u201cAll Guns Blazing.\u201d The voices in my head were relentless, even higher in pitch than the queen of banshees, and yet as melodic as a tenor, as they guided me to the final glory. \n\nI ventured to hell and back, seeing vast landscapes of fire, as Satan bid me \u201cGood luck.\u201d Down picturesque streams I flowed, harmonious choruses rolled by in clockwork motion, as cleansing as the grandeur enforced by the Painkiller. As soulful and as elegant as the night sky, yet as mysterious and ominous as the stars that fill it like a back-lit canopy. The end was nigh, but not before one final stop through the LSD trip of 70s influenced disco era. In my bright pink suit I stood. Of course, slaying the \u201cteenyboppers\u201d I found with my handcrafted plastic pirate sword, then I ventured back to my garden fernery and held a seance with a friendly brigade of garden gnomes, feeling \u201cA Touch Of Evil.\u201d The battle was won, as we stood under the banner of heavy fucking metal, pride in our people, the saviour was found. We crushed the machines as they attempted to invoke a \u201cMetal Meltdown\u201d, destroyed the enemy and in the process saved ourselves from facing the wrath of an enraged Mother Nature.\n\nThe British lads obviously sat first row of the class all year in economics, as this is the perfect example of capitalist efficiency, six beautiful solos in the first song! (Hell, the chalky haired, glasses toting nerd that is their economics lecturer would have been proud of this practical application! An A+ for you chums, even a complimentary chocolate chip cookie because you did so damn well.) Not once does it let down from that point on. That was until tears formed in my eyes as I realised that the last track was fading out\u2026 \u201cOne Shot At Glory\u201d, indeed. What else, you say, chaps? Nothing, just a sullen silence after the CD stops spinning. I sat there for an hour, not moving, not knowing what to do next. My whole left arm still trembling a week later. This sure is better than getting a haircut from your next door neighbour\u2019s lawn mower, getting chased by the dog that still has a huge chunk of the postman\u2019s leg between its jaws or drowning in a pool of liquidised Siamese cat shit. It may rank up with some of the great inventions, such as convicts, snooze alarms and Vegemite. In fact, I\u2019ll be audacious enough to recommend it to you, faithful student of Metal. Skip along now, children, I need to rest my weary body. For some reason I felt a dull ache in my back, and my feet were red as a lobster, warm enough to cook a piece of toast on\u2026\n",
        "\nI've been shocked by some of the criticism this release has received. I know shouldn't be, but damnit, I just am. There is a little bastion of people out there in the Metal community who like the idea of setting themselves up as the most tuned-in, finger-on-the-pulse people there are, the sort of people idiots like me need to tell them what's good. The sort of people who - quite rightly - dislike the automatic high marks releases like Angel of Retribution are going to get from the mainstream Metal media (alliteration, kids!), but then do the most fucking stupid thing imaginable by convincing themselves the opposite is true. They then proceed to trash the album with the same horrifying delight (behind a facade of feeling let down, of course) that your average Kerrang! hack takes in spewing his sycophantic praise over it.\n\nNow I'm not saying that every negative review of the album is based on this premise, but we all know who these people are and how they get their kicks out of feeling more enlightened than everyone else.\n\nAnyway, rant over, onto the review. Is this Stained Class? No. Is this Painkiller? No. Is this easily better than the depressing attempts at staying young Priest put out in Halford's absence? Fuck yes. Without wanting to belittle the excellent Tim Owens, Jugulator is one of the most embarrassing CDs in my collection. I know this isn't exactly a refreshing thing to read, but Hell, it\u2019s true. The fact is, the return to a classic Metal style by Priest after Halford's return would have been better than their 90s output almost by default. Even Turbo part 2 would have been acceptable, and it pains me to say that.\n\nThe good news is that this album is good. Not classic, but seriously, very good. Better than Turbo by some way and simply pissing on the dreck Priest put out when trying to latch onto the Thrash Metal sound ten years too late. The album opens with Judas Rising and after the quiet build up this song just kicked my arse. Yeah, after a few listens it did occur to me that a slightly faster opening track may have been a better idea, but this is a great song. And just listen - duelling guitars in a Judas Priest song. What a novel idea. Fucking late 90s. Anyway, the second song is Deal With The Devil and it keeps up the kicking of my arse from the first track. Not as memorable as its predecessor, but Angel of Retribution definitely opens with the essential 1-2 strike of Heavy Metal album.\n\nAnd then? Yeah, Revolution sucks (See! I can criticise this album!). Worst song on the album, easily. The same boring, generic rock riff over and over again. I did start to worry a bit on hearing this one. I've got no problem with making an obvious single, but Christ, at least make it a GOOD obvious single. The only plus point is that this is maybe the first time in Priest history you can clearly hear Ian Hill.\n\nWorth Fighting For has taken a lot of stick, mainly for not being heavy enough, which is one of the most gormless things you can criticise Judas Priest for. I mean, Screaming For Vengeance was hardly necro was it? The song is ballad-esque (the power ballad on this album is yet to come) and is about struggling on bravely when you believe in something and all that jazz and damnit if it doesn't get the old hairs on the back of the neck standing on end. Priest have done this sort of song before in the past, and better too, but that doesn't detract from how enjoyable this one is in its own right.\n\nNext up is Demonizer and my arse is well and truly kicked once more with this little slice of Painkiller. This is the closest thing on the record to that album where Priest flamed out so gloriously, with Scott Travis' double bass pedals getting a good exercise for the first time since the opening track, and the guitar is oddly reminiscent of when Slayer were a good band.\n\nWheels Of Fire is an up-tempo rocker that feels more like British Steel/Screaming For Vengeance era-Priest than anything else. Not exactly memorable though. Next up is Angel, the previously hinted at power ballad. This is not what the band is really known for, but it works. I like it. The gentle acoustics eventually give way to electrics and disappointingly, not much of a solo, but Halford's emotional vocals really shine on this track... \"Put sad wings around me now...\u201d Aw, Hell yeah.\n\nHellrider gets the tempo up again with another nod back to Painkiller. KK and Glenn just fucking smoke on this track, and Rob's double-tracked vocals screech with serious menace. We then move onto Eulogy which, while good, perhaps could have been better. The piano on this mournful tribute to the rise and fall of bands (at least that's what I got from it) is played by the returning Don Airey. I like the feel of this song; I just wish Priest had gone a little further with it. It's gone almost before it has begun, if you know what I mean.\n\nAnd then...THEN...it\u2019s Lochness. The naysayers can shut the fuck up - this song is immense, and it just isn't a second too long. A 13 minute song about the Loch Ness Fucking Monster...how can it not be incredible? Alright, I jest - this song could have been a disaster, but the fact is that it's not. From the Sabbath-esque riffing at the beginning through to some truly incredible vocal melodies that mask the admittedly silly lyrics, this song is a beast of the proportions of the titular creature. I can't recommend it enough, it's just so haunting, menacing and strangely tragic. Really awakens the overly-sentimental Scottish bastard in me.\n\nSo...Angel Of Retribution isn't Judas Priest's best album. Did we have any right to expect it to be? I don't think so, not after a 14-year gap in the writing process. This is still a top, top album and easily one of the better releases of 2005 so far.\n\nFor fans of: Iron Maiden, Dio, and just Heavy Metal in general.\nTop songs: Judas Rising, Demonizer, Lochness\n\n8/10\n",
        "\nYou know, I really wanted to give this album a good rating. I really did. Nothing woulda pleased me more than to be able to say that \"With Halford back in the fold, Judas Priest will once again rule the metal universe! 10/10, 5 stars, 100%!\", but there is no way I can do that after listening to Angel of Retribution.\n\nThe album doesn't start off too bad with Judas Rising, the anthem declaring that Judas Priest has returned, and the only song on this record that deserves to be included in the band's live set when they go on tour. I really don't like the guitar riff, which is downtuned and repetitive, sounding like something ripped off from *insert bad modern metal band here*, but other than that, it's a decent song.\n\nThe second track, Deal With The Devil, in contrast to Judas Rising, opens with a classic Priest riff, and is a solid fast number... Until you get to the chorus, which reminds me of Devil's Child, the closing track off of Screaming For Vengeance. Not that Devil's Child is a bad song, it's just a slow one, and its chorus is definitely outta place here.\n\nThe next song, Revolution, follows the cliched 80's hard rock/pop metal pattern of \"Hey, let's have just the drummer play on the verses, and then we'll all come in for the chorus! Yeah!\". Sorry guys, but it's been done ad nauseum...\n\nSo, one third of the way into the album (well, trackwise, anyways) and I'm no longer seeing Angel of Retribution as Priest's return to form. I'm thinking that there's no way it gets 100 percent, but maybe a 75 or an 80, which isn't bad. Unfortunately, it gets worse from there.\n\nTrack 4, Worth Fighting For, starts off with a good bass riff from Ian Hill... but unfortunately, it's a ballad, and not a very good one, either. The next two tracks, Demonizer and Wheels Of Fire, sound like Ripper Owens material, with downtuned guitars, and Halford sounding like a bad cover band singer. Hell, if those two songs were recorded when Ripper was still in the band, all the Halford lovers would probably think they sucked, too.\n\nSo, after two mediocre rockers, what comes next? Another ballad, of course, and perhaps the sappiest one Priest has done to date. As a longtime fan, I honestly think that Angel is the worst Judas Priest song ever (with Halford that is, I won't even get into the Owens years...) - yes, even worse than Eat Me Alive and Turbo Lover! I can't even imagine what coulda been going through the guys' heads as they were recording this one... \"Look out, world, Judas Priest is gonna take over adult contemporary radio!\" Yeesh!\n\nFortunately, they manage to save grace (somewhat) with the next song, Hellrider, which sounds like a reject from the Painkiller sessions, making it the only song on this record that woulda fit on Painkiller. I don't care for the backing vocals on the verses, but it's the first decent song I've heard past track 2, so it's only a minor nuisance.\n\nNext comes Eulogy, which might as well be called \"The Epilogue To Beyond The Realms Of Death\". They even find a way to slip the words Stained Class into the lyrics. Fortunately, it only lasts for 3 minutes.\n\nSo now, with the record almost over (or so I thought), I figured I had to reevaluate my position. I was thinking about giving it a 60, or maybe a 65, tops, when along came a song that could challenge Angel for worst Priest song. Loch Ness is Priest's attempt at writing a power metal epic (a la Rime Of The Ancient Mariner, perhaps?). Well, either that, or Sony told them that they weren't gonna settle for anything less than a 52 and a half minute long record, and when the band had 9 songs clocking in at less than 40 minutes, they decided to play one great big long song to take up the rest of the time.\n\nThere is just so many things wrong with Loch Ness. First of all, the lyrical content. I mean, the Loch Ness Monster? Not surprisingly, I've never heard a metal song about it before, seeing how it stopped being believable, or even interesting, for most people when they turned 10 years old. (Grow up, Rob!)\n\nAnother annoying aspect is the operatic backing vocals on the chorus. They work fine for the likes of Blind Guardian and Virgin Steele, but sound terrible behind the aging Halford's wails. (Perhaps it's time to admit you're not Bruce Dickinson, eh Robbo?)\n\nBut, without a doubt, the worst thing about this song is the fact that it drags on, and on, and on, and on, until you're about ready to take the CD out of the stereo and bash yourself over the head with it. I mean, the first \"ending\" (since it seems like the song will end) around the 8-10 minute mark (I forgot to make note of the exact time) was lame enough, what with the choral singing, and all, followed by Halford showing us how long he can hold a note for...  but then the song keeps going! For another four fucking minutes, no less! By the time it finally ended, my mind was made up; I had no choice but to give Angel of Retribution the first failing grade of any album I have reviewed for Metal Archives.\n\nNow, I don't normally slam records just for the sake of slamming them, but, honestly, Angel of Retribution ruined my day. This was my most anticipated release of the year, what with Halford being back in the fold, and all. Having left us with Painkiller, and then going on to release an excellent solo album in Resurrection, I was expecting more of the same from Halford here. And, while the vocals weren't the most disappointing element of this record, I was really bummed out after hearing it.\n\nHaving thought about it for a while, I suppose what makes this album so bad is that Judas Priest, as a creative entity, seems to have stagnated. All the songs on this record sound either recycled, or just unPriestly in the first place. Maybe it's time for the boys to stop putting out new material and just stick to the touring circuit. Me, I never thought I'd see the day when I'd say that Iron Maiden was way better than Judas Priest, always having been more of a Priest fan, myself, but comparing Angel of Retribution to Maiden's latest, Dance Of Death, would be like comparing Poison's Look What The Cat Dragged In album to Bethoven's Ninth Symphony. That's how wide the gap is between the two NWOBHM legends these days. Needless to say, I no longer worship the ground Rob Halford walks on.\n\nNow, in case I haven't made it obvious, I'm pretty bummed out about this record. So much, in fact, that I considered taking it back to the store after one listen. I didn't, however, although I did go to a used record store and picked up Fight's '93 release, War of Words. Maybe if I can fool myself into thinking that it's the new Priest record instead of the piece of trash I purchased a couple hours earlier, I'll be able to convince myself to shell out 50 bucks when (if?) they come to town in support of it...\n",
        "\nThe Priest is back!!! Rob Halford is back in the trenches of the metal war with Downing, Tipton and Hill and the band has finally found that rock and roll groove that made them a powerful force in the late 70's and early 80's. Sure, the fucking nerds (you know who you are you pencil necked pieces of shit) will whne that this isn't \"Painkiller\" but this...in my opinion is MUCH BETTER in many ways. THE PRIEST OF THE 70'S ARE BACK!!! The production is tight (possibly a little too tight) \n\nI normally don't do song by song breakdowns...but with a record of this size it's absolutely fucking nessecary. So here we go...jumping on the wings of the \"Angel of Retribution\"... \n\n1. Judas Rising: This is the records classic. No doubt. The opening tribute (but not rip-off) to \"Victim of Changes\" flows gently like a stream and eventually builds into an epic boiling sea of guitars and drums that function more like a classical piece than a piece of heavy metal. Rob's lyrics and summoning voice bring out the apocalypse and it's forms making this song the albums TRUE epic and an emotional opening to the return of the Gods. \n\n2. Deal with the Devil: There is no doubt that this is the catchiest number on the record. The hammering opening riff and catchy vocals show that Priest can still deliver the goods like anyone else. The chorus will stick in your head for the next year and thats what really matters here. This is probably the catchiest thing the band has done since \"Jawbreaker\". \n\n3. Revolution: This call to arms is the worst track on the albums but is by no means bad. The band sway and crunch through a strange 1970's styled song that works new things into the old \"United\" style anthem. It's a lot of fun, but hardly the reason to buy this record. \n\n4. Worth Fight For: This odd 1980's ballad will please many and piss off even more. It's not a metal tune, but is quite creative despite what seems to be a slight Kreator nick. Otherwise...it's a quality ballad type tune if you dig that sort of thing. \n\n5. Wheels of Fire: This is one of my faves...total rock and roll and lyrics to set burn rubber and leave the world behind. This track is a total rock and roller that the \"Painkiller\" fans with hate, but the fans of the great rock and roll past will love. Eh...fuck'em! \n\n6. Demonizer: Whoa...this megaton \"Stained Class\" meets Slayer monster has some rather silly lyrics but is a catchy cruncher overall. This will take a listen or two...but the groove and shouts of \"...out demos out!\" will win the masses over with nary a moment! \n\n7. Angel: This second ballad is quite powerful with its references to \"Sad Wings\" and it's sad vibe that hooks someone in and shows them the softer side of Rob Halford's voice. If one needs a comparison, the bonus track \"Turn on Your Light\" from \"Defenders...\" is the closest song to this. Rob puts on a clinic of notes here that needs to be recognized for it's catchy chorus/melodies. \n\n8: Hellrider: This is another classic that mixes the classic 1970's vibe of Priest and mixes it with an intense Slayer vibe. This is a classic despite the rather silly lyrics and Rob shows that he is in firm control of the mic. Such dramatic delivery from the Metal Gods show that even in his mid-range he understands the epic nature of the chord changes. \n\n9. Eulogy: This little ballady piano piece is quite fun but the lyrics are leading up to the guffaw-inducing final track. This should be listened to on it's own...as the lyrics aren't have as offensive until we move into... \n\n10. Lochness: HA! The music on this piece if amazing. The opening strains of guitars-as-babpipes and the ominous main riff rule the house. Sadly...the lyrics will please the geeks and give them a \"monster\" to enjoy. This is sad really...and I only hope that Rob himself has a sense of humor about the whole affair. We can't explain it at all...but...the music and vocals rule...right? \n\nFor all you geeks, nerds and video-game losers who wants another record built for drooling and not-getting-laid I'm sorry. This album isn't for you. Get lost, go play your dungeons and wagons crap and get the fuck out of my face. Judas Priest has found the rock and roll lust that drove them intially and delivered a quality slab of heavy fucking metal that might not challenge their legacy...but it sure as hell fucking rocks. \n\nBuy or die ya geeks! \n\nhttp://www.judaspriest.com\n",
        "\nJudas Priest attempted one last great stab with \"Demolition\" that found the band taking on every trend around it and desperately fumbling for a hit to bring the name of Judas Priest back to the forefront. Sadly, this effort is sloppily produced, the songs are goofy, the vocals aggravatingly \"tuff-guy\" and the entire concept falling through the tracks. The quite-cool album art can't save Priest from the fact that on \"Demolition\" they find themselves churning out sometimes entertaining fluff that would rate as purely disposable had the name Judas Priest not been shamefully connected to it.\n\nThis record does have a few good moments such as the BRILLIANT \"Close to You\" (I'd love to hear Rob sing this one), the double-crunching \"Feed on Me\", the grooving \"Subterfuge\" and the rather quirky ballad \"Lost and Found\". The 'heavy' songs each have their moments such as the opening riff to \"One on One\", the amazing chorus to \"Metal Messiah\" and the rather groovey opening riff to \"Hell is Home\". Sadly, none of these songs work as cohesive units and the lyrics are just dumber than dumb. This shows a band that simply couldn't cut the fat and were too worried about hitting all the right trends than they were in writing a solid album that reflected vision and poise. This sounds like a sloppy mess with a few brilliant moments that entertain from time to time...just enough that Priest fans were praising it in early moments only to realize that lack of true value shortly thereafter.\n\nSome people will like this album as it is a passable 'rock' release. Does this hold a candle to anything recorded in the Halford days? No. Does this rate as anything worth remembering in the grand annals of heavy metal history? No. Judas Priest are not back with this release...they are simply a fading concept that sometimes works as junk food. These songs are entertaining in the way a million disposable Metal Blade bands have been entertaining...it's fluff that one really would have no faith in if not for the brand name attached to it.\n\nIt's pathetic really...teen angst with passable cheese-rock hooks may entertain for a moment but marked the band for death until Rob Halford made his glorious return.\n",
        "\nPainkiller II this is not. Hell, Turbo II this is not. What we have here is an awesome performance from Tim Owens, with Judas Priest here in name only. The band, for some reason, decided to get \"modern\" and tune down from E to C#, which doesn't really sounds as good when your singer can fucking wail (the most recent Iced Earth tour showed us how good Tim can be), as well as making it sound muddy. There are also FAR too many \"intros\" to songs (which fails miserably). The songwriting really lacks here, as can be evidenced in Glenn's lyrical abortions (Hell Bent For Leather these are not). It's almost as if he's trying to force brutality on us, but it just sounds like Cannibal Corpse b-movie cheese (see UltraBoris's review concerning this). The good riffs are few and far between, and we know Priest can do better than this. This album lacks the \"happy\" and/or \"positive\" feel that most Priest albums have a good percentage of (One Shot At Glory, Reckless, et al), and just tries to come off as pure aggression and spite, and unlike Painkiller mauling you like Kodiak bear with its riffage and odes of glory and kicking ass, Jugulator is akin to a Chihuahua humping your leg with its faux attitude.\n\nAll that aside, we have 3 above average songs. Jugulator is cool uptempo speed, but as said earlier, the lyrics are atrocious. Bullet Train fucking slays, and Cathedral Spires is also exceptional, and was their longest song (until the 13:22 tarpuddle from Angel of Retribution known as Lochness). These 3 were worth the $4 I paid for the album, and unless you see this in the bargain bin or in a cheap used CD section, you're not missing much.\n",
        "\nWHY? That's the only word my tortured mind could muster after the last track on Angel of Retribution came to a close. A legendary band with killer albums under their belt, back from the dead with the one and only Halford returned at the helm...and THIS is what came out of it? What a horrible, horrible disappointment.\n\nAfter waiting expectantly for a chance to give a listen to the newest album from one of my favorite bands, I finally got my grubby little paws on it and excitedly hit play. Judas Rising started slowly, gradually building up to an explosive riff that made me sigh nostalgically and think of classic Priest songs. After a great opening track, Deal with the Devil kicked in and I said to myself \"Ah, Priest is back!\"\n\nRevolution came right after and after a promising intro, I waited for it to coalesce into that wonderful musical point that makes Judas Priest the classic band they are. And I waited for an entire four minutes and forty-two seconds before I realized that the song was over and there would be no point. And that's when it all turned to shit. \n\nEach and every track from Revolution on was a pile of worthless rock crap. It dragged on, bored me to tears with lackluster riffing, lame-ass drumming and in many of the songs I was even disgusted with Halford's vocals. He has far too much talent to be reduced to a horrid mallcore reject. Those familiar with Halford's piercing high notes and dynamic range will be sorely disappointed by his monotonous vocal delivery on most of the tracks. Worth Fighting For nearly made me cough up blood with is sheer vileness, being reminiscent of a cookie-cutter pop rock track that wouldn't feel out of place on a Bon Jovi album. Demonizer attempts to revive the album, but the pace it sets is quickly destroyed when the riff-work is recycled throughout the song so many times it loses it's appeal. Hellrider suffers the same fate, and Wheels of Fire makes no attempt at interesting the listener by basically using the same riff throughout the song coupled with elementary drumming. Angel and Eulogy are so disgustingly boring I died a little inside. A ballad should add another level to the album, not be a tedious obstacle to work through. The solos on the album feel contrived. They feel interjected, as if the band added them simply because that's what metal bands are supposed to do, not in any effort to add texture to the song. They're nearly always located at the same point in the song (3/4 of the way through) and last for approximately the same amount of time. While technically not bad, they are neither impressive nor at least engaging. The album ended with the vomit-inducing Lochness where, alongside Worth Fighting For, Halford gives his most uninspired vocals. Finally, the torture was over.\n\nIt was clear how much of a loser this album was when I turned it off and I was in actual physical pain. Angel of Retribution is so bad, you feel as exhausted as if you had been running a 100km race, if not more so. It was an insult to not only my musical taste, but also to my intelligence. It was entirely too watered-down and formulaic, which is not what a good metal album should make you think. And, there's a difference between dabbling in rock n' roll style, which is what Priest has done in the past, and incorporating lackluster modern rock into a majority of your songs at the expense of originality. In order for me to EVER listen to this again, I'd either have to be insane or dead. It really isn't worth it for the two good songs, either. The only place this album should be found is at the bottom of a trash can. Waste. Of. Time.\n",
        "\nThis, this is what you call a comeback! The Priest is back! Oh man am I thrilled to hear a new Judas Priest record in the year 2005, with Rob Halford back on vocals! Seeing these guys at Ozzfest last year made me believe hard and strong they still had it, well Im glad to say I was right!\n\nRight from the start you knew Priest was back with a vengeance(This line was used but it was the first thing that came to my mind) and ready to rule the metal world once again. The opening of the record comes off strong, with some light guitar playing that could give a man chills. Halford comes tells it like it is on the first track, Judas is Rising! Man this guy can still sing like this? I couldn't believe it when I had the honor of seeing them live, but shit! \n\nIf you think it's over better think again! Yes! If you think it is over, well think again buddy. Priest are calling you for an ass kicking. \"Revolution\" the first single on the new record. Now when I heard it I will admit, it took some growing on me. I did not hate it at all, but I was hoping for more of a painkiller sound to it. Well each and every time I heard I liked it even more. Just knowing the Priest was back and still putting out quality work like this was good enough for me.\n\n\"Deal With The Devil\", boy oh boy my favorite track on the album. Now I will admit there is nothing special or amazing about this song. The thing that gets me is the classic sound it has to it and with Robs awesome voice...damn does it capture me. The duo of Tipton and KK is just top notch. Lets not look over the drums though, really nice loud beats that stand out. The song is the total package for a classic in the making. \"Demonizer\", the name along sounds Priest like. Really just a full out assault of the ears from all over. OUT DEMONS OUT!\n\n\"Worth Fighting For\" and \"Angel\" are both the more mellow tracks of the new record. Both songs give the album a real nice break from the pure aggression the other songs have in them. Robs voice is truly one of the Gods. After all these years he can still sing like this, god damn! Really beautiful songs that make me love Judas Priest even more. Angel is more of the standout mellow track as the guitars are really toned down while Robs voice is powerful yet mellow as can be. \n\n\"Hellrider\" is the final track right before the 13 minute behemoth that is to come. This sounds like something you want to hear when you are about to march into war! This very easily could have been on Painkiller 15 years ago, just awesome stuff right here. Again, another song that fits Judas Priest so well. You want riffs? HELLRIDER! The final track on this epic is the 13 minute plus track \"Lochness\". Really a fine way to end such a great album, mellow, strong, fast, mellow, strong, fast. Again the guitar duo of KK and Tipton are just awesome and with Rob just doing what he does best it really makes you wonder how these guys still do it. \n\nThis ladies and gentleman is classic Judas Priest that is coming to you in the year 2005. I know I sound like a damn sales person here, but I am trying to make you all believers on Judas Priest returning to the top. This album is what metal is all about, excellent vocals, lyrics, solid guitar playing and when you got Judas Priest doing it....you can't go wrong\n",
        "\nThis is an odd start for the beast that is the Priest. It\u2019s not metal, and for the most part, it\u2019s not catchy either. Thin guitars and poor drumming plagues this album, but hey, it\u2019s from 1974. Besides, this is the only album where Ian is always audible. It\u2019s overall pretty weak, but does have some excellent tracks.\n\nOne For The Road is decent at most. It\u2019s not memorable and pretty weak. The title track is a little bit better, but still not good. The riffs on these two are pathetic and except for Rocka Rolla\u2019s outro, the solos blow as well. The Winter Suite spells acid in more ways than you can think of, but actually is pretty good. K.K. unleashes his whammy bar fury here, which still sounds wickedly insane to this day. Cheater is the catchiest song on the album. This will ensure that you won\u2019t fall asleep on this album. Never Satisfied is the heaviest and most metal song. Although it won\u2019t brutalize you, it does warm you up for what comes next.\n\nThe main highlight is Run Of The Mill. Featuring anti-old age lyrics and solemn, mesmerizing solos from Glenn and K.K., this song lifts you up and takes you away. K.K. even does a 3-minute solo, but Glenn\u2019s opening solo and licks are much better. Lots of atmosphere is found on this one. The lead work is the best on the debut and Glenn\u2019s are just pure brilliance. The screams at the end are intensively sick and are some of the best wails Rob has ever done (a true feat done here). I\u2019m surprised his sac didn\u2019t burst in the studio when he did those. The next song, Dying To Meet You, starts out slow and features Rob holding notes extremely long, foreshadowing his brilliance to come on later releases. It\u2019s much heaver than the previous track. The second part is very catchy and features the best and most memorable riff, which is also my favorite riff of the album (the one before the solo and right before the song ends). This oddball ends with a short instrumental. Real smooth guys, real smooth.\n\nThe weakest Priest album ever, and only blues-rock Priest album, mostly due to the production. Rodger Bain, Sabbath\u2019s producer for their first 3 albums, really fucked up here. The riffs and drumming don\u2019t pack any punch at all. Amateur lyrics are found all over, but it is their first album. Rob even uses a harmonica on two songs, oh the horror! Although personally hated by the band, it\u2019s somewhat of a gem. For die-hard Priest fans only. If you\u2019re not, than get any other \u201870s album from the one, the only, Judas Fucking Priest!\n",
        "\nOn the heels of the strangely alluring but overall disppointing Rocka Rolla comes a COMPLETELY different album in the form of Sad Wings of Destiny. Most Priest-elitists hail this hearty chunk of classic to be their choice album, banishing the Painkiller babies off to hell. While I won't compare this to Painkiller, as they are two entirely different albums, I will say that in my eyes, it comes very close to said godly album.\n\nWhile some call this an early incarnation of speed metal, and indeed it can be, I rather label this album as a piece of straight forward heavy metal (with a few twists for good measure). Coming from the catagory of the former, Tyrant tears the ground up after the Prelude and shows us a much altered side of Priest than from the year prior. Speed rock/metal riffs dominate this crowd pleaser, which is brought to it's full potential on the killer Unleashed in the East (1979). Genocide slows things down a bit, but not the insensity, which is consistant through Epitaph and Island of Domination where Halford shows us a preview of what is really to culminate later on in the album.\n\nVictim of Changes, perhaps one of the greatest metal songs of all time. I actually prefer this version to the beefed up one on Unleashed, simply because of the ambience that is achieved through the studio environment. Going from a crushing riff in the verses, to the absolutely killer pre-interlude, to the trippy, slow interlude itself, this track doesn't stop for a second. Until it's done...right.\n\nFollowing this is my personal favourite on the album, that is The Ripper, perhaps even encompassing the previous track in it's sheer pwnage. That scream at the beginning is completely inhuman, challenged (and maybe even bested) only by the brutal shreik at the beginning of Dissident Aggressor (Sin After Sin album). It's a quick song, but an effective one. This classic album ends with the duo Dreamer Deceiver/Deceiver (strange name...) which is part ballad, part undefined. An actual GOOD ballad from Priest (not that Take these Chains is terrible, but at least they actually wrote this one).\n\nHighly recommended for everyone. I would introduce a person to metal with this album, as opposed to the popular though of an early Sabbath album. Pwnage.\n",
        "\nPriest, at first glance, seems to be a band of even numbers (the same way Star Trek is I guess). Basically, here's a simplified look at how many Priest fans feel about the catalogue. Rocka Rolla isn't too popular. Sad Wings of Destiny is the near unanimous choice of the classic Priest-heads. Sin After Sin is considered just too odd, not nearly as good as the rest of their stuff. Stained Class is another masterwork. Hell Bent for Leather/Killing Machine is too funky, too much of a change. British Steel is a classic. Point of Entry was a disappointment. Screaming for Vengeance is the best Priest record. Defenders, while good, was a step down... and then the band sucked until Painkiller.\n\nThat's a good description of how many view Priest's catalogue. That doesn't mean it's right at all. In fact, in my opinion it's almost totally wrong. The first big wallop to the party line is the fact that Sin After Sin is not only better than anything Priest released after 1979, it's also one of the greatest albums anyone ever released, period. This is a Priest stupefyingly beyond the pale, crafting an album full of experimentation and bold intelligence that puts to shame the claim that metal cannot play in the same league as the mad geniuses of rock royalty.\n\nTrue, Sin After Sin does not come down and redefine music in the way Sad Wings did, but really it could've had people decided to follow the path Priest was meandering down. The album is no less innovative than it's predecessor, but it's like the world was too busy trying to be like Sad Wings to even try to master the almost magical profundity barely contained on this little compact disc (or at the time, considerably larger black vinyl). Sadly, yet also fortuitously, Priest was literally starving, and couldn't afford to continue on in a direction that wasn't getting any attention. Therefore, the band would continue on in a mesmerizing (and virtuosic) series of massive stylistic shifts, the band moving on to futuristic uber-technical masterworks on Stained Class. This band literally went through ELEVEN big changes in a row, ending at Ram it Down.\n\nThe first big move was acquiring the inhumanly talented Simon Phillips on drums. This guy is seriously the most unique metal drummer since Bill Ward (in a totally different way), from the bouncy clapping drum rolls on \"Starbreaker\" to the amazingly textured cymbal-wash opening \"Raw Deal\". The guy manages to make cymbals of all things beautiful and eye-opening. It's true, the guy's odd style is a little distracting at times, but Sin After Sin wouldn't be Sin After Sin without it.\n\nJudas Priest may have made a name for themselves with one-dimensional hits like \"You Got Another Thing Coming\" and \"Breakin' the Law\", but this record more than any other shows them literally doing 180 turns song in and song out. It may be disconcerting for some, but to me it's like finding a gold mine, and then discovering it's also an oil well, a diamond deposit, and home of the finest steak house in the greater Harrow area. If the album was simply bi-polar and full of schisms between the tracks, I would not be so kind, but they do every style better than any influence you might find, and more often than not are inventing a whole new sub-genre that none who followed could touch.\n\nOpener \"Sinner\" sounds both newer and older (it's the guitar style I think) than the stuff on Sad Wings, an epic as unlike \"Victim of Changes\" as musically possible, maze-like and full of interesting production choices, most notably the OutKast-style repetition of the \"god of the devils\" line (check out \"Hey Ya\" if you can stomach it, the \"shake it\" bit). The solos are hot, Rob Halford electric (change those adjectives around and my review might come off as a little less innocent), Simon Phillips Simon Phillips-like.\n\nI think \"Diamonds and Rust\" may be the best example of metallizing a non-metal song as of 1977, and perhaps the first commercially successful one (on a very small level) as it soon became the 'drug of choice' for metal acts looking for an in on the business (Anthrax = \"I'm Eighteen\", Heathen - \"Set Me Free\"). It's also solidly thrashy riff-wise and features a brilliantly sombre Halford performance, the melancholic lyrics perhaps actually revealing his under-utilized talent at singing lyrics that don't involve forced oral sex or winged saviours from out the sky.\n\n\"Starbreaker\" belies the cold reputation of early Priest, the song finding grooves more easily than temporally-adjacent KISS and rocking out measured and headbang happy. Priest always had non-sense lyrics at times (later: all the time) and \"Starbreaker\" is no exception, the song apparently about some sort of interstellar ladies man come to spread his alien seed around the same cycle on which Haley's Comet swings by. Seriously, practically all of the references to 'paradise' and 'star voyage[s] to a new world' could easily be taken as euphemisms. In any case, the song as a sweet break ('Starbreaker lead us on, and on, oooon....') and an even sweeter solo, one of my favourites out of a catalogue wherein nearly every solo is pure gold.\n\nNow, naysayers be damned, I like \"Last Rose of Summer\". It isn't like we're trying to challenge Altars of Madness of Necroticism here, it's a ballad in the trippy, dippy 70's style. Rob is alarmingly warm and gentle here, elegant phrasing and some delicate shading making it a good song to quiet those who write him off as a guy who just screams his head off. And for the Painkiller kids in the family, a song to hide in the closet and deny 'til the end of time. I'm not sure what the deal is with the background vocals are on about because they get creepy after a while, but otherwise Rob is a perfect ten and Simon's soft drumming chops (not to mention Tipton and Downing's melodic leads) get some nice exercise before the next onslaught.\n\n\"Let Us Prey\" is a brilliantly church-y intro, organ-like lead guitars and Halford's out of this world wail introducing us to Priest's most Purple song, and also the song in which Priest proves that in general, they're way better than Purple ever was. This is an update on Purple speedsters like \"Fireball\", \"Speed King\", \"Highway Star\", and \"Demon's Eye\", that old guitar style very similar save for the fact Priest is playing at such unhealthy speeds that often you can't tell. Here the writers are obviously a little upset with the media who panned Priest's early records and ignored the hell out of the brand new ideas served up on the preceding platters. At least they don't chew out magazines by name the way Axl Rose did in musical form. Priest busts out a fiery lead duel that shames anything Purple ever did (well, maybe not \"Pictures of Home\"), Halford pronouncing from his high-upon-high metal god throne, Phillips in the boiler room playing some super-fast fills and jamming in as many sounds as possible into the standard fast-drum style. I just wish I had something to say about poor Ian Hill.\n\nYet another total switch-up. Virtually nobody remembers that Priest used to be pretty damn funky, tracks like this and later \"Killing Machine\" and \"Burnin' Up\" grooving (in the true, general music definition of that term) like no other metal band before or since. This is Purple's hackneyed white funk (and God forbid, Zeppelin's horrific white reggae) done right, Rob Halford giving us a tour of a gay bar... errr, western saloon (I'm sorry, but read the lyrics) while the band cruises by in a bouncing low-rider. Furthermore, the song contains what I consider to be one of the first mosh breaks, the basic blueprint for any number of neck-snapping Anthrax/Pantera breakdowns, as well as one of the most dramatic ride-outs in rock history. Have I mentioned that Rob Halford is the most amazing singer in all of metal?\n\nNext, another ballad yet in no way similar to \"Last Rose\". This is the type of dripping sorrow that you can share with your snarling denim 'n' leather buddies. It's slow, gothic, almost like a psyched-out alternate universe version of The Gathering. Rob is so reserved on the first part of the song, Ian Hill droopy and mercurial (Yes!), Phillips acting texture and feel through sparse drums... and then the more brisk acoustic guitar moves in. Really, this is the most \"Victims\"-style song on the album, sorrow and resentment mixing as the song gradually builds. The crunching guitars supporting operatic wails in the heavy part of the song are perfect, this highly melodic doom feel permeating your innards, the loss implied expressed so perfectly that the only comparison at the time was the emotional connection of terror in \"Black Sabbath\". The final 'here come the tears' are so eerie because it sounds like Rob is singing 'land of the dead' which is so appropriate for the crashing epic finale of the song.\n\nAnd now for something completely different.\n\nGoofy little drum fills, sound effects, unidentifiable instrumentation, a build up to.... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Is that even human?! On a pair of headphones that noise is so high-register that your eardrums feel like bursting. Hell, it's enough to blind you for a moment to the incredibly heavy riffs being pounded into your skull. Like nothing else, operating on a level nobody else was even thinking about, \"Dissident Aggressor\" is no less than the most advanced metal written by '77, in fact, heavier and more intense than anything up until around 1980. It's amazingly brief as if this kind of power can't be kept up for long, more metal than Satan lyrics, riffs and sheer mind-melting power that had me literally flattened against the mattress (do most of my listening in bed) with my mouth agape at the damned song. If I'd be walking down the street I may well have fallen over. Then, I ruined by throat snarling along in my best death metal growl. If this song doesn't make your head bang unsafely, you may very well be dead. And the solos, the solos! It literally sounds like Tipton and Downing picked up some forked tridents and started spearing demons and casting them writhing into the light, their death-screams recorded for use in this ultimate plateau of metal power. Really, metal has rarely been better since.\n\nAnything after THAT would be an anti-climax, but the light and loose \"Run with the Devil\" eases you back into reality with it's catchy, light riffing and solid performances from all involved. After that, a nice live version of \"Jawbreaker\" (apparently the band didn't perform many of the tracks on this record that weren't already on Unleashed in the East) closes the affair in a fine fashion.\n\nYou know it's albums like this that make me embarrassed about the choices Priest made post-79. As good as British Steel, Screaming for Vengeance, and most of all Defenders of the Faith are, they'll never be as flat-out great as this stuff. The creativity was drying up, the brilliance nearly used up, the band destined to a future of ridicule from the lay-man, and to be slotted in behind upstarts like Iron Maiden in the great metal sweepstakes. Still, we should bow toward the undeniable genius that Priest once had and, if a miracle happens, may yet regain. Sin After Sin, the most experimental Priest record and ultimately one of the most satisfying.\n\nStand-Outs: \"Dissident Aggressor\", \"Starbreaker\", \"Here Come the Tears\"... okay, that's virtually random. Any track would do.\n",
        "\nNow, I'm doing the Priest albums in a very strange order, basically as the spirit moves me in fact. I've reviewed a few of their 80's/90's records previously, and I've made it clear that this period is far from my favourite era of the band. That would be the 70's, Sad Wings through Unleashed in the East. However, Priest released one album afterwards that I love nearly as much as those classic five records, and it ain't Painkiller. Simply put, Defenders of the Faith is virtually perfect from front to back, and it stands head and shoulders above the three preceding albums and the eight afterwards (counting live efforts).\n\nReally, this is a Priest back where they belong, virtually stripped of the overt commercial aspects of British Steel, Screaming for Vengeance, Turbo, and God forbid, Point of Entry, brawny and filled with muscle, yet still writing in that rarified Judas Priest zone that nobody, not even Maiden, was allowed to operate in. It's almost baffling that Priest would follow the mechanized KISS-of-death hit \"You Got Another Thing Coming\" and the majority of Screaming (the more commercially palatable tracks) with an album darker, heavier, and possessing few songs that could even chart, let alone become massive hits on par with say, \"Living After Midnight\". It's even more baffling that they'd pick quite possibly the least commercial track (over more conservative choices like \"Some Heads Are Gonna Roll\" and \"Love Bites\") as the lead-off single, \"Freewheel Burning\" getting virtually zero airplay and probably shedding many of the casual fans Priest had acquired over the past sunny, perfectly yellow tour by submerging them in a blackened speed metal maelstrom.\n\nThis album is simply incredible. Priest continues to tool about on their speed metal machine, perhaps taking the manic sound of \"Screaming for Vengeance\" and locking it in through the tighter framework of an \"Exciter\" or an \"Electric Eye\", raw and scrappy guitar sent forth with a laser focus, locked and loaded. Halford, track one, screaming enough for a dozen dying NWOBHM's, both hyper-verbose and shrieking maniac within the chorus alone, sinister and steely leads along with pounding rhythm (albeit with some really poor fast drumming from talentless hack Dave Holland) making this race-car fantasy (with appropriate, if you think about it, race track engine-revving riff) into something forceful and somehow darker. It's not thrash really, perhaps less down that path than \"Hell Bent for Leather\" five or six years back, but comprising a lot of the feel and tonality of that genre. It's kind of appropriate that, with the genre almost totally established in the year this was released, Priest would let this aspect of their sound drift away for a number of years, before desperately trying (and honestly, usually failing) to get it back through parts of Ram it Down and most of Painkiller.\n\n\"Jawbreaker\" is a bit more tame, a strange guitar sound that is tough to describe, somehow clacky and dry, Halford often left high and dry to carry the song with his thespian snarls (truly one of the better character singers of all time), with he succeeds in doing in spades. This song doesn't really have enough high vocals (Check out the live version from the Sin After Sin remaster), but other than that it carries the load as a catchy, riffy, slightly speedy track that grows on the listener as one becomes acclimated to the sometimes strange production tones found on this record.\n\nThe following track, \"Rock Hard, Ride Free\", illustrates a rather fundamental point that Priest lost after this record (alright, some of it still existed on Turbo), and that was a certain blue-blooded nobility they alone possessed. The beginning of this song is all class, the band proving that their own harmony-lead work was equal to the more prevalent Maiden flavour, and also that despite this classy style they were also more down and dirty participators, Maiden constantly aiming high, Priest relinquishing that torch (lets say around Stained Class) and just having some fun now and then. The song is amazing mid-tempo Priest, this sharp track getting the 'awesome people on bikes' motif in a way that \"Desert Plains\" failed to do, and with a catchy but woefully un-radio style that endeared them to their pundits without having 'sell-out!' screamed at them as the masses aimed for the Jugulator.\n\nNow, \"The Sentinel\" just ambles up and borrows the aforementioned torch from Maiden, a thoroughly modern epic that nonetheless harkens back to a younger, smarter Priest with an oddly religious chorus that inspires one to scream along anyway, even if Rob is going at such a high register that it's hopeless for anyone to try to keep up. The middle of the song is lead duel magic in the vein of \"Tyrant\" or \"Painkiller\", truly hot licks being traded back and forth between masters of the form, leading into a synth-laden spoken section that rumbles and shakes and builds up to the inevitable, stupendous chorus.\n\nIt's true that the album fades a wee bit from here on out, as \"Love Bites\" widdles on a little too long and takes a long time to grow on one, but eventually I got into it, really digging Halford's inflections, appreciating the production tricks and nice echo effects, even nodding along with a smile at the strange and sparse melodic lead break/solo/thing. \"Eat Me Alive\" is passable musically, sorta less awesome speed metal, but stuck with some of the worst lyrics of the Priest catalogue, the kind that are so pathetically vicious (see: Jugulator) that Priest nearly loses ones respect.\n\nThankfully \"Some Heads Are Gonna Roll\" rocks simple and brilliant, like \"Better By You, Better Than Me\" and \"The Green Manalishi\", strange because I'm not sure if this is a cover because (like \"(Take These) Chains\") it's credied to someone I've never heard of and a song that I've never found under any other artist. In any case, the melodies are sublime, a sly smile and slight bow at the waist, a pumping headbang to truly Priestian perfection. I love the song, every sound seems crafted, none of the hollow production that somewhat marrs the rest of the album.\n\nAnd hell, \"Night Comes Down\" is hardly a ballad to be honest. It rocks harder than any of the somewhat cheap power ballads that tend to be appended to most of these remasters, and also moves with a sorrowful doom like \"Here Come the Tears\" or even \"The Rage\". It's pretty comforting to think that, while other bands were selling their souls with overt power ballads, Priest didn't (their's were auctioned in other ways). They still wrote them, true, but they didn't release them. Instead, they didn't break the dark and heavy mood of this record and they give us another flash of the old sound that creeps out on occasion.\n\nThe end of the album comes off as a slight disappointment, a simple but crowd-pleasing riff where Rob gives us some more cheap lechery. It's a little odd when band's write songs that are directed towards their fans (the last chorus) that are also about, apparently, having sex with them (the rest). For Rob this isn't so much a problem, although I imagine he has better taste in partners than the average pimply-faced rocker who attends one of is concerts (although Holland might not), but Glenn, Ian, and K.K probably feel a little bit defensive, \"Heavy Duty/Defenders of the Faith\" is obviously written to be played live (\"Take on the World\", \"United\") and as such doesn't work nearly so well in the studio with no masses to sing along.\n\nAlthough it has flaws, Defenders of the Faith is a darkhorse favourite of the catalogue, stomping all over more obvious, and more brightly coloured, champs like Screaming as the kingpin of latterday Priest. The cover sucks, the production is off, and Dave Holland sucks, but there is no denying these songs and the performances of the rest of the band. This is a cornerstone of the Priest catalogue, and a shining monument to the power of metal.\n\nStand-Outs: \"The Sentinel\", \"Freewheel Burning\", \"Night Comes Down\"\n",
        "\nI guess I'll never understand the metal world's love affair with this one. Yes, this is better than Turbo and Ram it Down, but it's not one of Priests best efforts. I love the fact that these guys stood up and said 'yeah, we fly the flag for metal and we're actually gonna try to participate in this whole thrash thing', and when this album is hot it's red hot. It's hard to find better slabs of boiling metal than \"Painkiller\", \"Metal Meltdown\", and \"Between the Hammer and the Anvil\", but in between it's like biting tinfoil, Priest writing dumber lyrics than I'd thought possible (remember, Jugulator wasn't out yet) and really just trying too hard to recapture their youth.\n\nThis not to say that musically Priest has rarely been better. Halford is like a man possessed, really taking his vocals to their logical extremes and just generally screaming his head off. At times it's eerie, Halford displaying an almost King Diamond-like flexibility in taking off from growl to screech, but with about a million times more force and technical ability. Downing and Tipton have completely forsaken the more melodic soloing of Turbo in favour of an even more extreme version of what was attempted (and failed at) on Ram it Down, shredding like men half their own age. The solos throughout, but particularly the title track, are about as loopy and speedy as they'll ever get, but perhaps lacking in the intelligence of some of their classics. I also sorta feel that new drummer Travis is a little intrusive, his double-bass insanity and generally busy style almost getting out of hand.\n\nThis is a Priest album crafted for the metal heads who wanted \"Freewheel Burning\" for a whole album, edgy and extreme in every way, but with a slightly glassy eyed stupidity that has been crippling this band since approximately 1979. It's like a comic book, every song seeming to wish to escape from the reality into this brightly coloured and shallow world where you can say words like 'vaporapeize'. I understand this, because Priest was in a bad way at this point, slowly being usurped by Maiden as the classic metal of choice, slumping album sales, and of course the idiotic trial and Rob Halford's struggles with living a lie. That is the simple explanation for why this album is totally obvious, everything on the surface with no depth and really no thought required. Bang head, sing the chorus, everything is okay.\n\nWhile the lyrics are the all-to-obvious Achilles heel of Painkiller, there are other issues that gang up and ruin the parade. Consider \"Leather Rebel\" for a start. There's nothing all that wrong with the catchy chorus or rockin' riff, but it just feels warmed over, like any one of a dozen Priest albums served up to you to gobble down once more. The drumming too, man, just a Racer X drum track grafted onto a regular Priest song, disconcerting and totally throwing off the whole feel of the song. Hell, on the live track thrown onto the remaster Rob seems bored off his ass and itchin' to get out of the damn chaffing leather and into... well, he did wear it in Fight and Two as well, but cut me some slack.\n\n\"Once Shot at Glory\" is a boring, boring, boring anthem, something that aside from the man on the stick and the man banging the skins could've been performed by any third-tier power metal act without creating any waves. The \"Hell Patrol\" has a really kickin' chorus too, but the lyrics are just absolutely laughable. There's just something about Halfie screaming about 'devil dogs' and making up words to fit a rhyme-scheme that reeks of a man totally fallen out of love with this metal muse, a fire that would wane through a pair of adequate Fight albums, be completely snuffed out on the infamous Two project, only to reignite on his solo records, although there's something about them that indicate a slight depression that he's locked into this figurative straightjacket, or even an iron maiden if you will.\n\nRegardless, this is Judas (\u201cfuckin\u201d optional) Priest, and they are still one of the greatest metal acts of all time. The love affair with this album, like British Steel and Screaming for Vengeance, is not entirely unwarranted. \"Between the Hammer and the Evil\" brings back the religious themes of the early records with stunning results, band tight and locked in, Travis behaving himself as the Metal God rewards us with a conventional (!) singing performance, and therefore a relatively unique one on the album. \n\nAnd hey, I never said Priest and speed metal couldn't be cozy bedfellows, and the energy of the musicians combined with their sage-like knowledge of how it works (they were one of the primary practitioners of the early form) serves them well. \"Nightcrawler\" works both as a creepy Halford vocal platform and as an instrumental knock-out punch, the guitars lusty and feral and Rob ferally lusty (for the blood of innocents), also recalling favourably \"The Sentinel\" with it's spoken break and epic style, thankfully without that song's mechanical window-dressing. \"Metal Meltdown\" is exactly what you'd want from a track called \"Metal Meltdown\", a thrashed out guitarfest that is all intense, all the time, and with an essentially great base (or at least essentially hot performances on a hot riff) so that it stands out from the rest of the maelstrom.\n\nOf course the best track is \"Painkiller\", that conceded by everyone with a pulse and brainwave activity who has heard the album, screaming through your skull and pounding away at the tasty mush inside, six minutes of pay-off, amazing bit leading to amazing bit, from the crazed drumming to the multi-tiered solos, to Rob grabbing his balls and incinerating ours. The song is absolutely astounding, because it should not work. There are about six false endings to this thing (or maybe this is just how Scott does fills), and the lyrics are uniformly stupid, but unlike on the rest of the album where you just wish you were listening to something of substance, it's just like 'yeah, I'm rocking so hard that it doesn't matter'.\n\n\"Painkiller\" the song is what Priest wanted for this whole album. Alas, thoughts can only be suspended for a short time, and only when what they're being aborted for is worthy of the effort.\n\nStand-Outs: \"Painkiller\", \"Between the Hammer and the Anvil\", \"Nightcrawler\"\n",
        "\nWhile I am often outspoken about my opinion that Judas Priest is, and has always been a superior band to Iron Maiden, it's albums like this that really conspire to shoot my thesis to little tiny metal bits.\n\nMaiden, I feel, is not a consistent band within the context of their albums. True, Maiden has had an almost unparalleled run of well-regarded records stretching from the self-titled debut (hell, from Soundhouse Tapes) through Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, each spawning songs of terrifying innovation and brilliance that are near enough to universal metallic grails that everybody from Death Metal Dave to Prog Metal Perry can enjoy them without shame for ever and ever. However, outside of Piece of Mind and perhaps the Dance of Death, Maiden doesn't really have any albums that, to my mind, are must own records. They are a greatest hits band if you will.\n\nPriest on the other hand is completely the other way, i.e. when their albums are good they are virtually perfect all the way through (Sin After Sin, Hell Bent for Leather, Defenders of the Faith) whereas when they are bad they have almost no redeeming qualities (Demolition, Ram it Down, Jugulator). I myself prefer a catalogue that, while full of holes, has plenty of whole ALBUMS that you can really sink your figurative teeth into. However, there are two exceptions to this catch-all to my mind, those albums oddly being their best regarded by modern metalheads: Screaming for Vengeance and Painkiller.\n\nScreaming has as powerful a start as you could possibly imagine, which alone makes it worth consideration after you've bought everything the band released prior to 1980, as well as '84's classic Defenders of the Faith. Imagine back in 1982, after the solid but uninspired British Steel and the banal, blase Point of Entry, you decide on a lark to pick up this intriguingly-titled new release. First thing you hear is a new-found/rediscovered confidence and that almost aristocratic class that is the hallmark of classic Priest. \"The Hellion\" is a spine-chilling intro, 30 seconds of Maiden-improving power that leads into what has to be the most melodic and commercially acceptable speed metal of all, \"Electric Eye\", one of those steadily increasing building blocks towards the creation of power metal proper with the advent of Helloween.\n\nIt's funny how the album straddles the line between British Steel-style avoidance of huge frightening high notes on tracks like \"(Take These) Chains\", \"Electric Eye\", and \"You Got Another Thing Coming\" and insane going off the falsetto deep-end tunes like the wavery \"Ridin' on the Wind\" and the shrieking mayhem of the title track. Moving further in this direction Priest seems to be trying to please both camps at once, the existing and potential commercial fans brought in by British Steel and Point of Entry and the mildly depressed and considerably disappointed metal heads who live for the Stained Class/Hell Bent for Leather side of the band. Hence, mediocre groove-based stadium rock like \"Bloodstone\", \"Fever\" (perhaps this one is a little novel), \"Pain and Pleasure\", and of course the mechanized Kiss-stomp of \"You Got Another Thing Coming\" sits uneasily beside proto-power metal like \"Ridin' on the Wind\" and viciously AC/DC-style crunch on \"Devil's Child\".\n\nThe majority of the band is actually top-flight this time around, Downing and Tipton really flexing on shreddy solos like \"Screaming for Vengeance\" and bendy melodic ones such as \"Bloodstone\", all riffed with a tight and sharp execution, the blatantly commercial aspects wrapped in an undeniably metal armour. Rob Halford is at his bravura best, whether he's (clich\u00e9 alert) screeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeamin' on the title track, displaying fine range on \"Devil's Child\" (really kickin' live performance on the remastered edition), or practicing a sly restraint on \"Electric Eye\", convincing you of some sort of unearthly technological intelligence beyond your skill to grasp. Unfortunately Holland is his usual shitty self, playing horribly uninspired and limiting drums that really make you resent the loss of Binks, and nobody really gives a damn about Ian Hill.\n\nScreaming for Vengeance as an album is painfully great when it's on, painfully meh when it isn't... sorta like a lot of those Maiden albums I mentioned. It's also unfortunately the next to last really good Judas Priest album (say 80+ scoring range), as their post-Defenders output is truly shameful, although a few remaining bastions of genius like \u201cPainkiller\u201d and \u201cOut in the Cold\u201d that have kept the flame alive for those of us awaiting all these long years for their (hopefully) triumphant rebirth. The new album is in sight. Will it be able to compare to the classics? We shall see.\n\nStand-Outs: \"The Hellion/Electric Eye\", \"Screaming for Vengeance\", \"Devil's Child\"\n",
        "\nJudas Priest returns after their classic \"Stained Class\" with a very worthy follow-up album. Killing Machine contains several Priest staples, each of which can actually be found in better form on the 1979 release \"Unleashed in the East\". The first thing one will notice is the better production than the previous Priest releases. The guitar sound is much heavier than that of Stained Class, and the mix also contains more bass. The faster parts sound fresh and heavy, and the vocals are not too high in the mix (a la Sin after Sin). \n\nNow for the songs themselves. Well, I shall get the bad out of the way first. Before the Dawn is crap, it really goes nowhere, and I don't say this simply because it's a ballad. It's just a crappy ballad, medicore guitar work and minimal drumming. Even Halford sounds strained on this track. With the bad out of the way, the good is very, very easy to focus on. Depending on which version you own, the title track is either Hell Bent for Leather or Killing Machine. Both songs are equally great, with the latter being my favourite on the album. \n\nHell Bent for Leather is a fast paced number with a heavy as fuck intro, that nicely slides into speedy verses and one of the most catchy choruses this side of Breaking the Law. The solo in the middle is also one of the best that Priest recorded, especially the tapping bit. My only problem with this classic is the length, which only clocks in at a measly 2:39. Killing Machine is a much slower song, but even better due to the subject matter of the lyrics and the evilness of the guitar work. That part at 0:39 (I got a contract...on you!) is an absolute audio orgasm. This combined with rather unorthodox vocal work from Halford (rather low and midpaced) makes for a tremendous song.\n\nRock Forever is another honourable mention, with a sweet riff carrying the song through the intro and after the chorues. Halford brings in another incredible vocal performance, definitely another catchy Priest classic. And of course, who can forget the Priest live staple The Green Manalishi. Think AC/DC meets Iron Maiden, with Halford on vocals. Nice lyrics too. (Yes, I realize it's a cover). \n\nGet this album, it's high on the list of classic Priest studio albums, with only Painkiller, Vengeance and Destiny beating it out.\n",
        "\nPriest returns once again, this time providing a follow-up to the roaring Screaming for Vengeance. Were they able to top it with Defenders? No, but that doesn't make the latter a bad album by any means. The first word that comes to mind is different, very different. I would say that Defenders has more of a melodic feel while still maintaining the raw heaviness that Screaming brought.\n\nThe production is tight, and Halford sounds better than ever, using his higher voice for much of the album. Guitar work is stellar as usual and the rhythm section stays in the background to hold the rest of the insanity together. The album opens with \"Freewheel Burning\". Oh man, this song has to be at least 30% of this entire rating. Just listen to the parts at 1:55 and 2:45. This has got to be the heaviest song they had written at the time (equal to or even surpassing Screaming for Vengeance). \n\nWhat else is notable about this album? Love Bites is a tight, old school heavy metal song with a sort of sing-along beat that may not appeal to all, but the guitar work, although simple, holds the song together well, even leaving room for the bass to sneak in some haunting lines. The Sentinal really runs along the lines of an Iron Maiden song, honestly, if I didn't know any better I would say it was an outake from Number of the Beast. An absolute ripper of a song, more speed metal to be found here. Halford's voice is aggressive as hell during the verses. Just listen at 1:34...badass.\n\nEat me alive...some scary lyrics here, starts with a happier sounding riff, then into a very simple, 4/4 beat with said lyrics over it. Nothing terribly special, the riff behind the chorus is decent, but overused in the annals of metal. Some heads are gonna roll is another pretty good, fast paced song with a few memorable riffs and the such, but nothing special from Priest. Night comes down...horrid. The only real shitty song on the album, but I suppose it is mandatory to include the ballad. \n\nHeavy duty is next, again, another basic heavy metal song. Nothing really special, but still very good. The final track, Defenders of the Faith....how catchy is this? I can imagine this being a great sing-along for the crowd (as is shown in the live bonus track). Even the guitar riff behind is pretty cool.\n\nA definite keeper of an album, not Priest's best, but still an excellent metal album.\n",
        "\nFollowing up on \"Rocka Rolla\", we have an equally strange, crazy release, this one entitled \"Sad Wings of Destiny\", and this is one we all know and love, unless we suck, cause this is one of the most essential, legendary and mindblowing metal albums ever written. \n\nThe overall sound and production is less dark and gloomy than what sometimes was evident on the debut album, but this is not all happy and fluffy kittens, no sir. On \"Victim of Changes\" for example, we have a rather depressive perspective both in lyrics and mood, which is pretty fucking well done. And remember, this was released in 1976, not 2004, when all mallcore kids are running around screaming that their life sucks. This is in the crazy hippie-days, which you could see on the clothes Priest wore at the time. And while they did sound a bit weird and almost proggish back in the day, their music still tore hippies apart wherever it went.\n\nOne thing that's very notable about this album is that you can see how much the band evolved musically in the mere 2 years that passed between the release of \"Rocka Rolla\" up to this one. Of course, the far better production on \"Sad Wings\" help in making it sound way better, but the band themselves are far superior songwriters by the time they wrote this album, that's quite easy to tell. The mood, time and tempo changes in \"Victim of Changes\" are done flawlessly, and the song flows perfectly through many varying segments and is one of Priest's greatest epic songs to date, standing above masterpieces such as \"Blood Red Skies\" and \"Run of the Mill\", and probably equal to \"Beyond The Realms of Death\". Another thing that's far better on this album than on the album that came before it, is the vocal delivery of Rob Halford. He's here developing that vicious attitude that we've grown to know him for, which is evident right from the original opening track \"Tyrant\" (Well, I think you all know the story by now. The LP originally opened with the piano intro \"Prelude\", but CD versions have gotten the order messed up and instead starts out with \"Victim of Changes\").\nHe also uses the falsetto alot more on this album, and overall he also brings some of his most emotional vocal performances on the entire album- just listen to \"Dreamer Deceiver\", and you'll know what I mean. That song also features one of Glenn Tipton's most beautiful guitar solos of all time.\n\nThe riffwork of Glenn and KK is also way improved. The chugging opening riffage of \"Genocide\" is fucking wicked, and heavy as shit for 1976. And just check out that motherfucker of an ending section! Then we have the absolutely sinister \"The Ripper\", which at times sounds more evil than the song \"Black Sabbath\", also thanks to the insane vocals. \"All hear my warning... Never turn your back on The Ripper!\" Hell yeah. Overall, there isn't a bad moment on this entire disc.\n\nThe oddball on any other Priest disc would be the slightly absurd entirely piano-driven ballad \"Epitaph\", with it's cheesy backing vocals and whatnot, but on here it totally works, surprisingly enough, thanks to the balladic nature of other songs on here like \"Victim of Changes\" and \"Dreamer Deceiver\". But \"Epitaph\" is still the only all-out ballad, as \"Victim\" has it's fair share of heaviness and kickass, and \"Dreamer Deceiver\" fades right into a second part of the song, entitled \"Deceiver\", which is heavier and features an absolutely mindblowing falsetto on the vocal delivery.\n\n\nIt's hard to describe the overall greatness of this, which in my opinion stands as Judas Priest's and heavy metal in general's second greatest album of all time. Perfect songwriting, musicianship, vocals, atmosphere, etc etc etc. The solos are classic Tipton/Downing material, which near always equals divine. The riffs are some of the heaviest seen around that time. The bluesy elements of \"Rocka Rolla\" is more laid-back for a mainly all-out Metal assault, yet keeping a steady, catchy groove in the songs, which of course just makes it rock even harder.\nThis is a pretty strange album, just like the debut, but give it some time and it'll grow on you. This is a fucking masterpiece, and absolutely essential, and the album that defined Heavy Fucking Metal in the 1970s. Forget all about \"Paranoid\", this is the shiznit.\n",
        "\nSo here we have it, the rather bizarre, heavily blues-influenced debut album of one of the original Heavy Metal bands, the originators of the spikes and leather wear of true Metal, and in mine and many others opinion the greatest band ever to walk the earth. Back here, they all looked like a bunch of hippies, Rob had long, curly hair, and the music was nowhere near the razor sharp all-out metal assault that Priest would turn into.\n\nThis album is very bluesy and is based on a number of groovy, catchy riffs and is supported by pretty damn solid and unpredictable drumming courtesy of John Hinch, and some of Ian Hill's most evident and well emphasized basswork throughout their career. On top of it, we have Rob Halford's vocals, who are still quite identifiable with the man who sang monster metal classics like \"Breaking The Law\" or \"The Sentinel\", but he sounds more laid-back and calm here, which suits the overall mood on the album, although he does perform some absolutely mindblowing falsetto even back here in 1974, most notably on the quite epic songs \"Dying To Meet You\" and \"Run of The Mill\".\n\nThe songwriting is rather consistent, and stays solid throughout most of the album, though tend to get really odd at times, and it makes you scratch your head in confusion every now and then. The \"Winter/Deep Freeze/Winter Retreat\" trilogy (actually, the song \"Cheater\" is 'part' of the trilogy, yet it has nothing to do with the other songs whatsoever and is a completely different track) is probably the most bizarre moment in Priest's entire history. \"Winter\" is a spacey, dark ballad-like song with a cool mood and some fucking excellent drum fills. It goes into \"Deep Freeze\", which consists entirely of K.K. Downing making some weird effects with his guitar, apparently trying to give the whole thing a certain mood. It sounds mostly psychotic and weird, but is actually kinda cool, though gets a little annoying after a while. Then we get to \"Winter Retreat\", which is an incredibly soft and very short ballad with a nice emotional touch in Rob's vocals and the guitarwork, and sounds strangely \"pretty\" for a Judas Priest song. It works, but it's mostly just weird, like the entire trilogy.\n\nThe rest... The album opens up with \"One For The Road\" and \"Rocka Rolla\", two classic rock n' roll numbers with a nice, bluesy feel. \"Rocka Rolla\" is actually pretty fucking excellent, with a perfect vicious mood and suiting lyrics, and is overall cool as hell. More of the same is \"Cheater\", which interestingly also features some great harmonica playing by Halford. This is probably the best of these three rockers, with the great main riff, wicked soloing, insanely catchy vocal lines and beautiful lyrics (\"I reached the dressing table, kicked away the door. I gripped the cold black metal, a loaded 44. By this time they're awake and they don't know what to do. I scream 'you cheatin bitch, here's what I think of you'!\". They may have looked like hippies, but looks can be deceiving, my friends. They were Metal as Steel already back in the 70s).\n\nBut the best stuff on here is the two epic masterpieces. We start with \"Run of the Mill\". It's long, slow, dark, and absolutely beautiful. I can't even try to explain the pure emotion displayed in this song, but if you don't feel like you're about to cry towards the end, you have no heart, you bitch. Rob Halford's vocal delivery in this song is nothing short of Godly, and it's quite understandable why he's recognized as The Metal God. He shows that in every moment of the song, but especially during the absolutely out of this world ending section, where he screams his heart out in an insane falsetto which is one of his best moments yet. \"I CAN'T GO OOOOOOOON!\" Man, that gets me every time.\n\nAnd after that, we have another ballad in the same vein, which is not quite as mesmerizing but practically flawless nonetheless, and goes into total asskicking mode on a speeded-up ending section which goes straight back into the groovy rocking of songs like \"Cheater\", but is sung entirely in a \"Stained Class\"-like falsetto. These two songs are some of the most underrated masterpieces in the band's history, and two of Metal's all-time greatest ballads. All in all, this album is very, very strange most of the time, but also pretty fucking great, though it takes time before it grows on you.\n",
        "\nOkay, there's no denying the power of Judas Priest, one of history's greatest metal acts. No other band (save arguably Sabbath, Maiden, and Metallica) can claim as rich and rewarding a catalogue over as long a period of time, and Judas Priest has a lot to do with metal's status today. Simply put, Priest melded Sabbath stomp with Purple's finesse along with something all their own and became the fathers of power, prog, speed, thrash, and so on (all while trying to be like Zeppelin and Queen).\n\nHowever, they are also tirelessly mining their own back catalogue for our hard-earned dollar, and while this collection has some of the greatest songs ever written, it is very much flawed. If you plan on shelling out this much cash, just go out and buy Sad Wings, Sin After Sin, Hell Bent for Leather, Defenders of the Faith, and Unleashed in the East. Then after absorbing the brilliance within, grab Stained Class, British Steel, Screaming for Vengeance, and Painkiller. You'll feel better.\n\nRather than go track by track, I'll go album by album.\n\nRocka Rolla\n\nONE friggin' track from Rocka Rolla?! I know Gull must be scalping them on this, but this was a solid, solid album and it deserves better. \"Never Satisfied\" is a bloody great track, but we could so have used \"Rocka Rolla\" and \"Cheater\" at the very least.\n\nSad Wings of Destiny\n\nWow, even worse. \"Victim of Changes\" and \"Tyrant\" are the best tracks on Sad Wings, and \"Deceiver\" is great too, but where's \"The Ripper\", \"Genocide\", \"Dreamer Deceiver\"... gah. Well, at least they went with the live version of \"Victim\" which is just spectacular.\n\nSin After Sin\n\nA healthy five tracks from this incredible record, although I prefer the studio cut of \"Diamonds and Rust\". Still, thank Slayer that they bothered to include \"Dissident Aggressor\" which is one of the pre-eminent metal songs ever, and circa 1977 this incinerated all of the bloated old hard rock outside of perhaps Scorpions. Also surprised they included \"Call For the Priest\", but I'm very glad. No \"Raw Deal\" though.\n\nStained Class\n\nAnother five tracks, although this is a bit iffy. \"Beyond the Realms of Death\" for sure, same with \"Exciter\" and \"Stained Class\", but I'd substitute \"Saints in Hell\" and \"Hero's End\" for \"Better By You, Better Than Me\" and \"Invader\". At least they didn't include \"Savage\", the worst cut on the album. Also, the live version of \"Exciter\" from Priest in the East is infinitely superior, as the studio cut is just painfully tame after 25 years of screeching metal insanity.\n\nHell Bent for Leather\n\nThe last album with Les Binks(A.K.A drumming god) is a doozy. I'm surprised it gets seven tracks, but I'll survive. The essentials are mostly here, but why did we need \"Take on the World\". It's barely a song, and they didn't even include \"Burnin' Up\"! I mean, what the hell? I'll forgive it that for including \"Delivering the Goods\", \"Killing Machine\", \"Evening Star\", and \"Hell Bent for Leather\"(how could they not?), but you know. Just nitpicking.\n\nBritish Steel\n\nA sorta blah album with the most blah drummer ever(man, Holland was crap), but it had it's good points, and the majority are here. I'm gleeful that they included \"The Rage\" and didn't include \"You Don't Have to Be Old to Be Wise\", easily the worst song they'd written by 1980. \"Grinder\" is good but bland, the two singles are quality tracks, and \"Rapid Fire\" is excellent proto-thrash. Oh, and \"Metal Gods\" is both hilarious and awesome.\n\nPoint of Entry\n\nBah. I don't like this one too much, and would rather have less focus on it. \"Headin' Out to the Highway\" and \"Solar Angels\" are acceptable, but \"Hot Rockin'\" is generic, \"Troubleshooter\" unremarkable, and \"Desert Plains\" simply too slack and dull to grab your attention. I think \"Don't Go\" was actually the first vid from this album, so I'm surprised it isn't here as it's not a bad song. Whatever, next.\n\nScreaming for Vengeance\n\nDefinitely a good Cliff's Notes for the uneven Screaming album. \"The Hellion/Electric Eye\" should so be the studio version, but that's the only complaint. Essentially, you get the good songs without having to listen to \"Pain and Pleasure\", \"Fever\", and \"Take These Chains\". \"Ridin' on the Wind\" and \"Screaming for Vengeance\" are just fucking great songs, and the other two don't lag behind.\n\nDefenders of the Faith\n\nI knew Tipton loved Defenders, but whoa! Eight tracks?! Well, it IS a great album. \"Love Bites\" is a definite studio project, so why include the live cut which can't hope to live up (to a mediocre song, anyway)? \"Eat My Alive\" sucks (ooh, punny), and I'd rather have had the \"Heavy Duty/ Defenders of the Faith\" combo instead. Great that they included \"Night Comes Down\" though, as it's one of their best ballads (even if it's not really a ballad). The other songs are all classics, but just go buy the album instead eh?\n\nTurbo\n\nUgggh. \"Turbo Lover\" is a nice slinky slowburner, but the rest of this is awful. They could at least have included \"Locked In\" and \"Rock You All Around the World\", which are better than the rest of this tripe. Skip.\n\nRam it Down\n\nSpiralling down, only \"Ram it Down\" and \"Blood Red Skies\" should be kept. THANK GOD they didn't include \"Johnny B. Goode\".\n\nPainkiller\n\nWow. Lose \"All Guns Blazing\" and this is perfect. Really, the best songs from another uneven outing, particularly the menacing \"Nightcrawler\", thrashtastic title track, and classic Priest style of \"Between the Hammer and the Anvil\".\n\nJugulator\n\nSurprise, two good tracks from the much maligned album. Still, \"Death Row\" should arguably be here.\n\nDemolition\n\nHow could you not put \"Hell is Home\"? It's the only track worth a shit on this POS!\n\nThe DVD RULES, but my anger that I have to shell out so much to buy it sours me to it. Why didn't they put this one on Electric Eye instead?\n\nStand-Outs: I couldn't be expected to choose really, but \"Victim of Changes (live)\", Dissident Aggressor, and \"Killing Machine\" are a few of my favs, so they'll do.\n",
        "\nPackaging: \n\nOutside: \nA spiked faux leather box, bearing the classic Priest logo and the Metalogy one witten with the same font. It looks good and feels good, leathery and heavy. The 216 spikes are not plastic, they are probably aluminum, but we can all pretend it\u2019s steel The box measures approx. 19cm x 19cm x 4cm. One should make sure there is no flaw in the positioning of the spikes or a dent in the box because such cases have been reported. The box opens as a box of chocolates would; one lifts and removes the lid, which is separate from the base. On the back of the box lies a useful leaflet with a small introductory text and the complete track list of the box set. Do not throw this way! The whole thing comes shrink-wrapped. A silver sticker on the shrink-wrap alerts of the contents. \n\nInside: \nThe characteristic beautiful scent of a newly opened release overcomes one once the box is opened. Talk about Pavlov\u2019s Dogs! It sadly is one of the few beautiful things about the inside of this box. As promising as the outside was, the totally black inside is a total disappointment. The back of the lid is decorated with a nice live picture of the band from side to side. The base of the box contains a cheap and thin plastic (think thick disposable water cups) case. This case has a cavity (with the priest symbol molded in its base), which firmly holds the 5 discs. The packaging of the five disks in the worst thing about this box set. It constitutes of simplistically decorated, \u201cnone more black\u201d carton cd pockets (like the ones giveaway cd\u2019s come in) that are cheap, ugly and most of all, make no mistake, very harmful to the disks. Last but not least, the 64 page paperback (should have been hardcover) book loaded with beautiful rare and never before seen photos is included (no lyrics though). The history is pretty much well known, and although naturally a bit biased, is more objective than I would expect (Turbo is characterized Pop Metal and a couple of songs on Demolition are contained in the same sentence with the words \u201cNu-Metal\u201d and \u201cIndustrial\u201d). Again, I was miffed to see that: \n-The intro piece is signed but Priest members minus Scott Travis, who has been a member of the band for close to15 years. The first reunion pictures where without him, now this. Priest probably want to concentrate on the old \u201cnucleus\u201d lineup, but they should not forget that they are and should act as a unit and a band at all times. Respect to the best drummer they ever had is due. \n-They don\u2019t even name Atkins or other initial members. \n-\u201cWithout Judas Priest Heavy Metal would be extinct\u201d. They are my 2nd all time favorite band, but this is an overstatement, to put it mildly. \n\nThe Audio: \nYou all now the track list. It is what it is, some interesting live cuts and a demo song scattered between studio tracks we all have, that have been polished up once again (yet another remaster is of minimal significance in my opinion, although some changes for the better are noticeable). The only thing I\u2019m miffed about is that Priest should have included more rarities, such as: \n\n-Mother Son (live) [never released] \n-Freewheel burning with complete intro guitar prelude [never released] \n-Turbo (High Octane Mix) \n-3 S/A/W session demos \n-What\u2019s My Name (Jap and Aus bonus track from Demolition, the only Owens credit) \n\nThe Audiovisual: \nOnce bitten, twice shy. After buying Electric Eye DVD, I was expecting to burry this release because of the DVD. I was expecting a poor (read none at all) remaster of audio and video, with a grainy VHS-like video and a 5.1 remaster that is basically a misleading title for stereo mix through five speakers. Thankfully I was wrong. The audio is true 5.1, with vocals and drums coming out of the center speaker, guitars separated between the two front speakers, ambience coming from surrounds and bass out of the subwoofer. The video is also pristine, minus some minor lighting/shadow problems, comparable with the BBC sessions problems on the Electric Eye DVD. Lovely! Stereo and 5.1 sound options, nice menu, discography menu, no subtitles, and no bonus stuff, which would have been a nice extra but are not terribly missed. \n\nOverall: \nBuy it, you will love it with all its flaws, after all, IT\u2019S PRIEST! Store the disks separately, in proper jewel cases, if you don\u2019t want to find out that they are damaged one day\u2026\n",
        "\nI keep hearing all these classic metal bands, especially Iron Maiden and Judas Priest, being praised, so when I saw this album for 2 dollars at a pawn shop, I decided to pick it up. Well, I'm not impressed. Sure, they have riffs and balls, but so do 189,398,123 bands out there. I suppose this album isn't the best example of a good Judas Priest album to buy, but I have a feeling that I wouldn't even like the mighty Painkiller. Maybe I will just have to train my brain to appreciate the 'classic' guitar sound and poor production, and I'm willing to do that, but I think it will be awhile, and I can't foresee any NWOBHM/classic metal bands such as Judas Priest gaining the same prestige in my metal collection as artists such as Devil Doll and Pain of Salvation do.\n\nThere's a single I remember hearing on the radio from this album all the time, Living After Midnight, but once again it is just kinda 'there' I don't find anything redeeming about it since it probably sounds very similar to a gazillion other songs I've already heard. Also, I'm tired of just hearing 'melodies'. I want to hear something that either has unnatural aggression or progression. I'm sure other people, such as Prog_ Power_ Adam, could empathize with me.Judas Priest, at least on this album, seem to have a \"We're gonna party til we drop\" attitude that I just don't find too appealing. I can see it right now....two fat unshaven rednecks drinking beer and listening to this album.\n\nI respect the fact that Judas Priest paved the way for many of today's metal bands, but is it totally off-color to suggest that many of the bands inspired by Judas Priest took what they heard from Priest and made it better? Think about it. That's what Metallica did with \"Turn the Page\". The original by Bob Seger was incredibly lame, but Metallica's cover livened it up a bit. Hetfield extended many of the notes in the song that Seger just deadpanned. I just find modern metal to be much more appealing to me than bands like Iron Maiden and Judas Priest. Chalk it up to my youthful age, but that would be faulty, since I know some people(at least one person) my age who love Judas Priest and Iron Maiden.\n",
        "\nThe material on this album was written at the same time as \"Turbo\", and was even supposed to be released with that album as a double album. You can hear alot of differences, although there's still some songs that could've easily been put on \"Turbo\" instead. But, this album hinted at a faster, more thrash-like style which was a prelude to the next album, \"Painkiller\". The title track is another faster-paced gem, although the bridge before the lead breaks is a little lame (the \"Shout It Out...\" part), luckily you forget it ever happened with the frantic alternating leads that follow. After this are 3 standard songs, the latter 2 (\"Love Zone\" and \"Come And Get It\") should've been released on \"Turbo\", as they hint at the glam-metal style again. Then the first side closes with another fast and heavy track called \"Hard As Iron\" (a straight-forward thrash song)... \n\nSide 2 opens with one the best JP songs ever, namely \"Blood Red Skies\". After an odd intro comes in with a very dark/depressive acoustic guitar riff with Rob Halford's gentle vocals, which gets progressively higher/louder until the intro ends. Then the song shifts to a stomping metal song, with Halford's wicked delivery during the verses (which are mostly only drums and vocals). The bridge then segues into the single best riff on the entire cd right before the lead break, which gives way to another pre-chorus and chorus. The song closes with some harrowing vocal delivery over some great guitar licks. But other than the following track \"I'm A Rocker\" (another \"anthem\" styled song), the rest of the album is average stuff, including a cover of \"Johnny B. Goode\" (a song originally made for a movie that ended up flopping, maybe they should've let \"Reckless\" be the \"Top Gun\" theme after all?!?). The closing song \"Monsters Of Rock\" is doom metal, super-slow and sludgy with perhaps the lowest-pitched vocals Halford ever did with the band. It's still not a very memorable song, though... \n\nOverall, this album can also be passed on as well (unless you're a die-hard), though I'd say that \"Blood Red Skies\" alone makes it worth getting... \n\n(Originally appeared on LARM, \u00a9 2002)\n",
        "\nLet's face it, with Halford back in Priest (where he fucking belongs), the Owens years can be forgotten now by us serious old school types. Tim Owens was competent, but he was no Halford. And it's not like he does THAT badly on this abum, but y'know...it just isn't the same. \n\nThe songs are excellent musically, with a somewhat more modern downtuned riffing style rearing its head, and Scott Travis pounding the hell out of his kit. The leads are still good as well, with Downing and Tipton still maintaining a more technical approach as they did on the classic \"Painkiller\", and you can even hear Ian Hill's growling, rumbling bass guitar underneath the riff onslaught, especially near the end of the title track where he lets out a great big roaring slide under the riff.\n\nI actually rather like the title track until Owens lets out one of his weak, sub-Halford wails, which is straight away--sorry, no go! You don't do that unless you can match or beat the maestro, and he just doesn't cut it for me. \"Blood Stained\" has a good catchy chorus and a strong headbanging groove, followed by \"Dead Meat\" with its brutish midtempo crunch. But \"Death Row\" really gets my head banging with its syncopated riffs before the verse starts and the chorus is the best on the record. \"Decapitate\"--ehh, not too bad, but could be better, but I do like the witty line in the middle (\"You've lost your head, sir! Well, you will tomorrow...sleep well!\"). \"Burn in Hell\"--awww, yeah! I think this song is about \"The Crow\", and I love it right away for that alone. Nice intro and some of the best vocals from Owens as he actually lets his own identity show are in the intro alone. \"Brain Dead\" and \"Abductors\"...again, ehh, could have been better. \"Bullet Train\" redeems the album with a fast, aggressive tune filled with manic leads and Owens letting out his most unhinged scream at the end as it builds to a crashing climax. Again, another rare moment of him showing his own style instead of his Halford impersonations. And \"Cathedral Spires\" is a nice ending, heavy and doomy with a very cool multitracked choir ending.\n\nIf you can get past Owens' lack of identity through most of the album--he also has a lot of unwelcome Seattle influence in his clean vocals moments--this is not such a bad album, really. If you could imagine this with Halford singing and better lyrics here and there, it would own! Can't wait for the new album and tour with one of the last few remaining True Metal Gods!!!!\n",
        "\nWell, I just got this a few weeks ago and I have probably listened to it 3 billion times by now. This, obviously, comes with good reason. \"Unleashed In the East\" is easily one of the best live albums ever recorded and also the best album Priest ever released, alongside with \"Painkiller\". Each of the songs burns with an energy that is unseen, or at least cramped in the original studio recordings. There are certain points of magic that make the live versions of these Priest classics better than their studio versions, my favourite being a bit into \"Exciter\" when the music stops and the crowd screams the \"repent if you please\" part along with Halford. Speaking of Halford, he sounds perfect, with his only audible vocal fuckup being at the beginning of \"The Ripper\". \n\n\"Victim of Changes\" is another great song, with some great riffs and a long, melodic midsection that eventually kicks back into the song in a great way. \"The Green Manashlini\" (or however you spell it) needs no introduction and remains, in my mind, the most typical heavy metal song ever, this is exemplified by the AC/DC styled riff in the verse. \"Diamonds and Rust\" was the song that originally turned me on to this album, the song is excellent but really hits it's climax at the end with Halford singing \"Diamonds...Diamonds and Rust!!!\". And of course, who can forget the classic \"Hell Bent for Leather\", which is done exceptionally well live and will be stuck in anybodys (and I mean ANYBODYS) head. Halford doesn't exactly do much in the way of talking to the crowd with the exception of the usual \"Thank you!\".\n\nNo, Thank YOU, Rob and the rest of the band for giving us one of the best heavy metal albums to grace the planet.\n\n\"Get down on your knees and repent if you please!\"\n\nA true classic, own this or die knowing that you are missing a landmark piece of metal history.\n",
        "\nI'm no Judas Priest fan. Not yet, anyway. That said, I bought this album a couple of weeks ago, knowing that it is considered one of Priest's best, and their definitive breakthrough. Judas Priest are often compared to Iron Maiden when it comes to \"vs.\"-threads and other things. I don't quite see why, as they have little in common. \"British Steel\" consists of simple and catchy metal songs, with some cheese thrown in for good measure. Opener 'Rapid Fire' is pretty much everything you could want from the first song on an album. It's fresh, catchy and to the point. Well, it WAS fresh back in 1980. Now it's just another good metal song. Song number two, 'Metal Gods' is also good, but not quite up there. It's definitely worth hearing, though. Then comes one of Priest's most well-known songs; 'Breaking the Law'. It's also the shortest song on the record, clocking in at only 2:35. As usual, everything is catchy, and it's easy to hear why it was chosen as a single. Personally I think it's better than the two tracks before.\n\n'Grinder' has a very cheesy chorus, but after repeated listens I can't help but like it. \"Grinder! Looking for meat!\" That's cheese if I ever saw it, haha. As with the rest of the songs, the riffs are very catchy. But then comes 'United'. This is one of the most obvious fillers I've ever heard. It has this brotherhood thing going on, and is hardly metal at all. And even while it stinks, I don't really mind listening to it. There's something strange with this album...'You Don't Have to be Old to be Wise' is quite the stupid song title, and I don't really care much for the song either. It's ok, but a bit anonymous compared to the other songs. Song 7 is named 'Living After Midnight'. This has got to be their most famous song, right? And it's kick-fucking-ass as well. The riff is supercatchy, same with the chorus, and the verse is so cheesy it's good. \n\n'The Rage' is next up. It's a good song, but not as good as most of the other songs found on \"British Steel\". The last song (excluding bonus tracks), is 'Steeler'. It's a great finisher. When the lyrics end, and the song just keeps on playing, that's my favourite part. That was the original tracklisting. But there are also two bonus tracks. The first is 'Red, White & Blue', a very patriotic song recorded in 1985 (I have no clue why it was included on an album from 1980, but whatever). The first time I heard it, I thought it sucked. But now I think it has this uplifting feeling to it. The other bonus track is a live version of 'Grinder', recorded during the \"British Steel\"-tour. It's pretty much as good as the studio version.\n\nHey, is this my shortest review yet, or what? I think so, hehe. \"British Steel\" is a good metal album. I find it to be a bit too simple, though, and it's not much here to get my head banging. The production is good enough (it's remastered, by the way), but doesn't exactly add power to the songs. Compared to Iron Maiden's (there they are again!) debut from 1980, this is pretty lightweight stuff. But I guess that's why it has sold so damn much. At least I'm glad I bought this album, and finding out what the big fuss is. Plus, my friend loves the album already. Good for him!\n",
        "\nIt's generally agreed that at some point in the early 80s, 1981 or so by most accounts, a faster, meaner, faster, uglier, faster, more technical, faster and definitely faster more form of metal popped up on the scene. It was called THRASH, and it began kicking ass, taking names, and in at least one case possibly designing a vast conspiracy to trick all the metal fans of the world into believing in them, at which point it would immediately sell out to pop culture, go to each fan's house, and personally stab them in the back with a rusty deboning knife. And that was all well and good. But what do you call something fast, mean, ugly, technical, and generally thrashy that somehow made its appearance before the 80s?\n\nYou call it Stained Class, of course.\n\nThis album is, simply put, one of Judas Priest's best releases, and thus one of metal's best releases. In fact, if not for the mediocre cement block of a song that is \"Invader,\" this album would kick Painkiller's ass square. The only real over-arching flaw on this is the production - it sounds like it was produced in 1978, which is probably because it was produced in 1978. Aside from the wimpy tone, this is just a complete ass-kicker of an album - the guitars are fast and ripping, the vocals are Halford in his window-shattering prime, the bass is faster than Ian Hill would play for the next 12 years and heavy to boot, and the drums are Priest's peak up until the human drum machine Scott Travis would take over.\n\nSong-wise, you've got several of the finer examples of music designed to piss people off and yet make them want to listen to it at the same time. The best two examples of that are \"Saints In Hell\" and the title track, which thrash harder than most of the 80s, never mind the 70s. \"Stained Class\" rips your intestines out with a gallop, \"Saints In Hell\" uses an energized version of the old riff from \"Cheater,\" but they both accomplish the same thing\u2013UTTER DESTRUCTION. Of special note are the middle section riffs in both. \"Saints\" begins to thrash madly at 3:13; the drums are dynamic and good, and Rob bursts into Complete Unholy Fucking Evil and eats your soul with mustard and onions, but those are overshadowed by the riff of thrash metal pain that is one of the highlights of Judas Priest's whole catalog, and thus all of heavy metal. Meanwhile, \"Stained\" waits till 3:15 to unleash the HEAVIEST thing in metal at the time. I am not kidding. This riff is the Big Red Hand of Satan popping out of the ground and crushing metropolitan Detroit because some poor fool cranked it a bit too loud. You will obey the power of this riff, or you shall be executed for poseury. \n\nEither one of those two songs would easily be the total highlight of most metal albums....but this is Stained Class, and something more is needed. Thus, the ballad and complete masterpiece of the album, \"Beyond the Realms of Death.\" The guitar riffs (both clean and distorted) are great, and the arrangement is impeccable, but there are two real reasons that this song owns your soul. One of them is Rob Halford's mournful, vicious, philosophical, and generally really, really good vocal performance; the other is Glenn Tipton's solo of complete and utter awesomeness. They are the best performances in Judas Priest by those two guys. Case closed. Kneel and worship.\n\nGetting the point? How about \"Exciter\"? This is \"Painkiller\" beta version, and while it does not quite possess the sheer \"rock out or die\" killingness of said speed metal masterpiece, it is quite awesome of its own right. The lyrics make no sense, of course, but considering that everything else on here is more or less coherent, I'd say that's a remarkable victory for the oft-unintelligible Priest. Truly rocking. You want more? Try \"Heroes End,\" with a riff very nearly as abusive as the title track alternating throughout the bridge (first appearance, 2:14) with chilling vocals. Or maybe the pounding \"Savage,\" with its wide-ranging chorus singing and intricate guitar work. The opening shrieks are also notable, not only because they utterly rule, but because this is one of the first instances of a metal song opening with a spine-chilling scream. That'll happen a lot in the next few decades and counting.\n\nThere's also \"White Heat, Red Hot,\" a damn good rocker with a nice epic-sounding bridge, and \"Better By You, Better Than Me,\" the infamous Suicide Song. I have never heard the original, so I don't know if they did it justice and don't particularly care; a very nice riff over a grooving drum line with a couple great-sounding vocal lines right before the chorus (\"You hear the teaching of the wind...\") \"Invader\" I shall forever hate for bringing this album down, but it's listenable, and the bridge at 1:55 is pretty good.\n\nSo there you have it. An album that kicked everything else square in the ass in the seventies, and can do a fair job of the same now. Buy this, crank the stereo, and keep your eyes on the floor for the Big Red Hand of Satan, because if anything's gonna remind him that heavy metal didn't have to start talking shop with punk to start rocking with homicidal intensity, this album is it.\n",
        "\nThe follow-up to Jugulator and the second studio album with Tim 'Ripper' Owens is not at all as bad as people will make you believe. Most people tend to call it mallcore, but that is incredibly wrong. There are no silly melodic, clean sung passages or choruses, the riffs are too interesting and innovative, there is no random unmelodic screaming and there are no \"I-will-slit-my-wrists-because-my-life-sucks-boo-fucking-hoo\" lyrics. So those who scream \"mallcore\" as soon their favourite band takes a new direction (Hi FatalStrike), you are allowed to piss off. One of the biggest trademarks of Judas Priest has been the significant style changes between every single album, and they have yet to disappoint me.\n\nSo, despite all the silly keyboard effects abound, this is anything but mallcore. The sound is in fact closer to classic Priest than Jugulator, in that it's not very thrashy and brutal, although this has it's crushingly heavy moments. There are also more melodic ideas found here, which is another thing that marked the classic Priest. The song constructions also go back to fairly simple patterns, and there are not as many different vocal lines as you would find on Jugulator, which is generally a good thing, as it brings a better sense of focus to the songs. And the production is also somewhat better than the dry sound of Jugulator, and also adds a much higher bass, although the aforementioned keyboard effects can get really annoying at times.\n\nAnother notable change with this album is Ripper's vocals. He sings in a dark, semi-growled midranged voice pretty much all the time. And while he does it very well, and while it does fit with the aggressiveness that still abound on the album, a few of the demonic falsetto shrieks that you could find on Jugulator would only do good. Another thing this album lacks, which also was absent on Jugulator, is good soloing. They just don't make sense.\n\nWhile the general sound and style change from Jugulator has been for the better, the songwriting department in itself is slightly inconsistent. There are a bunch of weaker songs that brings the album down from it's full potential, namely Devil Digger, In Between, Lost and Found and Cyberface. Devil Digger is a pretty decent midpaced number with quite groovy, dark vocal lines, but it never really gets anywhere, and the pointless \"I don't want to fade away\" ranting does little to me. In Between goes through a number of time changes yet still manages to sound the same all the time and never seems to get anywhere. That's quite an accomplishment. Lost and Found is just a below average acoustic ballad. Cyberface is definitely the best of these four, though nonetheless quite weak. The lyrics are hideously cheesy yet pretty funny, and the vocal lines on the chorus are incredibly lifeless and sound somewhat robotic. What brings this song above the others is the crushingly heavy midpaced headbanger of a main riff.\n\nThe rest is all pretty solid. The opening track Machine Man is the ultimate highlight- really fucking heavy speed metal, with insanely catchy and memorable vocal lines, a damn fine underlying double bass attack and a powerful shout-along chorus. Other highlights are Hell Is Home with it's very groovy vocal lines and the dark, moody intro, the beautiful ballad Close To You, the fast paced Bloodsuckers which has some well-needed high-pitched vocals on the chorus, the aggressive Feed On Me, the groovy Subterfuge with another catchy shout-along chorus, and Metal Messiah, with rather silly almost-spoken verses but that mindblowing chorus exploding out of nowhere. \"HE'S THE MAN! ARMAGEDDON! WALKING THROUGH FIRE! METAL MESSIAH!\" Quite possibly one of the greatest choruses ever.\n\nThe songs not mentioned are all rather average, and rank somewhere in the middle. In the end, Demolition is definitely a step in the right direction for Priest, even though it's somewhat inconsistent. But they badly need to get the solos right.\n\nOh, almost forgot: I guess I have to say something about What's My Name, the only song so far co-written by Ripper. It's a quite decent, midpaced song with a rather groovy and electronic-sounding intro riff leading into the decently heavy under-vers riff. The vocal tone on the song, I must admit, do mildly resemble to Fred Durst of Limp Bizkit, only Ripper somehow makes it sound decent. In conclusion, it's a pretty decent song, although I wouldn't recommend that you follow my example and rebuy a special edition of Demolition for 25 bucks just to get this song...\n",
        "\nA lot of live albums suffer from the stigma of being pretty much the same thing as their studio predecessors, just sloppier and released with the profit margin in mind (*coughMaidencough*). This, however, is not one of those albums - it is fully worth the $20 or whatever you have to pay. '98 Live Meltdown is nothing less than a complete and total reinvention of all but six songs on the two discs, and brutal reinditions of those six.\n\nYou all know the story of Tim \"Ripper\" Owens, so I'm not going to bore you with any of that crap...instead, I will simply talk about how utterly badass this live album is, most notably Owens's vocals. He's not Rob Halford, but neither is he a Halford imitator. This album shows it, with the production putting the singing far in the front while still keeping the other instruments, as well as the crowd, distinct.\n\nAs said, Judas Priest takes a catalog of (at that point) twenty-three years worth of music and gives it a good, swift kick in the ass. Everything is tuned down, turned up, and injected with a heavy dose of amphetamines - it's the grand heavy metal traditional of \"kicking your ass till you like it.\" Disc One is probably the better of the two; \"Rapid Fire,\" long suspected as possibly the first thrash metal song, is turned into a skin-shredder worthy of Exodus (except with better vocals) here. Ripper's version of \"Touch of Evil\" completely lays waste to his predecessor's, as does \"The Ripper.\" The cut-down \"Death Row\" kicks the shit out of the mediocre album version, and \"Bullet Train\" translates one of the best Owens tracks to an even more effective live setting. And as for \"The Sentinel\", that song just rules you and you know it.\n\nThe second disc also has its moments; \"Night Crawler\" is an absolute beast, with Ripper throwing in primal screams and growls until that song rips and tears the way it should have in 1990. \"Victim of Changes\" really highlights his vocal abilities, and \"Painkiller,\" while not quite vocally matching the original, is even heavier musically. That brings up the oft-forgotten superstar of the disc, drummer Scott Travis. Travis keeps up a solid beat throughout while tossing off high-speed and highly difficult drum parts like \"Bullet Train\" and \"Painkiller\" with ease; judging on his work on the songs where Downing and Tipton let him really cut loose, I'd put this guy in the Drumming Gods Social Club with Lombardo, Hoglan, Christy et. al.\n\nSo no, this album is not the Judas Priest of old - it's something different. Something heavier, harder, faster, and in some ways better. With the return of Rob Halford, Meltdown remains as a milestone in Priest's history, when they were fresh, rejuvenated, and ready to show the world that nobody was getting old in this camp. Before Glenn Tipton's bad ideas took over and Ripper got disillusioned (resulting in the poor Demolition and the uninspired Live In London), they recorded this, and it brought the heaviness.\n\nThis is one of the greatest live albums ever. Buy it and rejoice.\n",
        "\nPriest's second album with Owens proved to definitely be a lot stronger than \"Jugulator\" - taking back a bit of the usual trademarks in the form of a lot of melody and decent solo's coupled with a bit of experimentation.\n\nWhile there still are a few weaker tracks (\"Cyberface\" & \"Jekyll And Hide\") it appears that the average quality of the songs is a lot higher than the ones to be found on \"Jugulator\". One problem though which also plagued that previous album is the production - instead of sounding dry and boring, Glenn opted for a spacey nu-metal sound for part of the tracks this time - having silly and crap effects and sounds inbetween what are basically quite decent songs - definitely something that Priest DOESN'T need to be succesfull...\n\nIt also seems that Ripper has even grown a little bit more in his role as singer / frontman and shows off an entirely new side of his voice - instead of constantly seeking higher registers - there's a lot of very powerfull midrange singing to be found on here - which fits him very well (although the odd shriek wouldn't have been bad either mind you)...\n\nBest songs on here are the most \"experimental\" ones - \"Hell Is Home\" (sounding a bit like \"Turbo Lover\", but darker and doomier), \"Subterfuge\" (White Zombie like ? ) and Metal Messiah (which features a classic metal chorus, yet almost rap-like inbetween melody lines). Furthermore there also is a lot of enjoyment to be had from \"One On One\", \"Machine Man\" (sounding Painkiller-esque) and \"Bloodsuckers\".\n\nSadly enough this is a very underrated and overlooked album - and it's certainly a fair deal stronger than \"Jugulator\", \"Rock A Rolla\" or \"Point Of Entry\"...\n",
        "\nAfter years of silence Priest finally returns to the metal scene with a new album - and it turns out to be more or less a slight dissapointment...\n\nLet's start with summing up the bad points really quickly - first of all you got the production - which is a bit too weak & dry most of the time - then there is the rather lame cover artwork (sure, that is forgettable still - after all you buy an album for the music, not the artwork..but still...) - but most importantly, there seems to be a definite lack of good songwriting on here, both musically as well as in the lyrics - songs like \"Braindead\", \"Decapitate\" etc should never have made it unto an album at all - then there is the \"musical direction\" - for some reason Priest decided to ditch all of the usual \"Priest trademarks\" (melodic leads - melodic soloing) in favour of a Pantera riff based style flavoured with Slayer-esque solo's, something which the band doesn't quite succeed at. \n\nHowever, there still is quite a lot of good to be found as well - most importantly in the new frontman Tim Owens - who shows just how classy he is - not only a fitting replacement for Halford - but actually (especially these days) surpassing him when it comes to power. And of course there is the joy that finally Priest managed to get their carreer going - couple this with 2 superb songs (\"Cathedral Spires\" and \"Bullet Train\") and a handfull of decent - good ones (\"Burn In Hell\" & \"Jugulator\") and you basically have an album that, while perhaps not the best in their carreer - is still above average and a nice sign of life for this great band...\n",
        "\nBritish Steel is where Judas Priest started to move towards a more commercial rock sound, the one that was hinted on, well, maybe more than hinted, on Hell Bent For Leather. There are still some pure Heavy Metal tracks on here, but this release also has its fair share of rock-oriented tracks, but unlike on Hell Bent For Leather, in my opinion, Judas Priest were successful this time. \n\nSo as mentioned this CD can easily be broken down into two sections. One section contains the Metal tracks: \u201cRapid Fire\u201d, \u201cGrinder\u201d, \u201cMetal Gods\u201d, and \u201cSteeler\u201d. All of these songs are very good. Both \u201cRapid Fire\u201d and the lesser-known \u201cSteeler\u201d have some classic riffs that as Boris mentioned, had to influence a lot of bands. Hell, some, such as Gamma Ray, have even chosen to completely rip-off \u201cRapid Fire\u201d. \u201cGrinder\u201d is another excellent mid-paced, riff heavy track, however, \u201cMetal Gods\u201d isn\u2019t perfect. I really like everything about the song except the chorus, which just sounds annoying. It does sound a lot better live though. When I went to see Priest on their latest tour, I was subjected to 45 minutes of the opening band, who played extremely cheesy Pop Punk. After the heinous torture that was the opening band, and of course the obligatory sound check, The Priest came out driving home some pure Heavy Metal with \u201cMetal Gods\u201d\u2026 so the point is \u201cMetal Gods\u201d seemed about hundred times better at the moment than it actually was, but I digress. The Hard Rock songs are a mixed bag influence wise. I liked all of them, but \u201cBreaking The Law\u201d and \u201cLiving After Midnight\u201d are especially catchy, but very simple rock songs. I know they aren\u2019t everyone\u2019s cup of tea, but these are classic songs, even if they aren\u2019t typical \u201cJudas Priest Metal\u201d. \u201cThe Rage\u201d is kind of interesting; the intro sounds like a Reggae song, which thankfully doesn\u2019t last very long. What makes \u201cThe Rage\u201d so good though is the vocals. Halford really shines on this song with excellent phrasing and emotion. \u201cUnited\u201d is sort of like \u201cMetal Gods\u201d in my books: solid verse with a shitty chorus. I do like the vocal melodies in the chorus of \u201cUnited\u201d but that Queen sounding percussion is very poorly used and it almost ruins the song for me. \u201cYou Don\u2019t Have To Be Old To Be Wise\u201d sounds a lot like early Van Halen, in fact, the first time I heard the song I thought I\u2019d somehow put Van Halen\u2019s self-titled release into my CD player by accident. Regardless of its somewhat unoriginal nature, it\u2019s still a decent song but nothing great.\n\nThe guitar work is more simple on British Steel, but catchy as always, and the leads in some songs are classic Priest. Dave Holland, the new drummer, gives us some quality moments, mostly with his fills, although he seems to lack the immediacy of Les Binks. Ian Hill is also given a chance to shine on some songs, and while it is limited to short-lived breaks or intros, it is better than nothing I suppose. British Steel is also where more obvious gay references in the lyrics come out. You got to love the following line from \u201cLiving After Midnight\u201d: \u201cI\u2019m getting harder by the hour\u201d. Hmmm\u2026 it could be worse though, Halford could be singing \u201cLocked And Loaded\u201d. \n\nThe remaster contains the bonus track \u201cRed, White, and Blue\u201d which is an anthem based ballad concerning the bands patriotic nature to UK. This bonus track is utterly forgettable and may only appeal to you if you call the UK your home. However, the live version of \u201cGrinder\u201d is very well done, sounding heavier than it does in the studio. \n\nIf you\u2019re opposed to Hard Rock and more simple, catchy guitar songs, then British Steel will only appeal to you with a couple of tracks. But if you\u2019re like me and enjoy both sides of the Priest spectrum, played well mind you, then I suggest you add British Steel to your collection.\n\nSong Highlights: Rapid Fire, Breaking The Law, Grinder, Living After Midnight, The Rage, Steeler.\n",
        "\nPainkiller was a very interesting release for Judas Priest for a number of reasons. The most apparent reason, in my opinion, is for many years, Judas Priest had been laying the groundwork for Speed and Power Metal. They never really went full out, but most bands took their basic sound, and then sped it up to create Speed and early Power Metal. Many of these bands flourished in the 80\u2019s and early 90\u2019s and it took the band that influenced them all to show them how it\u2019s done. After showing hints of their more aggressive sound-to-be on Ram It Down, Judas Priest really went all out on Painkiller, which was very aggressive and powerful, yet still very Priest. \n\nThe CD opens up with the classic drum intro of the title track, which is one of the best opening tracks ever. Right away you see where Judas Priest is going with their sound. Rob Halford uses his screaming falsetto all the way through and it works very well! The leads are amazing, and the riffs are killer, but The Priest Machine doesn\u2019t let up there though; they continue their onslaught with \u201cHell Patrol\u201d, \u201cAll Guns Blazing\u201d, and my personal favorite song from the CD, \u201cLeather Rebel\u201d. Everything in these songs is just amazing, almost beyond words or classification, because it really is the epitome of good traditional Metal played fast and with energy! It\u2019s almost a bizarro world situation when you think of \u201cTurbo Lover\u201d (with its mid-paced, pop-synth heavy melodic textures), and then \u201cMetal Meltdown\u201d (with it\u2019s crushing and fast riffs, and dark atmosphere) for example- because they\u2019re just that much different in feel. It\u2019s almost as if Priest said, \u201cOk, all these bands are playing Metal that we started, lets show them who the masters are\u201d and that\u2019s exactly what Judas Priest did with Painkiller. As already mentioned, many bands have come close since the release of Painkiller, but nothing has surpassed Painkiller yet in my opinion. And for the record I also see nothing wrong with \u201cTouch Of Evil\u201d. It has a great atmosphere, vocals, and a terrific break near the end of the song where Halford delivers his most shriekingly perfect scream on the CD with the line, \u201cYou\u2019re Possessing Me!\u201d \n\nThe weakest song on here is \u201cBetween The Hammer And The Anvil\u201d, but hey, it\u2019s still a great song. Just having a song of this quality being overshadowed by the rest of the CD really depicts just how good the actual release is. Every chorus is catchy (my favorite being on \u201cOne Shot At Glory\u201d), every lead is solid, every riff is unique, and Scott Travis is a monster behind the kit. \n\nSo if you\u2019re into Speed Metal or 80\u2019s Power Metal, definitely pick this up because this is the CD that everyone from Primal Fear, to Iron Savior, to Silent Force are trying to surpass.\n\nSong Highlights: Everything, but Painkiller, Leather Rebel, Metal Meltdown, and Nightcrawler are my favorite.\n",
        "\nIn the late 70's I'm sure all the Metal fans were interested to hear what Judas Priest had up their sleeve after the amazing Stained Class, I know I would have been. Released as Hell Bent For Leather in North America, Killing Machine proved that Judas Priest were not going to go away after a couple of solid releases. Killing Machine was largely a release full of varied musical influences and styles that fully experimented with the current (at the time) forms of Rock and Metal music.\n\nThe blues and hard rock side of Judas Priest show up a lot more on Killing Machine than it did on Stained Class. Both \"Rock Forever\" and \"Evil Fantasies\" are almost more Hard Rock than metal, as is the arena rock, very Queen sounding \"Take On The World\". This isn't really a bad thing though, \"Rock Forever\" does have it's moments, including some nice double bass, but overall it's one of the weaker songs on Killing Machine; on the other hand, \"Evil Fantasies\" is a very underrated Judas Priest song that I find myself liking a lot (I see Danzig being very influenced by this track). The more straight classic Metal tracks of course populate Killing Machine with killer riffs, leads, and melodies... although each of the more straight forward Metal songs still have a slight blues tinge as well as early Speed Metal tendencies. Songs like \"Hell Bent For Leather\", \"Killing Machine\", \"Riding On The Wind\", \"Burnin' Up\", and \"Delivering The Goods\" are Judas Priest classics; \"Killing Machine\" in particular being very underrated. Much like Stained Class, Killing Machine features an amazing cover- this time it's a cover of Fleetwood Mac's \"The Green Manalishi (With The Two Pronged Crown)\" that to this day remains a fan favorite. In the form of \"Evening Star\" and \"Beyond The Dawn\" we hear Judas Priest experimenting with softer sounds, with \"Beyond The Dawn\" being a full-on ballad. The ballad is successful, while \"Evening Star\" is a weak track in my opinion.\n\nHalford's vocals are further refined on Killing Machine as we hear a lot of different styles; every song is a highlight from that perspective. Everyone else turns out a quality performance, with Les Binks once again laying the groundwork for Speed and Thrash with his drumming. The lyrics are typical Heavy Metal/Hard Rock fair and are a step down from Stained Class. \n\nThe remaster contains an excellent song entitled \"Fight For Your Life\"; how this song did not make it on an actual release is beyond me- it's really good. The live song is the classic \"Riding On The Wind\". The sound is decent with only slightly awkward sounding vocals (more due to the sound system I think). Overall, Killing Machine has a lot of great Judas Priest classics and is also home to many underrated songs, however, \"Rock Forever\", \"Take On The World\", and \"Evening Star\" are a step down from the rest of their material. At times Killing Machine is more commercial sounding than Stained Class, but the quality of the songs is still high so I'm recommending this to anyone with an interest in classic Metal even though there is dip in quality when compared to Stained Class with certain songs.\n",
        "\nMost of you are probably familiar with Stained Class. In case you aren't though, Stained Class is largely regarded as one of the best Metal albums ever released. While most of us can argue that all night long, the fact still remains that Stained Class was WAY ahead of its time and it influenced a ton of Metal bands. The first track on Stained Class was \"Exciter\". Featuring close to nonstop double bass (practically unheard of during that time) and fast riffing, this song helped to form the basis for the genres of Speed Metal and early Power Metal. Everyone from Primal Fear to Silent Force to Helloween took inspiration from this song in a big way I\u2019m sure. \n\nThe rest of the CD is full of great riffs, and despite being released in '78, the basic heaviness of the riffs still stand up in a big way to today's Metal. Halford's vocals aren't quite as refined as they would be on later releases, but they are still great and he shows us his many different styles- the best being his now famous screams. Lately, Judas Priest lyrics aren't the bands strong point, but on Stained Class they were very good. With topics ranging from aliens on \"Invaders\" and references to Hell on \"Saints In Hell\", the CD is very varied lyrically, as well as musically. Some songs take on a more bluesy approach like \"White Heat, Red Hot\" while others take on a more progressive and complex song structure approach such as on the classic, \"Beyond The Realms Of Death\". Whatever the approach Judas Priest take to the song writing on Stained Class, the result is the same: classic heavy metal with memorable riffs, amazing leads, great vocals, and an overall satisfying listening experience. There are no bad or boring moments at all. Every song is classic, even the lesser known \"Heroes End\" and the cover of \"Better By You, Better Than Me\". The title track also has some of my favorite lead work, not really from a technical stand point, but just how it fits so perfectly with the song; especially the harmonization lead section. Downing and Tipton were close to their best on here with these riffs/leads. Stained Class just simply contains amazing guitar work.\n\nOn the remaster of Stained Class the sound has been very much improved. It does not detract from the classic feel of Judas Priest though, you just won't have to turn up your speakers all the way to hear every thing. The bonus track \"Fire Down Below\" is an unfinished song that still has its original drum machine track on it. The actual song, minus the drum track, isn't bad. The vocals are really good and the acoustic guitar parts are a highlight; I would have been interested in hearing a completed version of this track. The live version of \"Better By You, Better Than Me\" isn't one of Halford's better live performances but it's still nice to hear the song live. If you're new to Stained Class, definitely go for the remaster, the sound quality on the original detracts a lot.\n",
        "\nHow does one review a live album? No use explaining the music since the songs (in most cases anyhow) are available on other albums. So I'm gonna do a little personal history instead, whether you like it or not.\n(I will get back on the album after this, don't worry)\n\nThe thing is, Judas Priest is one of my absolute favorite metal bands, even if I don't mention it much I keep them very close to my heart. Just the other day I figured out why this particular band has that place, it's simply because they were one of the first metal acts I encountered. The reason I began to listen to them is a combination of a class mate of mine in seventh grade (we're still good friends) and my sister. I knew the guy listened to alot of metal and I guess I wanted to know what it was like. Anyway I saw the name Judas Priest among many others on one of his notebooks and I knew my oldest sis had some vinyls with them (she still has actually) so I thought I'd check em out.\n\nAnd I'm glad I did cause otherwise I wouldn't listen to this album today. It's kinda funny though (or just weird) how time can affect your taste. I started out with 'Killing machine' and 'British steel' (and I still like those of course). I never really gave 'Sin after sin' or even 'Sad wings of destiny' their fair chance at first, but since I liked 'Killing machine' I eventually tried this live album and thought it was ok but nothing more. Maybe it was because it mainly contains songs off those albums I didn't listen to much or at all back in those days (this was approximately 8 years ago), I dunno.\n\nHowever the fact is that today I totally worship this album as being the best live album ever, all categories. Not even Sabbath's \"Live evil\" is this perfect. The production is really fine for being 70's, you can even hear Ian Hill's bass tones.\n\nI think the main reasons you can listen to this album longer than a month before you get tired of it (yeah good luck with that one.. I'm not, even after 6 years or something) is:\n\n1. Even though it has brilliant tracklisting - none of the tracks are real \"metal classics\".. you know, songs that are constantly played in every metal fan's stereo until pure sickness, i.e. Iron Maiden - \"Number of the beast\" or \"Run to the hills\".. get the idea? Of course there are songs that can be considered classics here, but not as much as mentioned metal-hits anyway.\n\n2. It's not just a cheap trick by the record label to get the band out of their contract and milk the fans on their hard-earned money, lots of feeling is put in here (production by Tom Allom, their main producer during the 80's - just a thing like that) and the band has never been better - Halford is in absolute top-shape, this is a great opportunity to hear why I hold this man as my favorite singer of all time.\n\nMake sure you get the remaster-version though, cause it has 4 bonus tracks (10-13), the best you can get - they're the bonuses from the japanese version of the album and recorded at the same tour, I bought it recently and actually I've been waiting to get my hands on a version with those extra tracks.. ever since I bought the original version many years ago! So this remaster really was a blessing..\n",
        "\nThis is one of Priest's most consistent albums - along with Stained Class and Painkiller, there is really nothing bad to be found here. It also has some very nice atmosphere, and definitely good guitar work. However, the production is merely okay, as is the case on most of Priest's 70s work - the guitar isn't loud enough and kinda lacks punch (see: Priest in the East for how to achieve punch, and have the definitive versions of these songs, yade yade yada.) But hey, for 1976, this is fucking godly... for historical importance, you can't beat this one, and even today the songs sound like heavy fucking metal, bordering on thrash at times. This is one that won't get mistaken for classic rock.\n\nThere really isn't a bad song here. Even the two little interludes \"Prelude\" and \"Epitaph\" are very nice. Well, Epitaph is a full song, but it's a little piano number, but it serves as a perfect intro to Island of Domination.\n\nThe very good: \"Victim of Changes\", we all know ths one. \"Island of Domination\" - sort of a speedish number that turns midpaced in the middle. These two are actually the weakest tracks on here in my opinion, though they are quite excellent.\n\nThe awesome: \"The Ripper\", \"Tyrant\", \"Genocide\" - three classics of heavy metal. Tyrant was highly influential, especially with the almost random thrash break (that's right!) thrown in around the end, followed by the brilliant solo. Genocide bursts in with a dose of power out of nowhere - \"slice to the left, slice to the right\" - that part is just fucking vicious. And who can forget that classic intro lick on The Ripper, that solid speed metal intro riff, and that shriek? This is where Evil Has no Boundaries got its inspiration, you can totally tell.\n\nThe absolutely fucking mind-blowingly stupendously incredible: \"Dreamer Deceiver\"/\"Deceiver\" - won't SOMEONE (either Priest or Halford) play this one live?? I know both Halford and Owens could nail the high notes in here, and it would be a spectacular vocal performance (a certain live 1975 version has even higher notes in 2 places at the end of \"Deceiver\"!) This song (two songs, whatever, they go together) is (are) totally and completely awesome and can do no wrong. Even the production can be overlooked, because there is nothing to compare it to. DoH! \n\nOverall, this is one of the Must Have albums by Judas Priest - if you have any sense of history, you'll pick this one up on vinyl. And if you get it on CD, beware of the fucked up tracklisting. I've got it ripped to mp3s and I've got Victim of Changes as track 6... the album goes a lot better like that, with the guitar harmony intro to begin side B, and the classic power-metal track of an intro piece (Helloween, anyone) to start the entire fucking thing. Classic shit, when all is said and done... no, it's not quite as good as the later live versions, but still it is indispensable.\n",
        "\nThis album is no Stained Class - the songs are far simpler, and not nearly as consistent. Also, since it's a studio album from before 1979, I must mention that any song found here and on Priest in the East will sound far better there.\n\nAnd there are a lot of songs on here that are on there too: six in fact - \"Delivering the Goods\", \"Rock Forever\", \"Hell Bent for Leather\", \"Green Manalishi\", \"Running Wild\", and \"Evil Fantasies\".\n\nOn here, Hell Bent for Leather totally rules, as it always does - that little solo in the middle is completely godly. Green Manalishi and Rock Forever are far more fun with the crowd singing along. Delivering the Goods and Running Wild are nice here too. Evil Fantasies is pretty mediocre in the studio, it's about 100x as good live.\n\nAs for the songs here but not there: Evening Star is a fun little ballad with a nice sweeping chorus. Burnin' Up is pretty average midpaced Priest with silly lyrics. Take on the World is \"We Will Rock You\" except not by Queen, and I have always found it horrible. Killing Machine is midpaced Priest and generally well executed and catchy, and Before the Dawn is kinda forgettable. \n\nOverall, it's one of their weaker albums, though it does have its definite highlights. \"Hell Bent for Leather\" - it really doesn't get much better than this as far as speed metal is concerned, it's a definite canonical example of how to play fast, furious, and right to the point. \"Delivering the Goods\" is probably the other great song, and \"Running Wild\" is pretty nifty too - must be to have given the name to such a great speed metal band!\n",
        "\nYes, all the silly effects and slightly electronic sound remind me of Turbo. But, if Turbo were this good, it would not suck nearly as badly (yeah that was a bit obvious!) What I'm saying is, this is a good album. It's actually one of Priest's most consistent - though at the price of having no outrageously amazing songs like \"Ram it Down\" for instance. At least there are no complete vomit-inducing feces-piles like \"Abductors\". It's just pretty nice from beginning to end.\n\nHighlights include \"Machine Man\", which is a great opener. \"One on One\" is totally good midpaced headbanging material in the vein of \"Some Heads Are Gonna Roll\". \n\n\"Close to You\" is actually the best ballad they've done since \"Beyond the Realms of Death\". It's that good - better than \"Out in the Cold\" or \"Touch of Evil\", both great songs in their own right. \"Subterfuge\" is also a winner - it's catchy as fuck, and those that call it mallcore have obviously not had their ears grated mercilessly by Korn enough times.\n\nSome of the weaker tracks are \"Devil Digger\", \"Lost and Found\", and \"Cyberface\" - all of them just kinda boring. \"In Between\" is merely okay too, so is \"Metal Messiah\", whose verses are not rapping, they're just not sung either, but the chorus is great. Priest has always had nice singalong choruses, and this album continues that tradition.\n\nYes, it's good. The cover art blows, but the music is quite decent - again, no real overwhelming highlights, though. So it's merely good, and not great.\n",
        "\nThis album is half Painkiller, and half absolute crap. Some of the songs on here are total speed metal classics, and others are unlistenable drivel. \n\nFirst off, the whole vocalist situation. Is Tim Owens (I refuse to call him Ripper, if his mother didn't name him Ripper, why should I?) any good? Oh, Hell yeah, he is definitely great. He nails all sorts of unholy screams, and his singing voice is very good as well (see: \"Cathedral Spires\")\n\nThat said, the songs on the album album do really go into three categories: awesome speed metal, good midpaced stuff, and complete crap.\n\nAwesome speed metal: Jugulator, Dead Meat, Death Row, Bullet Train. Priest can really do no wrong when they play fast - they're dead on right here. Sometimes the cheese factor is high - for example, the most fucked up rhyming couplet this side of Cannibal Corpse: \"Jugulator, killing time now, reaches in and rips your spine out!\" Ow. My spine.\n\nGood midpaced stuff: Blood Stained, Burn in Hell, Cathedral Spires. Cathedral Spires is a really nice epic number that they should definitely bust out live. The other two are now concert staples, and rightly so - these three are pretty fun.\n\nComplete cra: Decapitate, Brain Dead, Abductors. What the fuck?? This makes Turbo sound like fucking Priest in the East. Enough said. Priest always have some total abortions on most every album, and this is no exception - they kinda spread them around, unlike Defenders of the Faith, so the album does go through its ups and downs quite a bit.\n\nAlso, one more thing - the guitar solos suck. Tipton and Downing can do far better - but the songs are for the most part decent, so it's definitely worth getting.\n",
        "\nBut a pretty fucking good one, if you can get (or make, for that matter) a competent remaster. The worst parts of the album are the inconsistencies in volume, so it's not that hard to jack up some of the songs by 9dB. Sin After Sin is kinda similarly problematic (the original, anyway). \n\nThat said, some of the songs on here are excellent, and the whole thing is a real barrel of fun. It's not Sad Wings of Destiny, but at times it really does hint at it. It's a strange one - the bastard son of Black Sabbath, and your average hippie-rock band (Ten Years After comes to mind). There are a few rocker numbers that are just completely fun... Rocka Rolla (feline on the borderline!) and Cheater come to mind, along with the bouncing opener, One for the Road. Simple but effective riffage.\n\nThen, there's the epic stuff. This is the 70s, where everyone had to be a bit prog and crazy, and this comes out pretty good. The second half of the album is where shit really picks up, with the monster riffage of Never Satisfied. Halford brought it back as part of his live set (FUCK YEAH!) and it did not sound out of place at all. That middle break hints at Tyrant, which of course hints at thrash fucking metal. Run of the Mill is an amazing song (even if the shriek at the end is pitch-shifted) with its long middle soloing section over the hypnotic bass riff (yes, you can actually hear Ian on this LP!), and if you give it 9dB, it turns out wonderful. Then, there's the absolute highlight of the album, Dying to Meet You, which is half Black Sabbath, half Genocide, and all fucking heavy metal. Killer! Killer! Keep your thoughts at bay!\n\nThe rest... Caviar and Meths, I have no idea why they cut it out. I've not heard the Al Atkins studio version, but it's 8 minutes and has lyrics. This version is a minute and a half of noodling. Then there's Winter/Deep Freeze/Winter Retreat (aka the Winter Suite), which is a bit on the boring side.\n\nThat said, this album is quite enjoyable, and never mind its historical importance. Hot on the heels of Black Sabbath, here comes the Next Big Thing!\n",
        "\nI would give this album an \"81\" rating, or thereabouts, if I didn't have five or six bootlegs from this tour that sound better than this. Especially on Tim Owens' singing - on this album, he doesn't do a too good version of \"Painkiller\", but I've heard him nail it repeatedly - did they pick the one performance where he wasn't up to par on purpose???\n\nBut, in the tradition of Priest live albums, the songs here sound better than on the studio versions. \"Beyond the Realms of Death\" is done very nicely, as is \"Diamonds and Rust\" in a different format than the thrashed-up version on Priest in the East. \"The Ripper\" and \"Metal Gods\" are crowd favourites, and the stuff from Jugulator sounds very nice too, especially \"Burn in Hell\" and \"Death Row\". Even the awful \"Abductors\" turns tolerable here.\n\nThe highlight of this album has to be \"Touch of Evil\", though. Rob Halford sang this one, and sang it well, both in 1990 in the studio, and on the 1991 tour. But Tim Owens actually outdoes him - turning this song into something completely menacing. His voice is perfect for this song especially. It's not 100% like that of Rob Halford, but it pretty much is the closest thing out there - he just chooses to give his own interpretations sometimes, and other than a few too many gratuitous high notes sometimes, he does do a good job. \n\nBut, as I said, on some bootlegs, he does a better job than on here. So that's why I can't unequivocally recommend this one. It is very good, but it could have been absolutely legendary.\n",
        "\nThe second best, in fact, after \"Painkiller\" - this one is very very solid from beginning to end. The only reason this album has been looked over is due to the production, which is, for late 1970s, quite excellent, but not as good as that of Priest in the East or Live Insurrection, where one can find better versions of \"Exciter\", \"Stained Class\", and others.\n\nHowever, one should definitely get this album because all together, the songs are very solid - it is definitely worth hearing from beginning to end. The opener, \"Exciter\", is pure speed metal, including the little melodic solo in the middle that Judas Priest made famous. Other highlights include \"Beyond the Realms of Death\", and the hugely, hugely underrated \"Saints in Hell\". It's not a thrash song per se, but that middle break is pure fucking thrash metal. Les Binks's drum work is also very much in the thrash metal vein - while Scott Travis may be far more intense, it's Les that really was their most innovative drummer. \n\nThe other song really worth checking out is the title track, which totally screams \"Iron Maiden\" with the galloping riff after the intro. There are really no songs that are bad or even average on this album, which is rare for Judas Priest (see: \"Pain and Pleasure\") - it's definitely worth getting.\n",
        "\nMy wife once made the assertion (in reference to former KISS drummer Eric Singer) that \"you can't grow up listening to KISS and then BE KISS\". Apparently that doesn't hold true for JUDAS PRIEST and their latest double-CD live set, '98 Live Meltdown, is the release that proves it. There's a good reason it's two discs - out of the twenty-four songs, only four are from Jugulator, their first outing with new singer Tim \"Ripper\" Owens (who lives up to his name, BTW). They jam-packed the rest with tons of tunes from the golden days and before - who can even remember last time they played \"Victim of Changes\" or \"Rapid Fire\" or \"Grinder\" or \"The Ripper\" or \"The Green Manalishi\" live with Rob Halford? And the classics are performed with every bit of energy and passion that you would expect from guys half their age, and Ripper sounds very much like a younger Halford while retaining his own identity. Glen and KK's guitars are thick and full, you can hear the bass for a change, and Scott Travis's drums really liven up some of the older stuff and thrash through the newer stuff - \"Painkiller\" kills I dare say even more than DEATH's recent cover (but that's another review. . .). And the set list is perfect - starting right off with \"The Hellion/Electric Eye\" (one of the best tunes on the album), leaving the moodier pieces like \"Beyond the Realms of Death\" and \"Diamonds and Rust\" for the middle, and slamming through the end with the big anthems \"You've Got Another Thing Coming\", \"Hell Bent for Leather\", and \"Living after Midnight\". Killer. There's nothing else to say, really. It's refreshing to see such a classic band still rocking harder than bands that have been around half as long (we won't name names - METALLICA wouldn't like it. . .). If you call yourself a Priest fan, get this - there's too much classic stuff on here to be missed.\n\n(Originally published in Eternal Frost Webzine #5 and LARM (c) 1999)\n",
        "\nIn another review I made the assertion that the finest metal album ever was Priest's \"Sad Wings of Destiny\" album. This one, though, comes so close it's scary. \"Sad Wings\" was a more diverse album, and was closer to their blues-rock origins, but \"Sin After Sin\" showed the band progressing more towards the style of modern metal that we're all accustomed to now, and \"Stained Class\" was like a refinement of it. Right off the bat, the proto-thrasher \"Exciter\" kicks off the LP in a way different from most thrash bands only in degree, really - fast (for the time) double-kick drums, then in comes the hard-chugging main riff and BAM! Over the whole album, the riffs are more lean and heavy, the solos more fierce, the vocals more intense than had gone on before. The album really only slows down once, with the second-side (remember when albums had sides?) ballad \"Beyond the Realms of Death\", featuring some nice acoustic verses, a heavy chorus, and one hell of an extended solo section in which Glen Tipton once again proves why he's the greatest heavy metal guitar soloist around. Other noteworthy songs are the closer \"Hero's End\", the title track, and the Spooky Tooth cover, \"Better By You, Better Than Me\" (just don't listen to it backwards :). \n\nThe only drawback to the album is the technology of the time, which kept the guitars from coming out in all their raging fury (compare the songs on this to the ones on Unleashed In the East to see what I mean), but the performances on all counts can't be faulted in the least - from song writing to drumming, bass work, vocals, and guitar work, it's all top-quality and an absolute must for anyone who dares call themselves a metalhead. \"Stand up for Exciter!\" \n\n(Originally published at LARM (c) 1999)\n",
        "\nFair warning, the official version product actually being reviewed has only 13 songs, as opposed to all 15. There are ways of acquiring the 15 song version, - I leave this as an exercise to the reader, and will march forth and review the whole bloody thing.\n\nPlain and simple, Priest in the East is the best album ever recorded. It's live, of course, so there is no room for overproduction or studio trickery or addition of silly electronic noises or whatever it is people do in their spare time nowadays to make up for a lack of songwriting skills. (Overdubbing of vox be damned, more on that later!) This album is 100 per cent raw Judas Priest, from the time when men were real men, small furry creatures from Alpha Centauri were real small furry creatures from Alpha Centauri, and everyone, men and small furry creatures alike, played on 11. It's been 23 years, and this album still has not been topped.\n\nFour of Priest's first five albums are represented here... everything except Rocka Rolla, which is really no big loss. All the songs are better than their studio versions, especially the ones on Sin After Sin. Here is the definitive version of \"Diamonds and Rust\" with its intro THRASH riff (I shit you not), and also \"Starbreaker\" and \"Sinner\". \n\nThe Sad Wings songs also definitely get a bit of a punch, especially \"Victim of Changes\" and \"The Ripper\". Also, \"Genocide\" comes off as fucking vicious, just as it should have been in 1976, and finally technology caught up and the raw strength of 16000 fans has provided the necessary power to turn everything into a monster. \"Tyrant\", too - for similar reasons - this very well may be THE first thrash metal recording. Check out that monster riff-set in the middle... and how about Halford fucking nailing \"The Ripper\".\n\nOne of the definite highlights is \"Beyond the Realms of Death\", which is not actually included on the official version. The other Stained Class track is \"Exciter\" (\"White Heat, Red Hot\" was inexplicably not recorded, though it was played on 2/15/79) which already sounded great in 1978, and now just turns fucking lethal. There is nothin heavier for 1979. Not even Into the Fucking Void was this raw and brutal and slicing one down with monstrous speed metal rifs, especially that distorted intro that tears out of the Burning Up machine noises, replacing the original drum pattern. Man, that just sums up the album right there - guitars shrieking from beginning to end. \n\nOtherwise, the album is faithful to the studio versions... \"Genocide\" obviously doesn't fade out so there's actually an extra slow section with a few more riffs added to the end (I heard Priest in the East before Sad Wings, and was left wondering where last bit of the song was on the studio album!) - in fact, they did an even longer version of the song with an extra Tipton solo on that tour and on the 1980 tour (also, an extra long Sinner with a K.K. solo on the '77-79 tours) but didn't put those on the album... oh yes, \"Starbreaker\" has the extra drum solo.\n\nMost importantly, the guitar solos and duels that were part of the original songs are nailed note for note - no biffing a string here and there - the performances are all dead on, especially the aforementioned \"Beyond the Realms of Death\". That's a fucking complex solo, and Tipton nails it.\n\nThen there's the cuts from their latest album at the time, Killing Machine - they fortunately don't concentrate on the commercial dribble - only one song, \"Evil Fantasies\", from that realm, and this one comes off powerful and menacing, as opposed to the goofy studio version. Then throw in \"Delivering the Goods\", an anthem if there ever was one, the lethal speed metal fury riffage of \"Running Wild\", and the singalong of \"The Green Manalishi\" ... and last but certainly not least, the raw blazing fury of \"Hell Bent for Leather\" - the best two minutes and forty seconds in heavy metal.\n\nAnd for those who were wondering - the album was not all faked in a studio. There are a few vocal overdubs here and there, but it is 99% authentic - I should know, I have a bootleg recording of 2/15/79, and it sounds the same! In fact, Halford's vox are nowhere near as bad on the original as the rumours say - in fact I'd say they just weren't miked properly, since the vocals' volume is the only problem with that recording... though when all is said and done, Halford's vox are better on Ringo Starr's front porch, I'll grant that!\n\nI do sincerely hope that everyone was just reading this review for amusement purposes, not because they didn't have the album. If you don't have it - your life has been devoid of meaning up to this point, and will continue to be devoid of meaning until you get this album! So get your act together!!\n",
        "\nWith all due respect to Black Sabbath and the genre they created, the finest Heavy Metal album EVER recorded is Judas Priest's second LP, \"Sad Wings of Destiny\". From 1969 to 1974, Sabbath had been pouring out it's molten sludge from a haze of cocaine and booze, just writing the most fucked-up heavy things ever imagined, but the music was still heavily rooted in the stoner-blues-rock of the time. But in 1974 five young kids from the same city (Birmingham) went into the studio on a shoestring budget and codified in one 37-minute piece of vinyl exactly what a 'heavy metal' album should look and sound like - grandiose intros, piano ballads halfway through the first side, balls-out rockers, super-long moody epics, and TONS of great guitar riffs and solos from arguably the best guitar duo of all time, Glen Tipton and KK Downing. They blaze and rip through \"Tyrant\" and \"Genocide\", slash through \"The Ripper\", play a textbook example of tension-and-release in \"Victim of Changes\", and soar in the grandiose epic finisher \"Dream Deceiver/Deceiver\" (which features the greatest melodic guitar solo of all time by Glen). And remember, this is back when Rob Halford's voice was in its' youthful prime and when Ian Hill actually played BASS (with a nice, fat, edgy tone to boot - the groove he lays down in Deceiver is quintessential). \n\nOf course, being recorded in 1974 AND on a shoestring budget did take its toll a little bit, particularly in the flatness of the drum sounds and the relative infancy of guitar-amp technology, but it still sounds WAY better than it should, and the sound does nothing to detract from the genius of the musicianship and song writing. And I could go on about how Transluxe (the idiots who Gull licensed the CD-reissue to) fucked up big time on the tracking of the disc, completely reversing sides one and two from the LP - that's why 'Prelude' is track five, not track one. Just re-program your CD player and listen to metal at its finest. \n\n(Originally published at LARM (c) 1999)\n"
