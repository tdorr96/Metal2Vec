        "\nBehemoth, nowadays they\u2019re the biggest black metal band out there, and once upon a time they were celebrated as pioneers of the Polish black metal scene, and later praised for popularizing blackened death metal. However, ever since their 2014 magnum opus The Satanist, the band seems to have developed a \"hatedom\" due to how popular they have become, surpassing even Dark Funeral and Dimmu Borgir, and that peaked with their 2018 record I Loved You at Your Darkest, which has since become the most divisive and scrutinized record in black metal. However, I usually don\u2019t buy into hype or \"anti-hype\" and since Behemoth are preparing to release a new album this year, I figured I might as well go back to this often praised and maligned little record.\n\nI\u2019ll start with my gripes with the album, which aren\u2019t many but are worth pointing out, which is that it is definitely less aggressive than The Satanist, while at the same time following that record\u2019s style and overall atmosphere. Furthermore, while I can appreciate Behemoth\u2019s intent of going \u201cbigger\u201d than they did in The Satanist, by bringing in symphonic instrumentation, and even choirs (which yes, includes the often mocked and disparaged children\u2019s choir in the intro track and lead single 'God = Dog'), the fact that it permeates through the entire album makes the music sound somewhat overwrought and even pretentious.\n\nFinally, of course, is how this record does come off as \"The Satanist 2: Blasphemic Boogaloo\", and while I wouldn\u2019t call it a \u201cThe Satanist B-sides\u201d as some people have decried it as, I do agree that the ideas and themes here are more of the same from The Satanist; blasphemic anthems about Satan, Christ, the hypocrisy of the church and references to ol\u2019 Al Crowley for good measure. Also, this is seemingly the first record where long time collaborator and co-lyricist Krzysztof Azarewicz didn\u2019t contribute and in some areas it shows. Nergal is a very good lyricist on his own, but for a record that follows the path of its predecessor, the lack or diminished presence of poetic flair and Biblical literacy that Azarewicz has always added, is missed, although, and to Nergal\u2019s credit, he does have a knack for chant-worthy hooks and choruses.\n\nSo, while I Loved You at Your Darkest does lack in some areas, especially when compared to The Satanist and even Evangelion, does that mean the \u201chaters\u201d are right? No, because while not as fresh and unique as The Satanist, ILYAYD is still a pretty good record and at its best, it showcases how Behemoth can evolve by pivoting from The Satanist. What I personally enjoy the most of this record and what\u2019s its biggest strength is how the songwriting and music seems to be heavily inspired by gothic rock and post-punk, as well as Nergal\u2019s country and blues project Me and That Man. This can be heard in tracks like 'Sabbath Mater', 'If Crucifixion Was Not Enough\u2026' and 'Rom 5:8' where the drumming and bass work of Inferno and Orion respectively are the backbone of the songs, and the guitars add flair in the solo work. Furthermore and in direct contrast from The Satanist, the music is also much more progressive and symphonic second single 'Bartzabel' is the biggest example of this, and it also applies to the best song in the entire album 'Havohej Pantocrator', both songs are sprawling epics with massive riffs and melodies and grand atmospheres.\n\nHowever, and in spite of all the unorthodox experimenting the band did in this record, they certainly haven\u2019t lost or downplayed their blackened touch, as the rest of the tracks are predominantly blast beat driven and riff heavy ragers with occasional moments of the weird experimenting and genre bending I highlighted in the major tracks. And while having those two very specific moods might somewhat make the album formulaic, the band do a good job of balancing both styles and also succeed and being consistent and at 46 minutes the album is substantial and enjoyable, though in my opinion the track 'We Are the Next 1000 Years' is the least interesting track and it's something of a fizzling way to close the album, and that feeling was worsened when the band released their A Forest EP which had a much better closing track, but I digress.\n\nOverall, if Behemoth has had so much success, it is definitely off the back of The Satanist and I Loved You at Your Darkest, and while I can agree it is flawed, I have to absolutely disagree with the vitriol this album has gotten, since the best aspect of this album is how Behemoth once again, succeed in evolving, even if this album is one step forward, and two lateral steps from The Satanist.\n\nBest tracks: 'Bartzabel', 'Sabbath Mater', 'Havohej Pantocrator', 'Rom 5:8'\n\nWritten for www.MetalBite.com.\n",
        "\nAfter the premiere of the (fantastically received) album \"The Satanist\", Behemoth set off on a long concert tour, during which they presented their latest work in its entirety, additionally enriching the setlist with a few best-known compositions from previous years. I managed to catch the guys twice on \"Live Satanist\" and each time was great: amazing musicians, phenomenal show in terms of visuals, crowds of fans in front of the stage, and, of course, polished, hypnotizing songs, skilfully combining black metal atmosphere with death metal brutality. The release of a concert album from this period was only a matter of time. And so, in April 2018, \"Messe Noir\" hit the market: a recording of the show from Warsaw, additionally enriched with the \"official bootleg\" from Brutal Assault and numerous videos promoting the (then) last album. The release is available as a DVD+CD or Blu-ray+CD, while I base my text on the latter, slightly more expensive version.\n\nAlthough the main dish of \"Messe Noir\" is a concert in video form, the CD itself is packed in a digipak of standard dimensions, just like a normal CD. Visually, the release is impressive: an atmospheric (and thick!) cover with artwork by Denis Forkas, and a 48 (!) page booklet inside, containing high-quality, black-and-white photos of the band, both from backstage and rocking out on stage - it's been a long time since I put something so nice on my shelf. It's a pity, however, that there's a fly in the ointment: the transparent pages with the lyrics are basically unreadable and both the CD and the video discs are inserted into black envelopes, from which they have to be slid out - even if you're careful when inserting/removing the CDs, scratches will appear on them after a while. The result was that Behemoth's live album looked worse six months after its release than albums that are almost twenty years old. \n\nThe CD itself, entitled 'Messe Noir: Live Satanist', is... well, everything the name suggests, that is the whole album performed live. The sound of the band is strong, but also selective, Nergal's furious vocals (very different than on the LP) sometimes make you shiver, the audience, audible from the very beginning, gives everything. It's really good. And only one thing does not give you peace: why the concert from Warsaw is so short? \"Messe Noir\" on vinyl contains additional tracks played that evening (including the furious \"Pure Evil and Hate\" or the bone-breaking \"Ov Fire and the Void\"), while the CD ends with \"O Father O Satan O Sun!\". Due to this, the album is somehow relegated to the level of a mere curiosity, because if you have a choice between the studio album and the live album with the same tracklist, the vast majority of people will choose \"The Satanist\". It would be a different matter if we got the full recording of the show: then, apart from excellent new compositions, we would also have a mini-set of the greatest hits on a single CD.\n\nFortunately, there are no more cuts on the Blu-ray disc: not only do we get the full recording of the show from Progresja, but also a set of videos and... the second concert, this time from Brutal Assault. The menu, based on Forkas' works, is aesthetically stunning, but how about the 'essence'? I, of course, approached the whole material a bit \"from the back side\", starting with the clips. There are a total of six of them in the \"Cinematic Archive\" section, including one new:\"O Father O Satan O Sun!\" All of them are characterised by high production values, while my favourites are: the disturbing \"Messe Noir\" by Zev Deans and the extremely dynamic \"Ora Pro Nubis Lucifer\", showing Behemoth in concert action. However, someone from the team responsible for this section of the concert album clearly overslept, as the videos can vary dramatically in terms of volume. After some of the clips, I had to turn the TV down only to return to the previous settings a few minutes later, which was extremely annoying. Also annoying are the \"end credits\" permanently embedded in the video, needlessly introducing a moment of downtime. In my opinion, they could easily be cut out and simply added to the \"Credits/Crew\" option in the menu, where we could find a list of people responsible for particular jobs. \n\nThe main dish on \"Messe Noir\" shows Behemoth refining their stage show almost to perfection - the line between concert and theatre has never been so thin with them. We have blood spitting, bizarre poses, burning decorations, pillars of fire and the controversial sharing of the wafer with the \"faithful\" or the prayer played from the tape. If for someone it will be the first meeting with the \"Live Satanist\" show, every track will be a surprise. The whole thing is dynamically edited, the 1080p image is razor-sharp for most of the concert (in some places the blue lighting gets in the way), the camera work can surprise you (a wonderful flight through black confetti!), but I have two minor comments. First off: the visuals. The band decided to embellish their Warsaw show with animations played on two big screens set up on the side of Inferno's throne and while from the audience's level it might have given a nice effect, unfortunately, the cameras set at a sharp angle were not able to catch the image and for most of the film we are haunted by white sheets. The second problem is more serious, as it concerns Seth's solos: during the more impressive performances the musician stands in such a place that we can't see what the hell he is doing. No camera catches him - the editor did his best to get out of this situation, but still the effect is, at least, questionable. Whether it's \"Messe Noir\", \"O Father O Satan O Sun!\" or \"Ov Fire and the Void\" - we can't see shit. To \"sweeten\" it, it's not any better at the second concert...\n\n'Cos yes, \"Messe Noir\" is not only a concert from Progresja, but also a performance during the Brutal Assault festival. The setlist is of course identical, except that, due to the time constraints, the band had to throw out three tracks. Despite the fact that we are dealing with an \"official bootleg\", the video presents no less professionally than from the Warsaw gig. Of course, there are no visualisations, filters, impressive slow-mo or other such \"tricks\", but also thanks to that it is so... I don't know, more authentic? Instead of screens there are iconic, black, two-headed eagles, against which the musicians look even more ominous (I missed this view during the concert in Progresja), but apart from that: the show is very similar to the one in Warsaw. Here, too, Seth has positioned himself rather awkwardly, except that the Czechs quite quickly tried to make up for the situation. As far as \"Messe Noir\" was lost, on the following tracks you can see at least... well, anything, and certainly more than in Poland. \"Live Assault\" is very enjoyable to watch and in places the group comes off even better than in the main show. The biggest drawback of this concert is probably the fact that often in wider shots we see official \"brutal\" stalls with beer and food - and this effectively spoils the dark atmosphere of the show. But that's the beauty of festivals, isn't it?\n\nThe concerts promoting \"The Satanist\" were almost perfect and while I cannot say that about the release documenting these events, it is not that \"Messe Noir\" is a poor concert album; on the contrary - for 50 zlotys we get a piece of decent music, additionally beautifully packaged. And it is all the more pity that this musical diamond has been left with small scratches, which somewhat spoil the image of the whole. They do not allow us to enjoy its beauty in full. Envelopes on the CD, lack of all tracks in audio format, minor technical and production errors - it may not be a big deal, but it is an irritation nonetheless. Nevertheless, I encourage you to reach for \"Messe Noir\" - despite minor flaws, it's still a product worth attention, and who knows, maybe the things I mentioned won't bother you. If you were on the \"Live Satanist\" tour, it will be a nice souvenir for you, if not - you'll have a chance to see the Pomeranian Beast in top form and in glorious 1080p. Well, unless you reach for the DVD... \n\nOriginally written for www.metalside.pl\n",
        "\nFuck the naysayers and revisionists. Before their slew of mind-numbingly bland death metal discs and before their turn to little more than quasi-Satanic lifestyle brand, Behemoth crafted some inspiringly dark and masterful pagan black metal. I would go so far as to say Sventevith is precisely what a black metal album should be - it\u2019s got all the rawness and intensity one expects of extreme metal, but balances it out with a romanticism that pervades the somewhat-folky guitar melodies and the especially memorable instrumental interludes, which easily evoke images of fur-clad medieval Europeans huddled around a fire in the Pomeranian forests.\n\nThis imagery pervades the record, with each grandiose chord progression and high-pitched shriek seemingly pulled from a forgotten, barbarous age. Even the sloppy guitar solos help to sell the subject matter, their untrained charm reminiscent of the rough imperfections of a warrior tribe's art. All this doesn't even even consider the monumental riffing - it drives ever forward while looking ever backward with a reverent, folk-styled sonority. Indeed, even the more straightforward tracks (\"Wolves Guard My Coffin\" comes to mind) are bolstered by this sound in small, subtle ways, and the best tracks (like \"From the Pagan Vastlands\") incorporate it fully. \n\nIf the album has a noticeable flaw, it's pacing. The interludes, though lovely, are many. Pieces like these are best employed to break up a long stretch of raw, intense metal tracks; the first one on Sventevith is the second track. The last of these interludes could've made an excellent outro, but instead the record ends suddenly and inauspiciously with one of its weakest, most uninspired metal riffs. Still, weird pacing and a less-than-stellar ending is hardly enough to mar an album of this quality - truly a must-have for devotees of the 90s Euro sound.\n",
        "\nIt doesn't take long to establish this is basically a mixture of a less experimental, more straightforward, European late 90's Morbid Angel, and Nile. Morbid because of the confrontational Steve Tucker vocals, the ultra low-tuned abrasive guitars. Nile because of the predominant harmonic minor (middle-eastern mood), the hyperactive drums trigger happy on the blasts, the frantic work rate over outrageous tempos and the compartmentalized sections with bits of riffs glued together.\n\nTo put this to rest straight away, the album obviously sounds terrific. That's the driving force on this. Which is ironically the issue here. This sounds like the guitarist fell in love with the tone he was getting with his gear and thought his voice sounded really good too in that setup, the drummer couldn't get enough of how proficient he was... the result being this album generally feels like a platform showcasing those fantastic sounding instruments before being about song-writing prowess, which is what all albums should focus on first and foremost. This genuinely feels like it wouldn't have mattered a whole lot what the songs were made up of, what riffs or sections were playing, just so long as the instruments kept the jam alive.\n\nIt doesn't help they went with what was an attempt at being esoteric, with the masonic symbols and references whether visually (album cover) or semantically, or the repeated use of the edgy cult \"Ov\" in song titles. A song on here is called 'Blackest ov the black'. Check for yourself if you don't believe it. In case it wasn't clear, this is high school level maturity. This strongly devalues the whole experience, which wasn't incredible anyways, as the music sounds like wide-open, festival metal and never even tries to reach for darker ambiances. By all means, this should've sounded a lot more cryptic seeing how it promotes itself. It's all in-your-face, \"metal up your ass\" demeanor, from beginning to end. \n\nSome bands are just content with a \"chug chug, blast beats blast beats, heavy hertas and double kicks to death\" philosophy. This album is practically a sound check session that lasts three quarters of an hour. Isn't metal at its best when it's dark and subtle or revolting on some level ?\n\nWhat's really disappointing is, beyond the obvious and general waste of a humongous production sound, Behemoth here actually do show off (extremely scarcely) a different facet of their sound, that avoids being exactly like 99% of the record: the short 'Hekau 718' is eminently industrial in spirit and a truly cleverly crafted bit of sonic violence. It's got a pretty unique edge to it with those clanky electronic keyboard plucks and the overwhelming breath of overdrive instilled into the whole and Nergal pouring out the vocal hatred, in a pulsating mechanical environment. It's odd and brave. Had they been able to mix in more of similar content to distract the listener from the mundane heaviness that is ultimately this work, this could've been a properly interesting listen with more than one layer to it. By the very next track of course, we're right back to that unimaginative, hollow anthem routine.\n\nBecause it sounds gorgeous, it still deserves a few high points. The tremolo picking sounds seething, the squealing harmonics and palm muted hertas or power chords alike feel pleasantly wide, the leads breathe with lush reverb, the vocals sound omnipresent and a balanced mixture between death and black metal. On the drums the toms and snares sound as crisp as imaginable, like they're right there within reach, as if there weren't other instruments around, just perfectly audible, the kicks aggressive machine gun bombs, and the blasts wreak serious havoc. The highlight track is arguably 'As Above So Below' with its recognizable theme acting as one of the main refrains on the record.\n\nCurious about the meaning of the album title ? I don't know, something to do with this English oddball Austin Osman Spare and his belief in magic. But as far as this album goes: \"Zos Kia Cultus\" truly means \"bring your pillow\". Because unless you're overwhelmed by the production, it's about to get redundant.\n",
        "\nI became a Behemoth fan with Demigod almost 20 years ago, and after listening to it on a near-constant loop; I had high expectations for The Apostasy. I was so used to the (triggered to hell as they may be) drums of Inferno, the buzz-saw guitar work of Nergal, and the immense, multi-layered, demonic vocals of Nergal. Most people used to scream, \u201cBut come on! The album delivers that and more, surely!\u201d Well, times can change it.\n\nAt first glance, yes, the album is every bit as technical, as brutal and as immense as Demigod. But something\u2019s missing. There\u2019s an almost unenviable feel of repetition, boredom and a very uninspired Nergal.\n\nThe album starts off all well and good with \u201cSlaying The Prophets ov Isa\u201d and yes, the song is promising. It\u2019s brutal, technical and makes you want to kill small animals. However, not long after this song ends and the next song begins, you start to wonder if they hadn\u2019t just made one song and hit \u201cloop\u201d every now and again. The songs are good, but the inventive riffs like those found on Demigod are few and fair between.\n\nThe good points for this album however, are really good. The vocal work is more precise and concise, less \u201cI\u2019M SO DEMONIC\u201d and more \u201cFUCK OFF!\u201d The guitar work HAS stepped up in technicality (if not inventiveness). The drums are still insane, I doubt Inferno could ever not be as mad as he is. They have done away with the triggered drums which made me cringe a bit, as their choice of production has left the drums sound too, off in the distance. Almost like a live recording instead of a sound-proof studio.\n\nThe highest point of this album is Inner Sanctum, the song with Warrell Dane of Nevermore fame on guest vocals. The song is creepy and brooding with a large feeling of hopelessness. I was very impressed with how they managed to make Warrell Dane\u2019s voice, the strings and a piano fit in with the brutal riffage, but they did it. Pazuzu (with Seth pulling the strings which is a pleasure) and Christgrinding Avenue (dark brutality, wisely guided and a lot of black meat) put the end to a tremendous, raging, incontestably and portentous work with such a technical, magical fierce.\n\nAll in all, I used to consider a decent album with nothing really BAD about it, but it grows on me over the years. So, this is essential Behemoth without a doubt.\n",
        "\nThis review is so painful for me to write for so many reasons. Let's just say that Nergal is a huge influence for me and Behemoth is one of my favorite, all-time, death metal bands. While this record is not all that bad, it is definitely not the Behemoth I know and love. Sorry, Nergal; I love you man, but this is starting to veer pretty darn close to a \"St Anger\" level release...\n\nFor starters, I am not sure what Nergal was thinking with the song-writing with this record. On the one hand, the typical blasphemy is present, which is always welcome. On the other hand, it feels like he is loosening up with the guitar playing and music. It seems that he thoiught to himself that, \"Yeah, I have done it all and proven myself. Now, I don't need to play so extreme anymore. I can relax a bit.\" Sure, I can understand the sentiment when a band has been playing at a high level for this long. But, come on? I think this illustrates my feeling on this record; Behemoth has toned it down quite a bit and it shows.\n\nWhat is most important for any album is the song-writing and that is, unfortunately, my biggest gripe with this record. So, on one hand we have Behemoth lightening up and writing a much softer album, and on the other hand, the song-writing is not as good. These two things combine to make for a lack-luster album that warrants a great deal of criticism. Many of the riffs are straight, rock-n-roll riffs. They aren't bad riffs, per se, but they are fairly weak. The drumming supports this with equally light, swinging rock drums. Not through the whole album, mind you, but there are extended forays. Songs such as \"Sabbath Mater\" and \"Ecclesia Diabolica Catholica\" (until the end of the song) feel a bit cheesy, light, and \"not metal\" to me. They aren't bad songs, mind you, just not befitting for Behemoth's legacy. \n\nStill, there are plenty of heavy moments and there are some great songs on here. For example, \"Angelvs XIII\" is an extreme, well-played song that feels more like what I would expect of the band. Songs like \"Bartzabel\" are triumphs on the album, being memorable, dark, and undeniably Behemoth. Inferno's drumming is stellar throughout the album even if he does a little light rock, swing here and there. The atmosphere is also quite dark through much of the album, with a raw, but well-produced vibe throughout. The vocals sound exactly like \"The Satanist\", which is not a bad thing. It's these heavy, memorable, atmospheric qualities of the album that lift it up and make it worthy of purchase. \n\nUnfortunately, I don't see many people giving this entire album repeated spins over the years despite the positive qualities to be found. A select song or two, such as \"Bartzabel\", will certainly get repeat plays, but, not so much, the album in its entirety. Overall, this is a lackluster and half-hearted continuation of \"The Satanist\" and probably the weakest album in the Behemoth catalog. That is still saying a lot considering this album does have some good high points and several redeeming qualities. For now, this is the experimental album of Behemoth's catalog and one I can't say is representative of their legacy.\n",
        "\nSo here\u2019s the quick take if you want to spare yourself any extra time reading about an album you should neither be excited about, nor purchase: Behemoth, arguably for the first time in its entire career, phoned in what is essentially a Walmart version of Aosoth on training wheels, and slapped a silly name on it as a marketing tactic to lure in teenagers still angry at their parents for making them go to church. If you want the in-depth analysis, by all means continue reading.\n\nYou know those moments when the people in life whom you love and respect give you the whole, \u201cI\u2019m not mad, I\u2019m just disappointed\u201d spiel? That is exactly the feeling fans are going to have after the letdown that is I Loved You at Your Darkest fully sinks in. While it\u2019s true that not all of Behemoth\u2019s 10 previous full-lengths have knocked listeners off their feet, most of them have played an essential role in taking Poland\u2019s most popular black metal outfit to heights no other extreme band in the entirety of Eastern Europe has ever experienced. Most recently, the deservedly popular and now four-year-old album The Satanist re-captured plenty of older fans who saw it as an invigorating return to form after the stagnation of The Apostasy and Evangelion. The Satanist was packed to the brim with the same types of riffs that made the original Nergal/Baal era shine so brightly in the eyes of the underground, but with the energy and enthusiasm that Inferno brought to the table during the band\u2019s most classic run of albums in the early aughties.\n\nTo rewind slightly, the importance of Behemoth\u2019s early second wave material may often be understated due to both the experimental nature that was common for black metal in the mid 90\u2019s (acoustic guitars, operatic vocals, synth-heavy song segments), and also its lack of ferocity (Baal had a style of his own that was fitting for the time, but he was no Inferno). In fact, the only real glimpses of pure black metal Behemoth ever showed with Inferno was a three song EP entitled Bewitching the Pomerania, which featured only one original song, and Pandemonic Incantations, which already showed signs of the band beginning to transition to the blackened death style that would put Poland on the map forever.\n\nWhen Behemoth\u2019s completist fans argue over which of the band\u2019s albums reigns supreme, it\u2019s generally one of the three consecutive albums that hit the sweet spot of firmament-tearing riffs and a destructive blitzkrieg of drumming that set the standard for blackened death metal, namely Satanica, Thelema.6, and Zos Kia Cultus. Demigod, although popular at the time of its release, started a transition of form over function that may have excited fans due to overblown production and pomp, but would not go on to age very well, something that was even more apparent on the two albums that followed.\n\nIt\u2019s a general rule, even in extreme metal, that once band members can sustain a nice living churning out album after album with little-to-no effort, not much is done to push musical boundaries ever again. That\u2019s not to say living on the road is by any means an easy thing to do, but why ruin a good thing when it\u2019s not broken? That\u2019s what side projects are for. Well the defiance of this attitude, quite frankly, is what made The Satanist so goddamned exciting. In terms of accessibility, Nergal would have been better off sticking to the same formula that sold so many copies of The Apostasy and Evangelion, but he took a risk, and going with his gut apparently paid off. Well, that wave is exactly what Nergal, Inferno, and Orion were counting on riding when they phoned in this piece of shit, folks, because I Loved You at Your Darkest is a giant, riffless turd that you\u2019re going to have to flush more than once to remove from your memory.\n\n\u2013 I Loved You at Your Darkest will hereby be given a new name for the sake of brevity: I<3\u2019[email\u00a0protected] \u2013\n\nFirst, let\u2019s talk about aesthetic, since that is the only thing that\u2019s going to sell I<3\u2019[email\u00a0protected] The album starts out with a choir of children singing about the same type of sacrilegious jargon Behemoth has been using since Satanica, but it\u2019s not backed up by any actual music. The same children\u2019s chorus is repeated on \u201cGod = Dog,\u201d one of three tracks that received a music video before the album was even released. One of the most unfortunate things about the album is that it shares the brilliant, stripped-down-but-still-crisp production of The Satanist, but there are no riffs to accompany the production. It isn\u2019t until I<3\u2019[email\u00a0protected]\u2018s fifth track, \u201cBartzabel,\u201d that the illusion that this album could possibly be worth a shit falls flat on its face. The songwriting displayed here is drastically formulaic, and is the laziest attempt to piece notes together that Nergal has put forth over the 27 years that Behemoth has been a band. One could get more riffs out of a lone tumbleweed waddling through the wastelands of Western Texas. Well, at least there\u2019s still Inferno. Right? Right?!\n\nAround the time of Zos Kia Cultus and Demigod, Inferno was a shoo-in on any list when it came to naming the best drummers in metal. Consequently, this was right around the time that his founding band Azarath put forth its sophomore effort, Infernal Blasting, an album that would give any Behemoth release a solid run for its money. Although Inferno\u2019s relevance as a drummer has waned, his live performances on tour are more than proof that the dude can still hold his own behind a kit, which is why he may have used only one hand for the studio recording of I<3\u2019[email\u00a0protected] Hell, even by Polish standards, younger drummers such as Darkside (Kriegsmaschine, Mg\u0142a) and Namtar (Furia, FDS) wipe their asses with toilet paper stronger than the fills and cymbal work on this album, and that doesn\u2019t even begin to describe how thoroughly boring Inferno sounds for all 46 minutes of I<3\u2019[email\u00a0protected]\n\nThe bottom line is that it\u2019s perfectly understandable for bands to be distracted in the off season. To continue the sports metaphor, when a team wins the championship, its players are distracted with so many things, whether it be internal vices such as pride or arrogance, or external obligations such as commercials, photo shoots, and endorsements that make it so much harder to focus on next season. In 2014, Behemoth might as well have won the championship, and since then has released one EP, three compilations, and three live albums all on top of touring considerably. It\u2019s no wonder the band is trying to bullshit its way into hitting those sales margins again, and it probably can with the amount of market share it has captured in the last four years. But for fuck\u2019s sake, y\u2019all, do something better with the amount of power and attention you now have. In the amount of time it took to shoot all three ridiculous videos for I<3\u2019[email\u00a0protected], teenage Nergal could have riffed circles around whatever hollow shells of artists are on display here. Meanwhile, a hologram version of Inferno from 15 years ago would be more interesting to watch than whatever autopilot mode he seems to be in now.\n\nOf all the releases Behemoth has ever brought to the drawing board, this one contains the highest level of material that should have been scrapped and sent to the junkyard. It is complete and utter bullshit that the band would put its well-earned reputation on the line just to ride its recent wave of popularity in both the underground and in the mainstream metal community. Sure, people with no musical backbone might pretend I<3\u2019[email\u00a0protected] excites them, but even the most shallow of all metalheads will end up being astonished at the amount of dust this will collect on their shelves even if they do try and tout it as one of their favorites of the year. Next time, Behemoth, try at least pretending you give a shit.\n\n\n*Originally Written for Last Rites*\n",
        "\nI haven't heard so much to Behemoth, of all their works the one I was most familiar with was \u201cThe Satanist\u201d and I haven't even listened to it completely, only a couple of songs. In my mind they were established as a blackened death metal band with satanic/anti-christian themes and lyrics. I was aware of their past as a black metal band, but since it was such a short era (ignoring the 4 demos and 2 EPs) I decided to pass over it.\n\nI didn't know what I was missing\n\nThis album has been a surprise for me, probably because I didn't have any high expectations due to two reasons. Firstly, I had read the comments of people about how Behemoth in their \u201cblack\u201d era was nothing more than an average band, and secondly I didn't expect this early Behemoth to have this sound. From someone who has only listened to Behemoth's most recent songs I really didn't expect compositions that rely so heavily on acoustic guitar and keyboards. Those instruments create a strong folk sounding compositions that are increased thanks to the instrumental segments such as \u201cAncient\u201d and especially thanks to the song \u201cHell Dwells in Ice\u201d which is undoubtedly one of the strongest points of the work.\n\nBehemoth's first record has a strong romantic aura, the elements connect with each other throughout the album except for the song \u201cTransylvanian Forest\u201d due to this track was not originally recorded for this album (which was originally going to be a demo).\n\nNevertheless, there are some negative points to this album, but I don't find them very important, the production is weak and although in some occasions it eclipses for moments the guitar and drums, but it doesn't influence the music too much to making it a negative experience. Another common complaint about this album are the instrumentals. This is not going to be the album where I talk about the short instrumental and fillers, but I think that in many occasions this kind of tracks is hated for merely existing when sometimes they do fulfill their function, which in most cases it's atmospheric and with the objective to work as a bridge between tracks or as intros or outros.\u201cAncient\u201d fulfills his function, and perhaps it is \u201cThe Touch of Nya\u201d who ends up being irrelevant to the final work.\n\nThe last negative comment would be about the song \u201cTransylvanian Forest\u201d which as already mentioned is not part of the original work and ruins what would have been an ideal closing for the album. Personally, it bothers me that it had to be like this because it's not even a bad song, in fact, it's quite good., it's just not part of the same universe as the others, and this dissonance makes it come off badly. If there is one song on the album that I could consider weak that one would be \u201cForgotten Cult of Aldaron\u201d because it doesn't match up the quality the rest of the album gives.\n\nOtherwise, the album is completely memorable, with a style of their own the compositions manage to not be repetitive, it reaches and makes a unique and mature sound. Songs like \u201cHidden in a Fog, \u201d \u201cEntering the Faustian Soul\u201d or the already mentioned \u201cHell Dwells in Ice\u201d are undoubtedly the highlights of the album but without taking merit away from the rest of the songs. Behemoth manages to be melodic, heavy and atmospheric at different parts in the same composition, and they achieve this with the use of very few resources since they use the same ones throughout the whole album without it getting boring or repetitive. At the end, that\u2019s one of the things I value the most since it's something that only a few geniuses can do.\n",
        "\nConsidered by many as the magnum opus of the polish blackened death powerhouse Behemoth, The Satanist is one of the most widespread blackened death metal - or anything closely related to black metal for that matter - albums out there. It\u2019s quite easy to see why this album has enjoyed such popularity even among non-metalheads. Behemoth have toned down their technicality, upped their production values and added orchestral elements that give the album quite a grand sound. Hell, there\u2019s even some very obvious rock influence in some of these tracks; something Behemoth have never showcased on their earlier works.\n\nA more seasoned metal listener will quickly notice that the band has kept things quite simple when it comes to the band instrumentation. No technical riffing, fancy drumming or crazy bass solos to be seen on this album. Instead Behemoth has opted for a more simplistic and groovy approach, letting the arrangements such as trumpets, saxophones and all sorts of ambient noises bring depth to the music. This is a big change of direction from Behemoth\u2019s previous album, Evangelion, where arrangements like these were kept to a minimum and the depth and intensity of the music came straight from the band itself as they played at a much higher technical level than on this album. There are however still tracks here that possess that old Behemoth sound and energy, such as Furor Divinus and Amen.\n\nAs the band has made way for the aforementioned arrangements, the lack of hooks becomes apparent. All of these songs are quite calculated and honestly not very complicated. It seems like Behemoth has prioritised live playability during the writing of this album, trading blistering speed and technicality for more a straightforward and atmospheric approach. This does reduce the musical depth of the album, even with all the extra arrangements, and that unfortunately leads to a reduced listening lifespan; this album sounds great during the first few listens, but loses most of its substance quite quickly.\n\nNergal\u2019s vocals are as great as ever with a slightly more expressive tone this time. Lyrically the album doesn\u2019t differ much from the band\u2019s previous material. The message is the same it has always been with Behemoth and with very clearly expressed lyrics such as \u201cI saw the virgins cunt spawning forth a snake\u201d and \u201cI believe in Satan, who rend both heavens and earth, and in the Antichrist\u201d, you may want to come up with something else as background music for family dinner.\n\nWhen it comes to the band\u2019s performance, there isn\u2019t really that much to say. Most of the riffing on this album is pretty basic black/blackened death metal stuff that won\u2019t raise any eyebrows. There are however some noteworthy solos on songs like Messe Noire and O Father O Satan O Sun! with clear as day rock influence. Not something you\u2019d expect to hear in a blackened death metal album but they do fit in quite nicely. Inferno\u2019s drumming is solid as always, though nowhere near as complex as on Behemoth\u2019s previous records. The album has been mixed well with all instruments being easily audible (Yes, that includes the bass) even during all the arrangements. Production-wise The Satanist is a very clean and polished sounding album. No disgustingly filthy slabs of gritty polish black metal brutality to be found here, only crystal clear, neatly packed and easily digestible blackened death metal anthems for the whole family! Well\u2026maybe not quite but you get the point; this is a very \u201ceasy\u201d album to listen to and surely a gateway album into extreme metal for many.\n\nWhether or not you appreciate the trade-off of technicality for atmosphere, it has to be admitted that this album is a very well-crafted piece of extreme music. There are no songs that stick out because of their shortcomings. Though it has to be said that not every single song on this record brings something new to the table either. Behemoth has played it safe for the most part but the end result is \u2013 while not necessarily very exciting for more experienced metalheads \u2013 a well rounded blackened death LP with catchy songs, great atmosphere and a very clean \u2013 some might even say sterile \u2013 production.\n",
        "\nBeing the first time reviewing Behemoth, I felt that it was necessary though they've already gotten so many reviews already of this one. So this album/band has been around for a while, but are to me being a newbie to them. And their music. I think that their style is pretty unique and cool. The guitars neatly orchestrated and played out. There weren't any songs on here that I disliked. It just took me a while to get into this one. Even though it's gotten some spins, more in this case is better. You get a better feel to what they're like as well. The band themselves are well established in the metal community.\n\nThe main thing that I took a liking to were the guitars. Definitely heavy but melodic. They pave out their own music unique qualities to them. I felt that they did well in that respect. Nergal their frontman know how to put out great music. A lot that's on here is their own style and vibe. It's dark, but still worthy of praise. Since I'm not familiar with their newer or older releases, I cannot really compare them to any of those. But they have me hooked. I'm in for the long haul with this band as long as they continue to put out quality material. And with this one, they did the band some justice. A great effort here!\n\nI thought the atmosphere and sound quality was top notch. The vocals went well with the music. They definitely are a very dark band, And this one is an example of it. There are some blast beating on here though not to a very common occurrence. A lot of the tempos are rather slow (not all) but still well pieced together. I enjoyed this album from start to finish. I don't think any song on here isn't unique. They all did a good job at orchestrating original music along with the vibe that they portray. Nergal gives us some great musicianship and way in their genres to look for in a band.\n\nI bought this CD because I'm a CD collector. And this band being so well reviewed, that I'd give it a try. I'm actually planning on getting more of their releases in their discography. This one was a good start though the album tittle is so grim 'The Satanist'. I'm sure that they don't want you to take it to heard, but just the fact that they are a definitely dark band who takes their music seriously in getting it to sound like the darkest pits of hell. You could probably find this one online and if you're new to the band, expect diversity in style. They really know how to get their sound out here and music awesomely played! Check this one out!\n",
        "\nThe older ones among us remember that there was a time when Behemoth created really intensive, exciting and uncompromising music. \u201cBewitching the Pomerania\u201d is a document of this time. Chronologically, it built the bridge from \u201cGrom\u201d to \u201cPandemonic Incantations\u201d, but both the new song (the opener) and the re-recorded versions of two previously released tracks rather tend to \u201cGrom\u201d than to its successor. It is still more or less pure black metal which is offered. \u201cWith Spell of Inferno (Mefisto)\u201d stands in the centre of the release, even though the other tracks are pretty solid in view of their wicked guitars, their well-integrated breaks and their nebulous atmosphere. The only exclusive piece does not reach the level of the outstanding jewels of \u201cGrom\u201d, but it still sounds stable, robust and thunderous. Slightly erratic keyboards emphasize the atmosphere which is created by the powerful and coherent guitars, while Nergal\u2019s vocals deliver the final demonic touch. This is definitely no lukewarm leftover, but a song that meets on an equal footing with the majority of the regular album tracks.\n\n\u201cHidden in the Fog\u201d could be a bit stormier, but its heroic fanfares give the song a special feature. Maybe some percent of power get lost due to the somewhat blurred production. Don\u2019t expect a feast of transparency, but black metal has never been the style where clarity and cleanness play an important role. Given this situation, the swampy appearance of the production also has an impact on \u201cSventevieth\u201d, a more aggressive track, but it\u2019s aggression is also a bit gone with the Baltic winds. It therefore remains an open question whether or not it was really necessary to re-record these two pieces. Be that as it may; those who want to make their Behemoth collection complete cannot do much wrong with this EP, but everything would have been easier with the integration of \u201cWith Spell of Inferno\u201d on \u201cGrom\u201d. However, guess it was just born too late.\n",
        "\nWhat's remarkable about this artist in particular is the lasting popularity they went on to achieve regardless of their lack of quality output. It just goes to show that with an effective marketing campaign and a willingness to tweak your sound based on the latest focus group findings you can achieve anything. But as with so many albums with more cultural significance than the minds that birthed them, the crucible of youth burns a fire hot enough to melt away unnecessary fat, and leave only the grains of creative beauty behind. As was the case in the mid-1990s for Poland's Behemoth.\n\nTheir tale is not so much one of a young artist enthralled by black metal only to side step into death metal later, so much as it is an artist keen to imitate their betters. Once that failed, they moved on to a stylised form of tech-death that could easily be monetised regardless of quality. But much like Satyricon who took a similar path, there was value and potential in these pre-commercial early efforts, which so often start out as imitation in the first place. After the respectable \u2018\u2026from the Pagan Vastlands\u2019 came their debut LP \u2018Sventevith (Storming Near the Baltic)\u2019 in 1995. Taken in context it\u2019s a fine entry to the lexicon of mid-90s black metal, one that was leaning in the symphonic direction in the wake of Emperor, along with the likes of Satyricon, Dimmu Borgir, and early Graveland. And much like Graveland of this time, it was able to channel the twin requirements of rawness with a unique and cold atmosphere that really can\u2019t be captured by more polished production jobs.\n\nMellow and elegantly simple guitar work ponderously bounces along at marching tempos, offset by the occasional galloping rhythm that conjures up imagery of open and cold landscapes in the mind of the listener. Frequent but not excessive keyboards are then able to compliment this harmonic foundation, occasionally offering twinkling, cyclical melodies which give this music a mournful, cathartic quality. Vocals are very much in the black metal range, and are supressed and distant in the mix, of course with plenty of reverb applied, so that they contribute to the sense of size that this album has. Despite frequently delving into frantic passages of blast-beats and busier chord progressions, \u2018Sventevith (Storming Neat the Baltic)\u2019 has an undeniably mellow quality to it. The aim here is atmosphere and mood over riff-based ear pummelling; the latter qualities already present in Behemoth of this era, notably on the \u2018\u2026And the Forest Dreams Eternally\u2019 EP released later in 1995.\n\nDrums, although for the most part unremarkable, are sometimes brought way up in the mix with a lot of reverb and delay applied; at these points it completely dominates the sound and calls to mind a thunderclap across a valley, again this is reminiscent of \u2018For all Tid\u2019 which used a similar technique. It\u2019s a good example of getting more from less. A particularly important quality if ambience and size are your aims on a relatively shoestring budget, both financially and in terms of knowhow. And that\u2019s the real story behind this album. A halfway descent rendering of black metal as it was in the mid-90s, maybe a little late to the party in terms of the sound that it is conjuring, but still way ahead of many at the time, or since that time for that matter. When it comes to artists like Behemoth, whose style went on to wildly diverge from their earlier ethos, I always like to imagine an alternative reality where they took a different path. But in this case, given everything we now know of Nergal as a shrewd businessman disguising himself as an artistic visionary, I\u2019m glad he stuck to impotently polishing the turd of tech-death as opposed to joining the chorus of artists in the early 2000s hell bent on gutting what was left of black metal at the time.\n\nBehemoth\u2019s debut is a pleasing piece of relaxing black metal with some genuinely well crafted moments, but it does not do enough to stand apart from the pack. One must also consider that quality output before and after from this artist was lacking, and hence one would be entitled to conclude that Behemoth had little interest in furthering this style beyond imitation, before gradually moulding their project into a successful business venture. \n\nOriginally published at Hate Meditations\n",
        "\nThe ongoing worldwide pandemic has taken a heavy toll on the music industry. With thousands of shows and festival cancelled or postponed, musicians have found themselves with a lot more time their hands. Many have returned to the studio and created something new. The Polish blackened death metal trio Behemoth are one such band. They have teamed up with Niklas Kvarforth (Shining, Skitliv) to bring you a cover of The Cure\u2019s \u2018A Forest\u2019. The EP also features to previously unreleased songs from the \u2018I Loved You At Your Darkest\u2019 recording sessions.\n\nI have to admit I am not that familiar with The Cure\u2019s music. I actually had to check out the original version of A Forest prior to this review. The Cure\u2019s original post-punk song isn\u2019t exactly cheerful but it\u2019s nowhere near as creepy as Behemoth\u2019s version. The eerie guitar work in the intro is enough to send chills down your spine. Orion really does a great job with the bass. Then there\u2019s Mr. Kvarforth\u2019s ghastly screams along with Nergal\u2019s growls. This is definitely not a gentle stroll in the woods. These are the sounds of someone lost in a forest running for his/her life. The live version is faster, more energetic but it loses some of the eerie atmosphere in process.\n\nThen we come to the two new songs. \u2018Shadows Ov Ea Cast Upon Golgotha\u2019 is a brutal piece of blackened death metal with harsh guitar riffs and varied pace. It is a decent song but it feels a little unrefined. I can see why they chose not to include on the last album. \u2018Evoe\u2019 is much more dynamic, well rounded and stronger in structure. Now this is the kind of Behemoth track that I was hoping to hear.\n\nOverall, \u2018A Forest\u2019 is a good addition to Behemoth\u2019s discography. They did a great job with the cover and the other songs are not without merit. I think that their fans will enjoy this release. I sure did.\n\nOriginally written for: https://valkyrianmusic.com/\n",
        "\nI won't say anything revealing when I\u2019ll say that Behemoth is a controversial band. For non-metalheads and for metalheads too. Some people love them to death and some people hate them. Also, the opinions on their music from actually every era are very divided. In the beginning I need to admit that I like their last full-lengths. I liked offensiveness of The Satanist and I Loved You at Your Darkest and even the strong rock elements of the latter. But I didn\u2019t think that after I Loved You at Your Darkest, the band will decide to release a\u2026 filler. An album that sounds unfinished and that consists only of an awful cover, live version of the same cover that sounds even worse and the rejected songs from the I Loved You at Your Darkest recording session.\n\nThe EP starts with the title track, which is a cover of The Cure\u2019s A Forest. First of all, why they decided to name their EP after a cover? Especially when it\u2019s not a cover album and the second half of it consists of their own material. But anyway, let\u2019s focus on the music. From the very first note I noticed that as in the original version the bass is amazing and is a main motive of the song, here it\u2019s\u2026 disturbing. But the instruments are at least listenable. The vocals aren\u2019t at all. It sounds like Nergal and Niklas tried to sound dark and mysterious and they failed. And it sounds like they even know that they are failing, but still they are trying all the time with the same effect always. All of these whispers and squeaks sound so pointless and don\u2019t fit the music at all. It also sounds like the vocalists thought \u201calright people, we don\u2019t have to try hard, you know how the song goes anyway, so sing it for yourself\u201d.\n\nAnd after this studio version ended, I thought that I won\u2019t hear anything worse here. And then the live version of the exact same song comes. Why the hell did they decide to put a live version of A Forest right after the studio version of it?! I really don\u2019t like listening to the same song 2 times in a row. Putting it as the last song of the EP would be a way better idea. But as in the studio version Nergal and Niklas were only trying to sing (and failing), here they are almost not focusing on singing at all, but they are focusing on warming the crowd. Really, we have more of \u201chey, hey, hey for the fucking demon!\u201d, \u201cUno, dos, tres, cuatro\u201d than of the actual singing, of the actual performing the song. What makes it even funnier, we don\u2019t hear the crowd very well. Oh, and let\u2019s don\u2019t forget about \u201cCome on you pussies, fuck you!\u201d. I am not against being vulgar on stage, but first - this doesn\u2019t fit The Cure\u2019s song at all and second - the way Niklas does it is just pathetic.\n\nThe second half of the EP are the rejected songs from the I Loved You at Your Darkest recording sessions. And I think that they both are\u2026 okay. They aren\u2019t anything special and it\u2019s not hard to say why they didn\u2019t make it to the album, but they are pretty pleasant to listen to - but nothing more. I can\u2019t say that they save this EP, cause the main song of it is a disaster and they are just okay. Both have some rock elements just as the whole I Loved You at Your Darkest album and some catchy melodies. But it\u2019s not anything new and anything great, only an interesting thing for the fans to get to know the songs that didn\u2019t make it to the last full-length. And with this thought I am coming to one big conclusion.\n\nI would be okay with the EP if it was just a \u201csmall\u201d addition to the discography, a compilation of rejected songs with some cover recorded for fun. I wouldn\u2019t even listen to it then since I am not a big Behemoth fan (I just like some of their music). But it\u2019s not a \u201csmall\u201d addition to the discography. It\u2019s a heavily advertised album that was released on 3 variants of vinyl, CD and a cassette. Also, the music video to the title track was recorded and there are shirt designs created connected to it. So, I was expecting an actual EP with lots of effort put in it. And what I got is a filler in the discography probably released to earn some money during the pandemic and advertised with phrases saying that it\u2019s \u201ca gift for fans during this hard time\u201d and that it\u2019s \u201cexactly what we need at the moment\u201d. No. What we need is good music that we would buy for ourselves (supporting the artists) with pleasure and not something I regret listening to many times digitally.\n\nA Forest is a pointless addition to Behemoth\u2019s discography that sounds unfinished and underdeveloped. It consists of: an awful The Cure\u2019s cover where the bass is disturbing and the vocals are unlistenable and doesn\u2019t fit the music at all, a live version of this cover where the vocalists are focusing on warming the crowd and screaming pathetic vulgar phrases way more than on singing and 2 rejected songs from Behemoth\u2019s last full-length\u2019s recording sessions that are average, but pleasant to listen to. But for sure they don\u2019t help the EP as a whole very much.\n\nOriginally written for Tony Blackthrasher on Instagram and Facebook and The Metal Observer.\n",
        "\nThe release of singles or EP's between full-lengths is a common practice in the music business, they not only serve as proof of life but are also a vehicle to attract some money, and that's just fine by me, as everyone needs to make a living. Behemoth's A Forest is one of those interim releases, consisting of two original songs orbiting around The Cure's cover (studio and live version). This track must have been relevant during Nergal's youth, or he simply thought it would have the attributes needed to give it a new, blackened outfit. I would say that the outcome of his impression of 1980's Robert Smith & Co song is artistically debatable, to say the least, much due to its somewhat sloppy interpretation. I understand Nergal meant to embed some organic, raw vibe into the song, but he took it a little too far. Both vocals seem to have been taken from two drunken teenagers and everything seems to have been carelessly recorded. \n\nOne could say that's the very purpose of this cover, and I accept that, yet if we overcome the subjective barricade, it seems clear to me that Nergal has failed to incorporate a layer of memorability into his personal impression, or at least failed to make it timeless, unlike brilliant covers such as Priest's 'The Green Manalishi (With the Two Pronged Crown)' or Sanctuary's 'White Rabbit'. Nevertheless, if I may, I will now turn my narrative upside down and imply that something without the ability to be magnificent or timeless can still have enough qualities to be enjoyed. And unlike many people out there, I will not include 'A Forest' among the worst cover songs of all time, nor will I stone Nergal when I run into him on the street. I'll just quietly place the track on my \"it should have been better\" shelf. I'm sorry, fellas, but I do love the song's chord progression. Yet not everything is wasteful in these nineteen minutes. If we move beyond the average 'Shadows ov Ea Cast Upon Golgotha', which is nothing more than an inferior version of 'If Crucifixion Was Not Enough', we come across 'Evoe', undoubtedly the EP's highlight. Its high-caliber pre-The Satanist riff is not only up to Behemoth's monstrous legacy, but also shows enough quality to have been included in I Loved You at Your Darkest. And it's moments like this that leave me hopeful for Nergal's creative future, as he will soon have the arduous task of reversing the somewhat uninspired cycle of recent years.\n\nOriginally written for www.sputnikmusic.com\n",
        "\nA million years ago, I found a lolcat of a cute orange kitten tilting its head at a perfect ninety-degree angle to the left with 'WHAT'S YOUR POINT?' written in huge white letters at the bottom. I never saved it, unfortunately, but if I had done so, I would be able to write a review of \"Live from Maida Vale\" by simply uploading that picture. This is a four-song release of Behemoth performing tunes from \"I Loved You at Your Darkest\" at a BBC Radio session. A competent enough release, I have to wonder a few things. First, why does Behemoth have so many live albums and such? Is the demand to hear live recordings of Behemoth really that high? Second, is the source material of \"I Loved You at Your Darkest\" stable enough to justify such a release? And the million-dollar question: what's the point?\n\nI think the answer to my second question is yes. I like the aforementioned follow-up to \"The Satanist.\" A meeker release compared to \"The Satanist,\" which I love and consider the band's best work, unpopular as that opinion may be, but sufficient nonetheless. \"Live from Maida Vale\" is live in a studio, but the same rules apply. Behemoth is no stranger to the live environment, and as such the songs are performed adequately. The sound quality is muddier than the source material; it provides a more organic way to experience these cuts. There is not much else going on besides that. Behemoth puts on a show, fifteen minutes pass, and that is that. I could have predicted Nergal does not throw out an improvised oboe solo during the bridge of \"Bartzabel,\" but you never know. These are strange times. \n\nBut maybe an improvised oboe solo would have this feel a little more than a pleasantry to be forgotten as soon as it ends. Maybe the spice of a mad crowd loving it would put on some beef. How about a deep cut from one of the older albums that is now itching for attention? Is it worth this much of an analysis? Depends on how much one values this kind of stuff, I suppose. This did not do much for me, clearly. \"Live from Maida Vale\" sounds as hollow as the studio in which they recorded this stuff. Capable enough, yet empty. Still, what is the point? And if you hate \"I Loved You at Your Darkest,\" you will obviously hate this, and I effectively just wasted a few minutes of your life. At least you can now search for a funny cat picture worth saving.\n",
        "\nSatanica is one of the most interesting on my take of Behemoth - for a multitude of reasons.\n\nSatanica is established as a markedly improved sonic and lyrical exploration by the band. They ditched the black metal soundscape they retained for many years before-hand. Sonically, more wickedly pummeling, and with more vocal push from Nergal's devoted performance in the formative years of Behemoth's millennium era sound from 1999 - 2009. Debatedly, and quite reasonably so, the death metal influenced sound they grew into is beyond what I believe a sole black metal sound could've brought them in the long run.\n\n\"Decade of Therion\" is a thunderous opening track with little soft welcome. Ambient abyssal background begins the track and leads to Nergal's vicious shouts, accompanied by over-driven and impending doom-like guitar riffs. The drums by Inferno as ever are swallowing and well presented in the mix.\n\nAlthough, a distinct factor for the mix is that certain passages sound muddied and more \"blood soaked\" - as if the production aimed for heavy, but came out being smudged. This resulted in a fleshy dirt covered mix. The bass is very, very underwhelming in places, and in some of the more \"rip and tear\" sections, barely audible at all. I'd say if the album had a different mix with a less emphasized drum focus, the bass may have been more audible.\n\nThe drums themselves sound a bit too muddled and combine with the rest of the soundscapes in an occasionally unflattering manner. However, that's not a constant issue and only crops up during the highest density of instrumental noise.\n\nThere are focused brutality tracks like \"LAM\" which all attention is on rattling your head (in a good way, obviously). The relieving thing about Behemoth songs intended to be heavy and nearly nothing else is that they are rather focused and consistent - they rarely stray from the goal. That's a very consistent structure and lends a hand in establishing a tone of an album.\n\nLAM, although fun and suffocating, is very straight forward. There are minor deviations in the song's soundscapes, but little else. LAM leads into one of my favorite tracks for the drum opening and electrifying guitar riffs that bolster the first section of the song.\n\n\"Ceremony of Shiva\" has the quirks and production style of the rest of the songs, but it has a more dynamic set of riffs, even melodies, to separate it from the first two tracks more distinctively. There is even distant clean singing present under the barbaric Nergal's screaming.\n\nSongs like \"The Sermon To The Hypocrites\" has a crushing, boggy, dark opening riff barrage that feels grudgingly evil. Right after the rancid riffs that open the track, the intensity loosens with more feather-footed drum patterns. The guitars lowly ring out for a moment with bending strings to elicit a muck-and-sludge covered crawl out of a swamp-like atmosphere. The track climbs back to a slightly more measured brutally, but shows no signs of losing ambition. The song twists playing off a few dynamic guitars and drumming, but never ventures far from the original structure.\n\nThe last track and one of their most well-known during live concerts is \"Chant for Eschaton 2000\". The track begins at the ending of the previous track's waning guitars with an instrumental shrug and lift, as if to hype the listener up for the last outing. Eschaton officially begins with building an atmosphere. This is backed by simple alternate picked high strings and Nergal repeatedly giving off a deep restless gruff. As Nergal gains volume, the drums work to pad out the sound with the bass. The bass can actually be heard quite well here helping build the atmosphere, but is soon pushed back to allow space for the rest of the instruments.\n\nThroughout the track, I can hear the bass guitar lingering under the drums and next to the guitars thudding away. This is a nice change and something I wished a different mixing allowed for the entire album. Nergal's vocals are low and gruff as ever with a more restrained expression. They are held back - more relaxed. It's akin to a chant more than anything. Multiple repetitive riffs travels throughout the song to keep up the established mood. Whales and gloomy shouts from Nergal can be heard throughout the latter half of the song.\n\nIt ends in this repetition with the primary instruments fading completely to leave a somewhat distant orchestral hymn - then the album officially ends. I won't count the bonus live tracks as core material.\n\nOverall the album is an interesting turn for Behemoth when they entered the new millennium. It established a new sound for them that brought droves of new fans. They managed to capitalize on the new sound for around a decade after Satanica's release.\n\nMy favorite songs on the release:\n\n- \"LAM\"\n- \"Ceremony of Shiva\"\n- \"The Sermon To The Hypocrites\"\n- \"The Alchemist's Dream\"\n",
        "\nAs a brief perusal of my review history would indicate, I've got a strong affinity for black metal. For that reason, my knowledge of Behemoth stagnated for many years with their 90s output - solid work, but hardly a quarter of the band's career output. In 2018, however, I decided to give some of their later material a shot. As it happened, I came upon the music video for their then-new single, \"Wolves ov Siberia\". The song hooked me, and I pre-ordered the album instantly. What I found was not just my favorite record of 2018, it was an album that helped reshape my notions of what extreme metal could be. \n\nThe first impression the record gives, of course, is its packaging. As any fan can attest, Behemoth in the 2010s have been no strangers to attractive art and design; The Satanist and Xi\u0105dz are proof positive. But with this album, the artists responsible have soundly outdone their predecessors. The liner notes feature dark recreations of classical religious paintings and images set against portraits of the band members in full ceremonial regalia, with the song lyrics neatly occupying the photos' negative space. The cover is even more impressive - behind a matte black slipcase featuring Behemoth's inverted triple-cross logo is perhaps the most aesthetically gorgeous cover art I've ever seen; it looks more like the Oxford edition of a gothic horror classic than the cover of a death metal album.\n\nAppropriate, then, that it's not a death metal album - not exactly, at least. The Satanist reintroduced black metal elements into Behemoth's sound in proportions unheard since Pandemonic Incantations or even Grom, but ILYAYD takes those elements and runs. The songwriting is diverse enough that one would be forgiven for not noticing that every song, save \"We Are the Next 1000 Years\", is in a variation of C# minor. \"God=Dog\", \"Sabbath Mater\" and the aforementioned \"1000 Years\" are perhaps the greatest examples, each flirting with black and death metal then taking a sharp turn into something a bit more experimental and - dare I say it - progressive. \n\nAdding to the impact of these incredible songs are some mind-numbingly good performances. Adam Darski's vocals are in top form, whether it's the pained scream that kicks off the first verse of \"Angelvs XIII\", the fittingly untrained cleans in \"Bartzabel\" or \"God=Dog\", or his absolutely inimitable growl, here even more intense and distinctive than ever before. Zbigniew Promi\u0144ski's drums have never sounded better, both in terms of production and performance; his parts manage to be virtuosic and chops-heavy without verging into the indulgent, and the excellent tuning and recording ensure that each note is clearly audible and impactful, no matter the speed or dynamic. And, though the bass guitar is not always easy to hear, when Tomasz Wr\u00f3blewski plays a more exposed part, it invariably elevates the song to stunning new heights.\n\nAs alluded to earlier, many of these performances feel like a natural progression from the musicianship and composition heard on The Satanist. But, where that album redefined Behemoth's sound after 10-plus years of relatively unassuming death metal, this one serves to refine and perfect that new direction, with plenty of new sounds introduced as well. One of the most satisfying and least expected of these seems to come from the same place as Darski's side project Me & That Man; that band's dark outlaw country stylings are echoed here in hypnotic, goth-Americana guitar melodies and stoner-metal licks that sound how the vast deserts of the American Southwest look. \n\nThough the comparisons to country music may end there, the hints at gothic rock do not. Some of the album's best moments come from arpeggiated rhythm guitars that recall early tunes by the Sisters of Mercy or Fields of the Nephilim (both bands that Darski, at least, is a known fan of). Perhaps the best example of this can be found in the standout track \"If Crucifixion Was Not Enough\", whose D-beat inspired verses give way to a driving and tension-filled chorus. Like most of the record's tracks, the song is punctuated too with well-researched and convincingly-delivered lyrics - lyrics that reformat all-too-familiar subjects like Satanism into something fresh and worth paying attention to. \n\nThat last point is well worth drawing out. I've read plenty of bad Satanist writing, and this ain't that. Yes, there's some posturing, and yes, there's some drama. But here, it's all built on a foundation of real theological knowledge. The Satanism preached on I Loved You At Your Darkest, really, is less about accepting Satan and more about rejecting Christ - and particularly the Catholic iteration thereof. Put simply, the band is candidly aware of what they're responding to. This shows in the language employed. Quotations from Marionite hymns and prayers abound, as do Biblical citations and references in English or Latin. But interwoven between them are countless blasphemies. Inversions of liturgical scripts, juxtapositions of pagan symbols against their Catholic opposites, and wholesale denunciations of holiness wave a banner against the tide of theonomy, one that is sure to resonate with apostates worldwide nearly as much as in the band's native Poland - a country marked by fervent religiosity in governance and public life, whose context is absolutely inextricable from a rounded understanding of the album's themes. \n\nIt is, in fact, this quality of the album that prevents its weaker moments from tarnishing the quality. Take for example the children's chorus heard in \"Solve\" and \"God=Dog\". On a lesser album by a lesser band, this symbolism would be hackneyed at best - the 'purity' of a child vs. the 'sin' of the words they sing. But by taking on this sociopolitical dimension, the album reorganizes this trite idea as not just a flagrant blasphemy, but also the ultimate rejection of a 'cultural Christianity' that indoctrinates children far too young to understand what they're pledging themselves to. The inverted Lord's Prayer that characterizes \"Havohej Pantocrator\" undergoes the same absolution, succeeding at what many artists have tried and failed to do by contextualizing a tired cliche with actual stakes - perverting a revered creed in a country that enforces its blasphemy laws, and thereby spitting in the eye of theocratic power. \n\nIn this way, I Loved You At Your Darkest is a truly great album in spite of itself; even its weakest moments are swept away by the grandeur of the work as a whole. Behemoth takes some flak from many in the metal community for their (relatively) mainstream take on black and death metal sounds, but I'd argue that that quality is no black mark on the band's authenticity; instead, it's a laudable marriage of sounds and styles obscure and familiar. The band has found a way to incorporate the most engaging elements of mainstream metal and the most engaging elements of the underground, and with I Loved You At Your Darkest they've synthesized them into an album that, if the world is just, will stand as not just the highlight of their career but as one of the best in the storied history of metal music.\n",
        "\nBehemoth get a lot of praise, but I find this to be a highly dull, over-cooked work without any soul. Every second of this thing is full of blasting riffs, technical and relentless drumming and shout-growl vocals that are at the forefront of all of it like a mainstream rock album, despite the album\u2019s obviously \u201ccult\u201d type of aesthetic \u2013 it really is a quite clear, accessible production for this type of music.\n\nEvery second is just full of noise and it gets tiresome after a while. They can get a good mechanical groove going, but that\u2019s basically all they do on here and it gets monotonous. There\u2019s never any moments where the music gets to really breathe, no riffs I could describe as particularly hooky or even compelling in a broad sense. The mood is \u201cevil\u201d in the sense that the band wants you to be impressed with how much they like Satan and also how much time they spent at the library, but it\u2019s a calculated, forced evil, focus grouped based on tropes dating back generations. I mean it\u2019s not the 80s where pearl-clutching church groups are your enemy anymore; we all \u201cget it\u201d by now. It\u2019s technical \u2018wow, check that part out\u2019 music for people into that, but you can find stuff that\u2019s more extreme, more technical or both if you spend a few minutes on the internet really, so this doesn\u2019t end up being tremendously exceptional in our current age.\n\nAll of it is very clean, very precise. It lacks the kind of spontaneity and savagery that I\u2019d like from rebellious kinds of music. Personally I find the ideas here banal and conservative, but I can't bash this solely based on my own personal taste without taking into account what it is. The songs are well-constructed and I don\u2019t get the idea that the band made any mistake with what they did here. I\u2019m sure if I had the will, I could go through all of this and pick out various instrumental moments of proficiency, some intriguing stylistic touches, and all of that; but really this whole thing is like a math test \u2013 it strikes with a purpose, but man, am I bored and would rather go home and do anything else.\n",
        "\nBehemoth have a now vast discography that spans a couple of genres, including hybridisations of. Given the attention that the albums subsequent to and including Demigod have received, it is quite easy to overlook their earlier black metal material, or simply never appreciate that Behemoth ever started this way (particularly the case for people newer to the band). That being said, the earlier catalogue of demos, extended plays, and full lengths provides a welcome variation (and change of pace, quite literally) from how Behemoth went on to develop, and there is undoubtedly an unrefined charm to the material that captures a Pagan essence that Graveland in particular initiated within at least Poland and presumably beyond.\n\nGrom, the focus here, is Behemoth's second full length, and develops upon the sound of Sventevith. Gone in some part are the pure mid-tempo black metal hymns with acoustic interludes, which are replaced with a faster-paced series of tracks underpinned by blasts. Nonetheless, the overall aesthetic here remains as black metal (from the production and guitar work through to the vocal execution), despite the observable beginnings of what would be further expanded in Pandaemonic Incantations and what followed thereafter that was in some cases almost pure death metal. The guitars offer some great riffing, and the odd solo creeps in usually towards the end of the tracks to provide a lick of flair to the full length. In numerous parts (e.g. Lasy Pomorza, and the title track), acoustic guitars are pulled up to the front of the mix, which roots Grom into the black metal style, all the while driving home the Pagan foundation that coherently and authentically justifies the title of the full length (that translates to Thunder in English). Indeed, the material here is thunderous.\n\nThere is a curious inclusion of female vocals here and also some 'clean' chants by Nergal (e.g. Rising Proudly Towards the Sky, and the title track), which are certainly unpolished and afford a rustic element to the material. The production is welcoming of this end, by itself presenting a raw and dynamic sound that provides a logical scope to include these female and 'clean' vocals. The keys that open Dragon's Lair are also relevant, though in Grom are more residual than they were in Sventevith.\n\nIn all, the material on Grom is very competent. There is significant coherency with the aesthetic and the sound, which allows the music to breathe and come into its own to good effect whilst not ever appearing redundant. The female and clean vocals may be an undesirable element for some. Regardless, Grom takes the good elements of Sventevith and brings in new styles that makes it a logical forward step that regrettably wouldn't be further explored at least directly (asides from some calcitrant relics within the expended play Bewitching the Pomerania). Grom has aged well, and serves as the cornerstone of Behemoth's earlier stages of existence when black metal reigned within the heart and mind of Nergal.\n",
        "\n\u201cMesse Noire: Live Satanist\u201d captures a Behemoth concert in Warsaw during the touring cycle for \u201cThe Satanist.\u201d The black mass shows the aforementioned album played in its entirety, such as it was during shows promoting \u201cThe Satanist,\u201d intermixed with other Behemoth classics. I have seen Behemoth live a few times myself, and \u201cMesse Noire\u201d shows the usual live experience: death metal, blast beats, spooky visuals, spooky costumes, flashing lights, mockeries of Catholic traditions (also spooky), Nergal in a pseudo-hoodie, and a departing reminder to hail the dark lord. Unless they capture a truly special moment, DVD releases like this are usually pointless. However, this was significant; the homecoming to Warsaw, not to mention Behemoth\u2019s resurgence after Nergal had recovered from leukemia and the return to form marked by \u201cThe Satanist,\u201d which was performed in its entirety during its support run. \n\n\u201cMesse Noire\u201d has an important semblance given its connotation, although this is hard to determine based on the performance. I am not kidding when I say this is exactly the typical Behemoth live experience. The visuals, costumes, stage effects, and general environment are carved so deeply in stone that it must be force of habit at this point. They are an excellent live band, of course; the show is enticing from start to finish. The performance from the extra show included here, recorded at Brutal Assault, seems to have more of a chip on its shoulder than the main attraction, interestingly. This is something that caught my attention, but this also could have been something I misinterpreted due to too many black masses. I\u2019m surprised I did not start hallucinating after watching over two hours of Behemoth performing live. But I did learn to speak Latin, so that\u2019s cool.\n\n\u201cThe Satanist\u201d is my favorite Behemoth album, so I feel fine with where the setlist stands, although I know I would skewer most bands for performing whole records in concert. The stream of the record adjusts well in the live setting, assisting the shows with a proper atmospheric ebb and flow. Hearing these tracks removed from the studio is also nice given the polished production of \u201cThe Satanist.\u201d I noticed bass lines and hooks that left a larger impression on me here; this helped to enrich the actual album upon returning to it. They all sound fantastic, especially \u201cMesse Noire\u201d and \u201cIn the Absence Ov Light.\u201d After \u201cThe Satanist,\u201d they throw in \u201cSlaves Shall Serve,\u201d \u201cConquer All,\u201d and a few others for good measure. \n\n\u201cPure Evil and Hate,\u201d the show\u2019s deepest cut, comes out of the clouds and rips hard. This one, along with the other tunes predating \u201cThe Satanist,\u201d is excluded from the live CD included with \u201cMesse Noire.\u201d Big mistake leaving it out; this is hands-down the finest moment from anything the DVD has to offer. \u201cMesse Noire,\u201d despite this minor gripe, is a substantial piece of Behemoth lore worth the price of admission. It embodies the essence of a live Behemoth performance at a special moment in time, bolstered by a diabolical atmosphere and entertaining spectacle, both worth their weight in gold. A fine testament to a fine chapter, I must say.\n\nThis review was written for: www.Thrashpit.com\n",
        "\nThis is the album I was hoping Behemoth would never make, and especially following up their two strongest releases, \u201cILYAYD\u201d was a total shock. From the song titles, to the aesthetics of the album, to the compositions themselves, this is \u201cBehemoth-by-the-numbers,\u201d a rehashing of many of their former albums in a stilted, uncomfortable package. It is a decadent \u201cresting-on-the-laurels\u201d in the worst possible way, a lazy release by some of the best musicians in the genre at present. And it is a true disappointment that is not simply a failure to live up to \u201cThe Satanist\u201d but the album is \u2013 and I hate to say this \u2013 almost a sell-out, an attempt to bring the Behemoth sound down to a formula. This is to say nothing of the awful means of promoting this release, which sees poet-laureate of the black/death masters Nergal degraded to a dog food salesman, an absolute travesty that one can only hope will be lived down in the same way Dio lived down his Budweiser commercial. The exact reasons for this album\u2019s disappointment will take some time to explain.\n\nFirst, one should not discount the context in which \u201cILYAYD\u201d was released \u2013 immediately following \u201cThe Satanist,\u201d which has widely (and rightly) been hailed as the highpoint of Behemoth\u2019s musical output, leaping to another mountain\u2019s peak would undoubtedly be a difficult feat in the first place. And while the band has not exactly changed that much \u2013 the line-up is exactly the same as it has been for some time \u2013 the ephemera surrounding \u201cThe Satanist\u201d may also be a factor in what occurred in \u201cILYAYD\u2019s\u201d creation. A sea of merchandise, three live albums (albeit, one being only a four-song Live EP), an EP, and relentless touring all surrounded \u201cThe Satanist.\u201d Moreover, Nergal himself was the object of much attention due to his recovery from cancer, which fans were certainly ecstatic for as was he. As such, following the masterpiece that was \u201cThe Satanist\u201d was an absolute mire of other events that may have impacted on the ability to allow the songwriting process to \"organically\" develop.\n\nWhile this is largely postulation on my part, there is certainly evidence on this release of a deep lack of focus compared to previous Behemoth albums, and even a relative lack of purpose considering how profound the return \u201cThe Satanist\u201d signaled was. In the first place, the exact elements that bring this album together as a cohesive whole are unclear almost immediately \u2013 the artwork, photography, song titles, and lyrics have very little relationship to each other aside from a loose overtone of blasphemy (recall the assertion that this was \u201cBehemoth\u2019s most blasphemous album yet\u201d \u2013 which is, itself, not even really true). The choice of album title, one that is certainly unusual, is unfortunately not given any significant thematic clarification through the course of the album\u2019s runtime either. From a strictly musical perspective, the lack of focus is quite evident by the intro and outro tracks \u2013 \u201cSolve\u201d and \u201cCoagula.\u201d While they ostensibly share some relationship, they end up being rather limp attempts at building atmosphere, an introduction and conclusion that are not only unclearly related to one another but that do not really flow in or out of the respective songs to which they are attached. When Behemoth has done intro-tracks/intro-sections previously, they have flowed effectively with the song to which they are adjoined: \u201cSlaying the Prophets of Isa\u201d is a natural continuation of \u201cRome, 64 C. E.,\u201d for example. \u201cSolve\u201d has nothing to do with \u201cWolves of Siberia;\u201d \u201cCoagula\u201d has nothing to do with \u201cWe Are the Next Thousand Years.\u201d\n\nThere are certainly some good tracks on here. Despite the absolutely awful title, \u201cGod=Dog\u201d is actually quite a solid Behemoth track \u2013 its sound evocative of \u201cThe Apostasy\u201d or \u201cDemigod\u201d in a positive sense. \u201cSabbath Mater\u201d is a great slice of mid-paced death metal with a truly fantastic vocal performance driving home the sensuous blasphemy (\u201cLove me orgasmically \u2013 Fuck me ecstatically!/Genetrix Meretrix, I pledge my heart to thee/I bow down devotedly\u201d). \u201cRom 5:18,\u201d despite how simple it is, might be the single best song on the album and is certainly one of my favorites from Behemoth in recent years \u2013 a straightforward, gloomily robust work, executed with conviction, that is also hindered by a brutally unremarkable song title (remarkable only in its perhaps deliberate allusions to Marduk). And again, \u201cAngelus XIII\u201d is a powerful, fast-paced track whose appellation is predictable, rather drab imagery from the dust-laden corners of the black/death realm. These laudable compositions aside, unfortunately, a fair deal of the content here is either dispensable (\u201cWolves of Siberia\u201d is a rather mediocre opener; \u201cIf Crucifixion Was Not Enough\u2026\u201d has very little that is memorable going on), or an outright disservice to the album (\u201cWe Are the Next 1000 Years\u201d is a painfully ho-hum closer that certainly does not help the album linger in the memory \u2013 why the album did not close with the actually quite ominous \u201cHavohej Pantocrator\u201d is beyond me). There were multiple songs on this album that I found myself, quite frankly, bored by - which has rarely happened during the run-time of other Behemoth releases. On essentially every other Behemoth album, even if an individual song is a low-point, its situation within the track-list and service to the pacing of this album usually compensate for its individual weakness. Behemoth albums are, as a rule, worth listening to front-to-back. Alas, I have to admit, here, that is not the case - on relistens, I skip over \"Wolves of Siberia;\" I skip over \"Bartzabel\" and \"If Crucifixion Was Not Enough...,\" and I most certainly skip over the last two tracks.\n\n\u201cILYAYD\u201d is quite simply an uninspired piece of work from one of the best bands currently working in the genre. The song titles give it away, the songwriting gives it away, and while the aesthetics of the album are interesting, their lack of relationship to each other also betray the uninspired nature of this release. There is, as usual, good material present here but it is far from elevating this album beyond its flaws. This is no \u201cCold Lake\u201d or \u201cIllud Divinum Insanus\u201d or \u201cIn Torment in Hell.\u201d Nonetheless, one cannot avoid the conclusion: this is without a doubt the worst album of Behemoth\u2019s career thus far. \u201cFrom the top of the highest mountain\u2026\u201d\n\n\n60%\n",
        "\nFollowing a mere year after \u201cSventevith,\u201d Behemoth\u2019s \u201cGrom\u201d displays an edging away from the bitter cold of the traditional Norwegian black metal sound, introducing some death metal sensibilities to the nascent Behemoth sound. Moreover, \u201cGrom\u201d introduces a more experimental approach to song structures, taking some notes perhaps from Satyricon\u2019s \u201cDark Medieval Times\u201d by the abrupt transition to atmospheric elements and non-buzzsaw instrumentals (see \"Dragon's Lair\" for a great example of this). Female vocals, Viking/warrior-esque chants, clean instrumental passages, shredding guitar leads, etc. all play into the crafting of a landscape on \u201cGrom,\u201d and the better quality of the production also signals the development that has occurred in the brief time between \u201cSventevith\u201d and this release. However, is this to the benefit of Behemoth\u2019s sound? Does \u201cGrom\u201d signal a surpassing of the debut full-length from these Polish (then-)youngsters?\n\nThe more expansive sound is clearly indicated on the opening track \u201cThe Dark Forest (Cast Me Your Spell),\u201d whose unnatural progression is also a fair indication of the album\u2019s overall inconsistency. We have furious blast beats, bass solos, guitar solos, female vocals, a groaning male clean vocal, meditative clean guitar work, etc. It\u2019s an absolute melodrama, overwhelming the listener with a smorgasbord of ideas. \u201cSpellcraft and Heathendom\u201d is the first real hint of death metal sensibilities, with several of the riffs not far off from Darkthrone\u2019s \u201cSoulside Journey\u201d or even Possessed, and while the vocal performance remains firmly rooted in black metal screams a fair deal of the song is reminiscent of early death metal. Perhaps the best song on the album, \u201cLasy Pomorza,\u201d reminds the listener of Mayhem in certain passages, a relentless piece that is driven by a massive drum performance, rolling toms somersaulting around a fairly straightforward tremolo-picked guitar, spiced with clean guitar undertones and driving bass. Again, the album\u2019s melodrama is on full display, an impassioned Nergal driving the musical stake into the listener\u2019s heart. \n\nAnd while the sound of \u201cGrom\u201d is undeniably epic, the multitude of ideas on this album never fully cohere. Moreover, several songs are fairly standard black metal that does not benefit from the less focused quality of the album. \u201cRising Proudly Towards the Sky\u201d and \u201cThou Shalt Forever Win\u201d sound almost like left-overs from the debut album, straightforward black metal cuts that lack the rather imaginative variety displayed in the song structures and pacing of \u201cThe Dark Forest\u201d and \u201cLasy Pomorza.\u201d Where they would have been at home in the skillfully executed Norwegian black metal sound of Behemoth\u2019s debut, here their unremarkable quality is highlighted by being positioned so late in an album that, by contrast, has been filled with a great deal of variety. Ultimately, \u201cGrom\u201d is far from a bad piece of work but it is certainly less enjoyable than \u201cSventevith.\u201d Where on the debut the Norweigan black metal style was evoked with a strong, captivating familiarity, \u201cGrom\u201d is a transitional piece, working out a few different styles and not necessarily capturing any one of them very well. Its inconsistency is obvious. While still undoubtedly a black metal album, there is an ambitious venturing into new territory present here that is not yet fully committed to any single direction. \n\n\n74%\n",
        "\nWith Behemoth today being one of the most successful black/death acts on the face of the planet, it is interesting to see the very uncertain roots from which this band sprang. Certainly, the frost-encased forests of Norway are a logical realm for the blasphemy-adoring Polish teenage Nergal to turn his eye to, but relistening to this album in 2019, one is shocked at just how bloody different Behemoth sounds on this record from what they are at present. Sure, one can hear, even on this early, early release, the penchant for relatively straightforward guitar parts layered with other instrumentation; the tendency for grandiose individualism in the lyrics; the sheer ambitiousness of the release at such a young age predicts the unfettered drive of later years. However, the black metal sensibilities betray no interest in death metal whatsoever; the lyrics on the whole are focused on fairly predictable forest-venturing and pagan-worshipping themes that presage no interest in Thelema; the album itself is following much more than it is leading. In short, there is no way that \u201cSventevith,\u201d on its own merits, could give someone an indication of what the band that made it would become: it is, at this point in Behemoth\u2019s history, an artifact. And this interesting piece \u201cfrom the dark past\u201d is just that: an artifact, that could not be more antiquated when considered relative to the leagues across which Behemoth have traversed musically in subsequent decades.\n\nOn first impression, the album\u2019s atmosphere is properly bewitching, and holds its own against the other excellent black metal acts coming out at this period (there are shades of Satyricon\u2019s \u201cThe Shadowthrone,\u201d or Ancient\u2019s \u201cSvartalvheim\u201d on this release). \u201cChant of the Eastern Lands\u201d is anchored by energetic, sweeping clean-guitar, blast beats and impassioned screams \u2013 a fitting opening to the album that progresses quite well into a more mournful middle section before returning to furious blast beats to end the track. Obvious stand-outs on the album are \u201cFrom the Pagan Vastlands\u201d and \u201cWolves Guard My Coffin\u201d \u2013 songs that are irregularly played up to the present. Certainly not every song is so excellent, and the experiment of layering acoustic/clean guitar over furious blasts and tremolo-picked buzzsaw riffs doesn\u2019t always work \u2013 while \u201cFrom the Pagan Vastlands\u201d is a great track, the acoustic guitars layered on this recording are more often distracting than not. This effect is put to much better use in songs like \u201cHidden in Fog,\u201d where the tone of the song is much more meditative in the first place.\n\nAnd while \u201cSventevith\u2019s\u201d atmosphere is easy to get immersed in \u2013 aided by some excellent instrumental tracks, fairly regular blankets of synth, and a few different sound effects (crows, wind, etc.) \u2013 it is not necessarily anything that is distinctive. The sound that this album evokes is a return to familiar, wintry territory for anyone who is a fan of Norweigan black metal, and is most enjoyable in that specific sense. And this strength, the effectiveness with which the soundscape is crafted, is also what \u201cSventevith\u201d perhaps suffers from most - it is ultimately a fairly generic release. Nergal\u2019s vocals are functional and unremarkable, and the overall tone of the \u201cSventevith\u2019s\u201d sound \u2013 from the production to the instrumentals \u2013 is similarly functional and unremarkable. The soundscape is done with precision, and some of the songs are, on their own merits, excellent compositions; but this is, ultimately, running with the pack, an evocation of the Norweigan sound. It is an above average black metal album from the 1990s that is competently written and performed, and where experimentation is present its success is mixed. Like some other bands that abandoned their early sound (Pink Floyd abandoning its \u201860\u2019s psychedelic roots comes to mind), the best thing Behemoth ever did was evolve away from their initial style. \u201cSventevith\u201d is an album well-worth revisiting, and once one gets over the initial shock of who composed it, is well-worth enjoying as a solid sequence of black metal conjurations.\n\n\n80%\n",
        "\nBehemoth is a famous blackened death metal band from Poland. I could compare their style to Nile, Morbid Angel and Krisiun. Only ''The Satanist'' was a bit different and more original. ''I Loved You At Your Darkest'' seems to be a failed continuation of ''The Satanist'' which was Behemoth's very big commercial success. Although I think ''The Satanist'' was quite overrated, it has few interesting moments such as ''Ora Pro Nobis Lucifer'' or ''Ben Sahar'' which are very memorable tracks and Inferno proved that he is one of the best black/death metal drummers who can play very fast and intense. Just check ''In the Absence ov Light''. \n\nIn general there are not many tracks here which are listenable, but I can divide this album into two parts. The first one begins with ''Solve'' which is an intro done by the children choir and it's something new for Behemoth. ''Wolves ov Siberia'' is quite decent song with some interesting riffs and fast tempo. The next track ''God = Dog'' is unexpectedly the best track on this album with very intense blasts done by Inferno and riffs similar to ''Wolves of Siberia''. Only the choir is quite unnecessary here, but let it be. Some moments of ''Ecclesia Diabolica Catholica'' sounds like a rock music, but it's even a memorable song. ''Bartzabel'' is a very good invocation to gods of war and it's very catchy track as well. Here ends ''the better'' side of ''ILYAYD\". \n\nWhen it comes to the second part I don't see a point in describing every song one after the other. Fusion of rock with black or death metal is very common nowadays and it's nothing wrong in it, but you have to know how to do it. Behemoth just failed with it. Moreover, the second part of this album lacks creativity and new ideas for music which make the second part of ''ILYAYD'' sounds very boring and forgettable. Behemoth rarely uses instrumental tracks but here ''Coagvla'' is an instrumental outro which finally ends this album.\n\nBefore the release of ''ILYAYD'' Nergal said it will be more blasphemous than ''The Satanist'' was, but it isn't. There is just a lot of hype around this album, but it's not really worth it. If you are into blackened death metal you should avoid ''ILYAYD'', because it's more a hard rock album with black/death metal image. Frequently such experiments are interesting, yet sometimes good, sometimes not. Here it's mediocre. The quality is certainly very good, but the music itself is very tiresome and forgettable.\n",
        "\nMost people have probably pieced together that I spend a lot of time covering the more \"popular\" bands in metal, and that's simply because I listen to way more stuff with established reputation than unknown obscurities. It's not necessarily because of some sort of internalized elitism, but mostly because after over a decade of actively reviewing I've come to find that undiscovered gems are like .1% of all undiscovered metal while the remaining 99.9% was forgotten for a reason. It's more a matter of pragmatism than anything else. I only have so much time to listen to music nowadays, I choose to listen to things that are proven to be good. Because despite my notoriety for trashing bad albums, I don't actually like listening to them because I'm not a fucking masochist.\n\nAnyway that small bit leads me to Behemoth, who is pretty much second only to Cannibal Corpse as the biggest extreme metal band of likely all time. The band, particularly Nergal as a celebrity, are fucking huge. Especially in their home country of Poland, the band has been put on trial for blasphemy charges, and Nergal himself is a bona fide celebrity, having high profile relationships with pop stars, acting as a judge on the Polish version of The Voice, and presumably sparking Beatlemania style riots when he announced his leukemia diagnosis. They're a big deal, is my point. So with those first two things in mind you'd figure I'd be all up on Behemoth's dick, but the weird thing is that throughout all my years as a metal fan, even getting into more extreme metal around the time Demigod came out, I've just never really been able to give too much of a shit about them. This time, I think the intersection of underground respectability and mainstream awareness just kinda missed the mark. Zos Kia Cultus has a handful of good songs and I remember liking both The Apostasy and The Satanist well enough, but everything else has always registered as not much more than a faceless blur of blastbeats.\n\nSo that brings us to I Loved You at Your Darkest, an album by a band that has captured the hearts of headbangers across the globe that I've just never cared too much for, but admittedly I was willing to give them another shot with this one based on the intriguing title and the fact that I remembered liking The Satanist from four years prior. That one was much darker and more brooding than their competent-but-unexciting barrages of non-riffs from the years previous, and I Loved You at Your Darkest here continues in a similar vein, but it feels more... I dunno, calculated, if that makes sense. I'm not sure how to explain it without sounding too tinfoily, but I get the feeling that Nergal and co. saw how successful The Satanist was (and don't get me wrong, it was a rare bona fide hit for a band of this style) and decided that their own personal celebrity and the comeback story of Nergal recovering from leukemia had nothing to do with it and it was all purely because they added in darker, slower, gloomier elements. Thus, they leaned into those once-tertiary elements super hard this time around\n\nAs a result, we're left with a black/death album that's pretty content to sit in a midpaced tempo and just fart about with spooky melodies and huck gothy arpeggios at you as often as possible. That's not to say the idea is dead on arrival, but it's hard for me to argue that the execution was flawless here, because even after a dozen or so spins I still just totally check out for almost the entire runtime. Batushka took the metal world by storm with chants and ecclesiastic bombast, but the only time similar idea here really works are in the huge preaching-to-the-undead-army breakdown in \"Havohej Pantocrator\" and the similar section utilizing a children's choir in \"God = Dog\". I'd say the chanting chorus in \"Bartzabel\" is a highlight as well but honestly I think it stands out more for being the most unabashedly \"churchy\" part of the album than it does for actually being super well written. \"Wolves ov Siberia\" kicks the album off on an old school Behemoth vibe with intense blasting and furious riffage (if not entirely memorable, which was always a problem for them), and then \"God = Dog\" more or less continues it with some more of the new elements integrated in, but after then the album pretty much drops it. There are moments of blasting intensity here and there but they're so few and far between that I can never remember where exactly they show up. \n\nThat's pretty much my main beef with I Loved You at Your Darkest, it's just kinda full of non-songs with a few standout moments here and there and that's pretty much it. I actually think \"God = Dog\" is probably the best song here because it's the one that blends their old school furious blasting death with their new school ecclesiastic seriousness. \"Angelvs XIII\" goes for the same thing with slightly less success (though the epic solo section near the end works really well) and \"Havohej Pantocrator\" just feels larger than life and kicks much more ass than it should, but that's about all I truly recommend. I still don't know how the last few songs sound, most of the middle tracks blur by as well, it's honestly just a weird album that feels like it's caught between two worlds while simultaneously sounding very confident in its own confusion. It's a very passive album and I feel like that really wasn't the intent, so I'm not sure how to feel about it. Something did compel me to return to this album fairly often, but even after all these months have passed I'm still not sure what that reason is, because there's nothing particularly grabbing here besides a few moments in particular. I wish I could explain it further than that but I really can't, it's just an album that barely happens, and it's hard to get excited about background noise.\n\n\nOriginally written for Lair of the Bastard\n",
        "\nThe metal community of these days can be splitted into two supergroups. On one side, we have those who appreciate innovations, originality and uniqueness when it comes to music, because, let's remember it, it's the music, the GOOD music that counts in the end, not the band's image or the adhesion to a model. On the other, we have the so-called \"purists\", people clinging so hard to the past and to a determined, sometimes obsolete, \"standard\" of music, that they literally can't see the forest for the trees. Looking to some of the reviews for this album, which, going straight to the point, is an excellent release to say the least, I'm starting to wonder which of the two sides are those listeners on.\n\nBy the way, Behemoth's leader, Nergal, is clearly the kind of guy that is blessed, at the same time, by an unmistakable musical genius, by self-confidence, and will to experiment, venture forth, break the boundaries, with the sole purpose of reaching new musical heights, to craft something beautiful and unique. The change in sound that Behemoth experimented with \"The Satanist\" was honestly like a breath of fresh air for the whole black metal scene, and resulted in the band's most ambitious, beautiful and successful output to date, and also one of my favourite albums of all times. \n\n\"I Loved You At Your Darkest\" isn't a record as instantly digestible as\"The Satanist\", but those willing to devote the due time to the listen of this masterpiece, will soon understand this is by no means a lesser copy of its predecessor. With \"I Loved You At Your Darkest\", Behemoth furtherly developed the elements that made the fortune of \"The Satanist\", expanding and maturing them, bringing us fourty-six minutes of sheer satanic ecstasy. The gothic rock influences typical of the previous album are still plain for everyone to see, just think to the melodic solos, the clean choral arrangements (see the chorus of \"Bartzabel\" or \"Sabbath Mater\", for example), the general atmosphere of the record, the usage of a lighter style of riffing, the production. \n\nNergal's vocals sound as natural as possible, yet as strong as ever: the overlayering is almost completely abandoned, save for a very restricted number of selected moments: still, he sings the beautifully and carefully written lyrics of the songs (full of references to religion, occultism and Satanism) with as much belief and strength as ever before. Speaking of the production, it sounds lighter, the guitars are still evil and crunchy, but less distorted, something that really fits the musical direction taken with this release; the riffing relies on tremolo picking, dissonances, usage of minor triads, and an increased availment of dissonant arpeggios. There are lots of acoustic and overdrived guitar sessions, something that really adds variety to the album and somehow contributes to its peculiarity: just think to the ending part of \"Ecclesia Diabolica Catholica\", or the whole \"Havohej Pantocrator\".\n\nOrion's bass grooves play a crucial role in exalting the guitar work, during the rhytmic sessions, but also while the guitars are playing their classic goth-rock solos. Inferno's drumming not only relies on his usual amount of demonic speed, aggression and brutal blast-beated sessions, not to mention his mastery of the double bass pedals, but also slows down in various songs or sessions, to accompany the instruments and serve the general atmospheric and evocative feel of the album, thus proving to be a polyhedral, versatile drummer.\n\nAs stated above, this new incarnation of Behemoth doesn't sacrifice the usual sheer brutality and aggression, but instead smooths it, to explore new frontiers of atmospheric, charming and experimental songwriting, and the band completely succeeds in doing so. Every song of the platter is top notch: there are no fillers to be found, each track has something beautiful to convey and it's well distinguished from the others, thus providing variety yet cohesion to the release, and incorporating new elements to the music, perfectly mastering and amalgamating them in Behemoth's new trademark sound. The use of classical instruments, like the trombone, the flute, the strings or the horns, a pleasant addition since the 2014's release, is still present here, and serves as a perfect example of what was stated above, adding epicity and importance to the mix.\n\nAnalyzing only certain highlights doesn't entirely make justice to the rest of the platter, but surely some songs deserve a special mention.\n\"Wolves of Siberia\" is a pure black metal blast of ferocity that starts off things really well, completely packed with minor chords, tremolo picking and neverending blast beat sessions; \"God=Dog\" is one of the most experimental tracks, starting off with an interesting, quasi-rock bass lick, to proceed with furious riffing and pounding drumming at an extremely fast tempo, and incorporating goth rock elements like the melodic solo, the clean choral voices and the children's choirs found also in the intro. \"Ecclesia Diabolica Catholica\" starts with a nice dissonant arpeggio, sticks to a mid tempo with a simple yet effective tremolo-picked riff for most of its duration, and ends with a great acoustic guitar sessions backed by blast beats towards the end. \"Angelus XIII\" is one of the most furious songs of the whole lot, while \"Havohej Pantocrator\" might as well be the best track, thanks to the fantastic strummed stanzas in minor chords played by the overdriven guitars, and to the thrilling crescendo towards the end, backed this time by distorted guitars and demonic vocals. \"We Are The Next 1000 Years\" closes the album in epic fashion, it includes an astounding ambient-sounding session with sampling, keyboards and classical instruments, and it's closely followed by the orchestral outro \"Coagvla\". What better way to end this fantastic work of art?\n\nReally, for the listener possessing an open mind, good musical taste and love for originality, this album is nothing less than an eargasm, and for the fans of Behemoth, especially those who loved \"The Satanist\", this is a must-have CD. Go out and get it now, this is one of those albums that deserve to be owned, enshrined and listened to in its physical version, and respected for what it is: a musical masterpiece.\n",
        "\nIt all starts with the oh so subtle calm intro that leads into heavy metal madness. Kinda, it actually reminds me of the intro to the band's same work in \"Slaves Shall Serve\" except replacing the demonic chanting with some softer more mellow clean guitar melody and a relaxed drum beat. This of course rapid fires into the heavy section with blast beats and a... not much heavier or dirtier guitar tone.\n\nIt's not an unusual song per se, but it is an odd choice for a promotional single coming from a hard hitting blackened death metal band, especially as promotion for an album that was bragged as something that would \"kill a million emo kids\" or something to that edgy effect. It doesn't hit hard, after Nergal delivers some of his usual growled vox we get a brief chanting section and the song delves back into a sort of noodle melodic section that heys broken up by repetitive brief blast beats, this part then comes up a bit later too, like a ballad of sorts but when it comes back we get a kid's choir playing call and response with Nergal's vox and melodic solo.\n\nThe kid's choir is honestly the most memorable thing here, and my favorite part of the song despite its cheesiness, but its just that, its cheesy and I'm not sure what effect it was supposed to add to the song. Perhaps hearing kids yell \"JESUS CHRIST\" was the band's attempt to try and reinvigorate their shock value? I honestly don't know, what I do know though is that I expected a hard hitting blackened death metal single and instead I'm finding a light weight gothic metal track. Behemoth sure tried to make the song dark, they just managed to find the wrong side of the dark metal pallet and certainly not the evil side of it they promised to deliver.\n",
        "\nI started following Nergal on social media a couple of years ago, the dude loves to preach constantly about how he matured and evolved over the years. I do not mind maturing nor evolving as long as its result is a better self. At first, I appreciated the continuous talk about evolving. Evolution and maturity reflected on The Satanist were the reason I started following him on first place. I was looking forward to experience how further their music has evolved in the new album. Little did I know, their music has evolved into a parody of The Satanist and they shamelessly tried capitalizing on its success. \n\nILAYD feels and sounds like it is an extended second disc of The Satanist that lacks the basic elements of blackened death metal or extreme music. Many of the songs sounded like they are trying their hardest to sound the way the previous album did, but fell short of that. Guitar riffs are mellow and far from being extreme and Inferno\u2019s performance sounds like Nergal has tied up his hands and feet to slow him down, but still manages to break loose every now and then. When he breaks loose, he plays those weird tom-toms in \u201cAngelvs XIII\" and \u201cSabbath Mater\u201d.\n\nIt all starts with an intro supposed to spook and creep the living hell out of you by kids reciting somewhat blasphemous lyrics. Quite the contrary, it was dull, boring and out of place. It sounded like a class reciting their forced and apathetic morning prayers. After the horrendous intro, comes the only decent song in the whole album \u201cWolves ov Siberia\u201d and it should not be THE decent song in a Behemoth album. \u201cWolves ov Siberia\u201d would have been my least favorite in any other Behemoth record, but here, it is the only song with consistently decent blackened death guitar riffs and drum line throughout the whole song. Then, boredom reigns on the rest of the album! Other than a couple of catchy choruses and riffs in \u201cBartzabel\u201d and \u201cHavohej Pantocrator\u201d, the songs are weak, forgettable, boring, and at times bothersome. Take the chorus on \u201cSabbath Mater\u201d for example. What is that? Is that supposed to create an atmosphere or something? It is just cringe worthy. On top of that, comes Nergal\u2019s mediocre vocals. You might blame it on his age or previous illness, but they definitely added insult to injury.\n\nOther than the theatrical display, there is nothing positive to mention. Artwork is dark and brilliant, and their video clips offered shock value and uniqueness that I am sure satisfied the band. They earned my 10% review rate from that and obviously made a few bucks with their art gallery displays.\n\nI have to admit, my mind has drifted away a few times while listening to the record because of the lack of originality and repetitive riffs. In order to judge the record properly I had to listen to the record multiple times, which made my experience worse. I am all for music evolution and maturity, and I know musicians need to make money and attract new audience. Not this way, this is a cheap way to do so. This is not a revolutionary album, but a dark moment in the band's history.\n",
        "\nHere is it, I Loved You at Your Darkest.\n\nBehemoth released The Satanist in the year 2014, and it had capable songwriting, fantastic production, and impressive emotional resonance from its sometimes overwhelming instrumental blasting. Nergal had, in my opinion, captured the best vocal performance he has ever produced. The next four years were like any other average wait for the next metal album, but it was fruitful with live performances from Behemoth, including impressive releases from many other bands in the metal genre.\n\nI Loved You at Your Darkest begins with \"Solve\", a track that shows Behemoth introducing a strange (for them), although structurally generic opening track. It has a children's choir reciting a few lines over and over until the end of the track. Does this subtract from the rest of the music? No. Further in, Behemoth begins to utilize the same guitar tone, tuning, and stylized playing we have heard on The Satanist. This type of playing has become their mainstay sound and it doesn't subtract from the music because of how they use it to craft atmospheres of punctuality. Besides, repetition is not inherently negative.\n\n\"Wolves Ov Siberia\" is the first full track and comes in with power. The song begins with a rather expected (but not bad) drum pattern, then breaking into a few darkened guitar passages. This track is quite enjoyable due to simplicity and the rather punchy mixing layered in here. The guitars are the most pronounced thing along with the drums, as the bass takes a backseat as it did on The Satanist.\n\n\"God = Dog\" is a strange track at first glance mostly due to the name. However, moving into the music content Behemoth shows immediately the newer elements they've added to the blackened death style. A higher focus on choir support and Nergal goes even further into the realm of raw and gargling aggressor. His vocals are more strained in tone and seem to be thrown with more attack than usual in the past five years.\n\nI must praise the album for it's even higher production value than The Satanist, which I didn't think would've been likely. The guitar, drums and even the bass (which doesn't get too much attention, sadly) sounds beautiful. They are bright, burning and full of life. The first song to jump out at me was \"Bartzabel\", and this song is somewhat unique concerning Behemoth. I haven't cracked open every album by Behemoth (specifically their 90s material). They have dabbled into higher melody and cast a darker tone in the track with a melodic approach. \"Bartzabel\" is simply beautiful to listen to, production-wise. The lyrics \"Come unto me, Bartzabel\" is quite hypnotizing in delivery, and really helps send this more melody inclined song to greater heights.\n\nAnother track that stands out is \"Angelvs XIII\", which has a few surprising elements. The intro to the track is quite malicious. Nergal experiments a bit with his newer vocal style, gagging as usual with introduced cackling and even some of the mild yells he'd give during concerts from recent tours. There is an acoustic guitar section and it's quite effective at layering out the change in direction in the song, leading to the next track. It's not a massive change, but it's certainly not to be ignored, nor dismissed.\n\n\"Sabbath Mater\" is on the level and caliber as the first few tracks, with the notable exception of an interestingly included choir section that supports Nergal's vocals. It's actually quite hard to tell, at least to me, if it's Nergal's vocals. They are generally appealing nonetheless.\n\n\"Havoheh Pantocrator\" is a song that is quite gorgeous in pacing. It opens slowly with a clean guitar strummed chord and rises. It includes other instruments and a rolling drum piece. After the introduction, it kicks into things but never gets as intense as the other songs on the album (Bartzabel being the other track of lower ferocity). There is what sounds like a sub-prominent acoustic strum present underneath the rest of the instruments. Although, this is removed as the song does intensify up near the middle and keeps most of the pace acquired until the very end.\n\n\"Rom 5:8\" and \"We Are the Next 1,000 Years\" have above-average Behemoth artistry, but nothing immensely different or game-changing. They both contain music that flows and keeps pace, with enjoyable riffs and strummed guitar parts, including some satisfying tremolo picked guitars.\n\nThe album closes out with one of the most straight forward outro tracks I think Behemoth has done. It's not trying to achieve a magnificent closer like \"O Father O Satan O Sun\", nor does it end like Evangelion with a dynamic change in sound \"Lucifer\". I am disappointed by this as I expected something more at the end. Something of true glory or hellish soundscape. Neither of those desires are met and the closer sees to it to be rather boring, truthfully.\n\nI Loved You at Your Darkest is not the magnificent affair The Satanist was, but I do believe it is good, if not somewhat diminished. However, to top The Satanist was no easy feat, and if they had it would be most surprising. I find a decent amount of enjoyment from this entire package; the songs, the composition, the instruments, and vocals.\n\nFavorite tracks:\n- \"Wolves Ov Siberia\"\n- \"Bartzabel\"\n- \"Angelvs XIII\"\n- \"Havohej Pantocrator\"\n\nLeast favorite tracks:\n- \"Solve\"\n- \"Coagvla\"\n",
        "\nI feel a need to come clean with this record - more than I would like to, at that. When it comes to Behemoth, I very much was familiar with them for what they represented, prior to having first heard them. I had convictions that told me to ignore them, to not hear what they would offer, for god knows why, and yet... I could almost hear a warcry, a sounding of horns when the release of \"The Satanist\" came to pass. I'm willing to admit that, in fact, \"The Satanist\" was the first album that I had ever heard from this band... and I loved it. Unlike any album before it, I adored it with burning passion, a passion alone that still lingers as I write this review. I came to learn the events leading to this album - Nergal's bout with leukemia, and the five year wait that ensued with it - and, in a way, I came to understand that, indeed, \"The Satanist\" was as much a personal adventure for them as it would become for us. I feel that, in a way, this factor alone is what made that album a monumental success.\n\nI know, you're gonna ask: Well, why spend a whole paragraph telling us about your experiences with \"The Satanist\" instead of this album? Why tell us these things? In reality, I'm telling you this solely because I feel there's an irony to it all. In a way, this album is its own microcosm compared. We came together and, in fact, loved Behemoth at their darkest, as they would release a firestorm across the world. A firestorm massive enough to shadow all that came before it. It's an irony that, in hindsight, is almost comedic, as this album feels like the complete antithesis of all that had come before it; a thunderous clap followed by silence. This album's a depressing borefest for me... one of which took me by surprise at first, but not of which I didn't fear.\n\nWhere to start... well, why not the sound itself? Inherently speaking, it isn't at all abhorrent. In fact, I actually quite like how the album sounds. The instruments on their own are perhaps the cleanest they've ever been... and after having to deal with the distorted drums of \"The Satanist\", it's perhaps the most pleasant thing about this album. I hope the two guys that mixed and mastered, Matt Hyde and Tom Baker, are proud of their work on this album, as it is a stellar step forward, and a welcome one. The way these instruments work in conjunction together is simply... unparalleled, compared to what Behemoth has released before it.\n\nIt's a lot to praise the master, and I'm aware that such a notion probably isn't fair if I'm writing a negative review... but it's important to consider, when these aspects have to produce a payoff. One may ask, what's the payoff? Well, not a lot, you can be damn sure! This album has momentum issues up its ass! It legitimately felt as though Behemoth had no idea how to pace this album... and the intro song itself, \"Solve\", almost perfectly exemplifies that on its own. Hell, most the short track lengths do better work for it than anything else. But \"Solve\" feels like a special case to me, as... it's been a while since Behemoth has really done a track like it. If my memory serves me, I believe the last one we saw was on \"The Apostasy\", in the form of \"Rome 64 C.E.\". In a way, the real point of intro tracks like this is to help the listener identify the general sound of the album their about to listen to, or even build a momentum that the album is able to carry throughout. In this case, \"Rome 64 C.E.\" has a better grasp, because... in the end, it knows what it is. A song that sets a mood in the starting seconds, and the sound to follow shortly after. A dynamic and bombastic soliloquy, quite similar to a numerous amount of albums preceding it and coming after it. Meanwhile, \"Solve\" doesn't feel like it really means to identify the sound at all. It's a somber build to a heavier sound, but the direction isn't interesting enough. The momentum to it just simply doesn't seem to exist.\n\nMoving forward from that, the album itself almost scarily has music that sounds like it would better belong on an extended edition of \"The Satanist\". Most of the songs have a sound that feels as if it wishes to mimic the things people liked. You can tell that, too - half the time, on the faster, heavier songs, the guitarwork sounds like something straight out of \"Furor Divinus\". The drums as well have a similar issue... and yeah, maybe going to make that accusation isn't fair, but it's a glaring fact. This album feels as though Behemoth took the success of \"The Satanist\" and said, \"...well, alright. Let's just make more of it. People will love it, right? It's not like we can top The Satanist. Guess we shouldn't even try to, let's just throw away our originality and cash in on this album!\"\n\nIn the end, this album takes as many steps back as it tries to take forward. It's a sad notion, in my eyes. If Behemoth could move forward with the sound of this album, but bring back the momentum, the driving force that made the albums before it feel impassioned and good, I feel as though we would have another great record on our hands. Hell, they have all the right elements in place! The sound is good, the crew to master and mix it is good, they just need the spark to make it work. Honestly, it's almost disappointing that I have to say that I despise this record in such a way, but... fuck, man, there's not a lot of good here. For an album that I had placed all my hopes in, for an album I hoped would be fantastic... it's a drag. It's boring. It's not original. It's just Behemoth.\n\nMaybe we need something more than just \"Behemoth\" these days.\n",
        "\nThe name Behemoth is tightly associated with Blackened Death Metal and with anti-Christian motifs, as well as shockingly contentious music videos. The front man and the mastermind, Adam Micha\u0142 Darski (also and more recognizably known as Nergal), has made sure that the image we get from the band concurs with this association. However, behind this evil and vile projection, there is another side, the more down-to-earth side, where Ryan Gosling is as influential in making an album as is Satan. \n\nThe new output by this Polish extreme metal trio, I Loved You at Your Darkest, is partly old-school, signature Behemoth that we have known for long and partly the new, more rock-influenced trend the band wishes to seek. Nonetheless, the dominant sound of the album is the looming, ferocious and macabre ambience, with several ritualistic sections and dark, sacrilegious, myth-imbued lyrics. \n\nThe album opens with a choir of (church) children, singing in unison and depriving gods from their forgiveness. This choir, which will be infused on another track (God=Dog) later on, is where Ryan Gosling kicks in, not himself of course, but his footprint. As Nergal mentioned in an interview with exclaim!, he got this idea from Gosling\u2019s musical project Dead Man's Bones and then he \u201cdecided to bring it even further \u2026 to extremity\u201d.\n\nThis might be seen as a drawback for such an album and within such a morbid genre; but considering the fact that the band intends to signpost their shift towards a more rock-ish sound, this frequent integration of children\u2019s choir, along with other factors, such as drumming, implies this new tendency. \n\nOther than this slight yet noteworthy alteration which can be observed on a track like God=Dog (especially its opening), everything else remains just as epic and monumental as it was. Different songs have their musical nuances, from more raw black metal (Wolves Ov Siberaia) to post-metal / post-black metal (Havohej Pantocrator) to atmospheric/ambient black metal (We Are the Next 1000 Years) and everything in between. We have machine-gun drumming (e.g. Angelvs XIII), ritualistic sections (Bartzabel), fast paced riffing (Wolves Ov Siberia) and guitar solos too (Sabbath Mater).\n\nLyrics-wise, the same-old imagery of demon-angel dichotomy, profanity and demonological figures permeate the album with influences from mythologies of around the globe, and there is even one particular song with a demonic invocation chorus (Bartzabel). Not that this thematic sameness is a disadvantage, no, not in the least bit; quite contrary, these are the themes that suit the image and the music of the band, and this is what most fans admire them for. Even some seemingly arbitrary Latin phrases or Old English words here and there (e.g. Ecclesia Diabolica Catholica) can add to the richness of this auditory experience and are more than a show-off of Nergal\u2019s one-year course in Latin in the University of Gda\u0144sk. \n\nAt the end of the day, this album is a full-flavored extreme metal dish that can reach out to fans of all inclinations and can satisfy their need for a well-produced major album and at the same time, tempt some new listeners with its new, more accessible sound into giving it a try.\n\n\nRating:\nLyrics: 8.0\nArtwork: 8.0\nMusicianship: 8.5\nVocals: 8.5\nOverall: 8.5\n",
        "\nIt\u2019s been four years since the Polish blackened death metal horde unleashed their masterpiece \u2018The Satanist\u2019 onto the world. Now they have returned with a new, long-awaited full length release entitled \u2018I Loved You at Your Darkest\u2019. I absolutely adored their previous opus so I have high hopes for this\u2026\n\nAs far as themes go, this album offers the usual array of topics present in Behemoth\u2019s music, including: Satanism, the occult, critical views on Christianity, particularly Catholicism. One new addition is the reference to alchemy on the opening and closing tracks aptly named \u2018Solve\u2019 and \u2018Coagvla\u2019.\n\nThe children\u2019s chanting at the start of the first track \u2018Solve\u2019 gets a little irritating after a few seconds. I was relieved to hear the guitars reminding me that this is in fact an intro to a Behemoth album and not to some children\u2019s choir. \u2018Wolves Ov Siberia\u2019 is a savage beast of a song with packed with aggressive, coarse guitar riffs, Nergal\u2019s bleak shouts and Inferno\u2019s relentless drumming. It sounds as harsh and bleak as a Siberian winter. \u2018God = Dog\u2019 is more complex and melodic than its predecessor and it features some progressive tones in the guitars. It has the hallmarks of a classic Behemoth track, including the eerie atmosphere, aggressive yet melodic guitars and powerful vocals. The one thing that I could have done without is the children\u2019s choir which essentially continues from where it left off in the intro.\n\nOddly enough one of the slower tracks, the gloomy sounding \u2018Bartzabel\u2019, has quickly become one of my favorite songs on here. I can\u2019t get enough of that eerie mid-tempo groove guitar in the chorus and Nergal\u2019s haunting vocals. The rest of the album varies in pace depending on the song ranging from the fast and abrasive black metal on \u2018Sabbath Mater\u2019 to the slower, more melodic \u2018Havohej Pantocrator\u2019.\n\nIn summary, \u2018I Loved You at Your Darkest\u2019 is very different from its predecessor \u2018The Satanist\u2019. Parts of it reminded me of Behemoth\u2019s black metal era while others show the band\u2019s willingness to experiment with some new styles. It is not the easiest of albums to listen to, and it requires a lot of patience from the listener. But rest assured, patience will be rewarded.\n\nOriginally written for https://valkyrianmusic.com/\n",
        "\nBehemoth has been a staple in my metal diet since their release of Demigod and it only got more regular with the release of The Apostasy and Evangelion. From there I had a wealth of great blackened death history to explore and enjoy. The Satanist was a bit of a let down for me but it could have been much worse and I was dreading their next would follow suit. Unfortunately, I Loved You at Your Darkest is the album I was dreading. It's a progressive successor to their previous album, exemplifying the tonal shifts made on that last release. That being said, this is a very sad album. Even sadder than The Satanist in many ways yet still feeling dry. I was hesitant with the terribly named single \"God=Dog\" that was equally terrible (More on that later). Once \"Wolves ov Siberia\" dropped, I felt a little more confidence in getting a killer album, even though it was a little bland. It would always be a challenge to continuously release such amazing material like they've done for 10 full-lengths and eventually they would have to falter. Some of my nightmares were realized this day.\n\nThis is album produced a conundrum within me on the basis that 50% of it is quite boring, 25% of it is an obvious attempt to grab more mainstream listeners from the upper echelon (Lower?) of metalheads and the other 25% consists of bucking death metal and writing more of a blackened heavy rock/metal, if you will. It's experimental for this band, something they started on the previous release, but it is utilized more here and of which I am not a fan. These sections have a slower tempo, simpler drums, segmented chords, and a generally more groovy feel. Listen to the aforementioned \"God=Dog\", \"Bartzabel\", and \"Rom 5:8\" for an immediate example. I might enjoy this from another band, but we're getting cheated on the Behemoth of old that can write blistering blackened death complete with unique instrumental progressions and dare I say, catchy vocal patterns (This release does have a few here-and-there). This leaves me running to the comfort of songs like track 2, 4, 9, or 11 but to be left with raw Behemoth moments that have little character or real meat to bite into. There is a great rhyme in \"Sabbath Mater\" that goes \"Love me orgasmically. Fuck me estatically\". I like when death/black metal bands put in the effort to rhyme, which Nergak used to do more regularly. Now keep in mind that all this is coming from someone who really appreciated Songs of Love and Death, even though most of it can be traced to a particular folk/americana singer/song-writers due to the heavy imitation.\n\nNergal's vocals doesn't skip a single beat here. He lends his very unique voice to belt out screams of pure and concentrated evil. It's one of the real comforts I found in this album. If you didn't like the borderline clean singing in The Satanist then you will be further displeased here. I hate the kid gang vocals copy/pasted twice, once in \"Solve\" and once in \"God=Dog\". No, not a children's choir, that usually ups the evil in black metal. No, I mean gang vocals from kids. It was awkward in the video they released for it, and is still awkward here. The lead guitar yet again is left many times to ring random off-notes over the top of the song. There are a few solos that are unique, with an odd ball hair metal solo in \"Bartzabel\" and an overall great one in \"Ecclesia Diabolica Catholica\". The drums are fine enough for what is going on. They're more groovy than in any other release which fits the lighter feel to this album. Remember in Blessed are the Sick on the track \"The Ancient Ones\"? Well when it opens with a couple high rack tom notes I thought it was just straight silly the sound of them (more specifically I am talking about the original recording for their demo Abominations of Desolation as \"Azagthoth\"). Well guess what? The comically high toms are here and used 5 times through the release. 4 out of the 5 times it is the same high-low roll and stuck out like a sore thumb. The bass is very important on this release, and possibly more so than any other album. It has a chance to really weep in the background while the guitars mess around up high. A lot of the emotion is translated via the bass, which I like.\n\nHonestly, it seems like Behemoth isn't good at being Behemoth anymore. I mean that in all honesty. Whenever they write a more traditional composition it's bland and boring. The only way they can make their songs stick out and be interesting is when they incorporate someone else's vocals, or trumpets, or completely change their sound to something more approachable and accessible. Pretty please, can the old Behemoth come out to play?\n\nFavorite tracks:\n--Bartzabel\n--Sabbath Mater\n--Wolves of Siberia\n\nTechnical skill: 58% Originality: 61% Song writing: 41% Production: 70% Accessibility: 68%\n",
        "\nBehemoth stopped being relevant in the underground years ago; thanks to the good marketing skills of their leader Nergal that converted the band into a very good company. Changing styles constantly has always been another particular aspect of the band, starting with a traditional black metal proposal and morphing into a heavier and more brutal blackened death metal act a few albums later, which I consider a fine move since they managed to release memorable and intense music in both genres. Their previous album \u201cThe Satanist\u201d (2014) shows the same theatrical and symphonic feel featured here but definitely had an extreme element in the percussion and some of the riffs. For this album, \u201cI Loved You At Your Darkest\u201d (2018) they used some of that intriguing and obscure elements as well but there\u2019s no violence or aggression whatsoever. The children choir at the beginning of the album for example is kind of chilling and dark but in a goth rock way, not very black metal.\n\nThe visual work behind the album concept, the pictures, the live performance, the music videos and the lyrics; I admit everything has a high aesthetic value but I feel it looks and sounds way too much like a darker version of Ghost. Musically, the composition and arrangements are probably also one step closer to the narrative style that Nergal wants but they also sacrificed the little relation they had left with extreme metal. The first couple of tracks involve aggressive percussion in some sections, tupa-tupa beats mainly and a couple of bars of blast beats but the sense of melody shows there\u2019s a conflict between the belligerent nature of extreme metal and the delicate concept of the album. This failure is materialized in track 4 \u201cEcclesia Diabolica Catholica\u201d, that\u2019s exactly where things started going wrong. The nostalgic and sad arpeggios at the beginning of the song remind me more of radio friendly bands like Evanescence or HIM, the mid paced drums that accompany through the rest of the song are extremely boring and flat and the ecclesiastical choruses are absolutely vomitive, I felt I was in church. The rest of the album follows exactly the same formula.\n\nThe composition talent behind this piece of music is undeniable, what bothers me most is the intention to brand this as \u201cwagnerian black metal\u201d when there\u2019s nothing or little of resemblance between this and the old Behemoth or even the genre\u2019s raw and truly evil roots at all. There are a number of other contemporary acts like Bathuska or Cult Of Luna that tried to attempt something similar but remained true to the canons of black metal, with a fair share of blast beats, high tempos and low tuning; not of that featured in this album. The vocals are also lacking a lot of attitude and potency, you can blame Nergal\u2019s age for that. The production of the album is top notch as you can expect, the symphonic arrangements and samples are intelligently placed in the mix to generate impact and impress but the riffing is pretty weak and the harmonies and scales used this time took the extreme metal part away from the band\u2019s sound, leaving room just for the obscure but indigestible solemn and delicate ceremony-like tones.\n",
        "\nAfter ten albums, almost all high-level, culminated with the excellent last four works, acclaimed by fans and critics, it was a difficult mission even for a band like Behemoth to create a new album that was close to the level of precedents and that also gave a breath of freshness. Well, for Nergal and his companions the mission has largely failed miserably. Already with the first two singles the hype for ILYAYD had lowered, but the release of the third single Bartzabel two days after the release of the album, some hope for another good work was rekindled.\n\nThe eleventh effort of the Poles opens with the intro Solve, in which immediately appears a chorus of children which praises a religious song (the same as the first single God = Dog): if in the intro the chorus (quite annoying in the long run) can be accepted as an introduction to the album, in the single it appears totally out of place and the repetitiveness of the riffs does not help to make God=Dog better. The recycling of riffs is a constant in this full length and this can be seen in many other songs (Wolves of Siberia and We Are The Next 1000 Years, two songs that are almost identical in the initial part) and this greatly lowers the rating of the album. There is no lack of convincing episodes: Ecclesia Diabolica Catholica, a very dynamic song with a heavy rhythmic base, a fast solo and a beautiful acoustic part; the highly unusual but effective Bartzabel with a very catchy and melodic refrain that alternates with very powerful deadlifts. However, they aren't absolute masterpieces, but only good tracks that stand out easily in the midst of the many banalities of this album.\n\nSumming up, ILYAYD certainly has the advantage of being very sliding and also give a fairly pleasant listening, but the drop in inspiration is seen (or rather, is heard) because of the continuous repetition of riffs, always too similar to each other, and certainly represents a step back from the last albums.\n\nNow, however, I would like to focus on the title: \"I loved you at your darkest\". A rather strange title compared to those who have used the band in the past. It is possible that it was not a coincidence and that there is a meaning behind the title. Even Nergal and the others will have noticed in the studio of the creative decline occurred in recent years? So, we fans, have we to continue to love Behemoth at their darkest?\n",
        "\nI've been waiting to get my hands on this one. Riding the heels of Behemoth's 2014 LP The Satanist is no simple feat. It's not the best Behemoth album in the world, nor is it my favorite. As a matter of fact, Zos Kia Cultus (Here and Beyond) sits atop the pedestal for me with its devilish brazenness, occult-like virulent nature, and vicious fiery brutality. There's an organic quality in that album that draws me in more than the others. Evangelion had it, too. In fact, I think Behemoth is at their best when they're not compressing the hell out of their sound to try and be as Earth-shatteringly loud as possible.\n\nIn enters the first confirmed single from the Poles' upcoming offering, I Loved You At Your Darkest. Nergal has made no secret that The Satanist was a passion for him. As an artist, a musician, songwwriter, and defacer of Bibles, he took great pride in that album. So much so that only a couple years after it came out, the band was already doing tours around it. Now I don't just mean they were promoting the album as they were touring because that's standard procedure for a band to do: tour to gather enough hype for the newest song or album. I mean they were playing full sets of nothing but The Satanist. It was nuts to hear how an album only a couple of years old was being played in full in big venues. \n\nNow I feared this new song wasn't going to live up to anywhere near the monumental status that the single from their last LP garnered. That whole album is in a league all on its own at this point, deservedly or underservedly, depending on who you ask. And as a standalone track distinct from the rest of the album, it's okay. Merely okay.\n\nThere's no special tricks that the band pull from their arsenal here. It's more or less a side-B from The Satanist, merely dressed up to be made a little less posh. You've got the typical trademarks of your black/death metal Behemoth has become well known for: dissonant chord progressions, occasional tremolo picked riffs, progressive and fast drumming patterns that blast frequently, the punchy bass lines that give a necessary low-end in the clean production, and the fiery vocal performance from frontman Nergal. The problem is that it lacks the epic, anthemic, soul crushing grandiose blasphemies of the last album. Also, I don't think this means anything, but this is the second black metal song (of course this isn't strictly black metal, but it falls under that umbrella and Behemoth is more associated with black metal thanks to their early material) that has children in it performing vocals. I don't know if this is going to be a trend in black metal circles with bands using children in their songs, but I don't think that'll happen. I sure hope not because children are not good singers, nor are they very enthusiastic singers, so this just felt unnecessarily tacked on.\n\nMaybe the success and subsequent inflation of The Satanist hindered the impact of this song because it's nowhere near as large in scale. Looking at the song as a separate entity, it's not all that bad and has its replay value, but I'll wait for the full album to determine whether or not it works in the full context of the album. Maybe then I'll rate the song higher, but as it stands, it's pretty typical Satanist-era Behemoth, just kinda...on a diet.\n",
        "\nBehemoth's \"The Satanist\" may as well be considered their so-far masterpiece. Crytics all over the world have praised the album for being original, inspired and definitely excellent; personally, I totally agree: The Satanist is the best blackend death metal record of the decade. It even went gold in Poland. That's saying something. Now, off to review.\n\nNergal decided to abandon the multi-layered vocals typical of Behemoth's previous albums (think to \"The Apostasy\") in favour of a more natural approach, and the result is his best vocal performance, hands down. His screams and growls sound demonic although not sounding too artificially elaborated. Then, the bass sound. Orion is finally clearly audible in the mix: the bass shines in every song of the album, and is not overwhelmed by the guitars any more, providing some interestig grooves and riffs, as in \"Blow Your Trumpets Gabriel\" or \"O Father, O Satan, O Sun\". The guitar sound is heavy, dark, sinister, beautifully distorted and hefty, in other words: beautiful. The riffs are a mixture of death metal and black metal, and the songs are also distinguished by the presence of arpeggios and tremolo picking. The solos are tasteful and really add elegance to the mix: they are never self-indulgent, sometimes they are simple, sometimes they are elaborate; they can sound either furious, or sinister, or both, according to the case. The whole production is crystal-clear, as expected from Nuclear Blast. The simple, really heavy, sinister and full of energy riffs are accompanied by Inferno's furious and typical double bass drumming; his performance proves him once again being one of extreme metal's best drummers, without any doubt; spot on his blast-beat sessions too. Nergal chose to give a slighty symphonic touch to the album, writing sessions where the guitars and the drums are backed by classical instruments (trombone, strings, saxophone...), and this really adds atmosphere and makes sound everything even more epic. The lyrics are deep, somehow cryptic and beautiful, as always: they talk about occultism and satanism, inspired by Nergal's own philosophy.\n\nLet's talk about the tracks: we have mid-paced songs, like the opener \"Blow Your Trumpets Gabriel\", the title track or the fantastic \"O Father, O Satan, O Sun!\" (an incredible epic that includes a really catchy bass riff, and which is probably also the best track on the album), and fast, furious songs, like \"Furor Divinus\" or \"Amen\": each and every track is extremely well composed and enjoyable to listen, as well as well distinguished from the others. It's interesting to notice that, in some tracks (\"In The Absence Ov Light\" and the final epic), Nergal made an excellent use of spoken parts, an expedient that really adds to the whole atmosphere and listening experience, feeding the dark splendour of this musical masterpiece.\n\n\"The Satanist\" proves to be one of Behemoth's finest albums: excellent song structure, clear production, fantastic lyrics and a great vocal performance by Nergal make it an obliged listen to any black/death metal fan. Don't miss it!\n",
        "\nRecovering from sickness and seeing your strength renewed tends to make you value your health and strength a lot more, especially if said sickness brought you closer to death. I believe this is the case for Behemoth, who's frontman Nergal had been suffering from leukemia prior to this, and that new zest for life gained from surviving that has made The Satanist into one of Behemoth's most massive and driven albums, almost as if some new infernal energy had been imbued into this band. The band's sound on this album also seems to reflect a new, powerful, more inspired, and genuinely satanic outlook with the death metal of previous Behemoth albums receiving a massive dose of black metal which has returned in a more massive form than before. This is an album that blares its presence high atop the peaks of darkness, mass, and sheer depraved passion. It expands and diversifies Behemoth's composition to make songs that are not only recognizable and distinguished, but also manage to be hellish and divine at the same time.\n\nThe entire sound of The Satanist is invigorating and hair-raising to the point of it feeling like an infernal power trip. Through the compositions, through the production, through the instruments and vocals themselves, it feels like this album is hailing something big and terrifying. The music in store here really is a behemoth in the way that it delivers its explosive and gripping songs which also show a ton of versatility in how they are written while still staying solid and consistent in their prideful demonic might. The guitars feel like a massive, churning tidal wave of tremolos, ready to obliterate anything within 10 miles of the shore whether delivering the regular barrage of riffs or bleeding out the sky with solos. The vocals are a lively roar with the unholy poetry in the lyrics being clear as day despite being growled. Nergal sounds like a man possessed, and the mixture of might and mania heard in his voice makes his performance positively flooring. The drumming is versatile and employs a variety of fills and tempos with rage when necessary and stoic reserve when going slower and more deliberately. They also use extraneous elements to a very potent effect, such as horns, choirs, and even saxophones to add these odd, but notable flairs to these songs. It all works to make this into something that literally sounds awesome, as in making you awestruck.\n\nThere is also a lot to be expected from the very versatile songwriting on here that makes every track distinct. Every track seems to want to blast you to bits in its glorious rebellion against Heaven. The songs with the most catch to them are \u201cOra Pro Nobis Lucifer\u201d with its mighty, thundering riffs and roared vocals proclaiming blasphemies as loudly, as strongly, and as clearly as possible, and \u201cThe Satanist\u201d which has a very simmering creep to it, as though the winding riffs are working to beckon you towards Hell. What you would expect to be usual death metal instead has a very chilling and massive blackened edge to it with a decent sense of atmosphere and mass. There are even songs that change the formula altogether. \u201cO Father O Satan O Sun\u201d turns the usual blackened sound on it\u2019s head and instead starts things off with a harrowing choir and a marching pace that feels very glorious and rapturous, in a way that makes it feel as though the sky has cracked open and the end has just begun. Every song works to distinguish itself right out of the gate which is always a great idea whether starting off with a slow build, Nergal\u2019s deranged satanic sermons (beginning \u201cMesse Noir\u201d with the phrase \u201cI BELIVE IN SATAN!\u201d), or a massive, thundering charge of drums and tremolos, these songs are clear, distinct, and mighty. The lines of each song being clear and the writing running the gamut of slow builders, to chilling fast-paced blasts, to songs that are more cryptic, or even rapturous. While staying consistent in style, Behemoth show a stunning level of variety, grace, and ingenuity.\n\nThe Satanist shows a band that, if they aren\u2019t already at their peak, they are certainly striving for it. The guitar solos on here feel absolutely sky-rending and further punctuate the feelings of terror mixed with glory, again with \u201cO Father O Satan O Sun\u201d having one of the most hair-raising solos on here. The whole album oozes this sort of power that is only further punctuated by the songs written for it. Even lyrically, it appears this was made in dedication to some higher form of satanic expression rather than a simple blasphemous death metal album, reading out in a very biblical manner. I already talked about how varied the songwriting is, with it being enough to make each song stand tall on its own. Each of them has some riff, some lyrics, some line, some quirk, some songwriting deviation, or some combination of all of these to make it worth setting apart and remembering. From the introductory crawl of \u201cBlow Your Trumpets Gabriel\u201d through the dark corridors of the title track, all the way to the brilliantly climactic ending. Behemoth handles this with the skill and the fury of corrupted seraphim to make a truly solid album.\n\nBehemoth have gone above and beyond the call of duty with The Satanist, creating an album that is as grand and as harrowing as they could do so. While it may bear a lot of similarities to their previous albums, Behemoth have done things on The Satanist that make them seem more determined and more invigorated than before. This album wields its dissonance and its power in a way that makes it distinguished. The songs are the kind of affairs that I find myself returning to again and again. It is an album that feels full, alive, and mighty at every minute of its run-time, with both the vigor and the memorability to show itself as close to ideal. It puts the satanism that has been at the backbone of Behemoth\u2019s identity for the longest time into harrowing musical form that bleeds out in every dissonant note, every bark from Nergal\u2019s throat, every pound of the drums from Inferno\u2019s kit, and every rare calm moment that does more to enhance the darkness rather than relieve it. It feels like a massive musical tribute to the figure and symbolism of Lucifer in the most powerful way Behemoth could do so. Safe to say, I enjoyed this quite thoroughly.\n",
        "\nYou have to admit, Behemoth has come a long way as a band. They went from pure black metal to blackened death metal.This is their debut album, their very first of the two black metal ones they released, before changing their sound entirely.\n\nI have to admit, it's damn impressive to even hear the fact that Nergal was only 16 when this released. That's just ridiculous. All of the instrumentation is great. The drums are very well varied and placed. The guitars (if you can actually manage to hear it) have some pretty great riffs throughout the album. Most of the songs also have acoustic guitars thrown in to add to the atmosphere, and they fit EXTREMELY well. This album feels very pagan in nature and much more than any of their other albums. The lyrics are also great and fit seamlessly into the atmosphere. \n\nAside from the shoddy production that prevents you from hearing the guitars clearly, the vocals were probably my biggest complaint about the album. They are not bad at all. (Still very impressive for the fact that the dude is only 16 years old.) But my problem is that they are way too generic here. I don't like comparing future albums from bands to their older work and usually look at the album itself as a whole. But I am pretty glad that after this and Grom, Nergal found a unique vocal style that he can say is his own. When you listen to Behemoth, you just know it's them when you hear Nergal's vocals. Though, the album is easy to listen to since the vocals aren't bad and are a slightly better than typical black metal vocals. Here and there, you will hear some choruses in the background, most likely an effect from keyboards, (Take Hidden In A Fog for example), and I absolutely love when it comes on. Adds even more to the already perfect ambiance that the album brings. I also think the version of \"From The Pagan Vastlands\" from this album has a MUCH better and stronger atmosphere than the re-recorded one. \n\n\"The Touch Of Nya\" and \"He Dwells In Ice\" are the soft tracks of the album. The Touch Of Nya has two BEAUTIFUL acoustic guitars playing a very simple melody. It's very relaxing to hear and is definitely one of my all-time favorite classical style acoustic pieces. The problem with it is that it's way too short. Only 50 seconds long. He Dwells In Ice has a clean guitar (or acoustic?) with some simple keyboards in the back. Nothing amazing, but a pretty good listen regardless. \n\nDespite having generic vocals, and barely distinguishable guitars due to the poor production, the atmosphere on this album alone makes a journey on your ears from start to finish. This is an essential album to any black metal fan, and should not be skipped by anyone. If you can, go to a forest or a park in the middle of the night with this on, and this album will do its magic on you.\n\nStandout tracks: \"From The Pagan Vastlands\", \"Hidden In A Fog\", \"Entering The Fantasian Soul\", and \"Wolves Guard My Coffin\". The Touch of Nya is an amazing piece of art, but that song is only 50 seconds long. I can't express enough how beautiful it is to me. Definitely give these a listen when you get the chance to.\n",
        "\nWhat is this? A modern, well-produced, well-crafted black metal album that has been acclaimed by critics is getting hate? Geez, I wonder why!? I am noticing a pattern here (\"cough\" Blackwater Park \"cough\", ok, it's not really black metal, but still...) Is this album not \"kvlt\" enough? In all seriousness, Behemoth have reached a songwriting peak, there is a reason critics like this album so much and I am truly amazed by the quality of the music in The Satanist. These guys have been around since the early nineties, they started out as nothing special - norwegian BM copycats, and they've come this far, being one of the leading forces in the blackened death subgenre.\n\nThe riffing on this album is what the kids these days call \"juicy\". You've got a 50/50 of atmospheric black metal riffs and crushing death metal ones. A well maintained balance, some tracks showing just a tad bit more of each as to achieve diversity (woah, a diverse black metal album!). The songs are atmospheric and brutal, proving you don't need to record on a potato to sound \"evil\". As for the drumming, I have my doubts whether it's a machine behind the kit or an actual drummer. Those blast beats and double bass are, for lack of a better word, fast. Seriously, the guy is playing these at a tempo of around 200, pounding the shit out of the snare and cymbals. You can hear the bass, and it's great! Well, nothing out of the ordinary, it just fits the music and keeps a steady bassline that most of the old-school BM bands lack. And Nergal's vocals, a terrific death metal performance that is actually surprisingly catchy and you can even make out some of the lyrics. Synths are also present here and there, adding a bit more to the atmosphere of this truly menacing record. \"In The Absence Ov Life\" is one of the many stand-outs because of its implementation of a saxophone which, although heard for just a bit, is an important piece in the structure of the track.\n\nSo, nothing's perfect, right? Well, this applies to \"The Satanist\" as well. The lyrics, although written very poetically and with a main focus on storytelling, are generic. \"Ooh, look at me, I'm a Satanist, so edgy, lol!\" Also, being the prog-snob fag I am I will have to note that the album is not very, well, you've guessed it, PROGGY! But since this is bias from my side it does not in any way affect the rating. The production is staggering! All of the tracks are recorded and mixed meticulously and the whole thing sounds great. I don't mind lo-fi production but its overuse in extreme metal makes it as irritating and stereotypical as pop music (yes, I just compared extreme metal to pop, bite me). And as I've already said, the record is actually quite diverse. There is a core principle of songwriting as in any LP, but nothing is repetitive. \n\nSo, all in all, \"The Satanist\", whether or not you've enjoyed it, is an album which has very tight songwriting. It brings something new to the genre and makes a steady attempt at getting extreme metal out of the deep waters of the underground. No, it's not \"poppy\" and no, Behemoth haven't gotten softer (just watch the frickin' music videos, they are some messed up shit). It is still very harsh, very evil and deserves to be called true metal (as if that's a criterion). But one thing this album also has is great composition and expert musicianship. So, stop being a \"kvlt kid\" and enjoy the record for what it is, not all music should be judged equally.\n",
        "\nBrutality perfected. \n\nBehemoth are among one of the most prolific names in both black and death metal for a very good reason. While in some people's eyes albums since have left a lot to be desired, I believe that Demigod is the true peak of death metal-era Behemoth and here's exactly why. \n\nThe album features what I believe to be some of Nergal's and Seth's greatest guitar riffs. I believe the harmonies created by the two here and tighter, more refined and more crushing than even the monstrous riffs found on Zos Kia Cultus. \n\nFor example; Conquer All is an assault on the senses in the best way possible and I think it alone summarises a lot of the essential elements to the album. Right away; the riffs are thick, they chug aggressively as Nergal's most viscous sounding vocals to date rise above and weave between Seth's screaming lead guitar. It's all simple in execution, it's not particularly technical, but it's all about the groove and the flow of it; your head is banging and you are swallowed up in a void of crushing heaviness. \n\nOf course, the audio assault wouldn't be the same without Inferno's demonic drumming, and I can confidently state that, in my opinion, the man's never put in a performance quite as spectacular as this since. The drums are perfect on this album; the blisteringly fast double kicks puncture through Orion's eruptive bass, snares and toms pelt the listener with a sonic wall of noise that's just impossible not to fall weak to. \n\nThe entire album concept rests around the idea of Eastern culture and tells brutal stories of ancient ages. The additions of horns and acoustic guitar really help to immerse the listener. It's clear in the title track, Sculpting the Throne ov Seth, Conquer All and Towards Babylon especially. \n\nOne of the major criticisms levelled against this album in hindsight is in the amount of layering on Nergal's vocals and the complaints by some that it is loud for loudness sake. I can't speak for anyone else besides myself but I adore Nergal's vocal performance on this album, the layering helps transcend one of the most recognisable and evil sounding death voices and helps to elevate it into the realms of inhuman, of truly demonic origin. Ordinarily I am opposed to vocal modulation, aside from basic reverb, but here on the album it just fits perfectly in my opinion. The crushing aggression of the music, the sheer fierce nature of the lyrics, of the ambience created etc. just required that little extra push. \n\nIt would be remiss of me not to talk a little about solos in the album, Seth has always provided stellar lead playing to Nergal's rhythm guitar, but when it comes to reaching high on that fret board, some of the screaming, shredding solos present here are among the best of Behemoth's entire discography; look no further than the lead riffs and solo performance in Slaves Will Serve and Conquer All especially. \n\nDemigod is a much different beast to a lot of death metal-era Behemoth that was releasing at the time; as much as I love Thelema 6 and Zos Kia Cultus, those albums (and even Satanica to a lesser extent) all felt like they were building up to something bigger, heavier, angrier and more evil. They were building up to Demigod and they succeeded masterfully.\n",
        "\nIt is rare to find a band that is able to successfully navigate the realms of black metal and death metal with such a degree of success. Behemoth is one such band. Behemoth's earliest demos are canonical works in the black metal catalog, while their newer material has established them as death metal giants. This album is by far one of Behemoth's more interesting releases. While Sventevith and the earlier demos are purely black metal marked by raw production, thrash influenced drumming, and Mayhem-esque guitar riffs; Grom is largely a transitional album setting up Behemoth's move towards death metal. Grom lacks the rawness of Behemoth's earlier efforts, and clearly has better quality production. Instrumentally speaking, notable changes in sound include the jumpy almost punk-like bass that is audible throughout the album, female vocals, chanting, repetitive guitar riffs, and several atmospheric interludes. Black metal purists and naysayers will be quick to point out these stylistic departures are \" out of place,\" \"odd,\" and \"superfluous\" but it is precisely these elements that make the album worth listening to. Without these stylistic changes this album with be rather superficial, repetitive, and quite honestly boring. \n\nEach song on the album is catchy in its own right, but gets boring rather quickly. Nergal and company are able to keep the listener engaged by adding these odd elements to the album making it one you'll want to listen to from beginning to end. For example, in The Dark Forest, the first guitar riff is repeated for nearly a minute before Nergal interrupts with an emphatic arpeggiated riff that leads directly into the body of the song, which, otherwise, is fairly standard black metal. This theme of breaking up more traditional black metal progressions with different musical elements is seen throughout the album. Frequently these elements remind me pagan metal motifs (read Enslaved circa 1994), and simply add to the overall feel of the album. The biggest shortfall of this album is that every song follows this pattern, such that no single song stands out. While there are some great guitar solos and experimental passages, this album simply does not do enough to differentiate between each song making it apparent that Nergal was still searching for his sound. \n\nNotwithstanding, this was the first Behemoth album I ever picked up, and remains one of my favorite albums by them. It is one of the few albums I always listen to from beginning to end and It represents the unique period of time where Behemoth was able to make the move from pure black metal to the death metal masters they now are.\n",
        "\n\"Diableria (the Great Introduction)\" is the name of the short opening of \"Pandemonic Incantations\" and it belongs to these rare intros that live up to their name. Orchestral opulence and conjuring vocals lead the audience straight to hell before the first regular track breaks loose. The first thing one realizes is that the successor of \"Grom\" presents a totally different production. Instead of delivering another slightly blurred yet powerful and massive mix, \"Pandemonic Incantations\" concentrates on sharpness, transparency and surgical preciseness. It is almost impossible to compare the productions of these two works, but both are absolutely convincing. So there is no reason for concern, Behemoth's third full-length sounds neither sterile nor bloodless. \n\nIn terms of style, Nergal and his new sidekicks have taken a giant step from black metal with some rare folkloric ingredients to death metal with a demonic aura. The energetic formation does no longer appear as a Polish underground band, but as a legion of international calibre. And it is not a matter of course, that the guys are able to play the new role as well as their old one. Behemoth have forged an album that does not show any signs of half-heartedness. The dudes celebrate their modified style in an authentic manner. Great melodies show up and blast beats create an overwhelming inferno. Less furious parts generate an amazing atmosphere as well while the guttural and demonic voice of Nergal ensures more than the necessary degree of metal-compatible emotions. His charismatic voice sounds triumphant, accusing, desperate or imperious. Consequently, even rather sedate pieces such as \"Driven by the Five-winged Star\" seem to be spawned by the devil's wife (who is, as we all know since Iron Angel's debut from the year 1986, seduced by Satan all night - to express it mildly). The following \"The Past Is Like a Funeral\" creates a hellish mood as well. Although there are no trumpets, Behemoth provide fanfare-like sounds that intertwine with merciless guitars and sinister harmonies.\n\nAnother great advantage of the album is constituted by its unpredictable song patterns. I do not know whether one can call the structure of the songs progressive and I also do not know whether I want to describe them with that word. Yet there can be no doubt that the great amount of breaks and the fact that they never hurt the flow of the tracks contribute a lot to the thrilling overall picture of \"Pandemonic Incantations\". The more or less conventional song patterns of \"Grom\" have been thrown away. They worked excellently for that album, but now Behemoth have discovered the \"no risk, no fun\" doctrine and they are curious to explore more complex structures. Thus, the here reviewed album is anything else but formulaic, quite the opposite. The fast sequence of different parts lends the output a high degree of liveliness.\n\nKeyboards are not forbidden, but they never have the chance to gain the upper hand. Nevertheless, they make a good contribution to the atmosphere of the album. By contrast, the \"classic\" instruments (guitar, bass, drums) do not fail to generate a vehement assault. In particular the most intensive pieces, for example \"The Thousand Plagues I Witness\", pummel the listener without the slightest touch of mercy. \"Grom\" was the thunder, here comes the thunderstorm. As mentioned above, there are substantial differences in terms of style between the two albums, but everything has stayed the same with regard to the levels of credibility, aggression and dedication. Although \"Pandemonic Incantations\" is slightly weaker than its predecessor, its fanaticism, musicality and robustness are impressive - as well as its uncompromising, violent character. Friends of black or death metal will enjoy the here presented pandemonium.\n",
        "\nI freely admit that the headline is not very original, but a highly decorated scientist (myself) has detected that \"Thunder\" (\"Grom\") and extreme metal have many things in common. The noisy explosiveness, the shocking effect, the power. Not to mention the fact that the closest friend of Thunder is called Lightning and we have therefore another feature of extreme metal at hand: energy. Well, \"Grom\" reflects power and energy as well and those who do not listen to metal will be shocked when being confronted with this album. But the second full-length of the Polish flagship also conveys a primordial, natural and slightly mysterious feeling. The fantastic artwork bundles these elements and it also leaves no doubt about the style of the music. \"Grom\" houses pure black metal, probably influenced by albums such as \"De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\" (listen, for instance, to the sick vocals in \"Lasy Pomorza\") or \"Pure Holocaust\" (the various high speed parts). Furthermore, it shares its heathenish elements with the works of Rob Darken's Graveland. Nevertheless, \"Grom\" reveals an own personality. Some purists might say that the Norwegian classics cannot be beaten and I tend to agree, but Behemoth have penned a very strong full-length as well. Some tracks are simply perfect.\n\nThe extremely dense \"Lasy Pomorza\" is among these immaculate creations. Its different parts, the combative and raging opening, the powerful yet relatively melodic verse and the elegiac chorus melt seamlessly with each other. The partially Attila-inspired singing walks the fine line between genius and insanity with instinctive certainty and the multi-layered guitar work goes hand in hand with dynamic tempo changes. \"Passionate\" is probably the word which describes tunes such as \"Lasy Pomorza\" perfectly. \"Spellcraft and Heathendom\", another unbeatable number, shows a very harsh side of the band. The guitar work is the driver for this mostly fast-paced eruption of violence. Behemoth cut a corridor through the Pomeranian forests with the power of a bulldozer. Nergal puts his black heart and the likewise black soul in this song. His raw and fervent vocal performance borders on lunacy, while the restlessly attacking guitars demoralise the Polish Catholics in a merciless manner. Please decide for yourself whether this is a tragic or not.\n\nYet Behemoth do not only focus on aggression. Consequently, the atmospheric intro and the outstanding beginning of \"Dragon's Lair\" are dominated by great keyboards lines. The intro is based on a very simple yet effective use of this sometimes tabooed instrument, while the keyboard melody of \"Dragon's Lair\" has an almost playful touch. (No panic, this does not mean that it fails to liaise with the driving guitars in an excellent manner.) A small number of somewhat folkloric sections is also integrated and the same goes for pretty melodic female vocals. Yet already the pure rawness of the album's mix prevents any form of laxity. The courageous three-piece did not intend to create a consensus-seeking sound. Blessed with a do-it-yourself mentality, the band itself produced the album. Thus, \"Grom\" shows an intoxicating, almost overmodulated mix with thick guitars, an outstanding density and contagious liveliness. The result is that the full-length scores with a pretty unique and very exciting character. Maybe I am just too old and my brain is a loser, but I do not know many other releases with a similar sound. Guess this is a very huge compliment for \"Grom\".\n\nThe music and lyrics have mostly been written by main man Nergal. Drummer Baal Ravenlock contributes the texts for two songs, bassist Les is happy while playing just his instrument. Speaking of the involved artists, I may not forget to mention the female guest singer. She shows up in some songs, for example during the fanatic first regular track. Her clean soprano avoids trite \"beauty and the beast\" stereotypes with great ease. Nevertheless, the duet with Nergal in the title track does not fully work, but this is probably not her guilt. The composition itself fails to reach the highest level. \"Grom\" is the rather slow-moving closer of the album and simultaneously the only song which does not deliver another uncompromising dose of sincere black metal. This is slightly regrettable, because the band had the potential to forge a totally perfect album. Anyway, the highly decorated scientist that I have mentioned at the beginning of this review smiles. \"Grom\", the album, is truly a thunder.\n",
        "\nDue to the smashing success of Demigod, The Apostasy was the first Behemoth album that enjoyed a gestation period complete with wall-to-wall expectation of the highest magnitude. There was a lot of pressure on this album's shoulders to deliver, and to the band's credit they didn't take the easy route and release Demigod Part II. This record feels more like its own characteristic entity and in many ways superior to the material that came directly before it. As far as I've always seen it, the biggest positive on this album is the return of some of the feral, rabid and manic bloodletting savagery that made Thelema.6 so memorable. Demigod felt so overdone and bloated at times that the lasting power of the material suffered, and the less said about the vocals on that album the better.\n\nDescribing The Apostasy's sound requires focusing on the production first and foremost, which is an extremely sterile and \"barren\" sound without incessant overdubbing and the benefit of extensive synth use. Inferno truly comes into his own on this album, and the production feels more percussion-driven than before. This results in dry blastbeats that really slide into an effective comfort zone on tracks like the virulent \"Prometherion.\" Other more tempered odes to iniquity include \"At the Left Hand ov God\" and the airtight chug-centric \"Be Without Fear.\" Nergal's preoccupation with Middle Eastern themes and stylistic window dressing continues, but the incessant reliance on the same few melodic hooks isn't as debilitating as it was on Demigod, where many songs contained licks that were virtually identical and utilized in the same manner. Seth's irrelevance continues here, making me wish that Orion switched to guitars so he could provide a capable second mind for Nergal to bounce ideas off of. He simply feels so wasted in Behemoth, since I was familiar with Vesania first.\n\nThe Apostasy borders on the technical and complex, primarily concerning Inferno's masterfully-crafted drum tracks. Highlights of this include virtually all of \"Kriegphilosophie\" and the opening of \"Arcane Hereticae,\" which is exhausting to even air-drum to, let alone play for real. Dissonant tremolos stir a murky brew of flesh-searing hooks and snappy, serpentine rhythms. I return to \"Kriegphilosophie\" as one of the best examples of the band locking into a killer cadence, with the drums and riffs playing off of each other near-perfectly. The Apostasy's biggest flaw is perhaps the fact that the second half of the record fails to muster even a fraction of the impact the first few songs do. The stolid, morose build of \"Pazuzu\" is good stuff, but many of the remaining songs evade long-term memory, which is a flaw Demigod avoided since its best track was the closer.\n\nRegardless of how you look at it, The Apostasy is modern Behemoth slaying like they slay best, and it feels more focused and crafted with some measure of restraint, which does the band favors. Nergal's voluminous, sustained growls are parched, full and sepulchral as all get out, sitting atop a throne of blood, bone and pretense. I wouldn't say that this quite edges out Thelema.6 in raw power, but it easily outstrips the misguided Zos Kia Cultus (Here and Beyond) and made a memorable impact that seems to have been forgotten over all of the hype regarding the band's recent work. When I am in the mood for easy-to-digest Behemoth, I usually grab this one.\n",
        "\nThis is a strange promo/demo. It features 3 tracks (on the original cassette, at least), 2 of which would be rerecorded for the demo \"From the Pagan Vastlands\", and one that was rerecorded for the \"And the Forests Dream Eternally\" EP. \n\nThese songs on \"Thy Winter Kingdom\", however, are presented here in a very raw, very \"necro\" sound. I'm not sure if this or Endless Damnation sounds worse; the production is very unclear. Be that as it may, it is a rehearsal demo, so there is some leniency from me with regards to the production. That being said, the guitars and drums can be heard...relatively easily (except when the drums overpower the guitars). The bass is basically inaudible, but that is to be expected for most black metal demos. \n\nThe vocals are there...somewhere underneath all the distorted mess. They sound like they are caked in reverb too, which makes them extra indiscernible. Again, no surprises considering it's a black metal demo. By this point, Nergal abandoned the deeper growls of Endless Damnation for more black metal style vocals, which vaguely reminds of Abbath's vocals on Immortal's \"Diabolical Fullmoon Mysticism\" album. This would become more apparent, even blatant, on \"From the Pagan Vastlands\".\n\nThe lyrics provoke some wonderful imagery inspired by a mix of Pagan and Satanic themes, such as this example in the song \"Thy Winter Kingdom\":\n\n\"I live primeval life under the horned one's rules\nSteeps resounded with the howl of the wolves\nSearching alone for the victim\nAnd from the deep forest rised you chant\" [sic]\n\nConfirming the lyrical credits of these songs in their respective future releases, Baal, the drummer, wrote the lyrics to the title track, whilst Nergal wrote lyrics for the other two tracks, as well as composed the material. Considering they were merely teenagers (Nergal was only 15/16 at the time of this release) and English is not their first language, it is actually some quality material, both compositionally and lyrically. The lyrics certainly invoke my imagination, especially when reading them and listening to the music concurrently. \n\nThe songs have additional lead guitar solos in addition to different arrangements (Moonspell Rites is over 2 minutes longer here than its rerecording on the \"And the Forests Dream Eternally\" EP), compared to their rerecorded future counterparts. The credits do not indicate specifically who plays the leads, although I believe Nergal is playing them. The solos sound out of tune at times, although I am not completely sure if that's because the band didn't tune the instruments properly, or recording onto the tape messed with the pitches. At least the songs sound pretty cool in that quarter-step down \"tuning\" that this demo has, like what you may hear in old thrash albums. \n\nThese songs are step in the right direction for the young, then-Pagan themed Behemoth. They will go on to sound much better in their future rerecordings, between a combination of better production and more confidence in their playing. The diamonds were there, just buried underneath a lot of rough (production).\n",
        "\nTrue strength is not simply a lack of weakness, it is the rise after the fall, it is tasting defeat and spiting it back into the faces of those who doubt you. After the immense success of 2009's excellent \u2018Evangelion\u2019 many wondered how Behemoth could possibly top perfection. Then the news of Nergal\u2019s leukemia hit and doubt spread as to what Behemoth would do next, or whether there would even be another album at all. Five years later the band answered the call and the result is 'The Satanist', and it\u2019s massive.\n\nWhat really hits you hardest when you listen to this album is the dramatic change in the approach to song writing the band has adopted. Don\u2019t go head first into it expecting the technical blackened death metal approach we have seen in the past, it appears this is a very different Behemoth then what we knew. Whereas before the band relied heavily on speed and complexity it is now blunt impact and atmosphere that drives the songs forward. Opening track 'Blow Your Trumpets Gabriel' showcases a rolling thunder cloud of a riff and declares that this is what Behemoth are all about now, the riffs. It also introduces Nergal\u2019s slower more pronounced vocal approach as he declares the first line of the album ''I saw the virgin's cunt spawning forth the snake''. Lovely imagery. \n\nThe sound and production of the music has changed dramatically from past albums. This is expected as Behemoth have always stuck to the aim of never making the same album twice. The overall tonal feel of the sound is deeper, rawer and less digital. Production duties were handled by Wojtek and Slawek Wieslawscy and Daniel Bergstrand, the team has done a beautiful job bringing this monster to life. There\u2019s a nice amount of melodic lead work from Nergal and Seth but overall there\u2019s much less shredding then you'd expect, the first real solo isn't until the end of the third song. By spacing these moments out they've created a much more anticipation driven experience. \n\nThe mix is rich due to the help of additions including a brass section and three cellist which results in a more epic and diverse sound, the title track is a great example of this. As well as being immensely heavy this album also contains what is probably Behemoth's calmest recording 'In The Absence Ov Light'. The song starts off as a fast and brutal assault until Nergal brakes pace and delves into an acoustic/spoken word passage (an excerpt from Witold Gombrowicz's 'Slub') set against the saxophone work of Marcin Janek, showing how deep his musical talents can reach. The drums also deserve praise. Inferno has always been a fantastic drummer and here he shows he can expand his playing away from his usual technical death metal drumming style. These drums are loud and deep, they rumble, vibrate and really bring power to the songs, they can sound distant before they charge up and crush you, thanks given to Urban Nasvall for his fantastic drum tech work. Also the bass work here is brilliant. Bass is too often left down in the mix to be hardly present, but here it rules. This is definitely the best bass sound Behemoth have used to date. Instead of being only audible during the quite sections it is often the loudest element. It really feels part of the mix now and much like the drums it rumbles and in some parts seems to lead the compositions, as in the intro to 'Ora Pro Nobis Lucifer'.\n\nI bought the special edition digipak version of the album which comes with a bonus DVD containing a live show (Live Barbarossa) and a making of documentary (The Satanist: Oblivion). Both of these are excellent standalone pieces so as extras they are a welcomed bonus. The live show is a good enough example of a Behemoth show and does feature some rare tracks as well as capturing Nergal using an unusually guttural and raspy vocal style. I was particularly impressed with 'Oblivion' which is more like a short film than a behind the scenes documentary. I\u2019d highly recommend this version over the standard album. It does however have a downside, the album cover has been covered by a piece of reflective silver colored card board displaying the Behemoth and 'The Satanist' logos. This wasn\u2019t bad until I realized it had been stuck over the original cover art by Denis Forkas which is a shame because he's a great artist. I assume the intended meaning is that you look at the album and see your own reflection thus, you are 'The Satanist', this is a cool idea but on the other hand I would have liked to see the original cover art used inside somewhere (it also collects fingerprints very easily). Another point to make about the layout is that the lyrics in the booklet have been written in a decorative text that looks like the scribblings of a mad man, it looks very artistic but makes it impossible to read the lyrics. This is a shame because both Nergal and Krzysztof Azarewicz are fantastic lyricist, for example; ''I cut loose the cord ov li(f)e / Depart celestial source /Rub mould in holy pages / Let woodworms eat the cross......Who shall crucify the last prophets / And have them wilt on splintered stems? / Who shall churn hells across the earth / and reascend to seat himself\u2026 / at the left hand ov Satan'' (taken from 'Messe Noire'). Or my personal favourite verse of the whole album; ''Like a day without the dawn / Like a ray void ov the sun / Like a storm that brings no calm / I'm most complete yet so undone'' (taken from 'O Father O Satan O Sun'). Of course you can find the lyrics easy enough online, but you shouldn\u2019t have to.\n\nThe Satanist is a massive and fantastic work of death metal. It may shock some old Behemoth fans with its changes, I\u2019ll admit that I was undecided when I first heard it, but I found that after each listen I loved it more and more. Give it room to grow and it will imbed itself in your brain. Personally I would say the best songs to check out are 'Ben Sahar' and 'O Father O Satan O Sun' which features verses taken from Alesister Crowley's 'Liber Samekh' in its lyrics and is definitely one of the best songs from any band I\u2019ve heard in a long time. This album is proof that Behemoth are one of the most resilient, unstoppable and best metal bands out there. Check out this wonderful work and praise the mighty Behemoth!\n",
        "\nOut of the plethora of early 90\u2019s black metal demos, \u201cEndless Damnation\u201d sticks out for me as one of the rustier sounding and mediocre. Sure, Behemoth is a blackened death juggernaut today, but this was when the band was still only a year old. Nergal and co. were only in their mid-teens at the time and their inexperience is blatantly obvious. Though the band got considerably better in just a couple years after this release, this sure was a sloppy mess of way to kickstart their career.\n\nThe first thing that one will notice when listening to this is just how bad the production is. Not quite as bad as Happy Days\u2019 \u201cA World of Pain\u201d but it\u2019s up there. It\u2019s sloppy, deafening and at times borderline unlistenable but this was recorded by a group of fourteen year olds on a cassette tape so I\u2019m going to cut them some slack. But what is worth harping on is the band\u2019s performance which sounds just like you\u2019d expect; a group of kids in their early/mid teens who barely know how to play their instruments.\n\nThe music itself is more akin to death/doom than black metal which is surprising. Songs are pretty slow and Nergal gives a deep guttural growl most of times. They sound alright but they have a tendency to blend into the poor production. Other than that, the guitars are barely audible a lot of the time. When they manage to creep through the fuzzy sound quality, one would be able to hear the very, very simple riffs and absolute lack of thought they have. Never is this more obvious than when the solos pop up, which are generally uninteresting and uneventful. The drums boom over everything else, but the timing is seriously off, especially on track \u201cTemple of Evil\u201d which becomes difficult to follow simply because of the drumming.\n\nAll that being said, the intro and outro tracks \u201cInto the Black Mass\u201d and \u201cEndless Damnation\u201d are actually pretty decent. They\u2019re simple; just a pipe organ playing a moody melody. The grimy production works well in their favor, giving these tracks a gloomy, foggy atmosphere that does a good job of drawing in the listener. Its shame though that the best songs on this demo are its intro and outro.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t recommend this to most people, save for die hard Behemoth fans or maybe people who are into these old gritty black metal demos, but it\u2019s hard to ignore the poor musicianship. I\u2019ve heard far worse, mind you, but this still isn\u2019t remarkable in any way.\n",
        "\nWait, what?!\n\nThat's probably no news for extreme metal fans that Behemoth started off as a black metal act and then evolved into a blackened death metal band, which they are mostly known for. But since their blackened death metal sound made them famous, it may be surprising how their debut actually sounds, especially for the relatively new fans, including myself.\n\nIn fact Behemoth's later stuff doesn't sound anything like their early years. At the first listen, one may think that the band who put out \"The Satanist\" can't be the same which wrote \"Sventevith\". This one is nowhere near death metal's sound and it also has an incredibly soft, atmospheric touch throughout most tracks, as well as the melancholic mood. This proved to be the biggest surprise for me. Behemoth was really keen on the acoustic tunes, which can be heard on most of the tracks. Generally all the tracks are raw in nature, but there are really lots of melodic parts. Some of them are executed on the electric guitar as well. Traditional tremolo picking guides the listener through the majority of this album and the guitarists occasionally throw some really fearsome old school black metal riffs in there. Drumming is decent, but nothing outstanding.\n\nAs different as \"Sventevith\" musically is from the later era of the band, it also differs a lot when it comes to the vocals and lyrics. Vocal difference shouldn't be much of a surprise though, since this clearly is nothing other than black metal. Nergal's vocals aren't bad, but neither are these anything unique - just typical black metal screeching. But they definitely fit in the picture. Lyrics feature pagan beliefs and also describe surrounding nature. These are probably more suitable for those not interested in the later satanic themes.\n\nProduction is not modern like Dimmu Borgir. It's raw and dirty, but it doesn't ruin the album. Still, at times, riffing could sound somewhat clearer and the vocals tend to be a little uneven, but this is probably expected by anyone who tries out some older black metal. However, it arguably helps to make the atmosphere even more magical and this is one of the main strong points of this release. The epic feel and melancholic atmosphere work is really tranquilizing. The album art helps to get the thoughts moving, alongside the music. Pictures of sailing on the dark sea, wandering around in the twilight or something similar are bound to come by. These thoughts peak at the penultimate, fully acoustic track \"Hell Dwells in Ice\", after which we are awakened by the last vicious track. \n\nBehemoth's first full length release has its flaws and some of the Norwegian influence can be heard, but the incredible feel the band managed to create back then makes this one of the standout releases in their career. This could even have a wider audience than Behemoth's later material, but in fact it is very underrated. I don't know if an average black/death Behemoth fan would include this in their collection, but it is a must for anyone looking some interesting pagan themed, or simply (somewhat) atmospheric black metal. I would also put this one easily in front of the following \"Grom\" as well, which is an above average BM release but no where near the glory of \"Sventevith\" . If this review got you interested, then check this one out because this album deserves more recognition for sure.\n\n83/100\n",
        "\nAfter 5 years since the success of Evangelion, most fans would be getting a bit annoyed with Behemoth for not compiling a follow-up album. This wait however is more than excusable due to front-man and guitarist Adam \u2018Nergal\u2019 Darksi being diagnosed with leukemia in 2010 that advanced to such a level that chemotherapy proved ineffective to cure it. After finding a successful bone marrow transplant Nergal dismissed the illness without an ounce of self pity as it where nothing more than a life obstacle. Along with this celebration, Behemoth\u2019s 10th album The Satanist has become one of the most anticipated albums of the year. \n\nImmediately obvious is The Satanist's radically different sound. Coming from a man who has scoffed whilst peering into the abyss, one would expect opener Blow Your Trumpets Gabriel to be an explosive inferno of extreme metal. Instead a sloth-paced chord is layered over a brooding breath of archangelic instrumentation. Enter: Nergal. You know you\u2019ve got a musician who takes his faith and music seriously when the opening lines to the album are \u201cI saw the virgin\u2019s cunt spawning forth the snake.\u201d Nergal\u2019s lyrics are clearly one of the main focuses of The Satanist. They force you to listen to what he has to say in other songs such as Messe Noir, detailing his allegiance to Satanism, and Amen, cursing The Virgin Mary. The clarity of Nergal\u2019s Satanic interpretation is helped by the pinpoint production throughout the record; a feat that a lot of black metal and extreme bands stumble on.\n\nFans that still lust for the typical speed of Behemoth\u2019s past efforts should still be satisfied with this album. Every track has the potential to give listeners whiplash but the explosive Furor Divinus almost passes too quickly through the tunnel of Inferno\u2019s uncompromising drum work that you are left with your head spinning from not just the headbanging but also how they can play that fast. Ora Pro Nobis Lucifer is the closest Behemoth has come to different genres of heaviness. Through the flurry of blast beats the guitar riffs spin off in different directions hinting a punk like and bluesy shroud to the song. \n\nThere are elements within this album that signal Behemoth is exploring newer ideas. A spoken word passage above a distant saxophone solo is found within In The Absence Ov Light and brass instruments, particularly horns (Was that a pun aimed at The Devil, Nergal?) are present in tracks such as the opening track and The Satanist with the simple yet blackening bass lines and whimpering overdubs leaving you feel possessed. These additions create an atmosphere of honesty and reality as another dynamic layer within the album.\n\nO Father O Satan O Sun is Nergal\u2019s final pledge to Satanism. This epic 9 minute track encapsulates all of The Satanist\u2019s components. From the chilling overdubs that start the song to the provoking lyrics to the satanic prayer to end the album. The changes in dynamics help the song speed along whilst you are left to contemplate how such majesty can be bottled into one track. What\u2019s the saying? What doesn\u2019t kill you only makes you stronger\u2026\n",
        "\nThis is one of the most difficult albums for me to review. Everything about it is stellar to me, but I can\u2019t quite put my finger exactly on the elements that make it so great. I encourage you to spend more time listening to the album rather than trying to glean the quality from my bungling words here. However, I will do my best.\n\nIf you listen to extreme metal of any kind and have not seen the video for Blow Your Trumpets Gabriel, you must be living under a rock. This amazing track opens the album and is by far one of the best introductions ever. Most of the elements at play here help to sum up what to expect from the album. There are minimalist, doomy sections with grim, caustic growls from Nergal. There are your more decidedly \u201cBehemoth\u201d moments of completely chaotic blastbeats. The riffs are memorable, and the atmosphere is as thick as fog.\n\nThis album could be considered a sister album to Evangelion, as it shares many of the same elements. But if that is the case, The Satanist is the prodigy child. There is an increased focus on melody and scope. Behemoth expertly lace haunting choir parts, horns, and other instrumentation into their dark compositions. Yet they keep them fairly low in the mix in most cases. To me, this differentiates The Satanist from other symphonic albums. Rather than being loud and bombastic, the subtle inclusions give a more eerie effect. It is as if we are hearing the echoes of ghosts or the distant cries of hell.\n\nProduction here is miles above anything Behemoth have done in the past. Gone is the murky boominess of Thelema 6, the clangy bass of The Apostasy, the overwhelming loudness of Demigod. Everything comes through clearly thanks to an increased focus on overall composition and well-crafted slow sections to better emphasize the fast ones. As a result, each track has more of an identity than on previous albums. This does not sound over-polished either. The band sounds very live and doesn\u2019t suffer from a compressed feel. I\u2019d compare it to the nice balance achieved by Blackwater Park.\n\nI could go on and on about all of the devastating factors going on in Nergal\u2019s life during this recording that make this accomplishment even more astounding, but I\u2019ll let the music do the talking. Aside from the aforementioned single, Ora Pro Nobis Lucifer, Amen, Ben Saher, and O Father O Satan O Sun are among the standouts. But honestly, this is one of the few albums that I keep every track with me at all times. There are plenty of detractors out there who seem to want more of the same, but they are fools. This is one album that deserves every bit of praise being heaped on it. I have listened to every Behemoth album and find a different enjoyment in each of them, but none grip me the same as this one has. If you want to listen to Satanica, listen to Satanica\u2026it didn\u2019t go anywhere. Nergal is so happy with this one, he has stated that they may never make another album again. This could be one of the best swansongs ever.\n",
        "\nThe Polish trio return once again, this time after a prolonged period of absence, to assault our senses with their aural antithesis of Creation and Order. Polished and professional, boasting the monstrous, muscular momentum of Inferno's drumming, and the gut-wrenching, skull-splitting vocal work of Nergal, this release actually manages in foregoing quite a few alterations and advancements in their sound.\n\nWhile they were never shy in embracing the mystique and mentality of orchestral (even if only synthesized on earlier releases) ambiences and auras, this time around, the ritualistic atmosphere is achieved not only through choppy, chuggy riffs, and the occasional slew of a black metal injection, but also through the numerous, neatly-arranged backing choirs, string quartets, acoustic sections etc. This brings a certain dosage of bombast and balance to the brutality and intensity of the guitars/vocals/drums, but instead of liquefying them, they make them even more solidified and unified. The intro track first provides a slow build-up, but doesn't shy in quickly adopting quite the punishing and pulverising approach with the punctual, immaculate drumming and some quite agreeable synths in the background. \u201eFuror Divinus\u201c doesn't have any introductory or orchestral element, it immediately drifts into monstrosity and mischief of the incredibly chilling and striking guitar riff, before being fully enveloped into both rapid, razing blast beats, complemented by interesting and diversifying fills and rolls. Initially more dissonant and experimental, \u201eMesse Noir\u201c also undergoes quite an efficient, enjoyable transformation into absolute barrage and carnage of riffing and drumming.\n\nThe following tracks starting with \u201eOra Pro Nobis Lucifer\u201c do employ some relentment and revision of the medium, with more groovy and mid-paced riffs taking precedence over previous blazing and blasting. \u201eAmen\u201c is more simplistic and organic with some basic riff played with the backing and buoying of some choirs and synthesized ( organ, perhaps ) effects... It is a dash of diversity and drama, instead of overplayed technicality and timidity in songwriting. The title track is a bouncy ballad (although, quite opposite of anything mainstream) with riffs taking the backseat, over some more diverse and gracious drumming patterns, even if simple in vision and execution. The vocals also take a less incomprehensible form, being more of a barking type, and only later transforming and teeming with phlegm and punch. \u201eBen Sahar\u201c further evidences and emphasizes this fixation with more mid-paced material, also taking heavy use of backing accompaniment of a myriad of choirs and orchestrations. \u201eIn the Absence of Light\u201c initially seems like a standard Behemoth routine, but the middle section is practically a poetry recital with some acoustics and string slowly gliding over very steady and serene drumwork. The Final track\u201c O Father O Satan O Sun!\u201c is monolithic and crushing, even if not imposing with speed and intensity. It is a more ritualistic, slowly building mammoth of atmosphere and soundscape, with some very ingenious and gloomy organs and choirs dominating and propelling it. The final moments are perhaps some of the most emotional and breath-taking on the release.\n\nBehemoth have not gone through an actual radical, massive change, but subtlety, variation and distance from their previous outputs is most certainly evident. They offer a number of quite punishing, pummeling tunes, but then couple it with sullen acoustics and sincere vocals, that strand the zone between incomprehensible and almost manly clean, achieving extremity through honesty and integrity, rather then outperforming other artists in terms of speed, stamina or savagery. This is a monumental, must-have morbid record, that isn't perfect on its own, but nevertheless demonstrates and delineates that extreme metal can still be original and oozing with ideas and ingenuity.\n",
        "\nZos Kia Cultus (Here and Beyond) embodies one of the rare instances wherein I find my original appraisal woefully off target. I used to adore this one, but over recent years and through a fresh set of ears no longer as green to the lure of the Polish death metal scene, I found this album depressingly forgettable. Personally, I find Behemoth's transitional period one of dependable caliber and more absorbing from a curiosity standpoint. Pandemonic Incantations linked the band's blackened, raw backbone with a more weighty delivery and benefits greatly from its abnormalities. The often-disregarded Thelema.6 had some issues primarily revolving around the production, but found the band at their most primal and endearing. What was lost between said album and Zos Kia Cultus (Here and Beyond) is difficult to pinpoint at first blush, but this record finds itself functioning as some sort of final stepping stone of sorts that eventually led to Demigod.\n\nHowever, instead of embodying the best of both worlds impression usually granted to bridge-gapping efforts, this just comes off as an inferior precursor to Demigod; similar in cinematic scope at times, but sorely lacking in memorable passages and ideas. To bring up Thelema.6 once more, one could feel the vexation seeping out of unhinged numbers like \"Vinvm Sabbati\" and \"\u03a0\u0391\u039d \u03a3\u0391\u03a4\u03a5\u03a1\u039f\u03a3 (Pan Satyros).\" The occult atmosphere the band is lauded for today was perhaps at its most convincing, and it perfectly exemplified the often overused and frankly abstruse blackened death metal tag. So two years later this album comes down the pike, and suddenly the band is playing flaccid, featureless death metal with meager atmosphere and flat velocity? The hell...\n\nA conundrum indeed, as Havoc and Novy are still here, two forgotten axemen who compiled half of what I believe to be Behemoth's best lineup. Ever seen the live DVD Mother Khaoz on Stage? The band has never come close in the live arena, but it begs the question, how much of a monopoly did Nergal have regarding songwriting duties? A quick glance at the liner notes cites Havoc's only compositional contribution as \"No Sympathy for Fools.\" And guess what? It is the best song here, bringing down the axes as Nergal toils away in the corner hammering away what amounts to a nebulous mass of mid-paced gunk that eventually became Demigod. A worthy effort from a revisionist point of view, but wholly lacking in the massive scope and Phrygian authority later sealed in blood.\n\nZos Kia Cultus (Here and Beyond) is for better or worse modern Behemoth as we know them, replete with the overuse of pinch harmonics and reliance on Nergal's choppy delivery on the mic. What really kills it for me is the lack of gradation regarding tempo and time signature. For example, \"Horns ov Baphomet\" opens the gates in a quite meaty manner, but once the song settles into its groove, eyelids become heavy and many a watch is checked. It is almost as if the same song plays twice, a trend that continues in more instances than I care to count here. \"As Above, So Below\" has a cool stop-start camber along with some swirling tremolos, but even this is just \"okay\" by Behemoth standards. The rest is so faceless it fucking hurts. We still get the overuse of samples and interludes that the band was known for around this period, which only serves as syrup atop what honestly comes close to being a veritable shit sundae at times, especially considering the band's now-proven potential.\n\nIt isn't the worst thing ever, as the production values are stratospheric compared to what came before it, and for those that really dig the Demigod sound (I am on the fence but can appreciate it well enough), this should satiate to a certain point. I just can't recommend this over what came both before and after it, which leaves Zos Kia Cultus (Here and Beyond) out in the cold and an effort best forgotten in the grand scheme. A curiosity piece best left to Behemoth fanboys and those less fortunate who can't appreciate the early material.\n",
        "\nEnergy drink peddler Nergal is back again with 2014's The Satanist, an album a lot of fans/critics are hailing as a \"masterpiece\" from a \"rejuvenated\" band. After hearing the title track and laughing hysterically over how the beginning reminded me of The Monster Mash, I knew this was another sham operation from Behemoth. Even the \"natural and organic\" production Nergal had promised with this album is a lie: more of the same loud, over sampled/triggered drums and sterile guitar tone (is that a Boss Metal Zone pedal?) that the masses have become accustomed to hearing from Behemoth can be found here once again, but with the \"additional instrumentation\" (trumpets, Hammond organ, etc.) more prominent in the mix than the band itself (the end of the single \"Blow Your Trumpets Gabriel\" showcases this). Another vapid lifestyle pandering media product full of watered down later Morbid Angel/Krisiun riffs with mechanical chugging grooves and multi-tracked constipated grunt/shout vocals. It's more mass market Hot Topic \"extreme metal\" of the banal and blast beat ridden variety.\n\nSongs are comprised of fewer parts this time, and while you may think this would mean more focused structuring of the music, the Behemoth trademark of shoving riffs aside for incongruous riffs and switching tempo for no reason makes its return. The same old music is rehashed once again, but this time concessions were made to \"rock\" music fans in the form of \"bluesy\" lead guitar. Ill-fitting Slash styled solos are showcased in these songs (usually over \"anthemic\" chord progressions for maximum stadium rock effect) whenever possible which, alongside the simpler nature of this release (even for Behemoth's lowest common denominator pandering standards), makes this closer to rock music than ever before (the last track eerily reminded me of Silverchair during the stompy part). All of these elements, alongside the \"confrontational\" album title and the regurgitation of past lyrical themes in variant ways (lots of \"ov\" and anti-christian sentiment with mainstream recognizable occult mumbo jumbo) gives this the \"kitsch\" feeling of one of those songs you'd hear at the end of a Scooby-Doo episode given a metal flavoring. Vapid. Avoid.\n",
        "\nBehemoth is an incredibly technical extreme metal band, and for that reason they have been renowned for the past decade or so. Theirs is a special style of extreme metal that has some influences in the band's Polish roots and black metal essence, but it's not really death metal. The newest album comes closer to true black metal, so why have I given it such a mediocre review?\n\nThe reason is that I listen to Behemoth for powerful, technical, creative riffing. In The Satanist we have guitar patterns that almost want to be black metal, but are just too dull and not dark enough to cut it. They're trying to be ominous and evil, but black metal is simplistic for a reason: so that you can focus on the atmosphere and the evil that the music it creates.\n\nBehemoth fails in this attempt, because on top of their guitar parts, they muddle vocals over percussion work and various other instruments. There are precious few guitar solos in this album, and those that do exist are not great compared to what Behemoth can do. If Behemoth focused on the almighty riff a bit more and paid less attention to trying to create an atmosphere--which they aren't pulling off--this album would be far better.\n\nUnfortunately, Behemoth is now at a point in its career when it can rest on the laurels it formed in past albums. Now, Behemoth seems more focused on throwing down (admittedly great) live shows, dressing up in metal clothing and facepaint, and taking threatening videos. They don't have much of a motivation to go back to what made them excellent, which is the almighty riff and drum work that compliments it rather than drowning it out.\n\nThe lyrics are still pretty good, but there's just too much going on in the music for them to really be enjoyed. This album is trying to do far too much at once, and even the masters behind Behemoth can't pull it off. The Satanist has its high points, but it's not what it could be.\n",
        "\nTo me, Behemoth really lost some of their appeal when they decided to drop their earlier, blackened allure for a more streamlined death metal aesthetic. The writing was on the wall as early as Thelema.6, but the parlous genre balancing act present during the mid-period albums really fell by the wayside by the time Demigod swung around. On a surface level, this is certainly heavier than anything the band had committed to disc up to this point, but is that enough to sell an album on it's own? No matter how subsonic and earth-shifting as Nergal's multi-layered roar may be here, this material still pales in primal appeal to Thelema.6, even after taking into account the latter's flagging production.\n\nIf Behemoth gained anything in the downtime between Zos Kia Cultus (Here and Beyond) and Demigod, it was a cinematic scope and more massive-sounding guitars. Despite plenty of quality riffing, the earlier albums almost universally suffered from pretty meager guitar tones. You can go ahead and throw that flaw right out the window, because the guitars here sound rich and meaty; well deserving of the exotic subject matter at hand. Despite the first two tracks featuring an almost identical main riff, Demigod busts out of the gate angrily enough. Dissecting individual riffs is certainly no problem, and most of them slide up and down the phrygian dominant scale, occasionally tacking on a little melodic tail or fluttering tremolo section on the end. The biggest issue manifests itself by the time the listener reaches \"Towards Babylon\", at which point you realize that Demigod is on full-speed for almost the entire duration, never giving the atmosphere a chance to shine through. The only two tracks that are the exception to this rule are the more mid-paced \"Conquer All\" and the enthralling closer \"The Reign ov Shemsu-Hor\", which finally gives the aforementioned cinematic scope a chance to work it's damp sorcery on the listener. \n\nOccasionally you'll get a churning tremolo like on \"Xul\" or some more spirited, controlled chaos like the majority of \"The Nephilim Rising\", but the bottom line is that the entire middle section of Demigod is slowed down by dead weight. Nearly everything between \"Towards Babylon\" and \"Mysterium Coniunctionis (Hermanubis)\" is wholly skippable and unworthy of Behemoth's good name. The Middle-Eastern overtones are also a lot to stomach this time around, almost constantly rearing up and forcing the proceedings into more terse waters that begin to stagnate as the band refuses to vacate and try anything else. Where is the lithe leadwork from \"Vinvm Sabbati\", which served as a much more effective ode to the deities that Behemoth so proudly kneels before? Maybe Havoc's departure forced Nergal to spread himself too thinly here, but the band managed to deliver a significantly heavier crusher in The Apostasy, even under a more sterile production environment. It's nice to see Orion here, but he is an accomplished guitarist in his own right (Vesania) and probably would have served as a better second mind to spark variation on the six-strings other than the faceless Seth. The only member that continues to demolish expectations is Inferno, who has come a long way from his humble beginnings around the Pandemonic Incantations era.\n\nA final note has to be made of \"The Reign ov Shemsu-Hor\", which despite being over eight minutes long, manages to cram in as many interesting ideas as possible - certainly more than the rest of the album combined. The grooving, descending riff around the 2:30 marked with the cymbals fluttering in the background is certainly one of the high points of the album. Everything just moves at a much more structured and less hurried pace. Please Nergal, give us more of that! I understand that Demigod is pretty much universally praised as some landmark of brutality, but are we really that shallow and short sighted on the matter? It certainly has it's moments, but is far from perfect. Get Thelema.6 instead, or give The Apostasy a shot if you are fond of the heavier inclinations being experimented with here.\n",
        "\nThis veteran Polish band have been around for about 23 years and in that time I have not really been real familiar with this band. I have their first full length, Sventevith (Storming Near the Baltic), as well as their previous, Evangelion, but I never jumped on their bandwagon. They began playing black metal and now have a blackened death metal sound to them. The buzz leading up to the release of this album was huge and when it was finally released, I decided to acquire this album to see what all the fuss was about. Good thing I did because I found this album to be a very enjoyable slab of metal that may well just make me go back and look deeper into their previous work. This is a very powerful and emotional album that you can feel when you listen to it. These guys have really pulled something off here and will probably be a contender for album of the year (yeah I know it's kinda early for that).\n\nThe album kicks off with the highly powerful first single, \"Blow Your Trumpets Gabriel\". This song is as epic as you can get with huge doomy riffs that go into some balls to the wall blasts. Nergal's vocals are angry as fuck as he growls not at you but through you. This guy means what he says...period! The leads are far back in the mix on this one but that only adds to the atmosphere of this song. This is a really powerful song and sets the mood for the rest of the album. Songs like \"Furor Divinus\", \"Messe Noire\" and \"Amen\" just keep the momentum going by just being these HUGE fucking songs that you can feel. There are plenty of riffs here from doomy death riffs to some black tremolos as well. The guitar work is done extremely well and the songs are well written.\n\nI need to make special mention of two amazing songs, one of them is \"Ora Pro Nobis Lucifer\". This song if fucking GODLY. It's fast and epic with killer riffs, some great leads and great hooks. Midway through it gets really epic with actual horns, not keyboards but actual trombones, french horns, etc. These guys really went all out to create a memorable song here. The other song is \"O Father O Satan O Sun!\". Holy shit is this song epic. Great riffs with Nergal's angry growls over some great cleans that just pull you into the atmosphere. There's a lead on this album that could have been on any 70s hard rock album and gives this song even more dynamic. At this point I can not be called a big fan of this band because of my lack of familiarity but this is probably one of the best metal songs I've heard in a really long time. As I said, these guys pulled out all the stops.\n\nSo here we have an album that is very close to perfect. It does have a very small cheese factor with the word \"of\" spelled \"ov\" in the lyrics throughout this album but it's not enough to take away from the overall epic sound of this album. This is an album that I like more and more with each listen. It's essential!\n\n\nhttp://elitistmetalhead.blogspot.com/\n",
        "\nThe much awaited successor to 2009\u2019s Evangelion is finally upon us. The Satanist has been in the works for five years, and much has happened to Behemoth in that time. Worth the wait? Absolutely. The Satanist embodies Behemoth at its most progressive, diverse and refined form.\n\nI believe The Satanist to be the beginning of the next stage in Behemoth\u2019s natural evolution. Having seen them on tour in 2013, it was apparent through their setlist choice and stage presence that their emphasis has slightly shifted from the brutality of relentless shredding and blastbeats, to a more atmospheric and theatrical dynamic. In many ways this represents Behemoth\u2019s biggest success; the ability to tastefully balance the old with the new. The Satanist contains the crucial essence of what we have come to expect from a Behemoth record, but leaves ample room for theatrical experimentation. \n\nIt is important to consider that this is Nergal\u2019s first musical outing since his illness and, back stronger and more enlightened than ever, his mentality is reflected in the music. His express desire to no longer compete with other bands and themselves on grounds of technicality and brutality is evident. As he described prior to its release, The Satanist is more organic, more natural than any other Behemoth album since their black metal days. Consequently, the album has a thinner overall sound to it and an almost minimalistic approach. A stylistic continuation of Evangelion\u2019s closing track, Lucifer, slow-to-mid pacing has prominence over much of the record, with several reappearances of eerie spoken word segments. Often categorized as \u2018blackened death metal\u2019 (although largely death metal for the past decade), The Satanist stands out as primarily black metal, where guitar and drum work comes across as more simplistic, atmospheric and hypnotic. \n\nAs one of many stylistic changes, the vocals are no longer thickly layered and distorted. Quite the opposite, Nergal is more easily understood and, at times, even melodic (see O Father O Satan O Sun). This in turn presents its own (small) problem, whereby clunky lyrics are more obvious as in the cases of Furor Divinis (\u201cPluck my eyes out, rip my tongue\u201d) and Ora Pro Nobis Lucifer (\u201cGreat volcano ov excrement... Reconstellate the firmament\u201d). \n\nThe guitars have reverted to a more black metal \u2018fuzziness\u2019 (particularly noticeable in Gabriel and Furor) when contrasted to the clarity of the Demigod-Evangelion era. My biggest gripe with The Satanist would undoubtedly be the solos. Let\u2019s face it, Behemoth is no Necrophagist or Dream Theater; no one listens to Behemoth for the guitar solos (with perhaps the exception of Demigod\u2019s Conquer All and XUL). However, I feel that within The Satanist, the solos are rather uncomplimentary to the prevalent atmosphere and come across as, dare I say, unimaginative (as evidenced in the title track, Messe Noire and Amen). While somewhat disappointing, it does not affect my perception of the overall quality of said songs.\n\nA much welcomed change is the prominence of the bass. Orion\u2019s towering charisma is essential to the band\u2019s stage presence as an unstoppable and powerful force (a \u2018behemoth\u2019, for lack of a better word), and it is long overdue that his contribution to the record reflects that. \n\nPerplexingly, the drums are less distinguished. Considering Inferno\u2019s reputation as a percussive artillery piece, it\u2019s unusual that, for example, the bass drums are harder to isolate (particularly amidst the colossal \u2013 and shiver-inducing - wall of noise at the song\u2019s climax i.e. Gabriel). Further, the toms and the snare lack the impact of previous albums. And similarly to the guitars, Inferno opts for a more tribal, hypnotic and \u2018organic\u2019 rhythm to the songs... again echoing the overarching mantra of atmosphere over technicality/brutality. This is not to suggest that blastbeats have vanished; they are still a central component, just not utilised to excess.\n\nThe introduction of unconventional instrumentation is another welcome stylistic change. French horns, cellos, trombones, trumpets (and even a misplaced saxophone solo) make appearances, mostly to great effect. Taking heed of past successes (notably from Pazuzu and Shemhamforash), the chilling backup vocals/demonic choir further enhance the eerie, cold and depraved atmosphere.\n\nSongs like Furor Divinis (which I would cautiously label a full blown black metal song), Amen and In the Absence Ov Light hark back to a more familiar structure focused on speed and intensity. Likewise, Ora Pro Nobis Lucifer is reminiscent of Satanica\u2019s Chant for Eschaton 2000 and Zos Kia Cultus\u2019s No Sympathy For Fools. More experimental song writing is shown on the remaining tracks; really hitting home on Blow Your Trumpets Gabriel, the title track, and O Father O Satan O Sun, while not as effective on Messe Noire and Ben Sahar.\n\nI would argue that The Satanist is Behemoth\u2019s first concept album, with all songs coherently dealing with similar themes and morals (beyond the usual occultism and blasphemy). A key feature of which is the dichotomy of the Apollonian versus the Dionysian; despising and rebelling against the concept of perfection and embracing the Dionysian (raw instinct and emotion, flaws and failures, chaos and darkness). Furthermore, The Satanist promotes the destruction of social and religious constructs, and any inhibiting values that ultimately undermine our individuality. Behemoth have achieved this, both in the metaphorical sense, and on their own level, breaking free of and expanding their (and indeed our) notion of what a Behemoth song/album should contain. \n\nThrough the events of the past 5 years of life and death, sickness and health, Behemoth have evolved and matured. As musicians, as artists, as philosophers and as humans... and it shows through in the music. Transcending the constructs of genre and society as a whole, Behemoth uncompromisingly fulfils their artistic vision and, in the process, becomes the embodiment of Satanism as the title so boldly proclaims.\n\nHighlights: Blow Your Trumpets Gabriel, Furor Divinis, Ora Pro Nobis Lucifer, The Satanist, In The Absence Ov Light, O Father O Satan O Sun\n",
        "\nDespite quality output early on, it only took Behemoth two albums to realize that traditional black metal wasn't the stylistic avenue they wanted to explore for good. The subsequent paradigm shift had begun in earnest with the Bewitching the Pomerania EP, but it wasn't until Pandemonic Incantations that the potential of such an atypical (for the time) stylistic cross-section featuring middle-eastern undercurrents became glaringly apparent. This is certainly the most obscure roster that has ever assembled under the banner of the dual serpents, featuring then-newcomer Inferno alongside bassist Mefisto (in his only appearance with the band) behind veteran and founder Nergal.\n\nAs per it's enviable location in Behemoth's timeline, Pandemonic Incantations unsurprisingly merges the group's primitive second-wave black metal ambiance with burgeoning death metal ferocity. This is the only Behemoth record of their obscure mid-period in which the band's earlier style still maintains the lion's share of the appeal, and a particularly vile combination of dissonance and crushing tremolo patterns remains after the initial smoke clears. The performance isn't as unhinged as Satanica, but more long-winded and grandiose sounding than Thelema.6 as well, allowing Pandemonic Incantations to slide into the procession nicely, despite being often overshadowed by the attention-hogging Satanica a mere year later.\n\nThe heavier keyboard presence helps add some quick atmosphere, and this practice instantly separates Pandemonic Incantations markedly from the remainder of the band's catalogue. Weltrowski's presence on the ivories is quite subdued on the whole, but peeks over the surface enough to gain an atmospheric foothold during \"The Entrance to the Spheres of Mars\" and the requisite instrumental opener \"Diableria (The Great Introduction)\". The synths emulate true orchestrations more often than not, and are composed with enough care as to not sound overtly cheap or laughable. Behemoth has always been a dead-serious band, and they have always been careful to avoid dragging themselves into the realms of self parody, since their material often straddles the line between the inane and the sublime.\n\nThat said, a particularly coherent animosity is gained during well-armed blackened grinders like \"The Thousand Plagues I Witness\" and \"Satan's Sword (I Have Become)\". Nergal's typical (up to this point) croaking begins to reconstruct itself under more guttural and exhaled guidelines, forming the basis of his now-famous sepulchral bellowing. The two aforementioned tracks fade into each other, forming an incendiary whole that comes full circle not unlike the Ouroboros/Daemon hybrid featured on the front cover. Despite being Inferno's debut with the group, Pandemonic Incantations hardly cranks the dial regarding speed or velocity, as the majority of the album is comfortable within it's upper-midpaced confines, occasionally hitting the brakes to take in the diabolic scenery as the keyboards and dissonant powerchords recharge their misanthropic batteries during obligatory lulls in the action like the more lurching vocal driven passages of \"The Entrance to the Spheres of Mars\" and the majority of the doomy \"Driven by the Five-Winged Star\".\n\nWhile the bulk of the instrumental emphasis is still placed on Inquisition-esque atonal tremolos and wafting blastbeats, Behemoth hints at future greatness through the delivery of great antediluvian lyrics and subtle middle-eastern melodic undertones. It may come off as superficial by modern standards, but during a time when fucking Grom was the most recent and accomplished Behemoth full-length, the stylistic foundation of the band certainly found itself undergoing a major plate shift when Pandemonic Incantations hit the scene; with said album melting both eardrums and expectations with armor piercing rounds like \"With Spell of Inferno\" and \"In Thy Pandemaeternum\", both of which serve as seamless representations of the Thelema.6 style. Surprises lurk around nearly every corner, as even the longest song \"The Past Is Like a Funeral\" surprises near it's end as it delivers an array of Dissection-esque melodic licks. Some sporadically radiated cleaner tones round out the album's eccentricities.\n\nThe universal point is that you never know what to expect, and it comes off as a result of compositional elegance as opposed to desperation in Pandemonic Incantations' high and mighty case. Despite a reliance on some pointless noise passages like the Mortal Kombat-sounding \"Chwa\u0142a mordercom Wojciecha (997-1997 dziesi\u0119\u0107 wiek\u00f3w ha\u0144by)\", this is breathtaking material from beginning to end. The mere fact that it serves as a historical snapshot of Behemoth's rise to death metal super stardom comes second-fiddle to the isolated appeal of Nergal's absolute mastery of atonal black metal riffing. For a band that continues to up the ante regarding their death metal inclinations, Pandemonic Incantations remains the farthest that Behemoth has ever pushed their equally-potent blackened disposition. Will it hold that trophy forever?\n",
        "\nI think we all had a feeling of how this album would sound with \"Lucifer\" being the last track on Evangelion. It definitely hinted at a change in sound for Behemoth, lending itself more to black metal than the last 3 - 6 albums. I find that \"The Satanist\" is probably they're most black metal influenced album since Pandemonic Incantations. \n\nJust to point a few things out, I have read several times that \"The Satanist has a weak production\" or \"a more commercial production\". How in god's name do people hear that in this? Fuck knows, 'cause this is one heavy, bordering on 'wall of noise' album. The production is amazing. It's crisp, it's full and it is no way over-produced. This is a brilliant change from... well all of Behemoth's albums in the last 15 years. For me, they have always been too softly produced, or just have quite a boring tone in general. Another big change for the band other than production is the songwriting. The songs are written in a far more \"progressive\" and in an all in all more interesting and less predicable way than previous efforts. For example \"In the Absence of Light\" is written in a very odd and fresh way. The song stops and slows right down twice; the first time being soft and atmospherically focused, the second more focused on the heavy deliverance of the bass and drums. This is one of my favourite songs on the album, as it is a good representation of the albums strengths.\n\nHere are the negatives for the album. Nergal's vocals are brilliant!... Most of the time. Unfortunately I did not appreciate the vocal direction he went with in the songs \"The Satanist\" and \"Oh Father, Oh Satan,Oh Sun!\". Nergal's patterns seem to have rock influence in them and this is where I feel the album is trying to be a bit more commercial. They sound strained and awkward and I just don't think they fit at all with the swing of the rest of the album. Another thing I feel I must comment on is the god awful guitar wank in \"Messe Noire\". This is a shitty hard rock solo that destroys the last third of what would have been one of my favourite tracks on the album, not to mention it's way too fucking long. This wankery reappears a few times, but not song breaking amounts of it.\n\nThough there are a few negatives for \"The Satanist\", it is a rather good album, with a few excellent songs. The major strengths of this album lie in the production, the atmosphere and the general new and unique direction Nergal has taken Behemoth. This shows promise for the bands future as the beast progresses and explores new territory, even if not always for the best.\n\nStandout tracks - Furor Divinus, Amen, In the Absence Ov Light, Blow Your Trumpets Gabriel\n",
        "\nBehemoth's cryptic mid-period reached new points of vacuous, discursive inanity with Satanica, which despite a few soaring highlights fell prey to it's own misdirected vitriol and was all but neutered by staggering production imbalances. Even more jaw-dropping is the high status said album has received regarding public opinion, a standing that 2000's Thelema.6 does not share with it despite reflecting an improvement in nearly every area sans production. Despite it's public image as the poster child of mid-period Behemoth quirkiness, Thelema.6's eclectic nature belies it's vulgar intentions as the first solid output in what has in hindsight become the modern Behemoth formula.\n\nTo address the production right away, Thelema.6 embodies a similar -albeit slightly more coherent- amalgam of overly-processed drums and compressed swells of distortion just like Satanica before it. Despite his usual frenetic delivery, Inferno's kit sounds irritatingly artificial and plastic. The kit as a whole pitter-patters away akin to a drum machine, especially regarding the dry thumping of the double-bass. It almost passes muster by virtue of the hollow, sterile sonic aesthetics purported by Thelema.6 as a whole, but it is certainly a jarring experience if one jumps right into this after experiencing Behemoth's more recent odes to misanthropy like Evangelion or even The Satanist.\n\nThe guitars take less sonic damage than the drums, but are still thin and clash with the primal subject matter being espoused by Nergal's vicious roars. The lead sounds passably ripe, but the rhythm is pretty muffled and indistinct, rightfully overshadowed by Novy's vehement bass timbre. The overall tone of the album is quite insulated and antiseptic sounding, which is neither here nor there from a stylistic point of view and remains the biggest hurdle the listener must vault to fully appreciate the material.\n\nSongwriting is much more compact and virulent than Satanica, or hell even most other modern Behemoth output. The misanthropic trio of \"Antichristian Phenomenon\", \"Pan Satyros\", and \"Christians to the Lions\" are all modern classics that have been swept under the proverbial rug and forgotten in light of more recent hits like \"Conquer All\" and \"Slaves Shall Serve\". Thelema.6's true primal appeal is best viewed in the live arena, during which one can genuinely judge the veracity of these compositions. The sporadic technical eruptions set alongside the bulldozer-esque crawling intro of \"Antichristian Phenomena\" evoke portentous mental images that go straight for the jugular. Despite the tiny guitar tone, Nergal and Havoc make the most out of their limited arsenal, crafting some neck-jerking grooves alongside the automatic gunfire of Inferno's double-bass like on the end of \"The Universe Illumination\".\n\nThat's not to shortchange the rest of Thelema.6, most of which maintains stratospheric levels of vitriol, with \"Inflamed With Rage\" and \"Natural Born Philosopher\" both boasting particularly high body counts, even amongst such elite company. This is easily the angriest, most animalilstic Behemoth album, even if the delivery and execution are both lopsided. Even the more experimental numbers like \"Inauguration of Scorpio Dome\" manage to impress on an eclectic level, as the shorter average track length precludes the accretion of anything even approaching stagnation. The middle-eastern overtones that were more prominent on Pandemonic Incantations are notably scaled back, serving as a more tertiary supplement as opposed to a main stylistic cog.\n\nWith Behemoth's decision to move away from this indignant formula and toward more epic waters on Zos Kia Cultus (Here and Beyond), Thelema.6 has become something of a red-headed step child amongst the band's discography and is often disregarded as such while the inferior Satanica gets a free pass. I rarely count myself amongst the minority regarding my opinion of Behemoth's work, but Thelema.6 is a malicious shot in the arm of an album that will waste no time in changing your mind as well.\n",
        "\nI write this review trying not to be biased or as many people would call a \"fanboy\" towards Behemoth's music since I am a huge fan of their discography. It has been a while since their last release due to Nergal's diagnosis with cancer so of course I don't blame them for the wait. Since Demigod was released I never expected another one of their albums to fall into comparison to to it, but I can say with all honestly i have been proven wrong.\n\nFirst off, the first thing I realized right off the bat was the improvement of Nergal's vocals. I was completely blown away by his delivery and still am every time a replay the album. Over all of their discography I have never heard so much emotion in his voice before. There are points in this album like for example on \"Messe Noire\" where the vocals seem so passionate that it almost seems like Nergal is gonna cry, but this emotion provides for one of my favorite aspects of the whole album. As for the lyrics I've always found Behemoth's lyrics very interesting, some times I can decipher them and other times they are way past me and this album is another example of that.\n\nThe instruments on this album were great as well for me. Inferno has never disappointed me on a single album, and at this album being a bigger step into the black metal genre he still managed to implement some great drumming besides just typical blast beats you would hear on a regular black metal album. Orion's bass work was also top notch as well and through the great production on the album i could hear it much clearer then on past albums. The guitar work on this album was overall good, there weren't really any real original riffs coming from it. But some of the soloing however was pretty fun to listen to like on \"Messe Noire\" or the title track where they actually used some pentatonic scales in it too. The use of Saxophone on \"In the Absence Ov Light\" turned out surprisingly good and i think its safe to say that's the first use of a saxophone in black metal. Overall the atmosphere of the album is fantastic. I noticed some ambient vocals too in some of the tracks like \"Amen\" and the title track. This seemed to add more of a haunting quality to the album as well. The last track on the album \"O Father O Satan O Sun!\" had some amazing back choir following Nergal's vocals which turned out to be one of the most memorable parts of the album.\n\nAs far as complaints I have only a few for this album. Like i said before i wish some of the guitar riffs were more original, and some of the solos in the album weren't that good. The song structure on \"Blow your Trumpets Gabriel\" I found was a little goofy too but an overall great song. The whole Satanism lyricism is a bit redundant, but they did seem to have a great take on it.\n\nOverall this will probably hold to be the album of the year for me, but never say never. Every track on this album I found to be original and not a spot on the whole album bored me. The vocals on the album were godly, the instruments provided a great atmosphere and still gave room for Inferno's talent to show itself like it always has. I cannot say enough good things about this album, it makes me truly proud to be a metal head.\n",
        "\n\u201cThe Satanist\u201d is the tenth album by Polish black/death metal legends Behemoth, and the first since Vocalist/Guitarist Nergal\u2019s recovery from his battle with leukaemia. In the wake of this immense struggle, they have come back with a real point to prove, and as such they have created their most mature, complete and ambitious album to date \u2013 this is the first truly great metal album of 2014, and is possibly the best album Behemoth have ever made. It\u2019s epic in scope, brutally heavy, atmospheric and varied in equal measure.\n\nNergal\u2019s powerful roar is in full force throughout the album, giving one of the most powerful and vicious performances in extreme metal of recent years, particularly on \u201cMesse Noir\u201d, where he roars and snarls his way throughout in the most evil of manners, fitting the satanic lyrics perfectly. His personal struggles over the last few years have really injected him with a huge passion and energy which shines through on every facet of his performance, from his voice, to his guitar work and incredible lyrics.\n\nThe album is filled with absolutely crushing riffs, with a lot of variety, with \u201cAmen\u201d taking inspiration from the brutal fury of Marduk, while \u201cFuror Divinis\u201d has a cold and frosty wall of noise style reminiscent of early Mayhem, and \u201cBen Sahar\u201d has a slower, chugging opening riff demanding you to bang your head.There\u2019s also melody to be matched with the fury, with \u201cOra Pro Nobis\u201d having catchy epic sounding riffs, in a style similar to Austria\u2019s Belphegor. The lead guitar work throughout the album is also incredible, with blistering solos, especially the epic sounding one from \u201cMesse Noir\u201d which is simply perfect. With all these influences they create a sound entirely their own, with sporadic symphonic sections adding to the drama of the album, especially on the epic opener \u201cBlow Your Trumpets Gabriel\u201d, a song with fantastic imagery and drama, a true evil and plodding masterpiece, with slower crushing riffs. \u201dAmen\u201d is by far the heaviest track, with blistering riffs, an unrelenting blastbeat fury, and a snappy gnarly bass tone, its a perfectly brutal and unrelenting piece of satanic fury.\n\nThe lyrics are also fantastic throughout the album. As the title would suggest, the album is based around Satanism, which is something of a clich\u00e9 when it comes to extreme metal, but Behemoth write about it excellently, with intelligent, thoughtful lyrics. The booklet in the album has descriptions of the songs, and the band reference writers such as Milton, Nietzsche, Witold Gombrowicz and more. The band also claims that the album is titled \u201cThe Satanist\u201d as it deals with the human elements of Satanism, the way it affects and manifests itself within us. The concept of the album is definitely intriguing and intelligently written. Not just going for shock value and an attempt at an evil aesthetic like lots of other bands before them, they really have an excellent approach to the subject here.\n\nThis approach is at its best on the closer, \u201cO Father O Satan O Sun!\u201d with the song being one of the best tributes to Satan in metal\u2019s history which really says a lot. The imagery is just incredibly powerful and evil, and its a perfect track to close an incredible album. This segment from it is particularly powerful when matched with Nergal\u2019s passionate roar:\n\n\u201cO Father\nO Satan\nO Sun\nLet the children come to Thee\nBehold the Morning Star\nAkephalos\nShine thru me\nCome forth in war\nCome forth in peace\u201d\n\nThe CD also comes with a bonus DVD, containing a fantastic concert \u201cLive Barbarosa\u201d filmed in Russia, as well as a thirty minute documentary, with Nergal\u2019s thoughts on the concepts behind \u201cThe Satanist\u201d. The booklet is also filled with descriptions of each song and the themes behind it, as well as the lyrics, it is a really complete package.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just another blackened death metal album, here Behemoth have really delivered an intense work, filled with fantastic music and imagery. This is their most mature and complete album to date, and is sure to be one of the metal albums of the year, if not the decade. It\u2019s an absolute masterpiece of extreme metal, and mixes bludgeoning heaviness with intelligent lyrics and musical nuance that goes far beyond their peers, and cements their place as one of the most important bands in contemporary extreme metal. Every track is just brilliant, there\u2019s no room for any filler.With over twenty years of recording history and ten albums its really incredible that they can still release an album so sincere, breathtaking and monumental, \u201cThe Satanist\u201d is simply a real behemoth of an album (sorry!)\n\nOriginally written for swirlsofnoise.com\n",
        "\nWithout music, life would be a mistake\n\nIf you haven\u2019t heard of Behemoth by this point you\u2019re either new here or are that guy who claims to be a metalhead while proclaiming Tool as the heaviest and most technical thing to grace the musical world. Over the last 23 years, Behemoth has established itself as a powerhouse in the world between black and death metal. Five years after their last record, Evangelion was released, we are met with the newest from Behemoth, The Satanist. A massive success on the charts right out of the gates, The Satanist is looking to be Behemoth\u2019s most successful record yet. Musically, a movement has been made pushing the focus of the band back towards their original black metal roots while maintaining a strong death metal presence. \n\nJumping straight into things with the first track, \u201cBlow Your Trumpets Gabriel\u201d. It starts off interesting enough, a reasonably catchy intro that starts off slow and doomy building up at an agonizing rate to peak somewhere over the two minute mark, where the song breaks with a nice bass fill that drops into something that should awaken the listener, assuming they started to drift off at some point during the last few minutes of the exact same riff being played. The song ends fairly aggressively only to fall back into the same agonizing pace a few tracks later. It\u2019s like listening to someone slowly flatline with the occasional palpitation to keep things moving. \u201cFuror Divinus\u201d is actually one of the strongest tracks off the album. It maintains an aggressive feel that really does a great job of accelerating the pace of record, which is not a job the second track should have. \n\nThe most frustrating part of all of this is the fact that there are a lot of really strong musical elements that I really enjoy. The really thick, growling bass tones that are worked into the tracks are great! You can actually hear what Orion is doing and I love it! Then you get the horn section playing for a brief time on the track that you would assume should have horns. I actually really liked the addition of the brass work into it all because were it not in there, that track would have probably lost all of my interest and then put me completely to sleep. The presence of instruments that aren\u2019t usually seen in this kind of extreme music was rather refreshing, albeit bittersweet since it was so short lived. Maybe that was just me hoping to hear some crazy brass work after it having been done so well by Cephalic Carnage a few years back. Half way through \u201cIn the Absence ov Light\u201d we are met with an absence ov music while a spoken word sample takes over. Again, bittersweet moments here. The whole spoken word thing was pretty intense the first time with the return of some sexy sax work making the track feel like we were in some dark, late 90\u2019s coffee shop listening to bad poetry. After a few more listens, the whole thing quickly began feeling like a sort of crutch, like the Behemoth version of breakdowns. They even use another version of spoken word breakdowns on the next track! Better yet, they didn\u2019t even transition out of it well, either! The second the guy was done talking, they immediately go back to full throttle blasting that we\u2019d seen just scarcely by this point. Where is the musical prowess in that? There are millions of ways to have moved out of the spoken word section that would have made sense and not been so abrupt. Perhaps with some more of the doomy bass and drum work that they didn\u2019t abuse whatsoever throughout the entirety of the record as is. \n\nAfter being around for so long, you\u2019d think that Behemoth would have a stronger grasp on the musical concepts that define the genre they\u2019re working in. I get trying to push the boundaries and be edgy and avant-garde, but they were way off the mark here. There seemed to be so much emphasis on \u2018artistry\u2019 and image that they lost sight of the fact that there is far more to the actual music. You can take all the artistic liberties you want with your music, but that does not mean they\u2019ll go over well with your fan base, who are your fans for the simple reason that they love the direction you\u2019d been going in. If you disagree here then you should go take a listen to Illud Divinum Insanus. There is plenty of artistic liberty being taken there, but I\u2019ve never seen an album go over that poorly with fans. When it comes down to it, there are really strong aspects of this record that are overshadowed by the sub-par writing and over emphasis on image. I enjoyed it for the most part, but quickly forgot most of the tracks and walked away feeling like I was missing something. The record doesn\u2019t stick with you, it doesn\u2019t grab you by the shirt and beat you into submission like a proper death metal record should do. I understand the move towards the avant-garde and different, but this was a pretty strong miss for me. \n\nhttp://themetalreview.com/albums/behemoth/\n",
        "\nA total must for every Behemoth fan to obtain. While Satanica was pretty much a straightforward death metal fest, Thelema.6 shines through great variety within rhythmic structures, riffing, bass playing and of course Inferno's blast drumming.\n\nThe whole album feels like Nergal and cohortes decided to define their sound more closely. The rhythm changes may sound weird and unexpected sometimes, but it actually works great on songs like \"Antichristian Phenomenom\" or \"Natural Born Philosopher\". Other utensiles like clean voice or acoustic guitar solos add perfectly to the dark atmosphere, while those elements are never overdone and put in very decently. The finisher \"23 (The Youth Manifesto)\" makes a perfect closer on this album as well as on concerts, shining through a strongly progressive touch and slow down in pace, while Nergal just holds a kind of speech to his listeners. \n\nBut there's also a mentionable amount of lesser experimental tracks, ready to make you go nuts and destroy your neck. Songs like \"Pan Satyros\" or the infamous \"Christians to the Lions\" sound just like Behemoth are known for in todays times, being strong representatives for their coming sounds. Fast, forward guitar work and insane blastbeat / doublebass drums, accompanied by Nergals harsh growling vocals.\n\nAnother great thing about this album is the presence of the bass. Novy does a great job slapping and pulling the heck out of his instrument, plus the production allowing him to be clearly audible most of the time. A negative thing to mention about the production my be that it sounds very thin and clinical, expecially leaving the guitar with much less volume than on Satanica. This may also be the reason of the impression that the songs on Thelema.6 lack substance compared to its predecessor and follow-up album. \n\nSong recommendations: Pan Satyros, Natural Born Philosopher, Christians to the Lions, 23(The Youth Manifesto)\n",
        "\nWhile many reviews point on Thelema.6 to be some kind of experiment album, pretty much the same could be said about this one, only with one difference: there is almost nothing memorable about Zos Kia Cultus. The whole album sounds like having been recorded right after some jam sessions, it's repetitive and tries to shine through technical diversity rather than songwriting.\n\nThe guitar work, although technically flawless, doesn't provide chugs and riffs to headbang to. It's all pretty generous and just meh. The solos sometimes work and sometimes don't. On \"Here And Beyond\" it just seems to be thrown in there randomly, while in \"Zos Kia Cultus\" (argueably the strongest song on the album), it blends in perfectly with the overall atmosphere.\nAs another letdown from its predecessor, the bass drafts back into the shadows, being totally dominated by guitars and drums. Yes, this album has made a great step towards death metal.\n\nListening throughout the album, the songs permanently change from listenable to totally forgettable. There is barely variety within the songwriting, the only exceptions for me being the opener, \"As Above So Below\" and \"Zos Kia Cultus\". Those songs show Inferno slowing down a bit and focusing on rhythm and Nergal not trying too hard, instead leaving the guitar work relatively simple, with decent and well placed solos. Most of the other songs could well be just cut together to one long track. It just stays the same: blasts - chug riffs and random solos - more blasts. \n\nThe skits try to add to the atmosphere with some gloomy cult impressions, but fail precisely because the other songs don't get anywhere near that kind of theme. Instead the listener is exposed to heavily Nile-inspired, random chugging, often too fast drumming and unvaried growls. This \ngets complimented by a bone dry production that doesn't serve such a themed album at all. It basically only makes sense if you imagine Demigod to come after it.\n\nAll in all, this should only be a concern to Behemoth fans. Everyone else, stick with Nile and cohortes. Because this is just trying too hard to be too brutal, and it didn't work often enough.\n\nSong recommendations: As Above So Below, Zos KIa Cultus\n",
        "\nThe Satanist is the long-awaited tenth album of Behemoth. Five years have passed since Evangelion came out and Nergal has since then trumped death and defeated leukaemia. An impressive feat, to say the least. Looking back a little, Demigod was a huge renaissance for the band in 2004 and it totally floored me the first time I heard it back the - it sounded like nothing else I\u2019ve heard before - and in that sense it has some similarities to this album.\n\nYou could call The Satanist a second renaissance, which takes the musical concept of Behemoth into another new direction. These tendencies were hinted at during the more epic-sounding moments of Evangelion and to me personally, this development is both positive and negative. I think the grandiose, horn-laden Blow Your Trumpets Gabriel is absolutely phenomenal with its sort of progressive, yet insanely heavy, black metal structure. There is a large sense of build-up in the song and when it eventually reaches its climax I get goose bumps almost every time. \n\nAnother thing I really like is the sort of primal black metal feeling to some of the riffs in songs such as Furor Divinus and Amen. To me, it sounds like Nergal had Mayhem\u2019s Deathcrush on repeat while writing some of the stuff here. And just in the same way that Nergal excellently composes build-up and structure in the individual songs, the album slowly builds up against its climax, O Father O Satan O Sun! It\u2019s an epic song in the same spirit as Lucifer, which closed the last album, and although it\u2019s not the most brutal song on the album I can\u2019t do anything but surrender to the great melodies, the epic feeling and Nergal\u2019s fantastic vocals.\n\nI have two main objections with this album. First and foremost, the production just sounds too weak. It is way more of a commercially viable production than they\u2019ve been going for earlier, and I imagine that this album could attract people who aren\u2019t really into this type of music otherwise - but in my opinion, there is not really any brutality in the sound, which is a shame. The prime example of this is the title track with its rock groove and while, granted, it\u2019s a decent song with a really powerful chorus, there\u2019s a fine line between accessible and too accessible. And I\u2019m not really sure on which side of that line to place some of the stuff from The Satanist.\n\nListening to The Satanist on its own, I kind of tolerate the flaws in the production and the sort of hit-feeling in some of the songs. I mean, yes, Conquer All from Demigod is as close to a death/black metal hit song as you possibly get but you still feel kind of assaulted after listening to it. When listening to The Satanist immediately after Demigod, The Apostasy or Evangelion there is something I\u2019m missing. That insane power from those albums - that in-your-face, relentless force that I loved is sadly absent. However, although I maybe won\u2019t be listening to The Satanist a lot in the future, I think there\u2019s a huge audience for it out there.\n\nOriginally written for www.metalcovenant.com\n",
        "\nThe Satanist was a bit of a stunner for me, because I've never been the most vocal advocate of Behemoth. I like a lot of their albums, sure, from both the earlier black metal period and the transition into a more mainlined brutality, but there has long been this sort of vibe rolling off generation Hot Topic that this is somehow the greatest band since, like, Pantera. That their albums and videos have achieved some form of death metal nirvana, reflected through their successful tours, sales, and at in their home country of Poland, a sense of mainstream legitimacy that few extreme metal acts could claim. This is not necessarily any fault of the band, which works hard and puts out a consistent level of product; but if I'm being truthful, it's difficult for me to think of Behemoth as this messianic (or anti-messianic) force in metal. Though I've bought and enjoyed a number of their post transition records from the late 90s and beyond, I find them little more than a re-branding of aesthetics already present in bands like Morbid Angel, Deicide, Vader, Marduk, Dark Funeral and Krisiun. Maybe they have better stage costumes and makeup department, maybe they've got better art direction packaging on their albums, and surely Nergal is far more consumed by occultism than a lot of the death metal diocese which would claim otherwise, but the fact is that most of their music blasts straight into one ear and out the other...\n\nNot the case for The Satanist, which has been for me the first instance in which Behemoth truly lives up to the surrounding hype; an album that is not only phenomenally well-written, but boasts production standards that crush the fucking sun. Not a major stylistic deviation from their last few discs, but the plotting here at long last seems to translate into an actual slew of songs that I feel like listening to repeatedly, which is more than I could say for stuff like Evangelion, which possesses a proficient, punishing quality that seems to plateau at 'good', eluded by 'greatness' and only ever broken out when I want a reliable, indistinct bludgeoning. The Satanist is just such a more well-rounded experience...blast beats are weighted off against genuine moments of poignant atmosphere and restraint. Individual tunes are distinguishable from one another, and after hearing one I couldn't quite put my finger on what would happen in the next. The death and black metal genre tropes which have shaped Nergal's career are more evenly balanced, and the robust production aesthetics and the precision instrumentation have just never sounded better. While The Satanist is still not a perfect outing, and leaves some area for further expansion, it oozes conviction from every pore. We all know Darski had a rough spell health-wise, but that this is a testament to his survival gives it all the more impact. Coming back stronger and superior is after all a chief virtue of Satanic self-enlightenment, and so I'm not at all surprised he chose the absurd profundity of its overt title.\n\nAt any rate, much of the album is still a locomotive of seamless blasted structures which weave together the resonant tremolo picking and mildly dissonant chord choices, ominous octave chords sliding around the underbelly of hellish beats and Nergal's powerful if not entirely nasty sounding growls. If you were worried that the advance snippets of \"Blow Your Trumpets Gabriel\" somehow lacked the intensity you'd come to expect, tracks like \"In the Absence ov Light\" or \"Amen\" make short work of the assumption like a hurricane whipping through a field of origami blossoms. The bass tone on the album deserves particular praise, it's just so fat and voluptuous and only ever loses some presence when the band is blasting full force, but there is just never a moment where the compositions feel 'empty' or lacking...layers of rhythm guitars or wailing and blustering lead passages always arrive, or tempo shifts where that fat, fat low end starts pummeling into your imagination like an infernal juggernaut. The ambient orchestration that both sets up \"Blow Your Trumpet Gabriel\" into those enormous riffs, and returns, even more horrifying in the bridge, was the perfect touch to balance out what are occasionally average chord choices. In fact, I wish this had occurred more often through The Satanist than it did, but thankfully the record is ridiculously effective regardless.\n\nLyrically, it's not a departure from anything else Behemoth has done in the last 15 years, but as with the mix on the bass, the vocals are just gruesome and over the top. You can feel the guy barking his guts out as he drives all the evil ego-tripping home. He sounds revitalized, recharged, and though I doubt the purpose of an album like this is 'fun', that is ultimately the effect of such a visceral, convincing performance. Their albums have always had that sense of entertaining intimidation. 'Look how fast we can play! Look how great we look! Look how comfortable we are in our wicked skins!' But then I'd put on one of the better efforts from Lost Soul, Calm Hatchery, Decapitated or almost anything from Vader and smirk at how much more I preferred their songwriting capabilities. Suddenly, Nergal and company belong amongst that crowd. Not that they weren't already a more smashing financial success, enjoying a level of popularity flush with Morbid Angel, Cannibal Corpse, Cradle of Filth and Dimmu Borgir, but I can no longer safely relegate them aside to the ranking of 'overrated', or dismiss them like a snob. This is a genuinely excellent album, both in appearance and sound, caving in my skull nine times straight and making everything before it seem like the warmup. There is still a distance to go before I can hail a Behemoth disc as a masterpiece for all the ages, but The Satanist at least flirts with that idea, and inspires belief beyond barren praise.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nAfter five years Behemoth releases their tenth album \u2018\u2019the Satanist\u2019\u2019 which is not what I was expecting, but they still managed to surprise me with a well-crafted and honest work.\n\nThe general feeling in this album is darker than their previous works; it has an obscure halo with great atmospheres and great harmony, the bass guitar has distinguished arrangements that seem great figures. Orion\u2019s work is more distinguished compared to previous albums. Nergal\u2019s and Seth\u2019s guitars are great, they sound wholesome and they make killer riffs that create a perfect combination between black and death metal. Trumpets and French horns top it all off making the work feeling evil and elegant at the same time. What does not strike me is that the band put aside the heavy dragged riffs or kind of break downs that they used to play in tracks like the end of \u2018\u2019Daimonos\u2019\u2019. Those riffs are a great contribution for their music from my point of view, but this album can compensate with the dark atmosphere that I already mentioned.\n\n\u2018\u2019Blow your Trumpets Gabriel\u2019\u2019 for me it was not a great opener: songs like \u2018\u2019Daimonos\u2019\u2019 in \u2018\u2019Evangelion\u2019\u2019, or \u2018\u2019Sculpting the Throne of Seth\u2019\u2019 in \u2018\u2019Demigod\u2019\u2019 are way more effective and victorious! That song would have worked great as a third track. We can find more black metal influence in themes like the faster \u2018\u2019Furor Divinus\u2019\u2019 or the occult and passionate \u2018\u2019Messe Noir\u2019\u2019. But it was tracks \u00b4\u00b4Amen\u00b4\u00b4 and \u00b4\u00b4In the Absence of Light\u00b4\u00b4 that I find more brutal with heavy blasts, furious riffs, and creepy desolating interludes. Lyrics are exceptional in this album it seems to attack not only Christianity, but Judaism and islam too, the diseases that break the human apart from their own selves. And, has many mythological aspects, is interesting to note that the \u2018\u2019sun \u2018\u2019 is frequently mentioned maybe as the meaning of god who represents the oppression. I can conclude it can be metaphors of common sense against stupidity, the arrival of your joy and your consciousness.\n\nThe full of adrenaline\u2018\u2019Ora Pro Nobis Lucifer\u2019\u2019 and the imperial \u2018\u2019Ben Sahar\u2019\u2019 will remind you they still hold the scepter in this industry. Something that I find weird was the track title \u2018\u2019The Satanist\u2019\u2019 the details in the bass and the drum rolls arrangements are cool, but it has this rock and roll chorus in a black metal aspect. At the end \u2018\u2019O father O Satan O Sun\u2019\u2019 is a great final for the album, all the instruments make a good combination to sound with more profound intensity in a melancholic environment, is a different track than other behemoth stuff and is awesome. \n\nIn essence, Behemoth is offering something different, but their trademark is there, it seems they just found the way to express their emotions on this album better. My only complaint is the absence of heavy dragged riffs. Nergal voice sounds deeply convincing. I believe that after listening to this album more than once you can get completely absorbed in the message and emotions that they want to communicate through the music as a meaning of translation it. In one word enjoy it!\n",
        "\nI have a love/hate relationship with Behemoth. Some of the work they have done is undeniably outstanding, while on the other hand their more recent work has been a pretty big miss with me. Where did it all go wrong?\n\nTo me, Demigod is the last truly great Behemoth album. I remember really enjoying that record when it came out, almost as much Zos Kia Cultus which came before it. They had the energy, the drive, the motivation and the most importantly, the riffs to drive their music across, not shying from using sheer power and force to suck you in.\n\nWhat we have now seems to be a mere shadow of what was once a great band. It sounds like Behemoth are trying too hard to be Behemoth, if that makes sense. After being somewhat let down by \u201cThe Apostasy\u201d (it had a hard album to follow) and even more let down by \u201cEvangelion\u201d, I was expecting greatness this time. \n\nSo why is \u201cBlow Your Trumpets Gabriel\u201d such a snooze fest? It sounds like it\u2019s on the right path with an intro which is clearly classic Behemoth, yet it takes the song over two minutes to kick in properly, and when it does, it just sounds like a mess. I absolutely hate the mix on this album \u2013 the guitars sound like shit, you can\u2019t hear the bass, and even the vocals seem to be recorded underwater or something. If this is the return of Behemoth, then oh dear. This is not what I would call a good start.\n\nThe next track however, \u201cFuror Divinus\u201d somewhat redeems the first track. At least it has some sort of pace to it, something to say. It\u2019s nothing I would call great, but it\u2019s not bad either.\n\nAfter somewhat painfully plodding through the next few tracks, the problems with the album become quite clear. First of all, it sounds like shit. No, it\u2019s not my headphone setup. If my Fiio DAC and Shure SE535\u2019s can\u2019t make it sound good, then it just simply doesn't sound good. If you were to put this CD in your car, it would probably sound like elephants having sex. Second, the album seems to be lacking in riffs. You know, actual riffs, which drive a song forward and stick in your head. The riffing here is very basic, more atmospheric rather than actual, solid rhythms. It\u2019s just not a style I enjoy or find interesting.\n\nI know I will get blasted for the next reason, and that\u2019s the vocals. Nergal\u2019s vocals are actually annoying the shit out of me now. He sounds like a mix of a hardcore screamer, and a black metal screecher . In short, he just sounds like shit. It sounds so pseudo \u201ctough guy\u201d that at times it just becomes downright annoying. Maybe it\u2019s a good thing that the album sounds like it was recorded in a fucking volcano somewhere, as I believe the engineer forgot to turn the fucking reverb down somewhere along the way. Or maybe it was done on purpose and the boys thought it sounded cool and eerie \u2013 well it doesn't it just sounds fucking stupid, and even with a $1000 setup I can\u2019t make out what\u2019s going on half the time. \n\nThe more I listen to it, the more certain things start to annoy me. Like, stop spelling \u201cof\u201d incorrectly. The V and F keys are very close to the keyboard, perhaps it was just a typo back in the day and they thought it sounded more kvlt or something. But it doesn't. It just sounds fucking stupid. If it has some other purpose besides sounding fucking retarded, then someone please enlighten me. Though I\u2019m quite sure it\u2019s just an effort to appear more kvlt. Thing is, the joke or whatever it is wore off a long time ago. Now you just appear to be three dudes dressed in clothes no one wears anymore, paints their faces, and can\u2019t even spell.\n\nTo top it all off, the riffs simply aren't that good. Just not good enough. For the most part, it just sounds like Morbid Angel worship. The guitars are nowhere near interesting enough, the bass is in the somewhere - if you strain for it than you can hear it. But when you do, unfortunately it's nothing special. The only acceptable part about these songs are the drumming - yet sadly, just good drum playing does not make good songs.\n\nBehemoth seems to be focusing more on their costumes and photo shoots rather than writing actual good songs people can remember, which is a shame. Maybe there are some songs on here that will pass for good, problem is, you can\u2019t hear them properly. Kind of like what happened to Deicide\u2019s \u201cTill Death Do Us Part\u201d \u2013 that album just sounded like total shit, no amount of good songs could redeem it. Kind of the same thing here.\n\nIt really is disappointing. Right after I gave this album its final spin after spending about a week of my time on it, I put on \u201cDecade of Therion\u201d and was blown away. Clear, concise, proper song writing. No gimmicks and idiotic sections which only distract the listener. The only redeeming quality on this album is Inferno\u2019s drumming. Too bad it\u2019s mostly lost in a sea of bland riffs, amateurish orchestral sections and that shitty sound which they've adopted.\n\nSuch a shame. \u201cThe Apostasy\u201d, \u201cEvangelion\u201d and now \u201cThe Satanist\u201d.. that\u2019s three strikes in a row, Behemoth.\n",
        "\n\"The Satanist\" is the portal into which Behemoth's evolution, trials, tribulations, and triumphs all remain in dark meditation. I won't exhaust the long list of issues that landed the group in a state of dormancy for several years, but traces of Behemoth\u2019s journey are more evident than ever throughout \"The Satanist,\" which is an extremely significant restoration in both sound and style. I've always held the band's black metal releases above \"The Apostasy\" and other records based more on the foundations of death metal, but \"The Satanist\" stands with a profound element of power with more dynamism than their other works. \"The Satanist\" is a superb blend of Behemoth's musical evolution through growth and distress, towering in a renewed sense of vitality. It is exceptional work. \n\n\"The Satanist\" is a synthesis of Behemoth's various eras yet something beyond them all; rebirth, a theme not foreign to the group, gives way to what is definitely the most profound musical direction of any testament before it. The black metal elements make a dramatic presence in the death metal spine, returning Behemoth to a form that would fit more in the vein of God Dethroned or Belphegor than, say, the Nile-ish works of yesteryears\u2014the strengthening of these elements leads to an incredibly passionate and artistic assault. It's essentially a masterful culmination of all faces and masks worn by the band, led by the epic march of doom of \"O Father O Satan O Sun!\" and followed closely by \"In the Absence ov Light,\" a sinister onslaught of dark atmosphere and ferocious riffing.\n\nBut I can't in good conscience downplay the rest of the record: the other songs dawn on a new age for Behemoth that eclipses most of their prior releases. Everything \"The Satanist\" offers makes it a massacre of blasphemous blasting, starting strong with the macabre atmosphere of the boiling \"Blow Your Trumpets Gabriel\" and progressing into the sin-loaded chambers of blackened death metal mastery throughout \"Ora Pro Nobis Lucifer\" and \"Messe Noire.\" The potent anthems are complimented by the tightest, strongest, most electrifying performances that have ever appeared on any Behemoth record; the unit sounds utterly ravenous and profane, especially Nergal, whose barks are clean and organic against the blackened backdrop and sound much better than the guttural bellows of his previous efforts.\n\nI never would have guessed in a million years that an album of this quality was still in Behemoth's arsenal of cabalistic violence, but the Polish squad has reincarnated its craft and looks sharper than ever. Nergal's voice has never been stronger; the songwriting is extremely vigorous and dominant, leaving no track to capsize; Inferno's percussion remains top-notch; and the production satisfies the musical direction immeasurably. All in all, the blackened death metal direction of \"The Satanist,\" whether it'd been intentional or not, leaves not a single throat of its impious tribe athirst. \"The Satanist\" is just fantastic from start to finish; it is Behemoth's finest endeavor, and a monumental victory in many forms. \n\nThis review was written for: www.Thrashpit.com\n",
        "\nIn truth, it was only a couple of years ago when I really began listening to Behemoth. The brutal drums and harsh guitar riffs were very indicative of Behemoth's 'blackened death' style, and of course Nergal has an incredibly distinctive voice. 'The Satanist' brings a new side to Behemoth, perhaps a more melodic style, but they seem to have pulled it off!\n\nOne of the most interesting things about the album is that it is able to mix different styles very well. For example, the first song, 'Blow Your Trumpets Gabriel' has a very slow tempo and has a major focus on Nergal's voice. The song 'Amen', however, is a fantastic example of why people hail Behemoth as a blackened death metal band. The drums are extremely quick, and the guitars are given a higher focus, with very complicated riffs accompanying the brutality of Nergal's voice. Somehow, the transitions between these two styles are pulled off quite well.\n\nPerhaps my favorite thing about this album is the darkness of it. Recently, many bands have lost their focus on making music dark, and have focused on making it shocking. Dimmu Borgir's disappointing album 'Abrahadabra' is indicative of this. However, with the aptly named 'The Satanist', Behemoth have kept their music dark (for the most part) and have not relied on short, shocking lyrics. 'Ora Nobis Pro Lucifer' has extremely extensive lyrics that are not simply stating 'Hail Satan, Hail Satan, Hail Satan', but rather give a story of how and why one would hail Satan, which is an important distinction between blackened death metal and extreme metal. In the song 'O Father O Satan O Sun!', we even hear a thrashy guitar solo (a very impressive one). Behemoth have not completely lost their roots, though, as is shown by the song 'Furor Divinus'. The tempo and beat changes remind me of The Apostasy, with its distinctly different lead-ins and verses.\n\nHowever, with the song 'In The Absence ov Light', we have a random acoustic bit that does not fit, with a speaking voice that rapidly moves into Nergal's harsh vocals, which, too, does not fit. With this song and parts of the others, there is a feel that Behemoth have tried to make their music more extreme, and rather unfortunately, they have not entirely pulled it off. In the same song (...ov Light), we have what is almost a breakdown, something not generally found in Behemoth songs, but which could potentially appeal to the masses. This is the disappointing bit of the album. While they have kept their dark roots and added some melody into it, with parts of the album, they have progressed with the times to the point of moving towards melodic death metal. I have no problem with melodic death metal, Amon Amarth is one of my all-time favorite bands. But it's not Behemoth. Behemoth is brutal and dark and makes people around you worry about sitting next to you, but it makes you remember why death metal can mean something to you. The lyrics remain meaningful, the riffs are still metal, but something is missing that makes Behemoth distinct from the rest of death metal.\n\nThis album, then, is a great listen if you want something dark and something that keeps a desire to create metal separate from a desire to create shock. However, if you're looking for old Behemoth, this is not the album for you. Artists, though, have every right to progress their music as they see fit, and Behemoth have done just that. They've progressed, for the moment, it's worked out, but we've yet to see if they can keep their blackened death roots and incorporate it into the rest of their work. And after a battle with leukemia, it's very difficult to criticize Nergal, as he's released a properly great metal album.\n",
        "\n\"I believe neither in god nor in reason... give me a man, let him be like me\"\n~Witold Gombrowicz \"The Wedding\"\n\nThe Satanist was reborn and he spreads the word of the flawed god. It's not a secret that behind all the Behemoth image and occult-based ideology, hides a rather simple yet powerful concept. Instead of looking for the absolute in idealized religious dogmas or the sterile abstraction of science, you should embrace the scarred and imperfect... human.\n\nEven though the message Nergal & Co are spreading is a quite noticeable part of the album, it's the music, obviously, what really matters here. And let me tell you, in terms of originality, production and general flow, this is the best Behemoth album to date. They have at last freed themselves of restraints of their hallmarks. I love how balanced the influences are here - the wind symphonic parts are only where they should be, sound very organic and add tons of atmosphere. Riffs are dense, brutal yet still feel very natural. The band is not afraid to venture into a slower, apocalyptic doom metal sound, or to explore sinister realms of atmospheric black metal. With its flawless pacing, eclectic approach and flying solos, however, The Satanist is first and foremost a heavy metal album. A very heavy metal album. Heavy as hell. Well, anyway...\n\nThe Satanist is as inwardly conflicted, full of terror and passion as any of us. I've never really been a fan of the band, but this time round Nergal finally established himself as one of the best blacksmiths in modern extreme rock music. Behemoth's powerful blend of black and death metal was heated in flames of passion and forged with the hammer of creativity. Albums like this usually stand the test of time. \n\n-- Originally written for Metal Music Archives [www.metalmusicarchives.com] --\n",
        "\nThe news of Nergal's recovery from his struggle with leukemia brought the winds of hope regarding a new Behemoth release. In 2012, all these hopes were materialized as the Polish blackened death metal titans entered the rehearsals room, and started writing new songs for their future album. A few months later, in mid 2013, the title of the new album was announced, and I thought I misread something at first. \"The Satanist\", why on Earth would any serious and mature band name their album like that? No, really? Disappointed by the title, I expected the album to be worthless...\n\nAnd so came the release of the first official track (apart from live recordings), entitled \"Blow your trumpets, Gabriel!\". I gotta admit I was caught unprepared, without expecting how awesome the track would sound. A different, slower intro builds up into one of the most brutal breakdowns in the whole Behemoth discography, just as \"Alas Lord is Upon Me\" from their previous release, Evangelion, culminates a long buildup with an outburst of energy and hate. The outro to the song is mind-blowing, the blast beats being backed by eery, haunting trumpet sounds that enforce the title. Suddenly, I thought this album might just be better than their previous works, and decided to ignore the horrible title and give it a listen as soon as it appeared. \"Ora Pro Nobis Lucifer\" was the next track released, only two or three weeks prior to the release of the CD. The song is a monument of aggression, anger, while being melodic and flowing at the same time. \n\nOverall, I'd describe the album as a rather unexpected balance of brutality, chaotic and mind-blowing structures, aggressive blast-beats and beauty, epic passages, melodic choruses and complex riffs. Technically, the album is not superior, but being technical doesn't make an album great. Tracks such as \"Amen\" are incredibly brutal, Nergal delivering crushing and merciless vocals, matched by the extremely fast drumming Inferno is best known for. Other songs, such as \"Messe Noire\" or \"Ben Sahar\" are slower and less brutal, but they show a change in Behemoth's style. Their atmosphere is bleak, dark, but not in the way doom metal is, instead, offering images of the Dark Ages, filth, disease, death and misery. The closing track of the album combines some unusual vocals, not seen in other releases. The almost chanted vocals fit perfectly with the instrumental, and towards the end, the spoken part is of breathtaking beauty, being melancholic and epic at the same time, much in the way of \"He Who Breeds Pestilence\", off their 2009 album. The drums seem like a power factory, relentless, inexhaustible, dead-on time. Another nice thing is the progressive manner of the album: instead of being linear, the songs evolve and progress constantly, making it a very interesting release.\n\nLyrically, Krzysztof Azarewicz and Nergal did the same great job from a linguistic point of view. The texts are rich in archaisms, unusual words that contribute to the overall feeling of the album. Structures such as \"Great volcano ov excrement\" are, however dull it might seem, an important part to the wholeness of the album. However, given the fact that Behemoth have been around for 23 years now, I think that still sticking to the same \"satanic\" line is...immature. Even though I know they tried to deal with a metaphoric meaning of the word \"satan\", it's overused and fails to achieve it's purpose. The texts on their previous recordings are way better, without being childish... I mean, what's the point in abusing of the whole \"satanic\" shit, when you could be blasphemous and incisive in a clever, metaphorical way (as seen in their previous releases).\n\nSo, in the end, it's a great, great, great release. I am extremely impressed by the music, and consider it's an album worth listening to. However, the stupid and immature title takes away points for this album, as do the lyrics. Come on, the guys are in their late 30's, why stick to the exceedingly satanic imagery? This is a rebellion suitable for a band that has just begun and the members are only 17, when it's \"cool\" to be in league with the unholy...\n",
        "\nHaving reinvented themselves a number of times in the past, Behemoth has done it yet again with their tenth and latest full-length offering, \u201cThe Satanist\u201d. Much has been made of Nergal\u2019s inspirational return to the stage and his triumph over Leukemia so it goes without saying that they have a thing or two to prove this time around. However, whether \u201cThe Satanist\u201d lives up to the hype is largely a matter of personal opinion. This is an album that will no doubt separate the casual listeners from the diehard fans. One should approach this listening experience armed with the knowledge this it is, in fact, a much slower paced album than usual. \n\nHaving said that, this latest opus can still be perceived as a logical next step from its predecessor, \u201cEvangelion\u201d. Where songs like \u201cLucifer\u201d and \u201cAlas, the Lord is Upon Me\u201d reintroduced an eerie black metal aesthetic that had been absent from their music for quite some time, \u201cThe Satanist\u201d reiterates this and expands upon it greatly. Also like \u201cEvangelion\u201d, the album does not go without its fair share of blast beat fury. I\u2019m pleased to say that tracks like \u201cFuror Divinus\u201d and \u201cAmen\u201d shred with the best of their back catalogue, but overall the emphasis is much more on atmosphere rather than blasturbation.\n\nAs should be expected from an artist of Adam Darski\u2019s caliber, this record takes you on a journey and practically demands to be listened to from start to finish. The opening cut and lead single, \u201cBlow Your Trumpets Gabriel\u201d, sets the perfect primer for the rest of the CD and sums up nicely the diversity on display here. However, things don\u2019t get really interesting until the title track and its follow-up, \u201cBen Sahar\u201d. Together, these two songs see Darski & Co. exploring some unfamiliar soundscapes and territories that are beyond description, but rest assured when you hear them you will stop whatever it is you\u2019re doing and take notice.\n\nPerhaps the best compliment I can give this record is that each song has it\u2019s own unique character and identity that makes it unmistakably different from the others. Of course, it also has its unifying themes that bring it all together as well. There are some choirs, horns, synths and other such ear-candy that weave their way throughout the album with such subtlety as to only enhance the music and are neither distracting nor take away from the other instruments. Also present are a number of guitar solos that have a curious vintage flair to them. This is not entirely out of place as it seems an appropriate match for the cover art, but one has to speculate what brought this out of Nergal. \n\nThe only major criticism I have of this album is that there are some avant-garde qualities to the arrangements that make for an overall sound that is at times maybe a little too similar to Deathspell Omega, a group Darski happens to be a huge fan of. While that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing, there is something to be said for a band that will stick to their guns rather than alter their sound to resemble someone else. Besides that, an eyebrow-raising moment on \u201cIn the Absence ov Light\u201d is the only other negative thing this critic has to say about \u201cThe Satanist\u201d.\n\nAs stated earlier, this album is likely to cause a schism amongst Behemoth\u2019s fans. Some will praise it as a breath of fresh air, a conceptual masterpiece, etc. Still, others will say that the latest offering from Poland\u2019s finest is too far removed from their earlier work. Indeed, it is difficult at moments to believe that this is the same group that released \u201cDemigod\u201d just 10 short years ago. Only time will tell how this new opus will be remembered. My impression is that it is what it is: an honest to god record, straight from the heart, played with conviction, that compromises for no one. Viva blasfemia! \n\nHighlights: Blow Your Trumpets Gabriel, Amen, the Satanist, Ben Sahar\n",
        "\nLittle has the extreme metal world not known of the difficulties in the build-up to Behemoth's 10th album, the beautifully blunt, brutally brazen \"The Satanist\". Strong personalities like Nergal simply don't roll over to let life-threatening illnesses take hold. Instead every ounce of strength is mustered in overcoming the odds, meaning such a starkly titled release should be seen as nothing but a victorious proclamation on behalf of their fantastically captivating and confident mainman.\n\nIt takes a certain amount of balls to do anything different in the stymied extreme metal scene, and here, for the past few albums at least, Behemoth have taken that challenge to heart. Thematically the band look into the Thelema and Satanism in thought-provoking ways - part of the irony of such an album title than many are sure to read the wrong way - while leading your 'come-back' album with a track titled \"Blow Your Trumpets Gabriel\" is definitely a means with which to turn heads. That song though is one of the most disappointing of the nine. The slow, pounding opening gives way to Nergal's spittle vocals with (sampled) brass sounds and \"Hail!\" chants effectively building tension as the song progresses, but the crescendo it reaches is messy and over-layered, with staccato riffing sitting uneasily with the angelic heavenly vocals and Inferno's merciless pounding behind the skins. It sounds like Behemoth simply trying too hard to be extreme at these points, while I imagine this forced brutality and reliance on sampling will need a certain amount of artificial help to work well live.\n\n\"Furor Divinus\" which follows is a big improvement. The early riffing reminding me of Weapon before the blasting speeds up into Belphegor-esque proportions, settling on a blastbeat-driven and decidedly frosty black metal lead rhythm. Such moments bring to mind their 2002 effort \"Zos Kia Cultus\", my bet for the all-round strongest effort from the Poles, so certainly no bad thing. Suddenly finishing and leading into Nergal proclaiming \"I believe in Satan!\" for the opening of \"Messe Noire\", this again displays signs of the band losing control of the reins at the crucial moment as the unsettling synth sounds struggle to adapt to the thumping riffs of Orion and Seth alongside it. The excellent, victorious solos in the latter stages do end the song on a high note before \"Ora Pro Nobis Lucifer\" rolls into action with perhaps the best riff of the album. It's classic Behemoth all over with Nergal espousing both diction and lead riffing like they're going out of fashion and a much better flow thanks to the removal of much of the synth which cluttered the earlier songs, positively guaranteeing the inclusion of this one in upcoming setlists.\n\n\"Amen\" is the kind of punchy, vicious assault on the senses that would make Marduk proud, although the clarity of their force gets a little lost in amongst Inferno's battery. The song slows to a bass-led interlude closing in the same destructive in which it begun, leading into the nuanced opening of the slower title track. It's melodic lead guitar lines somewhat drown out the backing synth harmonies as the song somewhat plods along devoid of the purpose that is apparent elsewhere, while \"Ben Sahar\" commences in a similarly progressive manner til the breakout of an archetype Behemoth neck-snapping tempo leads the song towards \"In the Absence Ov Light\". The deathly apocalypse that is it's rambunctious blastbeat-infested opening marks the first of three distinct sections, making way for a brass-backed spoken word interjection from Nergal - in Polish, natch - before viciously breaking for destructive waters again. The contrast of heavy to soft in the song perhaps sounds odd on paper but oh boy does it work well. Closer \"O Father O Satan O Sun!\" is the most thoughtful in construction of the lot, bookending the album in two slower tracks and in turn revealing Nergal's disposition to unearthly forces with an interesting dialogue through the progression of the song that only ends when the fading sounds of amplification and brass herald their final call.\n\nRegardless of the result of their efforts I have never failed to be impressed with the honesty and tenacity of Nergal, through a time in which he has reached celebrity status in his homeland and conquered serious illness. No thoughts of softening their stance, \"The Satanist\" marks a return of epic proportions and, even if such a sheer force of will has sent a few of the tracks past the periphery of effectiveness, one is hard-pressed to not feel thankful for what this unbowed foursome bring to the world of extreme metal. \n\nOriginall written for www.Rockfreaks.net\n",
        "\nSatanica falls in line with most of Behemoth's output during their cryptic mid-period. Thelema 6 gets a lot of flak for it's uneven, boomy production values and all-over-the-place compositional approach. While not quite as unorthodox as its direct predecessor, Satanica seems to have been given a free pass despite being almost equally directionless. \n\nWhat needs to be addressed right away is the one major exception to the rule here: \"Decade of Therion\". This is without a doubt Behemoth's most vitriolic, impressive composition to date. It is no mistake that it surfaced during a period of identity crisis for the band, as it features both the primal approach of the group's earlier material and the more measured riff barrage present on their more recent works. The most impressive moment comes just after the one-minute mark, during the lyrics \"Synchronicity - Mother Chaos on the stage\". The held out, open notes evoke a crushing atmosphere bolstered by Promi\u0144ski's typically impressive blasting. That's not to say the rest of \"Decade of Therion\" is anything less than savage, because it most definitely is.\n\nThere are some other decent songs worth investigating, even though the band never gathers itself for another adrenaline shot like the opener. \"Ceremony of Shiva\" features some enterprising compositional elements, mainly appearing during the grooving drum intro and the choir-infused chorus. The leadwork on this one is also worth a mention, featuring a dissonant alternate-picked passage that fits well alongside Darski's primal roars. The more mid-paced \"Chant for ESCHATON 2000\" is also decent, featuring a pretty solid main riff and some cool, cleaner vocals during key moments. There are also keyboards too, for some reason. The orchestral outro to the closer sounds rightfully epic, and I personally end up wishing it was longer.\n\nMost of the rest of Satanica fails to make much of an impact. While its primitive, grimy production values may appeal to some listeners, I feel that it ends up being a liability in this case. Most glaringly, the drums sound like shit. During blasting, the drums sound quaffing and uneven. The rest of the kit is also a bit of a mess, as the toms sound like they are being slapped instead of having the natural pop you would expect. The guitars are thin, but are less of a liability than the drums. The rhythm is solid, but the leads sound unnaturally screechy and irritating. \n\nWhile Satanica features less of the flagrant use of Middle-Eastern aesthetics the band would later be known for, it serves as a flawed, yet interesting stepping stone to the brutal disposition Behemoth is known for today. I can't help but feel that failed experiments such as this served as lessons-learned for Darski and his crew. Track down \"Decade of Therion\", \"Ceremony of Shiva\", and \"Chant for ESCHATON 2000\". Skip the rest.\n",
        "\nThelema.6 is definitely a weird album coming from Behemoth. Introducing myself to the band via Evangelion, and later Zos Kia Cultus, Thelema.6 required several listens before it slowly opened itself up to appreciation. With Evangelion being, in my opinion, a great introduction to Behemoth, and Zos Kia Cultus having song after song of intensive death metal riffing that never ceased to be perfect, Thelema.6 comes across as a little strange, not like the beasts of the other 2 mentioned albums. But repeated listening reveals an album with great songs, production, and enjoyment to be had.\n\nProduction wise, everything is solid. The guitars sound good, Nergal\u2019s voice is menacing and passionate, and the drums have the perfect production that makes Inferno\u2019s consistent blast sections just sound amazing.\n\nAs a whole, and speaking general, Thelema.6 can essentially be divided into 2 parts \u2013 the first part being the opener up to \u201cChristians to the Lions\u201d, and the second part being the rest of the album. Cutting the album in half, we find the first-half of Thelema.6 more-or-less \u201cOrthodox Behemoth\u201d, while the latter half gets stranger and stranger until the album ends. But don\u2019t take this to be a bad thing. There is much enjoyment to be had over this album as a whole, as long as it is given a little patience.\n\nOver the first half of the album, we find what is to be expected of the band around this period. Heavy riffing, usually at a fast tempo, Nergal growling out passionate words condemning Abrahamic religion and embracing unorthodox philosophical ideas, while Inferno pounds away at his drums like a madman. It\u2019s never overdone though, and the beating and blasting and double-bass never gets boring, even if we find the same kinds of drum patterns in most of the songs. \u201cAntichristian Phenomenon\u201d is a great opener, teasing with its mid-paced opening before it erupts into tremolo riff madness and Inferno pounding away. This is the longest song on the album, and still under 5 minutes. These early songs contain lots of unique riffing, but nothing is too unorthodox yet, and especially here, but over the course of the entire album, Behemoth know how to put together great riffs with powerful blasting to run you over.\n\nOnce we get past the live-favorite, fast and brutal \u201cChristians to the Lions\u201d, the album changes to a slightly different beast. As we go on through the rest of the track-list, the album gets stranger and stranger. The riffing gets more weird and unique, the song titles get stranger, and the lyrics get much stranger. Take \u201cThe Universe Illumination\u201d, which, after opening up, sports a chugging riff and keys in the background, very bombastic and epic while still being strange, before moving to tremolo riff goodness and highly-passionate vocals from Nergal. Or the next track, \u201cVinvm Sabbati\u201d, with its restrained, melodic opening riffs, before the strangest verses on the whole album commence. This song never even gets really fast or blasts at all, nor does the closer, \u201c23 (The Youth Manifesto)\u201d, which features a tapping riff and Nergal growling about his life journey so far, before transitioning into a slow, chugging riff with double bass and industrial effects, to finally fade out. My version doesn\u2019t have album closer \u201cThe End\u201d, but if I recall it well, it\u2019s just static/effects for 20 seconds until Nergal screams one weird line into your ear, ending the album.\n\nHowever, over the course of the whole album, a few things constantly hold true: the riffing, whether heavy death metal or tremolo picking or chugging or the weird stuff, is always memorable and likely to get stuck in your head with repeated listens, and Inferno can do no wrong with his mostly blasting and double-bass drumming.\n\nThelema.6 is worth the patience that is probably required to get into the album. Don\u2019t be alarmed by the strange cover-art, song titles, or song descriptions. This album is unmistakably Behemoth, and is definitely worth purchase.\n\n*Get the digipak version with the 4 bonus tracks \u2013 1 original song, 2 covers, and 1 re-recording of an old song, and they\u2019re all good*.\n",
        "\nA wind-like sound begins, a chant builds up...'Behemoth! Behemoth! Behemoth! Behemoth!', then applause, distant harpsichord sounds with drums, and atmospheric singing. And then Ov Fire and The Void begins. So starts Evangelica Heretica, the latest live edition from Behemoth and one hour of utterly intense fury.\n\nAs said, the opener Ov Fire and The Void really sets you up for what you are about to experience: furious blast beats, intense guitars, and Nergal's voice cutting through it all with a rage unmatched by any other within the genre. The band is really tight here and play everything with a crispness that demonstrates why they are at the top of their league. It is also played with a vigor that helps it come across to the listener. And for anyone worried that you might not get to enjoy the same brutality live as you do on the albums, have no fear as the raw fury that one experiences on the studio albums is just as brutal live. Songs such as Demigod and Christians to the Lions are prime examples of this fury. \n\nBehind this musical phenomenon is the band who are in prime form for this. Inferno, as usual, shows us why he is one of the best drummers around as his blast beats and snare work provides a wonderful wall of sound that backs up the rest of the band. The fact that the man keeps up such a fast and difficult performance throughout the show demonstrates in itself the skill present. The guitars together are brilliant with the melodies coming together perfectly and showing some technicality that doesn't quite come across on the albums. The solos that are played occasionally throughout are highlights for the guitars, providing variety and a relief from the constant intensity that is a Behemoth show. \n\nRoaring his way through this show is Nergal, the vocal addition, and what vocals they are. Anyone who has ever heard the band and gone 'bet his vocals suck live' should listen to this and then be stabbed for doubting him. Nergal easily transfers his passionate fury that is heard on the albums to the live set, and songs such as Ov fire and The Void and Conquer All are perfect examples of this. By adding variation through snarls and growls rather than varying pitch, one is still drawn into the power and conviction of his performance and it really pays of.\n\nThis is a great live album showcasing the talent and intensity of Behemoth, a band that is truly in top form and one of the leading death metal acts around, as they pound and roar their way through a set of old and new. This should be a definite addition to anyone who consider themselves to be a fan of the band.\n\nFirst appeared on: http://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/53817/Behemoth-Evangelica-Heretica/\n",
        "\nI've always felt that this band was eminently qualified to lead a charge from their \"shores\", going back to their earliest material, which seemed to contain, if nothing else, a germ of potential that the rest of the Polish bands did not share. Whether that potential was based on idiosyncratic circumstances or the true talent lurking beneath the black metal stylistics of their earlier releases, I am not sure - but until they took a step to differentiate themselves from the Eastern European hordes with 'Satanica' Behemoth was always, for me, a hit-or-miss affair: their albums were listenable, to be sure, but noted by me mainly for their character as documents of a 'band-in-waiting', a group that had not found their own particular style yet, and most of all, for their interesting take on Emperor's musical language. In the swelling tide of sound-alike bands emerging from all the different countries of Europe after the first strikes of Emperor and the rest of the Norwegian black metal scene - a tide that threated to engulf the listening public in a maelstrom of mediocrity and unoriginality - Behemoth at least stood out as a band that could play their instruments well, if nothing else. But with this release the group finds themselves in a strange position: a new sound, a new look, a new label, and a new chance to make an impact upon the post-black metal scene. \n\nInteresting, then, that they chose to go back to what is surely their roots (as it is equally the foundation of almost every black metal band from the second wave): death metal. Other reviews of this album have placed their new sound and style as being close to Morbid Angel, but I don't really hear that at all. It is now a standard or cliche to compare a death metal band to Morbid Angel when they are difficult to describe in another way: this both because Morbid Angel's stylistics are so broad and all-inclusive, and could be referenced by bands of completely different styles, but also because they are still the leading death metal band and thus a nod in their direction ensures a readily-recognizable identity ready to be 'borrowed'. I would say that this is actually much closer to Deicide (as well as their nation-mates Vader, no surprise there), if they wanted to compare the music to prototypical death metal, as it is comparatively simple, brutally rhythmic, and extremely fast. Behemoth forgo much of their earlier attempts at atmosphere or lyrical effusiveness and instead just blast away at light-speed for much of this album, which seems to work equally well for them: I didn't really miss their earlier style when listening to this album...no, this suits them just fine, and in actuality they sound more original now that they have dropped all the 'atmospheric' black metal pretenses and streamlined their sound. Don't get me wrong: this isn't a 'typical' death metal release, not by a long shot, as the music is not afraid to explore avenues left neglected by the mainstream death bands, and there is still enough of the 'De Mysteriis' cold black metal influence in here to justify the claim that their bio makes that they are trying to combine death metal with early Mayhem. Behemoth have started something here that I think they would be well-advised to continue in the future - but neither is this truly ground-breaking or strikingly novel, so I would have to temper my enthusiasm with a few words of caution: seek this out if you attracted to former black metal bands changing back to death metal (Gehenna constantly comes to mind when listening this album), but also be aware that this is just the 'first strike' of their new style, and I'm sure their next album will be more confident as well as better constructed.\n\nUA\n\nErebus Magazine\nhttp://erebuszine.blogspot.com\n",
        "\nIf you are already a fan of Behemoth, then you are no stranger to their evil, Satanic, and brutally-heavy style. From the haunting bleakness of their debut to the shell shock-inducing 'Zos Kia Cultus', they are well-known and respected for their hellish anthems of blasphemy. Just when you think they can't get any more brutal, they craft Demigod, which is nothing short of a musical earthquake. I will explain to you why Demigod is one of the heaviest albums I have heard recently.\n\nThe production on this release is crystal clear, which means that we get to hear everything perfectly. This adds to the sheer immensity of the album. The opening track starts with some Nile-esque clean guitars. After this menacing Middle Eastern intro the album explodes into an intimidating death metal assault. The drum work of Inferno is unbelievably fast in songs like 'Demigod' and the mighty 'Slaves Shall Serve'. His blasts are among the fastest I have ever heard, rivaling Kataklysm's 'Serenity in Fire', which is quite a feat. The guitar riffs are intense and furious with 'The Nephilim Rising' standing out. The opening riff to this song sounds like it was created in the fires of hell and it is one of the stand out songs on the album.\n\nThe vocals garnered mixed reception upon the album's released. Nergal's layered growls polarized fans with some taking a strong dislike. Do not listen to these critics. This effect makes the vocals sound more demonic, unnerving, and appropriate to the music. 'Towards Babylon' is the most brutal track on the album and this is mainly due to the vocals. Nergal sounds like he is commanding you to bow down before him with his hellish growls. The blast beats and guitar riffs make this song a formidable listen, and a clean pair of pants is needed after this one. The technicality of the guitars is mainly showcased in 'Xul', a beast of a track that features a guest appearance from Karl Sanders, a genius in complexity. \n\nThere are some interesting instruments on this record, such as a horn at the start of the title track. As well as sounding like the beginning of a death metal fox hunt (joke!), it provides the song with the atmosphere it needs. Although most of the album is more about overall heaviness than atmospherics, there are some brilliant little moments of experimenting. Some eerie ambiance at the end of the final track closes the album perfectly.\n\nProduction-wise, Demigod is probably about as heavy as it gets. Pristine, intense, and intimidating, it truly is a force to be reckoned with. Behemoth will have to work very hard indeed if they wish to outdo this avalanche of carnage, but as I thought the last album was as heavy as it gets, they may prove me wrong again. I am indeed hopeful for the future of these hardened death metal demons.\n\nVirgin listeners beware. :)\n",
        "\nThis album is a solid death metal album by the Polish band Behemoth. The album starts off with a dark, acoustic riff before going deep. Nergal's vocals are deep and help to create an atmosphere that seems to put you into the middle of an occult, Satanic ritual. Some of the songs on this album sounds as if there was a goat being sacrificed to a Pagan god. Maybe Zeus or something like that.\n\nThe drumming has a good mix of blast beats on it, but there are a couple of times when it is rather slow drumming aiding in creating a darker, more fantasy-styled atmosphere. There could have been more blast beats though, but this was fairly decent for the context of the music.\n\nThe lyrics dealt with topics related to Nietzsche and left hand path ideologies. Examples like these include quotes of Nietzsche and being intoxicated with self-love. The word \"love\" seems atypical of a death metal band, but it shows that Behemoth is willing to go over and above to distinguish themselves from some of the other popular artists in this relatively underground genre.\n\nThe guitars are the greatest part of this album. There are some breakdowns, but then they progress into an almost neo-classical/blues rock solo before transforming into a Satanic acoustic melody at the end. The order is mixed up at times, though. With the guitars, Behemoth accomplishes the task of not only making their music match a Luciferian/Pagan chant, it ends up becoming a sacrificial ritual itself.\n\nThe only problem with this album is that the songs are just too short. As a consequence, a very beautiful album seems to end abruptly. It would be more preferable to consistently make \"five minute plus\" length songs, but this is only a minor problem and a problem that can be dealt with. There is one song on this album that exceeds eight minutes in length.\n\nOverall, this album has a very strong chance of being Behemoth's best album. It is interesting to see a one-time black metal band evolve into the death metal legends they are bound to become. This album will more than likely be the one by which all other Behemoth albums are judged, even if it is not their best.\n",
        "\nOnce a pure black metal band balancing fluid melody and rolling rhythmic gravity, Behemoth now operate within the stylistically vague realm commonly referred to as 'blackened death metal', playing songs that are death metal in structure and technique, with black metal atmospherics and esoteric concept; the songs employ riffs that are efficiently consonant and interconnected in transitions which are marked by sudden alterations of structural patterns to redirect flow or change mood, maintaining a constant equilibrium of intensity and melody, aggressively propelled by surging, relentless rhythmical motion. The main melodies emerge characteristically from the interior of the non-stop barrage of musical momentum and force that provides the foundation of songs, while remaining committed to the defining stylistic aspects and unfailingly focused on the singular thematic realization. Early impressions of the album are something like a merging of Morbid Angel\u2019s Covenant with Emperor\u2019s Anthems to the Welkin at Dusk, with the enhanced intensity of more modern styles of death metal in both speed and instrumental detail, but Behemoth like to use a variety of nuances like electronic noise effects in between songs, sometimes as a slight indicator of a song\u2019s mood or melodic theme, yet these subtleties are more the substance of novelty to keep the listener engaged from track to track during brief pauses between immersive blasting attacks and disintegrating riffs in complex patterns.\n\n\"I am who I am not\nI negate and confirm\nI transgress - it is real!\"\n\nThe riffs are not as complex as their patterning, but there is a technical approach to instrumentation which never steers the music astray from its concentrated intention, these riffs always centered on the band\u2019s distinctive progression of melody. The melodic development occurs through a complex course of articulation, with frenetic solos running wild as an offshoot of the concurrent melodic theme, as each motif cycles through expanded sound-shapes in an exceptional display of organizational detail, while riffs establish atmospheric mood as they move towards transitions in melody, and the expressively strong, rage incensed, maniacal growls bring emotional force, and harmonize with the elements fulfilling the compositional design. All this is realized through exceptional instrumental skill and powerful expression, at times reaching a degree of communication on a level with some of metal\u2019s most universally acclaimed acts.\n\n\"Sensation... Nutrition... Mastication... Procreation...!\nThis is your blind - worm cycle\nKnow ye of nothing further than your own stench?\nHeaven is indifferent to your salvation or catastrophe\"\n\nIn stylistic approach Behemoth is more death than black metal on Satanica, concentrating less on mood establishment and atmospheric effects and more on compositional detail and extended formulations of instrumental interplay, yet its esoteric substance is connected with the traditionally understood idea of metal as a hostile artistic reaction to the idea of moral and spiritual absolution, voiced with an impossibly passionate desire for independence. Special attention needs to be paid to the powerful and articulate vocals which provide the music a furious voice of commanding presence and expressive range that compliments the inventive phrasing of the guitarists, as well as the storming performance of the drummer who propels the unyielding rhythmic force with an impressive display of technical ability matched with physical stamina, as the music synchronizes intelligence and power on this excellently produced effort. I\u2019ll always like this band\u2019s earlier work better for its obscure atmosphere and primal display of the elements featured with more sophistication and technicality here, but Satanica is above most of its competition in the field of technical blackened death metal.\n",
        "\nBehemoth, a metal band from Poland. A band that one either seems to love, or hate. A band that started out as a raw black metal band, and changed from that to a blackened death metal band. Whatever one might think of this band now, one cannot deny the magnitude and greatness of this demo, \"...From The Pagan Vastlands.\" It is truly a black metal monument!\n\nFirst, I want to address the production of this demo. It is raw, yes, RAW. But the listener can clearly hear whatever is going on. The first Behemoth demo, \"Eternal Damnation,\" sucks. A lot. The production was raw, but the atmosphere was awful. It was like Mayhem's \"Pure Fucking Armageddon\" or Burzum's old demos in terms of production. Raw as hell, but could not justify the instruments and sounded like one big ass mess. On their second demo, \"The Return of the Northern Moon,\" they were still using bad production. However, here, the instruments were much more professional and there was a great atmosphere of grim bleakness. Now, on THIS demo, \"...From The Pagan Vastlands,\" Behemoth creates a much better atmosphere, and a less raw, but still kvlt as fuck, production. Nothing on here, at all, is too high or too low in the mix. The guitars are out front, and amazing. The drums are audible, as is the bass to the point where it should be. Nergal's vocals are full of hate, definitely different than the death growls he does now, which are still good! But come on, he was at his best in Behemoth's black metal days.\n\nThe riffs on here are... Amazing. The first track, \"From Hornedlands to Lindisfarne\" features some acoustic strumming along with the raw electric riffs. There are also some keyboards in there, too, but they do not take over at all. This sort of reminds me of \"In a Glare of Burning Churches\" era Graveland. The next track, \"Thy Winter Kingdom,\" has to be the gem on the demo. There is a catchy as fuck riff here, which kicks off right away in the intro, and picks up after a short break. All of these tracks contain absolutely amazing riffing. \"The Dance of the Pagan Flames\" has some very raw and catchy tremolo riffs, and that keyboard at about a half a minute in made me think so much of Graveland. Interesting enough, Behemoth and Graveland supported eachother very early in their careers. This album closes with an amazing cover of Mayhem's classic \"Deathcrush.\" I find that I like this version a lot more than the version on Mayhem's \"Deathcrush EP.\" Why? It is a little clearer, and Nergal is a far superior vocalist to Maniac. \n\nThe drumming on this album, is ferocious. BUT not to a point where every drumbeat is a black metal blastbeat. There are some very thrashy moments with the drums. Anyway, this is an amazing demo. Infact, it is one of the greatest releases from Behemoth. This, and their 1994 EP \"And the Forests Dream Eternally\" and 1996 album \"Grom\" are the best from this band's black metal days, but as said before, this demo is probably their best recording ever. It is just that damned good. Any black metal fan WILL eat this up, no question.\n",
        "\nSatanica was a turning point for Behemoth, the album where they stepped off the beaten path and embraced the style of blackened death metal for which they are now best known. Despite the strength of their very early black metal work (they still play \"Moonspell Rites\" from And the Forests Dream Eternally live for a reason), they were still merely recreating an already established style. Satanica's preceding album Pandemonic Incantations had a vague death metal vibe, but it was a sloppy mess of unoriginal Norsecore at its root, and at best hinted towards what Behemoth would become. Satanica was it though, a death metal record that spoke of their black metal roots while bubbling with ideas that make it an incredibly enjoyable listen. This album is the first example of what has since made them one of death metal's most well known bands, and shows that why they deserve their acclaimed status.\n\nFrom first to last, Satanica is a bucket full of riffs, as any death metal album worth its salt should be. The balance Nergal drawn between black metal and death metal on the riffing is deft; rather than opting for thick death metal chords with the occasional black metal tremolo picking, the riffing takes the form of one or both genres in many ways at many times. Right from the energetic explosion that is opener \"Decade of Therion\", this clearly audible. It's hard to describe the torrent of riffing that makes up the song, but it's clear upon first listen. What is also noticeable is the ease with which the guitars shift from riff to riff. They're missing the snap-lock tightness of more recent Behemoth work, but they still change-up organically and in good conjunction with the rest of the music, particularly the drums. Drums have always played an important part in Behemoth's brand of death metal, providing a strong center both through driving rhythms and individually fascinating displays of skill. Inferno's ability to drum like the best of them is well represented, with blast beats, snare and drums rolls, and heavy double kick drumming all providing a powerful core over which the guitars blare. Nergal's deep growls roar over the music in equally well managed conjunction. The multitrack technique that adds energy to more recent tracks like \"Slaves Shall Serve\" is missing, but Nergal is an adept vocalist and covers his role with gusto. The way he growls \"starspawn\" in the song of the same name is intense, and he interacts with the vocal effect in \"Chant for Eschaton 2000\" interestingly by changing the manner of his growl, at times bringing it up to more of a harsh singing style.\n\nComponents like the aforementioned vocal effect are part of what makes the Satanica so enjoyable as well. There are plenty of clever ideas that pop up throughout, like the melodic harmonies and leads in \"Ceremony of Shiva\", (to iterate) the vocal variety on \"Chant for Eschoaton 2000\" and its urgent riffing, and the melodic solo that echoes through \"The Alchemist's Dream\". Nergal and co. obviously put a lot of creative energy into making this album, and it shows. Though it doesn't have the same tightness as, say, Evangelion, Satanica has a creativity and honesty that makes it one of the most enjoyable albums in Behemoth's discography. Overall, Satanica is a treat, a fantastic death metal album that's as important to Behemoth's history as it is fun to listen to.\n",
        "\nBefore reading anything else, readers should know that Behemoth's latest compilation, Abyssus Abyssum Invocat, is merely a combined version of both the Conjuration and Slaves Shall Serve EPs, with a few extra bonus tracks and a 16-page art booklet that was designed specifically for this release. The band was recently happy to announce that Adam \"Nergal\" Darski has fully recuperated and is getting in back shape so that he can take on the world after his recent triumph over leukemia. It's certainly a relief to see the band getting back into action, and it's nice that they've graced us with some signs of life...even if those signs don't include new material.\n\nAbyssus Abyssum Invocat is comprised of two discs, the first of which contains both Nine Inch Nails and Venom covers (\"Wish\" and \"The One Everyone Always Covers\", aka \"Welcome To Hell\") along with some kickass concert material. Particularly noteworthy are classic tracks such as \"Christians to the Lions,\" \"Decade of Therion,\" and \"Antichristian Phenomenon\" from the band's often-imitated-but-never-duplicated phase of complete fucking awesomeness. Additionally featured is \"From the Pagan Vastlands\" which, for enthusiasts of Behemoth's criminally underrated black metal phase, will be the obvious highlight of the entire double compilation.\n\nThe second disc is ten minutes shorter in playing time, and it's highlighted by Behemoth's wonderful rendition of \"Penetration,\" originally by The Nefilim. The album's final cover is of Danzig's \"Until You Call On The Dark\" and, quite frankly, puts a damper on disc two. Luckily, it's followed by a live track of \"Demigod,\" which will indeed put the same shit-eating grin on the listener's face that existed the first time they ever heard the song. That grinning will continue through \"Slaves Shall Serve\" and will conclude with fan favorite, \"As Above So Below.\" Behemoth is truly a master of the craft, and proves yet again that this band can produce the same amount of intensity live as it has always delivered on its albums.\n\nIn short, Abyssus Abyssum Invocat is worth the purchase if you're a Behemoth fan who has yet to pick up either the Conjuration or Slaves Shall Serve EPs. The live tracks, given the proper sound system, will place you right in the front of the stage, staring into the eyes of the demons that have been delivering both solid albums and incredible performances for about twenty years now. Don't be mistaken in believing the album is essential (it's not), but think of it this way: You don't get to see Behemoth too often; it's loaded with the goodies necessary to make you feel like you've just witnessed them in concert; and it's cheaper than the average Behemoth concert ticket these days. Unfortunately, the hearing aid you'll need after blasting this a couple of times is sold separately. \n\nOriginally written for MetalReview.com\n",
        "\nBefore I begin I\u2019d like to say that this album doesn\u2019t actually contain new Behemoth material. It is a limited edition 2CD box-set, compilation consisting of old demos, covers and some previously unreleased tracks from Behemoth\u2019s early days as a black metal band. These songs, like many of their demos, have been influenced by the bands from second wave of Norwegian black metal, notably Mayhem, Hellhammer and Darkthrone. \n\nThe result is 2CDs worth of wonderfully haunting, atmospheric black metal reminiscent to that of early Emperor. Also present in the mix is a handful of fast-paced re-recorded tracks such as \u2018Transylvanian Forest\u2019 which are bound to attract the attention of fans of Marduk or Ragnarok; along with covers of Hellhammer\u2019s \u2018Aggressor\u2019 and Mayhem\u2019s \u2018Deathcrush\u2019.\n\nThe highlights include: the instrumental \u2018Goat with a Thousand Young\u2019, the relentless \u2018Marduk-esque\u2019 pummeling of \u2018Transylvanian Forest\u2019 , the eerily atmospheric \u2018From Hornedlands to Lindisfarne\u2019 and the melodic \u2018Thy Winter Kingdom\u2019. The two cover tracks reveal the lengths to which the band was prepared to go to sound like their idols. So whilst their version of \u2018Deathcrush\u2019 may have persuaded me to see Mayhem in a different light, the cover of \u2018Aggressor\u2019 has done little to make me consider listening to Hellhammer. \n\nOriginally written for Valkyrian Music: http://valkyrianmusic.com/\n",
        "\nLet me first bore you with a personal anecdote. If you don\u2019t care about such things, or are here just to read a music review, skip to the following paragraph.\n\nWhen I was an innocent thirteen year old just dipping my toes in the vast ocean of metal, and still utterly convinced that latter-era In Flames and Amon Amarth was the heaviest shit out there, a more learned friend of mine loaned me this album by Behemoth. He warned me that it was a bit more out there than what I was already familiar with, but recommended I try it out with an open mind. I remember taking it home and studying the album cover and sleeve. Everything about it looked so foreign to me. What did all these symbols mean? What did the band name mean? What did he mean by \u201cout there\u201d? Intrigued, I popped it into my newly bought huge sound system which I use frequently to this day, and sat on my bed and listened. That moment was certainly one of the most significant experiences of my metal-listening career. Needless to say, I was blown away, but not necessarily in a good way. Behemoth didn\u2019t so much open the door to actual extreme metal for me, but rather hurled me in head first and naked, unarmed, and entirely ill-equipped. Dumbfounded, I sat there listening with a certain traumatized fascination. How could human beings, such as myself, create sounds like this, and more importantly, what on earth would possibly drive them to do so? I knew that what I was listening to was so far beyond my understanding, and that\u2019s what intrigued me most; the fact I simply couldn\u2019t understand this. It wasn\u2019t something I enjoyed listening to right off the bat, but I knew there was something about it that was so real, so honest, and so brutally powerful - key word being \u201cbrutally\u201d.\n\nFor the sake of clarity, I\u2019ll refer to this album, Demigod by Behemoth, as a death metal one. The exact genre has been debated, but analyzing it in that sense isn\u2019t what I want to focus on here. What I will do, though, is offer you my proposition as to why it\u2019s a modern classic. It seems to have become commonplace to praise a modern album based on its likeness to a previous classic. You often hear people saying things to the effect of \u201cthe sound of this album clearly harkens back to Entombed\u2019s Left Hand Path\u201d or \u201cThe savage guitar tone is definitely inspired by Dismember, and is therefore awesome\u201d. Well, Behemoth on Demigod sound about as much like Entombed and Dismember, or any other \u201cclassic\u201d death metal band for that matter, as they do Killswitch Engage, ie not alike at all. And that\u2019s exactly why this is a \u201cmodern\u201d classic. In days of yore, death metal was known for its filthy production, but you won\u2019t find that here. The sound is clean and massive, just as it should be. Bands that aim to play in the style of past successes might put out good music from time to time, but their motives are about as authentic as the American Godzilla reboot. That said, I\u2019m really not sure what inspired Behemoth on this album. I\u2019d like to believe their main inspiration was their confidence in themselves to top Demigod\u2019s already magnificent predecessor, Zos Kia Cultus, as the sound is actually a fairly clear continuation from that record, though tone and overall delivery is decidedly quite different and much more aggressive.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to pinpoint just where the foundation of the distinctive sound on this album lies. When Sculpting the Throne Ov Seth opens up into the explosion of eastern-sounding melody, you\u2019ll initially be blown away by the sheer memorability of the guitars, but listen closer, it\u2019s actually Inferno\u2019s sharp lead into blastbeats at 37 seconds that gives the music such a triumphant edge. It\u2019s useful, of course, to elaborate on more examples like this, but really, the entire album is built up of these kinds of moments. The band works like such an intrinsic unit that without each member flawlessly backing each other, the isolated instruments would be without meaning, or at least not nearly as effective. Even Orion\u2019s bass nicely adds to the overall heaviness. True, you can\u2019t hear it very prominently, but you\u2019re not supposed to, and I can\u2019t imagine what the songs would sound like with a really heavy bass production.\n\nElsewhere, the drums have an excellent, crisp sound, and by the gods Inferno is a beast behind the kit. I suppose the legendary Slaves Shall Serve is the first track that comes to mind when I think of Inferno\u2019s incredible endurance and precision, but really, each song is a testament to his immense abilities. Whether it\u2019s the crushing, warlike, beats of Conquer All or the ceaseless blastbeats which are the backbone of just about every song, his performance here is enough to earn him a truly notable position in the history of extreme metal drumming. Listen loudly with headphones to the nuances of his fills and general performance in Sculpting the Throne ov Seth, Demigod, XUL, or Slaves Shall Serve and I dare you to keep your mouth from gaping.\n\nThe lyrics on this album are also my favourite from Behemoth. The subject matter is essentially the same as always; potent images of vast conquering armies, invocations of long forgotten deities, and other musings upon the occult, yet there\u2019s a great continuity throughout the lyrics. Each song seems to interpret or expand upon the theme of mortality/immortality, hence the album title. There are simply some very memorable lyrics here, and I often find myself muttering the last verse of Conquer All under my breath:\n\nI am the pure flame that burns,\nI am Sirius\u2019 son,\nI am the infinite space,\nI am the most conquering one.\n\nThe vocals that spew forth these scriptures of blasphemy are the most controversial aspect of the album. While Nergal\u2019s technique is basically the same as on Zos Kia Cultus, his throaty death growls are heavily layered. I personally love them, because not only do they sound unlike anything I\u2019ve heard elsewhere, but it makes him sound like some enraged entity somewhere between human and\u2026 something else. A demigod? Ah, now you\u2019re following me. They\u2019re also more varied than most people give them credit for. Always seethingly aggressive, but the range between songs like XUL and the more blackened death metal tracks like The Nephilim Rising or Before The \u00c6ons Came is very noticeable.\n\nSome have accused this album of being mallcore, which is an argument so unfounded and ridiculous that I\u2019m not even going to explore it. The popularity of it is definitely noteworthy, though. While I\u2019d hesitate to call the music accessible, it is definitely memorable. I have most of the riffs engrained in my mind, and I often play the intro to The Reign Ov Shemsu-Hor in my head, as if meditating. Despite what you think of Demigod, there\u2019s no denying that it was/is a very important extreme metal album. Not only did it catapult Behemoth further into the death metal mainstream, but it also became a gateway album for people who had just been discovering death metal but hadn\u2019t yet wrapped their head around the depth of the genre.\n\nAll this time later, this album still gives me chills. I suppose the million dollar question is: would I still consider it in a league of its own had it not had such an impact on my virgin ears back in the day? Well, that\u2019s impossible to say, and I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s entirely important. What I do know for certain is that I love this music with all my heart, and will probably listen to it for the rest of my life. I\u2019ve never binged on this album too hard, lest its magic one day eludes me, but it\u2019s been a steady mainstay in my listening appetite since I first listened to it. So whether you\u2019re a newcomer to extreme music, or a seasoned fan, submit to Behemoth. Submit to Demigod.\n",
        "\n\"Satanica,\" or more specifically its opening track, \"Decade of Therion,\" was what introduced me to Behemoth. Initially I greatly enjoyed the album, but after listening to newer Behemoth albums like \"The Apostasy,\" \"Demigod,\" and \"Evangelion,\" \"Satanica\" isn't so great. In fact, it\u2019s my least favorite album by Behemoth and of the ones I've heard, probably their worst. But it's by no means a bad album and is still good to listen to.\n\nOn \"Satanica,\" the guitars still have trace elements of black metal that later in their career would almost completely vanish. The guitars play a style that for the most part sounds like early death/thrash albums with hints of black metal sewn into the riffs. As far as the riffs go, I almost want to say that they all sound the same but I can't do that. They do sound similar to a certain degree, but for the most part they're fairly memorable. As usual, the guitar solos that Nergal plays are good, most notably on tracks such as \"Lam,\" and Starspawn.\" \n\nInferno's drumming has become one of my favorite things about Behemoth and I wasn't disappointed on Satanica. The drums at the beginning of \"Ceremony of Shiva\" sound excellent as usual and are phenomenal throughout the album and add to Behemoth's blasphemous brutality.\n\nNergal's vocals are good as well, but not as good as they would later become. They sound much more black metal oriented than the style he would use on later albums such as \"Demigod\" for example. Altough I prefer his later style, his vocal performance on \"Satanica\" suits the music better.\n\nMy big problem with \"Satanica\" is the production quality. The entire album sounds a bit \"fuzzy. The production isn't bad but I would've preferred it be a tad bit cleaner. The only other problem is that there are several songs that are incredibly average sounding. \"Ceremony of Shiva,\" \"The Sermon to the Hypocrites,\" \"Starspawn,\" and \"The Alchemists Dream,\" are anywhere between average to good and drag the album down.\n\nOther than that this is a good album to listen to and I still enjoy listening back to Behemoth's earlier days.\n",
        "\nThe Apostasy opens up with an introduction slightly over a minute long that starts out slow and quiet and then builds in intensity until exploding into \"Slaying the Prophets of Isa\" and 40 minutes of a brutal onslaught by Polish blackened death metal band Behemoth. \n\nBehemoth's lyrical themes include paganism and references to the ancient, pre-christian world, and the band incorporates this into their sound. They do it in a way similar to how Nile makes their music sound like \"Ancient Egyptian heavy metal,\" but with Behemoth, it's much more Mesopotamian sounding. This can be heard on tracks like \"At the Left Hand ov God,\" \"Prometherion,\" and others.\n\nOne of the best and my favorite aspects of the album and the band is Inferno's howitzer like drumming. It is simply phenomenal all the way through. At around 1:38 on \"Slaying the Prophets of Isa,\" Inferno launches into a ( I apologize for sounding cliche ) artillery barrage that while short, showcases his talent as a drummer. His drumming is very fast, very precise, and very brutal sounding and reminiscent of tech death bands like their countrymen Vader.\n\nNergal and Orion's guitar playing is excellent as well. The best riff on the album in my opinion is the one featured on \"Christgrinding Avenue,\" the last song on the album. The intro to \"At the Left Hand ov God,\" is a dark accoustic one that again evokes the Ancient Greek/Mesopotamian sound that Behemoth incorporates into the album. Guitar solo's are also present on tracks such as \"Prometherion\", showing off Nergal and Orion's skills and showing just how much the band has changed since their black metal days, the only real remants of which are the outfits and the corpsepaint they use for live performances.\n\nThey are by now almost 100% a death metal band in the same league as other bands from their native Poland such as Vader and Decapitated. This album is in my opinion a must have for any metalhead.\n",
        "\nHere is another one of those demos made black metal cult by the fact that they are registered prior to 1994 (March 1992 to be precise) and, like most of the demos from that era, gives us the impression of have been recorded in a rusty box. Some will say that this is what makes a demo of true raw black metal and others say that is real shit period.\n\nSo, yes the sound is generally poor. So let's go with the performance of musicians and the construction quality of the songs. First the Vocals. A kind of growl barely audible and rather deaf. It is virtually impossible to hear the words that, according to legend, was lost by Nergal. The battery is just as dull as the rest of the production, but it still deserves to be played honestly. For guitars, rhythm parts are for the most part, very slow. They sound a bit like doom metal riffs. Each title has a guitar solo infects except perhaps that of Temple Of Evil is rather successful. \n\nOverall Endless Damnation is a demo that is not distinguished in any way. But to be honest, there is worse. Titles Eternal Blasphemy and Ceremony In Chapel  stand out of the lot, but you have to ignore the poor production.\n",
        "\nBehemoth is a true example of how stupid I can be. I remember reviewing \"Satanica\" once and while being moderately impressed, that recording's engineering left a bad taste in my mouth and made me foolishly regard the band as sloppy in their craft.\n\nIn recent years I have rediscovered the band as I've found their evil death metal stylings (because let's be honest here, it definitely leans more towards that than the black metal they unleashed on their earliest few releases) to be the ultimate embodiment of everything I love in brutal and extreme music. They are amazing in their musical ability, but not in the pursuit of making their music \"tech-\" but rather it seems just in the purpose of whatever they feel like composing, it is always within their capabilities. Nergal fucking IS walking brutality. His growls are throaty lion roars rather than over-the-top gutteral and it suits his riffing wizardly down to a T. Even his guitar solos are something to behold as they are a direct invocation of one Trey Azagthoth, complete with plenty of atmosphere and airiness to his solos, only to be overshadowed when he unleashes of flurry of notes to let us know that he DOES really have the chops to match his bombast. Orion is an all-out bass god to watch him on these DVDs. He holds down the low-end and puts on the ultimate metal show on his own, and the rest of the band really follows his lead in terms of stage presence. Live guitarist Seth is a truly capable guitarist and vocalist in his own right and he really augments what Behemoth does even if only to add more weight to everything. In that respect, he totally and utterly succeeds. As for Inferno...wow, what a drummer! There is no better word in the entire language to describe Inferno's drumming than RELENTLESS! It's just a non-stop barrage but with the occasional dynamics and phrasing on the ride and cymbals that you just don't expect in the most brutal of music. To watch him on the documentary portion on the second disc doing warm-up exercises is interesting as hell because it seems like he plays with such a LIGHT touch for a death metal drummer. It's funny, he has a finesse to him but still retains the power.\n\nThe live shows on disc one are definitely where it's at on this DVD. The shows are tight, well-mixed, albeit you can tell there's some overdubs in there for sure, but still very well-mixed all the same. The drum solos are amazing, and the shows are just always awash in red or blue light reflecting off their mic stands and costumes. The only thing I don't like about their live shows are the mic stands, truthfully. Speaking as a musician, one of the reasons I would run to the front is to see what the guitar players are doing...and those monstrosities they call mic stands make it nearly impossible to really watch what they do (thank...somebody...for great camera angles on this DVD). The documentaries...are not pointless, but one does watch them with a certain \"Meh, couldn't care much less\" attitude. I mean they are kinda interesting, but a documentary more in the style of recent metal DVDs I've seen would have been more preferable. Recent DVDs from other Metal Blade artists have documented a band's history; I like seeing a band talk about how they got their start and went through various members and arrived at their current lineup and how they've made decisions that have effected the outcome of the bands career and brought them to this point. I am genuinely fascinated by stuff like this and there was a huge lacking of this. The second documentary is more interesting...life on the road, interviews, going through airports, being on Rockstar Mayhem, and the like. Also, we gotta love the music videos, of which ALL from 1999-present are contained here, which is super cool.\n\nThe second DVD is not necessary so much as the first DVD (but it is still fairly cool), and the live CD that is also contained is a great listen in the car. All in all, I'd call this one of the top echelon of metal DVDs that I own.\n",
        "\nThis EP release was definitely a turning point in the career of Poland's favorite (or cursed) sons Behemoth. The previous album, Grom, showed a band that was maturing, but one that was still in line with previous works: raw black metal, yet better produced. On this release we can hear that Behemoth have begun making the change to their blackened death metal sound of the late 90's. There's only a few things that remain from their black metal work here, the image and main man Nergal. They're still the corpsepainted warriors of Satan, but their music has been elevated to more extreme channels. You'll notice this when the first song kicks in. With Spell of Inferno (Mefisto), the only new song present, is a raw, blast beat fest of a song, somewhat removed from previous works. Behemoth always used blast beats to enhance the more chaotic songs of their past, but this time they are used with no abandon, and are also much faster than before. You'll also notice that the drums are somewhat buried in the mix. Cymbals are prevalent, but bass and snare (somewhat) are farther down. It's somewhat muddy, but definitely less raw than even Grom. New drummer Inferno can probably be somewhat credited for their shift in musical styles. He's a monster behind the drums, even in this earlier release, and his style of hyper fast drumming brings the songs to far more extreme levels than previous skinsman Baal Ravenlock ever did. Overall this song is a vision of what the new Behemoth would become: basically no sign of folk influenced, atmospheric BM whatsoever, and in turn, a satanic hymn of chaos. I like it to tell the truth. It's catchy, fast, raw, and \"evil\". Nergals vocals are much deeper here than before. Not quite a growl yet, but also not his raspy wail from before. \n\nThe other two songs are re-recorded versions of two old songs. Hidden in the Fog retains the folky feel of before, but this time the vocals are deeper and the drumming tighter. To tell the truth, I didn't care all that much for the Sventevith album which this was originally on, and I find this version of the song to be better. Nothing has really changed musically, but with a better and more distinctive sound, this song is brought new life. The other re-recorded song is Sventevith (Storming Near the Baltic). This is another blast fest, but I find that the atmosphere has been retained from the original version. I don't have much to say about this song, just that it sounds good. It's nothing spectacular by any means, but it serves it's purpose. \n\nThis EP was the precursor to the next full length, Pandemoniac Incantations. The sound on here is similar to that album, and the style is indicative of that album as well. It's the last Behemoth album I truly enjoyed from start to finish, but that is neither here nor there. This release is hard to find, and due to availability issues, never saw a proper distribution, so I'd recommend buying the re-issue of \"And the Forest's Dream Eternally\" since this was tacked onto that album (an EP itself). This is not mandatory, but it's not rubbish either. If nothing else, it shows what this band used to be, but also what they would become.\n",
        "\nOver the course of their career, Behemoth has constantly been a tour-de-force in the metal community, now, with Evangelion they appear to be slowing down.\n\nWith the good times, there must always be bad times, this album for starters, feels rather rehashed and sort of rushed to me. It doesn't appear to hold the same magic as many of their previous releases, however it has a stronger feel than that of Demigod.\n\nThe worst aspects of this album are the generally monotonous vocals and generally stale guitar work. The vocals don't hold as much variation as the previous releases, nor the oomph found on their black metal releases, but the good side of Nergal's vocals is that he is able to deliver them in a manner that can still be captivating for the first couple of spins. The guitars also have some high points, such as the bridge work on \"Ov Fire And The Void\" which sends a feeling of discomforting dread into your veins, whilst the riffing remains run-of-the mill with it's over use of the octave intervals as found on songs like \"Conquer All\", this only pertaining to the first few songs. Another point of interest for the guitars would be the solos that are heard on Evangelion. If any point of the guitar work was to stand out amongst the heard on this, it would be its much heavier and aggressive than the last two albums.\n\nThe highlights of this release are the drums and the more \"brutal death metal\" oriented approach to the middle portion of the album. The drums sweep in and assail your ears with avengence! They show an improvement on the already excellent musicianship. The only negative point of the drums on Evangelion would be some of the fills, good examples of these said fills are on the first three songs. After the first three songs are finished, you'll notice how the band has taken a much more brutal death metal approach, this being evident once you notice how the music blends together.\n\nIf you aren't a fan of most of Behemoth's work, but are willing to give this a try, I suggest the songs \"Transmigrating Beyond Realms Ov Amenti,\" \"The Seed Ov I\", and \"He Who Breeds Pestilence\"; the last of that set having an intro that gives a little bit of the feeling their first three releases did, in particular Sventevith Storming Near the Baltic.\n",
        "\nSince the release of this album, Behemoth has gone from strength to strength, releasing three mighty albums in its wake. Yet, even with the passage of time and its inevitable familiarity, \u201cZos Kia Cultus\u201d remains immensely powerful.\n\nHell (and the world of metal) hath no fury like Behemoth. Try as they might, no band can mimic the enormity of this Polish 4-piece. While the preceding albums \u201cSatanica\u201d and \u201cThelema 6\u201d saw a departure from the black metal of their early career and an experimental foray into death metal, \u201cZos Kia\u2026\u201d is where they got the formula right.\n\nMuch promise was shown on the albums before this, with astounding musicianship and composition, \u201cZos Kia Cultus\u201d is a continuation of this. The sheer power of this record is addictive, and the infectious songs draw one in again and again. Behemoth managed to capture the ferocity of their live shows on this album, as every song is anthemic in its brutality.\n\nNergal is one of the greatest talents in the industry today, and he only recently started receiving recognition for his great work. Although most people consider \u201cDemigod\u201d to be their best release, and I tend to agree, \u201cZos Kia\u2026\u201d is also a fine example of why Behemoth is the most crucial death metal band since Death themselves. Nergal is the main creative force in the band, since he writes all the songs and most of the lyrics. Notably, the guitar-work on the album is amazing. It seems Nergal found his stride here, writing some classic riffs and not looking back since. Although the songs are written with natural death/black metal structures and progressions, the riffs themselves are everything but the norm. The guitars sound almost upbeat at times, whilst still amassing tremendous aggression. This is solid death metal fretwork, with palm-muting, tremolo picking and pinch harmonics to spare, but it remains fresh and original, nothing like the typical American death heard elsewhere.\n\nOne cannot speak of Behemoth without mentioning Inferno. The drums on \u201cZos Kia Cultus\u201d (and everything else Behemoth released after it) are nothing short of incredible. The speed and technicality at work here would put Kevin Talley to shame. All the blasts, fills and double-bass somehow seems twice as fast and brutal as anyone else. The tuning is also spot-on, with crisp cymbals and pulverizing double-bass. The snare is sharp, and the drums overall feature quite prominently on the album.\n\nBehemoth doesn\u2019t compromise on anything, as even the bass is impressive. Finger-picking exclusively, Novy delivers very strong chords and the bass is even audible, for once. As the guitars and drums drive furiously forward, Nergal\u2019s vocals add even more aggression. A typical throaty growl, the voice is immensely powerful and yet still unique for the genre. The lyrics round off the overall effect with immense fury and hatred. \n\nBehemoth has come a long way since the release of \u201cZos Kia Cultus\u201d, establishing themselves firmly as ambassadors for everything that is great in extreme metal. This album proved very early on that they are a force to be reckoned with. Behemoth is years ahead of the curve, and this was the start of their world domination.\n",
        "\nThough I've been listening to Poland's superstars for many years (yeah, since the black metal years), I've never been a card carrying member of the international fan club that seems to revere them as the greatest thing since Cradle of Filth. Do not get me wrong! Behemoth is a GOOD band. In fact, I can't recall an album of theirs that I didn't enjoy to some extent. They write solid, angry material and Nergal's neo-occult lyrical themes are always fascinating to me. The key to this band is visibility. Constant touring, videos, and the like have thrust them well beyond their prior obscurity into the eyes of the Hot Topic Metal Generation.\n\nEvangelion is the band's 9th full length album, and it starts with a bang, as a chaotic burst of symphonic madness and Nergal's gruff incantations transforms into the thundering \"Daimonos\". Choppy, punishing, and fast death metal, somewhere between Morbid Angel and Vader, and par for the course. Behemoth has been erupting in this style for the past decade, since Satanica. Some still consider their style blackish metal, but aside from an occasional snarl and the corpse paint the band wears, it's really not. This album rarely lets up, aside from its mystical interludes (like the great intro to \"Shemhamforash\"), but if you want just over 40 minutes of headbanging frenzy, this is pretty much guaranteed to send you to the emergency room. There are a few excellent, crushing tracks on this like \"Transmigrating Beyond Realms Ov Amenti\", \"He Who Breeds Pestilence\" and the very Morbid Angel-like \"The Seed Ov I\" which make this album just as compelling as anything else they've released in many years.\n\nEvangelion is effectively turbulent and sinister. The blasting is omnipresent, and Nergal's vocals are barbaric and disgusting. This band has certainly not compromised any of their aggression throughout the years of success they have attained. This is a death metal album worth hearing with a few tracks that I will return to, and has little less of the 'saminess' vibe that has plagued a few of their prior works. Behemoth fans will be jubilant, and death metal fans at large can find a lot to like here.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nAnd so, with the new Nile review is my review of Behemoth circa 2009, representing the newest LPs of two of the most highly respected and genre-pushing bands of today. Like Nile, I view Behemoth as coming off the back of one of their weakest albums in some time, 2007's \"The Apostasy\", a disappointment extra so considering my affection to the Poles which extends back to the release of 2002's brilliant \"Zos Kia Cultus (Here and Beyond)\" and a whole slew of devastating live performances in the meantime.\n\nThe similarities to Nile don't just end at a correlating release schedule and the band's positions within the genre. A million miles from the band's black metal beginnings, Behemoth are today the epitome of hyper-technical death metal, hyper-serious about the message they aim to spread, weaving anti-religious tales and mythology in a tapestry that melds Nergal's sore-throat vocals, the band's breakneck complex rhythms and some serious skin-bashing courtesy of longtime drummer Inferno. Notice any connection to Nile?\n\nWhere these two giants do differ most greatly is found in the black metal upbringing of Nergal, and Behemoth, and it\u2019s influence on the band's current output. \"He Who Breeds Pestilence\", \"Lucifer\" and \"Alas, The Lord Is Upon Me\" are the most blatant examples at any point in recent years of BM's atmosphere seeping into the death/black metal blast that has more recently taken over the collective soul of Behemoth. With this we get the delicious concoction of death metal's brutality and technicality and the evil nihilistic spirit of prime-time Mayhemic BM, and ultimately the reason for Behemoth's rapid ascent since the turn of the century from when they have seen off highly noteworthy attempts (Belphegor, Anaal Nathrakh just to mention two) as the best demonstration in combining the ugly, chaotic worlds of black and death metal.\n\nExplaining why I haven't found the same satisfaction in \"The Apostasy\" and \"Demigod\" in relation to \"Zos Kia Cultus\" and it's predecessor \"Thelema.6\" is difficult, and anyway, probably not a view I expect many of you out there share with me. Father time will be the answer as to whether \"Evangelion\" manages to reverse that downward trend I am confident that it will. Where the most recent releases have had their moments (\"Slaves Shall Serve\", \"Prometherion\") they have become obscured in a wash of over-intensity and too much blasting. Here Behemoth have learned from those mistakes and created an album that knows how to blast the skin off your face, but one which also shows a pleasingly willingness to show the band's strength at slower tempos.\n\nAnd in respect to the new Nile? Well, that's too close to call - you'll have to buy both and decide for yourself. \n\nOriginally written for Rockfreaks.net\n",
        "\nThe latest EP offering from Poland's corpse-painted death metal superstars is an interesting mix of material. You've got a few live tracks spanning their career. \"From the Pagan Vastlands\", \"Decade Ov Therion\" and \"Chant for Ezkaton 2000 e.v.\".\n\nThere is the studio version of \"Chant for Ezkaton 2000 e.v.\" which is rather dull, and the far superior \"Qadosh\".\n\nBut most important here is the excellent choice of covers. They do a pretty hardcore cover of \"I'm Not Jesus\" by the Ramones! This is a classy cover here, from one of the punk gods' best and most underrated albums. And Behemoth make it their own with aplomb. Brutal! The other cover is \"Jama Pekel\" from the great Czech black Master's Hammer, one of my favorite bands from that country... and it sounds quite awesome in the hands of the Polish pretty boy brutes Nergal and company.\n\nThe covers alone make this EP worthwhile, and if you're a diehard for the past few albums you are also really going to enjoy \"Qadosh\". I could do without the live tracks and the \"Chant for Ezkaton\" wasn't so interesting, so in all I'm going to grade this in the middle.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nLet us return to simpler times, before Behemoth made their notable transition into Morbid Angel, Jr. And I mean no insult by this, their death metal records are generally impressive. But there was once this obscure little black metal band from Poland, and they put out some good EPs and even an album or two.\n\nAnd the Forests Dream Eternally is one of the crowning moments of this early period, an EP of extremely cold and well executed black metal that can inspire nostalgia at the drop of an ax. \"Transylvanian Forest\" begins with a steady pace as its desolate, dissonant walls of guitar flood the listener with imagery of newsprint woodland terror, of bleak and monumental castles and the stalking of bloodthirsty wolves at your heals. Enter \"Moonspell Rites\" with its excellent Bathory vibe, grinding bass and charismatic heathen vocals. There is a different version of \"Sventevith\" here, the title track to their debut full-length, and it completely kicks ass. \"Pure Evil and Hate\" is perhaps the most punky and feisty of the tracks here, it seriously makes you want to strap on your shit kickers and find your local convent. The EP's closing track \"Forgotten Empire of Dark Witchcraft\" is a mellower track, with acoustic guitars vibrating alongside the distorted butchery. This tune aptly conveys the light touches of folksy atmosphere the band once incorporated into their sound.\n\nGranted, these days are a far cry from the early sound, but I do miss it, and have always hoped they would return to an album like this at some point. Nergal has already proven he can fly and be a dominating mountaintop figure in his recent videos, how about soaring down into those cold valleys like a raptor of prey and delivering us yet another glimpse into this ancient woodland past. It would be more than welcome.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nOh dear, not another one of these. The last decent EP was Bewitching The Pomerania, but I\u2019d rather take any of their full-lengths over that one, too. I don\u2019t know about this one, it\u2019s a mixed bag. You get one song left off of Zos Kia Cultus, a couple covers (one by a washed-up band and the other by a really crappy band), and a host of live tracks. I\u2019m here to review the US version, which pretty much means over half of this EP is stocked with live tracks. So ten tracks means, on paper, that this isn\u2019t such a bad deal between albums.\n\nThe leftover song, \u201cConjuration Ov Sleep Daemons,\u201d has Zos Kia Cultus production standards and plays out like most of the songs from that album. It would have been squashed between the longer and more epic tracks like \u201cHere And Beyond\u201d or the title track. The riffs are twisted, but the drums really knock up the psychotic urge. The Nine Inch Nails cover pisses me off because the vocals are incredibly annoying; they\u2019re clean / electronically altered with really lame lyrics and arrangements that don\u2019t work for a song like this. It sounds incredibly out of place for a death metal band to cover, though I guess it fits the theme of cyber-illusion and reality. Production for this and the more paced Venom cover are clear and somewhat equal to the Zos Kia Cultus production (maybe a drop lower in quality if specifics is your thing).\n\nThe live tracks are all from the same concert, and I\u2019m astounded at how clear it is. It\u2019s damn good: riffs are extra thick, drumming pummels through the thickness at equal par, and the bass can be heard grumbling between the two. Even Nergal\u2019s vocals are fierce and barky \u2013 I can only assume that the fans are going bonkers. Solos are very buried under the music, but that\u2019s hardly a problem to my ears when everything is so thick and unmerciful. The best comes from \u201cChant For Eskaton 2000\u201d where the fans are begging for the song before Nergal blares the introduction and the riff starts building up like fucking crazy. Such an awesome song that would have been perfect if the lead wasn\u2019t so screechy, but that\u2019s just me complaining from my own room. If I was at the concert, I may have been irked only a little, since the rest of the song just slays and the setting is lively.\n\nWould I buy this EP? Fuck no, but it\u2019s a pretty funky deal for a download if you can look past the two cover songs. It\u2019s more of a collector\u2019s item nowadays, but it isn\u2019t essential for regular fans. You could make do without more live tracks and an unreleased song, since there really isn\u2019t anything holding this release together. Its fun while it lasts, but that means just one sitting. After that, it pretty much bites the dust.\n",
        "\nBehemoth fans and their wallets are certainly being kept occupied in the downtime between \"The Apostasy\" and the next album to be released by the outspoken Poles, as with the recent release of \"At The Arena Ov Aion - Live Apostasy\" we are now greeted by \"Ezkaton\". A mish-mash of an EP, \"Ezkaton\" contains 1 new song, 2 covers, two live modern Behemoth songs and most strangely an old (but ultimately brilliant) one in \"Chant For Ezkaton 2000 e.v.\" in both re-recorded and live versions. One must ask the question why an EP is being released to glorify a song released 5 LPs and nigh on 10 years ago when Behemoth have had countless great songs since, not least on \"The Apostasy\", a question to which I speculate only the record label know the answer.\n\nThough hardly being a purchase for anyone but the Behemoth-obsessive, \"Ezkaton\" contains some oddities that may be worth a listen to the casual listener. \"Jama Pekel\", a Master's Hammer cover, is the best song on the EP, sounding like a visceral Napalm Death with the brutality pushed to the limit. The best compliment a cover can be awarded is if it motivates one to check out the original band; this one does. The Ramones cover of \"I'm Not Jesus\", while not bad per se suffers primarily through being exactly what it is - a sped-up extreme metal cover of a punk song adversely affected by the extra technicality and tightness of a Behemoth once-over; some things are just better in their simple form. Re-recorded from the original \"Satanica\" version, \"Chant For Ezkaton 2000 E.V.\" is cleaned up and Inferno's drumming brought to the fore to initiate one of the best intro riffs to any extreme metal song; it's great live and on record but best in it's original \"Satanica\" guise I maintain.\n\nBehemoth have earnt the right for a slightly pointless EP such as this off the back of a career of consistently advancing, and brilliant, albums which has seen rise to a titanic status in their field. A worthy purchase for a completist but really it's Behemoth album no. 9 everyone really wants. \n\nOriginally written for Rockfreaks.net\n",
        "\nI have to yet to find a place in my heart for live albums following what seems a generational shift from the 60s/70s/80s when they were a far more valued composition than they seem to be today. Ok I am shamelessly in love with Iced Earth's \"Alive In Athens\" triple-disc compendium, the live album that will still be my favourite of all time 20 years from now, but such works, especially by extreme metallers like Polish titans Behemoth, usually sound overly muddy and never, ever like seeing them in the flesh. There is also the sense of atmosphere lacking on a lot of more extreme metal live albums against those of the likes of Maiden, Mot\u00f6rhead, Saxon et al when they were playing to big audiences who you sensed didn't have the same gig overload that is offered to the wearisome youth of today. All in all I was a little apprehensive when pressing play to \"At The Arena Ov Aion - Live Apostasy\"\n\nAll this is a pity because Behemoth were one of the first truly extreme bands I got into and \"Zos Kia Cultus\" to this day remains in my top 10 extreme metal albums of all time. Also having seen the band on 3 occasions (all in 2005 - I should really catch up with them) I know full well the brutal neck assault that is a Behemoth gig; so could sitting listening to them at home in my slippers drinking water rather over-priced beer provoke the same sorts of feelings? In a nutshell, no. While \"At The Arena...\" is over-laden with so many brutally brilliant tunes it's hard to know where to start (\"Christians To The Lions\", \"Slaves Shall Serve\", \"Antichristian Phenomenon\", \"As Above So Below\", \"Chant For Ezkaton 2000\" anyone?) and the sound is brilliantly audible with just the right level of audience participation to make it acceptable, the fallibilities of a live album are revealed at the moments when Nergal is clearly holding up something (that 'something' being a Bible) and 'in-between' moments when one almost feels embarrassed for using the time to have a stretch, or pausing to go to the toilet. It just ain't the same as the beer, sweat and corpsepaint of a hyperactive Behemoth gig.\n\nAs everyone knows about Behemoth these days, musicianship is of the absolute highest level - solos like the exemplars in \"Sculpting The Throne Ov Seth\" ring loud and true and Inferno is still a pillaging monster behind the skins even if he does sound too triggered during the brief solo in the album's center. The setlist is spread nicely over a large segment of Behemoth's discography right back to \"Satanica\" with two of the BM oldies sneaking in, giving a lovely balance for fans old and new with the consummate frontman in Nergal, unwaveringly confident in his band and material and dedication to self-capitulation of the throat. Concluding with a mark is difficult so follow this simple guideline - if you like extreme metal AND live albums you will absolutely love this; if either float your boat still take the time to investigate \"At The Arena...\"; if you dislike extreme metal and live albums why the fuck are you still reading?! \n\nOriginally written for Rockfreaks.net\n",
        "\nBehemoth have become something of an institution onto themselves, essentially developing the loose relationship that black and death metal have with each other in a very unique way. One could qualify their sound as being the peculiar marriage of Vader and Immortal, bringing the rapid fire brutality and monstrous vocalizations of the former in alignment with the unique melodic character of the latter. Of late this hybrid has been brought into a somewhat more pristine light production wise, to the point of resembling the polish of Metallica\u2019s \u201cBlack Album\u201d, which is probably the chief source of the band\u2019s newfound popularity, despite being leagues above the most advanced deathcore or metalcore band in both technical prowess and songwriting.\n\nMany approach their recent works, particularly \u201cDemigod\u201d up to the present as modern in character, which is a good bit misleading. I admit to being guilty of attributing this label to their recent works as well, of which I\u2019ve been fairly lukewarm when compared to their 90s material in both their old and new style, but what does that really tell anyone about their music. When most think modern they tend to picture repetitive groove riffs, dumb down song structures, few guitar solos and a smattering of Industrial influences, none of which are to be found in this band\u2019s sound. In fact, apart from the super clean and loud production and Nergal\u2019s Piotr Wiwczarek inspired guttural barks, there\u2019s almost nothing modern about \u201cEvangelion\u201d apart from it coming out this year.\n\nWhile \u201cDemigod\u201d came off as just a bit too polished for its own good and \u201cThe Apostasy\u201d was a little bit light in the songwriting department, \u201cEvangelion\u201d proves to be the strongest of their last 3 offerings. Part of this can be attributed to a somewhat more tasteful use of atmospheric affects and a more memorable set of ideas being put together just right. \u201cDefiling Morality Ov Black God\u201d and \u201cOv Fire And The Void\u201d, in particular, just stand out with really well crafted Middle Eastern themes and blackened melodic riffs. This is the sort of stuff that Dimmu Borgir could be accomplishing right now if they weren\u2019t so stuck in such a tight songwriting box, or later Emperor and Ihsahn\u2019s material if it weren\u2019t to the opposite extreme of wandering aimlessly in search of a coherent song.\n\nEverything on here is consistently entertaining, avoiding a redundant Deicide approach of dwelling on a particular feel or beat for too long, and avoiding the overuse of blast beats common to this style. Inferno\u2019s drum work proves to be adept, as well as aggressive, switching from blinding double bass blurs to restrained straight beats like a well tuned machine. When combined with the dense textures of dark thudding riffs and woeful tremolo leads, and the occasional flash of guitar solo intrigue, what emerges commands attention like a legion of war paint totting savages would. Particularly noteworthy is the closer \u201cLucifer\u201d, which outclasses \u201cDemigod\u201d closing epic \u201cThe Reign Ov Shemsu-Hor\u201d and actually comes close to matching some of Immortal\u2019s post \u201cPure Holocaust\u201d epics.\n\nThere are enough Theosophy junkies and head banging lunatics out there to keep bands like this going forever, but in the end all that really matters is the game of notes behind the ideology, and here Behemoth really delivers a formidable contribution to the sound. What they\u2019re doing is very unique and new, yet will also likely outlive the recent deluge of brutal bands who thinking blast beating the listener into oblivion alone makes for a great album. They are one of the few bands out there that deserve the popularity they\u2019ve received, and have achieved by doing the exact opposite of what many metal bands tend to do, which is water down a good idea. This vintage is as pure and strong as pure liquor, but will shock your ears rather than your liver.\n\nOriginally submitted to (www.metal-observer.com) on August 26, 2009.\n",
        "\n\u201cAll hail slain and risen god!\nAll hail Dionysus!\u201d\n\nThey have returned, the most blasphemous force out of Poland since the heliocentric model. \u201cEvangelion\u201d translates to \u201cgood news,\u201d in this case for the Behemoth fanboys; but recent critics should pay attention to this remarkable improvement over 2007\u2019s \u201cThe Apostasy.\u201d Fans of \u201cZos Kia Cultus\u201d should delight in this return to form, while those who acclaim \u201cDemigod\u201d shall witness a stunning progression. However, that\u2019s not to say either work has been surpassed. Still, it\u2019s awkward to give such praise to a Metal act so commercially exalted as to appear at Ozzfest and like events so abhorrent to the Underground.\n\nExpectedly, this is the modern Death Metal Behemoth has come to epitomize: professional production, chaotic riffing and solos, and gratuitous amounts of blast-beats. Add in the band\u2019s trademark use of Asiatic melodies, ancient mythology, and overuse of the preposition \u201cOv.\u201d\nOpening hymn \u201cDaimonos\u201d blasts off with all guns blazing, as does \u201cShemhamforash,\u201d with such passionate violence not achieved since \u201cSlaves Shall Serve.\u201d Arguably the strongest tracks on the album, they envelope the listener in a maelstrom of blast-beats and blood-pumping riffs. Behemoth sacrificed technicality so as to honor the wall-of-sound principle, often borrowing Black Metal elements to achieve depth and flow. Jumping ship to a new producer also helped.\n\nA little known fact is that Behemoth started out as pure Black Metal in the mid 90\u2019s, and such reminisces permeate the album: an arpeggio here, a tremolo there, and even some Mayhem-style melodies. You\u2019ll hear this especially in the closing track, where the band steps out of character for a simplistic, yet utterly sinister postlude. \n\nOf course, this is Death Metal at its heart. \u201cTransmigrating Beyond Realms Ov Amenti\u201d could have come straight off of \u201cDemigod,\u201d sustaining a high level of brutality throughout the album. Matching this is Nergal\u2019s vitriolic vocals, sounding pissed-off as ever. It\u2019s a shame his Black Metal scream is completely gone. Inferno mixes up the cymbal work and fills on top of his nearly constant blasting, but his other drum patterns are too few and uninteresting. Orion\u2019s bass, while adding firepower, does nothing remarkable (though I still recommend his band Vesania). \n\nThis being the band\u2019s ninth studio album, it\u2019s no surprise their dearth of fresh ideas. Few things, not even the guitar solos, are exceptional. Rather the album works on a consistent theme, rather than a mediocre sequence punctuated by sensational singles. However, the band has already premiered a music video for \u201cOv Fire and Void,\u201d parts of which remind me of the one Rammstein did for \u201cMein Teil.\u201d The downside of such homogeneity is that the formula gets tedious after a while. Three or four songs into it, you\u2019ve gotten all it has to offer, and the rest is recycled material until the recessional hymn in this unholy mass of ordinary time.\n\nThis year has seen a dramatic resurgence of old school Death Metal, with stellar releases by Asphyx, Excoriate and Slugathor (personal chart-toppers). But as always, Behemoth continue to carry the new school\u2019s standard into battle against religion, society and your eardrums.\n",
        "\nBehemoth's ninth studio effort titled 'Evangelion' was the most anticipated release of the year for me but to be honest it let me down on some fronts. The album is epic sounding but not an outstanding by any measure. The rating that I have given here is a little more than what it should get solely based on the fact that I am a big fan of Behemoth.\n\nTechnically the album is at the same level as the previous two efforts 'Demigod\u2019,\u2019 The Apostasy' and it could be safely said that they have come down on the technicality of drums and the guitar solos as well. As pointed out very well in the earlier review that Nergal seems to be running out of ideas for creating songs. The first thing that you will notice instantly in the songs is the variation which is missing like earlier albums. The songs continue keep going on a main riff unlike other albums. I have always loved solos on a behemoth album because they stand out from the song as an individual entity but it does not feel so in this album as the solos are not that effective.\n\nBut now moving on to the positives of the album which help you grasp this album. Firstly the production on the album is crystal clear and what exactly you would want on a metal album making it possible to hear every single riff and cymbal, crash and toms being hit by Inferno. The vocals are more human like and raspy as compared to Demigod but not as aggressive or passionate as Zos Kia Cultus or Thelema.6.But a definitive change from all the other albums that songs also include long shrieks which were absent in almost all behemoth albums. The motive of Nergal and Co. seemed to make an album sound more epic than 'in your face\u2019 because there are lesser blast beats, more groove based song structures, more riff-age and songs that could be played in big arenas.\n\nThe album starts with a very dynamic intro in the opening track 'Daimonos' which sets the stage for the epic feeling that goes on from the 1st second of the album to the last one. It is a fast song with an intense build up and brutal choruses which finally progress into a long solo which just gives it a perfect behemoth song and one of the best openers that Behemoth has had. Another stand out track is 'Ov fire and Void' which is by far one of the slowest songs by Behemoth but is an epic song and has a brooding feel which really hits you hard and makes you bang your head with a lot of intensity. The grooviest song to come out from the Behemoth camp is also in this album by the name of 'The Seed Ov I' which has one of the best breakdowns I have come across in a Behemoth album. Other stand out track would be 'Transmigrating Beyond Realms Ov Amenti' and 'Shemhamfarosh' which are typical blast beat affairs with the Behemoth rage that makes them more enjoyable.\n\nAnother high point of the album is as usual Inferno's drumming, he has shifted from blasting like a typical death metal drummer to one who includes intricate patterns between songs and add flavor to these brutal creations. There are much more drum rolls and better fills as compared to any drummer out there. If this is your first Behemoth album then I would suggest you to start with Demigod or Thelema.6 as they are one of their best pieces but this album is good nonetheless.\n",
        "\nBehemoth is a band I know little about. In fact, before this, I hadn\u2019t heard more than a few songs, which were good, but not good enough to hook me into any albums before now. Call it one of those situations where there\u2019s just too much music out there to hear everything. Keep that in mind as I bite deep into the throes of their newest release entitled Evangelion.\n\nSo, really, why are these guys popular? Because they fucking kick ass, that\u2019s why! There\u2019s nothing here but a solid forty minutes of riff-tastic, blasting, blasphemous Death Metal fun, executed with enough polish to stay relevant in the metal mainstream but not enough to weaken the excellent crunch on display. The songs are all of manageable lengths, Nergal\u2019s vocals are energetically visceral and punishing, the guitars are heavy and malicious and the drums blast away like cannonballs at a fortress. Pretty much every track has some killer parts to it, with some great grooves and blasting and unholy riff assaults on the ears, and it\u2019s so furious and intense that you might actually need to pause it for a second and take a breather!\n\nBehemoth as a band have clearly got a good sense of songwriting here; epic, angry and tight as hell. They vary up their sound a fair bit, as on the especially groovy and commercial \u201cOv Fire and the Void,\u201d which still manages to kick ass, and on songs like \u201cThe Seed ov I\u201d and several others that have slow, doomy stomps to trade off with the blasting frenzy of the rest of it. The riffs are relatively simple and basic, but they\u2019re done with enough aggression and power to remain thoroughly fun for most of this album\u2019s duration. A couple songs like \u201cDefiling Morality Ov Black God\u201d aren\u2019t as distinguished, but it\u2019s not a big deal, as everything still generally sounds good.\n\nAt the end of the day, what the hell can you say about these pure-evil Polish bastards? They may not spell the word \u201cof\u201d like we do, but they do make some solid fucking music. Evangelion, packed as it is with songs as good as \u201cDaimono,\u201d \u201cShemhamforash\u201d and the crawling, dirgey 8 minute monster \u201cLucifer,\u201d is a good album that any Death Metal fan should be able to enjoy in 2009. Worthy.\n\nOriginally written for http://www.metalcrypt.com\n",
        "\nWhile many bands or albums that have been coined with the term \u201cepic\u201d, I have found that most of them are undeserving of the title. In the case of Behemoth and their latest release, \u201cEvangelion\u201d it\u2019s safe to say that the term \u201cepic\u201d is easily appropriate in describing both the album that has been released, as well as the band that has released it. So now that we\u2019ve determined that Behemoth\u2019s \u201cEvangelion\u201d is epic, we need to determine just how epic it really is. \n\nSo lets say \u201cDemigod\u201d and \u201cThe Apostasy\u201d had some horrific and all-powerful offspring together. That offspring would be \u201cEvangelion\u201d. All of the intensity and power of both previous albums, but with a more blackened feel reminiscent of older Behemoth releases like \u201cZos Kia Cultus\u201d and \u201cThelema 6\u201d. Add a level of technicality that Behemoth has never before displayed along with the surprise of not sounding anything like their disappointing \u201cEzkaton EP\u201d (which is a very good thing) and you have something that\u2019s achieved a level of greatness that none of the other Behemoth albums have ever come close to reaching. \n\nNergal\u2019s vocals are top notch throughout all of \u201cEvangelion\u201d from the all out yells to his mighty growls and never seem strained or too forced. As always, the lyrics are both creative and inspiring, which only add to improve the feel of the songs. As I mentioned before, the level of technicality that Behemoth has reached on this album is much higher than anything else that they\u2019ve released. Songs like \u201cTransmigrating Beyond Realms Ov Amenti\u201d prove this right off the bat from the opening riff, which is both heavy, and complex. Not only are the riffs created by Nergal and Seth more technical, but they\u2019re also incredibly memorable. Just try listening to \u201cOv Fire and the Void\u201d for the first time and not repeat it again for the sake of hearing the main riff over and over again. \n\nAs for the rhythm section of Orion and Inferno, both have made improvements in their playing. Orion is now clearly audible throughout most of the album, and often times makes creative runs of his own throughout a song to add more feel while still providing a thick low end. Inferno, who was already a modern day drum messiah to begin with, has somehow increased his playing abilities to the point of attaining a god-like status as a drummer. His playing his both blindingly fast, as well as immensely precise in each song.\n\nOverall, this is Behemoth at its best. Relentless, heavy, and truly epic. Stand out tracks: \u201cDiamonos\u201d, \u201cOv Fire and the Void\u201d, Transmigrating Beyond Realms Ov Amenti\u201d, and \u201cLucifer.\u201d\n\nAlthough I have rarely felt that an album has deserved a full 100%, I strongly feel that this will not only be a prime contender for metal album of the year with enough push behind it to win over all other albums, but I also feel that this has the potential to be considered a classic, and standard setter by many people from here on out. For these reasons, I\u2019m awarding this album with a perfect score.\n",
        "\nReview originally published at http://www.teethofthedivine.com by Erik Thomas\n\nI\u2019ve kind of dreaded writing this review ever since I gave Evangelion a few spins. Seeing as Behemoth has reached Dismember, Bolt Thrower, Suffocation and Grave levels of consistency and quality, they have arguably surpassed Vader as Poland\u2019s premier metal export and almost certainly should be considered death metal royalty at this point in their career. So giving Evangelion a lukewarm review was somewhat disconcerting for me.\n\nPersonally, Behemoth peaked with Zos Kia Cultus and while I enjoyed Demigod and The Apostasy, the band\u2019s gradually increased nods towards Nile, over processed production and essentially interchangeable songs made the albums rather forgetful over the long haul, while I still play Zos Kia Cultus regularly. And to be honest, I thought Nergal might be running out of ideas with some lackluster covers and the 34th reworking of \u201cChant for Eschaton\u201d appeared on the Ezkaton EP.\n\nOn the positive side, we have a new label, along with it a new producer (Colin Richardson) and as you\u2019d expect, the result is a slightly different sound from the previous, huge, loose sounding efforts. Evangelion is much tighter, compressed and natural as opposed to the massive, layering and echoing tones of The Apostasy and Demigod. Nergal\u2019s vocals are a little more natural and fluid instead of horridly over produced and processed, resulting in an album that sounds much less overbearing and synthetic. Also, there seems to be a slightly lessened role of theatrics and dramatic elements as Nergal and co seems to have battened down the hatches and focused on actual riffs and furious death metal delivery as opposed to some of the extraneous choirs and synths that graced The Apostasy- the change is minimal, as there are a few injections of synths and Middle Eastern tangents, but its noticeable.\n\nAnd thus lies part of Evangelion\u2019s disappointment for me. After the first couple of typically Behemoth-y tracks, (\u201dDaimonos\u201d, \u201cShemhamforash\u201d) where the excitement of a new Behemoth album overrides expectation and the enjoyment is highest, the album tends to blend into a rather relentless, dare I say Hate Eternal blast fest that blows by with an admittedly furious presence, but leaves little other impression. A couple of the albums tracks like personal favorite \u201cHe Who Breeds Pestilence\u201d (with more than a nod to Nile with a \u2018Mars, Bringer of War\u2019 synth line), \u201cAlas Lord is Upon Me\u201d and the slow closer \u201cLucifer\u201d reign things in but other wise the entire mid section of the album left me rather flat; In particular, \u201cShemhamforash\u201d (after the excitement from the first couple of listens wears off), \u201cOv Fire and The Void\u201d (arguably the album\u2019s most rehashed track), \u201cTransmigrating Beyond Realms Ov Amenti\u201d, \u201cThe Seed Ov I\u201d, and \u201cDefiling Morality Ov Black God\u201d just seemed \u2018there\u2019 to fill space with intense, relentless blasting flocked with some Esoteric Arabic tinkling here and there.\n\nI\u2019m sure I\u2019m in the minority here, but the truth is, even with the opening tracks, nothing on Evangelion jumped out and truly commanded my attention like say \u201cAs Above, So Below\u201d, \u201cPazuzu\u201d, \u201cLibertheme\u201d or \u201cConquer All\u201d did from prior albums, and to be quite frank, by the time the crawling 8-minute closer, \u201cLucifer\u201d is halfway done, i\u2019m prety sure i\u2019ve heard most of the riffs on prior albums and I\u2019m actually kind ov bored, which I never thought Id say about a Behemoth album.\n\nThat all being said, Evangelion is still a quality Behemoth album and you don\u2019t expect anything ground breaking, but I didn\u2019t expect it so sound so recycled, despite the strong performance of drummer Inferno and all the elements that made Behemoth so enjoyable and consistent before. Still, I imagine Evangelion will sneak onto a few shallow fan boy year end lists. But personally, I actually kind of miss the over the top, theatrical Nile worship of the last two albums.\n",
        "\nAdmittedly, I do enjoy some of the death metal output that this band has done more recently, but Sventevith is an album by the once little Behemoth that could-and did-is far superior and preferable to what they play now. The interesting thing is, I don't even think Sventevith is Behemoth's best. The better album by them is actually an EP: And The Forests Dream Eternally. It was rawer and had more of an old school sound to it that I found even more appealing. This LP is no slouch though. It has a harried pace of hateful aggression while having the know how to stop and take in some melodic inspiration. Despite having a surprisingly polished sound, it's still successful in sounding old and musky the way a lot of black metal should. \n\nThe best thing going for this album is its scope and energy conjuring up great black metal influences but still being unique of Polish metal. This all sounds adventurous with a two tone color of sound being in black and white. The guitar tone is consistent with the very best representation of how it should be done in black metal. The drumming while nothing special is full and hostility and it nicely cohabits in distortion with Nergal\u2019s guitar and on Wolves Guard My Coffin they give the song all it\u2019s power. Much of this album reminds me of old Carpathian Forest but there are other exaltations too such as early Satyricon. Some of the sweetest sounding black metal is anything that can sound like Immortal which is why I found Forgotten Cult of Aladaron to be one of the best songs on here. Go listen to that transition at 2:09 to see what I mean. The biting iciness of the blasts that go along with those riffs will stifle you like a brain freeze from Blashyrkh. From the Pagan Vastlands also has some qualities that touch on that great Immortal sound. \n\nHidden in a Fog is a standout track though the version found in the subsequent EP puts it to shame. Great lyrics and it almost has a sing along quality to it. It\u2019s about pagan vampires. Behemoth still uses that type acoustical guitar underlay in some of their songs of today. Here, it is found at the beginning giving it a rustic and archaic decoration of folk. Nergal\u2019s vocals are the same in this song as they are in most of the others but they don\u2019t really fit into this arrangement very well. It came off is a bit forced to me. And don\u2019t you hate it when a really good song kills its own momentum at the end? I think that is also what plagues Hidden. It just winds down with a languid and rambling piano dominated dirge. The song does put excellent use to synth choral chants and organ backing. Along with the other songs, Nergal impresses here with tremolo picked guitars below the richness. The good thing about the ending is the long bass tone that fades down gradually to make way for the ambient following track.\n\nAncient is very similar to Burzum\u2019s Han Som Reiste from Det Som Engang Var but actually superior to that song. It\u2019s a solemn little melodic interlude that shouldn\u2019t be overlooked. Every time I hear it, there is a proscenium visual of an old condemned church in the middle of the Silesian woods where specters of an ancient coronation for a Justinian tyrant haunt. A dark storybook feel to the black metal is never a bad thing. Hell Dwells on Ice is the other melodic song but it\u2019s at the end of the album and has beautifully apocalyptic lyrics. Yes this soft enchanting piece is sung in English but you wouldn\u2019t know it unless you looked at a lyric sheet because of the pronunciations. Hell Dwells On Ice sounds like an early Katatonia song.\n\nSventeveth is a very good and rock solid album from Behemoth. It\u2019s always had just the sound of black metal that I crave and it finds the right moments to establish black metal scenery other than derived repetition. Lyrics are a strength and so is the overall riff design. Behemoth decided to move forward into death metal with an interest in Sumerian gods and demons. The genre has changed but you can spot the fascination in war and evil here too and the ambition is very apparent. But personally, I prefer being bludgeoned by Baltic hailstones than Babylonian firestorms.\n",
        "\nThis is legendary demo of one of famous bands on black/death metal scene. None of Behemoth\u2019s subsequent releases has such spirit as this one. All their other albums sound too different and contain quite otherwise feelings. Only here, we can find primordial purity of really Black metal, the black metal that no one plays in our times. This amazing demo purports to be acknowledged as an album because of strong and serious musical and lyrical conception. It is not ordinary weak and penny-a-line odd job made by lazy yet \u2018ideological\u2019 teens, but almost masterpiece of blackest of the black musical genres.\n\nIt opens with low mystical sound of keys and nice hissing of cassette tape. \u2018\u2026Of My Worship\u2019 sounds just terrible alike to the beginning black mass or other diabolic rituals, while I was listening to this majestic intro the horrible atmosphere deepened in the air. Here is simple but serious performance. In addition, there is no superfluous or far-fetched thing - just only descending darkness and preparation for vicious unholy and blasphemous obscurantism. \n\nMinor tones in the beginning of \u2018Summoning of the Ancient Gods\u2019 give birth to morbid ungodly riffs. These riffs are excellent. Drums are surd deep and hypnotizing it sounds like some kind of ritual toms. Of course, vocals are malicious and morbid. Demoniac inhuman voice breaks through the thickness of sepulchral sound. \u2018Mystic voices lead me to suicide\u2026 obscure my soul\u2026\u2019 It builds dark and dismal atmosphere of mystical or religious perversion. All next songs are amazing and great, all guitars sound perfectly during half an hour. Riffs have its main inspiration in the legacy of Hellhammer; they are evil, morbid but fascinating. Keys on this demo are most dark I have heard especially they create occult atmosphere of Devil-worshipping. Song by song you descend into depths of medieval obscurity. \n\nEventually, it is absolute masterpiece of old school Black metal, one of the very few releases where exists such kind of occult and mystic ambience. Unfortunately, it was the first and the last Behemoth\u2019s release in that kind.\n",
        "\nThis snare intro is from the title track, and I\u2019m beginning this review off mentioning this because let me tell you\u2026\n\nBetween a Twix bar, telling your significant other you\u2019re getting deployed, and killing Bambi\u2019s mom, this snare intro is the BEST way to break the ice, escape an awkward moment, cut off someone from talking / cut off a song from playing, or just having a few seconds to think. It\u2019s saved me from life-threatening situations and it, too, can save you:\n\n\u201cHoney, I\u2019m preg-\u201d\n\nTickle Tick, Tick Tick Tick Tickle Tickle\u2026\n\n\u201cMr. Obama, can you please explain how you intend to manage health care while dealing with soaring unemployment.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, um-\u201d\n\nTickle Tick, Tick Tick Tick Tickle Tickle\u2026\n\nNot only that, but it\u2019s probably the best track on here since it encompasses everything Behemoth are damn well known for: epic progression, authentic themes, beastly vocal assaults, contemporary battery annihilation, primeval riffs, and an overall vibe that slays all fakers by just the mere snare intro. The middle eastern influence that began having an impact back on Pandemonic Incantations has pretty much taken a full swing on this album, so you\u2019ll be hearing tons coming from that direction during interludes, intros, outros, with monolithic riffs and more. It\u2019s quite a spectacle how much of a comeback this album is compared to the letdown (in my eyes) Thelema.6 happened to be. I wouldn\u2019t be lying when saying that even the bass does some justice to the ancient cultures. There\u2019s more of a boom here than the pluck heard on the last album, so even the bass gloriously took back its founding duties.\n\nAt the time, this was the heaviest Behemoth album, but not by a ton. Satanica had a huge wall of sound, but here is where they really took hold of death metal and brought out all the guns. The production is perfect, with every instrument balanced properly and Nergal\u2019s vocals back on par. Compared to Demigod they sound like a puppy\u2019s shy bark, but they\u2019re still powerful on their own, especially if you take into account everything his vocals mustered up before. Drumming sounds incredibly intense, precise, fast, and vicious \u2013 Inferno always had his shit together, but here he knocks it up one level to make up for being part of the last album. Gotta also thank his dumb ass for that snare intro.\n\nThe songs all have decent lengths, with the more ambitious ones obviously being the longer ones. However, even the shorter tracks pack a punch with compelling bridges \u2013 they never let up that besieging attitude. Even the two very short tracks add to the ritualistic vibe and heavily arcane atmosphere, which now sounds like the best time to bring the cover art into the fray\u2026\n\nYou\u2019re god damn right, the cover art\u2026 just look at it. Now when I started getting into Behemoth, I doubt I\u2019d believe ever getting into this album solely based on the cover art. The man-goat-dude looks so sick, perverse, occult, and twisted as he\u2019s brought to life in the aura of Hell\u2019s scarlet zephyr. It\u2019s just such a despicably evil cover art that I can\u2019t help love \u2013 way cooler than the poseur on Demigod.\n\nDefinitely check this one out, guys. It\u2019s a great album that I feel fully transitioned Behemoth into death metal while still having a small black touch. It\u2019s not the blackest of black touches, but like pepper sprinkled in the cauldron of infernal devastation. It\u2019s a nasty album that begs to be heard, and I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll possess you just as easily as it possessed me.\n",
        "\nNo joke, the David Bowie cover is the best track on here. Sadly, Behemoth\u2019s original material pales in comparison and the other covers just suck. The clean vocals on it aren\u2019t all that bad knowing how Bowie sings, and the execution is so sinister sounding and evil \u2013 coupled with the satisfying approach and it pretty much slays.\n\nThe other cover tracks are very short, spanning from two minutes to four minutes. Regardless, they all bore me to death and aren\u2019t really worthy extra material, which is unfortunate but not too surprising coming from lame bands like Sarc\u00f3fago, Mayhem, and the ever-atrocious Morbid Angel. Actually, I take that back \u2013 the Mayhem cover sounds pretty much like a death metal equivalent of the original track \u2013 and that\u2019s a good thing. Even the \u201cFrom The Pagan Vastlands\u201d reexamination track sounds like a decent death metal cover of the original song. The production for each of them is just as good as Thelema.6 standards, but they\u2019re just as dull and boring as most of the tracks on that album, as well. \n\nThe style itself is much like Thelema.6, so its not a stark departure in the end. Nay, we\u2019d have to wait until Zos Kia Cultus for anything of value. This EP is like the bonus tracks that didn\u2019t make it on the final cut because that would ruin the experimental nature of said album. \n\nI don\u2019t understand why this EP is sought after at all, since most of the material on it is pretty much a waste. You have what: one decent track from the album, one kickass cover, one decent cover, and the rest serving as cow dung? Not worth the money or time in my eyes. Even the video clip attached showcases a mediocre song over a live performance, so I\u2019d hardly trade in my money for that deal.\n",
        "\nThe quality of this video has no doubt degraded over the years \u2013 and yes I\u2019m watching the actual VHS for this because my library had a copy. I hope not to judge it based on the declining analog, but that\u2019s the product it was issued as first, so I have no choice but to be a little lenient. \n\nThe stage Behemoth play on looks pretty cool: lights are vibrant and colorful, the platform is pretty big and themed well for Behemoth\u2019s music at the time, most all the members go berserk playing their instruments, and the crowd is apeshit to say the least.\n\nNergal also has some funny ass lines between songs, even though it\u2019s in Polish. \n\n\u201cSomething something something something something something FFFROOMM DE PAAAGAAN! Vastlands\u2026\u201d \n\nHahahahaha\u2026 right after that Nergal spews out flames from a burning torch above the crowd, much like in his black metal days and damn does it still look awesome. I do wish there were subtitles during these parts, since this is a video and not just some half-assed recording. It might seem only odd to me, but who claps after a Behemoth piece? I can understand yelling and screaming in admiration, but clapping? It\u2019s courteous, sure, but seems a bit out of place. I\u2019ve clapped after some black metal bands play live, but I\u2019d never expect that after Behemoth plays a song.\n\nLuckily, much of the quality remains intact, so there isn\u2019t a huge difference between the studio version (comparison to Satanica) and these live versions. Double bass isn\u2019t too loud, but the rest of the kit sounds clear and brutal. Bass probably has the weakest output, but it\u2019s hardly the mishap that kills the performance. On this copy, the guitars sound a little faded but still tear through the crowd nicely, so I guess I\u2019ll call it good. I have yet to see any screw-ups, which is a big plus since bands sometimes have fuck-ups even on these videos.\n\nNergal sounds just as gnarly and demonic as he was on Satanica so that\u2019s a huge plus knowing that he can reproduce the same growl live as he did in the studio. Thankfully, camera angles are decent , my favorite of which being two:\n\n-\tThe moving shots that capture the entire stage and crowd\n-\tAny shot with Inferno\n\nSolo shots focus up on whichever member is performing the solo, which more than never is Nergal. He also is wearing a weird ass shirt \u2013 like something from a Backstreet Boys video\u2026 can\u2019t believe I\u2019m making that reference\u2026 then again, Millennium was the hottest thing on the market at the time of this video\u2019s release.\n\nThe best performance by far is \u201cChant For Eschaton 2000,\u201d which the band was able to duplicate like crazy onto the stage. No, I\u2019m not hearing the studio version dubbed over the live performance \u2013 I\u2019m hearing the real deal: lights blazing like flames, Inferno beating the war rhythm of Hell, fans flailing like demons, and tremolo licking up all the evil a live setting can conjure. It\u2019s great to really see them pull off the song so well, and especially without losing the attitude and quality (combined with great camera shots). I\u2019m noticing also that bass seems to be prominent in some songs more than others, which kind of messes with your head and makes you think you hear it other times when you really don\u2019t.\n\nI\u2019m not too sure why Behemoth wouldn\u2019t endorse the DVD version, since it comes with extra material and likely has much better quality than this release. CDs still sound great after even twenty years, but a VHS like this that isn\u2019t even a decade old really hasn\u2019t aged as well as it should have. I may make Nergal angry by saying this, but check out the DVD. It surely enhances the listening and visual experience, and believe me when I say you\u2019d enjoy it more than this rusty VHS version.\n",
        "\nYeah I though that reviewing Behemoth\u2019s entire discography fatigued me and required other bands to refresh my senses, but this was the least of excuses. Trying to sit the entire album is equivalent to taking the SAT (for Americans), the STAT (for Australians), or the Abitur (for Germans) all over again.\n\nFor some reason I find a real lack of substance and charm that the other albums carried with them. I could notice these traits upon first listen, but with this one the vibe is lost and it\u2019s hard for me to sit through even the first song without wanting to hear another band or even just past Behemoth songs (which might as well classify as another band if I wanted to go back far enough).\n\nAlthough the atmosphere is completely dead, I will acknowledge that some songs are pretty good. Most of them have a decimating groove to headbang along with; the most prominent being in the single \u201cAntichristian Phenomenon,\u201d \u201cNatural Born Philosopher,\u201d and the last three tracks (excluding \u201cThe End\u201d). Regardless, every song sounds rushed, inconsistent, and somewhat experimental. Hearing Satanica one can identify a theme and the epicness entailed, resulting in throwing up the horns or writing a twenty page college essay on the matter. With this album, it\u2019s much harder to digest and I\u2019m not even sure if it\u2019s worth it since most of the songs just don\u2019t have the strength to hold their own.\n\nWe get more of an ancient, Middle Eastern tuneful tracklist with the lasting power of a melodeath band and the force of a second-rate death metal clone. It\u2019s a lousy combination with lackluster consequences, a shame considering what Behemoth were capable of and what they will be capable of after this album. Drumming is by far the most consistently awesome part about Behemoth\u2019s music, with the shortcomings of this album not hindering the performance at all. Surely, it may seem out of place with a constant barrage of blast beats and all, but Inferno\u2019s pace, striking power, and endurance all come in at equally correct moments \u2013 all of which sounding hefty, witty, and unrestricted. He sounds much better on other albums, but I wouldn\u2019t question his authority of this music.\n\nWith that said, production sounds inferior to Satanica, which had qualities that made you feel caught in a storm of locusts. That production completely surround and proceeded to trample over you, while Thelema.6 merely has very good production that sounds a volume notch lower and doesn\u2019t have any motivation or inspiration at all.\n\nGuitar potency, as mentioned, leans towards Middle Eastern clemency, plays melodically, hastily (lots of tremolo), and produces some grooves that are catchier than others. With the same amount of time it wastes on pinch harmonics, dull riffs, and other nameless styles that keep the songs more experimental than progressive. They\u2019re a little lower than the drumming in the mix, but somehow capitalize on leaving out the bass. It\u2019s possible to hear it, but unlike the other albums the bass doesn\u2019t seem to leave such a mark \u2013 shitstain or otherwise. Generally it follows the rhythm, which isn\u2019t independent, but at the same time it\u2019s all it can hope to accomplish in a work like this.\n\nConsidering the pace (I\u2019d consider them \u201cfast\u201d enough) and hell even the length of the songs, you better be able to digest, analyze, and write up a lab report before each of them end. Otherwise, you either won\u2019t care or be forced to go back and listen to the songs again, and again, and again, and again. As a last note, Nergal\u2019s growl also sounds drowned out between the instruments \u2013 kind of like he\u2019s distanced himself from the mic. His yell / scream / growl is fluttered and faded \u2013 vicious in execution but airy and thin in actuality.\n\nWhile containing some killer tracks, this album doesn\u2019t hold up against its peers in nearly all accounts. It\u2019s a fair deal \u2013 at this point being the last fair deal gone down. Oh yeah and I hate the cover.\n",
        "\nAs everybody knows, Behemoth was a good band when they were a black metal act. Though it seems that wannabe metal teenies haven't yet realized that, as a death metal act, Behemoth is a bad band.\n\nMain thing that ruins Slaves Shall Serve (as every nowadays Behemoth record), is how this album sounds. This sounds very plastic. Nergal's 'death growl' sounds like wind, since it's effected so heavily. Drums are obviously triggered, at least they sound like a drum machine. Guitars have also been mixed to sound like shit. That's anyway quite indifferent, because most of stuff is not too imaginative. Songs are chaotic as hell, full of crappy riffs. Behemoth are trying to reach aggressive and menacing atmosphere, but fail badly: because of plastic sounds this doesn't sound very heavy, even if there's a lot of bass and a lot of distortion. Drummer Inferno is very good drummer, but his drum lines are not so good, just unimaginative blast beats, blast beats and blast beats.\n\nAlso the tracks are quite bad, though even if they were good, the producing would still make them sound bad, since the mixing is abysmal. Title track is presented here twice - I have vinyl version of this album, so I don't have the music video, which is idiotic anyway. At least the LP release also also presents comical live pictures of band, which look like a bad joke, thanks to 'medieval' clothing of the band... Though it's mediocre track, it's still the best one on this album. It has also very funny lyrics, however I think they weren't met to be funny.\n\nAlso the Nefilim cover \"Penetration\" is alright, though it's not good because of Behemoth, but because it's quite well composed track... Another songs are bad, excluding Danzig cover \"Until You Call on the Dark\", which I hated as Danzig song, and I hate as Behemoth song. It's beyond bad.\n\nTo be honest, I hate the whole EP. If I had a bunch of slaves that would fucking serve, I'd probably like to order them to destroy all copies of this EP.\n",
        "\n***Please read this review as a suggestion. I\u2019m not some conspiracy theorist, and I\u2019ve not talked to any members of Behemoth for clarification of this album. I\u2019ve been pondering whether I should write this review for a very long time due to the amount of reviews already received, but hopefully this will add more than what\u2019s already been discussed.***\n\nI'm getting really sick of the death metal scene. Death metal is a genre that has become too bland, too straightforward, and way too one dimensional. In order to find a death metal band that the listener enjoys these days, the listener needs to discover certain riffs or songs that spike for him or her. Blood Red Throne, for example, has a lot of riffs that just work for me, while all my other friends cannot stand their repetition. Cannibal Corpse all sounds so bland to me, but a considerably large amount of people enjoy them. However, both Blood Red Throne and Cannibal Corpse go after the exact same aesthetic; let's be loud, create \"badass\" riffs and try to fit into the extreme category of music. On the surface, Behemoth's Demigod may be the same thing. However, if one were to look into this album a little bit further, there's so much more going on that it forces further examination.\n\nI don't know if Behemoth will ever make a better album than this. It's as if Zos Kia Cultus pushed the boundaries of their music and Demigod was an outrage of their creativity. Every song is a death metal song, with riffs that just might \"spike\" for you and some riffs that just move the song along for you while others find a huge enjoyment in that particular part. However, all the melodies on this album mean so much more than just pure ear candy. With this album, everything seems very thought out. Nergal and Seth both do a fine job with harmonization, as if they are playing catch with the melody. On Demigod, there's no \"lead guitar\". There are the guitarists that work together and cannot sound like anything worth a damn without the other. With this element, Demigod is now emancipated from the one dimensional sound that most of the death metal genre is filled with. \n\nThe riffs create a very thick sound, employing lots of chugging and great bass backup by Orion. While the drums focus on the speed of the album, the guitars take their time with the riffs. There are a few songs such as \u201cTowards Babylon\u201d that even the riffs speed up on, but overall the melodies on this album just move a hell of a lot slower than most death metal bands. \n\nInferno's drumming, however, is handled the complete opposite. Without his drumming, the sound wouldn't be nearly as aggressive as it is. His drumming is handled under great control with a ton of speed. The double bass isn't triggered (thank god), but it backs up the guitars very well. His drum fills work very well with the melodies, putting even more emphasis on the aggressive nature of this album. The overall sound on his set is very acoustic, creating a tribal feeling to the percussion. You can tell it's a purposeful thing that he's doing, to create that sound of antiquity that Behemoth has been generally known for.\n\n\nNergals vocal performance is a hit or miss with most people, and for that reason alone they need to be a bit more examined to be appreciated. It is obvious that the multi layered tracks that Nergal shrieks out puts the icing on the cake for brutality, but I get the feeling that there's a whole lot more to his vocals than just an aggressive punch. This album is titled Demigod. Demigods are a half god and half human species in Greek mythology. Being only half human, is it a species that humans can truly relate to at a human level? There\u2019s a whole other half, a godly half to this creature that humans don\u2019t understand. This is what Nergal depicts. His voice isn\u2019t human, and will never be replicated by one human being. Yes, the vocal tracks are multi layered; but in the realm of expression it is one; the voice of a demigod. To top it all off, his lyrics talk a great deal about becoming something more than \u201cmortal\u201d. Just read the lyrics to Conquer All, Demigod, Slaves Shall Serve, or Mysterium Coniunctionis. While perhaps the main ideas behind this albums lyrics differ from one another at the base, the main theme that revolves around each set of lyrics is becoming the demigod. That is where this album becomes a work of fascination, because almost everything comes together at this point of illumination. \n\nThe guitars, the drums, the vocals; they work together to create a fantastic piece of art; the concept of a demigod. As stated earlier, the guitars move slowly, because the demigod of ultra-omnipotence moves just like that. The drums play loud, fast and aggressively to further develop the aggressive nature of the demigod, while the vocals illustrate the mighty voice of it. This being said, I could not see this expression in any better form than in the form of a death metal album. No other genre of music has ever been as loud and aggressive while still maintaining the stability of melody other than death metal. However, I stated in the beginning of the review that I\u2019m sick of the death metal genre. Well, if more death metal was played like this, with a more innovative aesthetic in mind (much like black metal bands tend to do), perhaps I would start listening to more of it again. \n\nIf you are looking for the prime example of what Behemoth\u2019s sounds like at their prime of modern death metal, look no further than the magnificent piece of art by the name of Demigod. This is by far one of the greatest pieces of music I\u2019ve ever came across.\n",
        "\nBlack metal Behemoth. Fuck. Yeah. Suffice to say their blackened death stuff isn\u2019t horrible, but their gold will always be in the creepy, atmospheric, raw black metal that they do rather well. This album is an amalgamation of all their demos and some unreleased tracks, and I got to say it is rather impressive. It\u2019s got an intensely dark atmosphere helped by the eerie fillers, horror-movie esque-riffs and the tortured vocals of Nergal.\n\nOne of the great factors of this album, I found, is where the band found the right niche for production. It isn\u2019t clean, like Dimmu Borgir, so you don\u2019t lose any atmosphere, yet it is clean enough that you can actually hear the instruments individually. As I mentioned before, there is a sort of empty, hollow atmosphere to this added by the creepy fillers/samples, these usually being in the vein of a dark synth with satanic chant or a wolf howling at the moon etc, which gives an all round amazingly evil vibe. The covers of Aggressor and Deathcrush are pretty good too. Hellhammer and Mayhem obviously do it better, but this is quite solid, and surprisingly enough they don\u2019t kill the atmosphere despite being fairly \u201cfun\u201d black metal songs.\n\nThe axe work on here is actually fairly diverse for black metal. Your average song is your blistering fast riffs, but there are also a lot of dark, mellow slower riffs which are cool. A lot of the riffs retain melody to, but not in a weak way like Dimmu Borgir or later Lord Belial. You also have the odd acoustic guitar included to add an interesting kind of medieval feel to it, like in the song \u201cFrom Hornedlands to Lindisfarne\u201d, which can also be noted for using some cool, dark synths. The guitar work isn\u2019t really that technical to be honest, but there is the odd melodic solo and fills which are satisfactory. This all together fits in with the dynamic drum work, which is not your standard double-bass barrage, in fact it is barely ever like that, even during the fast songs. The drumming is usually fairly diverse incorporating the entire drum set most of the time, yet even when the drumming is slow, you can still head bang to it! The sound on it is also quite perfect. It\u2019s bassy, yet not so much that it drowns out anything else, but so much that it comes off as powerful.\n\nNergal actually displays a fairly diverse range when it comes to black metal vocals; he is almost a mime to every style. In some songs he is able to do the talking-style of bands like Mayhem, the high pitched, incoherent screech like Emperor, the average black metal vocals and then his unique, deep growl on the blackened death song \"Transylvanian Forest\". His voice always fits the atmosphere to each song, as some songs are more relevant to a more tortured voice or maybe angry vox. The lyrics generally cover topics such as Satan, death, suicide and winter, typical black metal from Scandinavia, so nothing remarkable there.\n\nI must say, for a demo album, Demonica is listenable in every sense, instead of just being a history lesson about the band. You do get some repetition because some songs are fused into others, but this is rare. If you are a fan of black metal, especially Behemoths\u2019 early work, check this out now. If you are missing some of their black metal work, here is one last fix.\n",
        "\nMy first couple of listens of this album didn't really impress me; the first Behemoth release I ever acquired was 'Demigod', so everything beyond that tends to be underwhelming for obvious reasons. It was only after that I learned to listen to 'Thelema.6' as a somewhat more standard death metal album rather than the verging on unpleasantly epic style the band would later craft that I began to enjoy it more fully. I still don't think it's a great release; it's rather uneven and the structuring and pacing of the album is questionable at best, but it has enough gems amidst its tracks to make it a worthwhile listen for fans of the band.\n\nThe central issue that prevents this from being a more notable Behemoth album is the very strange pacing; starting with the rather awkwardly midpaced opening of 'Antichristian Phenomenon' (which, in many ways, foreshadows the band's later direction), it starts an album full of awkward notes off on... an awkward note. Even within themselves, the songs tend to be all over the place rhythmically and in regards to tempo, and you could say that at no point does 'Thelema.6' ever settle into its own skin, so to speak. The best, most enduring tracks off this album tend to be the simplest and most direct such as 'Christians To The Lions', while others often attempt to make a compromise between more experimental, progressive leanings and catchiness and end up being less for them. 'Thelema.6' is an album full of great but very isolated moments, and I would go as far as to say that this is probably Behemoth's most difficult album to absorb despite its not unreasonable length.\n\nBut let's back up a bit and look at the overall sound of the record. A very clearly transitional work in Behemoth's catalog, one can practically hear the last strains of their black metal past being used up on this release, with some of the riffs, though distinctly Behemoth in nature, certainly lean in a more black metal direction, which would be mostly gone by the next full-length. This is riff and vocal-dominated; Inferno's drumming, while still very good, doesn't yet possess the intense and almost obscenely forward nature it would later carry, leaving Nergal's voice to fill in a lot of the rhythmic gaps. Production tends to accentuate the vocals before everything else, particularly because the instrumental production is somewhat flat and overly simply mixed; nothing stands out, much in the same way as early death metal production tended to be.\n\nIn essence, Behemoth on this album was making epic-style songs within very constrained timeframes, making for an almost Amon Amarth style of instant climaxes with no real release of tension. The riffing, through predominantly death metal, has black metal's flair of artistry and texture about it, which actually goes a long way to give the music an almost avant-garde vibe, particularly when accentuated by the highly discrete and swiftly changing song structures (brought on by track length). The pace of the album generally hovers around a mid to fast with occasional slow, vast sections placed here and there to punch things up, but the rather immediate nature of the structural changes makes this come off as being particularly varied and swiftly moving. I've probably been spoiled by a great deal of black and doom metal, but the longest track being still under five minutes makes this a very quickly moving release. Some things, though, are difficult to explain; the weird covers, the very strange song titles, and the overall feeling of this being a compilation of tracks rather than a complete work are all among them.\n\nThis isn't my favorite Behemoth release by a long shot, but it has enough standout tracks ('Natural Born Philosopher', 'Christians To The Lions', etc.) to make it a worthwhile listen. It's certainly a weird part of the band's career, and like most transitional albums, suffers from a rather unfocused delivery, but it's still generally good music that, minus a few hiccups, deserves at least a few listens from the death metal fan.\n",
        "\nNergal is pissed as shit \u2013 he\u2019s sold his soul to Satan and now you\u2019re the one to pay. Pandemonic Incantations was the one where Behemoth were still attempting to refine their sound, so you can expect that with some refinement and some bargaining with death metal that the group would find their calling. The sound here\u2026 is\u2026 enormous \u2013 everything is louder than a wrecking ball crashing through your house. Nergal growls your face off, the riffs are tremors of doom, bass tears the roof off, and Inferno comes in to finish your pathetic soul. While I wasn\u2019t a fan of Behemoth around the time they got big with Demigod, I did happen to enjoy this album quite a bit. \n\nThe tracks here carry that biblical / historic theme found on their previous album, except now it\u2019s more intense. Again, this sounds rather tame compared to the more recent material, but it\u2019s still like a death metal brick hitting black metal glass. Riff-wise you\u2019d be correct to expect more middle eastern influenced leads, charging tempos, nihilistic tendencies, and some of the most contorted drumming you\u2019ll ever hear. \n\nThe only thing about the guitars I find annoying are the stupid pinch harmonics \u2013 leave that shit to Zakk Wylde because it doesn\u2019t work well here. It makes the whole thing sound artificial and mechanical \u2013 we\u2019re supposed sound like we\u2019re caught in a plague of locusts, remember? It\u2019s not rampant, but you\u2019ll know when you hear them. Bass is grumpy and deep as you\u2019d expect, so behind the riffs you can expect a lot of hefty power. The songs themselves are between fast-paced and mid-paced, unlike Behemoth\u2019s sister group Nile who seem to love making slow songs. The distortion of the leads isn\u2019t raw, but instead grand and hypnotic \u2013 you\u2019ll feel like you can\u2019t help but be put under a ritualistic spell when hearing them. The only thing stopping you from giving in is Inferno\u2019s drumming \u2013 the beast behind the curtain. He\u2019ll blast away blast beats and double bass like stones on the pyramid \u2013 no mercy for anyone. This guy will trample over without thinking twice, and the problems with the snares and cymbals on the last album are completely fixed here, so only trouble awaits you.\n\nHowever, the biggest one to fear is the traitor himself \u2013 Nergal. Selling his soul not only gave him a new look, but also a voice that will rip you in two. His growl isn\u2019t as cavernous and low like on later albums, but it\u2019s fierce, tireless, demonic, and possessed. He\u2019s been juiced, and his roars here overcast every previous growl and scream he attempted.\n\nWith all albums come tracks that somehow outwit the other, but here shows our exception. On the outer layer, much of the songs sound exactly the same: fast/mid-paced, charging, loud, heavy, etc. Once again, the finer details in the riffs and melody do happen to give more than one expects to take. I\u2019ve been listening to this album longer than the rest of Behemoth\u2019s discography, and I can truthfully say that all the songs are varied and spark interest in ways that you\u2019ll have to hear to understand. Again, many will argue that they sound the same, but that just shows how much attention to detail they pay.\n\nI\u2019d highly recommend you check this album out, as I did when I first got into the band. It was my introduction and serves as a better way to get into their death metal material than their black metal material. By this point, there was no turning back \u2013 Behemoth already sold their soul, but they didn\u2019t sell out. They had come along way from their early days, and the only way to age from here was to mature.\n",
        "\nFrom shit, to black metal, to blackened death metal; Behemoth have quite the journey. The intensity can only proceed forward, with this truckstop being the middle of the road between the land of black metal and the land of death metal \u2013 blackened death metal, for lack of giving a shit. Here we see the most prime example of Behemoth today: lyrics dealing more with history and antiquity rather than pagan themes, folk-converted tunes to more biblical / old world inspired themes, and just the general music becoming more like death metal. These signs were present on the last album, but only in small capacities that even the bitch on the cover art couldn\u2019t cover up.\n\nProduction job is almost as good as a blowjob \u2013 compare it to the last album and you\u2019d know where I\u2019m coming from. The tone of the guitars is raw but stirred, convincing, and the riffs themselves very middle-eastern sounding \u2013 again, this is where that biblical shit comes in. You\u2019ll feel like a plague is upon you as the rhythm tramples everything in sight, leaving no mercy in its wake. It\u2019s a more believable approach to the dark nature of the album, relying more on the strength of the riffs and the historical atmosphere as opposed to the black metal characteristics we\u2019re so used to. Treading with this is a bass that rumbles, yet doesn\u2019t really shine as we\u2019d hope it would. It\u2019s clarity is one thing, but from my stereo I can\u2019t get much out of it. The guitars have me in a trance already; in fact, I feel as though I\u2019m in some Egyptian dungeon and am about to be sacrificed as part of a ancient cult ritual too stupid to comprehend. Let me guess, the bitch on the cover is the one performing this\u2026\n\n* out slithers the snake-bitch *\n\n\u2026oh god damnit\u2026\n\nWhile all the songs are generally mid-paced, it doesn\u2019t sound like it. Drumming usually indicates the rhythm, so as you\u2019d expect, Inferno is faster than all holy and hell. Double bass is used so excessively it\u2019s embarrassing, but the real shitstain comes from the snares and cymbals, both sounding artificial and metallic that it doesn\u2019t cooperate well with the organic sound of everything else. For an album trying to sound traditional and historic, you\u2019d expect more natural sounding instruments \u2013 they should have just used bongos. \n\nHa, what a sight \u2013 Inferno on bongos\u2026\n\nMost of the songs themselves sound the same, but it\u2019s the finer details in the riffs and rhythms that set them apart. Early tracks like \u201cThe Thousand Plagues I Witness\u201d and later tracks like \u201cThe Past Is Like A Funeral\u201d sure both sound Sumerian, evil, and taste of sin but have driving melodies that make them differ more than a pop song next to a punk song. The two aforementioned songs could very well be the best ones on this short album, especially considering the shortness of the intro / outro and the\u2026 uh, track that\u2019s completely in Polish? You know, the eighth track according to this page? I dunno, it\u2019s not even a track that fits well with the rest of them \u2013 more like another experimental piece with unfitting vocals and overuse of synths.\n\nNergal typically uses a deeper growl kind of like \u00c5kerfeldt of Opeth, but not as \u201cguttural\u201d or \u201cdeep.\u201d Kind of like how his growls sound on My Arms, Your Hearse - yeah, I\u2019m not too far off on that one. They definitely fit well with the new tone of the album, but overall these traits are tame compared to the later works. \n\nIn truth, this is a great album that is severely overlooked in the Behemoth discography. Black metal fans don\u2019t want to touch it because they consider it part of the death metal era, and death metal fans don\u2019t want to touch it because they already have Satanica and everything after to bathe in. Early in the Grom review I stated that this album was second only to that album in terms of people not giving a shit, but I certainly feel that both are on the same level now. Grom was really the album where the band attempted to identify itself \u2013 it\u2019s experimental core turned off many people and paved the way for this album, which people seem to rub off as well. Sadly people are so easily mistaken, because I feel that this was a step in the right direction. Sure the band\u2019s black metal material has it\u2019s place, but moving on to death metal was a sign of growing up not in terms of just band members, but also a more adult sound.\n",
        "\nGrom introduced the primitive characteristics that Behemoth would begin to build on as they turned blackened death metal and, eventually, straightforward death metal. With this release, these traits are more refined and you can clearly see that change in on its way. The production makes everything out to be black metal, albeit heavily thrash / death influenced. \n\nDrums off the bat sound like shit \u2013 literally hearing the first seconds of the first track lets you know that those drums don\u2019t sound good. Snare has that annoying metallic echo, as do the toms and cymbals. Double bass is overly drowned under the mix of things, which is pathetic since when does anybody NOT want to hear double bass? Here we also see how much blast beats would become a signature tool for the band \u2013 it\u2019s used constantly. This is also the first release with Inferno if I\u2019m correct, so that already tells you that all the songs are fast-paced, more violent than before, and relentless.\n\nRiffs are much of the same melodic tremolo / mid-paced picking, but what we don\u2019t hear is the inert pagan / mystic / occult feeling. It sometimes is there like in the second track, but that\u2019s because the acoustic / folk influence is obvious. We\u2019re beginning to lose the atmosphere that helped shape Behemoth\u2019s sound since the beginning. Synths are still around, but don\u2019t have the chilling effect like before thanks to the more death-like distortion of the guitars. Bass happily is much, much more present and grumpy than ever before. You could hear it separately before, but now it actually is part of the music and even has it\u2019s own moments.\n\nTo think Nergal started out doing death growls was quite a surprise, but after so many years I notice that he\u2019s going back to them. It\u2019s been said that Inferno no doubt had an impact on the music, and ultimately the core of Behemoth really was thrash metal. Gone are the tormented shrieks \u2013 make way for raspy growls! Yeah, raspy screams have no become raspy growls, or else they wouldn\u2019t fit well with the music at all. The vocals reminded me specifically of Satyr\u2019s of Satyricon on Nemesis Divina - sure those are raspy screams, but they\u2019re also a sort of raspy growl. It works both ways, but I find Nergal pulling off a growl more than a scream with this one.\n\nAside from that eyesore of a cover, this EP isn\u2019t that bad. It\u2019s an interesting transition look that we\u2019ll get to hear more of on the next album. This period marks a maturity of Behemoth that most people don\u2019t care to look into much, considering how many love the later albums while others yearn to keep the black metal sound alive.\n",
        "\nBehemoth\n\nWith better production, an increased emphasis on melodically aggressive leads, and really no change to the drumming, we have the crowning jewel of Behemoth\u2019s black metal days. Yes, not Sventevith\u2026, not Grom, not that pile of horseshit called Endless Damnation - this often overlooked recording with a creepy, ethereal glimpse into some enchanted woods. Let this be the entry into some of the most gnarly black metal you\u2019ll hear out of an EP.\n\nI\u2019m so impressed by the leads that I think Infernus from Gorgoroth shit himself so hard in awe that he was unable to write a decent follow-up to Pentagram. The riffs found here aren\u2019t nearly as hateful as Infernus\u2019, but they\u2019re way more energetic, concert-worthy (yeah), have less of an emphasis on tremolo, and really are just more fun to hear. The whole band took on this thrash / black approach that works like a charm with the occult atmosphere that not only are you spellbound, but also in rush trying to bang your head without breaking your neck. The tracks that cater to this method more are \u201cTransylvanian Forest,\u201d \u201cSventevith (Storming Near The Baltic),\u201d and \u201cPure Evil And Hate\u201d (a concert staple, I might add). \n\nThe other two tracks are more atmospheric, haunting, and majestic in nature. They\u2019re slower than the other three and focus more on a crushing melodic riff or tune. \u201cMoonspell Rites,\u201d which happens to (now) be in my top five favorite Behemoth tracks, is the best example and pretty much the best on the album. The tempo is devastating while the drumming maneuvers in a catchy pattern in support of the lead charge, which culminates in one of the most awe striking solo moments at 3:34 that gave me chills up my spine upon first listen. It made the best of Bathory solos look like something off of the fucking Disney channel. The last track works much in the same way, but relies more on a clean guitar tune that still sounds enthralling in its own unique way. Its more of a haunting, folk-driven ritual track that stands out much more as an outro than it\u2019s own track.\n\nBass is almost non-existent on this album, but would you honestly give a shit when there\u2019s so much atmosphere, energy, and effort to cover it up? Nergal himself really could care less, especially considering how much more refined his scream has become. He doesn\u2019t pull off agonizing shrieks anymore like on the debut full-length, but his screams are pretty raspy and throaty, combining extremely well with the buzzy distortion of the guitars.\n\nYou'd be better off sticking with these tracks alone that the sub-par Damnation portion. The tracks don't sound any different to my ears, so in fact this split is a complete waste in general. Go check out the regular EP and you won't need to worry about anything else. The Damnation tracks really kill the appeal of the split itself, so pick this and be disappointed or pick the original EP and be thrilled.\n\nDamnation\n\nDamnation doesn\u2019t do justice to the Behemoth EP, so I\u2019d say go ahead and just forget about this release. I\u2019ll wholeheartedly praise the vocals for Damnation, which are gnarly, inhale-sounding death growls, but the rest of the music boring as hell. The overall tone of the songs is dark, but they really don\u2019t fit the atmosphere of Behemoth. Speaking of which, why the hell would you pit a black metal band and a death metal band together?\n\nThe most annoying part about the Damnation tracks are the friggen\u2019 drumming. The patterns are all right, I guess; it\u2019s typical aggressive double bass and blast beats. My gripe is that the production: double bass sound like pressing computer keyboard keys, cymbals sound like a wasp between two sheets of paper on thin-ice, and the toms are so drowned between them that it makes my ears tremble. Bass completely follow the rhythm of the guitars, which they themselves are dull most of the time. The solos themselves are spacey, but when the riffs are dull themselves it\u2019s hard to really feel for them.\n\nThere\u2019s also this fucking annoying high-pitched frequency in the production, and since I had C4 explode next to me, this high-pitched noise\u2026is\u2026fucking\u2026mutilating. The rest of the album is pretty clear and rich in quality, but this one noise pesters me like never before \u2013 if I had a weakness, this would be it. Frankly the only good riff is in the title track, \u201cForbidden Spaces;\u201d it\u2019s a doom-inspired track, which is saying a lot compared to the other ones. Second to this is the tenth track, which is a reclusive, somber, haunting instrumental with use of strictly synths. It\u2019s magical and really excels above the other tracks with its brooding atmosphere and missing high-pitched frequency noise. It\u2019s the only one of Damnation\u2019s tracks that makes me feel like I\u2019m in that forest on the cover, which looks mystically creepy anyway.\n",
        "\nIt\u2019s odd that Grom happens to be the most overlooked album, since I always thought nobody gave two shits about Pandemonic Incantations. Behemoth set their place in the black metal scene a little later than most bands, but their impact was much stronger than anyone anticipated. I personally can trace likeable material from the very second demo, which is a huge plus since I don\u2019t even listen to demos. Looking at the album art I already knew something was different \u2013 something\u2026 odd. I had this hunch that this wasn\u2019t going to be another Sventevith, which may seem great since we want variety, but by the time I was halfway through the album I knew it wasn\u2019t such a spectacular follow-up.\n\nMost elements are retained from previous works, such as the gnarly leadwork, thrash-influenced drumming, and Nergal\u2019s now raspy screams. Otherwise, production is much more \u201cclear\u201d and all the instruments are properly balanced in volume. Bass can be heard as a subtle rumble under everything, and it really sounds weird hearing it separately from the rest. I\u2019d still compare this album a lot to Immortal\u2019s Pure Holocaust since at the core this album sounds just like that one. Experimentation is present such as the use of more acoustic / folk sections, female vocals, and the overall tone of the album.\n\nGuitar riffs and leads are pretty distorted and usually tremolo, but not that bad or thin compared to the previous recordings. They\u2019re rough, aggressive, and atmospheric while the acoustics really give a more epic sound. Hearing them not only makes me feel relaxed and rejuvenated, but also spices things up for the songs themselves. They\u2019re more interesting and suck you in moreso than most of the ones on Sventevith. Synth interludes / acoustics are top-notch, obscure sounding, and add even more to the supernatural / occult tone that has followed the band since the very beginning. \n\nWhat I\u2019m not fond of much are the female vocals, which do make me think of some witch in the forest, but really come off as the worst part of the album. Whenever I hear them I can\u2019t help but be turned off by their off-key, out of place nature. Not only that, but the bitch also gets Nergal to try out some baroque sounding clean vocals, which suck even harder and detract from the true atmosphere. This album is supposed to sound haunting, mystic, and pagan, yet these two vocal inclusions don\u2019t cut it for me.\n\nWhat I am fond of is the drumming, once again; years of progression have turned Ravenlock into a pure beast on the kit. Double bass is excessive not in blast beats, but like a stampede with a spear and shield down a hill like on the cover art. The tom / snare patterns are catchy and timed in the main rhythm that they add more melody with their beats than before. In fact, you\u2019ll be headbanging in sync more to the rapid-fire drumming than the riffs themselves.\n\nObviously this album is a step-down from the debut in some areas while it evolves in others. Even though drumming has greatly improved, it\u2019ll be the last we ever hear of Ravenlock, since the demon Inferno would be recruited right after this. I forgot to mention that Nergal actually has a little bit of a growl in his screams here, so you know damn well that this is the base starting point in his vocal change. Production is much better than the previous two in clarity, but atmospheric wise you\u2019ll get more out of the debut and previous EP. This album isn\u2019t bad, but I find that I got less out of it in the end than the other ones and even the later ones \u2013 we\u2019ll get there, eventually.\n",

This EP somehow stands out to me as the definitive moment of Behemoth\u2019s black metal days \u2013 that\u2019s saying a lot considering what it has to compete with. You\u2019d do yourself a huge favor by checking this recording out, and only a fool to pass it up.\n",
        "\nQuick notes \u2013 At the time of writing this review, a statement on this album page exclaims that \u201cTracks 1-9 originally recorded 1993 for the \u201cSventevith\u201d demo.\u201d\n\n\u2026you must be kidding me\u2026\n\nYeah, those demos were quite something, but here\u2019s where we really see Behemoth in their black metal glory. Sure, there later materials have a real kick to them, but you can\u2019t replace the atmosphere and allure of these early albums. This particularly one sounds the most occult and I\u2019ve often associated a kind of supernatural tone with this album and also with their sophomore, Grom.There are lots of choir and synth effects in the background of most songs on here, but the biggest difference compared to their last demo is the fact that the production is\u2026 get this\u2026 worse. It\u2019s not utterly destroyed, but you\u2019ll notice this scrape of white noise also in the very back of every song \u2013 it\u2019s like a never-ending fuzz and it really is annoying at first. No doubt by the third track that frequency of noise will be so embedded in your head it\u2019ll just blend in. \n\nThe rest of the instruments are colder and thinner than \u2026From The Pagan Vastlands, but think Gorgoroth\u2019s Pentagram at a slightly lower volume and we\u2019re on the same level of understanding. Guitars are more folk / thrash inspired this time around, but not so hateful as you\u2019d expect. They have a melodic touch that isn\u2019t so obvious, yet they\u2019re more energetic and frantic than before. Bass is harder since the production literally drowns it under so much noise, but I highly doubt it\u2019d do anything more than just follow the rhythm. Even on the last track (which doesn\u2019t have the production qualities of the previous nine) it is near impossible to hear any bass.\n\nI\u2019d kill to be the drummer on this album, since whoever Ravenlock had complete liberty to mess up the drum kit as he saw fit. This guy has a thrash style of drumming that\u2019s like an unstoppable charge \u2013 can\u2019t stop once he starts. Blast beats are more prominent than before, but the double bass isn\u2019t so noticeable. Even the toms, snares, and cymbals sound like they\u2019re far away \u2013 oddly enough, this fits the production scheme well though and sounds as if they were out in the chilly open. The songs themselves are beginning to become more memorable, so Behemoth looks to be focusing on all fronts this time around.\n\nI\u2019d now like to give a special mention to the ninth track, \u201cHell Dwells In Ice,\u201d for being the track that no one ever mentions, even Behemoth (not even half the reviewers for this bring it up). Out of all their obscure black metal recordings and the brutality of their death metal material, would you ever guess the band attempted a gothic/atmospheric rock track? No joke, the somber atmosphere on this song is amazing behind the clean guitar passage and the nostalgically depressing keyboard tune. Nergal speaks in a baroque tone, which is a complete departure from the tormented shrieks he pulls off on the rest of the album. Those vocals are so icy and hateful, but on this one song its so enchanting, magical, and somewhat out of place that it literally is the best part of the album.\n\nWhat\u2019s always interested me on the outside was the spine-chilling cover art. I can\u2019t help but feel as if I was stranded along the Polish coastline, wandered into some wooded area, and had to bear witness to this bizarre ritual above some whirlpool / quarry. It unnerves me to look at it considering how cryptic it must seem, but the music therein does enough justice. \n\nDo you want to check out early Behemoth now? Has this review sparked your interest enough to venture away from the death metal area for a little stroll in the black metal sector? If so, then my job ends and your journey begins \u2013 go forth!\n",
        "\nNow we\u2019re talking demo quality \u2013 this album I\u2019d say is good enough to be its own full-length. It has character, pride, energy, and a folk vibe that I feel they were wrong to lose. While the last demo ensured a sound they could stick by, this demo really got the band comfortable with their abilities.\n\nNergal himself has improved the most \u2013 from Bolt Thrower-inspired death growls to Immortal-inspired growls to more natural sounding screams that aren\u2019t mutilated, but very suitable and tortured. I get this sort of Burzum itch from them, but they aren\u2019t as out-of-control or annoying as Varg\u2019s. He screams at more suitable times than before, which is something we\u2019ve expected from the beginning but quite the change when you\u2019re tracing Behemoth from the bottom up like me with these reviews.\n\nWith tame vocals we are introduced to more tame riffs that create a rhythm and attempt to be melodic, atmospheric, and evil. There you go Behemoth, your baby steps are coming to an end. Soon you\u2019ll be walking on your own like a real boy! The usual speed of the songs are mid-paced and sometimes slightly fast, with the riffs themselves being a tremolo or either some kind of\u2026 melodic death? Sure, why not? They\u2019re slightly thrashy, too, like the drumming, and actually remind me of Eternal Tears Of Sorrow and their early thrash days. Bass is a little harder to trace, so I won\u2019t go much further except telling you that its there \u2013 it exists, but its incredibly hard to hear over the drums, which again sound louder than the rest (though this time not by much). You sometimes get to hear it louder than the rest like on \u201cFields Of Haar-Meggido\u201d \u2013 I don\u2019t get it, they\u2019re as loud as Bob Daisley\u2019s bass lines in that song!\n\nIn the drum department, its like a tale of rags to riches. Endless Damnation saw drumming so poor that you could put me on the kit, record it, and not hear any difference \u2013 and I don\u2019t even know how to play drums properly! The double bass isn\u2019t as thick, and thankfully we aren\u2019t bombarded by blast beats like on the later records. Instead, the drumming is more thrash influenced, which is neat since the toms sound organic and juicy as tomatoes while the cymbals aren\u2019t annoying as before. The style of playing isn\u2019t too impulsive, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily follow the rhythm like the rest. It\u2019s a fresh mix-up of catchy beating and contradicting timing that you just need to hear to enjoy.\n\nWhile the songs themselves are an even bigger improvement than before, I still have a hard time remember which is which and what they even sounded like. For another demo the production is even better than their debut full-length, which is a shame \u2013 honestly, beaten by your own demo on production. Songwriting skills have improved vastly and would continue to progress and evolve, so things are looking up quite fast.\n",
        "\nWow, if this was recorded at the exact same time as that other travesty known as Endless Damnation, then the joke\u2019s on me. I thought these guys had no skills at the time, but this demo really proved me wrong. It isn\u2019t anything completely standout like the famous Lunar Poetry album by Nokturnal Mortum \u2013 the one that obliterates almost every one of their full-lengths. \n\nIt\u2019s clear that these guys play black metal, but the production is miles better than the first demo and although the growls are more akin to the genre, the double bass is thicker than all hell. First time hearing them I thought it was the production, but no, every time we here the double bass kick, its going to be the thickest thumping you\u2019ll ever hear. It makes the thumping on Gorgoroth\u2019s \u201cRevelation Of Doom\u201d look like Mormons at the door. It\u2019s muddy and deep, but you\u2019ll hear it over the bass no problem. The cymbals also seem to be louder than everything else, which gets annoying since the toms and snare are drowned under what sounds like the bass\u2026 bass? Yeah actually, the bass can be heard \u2013 it isn\u2019t outright noticeable, but you\u2019ll definitely hear it trotting along with a bellowing, sludgy tone.\n\nComplimenting this are the spacey, supernatural sounding riffs really steal the show away once you overcome the shock of how much the production excels over the previous recording. Not only do they hold these traits, but you can actually follow a rhythm - believe me, after hearing that last travesty, you\u2019ll envy hearing a rhythm again. I\u2019ve heard thinner riffs like on Gorgoroth\u2019s Pentagram, but that\u2019s mainly do to the ice cold production. While this one is an evil sounding release, it isn\u2019t a cold, hateful one. Nergal most of all has a sort of lazy Abbath scream from early-Immortal going \u2013 I just noticed it now, this album reminds me of Immortal\u2019s Pure Holocaust the most. Only difference is that the production isn\u2019t as clear, the songs aren\u2019t as memorable, and this one still is sloppier.\n\nKeyboard-wise, Darken doesn\u2019t improve conditions much; no doubt you\u2019ll definitely be put in the right mindset and atmosphere. However, the keyboard songs are so creepy that they\u2019re a stark difference compared to the regular tracks. No joke, those keyboard tunes actually give me chills \u2013 if I heard them at night, I\u2019d no doubt go to bed uneasy.\n\nI\u2019d wholeheartedly recommend you hear this demo and forget Endless Damnation even exists. That demo is a tarnishes Behemoth so badly, but it might be a necessary listen in order to appreciate this demo even more.\n",
        "\nOf all things raw, this takes the cake. Well, Mayhem\u2019s Pure Fucking Mayhem may be the true winner, but this demo is pretty damn rusty. No doubt it\u2019s obscure, dark, unpolished, unrehearsed, and ultimately uneventful. The production is so sloppy and screechy that even if there were any despicable riffs to be found, they sure don\u2019t sound like it.\n\nNergal was around fifteen when this was recorded while his band mates weren\u2019t much older. No doubt their skills also aren\u2019t up to par, which is odd because only a couple years later they would improve so dramatically I\u2019m actually quite amazed they were this bad at one point. Sure, everyone has a starting point, but to think that they actually released this atrocious recording is a testament to idea of patience.\n\nThe intro and outro are what I\u2019d call false advertising \u2013 they suck you into this obscure, 2nd world mood with its funeral organ vibe, thin production (although the outro seems to be having more enhanced production qualities), and eerie aura of notes. Based on those alone, you\u2019d expect the album to be an atmospheric slab of charming black metal. However, you\u2019re immediately greeted with a ruckus of pure cacophony. Literally, I wouldn\u2019t even call the next track \u201cplaying.\u201d Timing is completely off, riffs are chords hit one at a time, and if bass was played on this album I feel bad because it was a waste of time.\n\nSurprisingly, the vocals actually are the only thing worth really praising. They\u2019re death vocals much like early Bolt Thrower (specifically the debut album). Yeah, its hard to call this music even black metal the way the production makes it out to be. With those beastly-yet shrouded growls I\u2019d call this a messy attempt at death metal \u2013 even doom metal if you want to be picky about speed; yeah, tempo is all jacked up.\n\nHearing this, I can\u2019t help but think of the Conan movies \u2013 you know, those Schwarzenegger films that didn\u2019t lick total balls? The drums have this nomadic tone to them where the cymbals and toms echo in the distance and the riffs grind along like buzzing fire. Some of these moments are broken up by \u201csolos\u201d \u2013 yeah I\u2019d like to quote / unquote that because it\u2019s really just playing at a higher pitch rather than actually attempting a solo.\n",
        "\nI don't usually care much for EPs and usually buy them only if I'm really into the band in question releasing them. In this case this is very much so and I am not disappointed in it at all. Behemoth, as usual, bring the goods in their own inimitable style on this EP, and it makes a good stop gap effort until the release of \"Evangelion\" this summer. OK, I know, this came out last year, but still.\n\nWe start off with a re-recorded version of my absolute favorite Behemoth tune, the majestic \"Chant for Eschaton 2000 EV\", and it benefits from better production, a better vocal performance, and improved musicianship. Inferno is up to his usual godly standard on this and thoughout the EP as well, with his far more aggressive performance elevating this even higher in my esteem. Played on seven-string guitars it sounds even more evil to my ears. Followed by the one really new track on here, \"Quadosh\", this really shows Inferno at his best on here, whizzing through numerous tempo changes effortlessly ranging from slow and deliberate to his usual light speed blasting, and the intro even reminds me of Slayer's \"South of Heaven\", a very good thing to me. You can even hear Orion's bass near the end as it rears its head in the slow riffing. While it does seem a bit thrown together in spots, it still slays all in its path with eager bloodlust.\n\nThe cover tunes are actually rather cool, in my opinion. They chose atypical bands to cover--the little known Czech export, Master's Hammer, and the Ramones. Yeah, I know, the Ramones, but since when have you ever heard a death metal band cover them? Behemoth tears a new one in \"I'm Not Jesus\" and it sounds totally unlike the original to say the least. I've never had the pleasure of hearing the original version of \"Jama Pekel\", but I imagine they do it justice, and coaxing Root vocalist Big Boss into delivering the song (it is in his native language, after all) in an evil black metal rasp instead of his usual operatic style really works. His evil laughter adds an extra level of intensity, and this is powerful stuff. Gotta find the original now...\n\nThe live tracks are delivered well, but still cannot match the flat out blitzkrieg that is the Behemoth death machine in the live context. Having seen the boys live many a time now, I could imagine their trademark furious windmilling and Nergal's intense expressions as he delivered his vocals, but still...it's not the same. I'd really rather go see them live again, which will hopefully happen sooner than later. \n\nOverall, this is worth getting for the studio tracks above all. I really don't go for live albums/tracks, hence the little time devoted to them in this review, and hence the less than 100% rating. Otherwise, it is still a worthy purchase, so give it a shot. Behemoth deserve your and my hard-earned cash for putting as much work into their craft as they do, so let's keep 'em rolling, shall we?\n",
        "\nWow, Behemoth have really outdone themselves with this one. This is their most evil release without coming off as horrendously cheesy or overly brutal for no reason. Don't get me wrong, I love Zos Kia Cultas and Satanica, but their earlier shit is not too much different from other straight up 90's black metal while Demigod and The Apostasy are so overly and pointlessly brutal that it ceases to even be music anymore. Thelma.6 is their middle ground where they mix both black metal and death metal perfectly and actually succeed at portraying a consistently terrifyingly Satanic atmosphere throughout.\n\nThis is where Nergal's guitar work (as well as Havoc's) is at it's most technical and complex. Te best part about it is that it never loses direction or gets lost in technicality, it simply flows beautifully (if you would consider anything Behemoth does \"beautiful\"). Thelma.6 is also the album where Nergal's vocals are at their most varied range. He mixes death metal growls and black metal high pitch screeches and shouts very respectably. Yes, he over layers them, but he doesn't go bat shit crazy with it like he does on Demigod.\n\nInferno (yes, he goes by the name Inferno) is almost as unpredictable and out of control as Flo Mounier from his None So Vile days. There is just no telling what this man will do next. The funny thing is, although extremely unpredictable, his drumming never seems to come off as random or unorganized. It actually scares the shit out of me how insane he really is at his instrument.\n\nThe lyrics, as expected, are evil as fucking hell. All I have to say is that I highly doubt these guys attend Church every Sunday morning. Yeah, sometimes it comes off as a little cheesy if your not used to death metal lyrics, but they actually are pretty intense lyrics for the genre. If you want the best of Behemoth, get this record and you will not regret it. You'll get the best of Behemoth's death metal and their black metal era in one album, which means you'll get some of the best mix of death and black metal ever recorded.\n",
        "\nThe gods of musical self-reinvention Behemoth have returned after about 3 years of slumbering in the Polish death metal catacombs and have again graced us with their blessings of brutality and darkness. \u201cThe Apostasy\u201d sees the band moving further away from their black metal roots and into a basic form of modern death metal. It differs from most other bands in the latter style only in terms of tonality, as the dissonant yet still largely tonal blending of Middle Eastern sounds and common practice chromatic chord relations that the band uses bear little similarity to either brutal or melodic death metal. In basically every other area, from Nergal\u2019s barks to the fairly formulaic drumming of Inferno, each of these songs just come off as a more epic answer to recent Polish death bands such as Vader and Dies Irae, whom the band has had some connections with in more recent times.\n\nAlthough the band has been out of the pure black metal realm for a good few years, this album marks the biggest deviation from their older selves, as it is the most structured and restrained of any of their offerings. Granted, the Behemoth version of restrained is still pretty intense, as the drums are still blurring like the tail of a comet, the riffs and base work on here meld together to create a thunderous low end stomp character that typifies the concept of heaviness, and there are plenty of impressive lead guitar slots to keep your standard Slayer loving old school metal fan satisfied. But compared to previous releases, most notably the equally modern sounding yet much wilder \u201cDemigod\u201d, this is structured in a manner that is mildly comparable to a modern variant on death/thrash.\n\nThe lyrics draw upon a mixture of pagan mysticism, Luciferian writings, historical events and even numerology to set the subjects upon which this heavily programmatic album is based. Nergal definitely takes a strong interest in all of these subjects as he includes an explanation of where he got the influence for each song. The most interesting of these is his tying of the Assyrian and/or Babylonian demon \u201cPazuzu\u201d in with Seth and the Hindu goddess Kali, which results in a rather interesting set of lyrical references to all 3 over the top of a set of grim musical sections that bear the most resemblance to their black metal roots of all the songs on here. Take away the hyper speed drumming and what you have isn\u2019t all that far removed from an Eastern dance song with an odd sensation of coldness.\n\nIf you went by songs such as the aforementioned \u201cPazuzu\u201d, or others of a similarly extreme persuasion such as \u201cPrometherion\u201d and \u201cKriegsphilosophie\u201d, you\u2019d quickly assume that there\u2019s not any restraint to be found on here. But largely the rest of the songs on here are pretty tame and melodic in character. \u201cAt The Left Hand Ov God\u201d definitely has a doom-like character to it, as aside from the drums the music tends to progress slowly and serve the lyrical content. \u201cLibertheme\u201d and \u201cInner Sanctum\u201d definitely go for more of a groovy and atmospheric affect, and are pretty easy to follow, the latter of the two actually utilizes clean vocals part of the time. The standout amongst the slower and more formulaic songs is \u201cBe Without Fear\u201d, which edges pretty heavily towards a death/thrash sound, with riffing that sounds fairly similar to a couple of songs heard on Iced Earth\u2019s \u201cBurnt Offerings\u201d actually.\n\nAs a whole this is a very easy album to enjoy, but not really something that upstages the bulk of Behemoth\u2019s back catalog. People who like big sounding epic themes and really polished production work will probably go for this, but if you\u2019re looking for an album that shoots for intensity above all other things, \u201cDemigod\u201d is a more logical choice. But this is still a worthy album for the band and has some classic songs with real staying power, and definitely a cut above a lot of what is passing for death metal in recent years.\n\nOriginally submitted to (www.metal-observer.com) on April 21, 2009.\n",
        "\nWhen discussing Behemoth's black metal era, this demo tape, which was recorded and released in 1992 after being recorded in Adam's music teacher's studio, is never discussed.\n\nSome say that the production is unsettling, well that's because this was probably recorded live into one track (which is what it sounds like). I say, this demo is perfect for what it is, A 14 year old metal head's attempt at being as evil and heavy as Beherit.\n\nWhat came out was pretty damn close to what he was going for. Most of the songs here (minus the first two) are pure doomy black masterpieces. The vocals, albeit overloud and overbearing, are extremely powerful and evil for such a young feller. The instrumentation is exactly what's expected, raw and unpolished. I mean, it was a Slavic black metal release by pre-teens and produced without production. \n\nFor what it is though, the music isn't quite up to snuff as the weirdness of the following two demos and albums, but it was a pretty damne vil and dark experience. \n\nRecommended to fans of Beherit and those who don't give two shits about production quality.\n",
        "\nSometimes in life, you just come across something that blows your mind. The first time you saw a 3D movie, for instance. Or a flaming vodka. But there are few things that blow your mind in quite the same way or on quite the same level as Behemoth's \"The Apostasy\" does.\n\n\"Demigod\", Behemoth's last album, blew most people's minds when they heard it - it repositioned Behemoth at the forefront of modern death metal. Behemoth new they had to pull out all the stops to make the follow up even more brutal, even more chaotic and even more savage. The danger while making \"The Apostasy\" was to let Behemoth descend into the bowls of endless, generic brutal death metal bands and essentially backfire. But I'm very glad to report that it hasn't backfired in the slightest.\n\nWhat \"The Apostasy\" does is take the classic Behemoth formula of chaotic, thick, detuned guitar riffs, violent drumming and the iconic growls of Nergal, and intensifies it to create an absolutely brutal and visceral onslaught of Satanism. Seth and Nergal's guitarwork is as tight as it should be, with razor sharp, articulate riffs that give each track its own character and leave you stunned every time \u2013 highlights include \u201cChristgrinding Avenue\u201d and \u201cLibertheme\u201d. The solos are filled with unpredictability and near flawless execution, sprinkled with a hint of whammy for that extra touch.\n\nAs always, Inferno\u2019s assault on the drums continues, although as I understand it, a lot of the drums are triggered, so we can\u2019t see his true, unedited, raw talent, which is a shame. This is probably my only criticism with the album \u2013 to gain an even more insane level of chaos, Behemoth adopted triggered drums, which is quite obviously fake, tainting the experience a little.\n\nNergal\u2019s violent, ugly, primeval, growls rage on in \u201cThe Apostasy\u201d, and it sounds better than ever. Notable excerpts include the doubling up of two, overlapping vocal lines in \u201cAt the Left Hand ov God\u201d, which seem to answer back to each other. He also uses this same method to add in extra raspy screeches to contrast his thick, meaty grunts. \n\nThe lyrics, in a departure from true Behemoth style, feature for more historical and philosophical content - for instance, Kriegsphilosophie features a verse with the lyrics: \u201cWhen heavenly chants mute/Thy apparition did I behold oh Venus/The sweetest ov them all/Let me bathe in Thy divinity descend!/Thou hast descended depart not yet!\u201d \u2013 a massive departure from the usual Satanic and anti-Christian themes of Behemoth\u2019s past. Personally, I find it much better for Behemoth\u2019s style, which started to get a little stale and clich\u00e9d when I heard Demigod last, and allows them to break from the mainstream.\n\nThe songwriting in \u201cThe Apostasy\u201d is top-notch, as always with Behemoth \u2013 track after track of catchy, melodic, articulate riffs, topped off with the brilliant vocals and a new addition \u2013 pianos and French horns, for a suitably majestic, epic feel and atmosphere. The album has a brilliant flow to it, starting with \u201cRome 64 C.E\u201d, an instrumental that gears you straight into the mood for the follower, \u201cSlaying the Prophets ov Isa\u201d, a cracking opener that blasts off at more than 230 BPM and never lets up. Occasionally we here little acoustic interludes to break up the action, but everything seems to mesh together extremely well to create an album that\u2019s brilliant to listen to both as single songs and as a whole album experience. Songs remain fast, violent, exciting and never bore \u2013 no complaints from me.\n\n\u201cThe Apostasy\u201d is a landmark achievement for Behemoth \u2013 it represents their peak of creating the finest and most refined brutal, chaotic, mindbending death metal of today. It\u2019s not perfect, but it comes damn near it.\n",
        "\nThere\u2019s a lot of people who simply don\u2019t like EPs, mainly due to the fact that they don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re getting a lot for their money. With seven songs at 27 minutes, there\u2019s certainly a lot of bang for ones buck, especially for those people who simply can\u2019t wait for a new Behemoth release.\n\nFor those of you who aren\u2019t that familiar with Behemoth, they\u2019re a Polish export specializing in an evolution from raw black metal into the black/death band they are today. The evolutionary steps can be tough on certain bands, as when a band is known for making a different album every time, they\u2019re expected to continue evolving, which I think Behemoth stopped doing on their latest album, \u201cThe Apostasy\u201d. The first four songs, \u201cChant for Ezkaton 2000 EV\u201d (a re-recording of an older Behemoth song), \u201cQadosh\u201d (a brand new song), \u201cJama Pekel\u201d (a cover originally by Master\u2019s Hammer) and \u201cI\u2019m not Jesus\u201d (a cover by The Ramones) all seem like they\u2019re newly recorded for the EP, with the final three songs on this EP being live.\n\nPerhaps they were going for an older black metal sound, but the guitars are on the treble side, and difficult to hear under the insanely fast drums, although for some strange reasons, the toms sound as though they\u2019re leather. At this point Behemoth is doing things in their typical style, with Infernos style of drumming (change-ups in blasting) and Nergal doing the signature harmonized high and low screams. The game it feels old hat though, and the cover songs aren\u2019t adding anything, nor are they recorded great. The actual stand outs are the live songs, which can easily be heard, and allow the power to come off in a live environment (although capturing the audience reaction was difficult, as it\u2019s usually said to be).\n\nFrom a quantity standpoint, you\u2019re getting a lot of bang for your buck, but on the other hand, you\u2019re only getting one new song and two covers, and the rest may have already heard.\n\nOriginally posted at www.waytooloud.com\n",
        "\nAh, Behemoth. One of the most prolific and, in my opinion, greatest of all modern metal bands. Not commercial, not compromising, and not weak - quite the opposite in every respect of those three things. But the reason why they are so great is because of the style of metal they play. They used to be an underground folk influenced black metal band with nothing whatsoever to do with death metal. Then they started moving more towards death metal with their Bewitching the Pomerania EP and then slightly more so on their third full length album Pandemonic Incantations. Even so this was a messy period where the band clearly hadn't quite found their niche yet. They were experimenting a lot with their sound, and thus Pandemonic Incantations was a bit of a disappointment - different from their earlier black metal albums certainly, but not unique or great enough to really mean that much.\n\nThat all changed in 1999 when this album was released. Satanica.\n\nThis was the first true blackened death metal album in a lot of ways. While that may not be an entirely accurate statement with regards to the entire black and death metal underground throughout the world, this album was clearly one of the first and best examples of death metal with black metal influences done well without seeming contrived, overly experimental, or silly, and certainly the most prominent one.\n\nSatanica has all of the key elements in place that make modern day Behemoth the great and mighty crushing metal machine it is to this day: crushingly heavy guitarwork, pounding drumming, excellent technicality, interesting melodies, and Nergal's unique vocals. This album is completely different from anything that came before it: it's more intense, more violent, more brutal, and certainly more unique. It really stands out to the point where from Nergal's unique and brutal vocal approach to the specific style of the guitar playing and drumming you can quickly tell it is Behemoth. No other band really has quite this sound. The earlier albums, while good in their own way, were basically just black metal albums with a little bit of keyboards and some folk influences. Good at times but not uniquely special. And the transition EP and album were disappointing to say the least. This album is really where everything came together to create one great force of music, a mighty metal machine of amazing power and vitality that is now one of the greatest metal bands in the world.\n\nUnfortunately, it isn't perfect. Of course no album is really, but the truth of the matter is that despite this album's excellence, it doesn't quite measure up to the awesomeness of Zos Kia Cultus and Demigod. Those two albums are in a class of their own anyway, but one can't help feeling just a little disappointed that there isn't more of that true anger, brutality, and epicness that those albums wield in this one. There certainly is some of it; the fourth and seventh songs in particular are good examples of this kind of thing - but overall this album isn't as great as what followed a couple of years later. It's still excellent though, just not as excellent.\n\nIn terms of overall quality, the songs range from average to good to fantastic. The second and sixth songs fit into the first category, the third, fifth, and eighth fit into the second category, and the first, fourth, and seventh fit into the third category. Thus the album doesn't maintain the consistently brilliant quality throughout like Zos Kis Cultus and Demigod do. However, the average songs are still decent, the good songs are more than worth listening to and the fantastic songs are definitely essential listening if you are a Behemoth fan. Decade of Therion is a fantastic opener, crushing and brutal yet somewhat melodic. Not anywhere near as angry or as vicious as the stuff on their next few albums but still heavy as fuck. Of Sephirotic Transformation and Carnality is brilliant, combining catchy but angry and vicious melodies with great vocals throughout. The Alchemist's Dream is incredible, beginning with some weird sounds then following with some of the most awesome riffs Behemoth ever wrote, and as usual great vocals from Nergal. The most interesting part of this song is the middle section, which has no vocals and is all drum and guitarwork, very heavy but with some very interesting melodies and quite different from the beginning of the song. The uniqueness of that entire song is what makes it so great.\n\nAs for the good songs, Ceremony of Shiva is good, with some strange but surprisingly not particularly eastern melodies despite the title and the lyrics, which are all about some strange eastern ritual, and this also seems a bit odd considering the intensity of this song. Even so it works fine for the most part. The Sermon to the Hypocrites is pretty good too, a lot slower but still good. Chant for Eschaton 2000 is weird and mostly mid paced, kind of experimental sounding, but again good.\n\nFinally, the average songs are a little disappointing. LAM is simply too fast, which after Decade of Therion feels a little repetitive. It also has some weird stop start moments which are a little annoying at times. Starspawn has the potential to be a good song but is simply rather forgettable.\n\nThe album is also fairly short compared to Behemoth's other later blackened death metal albums; at only 35 minutes, it's over pretty quickly if you listen to it in one go. Even so this isn't a bad thing, as short but intense is often good, it's just a little disappointing considering that all of the later Behemoth albums are 40 minutes or longer.\n\nBesides the great guitarwork and drumming, this album's other strengths are that it has enough variety with the eight different songs to keep it interesting, with every song having a fairly different sound(which is definitely a good thing), and Nergal's brilliant vocals. Like on the later albums, his vocal approach is in between death growling and black metal shrieking; the best way to describe it would be a brutal shout, or a vicious howl. It's neither very high nor very low, but overall it is actually closer to a death growl than a black metal shriek, although not entirely. Either way, like the unique guitar sound and drum sound, Nergal's vocals stand out as much on this album as they do on every other one of Behemoth's later albums.\n\nIn terms of melodies, this album hardly employs any of the eastern and/or flamenco melodies that would become commonplace in nearly every Behemoth song starting with their Zos Kia Cultus album three years after this album was released. The only eastern stuff that is really obvious is in Ceremony of Shiva, and even this isn't very eastern sounding compared to some of the songs on Zos Kia Cultus, Demigod or The Apostasy, and even less so than some of the songs on Thelema 6 too.\n\nLyrically, the album is kind of bizarre, showing a mixture of occult obsessions, black magic rituals, hatred against Christianity(obviously), and some eastern stuff, most notably again on Ceremony of Shiva. It's different from the lyrical themes of some of their following albums but still interesting.\n\nOverall, this album is excellent: it's well paced, brutal, complex, interesting, and filled with all of current day Behemoth's trademarks, from Nergal's sudden vicious screams/roars/howls that appear out of nowhere, to the sounds of the instruments that is unique to Behemoth. Any Behemoth fan should already have this album. If you don't, and you like Behemoth, I suggest you get it immediately. While it isn't the brutal monster that is Zos Kia Cultus, or the crushing blast beast that is Demigod, it's still a great album and it's where Behemoth defined their style. They would refine it further with Thelema 6, and then even more so with Zos Kia Cultus, but it is still a great start.\n",
        "\nWho would\u2019ve thought it, the band that nowadays produces flat sounding Nile worship (AKA The Apostasy) made an album of black metal perfection at the start of their careers. Okay, so it\u2019s pretty common knowledge that Behemoth changed styles (some say sold out, I maintain that they \u201csold out\u201d on The Apostasy) from black metal to their current death metal stylings, but it doesn\u2019t make this album any less amazingly different to their current material.\n\nIn all honesty, \u201cSventevith (Storming near the Baltic)\u201d was one of the very first black metal albums I ever heard, courtesy of Metal Mind\u2019s excellent \u201cHistorica\u201d box set. It\u2019d be stupid to say it didn\u2019t profoundly affect my taste in black metal, indeed, hearing this album opened up many, many more albums to me through its raw production and beautiful melodies. It may come as a surprise then when I say that I don\u2019t particularly like the demos that preceded this album, despite the fact that they share a couple of similar songs. That\u2019s less to do with the demos and more to do with this album\u2019s amazing use of keyboards and acoustic guitars, not just in interludes, these elements are intertwined throughout every song on the album to amazing effect and make up much of this album\u2019s uniqueness and character.\n\nFar from Nergal\u2019s current Steve Tucker love roars (listen to Morbid Angel\u2019s Gateways to Annihilation and you\u2019ll see what I mean), the vocals on this album consist of shrill shrieks, equally as thin as the production. Perhaps it\u2019s less Behemoth\u2019s change in style that\u2019s shocking, but Nergal\u2019s vocal changes because if you didn\u2019t know that it was Nergal at the microphone of both eras of Behemoth, you wouldn\u2019t think for one second that it was the same Pole there. The vocals however are fantastic here, they complement the rest of the album (as I said, the vocals equal the album\u2019s thin, raw sound) perfectly, never once getting in the way of the instrumental beauty on display yet maintaining a sense of purpose throughout the album, the vocals are just as important as any instrument here, but never higher in the \u201cSventevith\u201d Sound Hierarchy.\n\nPerhaps the greatest thing about \u201cSventevith\u201d aside from the keyboards and acoustic guitars is the way the electric guitar(s) sound. At times there\u2019s a significant degree of difficulty in determining what the guitars are actually playing due to the extremely thin sound and accompanying \u201cnoise,\u201d similar to the guitar noise on Emperor\u2019s \u201cIn the Nightside Eclipse.\u201d This is one of those things though that, uniquely in black metal, creates a stronger atmosphere than any amount of keyboards could ever do and just like \u201cIn the Nightside Eclipse,\u201d the combination of keyboards, production, acoustic guitars and of course excellent song writing lend \u201cSventevith\u201d the most amount of atmosphere I\u2019ve ever heard in not just a black metal album, but any album of all time. The atmosphere by the way is one of gnarled trees in a misty forest, perhaps the quintessential black metal aesthetic.\n\nSongs like \u201cFrom the Pagan Vastlands\u201d and \u201cHidden in the Fog\u201d sound better than their previous demo versions and much, much better than the currently abortion worthy death metal charade versions currently played by the band, testament to the excellence and atmosphere of this album. These songs, and the rest of the album for that matter, were truly written for this album, to appear in these exact forms of black metal perfection. Every single second of every single song sounds amazing to the point where this album is sacred to me. I don\u2019t want to hear other versions of these songs because they\u2019ll never rival that which appears on this album. In my mind, every other Behemoth recording of the \u201cSventevith\u201d songs, no matter how good they are (and to be fair, there are some excellent versions of these songs out there, namely the version of \u201cHidden in the Fog\u201d on the \u201cBewitching the Pomerania\u201d EP), they will never hold a torch to this album, it\u2019s simply that damn good.\n\nNever once does the album let up musically, nor lyrically (and for that matter, visually as well, the cover is great). The lyrics on \u201cSventevith\u201d set the standard for all \u201cpagan black metal\u201d albums to follow with the mysterious, haunting and ultimately excellent lyrics. Even the occasional spurt of Engrish doesn\u2019t detract from lyrics that do nothing but add to the already brilliant atmosphere. Take \u201cThe Chant of the Eastern Lands\u201d as an example:\n\n\u201cThis battle is a rebellion, rebirth of old traditions \nMythical hell is the paradise to the true warriors \nThere they attain eternity and sit high on the thrones \nPagan nations became united \nMighty bards received their long awaited silence \nSlavs returned to their villages and woods \nPagan frights of heavenly hell dispelled\u201d\n\nAll the talk of Pagan lands, Slavs, villages and woods fits so perfectly with the music on the album I could almost cry, and that is the trend of all the elements on \u201cSventevith,\u201d one of musical unity and atmospheric wonder. Perhaps newer fans of the band might shun this album because of it\u2019s raw sound and \u201cwimpy\u201d acoustics, because as we all know, the current crop of metal fans appreciate nothing but mindless brutality and only accept \u201cacoustic shit\u201d when it\u2019s randomly placed next to shitty \u201cbrutal/heavy/shit\u201d riffs, because then it\u2019s PROGRESSION. Progression my arse, this album is progression, the subtle incorporation of new elements into a pre-existing mold is what makes Sventevith come together and is why this album is better than the demos that came before it. This album set the precedent for pagan black metal, particularly that which comes from Eastern Europe, it progressed black metal however subtly and the genre is now better for it. This album my friends, is black metal at its peak.\n\nOn a side note: I consider Transylvanian Forest as not part of this album and as more of a bonus track in the way that Manowar\u2019s \u201cDie for Metal\u201d is on the \u201cGods of War\u201d album. It\u2019s an excellent song in its own right, one of Behemoth\u2019s hands down best in fact, but as far as I\u2019m concerned, it doesn\u2019t make up this album. Besides, the version on the (excellent) \u201cAnd the Forests Dream Eternally\u201d is better anyway.\n",
        "\nIt can be hard to believe that Behemoth, one of the most prolific black/death metal bands around today sprung from such humble necropounding black metal beginnings.\n\nIn essence, this sounds like a pretty typical second wave black metal album, complete with Norwegian influences and acoustic and folk attributes. While this may sound positive, which it is, the album also suffers from several weak spots. After a pretty good opening in \"Chant of the Eastern Lands\" (it wasn\u2019t great, wasn\u2019t terrible), the album introduces The Touch of Nya, a rather mediocre and forgettable acoustic segment. The album resumes black metal on the tracks From the Pagan Wastelands and Hidden in the Fog, but again falls into a rut of mediocre and out of place acoustic segments- this time called Ancient. My only guess would be is Behemoth is making some attempt at establishing atmosphere, but fails at doing so. However, the acoustic track Hell Dwells in Ice resurrects the band's attempt at furthering their atmosphere. The track is very moody with Nergal speaking in the background, and is overall a satisfying song. Lastly comes Transylvanian Forest, probably my favorite song off the album, a song that is raw to the core, with punk sounding drums and catchy guitar.\n\nIt is very obvious that this is not the Behemoth of today, who have dropped nearly all attributes found on this album, but have nonetheless gone on to create very powerful albums. Not a necessary buy, but nice to listen to every now and then. If you're a strong black metal advocate, consider buying this.\n",
        "\nBehemoth\u2019s Apostasy, while still enjoyable, was a step down for the band. However, Ezkaton demonstrates that the band can still put out some quality material, even if it is in the form of an EP obviously cobbled together from assorted unreleased and re-recorded tracks. The version of \u201cChant for Ezkaton\u201d on this EP, for example, has quickly become one of my favorite Behemoth songs; simple it may be, but it is nevertheless catchy and well-executed. Originally recorded for Satanica, the song sounds better on this EP with cleaner production and a better vocal performance from Nergal. While that song is clearly the best track on the EP, the rest of the tracks are good enough that this EP is about as worthwhile as an EP can get.\n\nThe first two songs are studio recordings of Behemoth tracks, the second of which, \"Qadosh,\" is exclusive to this EP. The production is every bit as good as Apostasy and they feature the same simple, catchy riffs, aggressive drumming, and unique vocals that metalheads have come to expect from Behemoth\u2019s death metal. Both \u201cChant\u201d and \u201cQadosh\u201d are certainly good enough to be on a Behemoth album, even if \u201cQadosh\u201d feels a bit too long. In fact, I wish that \u201cChant\u201d had been included as a bonus track on Apostasy as it would probably have made the album a bit more varied. In short, the EP kicks off with two catchy, well-produced songs.\n\nNext, Behemoth has included a couple of covers. The production is a bit less polished than on the originals, but they\u2019re still well-mixed. While their Master\u2019s Hammer cover probably doesn\u2019t do the original justice, it\u2019s still pretty good. However, it\u2019s not very essential. The way Behemoth plays it, the track just sounds like some generic, albeit catchy, old-school death metal. Their cover of \u201cI\u2019m Not Jesus\u201d by the Ramones is a real treat, though. It\u2019s thoroughly amusing to hear the classic punk refrain chanted by Nergal in his trademarked hoarse yells. Behemoth does a good job of making both songs their own, but the covers are most memorable for the hilarity of hearing \u201cI\u2019m Not Jesus\u201d played in the style of death metal.\n\nFinally, the EP is finished off with some of Behemoth\u2019s classics played live with surprisingly good production. You can tell it\u2019s live, but only just. Including a live version of \u201cChant\u201d seems redundant, but hearing recordings of \u201cBeyond the Pagan Vastlands\u201d and \u201cDecade Ov Therion\u201d played live is cool, even if the crowd sounds a little less enthusiastic than they should. Both tracks feature some of Behemoth\u2019s most memorable riffs.\n\nOverall, the EP isn\u2019t really for those who aren\u2019t familiar with Behemoth, but Behemoth fans will enjoy having it. The selection of tracks is certainly above-average for an EP, even if it\u2019s not essential. (It's certainly not substantive enough to merit buying the 4-disc deluxe box-set.) You\u2019ll enjoy having it if you get it, but you won\u2019t necessarily miss it if you don\u2019t have it.\n",
        "\nBehemoth strike again with their eighth full-length album, The Apostasy. There's happened some change since their last album Demigod. Though all the death metal ingredients can be found (the brutal pace included) , Behemoth has taken a step towards bit more melodic and modern spheres.\n\nThe first song, Rome 64 C.E., starts off with some church-like clean high-pitched female vocals, which quickly transform into a great riff and some very fast drumming. Great riffs swarm in and out of focus, and the music remains extremely fast-paced throughout the album. There are some acoustic parts as well, sounding a lot like some polish folk music, where Nergal\u2019s polish background becomes more dominant. Inner Sanctum \u2013 with some great additional vocals \u2013 , for example, slows the pace down a little before the raging force of Pazuzu and the uncompromising power of the final song Christgrinding Avenue. Every song has a solid internal continuum, and despite the constant variability, the songs remain perfectly together and whole.\n\nEven though the speed really stands out from the darkened soundscape, the complex and melodic guitar riffs form the main frame of Behemoth\u2019s music. The melodies are creative and versatile: not at all as dark, as the soundscape as a whole, but almost clear; and so very beautiful. At times Behemoth\u2019s music style seems to represent melodic, rather than traditional death metal (definitely not blackened death metal, as may have been on their earlier releases). The guitarist-vocalist Nergal\u2019s and the additional guitarist Seth\u2019s leads, decisively sprinkled all over the album, are fast and full of hatred, bringing in the last ingredient and completing the picture.\n\nAs said before, the drumming on the album is extremely fast. Different variable drum beats just keep coming -- in a pace much faster than could reasonably be supposed possible for a pair of hands and feet to muster. One might think this would drown other insteuments underneath. Not so. The drums do have a very dominant role on the album, but they somehow just fill the seams of the guitars, rather than control the whole music. The drums create anger, but also diversity to the soundscape, bringing out more dimensions and aspects, than the guitars can alone array.\n\nThe vocals, on the other hand, create most of the darkness and rawness of the soundscape. Nergal\u2019s low harsh growls are saturated with wrath and infested with hatred. Nothing very different from other death metal vocalists, but there's no need for any extraordinaryties here. The lyrical content consists of misanthropical views and the lack of free will among men. People, religious people mostly, are seen as slaves of society and church. There is also a short introduction to each song written by Nergal, concerning the lyrical theme of the song, or the circumstances under which the song in question was born.\n\nOverall, The Apostasy is a great release, and a major improvement on Demigod. I warmly recommend this album to any friend of modern and fast-paced death metal. Behemoth's music style has changed a lot since their debut; personally I hope that Behemoth would continue on the same rails they're riding on The Apostasy.\n",
        "\nPart one of the best death metal released within the last ten years, or maybe of all time.\n\nMany bands are constantly evolving one sound that is altered from album to album. Fans of the basic idea will tend to find a couple in a given discography that better suit their tastes. Sometimes multiple evolutions take place and Behemoth is a good example of this. Of course, many bands end up releasing one or maybe several good albums before plunging into the void of mediocrity. Thankfully, with Behemoth, this is not the case.\n\nOn The Apostasy, Behemoth manages to beat Nile at it's own game and in doing so, also completely \"annihilates\" 99.9% of other death metal acts out there these days. It's also worth noting that Behemoth released my favorite blackened death metal ever...their work still absolutely blows away the competition. Maybe they will make something of a return to this approach in the future. Either way, each era of Behemoth has it's gems.\n\nThat said, I really like a few of their albums. This one represents the best execution of the approach they've been advancing since Zos Kia Cultus. The vocals on Demigod are just horrible and the riffing and composition are not quite up to this level. Everything seems to be in balance on The Apostasy. It's very memorable, too. The production featured is also the best I've heard from them. Very clean and the instruments have good separation. Yes, of course the bass drums are triggered, heavily compressed, and equalized for that big sound.\n\nReduced are the near constant over layered vocals heard on Demigod. This is a very good thing. And they're also mixed far better. They're pretty standard death metal vocals which is to say \"tough guy vocals\". They're deep and growly. If you are just getting into it, I suppose this is one of the better introductions you could have. At least the vox don't sound like random burping or squealing. There's a hint of black rasp here and there but nothing really substantial as in previous blackened releases.\n\nInferno abuses his kit in ways unspeakable in a high school music class. Anyone saturating themselves with modern DM and it's offshoots will be used to all the blasturbation going on here. LOTS AND LOTS OF DRUM HITS. I'd repeat that like three times if I wasn't so lazy. The point is, there are maybe thousands of drum hits on this album, like most in the genre these days. At least he fits some interesting patterns into the beats sometimes and adds nice tom fills, too. They are definitely varied and he comes up with some really entertaining ones, so it's some of the best I've heard in this genre even if it is a little over played.\n\nThe riffs really make this album though. Lots of badass power chords, fast palm muting and face melting tremolo picking. Death metal, being extremely rhythmic in nature, is especially reliant on good riffing. The guitar tone is important, too and on here it's very searing yet satisfyingly crunchy. The Apostasy delivers big time in all regards and that's why it succeeds at it's goal -- basically a nonstop pummeling intensity. Like all good metal, powerful and creative drumming along with heavy riff work MAKES the sound. The vocals tie it all together. Even if an album or individual songs aren't composed well, I believe that a good overall sound will yield decent marks by itself.\n\nFortunately, Behemoth delivers masterful songwriting and also weaves together a satisfying album, further setting itself apart from similar efforts. The average tempo is pretty high but thankfully all of the songs get to breathe through numerous and engaging arrangements. The variety of sections stick around long enough to satisfy without dragging and the transitions make them flow. Nothing jumps out to distract or frustrate, thereby inducing headaches. I rarely notice song structure as a whole when it's enjoyable but when it derails it immediately grabs my focus and pisses me off because of it's grating annoyance.\n\nLastly, I will touch on the most nebulous aspect of music...\"mood\". This is built on the mesh of instruments, vocals, and pacing but also includes those intros, outros, samples, filler tracks, interludes within a song, etc. Backing keys can help. Or all of these things can fail and end up completely killing the experience. Here, they are tasteful and sparse. Probably for the better since the faster, more direct variants of extreme metal don't seem to gel with lots of atmospheric elements. When used, the additional mood setting is done in a way that doesn't distract from the brutal assault. Some samples here, a fancy intro there, or maybe some synths. The battle trumpets are always welcome to hear. Overall the feeling here is fast, ancient, bestial, and blasphemous. It's a Behemoth album!\n\nIn closing, this is one of my personal favorite albums from these guys. I hold it close to Thelema.6 in greatness. As far as pure death metal, The Apostasy is hard to beat. Fans who haven't heard this one will be guaranteed to enjoy it. The last two songs are a little meh, but forgivable since they're not completely dull and the rest of the album is killer.\n",
        "\nThis is one of the times you wish for someone to awaken the beast. And when the beast is standing on its feet once again you pray for mercy, only this time it is slightly different. This Polish monster won\u2019t spare your life. It will knock you down, making your ears bleed until you bow before its gloriousness. It seems that the apocalypse is here, only a bit different than what you imagined...\n\nBEHEMOTH is one of the few Death Metal bands that has an ascending career since its inception back in 1991 in my humble opinion. From its first raw Black Metal days, the beast grew up to become this devastating war machine we know today. After the band\u2019s incredible last album \"The Apostasy\", which blew me away with its incredible riffing, unmatched technique and impossible brutality (thanks KREATOR for the copyrights!), I was waiting for their next move. So, here it is, the band\u2019s first ever live album.\n\nOver an hour of BEHEMOTH is definitely something that sounds tempting for every fan. The incredible thing is how can these guys perform such difficult songs with ease and make them sound like simple ballads that are based on two chords. Especially Inferno is a fucking beast behind his drum kit! And wait \u2018til you hear the drum solo...\n\nEvery BEHEMOTH favorite is in here, making this live album a kind of live best of collection that is filled with passion, sweat and pure Death Metal. Nergal sounds really enthusiastic screaming all the time, while songs like \"Conquer All\", \"Slaves Shall Serve\", \"As Above So Below\" and \"Christians To The Lions\" make you regret the fact that you were absent from that show (well, all of you who attended it you are some lucky bastards). The sound quality is really good, making this live experience more than pleasant.\n\nI guess that what I have said right now makes \"At The Arena Ov Aion\" a delightful package for every BEHEMOTH fan. You will probably wonder what the catch behind it is. Well, nothing faulty this time. Just a magnificent live album by a magnificent band.\n\nOriginally written for Metal-Temple.Com\nYiannis D.\n",
        "\nWhen you get Behemoth, you know you're going to get a heavy, brutal as fuck album. Behemoth are pretty bad ass musicians, especially inferno. They are all awesome on their respective instruments, but there is something about Behemoth which I just don't like. Usually with most songs, I don't like the riffs much and I find the songs a bit boring sometimes.\n\nIn honesty, the reason I got this album was because I have the shirt for it. I figured well, I have the shirt, I should probably listen to this album. I bought the shirt on impulse, having heard a few Behemoth songs and liking them, I forked out $15 for a Behemoth shirt.\n\nI have heard two Behemoth albums; this seems pretty similar to Satanica. Here the vocals aren't laughably retarded and over processed like they are on Demigod. Nergal's vocals don't sound like your traditional death metal vocals. I've never been a big fan of his vocal work but it is never unbearable.\n\nThe guitar riffs as alluded to above never really appealed to me much. They occasionally hit the spot with songs such as Zos Kia Cultus (title track) and Here and Beyond. But displays of such brilliance were too far and between. Mainly the songs seemed pretty mediocre and dull sometimes.\n\nDrums are pretty bad ass. Inferno is probably one of the best in the business and rips shit up on this album as he always does. Behemoth are lucky to have such a good drummer in their arsenal. \n\nThe album came with a lot of bonus material which are played competently. They cover several bands such as Mayhem and Morbid Angel. I liked the majority of these bands so I liked most of the cover songs. Seriously though what the fuck were they thinking when they covered Hello spaceboy or whatever the fuck it\u2019s called? The song is terrible and it is agonizing to listen to. It\u2019s almost like a bad joke. I always skip this song. \n\nThis is an OK album overall. There are some moments of brilliance but unfortunately there is just too few of them. On the brighter side, the songs never really get boring, so this album is not a snooze fest and its not torture to listen to. All in all, not bad but not that good either.\n\nConclusion: The above is recommended for download only.\n",
        "\nAn Apostasy is an act that marks a departure, and this album is indeed a departure for Behemoth. Released in 2007, The Apostasy is less of a mix of black metal and death metal, and instead tries for more of a melodic brutal death sound. Nergal, the frontman and manager of Behemoth, as well as composer and arranger and all sorts of great stuff, has produced another solid album. But that's all it is, solid.\n\nIt's not that I don't like it. On the contrast, I enjoy some tracks on The Apostasy quite a bit. It's just that it doesn't stand out, on an absolute or a relative scale. Tracks such as Prometherion, Be Without Fear, and Kriegsphiosophie are great headbanger tracks, whereas Rome 64 C.E. and Slaying the Prophets ov Isa are more melodic, none of them have made it into the pantheon of classics. \n\nSo, why an 85? The school I attend has an 85% being an average grade; this is what the album is, average.  Almost pathetically so, but not quite. Inner Sanctum is a great example of what redeems it. \n\nSo, onto the meat of the review:\n\nProduction (3/5):\n\nThe production is pretty standard for most modern bands, and that's what makes the production average as well. It lacks atmosphere, and it feels like it's a further departure than even Demigod. Everything is clear, so you can hear all of the instruments, but the double-bass sounds triggered; it may just be that, through an arbitrary notion, I can't stand thinking of a triggered Inferno, or it may just be the production.\n\nTechnicality (3.75/5):\n\nProbably the above average part of this album. The best example of Behemoth's incredible musicianship is with Inferno's drumming. It is both fast, and flexible. The most necessary trait for a drummer is to be flexible. As for guitars, their work is solid, but it is definitely not up to par with earlier albums or classic albums. Nergal's vocal work is an impressive growl/shout, but it wears down quickly, and leaves you wanting more: which is supplied in Inner Sanctum.\n\nMusicality (3/5):\n\nA lot of rudiments from brutal death and technical death are heard here, mostly in the vein of Nile, and can be easily recognized. It's not to say that Behemoth is using pure stock footage here, but they are certainly using generic forms that aren't up to speed with Nergal's writing talent, something he has demonstrated again and again.\n\nOverall Reception (3.25/5):\n\nSolid, definitely something that you want in your collection for slower days and for some enjoyment. Good for people who are a bit wet behind the ears in the death metal genre, as it provides an excellent bridge into bands such as Nile, who share a certain sonic kinship with Behemoth.\n",
        "\nWith all the past buzz about this cd, I wish I could write a simple review for this, something like \u201csorry, not brutal.\u201d \n\nAll the elements are in place for this to be a killer cd, and Nergal decided to fuck up any semblance of greatness with his vocals. This is the most present factor in the album, and because of it, fan boys everywhere are screaming \u201cBR00TAL!\u201d. Sorry, it doesn\u2019t work like that. If you layer your voice several times in the mix, so much so that I can\u2019t understand the words (not that it\u2019s important in death metal anyways) then you\u2019ve made a conscious decision to stymie the great music that\u2019s going on behind that overpowering voice. \n\nFor that reason, this cd is going to get a bad review. I\u2019m trying to think of a number that contrasts the greatness of drummer Inferno with the poorness of Nergal\u2019s voice. \n\nThere\u2019s a good deal of Nile comparisons that could be made about this cd, not just because of the guest appearance by Karl Sanders, but also in the content of the cd and the atmosphere that is attempted to be invoked throughout. Behemoth can\u2019t pull off atmosphere like Nile. As for brutality, it can be achieved in a number of ways. It can be done with pure simplicity, which obviously is not the case here. It can be done through a build-up, a crescendo of sorts, but everything here is full blast almost all the time. It can also be done by a non-stop assault, which I\u2019m sure is what Behemoth was attempting. The only problem here is that it fails to fulfill that attempt. \n\nThe guitar riff patterns are usually short repetitions of a particular power chord, then break into a tremolo pattern or some sort of scale-riding. You can find this especially present on \u201cXul\u201d. If there\u2019s a bassist here, you won\u2019t hear it. He\u2019s lost in the sea of drums, guitars, and oppressive vocals. In fact, if you were to take Nergal\u2019s vocals out of the equation, you wouldn\u2019t find this to be especially aggressive at all. Nergal is far more aggressive than the music. The second worst performance was by the guitarists, who can\u2019t match the intensity of the drumming with any sort of coherence. To me, Demigod is like a poor man\u2019s Temple of Knowledge by Kataklysm. The fact that Xul is in both recordings is more than coincidence in my opinion. \n\nTracks that I can appreciate are \u201cConquer All\u201d and \u201cThe Reign ov Shemsu-Hor\u201d. The latter has such a better flow than the rest of the cd. In many respects, it follows the kind of hardcore riffing pattern you\u2019d find on any number of Hardcore music projects. To me, this is how the whole cd should have sounded, where the vocals compliment the structure of the song. If you have choppy guitar, you have choppy vocals. Oh my, what a concept. As for the former song, the band is allowed to play in \u201cConquer All\u201d, and thus the song actually does what it\u2019s supposed to do, which is apparently be \u201cbr00tal\u201d. One thing is for sure, and that\u2019s throughout the rest of the songs, either Negal is ruining the guitar riff, or vice versa. After I stop listening, that\u2019s all I can think of.\n\nI love to make fun of bands that dress in makeup and make image more important than the music. I\u2019ve always found fault with that in bands, and Behemoth is no exception. I felt I would describe the musical content of the cd prior to mentioning this, but it must bear mentioning. Zos Kia Cultus had much better tempo and cohesion, and I will always hold it a much superior and more brutal effort than Demigod.\n",
        "\nWhat we have here is a fantastic slab of black/death metal. Brutal in Behemoth\u2019s soul-destroying, all-devouring way, with the usual Egyptian like guitars and crushing drumwork. It\u2019s all here, with maybe a few minor flaws here and there, but altogether an album that would be fantastic with which to introduce someone to not only Behemoth, but the black/death fusion genre itself, as it showcases quite an effective fusion of death metal brutality and black metal atmosphere. This is certainly not a boring album. You never get the same thing in two different songs. Unlike most death metal, you can easily distinguish where one song stops and another one begins, and you can easily tell them apart.\n\nInferno\u2019s drumming and Nergal\u2019s vocals in particular are two extremely unique and distinguishable traits of not only this album, but also the band Behemoth. The former, being insanely fast and powerful, driving the noise along with a singularly crushing force and the latter being an insane, misanthropic howl. Certainly not your usual \u201ccookie monster\u201d stuff.\n\nHorns ov Baphomet \u2013 Intruiging introduction, sounding almost like a binaural beat. We are introduced slowly into the guitars \u2013 fittingly horn like. And the first taste of Nergal\u2019s vocals blows anyone who listens to it away. \u201cRAISE! THY! HORNS!!\u201d I must say, I definitely obeyed. Didn\u2019t you? And the guitars work themselves up into a powerful, screeching, hateful climax. A great way to start the album. \n\nModern Iconoclast \u2013 Rushes along, the drumming breaking bones and Nergal\u2019s howling crushing souls along the way, leaving you only the occasional pause for breath where it slows down, albeit slightly. During said pauses you can literally feel the band, corpsepaint and all, staring you down, telling you to \u201cGet up, fucker! We\u2019re not even nearly done!\u201d\n\nHere and Beyond \u2013 Behemoth\u2019s unique sound. Even if there wasn\u2019t Inferno\u2019s drumming and Nergal\u2019s howls, just the guitar work, it would be easily recognized as Behemoth. Despite this, it\u2019s almost a throwaway song, although I certainly liked the brief orchestral touch at the very beginning. Sounds self-contradictory, I know, but this one doesn\u2019t have quite the same effect, and is not quite as interesting as the rest of the songs on the album. Still worth listening to however.\n\nAs Above so Below \u2013 Almost Behemoth\u2019s magnum opus, this opus is one hell of an epic opus, as opuses (opii?) go. From the really awesome name, to the crushing, sadistic riff (which is painful to listen to in the good way), this song is crushing, sinister and evil. Nergal\u2019s vocals are a lot more distinguishable in this song, further adding to it by allowing listeners to decipher some of the mysterious, evilly cryptic lyrics.\n\nBlackest ov the Black \u2013 Kudos to anyone who didn\u2019t laugh at the name, which bears the obvious stench of someone trying too hard to be kvlt. However, though it may not completely live up to its name, this one\u2019s one hell of a thundering number. The double bass kick is both insanely fast and perfectly executed. True for the whole album, but it is exceptionally noticeable in this song, for Behemoth are \u201cBLACKEST OF THE BLACK!\u201d Slows down a bit in the chorus, and fades out into the first interlude of the album.\n\nHekau 718 - Basically this interlude is a short but effective piece of dark ambient, odd sounding but certainly effective and not calming in the slightest. On the contrary, it\u2019s extremely disconcerting.\n\nThe Harlot ov the Saints \u2013 After the ride slows down, albeit briefly, you are hit with the fast and aggressive \u201cHarlot ov the Saints\u201d. However, in all honesty, this one certainly feels a bit forced, like they tried to hard to physically break your neck after the \u201ceye of the storm\u201d interlude.\n\nNo Sympathy for Fools \u2013 CRUSH! DEVOUR! SLAY!! Easily the best song on the album, this one actually succeeds at breaking necks, unlike the song before it. The riffs are crushing, the drumming thunders along and adds a huge amount to the song. Nergal\u2019s howls are perfect. \u201cFOOLS!\u201d This one grabs Christians by the throat, forces a bible down their oesophagus, crucifies them upside down, then explodes out with an unfathomable combination of force and speed. I highly recommend you get the album just for this song.\n\nZos Kia Cultus \u2013 Ah, the title track. We are introduced by a march-like snare drum, and then are whipped into following its unrelenting pace. This is a slower, but no less powerful number. One of the better tracks on the album, while being overshadowed by its predecessor. Bloodied, bruised, begging for mercy, the listener must march along to this battle hymn of the hordes.\n\nFornicatus Benefictus \u2013 Ah, and if it wasn\u2019t for this bit in particular, the album would have received a 94% at least. This interlude, unlike Hekau 718, does not actually succeed in setting a mood or creating any sort of atmosphere. Just succeeds at being slow, and detracting. Albeit being only 52 seconds long, I recommend skipping this one.\n\nTyphonian Soul Zodiak \u2013 Here we go. We\u2019re back in business, after that short dip into boredom territory. Thankfully it was short, or it would have cost the album more points! One of the more Middle Eastern sounding songs on the album, this contains more of Behemoth\u2019s trademark sound, actually done in a more entertaining fashion than \u201cHere and Beyond\u201d. This one has more of the alternate vocals in the background, which Behemoth also does effectively. Gradually this one speeds up, and turns once again into a powerful, brutal climax. Then it fades, into\u2026\n\nHeru Ra Ha: Let There be Might \u2013 Man, despite titles like \u201cBlackest ov the Black\u201d and \u201cDragon\u2019s Lair\u201d, Behemoth can make some really awesome song titles. Just how cool is that, \u201clet there be might\u201d? Oh, the song? Yes. Well. Yet more brutality. The survivors are found, interrogated, tortured and beheaded. The informants were spared, and permitted to serve as slaves. This one gallops past, with odd yet entertaining rhythms, and before you know it, the albums finished, with a final screech from Nergal and his happy pony kitten friends. \n\nExpect no mercy from this one.\n",
        "\nBehemoth is one of the biggest death metal bands in the world right now. They\u2019ve got over 60,000 listeners on music tracking site Last.FM, which is more than Morbid Angel, Nile, Obituary and many other huge death metal bands. They started as a black metal band, with pagan lyrical themes and maximum atmosphere. Since 1998\u2019s \u2018Pandemonic Incantations\u2019, they have started changing styles, from black metal to blackened death metal. Since their last album \u2018Demigod\u2019, they have been a straight-up technical death metal band (though there are still some black metal elements), often compared to Nile due to their brutality, technicality and Middle Eastern influence (though I would say that Nile have more of all three). \u2018Demigod\u2019 was easily their most popular album, and introduced (along with the rather famous parody of \u2018Slaves Shall Serve\u2019, involving waffles) many people to their rather impressive back catalogue. They return in 2007 with \u2018The Apostasy\u2019.\n\nEven when they were an incredibly unknown little black metal band, Behemoth\u2019s guitar work has been very professional. The only consistent guitar player has been founder Nergal, but, as with \u2018Demigod\u2019, session guitarist Seth has contributed guitar parts to the tracks in both rhythm and lead departments. The pinch-laden riffs are hard hitting but do not really contribute to the song in any way aside from give the music a thick layer of brutality (there\u2019s very few moments on the album where I think \u201cDamn, that\u2019s a good riff\u201d, though \u2018Inner Sanctum\u2019 is a very notable exception). \n\nHowever, the leads are a different story. Shared almost equally between Seth and Nergal, the leads and solos during instrumental sections blow me away. From simply harmonising with the riffs to diminished sweeping licks, these guys can play. They\u2019re always performed and produced with the right amount of emphasis (not all the leads are conventional \u2018solos\u2019 where the rest of the music repeats so the guitar can shine), and are played with taste and technicality, something which a lot of tech death bands find difficult. They\u2019ve improved massively upon the sloppiness of some of the leads on \u2018Satanica\u2019 (I mean, if you don\u2019t have the chops to play something, don\u2019t put it in your song!) and their compatibility with the riffs really impresses me. There\u2019s no moment when the guitarists let me down, because, despite the fact that the riffs can be rather generic at times (there\u2019s a riff in the middle of \u2018Libertheme\u2019 which reminds me greatly of Zyklon\u2019s \u2018Ways Of The World\u2019), there will always be other things in Behemoth songs to listen to.\n\nThe bass player \u2018Orion\u2019 must feel a little cheated. Behemoth bassists of old were given great room to do what they wanted, and could be clearly heard, particularly on their debut \u2018Sventevith (Storming The Baltic)\u2019. Since Orion joined, their production has taken another turn which essentially removes him from any kind of audibility. Perhaps if I could see these songs performed live I would know what Orion\u2019s performance is like, but alas, I haven\u2019t and so all I can say is that he is simply backing up the riffs, and that Nergal has cocked up the production when it comes to bass.\n\nI feel that the one area where Behemoth\u2019s comparison to American titans Nile is justified is in the drumming department. Nile\u2019s drummer George Kollias is one of the best death metal drummers I\u2019ve ever heard, and Inferno doesn\u2019t exactly pale in comparison. He can blast with the best of them (250+BPM blasting is no mean feat) and his fills are ridiculously technical. In fact, that\u2019s another reason I want to see Behemoth live, because this guy\u2019s hands must be a blur. I\u2019m not a drummer myself so I can\u2019t go into too much depth, but honestly Inferno is instrumentally the best member of Behemoth. Listen to any album featuring him (that\u2019s \u2018Pandemonic Incantations\u2019 onwards) and you\u2019ll see what I mean. Brutal death metal is a very demanding genre to play in for a drummer, and it\u2019s played by such legends as Flo Mounier and Mike Smith, but Inferno definitely holds his own, once again.\n\nOnto the one sound of Behemoth which rather annoys me: the vocals. Nergal\u2019s low vocals are fantastic, and there\u2019s no doubting it. He\u2019s got a very gruff shout which sounds like a late-80\u2019s Glen Benton, but he\u2019s been layering his vocals, normally with two or three tracks, one with those brutal lows, and another one or two with high pitched, almost black metal screeches. Both of these sound good when separate from each other but when stacked on top of each other it really grates your nerves. Thankfully, Nergal has toned it down a little for \u2018The Apostasy\u2019 after the layered abomination that was Demigod, and I\u2019m glad because this time around his vocals do sound a fair amount better even when they are layered. He has a great sense of rhythm and timing and his delivery is near perfect. The unfortunate part is what he\u2019s actually saying\u2026\n\n\u2018The Apostasy\u2019 is a good album. It definitely beats \u2018Demigod\u2019, but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s their best death metal album, since it\u2019s beaten pretty comfortably by Zos Kia Cultus. I know that they\u2019ll never make a better album than Storming The Baltic, at least with their current style, though. It\u2019s a solid effort, and musically there are no major faults, but this is the first time that the lyrics have affected my enjoyment of an album in a negative way. They\u2019re, in a word, crap. Nergal thinks they\u2019re very clever and profound but honestly he just sounds like a little child who just found a dictionary of ancient words and decided he doesn\u2019t like Christianity. Despite being a good (music) writer, good guitarist and good vocalist, whilst I read the booklets of Behemoth albums I grow a rather strong dislike for Nergal. He\u2019s written some classic tunes (and there\u2019s a few on here, too, like \u2018Inner Sanctum\u2019 and \u2018Be Without Fear\u2019) but his lyrics are just ridiculous. Overall this album is a decent effort and definitely worth a purchase if you\u2019re into brutal death metal, though for Behemoth there are better places to start.\n",
        "\nZos Kia Cultus sees Behemoth on top form, this album just works, a good example of how to write extreme metal. It is a relentless as you'd come to expect, but not mindlessly so, this is relatively accessible extreme metal, the production is thunderous, the guitars and vocals are all extremely clear.\n\nThis album possesses many classic moments, the title track being one of the finest. It is certainly a very consistent album, each track delivers in its own way. Though each track is as to be expected of a consistent intensity, each track has its own appeal and unique way of working, with Egyptian sounding guitars aplenty in the same vein as alot of Niles music.\n\nBehemoth is a band driven by their drummer; Inferno provides an onslaught on the drums throughout the album, clearly and solidly. This is a feature which comes through alot on the album, it is the first thing to really grab you as you listen to \"Horns ov Baphomet\" and doesn't let you go until the end of \u201cHeru Ra Ha (let there be might). \n\nHaving said that, the album also contains some distinctive and decent guitar work courtesy of Nergal, delivering those Nile esque riffs and technical but effective solos, adding enough variety to retain the listener\u2019s interest\n\nThe only small flaw in the album i felt was the interlude tracks such as \"Hekau 718\" which felt unnecessary and more filler than anything else as it did little to add any more colour to an already brilliant album, but to be honest it is a very minor flaw.\n\nOverall if you like black or death metal (or maybe if you don't like extreme metal at all) there is something here for you, possibly as good as albums such as Morbid Angel's \"Alters of madness\". to be listened to and if you haven't I strongly recommend you do.\n",
        "\nIs it strange for me to say that the elements that made 'Demigod' such a great release are the ones that make 'The Apostasy' rather flawed? It's all a matter of degree, it seems. 'Demigod' was beyond overblown and melodramatic; it was a level of over-the-top that can honestly be only described with the word 'Demigod'. For some people, it was just too much to the point where it was absurd and dumb; to the others like myself, the uncompromising nature of it seemed sort of daring and original. There's not a lot of death metal bands willing to go to that level of theatricism in their songwriting. But a lot of the same elements just don't work on the new album, though I will admit it's a pretty good modern death metal album.\n\n'The Apostasy' sounds like it's supposed to be 'Demigod: Timid People Edition'. Instead of EVERYTHING being constantly epic and soaring, Behemoth restricts it to only specific sections in each song when they're not absent entirely. It's an admirable (I guess) attempt at showing restraint. But for Behemoth being epic, it just seems to be an all or nothing game, because instead of creating an album with a heightened sense of drama through peaks and valleys in the songwriting structure, it just ends up destroying the necessary suspension of disbelief that is a part of newer Behemoth. You see, you have to be in the right mindset to listen to 'Demigod' or it's going to be too much; you have to suspend your disbelief to really get into something so insanely huge at all moments. 'The Apostasy' attempts to circumvent this by having more normal blasting sections and less enormous epic stuff. The issue, though, is that the transfers between these sections are overly clear and sharp, so when the various soaring, slow sections appear, they inspire more incredulous giggles than awe. It is admittedly a very find distinction, but I think it's a major part of the album. It's just impossible to take seriously. Instead of seeing Nergal as some divine god of destruction, you realize more that he's just some dude from Poland.\n\nThe wage of compromise is a loss of constant double-tracked vocals, trumpets, and triumphant war marches, and so 'The Apostasy' falls in quality accordingly. After the admittedly excellent 'Slaying The Prophets Ov Isa', all the tracks blur together for me, unlike the spectacularly unique songs on 'Demigod'. All the elements are still in place; sharp, vicious tremolo riffing, the insanely fast (as ever) drumming of Inferno, the sweeping, mystical solos, and Nergal's full, rich, roaring vocals (though the lack of omnipresent doubletracking does actually harm the performance, amazingly enough), but it feels like the band is restraining themselves from really going for the theatrical jugular like they did on 'Demigod'. It almost sounds like the band was pressured into doing a more 'normal' death metal album, which is exactly what they SHOULDN'T be doing. Behemoth carved a niche of super-epic death metal that verged on spawning its own, unique genre of heavy metal, but this is really step back from that new trail that they could be blazing instead.\n\nI've been rather harsh on 'The Apostasy', and maybe it's unfair to view it in such close comparison to 'Demigod'. It's still very competent and fun to listen to. There's no real sense of failure; just a bit too much hesitance on the part of the band. I doubt you'd regret your purchase of this CD; it is admittedly a lot of fun to listen to, even if you're never really sure which track you're on. I guess I just expected them to go even further instead of dropping back like this. Here's hoping the next album is the full-fledged God that people like me always wanted.\n",
        "\nBehemoth was my first introduction to extreme metal, and this album was my first extreme metal purchase. As such, it has held a special place in my heart. Now, more than two years after I have first purchased it, I decided to try and use my knowledge of metal I\u2019ve attained over that time to review this album objectively, regardless of my possible fanboyism.\n\nThe first thing one notices on listening to this album is the crystal-clear production. Relatively few releases of this type have this kind of clarity of sound, for the sake of the atmosphere of the music. In this case, however, the modern sound job is a bonus. The style of moderately technical playing used here is enhanced by having each instrument clearly distinguished from the others. At no time does any single sound drown out the others.\n\nThe next thing a listener will notice is the sense of atmosphere employed in the tracks. From the acoustic passage sprinkled at the end of \u201cThe Nephilim Rising\u201d to the subtle choir recordings on \u201cThe Reign of Shemsu-Hor\u201d to the light keyboard pieces throughout the album, each track feels like a piece of an occult ritual, or a tale in an epic from ancient Babylon.\n\nDespite any atmosphere, a metal album is nothing if it does not have riffs, but rest assured, there are plenty of those! Much of the album\u2019s guitarwork is an interplay between low plam-muted triplets and higher tremolo-picked riffs, and the use of counterpoint licks at the end of repeated riffs is a common theme here. The band manages to construct their music on a structure of technically competent playing without sacrificing the overall feel of the music. To anyone familiar with Nile\u2019s music, the similarity in terms of melody is immediate and obvious, but Behemoth pull it off in such a way as to make it their own.\n\nUnfortunately, on this record, as in many other death metal albums, the bass is practically inaudible. However, the rhythm section is ably filled by Inferno, the band\u2019s drummer. His speed is impressive, and his fills are tasteful and creative. The vocals, on the other hand, leave something to be desired. Nergal never was particularly understandable, but the double-tracking of his diabolical roar makes it even less so. At times it almost sounds silly (as if you can call guttural vocals not silly), but they do not ruin the listening experience.\n\nThe songwriting is this album\u2019s main downfall, as it varies between very solid, creative, and catchy songs (\u201cSculpting the Throne ov Seth\u201d), and more derivative works (\u201cConquer All\u201d). Some songs contain very cool riffs and melodies, and I feel they could be amazing songs, if only the musical ideas presented within were expanded upon (\u201cThe Nephilim Rising\u201d).\n\nOverall, though not entirely original, Demigod is a very solid album that tries a little too hard to be commercially accessible. Its short packages of brutality are entertaining and sometimes inspiring, but leave something to be desired. However, if you are a fan of modern death metal, this is a recommended purchase.\n",
        "\nLet me just start by saying that Behemoth has been one of my favorite bands since I first got into extreme metal. Demigod seriously blew me away, and I proceeded to check out their other work. Zos Kia Cultus, Thelema.6 and Pandemonic Incantations, along with the aforementioned Demigod are all damn near masterpieces within the black/death genre. But when I got this and listened to it a few times, I found myself loving it sometimes and feeling downright frustrated at others. Why?\n\nFirst off, the intro track, \u201cRome 64 C.E\u201d. is awesome. It opens with some female vocals, leading into an epic-as-fuck chord progression, which resonates into the second track, \u201cSlaying the Prophets ov Isa\u201d. This song is probably the best song on the album, to be honest. The bridge with the chorus over it is fucking awesome, and there isn't a single bad riff in the song. The next song, \u201cPrometherion\u201d, while solid, is a little awkward. Here's why: the fucking blastbeats. They seem totally out of place considering the fact that the song is otherwise mid-paced, and they'd still be very overused even if they did fit the song's framework better. This routine follows suit for the remainder of the album; it seems like Inferno, while becoming more technically apt behind the kit, is just getting into the bad habit of using blastbeats way, way too much. But like I said, it's still a solid song.\n\nFrom here, it just gets more and more dry. The arrangements on the longer songs (\u201cKreigsphilosophie\u201d, \u201cAt the Left Hand ov God\u201d, \u201cLibertheme\u201d) seem repetitive for the sake of being long. They probably wanted to cram more material into the album for length's sake (I mean, the album isn't even 40 minutes), but they fell right on their face in doing so. The aforementioned songs aren't necessarily bad, since they're chuck-full of great riffs, but they're just way too repetitive and drawn out. The more average-length songs (\u201cBe Without Fear\u201d, \u201cArcana Hereticae\u201d, \u201cPazuzu\u201d) aren't anywhere near the standards Behemoth set for themselves with previous releases. \u201cBe Without Fear\u201d is basically just a thrashier, not as good version of \u201cConquer All\u201d. \u201cArcana Hereticae\u201d, while a solid song, is basically just recycled from their other material. \u201cPazuzu\u201d is a pretty bad song truth be told, it has some decent riffs and the choir saves it from being a total suckfest, but it's just not up to standards to be honest. \n\nNow comes my biggest complaint: \u201cInner Sanctum\u201d. The idea of this song may look great on paper, but the execution isn't just lackluster, it's awkward as hell. It starts promisingly enough: a cool piano intro, good lead-in riff, but the first verse with the narration and Warrel Dane singing is like I said, awkward as hell. Then the chorus kicks in. The riff in the chorus sucks, to be honest, and the drumming is metronomical and dull; not doing anything interesting but is just kind of there (and is pretty annoying). This repeats itself one more time, then it kicks into the second half which is just a collection of riffs that doesn't really add to the song, since they don't even fit the framework of the rest of the song at all and just seem like (again) an attempt at drawing it out. Basically, Behemoth tried to make an eerie, atmospheric song and failed.\n\nSo, even though so far I've mostly been complaining about the album, it's still decently solid. \u201cSlaying the Prophets ov Isa\u201d is downright awesome song, \u201cChristgrinding Avenue\u201d is great, and \u201cPrometherion\u201d is solid. Hell, alot of the songs have great riffs but are ultimately marred by poor/lazy arrangements. All in all though, The Apostasy just doesn't live up to the standards Behemoth has set for themselves over the years. If you\u2019re looking to check out Behemoth, start with any of their other releases this decade.\n\nOriginally written by me for http://www.sputnikmusic.com\n",
        "\nMy introduction to Behemoth was less then stellar. 2005's critically acclaimed Demigod proved to me to be a boring and drab album, save three tracks that totally blew my mind away. So, even though Demigod proved to be for the most part a let down, I was still willing to give Behemoth one more chance. When I got word that Behemoth was releasing an album in 2007, I decided to give it a chance. I had heard a lot of good stuff coming from Darsky saying that the album was good, and had watched making of videos on Behemoth's youtube page seeing some interesting things going on in the studio. I was now more stoked to check out this new album then ever, and when the time came, I purchased my own copy of The Apostasy the same way I got Demigod, the great music purchase system called Itunes. \n\nWell, the album was not totally what I expected. I did expect it to be a lot better then it actually was, but in terms of how good it was, it was ten times better then Demigod. The album is further exploration for Behemoth into the realm of death metal and an attempt to further distance themselves from their black metal past. On Demigod we saw them trying to do this while trying to be like a blackened death metal version of Nile. Here, we see Behemoth trying to be, well Behemoth. The Apostasy, through it all, is a much more consistent and stronger album then its predecessor, and it shows Behemoth getting better as musicians as well. \n\nTo start of, I think I should talk about the production here, and some of the key studio decisions taken to make The Apostasy better then Demigod. First off is the production, which is much more grittier and heavier, as well as being more stripped down and simplistic. Gone are the airy, effected vocals of Darsky and Inferno's plastic like drum tone. It is much better here. Big thanks to sound engineer/co-producer Malta for doing this. A main decision in this tone was because Inferno chose not to trigger any of the drums other then the bass drums. Normally, you think this would sound like shit, but here it sounds downright amazing. This album has some of the best drum tones ever, as everything sounds full and organic. Adam's voice is not effected at all, and it is simply left as it is to be. Really good part on the band for the making of the album. Still, the production has its flaws. The main problem is still, no good bass sounds, and the rhythm guitar tone is fuzzy sounding here (not Obituary's Xecutioner's Return fuzzy but still). But hey, it was all to accommodate Inferno, and the improvement shown by the band makes up for it here.\n\nLike I said, Behemoth have gotten better, and Adam Darsky is no exception to the rule. His voice is now, for the most part, straight up death metal vocals. No more death metal growling and black metal rasps overlaid to make a demonic effect, just real good death metal growling that is much more clear and stronger sounding on The Apostasy. Great work there. As well, we find the lyrical themes moving away from Nile and Melecesh worship to back to Behemoth's black metal roots. We here more anti Christian themes (Slaying The Prophets Of Isa, Christgrinding Avenue), cults (Inner Sanctum, Be Without Fear), war (Kriegsphilosophie) and more. We still here a tad of Melecesh knocking off on Pazuzu and Prometherion, but for the most part the album is much better lyrically then on Demigod. Very well done on your part Darsky. You get a cookie now!\n\nOur guitar work is much better here. Behemoth does not make riffs entirely based off of power chords on The Apostasy (something they did nearly all the time on Demigod), they actually play real riffs with real palm muting! Hence the album is much more tight rhythmically when it comes to the guitars, and the riffs are generally more organized and technical as well. Still, they are a tad rudimentary for death metal riffs, along with there are still lots of entirely power chord based rhythms here, and I think if Behemoth wants to achieve true technical death metal status they should work on that. As do they need to work on their lead work. No we actually hear them playing real leads, with Seth not getting much better but Adam getting a lot better then he was. Now we hear less tremolo picking and more alternate picking/hybrid techniques along with basic sweeps as well. Some of the stuff he plays is really actually pretty damn good. I know Behemoth uses their lyrics, stage prescence, and drummer to achieve a more beloved status with fans, but their lead guitar department has shown me that they are capable of more then that. No where near Nile (the band they just love to rip off), but it is still nice.\n\nOnce again, I cannot understand or make out Orion playing the bass, so I am going over to Inferno again. Alright, here Inferno is much better. Like I said, his drums are not trigged, so you would think they would sound like crap. Well they do not. I must commend him for paying homage to the days when drumer triggers did not exist and metal drummers had a tone that did not sound like hitting pieces of plastic. Now they actually sound very full and rich, much like something you would hear from a marching band. You would think this would sound like crap, but like I said, it does not. It is quite impressive to hear, and highly enjoyable. Inferno still has all the speed he had on previous Behemoth recordings and his beat style has not changed too much, but here he actually learned to reserve himself and not just go ahead at full speed all the time. His technicallity has even increased by much, so that gives The Apostasy a few extra points. Still, Inferno could be a tad more varied and still needs to work on reserving himself when required.\n\nThe songs here are pretty interesting. There are several whicn incorporate minor orchestral parts with brass, string, and woodwind instruments, which is pretty interesting. I am not saying they use these in a Nightwish kind of sense, but they use them to provide some dramatiscm to the sound. However, this was not really needed, and I think could have been dropped (I really hope Behemoth does not use this again). However, the songs are more rhythmically accomplished and technical then on Demigod, and are not merely black metal with death metal vocals. This is, for the most part real death metal here. We have plenty of balls out songs like Slaying The Prophets Of Isa, Christgrinding Avenue, and Arcane Hereticae. Also we got some more technical numbers in the form of Inner Sanctum, Kriegsphilosophie, Pazuzu, and At The Left Hand Ov God. The only song that really does not fit under these two banners is Be Without Fear, which is your typical modern death metal, mid paced groove oriented song. While not as good as its predecssor Conquer All, Be Without Fear is still pretty nice and a nice little death metal number that you can enjoy headbanging to. Also a good way to get some fans to without selling out.\n\nAll in all, The Apostasy is a pretty nice album. Behemoth shows improvement in terms of songwriting, guitar work, technicallity, vocals, and lyrical work. But still they continue to give into the trends of singing of ancient cutlures, orchestrals in death metal, and the philosophy of \u201cMore blast beats is better\u201d. Still, it is a much more accomplished and consistent album then Demigod, so I would be willing to give Behemoth another chance to get it right. Until then, feel free to buy The Apostasy. It is enjoyable, and I think that unlike its predecessor, it is worth buying the whole CD.\n",
        "\nSince the release of their groundbreaking Satanica, it\u2019s only been upwards for these Polish masters of blackened death metal. Album after album they\u2019ve set new standards and then surpassed them, again and again and this is no different with their latest creation, The Apostasy. The band has a reputation for the violence and intensity of their music. They\u2019re probably the heaviest act in metal history yet and this album truly demonstrates this. \n\nThe Apostasy is everything we love about Behemoth, crazy fast riffs by the pound, skull-shattering drums and growls that would make the devil run away his tail between his legs. It\u2019s blackened death metal in its purest, heaviest form. This band, actually, seems to be the only one who tried and merge black and death metal without failing miserably. The perfect combination of the harshness and speed of death metal and the melody of black metal gives Behemoth a unique sound and unequaled intensity. With The Apostasy, the formation delivers a nearly flawless album with performances by artists at the top of their game. On the album, you\u2019ll first realize that Nergal has returned to a more \u201carticulate\u201d growl, straying from his performance on Demigod where it was almost impossible to understand what he was screaming without having the lyrics handy. This change adds to the intensity of the album and helps into creating an overall crisper sound. Same goes with the drums, which sound extremely organic and natural, definitely not synthesized. You can tell they wanted to recreate a purer, rawer atmosphere for this album, like they had on Zos Kia Cultus and Thelema.6 with the exception that this time, their budget allowed a much nicer production quality. \n\nInferno, as always, gives a tight, intense and dismembering performance. He maybe not the most technical drummer out there but his violent, fast-paced style his a must for the Behemoth sound. Nergal\u2019s riffs are catchy, mean and original, with some short and unexpected solos. All in all, it\u2019s what everyone could expect from the band. Behemoth is a very technical and talented band, but their talent lies not in being guitar heroes, drum gods and masters of innovation, it\u2019s the overall sound that makes this band the beast that it is. Behemoth is all about the violence. It\u2019s the ultimate mosh pit, headbang, scream out of you lungs music. All songs on The Apostasy, with no exception, deliver so much energy, so much intensity, that it could be difficult for some to listen to this album in one sitting. Also, there\u2019s a new element in the band\u2019s musicality, unlike previous albums, there is something somewhat epic about The Apostasy which was not present in their previous release. This addition to the band\u2019s personality and musicality sends The Apostasy to a higher level than their previous releases, giving the listener more than just the well-known intensity and hatred. All in all, this is their best work yet, and his truly worth a place in this year\u2019s top 10.\n",
        "\nYes, it has a production that could be compared to Mayhem's infamous Pure Fucking Armageddon. And yes, I suppose they where about the same age, if not younger. And no, none of them knew how to play their instruments (or well, I suppose Mayhem did have the upper hand there)\n\nI guess there's no point in telling you about the constant screeching, static noise, the echoing caveman drums or the muffled crackling sounds that are the vocals... or whatever else there is. It is barely listen able. \n\nNow is this without quality? \n\nDamn near it. But there, in fact, listening to this closely, some riffs, parts and ideas that would show what Behemoth would become. This release surely lacks the potential that the \"Return of the Northern Moon\" demo has. Actually, it lacks in everything.\n\nMusic wise, I'd say it sounds very much like a Beherit demotape, and that's also what inspired them, so I suppose it isn't much of a surprise. That is, the songs don't lack direction, as they tried to sound like old Beherit (with a few modifications), but they're all basically the same. Reading \"Demonica\" about the recording of this tape really gives a slight insight and also makes the whole thing a different experience.\n\nWhat to say? There's definitely some kind of mood going on and the musicians where deterimined, but it wasn't enough for more than a bit of charm. Some points for effort, that's all.\n\nAs the title describes; if you like Behemoth and PFA, you will like this.\n",
        "\nI am a big fan of Behemoth, both their old and new work, but I can't really say that the band has ever released anything better than this MCD. \n\nIt is pretty unique, compared to anything else they've done too, as there's more attitude, many solos and no keyboards at all.\n\nSong wise, it is very straightforward and perhaps not incredibly original, but on the other hand; there's a huge variance between the songs. Transylvanian Forest (having a pretty lame intro, I must confess) being straightforward and a bit punkish, Moonspell Rites being a slow, moody piece with a lasting solo. Sventevith, the third song, is quite epic sounding, while Pure Evil & Hate is complete Bathory worship. The last song, Forgotten Empire of Dark Witchcraft is a solemn, melodic and great outro song. \n\nProduction wise, it is perfected as well. It is raw, cold and unforgiving, yet every single instrument can be closely distinguished. That is, even the bass, which actually plays something interesting. The snare drum, by the way, sounds incredibly odd, but it adds to the rawness.\n\nThe vocal performance here is also very good. Not very original either, just outstanding. It is very high in the mix, together with the drums, while the guitars and bass are a bit in the back.\n\nIt has a perfect length also. Hell, everything is perfect about this release.\n",
        "\nSkimming through these reviews, I notice that people are almost afraid to give this snooze-fest anything lower then a 90%, save for a handful. I dont think I'm listening to the same album. This is unlike anything Behemoth has released before, in a bad way. Where's the brutality found on Satanica and Pandemonic Incantations? Where's the insane technicality that was ample throughout Thelema 6 and Zos Kia Cultus? All I hear is watered down, boring and predictable \"death metal\" that is about as heavy as a box of tissues. \n\nThe first glaring problem is by far the vocals. Nergals new found \"voice\" is disasterous, to say the least. The few good songs that are on Demigod are destroyed as soon as you even hear Nergal breath. The multi-tracked growls are by far the worst idea any band has thought up. Wait, let me rephrase \"growls\", as they sound more like Nergal recording himself inhale four diffrent times and then tweak with the pitches so that they sound slightly different than the others. Listening to this sure makes me miss his amazing shrieks on Sventevith. \n\nListening to such songs as \"Sculpting the Throne ov Seth\" and \"Before the Aeons Came\", one can also conclude that Behemoth is borrowing some of Nile's ideas. Karl Sanders guest appearance cements my theory. \n\nInstrumentally, Behemoth is at the top of their game. Blast beats are tighter than ever, riffs are fast and technical, and the Middle-Eastern scales that are heard in some of the aforementioned songs are very interesting to say the least. However, this album is also boring as all Hell. This is not \"br00tal\" or \"Hevay\", this is pretty soft, actually. The drums never do anything interesting, the guitar tone needs to be beefed up, as it sounds thin and weak, and the soft, acoustic intros belong somewhere else, like a Blowpeth album. Dont go down that route, Nergal. \n\nAlso, who thought it was a good idea to put in the meanings behind each song's lyrics in the booklet? Doesnt that defeat the purpose of someone trying to decipher what each song means themselves? Come on Nergal, when you mention \"Sculpting the Throne ov Seth\", we're pretty sure we know your talking about the Egyptian god Seth (or at least those of us who arent Hatebreed-like stupid). \n\nDon't start here, try Pandemonic Incantations instead.\n",
        "\nAnd here I thought the boys from Gdansk wouldn't be able to top 2005's monstrous breakthrough album, \"Demigod\". I thought \"Alright, they'll equal it, but *top* it? This I have to hear!\" Imagine my amazement when, after repeated listens, I've yet to hear anything I wholly disapprove of or outright dislike. In short, they *have* topped \"Demigod\", a tall order for any band to even attempt, and they are the ones to do it. WIth their determination to always improve on all fronts and Nergal's unceasing hard work and ambitious vision leading the way, \"The Apostasy\" is by turns stunningly brutal, atmospheric, original, grooving (dare I say it), martial, and overall outstanding in an overcrowded field. And that says volumes. \n\nIntro \"Rome 64 C.E.\" sets the tone with its haunting, wavering Middle Eastern vocal part leading into a pounding military cadence that in turn sets you up for the devastating opening track proper, \"Slaying The Prophets ov Isa\". And devastating it is with Inferno driving at his usual breakneck blast rate and navigating the song through a series of tempo changes that twist and turn and keep you on your toes throughout the song from vigorous start to breathless finish. This is one of several songs where a choir of 6 weighs in with performances that elevate this album out of the realm of the mundane and into the rarified realm of the unique, as they add an extra layer of depth and passion to the music. A horn section appears as well, their sonorous tones rendering the music all the more epic a la Sear Bliss; they are well-utilized and not overused, as is the choir. \n\nOther standout songs: \n\n\"At The Left Hand ov God\" features, again, a variety of tempos, most often an arresting riff on the verses where the choir enhances Nergal's thundering roars of rage and contempt against Christianity. The drumming and bass work on this tune are excellent, especially at the end where Inferno and Orion take you out on a tribal-sounding feel with a chanting part that adds immeasurably to that part that makes you want to bob your head in time with the catchy, bouncy drumming. This is probably my favorite song on the album musically and lyrically. \n\n\"Prometherion\" is another blast fest that tears by at 100mph and packs a multitude of ideas into just over three minutes without seeming like overkill. Lots of guitar parts and some of Inferno's most frenzied drumming on this little gem. \n\n\"Inner Sanctum\" in another favorite of mine that features some seriously dark and disturbing lyrics, enhanced by Nevermore vocalist Warrel Dane's menacing spoken parts and tortured cries of suffering alternating with Nergal's roaring delivery. Jazz pianist Leszek Mozdzer contirbutes a menacing (and all too brief) intro that sets up the song perfectly and really adds to the dark and doom-filled atmosphere. Nergal has been quoted as saying \"I doubt that happy people can make good music,\" and the lyrics of this song really make you wonder just how sad/angry/self-hating/depressed he could very well be. And he's right, too; how many musicians who are on this level do you know of who make music this passionate and convincing and real? \n\n\"Pazuzu\" starts off with thundering war drums and serpentine bass with hanging dissonant chords and takes off into light speed yet again, a real eruption of negative energy and fury as Nergal's liner notes imply. One of the most furious songs on this album, and a fitting war anthem for the demon of disease and destruction. \n\nThe production, once again mixed by Daniel Bergstrand at Dug Out Studio, is excellent again, with long time sound man/unofficial fifth member Malta handling the production duties. The bass is slightly louder in the mix than last time, but not by much; but when Orion's dense, metallic grind pops out for a few seconds near the end of \"Pazuzu\" it really hits you in the face. The drums are dry yet sound good, and since Inferno only triggers his kick drums now, the overall result is in your face and well-balanced in the mix, and sounds more organic than in the past. The guitar tone is full and dark, with lots of little bits and pieces going on that can't be caught on the first listen. Nergal and returning session member Seth weave a dense tapestry of sound with their amazing riffs (sooo catchy!), frenzied soloing and fills and they whip out the acoustics again here and there as on \"Demigod\" for nice variation. A good performance from all parties involved, I'm happy to say! \n\nThis is once again going to wind up becoming my album of the year for 2007, as \"Demigod\" ended up my album of the year for 2005. WIth such an impassioned performance from all members, the Behemoth war machine is firing on all cylinders and set to annihilate all in its path yet again as only they can do. Couple amazing, ambitious, and powerful music with vicious and sincere lyrics and passion to spare, and you have a modern classic that will be remembered for years to come, I think. And I got it right from Nergal himself that they are embarking on their first ever headlining tour this autumn! A fitting thing for a band this extreme who actually entered the Billboard Top 200 at #149, I dare say. Snap this up and justify that tour, you folks!\n",
        "\nReleased one year after Demigod, Slaves Shall Serve is a limited (5000 made) EP made around Demigod. The EP features seven tracks, including the uncensored video for Slaves Shall Serve. \n\nSlaves Shall Serve is the opening track and is exactly the same as on Demigod. The same great song, beginning with 8 seconds of some of Nergal\u2019s most brutal death vocals ever and then kicking it off with Nergal and Seth\u2019s amazing guitar work. As usual, Inferno proves to the world that he is one of the world\u2019s most talented drummers. Entering The Pylon Ov Light is exclusive to this EP, and the only song made entirely by Behemoth that is not present on Demigod. It\u2019s one of the better songs out of the ones they made for this EP and Demigod. Not as brutal as the opening track but still in Behemoth\u2019s usual range.\n\nThe next part of this EP consists of two covers. Penetration, is a Nefilim cover which is beautifully (it would be more appropriate to say brutally) done by Behemoth. I haven\u2019t heard the original version but however it sounds, Behemoth made it into the best song available on this EP. The drum work is one of Infernus\u2019 finest moments and the main riff is one of the most brutally addictive ones in Death Metal. Until You Call On The Dark is a cover of Danzig. I haven\u2019t heard the original of this one either but it\u2019s far from being as amazing as Penetration. It\u2019s far too slow compared to the rest of the EP and actually features clean vocals\u2026which I usually like with most bands but Nergal doesn\u2019t seem capable to do them correctly. Maybe it\u2019s simply my brain refusing to accept anything other then death growls coming from a Behemoth release.\n\nThe next two are live tracks. Demigod is the live version of Demigod\u2019s title track, played at the 2005 Sweden rock festival. Behemoth is one of the best live bands I know, and this track and the next one prove it. Unlike some other bands\u2019 live recordings which just sound like shit compared to the studio versions, this one conveys all the brutality and energy of Demigod\u2019s title track. The next track is another track played live at the 2005 Sweden rock festival, and it\u2019s none other than Slaves Shall Serve. The opening death growls aren\u2019t as strong as on the album version but the rest is excellent. However, even though this EP is titled Slaves Shall Serve I think 3 versions of the same song out of 7 tracks is a little too much.\n\nAnd finally we have Slaves Shall Serve\u2019s music video. It consists of Behemoth playing in a dark atmosphere with everything shaking, as is the case for most extreme metal video clips and it also includes a bishop who seems quite unhappy and some ladies in corsets.\n\nSlaves Shall Serve is one of Behemoth\u2019s best new releases and I really consider it an important part of their current Death Metal evolution. Definitely essential for any fans of their new sound. It loses 8% for the more average \"Until You Call On The Dark\" and especially the misplaced clean vocals on it.\n",
        "\nI'm sure fans of older Behemoth material are probably going to hate The Apostasy. Where Behemoth used to be a black metal band, they are quickly moving towards a more approachable death metal sound rather than the raw and atmospheric approach to black metal. The Apostasy takes off where Demigod left off and pushes the band further away from the \"kvlt\" black metal sound and into an expanded territory.\n\nThe music is well rounded especially for a band with a sound as solid as Behemoth. Behemoth have never needed to compromise on much of anything but their evolution in musical writing is the true brilliance behind The Apostasy.\n\nThe guitar work is stunningly brutal. Riffs have never sounded so mean and heavy before this album. Even Demigod sounds somewhat tame compared to the opening riff of \"Be Without Fear\". The leads are pretty sparse on the album - melody is something that Behemoth has always struggled with but every once in a while you find a good lead in the music with a nice accentuating pinch harmonic to counter the blast riffs. Most of the leads are somewhat pushed to the back of the production but it doesn't take too much away from the album. The solos are well written and good. Nothing too special about the solos in particular but they are not out of place. Occasionally an acoustic guitar does show up on the album, mostly for atmosphere's sake, and it does give your ears a break from being pummeled.\n\nThe drums are quite amazing on the album. Instead of the essential black metal blast beats for an hour on the album, there is quite a bit of variety in the presentation. There is a lot of tom use on the drums and alongside with good cymbal work it really creates a chaotic sense that really builds hellacious atmosphere. The drumming technique could use a little more emphasis in the mix but that isn't the bands fault - the drumming gets blasted out by the guitars.\n\nThe vocals have always been something that sets Behemoth aside. Nergal's satanic growls are something of nightmares and this time around they aren't overproduced. Going with a more \"raw\" live feel, there is only layers in the vocals for spots where as the rest of the album is a single voice that conjures some of the coolest images. Nergal does vary his presentation a little bit, adding a bit of color to his voice at spots - it is subtle but its there. I should also note that the duet with Warrel Dane is quite interesting considering both have very unique vocal arrangements. That song has some of the best atmosphere on the entire album. The addition of some choirs in the background also give the album an epic feeling.\n\nThe production is striking at how clean everything sounds. The drums and guitars are clean sounds and even Nergal's vocals (despite how harsh they are) are well recorded and mixed. This album is definitely approaching ground that isn't black metal anymore. There is death metal influence all about in the album which gives it an edge on some of the other bands out there. Rather than going melodic like some other \"black\" metal bands - Behemoth have moved even to a more abrasive approach. This is some modern black metal at its best.\n\nSongs to check out: Be Without Fear, Slaying the Prophets ov Isa, Inner Sanctum.\n",
        "\nThe Apostsay is a very similar beast to Demigod. I'm surprised at how similar, considering the vast changes over their previous albums. It's not as dynamic but slightly more experimental with the add-on elements, such as keyboards/horns and choirs. Possibly even more death metal oriented here, they have shed almost all their black metal roots. Brutal aggression is the spirit of today's Behemoth. It's a very intense listen. So much so, at times you almost have to brace yourself to concentrate on the music or be overrun. This is not background music, it demands your attention.\n\nThe music is an aural landslide of technical riffs and inhuman drumming. Behemoth's interplay between guitars is always good, often playing different riffs to build a greater whole. They even have a strange way of sometimes \"tricking\" the listener, playing fast in slow parts and slow in fast pieces. Solos are present again but not as emotional as on Demigod. Going back to And the Forests Dream Eternally the bass played an important roll in Behemoth but as time went on it got pushed further into the background and that continues on The Apostsay. Inferno is one of the finest drummers around. He has great speed and uses frequent blast fills but always knows when a song needs to be pounded slowly. With only the kicks triggered this time the drums sound more powerful than ever. His performance alone makes the album worth listening to. Nergal's vocals are pure death metal growls now, often sounding like the Polish cousin of Deicide's Glen Benton. Fortunately he's learned from the mistakes on Demigod and disposed of the muddy vocal layering, using it sparingly he's much more clear. The addition of choirs was an excellent decision and only enhances the lyrical stance.\n\nAnyone who has followed Behemoth from the beginning have heard them progress as musicians at an alarming rate from album to album, but they have lost some of their uniqueness from their creative peak of Thelema.6 and Satanica. On occasion they slip into generic death metal mode with The Apostsay, bringing to mind bands like Immolation or Incantation. The influence of Nile can be heard as well. But fear not, Behemoth dominates such bands with ease.\n\nThe only song on the album I didn't enjoy was Inner Sanctum because of the vocals. Warrel Dane from Nevermore does some clean vocals which just doesn't fit. His style very annoying and abrasive. It also has extensive spoken word pieces which remind me of the Aresius character from Rhapsody. \"World famous\" Polish jazz pianist Leszek Mozdzer (I don't listen to jazz.) also guests on the track, playing a very creepy intro. He is underutilized though, I suspect it's the most simple thing he has ever played. He appears later in the song as well but is crushed under the Behemoth sound.\n\nThe Apostasy is good but not great. Better than many other bands without a doubt but Behemoth have already set very high standards for themselves. Unfortunately The Apostasy must be judged against their past they have many albums that outrank it, both old and new.\n",
        "\nWhen I found this album, I almost shat my drawers - I had been looking for it for weeks. I decided that I had to set the mood to let it sink in completely, so I got myself a nice pot pie, sat down in my room, and turned the volume on my stereo to \"ear fuck.\" \n\nWhen I first heard the intro, I thought, \"okay, this sounds like an intro.\" It transitioned brilliantly into the first track, which was just the tip of the brutal, jagged, bloody iceberg that is Behemoth's 'The Apostasy.' On 'Demigod', the intro is fantastic - too fantastic - so it was a bit of a letdown when the actual first track began. I immediately jumped with joy when I heard the noticably less triggered-sounding drums - the snare drum sounds like a snare drum, instead of a digital representation of one.\n\nThe next thing I noticed was that the vocals are not as excessively overlayered as they were on 'Demigod.' Though I'm a big fan of vocal layering (I listen to Vital Remains), I found it kind of unnecessary that every single word of every single song was layered 48 times. Layering is for emphasis, and when it's used constantly, it's just cheesy. That being said, the layering on 'The Apostasy,' is used for just that - emphasis - and is used just the right amount. One Nergal alone is terrifying - when the other 47 Nergals come in just for a second, it scares the living shit out of you enough to keep you very, very excited.\n\nThe guitar sound is very sharp and lucid, without being overly clean - just as the guitar on a death metal album SHOULD sound. I was EXTREMELY impressed by the riffing on this album - it didn't seem beaten or repetitive at all, and the signature Behemoth chord progression was altered and fucked with enough on each track that they all stood out in their own way. I don't remember being bored or disinterested for a single second of this album.\n\nThe only problem I had with the album, which is more of a problem with death metal as a whole, is that the bass is practically inaudible. It simply serves as backing for the guitar riffs. I can't take points off of this particular album for that, however, because as I said, that's more of a problem with death/black/blackened death metal as a genre.\n\nEssentially, if you listen to this album, you will shit your pants an average of 591.3 times, so once you get a hold of it, grab some really sturdy grown-up pampers and take a seat on the floor, because cleaning that chair is going to be a hell of a task.\n\nI can confidently say that this is Behemoth's very best yet - it runs huge, flaming circles around their entire catalogue.\n",
        "\nAs one listens to this album they will have no doubts that this is in fact Behemoth, and they have returned with a fucking amazing piece of work. Right off the bat this album will drag you in with its subtle intro; some monotone \"tribal\" vocals, then FUCK, it hits you in the nuts with an explosion of classic Behemoth smash face riffs and brutal drum blasts, all layered behind one of the best black metal voices, quite possibly, ever.\n\nBehemoth has evolved a bit with this album, but the thing that I think Behemoth has built on most during the creation of this beast is the use of more \u201cobscure\u201d sounds. Behemoth has always incorporated choirs and a few assorted brass instruments, but on \u201cThe Apostasy\u201d, they just seem a little more precise and thought out, if you will. For example on one of the best tracks of this album, \u201cAt The Left Hand ov God\u201d, Behemoth opens with what I understand to be a sitar of sorts, or some other obscure stringed instrument. None the less, each extra addition to this album not only contributes the whole package but actually improves what is already superb Black Metal.\n\nAnother aspect Behemoth has worked on a bit more it seems on this particular album is the layering of vocals. This is most obvious on the track \u201cInner Sanctum\u201d. Here Behemoth incorporates an almost Carcass like formula, in where there is the main deep vocals, followed by some higher pitched vocals, and it sounds fuckin amazing.\n\nAll-in-all this entire album really isn\u2019t too different from Behemoth\u2019s prequel album, \u201cDemigod\u201d. Although it isn\u2019t as good as \u201cDemigod\u201d, it does in fact show that Behemoth as a band have begun a little more experimenting it seems. Whether it be with the more obvious use of obscure instruments or the layering of vocals, Behemoth really has begun to \u201cevolve\u201d into something truly powerful, more so even then they are already. Basically, if you have yet to listen to this album and are eagerly awaiting it\u2019s release, continue to do so, because although it may not be as good as \u201cDemigod\u201d, it is an amazing piece of work that will surely not disappoint.\n\nHighlights: \u201cAt the Left Hand ov God\u201d, \u201cKriegsphilosophie\u201d, \u201cInner Sanctum\u201d, \u201cChristgrinding Avenue\u201d\n",
        "\nBehemoth rip through a stellar stet with a commanding stage presence. They're energetic and thrash the whole show and even throw in some fire breathing. A spirited, if not flawless performance with never a dull moment, it's over far too soon. The sound is good, a little thin compared to the albums but it's clear and all the instruments can be heard. The camera work is really good, lots of angles and movement. Better than on the later Crush.Fukk.Create (CFC).\n\nNergal talks extensively to the crowd between songs which is usually a good thing, except he's speaking Polish. Since Behemoth is from Poland and the show was recorded there we can't really hold it against him. I just would have liked subtitles included for us foreigners.\n\nNow the fatal error: the guitar channels are reversed. Havoc is standing on the left and his guitar is on the right channel. Nergal on the right, his guitar on the left. The drums are mixed properly so the problem can't be solved by flipping a set of headphones over. How was this missed before the release?\n\nIt ends with two music videos from Satanica. The first consists mostly of Nergal singing with mythical symbols, fire and whatnot in the background. The other appears to have been filmed on stage before the show. They're alright but the live show is the highlight.\n\nThe DVD format of this release has be labeled a \"bootleg\" by the band. I don't understand why they would be opposed to it but if you're lucky enough to get it, it has a few extras not on the VHS. An interesting fifteen minute interview (subtitled) with Nergal and six audio tracks, a sampling of their previous releases. Also a number of frivolous items not worth mentioning.\n\nPersonally, I prefer Live Eschaton over CFC.\n\n12 tracks: 10 live, 2 music videos.\n",
        "\nSo I was browsing through an FYE and not finding a whole lot. Then I saw this thing sticking out of a Behemoth rack and picked it up. At first glance I thought it was a DVD but after reading the sticker and the back I knew it was music. Not only that but it was a bunch of unreleased tracks and Demos from Behemoth's black metal days. I also saw that it had covers of Hellhammer's Aggressor and Mayhem's Deathcrush! Then I saw the limited to 10000 copies sticker and was sold. \n\nIt begins with the \"Return of the Northern Moon\" demo. As a black metal fan I was thoroughly impressed by this demos production. Somehow Behemoth found the perfected midground between good production and raw production. Unlike a lot of black metal releases you can distinctly cut apart the guitars, from the vocals and the drums. But it's still surprisingly raw and has none of that clean shit that wanna black metal bands like Dimmu Burger have. Return of the Northern Moon is good, it has an old school black metal feel, somewhere along the lines of Darkthrone and Beherit. The Aggressor (Hellhammer) cover is interesting. You know it's a nice contrast when you move into that punchy groove that Hellhammer has and it still maintains a black metal feel with the vocalist doing his best Tom G Warrior impersonation. Cursed Angel of Doom is a very strong track and one of m favorites. Do yourself a favor and skip the rerecording of Transylvanian Forest though. It was recorded during the Demigod session so it has their new Death metal feel to it... You know with the vocalists hyper mechanical vocals that make Arch Enemy's recent releases sound like the rawest most brutal thing ever.\n\nDisc Two holds the \"From the Pagan Vastlands\" demo on it and I can only say one thing about this piece of black metal... \"God... Damn...\" The first song, \"From Hornedlands to Lindisfarne\" starts off with an eastern acoustic guitar and then kicks in with a tremeloing black metal guitar riff all accompanied by an Emperoresque synth playing through the background. The awesomeness doesn't stop there, Behemoth seem intent on kicking you teeth out with the rest of this demo. \"Return of the Northern Moon\" was good but \"From the Pagan Vastlands\" is where Behemoth throw so many other black metal bands into the gutter. My favorite tracks are probably: \"From Hornedlands to Lindisfarne\" and \"The Dance of the Pagan flames\". The Deathcrush cover is good, too. I just thought I'd mention that.\n\nThis CD is for fans of bands like Emperor, Darkthrone, Mayhem, and Hellhammer. Probably not for fans of Dimmun Burger or Behemoth's Demigod taping. Unless of course those fans also happen to be fans of the aforementioned black metal bands.\n\nOn a side note: This set also comes with a 44 page booklet which includes all song lyrics, and some writing from th band along with some interesting photos and artwork.\n",
        "\nBehemoth has always put a little more into their music than most other metal bands. Just reading through Demigod's included booklet one will noticw how much thought and care was taken in writing the music. Nergal attributes every riff and every lyric to some experience or personal endeavor. This effort and high level of influence really seems to show in the music in the end. In writing, the band plays around with some odd cultural elements in their music to give it a truly distinctive edge, as well as throwing in some unusual timing and putting their own spin on the essential basics.\n\nThere's something about Polish death metal that really hits like a sledge hammer. Maybe it's an emphasis on genuine aggression instead of the noise-based blasting that most death metal bands use to sound \"brutal\". Behemoth, Vader, and Decapitated all manage to hit a new level of heaviness in their own styles. Behemoth distinguishes themselves by using said influences. In the opener, Sculpting the Throne of Seth, the appropriately unexpected use of acoustic guitars is immediately displayed. The following riffs also display excellent use of odd timing, as the guitars and vocals are offset in a strange, yet fitting way.\n\nThe rest of the album spans quite a spectrum of death metal styles. Slaves Shall Serve is a straightforward brutal antichristian rant, complete with the most menacing shouts in metal. The Nephilim Rising features an amazing acoustic outro. Xul throws out some of Behemoth's most melodic moments, as emotional licks compliment the usual heaviness. Karl Sanders from Nile provides an ultimately unneeded guest guitar solo, which adds an even more technical feel to the album. Conquer All and Demigod both bear some fucking merciless riffs worth of the unholy hairwhips. The epic closer, The Reign of Shemsu-Hor, ends with some simple but effective metal riffing and more acoustic guitars playing some eastern scales.\n\nDemigod could be spoken of endlessly, so the only real way to learn of it is to listen for yourself. Rest assured any time spent investigating Demigod is time very well spent. This is Behemoth's crowning achievement so far and only The Apostasy can (and from the sound of things, most likely will) dethrone this as one of the best and most unique modern death metal albums.\n",
        "\nBehemoth are one of those bands that genuinely have paid their dues. From their inception in 1991, they've clawed their ways rung by rung up the ladder of the metal scene, starting as a relatively unknown black metal band, and now being heralded as one of the largest extreme metal bands in the world today. It's difficult not to be inspired at the very least by how hard Behemoth have worked to come to where they are today, leaping over the corpses of lesser bands to stardom while still retaining their artistic integrity. In interviews with the band, one can always get the impression that they are striving ever forward in their particular field.\n\nWith 2004's 'Demigod', Behemoth went from second-tier (in status, not quality) death metal band to being catapulted into the very forefront of the extreme metal scene. This indeed made Behemoth a very public endeavor; suddenly the band was on the tip of everyone's tongues, even many people who you would never expect to be seen in conjunction with our breed of music. When one hears the album, it's not difficult to see why: 'Demigod' wasn't a request of the public to be noticed; it was an attack on the metal scene as a whole, grabbing every writer, artist, and listener by the collar and ordering them to listen. Such a sentiment is portrayed in the music: extravagantly bombastic and epic, nearing corpulence but never quite achieving such ignominy. It's an album that never backs down and is inherently aware of its own grandeur.\n\nElement after element of brutal energy blazes by, while synthesized trumpets seem to announce (in an utterly arrogant yet undeniably compelling fashion) the Arrival Of Behemoth, capitalization necessary to capture the utter force that the band exudes with every snare roll and power chord. Behemoth doesn't need the listeners; they know well enough that the strength of the sounds on this record would act as a Pied Piper to those who had even the most passing interest in extreme music. Arrogance, pride, hate: all elements that, though typically viewed as distasteful, entranced the public and lured them into the fold using only forty minutes of death metal on plastic.\n\nStep one: 'Sculpting The Throne Ov Seth', opening with an acoustic intro that lasts a mere twenty-four seconds before a riff of utter majesty descends upon the listener, accompanied by the thunderous double bass and crash cymbals of Inferno, like the riotous cries of the legions returning to Rome upon conquering a far-off land. And this is a theme that will be repeated numerous times before the album is out: this distinct Arrival of the Polish kings, and an impression that you really should appreciate such a gesture much more than you do. The same occurs on the next title track, where trumpets announce the becoming before the drifting guitar of Nergal ignites the very air, amid massive declarations of 'Rise now above the weakness ov flesh/Come forth! Join ye the arsenals ov blasphemy' from His mighty multi-tracked roars. Satan watches approvingly.\n\nAnd such things are echoed in even the tiniest of movements: be it Inferno's tiny ride cymbal on 'Demigod', or the presence of the largest, most awe-inspiring riff crafted by man and god alike that makes its appearance on 'Conquer All' amidst the screams of blood from the mob, or the legendary 'Speak ov me not as one/Speak of me not as none/Speak ov me not as all/For I am continual' refrain of 'Sculpting The Throne Ov Seth'. Perhaps the very most decadent moment on 'Demigod' comes on the live staple 'Slaves Shall Serve', which can only be described as 'massive', putting all doom metal bands described as such to shame with its endless rivers of blast beats and sneering, triumphant guitarwork. Behemoth touches all, commands all, and, yes, conquers all. Every member plays, nay, composes to utter perfection.\n\n'Demigod', while difficult to truly grasp on the first listen, is truly an album that can be described as 'great' in every fashion. Rarely does the world see an album of such majesty.\n",
        "\nBehemoth's Pandemonic Incantations is the third full length from this steller polish metal force. What this album tends to invoke really are chaotic blackened hymns. Not the sort one would imagine black sorcerers singing in a twisted wood, but more akin to the conjuring recitations of a demonic entity itself. The production is strong and powerfull though I can't but help to, at times, wish for something slightly rawer. Overall the production is fantastic with every instrument really standing out in the mix but at times, standing apart in the mix - notably some of the horn parts.\n\nThe guitar tone is powerfull and raw; trebly but not irritatingly so. Nergal unleashes torrents of riffage upon us with each song. Each song has a twisting demeanor like black food dye dropped in a glass of murky water. The bass is fairly simple compared to the intricate noodlings of Nergal. Mefisto's tone is quite clean but somehow refuses to contradict the album's dirty atmosphere. His simple bass lines could be a bit more involved in some places. Many times he is keen to simply play the basics which doesnt always sound bad but, sometimes doesnt always sound the best. Inferno's drumming is a highlight for me. It is varied beyond belief and he utilizes tons of techniques. Nergal's voice is, well, ridiculous. Like a screaming visage of death emerging from blackened clouds of fire and brimstone, his vocals simply pummel you at every chance. Although the vocals are fantastic, they aren't really breaking the bounds of...well... anything in the metal spectrum like I suspect he can do. The hint of clean vocals at the beginning of The Thousand Plagues I Witness is a slight blip that he has the ability. There are some horns and trumpets strewn about also which sometimes add and sometimes detract.\n\n\"Driven By The Five Winged Star\", despite what seemed to me a hasty ending, is a favorite of mine as is \"The Thousand Plagues I Witness\". Both twist and turn, bubble and churn, but are still enjoyable regardless of the complicated compositions. I would have really enjoyed several more straight foward tracks to break things up and just let me enjoy the brutality but that is a minor complaint really. For the most part the album lives up to a standard compositionally that allows the songs to be complex without sounding pretentious and stupid. Behemoth could have used some different methods of switching between parts aside from the absurd amount of drum fills but I think that this is more a mark of a developing band than a mark of bad songwriting. With Inferno's drumming prowess, his fills are always good which also is a big help.\n\nOverall Pandemonic Incantation sounds awesome and really does bludgeon decisively. Songs like the above mentioned and \"The Past Is Like A Funeral\" show a band capable of writing music that is melodic, destructive and brutal but retaining a credibility within the style created for them. Behemoth show a huge array of techniques and influences on this album which helps give them a unique sound and style. Backing keyboards help give an epic sound but, unlike so many other bands, don't ruin the sound totally. I would say that if your a fan of Behemoth from some of the more recent albums and have not had a chance to listen to this, your missing out on a major part of their repertoire. If you have never listened to Behemoth at all, then this wouldn't be a bad place to start since the albums afterward just get better and better.\n",
        "\n..this would have gotten an even lower score. Why? Keep reading.\n\nI really like nowadays Behemoth, as they are a quite original and strong force in Death Metal, but many latter-day fans seem to neglect their Black metal past. I knew a few songs of their old times before, but since my interest in Black metal has rapidly increased over the last two years, I decided to check out a complete full-length. \n\n\"Sventevith\" is definitely a Black metal album. It has its fair share of Norwegian influences, but I don't see it as being \"too unoriginal\" (as Nergal recently said). Behemoth rely on their Norwegian counterparts, but they also managed to set themselves apart far enough (at least for me). \n\nI don't want to defend this album, though. The songwriting is not up to par with later Behemoth (a problem that was common in their music 'till Pandemonic Incantations) and some of the songs simply plod along and the listener\u2019s attention starts to fade. \n\nWe also have two \"interludes\" often described as \"Ancient Polish Folk\" but that's just an excuse for two bland (especially \"The Touch of Nya\" ) acoustic/synth tracks with lousy production and shoddy performance. \n\nThe release itself is just pretty mediocre, but \"Hell Dwells in Ice\" just somewhat saves the album. It is another folkish clean guitar song but this time with great spoken passages and simple, yet effective picking. Very moody, atmospheric and memorable. Wish they'd have more songs like that on here. \n\n\"Transylvanian Forest\" closes the album, a track supposedly written quite some time after the others, but has a rather punkish attitude (drumming) with an early Graveland-esque two-step beat mixed in for good measure. It has few good riffs, but somehow doesn't fit too well to the rest. Well, at least it also stands out. \n\nIn conclusion, \"Sventevith (Storming Near the Baltic) is a rather lacklustre Black metal release, with a few moments showing a band that is capable of so much more. \n\nI recommend it if you enjoy Black metal, but this is far from essential.\n",
        "\nBehemoth \u2013 Slaves Shall Serve\n\nA follow-up to the tremendous Demigod, this EP serves as sort of an epilogue. It is a must for any Behemoth addict, which would be me. This album is an even split between studio tracks, covers, and live tracks.\n\nFrom the studio we have \u2018Slaves Shall Serve\u2019 of course, and also the previously unreleased \u2018Enter the Pylon of Light.\u2019 Both are powerful, brutal tracks featuring machine-gun double kicks and blast beats from everybody\u2019s favorite, Inferno. I really can\u2019t say enough good things about \u2018Slaves\u2019. It started life as a standout track on Demigod, and is the centerpiece of this little EP as well. Can the first track be a centerpiece? Whatever.\n\nNext up we have a couple of covers. \u2018Penetration\u2019 is from a British sort of Industro-Goth Metal act called \u201cThe Nefilim\u201d. See, this is what covers are good for. I might never have given The Nefilim a second glance if not for this. They have a techno-organic kind of sound, like early Ministry. It has a relentlessly driving metal beat, but is too short.\n\nThe other cover is \u2018Until You Call on the Dark\u2019 by Danzig. I\u2019ve never been a big Danzig fan, and after hearing this, I\u2019m still not. I\u2019m sorry, but Danzig tunes all sound a little half-baked to me, and clean, or even clean-ish, vocals on a Behemoth track just isn\u2019t right.\n\nFortunately this is over soon enough and we get to the two live tracks. Inferno RAGES on Demigod live, like a drum machine possessed. Unlike some Black/Death bands, Behemoth does not rush through songs just because they\u2019re fast. To me, this says that they are not simply playing as fast as possible, they are playing at a deliberate tempo, which just happens to be very fast. I believe this is every bit due to Inferno\u2019s mastery behind the drumkit.\n\n'Slaves Shall Serve' live again stuns me with the quality of live Behemoth, considering the complexity of some of their tracks. Good way to round out the EP. I ended up giving it only 80% because of that Danzig track, but that\u2019s just personal taste. Still a must for Behemoth fans.\n",
        "\nThis first EP from Behemoth will be, if you only know them as they are now, something totally different. This is not DM, but great and wonderous Black Metal. Harsh, raw and full of hate, a band that is full of aggression and the hunger to make an impact upon the scene. They couldn't sound this good nowadays with their new style, because Black Metal just has so much more to offer to the table than DM. \n\nOne word can sum up pretty much this entire release: raw. The guitars are very trebly and have a great sound to them. The drums are not as double bass heavy or blast beat heavy for that matter, as the new stuff but yet they offer great variation (for BM that is.) Vocals are HARSH! Nergal sounded great back then and as I write this review and listen to this at the same time I can't help but be dismayed at why they had to change. Certainly BM gives you more \"kvlt\" points than DM and as I said before, has much more to offer. There are some good solos too on this but nothing that hasn't been done before. \n\nTransilvanian Forest is definately the standout track here. It's harsh yet beautiful and full of hatred. The drums near the middle of the song are fucking great. The solo at the end is great. Hell, the song is perfect. The rest of the songs are all offering something that sets them apart from the others. Pure Evil and Hate is Bathory all the way and Forgotten Empire of Dark Witchcraft is very atmospheric, with acoustic guitar, clean electric guitar, keyboards and a very well pronounced bass. Ok, I take back what I said before. THIS is the standout track. Damn this is fucking beautiful. \n\nIf you can find this EP, BUY IT IMMEDIATELY! Old Behemoth is where it's at, not their newer, more br00tal boring DM. Now if only they'd play more of this stuff live...\n",
        "\n1998 was an extremely important year the history of Behemoth. Inferno joined the band as a full-time drummer, bringing a whole new power and fury to the band with his incredible skills, while main man Nergal\u2019s songwriting began the change from black metal to death metal while still combining elements of both. All of it coalesced into one foul monster of an album, PANDEMONIC INCANTATIONS.\n\nWhereas the previous album, GROM, was a full-on black metal assault, this disc incorporated death metal influences into the band\u2019s sound and toughened it up, making sound even more vicious and heavy than before. The focus of the lyrics also began to shift from paganism to more Satanic-based themes. In fact, only one major remaining link remained to the past: Nergal\u2019s inhuman vocals, now even more abrasive and evil.\n\nCrushing songs like \u201cIn thy Pandemaeternum\u201d took the Behemoth sound to the next level, in large part due to Inferno\u2019s insane drum ability. The man is a whirlwind behind the kit, flailing away with such precision that it\u2019s scary. Of course, awesome drumming is totally useless without great songs to bash around, and Nergal wrote some of his best here with \u201cThe Thousand Plagues I Witness\u201d and \u201cSatan\u2019s Sword I have Become\u201d. Brutal and uncompromising, these songs are like poison darts straight to the heart of Christianity, bellowed forth by Satan\u2019s chief war master.\n\nStill, for whatever reason (apparently the band didn\u2019t get much label support for this album), PANDEMONIC INCANTATIONS, much like the rest of pre-Satanica Behemoth is largely ignored. This is inexcusable. This album planted the seed for what Behemoth would eventually become, and is an amazing slice of death metal in its own right. Go now, find it, and revel in its power. \n\n-------Originally posted at Metal-Rules.com-------\n",
        "\nBehemoth is a name that has long been associated with the highest quality heavy metal, especially since the band started making a big name for itself with its death metal releases, beginning with 1999\u2019s SATANICA. Mostly due to availability issues, many fans are unaware that the band had put out three official releases prior to that (excluding demos). What\u2019s more, the albums were quite far away from the precision death metal crafted by the band now; instead the albums fell squarely within the confines of mid-90\u2019s black metal, right down to the extreme heathenistic lyrics. GROM was the band\u2019s third release, surfacing to light in 1996.\n\nSo what does Behemoth circa 1996 have in store for us? Well, like I said, it\u2019s pretty extreme black metal, cold and evil. The band at the time consisted of main man Nergal, plus two accomplices named Ravenlock and Les, neither of whom would survive until the next full-length. \n\nNergal has said that GROM is his least appreciated album in the Behemoth canon, not liking the \u201cexperimental\u201d aspects that band tried, such as female vocals and choirs. Personally I found these to be small elements of the album, not really adding anything, but not detracting from the experience either. For the most part, this is searing black metal done up right. Favorites include the blistering \u201cSpellcraft and Heathendom\u201d which probably features the most tortured vocal performance on the record, and the catchy fuzzy bass of \u201cThou Shalt Forever Win\u201d. \n\nIt is clear that Nergal was a master riff craftsman even back in \u201996, as each song on here is memorable, except the somewhat annoying \u201cLasy Pomorza\u201d. So while it is quite a different beast than the Behemoth of today, the band\u2019s black metal era is nothing to be ashamed of. GROM is definitely worth finding. \n\n-------Originally posted at Metal-Rules.com-------\n",
        "\nThis is another album which isn't quite Behemoth's old raw black metal nor the new black influenced death metal. Its not really that good, despite some decent moments. This album and \"Grom\", although not total disasters are probably the two worst albums Behemoth released. \n\nThe album starts off with \"Diableria\" which is a short intro. It really doesn't do much for me. It has an eerie haunting sound to it and some chanting in the background towards the end. Next is \"The Thousand Plagues I Witness\". This song also really isn't impressive. It has mediocre vocals, bland and boring riffs, and only towards the end do we get something decent, which is a guitar solo, and even that is placed in the background so you don't really get to appreciate it much anyway. \n\n\"Satan's Sword (I Have Become)\" is a faster song with some fast drumming and decent vocals, but the riffs here are once again bland and boring. Its basically almost one riff being played over and over and we don't even get a solo at the end to somehow make the song bearable. Its pretty bad. \n\n\"In Thy Pandemaeternum\" is another faster paced song, but at this point in the album we do notice some change. This song is much better because the riffs are a bit more melodic and not as bland. The vocals are passable, and the drumming is pretty good. Even though the riffs are still repetitive here, at least the riffs themselves are a bit more interesting and melodic. Probably the best song so far. \n\n\"Driven By The Five-Winged Star\" is another more melodic song and we could see that right from the first riff. Even though it sounds kind of doomish and it is slow, it sounds a bit more melodic and atmospheric. At about 40 seconds the song picks up speed, we get a bit more melody, and we even get a quick solo in the background, and it isn't the only solo. This song is full of short but to the point and melodic solos, making it one of the best songs on this album. \n\n\"The Past Is Like Funeral\" starts off pretty doomish and slow again before Nergal's scream comes in and the song picks up in speed and melody. This song while long and not very interesting does have some melody and atmosphere, so that already makes it better than the first few tracks in the beginning which were really a pain to listen to. \n\n\"The Entrance to the Spheres of Mars\" is the best song on here. It starts off with a melodic but blackened riff and although the constipated vocals make a return here, the added melody and atmosphere make this song pretty enjoyable to listen to. \n\n\"With The Spell Of Inferno (Mephisto)\" is another pretty horrid song. Sounds experimental. All it has is basically one riff being played over and over with the synths coming in from time to time and chanting in the background. Its very annoying and pointless and should have been left out of the album, but looking at the length of the CD, it looks like they just needed some filler shit to make it a bit longer. This however is still better than the shit we have for an outro which is basically a bunch of noises put together with some synths and sounds like a broken CD thats still holding on for its dear life. Absolutely horrible...it actually hurts my ears. I was able to handle the shit at the beginning but the last two tracks were just an absolute embarrassment for a band like Behemoth. \n\nWhile this album has a lot of shit on it, thank God there are some pretty enjoyable songs right in the middle. This sounds more like an experimental album than anything. It seems like they were bored with trying to be like black metal, which is why thankfully the next album introduces their new style.\n",
        "\nI've never taken the initiative to listen to Behemoth before because I've always thought that if a band didn't care enough to come up with a creative title, then they probably don't care enough to make good music either. But I was wrong! I found this CD yesterday and figured that since it was so cheap I might as well at least give it a preview, and I'm glad I did. The brutality far exceded my expectations for a band with such a generic name.\n\nThe guitar riffs are bad ass, and the tone is unbelievable. Even the solos were decent, although a bit too short and random for my tastes. The drums were heavier than what I'm used to and the double bass kicks were unbelievably fast in some parts. I didn't think the vocals were as good as they could have been, but they weren't so bad as to ruin the music, either. I guess they were more-or-less average for death metal.\n\nI think the highlight of the album is Penetration (track three), although the title track is also pretty good. My least favorite is Until You Call On The Dark (track four), because the main riff in the song sounds like something by Smashing Pumpkins, only with a better guitar tone and less annoying vocals.\n\nThe Slaves Shall Serve video didn't really do anything for me. I generally don't like metal music videos anyway, because they tend to be random and confusing, and not have very much to do with the song. This video was no different, but at least they had some hot bitches in corsettes to make up for it. I guess they were supposed to be representative of sex slaves, or something.\n\nOverall, I have no idea how well this album compares to anything else by the same band, but it's not bad by itself. At the very least, I think it's worth the $8.99 that I payed for it.\n",
        "\nToday Behemoth is something way different from when they first started their careers. Behemoth's demos were awesome and real raw black metal. While this album can still be classified as black metal, it does start to show some signs of change. I think that this album is definitely a weird one, because its not truly black metal, and it isn't as good as the demos or as good as the death metal with blackish influences that would come after this album and the next. \n\nThe \"Intro\" I am neutral on. It isn't bad, but it is a bit boring. Its mainly the same melody being played over and over again by some weird instrument which sounds like an organ with some weak drumming in the background. For me the album really starts with \"The Dark Forest\" which is a pretty good song. It starts off with an angry scream from Nergal, and starts off very fast and brutal before it slows a bit. Its a rather long song, but it varies and doesn't get boring. Nergal's vocals here still have a typical black metal rasp but it is rather high in the mix which isn't always typical in raw black metal albums. The song has some breaks where we only have acoustic guitar, and it has some female vocals, which are good, but once again makes this album weird in that you can't really classify it as black metal...how many true black metal albums have female vocals going back and forth with clean male vocals for a bit? I can't think of one. Towards the end we also have a pretty nice and melodic solo which gets into a pretty high tone towards the end of it. Overall a different song but its one of the best on the album. \n\n\"Spellcraft and Heathendom\" starts off with a pretty catchy riff that keeps going for a while. The song is another pretty fast one, with some good vocals and fast drumming. At times though we get a melodic riff that comes in front of the main guitar. It gives the song a bit more of a melodic feeling and also a bit more atmosphere. Another decent song. \n\n\"Dragon's Lair\" starts off with a melody from what sounds like a synth before the rest of the instruments come in. It is also a bit of a melodic song with a break for acoustic guitar. Pretty enjoyable as well. \n\nThe next song is \"Lasy Pomorza\". Being Polish, I was interested in how this song would sound since the lyrics are sung in Polish here, and I haven't heard polish vocals in black metal yet. The song isn't all that incredible though, a pretty dark riff that is repeated a lot with some raspy vocals. If it weren't for me knowing that this song had polish lyrics, I wouldn't be able to tell anyway because of how unclear Nergal is singing them. So I really wasn't impressed with this song.\n\n\"Rising Proudly Towards The Sky\" is another pretty unimpressive song. It sounds a bit like \"Lasy Pomorza\" in that its a pretty typical black metal song with little atmosphere and dark riffs being played over and over. The only interesting thing in this song is the solo in the background being played toward the middle. Towards the end there are some weird vocals which almost sound like moaning and they got a bit on my nerves.\n\n\"Thou Shalt Forever Win\" is another song that sounds like its two predecesors. It has a break for acoustic guitar and it has a solo but the other parts just get boring, with the weird vocals and the boring typical raw riffs being played over and over. \n\nThe closer, \"Grom\", is a much more interesting song. It still sounds like raw black metal (despite the weird vocals at times), but it has a chorus sung by a female. Her singing is weird, but its different, and a bit more interesting and less annoying than the weird male vocals. As typical it has a break for acoustic guitar. One of the better songs on here.\n\nSo even though many of the songs have a raw black metal feel which I like, there are several things that ruin this album and separate it from black metal. One or two of the songs are a bit melodic, which isn't a bad thing, but isn't typical to black metal, and the weird vocals. The female isn't bad, but when the guy comes in with the vocals, it basically sounds like a constipated man moaning loudly. Pretty annoying. It isn't a bad album by any means, but I was expecting more of a black metal feel still kind of like their demos.\n",
        "\nThis EP has been released only in 1000 copies for the Behemoth \"The Act Of Rebellion\" tour, and is now a very rare collector's item... it's a shame that not so many people can have this kick-ass EP! The first song is the titletrack, taken from the \"Thelema.6\" album. \"Antichristian Phenomenon\" is a great track: short but powerful, with evil lyrics and great vocals by Nergal, as usual. This track is followed by \"Malice\", a non-album song completely written by Havok: it's kinda different from Behemoth's style in \"Thelema.6\", so we can find it here on this EP. It's a good song, anyway. Song number three is a re-recording of their classic \"From The Pagan Vastlands\", from \"Svevntevith). Behemoth really achieved a great resul with this re-recording, the track is now more powerful and evil, compared to the original one. Four covers follows: \"Sathanas\" by Sarcofago, \"Hello Spaceboy\" by David Bowie, \"Day Of Suffering\" by Morbid Angel and \"Carnage\" by MayheM. Nothing to say on the MayheM, Sarcofago and Morbid Angel covers, they're all good death or black metal songs and they sound good played in Behemoth's style, but the David Bowie's cover is kinda strange: as strange as a rock song turned into a death metal song; it's not bad, but definitevely \"weird\"!\nAnyway, this is a great EP and my advice goes to all of Behemoth's fans: search this album and try to get a copy, it's really worth its price!\n",
        "\nWhile Behemoth is most well known today as a fantastic death metal band, their roots were actually in black metal. This 5-track EP marks perhaps the high point in their time in black metal. \n\nUnsurprisingly for a black metal EP, the production isn't far from impressive. The bass can be difficult to pick out at times, and the drums sound somewhat odd. However, the guitar and drums are clearly present and fit the music well. \n\nEach of the tracks has something to offer. Transylvanian Forest begins with a \"grim\" intro of crows cawing, then opens up to some very aggressive black metal. Nergal does a good job, with his vocals fitting the atmosphere of the music well. The second track, Moonspell Rites, is probably my favorite on the EP, with a catchy rhythm and very different song structure from the rest of the album. Sventevith (Storming Near the Baltic) is the most aggressive song on the album, and features a great solo. Pure Evil and Hate is the shortest song on the album, and doesn't really bring anything new to the table. It's very similar to the previous track. The final song, Forgotten Empire of Dark Witchcraft, has a very bleak mood and sounds superb. The guitar, especially, sounds excellent on this track. After the raw aggression present in the two previous tracks, this slower, more melancholic song is the perfect closer.\n\nAll in all, this is a quality black metal release. My major complaints are the production, which is a bit too raw at times, and a slight lack of diversity in their songwriting. Tracks 1, 3, and 5 are a bit too similar and don't do enough to distinguish themselves. Despite these flaws, however, I highly recommend this EP.\n",
        "\nWhile their first album \"Storming the Baltic\" was a classic black metal album along similar lines as Graveland and early Emperor (and would be later a giant influence on Nokturnal Mortum, among many others), Nergal and the other guys in Behemoth were not content. They continued their push to expand their sound and create black metal with true feeling.\n\nThis album sets itself apart in many ways. The pure atmosphere of the music is perhaps the most striking thing. Listening to this I am captivated from beginning to end, put into a land of darkness, endless forests and pagan spirits. The guitar has the high trebble fuzz sound of Burzum's Filosofem and Darkthrone's \"A Blaze in the Northern Sky,\" while the drums blast and pound away like Mayhem's Hellhammer. The riffs themselves are very Mayhem-ish (unsurprisingly on the \"Chaotica\" 2 disc set, there is a bonus cover song of Mayhem's \"Freezing Moon\"), they have a melodic edge, and also a very aggressive feeling. Nergal's vocals are now in between his current death metal sound and the early high pitched Burzum screams. At times, like on \"Rising Proudly Towards the Sky\" his vocals are very obviously a homage to Attila. And since I like Attila's vocals, I find that Nergal's use of that sound works very well.\n\nThe main thing you could say about this release, is that while it has a minimalist heart, there is so much added stuff going on that even after listening to it many times I notice more things. Strange acoustic guitars, female vocals, riffs that turn from minimalist to complex at the turn of the hat. A beautiful fluidity marks all of this. Behemoth adds experimental touches to a sound that is based directly on fast, aggressive and atmospheric black metal. \n\nAny fan of pagan black metal must own this release, and Behemoth's first as well. Without them your collection will never be complete. Gromm is every bit a classic, it's an album that stuns me every time I put it in. Ignore what the naysayers have to say about early Behemoth, and listen to black metal fans, and you'll soon find out why Behemoth was considered one of the best black metal bands, until they cowardly changed face.\n",
        "\nProduction value is acceptable, with all instruments at equal levels for a balanced feel, but not overproduced in any way, keeping the now famous \"black metal atmosphere\" present throughout the recordings.\n\nThe album's first track starts out with a melody that is similar to, but not copying, Emperor's opening track on 'In the Nightside Eclipse\". Herein lies the beauty of this album; a keen appreciation and understanding of the aesthetic in early 90's Norwegian black metal, and being able to create an artistic piece that uses that influence without being a rip off copy. Negral is under the belief these days that this strong Norwegian influence on Behemoth's early works is, in fact, too present; a contributing factor to the change in direction he later took to better express himself in an \"original\" way and not in the way of others.\n\nThere can be some truth to such statements, but Behemoth had an uncanny skill in creating something genuine that adds to the genre. The songs here are put together too well for there to not be a true understanding of the art form. The melodies, played with distorted riffs, burn brightly over the pounding hypnosis of drumming fury, all the while the bass clearly connects the two, playing the role of intermediary. Vocals screech in established black metal form, giving the listener a feeling of familiarity now expected within these kind of song structures.\n\nSurprises include \"Ancient\", which is a piece that is what it claims to be; a nod to older, traditional, folk songs (of what origin I cannot say; Polish?).\n\nA well done album, and recommended by this reviewer to all.\n",
        "\nOkay, this album can be called the last album in Behemoth\u2019s early, Blackmetal material. I would not say that it is in classic fashion, under-produced, nor can it be called general Blackmetal, as later releases would imply. This is a fairly well-produced, melodic Death/Blackmetal with some synth in several places, although it\u2019s very low in the mix, it performs it\u2019s part well, even though I can\u2019t say I am a fan of synths in general. There are certain resemblances to the following albums, although it still retains the \u2018blacker\u2019 style of the old eras, hence the statement I began with. Anyway, onward with the music itself.\n\nThe opening track, Diableria (The Great Introduction) is basically an, well, intro track with acoustic guitars (those who\u2019ve heard Demigod, might find a small resemblance here) and chanting choirs. Actually pretty nice, although it\u2019s no track you sit down and listen to; it\u2019s not good on its own really. It definitely tries to set a bit of an epic mood, and it succeeds with this.\n\nThe second track, \u201cThe Thousand Plagues I Witness\u201d is a really great track with a brass section (synths, of course) going and really nice riffs in some places. One of the better tracks on the album, and probably the coolest song title as well. Too bad the lyrics are pretty shitty on the whole album.\n\n\u201cSatan\u2019s Sword\u201d (I have become) is the third track, it starts right off, with some random riffs, some of which sound pretty okay, but I must say I find it pretty generic. The epic is still there, especially in the outro to the song, which I think is brilliant.\n\n\u201cIn Thy Pandemaeternum\u201d is probably the worst song on the whole album, or perhaps track seven. It really doesn\u2019t stand out, there\u2019s basically just boring riffs and absolutely none of the atmosphere from the first three songs.\n\nWhen the fourth track finally ends, \u201cDriven By The Five-Winged Star\u201d starts off, with a nice guitar intro, and then goes in a fairly steady intro throughout the whole song. It\u2019s very melodic, and the latter part of the song is basically a really awesome solo. I love this song, the best one on the album in my opinion.\n\nWhen done with the really, really great track, \u201cThe Past is Like a Funeral\u201d follows this up. While it might not be good when it begins, it gets better and better into the song, then finally reaches it\u2019s climax. A great song.\n\nSadly, it all ends there, \u201cThe Entrance To The Spheres Of Mars\u201d is a really shitty song, with almost upbeat riffs. I\u2026 can\u2019t really say anything more about it, the song just plain sucks.\n\nWell, it\u2019s a fairly incoherent album, all in all, there are some good songs and some bad. The whole album is actually not that good, and even if it differs from both new and old releases of Behemoth, this isn\u2019t exactly one of the better. If you\u2019re a fan of behemoth in general, both new and old, you should try this album. It has a few good songs as mentioned. However, if you\u2019re new to Behemoth, I wouldn\u2019t recommend this. Try newer albums and some of the older ones, and then this.\n\nStand-out tracks are: \u201cThe Thousand Plagues I Witness\u201d, \u201cDriven By The Five-Winged Star\u201d and \u201cThe Past is Like a Funeral\u201d.\nRating: \n+ For the epic mood set in the first song\n+ For a few really good tracks\n- Incoherency\n- Boring mixing, some riffs are really, really bland.\n\nFinal Score: 68 %. Just too incoherent.\n",
        "\nWarning! It\u2019s taken me over a year to actually comprehend this, but \u201cDemigod\u201d is as near perfection as an album can be. Behemoth has taken the final step towards the elite within the metal genre, and in my book, they\u2019re T-H-E band to look out for.\n\nAs I\u2019m still confused over the whole progress of this band, and as I could not see this coming, their latest offering has literally put me in a trance. Rising very slowly from their (very) underproduced first albums, journeying over progression all the time with better production & more clever song-writing seems to really have paid off. Everything about this album is pretty much perfected from the beginning to the end. Whereas they developed over the years to a more talented band, here\u2019s where they took it to the next level.\n\nThe vocals seem to have changed the most, and Nergal has without a doubt put an enormous amount of thought into this department. He now whips out darker screams than ever before, and while most of it surely isn\u2019t effect-less, he\u2019s developed a whole new style to it. Everything this band plays nowadays has been sped up times two compared to older material. \u201cZos Kia Cultus\u201d (also a great album) was not the fastest album this band has created nor was it slow, but \u201cDemigod\u201d surpasses it on every level possible. The riffing, for instance, is quite more complex and thought through. More than once, my thoughts have told me Behemoth can\u2019t make things better than they really are, but I\u2019m glad to be proven wrong about that fact. Seth and Nergal make a good pair, and both deserve an equal amount of respect for this recording. They even share the solos, something I think is quite wise. How much part everyone in the band took part of the actual song-writing, I don\u2019t know, but I\u2019ve always seen Nergal as the head figure of the band.\n\nThis whole experience is quite overwhelming\u2026 Maybe not at first, but it definitely grows on you. The main reason for this is that they\u2019ve pretty much invented a whole new style. Opener \u201cSculpting the throne ov Seth\u201d bashes you instantly to the ground with its whole new concept, where the chorus introduces it fully. \u201cBefore Aeons Came\u201d & \u201cSlaves Shall Serve\u201d are the only tracks on here which they had possible been able to write for another album, as they build equally on their trademark-style as the new. The last-mentioned one is the catchiest tune on the album, and they\u2019re also releasing an E.P. under the same name as the song. \u201cDemigod\u201d (the track) features an odd, but good intro which slowly transforms into a good-as-hell song. \u201cConquer All\u201d is twice the masterpiece its contender \u201cHorns ov Baphomet\u201d (off of Zos Kia Cultus) ever was, and \u201cThe Reign of Shemsu \u2013 Hor\u201d closes the album with an absolute standpoint proving they will be back for more. Nothing wrong with the songs then, so how about the production? Refer to the score I gave this album. A whole record with bad production couldn\u2019t possibly earn 99 points, would it? Correctomundo! It all fits very well together, and they must\u2019ve used one hell of a compressor on the final mix, because it\u2019s tight as hell and really compact. All the sound levels are excellent. Need I say more?\n\nA standing ovation would be the only way to describe the drumming. \u201cInferno\u201d will almost certainly become an icon for future drummers. He plays so fast and accurately to this music that I\u2019m very surprised he\u2019s not been praised and honoured in magazines etc. where comparable drummers always are. It has probably taken a long time recording this as it is very complex, and because of the variation between drum-patterns.\n\nEnough has already been said about this splendid work of art. It is a hell of an experience and you won\u2019t be dissatisfied after a couple of listening-sessions through the best album of 2004! Crystal-clear production, masterful musicians and a hell of a ride. What are you waiting for? Buy it or steal it, whatever you can, but once you do, try to really relax and kick your feet up on the table, grab a sweatband and get ready for a pair of shit-stained pants ready to be washed, because Behemoth WILL totally make you shit your pants\u2026 and change your musical taste forever.\n",
        "\nIt became a tradition for Behemoth, as it is now for Vader, to release various EPs/Mini CDs in time between usual longplays. Started with Antichristian Phenomenon, then Conjuration and now Slaves Shall Serve (puprosely omitted Live in Touluse which was released to fill up the contract with Metal Mind) - all of those have the same history and more or less the same purpose.\n\nStudio tracks were recorded during Demigod session (as were the tracks for AP and C). The title track appeared on it and even promoted the album with a clip which you can find on this EP. To be honest I don\u2019t like the videos of Behemoth, but this one gained my attention (Nergal as a bishop!) and they are getting better and better in this issue as well. The second track is more of a forfeit for diehards, good but not good enough comparing to Demigod tracks. The Nephilim and Danzig cover are filled with Behemoth spirit and that is all to be said bout those two. Good to hear again that they like to play tracks which are completely different from their own style.\n\nAnd finally live tracks! Everybody who visited their gig knows that they are great on stage and those two tracks confirm it. I am just suprised that Nergal doesn\u2019t want to give great full live cd, Requiem was great but I still wait for the disc.\n\nAll in all short review for a short release. It might be difficult to get, but for this price I think it\u2019s worth it.\n",
        "\nAlthough consisting only of 3 songs, Bewitching The Pomerania is a pure essence of earlier Behemoth style. Definitely it\u2019s their best effort to date, very consistent, and - in my opinion - best in whole career. Not that Satanica or Zos Kia Cultus are poor albums, but they are lacking the atmosphere which can be found on the older releases, especially this one. \n\nEP kicks off with \u201cWith Spell Of Inferno\u201d. First we hear a short drum intro, then Nergal\u2019s scream comes in \u2013 just awesome, he never sounded that good. Song starts very fast, then comes some tempo changes. Keyboard are accompanying Nergal for the moment, next we can hear some trash-like riffs. Song ends up in the way it started \u2013 fast-paced, raw black metal. Fantastic one. 9/10.\n\n\u201cHidden in a fog\u201d. This is a remake of older Behemoth song, rather slow-paced. Very atmospheric one, with some acoustic work. Compared to the version from 1995, it sounds much better here, however - black-metallic rawness is still maintained. Nice, but not as good as for example \u201cGrom\u201d. 8/10.\n\n\u201cSventevith (storming near the Baltic)\u201d. Again a remake (song first appeared on \u201cAnd the Forests Dream Eternally\u201d as I remember), but this time they turned a rather typical song into a monster. Ultra-fast tempo and great opening riff just won\u2019t allow you to stop headbanging. Great bass work, great drums. Absolute Behemoth classic. 10/10.\n\nOh, I nearly forgot \u2013 this EP is the first material with Inferno on drums. This guy was totally incomparable to earlier Behemoth drummers even then, and \u2013 what may sound impossible \u2013 he improved a lot from this time, becoming one of best drummers on the extreme metal scene in my opinion.\n\nSuming up \u2013 looks like a definite must-have for black metal fan, but sadly this EP is very hard to find. If you aren\u2019t a collector I\u2019d rather recommend you to buy \u201cChaotica\u201d compilation, which includes this EP and earlier Behemoth work.\n\n//This is my first review, sorry if I did something wrong.\n",
        "\nIt's unbelieveable. After the astounding and groundbreaking \"Satanica\", they take their whole concept a step further. \"Thelema.6\" is even more technical, Nergal's voice is even more vicious and the song are better structured than ever before. As another reviewer already said, this album is totally unpredictable.\n\nThe album starts with \"Antichristian Phenomenon\" It starts out with a little audio clip which tells us that the human race is unworthy of the gift of life until the awesome main riff starts.... and when I heard it for the first time i just felt like my skull got crushed by a ten-ton hammer. It is that great. After 0:32 the song gets a lot faster and Nergal's scream leads us into the first verse. Oh damn, that shit is fast. Inferno's not only a fucking beast behind the drums, he's the best drummer I have heard, this shows it once again. The solo is wicked, rather long and sounds weird(in a good way). Nergal's playing has also evolved a lot, so has his voice. As the reviewer before me said, Novy does slap the bass and it sounds damn great. \n\n\"Act of Rebellion\".....yes, it's even faster, but without turning into a mindless blastfest. The guitar melodies in this song are very strange but still catchy as fuck. I don't know how they do it, really. There are a few second-short orchestral parts at the end of riffs, which give a great feeling to the music. The vocal part at \"2:35\" is one of the moments on the album. It's like Nergal is casting a deadly spell upon you and as soon as he stops, a beautiful solo comes in and rips your head off. As if that wasn't enough, another similar vocal parts comes in...it doesn't get much better than this. Another great solo starts as the song slowly fades out. Awesome.\n\n\"Inflamed with Rage\" has one of the greatest opening riffs I've ever heard. Nergal's screams want you to jump in and scream along with him. One of the most interesting parts in his voice is that he doesn't growl. It's like he's screaming his lungs out, but without sounding like a black metal singer. I have never heard any vocalist that sounds even remotely similar to Nergal. The song has (again) pretty weird chord progressions (like before), yet they manage to sound totally unique. \n\n\"Pan Satyros\" is totally insane. Just listen to the first 30 seconds, I won't say anymore about this part, you just have to hear it yourself. I'm sure you haven't heard anything like that before. Some of these strange riffs also appear later throughout the song. This song is less-vocal driven like it's predecessors, but it's a total headbanger. The solo is haunting, too. In some parts it remembers me a little of \"Ceremony of Shiva\" from the \"Satanica\" album. This is mainly because of the clean vocals in the background of a verse. Inferno takes my breath away with his amazing skills once again. There are a lot of blastbeats to be found, but he often fills with the gaps with hyperfast and great sounding drumfills. \n\n\"Natural Born Philosopher\" slowly fades in and takes the concept of \"Pan Satyros\" even further. Some more rather silent clean vocals fade in with the riffs and appear often throughout the song. You can hear Novy's slapping very well in this song. This song also shows how unpredictable this album is: At 2.14 the song ends...and two seconds later it starts again and turns into a total headbanging monster accompanied by great solos and the wicked clean shouts again. This is maybe one of the strangest songs on here, hell, it even fades out with an acoustic guitar and suddenly turns into full force in the last 15 seconds. Unbelieveable. The song ends with Nergal saying \"Your god is dead now\". Holy fuck, he really must be dead by now. \n\n\"Christians to the Lions\". I won't have to explain what this song is about, but I never head a problem with Antichristian lyrics. The song's ultrafast(one of the fastest on the album) and totally devastation. The short solo at 0:26 together with Nergal's scream is totally vicious. Nergal's hatred almost comes through my speakers, his vocals are that great. \n\n\"Praise the flame!\nwatch angels falling from the skies\npraise the flame!\nI killed thy god\nmy will is done!\nThou art Lord\" \n\nPriceless.\n\n\"Inauguration Of Scorpio Dome\" starts like a soundtrack to a scary videogame until it starts out with great riffs and extremely difficult drum patterns(Inferno does it easily). \"INAUGURATION OF SCORPIO DOME!\" Nergal's scream sounds so great here. After he screams it two times there's another one of these strange(but great) sounding passages. A breathtaking, but sadly rather short song. \n\nIn The Garden Of Dispersion is less experimental than it's precedessing songs and has some \"Decade of Therion\"(Satanica) moments before it turns into a great headbanging riff at 1:35! If your neck isn't already crushed yet then it will break here because it gets crushed in the same speed for almost a whole minute. The song ends in highspeed fashion and you can't help but thrashing around like a \nmaniac. \n\nYou thought that you'd have a break after the last headbanging set? No. There is no break, because we get \"The Universe Illumination\" which starts out with another headbanging set until the short(but awesome) solo comes in. Nergal's lyrics in this song are fucking great:\n\n\"ov circus my world wiseman called\nov drunken trickster bed\nand not violators of thoughts they are\nfor life is a theater\nin which actors all we are\nbut when curtain is open\nthere is no time for any reh's\" \n\nThe man is a natural born philosopher. There are also some agyptian(I think) lyrics to be found, but sadly I don't know what they mean because I can't find a decent translator. Nergal's pronounciation sounds damn great, though.\n\n\"Vinum Sabbati\" has an awesome intro and great doublebass work by Inferno. The song starts really slow compared to the others on this album and maintains in a rather midpaces tempo throughout. The clean vocals appear again, layered together with Nergal's screams. The way he pronounces \"VINUM SABBATI\" always sends a chill down my spine. One of the greatest solos can be found in this song, at about 1:40. The song has great time signatures and is a little more in the melodic vain than some others here(don't panic, no gothenburg melody). \n\n\"23 (The Youth Manifesto)\" starts out with a great tapping part and the clean shouts appear again, layered together with a deep voice talking. At 1:12 Nergal's scream comes in and he sounds so good, maybe one of his best performances on this CD. The only annoying thing here is that the song's lenght is 3:58, but only a little more than the half of it is actual music. Because there's a long fade out part which sounds like a recording in a factory. And the outro riff drags out for too long. This song could've been better, the the first two minutes are excellent, though.\n\nOverall, we have an album full of surprises and outstanding performances. Unbelievable that Behemoth has constantly kept their music on this high level. They have not disappointed once since they released Satanica.\n\nAn outstanding album from an outstanding band. \n\nSong recommendations: all of them, especially \"Antichristian Phenomenon\", \"The Act of Rebellion\", \"Inflamed with Rage\", \"Natural Born Philosopher\", \"Christians to the Lions\" and \"Vinum Sabbati\".\n",
        "\n...if he heard this one. \n\nSatanica. The Behemoth album that really turned them into the crushing machine they are today. The alienated a lot of their old fans with this one, since there's not much black metal left in it. Pandemonic Incantation already showed some hints of this new sound, but this is the album where it really started. \n\nDecade of Therion is a monster of a song. Boy, it must have been a shock for Behemoth fans! The song is ultrafast, ultraviolent and still damn catchy. \"ANO NANTOZ KAKODAIMONOZ!\" You can't sit or stand still when you hear this. You just have to scream along with Nergal, it's that catchy. \n\nOh my god, then comes L.A.M. Yes, it ie EVEN FASTER than Decade of Therion and the part where Nergal sings \"Kaos Keraunos Kybernetos\" is one of the best moments on the whole album. \n\nThe album is totally unpredictable, brutal, well-structured. From the first two ultrafast songs to the strangely progressive sounding \"Ceremony of Shiva\"(clean vocals in the background!) this is beauty. Yet, Behemoth managed to top this album with their following releases. \n\nThis is a piece of art, that turned Behemoth into one of THE bands you recognize by the first few seconds of a song. \n\nThe only problem this album has is it's length. Sadly, it's only about 35 minutes long, though the songs never get old. GET IT!\n\nBest songs: Decade of Therion, L.A.M, Ceremony Of Shiva, Chant for Eschaton 2000\n",
        "\nBehemoth is one of those few bands that evolved from pure/raw black metal to Blackened Death Metal. Many bands evolved through time but not many managed to keep the innermost aspects of their music. Behemoth accomplished this. After listening to Satanica for about 40 times i have know a pretty good idea of what this album is about. First of all the production of this record is great and gets close to that of Nile-Annhilation of The Wicked and In The Darkened Shrines. In this album we have Nergal on vocals and guitar, Inferno on drums and Orion on bass. Nergal\u2019s vocals are amazing from every single point of view. They are brutal, but not monotonous like some Death Metal vocals are. The guitar work is technical and destructive especially in the song Ceremony of Shiva. This song with LAM can give you the feeling of a huge egyptian army coming towards you. It is a feeling i have never witnessed from any song. The drumming is fast and precise and everything fits perfectly alltogether with awesome bass-work. So far i have never listened to a band that could give such brutal destruction and at the same time be so technical.\n",
        "\nI have always thought Behemoth is and was a poor death metal band that calls itself black metal, even now more than ever because of the current releases which shame black metal so much it makes you want to kill and mame! This album however, calms me. Everything has this distant feeling right from the haunting start, there is good use of acoustic on first track, really adds to the music. As the title suggests, this is a demo that is From The Pagan Vastlands!Behemoth really does some good original music on this album. None of the music on here has any influence or characteristics of being death metal, it was, believe it or not... Pure black metal of the darkest and also bleakest sort conjured up by a Polish band besides the great and well known Graveland! Not only was the music original and full of suprise, the production was good too which is very hard to believe when you first look at the cd, it has this ancient look to it that just calls to you. Id just like to say, thank you Behemoth for giving the black metal fans a really good album, but id also just like to say, what happened? Nergal had a good thing going with this demo and the first Behemoth full lengths, so why did he change paths???\n",
        "\nOne of life\u2019s greatest mysterious right alongside the great Pyramids of Egypt, the Lost City of Atlantis, and Stonehenge is the divine query of what would Lucifer/Hell/Suffering sound like if man was given the chance to witness it live. Many Death and Black Metal bands attempt to manifest such an enigma with their anti-Christian lyrics and Satan worship. Fortunately, Poland\u2019s Behemoth are not of this mold as Nergal and his cronies aspire to enlightenment and philosophy which one can readily view if they pick up the liner notes too any of their most recent albums.  This fresh and intelligent approach to metal is captured with the two live performances on this magnificently packaged DVD.\n\nI\u2019ve purchased my fair share of metal DVD\u2019s and many of them lack quality packaging and presentation (see Death\u2019s Live in LA, or Cannibal Corpse\u2019s Live Cannibalism). Crush.Fukk.Create is beautifully packaged with a slipcover DVD case and beautiful artwork. Additionally, the content is nearly as slick as the presentation. The two DVD\u2019s cover two live concerts and nearly two hours of interviews and other crazy shit as we\u2019re offered a glimpse into the personal lives of the members of Behemoth.\n\nThe first live performance is notably the better of the two and is entitled \u201cLive Pandemonium.\u201d It was filmed at the Party San Festival in 2003, which means it features several cuts off of Zos Kia Cultus-which most would agree is the best Death Metal album these guys have put out. Their performance at the fest occurred at night and allows us to view the aural carnage in a deep and foreboding atmosphere adding to the overall effect of the show. As soon as the band rips into the first song (Antichristian Phenomenon) the crowd gets into it thrashing about and banging their heads as flames erupt at the corners of the stage making it hard for the viewer at home not to do the same. The sound quality is above average on this performance and one can relatively clearly make out each and every instrument. Even if there were audio issues they would readily be dismissed once one experiences how tight and clean Behemoth\u2019s performance is. The guitars shred and rip through the air intermingling with the thumping of the bass, all supported by the amazing work of Inferno behind the kit. It is particularly satisfying seeing Inferno pound away at the skins as one can\u2019t help but wonder how he achieves such speed on those triggered bass drums. Nergal\u2019s vocal performance is also well for the most part, although in several instances it becomes hard to hear him (these moments are short and few however). The most gratifying part of this performance to me was being able to hear the killer material off of Zos Kia Cultus performed live. As Above So Below is absolutely my favorite song from Behemoth\u2019s material (barring their Black Metal records which are superior in the eyes of this reviewer) and is performed flawlessly. Truly a rush to see these guys jump out at you and tear at your throat, hungry for blood.\n\n\nThe second performance is taken from the Mystic Festival in 2001 and is entitled \u201cMother Khaoz on Stage.\u201d The title suits it well enough as we are treated to more of the same. The performance is relatively identical to that at the Party San Festival barring the newer material from Zos Kia Cultus. Most of the songs will have already been viewed in the earlier (sic) concert so it can become quite redundant if all viewed at once. This concert does differentiate itself first and foremost from the previous concert as it is held during the daytime. Not a big difference but it does change the atmosphere, albeit it slightly. The quality is on par also and no noticeable difference in sound or video. I do not have nearly as much to say about this show as the tracks hit me as slightly repetitive and featured their weaker material (still strong compared to other DM bands though). \n\nOk, so you finished watching two spectacular live performances and spent a good hour and a half thrashing about and just listening to good quality metal when you put in the bonus material on the second disc. I for one would have liked to view some behind the scenes footage as well as a couple serious interviews concerning Behemoth\u2019s inspiration and what they\u2019ve set out to accomplish with their career. I certainly was not expecting to view three guys with their dicks\u2019 whipped out pissing on car windows and people piss-ass drunk acting like idiots. Given, there was a warning on the DVD case about the bonus material, but I still was not prepared to view such worthless and stupid material. It came across as a complete waste of an hour as I fast-forwarded through half of the scenes. Completely disappointing and ultimately lowering my image of Behemoth as a whole. The reason I could conceive why they would even include such footage would be to show their lighter side and that they do have a lot of fun on and off the stage, but that hardly came across upon first viewing. I have to admit the experience was overall very similar to a certain Heavy Metal icon\u2019s utterly embarrassing reality show were he dethroned himself as the Prince of Darkness in my eyes.\n\nIn the end I would recommend this DVD as the live performances, particularly the first, are essential to any Behemoth fan. The second disc did inflict some damage to this viewer and hence a point deduction. I would suggest viewing the second disc with caution and perhaps just once to satisfy curiosity, I however will refrain from placing it back into my DVD player.\n",
        "\nWell ladies and gentlemen, here\u2019s another overrated release. I get really sick of people making a mountain out of a molehill, and I\u2019m afraid the same thing is going to happen to Behemoth. Too many good bands are getting more credit they deserve, by no means am I saying that Demigod is a terrible CD. I\u2019m just saying that if people paid a little less attention to the metal major players (Cannibal Corpse, Nile, Slayer, Cryptopsy, Dimmu Borgir, not that there is anything wrong with those bands) we might have a little more variety with underground bands getting a decent chance at the spotlight. Behemoth is becoming one of those bands that stay the exact same (now that they have settled into their \u201cZos Kia Cultus\u201d sound), but their reviews get better and better. No band should get better and better reviews for staying the same, and that statement is directed toward anyone who listens to Fear Factory (despite their two or three nu-metal songs on Digimortal), Norther, and Lamb of God! \n\nNow, on with the actual CD. Don\u2019t misunderstand me, Demigod was great, but the hype surrounding it is disgusting. Much like the hype surrounding Edguy, but that is all Tobias Sammet\u2019s fault, so I don\u2019t really blame any of their fans. Things really started picking up for Behemoth after the release of Satanica which was their departure from their original pure Black Metal sound. If you don\u2019t like the underground, Black Metal isn\u2019t for you! And I guess the underground wasn\u2019t for Behemoth either, despite the fact that most (if not all) fans of their Tr00 Black Metal sound still like them to present. Nevertheless, they have changed into something quite special. That change being the use of musical scales affiliated with the middle-eastern world (specifically Egypt) and lyrics regarding civilizations predating the Ancient Egyptians (hence; Shemsu-Hor). It is correct for one to compare this band to Nile, especially now with Karl Sanders\u2019 guest Guitar appearance at the end of the song \u201cXul\u201d! But in all honesty, his appearance wasn\u2019t really required, both Nergal and Sanders seem to be on the same page when soloing together so you can\u2019t really determine which one is which. However, the biggest improvement they have made since Zos Kia Cultus is the percussion. About thirty seconds into the first song I was almost ripping apart the liner notes to see who the new Drummer was, only to find it was the same guy they\u2019ve had since their previous release! So I must congratulate Infernos excellent technical skills on this album!\n\nThe entire album is quite consistent and no songs feel out of place or inappropriate with the rest of the CD (which enhances the Epic sensations one gets from it), so there aren\u2019t too many that stand out either. But if I had to choose I would say \u201cConquer All\u201d due to its beautifully melodic solo performed by Nergal, \u201cSlaves Shall Serve\u201d because of its torrid pace and brutality, and finally \u201cThe Reign of Shemsu-Hor\u201d because of its Epic qualities, that are, in my opinion, more repetitive than Epic (even though the song has some very memorable moments; mainly the chorus). Nergal\u2019s new Bassist who has taken Novy\u2019s place in the band (Novy was the Bassist on Zos Kia Cultus but was not an official member, only a guest musician), suits the band just fine. Typically, he doesn\u2019t receive too much spotlight much like most Bassists, so all that can be said about him is that he is a decent player because Demigod is Behemoth\u2019s most technical release, and they didn\u2019t fumble once! All of Behemoth\u2019s riffs are derived from Egyptian (and similar areas of the world) scales, and therefore arouse a real sense of cognitive superiority over most Metal bands these days. The riffs are also massive, tormenting and exhausting. Their Guitars sound very similar to Decapitated\u2019s Guitars on \u201cThe Negation\u201d. The main difference being, that Nergal\u2019s riffs and patterns are less repetitive and far more exotic and colorful Than Decapitated\u2019s riffs (that do eventually become monotonous). Which is an accurate analogy because both Behemoth and Decapitated are from Poland. \n\nHowever, Demigod does have a rather unfortunate downside, which is that the album as a whole doesn\u2019t get too fast. It\u2019s as heavy as hell, but the lack of speed drags its credibility through the mud. Much of the reason I consider \u201cSlaves Shall Serve\u201d as one of the best songs on the CD is because it is, in fact, the only song that is satisfyingly fast. Secondly, Nergal\u2019s vocals on Demigod were actually pretty cool, despite what others might say, but my initial problem with it is that many times it overpowers the rest of the music. Sometimes his scream/growls (or bellows) are overwhelming, you can\u2019t even distinguish how the riffs go. The rhythm isn\u2019t lost, though. The percussion on this album was not overproduced \u2013 but fairly loud compared to the rest of the elements. \n\nOverall, this is one hell of a Metal album! One or two more fast songs would have gotten them a perfect score, but no biggy! For Behemoth fans, this album will arouse immediate orgasms. For me, it just plain kicked ass. So get used to a more accurate and more melodic Behemoth; I expect nothing but good things from them in the future. Just don\u2019t make mountain out of a molehill.\n",
        "\nOh...my...fucking...god. This CD (bought straight from them at their recent Houston appearance) will annihilate anything and everything in its path. And I do mean anything, it is that industrial strength badass. It has everything you could ever want from a modern death metal CD and then some; the intelligent, occult-based lyrics are a nice bonus given that our man Nergal is very, very serious about his craft. The music is top-notch to the extreme, tight as a duck's arse, impeccably produced, and delivered with every ounce of conviction in their bodies and souls from start to finish, and did I mention it is the most relentless and brutal CD yet from these Polish warriors of modern death? \n\nAfter getting a good up-close view of Inferno playing live I have even more respect for the man, because his playing on this album is positively inhuman in its precision and intensity. I can imagine his legs pounding madly throughout every song as he mercilessly batters his drums into so much wood pulp. His overly-triggered drum sound is the one thing I don't like about this CD, one reason there were points deleted. His frenzied blasting really powers this album up into a juggernaut of unstoppable speed and power, but his blast beats are *so* fast at times that the music has a weird floating feel to it, another reason I deleted a couple points from the score. But that aside, the man deserves props for helping take the music to the next level as well as he does.\n\nNergal's vocals are downright frightening on this CD! His voice has gotten noticeably deeper and uglier, and his vocals will make poseurs everywhere fill their pants in terror! Screaming and roaring his occult message to the world, his is a most intense and comitted vocal performance. Even better than Steve Tucker's performance on \"Gateways To Annihilation\", on a par with David Vincent's greatest moments, he is. His playing has gotten even better, the riffs, harmonies, melodies and soloing reek of confidence. Seth gives a good account of himself too in that department with his acoustic playing and not inconsiderable lead prowess, and Orion's bass guitar is ballsy and deep, anchoring it all with effortless ease. The band sounds unified and awe-inspiring, more than they possibly ever have in the past.\n\nStandouts? Try \"Sculpting the Throne ov Set\", the title track with its military-sounding intro, \"Xul\" (with emotional guest lead guitar from some guy named Karl Sanders from a little band called Nile you may have heard of), and \"Slaves Shall Serve\" with its eerie vocal sounds in the beginning that put \"Demon of the Fall\" to shame and easily *the* most violent and aggressive three minutes and change you'll hear so far this year. \"SLAVES! SHALL!! FUCKING SERVE!!!\" \n\nBehemoth have well and truly arrived, make no error there. And if they come to your town, go see them and see what I'm talking about, because they also happen to be a stellar live band! This is their best album yet, IMO, and I am so glad they are hitting their stride with such authority and power unrivaled by most bands in the field. Give 'em your hard-earned dosh, they have earned it and then some with this CD.\n",
        "\nIt is hard to imagine and believe, that one of the most prolific and well known DM band of this decade, started out as a necro black metal outfit...but sometimes along comes a band with such terrifying songwriting that its impossible to deny. Such is the case of this mighty Polonian band. This album represents the starts of what will become in my opinion the road towards becoming the owners of the throne of death/black (title that used to belong to Dissection). The humble begginings of Behemoth are nothing compared to what they are now. Here we have an almost mediocre album, if we dont take into account the folk influences that actually makes this album worth buying. I will say this sounds like all thoses demos from black metal bands from mid 90s. aside from the aforementioned folkish atmosphere. As far as the evolution process is concerned, no trace of this album can be found on what Behemoth is today. I am just glad they still embrace songs from this album (\"From the Pagan Vastlands\"). Simply putted this album is worth looking, if you are after all a fan of the band. Black metal fans, i think can actually skip this...as it shows nothing new to the scene, but bear in my mind, that the songwriting of Behemoth are still present here, so this is by no means a piece of shit. For Behemoth and curious fans only...\n",
        "\nOkay, let's get one thing straight. Progression sucks. Most bands have this awful habit of starting out good and gradually declining as they begin favouring experimentation over solid songwriting. However, occasionally a band will progress far beyond their humble beginnings and manage to hold the spark which made them great to begin with. Such is the case with Behemoth. \nTheir early output was midpaced pagan black metal, with typically \nraw production and an enormous, overpowering atmosphere. Their early output, particularly the first EP \"And The Forests Dream Eternally\"\nand the album-length demo \"From The Pagan Vastlands\" are timeless classics which helped define second-wave black metal as a whole, and will forever remain their best efforts. However, since the transitional \"Grom\" and \"Pandemonic Incantations\", Behemoth's sound has steadily moved toward a much faster, more brutal form of intense death metal. Demigod is essentially the pinnacle of this evolution, abandoning all black metal aesthetics in favour of swirling, blasting insanity interspersed with melodic genius.\n\nThe opening acoustics of \"Sculpting The Throne Ov Seth\" is a deceptive beginning, before Inferno's trademark blastbeats take over and push the intensity levels straight into the red. The guitars here are a fluid, groove-ridden onslaught of massive proportions, shot through with amazing harmonized lead work and a crushing bass undertow. Over all this, Nergal's demonic vocal exhortations summon a legion of demons to rip your face off. They're louder here than they've ever been, but not so loud that they overpower the music. The mix is perfectly balanced and meticulously controlled. No wonder they took so long to record this, for it's as much a work of studio wizardry as it is of songwriting genius.\n\nLyrically, the Crowleyan themes continue to hold court. The scepter on the brilliant cover art gives away the game quite effectively, quoting Crowley's well-known epithet - \"Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law - Love is the law - Love Under Will\". Each lyric is accompanied by a quick explanation in the booklet, which is a good thing since the esoteric writing is often quite difficult to comprehend. \n\nI seriously need to mention again the brilliance of the guitar work here. Words are insufficient to describe how much some of those solo's make my musical senses glow with their mastery. This is an album which never grows old - no matter how much you spin it, it continues to impress with it's inherent complexity and innovation. Behemoth have gone from being one of the best\nblack metal bands ever to possibly the best death metal currently active. No mean feat by any stretch - do yourself a favour and pick up this masterwork of metallic majesty.\n",
        "\nSatanica is the first Behemoth release into their current blackened death style. After the failed experiment of Grom and forgotten Pandemonic Incantations, Behemoth decided to go for a more \u201ccommercial\u201d sound, thus Satanica has no black metal elements in it like that of previous Behemoth releases. What has replaced those elements is what defines Behemoth as a band today, very fast technical drumming, heavy and brutal guitar riffs, and deep choppy vocals via Nergal. Although Satanica alienated most of Behemoth\u2019s older fans, what they produce with Satanica is something much more complex and enjoyable than that of pre Grom era Behemoth.\n\nThe best description of Satanica would be a less heavy and aggressive version of Thelma.6 or a less complex version of Zos Kia Kultus. Its full of your trademark Behemoth style blackened death metal. Decade of Therion displays what Satanica, and Behemoth, do best, combining technical drumming and heavy aggressive guitars and make them sound like one instrument, while having Nergal add vocals that fit the rhythm perfectly. Its moments like these that make Behemoth\u2019s music stand out on Satanica, where all the various elements, drumming, guitar work, vocals, and bass all come together to produce one distinguished sound (somewhat like Blizzard Beasts by Immortal). Another stand out moment on this album is on Ceremony Of Shiva where the guitar style breaks from a heavy and aggressive to a melodic rhythm which is complimented by Nergal placing his vocals to work with the technical and choppy drumming. This makes the song have rhythm but not sound weak or boring like melodic death metal by still maintaining the aggressive and heavy elements of the drums and vocals. Starspawn and The Alchemist\u2019s dream also so this well.\n\nWhile Satanica is filled with many great moments on each song that are all great sounding, a lot of this album sounds to repetitious and trite/boring. On Ceremony Of Shiva, all that is before and after the melodic guitar solo is nothing special and doesn\u2019t do all that much to compliment the song. After the Intro to Chant For Eschaton 2000 which is progressive, technical and one of the best sounding moments of the album, the song runs out of inspiration and produces boring death metal until it reuses the intro again. Many of songs on this album do that as well, have one standout segment, then slam the song into a brick wall destroying all that it had going. This breaks up the flow and replay of Satanica greatly. Although Satanica is filled with many great elements and about one or two great moments per each song, the lack of consistency and flow make this album easy to forget. With Thelma.6 and Zos Kia Kultus that take the formula of Satanica and get it right, there is little reason to listen to this album. In its own Satanica is not a bad album by any means, it just falls short of that good/memorable line and ends up being somewhere between average/good (if you\u2019re a big fan of Behemoth) or forgettable/average if you\u2019re just a casual fan of the band.\n",
        "\nBehemoth is a band that has changed drastically from \u201ctrue\u201d black metal, to a fusion of blackened death metal. Grom is a middle point between their black metal roots, and their newer era material Zos Kia Kultus and Demigod. While Grom does a good job with several elements like fast aggressive drumming and harsh aggressive vocals, it also has several elements that are very out of place. Elements like female vocals, clean vocals, and long bridges which seem to progress towards nothing. With many things going on in this album, it presents a challenge to listeners. Who will like this album? Will it appeal more to death metal listeners? Black Metal fans? Or the general Metal enthusiast? Perhaps all?\n\nGrom starts out with your typical intro that many black metal bands may do, or metal bands in general. Its nothing special, in fact it becomes repetitive and trite after forty seconds or so in its simplicity. Generally the goal of such intros is to set a tone or progression that leads into something more powerful, which this does, so mission accomplished. The intro leads into some of the fastest drumming I have heard from Behemoth on the second song of the album The Dark Forest (Cast Me Your Spell) . Equally as heavy as the acclaimed Zos Kia Kultus and Thelma 6, but significantly faster. Its similar to that of Heaven Shall Burn era Marduk. Its quite fast and aggressive with a lot of changes which keep it as the center of focus along with the riff. With all the variations of the drumming there Is a lot to pay attention to, this is not something typical for black metal, since a lot of black metal bands consider drumming to be just there, the riff makes the grim feel to it. Other examples of fast, aggressive, complex, and ever changing drumming are found on other tracks like Thou Shalt Forever Win. Of all the elements of Grom, the drumming strikes me as the best, most interesting, and complex. I feel the drumming and composition of the drumming will appeal to all metal fans alike, what metal head doesn\u2019t like fast and aggressive drumming with many different interesting things going on?\n\nAnyone familiar with Behemoth\u2019s earlier works (The Forest Dreams Eternally to \u2026From The Pagan Vastlands) knows well that they started out as \u201ctrue\u201d black metal. As time evolved they turned their sounds into that of blackened death metal with focuses on progression. By the release of Grom Behemoth lost many of their black metal roots or changed them to a fusion of black and death. This goes for all except the vocals. Nergal sings on Grom with harsh and screeching vocals that remind me of Darkthrone\u2019s of sorts. They are not as deep as on Behemoth\u2019s later works, but I feel are much better. They are more brutal, and fit the music much better by adding more of an atmosphere. The harsher higher pitched vocal singing from Nergal works well because he can drag out his singing longer which goes well with the constant drumming and guitar work on this album. On Behemoth\u2019s most recent works the music is choppy and broken up, which lends to a choppy, deeper, and less harsh style of singing. That style of singing I feel is weaker and lacks the power and atmosphere that Nergal Creates with his vocals on Grom. This vocal style will appeal to Black Metal fans more than anyone else.\n\nThere are parts of this album a metal head would love, where a black metal fan would hate. When an album tries to do too many things it alienates certain demographics of listeners, example (black metal fans, death metal fans, prog fans). What Grom tries to do to much of is incorporate elements foreign to that of straight forward aggressive black metal. This is not to say that other black metal bands haven\u2019t used acoustic guitars, synths, female vocals, clean vocals, this is saying that they are used horribly here to the point where they ruin the flow of the album and make some tracks unlistenable to. On The Dark Forest (Cast Me Your Spell) the song starts off great, aggressive and interesting drumming, grim and relentless riffs, all that you expect from a good black metal album. Then the song crashes, a slow picking acoustic guitar will start to play which breaks the flow of the song as well as the small atmosphere that it was creating. To further exacerbate the disruption to the flow and consistency of the song, clean male vocals followed by mediocre female vocals drone on for too long over slow and boring drumming. Finally burying the song is an out of place guitar solo that is washed out and slow, making the song almost sounds like guitar rock. This break in consistency coupled with bad elements such as clean vocals and a horrible guitar solo completely destroy any enjoyably obtained by the intro track and the music from the beginning of the song. \n\nThe songs following are all quite good, except for a very repetitive length of Spellcraft And Heathendom. Nergal says the same thing to much over and over again, and makes his vocals seem less harsh and more screaming. Other such moments which are a turn off or less than par are the week ending to the otherwise strong song Lasy Pomorza. Lasy Pomorza is full of aggressive and fast drumming, grim and raw guitar riffs, and dark, harsh vocals. Making it full of atmosphere and aggressive to head bang to. With such a strong premise set up, the ending just doesn\u2019t do the song justice, thus breaking the consistency once again. Rising Proudly Towards The Sky basically repeats the errors of On The Dark Forest (cast Me Your Spell). Out of place clean vocals is what plaques that particular song the worst. Despite several moments of Grom that destroy the consistency of the album and take away from its most redeeming moments, it still manages to present a worthy listen. I often found myself banging my head to some aggressive, brutal drumming as sell as noticing myself getting into the rhythm of some of the guitar work while admiring the desolate screeching harsh vocals of Nergal.\n\n\nThis album attempts to be many things, early 90\u2019s black metal, blackened progressive metal, death metal, and a fusion of a few of these genres. Unfortunately this hurts this album. Grom attempts to do to many musical styles and incorporate to many musical elements into its music it loses its identity. With all the break in consistency that resemble nothing of previously established black metal, or anything that is recognizable as black metal, Grom fails to be black metal. The album fails to be death metal since the vocals are (when sung by Nergal) clearly black metal. Many people will say labeling a band or album in a genre is unnecessary, just enjoy the music created. Well for Grom\u2019s case, having no identity hurts this album greatly. Through out the entire album Grom tries to find what it is, and fails by trying to be to much. Thus this makes the listener have a difficult time trying to enjoy the album a certain way. Black metal fans will be looking for the atmosphere and aggression, which is to be found with the vocals, drums, and guitars, but as stated before, these moments are shattered by inconsistency. The progressive metal fans will be turned off by the black metal vocals. This album will only find a home in the hearts of the general metal enthusiast while it isolates the listeners of specific genre\u2019s. Ergo this review being done by a black metal fan, I found the album to inconsistent and not powerful enough to listen to, the atmosphere created was weak and broken to much. Perhaps someone who is into heavy metal and death metal will like it more. Over all an average album, not good, but not horrible.\n",
        "\nThis album is incredible. When I first heard this, I was actually disappointed. It didn\u2019t appeal to me whatsoever. But when you sit down at actually listen to it intently a couple times, you will have a complete change of mind.\nBehemoth play a combination of death and black metal, which is very nice. It has a very heavy, satanic feel to it, but with that hint of melody that keeps it entertaining.\nFirst, as always, the guitar/production. This CD has an incredible sound to it. Everything is very well-rounded, but the vocals are slightly louder. The guitar, as I mentioned before, is fast, brutal, satanic, and has a touch of melody. They put notes together so it sounds awkwards in an evil, yet awesome way. \nThe vox can be described very simply. Fucking insane. Nergal screams in a mid-gutteral tone, but sometimes breaks a very low brutal growl. He also lets loose a very distorted and twisted growl once in a while, and just at the right times, like at the beginning of a riff.\nFinally, the percussion is outstanding. There aren\u2019t really any tempo changes as far as I can remember, but the beats change a lot and are very precise. A nice amount of blast beats, and a lot of fast double bass with some fucked up yet awesome gallops added to the mix.\nThis is a well done album by the Polish DM band Behemoth, filled with satanic brutality that you should definitely check out.\n",
        "\nThis demo is now available on vinyl (pictured on this site) and includes some extra tracks from the years after it was done. This is Behemoth\u2019s first demo I believe, \u201cEndless Damnation\u201d postdating it slightly and eventually landing them some sort of a contract for future releases. My first impression was that of amateurish guitar noise made to sound what Black Metal was meant to sound like in their minds\u2026A young band trying to align themselves firmly within the genre. I sometimes wish new bands these days would still try to sound like this \u2013 most try to become complex from the word go and sound lame and watery as a result. There is no real anger or though behind it, just childish fantasies. This band had a reason to be angry \u2013 their country recently liberated from the Soviet yoke torn apart by internal forces grasping for power over a population gripped by Christian fervour. Today Poland is reputed to have one of the highest rates of church attendance, no small wonder then that it spawned some of the most heinous and fundamentalist Metal in the history of Metal. The town they came from was a drab industrial wasteland.\n\nThe demo may sound primitive and half-baked \u2013 but look at the date \u2013 1992. This is the band that apparently inspired Graveland and hell knows how many others. The songs are short and to the point. There is a dissonant, thinly applied and very trebly layer of guitar, no bass that I can hear and subdued, plodding drums. Two were later re-recorded \u2013 the first appears on \u201cFrom the Pagan Vastlands\u201d the second is here, taped during the Sventevith sessions. Hearing those makes one realise that at this point the band had good ideas but did not know how to build them up to a satisfactory climax. Thus \u201cSummoning Of The Ancient Gods\u201d shifts from riff to riff, without taking adavantage of the great mood changes therein, and \u201cDark Triumph\u201d simply doesn\u2019t sound as evil. \u201cRise Of The Blackstorm Of Evil\u201c was apparently a Hellhammeresque filler song the band jammed for the demo. I haven\u2019t heard it used elsewhere. The cover of \u201cAgressor\u201d reaffirms their love for Hellhammer with a faithful, guitar static-haunted rendition. The two re-recordings are great to hear, especially because they are unavailable commonly unless you got the box-set.\n\nOverall this is a collector\u2019s item (and there are some fucking typos on the back too), but it\u2019s good to hear this demo. While it only hints at the ambience of \u201c\u2026From the Pagan Vastlands\u201d the raw fury of \u201c\u2026Forests\u201d or the medieval magnificence of \u201cSventevith\u201d it is a piece of Black Metal history.\n",
        "\nBehemoth have always been a great band, some people prefer the new Extreme Death Metal they play, others prefer the Black Metal band they were before. Honestly I prefer the Black Metal they did back then.\n\nSo stop the crap and write the review you may be thinking so here I go: Is it a good album? Hell yeah it is. The album was recorded in 1994 and honestly it's sounds like something really fresh even nowadays.\n\nThe first thing you'll notice is the use of a lot of acoustic guitars, I really like how they use them in the songs: they play fast and agressive black metal in the back but upfront you can hear some beautiful melodies played by acoustic guitars (The Chant from the Eastern Lands, Entering the Faustian Soul), something that's quite original honestly, also you can hear some nice keyboards that in the case of most songs they do more of an atmospheric arrangement than complicated keyboard runs and stuff although they carry the melody on some parts. As for the voice Nergal uses a kind of shriek that fits the music quite well. The drums in the record are OK ; nothing special there, not bad, not excellent, just some average drumming throughout the record, although I must say Baal Ravenlock does some nice fills and patterns in songs like The Chant from the Eastern Lands (which is one of my songs in the album).\n\nThe record is quite stable as all songs are OK and I don't feel there are any fillers on it, also it's worth mentioning that there are some tracks that are only interludes like The Touch of Nya which is two acoustic guitar piece that sounds really mystical, it has a kind ov Mediterranean feel that sounds really cool and also Ancient which is a synth piece that sounds really mystical too; this interludes are great because they help to keep the record varied and different.\n\nAll in all a very original and tight Black Metal album, if you like the new Behemoth don't expect the same band here, if you like Black Metal don't hesitate. Solid release from these guys ov Poland.\n",
        "\nAmazing. Simply Amazing! This is a death metal masterpiece. This is one of the heaviest albums i've heard to date, and alot of the heaviness is due to the tone of the guitars. They are crushingly heavy and the bass drums don't have that wussy clicky sound. They have enough punch to break through a brick wall. Nergal's vocals are really intense, not your typical deeper than hell death grunting but more like deep, slightly raspy growls. Behemoth's musicianship is incredible, maintaining bone crushing heaviness with melody and intricate rhythms. And speaking of rhythm, the use of stop-and-go riffs really get your head banging. Each song is memorable and stand out. Very little excessive repitition going on here. Also, i can't stress how intelligent this band is. They're lyrics are so well written and cover themes of antichristianity, mythology and the occult. It's very obvious they know their stuff. Also, the cover artwork is incredible. Most notable tracks would be Typhonian Soul Zodiac, As Above So Below, and Natural Born Philosopher. Zos Kia Cultus is a must buy.\n",
        "\nHow i wish Behemoth were still like this. Good old black metal, no fancy ideas about progression or whatever, just a cold and grim atmosphere that chills you to the bone. \nI can't say i'm a fan of modern day Behemoth - when BM bands go DM it usually ends up as a diluted take on DM, often coming second place to \"proper\" DM bands due to some kind of crossover mentality. How else can i describe this phenomenon? I'm a purist i guess.\nAnyway, This EP is worth it for \"Pure Evil And Hate\" alone, it says something in the sleeve notes about being a tribute to Bathory and defianately has that feel to it (first 3 albums Bathory that is). This is one of my favourite songs of all time and a classic piece of raw Black Metal - a real headbanger, full speed ahead! The other songs are great and will be adored by the old school BM fan who is into the early 90s stuff from northern Europe.\n",
        "\nThis is definatly a different style of behemoth that we have today. First of all its not death metal, its black metal. The music is no where near as heavy as their work today, the vocals sound total different, and the overall structure of the songs is different. I am not saying these are bad or good things, just describing the ep.\n\nThe music is slower, atmospheric black metal. The vocals are harsh, but not that deep, they get kinda annoying after awhile. There are some harsh guitars throughout most of the music. The drums and bass remain pretty calm throughout this ep. The band uses alot of keyboards on this release as well, which I find are the best parts of this release. There is nothing really special going on here, this was release before Behemoth started to get good, then great. The band just seems to play generic black metal on this release, nothing great is offered. I find it rather boring...in part because the production isn't all that great. \n\nI much like what Behemoth is today, but hey every band has to start somewhere. I just leave this album at Behemoth trying to get their sound noticed. Don't waste time on this ep, its not all that great, its not horrible, but with so much better stuff out there, this ep is quite useless. I give points for well played instruments, but take off for quality and lack of interesting material.\n",
        "\nBehemoth's early material really doesn't do it for me--not enough musical ability or identity. But all of a sudden, with this tremendous release, they broke the mold of the past forever and really tore into the scene proper with this awesomely focused and lethal album. \n\nNaturally, the drums are triggered to hell and back, but Inferno's insane pounding (reference the fear-inducing beginning of \"Lam\" for the way blast beats ought to be) really lets you know that this is not only a whole new band, but a real band with real players. Nergal's homicidal scream/growl vocals really suit his lyrics, with a strong theme of anti-religion running through them, and his guitar playing took a quantum leap ahead in terms of quality and ability. His riffs are strong and solid, cleanly played, and catchy in that they are well-structured and carefully arranged. Of course, this is death/black metal, so you can't expect pop melodies; these songs are catchy because you can discern the riffs and hear what's going on perfectly. \n\nFor your best tunes, I suggest \"Decade of Therion\" for a ball-busting starter, going into \"Lam\", and the more progressive tendencies of \"The Alchemist's Dream\" and \"Ceremony of Shiva\". And then the best tune on the album, the last one, \"Chant for Eschaton 2000\", an ominous Morbid Angel-sounding number that builds from an eerie guitar intro (the riff of which recurs throughout the song) into a midpaced cruncher full of dark anger as Nergal snarls out his anti-Christian message through lyrics full of poetic allegory. Beautiful, and it went down a storm when I saw them live last year here in Houston, when they ended their set with it! Altogether an essential modern death metal album that takes the best of both worlds (death and black metal) and makes a sound all their own that is unstoppable. Get this one!!!\n",
        "\nThis is such an interesting album. There are so many awesome things about it. First of all, the cover art is absolutely godly. I'm not sure what deity that is with four arms and a goathead, but it evokes fear and wonder in me. Even the band's logo is a bit frightening.\n\nSecond of all, in the liner notes, Nergal explains the lyrical inspiration behind almost all if not all the songs on the album and he goes on little tangents about certain philosophical beliefs, the history of them, relics, and on and on and on. This guy, and the band in general, is so intelligent and heavily questions the world around him. I find it especially interesting when he denounces Christianity. I'm not atheist or satanist and I'm not telling people not to believe it, but I respect artists that will openly express their views on it, especially in their own CD slipcase.\n\nPerhaps the most impressive attribute of this album is the music, of course. I just got done reviewing Immolation's latest album Unholy Cult, in which I proclaimed it to be \"A necksnapping nightmare\", but after sitting through this monster, I'd have to say that headbanging to this may very well cause an aneurysm, whereas Unholy Cult would probably just cause a very sore neck. Pretty much every song on here, with the blatant exception of As Above, So Below(which is very cool in its own right)is just totally annihiliating. Pummelling blastbeats, incredibly strong death/black vocals, thick/crushing guitars similar to that of Nile(in fact, this album heavily reminds me of Nile because I sense a very exotic, unconventional theme to this music, although I sense that it has more of a Sumerian atmosphere than Egyptian), and just an overall engrossing atmosphere prevails on this album.\n\nI've been wondering whether it would be practical(and safe) to headbang to this. Well, almost every song is so damned fast that I end up violently bobbing my head to the music rather than headbanging. I usually associate headbanging with mid-tempo metal, including some thrash, but I look like I'm having a fucking seizure trying to headbang to this. Somebody please teach me another method of headbanging, because I just CAN'T sit still while listening to Zos Kia Cultus and I don't want to damage my neck too badly. Haha. \n\nA lot of people I know have heard bands like Behemoth who have very harsh vocals and they automatically assume that the band are a bunch of devil worshippers and say \"Man, you can't even understand what the guy is saying\". I'm sorry, but I have a hard time understanding rap and even bubblegum pop sometimes too, but does that mean that the whole purpose of the song is devoid now, just because I just can't fucking understand some words here and there? NO. Harsh vocals in this style of metal are existent for a reason...to show aggression and to help supplement the dark atmosphere of the music. I dare you to invite Justin Timberlake to take the place of Nergal. That's right, all you teenyboppers of the world who happen to run across 'underground' music and totally brush it off...if you don't like the vocals, just replace them with your favorite stars of the moment. I'm sure the music will make a whole lot of sense. \n\nSure, some bands are blatantly satanic, but people don't take time to read into these bands. Often, there is much more than meets the eye. From reading the liner notes and listening to the unbridled fury of the music on this album, the listener can see that he or she that is dealing with a band that is tired of the corporate bullshit and has many interesting things to share with the world. One can tell that Behemoth and similar bands just aren't shallow enough to be on the radio talking about their recent breakup or how they like the way that girl dances across the room, etc.\n\nHeh, forgive me, I got a little ahead of myself, but since broadening my horizons into the very controversial world of death metal and reading the liner notes to this album, I felt very compelled to shed light on the many fallacies attached to this genre of metal, and show that there are more death metal and black metal bands out there who aren't explicitly blasphemic. I just realized that Satanism is something privy to Behemoth, but respect has to be given to them for having a very open, solid belief system that governs their music. Anyway, I'm pretty sure the music isn't in praise of Satan necessarily. I just think Satanism is a recurring theme. If more controversial bands would just explain how they operate mentally in their CD slipcases and such, death metal, black metal, and many other controversial forms of music would be more popular and tolerable,etc.This album is just a work of art. Highly recommended.\n",
        "\nI don't know a lot about Behemoth, I only have this album and a few mp3's from their new stuff. I can see they have changed a lot, but I really don't care. Now, let's get to this album.\nThe first song; \"From The Hornedland To Lindisfarne\" begins with a few classical guitar chords, while the rest of the music begins to show up, in an \"in crescendo\" way, this is a great idea, and it was executed with a lot of class, I must say. We can also find a few keyboard passages here and there, but they are not exactly memorable. The song itself is very \"second wave of black metal\", a little bit slower than your average black metal tune.\nFor the second song, \"Thy Winter Kingdom\", we have more \"second wave of black metal\", with a very interesting and nicely played guitar harmony around 2:41. It could be a little bit more dynamic, but there's nothing wrong with it per se.\nThe third song is solid, nothing wrong with it, but it's not fantastic either...the rest of the songs are pretty much the same, everything is solid, but not outstanding. Vocals are very functional, they won't annoy the listener, most riffs are actually very nice. \u00dcber-br00tal blast beats are nowhere to be found (that can't be bad). A few more keyboards here and there, a Mayhem cover (\"Deathcrush\"), and that's how the album ends.\nOverall, this album is worth owning, or at least downloading/copying from someone, it could be more dynamic, but considering what Behemoth are doing now, you just can't complain too much about this album; and you'll find yourself cranking it at least once a week.\n",
        "\nThis album is one of the best i have bought in the death/black metal field.\nThe horns ov Baphomet is a good and dynamic track, at beggining the riffs and the drums being a little bit slow, but later it starts the skull beating that we love so much.\nNergal has a powerful voice, giving a lot of energy and feeling to the music. He has that growling voice that makes you feel the salive boiling in his throat.\nThe drums (oh, the drums) are excellent. Maestro Inferno beats the shit out of those cans.\nThe cover of the album is one fucking sick four-handed antropomorphic goat, doing a strange sign with two of its hands and stabing itself with the other two, that are holding something that looks like a golden knife.\nAll the tracks in the album are excellent and powerful.\nI highlight The horns of Baphomet, Modern Iconoclasts, Heru Ra Ha (good chorus \"Ia Ta Bae\"), no sympathy for the fools. Anyway, you should listen to this when youre cutting somebody's head or raping a girl in front of her muzzled parents.\n\nNo sympathy for the fools, KILL THOSE MUTHERFUCKERS AND RAPE ALL THEIR LITTLE SITERS \nSUFFER!\n",
        "\nFor years and years Behemoth has been known as a Black Metal band. A thing they quite radically changed with the album \u201cSatanica\u201d an album which showcased a more Death Metal orientated style. Sure enough there were a lot of Black-purists who shouted rhetoric like \u201ctreason\u201d and \u201csell-out\u201d. All of these gay idiots, who can\u2019t seem to grasp the fact that it\u2019s a band\u2019s choice to evolve into a different style and that that is something the scene just has to deal with, were abruptly silenced by \u201cThelema6\u201d, an album that brought a nice balance in the Morbid Angel-style and the more Black Metalish style. The only problem that album had was a kind of clinical sound and ditto vibe. In these kinds of situations you\u2019re always a bit anxious when it comes to new material by a band so obviously talented and with such potential. \n\nAnd the new album, \"Zos Kia Cultus - Here & Beyond\", is indeed a breath of fresh air in the Death Metal scene. In my (not so) humble opinion Death Metal has been creatively dead for a few years now only pushed forward by a few bands (faster execution on every consecutive album is not progression) and Behemoth is one of them. My God! What An Album! I really don\u2019t know where to start so I\u2019ll start at the beginning. After a brooding intro filled with religious samples the guitars start laying down a very heavy riff which is the spine for the song \"Horns Ov Baphomet\". And straight from the top it\u2019s clear; this album is ALIVE. It feels like an almost sentient being that breathes and moves. I know, I\u2019m beginning to sound like some kind of tree hugging hippy that\u2019s still coming down from last night\u2019s LSD-trip but don\u2019t take my word for it and listen for your self. \n\nNow let\u2019s see if I can find something negative to write about this album... As hard as my speakers will allow (which is considerable) this album sounds so fucking beautiful. The dynamic and overpowering sound sometimes remembers me of Morbid Angel\u2019s \u201cCovenant\u201d albeit a tad more layered and varied. Of course that\u2019s not the only comparison with MA that\u2019s on this album. Listen to songs like \"Modern iconoclasts\" and the brooding \u201cAs Above So Below\u201d and one can easily define the foundations of this style, but still without losing their own face. So when it comes to the music it\u2019s all-good. \n\nMaybe the technique then? By now it has become somewhat redundant to mention individual musicians in this type of music because if a band is going to keep its head above water they need a brilliant drummer and a pair of tight guitarists. What I am going to mention is Nergal\u2019s solos, the man isn\u2019t a genius when it come to this but he knows how to use that which is at his disposal often creating beautiful and exciting effects. The use of a Harmonizer is a nice touch and ads a certain eastern vibe to the whole. \n\nMaybe I can Bitch about the lyrical content? Hardly, Nergal and Krysztof Azarewicz again have looked deep within. And the dominating theme is the power delved from themselves, the music and the band. With a light cabalistic approach there\u2019s being looked into a cultural source of more than 6000 years old in a well informed way that\u2019s highly unusual for this genre. They have found a way to combine this old wisdom with modern feeling and emotions thereby closing the gap between philosophy and feeling. So again, nothing to complain. \n\nThe sleeve maybe? This one comes down to taste really but I love this kind of artwork. No blood, no limbs and amateurish Photoshop bungling. What we do get is a lot of dark symbolism, which makes some of the lyrics very hard to read, so that\u2019s one little point of criticism (I just need glasses). \n\nThere is not a bad note on this album! \n\nThe only reason this album doesn\u2019t get the full 100 points is a sneaky suspicion that the next album will be even better!!!\n\n(This review was originally written for http://www.lordsofmetal.nl and is republished with kind permission of the webmaster)\n",
        "\nI don't even really know how to review something this good. I'm sure as hell going to try, though. Here goes... \n\nZos Kia Cultus, the ten millionth album from these Polish Black/Death crossover gods, will surely be the best of 2003. I remember vividly the feeling I had when placing this disc in the stereo in my car for the first time, while on the way back from the record store. I felt like a little child on christmas day. I thought to myself \"I hold here in my hands, the new Behemoth...Will it live up to the hype?!\". I was overcome with anxiety and anticipation. My palms got sweaty. I started shaking. Not that I ever doubted Nergal and friends, as they consistently turn out extremely high quality Blackened Death Metal. This is the reason I have remained a fan for quite a while now, and this CD is the reason I will continue to remain a fan. \n\nContinuing in the same fashion as their last effort (massive success, if you ask me), Zos Kia Cultus is a grand blasterpiece of monstrous proportions. Every single song on this disc is just so damned good. It's so chock full of those moments that make you wish you could fellate the man who invented the 'rewind' button. Again, Behemoth's influences are quite apparent; drawing most significantly from the likes of Morbid Angel. But somehow, as so many others have failed to do so, Behemoth come off as something entirely new and fresh. As Floridian as it may sound at points, you have never heard anything quite like this before. One addition to their repertoire I greatly enjoyed was the tasteful usage of those stop and go 'chug' riffs. Which are also beautifully accented by the timely double bass drums of percussion virtuoso Inferno. This is most evident on songs such as \"As Above, So Blow\" and \"No Sympathy For Fools\" (Those two coincedentally happen to be my favorites on the album ;) Also of note is the vocal prowess of Nergal himself. This man has so much range and emotion in his growls. \nI mean, if his voice isn't so full of contempt and hatred, I don't know what is. \n\nI think I'm starting to ramble a bit, so I'll wind this down... \n\nIn short: If you are a fan of hook laden, and brutal yet intelligent Death Metal, buy this album upon your next outing. \n\nIf you aren't a fan of that stuff... What the fuck are you doing on this site to begin with?!\n"
