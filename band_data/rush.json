        "\nRush had one of the most memorable runs of the 1970s and the early '80s, and undoubtedly had a profound influence on many metal acts of their era and the era that followed. In 1976, at the behest of label pressures, they delivered the most conceptually ambitious and forward-thinking album to date.\n\nThe album begins with a true masterpiece of a progressive rock song, the title track that's split into seven parts. The song tells the story of a futuristic dystopia where intergalactic tyrants have banned all forms of creativity: no music, no art, no individuality- in favor of maximizing productivity. It's told from the perspective of an innocent boy (presumably by the tone) who discovers a guitar, and when he presents it to the lords in power, he is properly shunned. He ends up committing suicide upon wondering about what life could be with things as beautiful as music and art, instead of statues of the lords reinforcing obedience.\n\nBut what's most striking about this song is actually not drummer Neil Peart's genius in the lyricism. The music itself here is sheer brilliance. Starting with a three minute onslaught of riffing, Alex Lifeson runs through all of the main riffs of the song, introducing little flourishes to spice up the intro. Lifeson often goes discredited as a guitarists, and his work on the prog scene of the seventies was massively influential to bands like Iron Maiden, Dio, Ozzy Osbourne, and Metallica. His riffs have a strong groove that fits nicely with Geddy Lee's bass, and there are moments all over this thing that showcase Peart's manic and instrumentally dense drumming, even if it isn't the focus of the song (as it would be in later works). \n\nWhat's most provocative about this album, however, has to be the versatility that Rush displays- particularly in the B-side. The Asian-inspired riff on \"A Passage to Bangkok\" is humorous, but the band proves themselves to be more than capable of expressing a more tender, forlorn side on songs like \"Tears\" and the \"Soliloquy\" portion of the opus. Geddy Lee's grasp on melody and his prowess as a bass player are what drives these endearing moments, even if the message behind them is haunting and distressed. His voice wavers between sweetness and sheer power, like on the screams in the \"Presentation\" segment of 2112. How a human being can even sound like he does is beyond me, it's truly incredible. \n\n2112 became the blueprint for progressive rock. Even bands twenty years in the future would try replicating what Rush perfected here- Dream Theater on numerous attempts to capture the theatricality and technical excellence that Rush demonstrates here. The trio would outdo themselves commercially on future releases, but this was the apex for Rush in terms of creativity, uniqueness, and performance.\n",
        "\nAfter their synth era culminated with the album Hold Your Fire, Rush decided to ease their use of synths and return to a more guitar-oriented sound. However, this assuaging of the synths did not mark a return to their previous progressive rock sound that was present on the lauded albums that are Permanent Waves and Moving Pictures. No, instead the trio carried on by retaining the innate poppiness present in their synth albums, and mostly not restoring the progressive elements of their music. Presto is the first result of this shift.\n\nFirst, to go over the negative elements of the record. There are two main, overarching facets of Presto that I can identify that may be potentially off-putting to fans of the band. First of all, the production of the album is rather thin, especially compared to the last few albums of the band. The production has its most unfortunate effects on the sound of Neil Peart's drum performance. While his drumming is still great as usual, many times his snare drum seems almost paper-thin, and it lacks much the power that some of their previous productions gave his kit. The other significant matter concerning this album that has instilled contempt within people is the general sound. As mentioned previously, this is kind of a pop rock album. Although it is probably still more complex and technical than most other albums within its genre, Presto still may dissuade some people from listening to it due to its simplified sound, which is even more concise and straightforward than the synth albums. The fact that there are eleven songs of Presto with this style pervading all of them may be a significant detractor to many when it comes to Presto's value. Nevertheless, to those who enjoy catchy choruses and uncomplicated songwriting, Presto may provide a nice experience, although it is too long for what it is.\n\nThe most successful tunes on Presto lie on its second half. In particular, both \u201cRed Tide\u201d and \u201cAvailable Light\u201d hold their ranks among the best of Rush, or at the very least, the best of the band\u2019s lighter material. \u201cRed Tide,\u201d in particular, is a truly hidden gem within their discography. The song is the only one on Presto that strikes me as being dramatic and urgent, a feeling which is best conveyed by its melodramatic chorus: \u201cThis is not a false alarm, this is not a test...\u201d. This sentiment is only bolstered by the use of synth and piano in the song, along with Alex Lifeson\u2019s frenetic and short guitar solo. I really enjoy \u201cRed Tide,\u201d and it stands out to me as being one of the best songs the band ever did, \u201cAvailable Light,\u201d on the the other hand, is a bit more mellow. Like \u201cRed Tide,\u201d piano is used in this track. Keyboards are still present in many songs on Presto, so those who scorn they and find them to be inimical to good songwriting may not appreciate their use. Back to the song, it is actually a really well done ballad; Geddy Lee uses his voice very emotionally here, and the piano lines really add to the romanticism of the track. \u201cThe Pass,\u201d which appears earlier on Presto, is also a ballad. However, it is even more emotional then \u201cAvailable Light,\u201d and has some very pleasant bass chords from Geddy Lee really add to the pulchritude of the song. I will also mention \u201cChain Lightning\u201d and the title track for being great examples of pop rock done correctly, and I thoroughly recommend them as well.\n\nNow, onto some of the more loathed tracks on Presto by the masses. One of the more disliked songs on the album is \u201cHand Over Fist.\u201d Certainly, it is true that the lyrics make very little sense, and that it is a bit repetitious. Despite this, I still find the song to be enjoyable and catchy, even though its chorus isn\u2019t especially melodious. People have also scoffed at \u201cSuperconductor\u201d for being a dud lyrically and for being too repetitious, but I still find it to be enjoyable enough, perhaps in part due to its silly lyrics. There are only a few songs on Presto that I don\u2019t find to be as high of quality as the rest of the material, with \u201cScars\u201d being the preeminent example of this. It has the worst of chorus on the record; It just doesn\u2019t have the same pleasurability and does not deliver the same amount of contentment upon the listener as most of the other songs. \u201cScars\u201d is without doubt my least favorite song on Presto. I also am not a huge fan of the opener, \u201cShow Don\u2019t Tell.\u201d It still is a decently good song, but I find the chorus to actually be weaker than the verses; The melody of the \u201cshow me, don\u2019t tell me\u201d is pretty lull and uninteresting, I have to say. \n\nAlthough my review has lavished much praise upon Presto, my opinion of Presto is perhaps a little lower than my review might suggest. I do not want to aggrandize Presto in the context of the discography of Rush. Presto is indeed a fine record. It can easily be averred, however, that the Canadian trio made better albums before this, albums that were a lot more crucial to music as a whole. Albums like 2112 and Moving Pictures would likely come to mind for most Rush fans when it comes to their most influential records. And for this reason, I find it hard to give Presto a truly amazing score, as it really isn\u2019t as truly amazing as an album like 2112. Nonetheless, Presto is still a damn good listen.\n",
        "\nThe Rush Archives is an interesting little collection. For those who already own the first three studio albums (or those who don't want to own them) there's no need to get this. And for those of you who are seeking the first three, you are more likely to come across individual copies of them than to find this first. But if you did find this first (like I did) and you were interested in getting all three, then this is the perfect way to do it!\n\nThe copy that I have only cost me $17.50 CAD in a used record shop, and one of the LP's (Caress Of Steel) had never even been played, judging by the fact that the spindle hole needed to be enlarged to fit onto the turntable. I have the earlier pressing, which has a grey cover rather than the black cover depicted here on The Metal Archives. The gatefold contains the track list for each LP and a black and white portrait style photograph of each band member (that is to say, Neil Peart, Alex Lifeson, and Geddy Lee [sadly no photo of John Rutsey]). The back cover lists the songs again, each track list beneath a small image of their respective album cover. Overall nothing special, but definitely serviceable.\n\nAs for the songs themselves... Rush is merely a generic hard rock album, full of Led Zeppelin and April Wine style tunes, and plenty of cringeworthy lyrics. Fly By Night retains some of those hard rock elements, but also introduces their signature progressive sound on tracks like \"Anthem\" and \"By-Tor And The Snow Dog\". Finally, Caress Of Steel offers up an entire albums worth of that classic Rush sound (technically brilliant heavy progressive rock/metal) but with far too many moments of over the top showmanship. Personally I'm not the biggest fan of their first three albums (see my previous reviews for more detail) but I still think highly of this \"box set\" in that it gave me an easy way to experience all three albums. So for that I have a rather positive outlook towards this release. Don't hesitate to snap this up in a used shop if you're looking for these albums!\n",
        "\nSadly, Hemispheres is the last brilliant Rush album. But boy oh boy is it good, real good. Taking all that they had learned on the previous albums, the boys from Toronto present us with one absolutely stunning long song (\u00e0 la \"2112\"), two fantastic shorter tunes (\u00e0 la \"Closer To The Heart\" and \"Cinderella Man\"), and one mid length (for them anyways) mind fuck of a self indulgent instrumental that shows they have finally learned where to place all those jarring drum fills and noodly guitar solos that so often plagued Fly By Night and Caress Of Steel.\n\nSide one is filled with the conclusion to the \"Cygnus X-I\" epic that was begun on A Farewell To Kings. It is a masterful chunk of progressive metal and acoustic parts, which includes epic yell-singing from Geddy, fantastic guitar solos from Alex, catchy melodies that hark back to the Beatles heyday, and perhaps Neil's most accomplished set of lyrics ever. For it is indeed a science fiction tale, that ends up full of Greek mythos and allegory. Deep stuff, and damn near close to literature.\n\nSide two kicks off with \"Circumstances\" and \"The Trees\", one of the best one two punches in music history, and both contenders for the title of best short Rush song. Geddy shines on these tracks like some sort of shrieking bass god, laying down complex bass lines whilst yelling out another set of fine lyrics by Neil. The epic contrast between acoustic and heavy on \"The Trees\" should alone be enough to convince any non fans of Rush's well deserved legendary status.\n\nHere in Canada, this album feels just a touch more Canadian than their previous works, what with the nod to Canada's other official language (French) on the chorus of \"Circumstances\" and the possibly unintended allegory of \"The Trees\" being about Ontario (oaks) and Qu\u00e9bec (maples). This is not necessarily relevant to all listeners, but it's a nice thing for a nation that often struggles to create its own unique culture in relation to the dominant culture immediately south of it, to have something world renowned be in some way uniquely Canadian.\n\nTo cap things off, we have the Spanish titled \"La Villa Strangiato\" which remains the single greatest Rush song to play for people who don't like Geddy Lee's voice. Many an intelligent music fan has refused to give Rush a chance based on their dislike for Geddy's voice (despite a reasonable amount of variety displayed by the lad over their long and varied career) and in doing so has missed out on a full appreciation of their instrumental skills. Luckily we have here something so fantastically skillful and catchy that I dare you to find me someone who can remain unimpressed by the end of \"La Villa Strangiato\". In that regard, this is the perfect ending for this album, and this chapter of Rush's career.\n\nRIP Neil Peart. Your lyric writing on Hemispheres approached literary status, and your drumming was heavenly.\n",
        "\nIt was always going to be hard to meet expectations after 2112, but on A Farewell To Kings Rush turned in another spine tingling album.\n\nSong for song A Farewell To Kings might even be better than 2112, but as an album listening experience not much is ever going to top playing \"2112\" at top volume. In many ways though this is Rush's most balanced album. A great variety in song lengths, with runtimes from 02:35 up to 11:08 minutes, and everything else more or less staggered in between. Lyrically we have a pleasant mixture of fantasy/medieval, science fiction, romance, and philosophy, and musically they run the gamut from heavy and proggy to acoustically medieval. Damn do they have a lot of different ways to show off their chops!\n\nSongs like \"Closer To The Heart\" and \"Cinderella Man\" are concise examples of all that Rush do well; amazing guitar tone, intricate bass lines, wizardly drumming, all thrown together with fantastic melodies and interesting lyrics. Longer tracks such as \"Xanadu\", \"Cygnus X-1\" and the title track are drawn out versions of the aforementioned strong suits, and show their ability to develop interesting ideas over multiple sections and styles. It's hard to name a favourite track or style on this album.\n\nFrom a nerd perspective (and let's be real, the most diehard Rush fans are generally pretty nerdy) it's a super cool idea to have the final song on A Farewell To Kings be continued on with the first song on Hemispheres. It helps that both parts are great songs, and I can only imagine what kind of excitement would have been generated back in 1978 when existing Rush fans purchased Hemispheres and realised there was a part two awaiting them! But I'm getting ahead of myself...\n\nThe weaknesses on this album are few and far between. Some people might not like the synths on \"Xanadu\", \"Madrigal\" might be a bit slowpaced for some, and \"Cygnus X-I\" contains a rather pompous drum fill, but these are all things that on a good day I completely enjoy, and on a bad day I merely dismiss as Rush being Rush. There's not much here except fantastic music!\n\nRIP Neil Peart\n",
        "\nWow, what an interstellar leap in progress and subject matter!\n\nOn 2112 Rush finally reach the peak potential hinted at on previous albums. With mind boggling tight skillful playing and wonderfully crafted songs working smoothly together, they reach a level where even over the top showmanship cannot ruin their songs. Throw in their heaviest playing to date, and we have the heaviest slab of prog metal to ever exist in 1976.\n\nSeriously, even if nothing else Rush ever played was metal enough for you, \"The Temples Of Syrinx\" is undeniably heavy as fuck. Lots of people don't like black metal vocals or death growls, but there's probably just as many people out there who don't like Geddy Lee's yell-singing on 2112. But if you're a metal head, you've gotta dig it (even if you're the kind of metal head like me who's not particularly fond of unclean vocals). Geddy brings the wrath of the Priests like something from interstellar Hell.\n\nSo yeah, Geddy Lee's vocals are top-notch on this album. So is his bass playing. Groovy, heavy, melodic, and absolutely jaw dropping when you realise that he somehow managed to play all these bass lines whilst singing live simultaneously. He's a monster. One of three monsters in Rush.\n\nIt's amazing how integral each monster (member) of Rush was to the overall sound of the band. Remove Geddy, and you've not only lost one of the most distinctive voices in music, but you've also lost one of the most talented bass players, who played things that others could only dream of playing (whilst singing or not). Remove Neil Peart, and you've lost their entire lyrical identity as we know it, and possibly the most recognisable drumming on the planet. Remove Alex Lifeson, and there's no guarantee you would find a replacement who can play the guitar with such melody, such tone, such heaviness, and such skill. His solo on \"Overture\" is worth the price of admission alone. No wonder why he is one of Jimmy Page's favourite guitar players.\n\nWhat makes this album a step up from everything that Rush had released up to this point is songwriting. The talent was always there, but a combination of generic sound and lacklustre songwriting had haunted them too often. Not anymore. Every part of \"2112\" is perfectly written, perfectly placed. The quiet parts, the slow parts, the heavy parts: they all occur at just the right moment to keep the whole epic cruising. Even the oft maligned side two is chock-full of well written songs. They've developed a real sense of melody that brings enjoyment to each song. And the songwriting is now so good that even the odd pompous drum fill just gets shrugged off as a part of the song, rather than a jarring interruption. In fact I even want to air drum along with Neil most of the time now. \n\nThe only thing that keeps this album from receiving a perfect score is that even though nothing on side two is bad, some of it is clearly not as strong as side one. \"A Passage To Bangkok\", \"The Twilight Zone\", \"Lessons\" and \"Something For Nothing\" are pretty much on par with most of the individual movements of \"2112\" but \"Tears\" is a notch below, and overall you don't have that same unifying force as on side one to lift all these tracks together into something greater than the sum of its parts. So alas, side two is not quite as good as side one. But that's okay, because I can always flip the record an extra time and listen to \"2112\" again.\n\nRIP Neil Peart. Your tom fill at the beginning of \"The Temples Of Syrinx\" actually fucking rocks. Amen.\n",
        "\nCaress Of Steel is the logical step from Fly By Night to 2112. It's a lot like the former in that it contains uneven song quality, and a lot like the later (except in reverse order) with a run of short songs followed by long epics. It takes the more unique Rush sound which emerged on Fly By Night in tunes like \"Anthem\", \"By-Tor...\" and \"Fly By Night\" and expands on it whilst shedding the leftover hard rock sound from the band's debut.\n\nWhile there are still a few moments of blatant Yes worship (including \"The Battle\" section of \"The Necromancer\" which sounds like the beginning to \"Heart Of The Sunrise\" from Fragile) overall this album finally contains a unique Rush sound pretty much throughout. There's no mistaking which band you are listening to. This is Rush. It's not always the most well written Rush, and certain members still struggle with differentiating between times to be subtle and times to show off, but Caress Of Steel is joyously nerdy Dungeons & Dragons prog rock mixed with phenomenal playing by all, epic yell-singing by Geddy, and heavy metallic guitar tones by Alex.\n\nA solid majority of the time this album gets it right. \"Bastille Day\" is a crunchy opener, worthy of cementing Rush's place amongst the heaviest of 70's bands. \"I Think I'm Going Bald\" is lyrically goofy, but also shows profoundly deep thoughts on ageing for men so young. \"Lakeside Park\" paints a picture of days gone by in the same way that an Impressionist painting by Monet conveys the lily pond of yore; imperfect on details but perfect on atmosphere. In fact, for good and ill, a lot of Caress Of Steel could be described that way for different reasons: imperfectly perfect.\n\nThe two longer songs offer the most to love, but also the most to dislike. \"The Necromancer\" is an epic fantasy tale, and while it's hard to fault it if you want to feel like you're listening to someone else's D&D adventure, it contains several ridiculous elements which hold it back from being perfect. Firstly we have the heavily distorted voice of the narrator (whom I suspect is Neil Peart) which ruins any chances that this song had of being taken seriously, and adds a large wedge of cheese into each section. I do kinda like it (because it has become so iconic) but it really is quite cheesy. Secondly we have the bands usual problem of a lack of subtlety. Some of Neil's drumming is just a bit too over the top, and the loud noise that kickstarts \"The Battle\" is one of the most laugh inducing sounds in my entire music collection. Again though, I kinda like that noise because it makes me laugh, but this song could have been so much better if it was just a little bit more serious.\n\n\"The Fountain Of Lamneth\" is also guilty of several over the top drum parts, but for the most part it stays the serious course much better. Unfortunately it also has it's duller moments where the melody falters somewhat and the listener's attention span might start to wander. Thankfully though (as on the rest of the album) it has a much improved Alex Lifeson to rescue it with some excellent heavy guitar playing, and in the end it's not a throwaway track.\n\nIf Caress Of Steel had come out later in their career, it would have seemed like a let down, but sandwiched between Fly By Night and 2112 it fits in quite snugly, and shows us the way to even better things!\n\nRIP Neil Peart\n",
        "\nIntroducing Neil Peart. What a difference one drummer makes.\n\nIn my review for the previous album, I stated that Rush contained two major flaws. The first one being a lack of their own sound. The second one being a lack of consistently good song writing. Thankfully by this album we start to hear the emergence of their own sound on some of the tracks, and so the first flaw is now not as prevalent. Sadly the second flaw remains in similar quantity as on the first album.\n\nWhen they get it right, which is not often on Fly By Night, they get it very right. We hear the beginning of that classic Rush sound coupled with better song writing on the song \"Fly By Night\" and on parts of \"Anthem\" and \"By-Tor And The Snow Dog\". Incredibly tight virtuistic playing, super catchy melodies, deeper and more interesting lyrics, and song structures that are now venturing towards their own unique take on progressive rock masters Yes, rather than generic hard rock snoozers. Unfortunately most of the rest of the album lacks great song writing and struggles to sound unique. The ideas are usually there, and the playing is always fantastic, but the song craft is often subpar and either too derivitive of Yes (or in the case of \"Making Memories\" the Doobie Brothers) or retains the generic hard rock sound from Rush. They're at their best when they appear to be influenced by Yes, rather than copying Yes.\n\nNow what about the addition of Neil Peart? The addition of such a phenomenally skilled drummer naturally led to the inclusion of more prominent drum parts in the songs, but unfortunately most of the time that's a negative, not a positive. His playing positively reeks of pompous bombasity, and the word subtle probably hadn't entered his vocabulary yet, despite how many books he had supposedly read. Don't get me wrong, his playing is amazing, but it's rarely tasteful, and it makes listening to many of these songs a jarring one, rather than a contemplative one. I say a contemplative one, because other highly skilled rock drummers hold back more, and make you listen closer to figure out how good they really are (such as Bill Bruford, Stewart Copeland, Ginger Baker, and John Bonham) whereas Neil simply whacks you over the head with his best drum fills. He seems to have a higher ratio of drums fills to straight beats than any other contemporary drummer except perhaps Keith Moon. Exhibit 1: the intro to \"Anthem\" is an example of unnecessarily complicated drumming, which coupled with Alex's noodly guitar solo detracts from an otherwise good song. \n\nLyrically we begin to enter well known Rush territory (thanks to Neil). Fantasy (\"By-Tor\", \"Rivendell\") and philosophy (\"Anthem\") enter the fold for the first time. Geddy's voice and the band's nerdy demeanour suit the lyrics much better than on Rush. Speaking of Geddy, his bass lines are always interesting, but never seem too busy because no matter what he plays, Neil (and sometimes Alex) will always be playing something even busier. And speaking of Alex, he offers up quite the variety, with great solos on \"By-Tor\" and \"Fly By Night\", several super noodly solos elsewhere, and weird pig noises on the \"Across The Styx\" section of \"By-Tor\".\n\nRivendell is easily the worst song on the album. It's a cool idea stretched out too long, with a nondescript melody, and ironically for Rush, it's too stripped down. They'll find the sweet spot eventually, but not exactly on this album.\n\nI don't think Neil Peart would be one of my all time favourite drummers if this was the only album he did with Rush, but thankfully the best was yet to come. I still get some joy from this album though. RIP Neil, 1952-2020.\n",
        "\nIt has been my intention for several years now to do a Rush review marathon, and sadly it was the passing of Neil Peart that has finally spurred me to begin. But seeing as Mr. Peart had yet to join Rush on their eponymous debut, no more shall be said about the man until we Fly By Night.\n\nRush: Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson, and... John Rutsey! The boys sound energetic and youthful on their debut, with plenty of catchy guitar parts, thunderous bass lines, and solid drumming, but they lack a unique identity, and end up sounding like a generic Led Zeppelin/April Wine hard rock band.\n\nIf one were to hear several random ten second sound bytes from this album, the chances of being impressed by the musicianship and intrigued by the potential would draw most hard rock/traditional metal fans right in, but alas an album needs much more than just genre to be successful. Rush, the album, contains two major flaws. The first flaw is that they lack their own sound (other than Geddy's distinctive voice) something that plagues every song. The second flaw is that most of the songs are poorly written\u2014repetitive, generic, and often boring\u2014which while the second flaw doesn't pertain to all of the songs, even the better written ones are still subject to the first flaw, and thus far from perfect.\n\nThe best songs on here are good (\"Finding My Way\", \"Need Some Love\" and \"Working Man\") and are ones that I find myself returning to from time to time, but the album as a whole is something I can only listen to every five years or so, and even then I wonder why I did. \"In The Mood\" is by far the most cringey, and retroactively seems so out of place in the Rush canon which is dominated by science fiction, fantasy, and philosophical epics. But the same can be said lyrically of \"Need Some Love\" and yet its chorus melody is just so damn catchy that I cannot help but smile.\n\n\"Working Man\", being the longest (and best) song on this album, deserves it's own analysis, if only for the purpose of giving sceptics one thing to look forward to. It contains a catchy riff that might stick in your head long after listening, highly recognisable Geddy vocals, a rad bass driven breakdown, and an extended guitar solo which certainly shows off some of Alex's skills, but goes on for far too long and descends into unnecessary wankery. Though it's not a perfect song, it's a good one, and it's probably the only song on this album deserving of inclusion on any theoretical career spanning double CD compilations.\n\nListen to this album if you are in the mood (haha) for some generic air humping 70's rock. Do not listen if you are craving Rush as we know them.\n\nFinally a few words should be spared for John Rutsey, who played the drums very well, if unspectacular, and ended up being the Pete Best of Rush. RIP John Rutsey 1952-2008.\n",
        "\nHold Your Fire, Rush's twelfth studio album, is often seen as the culmination of the synth-laden style that they started doing around the release of Signals. This assessment of the album is a fair one, although this album is still quite different than the three preceding albums before it that are often included in their synth era. Hold Your Fire has the most conventionally pop-like structure of Rush's synth period, as opposed to the morose and introspective Grace Under Pressure and the bass-driven, but less vocally focused Power Windows, for example. Although Hold Your Fire's more upbeat and poppy aspect makes it to many one of Rush's lesser efforts, the underlying music is quite rather enjoyable despite the negative connotation that poppiness has.\n\nThere are several satisfying and engaging songs to be found on Hold Your Fire. The album begins with \"Force Ten,\" which shows off Geddy Lee's great bass playing skills; the bass chords used that drive the tempo of the song are rather interesting because of their prominence. The chorus slows down the song a lot and lets the synths create quite the ethereal atmosphere. \"Force Ten\" is likely the best song on the album. The succeeding song, \"Time Stand Still,\" is also another highlight of the record. Alex Lifeson's sleek and fresh-sounding chords generate a lively nature to the song, despite it only traveling at more of a mid-tempo. Aimee Mann's feminine vocals accent Geddy Lee's already high pitched voice during the chorus quite well. Lee opts to cleanly sing on Hold Your Fire, as he had done since the beginning of the 1980's. Though it is likely the most melodious and poppy song on Hold Your Fire, \"Prime Mover\" is still rather great, the best part of the song being its bouncy chorus (and the gripping bassline that Lee plays through it.) \"Open Secrets\" and \"Lock and Key\" are somewhat similar in that they have more of a inward-looking and questioning atmosphere, but they both are still different enough to stand out, though some have criticized \"Lock and Key\" being a bit on the nose with its lyrical message (humans suppress primal instincts and feelings in everyday life). \n\nThough I do like most of Hold Your Fire, it still has some low points. The record should have ended with \"Turn the Page\" or \"Mission\" being the last song (both songs would work well as closers); the two actual closing tracks are not the greatest. \"Tai Shan\" has been criticized by many people and even by Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson themselves, but is it really that bad of a song? Not really in my opinion. It is kind of cheesy at first, with the Chinese pipe (flute?) instrument playing over the track. However, over time, \"China sang to me\" (I really wanted to make this joke). It really isn't that bad of a song, and it is alright, albeit not amazing. The real song that holds Hold Your Fire back however is \"High Water\". Neil Peart has kind of an interesting drum pattern in the song, but that is the only thing that keeps it from being a total waste of time. It is a really boring and uneventful closer; its place would have been served better by the song \"Mission,\" a slow and synth laden track which ends with a fanciful guitar solo by Lifeson and then fades out. In addition to this, people who dislike Lifeson's diminished role on playing or Neil Peart's electronic drumset will likely find this album to be abbhorent, so beware. Neither Peart nor Lifeson go really wild on this record, so those who seek a high degree of technicality in the music they listen to may also not find much value in the album.\n\nHold Your Fire marks the end of an era for Rush; after this album, they would swerve into more guitar-based popular rock music with a little bit of their previous progressive elements, and then onto injecting alternative rock into the mix starting with Counterparts. For fans of nice, catchy music that is laden with atmosphere and is still based in rock, Hold Your Fire is the Rush album to go to.\n\nRIP Neil Peart (1952-2020)\n",
        "\nLate seventies Rush has always had a great reputation among fans of progressive rock and metal. And not without reason. Rush managed to inject all the clever twists and melodic touches that the likes of Genesis and Jethro Tull had into their music without ever losing the heavy, Led Zeppelin-esque force that so many progressive bands sacrificed in the process of making their music less immediate. To me, \u2018A Farewell To Kings\u2019 is the Canadian trio\u2019s crowning achievement, because it manages to strike a balance between all the elements that make them the band they are unlike any other of their albums.\n\nAfter a bunch of great short, punchy songs, but underdeveloped and meandering epics on \u2018Caress Of Steel\u2019 and possibly the best side-long song of the seventies followed by a handful of largely unremarkable shorter tracks on \u20182112\u2019, \u2018A Farewell To Kings\u2019 finally gets everything right. The long songs are a bit shorter this time around, though there are still two that pass the 10 minute mark, which causes the band to sound a tad more focused than before. Where in the past, the band\u2019s amazing performances pushed some of the less remarkable passages over the edge, \u2018A Farewell To Kings\u2019 is tight and powerful all the way through.\n\nOn the shorter side of the spectrum, \u2018Closer To The Heart\u2019 is probably the first truly radio-friendly song the band ever recorded. It is done on their own terms, however. Built upon twelve string acoustic strumming by Alex Lifeson and containing several changes in dynamics, it is barely believable that the track is under three minutes long. So is \u2018Madrigal\u2019, which is more folky in approach and brings to mind \u2018A Trick Of The Tail\u2019 era Genesis. \u2018Cinderella Man\u2019 is a more typical Rush song somewhat in line with \u2018Lakeside Park\u2019 from \u2018Caress Of Steel\u2019.\n\nThe powerful opening track is the middle ground on \u2018A Farewell To Kings\u2019. It is not as concise as the aforementioned songs, but it also is not a big, sweeping epic. There are some powerful riffs in the track and some of Geddy Lee\u2019s most impressive vocal work to date: it\u2019s still high-pitched, but full of passion. One of my favorite Rush songs. The same can be said about the following \u2018Xanadu\u2019, which tells the tale of an immortal man descending into madness both musically and lyrically in a highly dynamic 11-minute track. The other long song, closer \u2018Cygnus X-1\u2019, is slightly more fragmented, but such a masterpiece of progrock musicianship and massive riffs, that it is easy to forgive the band.\n\nIn hindsight, \u2018A Farewell To Kings\u2019 can be seen as a transitional effort between Rush\u2019s more proggy early days and their more accessible work that started with \u2018Permanent Waves'. But of course, it is not that black and white, if only because \u2018Hemispheres\u2019 was released in the intervening years. I do have the feeling that it often gets overlooked due to being sandwiched between \u20182112\u2019 and \u2018Hemispheres\u2019, both of which have huge, sprawling epics, but in fact, it is my favorite Rush album. Sadly, Neil Peart\u2019s death three weeks ago means that they will never top it.\n\nRecommended tracks: \u2018A Farewell To Kings\u2019, \u2018Xanadu\u2019, \u2018Cygnus X-1\u2019\n\nOriginally written for my Kevy Metal weblog\n",
        "\nBeginnings are always rough. Some bands start out strong (Skepticism, Agalloch and Alcest come to mind), while others really take an album or two to really get their feet wet and creativity juices flowing.\n\nRush is one of those bands. Their debut wears the trite and absolutely snoozefest Cream, The Who and, of course, Led Zeppelin influence on its sleeve, which is no surprise or shock to any fan of Rush. Neil wasn\u2019t in the band yet, (he was over in the UK, seeking fame and fortune drumming for beer money for local pub bands) so the hard Ayn Rand and Tolkien worship hadn\u2019t yet graced us. Instead, we get Mr. John Rutsey, who sounds no different than any student of Bohnam. Unfortunately, his crippling alcoholism and diabetes proved to be the best thing for Rush, as his creatively void presence no longer hindered the progressive spirit of Geddy and Alex.\n\nThe album starts out strong (relatively) with \u201cFinding My Way\u201d. There is a youthful energy here, which is admirable in it\u2019s own right. The riff played throughout the song is quite catchy, and does it\u2019s job well. Structure, which is a vital thing that will be addressed in many later Rush reviews, is also kept interesting, with a nice change-up halfway through the song. As with most songs on this album, the lyrics tend to be absolute shit, even among 70\u2019s Blues Rock bands, and given Rush\u2019s later 180 into some of the absolute best lyrics ever conceived in Rock music period, it only adds to the contrast.\n\nThe next song is perhaps the most useless entry in this album with \u201cNeed Some Love\u201d, a song that not only goes absolutely nowhere, but has a terrible, almost laughably bad structure to it. Understandably, for fans of this style of blues rock, songs like \u201cFinding My Way\u201d or \u201cWorking Man\u201d are kings in the genre, but one has to really contemplate the use and purpose of a song not even 2 and a half minutes in length, with no redeeming qualities other than pure filler, something it doesn\u2019t even succeed at that with.\n\n\u201cWhat You\u2019re Doing\u201d is my favorite song on the album for a few reasons: it\u2019s an excellent song reproduced live (check out the \u201cAll the World\u2019s a Stage version for my personal favorite rendition of the song), due to it\u2019s interesting guitar work, especially the solo towards the middle and the fact that it has a sense of direction, structure and purpose. \u201cWhat You\u2019re Doing\u201d never overstays its welcome, comes in, lays some great guitar work, and gets the hell out without it\u2019s cringe lyrics ruining it even more.\n\nThere honestly, isn\u2019t much to say about this album that hasn\u2019t been said before, and there\u2019s no bigger truth that the few issues it has are so strong and present, that it becomes tiresome to read over and over, but for one last say of these said issues, \u201cIn the Mood\u201d proves that there truly is a meaning behind \u201cgo big or go home\u201d because this song is the culmination of everything wrong with the Rutsey \u201cera\u201d of Rush personified in 3 and a half minutes. From the laughably cheesy intro riff, to the even more laughable cowbell, to the even more laughable lyrics, \u201cIn the Mood\u201d proves itself as a microcosm of the personality of characters like Carl Brutananadilewski from Aqua Teen Hunger Force. Charismatically void, sexually driven and stuck in an fusion of 70\u2019s pseudo machismo and a mind that never escaped high school.\n\nFinally, \u201cWorking Man\u201d, a staple in the catalogue, is structurally great for live settings, features a monstrous and memorable main riff, and thoroughly finishes the album nicely. With lyrics being basically about blue collarism, and the idea of just being a \u201cworking man\u201d, it\u2019s no surprise it\u2019s relevancy among that crowd when it started out. Interesting how Rush, known for being ultra nerdy, academic and philosophically minded, had it\u2019s start writing songs about the working class.\n\nIt\u2019s to be expected though. One can mark this album off as kids being kids, and I get that. I would agree with that statement on the premise that Rush\u2019s later catalogue wasn\u2019t so fucking mindblowing. There\u2019s one thing this album has though, and it is does feel like a unified thing, whether that\u2019s because the opener and closer do their jobs well, or not, I\u2019ll never know. It also has heart, which is always admirable.\n\nI never liked Zeppelin. In fact, I think they\u2019re terrible. And unfortunately, this album wears that influence too heavily for me to see beyond it.\n\n\nStandout tracks: What You\u2019re Doing, Finding my Way, Working Man\n\nWorst tracks: In the Mood, Need Some Love, Take a Friend.\n",
        "\nThe albums that make up Rush\u2019s so-called \u201csynth era\u201d may not be as universally hailed as their 70s prog rock behemoths, but it would be unfair to lump them all under the same umbrella. From the reggae tinges on Signals to the densely produced Power Windows, each one has a distinct identity with its own atmosphere and tone. Grace Under Pressure, Rush\u2019s tenth album, is certainly no exception. I wager that it is not only the most unique of the band\u2019s 80s outings but also the most distinct album they ever recorded.\n\nGrace Under Pressure could hardly be called Rush\u2019s heaviest or most aggressive album but they\u2019ve never sounded this nihilistic. The atmosphere is incredibly cold as Alex Lifeson\u2019s guitar work has an icy tinge to it, the drums are robotic yet intricate in classic Neil Peart fashion, and Geddy Lee\u2019s keyboard patches are piercingly abrasive. The songs are often driven by basslines that have a certain hollowness to them and Lee\u2019s vocals have an underlying sense of urgency despite largely continuing the more restrained approach first seen on Permanent Waves. If Moving Pictures and Signals sounded too much like The Police, then the guys must\u2019ve been listening to a lot of The Cure and Sisters of Mercy when crafting this one.\n\nOn top of that, the lyrics are among the most apocalyptic that Peart ever penned. The band was never afraid to tackle dark subjects before, but this album is fully immersed in it. Songs like \u201cDistant Early Warning\u201d and \u201cThe Enemy Within\u201d reflect the Cold War fears so common at the time while the prison camp theme of \u201cRed Sector A,\u201d hits horrifyingly close to home as Lee\u2019s parents having survived the Holocaust served as prominent inspiration. Even the android escapee narrative on \u201cThe Body Electric\u201d fits right in with the real-world paranoia.\n\nBut what makes the album truly unnerving is how upbeat the songwriting stays throughout the whole ordeal. \u201cDistant Early Warning\u201d starts things off like a bizarro successor to \u201cThe Spirit of Radio\u201d with its happy warnings of acid rain and it\u2019s pretty uncanny to hear \u201cAfterimage\u201d deliver its mournful condolences to such groovy beats, but the themes on \u201cRed Sector A\u201d get even more morbid when set to such danceable beats. Things do slow down toward the end with \u201cRed Lenses\u201d and \u201cBetween the Wheels\u201d serving as brooding denouements, but they oddly end up being the album\u2019s lesser tracks.\n\nOverall, Grace Under Pressure isn\u2019t Rush\u2019s best or most significant album, but they never made anything else like it. The emphasis on synth arrangements and catchy songwriting is right in line with everything else they did in the 80s, but the brittle yet caustic attitude that permeates throughout could never be replicated in the years to follow. It\u2019s not the best entry point but I could see fans of post-punk or goth rock finding it relevant to their interests. Definitely one worth exploring once you\u2019ve acquainted yourself with those 70s prog classics.\n\nHighlights:\n\u201cDistant Early Warning\u201d\n\u201cAfterimage\u201d\n\u201cRed Sector A\u201d\n\u201cThe Enemy Within\u201d\n\nOriginally published at http://indymetalvault.com\n",
        "\nRush has always been regarded as one of the very most important bands in progressive rock and metal history, and for good reason: Their intricate song structures and use of outside influences has become a staple of countless bands' sounds. The complexity of their masterpiece, the 20-minute epic song \"2112\" is undeniably one of the greatest achievements the legendary power trio have ever put their name on; however, the album to which it lends its title contains no other really worthwhile music.\n\nSure, there are some fine riffs on the last five out of six songs; but none of them rival the colossally layered, pre-NWOBHM mastery of harmonies and atmosphere displayed consistently on the title track. Nor do the display the unbelievable musical intensity Rush could often take on effortlessly. The acoustic parts everywhere but first song feel thin and lifeless, but it's all made up for before you even get to those songs.\n\nAs for \"2112\" itself, it's about as close to perfect as anyone could achieve at the time. The lyrics tell a story, a magnificent concept about the rediscovery of music in a weird religious dystopian society; for some reason, it ends with aliens invading the planet, but I'm clueless as to why. The multisectional, 20-minute piece is actually comprised of seven individual songs, but most of them seamlessly transition into the next, giving the impression of a single cohesive song.\n\nAs a whole, 2112 stands out merely because of its title track. The rest isn't really bad, it's just dull. Between \"A Passage to Bangkok\" and \"Something for Nothing,\" there aren't very many inspiring or revolutionary moments and the songs really feel useless in the shadow of the superior song, which takes up more than half of the whole album.\n",
        "\nIt\u2019s not often that I can describe an album in my collection as \u2018topical\u2019. Certainly, for rock bands, it\u2019s something that\u2019s relatively hard to do without coming across as ham-fisted, preachy or, worse still, completely non-committal in terms of what you\u2019re trying to say (\u2026And Justice for All is vague enough that it could be broached by both sides of the political spectrum and leaving both sides with a \"Government - bad\" message). Worst of all, is when your politics sidetrack your music and you end up with talk-radio or teenage graffiti sloganeering on wax/plastic/mp3/mini-disc. For Rush, especially, we might consider these to be dangerous waters given that 1976\u2019s 2112 was based on the writings of Ayn Rand. It all sounds a bit ropey here.\n\nThere should be further (early) warning signs here given that Rush \u2013 musically \u2013 have dropped any harder rocking leanings and fully embraced a much more contemporary, radio-friendly sound (albeit one with Rush\u2019s traditionally muscular playing in tact). Certainly, I\u2019m willing to wager that you\u2019d find the likes of The Police, Talking Heads and U2 amongst Rush\u2019s collective record collection in \u201984. Another controversial issue here is that they\u2019ve dropped heavier guitars in favour of a very clean, airy guitar sound and accompanied them with icy, brittle synths in a manner that would have sent alarm bells ringing for those who might suspect an attempted sell-out. I mean, they even flirt with cod-reggae new wave-ish passages here. It spells disaster. \n\n\u2026And yet, this turns out to be one of Rush\u2019s absolute best albums! The musicianship is more restrained, but I never really cared for Neil Peart\u2019s endless tom-fills and, whilst their instrumentals are fun, they often lack a bit of staying power for me in comparison to their more moving, focused moments. Again, the dropping of the heavier parts was a stroke of genius as it allows Alex Lifeson to demonstrate his prowess in an entirely different manner. His beautifully chorused, reverberated, just-ever-so-slightly-crunchy guitar sound provides the perfect canvas for his explorations in the higher registers of rhythm guitar \u2013 the band never sounded so spacious and bright. Geddy Lee\u2019s bass proves both lucid and potent; a vital part of the compositions but it never oversteps the mark into \u201cslap bass tutorial on how sound like a dickhead\u201d territory. Peart, too, is even better with a more measured approach. However, I must chastise him slightly for attempting to do that stupid drum clinic \u2018play a melody on the drums\u2019 part on \u2018Red Lenses\u2019.\n\nAgain, my overall impression with this album is surprise; Rush manage to soften their sound, write engaging, catchy songs and even incorporate some weird influences to their sound (doesn\u2019t \u2018The Enemy Within\u2019 occasionally sound like a cod-reggae version of \u2018Land Down Under\u2019? And yet, it\u2019s really fucking good). Geddy Lee\u2019s witchy vocals are just the icing on the cake; he\u2019s grown from more Plant-esque chest-beating style of his early days nto a wonderfully idiosyncratic singer, whose tone, whilst unique, provides to be absolutely perfect for this material. Hell, they even get away with writing a chorus in Morse code. \n\nThe album\u2019s Cold War atmospherics are really intriguing, too; it conjures images of both the gloomy and the slightly less gloomy side of the Iron Curtain. Families separated by the Berlin Wall, stone-faced guards waiting to gun down defectors and, on the other side, the paranoia of \u201creds under the bed\u201d echoing the witch-hunts of old. \u2018Red Sector A\u2019 appears to recall the atrocities of the Stalinist era and does so in a harrowing manner. Certainly, it\u2019s a haunting piece. On a side note, I know it\u2019s trendy to be a communist again, but I just really wish people would choose symbols less synonymous with murder and oppression than the hammer and sickle. Ultimately, however, the album\u2019s message is one of the futility of war and a warning of nuclear war that would not spare either side. It could be seen as a typical message, certainly, one we\u2019ve heard before, but it\u2019s still potent. \u2018Between the Wheels\u2019 acts as the perfect closer to this \u2018not-fully-conceptual\u2019 album. Musically and lyrically \u2013 it is incredibly urgent; acting as an appropriate conclusion to the album and its themes. The song\u2019s refrain is one of the band\u2019s best and certainly their most poignant. \n\nWeirdly, this potential ugly duckling has ended up being my favourite Rush album (alongside the totally different Caress of Steel). Its title actually reflects its contents very well, as grace is its primary character. I\u2019d say this ended up being quite an influential record, too, with those icy synths making their way \u2013 less successfully, I\u2019ll say \u2013 onto Iron Maiden\u2019s 1988 classic and Voivod\u2019s non-metal material in the late 80s and early 90s being influenced by this album\u2019s musical approach.\n",
        "\nHello everybody, I'm finally back with another review! Today I will be reviewing the debut album of the one and only, Rush! Yes, my first non-thrash review. Rush's debut is full of bluesy hard rock and proto-metal. Many people tend to view this album in a negative light, dismissing the album as premature and not representative of what Rush is all about. While this album might not contain the prog rock epics that would be soon to come, it does however contain the talents of early drummer John Rutsey, with this being the only Rush album he performs on. \n\nThe album's style is deeply rooted in the hard rock style, much in the vein of Led Zeppelin and Cream. Alex Lifeson's guitar work is definitely a nod to the likes of Clapton and Page, and Geddy Lee's vocal style is obviously influenced by Robert Plant. Drummer John Rutsey may not be as technically proficient as Neil Peart, but he puts on a commendable performance. The songs here are your straight forward early 70's rock numbers. They aren't anything earth shattering, but there are some cool riffs and solos. \"Finding My Way\" has a really cool intro with Lifeson's inspired guitar riff, and Lee's high register vocals. \"Here Again\" is the most underrated song on the record, with a slow blues rock approach, and some remarkable guitar solos. Especially the ending solo, Lifeson is absolutely on fire during the ending! \n\nI do have some slight grievances to voice. The lyrics can be quite cringe-inducing at times. There are a lot of \"Oh baby\" lines in there, and it just sounds kind of premature, for Rush standards at least. While this is their debut, I can't help but wince at these lyrics. The last two songs more than make up for these complaints however. \"Before And After\" is an absolute masterpiece. The intro is one of the most poignant, melancholic, and beautiful pieces of music I've heard in all of 70's hard rock. It really paints a picture of a afternoon in the 70's, or one of those medication commercials you see on television haha. Jokes aside, this song gets rocking in high gear near the end, and it's a nice deep cut on the album. \"Working Man\" is the big one here, and closes out the record. This track really spoke to the blue collar city of Cleveland when it was played on the local radio station. It quickly became somewhat of a local hit there, with many listeners of the station calling in asking \"When is the next Led Zeppelin album coming out?\". The track is the perfect closer, with a blazing guitar solo and crazy ending to end out the song and the record.\n\nRush would go on to bigger and better things, becoming one of the biggest prog rock bands, and hiring Neil Peart as drummer. While this album may not be a accurate representation of what Rush is all about, it is a fine debut effort that is worth your listening time. All I got to say about this, what a rush!\n\nHighlights: \"Finding My Way\", \"Here Again\", \"Before And After\", and \"Working Man\"\n",
        "\nThis is easily Rush's finest and most metallic work. Four songs, each of them rock in their own special little way, and it can certainly be argued that each individual member is at their instrumental peak. Influential as well, for everyone from Metallica to Jeff Buckley has claimed this as an influence. Fun fact, in an interview Neil said making this album was the second most miserable time of his life after losing his wife and daughter, a statement that always bugged me. Sometimes one must suffer for their art, Professor.\n\nThe album picks up musically, (but perhaps not lyrically) right where Cygnus X-1 Book I left off. Hemispheres is the second finest Rush song over the ten minute mark, taking a silver medal to the immortal 2112. Featuring many a potent heavy riff, the good folks at Capcom would pinch the riff at 1:02 for a Wily's Castle level in Mega Man 3 (no, not the one you're thinking of). If you're gonna steal, steal from the best I suppose. I suppose lyrically some nerds might complain about the ham-fisted integration of the doomed Cygnus X-1 pilots, but how else would someone be able to survive \"every nerve [being] torn apart?\" Some journalists actually whined that there was no link between the two songs. I guess they must have fallen asleep towards the reprisal of Book 1 around the 12 minute mark. Even if it didn't what we have here is arguably Peart's finest lyrical work, a Greek God gala about how being all brain is equally stupid as the all heart mentality (perhaps a take that punk rock). Balance is the key.\n\nThe next two songs are just about the same side of the short but sweet four minute rocker coin. Circumstances is surprisingly bereft of Lifeson's killer solo work, and The Trees features one of the finest lead breaks the man has ever committed to tape (over a 5/4 time signature no less)! Circumstances instead features a simple keyboard break, which, while certainly no Tom Sawyer lick, is inoffensive enough. Yes, the keyboards are part of this album, but so the fuck what? They accent the rest of the instruments quite well, giving the album that deliciously dreamy 70s atmosphere, and Hemispheres is all the better for it. Both songs feature plenty of Geddy's high wails, which probably aren't going to win him any new fans. Matter of fact this album may feature Geddy's most technically demanding vocal performance yet, causing Dio and Halford to slightly lower their morning newspaper so their brows can take a peak. I personally always viewed Geddy's vocals as a necessary evil to deliver the hooks, melodies and Peart's life lessons to mankind. The business of rock & roll can be quite compromising sometimes.\n\nThen there is the mind-bending masterstroke known as La Villa Strangiato. I love YYZ as much as next punter, but it's not even a contest that this is Rush's finest instrumental work. Every single member turns in a performance of their career, arguably the greatest performance on an instrument on a rock track. It's certainly the case for Neil, who's drumming and percussion runs the emotional gambit from A to a few letters beyond Z that were lost to history beyond the Roman Empire. The sequence from 6:25 to 6:45 is particularly reality altering, I'd say the moment that put the man above both Keith Moon and John Bonham and he'd never look back. On top of all this shredding even get a very rare glimpse into Rush's sense of humor via their pilfering of a riff we've all heard in Looney Toons cartoons around 5:49.\n\nI get that Rush is not everyone's cup of tea, but that doesn't make this album any less quintessential. This is the one Rush album every headbanger must own. Moving Pictures may have the hits, but Hemispheres has the metal. Waste no time in adding this to your collection.\n",
        "\nI've been avoiding this review ever since I first picked up R40, but now I feel that Rush fans need to be warned. This is not a good Rush recording.\n\nThe problem is not the song choice. Rush's tendency for the last decade or so is to provide long, greatest hits retrospective set lists. Everything you would expect is there. The problem is also not the general musicianship, as all the guys hit every mark right on the money.\n\nNo, the problem is Geddy's voice. It just ain't there.\n\nHere's what I think happened. Alex & Geddy being rabid Torontonians, they committed to recording & filming their 40th anniversary live album at the Air Canada Centre, which is sort of the Madison Square Gardens of Canada. They did so thinking that the Toronto stop was about halfway into the tour, so they would have had plenty of time to work out the kinks in the show. They didn't really plan what to do if it didn't work out so well, which it didn't, but were contractually obligated to just go with it.\n\nThat's my speculation. If anyone knows anything about Rush, they knows that these guys are consummate professionals. Neil Peart in particular is famous for being a perfectionist. I don't think they would have released a subpar performance if they didn't have to.\n\nBy now, Rush detractors and apologists alike are both probably stampeding towads the excuse that Geddy hasn't had the high range for quite some time, so what did I expect? That's true enough, but I didn't say his high range wasn't there. I said his voice wasn't there. In any range, on any song. He's warbly and toneless the entire time. As a long time Rush fan, it's actually upsetting to hear.\n\nAnyway, that's all I have to say about it. Anyone can (and probably will) compare & contrast this live performance with their own experiences, so you don't need me to do it. I just wish they had assembled R40 from several stops on the tour, as they have done many times in the past. We might have gotten better takes. I can't shake the feeling that they didn't only because they wanted to record the Toronto shows. Surely one of the greatest live bands ever didn't think this was a worthy performance.\n",
        "\nPink Floyd's Endless River, The Who's Endless Wire, and countless other mediocre albums mark the end of otherwise illustrious careers. A last gasp, and an undignified one at that. (Though it should be noted that The Who has been touring, and doing so pretty well considering their age, since Endless Wire). This is what Clockwork Angels was supposed to be\u2013 numerous decades after the inception of the band, years after Neil Peart first joined, Clockwork Angels was supposed to be a \"goodbye.\" It wasn't supposed to be great, it wasn't supposed to be anything new. \n\nOh, but it was. I consider it the band's magnum opus; the landmark album for all of progressive rock. In fact, I'd go so far as to call it the greatest album of all time, capable of humbling Quadrophenia or Highway 61 Revisited any day of the week. Sounding a lot like a hard and heavy 2112-era album, elements of Clockwork Angels border on nu-metal. For example, BU2B is probably the heaviest Rush song since the seventies, and now that I think about it, Carnies sounds a lot like Slipknot's Surfacing. The admixture of genres, the throwbacks (the hands on the album cover point to 9 and 12, respectively. In military time, that's 21:12) tinged with nostalgia, and the timbre are all perfect. \n\nIndeed, from \"Caravan,\" the very first track, all the way to the end, \"The Garden,\" there is no peccability, no mediocrity, and only greatness. The swinging, mystical title track and its guitar solo is the highlight of the first half of the album\u2013 competing with the epic \"The Anarchist\" for that title\u2013 and \"The Wreckers\" is the best track of the album as a whole, as majestic as \"The Pass\" and as well written as \"2112.\" Every song is heavy, tasteful, and, most importantly, brings something to the table. \n\nGeddy Lee's voice is now lower, Neal Peart is more restrained, and Alex Lifeson has rid himself of some of that self-indulgence that made songs like \"Xanadu\" so great. But on an album this good, who cares? \n\nTo take full inventory of the album would be impossible, though there are a few key facets that are readily observable: Neal Peart is very energetic\u2013listen to The Anarchist or to Wish Them Well\u2013despite being marginally less boisterous. Alex Lifeson still retains his genius of yesteryear, with a Limelight-esque solo on the title cut, hard and heavy riffs on the second disk, and a number of ingenious ostinatos. And let's not forget Geddy Lee, who lays down his best vocal effort since Counterparts and plays his signature heavy-yet-precise bass as well as ever\u2013an achievement to which Headlong Flight and Seven Cities of Gold will attest. \n\nAnd, to end it, all, there's The Garden. The perfect song to end an illustrious career. A ballad with heart-wrenching drums (who even knew that was possible?), the closing lyrics \"It's the measure of a life\" (referring to the treasures\u2013love and respect\u2013that are grown in the garden of life) perfectly end an emotional, soul-searching, and amazing journey of forty years. Not only does The Garden serve as the definitive \"swan song,\" but it also (to the credit of Peart's songwriting ability and plot mastery) ends the story arc of the album's protaginist ably and fittingly. In a way, that once-misguided, once-failing, now-great protagonist epitomizes the band. Rush will live on forever, and The Garden is the perfect song to put the final stamp on that legacy. \n\nThere are some imperfections; perhaps, for example, the low end would be cleaner and more defined with a more encompassing use of compression. Or maybe one could do without the acoustic intro to BU2B. And yet the album is still a beacon of perfection by virtue of being far greater than just the sum of imperfect parts. As a whole, it's perfectly heavy, perfectly bittersweet, perfectly written and composed, perfectly entertaining, perfectly indulgent, perfectly witty and introspective, and perfectly sentimental. 100/100.\n",
        "\nPrior to Permanent Waves, Rush's trademark style involved sprawling twenty minute epics consisting of multiple distinct sections, avant-garde instrumentation, and a sound that, while great, would be considered too \"stoner\" for any radio appeal. While there was a prior flirtation with accessibility, Rush's definitive incarnation involving short, yet musically complex and lyrically cerebral songs had not come close to full fruition until the release of Permanent Waves.\n\nUpon hitting \"play\", one's ears are pleased by Alex Lifeson's instantly recognizable intro to \"Spirit of the Radio\". This song epitomizes mid period Rush. The structure retains some unorthodox elements that make it extremely hard to play on guitar, but there is also a radio friendly element here. Fortunately, it does not overtake the music, and it remains \"progressive\" enough to suit those who enjoyed the band's earlier material. This style does not, however, encompass the whole album. There are epics, such as the heavy, foreboding \"Jacob's Ladder\" and the pinnacle of the album, the multi-sectioned \"Natural Science\" which deserves a paragraph of its own. I will get into that later after describing the music on a general level.\n\nAll three members do an excellent job at expressing their technical abilities. Some of these songs are quite hard to play, be it on guitar, bass, or drums. Despite the complex chord forms and insane drum fills, the band remains impressively coherent and tight. There is not a fuck up of any kind to be found. Technicality aside, some of these melodies are downright awesome, especially the chorus of the underrated quasi-ballad \"Entre Nous\". As I briefly stated in the first paragraph, the lyrics are very cerebral, being philosophical in nature and often quotable. The lyrics of \"Spirit of the Radio\" create an artistic interpretation of the music industry, and demonstrate a heavy degree of self-awareness, pertaining to the band's own desire to create a more radio friendly song. Neil Peart often employs alliteration and creative structuring in his lyrics, which make them all the more interesting to read while listening to the music. The production here is also commendable. It is very artful, almost an instrument in itself.\n\nAs for the epic closer \"Natural Science\", this is one of Rush's greatest pieces. It begins with the drawn out acoustic intro entitled \"Tide Pools\" before transitioning into a badass bridge section, which then gives way to a heavier riff that is very conducting to headbanging. This particular song is one of the reasons why Rush has a page here on Metal Archives. \n\nAs for all of the Rush albums I've heard, I cannot find anything to criticize about Permanent Waves. I often say this and then start bitching about something, but this time, I seriously mean it. This is a perfect album.\n",
        "\nIt's ironic that the cover art is a rock cairn, a navigational landmark used to guide travelers on the right path, because if there's one Rush album that is lost, it's Test for Echo. Unlike Roll the Bones, this album is subpar because there's nothing to like. Roll the Bones mostly failed because of failed experiments, but Test for Echo fails because there's absolutely nothing. It's like Rush woke up at 1 PM on the day of recording, threw some mediocre songs together in twenty minutes, and went to the studio. No Rush album is unlistenable under every possible circumstance (which is a victory for a band that has as many albums as Rush), but Test for Echo has nothing that makes the band great. No experimentation, no exceptional guitar solos, and even the ever-lively rhythm section seems depressed. Driven opens with one of classic rock's most promising intros, but quickly slips into an indifferent mush, while \"Resist\" tries in vain to recapture the magic of ballads such as Losing It and The Pass in a halfhearted, albeit listenable, attempt at shallow emotion. \n\nI suppose I should go through the album, track-by-track. Test for Echo is pretty lively, and is played in a major key, but there\u2019s something about it that sounds like it\u2019s played in a diminished minor. Perhaps it stems from too much gain during the mastering process, maybe from the depressing lyrics (though depressing lyrics have never harmed the quality of Rush\u2019s music in any other circumstance\u20132112, after all, ended in suicide\u2013they do have the effect of being the straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back), but, most likely, it stems from Alex Lifeson\u2019s complete apathy. Neal Peart plays a head-banging double bass groove, and Geddy Lee keeps up pretty well on bass, but the guitar is just boring. Lifeson evidently has nothing more to offer than a power chord progression, a statement which is obviously false, but teeters on truthfulness with respect to this particular album.\n\nNext, the aforementioned Driven. After starting out with a John Petrucci-style metalcore riff to open, the song fades away slowly and painfully. At one point, Geddy Lee sings \u201dDriven on/By the road to somewhere I've never been/But it's my turn to drive\u2026\u201d with no hint of emotion, no hint of escalation, no backup from Alex Lifeson\u2019s guitar (an offense made especially egregious considering that Alex Lifeson has a track record of using his six strings to offset and highlight Lee\u2019s voice\u2013remember Spirit of Radio?), and indifferent hi-hat triplets from Neal Peart. \n\nI\u2019d continue this track-by-track review, but, not only is it depressing, but every song garners the same feedback and merits the exact same criticisms. This is my way of saying that the album has no more to give, just two songs in. Every song sounds like it was written in a diminished minor scale. Every song sounds like there was too much gain used when the album was mastered. Every song has a guitar solo that simply isn\u2019t worth hearing. Every song is poorly written (Dog Years, the lyrics of which I shall not bother to copy and paste here, epitomizes bad decision making in the songwriting process), and every song sounds the exact same. The only song remotely different from the others is Resist, but that\u2019s just because it takes the form of a generic ballad as opposed to the form of a generic rock song. \n\nAt the risk of suddenly changing my tenor from disappointment to praise, I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention that the album is not bad, per se. It\u2019s just incredibly boring, which is surprising coming from the least boring band to ever grace the face of the earth. I\u2019ve listened to albums so bad that I simply had to remove my headphones because I could not withstand the auditory torture. Test for Echo is not one of those albums. In fact, there have been times at which I have gone out of my way to listen to the title cut, or even Resist. That the worst of Rush's plethora of albums is simply unremarkable as opposed to detestable (as many band's worst albums are, such as Green Day's \u00a1Dos! and Pink Floyd's Ummagumma) speaks volumes about the sheer genius that is the trio of Rush. Still, they should've known better than to record such blandness, despite its being better than a solid 90% of albums nowadays. \n\nTest For Echo has everything that makes Rush, Rush, but nothing that makes Rush great. 39/100.\n",
        "\nLook folks, I love, love, LOVE 2112 the song. And you should too, regardless of whether you're a Rush fan or not. This song contains more metal in its glorious 20 minutes than Sad Wings of Destiny's entire 40 minute runtime. Yes there is the Discovery section of the track but you know what? Drawn out as it may be, it serves a goddamn purpose and is not aimlessly wandering around. Man finds guitar, man strums guitar, see how it sings like a sad heart etc. etc. etc. After forty plus years, and Rush have made quite a few revolutionary accomplishments since then, this is still Rush's finest (and most metal) moment. However, it's also the ONLY reason this album sold so well. Side B could have been the exact same track and it wouldn't have affected the album's sales one iota (vinyl was known to scratch rather easily in those days, you never can tell when you'll need a spare album side).\n\nNow I'm not saying that the second half of this is completely bad, or even that it doesn't rock face times. There are definitely some riff driven joints to be found here, the most notable being A Passage to Bangkok and Something For Nothing. That said, when I want to hear these songs, I'll always choose the respective live versions but I'll also admit this is a personal preference (I did hear those versions first). Lessons is ok, but Thin Lizzy would do this time of clean chugging with much more excitement on Jailbreak's Angel From The Coast. The other two, eh even Sabotage had Am I Going Insane. But none of this is just really all that strikingly....metal.\n\nThat's just the thing, really. This is Rush on metal-archives.com, a metal website. There are quite a few so-called hard rock bands that have never and will never make it on here despite their inescapable influence on the genre. It stands to reason that any pioneers with questionable credentials that do get accepted, should be judged by metal standards. An album on this website should be judged as a metal album. Does Rush succeed in places, even albums? Absofuckinglutely. 2112's successive four album streak, keyboards and all, measure up very reasonably as classics to punter standards. As a progressive rock album, 2112 is second place after every single Pink Floyd album from their classic period. But as a metal album, and judged as Rush's most metal moment? It doesn't quite make the grade under the most intense scrutiny. One could certainly argue that Rush never has and never intended to be a heavy metal band, their work acting as consequence rather than active participation. Some of us metal Rush fans like to jokingly refer to them as a heavy/speed metal band cleverly disguised as frumpy dad rock, and that certainly applies to them live for the past two decades. But stacking something like this that's supposed to be hailed as pure power-trio rock along side Machine Head, Sabotage, Stained Class, Rising, The Number of the Beast and even Thunder & Lightning (and Hemispheres)? I just can't call this a heavy metal classic.\n\nYou can't even download the title track on iTunes (as you shouldn't, it's 20 minutes for fuck sake), but you can get 90% complete live version (where Rush are always better anyway) on All The World's A Stage live album. I would pick up that glorious run of A Farewell To Kings through Moving Pictures (possibly even Signals) before snagging this.\n",
        "\nGiven by the number of Rush reviews I've already written, surely you guys might think that I'm nothing more than a raging fanboy to the core who just can't seem to stop singing praises about this band at every instance. Well you wouldn't be wrong, but I'll be damned if this band doesn't deserve it one hundred and ten per cent. I would honestly give anything to have been able to see this band in their prime back in the 70s-80s era just for the sheer contemplative atmosphere that their music generates. That last sentence holds doubly true for this album in particular. On that note, \"Mission\" is one of the most atmospheric songs with some insane vocals and lyrics that most other bands would kill to be able to compose. \n\nEver since their synth era, their subsequent albums have never been only about the guitars, with even the keys and vocals being integrated on an equal basis and this album is no exception on that front. Listen to \"Force Ten\" (what a damn opener with a sublime key break at 1:22 which repeats as the outro), \"Lock And Key\" (the catchiest song on the album with an epic chorus to boot) and \"Time Stands Still\" (one of the best songs on this album with a grandiose bridge section. If you have to hear just one song on this album, let it be this one) to hear the perfect culmination of this sound. \"Turn The Page\" and \"High Water\" are some of the faster songs here with the former almost sounding like a track from their epic Power Windows album featuring some really snappy bass grooves with an explosive chorus.\n\nA lot of fans dismiss this album for supposedly having too many \"cheesy moments\" of the 80s and while I guess that all depends on personal taste, its the fucking good kind of cheese and most certainly not the processed cheesy shit of today's pop music. Then again, it all depends on how open you are to other genres, especially the 80s classic rock sound. That along with a few dashes of pop are the main crux of the overall sound of this album and boy oh boy, does it sound just next level epic along with the pristine production. Then again, that aspect has never been a problem for Rush at all. \"High Water\" is one heck of a closing track with its sublime guitars and infectious vocal lines (just listen to the \"water takes you home\" part) bringing this album to an amazing close. \n\nJust so you know, there are hooks aplenty and EVERY SINGLE SONG will get stuck in your head after a few listens itself. That I guarantee. While most of the hooks are predominantly vocal (duh, it's Geddy Lee what do you expect), there are even a few killer guitar licks that are sure to stick with you the minute you hear them. Check out \"Open Secrets\" (the part at 1:08 which repeats itself at certain parts throughout the song), \"Second Nature\" (the blissful picking part at 1:13 along with the super-catchy vocals) and \"Prime Mover\" (man that intro fucking riff with the clean picking) for further proof, especially on the last song. Simple, yet so amazingly spellbinding in their scope and songwriting finesse to boot. A great deal of bands out there would do well to keep that fact in mind. Take notes people. \n\nI have to say that \"Tai Shan\" is quite the peculiar track overall and while I don' mean it in a bad way as such, it's not quite any of the rest of the songs. With quite the ethereal yet strangely oriental atmosphere as well as the gorgeous keyboard progressions weaved into the echoing guitars, it certainly ranks as one of the strangest songs by Rush. \n\nAs of the most famous quotations out there puts it \"Time is too slow for those who wait, too swift for those who fear, too long for those who grieve, too short for those who rejoice, but for those who love, time is eternity\" Just like this album. Maybe a bold statement but trust me, once you hear the album you'll understand exactly what I mean. Most bands out there have simply not made an album with such an awesome mix of commercial elements as well as their old sound that also sounds so damn good at the same time. A shining gem of an album for any occasion at any time. Take my word for it - keep an open mind and you are in for one hell of a treat.\n",
        "\n\"Rush\" is the self-titled debut studio album by hard rock/progressive rock band Rush. Today Rush is practically a household name for most fans of rock music, as they are extremely well-known for ground-breaking albums like \"2112\" and \"Moving Pictures\", but they didn't start out making complex heavy rock/metal epics and coming up with fascinating and philosophical lyrical themes. \n\nThe music heard here is primarily heavy blues rock not dissimilar to bands like Led Zeppelin and Foghat. The lyrics are also what you would expect from a release like this, being about love and daily life as heard in songs like 'Working Man'. There is some variation with songs like 'Here Again', 'Working Man' and 'What You're Doing', while all three are still bluesy the former takes a much slower pace with some dark power chords. 'What You're Doing', which is one of my favorite songs on the album, has some really great heavy riffing. 'Working Man' is another favorite and a crushingly heavy song (For 1974), and certainly what I'd call an early heavy metal song.\n\nAlex Lifeson already conducts some really sweet riffs and solos, just take a listen to almost any song on the album and try not to have the riffs get stuck in your head. Listening to the dark heavy riffing of 'Working Man' makes it easy to see why it's the most popular from the album. Geddy Lee's vocals are great too, being able to sound aggressive at times despite having a higher-pitched vocal range. One big difference from this album and the following releases, is that this album features original drummer John Rutsey instead of the famous Neil Peart. Peart is a fantastic drummer, but Rutsey really deserves some attention too. While not as complex as Peart, he gives some really impressive drum work on the album, especially on 'Before and After', which is probably my favorite from the album.\n\nOverall, this is one great debut album. While it has some weak moments, ('In the Mood' sounds like a rejected Aerosmith song), most of the songs on this debut are not only fantastic heavy blues/rock songs but also a great start for one of the most innovative bands in hard rock. If you're a fan of early heavy blues rock, this makes for one hell of a listen.\n\nAttribution: http://www.metalmusicarchives.com/review/rush/318863\n",
        "\nMaybe I'm in the minority, but I love transitional albums. They're a great window into the development of a band's sound as they move between styles (if they're inclined to do so), and are often the most interesting simply due to the fact they don't sound like a band sitting on an established sound. Rush being a band that continually evolved and never made the same album twice, their transitional periods are twice as interesting. Especially when they're actually a bit of a mixed bag, like this album.\n\nReleased at the tail end of the 80s, Presto finds Rush moving between the synth dominated, highly complex tech-pop of Power Windows and Hold Your Fire and the more streamlined arena rock sound of Roll The Bones, which eventually lead into the harder rock sound of Counterparts onward which defined the band's sound for pretty much the rest of their career. Hold Your Fire was essentially the logical conclusion of the sound that had begun on Grace Under Pressure and exploded into cinematic technicolour on Power Windows, and was then refined to its limit on Hold Your Fire. I don't think they could have taken it any further, and it's no real surprise that Presto finds Rush heavily dialing back the keyboards, returning Alex Lifeson's guitar to the forefront, and bringing back a more solid riff-driven power trio sound with (relatively speaking) simpler song structures and a greater focus on hooks. \n\nThe results? Mixed, though mostly outstanding. I'm a huge Rush fan, of the 80s era in particular, and frankly there are a handful of dull songs on the album. Thankfully the first half of Presto is pretty much all gold. \"Show Don't Tell\", with it's rapid fire bursts of choppy riffing, immediately sets the tone for the album and highlights the greater emphasis of space in the arrangements and features some brilliantly melodic bass playing. \"The Pass\" is Rush's attempt at a ballad, and is a great success thanks to it's moving lyrics and a great performance topped by a brilliant vocal. It's worth pointing out that Geddy Lee probably never sounded better vocally than on this album. His voice having long since lost the high pitched wail, he's aged like a fine wine and sings with a slightly lower pitch that really fits the material. \"Scars\" is my favourite track, and one of the most atypical Rush songs: a slightly dorky synth funk bass sits on top of a dense and hypnotic African sounding dance beat, topped off with heavily processed bursts of stratospheric guitar and leads that soar over everything like a high desert wind. It's a startlingly effective song that sounds like nothing else in Rush's long discography. \n\nThere's a few duds, however. I never really got into \"Hand Over Fist\" or \"Red Tide\", which sound kind of like Rush-by-numbers to me. \"War Paint\" had to really grow on me, and I do quite like it now. Fortunately that's about it. The title track is another great song which I feel is really underrated, if not a little saccharine. \"Superconductor\" sounds like Rush sarcastically trying to write a hit (with some quite witty lyrics about manufactured rock stars) but this is still too complex to be top 10 material. It's still one of the most catchy songs they've ever written. The album closes on a great note with \"Available Light\", which went over my head a bit at first but has now really grown on me. Sonically the album sounds brilliant. The production is bright, open and highlights every nuance, and the remastered version is full and punchy without sacrificing too much dynamic range (all the Rush albums were very well remastered, in fact). Performance wise the band are on top form. Geddy's bass, both playing and tone, was at it's best in this era in my opinion and on Presto reaches it's peak. Lifeson is clearly enjoying being given more opportunity to just rock out and play some great guitar riffs as opposed to more textural splashes, though those do still show up in places. As mentioned the keyboards are heavily dialed back, though they do make appearances here and there for texture's sake. Neil Peart is Neil Peart. The guy's a brilliantly inventive drummer and offers some of his best lyrics for this album.\n\nThere are few Rush heads out there who would recommend an album like this one to a new listener. It's just not the most obvious choice. I might, though, and not merely to be contrary. Presto is a great rock album with catchy songs, and enough of an emphasis on less keyboards to not scare off any fans who think the mid-80s era was too much. It's also an underrated album that doesn't really get the credit it's due, and an important cornerstone in Rush's artistic development.\n",
        "\nSandwiched between Power Windows and Signals, a lot of fans have pointed out that this album pretty much has the best of both worlds making it more accessible if you will - the more commercial aspects and 80s rock of Hold Your Fire along with the shimmering synth soundscapes and strong songwriting aspects of Signals /Power Windows as well. That's one of the main reasons why this album is awesome and more. Even if you disliked the more commercial/80s sounds of either albums there is still a chance that you will like this one. Of course, keeping an open mind is the key especially when you're talking about the 80s era of the band. One of the main complaints from detractors about 80s era Rush is the fact that the guitar is toned down in favour of the synth and while I really don't find that a problem in the least, concerning the detractors the ratio is almost 50:50 here, so no worries. \n\nUnlike the previous albums, the hooks are buried even deeper and only multiple listens will reward you with the catchy aspects of Rush that we're all too familiar with by now. The synth just sounds gorgeous and with the silken guitar lines and riffs just scream magnificent from every angle. Be it the beautiful melancholy of \"Afterimage\" (the \"this is something that just can't be understood\" vocal line is bound to get stuck in your head) or the almost disco vibe of the keys in the background on the brilliant \"Red Sector A\" (a true lesson in how to absolutely nail dynamics in prog music along with some of the best lyrics the band has ever written - \"Are we the last ones left alive? Are we the only human beings to survive?\" - well it was the year 1984 after all) not to mention the slow shifting groove and funk of \"The Enemy Within\" and \"The Body Electric\" as well as the slow catchy vibe of the closer \"Between The Wheels\" (the synth patches are simply godly on this one) with its sublime and awe-inspiring subtle use of multiple melodies being weaved together. Geddy Lee simply kills it with vocals lines we can only dream of. Of course all the songs are awesome, but I'll let you figure out the other songs for ourselves. The guitar here undoubtedly gets to occupy the podium a lot more than the previous two releases (only by a small, but noticeable margin) with some groovy funk influences as well as the riffs being tighter and more naturally integrated with the synth template of the band. Of course, the drums are simply amazing with Peart doing his groove-laden syncopated fills and kicks welded into his traditional prog approach that we all love him for. \n\nAfter all this if you still must ask whether you should get this album, you may kindly exit this page and leave the really good music to others out there. This is freaking Rush we're talking about and if you happen to be a classic rock/ prog or hard rock fan, the question of owning the album shouldn't even arise in the first place. Of course you will have your own personal favourites, but every single song stand out with no exceptions. Absolutely essential, just like most of their other albums throughout their discography spanning more than four frigging decades overall. Now just how many bands can you say the same about? This band is truly peerless and Grace Under Pressure only drives that point home.\n",
        "\nAmong the back catalogue of Rush ( the pre-Moving Pictures era, of course) this one still gets the maximum number of plays even after all these years. Even though I consider myself more of a fan of their mid-era rather than their prog rock era of the late 70s, this one sits right on top with all the classics of the prog rock genre, even surpassing a few of them. While I recognize the fact that I\u2019m probably in the minority thinking that 2112 and Caress Of Steel are quite overblown and unmemorable despite having their moments of glory, the band clearly seem to have learned from their mistakes with this masterpiece. \n\nNonetheless this was definitely not an album I loved after the first listen or even the fifth for that matter. All the tracks took a while to grow, especially the last song \u201cCygnus X-1\u201d which I initially dismissed as being too overlong for its own good throwing the balance of the album off, but now . I was initially quite surprised with the industrialized (?) intro of the song, but on reading the lyrics with the spoken voice at the beginning, I understood the reason why. This song tells a story about Till the base picks up by the 2nd minute the atmosphere is quite unsettling to say the least. Then around the 7:30 minute, the song travels down a much darker realm than Rush is known for with some haunting textures, only to descend into a flurry of violent (for Rush, at least) riffs with some screechy vocals towards the end fading out with echo-laden strummed chords. Strange indeed, but it does grown on you. It does have some really fascinating vocals and lyrics talking about the thoughts of a captain flying his spaceship directly into a black hole. Quite fascinating actually. One tip thought - you\u2019ll really need to turn the volume up to catch on all the subtleties of the song plus proper headphones are DEFINITELY needed for this song. No two ways about that. Sure it\u2019s not as good as Xanadu, but it\u2019s good enough in its own right. Also you\u2019re more likely to dig this song if you follow the lyrics with the music. \n\nThe intro of the title track should be enough to convert you if nothing else with its beautiful acoustic picking. Or even the beautiful build-up/ebb and flow of the monstrous \u201cXanadu\u201d exploding into an awesome guitar lead around the 2nd minute of the song which repeats before shooting straight to the main chorus riff only to lead into a brilliant keyboard part at the start of the 6th song building up to a phenomenally simple set of riffs. Hands down one of the best prog rock songs I\u2019ve ever heard. Yes my list of \u201cFavourite prog (both rock and metal) songs above the 10 minute mark\u201d is a long one no doubt, but rest assured this song is right up there at the very top 10 of my list throughout all these years. Just a testament to flawless songwriting, which is arguably what Rush is all about. \u201cCinderella Man\u201d also sees Geddy Lee effortlessly balancing the high range of his vocals with a combo of the mid and low range. \n\nWhile their previous albums had heavy doses of prog, the songwriting didn\u2019t seem to be concise enough for my liking. Yes, the instrumental parts were impeccable (this is Rush we\u2019re talking about after all) but in their previous epics, a lot of the parts just seem to wander about never really coming to an eventual refrain or final point. And no, by that statement I don\u2019t mean catchy choruses and whatnot, but simply a clear lack of truly memorable moments. Now this release not only merges the twin sounds of the keys and guitar, but also experiments with different sound textures on both the instruments creating loud and soft parts, as opposed to their earlier releases when the guitars and keys were rather one-dimensional in comparison. Then again, that\u2019s not always a bad thing. \u201cCloser To The Heart\u201d just like \u201cTom Sawyer\u201d, has an unbelievably amazing combination of prog elements and straightforward rock making it a hit even among the non-fans of the band. Hell I even know a couple of my friends who detest prog and still happen to like this song, so clearly that says something. \n\nFor all you die-hard prog fans, having this album is a no brainer. However if you are a newcomer to the sound of Rush, I\u2019d suggest you start with Moving Pictures or Signals and subsequently work your way back from there. In either case you need this album. As simple as that.\n",
        "\nAs most of you already know, this album is smack in the middle of the band\u2019s synth era. Now many fans are split in the middle about all their albums succeeding Moving Pictures/ Permanent Waves and not to get into that debate whatsoever, but I will say this - For those of you who want the more complex side of Rush, this album is probably not going to sit too well with y\u2019all considering how straightforward this is in comparison to their previous works. The prog elements are there no doubt, but are very subtle and shift with the dynamics of the music. The crystal clean and clear production with every instrument painting its own image forming the overall sound is definitely one of the best I\u2019ve ever heard on a rock/prog rock album and the usage of dynamics between the keys and the guitar are simply stunning, creating a sprawling cascading landscape of sound with a generous helping of floating reverb and delay. I swear most of the times when I hear these guys (and especially this album) I can\u2019t help but ask myself \u201cHow the heck are they a 3-piece band and so goddamn good?!\u201d The overall sound is just so magnificent and the songwriting is just on another plane of existence clearly not meant for us mere mortals. Take my word for it: we are truly not worthy. Also the synth sounds of the 80s classic rock scene are in the forefront so if you\u2019re not an 80s classic rock fan, there is little chance of you liking this album at all. Just saying. \n\nThe first song that I had heard off this album was the almighty \u201cMystic Rhythms\u201d and quite honestly I was blown away by the song from the first listen itself. The amazing shifting beats paired with the booming bass lines, the gorgeous keyboard build-up along with the killer guitars and the soaring vocals, how the goddamn hell can anyone not love this song?? Geddy Lee\u2019s voice here is truly something to behold. Simply magnificent and grand in every sense of the word and EVERY SINGLE vocal line in each of the songs will get stuck in your head eventually. Believe it or not. Also, naming standouts on this album is almost impossible because they just keep switching every 2-3 weeks! I\u2019m not even remotely kidding about that one. The most underrated song has to be \u201cMarathon\u201d with its stupendous chorus \u201cfrom first to last, the peak is never passed\u201d and the almost balladish \u201cMiddletown Dreams\u201d is simply epic with guitar licks and vocal lines to die for. Listen to the slow almost orchestral build-ups in the intros of \u201cTerritory\u201d and \u201cEmotion Detector\u201d (with some of the best keyboard playing on the album) and be absolutely wowed by the bands remarkable ability to craft such monumental soundscapes and rhythms with such ease and grace. Don\u2019t worry, I can see you consistently pick your jaw up from the floor by the end of each song. Also Neil Peart adopts a very unique drumming style on this album, being a superb mix of both the loose experimental prog style and the super tight drumming that he has always been known for with plenty of thunderous snare hits and rolls and light dynamic fills. This album only solidifies that fact that he is undoubtedly one of the greatest skinsmen out there. \n\nAlong with \u201cHold Your Fire\u201d this is definitely one of Rush\u2019s most accessible works and can pretty much appeal to both the (read: open-minded) metal fan and avid music lover alike. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I totally get the fact that (initially) for a lot of the hardcore fans, it can be quite hard to open up to the synth dominant template of 80s Rush. However I would still say, give this record some serious time and effort and you will definitely see the sheer brilliance of the music here. You can trust me on that one. \n\nAnd of course, who can forget the iconic \u201cManhattan Project\u201d. Apart from being one of the best songs I\u2019ve ever heard with one heck of a catchy chorus, the lyrics are actually introspective, thoughtful and almost ironically mocking in their delivery talking about the dangers of the atomic bomb and the Cold War.\n\nThe big bang\nTook and shook the world\nShot down the rising run\nThe hopeful depend\nOn a world without end\nWhatever the hopeless may say\n\nFinal verdict? Die-hard Rush fan or not, if you consider yourself a fan of good music in general, there is absolutely no excuse for you not owning this album. As simple as that. Now bugger off and listen to it by whichever means possible.\n",
        "\nThis album is notorious among Rush fans for not just going down the poppy synth road, but taking the full freakin' plunge into synthville. If you ask the most hardcore of neck beard possessing elitists, they'll swear up and down that this album sucks. But deep inside they know they like it, deep inside their cold lonely hearts, the power of the synth compels them to secretly like this album. They can't help but wait until one o'clock in the morning to put on \"Time Stand Still\" and sit in awe as it brings tears to their bloodshot eyes. Basically what I'm trying to say is that this album is inferior to the 70's Rush albums, but it has a memorable and inviting charm that hammers it home. The creativity and musicianship is still here, it is just used in a different manner.\n\nFor the biggest progressive rock bands of the 1970's, the 1980's was a maelstrom of fancy new synthesizers and musical technology that one just couldn't simply not try out. Those that did try out synthesizers, electronic drums, and what have you were completely enveloped in what was the \"cool\" sound of the day. Rush is arguably one of the worst cases, as Rush hopped onto the train to synthville pretty quickly. After three absolutely mind-blowing records and two decent ones, Rush's synth war machine unleashed this - Hold Your Fire. This album is primarily led by synthesizers and a crisp, bright guitar from Alex. The album is coated in a thick layer of atmosphere that makes for a really inviting and musically thick listen. Then again, I listen to music for the music, not the atmosphere, and the album severely suffers in this regard. \n\nWhen I was first becoming a Rush fan, I hated this album with a passion. I couldn't believe that the trio that gave me \"Natural Science\" and \"Hemispheres\" would do this. A few years later, I have learned to appreciate the later Rush albums. My opinion has risen significantly of this one in particular. The poppy 80's synth soundscape combined with a masterful rhythm section and a handful of really memorable songs make this quite the enjoyable experience. Don't get me wrong, there are some absolute barf-worthy throwaway tracks here, like \"Second Nature\" or the embarrassingly terrible \"Tai Shan\"; but the straightforward, ethereal nature of \"Time Stand Still\", \"Prime Mover\", \"Lock and Key\", and \"Turn the Page\" make for a seriously enjoyable set of songs. Rush's ridiculously masterful talent allows them to make brilliance out of pop rock, and this album starts to show a few decent colors after a good bit of listening. \n\nThe musicianship is probably at one of the lowest in Rush's history. This isn't exactly saying much, as two of these guys are considered the best of all time at their instruments and the other is an absolute master of the six string (and twelve!). With a musical palette that consists of prog-rooted pop rock coated in synths, there isn't much room for everybody to stretch their musical legs. Alex's guitar playing consists mostly of shiny arpeggios and reverb soaked chords, while Neil focuses on driving the song along rather than making use of masterful drumming techniques. Geddy sings wonderfully on this album, and it's clear he has mastery of his voice on this album. Similarly his bass playing is utterly fantastic as usual, but far more melodic. He tends to lead the songs along with his lead bass lines rather than chugging with angry bass tone (but oh how I love gritty angry bass tone). In the grand scheme of things, it's Ged who is the star of this show, but as a whole this is one of Rush's weaker musical outings. \n\nOverall, Hold Your Fire is nothing to write home about, unless synth coated proggy pop rock is your favorite genre of music. This album is nothing compared to their 70's material, but it still is a very enjoyable album deserving of a few spins here and there. The decadent atmosphere of this album really makes for a soothing and uplifting listen, but it is necessary to skip a few of these ridiculously lame tracks. With the exception of those, this isn't bad at all. I would recommend this to only those who adore Rush, and if you put this on expecting Hemispheres you're in for a rude awakening. \n\nOh yeah, and \"Prime Mover\" is one of the most beautiful songs Rush ever played. If you disagree then fight me.\n",
        "\nWhat. An. Album. Seriously just when you think that there\u2019s no way in hell, Rush could possibly have any more tricks (read classics) up their sleeve, along comes this dazzling masterpiece. How the heck do they keep doing it?? Anyways enough hyperbole, let\u2019s get down to the review. Just so you know unlike their earlier albums, this album did take a while to grow on me. But then again, that is the beauty of some of the best music out there. Only by the 4th or 5th listen will the little details reveal themselves and so on. \n\nThe amazing synths really add another magnificent layer of sound to the album as a whole and clearly without them, the album would not have the charm it did. That should be fairly evident from the very intro of \u201cSubdivisions\u201d including the almost speculatively mournful midsection at 2:15. For those of you who think they are too \u2018cheesy\u2019 and don\u2019t belong in metal, kindly stop reading right now and don\u2019t bother. Also the first thing that jumps out at you is that there is much more to this album than straightforward prog rock as all of you know, Rush left that approach behind on their last album Moving Pictures in any case. Sufficient to say, if you\u2019re still expecting more of the same this time, you\u2019ll be quite disappointed. However if you\u2019re willing to broaden your horizons and give this album a chance, you will be rewarded. Of course, repeated listening is the key. I for one am more than happy with the new direction their music took. As other reviewers have already pointed out before, there are hints of pop, new wave music and reggae (\u201cThe Digital Man\u201d) which works marvellously enhancing the diversity of the music even more. The emphasis is more on to-the-point rockers on a song-by-song basis rather than sprawling progressiveness of their previous era. Instead prog is one of the ingredients of this dish compared to being the main component of the music. Also rather than being used separately on their previous album, Rush have integrated both the guitar and the synths/keys into a powerhouse of a rhythm section along with the groovy spiralling drumming providing a lot of syncopation. \n\nEvery single song has something special be it the epic chorus of \u201cThe Analog Kid\u201d (\u201cYou move me\u201d part is just fucking epic) the simple complexity of \u201cChemistry\u201d the amazing melodic intro of \u201cThe Weapon\u201d played out again in the chorus and the lovely vocal lines of \u201cNew World Man\u201d. If you look at it in terms of progressiveness, yeah sure it doesn\u2019t touch their previous albums, but in terms of sheer enjoyment and replay ability the album does stand proudly with the giants. Geddy Lee\u2019s vocals sound different (in a good way) with him exploring the greater depth of his mid-range instead of his high pitched vocals on the previous albums making for some gorgeous and lush vocal harmonies and arrangements. Even the lyrics are way better than anything I\u2019ve heard from the genre in a while being both introspective and simple, yet driving the point home. Take a look at these lyrics from \u201cLosing It\u201d. Heartbreakingly true about most of our lives, just getting stuck in the wheels of society on a daily basis, being unable to think about what we really want for ourselves. Hands down, one of the best songs on the album. \n\nSome are born to move the world\nTo live their fantasies\nBut most of us just dream about\nThe things we'd like to be\nSadder still to watch it die\nThan never to have known it\nFor you, the blind who once could see\nThe bell tolls for thee...\n\nIf you are a newbie to the sound of Rush or just an open-minded rock/metal fan, this would be a good place to start. A fantastic and unique album that truly grows on you with every listen. Highly recommended.\n",
        "\n\"All the same we take our chances\nLaughed at by time!\nTricked by circumstances!\nPlus \u00e7a change\nPlus c'est la meme chose\nThe more that things change,\nthe more they stay the same\"\n\nThis unrivaled piece of music has captivated me since my first encounter with it. There is nothing like Hemispheres. No piece of art resonates with me on a greater level than this - what I consider the apex of rock music and all of its offshoots. These are words that are no doubt based solely on opinion, but to me there is nothing like this. I know of zero faults with this album in its absolute entirety. There is a select handful of albums that I consider flawless, but there is nothing that keeps this level of musical and lyrical quality for its entire running time quite like Hemispheres does. Frighteningly genius lyricism, musical dexterity that is unrivaled, and songwriting that is the definition of pure talent. Do you want to know what I consider the best? This right here - Rush's 1978 masterwork: Hemispheres. \n\nAll joyous, fanboyish enthusiasm aside, this is utter brilliance in its most spectacular form. The album is built upon a foundation that is immortal, marble white and purest gold. The prodigious talent that blossomed on 2112 and the artistic mastery that showed up on A Farewell To Kings all come together on this album. Neil's lyricism is undoubtedly at its apex, while the band's musical prowess is at a level untouched by any others. Neil's drumming on this album is hailed as some of the greatest of all time, and drummers of all walks of life cherish the day that they could finally drum along to this album, just ask them. Geddy's bass playing here is some of the greatest ever recorded; this album has massive influence on my bass playing, and I owe it at least a quarter of my technique. \n\nAlex's guitar playing is at its apex as well. All of his influences and styles swirl together in sheer beauty on this record. His classic rock upbringings combine with his bluesy, abstract twists to make for an undeniably adept and unique force. His classical explorations bring a lot to the table as well; who can forget the legendary intro to \"The Trees\" or the sheer brilliance of \"La Villa Strangiato\"? As Alex's string wizardry hit its true level of mastery, Geddy tapped into his edgy yet strikingly melodic vocal cords to find that perfect balance between beautiful highs mixed with a frightful aggression to propel the music along. All of the musicianship present is undeniably brilliant. If anyone shall have fault with this, it is with the composition, not the musical prowess. \n\nThe songwriting on Hemispheres is downright befuddling. The album's recurring them is balance, and there is balance not only lyrically, but musically. A common finger pointed at progressive rock is the finger claiming it to be pretentious and too self-indulgent. The term \"wankery\" is often used. I am a massive fan of the progressive rock genre, and let me tell you - it can get pretentious as hell. This said, there is no such \"wankery\" present. Every passage is used to its maximum potential while never overextending itself; the flow of this is just fabulous. Even during the riskiest part of the entire album, which is during the title track in part V, the soft, keyboard driven interlude is used to its maximum effect and helps propel the song into its outstanding finale.\n\nUnless someone told you otherwise, you would not think that this album was recorded in a remote countryside of Wales. This is one of Rush's absolute best albums when it comes to production. Everything is clear and crisp while retaining that classy timbre that is associated with prog rock. Alex's guitar shimmers and glitters when need be, but it offers a thick wall of sound when necessary. Geddy's bass tone on Hemispheres is legendary. The exquisite growl of the Rickenbacker comes alive here, offering one of the best bass tones ever created. The vocals, the drums, and all of the strings are mixed fabulously, and keyboards never interrupt the music; they only add to the atmosphere that the album is going for. Overall, this is one of the best sounding productions that you'll hear. Rush and Terry always did an excellent job, and this album is no exception. \n\nThe amount of talent that is poured into this legendary record is almost unbelievable. Each musical passage is just exquisitely crafted yet possessive of a power that shakes you to your core. There are albums out there, of all genres and styles, that will give me the chills and fill me with emotion and energy. Usually it is one song or even two that achieve this, but Hemispheres leaves me in absolute awe for every second of its being. Whether it be the magical interlude of \"The Trees\" or the riveting aggression of \"Circumstances\" or the narrative genius of the title track, this is just unrivaled musical mastery of the highest caliber. Never will a simple riff be used, or a simple plodding bass line; every instrument and fill is used to its highest possible potential. Any flashier and it would come across as too much, and more subdued and the true potential is stifled. The album speaks of balance, and it happens to be a record in which musical ability and songwriting excellence are balanced together in a perfect sphere. Coincidence? I think not. \n\nWhen I listen to rock music, I generally will give lackluster or cliche lyrics a pass, as they usually won't bother me unless it's just childish. Whenever a song or album crosses me with lyrics that are literary gold, I do get excited. As a l am a lover of eloquent lyrical passages and masterful poetry, an album with great lyrics is a splendid bonus to me. Hemispheres is not just good lyrically, it is utterly amazing. The lyrics to this album are worthy to be published and released as a short collection of poetry; and I'd buy it. Heck, the title track was even made into a freaking comic book. It's that good of a narrative. Hemispheres has the consistency and coherence of a concept album, but with each track standing out as a masterpiece. The lyrics of \"Circumstances\" serve as a song of understanding for any confused and neglected person who dares go up against reality. \"The Trees\" can serve either as a simple tale of trees feuding, or a deep account of slavery, oppression, rebellion, justice, and what have you. \n\nThe title track gives a story that is summed up in its prelude: \n\n\"When our weary world was young,\nthe struggle of the ancients first began\nThe gods of Love and Reason\nsought alone to rule the fate of Man\nThey battled through the ages,\nbut still neither force would yield\nThe people were divided\nEvery soul a battlefield\"\n\nThe song goes on to chronicle the tale of how humanity followed each of the god, one of love, and one of reason, and their subsequent battles would render the world \"torn asunder into hollow hemispheres\". The tale goes on and is resolved at the ending sections, and I urge those who haven't heard this masterpiece to experience it now. For a single man to write this, and for three people to write and play the music within just transcends any other level hit by other bands. I'm sorry, but not even \"2112\" was this good. That is saying a LOT too. Like I said earlier, the level of musicianship is worthy of the title of perfection, but for this to be on a lyrical and intellectual level as such is a bonus rarely bestowed upon the listener. \n\nThe album features three opuses of musical and lyrical radiance, but also an instrumental track deemed so difficult that not even Rush themselves could record it in one take. That alone should tell you how insane this is. The song features a myriad of musical sections, from fast licks and bass lines to some of the most insane percussive mastery that Neil would ever weave. The center section of \"La Villa Strangiato\", in which the song calms down to allow Alex's sweet guitar work sing is just ethereal. By far one of the greatest guitar-led interludes ever recorded. The song then explodes with a multiple of unique rhythms and licks (including one of the most ridiculous freaking bass solos ever, I swear Geddy put that in there for the sole purpose of keeping me from covering this, sheesh) before covering the familiar sections played at the beginning. \n\n\"La Villa Strangiato\" finishes the album with a flurry of drums and bass, before it's over and you immediately flip it over and listen again, and again and again, because this does not get old. This album only gets better as you discover more nuances and licks that blow your mind. I eagerly look forward to the day in which I own a 4003 (or 4001) so I can cover this in its entirety. Hemispheres serves as the apex of rock musical achievements, and I've yet to hear something come even close to touching it. If you are a lover of music, no matter what style or genre, this album is a must listen for you. Period. When I first heard this, I couldn't believe what I was hearing. \n\nWhether Rush knows it or not, they crafted the closest possible thing to musical perfection with this record. There is not a weak moment to be found. I cannot stress just how completely awesome this album is. It brings forth boundless emotion, it's creative, it's memorable, it's just... brilliant. The perfect sphere. Ladies and gentlemen, you can't beat this. If you have not yet heard this, I strongly urge you to do so. Hemispheres is the be all end all for me when it comes to rock music. Nothing resonates with me like this does. I just cannot even come close to describing how ridiculously good this is. This is an absolute freaking masterpiece. \n\nWith that, here is the most beautiful finale ever recorded: '\"The Sphere\" A Kind of Dream\"'\n\n\"We can walk our road together\nif our goals are all the same\nWe can run alone and free\nif we pursue a different aim\nLet the Truth of Love be lighted\nLet the Love of Truth shine clear\nSensibility, armed with sense and liberty\nWith the Heart and Mind united in a single... perfect... sphere\"\n",
        "\nWhen I talk to my friends and family members who grew up listening to heavy metal and hard rock music through the early 70's, I'll always ask them for stories about the heavy music back then. They'll say that among the 70's metalheads, Led Zeppelin were overrated, Deep Purple was the best thing ever, and when I ask them about Caress of Steel, they say it was one of the most badass albums when it came out (2112 pretty much blew their minds, but let's focus on this one). Apparently something like \"Bastille Day\" was absolutely insane in 1975, let alone a song like \"The Necromancer\" or the twenty minute \"The Fountain of Lamneth\". \n\nToo many people judge Caress of Steel from the standpoint of 2112, and forget to realize that without the pioneering done on this record, 2112 might not have happened. Even if you completely take away all historical importance from this album, it's still a pretty awesome record. 2112 this is not, but this album has a sense of unbridled aggression in tandem with a value of beauty that rarely showed up on other Rush albums. You've got the sheer anger of \"Bastille Day\", the down-to-earth beauty of \"Return of the Prince\" and \"Lakeside Park\", even the carefree rocker that is \"I think I'm Going Bald\". Even if the songwriting had yet to fully blossom, the musicianship here is top notch.\n\nThe A side of this record is the best part, as it has not only \"The Necromancer\", but it opens with freaking \"Bastille Day\". \"Bastille Day\" is one of Rush's most aggressive tracks of the 70's featuring a set of riffs that'll more than destroy your face hole and a rhythm section that still rivaled work from 10 years later. Oh yeah, and not to mention Geddy's wicked vocals! This album is one of the best Geddy's voice has seen, with both a great use of range and an ear splitting aggression that makes you bang your head and grit your teeth. Even the silliest song on the album, \"I Think I'm Going Bald\", has a gritty, heavy, riff happy feel to it that makes it an enjoyable song. \"The Necromancer\" is really freaking awesome, it takes a long time for it to grow on you, but just listen to the section called \"Return of the Prince\"; you can thank me later. \"Return of the Prince\" is my favorite part of the whole record, this song sings to your soul; just beautiful.\n\nSide B of Caress of Steel is home of one twenty minute epic track entitled \"The Fountain of Lamneth\". This part of the record is great too, but it does take a while to get going. This song is sort of a blueprint for \"2112\", it's split into a handful of different movements with different intensities. The song also stretches the legs of Rush's narrative songwriting, which is something I adore about this band. The song is generally strong, but it suffers from a lack of continuity. Each section is separated from its neighboring section by too much silence or interluding. Don't get me wrong, long tracks are always the best when they are written flawlessly, but I can't help but feel as if \"The Fountain of Lamneth\" would've benefited from being separated into six different songs. All that being said, \"The Fountain of Lamneth\" is a definite high in Rush's career, and it marked a point in which they were exploring more and more musically. \n\nThe strengths of \"The Fountain of Lamneth\", however, are extremely evident, and naysayers should keep listening, as there is some musical gold found here. The soft, acoustic-led passages are all amazing, and Geddy's soft singing is a perfect conveyance of the narrative lyrics. The most aggressive sections of this song are quite progressive in nature and they show off Rush's early dexterity in handling tight musical situations. The best sections of \"The Fountain of Lamneth\" are definitely \"Panacea\" and \"Bacchus Plateau\" whose upbeat natures are just fantastic; I wish they were longer. As a whole, \"The Fountain of Lamneth\" pales when compared to \"2112\", \"Hemispheres\" or \"Natural Science\", but one must remember this was accomplished at a relatively early stage in Rush's career, and the song stands on its own as a true work of art. \n\nThe musicianship is fantastic, as it is on every Rush album. Neil's drumming began to really take shape on Caress of Steel, as was his lyricism. Neil makes frequent use of outstanding fills and unique rhythms, and they helped prove that Neil would soon be heralded as the greatest drummer of all time. Geddy's bass was also taking shape into the heavy, loud, and gritty tone that would dominate the later 70's Rush records. His tone is still somewhat hollow, but it is much louder than on the previous albums and Ged allows his Ricky to flex its muscles. His playing is also more pronounced, using many more bass fills and quick runs. The furious bass playing of \"Bastille Day\" rips through your ears with its complex fills and gritty attack. The rest of the album also features this style, and it's quite interesting listening to Geddy's bass tone caught in the middle of the early 70's and late 70's Rush eras. \n\nThe star of the show for this album is Alex Lifeson. The gritty, gain-choked guitar tone present on this album is much more suited here than it was on 2112, actually. All of Alex's guitar solos are fantastic, especially those on \"Bacchus Plateau\" and \"Return of the Prince\". The riffs Alex plays are all heavy and driving; another thing that makes this album a bit unique. When Alex isn't playing sweet melodies, he's playing heavy, almost metal tinged swinging riffs that propel things along in an awesome fashion. I've always loved Alex's playing on this album, it really is top notch. \n\nCaress of Steel really shouldn't be judged in comparison to 2112. Why so many people do this I know not why, but the album really isn't a mess, it's not annoying, it's not weak; it's just a necessary step Rush had to take. In my opinion, the results are fabulous, the album is home to some brilliant musicianship and lyricism. Sure, \"I Think I'm Going Bald\" might be Rush's second most ridiculous song lyric-wise, but there's also \"The Necromancer\", \"Bastille Day\" and \"The Fountain of Lamneth\". It's safe to say the good totally overtakes the bad here. I wouldn't recommend this be a newcomer's first Rush listen, but it definitely deserves some attention. In the end, Caress of Steel is a very strong album deserving of more recognition and praise than it gets. \n\n\"But they're marching to Bastille Day\nLa guillotine will claim her bloody prize!\nFree the dungeons of the innocent\nThe king will kneel, and let his kingdom rise!\"\n",
        "\nInfamous prog rock legends Rush never had an easy ride in their early years. They began as a hard rock band with incredible potential, and it did indeed take them a few albums before they struck brilliance. A short ways down the road, after the rather ambitious (but not bad) Caress of Steel, they faced trouble with the record company who wanted them to avoid the complex song structures, unique lyrics, and the like associated with Rush now. The Canadian prodigies didn't heed these warnings, and went all out on their 1976 masterpiece, 2112. \n\nYou could say that this was the album in which Rush found their sound, so to speak. Many consider this their magnum opus, while I disagree; this record is pure brilliance. Rush proved that they weren't just some Canadian rock band, they were going to be what is arguably the greatest band of all time. Many praise this as the greatest rock record of all time, others claim it is overrated; all opinions aside, the status that this album still holds to this day is legendary.\n\nThe album is split down the middle, with the famous epic 20 minute title track on side A, and five different marvelous tracks on side B. The title track features seven different movements of varying structure and intensity, while the 5 on the B side are rather unique to each other as well. One of the main issues with Caress of Steel was its rather broken and inconsistent structure, which hurt the album as a whole. However, on 2112, the stunning title track transitions seamlessly while keeping each of its seven sections distinct and profound. This would be one of Rush's greatest strengths in their following albums in the 70's and 80's: the ability to construct moving and fantastic epic pieces without compromising continuity, and it began here. \n\nThe title track is one of the most profound pieces of rock music ever composed. The narrative of this track combined with the sheer talent unleashed in its movements is mind-blowing. This song is evidence that Neil Peart was the secret weapon that Geddy and Alex needed, not only as a drummer, but as a lyricist. The heavy lyrics of \"Soliloquy\" are of sharp contrast to that of \"In the Mood\" or \"Finding My Way\", and it marked a point in which Rush were maturing into the living legends they are now; but the lyrics are only a compliment to the sheer awesomeness of the music. The song also showcases a seriously profound amount of musical talent with its diverse yet perfectly flowing movements. The aggression and pure power of \"Overture\" and \"Temples of Syrinx\" tempered by the awe-inspiring \"Discovery\", \"Presentation\", and the lovely \"Soliloquy\" makes for a song that transcends the boundaries of any ordinary \"epic\" song. \n\nThe B side of 2112 often will get criticized as being \"weak\" or even \"just not very good\". I'll tell you straight up that's bullshit. Granted, when you have a monster like \"2112\" preceding you, it can be hard to stand out; but these songs are each wonderful tracks. The two in particular that are fantastic would be \"Lessons\" and \"Something for Nothing\". \"Lessons\" remains a favorite of mine with its charming verses and aggressive chorus. \"Something for Nothing\" is one of my all time favorite Rush songs with a badass bass line and one of the best chorus' that Rush has ever written. \"Tears\" is one of my favorites when it comes to slow, poignant Rush songs (while \"Losing It\" takes the cake) with a very nice atmosphere and fantastic vocal performance from Geddy. The weakest song is \"The Twilight Zone\", but even then it is still a great track, showing that this album follows and keeps a very high standard of greatness. \n\nThe musicianship and songwriting on this album is fantastic. Alex Lifeson developed a less gritty and more atmospheric guitar tone that adds a bit of dimension to the music, while Geddy Lee's gritty, driven Rickenbacker tone would first show up here. Not only did their sound evolve into something amazing, but the musicians' true instrumental talents began to show their colors on this record. Alex's guitar playing is rather unique, resorting to lots of thick and heavy open chords to give a thick wall of sound while Ged hammers away with that sexy Ricky. Alex's soloing is, however, still quite dirty and bluesy on this album. This is evident all throughout the album, and while I prefer the entrancing solos he would play on later albums, he adds another level of aggression with solos such as those from the title track, \"Lessons\", and \"Something for Nothing\".\n\nNeil's drumming is of the highest level, with fills and rhythms that are quite creative and adept in their nature. This isn't Neil's greatest performance, but it definitely remains one of best to be played. The quick fills and aggressively creative drumming of the overture and \"Temples of Syrinx\" are not only present there, but on the whole album. While his insane fills and unique patterns are one of the famous traits of Neil's drumming, he also plays delicately crafted rhythms whenever the album slows down to go right along with what the song is doing. A great example of this is on one of my favorite parts, \"Presentation\", in which Neil plays along wonderfully to match the intensity. Neil's percussive mastery is always one of the most exhilarating additions to Rush's music, and one could argue that his legacy began here.\n\n2112 is generally heralded as Rush's masterpiece, and honestly, it really just might be. Such generalizations, however, don't fit a band of the caliber of Rush, the greatest album to some might be one of the weakest to others. With a career spanning over 40 years of brilliance, releasing only a couple weak albums, any of their many albums can be claimed as a magnum opus; but none of it would've been possible if not for 2112. This album smashed boundaries and it continues to be one of those records that just inspires awe upon the listener. This is essential listening for all prog rock fans, its influence was massive and it still is a hallmark of the entire genre. Truly amazing stuff, definitely one of the greatest albums of all time. \n\n\"You don't get something for nothing \nYou can't have freedom for free \nYou won't get wise with the sleep still in your eyes \nNo matter what your dreams might be!\"\n",
        "\nIt\u2019s hard to talk about one of the most iconic bands to have ever existed, forget prog or not. I mean these guys have been around longer than even Maiden or Priest and are still kicking ass today! If that\u2019s not saying enough, then I don\u2019t know what is. Even if you find them overrated, there\u2019s no way you can deny their momentous contribution to progressive music as a whole as well as evolving beyond their prog roots, but still keeping parts of their signature sound intact, that too over a span of several decades. This, along with A Farewell To Kings is without a doubt their best album. Of course, others will have their own favourites, which is exactly the beauty of the music of Rush. Each of their albums shine a different light, that\u2019s all. \n\nFor me at least, the verdict is still out on 2112 being the ultimate prog rock classic (while being musically impeccable as the band has always been, the music itself was a bit too sprawling and convoluted for my tastes), but if there is one album to completely deserve that title, it\u2019s this one. Of course along with many other albums, but that\u2019s a story for another time. No super-fast solos or leads to leave your jaw dropping, but you will just be in silent awe of how well arranged the music is as a whole. It\u2019s almost like a symphonic tale unfolding itself piece by piece. Simply grand. Geddy Lee\u2019s voice is as powerful as ever and his bass lines in songs like \u201cRed Barchetta\u201d and \u201cLimelight\u201d will make you just sit back in amazement at this guys skills. I absolutely adore the slow keyboard build up in \u201cThe Camera Eye\u201d with the lead guitar fill-ins painting a fantastic landscape in my mind. The longest song on the album without a single minute of excessive wankery or pointless transitions anywhere to be seen. This is true sonic architecture, and I mean the entire album. Also listen to \u201cWitch Hunt\u201d for another great example of how to build atmosphere with the keys. \n\nAlso I don\u2019t know if anyone else noticed but \u201cVital Signs\u201d has an infectious reggae feel to it that I can\u2019t help but love. Don\u2019t be remotely fooled by the previous sentence, the influence definitely works and how! Remember folks, diversity is the key. This album has none of the grandiose displays of virtuosity that would be plastered all over the albums of most of the 90s prog rock/metal bands. Not that that was a bad thing, mind you, but you get the drift. Listen to the stunning technicality of \u201cYYZ\u201d (which many technical and prog bands would undoubtedly take an influence from, a good decade later) and the meticulous melodic crafting on \u201cRed Barchetta\u201d and \u201cLimelight\u201d and you can bet your ass, Dream Theater and Fates Warning were definitely taking down notes. The seeds of the advent of prog metal as we know it today can be seen shining in all their glory on this album. If you\u2019re a pervert, then you\u2019ve probably taken that sentence the wrong way. Not that I\u2019d blame you. And of course everyone knows the iconic opener \u201cTom Sawyer\u201d and I have to say, in spite of having heard that song millions of times over the years, it still hasn\u2019t lost any of its charm or catchiness. Beat that. \n\nAbsolutely essential.\n",
        "\nI feel like Signals is an overlooked album among Rush fans. Maybe not the diehards, but certainly nowhere near as widely regarded as the giants of the band's discography, namely 2112, Permanent Waves and Moving Pictures. This is a shame as Signals represents a true highlight of the band's career in some ways. Its a streamlined, forward thinking, and truly progressive record despite its perceived continuing abandonment of extended displays of musical prowess. What those are replaced with are cerebral and emotionally driven excersizes in compacted technicality, some of which deserve to be ranked with the band's best ever work.\n\nSignals is unique in that although aesthetically congruent with the preceding records, it ditches the \"rock\" framework of Permanent and Moving and replaces it with a heavy New Wave bias clearly strongly influenced by The Police and similar bands of the time. The reggae tinge present on songs like \"Vital Signs\" from Moving Pictures becomes ever more prominent in places on Signals, also. Case in point, \"Digital Man\", with its baffling, highly technical drum and bass interplay saturated with washes of Andy Summers-esque guitar that gives the overall effect of \"Walking on the Moon\" on steroids paired to a set of cleverly obscure lyrics about...something. Signals also marks the point at which keyboards become a truly dominant feature of the Rush sound, which would continue throughout the decade. This is nowhere more evident than when the record opens, with the monolithic \"Subdivisions\" being driven almost entirely by Geddy Lee's synth work, punctuated by frantic basslines only at certain points. The song is a fan favourite and for good reason, as poignant a distillation of the angst and alienation of adolescence as has ever been committed to tape. Observe the brilliantly written:\n\nAny escape might help to smooth\nThe unattractive truth\nBut the suburbs have no charms to soothe\nThe restless dreams of youth\n\nAnother clear highlight of the album is \"The Analog Kid\", with its soaring incendiary displays of musicianship paired to dreamy, impressionistic words that are obscure, yet vibrant in the sense that you're not really sure what he's talking about, but it hits you somewhere and you relate to it in some way. The song reaches its emotional climax over the lines \"And when I leave I don't know what I'm hoping to find, and when I leave I don't know what I'm leaving behind\", a moment which never fails to move me. Neil Peart is a highly regarded lyricist for good reason. Even when he's being vague, he can still hit you right where you feel it. Indeed Signals as a whole is marked by this particular writing style, mixing elements of obtuse personal themes with an awareness of technology and how it affects our lives, a theme no less relevant in 2015 than it was in 1982, arguably even more so. The overall musical style is less agressive, more reflective and washed out thanks to the production and Alex Lifeson's increasingly textural riffing. However the idea that Lifeson's guitars disappeared in the 80s is an exaggeration. Its just a different approach and on this album in particular, he still manages to light up the fretboard with some fantastic and original soloing, most notably on \"Subdivisions\" and \"The Analog Kid\".\n\nTruth be told I do not consider Signals a masterpiece. It isn't as consistently brilliant and cinematic as my personal favorite Power Windows, as complex or gloriously cheesy as Hold Your Fire, or as universally appealing as Moving Pictures. Tracks like \"Chemistry\" and \"Countdown\" have yet to really captivate me, though perhaps with time and attention they will. The somewhat flat production and mixing also doesn't allow even the best parts of the album to truly \"jump out\" at the listener like they could (see the live A Show of Hands version of \"Subdivisions\" and you'll see what I mean). Its also not the most catchy album and largely requires some effort to truly grasp (though that is no bad thing in my mind). It wouldn't be until the following Grace Under Pressure that Rush would marry this kind of of sound to an infectious pop hook and a brighter, more punchy and expansive production. The reason I rate Signals so highly is on the strength of a selection of the songs which are up there with the best by this band, or any rock band period. Not the best starting point, arguably, but if you're going to get into Rush this is an album you must get acquainted with sooner or later.\n",
        "\nThere's no doubt that Rush is one of the most respected institutions in rock music. Their near-five decade career has produced a lot of amazing music, part of which has inspired and influenced a lot of other bands across the globe, many of which have also become successful, respected and influential in turn. In out beloved metal world, they've been particularly influential on the progressive metal genre, being one of first and most consistent acts to blend hard edged rock with the complexity and ambition of progressive rock. As I've mentioned in another review, I think their finest years happened from the mid-70s 'til the mid-80s. Just as they snuffed their progressive side flame and went for simpler synth rock, metal bands such as Watchtower, Fates Warning and Vo\u00efvod decided to pick up the torch, taking the Rush sound to heavier heights. \n\nRush themselves, as it happens with virtually all rock acts, started as a band influenced by sounds that predated them. They were young and impressionable. For their debut recording, they chose a couple of tunes which are a far cry in both format and style from what they'd do later in their career. The first single of this legendary Canadian (emphasis on) power trio consist in a Buddy Holly cover, \u201cNot Fade Away\u201d, a song which was made into a successful cover some years before by The Rolling Stones. Rush's version is closer to Holly's original, albeit discarding the emphasis on the famous Bo Diddley rhythm in favor of a more hard rockish feel. Alex Lifeson's simple picking opens the song, and Geddy's characteristic high pitched vocals kicks in, its joyful tone immediately recognizable. Around the 40-second mark, the rhythmic section finally appears. John Rutsey's beats are pretty straightforward rock 'n' roll in this one, steadily propelling the song at a youthful pace. You can hear Geddy's bass guitar escaping the norm from time to time, already showing his stellar presence in the band, though in the mix his instrument is a bit muddied, unlike the vocals and the guitar, which are given great presence. Around the two-and-a-half minute mark, Alex starts to solo away as Geddy continues to sing the chorus, until the song concludes. Quite a nice cover version, though I actually prefer the Stones rendition. \n\nThe B-side of the single is an original tune, their very first. \u201cYou Can't Fight It\u201d is an under three minute energetic hard rock number, pretty similar in style to \u201cNot Fade Away\u201d, or to what they'd do next in their eponymous debut, a year later. Again, emphasis is placed on Geddy's signature vocals and Lifeson's explosive soloing, both the highlights in this release. Alex fires his solos like a molten ball of equal parts Eric Clapton/Tony Iommi out of a volcano. The track also displays those distinctive melodic peaks which the band uses between rhythmic segments in many of their compositions. Rutsey's playing is pretty conservative here as well, but he shows his skills with some rapid fills from time to time. While he never had the chance to really prove what he could do behind the kit, or how we would have evolved with the rest of the band, he was a very solid drummer. Of course, his replacement would take drumming to a whole new level, so it's difficult to compare given the disparity in the two musicians' time spent with the band. \n\nWhile this release already showed competence in their abilities and a good cohesion as a band, it serves as a poor introduction to Rush's musical universe. Their pink lettered self-titled album would further develop this primitive hard rock sound, showing some of the band's versatility with more blues oriented tracks and different song lengths. Musically, there's not much here but a jubilant, hopeful effort. Nowadays, this single is a collector's item and really valuable due to its rarity. So, if you can get it, you will automatically enter the Rush fandom elite.\n",
        "\nThis album is certainly Rush's largest departure from their traditional rock sound, and it is incredibly polarizing. My dad, being a die-hard classic Rush fan, fucking hates this album. I, however, adore this album, and I never get tired of it. The album has a very consistent sound all the way through, and each song has parts that give me goosebumps after several listens. It's buried under a mountain of cheese the size of Mount Tai, and I love it.\n\nThe emotion here is tremendous and varied. Songs like \"Force Ten\" make you want to get up and accomplish everything. \"Lock and Key\"'s soaring intro vocals inject a sense of urgency and fear about the darker side of humanity. \"Tai Shan\" makes you feel like you're just a few feet from divinity. The closer \"High Water\" is like breathing a sigh of relief, and is a perfect way to close the album. Overall, every song is moving in some way, and it rarely gets tiring despite the cheesy 80's sound.\n\nDon't get me wrong, if you're looking for a prog rock album, it's going to be a very tough find. That's not to say there aren't heavier songs on here, though, and the subtle progressive elements are always present. \"Turn the Page\" is very guitar oriented and is one of the more energetic songs on the album. Overall, though, this album is laced with synths, but offers a huge bass sound, especially on songs like \"Tai Shan\", \"Force Ten\", and \"High Water\". Geddy also has a great vocal performance on this album, building up a significant portion of the emotion and just his awesome high-pitched wails, like on \"Lock and Key\", \"Force Ten\", and \"High Water\".\n\nPeople looking for a hard rock album will be sorely disappointed and probably bored with it, but if you are a fan of the 80's Rush sound and like cheese done tastefully, this album has a ton to offer you.\n\nHighlights: All songs, but especially \"Turn the Page\", \"Force Ten\", \"Second Nature\", \"Lock and Key\", \"Tai Shan\", \"High Water\"\n",
        "\nThis is one of the more obtuse Rush albums, and took a long time to really open up for me, but really it is up there with their best works. This is one of their mellower moments overall, with a reliance on cool, chilly synths that frankly make this sound more New Age than rock \u2013 they are constantly going, forming colorful swathes and transcendental soundscapes that contrast rather brilliantly with the hard, realistic lyrical themes. Geddy Lee's vocals take on a more sedate character than we're used to from him, and the vocal lines are beautifully articulate and hypnotically resonant, sticking with you long after the album ends. Everything is soft and soulful here, but when you really listen to the lyrics and the emotion in Geddy's voice, it becomes a powerful and iconoclastic listen by one of the best bands in rock.\n\nThe band was at their peak songwriting here \u2013 they dial back their epic tendencies, but replace it with tight musical syncopation on a level most bands could never reach. The songs are all different but fit together as a unit, and when you start the album you'll have to finish it. It's a very complete work and everything is perfectly in place \u2013 the more I listen to this, the more I'm struck by its brilliance. I don't like this quite as much as any of the four previous albums, but the layered textures of the songwriting have to be commended.\n\nIt's an album about a lot of very real things. The opening \u201cSubdivisions\u201d certainly doesn't waste time rallying against conformity and the oppressive, suffocating regime that the suburbs represent. Further tracks like \u201cNew World Man\u201d and the satirically tinged \u201cDigital Man\u201d are also about the changing times and how difficult it is to stand on one's own feet in the modern world, set against colorful keyboards, a few light hints of jazz and pop, and some of Alex Lifeson's trademarked shimmering, radiant chord work on the guitar. \u201cThe Weapon,\u201d in one of the album's most poignant and razor-sharp moments, takes a literary-barbed sword to the lies politicians tell to keep the public in line, set against a musical backdrop of slow, ominous build-ups and graven-faced vocals. \u201cChemistry\u201d is a typically brilliant Rush tune about science and how everything connects, and \u201cLosing It\u201d is a sorrowful dirge on the waning creativity that happens to every artist \u2013 one of the album's most haunting moments.\n\nBut the crowning moment comes early in the album with \u201cThe Analog Kid,\u201d a breezy and sweeping tune full of wanderlust and escapism, through the lens of a quite mysterious, ephemeral sort of love story. These are some of the best lyrics I've ever read, and they get my imagination working every time like good music should. Don't settle for less than this, people. Signals works on many levels, and functions as Rush at the top of their game. Musically transcendent and lyrically brilliant, it's the sound of a band with their eyes wide open to the world and their pens at the ready. Lyrics matter \u2013 listen to this and be swept up in its power.\n\nThe fawn-eyed girl with sun-browned legs\nDances on the edge of his dream\nAnd her voice rings in his ears\nLike the music of the spheres\n",
        "\nFor the longest time, I've counted Caress of Steel among my favourite albums of Rush. It's far from being their best or most inspired (take your pick from any of the five albums that followed this for that accolade), but I'll never let up thinking that this was Rush at their most daring and risky. Even with two solid albums and an already-distinctive sound under their belts, underwhelming sales made their future look pretty bleak. The answer to this problem, of course, was to write music that would attract mass appeal. \"Working Man\" was a great rock anthem, even songs like \"Fly By Night\" and \"In the Mood\" were evidence of radio potential. That Rush decided to work against intuition and pack their third album with prog rock bombast at a time where the genre was falling out of favour is kind of amazing. The two ambitious epics packed into Caress of Steel pull no punches; in the face of commercial extinction, Rush didn't flinch. They stayed true to themselves, and refused to compromise where they wanted to go with their music.\n\nWhat's more amazing still, is that I'm writing this at a time where Rush stands as one of the most profoundly successful bands in history. Even if they've never sought to strike FM waves and get popular, it happened anyway. Caress of Steel marks the first album where it truly sounds like Rush are getting truly comfortable with themselves. Fly By Night experimented with prog (see: \"By-Tor & the Snow Dog\") but never surrendered itself to the possibility that the band's future might lie in that approach. Caress of Steel still has some of the pop-oriented rock numbers that defined the first pair of albums, but they're dwarfed in significance by \"The Necromancer\" and \"The Fountain of Lamneth\", both of which rank among my favourite early Rush tracks. For the first time in their career (though far from the last), they had crafted a record with no weak links. Even the least impressive offering here, undoubtedly \"I Think I'm Going Bald\", serves an important role alongside \"Lakeside Park\" as an upbeat poppy contrast to the harrowing prog rock later on.\n\nOf the three shorter pieces here, there's little doubt that \"Bastille Day\" is the strongest. It may not have been the nigh-unbeatable opener that \"Anthem\" was, but the fusion of energetic rock with the aristocratic pomp of its bridge section is particularly clever. \"I Think I'm Going Bald\" is decidedly less iconic; I can see why the tongue-in-cheek rocker doesn't get discussed much, but it's enjoyable and to-the-point. While there isn't much more than that to be said about the token pop song \"Lakeside Park\", it does strike me as a really effective use of time. In three minutes, Rush manage to transport the listener to a specific time and place; I've never been to Lakeside Park (and haven't visited Toronto in several years) but I get a crisp mental image of the place through their lyrics. It's a pleasant song for summertime. If the rest of the album were just like that, it probably wouldn't leave much of an impression, but it would be the perfect thing to put on when I needed a pick-me-up.\n\nWhen it comes to the epics, Rush weren't so experienced with longform composition at this point. Yeah, \"The Necromancer\" is leisurely, maybe a little self-involved. \"The Fountain of Lamneth\" is a greater part episodic than naturally cohesive. But both of them are amazing. They're both rare cases of music that provide a gateway into another reality. Rush's vision of high fantasy is Tolkien-inspired to the point of feeling like a cheap knock-off (in a sense, they paved the way for generations of power metal bands) but it doesn't matter. Regardless whether the content isn't original, Rush make you believe in it. The gloomy psychedelic distortions in \"The Necromancer\" paint a grim picture of a wasteland where nothing grows. \"The Fountain of Lamneth\" is even more successful in this way; the epic revolves around a young man's search for immortality. The suite not only conveys his physical journey, but his emotional arc as well. When we first meet the hero, he is restless and confident (\"In the Valley\"). By the reprise, he is world-weary and tired, discouraged with the realization that reality often fails expectation. The music and lyrics work together to create a mental image just as vivid as \"Lakeside Park\". From a point of technical structure, Rush didn't create the sense of a completely coherent start-to-finish epic until the year after with \"2112\" (which stands among the most perfect prog epics ever) but the rough edges here are easy to overlook. Rush are all-too eager to take the listener on a journey, and I'm all-too eager to oblige them.\n\nOn a personal note, \"The Fountain of Lamneth\" had a powerful significance to me in my late childhood. I was having a tough time adjusting to my own realization that my dreams seemed made to be broken. I wanted to escape, to find my way beyond the nagging circumstances of my situation and, speaking now in hindsight, have what at the time was hideously implausible. Like the hero of \"The Fountain of Lamneth\", I struggled with the dissonance between reality and expectation. However, his final consolation struck a heavy note with me. \"Still... I am.\" Instead of finding what he set out for, his quest awarded him the gift of perspective and maturity, to be thankful for the life he has himself. Even if the string of masterpieces reaching from this to Signals in 1982 might make Caress of Steel look primitive in comparison to some of Rush's other work, the album will always hold a special place with me.\n",
        "\n\"Life for yourself -- there's no one else more worth living for / Begging hands and bleeding hearts will only cry out for more...\"\n\nIt's pretty amazing what can happen to a band within the space of a year. Rush's self-titled debut had initially tanked commercially, but gradually gained popularity as months went by. In that time, their drummer John Rutsey had to leave the band due to complications with diabetes, leaving a third of the band's membership up for grabs. The decision to induct Neil Peart into the ranks of Rush stands as one of the most propitious lineup changes in rock history. I like the debut - I really do! - but it's difficult in current hindsight to dissociate the band's sound and style from Peart. Alex and Geddy had more than enough personality between the two of them to carry a rock record, but it was Neil that pushed them towards a more sophisticated end.\n\nRush was a solid hard rock album, but it was limited in intellectual scope. Sure, \"Working Man\" could be interpreted as existential to a certain degree, but their lyrical themes were hooked within genre expectations: contrived lust, having fun, and youthful malcontent. With Peart and Fly by Night, they went from that to songs aboutAyn Rand, of all fucking things. More than that, they were also making songs about Lord of the Rings and the mythic struggles of frostbitten puppies. An expression of highbrow literacy paired with an inkling for all things Fantastic were sure signs that Rush were well on the way to becoming progressive rock.\n\n...It's unfortunate that the music quite as interesting. Despite a few incredible tracks, Fly By Night is one of those sophomores that tries to be several kinds of follow-up at once. Rush were trying to push past the straight-up heavy blues on the debut; a nine minute track like \"By-Tor & the Snow Dog\" (complete with incomprehensible subsections) was a clear nod towards bigger things. At the same time, they clearly didn't wish to alienate fans of the first; rockers like \"Best I Can\" and \"Beneath, Between & Behind\" could have easily masqueraded as weaker tracks on the self-titled. Fly By Night is a less consistent album, with higher highs, lower lows, and a weaker sense of coherence, if only because Rush were trying out so many new things at once. It was a necessary transition album, but it's always struck me as one of the weaker chapters in their discography, alongside the arguable nadir they hit in the 90s, circa Test for Echo.\n\nAt the same time, Fly by Night isn't so easily dismissed. On top of having a few of the least appetizing tracks of Rush's early career, there are a couple of the absolute best. On the heels of the self-titled, hearing \"By-Tor & the Snow Dog\" is a revelation. The peppy rock energy they've carried throughout their career becomes entwined with progressive bombast here. Even if they were new to the 'prog' genre here, they were already teaching it a thing or two. Most progressive suites take time to build and get started; \"By-Tor\" erupts with a quick drum fill and bursts into the quick meat of the song. The instrumental mid-section is one of the coolest things Rush would ever do; the counterpoint between Lifeson's playful leads and Geddy Lee's heavily distorted bass fuzz sounds like a conversation between two distinct personalities- isn't that what all battles are to begin with? \n\nEven if it's certainly the most ambitious piece on the album, \"By-Tor\" isn't my favourite. The honour has always gone to \"Anthem\", which musically might be described as \"Finding My Way\" on amphetamines. Rush were clearly trying to recreate the thunderous energy that opened the self-titled, and they managed to one-up it in every possible way, creating one of the best hard rock songs I've ever heard. I really like how it takes absolutely no time whatsoever to demonstrate the talents of their newest member. Neil Peart is in top form with \"Anthem\"; the drums are crisp and frantic, and it's clear Lifeson and Lee are benefiting from the fresh blood.\n\nI have so many good things to say about those two tracks- even the title track \"Fly By Night\" has gone some peppy flame to it, although the nuisance of radio overplay probably weighs against it. It's a memorable, catchy pop song with a contagiously cheerful riff to boot. much like the debut however, there are just as many songs on Fly By Night that come off as underwhelming. \"Best I Can\" and \"Beneath, Between & Behind\" sound like they're rehashing the self-titled without the credit of great riff writing. Barring the title track, the rest of the second half is downright disappointing. I suppose \"Making Memories\" is decent, but there's nothing really compelling about a simplified acoustic rock tune in the wake of what came before it. \"In the End\" tries to play the role of bombastic closer, but the hazy pace feels lifeless. Worst of all (and I'm sure some will disagree) is \"Rivendell\". By all means I know I should be enjoying Rush trying to be Yes or something out of Jon Anderson's solo career, but the sleepy atmosphere never seems to end. It is a small handful of initially charming ideas stretched out to make a song two or three minutes longer than it really should be. Fly By Night has considerably more to say than its predecessor, but nothing off of Rush felt as lazy and uncompelling as the last couple of tracks here.\n\nFly By Night is a total mixed bag. Unlike the self-titled (which I think benefited from a revisit) my thoughts on Rush's second album haven't changed much over the years. There are a few immortal tunes, some 'meh', and a couple I'm bored stiff by. In any case, there's a lot to be said for any band that tries this hard to see what they're capable of. Emerging from the shadow of their influences was no doubt a scary step to make, but judging from the streak of legendary records they would make soon after this, I think their leap of faith paid off fairly well; don't you?\n",
        "\nThere seems to be majority agreement that Rush's self-titled started their career off on one of its weaker notes. I wouldn't contest that notion either; compared to the heady intellectualism of their peak era, the bluesy, Led Zeppelin-influenced hard rock on this one can barely compete. Be that as it may, I think it is unduly overlooked by a lot of fans- myself included. Back in high school, I bought every album of theirs I could lay my adolescent hands on. 2112 and Caress of Steel blew me away, Moving Pictures even moreso. Even Counterparts (which I'll stand beside as one of the most underrated rock albums ever, let alone of Rush's career) struck a lasting note with me. After giving the debut a few listens however, I dismissed it, and the CD ended up at the back and bottom of my shelf where the U2 and Aerosmith best-of compilations dwelled.\n\nWhile my music taste has only grown more perverse and alienating in the years since, I actually find myself enjoying Rush far more than I did at the height of my fandom. There's not a lot of depth to their songwriting. The lyrics are probably best described as pedestrian at best. But couldn't the same be said for Led Zeppelin's early masterpieces? Decades later, and there's still a primal charm to unpretentious, no-frills rock music. The problem is that so many of the bands (both then and now) that go that route failed to say anything memorable with such a limited palette. Even if they would quickly abandon it for bolder pastures, Rush had no problem expressing their personality with a basic rock set-up.\n\nLove or hate the album, Rush stands out from many of its amorphous hard rock contemporaries. While their influences are active in colouring the band's performance, Rush's sound on the self-titled was already distinctive, thanks in no small part to the voice of Geddy Lee. His singing is unique to the point of being an acquired taste; that's virtually unheard of in hard rock. His high-pitched wail has always been the potential dealbreaker with new listeners, and none moreso than here. I think the impish shriek Geddy's vocals lean on works for the music they were making here, but it would be a couple of albums still before he learned to make the most of his voice. As it happens, there are moments where it sounds like he pushes himself further than he should; some of the inflections on \"Take a Friend\" and \"Here Again\" have always rubbed my ears the wrong way. Regardless, the fact that you could already pick his voice out of a crowd of a thousand this early on only works to be the benefit of the music.\n\nThe easy highlight on the self-titled is Alex Lifeson. The thoughtful restraint and feeling he put into his playing on albums like Hemispheres has long since made him one of my favourite guitarists (not to mention a major reason why I decided to pick up the instrument for myself.) He doesn't offer the same laid-back sense on Rush. With the debut, he's all about pure riffmaking. \"Finding My Way\" offers one of the best opening riffs to an album in hard rock history. And, of course, it would be nuts to go without mentioning \"Working Man\", Rush's first de facto 'hit.' Call me crazy, but I hear echoes of Black Sabbath in \"Working Man\"- just replace Geddy with Ozzy and it might have fit on Paranoid or Sabbath's own self-titled debut.\n\nEven when the songwriting isn't always that great, Lifeson's riffs (and leads) are a joy to hear. This segues me to the biggest issue Rush faced at this early stage. When the song writing is good, it's really good. The rest of the time, they don't seem all that phased by mediocre writing. \"Finding My Way\" is a great opener. \"In the Mood\" is a memorable pop track. \"Working Man\" is a heavy beast of a closer. The rest of the tracks help me remember why I wasn't a fan of the album in the first place. None of it is bad songwriting per se; just audibly uninspired. Keeping in mind that they would be writing epics about shit like space and necromancers a few years later, listening to Geddy unironically wailing about 'needing some love' is pretty lame. Ditto that for singing songs about how great it feels to 'take'(?) a friend. Do these guys know they would be doing full-blown prog rock a couple of years later? Jesus Christ...\n\nI also promised myself I'd bring up Geddy Lee as a bassist. The most common wasted opportunity in rock music is a bassist who sounds content to mindlessly follow the chords of the guitarist. Unfortunately, that's the case more often than not in this sort of hard rock. Not only does Geddy pave his own way independent of Lifeson's thunder, the aggressive tone of his bass is perfectly suited to the music they're playing here. Unsurprisingly, the would-be weakest link is the drummer John Rutsey. He had to leave after an album due to touring complications related to diabetes. Although he holds up a decent beat here, he lacked the presence to keep up with the already-distinctive personalities of Lifeson and Lee. Running into Neil Peart was the best-possible thing to happen to them; a drummer that could not only keep up, but take charge of any aspects Rush lacked in somewhat- namely, their lyrics.\n\nBut what if that had never happened? Think of it this way: imagine a parallel universe where the Rush we knew never existed. Instead, three guys from Toronto had decided to make a bluesy, Zeppelin-influenced hard rock album before calling it quits, to start families and become high school teachers (or something.) If Rush was all we had to judge from what would become one of the strongest legacies in rock music, its qualities would undoubtedly be more apparent. Geddy's distinctive (if not always pleasant) voice and aggressive bass playing, Alex's energy and tone, and the riffs- by G\u00f6tt- THE RIFFS! \"Finding My Way\", \"In the Mood\" and the almighty \"Working Man\" are great examples of mid-70s hard rock, and while it would take Neil Peart to elevate them to the next level, Rush's debut still stands as a pretty solid affair in its own right.\n",
        "\nPeople on this site seem to be accepting of them, but most people that I know, even hardcore Rush fans, seem to be somewhat indifferent to the Rush albums recorded after Signals. Few hate them, but they seem to lack a real fan base. This is reflected by relatively poor sales of those albums. Fortunately, Rush made real comeback with 2002's Vapor Trails. The song One Little Victory was even included in the classic racing video game Need for Speed 2: Hot Pursuit. This is what got me into Rush in the first place, so who says video games are bad for you?! \n\nFirst thing up, lyrics. Those familiar with early day Rush, may be surprised to find a lack of literature inspired lyrics. The lyrics here focus more on life issues and lyrics popular during the 90's. As to rather this was due to trends or as to what was happening in Neil Peart's life at the time I am not sure, but reasons aside I find the lyrics here to be among Rush's best. That being said, there are two types of people. Those who find Peart's lyrics intelligent, and those who find them pretentious. To be fair, both are equally true, but I find myself to quite enjoy Peart's lyrics most of the time. With that in mind however, you're going to have to find out for yourself which camp you fall under. \n\nMusically, this album is a huge departure for Rush. It's their first album since 1972's Caress of Steel to not feature synthesizers, and it's their first since 1975's Fly by Night to be hard rock. Now, Rush hasn't dropped progressive altogether, but this is defiantly a more straight forward hard rock album than what Rush has made in a long time. The complex time signatures are all but absent here, and the songs are more simple than they have been in the past (although they are still plenty complicated). This album is far more accomplished than their earlier forays into the world of hard rock however, and it's a change I myself quite enjoy.\n\nThere has been a fair amount of controversy surrounding this album's production, controversy it 100% deserved. Rush was one of many bands to fall into the trap of the loudness war, something bands like ZZ Top and Metallica have recently fallen victim to. The album has the life compressed out of it, and the acoustic parts of the album are almost unlistenable. For those who don't know what compression is, compression is the process in which all parts of a song are made the same volume. What this means is, a whisper and a shout will be the same volume. You may still be able to understand that one vocal part is a whisper and another is a scream, but they will still be the same volume. This also often results in instruments sounding artificial. Obviously this is a huge issue. Fortunately, the band was willing to accept the fact that they messed up, and in 2013 they re-released the album and all the issues of the production are fixed here. This is one of the few times where a remaster was necessary and truly helped. \n\nIf you are a fan of hard rock, or a fan of Rush, this is a great album. While different, it still feels like a Rush album, and it is of good quality. If you do decide to get this, make sure to get the remastered version. If you can't tell, open it up and check the year it was made. The 2002 version isn't horrible, but really the 2013 remastered version is the way to go if you can get your hands on it instead.\n",
        "\nIt's rare that a band makes a comeback on the scale that Rush has. Only Overkill and Aerosmith can match them in this regard. The music found on this album ranks among Rush's best works ever, and that already is a quite impressive body of work. Their last album, 2007's very good Snakes and Arrows, it seemed that Rush was going to be next in the line of classic rockers ready to make an album on the level of their classic works, but no one could have predicted a success on this scale.\n\nClockwork Angels follows the story of a boy following his dreams, against the wishes of the authoritarian ruler that goes by the name of \"Watchmaker\". This story is somewhat similar to the story found on 2112, a person fighting against their authoritarian rulers. Here however, the whole album tells the story, not just a single song. The story here is interesting, but I found myself forgetting it just enjoying the music, so don't expect this to be deep and engaging as on albums such as \"The Wall\" from Pink Floyd. Still, if you want, the story IS good enough, and worthy to be paid attention to if you wish.\n\nThe real star here is the music, and oh boy is it the STAR. The music is a combination of their blues rock beginnings and their progressive rock 70's. This is a style that is quite rare, and never ever done this well. It walks the fine line between hard rock and heavy metal. Songs such as the opener, Carvan, are very riff centered. There are acoustic moments present on this album, but for the large majority of the record Alex Lifeson's electric guitar roars and the album has a very metallic feel to it, although I wouldn't quite call it metal.\n\nThe songs work awesomely both as a part of the album and on their own, something many songs from concept albums don't do. This makes this a body of work, you'll return to both in your home for a dedicated music session, and equally as often when on the train on your way to your job. \n\nThere are many good songs, but \"Clockwork Angels\", \"Seven Cities of Gold\", and \"The Garden\" stick out to me as real highlights. On an album so thoroughly good, don't take that lightly, these are songs on the level of their classics, such as Tom Sawyer and Subdivisions. There are also numerous songs that break the musical pattern and keep the listener on their toes so to speak. It is one of the few albums that I can listen to over and over all the way through and not get bored with. It is a true modern classic in every sense of the term. If this album had come out back in 1980 along with Moving Pictures and the lot, this still would stick out as a true quality album. Hard rockers and prog rockers alike will love it, and I couldn't recommend an album more than I do this truly genius record.\n",
        "\nOh Rush, you never cease to amaze me. I don't think there has ever been a band which such musical talent that has an equal amount of songwriting ability. Rather it be Alex Lifson's soulful yet shredtastic fret-work, Neil Peart's godlike drumming, or Geedy Lee's odd but quirky vocals and thunderous bass lines, Rush is always a band that delivers. It's hard to imagine a day where Rush wasn't a rock staple like they are today, but alas there once was such a day.\n\nThe year was 1968 and three Jewish boys from Canada with a love of rock got together as a bar band. After 6 years of existence they finally made an album, 1974's \"Rush\". It was almost universally ignored until the song \"Working Man\" was picked up by Cleveland OH radio station WMMS. After touring shortly, drummer Rutsey left the band for health reasons and due to distaste for touring. After months of soul searching, drummer Neil Peart was added to the band, and the final lineup was formed. While things seemed up for the band, with a strong following in Cleveland and touring with big bands, things started going south fairly soon. Their next two albums had no hit songs (it wasn't till after Rush became famous that Fly By Night became a rock radio staple) and sold poorly, despite a cult-like following. They needed an album that would sell, but they couldn't put out a pop rock album, to become like so many progressive rock bands that had come before them and fallen into the same predicament as Rush had, and feel artistically content, so they decided to ignore the need for a hit and release their most ambitious album to date knowing full well it would flop and the band would have to break up... except it didn't. The album was a success and the band's future was secured.\n\nThis album was Rush doing what they wanted this clearly lends to the artistic success of the album. This is a no compromises prog album without a single song that even had a chance to be a hit, and due to this the album is quality through and through. While, they seem somewhat insignificant compared to the 20 minute A side, the song 2112, the rest of the songs are great too, especially A Passage to Bangkok and Something For Nothing. While the B side is full of quality songs, no one buys this album for those songs. What matters is the A side, the epic 2112. Rush had tried concept songs before, notionally on the \"Caress of Steel\", but unlike those, 2112 had a meaning that could be identified with (it is very anti-authoritarian/control) and was, simply put: better. Later, bands like Pink Floyd would take the idea of telling a story with a song further to be a full album, as on their mega-hit album \"'The Wall\".\n\nOutside of the song 2112, the album is largely hard rock with progressive tendencies, more than actually progressive rock songs themselves. Most of the songs on side B are strong, but a few songs (the song Tears comes to mind) are fairly weak. Still, this doesn't detract much from the otherwise stellar album, as most of the songs on side B are catchy and well written.\n\nAs to be expected, the musicianship on display here goes above and beyond the call of duty. Alex Lifeson's solos, as stated before, are somehow both badass, yet extremely soulful. Geddy's bass isn't shown off as much as on many other Rush records, but it still is prominent, important, and mindbogglingly awesome. Peart's drumming... well I'll just let his reputation speak for itself (if you don't know his reputation, Neil Peart is considered one, if not THE, greatest drummer of all time).\n\nThis is one of those few albums that sold on word of mouth, and word of mouth alone. 2112 almost on its own created the idea of concept songs, and proved that prog rock could really ROCK. To further show its importance, in 2006 the Audio-Visual Preservation Trust of Canada chose the album to be preserved forever (or as close to forever as possible).\n\nAsk any progressive rock or metal band that came after them, almost all will say Rush was one of their major influences. Bands such as Anthrax, Foo Fighters, Metallica, Primus, Rage Against the Machine, Smashing Pumpkins, Prototype, Dream Theater, Symphony X, and even Trent Reznor of Nine inch Nails all list Rush as one of their major influences, and for good reason, as this album clearly proves.\n\nIn short, this is a super important and influential album, for both Rush and for music as a whole. But it is also an album of high quality. Its filler, while indeed filler, is of high quality and there are plenty of gems to be found. The title track is one of the most important 20 minutes in music history on its own. This album, while clearly not a perfect record, is a necessary addition to any progressive rocker's, or progressive metalhead's, collection.\n",
        "\nRush has had more than one close encounter with having to disband, and on 2112 basically made an album they knew couldn't sell and were ready to throw in the towel, but by a miracle, not a small one either, 2112 hit #61 on the Billboard hot 100, a high enough position to keep their record deal. They knew 2112's success was basically a fluke and they couldn't do an album like that again (the band didn't even really want to anyway), and so they needed something somewhat more commercial. This is the result. \n\nRush didn't drop their love of long songs, as two songs here are longer than 10 minutes, but half the album's songs are under 5 minutes, two are under 3 minutes. While not explicitly pop tunes, these are songs meant to have a chance at success, and mostly made to help the album sell better than it would have otherwise, and sell better it indeed did. While not a massive hit initially, Closer to the Heart would go on to later become a classic rock radio staple. The album was a considerable success. While 2112 hit # 61, A Farewell to Kings reached #33 in the US and #22 in the UK. \n\nThis is the album where synthesizers became an important part of Rush compositions. You'll either love this sound or hate it, but it's not anywhere near as predominate here as it is on other Rush albums, so even if the synthesizer sound isn't your cup of tea, you most likely won't mind it here, as it's used as texture rather than a leading instrument, as it would become on Rush albums yet to come. It's a good blend between the hard rock days of early Rush and the more pop oriented version of Rush that would come in the 80's.\n\nOutside of Closer to the Heart, there isn't a song here that really is great. The longer songs feel too long and not completely thought out, and the shorter ones feel too short. Not that they're BAD, they just aren't great. The songs here are decent, and would set the stage for the Rush albums to come, it just isn't a completed idea yet. \n\nThe most important thing that this album did was provide real success to Rush. #61 was passable, but #22 gave them a real taste of the limelight. It also allowed them to create more, better and less pop oriented, progressive synthesizer songs on their next LP, Hemispheres.\n\nIn summery, this is a good, but unimpressive album, that any fan of Rush and progressive music should own. If you aren't either of the aforementioned, you probably won't find much here to like, outside of Closer to the Heart. Even progressive fans can afford to skip this one, it didn't change the musical landscape or anything. The only thing it really affected was the career of Rush, which while I appreciate that, that doesn't make it an influential or good album.\n",
        "\nEvery band starts somewhere, Rush started here, in 1974 with their self titled debut. Rush has had many run-ins with failure, but none as close as this. This album was a complete commercial failure. It wasn't until a few months later, in Cleveland OH, that radio station WMMS basically saved the band, by adding the song \"Working Man\" to their regular playlist. This led to the band becoming quite popular in the town, popular enough to make the album hit #105, giving the band enough money for a sophomore album.\n\nImportance aside, lets talk quality, and in terms of quality, it's one of the worse albums to come from Rush. Not bad, but unimaginative and somewhat boring. It's little more than high-quality Led Zeppelin worship (Cactus anyone?), and despite the high-quality part, it's still an album that wants to be from another band. The tune \"Working Man\" shows what was to come from the band, but outside that there isn't much here worth mentioning. \n\nThe band has numerous songs such as \"Finding My Way\" that I can't listen to and NOT think of Robert Plant. What these songs lack is identity. A lot of the lack of identity come from the fact that this a debut album, but equally it comes from the lack of drumming god and lyricist Neil Peart. Once he joins, the band jumps in quality and finally has an identity, but alas this isn't their next album, and what we have is boring, generic songs.\n\nHowever, two songs manage to escape this fate of being boring. \"Working Man\" and \"Finding My Way\" despite their Led Zeppelin qualities, are really good songs, and show off how good Lifeson and Lee are at their instruments. While they are unimaginative, they are really, REALLY good. This is what saves the album, the songs while Led Zeppelin worship, are good enough to carry the album. \n\nIf you are a hardcore Rush fan, or just a fan of hard rock in general, this album is a great addition to your collection. It is unoriginal but it's good, and that's what really matters. Every band starts somewhere, and despite its unoriginal traits, this was a good place for the band to start out. It gave them their first hit song, and showed that the band was competent, two things record companies really love, which allowed their following records to be made. As with A Farewell to Kings, this album is more important to Rush than to anything else. Without it, Rush's success wouldn't have come to be. That being said, if you aren't a huge fan of hard rock or Rush, there isn't anything here that you'll really need or even really want. If you aren't those two things, just download \"Working Man\" and \"Finding My Way\" and forget the rest of the album, because pretty much everyone else did as well.\n",
        "\nThis is one of Rush's most famous albums and contains their most famous and popular single track. This is also part of the transition to synthesizers that became dominant on their succeeding albums. This still has some great guitar moments by Lifeson, some great instrumental work in general, and several other classic Rush songs.\n\nTom Sawyer is one of those tracks. It is instantly recognizable to anyone over the age of 15, I even recommended it for my senior class song. It comes in with the synths and keys, then Geddy's vocals begin, and it is a great ride. It contains some great playing by all involved. Alex has a very nice solo, it's a little weird, but fun. Geddy has a more emotive delivery than usual, and it works brilliantly. This is also the only song on the album where Peart's lyrics feel a little more philosophical. It is about a man who will do things his way in the face of a world that may not like that. This functions as a sort of brief nod to the late 70's albums.\n\nThe playing is as superb as always. I read an interview from the 80's recently where Geddy mentions his shock at receiving an award for his keys, when he can barely play a chord. In terms of technique, his keyboard work is probably the weakest aspect of the album, and he uses it rather frequently, not for atmospheric purposes. I would have rather Geddy was more skillful at the keys before he went Emerson on Alex's Lake. Alex himself has some good lead work, but he gets shoved out of the rhythms from time to time. He doesn't really function as a metal or hard-rock guitarist on here, in that he's not really riffing away. I enjoy his solo on Tom Sawyer, and I believe he regards his solo on Limelight as his very best. As for Peart and how the band gels, one need look no further than YYZ. This was a very popular song, for an instrumental, and it is amongst the most enjoyable that I've heard. This may seem odd, but one of the melodies from this song is very similar to one used on Pink's \"So What.\" \n\nI don't really like the cover on this album. In general, I'm not too keen on Rush's covers. I have a shirt of theirs, but it's not from an album. This is easily the weakest they'd had in a while. From Fly By Night on, they'd generally had solid artwork. This really announces their change in style. I don't dislike that they changed styles in of itself, but it seems like Rush achieved more in sales terms, than in actually great music. I enjoy most of what Rush has done, but the later style just isn't as much to my taste, and this cover reminds me of that. It also reminds me of something Marillion might have. The music still has some prog elements; Camera Eye is an epic track that works pretty well. For all it's hype, Witch Hunt is more unsettling than heavy, but maybe that's similar to many people. I mention these to note the particular spot Rush was at at this time. They weren't really metal/hard-rock anymore, they weren't as progressive as they had been, and they didn't have enough of the Police influence to put them in the post-punk category. This album is fairly distinct in terms of looking around at what surrounded them in 1981.\n\nI enjoy every song on this album, Tom Sawyer might be their best song and is fifth at worst, and they even managed to avoid a crappy ballad. Why is this not their greatest? If just doesn't consistently rock hard enough. Red Barchetta, Limelight, and Camera Eye are all mostly subdued, and there are no faster songs to balance things out. Another problem is, as I mentioned, Geddy's keys are starting to push Alex out. The issue I have with that is that Geddy's keys never hit the level of Alex's guitar. This trade swindled us all. I still enjoy this album tremendously, but I can't help but feel like I'm staring over a cliff. These problems are small on here, but it's disappointing to think of where said problems led them to. In any case, this is still something most bands never came close to. I would recommend this to prog fans of any kind, hard-rock fans, post-punk fans, and heavy metal fans.\n",
        "\nFor my money, this is Rush's greatest album. This was the beginning of their sparkling quintet and they begin it on the best foot possible. This is not their most consistent, complex or catchiest, but it has enough of all of it, plus it's probably their most emotive.\n\nBefore I get to some of the musical aspects, I would like to begin with a couple of the complaints I frequently hear. The first is that the softer parts of the epic aren't as good and that it's cheap or not done for the right reasons. I will freely admit that the first two parts are my favorites, but the rest is all very good to me. I see no real difference in quality past that. As to it being cheap or inferior to change tempos, there are a ton of prog-metal bands, Dream Theater for instance, who often do this same thing. In more aggressive forms of music, changing shades does more than in other forms. The band Yes, for example, never got very hard, so changing tempos didn't mean that much for the listener. Rush on the other hand could go from being one of the most intense bands around to pure acoustic and be excellent at both. That's rather impressive. \n\nThe other complaint is that their lyrics are only impressive if you're a teenager. I think this misses the boat entirely. No band's lyrics are really impressive. No song lyric can touch a Republic or Das Kapital for influence and meaning. What Rush had was that they often eschewed the standard blues tropes of sex, anger, and fun. They sang about some of the more unusual topics that meant something to Peart, or in the case of Bangkok was funny. I enjoy this aspect quite a bit. In comparison, Aerosmith's lyrics can get rather redundant and Yes' mediocre poetry is not that special or pretty without the music.\n\nNow that my rant is over, the music on display is really excellent. Geddy is very audible and I much enjoy the sound of his bass. In general, I enjoy getting to hear bass at all, but his playing is really adding to the music, especially in terms of feel. On Passage, the drug lyrics work even better, almost stoner-ish, with his loud bass. Call me crazy, but I actually enjoy his banshee wails. I remember the first time I heard The Temples of Syrinx - I was blown away. I understand not enjoying his vocals, but frankly you're going to close off a ton of older music. Alex puts on one of his best rhythmic displays here. His soloing isn't outstanding, but it's still pretty good. This is probably as close to metal as the boys got. I honestly go back and forth myself, but this is more intense than Queensryche or Fates Warning ever got, and Dream Theater still make songs based off the Rush formula. Neil is a drumming god as always. There's not much to say; his fills are superb, his timing is good, and he's aggressive. His lyrics are more to his philosophical bent than they had been. He really leans on his respect for Ayn Rand in several songs. The only real stinker on here is Tears. It's an overly sappy ballad. \n\nThis album has massive influence and there's a reason this band still exists and is on Metallum. There is not a prog-metal band from Fates to D. Theater to Opeth that doesn't owe Rush a ton. As far as impact on metal goes, I'd say this probably tops Rainbow Rising and is just shy of Sad Wings. In terms of quality, I'd say it's right there with Sad Wings and a couple of cuts above Rising. Yes, Sad Wings has nothing as bad as Tears, but the better stuff on here is stratospheric. The slower parts of 2112 are just as evocative as Dreamer Deceiver and the faster stuff is very close to Tyrant in terms of aggression. Also, the atmosphere on here is quite excellent. It has this sense of optimism in the face of hopelessness during the epic and the slight uptick in happiness found throughout the shorter songs could be viewed as a fulfillment of said optimism. Sad Wings has this excellent morose, yet poetic feel throughout that can rival but not surpass this.\n\nAll of this taken into account, I almost feel that this should have a perfect score. I'm not sure that I could name ten albums in all of music that I enjoy more than this. This is the best album by the only band that rivals Priest for being my favorite. Everything comes together very well on here, the influence is tremendous, and the great songs are GREAT. The only problem is that Tears is such an obvious and weak song. It's not even that it's the weakest in a strong bunch, it's like a small tumor. I would of course still recommend this to any fan of early metal, hard-rock, prog metal, or even just classic prog.\n",
        "\nFollowing the success of the solid Power Windows and its subsequent tour, Rush took a much-needed break so they could be with their loved ones and relax. However, after a mere few months had passed, the band members quickly started letting the creative juices flow again and they started writing material for their follow-up release Hold Your Fire. Once the promotional single \"Force Ten\" was released to the public, it was clear to everyone that Rush hadn't given up on the poppier arrangements of the previous record; in fact, it seemed even more accessible than usual! With punchy drum work and flashy synthesizer bursts from Geddy Lee's trusty keyboard work, it sounded as though Rush were really going off the deep end with their pop-rock phase this time around. And... well... yeah. In a way, they kinda did.\n\nDon't get me wrong; there are indeed progressive moments scattered about Hold Your Fire. In fact, the album's big hit single \"Time Stand Still\" is ironically one of the most typical and classic-sounding Rush songs on this entire thing because of its frequently altered tempos and more experimental character (with the female vocals, heavy atmosphere, the works). Unfortunately, this is also one of the first times in Rush's career in which some of their choices end up really biting them in the collective ass. There's only so much someone can take of a more watered-down Rush, and songs like the bland power-ballad \"Second Nature\" and the overly cheery instrumentation of \"Mission\" are begging for a songwriting overhaul. The emotional weight is here in top form, but - and I do hate to say this - the music has a tendency to be just plain boring. It's not that Rush have to be technical to be good, and the band's instrumental prowess shines in tunes like \"Prime Mover\" and the mystical \"Tai Shan,\" but the synthesizers are really what kill a good chunk of this record. Why? Because they're so damn overbearing. As with Signals and a decent chunk of Power Windows, it feels as though Alex Lifeson has been once again shoved off to the sidelines as Lee's large array of keyboard effects comes in to take command of the record. \n\nThere are, however, some nifty things here and there that provide a good contrast to this, my personal favorite being the highly guitar-driven rocker \"Turn the Page\"; while there is still a high amount of synthesizer work when the song occasionally slows down, Alex's presence is strong and provides a uniquely stark atmosphere to the track. As for Neil Peart, he's certainly very commendable on this album because of his ability to transform simplicity into an immersive experience. He could easily have just followed what the other instruments are doing, but instead offers his own unique takes on these poppy tracks. The fills on \"Time Stand Still\" and \"Turn the Page\" are among his finest, and his highly involved performance in closer \"High Water\" positively contrasts the song's slow tempo and simple instrumental work. \n\nStill, it's quite upsetting to hear a band's sound become diluted to the point of genuine boredom, and Rush were quite close to hitting such a mark. Hold Your Fire isn't a bad album, but it's one of the band's worst records regardless; the emotional content and atmosphere are strong, but not as powerful when coupled with the overdone synth arrangements and weaker songwriting. This just barely escapes being their worst album, but what a dangerously close call. However, to the Rush fans out there: you should get this if you're a completionist or into 80s Rush. Otherwise, I'd say this one's more for pop rock fans than the ones who adore the band's more progressive 70s material.\n",
        "\nBy the time Grace Under Pressure came out, it was clear to fans and critics that Rush were skilled in displaying their own takes on trending musical styles. Their first two albums saw them successfully (in hindsight, at least) deliver heavy, driving guitar riffs in the vein of Led Zeppelin and Cream. The 1976-1981 progressive heyday displayed that the band could join such genre giants as Genesis and King Crimson, and both Signals and Grace Under Pressure showed us that the band could throw that style away for something more synthesizer-oriented and lyrically personal. Basically, Rush can adapt to the times exceptionally well. With that said, you could definitely say that 1985's Power Windows is likely Rush's most 80s-influenced album, as it explores many of the synthrock and pop sounds of the era... specifically, the huge emphasis on Geddy Lee's synthesizer work. After all, why deny the opportunity for reinvention yet again?\n\nAs soon as \"The Big Money\" makes its grand statement with a blast of synthesizer chords and Alex Lifeson's mix between chords and rapid-fire lines on the guitar front, you can already tell you're in for something both bold and oddly distant. Power Windows is a pretty bizarre album because, while many of its lyrical themes are personal and social, and the guitar work has a tone that cuts through the production to reach the listener on a more personal level, the synthesizers end up pulling you away at the same time. Songs like the electronic drum-oriented ballad \"Mystic Rhythms\" and the dreamlike tune \"Manhattan Project\" have a bizarrely expansive and cold quality that, strangely enough, inspires more intrigue and warrants repeated listens just to catch every little nuance of this experimentation. However, Rush do make plenty of room for both more progressive and poppy arrangements to offset these darker moments. \"The Big Money\" is incredibly fun (despite its message of greed) because of how bubbly and fast-paced the instrumental work proves to be once the grand opener. The same can also be said of my personal favorite tune on here, \"Marathon,\" which combines fantastic instrumental work in the verses (primarily that wonderful bass line from Lee) with a wonderfully inspiring chorus that features Geddy Lee at his best vocally. And of course, there's that great message about getting through the marathon known as life, and how tough the run can be. \n\nUnfortunately, just like with Grace Under Pressure, many Rush fans will likely be turned off by this incarnation of the group. Even for these ears, the synthesizer experimentation gets pretty old after a while. Once at the 6th or 7th song, one might just wish for a break from the ridiculously frequent keyboard use and instead go for some more guitar-oriented Rush music. Granted, there are a few songs that break the pace a bit in this regard, like the more hard rock-oriented tune \"Territories\" or even a good chunk of \"Marathon,\" but some may wish for more of Lifeson's guitar playing. However, the bright side is that he does have a larger presence here than he did on Signals, which almost cut him out entirely. Regardless, if you're in the mood to check out some of Rush's oddest material and you feel adventurous, Power Windows is a nice bet. It takes Grace Under Pressure's dark, cold sound and expands upon it with more synthesizers and overall experimentation. It's multifaceted, sparse, dark, and high in replay value. It's worth playing multiple times just to, once again, hear something you didn't catch the first time around. Just don't expect it to immediately be one of your favorite Rush albums... go in with the right mindset and you'll be all good.\n",
        "\nThis is Rush's fifth best album. Their fifth best album garners an 89. This album, much like their sixth, suffers from two very weak tracks. Rather than at the end, these are in the middle. This is a small transition for Rush, as they decreased their degree of hardness and metalness into more bursts of it.\n\nNeil is a great, possibly the greatest, drummer. His job on here isn't his best in my opinion, but it still surpasses what all but a few back then could do. Neil's playing is very aggressive and technical. Some people argue that he lacks groove, but I feel it's simply not emphasized in this kind of music. Prog usually doesn't need allow for groove to show up. He does keep time pretty well, which is a criticism born of disbelief. His lyrics on here are more down to earth than previously. Most of these songs are somewhat medieval in lyric and tone, such as referencing blacksmiths and kings.\n\nAlex does some pretty good playing on this album. I like his playing better on a few other albums, but this is still quite nice. His clean parts on Xanadu are superb. Being part of a power-trio with such good rhythm players doesn't allow him to show off or be as loud in the mix as usual. He is doing some very fine things, but you have to be willing to allow for some of it to sink in. He isn't as technical as Steve Howe or Uli Jon Roth, but he does do some interesting work. His diversity is probably his calling card. He can go from gentle cleans, to hard-rocker, to unique soloist. \n\nGeddy does a fine job on bass. He really was possibly the most skilled bass player in rock. Chris Squire is essentially at a level with him in prog, but Jaco Pastorius in Jazz would surpass him. In any case, I enjoy his bass' strong presence and his ability to make his presence mean something. He is far from an \"I'm loud but do nothing\" a la Frank Bello. His vocals are fairly high on this album, so those are bothered by this should keep that in mind. Geddy wrote some pretty good music on this. Xanadu is an epic that stands up to any bands. Cygnus X-1 isn't particularly a favorite of mine. It's probably the only song on here where the heaviness predominates rather than bursts, but the outer space story had been done better on the previous album, and the intro takes too long to segue into the song.\n\nCinderella Man isn't a good song. It isn't very interesting and I can't fully make out the idea it puts forward. It somewhat reminds me of the original Mr. Deeds, but that movie was so much more compelling in its idea. Madrigal is worse. Similar to what I said on Fly By Night, I leave it off my phone. This doesn't drop my review as much, as the rest of this album is greater than the rest of Fly By Night. I should also note that this is less aggressive than previous albums had been. The Yes influence was starting to really come into play, and they were beginning to incorporate electronics past the electric guitar and bass. This isn't as metal as 2112, so I could imagine some metal fans being less thrilled, though it is a very good album.\n\nThis is the weakest album of Rush's hot streak, but it's still a very good listen. There's only a few bands who have as strong a catalog as Rush, and they're truly iconic. I would certainly recommend this to most fans of prog, hard-rock, and early metal.\n",
        "\nThis is Permanent Waves, Rush's fourth best album. This is the album where Rush went from prog to proggy, so to speak. This still has a good deal of progressive elements, but it also contains elements borrowed from another band in a more accessible style. \n\nThis band would be The Police. Up until now, Rush had been primarily influenced by by hard-rock, Led Zeppelin mostly, and prog rock, Yes chiefly. After the difficulty of Hemispheres, Rush wanted to simplify. They looked around the music scene, and The Police fit the bill for a simpler influence. In fairness, The Police had a few proggy elements themselves, so the incorporation was doable. Imagine tossing these three bands into a blender, and you would get something quite close to this. Rush should probably be congratulated on their shift, as Genesis and Yes' turn into more mainstream-friendly territory did not work out as well as it did for Rush.\n\nGeddy changes his vocals a little on here. Pressure from the outside had convinced him to sing in a lower key than usual. Frankly, I liked his screams. I got into metal through guys like him, Rob Halford, and King Diamond. The screams did not bother me. Now, his nasality starts to be a factor. I will never understand why people prefer his more nasal vocals to his higher-pitched ones. His keyboards also start to come into play. Geddy never really was a great keyboardist, but I suppose it did add a little versatility. His bass is also a little louder on this album. His bass is always been audible, but this is essentially the beginning of the synthesizer period, and he overwhelms Lifeson more often than the other way around. \n\nAlex does a pretty good job on soloing here. His solo on Freewill is one of his best. It is a little atonal, but not in the Slayer way. He also shines on his classic intro to Spirit of Radio. Alex was very influenced by Holdsworth's ideas, very jazzy and weird if you've never heard of him. Basically, Holdsworth decided that he didn't need normal repetition and structure, and that he could work it out in the end. These ideas influenced many prog guitarists and Eddie Van Halen. The real problem comes with his rhythms. Alex is only slightly quieter compared to Geddy than usual, but now there's a keyboard who joins in from time to time. This means that while still very audible, he doesn't hit with the same impact. \n\nNeil drums as great as usual. His lyrics have changed a little from their previous album. The Sci-Fi is mostly gone, as are the heroic tales. This is where he starts to focus on real-life. I've never gotten the value of lyrics that appeal to real-life, but these are fine and can be rather catchy. The chorus to Freewill is probably the catchiest, but the topic is rather surprising. It is essentially in support of Atheism, which is rather funny considering the song became so popular. This is also the first year he won Modern Drummer's Drummer of the Year.\n\nFor all that people focus on Rush trimming down and the first two catchier numbers, the two epics are the ones that appeal to me the most. Jacob's ladder has this stretch from about a minute and a half in to five minutes in that is as great as any of their pure instrumental work, and there is a particular guitar melody in there that is one of the best I've ever heard. With Natural Science, it's a shifting song that never gets dull, \n\nThis rating is dragged down by a handful of factors. The song Different Strings is pretty bad. Rush should have really avoided those ballads. Geddy's voice is becoming more nasal, and he's starting to kick Alex out of the rhythms. Also there's not a truly great song on here. Nothing reaches a Xanadu, 2112, Tom Sawyer, etc level. These sound minor, but look at the score. I frequently revisit Freewill, Jacob's Ladder, and Natural Science in particular, but this is a pretty good listen from start to finish. I would likely recommend this to fans of all prog, more easily-digestible types of rock, and maybe some fans of heavy metal.\n",
        "\nThis is Rush's sixth album, and this is also the last of their pure prog albums. Frankly, It's also the last I would really consider arguing as metal. This album, and it's predecessor, were rather laid-back, but could still bring the old fire back from time to time. After this, that really didn't happen too often. This is the third album of what I consider Rush's prime, and It's also right in the qualitative middle.\n\nPeart's drumming is legendary. He was really past anything of his age, mid to late 70's. Most of the time when I'm discussing rock musicians, I leave out comparing them to jazz and even prog musicians. The latter two styles really emphasize virtuosity, and it shows. With Peart, I don't have to do that. There was not a recording or performing drummer until Hoglan that really outdid his performance here, by my tastes. For me, this always seemed like Peart's best album. The drum fills and rolls on the opening epic are awesome, and he never really backs off.\n\nAs far as his lyrics go on this one, their what was typical of Peart around this time and a little of the future. I have rather mixed feelings about how they bridged the previous epic into the new. It seems rather convoluted, and I would have preferred them separate. The battle of the gods is essentially interrupted by a voiceless spirit who screams and reveals himself as the previous protagonist. This is how they bridge it, and I don't much care for it. The Trees is often debated as to it's meaning, but I've always interpreted it as simply being against wealth redistribution, due to the equality by violent means at the end of the song. Circumstances really reminds me of some of their lyrics that they would use in the next decade, especially Red Barchetta. It is a simple song about a boy learning about an aspect of life, in this case, the randomness of it.\n\nGeddy Lee's bass playing isn't as legendary as Butler or Harris, but he essentially functions as a bridge between them. I believe he claimed that John Paul Jones was a major influence on him, but the way Geddy sounds is quite different. Jones functioned as this murky rumble that added groove underneath, and could throw in separate fills and lines without messing anything up. Geddy serves almost as a second guitar and has a rather melodic style, most similar to Harris in those respects. Geddy could make basically the same claim that Peart can, but I think Geddy didn't dominate rock to the same extent. He is great, but more top ten all time than competing for first. His singing is rather infamous. Geddy is a naturally high-pitched singer, and he utilized this register on the early albums. I don't see this as a problem for two reasons. The first is that most 70's vocalists did the same thing, so if you can't tolerate Geddy then 70's rock as a whole will be hard for you. The second is that as his register goes down, the nasality goes up, and I much prefer a banshee shrieking to a Bob Dylan. The epic of this album has some great lines for Geddy to sing. It's most likely the catchiest he had been up until this point, particularly the first two-thirds of Armageddon. It has a certain bounce, and his lines will stick with you.\n\nI always feel bad for Alex Lifeson. He was a great guitar player. He just didn't stick out as much in his time as they did. Peart tends to overshadow Geddy, let alone Alex. Now Rolling Stones ranks him 98 on a guitar list, and act like they're doing him a favor. Alex has several styles of playing, and this album leans heavily to his more melodic bend. I personally prefer his more aggressive style, but this is better than what he did a decade later. The solo on the instrumental is as great as people claim. It's one of the three or so best he ever did, and that is saying something. Apparently, the song is based on a dream he had. I don't understand that concept, but I suppose there could be some music theory at play that allows music to be based off a dream. It seems rather poetic though, and it is probably their best instrumental.\n\nThis album is short, but it shouldn't be a problem. This doesn't have a poor ballad eating three or four minutes, so you have to account for that. Also the weakest song on here, Circumstances, is a pretty good one. It has a fun feel to it, and I believe it makes their compilations every so often. Another thing I've noticed, is that Rush often get accused of pretentiousness. This word means to act as though you are or are entitled to more than you are in order to impress. Judging from all their interviews and such, I don't imagine people are referring to the members themselves, no they're referring to the music. It really bothers people that musicians should attempt to borrow from classical. I mention this to say that people who often see this criticism attached to them would be best served to just ignore it, most criticisms Rolling Stones leveled in the 70's have been dismissed, so should this one.\n\nIn conclusion, this is an excellent slab of early prog metal. Rush had more good albums, but not many. They began moving in a, \"proggy, but not prog,\" direction on the subsequent release. On the epic note, Rush's average song length didn't change much. They went from an epic and some short surrounding rockers, to all medium length. The next album still averaged a little over six minutes, once you removed the ballad. I don't see this as quite as good as 2112 or Moving Pictures, but that's about all it's short of. There isn't much prog metal that I would honestly put ahead of this. If you like prog of any kind, early metal, or hard-rock this does come recommended.\n",
        "\nThis is Rush' sophomore release, and the first that I myself own, as so much changed between the first and the second. The debut was largely Zeppelin and Cream worship that only occasionally hits the right spot. This is a different animal. For one, Peart is here, and all the changes that that brought about. For another, the production is better. Lastly, this begins to show the prog that would come to be a major part of their identity.\n\nThis is Neil Peart's first outing with the band, and acquits himself very well on the opening track. Anthem features many aspects that have come to define Neil and, by extension, Rush itself. Almost immediately, Neil's drums come in loudly and with more variety and technique in the first thirty seconds than Rutsey had on the whole first album. As well, Geddy's words usher in another aspect of the (early) Rush sound, the lyrics. Anthem is the name of a book written by Ayn Rand. She was a big proponent for Libertarian ideals, including the free-market. Some people are really irked by these lyrics, but I don't see why. Zeppelin around this time were singing about pseudo-mystical nonsense, Sabbath seemed to mostly poke at society and politics, and the rest of the scene stuck almost purely to blues tropes. I honestly find it a breath of fresh air to find a band from that era that isn't fixated on sleeping with their girlfriends or pining for the ones that left them.\n\nIn comparison to the debut, everything feels tighter and sounds better. The sound definitely has more punch to it, and that distinctly 70's airiness is almost gone. That's not to say that this doesn't sound like it was released in the 70's, but the production is not doing near as much damage. The rest of the band also steps up a notch. At this point, Lifeson was already a pretty good guitar player. He's never been a true riff-maestro, but he's still done some great work, and this is his first step towards that. His faster work on Beneath and his more laid back on the title track are pretty strong notches in his belt. Geddy as well has a nicer sound, but that could very well be the production. Suffices to say, his playing is very loud, so that's a strong point in this album's favor. His vocals are a source of everlasting debate, but I actually like them. They definitely stick out from the sound, and there's just not very many vocalists who sound like him. To those who aren't well-versed in 70's hard-rock or metal, they're high-pitched. His natural range is pretty high for a male, so it may take a while to adjust to his vocals even aside from the screams.\n\nThis is also the first album where the prog touches can be picked out and recognized. Rush' debut had long songs, but By-Tor is set up differently. It is an actual effort at an epic song where distinct parts come together to tell a whole story. This approach wasn't new for rock, but it was for Rush. Another proggy aspect is in their sonic attack. All of the instruments are very distinct and often quite melodic. Zeppelin, for example, was usually separable, but they tended to condense into a heavier assault. Rush was pretty heavy for the 70's, but they were also quite skilled even early on, so they could incorporate melody into it. What all of this means, is that they sometimes achieve the burst that a band like Yes often did of every member together and separate at once. Now, the pendulum still favors the hard-rock on this release, so these aspects aren't predominate, but from the perspective of their development are quite obvious in hindsight.\n\nThe tracks on this album are pretty strong and surprisingly varied. Anthem is an excellent album opener that essentially showed all that was about Peart. The title track is a pretty relaxed but fun number, and Beneath is a pretty speedy track compared to the rest. They flex their newer songwriting abilities with an epic that, while not to the level of some of their future works, can still be counted as a success. A few more good songs, and this would have rivaled some of their more famous brethren. The problem is that we have two longer and very weak tracks at the end instead. They are both slow and fail to create any atmosphere or even really be pretty. I have this on CD and simply clicked these two away so they wouldn't pollute my phone. They are that bad. Any of Rush's less popular works such as Caress or Power Windows do not trough as badly as these two. \n\nAs Rush' first effort to mix prog into their hard-rock sound, I'd say that they did pretty well. This album sowed the seeds that would define Rush as a distinct band that could be popular while also being weird. Through six songs, this holds up as a good listen worthy of anyone's time. The last two are a different ballgame all together. They drag down the rating in my eyes, but the album overall is still good. I would recommend this to any fans of hard-rock, heavy metal, or even prog-metal.\n",
        "\nHere we have Rush's album \"A Farewell To Kings\". Following their hugely successful \"2112\" record the band returns with full force with another great album. After the masterpiece that was \"2112\" the band now has refined their progressive sound, and is able to craft multi-part suites like they were nothing. \n\nThe album starts with classical guitar playing and ends with probably the heaviest song of Rush's career, which just goes to show how different these guys were for their time, ever changing. Even the shorter songs on this album are brilliant which shows how much they care about the overall product, not just individual songs, although they are clear favorites among the few. \"Xanadu\" being one of my favorite Rush songs is an 11 minute crusher of a song. Starting with classical guitar, and synths with some crazy percussion thrown into the opening instrumental passage. The song keeps moving, never really sounding entirely the same for long periods of time. \"Closer To The Heart\" which is one of the most known Rush songs is a quick 3 minute song made for radio airplay, but do not mistake it as a \"weaker\" song, it's still a classic and is obviously the most accessible song on the record. The last song that we will discuss is the album's closer \"Cygnus X-1 Book One\". Part one of the two part suite written about a man who drives his spaceship into a black hole to see where it will lead him. The song changes sounds and moods on a dime, and the ending may have arguably started the black metal vocal stylings, I mean just listen to Geddy Lee scream.\n\nThe instrumentation is exactly what one would expect from a Rush album, which means it's all extremely advanced proficient and will have your jaw dropping the entire time trying to keep up with the insane time signature changes. With crazy guitar riffs and solos from Alex Lifeson, awesome bass grooves and vocals from Geddy Lee, and great drumming and lyrical writing from Neil Peart. \n\nIn conclusion I will say that this is one of Rush's strongest albums. Filled with classic songs and great playing it's an album that you can pop in continuously and never tire of it. Rush in my opinion is the greatest band to ever grace our Earth and this album I believe is proof, because it is not their best work, but if you were not familiar with their work then you would automatically assume that it was because that's how good it really is.\n",
        "\nRush... The greatest band to ever create music (in my humble opinion). They are band that were never afraid to try different musical genres to fuel their individual sound throughout the 70's-today. Here we have Permanent Waves the band's seventh studio album and their greatest in my honest opinion. This album has it all memorable songs, complex time signatures, and just plain kick-ass music. \n\nThe album starts with one of the band's most famous songs \"The Spirit Of Radio.\" It's one of my all time favorite Rush songs and for good reason. Even though it's a song written for the radio it has so many weird time signatures and genre changes that if you hadn't heard the song, you would never be able to guess what would happen next (I mean really who saw that reggae part near the end coming). \"Freewill\" is another one of the their most popular songs, but like it's predecessor is technical as all hell. Filled with great guitar playing, and and awesome bass line you can see that although these songs are singles, Rush chose not to be lazy with them which is a reason why I love them so much. However the best song on the album is the album's closer \"Natural Science\". Starting with sounds of waves crashing into the ocean, great vocals and guitar solos sandwiched in the middle, and crazy drum fills to end this masterpiece of a nine minute song.\n\nThe playing on this album as said before is amazing. Geddy Lee is definitely the greatest bass player of all time and it shows especially during the song \"Freewill.\" His vocals on this album are also top notch as he begins to favor a more singable singing voice, rather than his shrieks that were used on previous albums. Alex Lifeson's guitar playing is fantastic as well, in an album filled with great riffs, and excellent solos where he shows off his talent without being overtly flashy which is good because his talent does not come off as pretentious. And last but certainly not least is the drumming god Neil Peart. This guy can really beat the living hell out of his drum set. And not to mention the lyrical writing on this album is outstanding as well. Although there are no multi part suites on this album, Mr. Peart learns to write in a more controlled and shorter format. And let me just say that his lyrics on this album are probably the best that he's written in his career. \n\nIn conclusion I will say again that this is Rush's finest hour. It is an absolute masterpiece of an album that flows so perfectly song by song. If you are just getting into Rush and are looking for a place to start, here it is. Put the album in your cd player, tape deck, record player, or just pressing play on your ipod and get ready to be absolutely floored by excellent progressive rock music.\n",
        "\nTest for Echo is an enjoyable, imperfect album that most Rush fans will never really touch. I was born the year this album came out, and by the time I had thoroughly explored Rush\u2019s early classics, they had released Clockwork Angels and just like that, there was never a period in my life that I remember Rush ever being considered anything less than legendary, infallible Gods. But having finally completed my collection of Rush\u2019s studio albums, I can see why many lost some faith around the late \u201880s and \u201890s.\n\nNonetheless, this album is surely a listenable one, even though it is the weakest of the 90s, with Counterparts and Roll the Bones surpassing it. After the synth-rock era of the 80s, it is nice to hear some variety in Rush\u2019s sound. \n\nAlex Lifeson is once again an important part of the band, and that\u2019s a relief. He eschews both the early Rush blues and the 80s Rush jazz for alternative rock. While that\u2019s not ideal, you can hear the occasional solo such as that in the title track, and it feels comfortable and familiar. And he riffs! Thank God for the riffs! They would get better and more complex in the 2000s, but at least they\u2019re present again! The riffs on \u201cThe Color of Right\u201d are almost Moving Pictures-esque in their catchiness and style, but much more subtle. Alex Lifeson is not the same guitarist here that he was on A Farewell to Kings or 2112, but he\u2019s able to showcase much more than he did on Power Windows or Hold Your Fire. One of the best changes to the albums of the 90s are the increased presence of the guitar, and I cannot stress enough that Alex Lifeson begins to come back to life on this album.\n\nI honestly rarely noticed Neil Peart on this album, and that\u2019s a shame. There are certain songs where he\u2019s very relevant, such as \u201cDriven\u201d and \u201cTime and Motion\u201d, because the time signatures are so odd. But I rarely heard something that blew my mind like in earlier Rush albums or in Clockwork Angels. This just proves that Rush was re-synchronizing itself. Like I said, there are moments where Neil Peart would deliver an amazing performance that busts your gut, but those times are few and far-between. The best moment on this album for Peart is \u201cTime and Motion\u201d, but it never really gets better than that, and this album doesn't do justice to my personal conviction that Peart is the best drummer of all rock and perhaps metal (I\u2019m leaving that one open, though I've yet to disprove it).\n\nGeddy is Geddy, and he delivers the lyrics he needs to, usually in a perfect and powerful fashion, but occasionally, such as with \u201cDog Years\u201d, with cringe-worthy conviction. This was about when Geddy was really losing the ability to sing as high-pitched as he used to. His voice still sounds great, though, and you can\u2019t really fault the man on losing an ability that\u2019s impossible to 98% of the world in the 1st place. I mean, only dolphins could hear his voice on Rush, and even though that\u2019s fucking awesome, Rush doesn't lost much conviction or power with lower pitched singing, though it does lose a little bit of variety. The bass is definitely an upside to this album, however. Geddy always delivers on the bass, whatever phase of Rush you look at. And that is exactly the same here. He runs up and down and all over the bass with magical fingers that can produce in riff imaginable on the bass. \n\nOne of the pluses for this album is the lyrics. Like most Rush albums, the lyrics can be downright awful sometimes, however. \u201cDog Years\u201d is especially guilty of awful lyrics. I understand what they\u2019re trying to get across; life can go by too fast when we\u2019re not paying attention to life. But, damn, could they not find another way to put that? Then there are other songs like \u201cTest for Echo\u201d, \u201cResist\u201d, and \u201cTotem\u201d all make pretty good points with insightful lyrics, even though the latter has a line that still makes me giggle: \u201cAztec and Maya dance around my totem pole\u201d. Perhaps that says more about my maturity than their lyricism. Regardless, this album criticizes TV culture, laments the tortured young eternal-activist, and dealing with heavy emotional burdens. This is balanced, however, with songs like \u201cDriven\u201d and \u201cHalf the World\u201d along with the aforementioned \u201cDog Years\u201d prove that Rush can usually produce some profound shit, but sometimes they just fail. Rush is human, after all, even though I often see them as Gods.\n\nOne of the things that I constantly heard about this album was that the songs are not very memorable or that they blend together. That is true to a degree because Rush was transforming from synth-rock band to an alternative/college-rock band and, as a general rule, alternative rock doesn't have a great variety of sound. \n\nIf this album had more life and variety, it would've been truly great, and it just falls short of being just that, in my opinion. Oftentimes the songs will start out deceptively fast before slowing to a mid-paced rock. And that\u2019s okay, but it certainly doesn't catch one\u2019s attention like they finally would on Snakes and Arrows and Clockwork Angels. And I hate to always compare this album to Rush\u2019s great work, but that\u2019s how I and most Rush fans will think about it. If this weren't a Rush album, it\u2019d be a great yet forgettable album. It is a Rush album, however. Test for Echo is a great effort, and a respectable album that falls just short of putting Rush back on the mountain of greatness they were on when they released Permanent Waves or 2112. Most Rush fans won\u2019t really care that much about it, but for those few hardcore fans, it\u2019s a necessary addition to understand the steps Rush would take to release a grand opus like Clockwork Angels.\n",
        "\nFew bands can boast a discography as rich, deep, and consistent as that of the Holy Trinity, Rush. Fly by Night, 2112, A Farewell to Kings, Hemispheres, Permanent Waves, Moving Pictures-All of these were classics by the time Grace Under Pressure came out, and with the exception of Hemispheres being an extension of Farewell (or vice versa), none of them sounded quite alike either. Rush had innovated so much by this point in their career that you'd think they would be ready to settle into a niche, and indeed they would eventually-Grace Under Pressure, however, is not that niche. \n\nStylistically, this album isn't too much of a far cry from its predecessor Signals. It does have a lot of the heavy focus on pop hooks that Signals had, but in my honest opinion, outside of the classic Subdivisions, there wasn't a whole lot of memorable material on Signals overall. Grace Under Pressure is essentially Signals with the biggest thing Signals lacked-substance. This album is also a lot more of a rock album than its predecessor. The synthesizers are there, but it rarely feels like they're suffocating Alex Lifeson's vibrant guitar leads or Geddy Lee's frenetic, intricate bass lines. \n\nThe production here is absolutely brilliant. Grace Under Pressure is the only album credited to Pete Henderson, and that is a damn shame. Everything sounds exactly as it should. The synthesizers are balanced perfectly with the shimmering, layered guitar work, the bass can be heard clearly throughout, and Neil Peart's drums have that fantastically cheesy \"80's arena rock\" feel to them. Where the hell was this Henderson guy when the painfully synth-drenched Power Windows was recorded? \n\nThe playing here is tight, controlled and restrained. There are no La Villa Strangiatos or YYZs here, and there don't need to be. Rush definitely didn't need to prove that they could play their instruments at this point (let alone that they quite possibly the three most technically proficient musicians alive) and they don't have any acrobatic tricks up their sleeves on Grace. Instead, what the band delivers here is eight catchy, prog-infused power pop tunes with a distinctly Rush feel to each. \n\nNeil Peart's songwriting never disappoints, and Grace Under Pressure is far from an exception. Even on the worst Rush album (which in my opinion is Hold Your Fire but that's definitely for another, much angrier review) there are great lyrics to be found. Grace Under Pressure has an unusually antiwar slant, having been recorded in the uncertainty of the Cold War era. Several tracks either contain references to or have been interpreted by fans as being about the Holocaust. Red Lenses is about global warming and the United States' impact on the environment. There's some personal stuff here too. Afterimage is an aching reflection on the loss of a loved one, and The Body Electric refers to the fear of total subservience to authority. None of these things are particularly uncommon in popular music, but keep in mind that Rush's comfort zone before this time was 20 minute rock operas based on Ayn Rand novels and instrumentals composed in Morse code. \n\nFinally, two more things really have to be noted. One-the hooks here are absolutely superb. Not only are several of these songs Rush classics, but Grace Under Pressure is overall probably the catchiest set of songs Rush has ever dished out. Rush isn't exactly a band well known for their big, singalong choruses, but this album boasts a few. How many bands could get a packed stadium of fans to sing along to \"one, zero zero, one, zero zero, one?\" Not too terribly many, I'd argue. Another, final thing that brings this album home-This album is probably the best vocal performance Geddy Lee has ever given. While I love the early Rush material as much as the 80's stuff, I was never a huge fan of his screaming vocals, and his performance here, while toned down, still displays a remarkable amount of range and control. It's not going to turn a Rush hater into an immediate Geddy Lee convert (his vocals are definitely an acquired taste) but it is really good stuff and should please any fan. \n\nSpeaking of fan pleasing, now I have to get to my main problem with this album-it rarely gets any attention from anyone but diehard Rush fans. I would actually consider this one of the best Rush gateway albums (though I'd still point a newbie to Moving Pictures first and foremost) and yet with all its casual appeal, it still gets overlooked on so many fans' \"best Rush albums\" lists. I suppose the pop flavor could be a little off-putting for many fans of the former prog-rock giants, but then on the other hand you have the even poppier Signals, which is considered a classic by many Rush fans both casual and hardcore. Ultimately, my message to anyone getting into Rush, check this one out. And to diehard fans who treasure this album the same way I do, I implore you to go out into the world and champion it to the Rush younglings. Let the brilliance of Grace Under Pressure be secret no more.\n",
        "\nRush is truly a weird band- they have always managed to deliver great material right alongside incredibly dull stuff, album after album, with few exceptions. It's almost like they have no perspective on the quality of their work; they just keep throwing it out there: some of it sticks, some of it doesn't, they move on. Signals is a case in point. While Rush deserves some big kudos for not simply following the formula of their previous, and uber-successful album, Moving Pictures, their ninth album is a mixed bag, sort of great in moments, pretty dull in others. It's not just that they brought in the synthesizers, instantly baptizing Signals as a product of the early 1980's- it's that the songwriting itself is several notches away from what they had achieved with their last couple of albums. \n\nWith only 8 songs, none reaching the 7-minute-mark (a minimalist milestone for the guys that brought you 2112) you'd expect some tight, exciting little nuggets, but there are none to be found on the album. At best, songs like Subdivisions, The Analog Kid and New World Man can be said to be catchy, but even those tracks lack the creative fire that Freewill (for example) did. And then there's the real sleep-inducing ones that just drag, such as the perfectly-titled Losing It, which I guess is supposed to be poignant since it's about a guy getting older and older, but just ends up getting boring and more boring. Same with the ironically-titled Chemistry, which just feels pieced together without any guiding musical force.\n\nThere's also some pretty clunkly transitions within songs- especially evident in tracks like Digital Man, which just sounds like three distinct pieces of music stitched together by a couple of Neil Peart snare hits and cymbal crashes. The fact that this song also sounds like a bad Police rip-off (both in Geddy's Sting-like reggae bass and in Alex Lifeson's sparse Andy-Summers guitar splashes) doesn't speak well for the song, either. On the other hand... it's not altogether unpleasant. Damn those boys, they can't either fully suck or fully rock!\n\nThe same dichotomy could be said for most of this album, and, hell, most of Rush's career- a combination of interesting and boring, brilliant and clunky, resting comfortably side by side and resulting in something usually listenable but only occasionally awesome. In many ways, Signals sets the template for the kind of material Rush has been doing ever since; while they are always tweaking and refining their approach, this style of shorter song durations and unconventional-but-still-basically-pop songs, mostly mid-tempo, has remained the basic compositional formula they work off of. I'm not really sure why New World Man, out of the hundreds of Rush tunes out there, remains their only actual hit song- it's really not that great, and they've done much greater. But if Signals is really the first album where Rush finally found their true nature, then perhaps it's quite fitting.\n",
        "\nThere's little point in adding praise to an overly-reviewed album such as this, other than to point out how quickly Rush matured from the juvenile 2112 to Moving Pictures. Whereas Permanent Waves was a big jump in structure, Moving Pictures was a big jump in quality. A great example is YYZ, which fuses their talented musicianship with some creative songwriting that did not exist a few years prior. Most of their fans gush over the \"progressive\" elements of 2112, but it's actually a pretty mediocre album, with a whole lot of nothing happening within the notes. To hear them deliver YYZ just a few years later, you'd swear someone else wrote the material- these guys were nowhere near that level of compositional creativity in 1976. \n\nThe album represents the breaking point between Rush's rock-n-roll roots and the more studio-noodling stuff they've been doing since. Given the quality of their work before and after this period, it's clear that the combination of youthful vigor and mature experience was a magical cloud that lasted a very short while. Side 1 is pretty perfect all the way through, while Side 2 stumbles a little with Witch Hunt, but ends strong with the we've-been-overdosing-on-the-Police Vital Signs (people claim they were doing reggae, but this is more like reggae twice-removed by way of Andy Summers.) If Rush's aesthetic turns you off, this album won't do much for you either. Geddy's high-pitched nasal singing (or \"singing\" if you're not a fan) is in full effect, as is the complete whitebread lack of soul that the band will forever be plagued by- but somehow, the trio manages to make it work for them in grand style here. They are what they are, and Moving Pictures is about as good as they ever were or would be. \n\nA coda: when I was in high school, I was dragged to a church \"rock talk\" led by a crazy dude named Joe Viera, who claimed to be a Rock Music Industry Insider due to his being a Grateful Dead roadie for many years (back then, that sounded really impressive!) His slide show deconstructed plenty of heavy metal album covers in Christian terms, pointing out the secret hidden messages these satanic bands were trying to sneak past an unsuspecting public. A side effect of his presentation was to introduce me to plenty of cool bands I didn't know about, including Rush- for in his eyes, these socialist satanists were all about ushering in a one-world state primed for the antichrist's arrival. Remember the 2112 naked guy walking into that pentagram? You can only imagine the theories that one evoked. \n\nThe most fascinating story he spun was about the cover to Moving Pictures, which, in Joe's view, was all about how the state was going to assume control of our lives. The paintings represent the new government's agenda; while the first group of movers are removing religion, the other guys are ushering in a state-controlled economy (dogs playing poker) and, of course, the satanic-spirit (represented by the naked man submitting himself to the pentagram.) \n\nTo the side, a woman, dressed in typical Russian Babushka garb, has dropped her groceries as she laments the takeover of this new government. Next to her, a Russian official (representing the new, communist state) is comforting her, because, you see, this new-world government is now in charge of everything, from the groceries our Babushka dropped to raising our children- as is evidenced by the guy standing next to him, taking charge of the two innocent kids. In the near-future (probably the year 2112) the government will assume total control of our food supply, our education, our spiritual life, our economy.\n\nWhile this is a perfectly paranoid interpretation of the album cover, it's also pretty damn convincing. Even now, I can't come up with a better explanation as to why the hell there's a bunch of russians watching the movers, nor can I find an answer anywhere on the interweb. Whether or not Rush meant this concept as a warning against socialism or a celebration of socialism (I would guess the former), we'll never know. Or, more likely, they never intended it as anything and the guy they hired to do the cover threw a bunch of shit together that he thought would be cool... but I will always love this album cover for it's creepy, powerful, probably-imaginary political subtext.\n",
        "\nIf there's any band that has a clearly-traceable evolution, it's Rush, who's albums read like a fossil record of this trio's fascinating growth. Permanent Waves marks the point where the band crawled out of the gooey ocean of their primordial life and finally figured out how to breathe air. They had taken some gasps beforehand, but this was something new.\n\nThe truth is, Rush was never much of a prog-rock band. Despite certain proggish characteristics to their music, it's really just nerdy rock n' roll; whenever Rush tries something epic, they fail miserably- they just don't have the compositional chops for long, sustained works, something they've finally figured out here on album number seven. Much to the chagrin of some of their fans, they \"went commercial\" with shorter, catchier tunes, and discovered that they were actually much better at writing that kind of song. \n\nThe first two tracks are classics and need no discussion, except to point out how full of ingenuity and creativity they ooze with. So much of Rush's previous work was wrought with tired sequences and strings of notes that did little, and here they've really pared down the notes and honed their craft- less is more, as they say. The side does end with a throwback to their longer songs, Jacob's Ladder, featuring a clever use of synthesizer and lots of those epic bits reminiscent of the space battles in 2112, except that they're actually interesting pieces of music with strong melodies.\n\nSide 2 mirrors side one, with two short tunes and a big proggy ender, but it lacks the creative zest of the first side. Entre Nous is alright, but not quite as catchy or as lively as The Spirit of the Radio, and Different Strings is just kinda boring the way Rush can so often be- a plodding melody, kinda-dragging tune with some interesting bits here or there. The 9-minute Natural Science, on the other hand, starts slow but really starts to rock out in a way that 2112 wished it had. It's still a far cry from anything Robert Fripp & Co. can deliver, but it's a fun way to end a strong, though imperfect, album.\n",
        "\nA tale of freedom and liberty versus repression and intellectual stagnancy told musically across twenty minutes. That's the simplest description that I can think of for the monolith of a title track, which after the critical lashing Rush received for its previous (and seriously misunderstood) record Caress of Steel, was indignantly placed as the opener of their upcoming fourth LP. Taking a damn-the-torpedoes approach to their music, this epic not only managed to achieve critical and commercial success, it helped the band shrug off the label pressure which had been trying to steer them to produce more accessible music.\n\nRush had sprung out as a bluesy hard rock band in the vein of Led Zeppelin, but that sound rapidly began developing into bold progressive rock with the addition of drummer Neil Peart. Unfortunately, critics loved to bash prog rock in the early seventies, and Rush received its fair number of harsh attacks. 2112 cowed many of them with not merely its excellent musicianship, but also its more serious subject matter over the fantasy ramblings that had dominated their previous records. Rush finally managed to connect with regular audiences.\n\nBut the record is most significant for the music contained within rather than the story behind it. The famous title track is a real monster- twenty minutes split across multiple sections. But while Rush had done that before with the song Fountain of Lamneth, the song felt more fully rounded and coherent, aided by Neil Peart's lyrical storytelling derived in large part from his Objectivist-flavored philosophy. The story is a surprisingly impactful one; a man in a future society, emotionally controlled and repressed by all-powerful priests, discovers a guitar and the beauty of music, but is spurned by the priests and dreams of a better time before committing suicide. In a time when censorship was hardly out of the question with the Cold War in full swing, stories like these really do resonate.\n\nBut it's the music that gives it the real power. The instrumental overture is pleasantly hard-rocking, segueing into Temples of Syrinx with its highly recognizable chorus. The next portion details the discovery of the guitar, as the complexity and melody increases with Geddy Lee singing the narrative of the protagonist's thoughts. Soon, the man presents his discovery to the furious priests. The man's words are backed with soft acoustic guitars and mellow vocals while the priests respond shrilly, distorted riffing behind them. A guitar solo ups the tempo, indicating the man fleeing from the priests back to his home.\n\nClean guitars and mournful vocals describe the protagonist's sorrow, but when he goes to sleep, a vast, astonishing dream of a long-lost age of freedom and artistic expression greets him. This ancient civilization, for reasons unknown, left well before the events of the story. The man is now even more depressed, having seen in his mind the beauty that the world no longer had left, and chooses to commit suicide, finding no more point in continuing in the present's stark, colorless misery. The energetic grand finale portion closes with the phrases \"Attention all planets of the Solar Federation... We have assumed control.\" This is obviously ambiguous, though Peart has since clarified that it is supposed to mean that the old civilization returned and ended the former rule of the priests and restored what had been lost.\n\nFive songs, not to be ignored, are also present on the album and show different flavors of what the band can do. Passage to Bangkok is a fairly straightforward rock song, not exactly unpredictable, but fun to listen to. Twilight Zone is more restrained and moody, while Lessons is a more upbeat and happy track dominated by acoustic guitars, with a great guitar solo on top of it. Tears is a mellow ballad of sorts, though I would say it's probably the weakest point on the record. There's not much noteworthy to it, unfortunately, but Something for Nothing closes the album on a good note with a very recognizable Peart lyric \"You don't get something for nothing, you can't have freedom for free\", exhorting people to take the initiative on their lives as the hippie culture of the sixties dissolved.\n\nWhile the other songs are quite good in their own right, it's Rush's legendary epic that had propelled this album into the annals of rock history. The songwriting and musicianship had dramatically improved from previous records and helped the band's enormous ambitions become attainable. It's no wonder that the album has repeatedly received praise across the decades since release and continued to gain recognition and popularity in the modern day, not merely because of its era-transcending theme but also simply because it's just damn good music.\n",
        "\nRush is truly a misfit band among misfit bands. They're not the popular kids, or the cool hipster kids- they're the geeks in the corner, except they've somehow sold zillions of albums worldwide. Critics don't understand their music, and, oddly enough, neither do their fans, as evidenced by this all-time fan-favorite, the prog-metal classic 2112. Except that it's not prog rock or heavy metal- just classic rock with pretentious aspirations. While it's definitely a leap forward from the ponderous Caress of Steel that almost sent them back to the Great White North for good, 2112 is far from anything that could be labelled \"a masterpiece.\" \n\nSide One is a big science fiction epic, and also the focus of every fanboy's awe. Let's briefly summarize the narrative, which reads like a high school kid's submission to Issac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine: in the year 2112, the world has been taken over by a fun-hating, soulless galactic state that has everyone living very dull lives. Some dude finds an old electric guitar collecting dust in a closet, thereby discovering the universal power of rock n' roll. He shows it to a bunch of space priests who tell him it's just an old relic- throw it away and get back to work. He then ends up old and in bed, dreaming about a better world full of music while some underground rebel army stages a coup and presumably restores happiness to the galactic federation. Frank Zappa would basically do the same story three years later with his rock opera, Joe's Garage, except his version spanned 3 records and was done as a joke (the story, not the music, which is pretty brilliant stuff for rock n' roll.)\n\nBut the 2112 narrative wouldn't be so bad if the music was amazing. After all, other prog-rock bands weren't exactly literary geniuses either, but they at least knew how to compose interesting music. And that's where Rush shows its hand (see what I did there?) While the members of Yes and King Crimson, to name a couple of Prog-Giants, actually understood music theory, harmonic progressions, counterpoint, and polyrhythms, the Rush guys were, quite literally, a couple of kids who learned guitar in their garage. I'm not knocking them, for they are, if nothing else, one of the hardest-working bands in the history of rock music; they just simply lacked the compositional chops these other bands had. Rush had started out as little more than a Zepplin cover band, and those limitations are still quite evident here, in album #4.\n\nIf you're a Rush fan convinced this is the greatest thing since sliced bread, listen again. It opens with drums doubling the guitars in pseudo-dramatic accents... and then launching into a supposedly-epic intro. Hear that bass line? It's basically the guitar line, one that's not doing very much. Hear the drums? They're just adding a basic beat for the other guys to play to. It's like a middle-school kid's idea of \"grand\". Then there's more dramatic cymbal crashes with a few guitar riffs strung together... as is the case 2:47 into the song, where we basically just switched from one rock riff to another. But stitching a bunch of guitar licks into a continual line doesn't make it complex, deep, or even that interesting- it's pretty much the same as playing all those basic riffs as separate generic rock tracks, as the band had been doing previously. All you've done is eliminate the silent breaks between them. Yes, the album is lot more fun and inspired than Caress of Steel, that's for sure, and that's what makes this album listenable as opposed to boring. It's just not amazing in any way.\n\nThe good bits are scattered about- Temples of Syrinx has some fun moments, for example- but these guys are still stuck on the idea that going from loud to quiet to loud again equals great art. Their slow stuff isn't pretty, or interesting, it's just slow. Side 2 consists of six typical Rush tunes, finishing with the strongest of the bunch: Something for Nothing, which shows how much their musical chops have improved. That these guys know how to play is clear, it's just the songwriting that's a far cry from the genuinely interesting material they would produce a few years later. \n\nAnd that's really what this, like so many Rush albums, is: another chapter in the progression of a band that started from humble beginnings and worked its ass off until it became legitimate. For that, Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson and Neil Peart deserve your respect, for the proof is in their playing. They really did hunker down and do their homework, album after album, hungry to reach a standard they heard in other bands they admired. But in 1976, Rush still had a ways to go.\n",
        "\nNever mind the silly song titles, the unintelligible low-pitched narrator, or the contrived attempts at drama. The big problem with Caress of Steel is that it's just boring. I've given it a lot of attempts over the past 20 years, and, no matter how fresh my ears are, the album consistently fails on almost every level. In the context of Rush's career, the story of how this came about seems clear (even if it's all conjecture):\n\nYoung trio from Canada has a breakout hit with album #1, earn themselves a big record deal, replace their drummer. Album #2 is more ambitious, shows more promise, hints at greatness. New drummer is into sci-fi / fantasy in a big way, takes over the writing chores, which is fine with his geeky bandmates. They're all pretty young, smoke lots of pot, have read Tolkien a hundred times, listen to Yes and King Crimson over and over. \"We can do shit like that!\" they exclaim. Result: Caress of Steel, their most ambitious album yet, and an epic fail both critically and commercially.\n\nThe opener, Bastille Day, is basically the only song on the album worth listening to, a big tease since the album just goes downhill from there. The first three tracks mark the end of their classic rock era, which is odd for an LP- they basically switch from Zepplin-wannabes to bad Genesis clones halfway through the first side, but whatever. It's what comes next that's the issue, as Side A closes with the best evidence punk music would need in their case against the pretensions of prog rock: The Necromancer, which is actually three D&D-style songs glued together by a narrator who's voice has been pitched down so low, it's impossible to understand a damn thing he's saying. Spinal Tap couldn't have written a better gag. Part 3 (or should I say, Return of the Prince) is even more egregious as it steals the main guitar riff from the Velvet Underground's Sweet Jane outright- but uses it to create the exact kind of thing the Velvets hated. Take that, Lou Reed!\n\nThe Fountain of Lamneth takes up all of Side B. I have no idea who Lamneth is, let alone what Narpets are, or what Panacea and Bacchus have to do with the narrative, but it's all in there, apparently. Which would be fine, if the music was strong- that's the problem. Yes was equally ridiculous in their lyrics and imagery, but Close to the Edge (which is just as long as this plodding mess) is musically brilliant- even today, it's beyond what most bands have ever achieved. Clearly, Rush wanted to create a gigantic, epic masterpiece, but they had no idea how. Just going from loud to soft to loud again doesn't cut it; neither does throwing in a bunch of syncopated guitar riffs that bounce between two notes and contribute nothing to your ear. People who claim that this was the first progressive metal album have no idea what they're talking about- just one year earlier, King Crimson had released their dark masterpiece, Red, an influential record that remains one of the heaviest albums of all time- and they're not even a \"metal\" band. Next to that, Caress of Steel is like three 10-year-olds playing \"grown up\". It's a cute try, but you just can't take its sound or compositions seriously. \n\nThe Rush documentary Beyond the Lighted Stage gives the impression that this was a misunderstood artistic achievement ahead of its time which almost killed the band off. I'm sure the latter half of that statement is true, and if it was the stumble they needed to get to that next level, then great. They've certainly proven their abilities, and everyone has to start somewhere. But on its own, Caress of Steel is pretty awful, and useful only as a vital piece to a historical musical puzzle. Listen to it as a history student and you'll be fine.\n",
        "\nIf you're only familiar with Rush's big hits, their debut album will come as a surprise. Far from the epic prog-metal of 2112 or the more hook-driven pop-oriented stuff of their 80's and 90's, this self-titled beginning is steeped in the Zeppelin-infused classic rock sound of the early 70's, as many reviews here have stated. But there's a few important details worth mentioning about this little debut.\n\nFirst of all, Rush might not be impressive, but it's definitely fully listenable, which can't be said for some of their later material (which is less generic but way more boring.) While the songs here are pretty standard rock n' roll, listening to them now reminds us that Lee & Lifeson were capable of more than what most critics give them credit for later on. The bluesy Here Again, for example, isn't exactly Blind Faith, but it's a legitimate blues rocker, and Lee's often-ridiculed voice actually manages a little soul (at least, \"soul\" for a nerdy Canadian.) \n\nThis is the only Rush album to feature drummer John Rutsey, which is essential to note as a contrast to human metronome drum god Neil Peart's contribution for the rest of the band's career. While Peart is obviously superior technically, Rutsey's drumming here has a warmth and youthful vigor Peart really doesn't ever nail- a key contribution to this album's success. Just check out What You're Doing and tell me Rush ever got that Zeppelin-funky again.\n\nLyrically, the songs are pretty standard-rock fare- that is, they do their job, but I wouldn't exactly call them \"poetry\". While Peart's lyrics aimed to make much deeper points, they've also been much more pretentious and self-consciously clever, so it's a tradeoff. The notable exception is also the song that saved Rush from a premature death: Working Man is an honest, blue-collar song about, you guessed it, the struggles of the working man, a track that sonically and lyrically connected with enough salt-of-the-earth folks in Cleveland to make it a regional hit, which led to Rush's first major-label deal. It still rocks hard enough to have gained a spot in Guitar Hero's canon of rock n' roll greatness.\n\nOther than that, the album serves as historical evidence that Lee & Lifeson had already honed their skills considerably, especially with Lifeson's hard rock guitar riffs (I'm not sure he ever got to rock out in a fun, cock-rock sort of way again.) While Geddy Lee's voice will always be a take-it-or-leave-it sort of thing, this is, at least, his best Robert-Plant-karaoke attempt. It lacks the chick-swooning testosterone, but injects some fun into their music that, again, is consciously missing from later releases.\n\nWhile prog-metal fans will find this a disappointing work, it's a nice, and important, piece of the Rush puzzle, if only to showcase a side of Rush rarely seen again. Pop it into your car's tape deck and hit the gas.\n",
        "\nRush has always been a hit-and-miss band, sometimes riding the wave of creativity successfully, and sometimes making some of the most boring music you'll ever hear. Roll the Bones is, thankfully, in the first category. After dipping their toes into the synth-driven mid-80's style of dreary, keyboard-laden pop, Rush started swimming towards more rock-oriented waters with Presto, a solid album. Roll the Bones improves on that direction with a release that manages to rock out in that quintessential Rush way, yet remain accessible and- dare I say it- fairly commercial. \n\nBut not in a bad way; in fact, what makes Roll the Bones a definite winner is the songwriting, which hits a consistent high point here- a rarity for the band. For every Tom Sawyer there are plenty of uninspired compositions in the Rush oeuvre. Because the trio is so talented, fans tend to overlook this vital detail, but the fact is, a lot of Rush's songs, in a notes-on-paper way, aren't that interesting; a dangerous flaw when you're a band often guilty of being soulless. For whatever reason, however, Roll the Bones is full of strong melodies and satisfying instrumental interplay, giving these musicians a solid platform on which to show off their chops. \n\nDreamline kicks things off with a catchy guitar riff and one of those strong vocal melodies that set the tone for the album, followed, oddly, by the slower Bravado, which is actually kind of pretty (a rarity in the Rush canon.) But it's the title track that really kicks things into gear- a funky, fun effort for a band that is usually neither funky nor fun, complete with a silly-but-somehow-perfectly-fitting white-boy rap on the trail of a great Alex Lifeson guitar solo. Roll the Bones shows that the band is still capable of great things when everything comes together.\n\nLifeson, in fact, might just be the star of this album. Perhaps because his guitar was in hibernation for the last several years, he really lets loose here with some of his best playing (and writing,) really pushing these songs to a higher level as they rise up to the musical challenges his bandmates throw at him. \n\nIt's this perfect balance and interplay between drum, bass and guitar that makes Roll the Bones so groovy, most evident in Where's My Thing? an instrumental jam that stands up there with the best of Rush's efforts, and by far the best track on the album. It's the song that made me realize how much better Rush is when they let their instruments speak by themselves, and how great it would be if the band ever decided to make a fully-instrumental album, because they write much more interesting music for their instruments than they do for Geddy's voice. \n\nThis album, however, isn't a bad second choice. The highlights are many, and even the weaker moments are still interesting, which makes you wonder why they've been so inconsistent as songwriters. I'm not sure that Rush really qualifies as \"metal\", but with this release, they sure do qualify as \"great\".\n",
        "\nRush's lineup has held fast for nearly 40 years, through tribulations and timeless albums, to make an album that presents a distinctly 'Rush' sound and great quality. They broadly defined their sound across several eras, from explorative 70s prog rock to radio-friendly 80s rock to sour synth-rock, even to darker territories with \"Counterparts\" - aside from the kindly neglected keyboard era, this album shows Rush seasoned by all of them, yet unphased by time. As the next generation of prog, like Dream Theater - debuting in the same year as Rush's 13th album - has grown stagnant and begun to shamelessly repeat themselves, Rush display their mastery by refining their music rather than rehashing it. There is no stagnation here, only a Rush that have learned from both their mistakes and successes - there's no aging synth rock, but they learned from their timeless half-album 70s prog rock epics. \n\nRush understand how to blend and balance their three-man show. Geddy Lee's distinct, melodic vocals shine on every song, and his hard-driving bass playing shows through like it did on \"Counterparts\" as well as balancing Lifeson's guitar work as it did earlier. Lifeson's guitar playing feels natural, seamlessly transitioning through clean and dirty prog rock parts, even some very heavy hard rock riffs. Their style? Well, they sound like Alex Lifeson. It's hard to talk about this album without rhetorically mentioning that it sounds like Rush - icons and masters of the style. They have excellent control of their songs, flowing from melodic vocal-driven parts reminiscent of \"Moving Pictures\" to elegantly condensed versions of their 70s epics without the notoriously awful Ayn Rand-inspired lyrics that Neal penned as an immature objectivist. Peart's name is a sufficient testament to his drumming at this point, and his lyrics have matured and been refined through collaboration with a sci-fi novelist (Kevin Anderson) to form the album's concept. \n\nIt took a long stride for Rush to reach this album, and it stands up to their greatest works. Bands aren't supposed to be this good 44 years into their career, but Rush eclipse even the other legends.\n",
        "\nEven though Rush has only released a small handful of albums since they came back from their tragic hiatus a decade ago, the beloved power trio has been pretty busy. This particular album was announced in 2010 and originally slated for a 2011 release, but constant touring and the Beyond The Lighted Stage documentary pushed it back a couple years. Fortunately there is no such thing as a bad Rush album and their 19th in the line is certainly no exception.\n\nFor all the gaps between Rush\u2019s recent records, it is interesting to note that their overall sound hasn\u2019t changed that dramatically since the early 90s. This particular release does manage to set itself apart thanks to a dry yet exotic tone that suggests a grandiose desert setting. In addition, it also builds off the rawness of 2002\u2019s Vapor Trails and may actually be their heaviest effort since 1993\u2019s Counterparts though some may try to make connections to A Farewell To Kings or Fly By Night.\n\nThe shift back to aggressive territory (by Rush\u2019s standards) does mean the band members are as intense as ever. Guitarist Alex Lifeson gets an extra boost of heaviness and drives several songs while drummer Neil Peart never disappoints. Of course, Geddy Lee still manages to be the most standout member thanks to his overwhelming bass lines and signature vocal performance. He even brings the occasional keyboard back in with \u201cThe Garden\u201d in particular offering a graceful piano melody just before the climax.\n\nEven with all of the musical modifications, the lyrical theme is what seems to be the largest point of hype for Clockwork Angels as it has the band returning to a conceptual format for the first time since the 70s. That time period certainly had its share of suites with occasionally linked continuities, but this is the band\u2019s first true concept album. All twelve songs on here tell the story of a boy finding his way in a world of carnivals, watchmakers, and good ol\u2019 fashioned steampunk\u2026\n\nLike any good concept album, the lyrics never get in the way of the music and there is little in the way of atmospheric filler. While the lead singles \u201cCaravan\u201d and \u201cBU2B\u201d do an excellent job of setting a mystical stage lyrically and sonically, the songs themselves are nicely written and pack in some memorable hooks. There are plenty of other highlights as \u201cCarnies\u201d and \u201cSeven Cities Of Gold\u201d put out a heavy swagger while \u201cWish Them Well\u201d shows off some memorable vocal lines.\n\nThe album also stands out for bringing in song lengths that are slightly longer than the few releases. Fans hoping for another twenty-minute opus will have to keep waiting but these songs are excellently executed. \u201cThe Garden\u201d does make for a great closing ballad with some surprisingly emotional moments while \u201cHeadlong Flight\u201d is the fastest track and somehow recalls songs like \u201cAnthem\u201d and \u201cBastille Day\u201d with its heavy approach.\n\nClockwork Angels is at an odd spot in Rush\u2019s discography; it aims for a grander approach exemplified by their 70s releases but also stays close to the course set by their most recent efforts. The resulting album is one that manages to be pretty accessible yet seems to develop even more with repeated listens. The diminished keyboards may keep Rush from releasing another Moving Pictures but this definitely works. Let\u2019s just hope the next one comes out a little quicker\u2026\n\nOriginally published at http://suite101.com\n",
        "\nBetween 1974\u2019s debut and 1978\u2019s Hemispheres each new Rush record climbed to a greater level of complexity, intricacy and intellectualism. Yet, at some point, it becomes impossible to climb any higher. Hemispheres is the apex for Rush\u2019s progressive rock era. It\u2019s predecessor, 1980\u2019s Permanent Waves is a major pivot point in Rush\u2019s discography, a merger of their progressive sound with elements of new wave and synth rock.\n\nPermanent Waves introduces a variety of new approaches. The lyrics veer from fantastical allegories of the previous records to more direct and accessible philosophical reflections. Geddy Lee drops the balls-out wails and opts for a melodious and approachable tone. At times, the songwriting is much more streamlined and conventional (though some songs have quite twisted structures). On the surface, Permanent Waves sounds like a \u201csafe\u201d record, but nothing could be further from the truth. This is a deceptively daring record that offers a plethora of original ideas.\n\nThe subtle genius of Permanent Waves is best captured by opening track, \u201cThe Spirit of the Radio.\u201d Somehow, Rush manage to consolidate all the dimensions that make their progressive epics so impressive into a five minute radio-friendly song. \u201cThe Spirit of the Radio\u201d laments the over-commercialization of the music industry and the devaluation of true artistry. Ironically, this critique of commercial radio was itself a commercial hit. It\u2019s not hard to see why. Lee\u2019s vocals are warm and sincere and the guitar lines are absurdly catchy. Yet, what on first listen seems like a direct pop-rock hit is actually quite the compositional achievement. The song doesn\u2019t even have a true chorus. It offers four distinct but related progressions\u2014ranging from a heartfelt and fiery anthem to slow, groovy reggae\u2014that are weaved together through a series of sharp shifts in time-signature. It\u2019s really one of the most intelligent and compelling pieces of pop-rock one will ever come across.\n\n\u201cFreewill\u201d and \u201cEntre Nous\u201d are both excellent, straight-forward rock songs. Both songs have very conventional song structures that put the emphasis on Peart\u2019s profound lyrics and Lee\u2019s earnest vocal delivery. \u201cFreewill\u201d is a simple and direct anthem that challenges to take responsibility for our own destiny while \u201cEntre Nous\u201d is an eloquent reflection on the finitude of all human relationships. There\u2019s also a rather weak ballad, \u201cDifferent Strings\u201d. The moment Lee croons \u201cWho\u2019s come to slay the dragon?\u201d you know you\u2019re in for a heavy dose of cheese. While \u201cDifferent Strings\u201d is stronger than previous ballads such as \u201cMadrigal\u201d and \u201cRivendell,\u201d it is still plodding and saccharine. Still, even here, Lifeson offers a lush, jazzy guitar solo that goes a long way toward redeeming the song.\n\nIn contrast, \u201cJacob\u2019s Ladder\u201d and \u201cNatural Science\u201d are progressive goliaths. The former is a sonic depiction of a thunderstorm, a sort of prog-rock response to the 4th movement of Beethoven\u2019s Pastoral symphony. It starts with a soft yet devious melody and a military drum beat. The soft pitter-patter melody is occasionally slashed by heavy riffs that cut through the composition like lightning bolts. The composition slowly builds up to evermore intense passages of doomy progressive metal, before fading into a soft and reflective synth passage that slowly swells into a final burst of prog-metal. In contrast to the fluidity of \u201cJacob\u2019s Ladder,\u201d \u201cNatural Science\u201d is a little disjointed, both musically and lyrically. It opens with a dreamy acoustic passage that contains a brilliant analogy between human societies and sea-life in tide pools. \u201cAll the busy little creatures/ Chasing out their destinies/ Living in their pools/ They soon forget about the sea.\u201d From there it shoots off in several disparate directions: there\u2019s some scatter-brained synth-rock and some Queen-inspired anthem rock. It\u2019s all quite captivating, but it doesn\u2019t really flow as a unified composition.\n\nPermanent Waves is not the most cohesive or consistent of Rush\u2019s works. There\u2019s an undeniable dissymmetry between the giant prog rock tracks and the clean, straight forward pop-rock songs. Then there\u2019s the sheer brilliance of \u201cThe Spirit of the Radio,\u201d which fuses the best of both worlds. Still, any lack of overall cohesion is overshadowed by the sheer quality of the songs in and of themselves. Just as A Farewell of Kings offered an onslaught of new ideas that were then unified on Hemispheres, Permanent Waves is the breeding ground for countless new ideas that will be perfected on Moving Pictures. \n\nOriginally written for deinoslogos.wordpress.com\n",
        "\nIt starts bathed in swirling synthesizers. A sharp and angular hi-hat pattern is punctuated by a deep bass drum and taut snare, and we are introduced to (perhaps) the quintessential Rush song; Tom Sawyer. The black and red colours of the album artwork fits the mood of the music perfectly, dark yet pulsing with life. We are then introduced to Red Barchetta with its quiet, gentle guitar harmonics and deep, warm bass line while the mesmerizing lyric is sung, \"My uncle has a country place, that no one knows about...\", and the listener is taken on an unforgettable journey into what remains as possibly the finest album Rush ever recorded. YYZ, with its chiming Morse code introduction, is musical nirvana, a showcase for each musician's developing virtuoso talents, yet the whole track works as an emotional construct that evokes such a broad range of excitement, feeling, and imagery that you simply never tire of listening to its unfolding power. Limelight features one of Alex Lifeson's most evocative guitar solos and whilst sounding hyper-commercial, it is one of the most complex compositions Rush has ever written.\n\nThe Camera Eye is an epic, vibrant, and pulsating track that positively brims with energy and has some spectacular drum fills from Neil Peart. Indeed the drum sound on Moving Pictures really captures each spirited performance on every track with the tightness and fluidity of the drum flourishes helping to illustrate just how precise and powerful a drummer Neil Peart is. Witch Hunt (Part III of Fear) and Vital Signs close the album, each track completely different from the other and displaying just how experimental the band were at that time. The brilliantly dark and brooding Witch Hunt starts with the beautifully eerie, scene-setting line, \"The night is black without a moon...\" and explores the sinister wilderness of ignorance and prejudice. The song also explodes in places with some gigantic drum fills from Peart that are stunning on a good sound system. Vital Signs, which was quite shocking to many people upon the album's initial release with its strong reggae influences and electronic percussion, is the perfect end to the album and is a subtle sample of what was to arrive with the bold experimentation of Signals. The slick, polished production suits the tightness and sophistication of the music perfectly. Moving Pictures is arguably the definitive Rush album and is, in my opinion, one of the greatest rock albums ever recorded.\n\nI could never convey all of the emotion and memory invested in this record from the first time I heard it to sharing it with friends to listening to it walking in the snow beneath the moonlight and feeling so very alive.\n",
        "\nIt starts gently, acoustic guitar strings opening the first track, sweeping from left to right channels, accompanied by a soft keyboard melody, glockenspiel, and birdsong that bursts effortlessly into A Farewell To Kings. Medieval in feel and infused with a melancholic yearning, the middle section is delicate and heavy at the same time as ride cymbals ping, bass weaves up and down, and Alex Lifeson simply makes his guitar sing, but best of all it all sounds so effortless. This opening splendour leads us to the dark, mystical, and intricate beauty of Xanadu, a masterpiece of atmospherics and composition. \n\nThis is a wondrous Rush album and easily one of their finest moments. You really get the sense of adventure and experimentation that fired the band at this bold new phase of their recording career, the timeless Closer To The Heart proving that Rush can create a perfectly crafted song under the three minute mark and still showcase their developing musicianship. Madrigal, whilst melancholic and quiet, displays another rare short song that is both calm and evocative and always makes me think of some ancient, otherwordly winter, all burned broken trees, and cracked earth, a tired horseman with splitting boots contemplating the absence of a lover.\n\nCygnus X-1 closes the album in a brilliantly eerie and fearless manner. It is at once dark and brooding, slow and pulsating, and builds and builds into a spiral of chaos, then leaves the listener in a soft, space-like, and contemplative mood. In places, there is a real feeling of menace and of mystery. \n\nKings is a unique and complex album full of interesting ideas and truly exciting compositions. This is essential listening for lovers of intelligent music and fully deserves a place in the sacred halls of progressive rock. This is classic Rush.\n",
        "\nFrom the moment Neil Peart joined Rush, the group constantly pushed itself to ever greater levels of musical and conceptual complexity. This ascent reaches its apex with 1978\u2032s Hemispheres. Hemispheres builds upon the already absurdly intricate showcase of A Farewell to Kings by delivering even more complex compositions within a more cohesive and unified framework.\n\nHemispheres is not a concept album per se, but it is highly thematic. Each song deals with the struggle to find balance between seemingly irreconcilable dichotomies: emotion and reason, change and stability, individualism and egalitarianism. The theme is fodder for some of Neil Peart\u2019s most creative, imaginative and stylistically diversified lyrics. Musically, Hemispheres maintains the pastoral aesthetic of A Farewell to Kings, (like its predecessor, Hemispheres was recorded in Rockfield Studios, in the Welch countryside) but eschews the distinctly British sensibilities of the former album for a more Mediterranean feel. The complexity of the compositions and the precision of the performance are extreme. According to the members of Rush, \u201cLa Villa Strangiato\u201d alone took three times as long to record as the entire Fly by Night record. Despite the severe intricacy of the record, Hemispheres is loaded with excellent hooks and melodies. The harmony between intellectual and sensual stimulation makes Hemispheres not only one of the peaks of Rush\u2019s prestigious discography, but also one of the highlights of the progressive rock genre as a whole.\n\nThe album opens with the 18 minute sidelong track, \u201cCygnus X-1 Book II: Hemispheres,\u201d which stands as Peart\u2019s most daring lyrical effort. \u201cHemispheres\u201d combines the structure and themes of a Grecian tragedy (minus the tragic ending) with elements of sci-fi writing. Peart follows the Grecian model carefully, offering a prelude, several central plot-driven chapters (which contain both monologues and choruses) and an epilogue. \u201cHemispheres\u201d tells the story of a world in which humanity is trapped in a battle between Apollo, the god of reason, and Dionysus, god of love. Humanity is first drawn to Apollo; under his watch they create brilliant cities and indulge in intellectual contemplation. Yet, this intellectual life leaves the people feeling emotionally unfulfilled; thus Dionysus seduces humanity away from Apollo and convinces them to return to the wild and live off the bountiful land. The people revel in joy and pleasure until they are struck by a harsh winter and are left naked and exposed to an unforgiving environment. With both gods having left humanity dissatisfied, the people split into opposing sects of rationalists and romantics who engage in a futile battle for supremacy. In a strange twist, the protagonist from \u201cCygnus X-1 Book I,\u201d the captain of the Rocinante spaceship, brings balance to the world. Apparently, when he sent his ship through a black hole at the end of Book I, he ended up in this alternate universe. The gods are so impressed by his appeal for balance that they offer him a seat in Olympus, and he becomes Cyngus, the god of balance. Harmony between emotion and reason is brought to humanity and everyone lives happily ever after. Thus, the moral of The Cygnus Series is that if you take a chance on the unknown, you might destroy yourself, but you also might become divine.\n\nUnlike Rush\u2019s other sidelong tracks, \u201cThe Fountain of Lamneth\u201d and \u201c2112,\u201d which simply flow from one distinct passage to another, \u201cHemispheres\u201d actually interweaves numerous progressions, hooks and themes throughout its eighteen minutes, resulting in a surprisingly unified composition. Numerous motifs are scattered throughout (i.e. the hammering noise that introduces each god or the spacy theme borrowed from Book I to reintroduce Cyngus). Other progressions are only used once to accentuate a specific dimension of the lyrics. Lee sings with a lot of different intonations throughout the song. He presents Apollo and Dionysus as cool and detached, and Cyngus as heartfelt and impassioned. Both the vocals and the music mime the numerous shifts within the story. \u201cHemispheres\u201d is certainly a tough song to break into, but is well worth the time. The interweaving of the various feelings and themes brilliantly reflects the harmony and balance the composition praises.\n\nAfter the massive title-track, Rush offer \u201cCircumstances\u201d as a palate-cleanser. It\u2019s a short, direct and energetic rocker; but don\u2019t mistake it for filler. The riffs are sharp and heavy and Lee offers some killer high-pitched wails. Even on this more \u201cconventional\u201d track, Rush still offer a quirky duet between synth and xylophone during the bridge. \u201cThe Trees\u201d is a sardonic folk song about a political battle between maple and oak trees, which stand as caricatures of socialist and capitalist ideologues. The maples argue that the oaks are greedily taking all the light while the oaks argue that they shouldn\u2019t be punished for being born in the sunlight\u2014\u201cand they wonder why the maples/ can\u2019t be happy in their shade.\u201d The maples respond by creating a union, which passes a \u201cnoble\u201d law that all trees should have their branches cut so that everyone receives the same amount of light. There has been a lot of debate about whether or not the ending of the song is meant in jest or earnestness, but considering Peart\u2019s affinity Ayn Rand and Objectivism, it\u2019s likely that the ending is meant in jest. The song is grounded in a dainty little folk melody that by the second verse is beefed up with distortion but nonetheless maintains the playful spirit any that good fairytale should possess.\n\nThe album closes with the instrumental \u201cLa Villa Strangiato,\u201d Rush\u2019s most complex composition. Rush were obsessed with recording the track in a single take, but eventually accepted that the song had to recorded it in three parts. As a result of recording so many takes, the recording has a bit of hiss, which is especially evident during the quieter passages. It\u2019s a somewhat endearing remnant of Rush\u2019s drive for perfection. Despite the fact that this song is an instrumental, it still loosely retells a dream guitarist Alex Lifeson had. The song is split into twelve parts, each with its own subheading. From there, the listener can let their imagination and Rush\u2019s stunning musicianship fill in the blanks. Like \u201cHemispheres,\u201d \u201cLa Villa Strangiato\u201d achieves a brilliant balance of complexity and accessibility. The melodies are highly emotive while the endless array of changes in tempo, timbre and rhythm is totally dizzying. The full-throttle final four minutes are especially staggering. Just as impressive\u2014though for totally different reasons\u2014is Lifeson\u2019s beautiful and soulful guitar solo during the calm middle passage of the song.\n\nHemispheres displays the perfect balance of precision and passion. Every note, every lyric has a purpose and each musician is pushed to his limit. Yet, their strife is not endured in the pursuit of some austere sound but rather in the aim of creating a work of art that is emotive, visceral and compelling. Intellectual precision leads to emotional clarity and visa versa. The title track ends by lauding the ideal of \u201cthe Heart and Mind united in a single, perfect, sphere.\u201d To hear what that perfect union sounds like, look no further than the record itself.\n\nOriginally written for deinoslogos.wordpress.com\n",
        "\nHold Your Fire (or 'The Red Album' as I have fondly come to think of it over the years) is a rich, exciting record that, to a certain extent at least, finalised the experimental synthesizer period of Rush's career, in that the keyboards were used as a multi-layered textural device that was now a huge part of the Rush sound, although they had been using synthesizers as early as their classic 2112 album. Whilst it may not be as well produced as the exquisite Power Windows, this album holds some of their finest work - Time Stand Still, Prime Mover, Open Secrets and Mission. And yet, it is worth mentioning that there is not a single bad track to be found on Hold Your Fire, it is a very complete sounding piece of work. Some of it is uniquely experimental, the gentle sophistication of Tai Shan for instance, whilst the closing track sounds vast, almost overwhelming, the exotic, High Water.\n\nThere is some room for improvement within the sharp and 'thin' production treatment given, unlike the huge and full bodied sound of Power Windows (a personal favourite of mine) however, there is no denying the quality of the songs. It is probably best listened to on vinyl, for a richer, warmer, more 'red' sound, although the remaster can sound quite pristine on a decent sound system, add a touch of extra bass for punch if you have tone controls on your amplifier.\n\nNeil Peart displays a somewhat more open and personal approach to the lyrics than usual (at least at this point in his writing career...) on songs that deal primarily with emotion, power and also with the passage of time. The best example of this approach can be found within the wonderful Open Secrets and for me, this song features one of Alex Lifeson's most emotive and evocative guitar solos. It reminds me of a wild, haunted wind, pining and lonely, blowing through the leaves of trees on a hot summer's night. Indeed the whole album invokes a sense of deep red within me, of an evening at the height of summer, when the sky is crimson, almost bloody in its look and feel, a dark red that will soon turn to black as the first chill of the evening descends from green, lush hills and the air is hot and sweet. Geddy Lee's pulsating bass work during Open Secrets is also a thing of rare, moving beauty.\n\nPrime Mover is classic Rush, a complex framework of rhythms that stop and start, stop and start - 'the point of the needle, moving back and forth...' The music and lyrics are moving forward, in a fundamentally optimistic view and attitude that informs the listener that 'anything can happen.' This song is one of the reasons that I love Rush so much, it is at once outward looking and introspective, an echo of the sentiment within opening track Force Ten - 'Look in - look out - look around.' It is complex yet accessible, joyous in its statement of intent - '...thrill to be alive - the point of the journey, is not to arrive...'\n\nMission illustates perfectly just how accomplished Neil Peart had become at blending electronic percussion into his acoustic drumming, the middle section is nothing short of stunning, the mechanics of which can be seen in startling splendour on the Snakes and Arrows Live DVD, which for me holds the definative version of this song, also worth looking out for is Alex Lifeson's electric, searing solo during the end section, which simply shakes with emotion and you can see just how much he enjoys playing live. I read once that there is a version of Mission Rush recorded with Peter Collins that features a brass band, I really hope they release that version one day.\n\nTime Stand Still is another standout track, warm and quietly haunting, with some beautiful backing vocals from Aimee Man that fit the mood of the song perfectly. Neil Peart's drum pattern during the chorus never fails to please me with its pin-point precision and constantly shifting rhythms. There are some subtle, contemplative lyrics during the song, contained within the verse -\n\n'I turn my face to the sun,\nClose my eyes,\nLet my defences down -\nAll those wounds that I can't get unwound...'\n\nAgain, here is a track that is at once both introspective and outward looking -\n\n'Time stand still -\nI'm not looking back\nBut I want to look around me now.'\n\nThe final song that Rush wrote for the album is also the opening track, Force Ten. It starts with treated vocals and electronic drumming that sounds like a pneumatic drill before giving way to an urgent, busy bassline and driving snare drum pattern that carry us off into the journey of Hold Your Fire. It is a rich, rewarding experience that I find myself returning to, sometimes when there is a warm wind in the evening, the trees sway and late summer turns everything to a soft, bloody red and slowly, the first dark creeping tendrils of colour begin to float into the sky. By midnight the moon rides high over metallic cloud and the night sky holds its own circle of brilliant white fire.\n",
        "\nTest For Echo is one of those overlooked recordings much like Presto and Caress of Steel, an underrated Rush album with a strange reputation as being a little under par and patchy in places. It is certainly the first Rush album I bought that left me feeling slightly disappointed upon its initial release and maybe a little underwhelmed, too. However, over the years something else strange occurred and I found myself falling in love with this odd, but interesting 'art rock' album.\n\nOpening track, Test For Echo, is a classy composition (one of their best, in my opinion,with a classic Alex Lifeson solo) with an intriguing guitar melody; it is quietly eerie and subtle, backed with some beautiful bass work and tasteful synthesizer. Indeed, this is really key to enjoying the album: melody and subtlety. It is Rush, of course. The music is intricate and technical, but not in such an obvious way perhaps as, say, the astonishing heights of Hemispheres. The lush and layered instrumental Limbo is a good example of this, as upon first listen it sounds almost straightforward, like some everyday run of the mill rocker, but dig beneath the surface and there are a lot of shifting complexities at work. It really is an excellent piece of music. Water droplets, synthesizers, funk bass, and tight patterns of angular guitar make this one the most unusual Rush instrumentals.\n\nThe track Totem has a mystical, almost ethereal feel to it and has some seriously superior guitar work going on with so many ideas that make it a very interesting song in terms of colour and textures. There are some very cool harmonics placed within this track and a fantastic little bridge section just before the main solo bursts into life. This is why Alex Lifeson is one of my favourite guitarists; he has just the right blend of technical playing infused with a rare emotional intelligence.\n\nThe album artwork is worth mentioning. I especially like the picture in the booklet of the wolf amidst the rocks howling at the moon (engaged within its own test for echo) under a darkening sky. It is very evocative. The map illustration on the inside cover is very cool as is the artwork of the dogs and sledge driver that accompanies Driven. The entire booklet is a joy to look at, one of their best in fact. Hugh Syme is responsible and he came up with what I see as one of the best Rush album covers to date. I have the Japanese edition on my living room wall, which is a little different with the snow landscape being presented as a nighttime scene.\n\nTime and Motion is classic Rush, muscular, technical, and features some superb playing from every single member. I love the bass run (at 4.00) and Alex's wild, chaotic-sounding solo. Test For Echo is an album that positively brims with highly original and exciting guitar work. There are some great bursts of synthesizer (used very sparingly on this album) during the song that work really well and add another layer of colour and mood to the sound. There are also some interesting time changes which I believe alternate between 12/8 and 10/8 for those of you that are interested in such things. The lyrics on this track are just excellent, especially during that little dark, eerie, and haunting (again, almost mystical) sounding middle section.\n\n'The mighy ocean -\nDances with the moon\nThe silent forest -\nEchoes with the loon.'\n\nDriven is another highlight, heavy and full of great bass work from Geddy Lee and, as always, some first class percussion from Neil Peart. The cymbal work and detail is excellent, especially on the hi-hats, ride, and splash cymbals. The live version on Different Stages is the superior version (for me at least and is definitely worth checking out) with the bass solo section extended and several percussive improvements from Neil, the double choke on the hi-hat springs to mind and is not on the original studio version, so listen out for it as it is a seriously cool piece of playing. Live, this track really comes to life and simply sounds huge.\n\nDog Years with its bounding (almost punk) rock energy offers a glimpse at a more lighthearted version of Rush, at least lyrically, but it still manages to display Peart's seriously heavy rock drumming skills and it is embellished with some great technical detail. Virtuality has some rather awkward lyrics, but there is a wonderfully heavy riff and fantastic percussion both electronically and acoustically with an array of cowbells and pressed down snare drum fills that more than hold the interest.\n\nResist is another Rush gem, a beautifully-crafted folk rock composition, delicate in places, but powerful in others. Lifeson's soaring Celtic guitar line is a thing of beauty that almost seems to float; it sounds and feels emotional with an airy quality and always makes me think of a vast green hillside leading to a snow-covered mountain that conceals treacherous black rock while a light blue sky sits high above and the sun is a pale coin, remote and vague. It makes me think of Scotland, where I live.\n\nTest For Echo is certainly worthy of exploring again f perhaps you did not appreciate it first time 'round. Of course, as with all music it all comes down to taste in the end and the proof is in the listening. However, to these ears at least, there is a lot to enjoy if you are willing to give it some time and some serious critical listening. I would recommend trying to obtain the original 1996 edition of the album and not the remaster, as it is (in my opinion) the superior version. The quality of the booklet is better as is the sound quality.\n\nWhat is considered a rather average album by some, upon listening and studying, one may find that underneath the surface of the music, some hidden detail may reveal itself and you might just see that beyond the initially standard-sounding songs is something that is actually approaching and entering the realm of a very special album.\n",
        "\nFor me, this is the best Rush album since Counterparts, hands down. Within Snakes and Arrows there lies an array of quality songs. This is a very lush-sounding album with perhaps their best production treatment since Power Windows. I would like to make it clear, however, that this is an album that needs multiple listens to really take root within the listener's imagination. I would even go as far as to say that this is has become one of my very favourite Rush albums. \n\nIt is an absolute pleasure to hear acoustic guitars used to layer and add texture to this rich and colourful record. I do miss the synthesizers however, and really wish that they would bring them back (although there is some excellent use of the mellotron on several tracks) at least to a certain extent, as they can lend an extra level of excitement and power to the Rush sound. I have always felt that with Presto, Roll The Bones, and Counterparts, the balance between band and keyboards was almost perfect. The Pass, Bravado, and Animate are good examples of this 'blending' of electronic and acoustic instruments.\n\nThe songs are all first rate. From the quiet, slow-building power of The Larger Bowl to the intricate musicianship of Armour and Sword, Rush demonstrate that they are still masters of progressive rock. The Main Monkey Business is one of the best pieces of music that Rush has ever produced, a beautiful, exciting, and evocative instrumental that is on a new musical plateau, even for Rush. The Way The Wind Blows is another highlight and is, again, one of the finest pieces of music the band has ever created. The lyric, \"Like a solitary pine, on a bare, wind blasted shore...\" is pure poetry and is one of Neil Peart's very best. Also, from Armour and Sword, \"No one gets to their heaven without a fight...\" is another terrific lyric. Neil deals with the themes of religious indoctrination and adults pouring their beliefs and fears into a child's mind in a subtle and quietly intelligent manner. How many rock bands today are brave enough or skilled enough to write about this kind of subject matter without sounding preachy or patronizing? Indeed, the underlying shadows of religion and terrorism are a common theme on many of the albums tracks, all dealt with on several levels, and I applaud Neil Peart for his quiet, rational, and fundamentally sane views on the reality of the world after September the 11th.\n\nIf you are a Rush fan, you will already have bought this, and for those of you still pondering, it really is a great album with the best production the band have been given in years; powerful and muscular, mysterious and layered, the way Rush should sound. The songs are intricate and well-woven with lyrics that are deeply relevant in these troubled times. Armour and Sword and The Larger Bowl are full of subtle complexities and are as good as anything on 'classic' Rush albums. I feel we should also be thankful that these guys are still playing, writing, and recording quality music together after all these years. Perhaps even more importantly, Rush are still creating something with substance, something worthwhile. This is Rush unique, melodic, and exciting.\n",
        "\nPower Windows is that rarest of animals - a perfect album. Every track and the mood of the album is electric. It is also one of the very best Rush albums. Polished, slick, and glossy, but more importantly it is infused with layered depths of emotional and musical intelligence.\n\nGrand Designs and Middletown Dreams overflow with excitement, powerful pulsating bass lines combined with some of Neil Peart's most unusual, complex, and exciting drum fills fully brought to life by the lush, full-bodied production.\n\nElsewhere, Marathon and Emotion Detector burst with feeling via Alex Lifeson's stunning guitar work. The Big Money will make you wonder how on earth three musicians can create something that sounds so vast. I find the songs pulse with energy and vibrancy, almost like a living thing, and the craftsmanship and quality of the songwriting is first class. This is one of those records that can transport you to another place, like taking a walk on a dark evening with lightning in the sky and a brilliant full moon remote in the blackness. This is is a record that will make you feel alive.\n\nPower Windows is one of the best rock albums you will ever hear. Rush blended electronics with the full power of traditional instrumentation to create something quite extraordinary. To fully appreciate this album in its correct context, I strongly recommend the previous studio album, Grace Under Pressure (an album approaching perfection) and Hold Your Fire, the latter being the sister record to Power Windows as it shares many rhythmic similarities and contains further developments on the the themes of power and emotion. Also, Rush experiment further with the fusion of electronic and acoustic instrumentation. \n\nRush have never been afraid of taking chances, for they are musical scientists exploring sprawling new avenues of sound with a rare honesty and bristling intelligence. For me, Power Windows rates among their best work alongside Permanent Waves, Moving Pictures, and Signals.\n",
        "\nSprawling, dense, and timeless, Signals remains an absolute Rush classic. It is, for me, one of the most interesting and unusual albums that they ever recorded. Controversial upon release with its radical change in sound and direction, it is strong on synthesizer focus, yet nonetheless it features some of Alex Lifeson's very best guitar work. The Analog Kid, Chemistry, and Digital Man shine with emotion and technical brilliance, especially during the solo sections. They also have me scratching my head every time I hear \"the guitar really took a back seat on Signals...\". Subdivisions, The Weapon, and Losing It show Lifeson as an extraordinarily innovative, original, and experimental guitarist.\n\nThe lyrics in places are almost abstract and I often wish Rush (or rather drummer Neil Peart) had pursued this avenue of writing further as it enables the listener to interpret the imagery of the words on a more personal, intellectual level. Chemistry (one of those rare and fascinating occasions where all three band members share lyrical input) and Digital Man are possibly the best examples of this 'abstract' writing style.\n\nAs one would expect, the music is truly progressive. Rush blended elements of reggae and electronics into heavily technical rock whilst still retaining their own identity. This simply illustrated just how singularly unique and individual a band they were at that time and arguably still are. The Weapon still remains as one of the most powerful, dark, and complex compositions they ever recorded. Losing It displayed a softly melancholic side to Rush, a song which builds and builds with dazzling musical complexities that are almost jazz-like in terms of the fusion of instrumentation and time changes.\n\nSubdivisions with its almost scientific, musical precision remains infused with a million memories of the isolation and loneliness of feeling like such an outsider during high school years, of 'lighted streets on quiet nights', and being aware that you were in fact not alone because there were bands like Rush with people who felt just the same as you and somehow, magically, knew how to paint those almost unbearable feelings into a moving canvas of music and words.\n",
        "\nThe front cover - bleak, surreal, yet somehow optimistic, the font for the lyrics, the lyrics themselves, the labels on the original vinyl album, the egg in the clamp on the inside sleeve, the unflinching realism of the band photograph on the back cover - it all fits the album so perfectly. And the music...clinical in its execution, but infused with such emotion and energy makes this, for me, one of the definitive Rush albums.\n\nThere has been much talk about the 'overwhelming' use of synthesizers on Grace Under Pressure (indeed, from Signals through to Hold Your Fire) and whilst they are often at the forefront, they are used tastefully as a textural device to layer and expand upon the already huge Rush sound and add colour to Rush classics such as Distant Early Warning and Red Sector A. Furthermore, there is plenty of full-bodied and glorious guitar work on tracks like Afterimage and Kid Gloves. Between The Wheels features a monstrously heavy riff during the verses and some brilliantly heavy guitar work during the chorus, then just wait until that solo kicks in, easily one of Lifeson's finest - fast, fluid, and brimming with emotion.\n\nAfterimage, one of my very favourite Rush songs (the lyrics are pure heartbreak and read like poetry), also features tremendous guitar playing with another heavy riff during the chorus and one of those wonderfully odd 'chord-solos' that Alex was experimenting with at the time. You can also hear this technique used on Red Sector A and The Body Electric and reaches its experimental pinnacle on the punchy Kid Gloves.\n\nThe album covers some haunting themes - the spectre of global pollution, bereavement, the holocaust, and fear, all conveyed through intelligent, emotional, and passionate music. You really need to listen closely and study this recording, for it will not reveal all of its secrets upon first listen, but persevere and in time you will hear the subtle detailed beauty of this great album. Grace Under Pressure is classic Rush. This is the album as art.\n",
        "\nAfter the commercial success of 2112, Mercury Records finally gave Rush total artistic liberty. In truth, Rush were often doing what they liked prior to receiving their record label\u2019s blessing, but doing so meant they were constantly at risk to be dropped from the label. Now, having established themselves as a commercial juggernaut, the members of Rush were able to let their imaginations run wild, resulting in one of the group\u2019s most experimental and progressive albums, 1977\u2019s A Farewell to Kings (only its successor, Hemispheres rivals it in terms of complexity and progressiveness).\n\nAfter recording its previous three albums at Toronto Sound Studios, Rush traveled to Wales to record their next two albums at the secluded Rockfield Studios. The lush, bucolic surroundings are reflected throughout A Farewell to Kings. Save the final track, A Farewell to Kings maintains an idyllic sensibility. Many of the instrumental passages conjure images of rich, vernal landscapes while the lyrics often employ pastoral themes and imagery. Birdsongs from outside the studio are even integrated into the first two tracks of the album.\n\nWhile A Farewell to Kings might be inspired by the simplicity of the country landscape, it is anything but a simple album; it is loaded with absurdly complex and elaborate compositions. Within a given song Neil Peart will employ any number of bells, chimes and xylophones, not to mention his already massive drum kit. Similarly, Alex Lifeson will use up to three different guitars on a single song, including quite a bit of classical guitar. Geddy Lee is much more liberal in his use of synthesizers, resulting in a more textured soundscape. Compositionally, Rush raise the bar from 2112 with even more complex time signatures and razor sharp transitions. At times it is almost overwhelming following all the twists and turns that occur in a single song.\n\nRush throw out a lot of ideas on this album, and while most of them are successful, A Farewell to Kings is not the group\u2019s most consistent album. That said, Side A nothing short of perfect. The title track is kinetic, building from a soft acoustic intro into spirited, fast-paced verses and choruses before peaking in a throbbing, throttling bridge that climaxes into an elegant mid-paced guitar solo. \u201cXanadu\u201d achieves a similar genesis on an even grander scale. The eleven minute epic tells the story of a man who travels to the mystical, icy mountaintops of Xanadu in search of immortality. The protagonist gains immortality, but at the cost of his freedom. He is remains trapped in the \u201cPleasure Dome\u201d where he goes insane from loneliness and isolation. The moral of the story: It\u2019s better to die free then be enslaved for eternity. The opening five minute instrumental passage is one of Rush\u2019s greatest moments. It traverses a gauntlet of melodies, tempos and time signatures while employing just about every instrument in the band\u2019s vast arsenal. \u201cCloser to the Heart\u201d is equally impressive, though on a much smaller scale. Peart offers heartfelt, utopian lyrics that Lee delivers with energy and earnestness. The song also contains a joyous, ecstatic guitar solo that stands as one of Lifeson\u2019s best.\n\nSide B struggles to match the brilliance of Side A. \u201cCinderella Man\u201d is the closest Rush ever got to writing a song in the style of Lennon and McCartney and is sufficiently catchy, but \u201cMadrigal\u201d is melodramatic love ballad with synthetic flute solos and references to dragons. \u201cCygnus X-1: Book 1\u201d is the album\u2019s outlier. It abandons the pastoral spirit and returns to the deep-space aesthetic of \u201c2112\u201d: blubbery bass, heavy riffs and lots of echo. The song is one of the few instances where Rush sacrifice musical coherence for the sake of the song\u2019s concept. \u201cCygnus X-1\u201d is the first-person narrative of the captain of the Rocinante deep space shuttle. The captain becomes obsessed with discovering what\u2019s on the other side of the black hole Cygnus X-1, so much so that he drives his ship directly into the black hole. The music is excellent throughout, with tons of groovy riffs, quirky synths and ballsy screams from Lee. However, everything moves a little too quickly and some excellent passages are cut too short: the group chases the lyrical narrative while leaving excellent riffs in the dust. If Rush had taken a little longer to flush out all the ideas contained within this song, it could have been a classic, but as it stands it\u2019s a bit of tease.\n\nA Farewell to Kings is certainly less consistent than either its predecessor or its successor, but Side A is as strong as anything else within Rush\u2019s illustrious discography. While Side B has its bumps, it still contains a more than its share of interesting moments. Evaluated as a whole, A Farewell to Kings is creative, exciting and unpredictable\u2014progressive in the truest sense of the word.\n\nOriginally written for deinoslogos.wordpress.com\n",
        "\nA perfect score is definitely a worthy grade for Rush's most commercially successful album in their career. Moving Pictures is an album that continues in the direction that was started in what is Rush's masterpiece (in my humble opinion), Permanent Waves. Where their late 1970's albums focused on long compositions, this album continues their new trend to make songs in a more controlled and shortened format. \n\nLet's start with the overall performance. One thing I've always enjoyed about Rush is the fact that every member has his moment to shine in the same moment (if you listen carefully). An example of this would be in the band's most famous song, Tom Sawyer; during Alex's guitar solo you can clearly hear Neil blasting away at his drum kit and Geddy ripping his bass relentlessly where in most cases a guitar solo means all other band members should shut the hell up while the guitar reigns supreme, but in Rush they believe that everyone deserves to be heard, which is a philosophy we should all live by.\n\nNeil Peart in my opinion is the greatest lyricist in the history of music. This man's lyrics touch on everything from modern day life to philosophy to the strangest sci-fi stories one could imagine, and on this album you will get nothing different from the standard Neil Peart. As well as being a great writer, he is also an excellent drummer and definitely displays that fact on this album. \n\nThe songs on this album are all top notch. Of course, Tom Sawyer and Limelight are radio favorites, but the other five songs are just as great. A personal favorite of mine is definitely the love song towards the automobile, Red Barchetta. YYZ... what more could be said, it's their second best instrumental song (under La Villa Strangiato), and also the multi-part suite The Camera Eye discussing the over-bustling of city life. Witch Hunt, being the first song released in the Fear series (third chronologically), is a great track and the final track, Vital Signs, is a good reggae-influenced track. \n\nConcluding the review, I will say that if you enjoy progressive rock music, you should definitely get this album and then get ready to be blown away by advanced proficient instrumentation. And if you're new to the band Rush, this is a perfect place to start.\n",
        "\nRush dip their fingers into the holy water of prog and come out with a often misunderstood slab of rock. Everything you would come to know of Rush peeps out for the first time and shows its potential. Though this isn't the Rush we would all later know and love this record is definitely worth hearing to see where it all began.\n\nThe album kicks off with a great rock/bluesy riff in \"Bastille Day\" which all in all is a pretty good song. Some good riffs present themselves with Geddy Lee's supportive bass playing along with Neils precise drumming makes this song worth hearing.Throwing in some odd times here and there for prog's sake. This track has some nice cheerful energy and keeps the song moving without tiring itself out. A nice solo ends the song for a good wrapping and makes the song seem somewhat complete. \n\nFollowing is the more \"retro Rush\" song, \"I Think I'm Going Bald\". This is easily the weakest song on the whole album. The whole blues set up and ridiculous lyrics makes it hard for me to take seriously. The riffs are okay i guess, typical blues stuff that you've probably heard before. Towards a middle there is strange solo that seems kinds of out of place. It doesn't necessarily fit the song too well or really sound good at all. All of this combined make a really weak track.\n\n\"Lakeside Park\" makes up for the previous track by giving a great ballad like structure that is very chill. Lee also shows some cool independent bass lines here that make the whole laid-back feel even better. Peart's drumming is very laid-back as well. Making a tight pocket for a great chorus and verse. Peart also throws out some nice rolls in this track that fit well. Overall great track, best one on the first side in fact.\n\nOn to the first of two epics, \"The Necromancer\". This song totally kicks ass. Opening with, \"Into the Darkness\", a deepened voice over from Peart, and along with a great slow, clean chord progression, set up a good atmosphere for the rest of the song. Lee's scared voice tell the story of journeying on into darkness, which fit perfectly with the music. The song then makes a dramatic change into a dark murky blues riff that fucking rules. The rest of the song follows the same setup and makes this album totally worth your money.\n\nThe second epic, \"The Fountain of Lamneth\", though a truly great epic can kind of seem like five 4 minutes song played one after another with loosely connected lyrics. All in all this is the best track on the album showing Rush's true potential has prog artists. \"In the Valley\" has a great opening acoustic intro that fits well and the lyrics also tell a great tale of a man traveling to the mountains to visit the Fountain of Lamneth. There are some really enjoyable parts in this 20 minute epic. Like the slow parts on, \"In the Valley\" and \"No One at the Bridge\" which have some amazing clean guitar work, and fantastic vocal lines.A very great solo also makes its way into \"No One at the Bridge\". Not to forget Peart's great drum solo between the two, \"Didacts and Narpets\". Though it can be underwhelming it shows Peart's ability to roll quick and accurate 16ths and triplet rolls. \"Panacea\" and \"Bacchus Plateau\" feel like 2 completely different songs that have almost nothing to do with the epic other than maybe the lyrics. Not to say these are good parts they just feel thrown in and out of place. Following a reprisal of \"In the Valley\" the song ending feeling awkward and slightly incomplete as if they didn't know how to properly end the song.\n\nIn the end this is an experimental record in Rush's career and they seem to miss the mark in a few parts but it doesn't completely take away from this great record. This is a must have for any fan looking to see Rush's transformation into maturity and them trying new things.\n\nFavorite Tracks: The Necromancer, The Fountain of Lamneth\n\nLeast Favorite Tracks: I Think I'm Going Bald\n",
        "\nOver its first three albums Rush had covered a lot of musical ground. They had explored hard rock, prog rock, folk and heavy metal. They had played around with everything from radio-friendly rockers (i.e. \u201cFly by Night\u201d) to sidelong epics (i.e. \u201cThe Fountain of Lamenth\u201d). Rush\u2019s third album, Caress of Steel documents a band who is starting to congeal this plethora of sounds and styles into one cohesive aesthetic. However, Rush was not quite there yet; while often genius, Caress of Steel still suffers its share of growing pains. \n\nUnfortunately for Rush, Mercury Records, who signed the group based on the success of the Zeppelinesque hit \u201cWorking Man,\u201d had no interest in Rush\u2019s artistic development. The label wanted hits and sales, not \u201cpretentious\u201d conceptual songs. As one might expect from a dark, experimental album that contains two songs over twelve minutes in length, Caress of Steel didn\u2019t produce many hits or sales. The correlating tour (sarcastically titled the \u201cDown the Tubes Tour\u201d) was also a bust. Rush were in hot water with the label and needed a successful record to keep their career afloat.\n\nFortunately, everything clicked just in the nick of time. 2112 is the album where all the various pieces that make up Rush\u2019s sound come together into a cohesive whole. The first thing that stands out about 2112 is just how huge it sounds; it\u2019s on par with other mammoth prog albums like Yes\u2019s Close to the Edge, King Crimson\u2019s In the Court of the Crimson King and Pink Floyd\u2019s Wish you Were Here. What distinguishes 2112 is that it creates such a giant sound with not much more than guitar, bass, drums and vocals. While there is some doubling of guitar (mostly during solos or when acoustic guitar is added) and a few keyboard passages, the vast majority of 2112 is the product of just three instruments. \n\nBut what titanic instrumental performances they are! The tone of the bass and guitar is dense and heavy, and the riffs roar throughout. Peart plays with a combination of power, precision and technicality that makes the drums into both the pace-setter and at times, a lead instrument. The music is composed in such a way to allow Peart\u2019s brilliant fills stand out (i.e. the varied fills that come at the end of each line of the verse of \u201cThe Temples of Syrinx\u201d). Most prog rock bands have two \u201clead\u201d instruments: guitar plus one less conventional instrument, ranging from keys to flutes to violins. On 2112, Peart\u2019s fills are so distinguished and forthright that they essentially fill the role of the \u201csecond lead instrument.\u201d As for the vocals, Lee does an excellent job of shifting between soft, warm singing in a relatively lower register to unfathomably high wails. Lee uses these two disparate styles to create thrilling dynamics throughout 2112 (i.e. on \u201cPresentation\u201d, where the protagonist makes gentle requests to the priests who harshly turn him down). All of these sounds are accentuated by Terry Brown\u2019s phenomenal production job. There\u2019s lots of echo and reverb, which helps each instrument fill as much sonic space as possible and also brings life to the spacey lyrical themes. \n\nAll of these musical elements are quite a marvel to experience, but what makes 2112 a masterpiece is the way the sounds weave in and out of one another, creating compositions that morph like living organisms. Nowhere is this more evident than on the epic, seven-part, sidelong title track. The opening suite begins with the trio playing choppy, stop-start riffs in absolute harmony before traveling in unison through a glorious, galloping hard rock passage. When the music slows down again, there\u2019s a brilliant moment of inversion: the guitar is the only instrument holding a steady rhythm, while Lee and Peart take turns dropping blubbery bass lines and thunderous fills. The entire twenty-minute epic is full of these sorts of staggering shifts and transitions that are only possible when truly great musicianship and great band chemistry occur simultaneously.\n\nIn brief, \u201c2112\u201d tells the story of a futuristic society run by a priestly intelligentsia that brainwash the masses into believing they are happy. One day a boy finds a guitar and begins expressing himself through music. The boy wants to share his music with others, which infuriates and terrifies the priests. (There\u2019s a lot more to the story than this, but considering this is Rush\u2019s most talked about song, those who are curious will have little problem finding out the details of the story). \u201c2112\u201d is a story of the struggle to maintain authenticity and creativity in the face of the homogeneity of group-thought. Appropriately, the song is filled to the brim with inspired, impassioned riffs and vocal hooks. The song is so hard rocking and catchy that most listeners probably won\u2019t even pick up on the more technical happenings until the fourth or fifth listen, at least. While each part of the song is worthy of discussion, one part that is especially interesting is part III, \u201cThe Discovery,\u201d which describes the boy finding guitar and learning to play it. Lifeson communicates this process by gradually progressing from bare, unharmonious open chords to increasingly complex and beautiful chord progressions. Lifeson\u2019s heartfelt and excited performance brilliantly captures the thrill of discovery. \n\nWhile \u201c2112\u201d rightfully gets a ton of attention, Side B is praiseworthy in its own right. Rush was never a pure prog rock band and always had a more direct hard rock aspect to its sound (at least, through Moving Pictures). In the same way that Rush perfected their prog rock element on Side A, Side B is the perfection of the group\u2019s more direct hard rock dimension. On Side B, Rush finally move out of the shadow of Led Zeppelin and create cuts of fiery, upbeat hard rock that truly have a distinct sound that could only belong to Rush. These songs either tell vivid stories or describe intense emotional experiences; in each case, Rush finds excellent melodies and hooks to convey those stories and feelings. \u201cPassage to Bangkok\u201d captures the energy and exoticism of traveling in far off lands while \u201cTwilight Zone\u201d creates a spooky and trippy ambiance. Even the ballad (which Rush almost always strikes out on), \u201cTears\u201d is quite impressive, with Lee delivering a beautiful vocal performance, while guest mellotronist Hugh Syme provides excellent atmospheric backing melodies.\n\n2112 was a commercial success and consequently, gave the group the artistic freedom to do as they pleased on future releases. It\u2019s not difficult to see why 2112 has become such beloved album: it is a rare instance of a mainstream album that actualizes the ideology it expresses. Individualism, taking responsibility for one\u2019s own actions and pursuing one\u2019s dreams are the themes of 2112: Rush did exactly that by making 2112 the album they wanted it to be, rather than the one the label was begging for. Many lesser bands have not been brave enough to maintain their artistic integrity in that situation. While that might have resulted in a few more hits in the 70s, Rush managed to lay the groundwork for multiple genres of music with 2112. Neither progressive metal nor alternative rock would be what they are today without 2112. In the end, 2112 is a rare story of artistic integrity winning out over commercial greed, and honestly, who cannot find hope and inspiration in that?\n\nOriginally written for deinoslogos.wordpress.com\n",
        "\nCaress of Steel is the album that almost killed Rush. Upon its release it was lambasted by critics, ignored by most fans and drew the ire of record executives. There are some legitimate reasons why Caress of Steel received such a negative response. It is musically inconsistent, has an awkward flow and lacks an overarching vision. It starts with three straight-forward rock songs and ends with two massive prog rock epics. The first three songs tackle pragmatic and worldly subjects, while the later two tracks delve into fantastical and allegorical stories. The short songs are musically direct and emotionally simple while the latter two tracks are demanding in every sense of the word.\n\nThus, Caress of Steel is an album that simply cannot be looked at as a whole, because it\u2019s two elements are so disparate. This is somewhat true of Rush\u2019s next album, 2112, whose Side A consists of one 20 minute epic and Side B contains five short, catchy rockers. However, on 2112 there is at least stylistic consistency between the two sides (similar style of riffs, lyrical themes etc.), even if the song structures are worlds apart. In contrast, Caress of Steel is all over the place, both musically and thematically. This is especially true of the short songs, which sound totally different from one another. \u201cBastille Day\u201d is a fast-paced, fiery cut of hard rock that has an inspired sing-along chorus. Geddy Lee\u2019s elaborate bass-lines are prominent, though Alex Lifeson\u2019s regal guitar melody on the chorus is also unforgettable. \u201cI Think I\u2019m Going Bald\u201d is arguably the worst song Rush released prior to 1987. The song is a tongue-in-cheek blues-rock piece that throws the finger up at aging. The music is stale and the witless lyrics are some of Neil Peart\u2019s worst. \u201cLakeside Park\u201d is a mellow, groovy piece that creates a nostalgic atmosphere through a series gentle guitar melodies and dreamy rhythms. While tracks 1 and 3 are actually very strong, they feel totally out of place standing next to the leviathan tracks that follow them. In all likelihood these songs were tossed on the album for the sake appeasing record company execs with some radio-friendly material.\n\nCaress of Steel is defined by the two epics that make up almost three-fourths of the album. These songs are revolutionary for their interweaving of soft and heavy sounds, and dark and light moods to create labyrinthine emotional journeys. Both the song structures and the individual arrangements are very complex. These are difficult pieces to break into. They are not loaded the glorious hooks of other Rush epics such as \u201c2112\u201d and \u201cHemispheres.\u201d Nonetheless, these songs will reward the listener who takes the time to become familiar with their intricate terrains.\n\n\u201cThe Necromancer\u201d is a twelve-minute, three part suite. It tells the story of a land where people have lost their freedom and will power under the reign of the evil Necromancer. In Part I, three travelers hunt for the Necromancer in his forest, hoping to defeat him and regain their freedom. The music is gentle but dreary and spooky, perfectly capturing the atmosphere of a dark, foreboding forest. Lee\u2019s vocals are full of a fatalistic sorrow and Lifeson\u2019s bluesy solo provides a palpable sense of impending doom. In Part II, the travelers are captured by the Necromancer and taken to his torture chamber. This section is exceptionally dark and heavy for 1975, rivaling Black Sabbath\u2019s most evil moments. The bass and drums provide a low, doomy foundation over which Lifeson delivers a series wicked, menacing leads that bite at the listener like the various whips and chains of the torture chamber. Lee\u2019s vocals are harsh and grating; at times he flirts with abandoning himself to sheer screams. Part II begins at the pace of a funeral procession, but eventually reaches a blistering tempo with all three musicians executing slashing, technical progressions with riveting precision. Part II is ground breaking: the harsh vocals, evil atmosphere and combination of speed and technicality provide the blueprint for much of the metal that emerged during the following decades. In Part III, By-Tor, the antagonist from Fly by Night\u2019s \u201cBy-Tor and the Snow Dog\u201d returns, this time as the hero, and expels the Necromancer from the land, allowing the citizens regain their freedom and will power. The music is pure psych-folk bliss, full of sweet and joyous vocals and guitar solos.\n\n\u201cThe Fountain of Lamneth\u201d is even longer and more structurally complex. It is a six part, twenty minute suite that tells the story of a man\u2019s lifelong journey to the fountain of youth. The song is heavily allegorical and explores humanity\u2019s insatiable desire for immortality and the ultimate isolation of the individual in the journey through life, especially in the face of death. In his pursuit of immortality, the protagonist must endure social ostracism, abandonment by friends, the loss of love and the exhaustion that comes with old age. The hand of death looms large throughout the composition, sprinkling even the most upbeat moments of the composition with a sense of morbidity.\n\nThough \u201cThe Fountain of Lamneth\u201d is an engrossing journey, it is not as consistent as \u201cThe Necromancer\u201d. Part II, which is essentially a drum solo accompanied by a few harsh screams and heavy riffs is kind of cool when taken in isolation, but is disruptive to the overall flow of the composition. Part IV explores themes of love, sensuality and romance. As usual, things get ugly when Rush touch on the subject of women. The music is overly saccharine and Lee\u2019s vocals sound like a sorry excuse for a medieval madrigal. Still, the brilliant moments heavily outweigh the weaker ones. Part III weaves back and forth between dark, jazzy, prog rock and crunching heavy metal (a section that Opeth has replicated ad infinitum). Part V creates a wonderful tension by accompanying joyous psychedelic rock with exhausted and depressing lyrics, creating the aura of a final Bacchic celebration before death. The opening and closing acoustic passages contain some of Lee\u2019s most moving vocals, combing a sense of awe and wonder with profound pain. Overall, \u201cThe Fountain of Lamneth\u201d might not be as accessible as Rush\u2019s other sidelong tracks but once you break through, it's theme of mortality will resonate deeply.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to call Caress of Steel a great album because the songs are so distant from each other, both musically and conceptually. However, \u201cThe Necromancer\u201d and \u201cThe Fountain of Lamneth\u201d are groundbreaking compositions that set the bar for countless progressive rock and metal bands. Beyond influence, they are intrinsically powerful works of art that might have been too experimental for the majority in 1975, but sound surprisingly fresh today. Even if you ignore tracks 1-3, the final two tracks are essential listening for fans of progressive rock and metal.\n\nOriginally written for deinoslogos.wordpress.com\n",
        "\nSome bands come out of the gate swinging, while others gradually build momentum. Canadian prog rock legends Rush falls squarely in the latter category. Rush slowly cultivated both their progressive and hard rock elements over their first three albums before finally perfecting both on their 1976 classic, 2112. Just two years earlier Rush was simply one amongst hundreds of Led Zeppelin-worship bands\u2014and save one song, it fails to distinguish itself from the pack. Generic songwriting, underwhelming drumming and clich\u00e9d lyrics make Rush a weak link within Rush\u2019s otherwise stellar early discography.\n\nMost of the elements of Rush are lifted from Led Zeppelin (though the influences of Cream, Jimi Hendrix and Black Sabbath are also apparent). Overall, Lee does a good job of filling the role of Robert Plant. He delivers high falsetto with some cutting screams and possibly even more \u201coohs\u201d, \u201cyeahs\u201d and \u201cbabys\u201d than you\u2019ll find on any Led Zeppelin album. However, Lee falls comically short of Plant in sex appeal department. The lyrics replicate the sexual and amorous themes that pervade Led Zeppelin\u2019s discography, but the delivery is just awkward. Lee\u2019s voice can capture a lot of different moods and feelings, but \u201csexy\u201d isn\u2019t one of them.\n\nLee\u2019s bass work and Alex Lifeson\u2019s guitar work do a better job of emulating the Zeppelin sound. Lifeson provides numerous big, roaring, bluesy hooks and several ear-grabbing solos while Lee provides bouncy, bluesy bass-lines. Nothing on this album hints at just how talented these two musicians are, but for the type of music they are playing, the performance is solid. Where the debut really falls short is the drumming. It\u2019s hard to pull off the Zeppelin sound without someone to fill the role of John Bonham. Rush would actually one-up their icons when Neil Peart\u2014arguably the greatest drummer in the history of rock\u2014joined the group on their sophomore release, Fly by Night. However, John Rutsey\u2019s performance on the debut is way too safe and pedestrian. There\u2019s a scarcity of interesting fills and the execution lacks power. Part of this is due to the mediocre production (all the instruments have a fairly flat sound to them) but Rutsey\u2019s musical limitations are part of the problem as well.\n\nThe song structures are predictable and the hooks and choruses are unoriginal. The lyrics are pretty shallow and generic, dwelling mostly on romance and sexual desire without articulating those feelings in a seductive or visceral manner. Still, there are enough catchy moments to make Rush a listenable album. \u201cIn the Mood,\u201d \u201cTake a Friend\u201d and \u201cNeed Some Love\u201d have memorable choruses and Lifeson\u2019s solos are strong throughout.\n\nThe one truly standout moment is the hit single \u201cWorking Man.\u201d For one song everything comes together: Rutsey steps it up on drums, Lee provides quality lyrics and the trio finds excellent chemistry. \u201cWorking Man\u201d laments the banality and redundancy of the blue collar lifestyle and the unrelenting desire for something more fulfilling. Lee wails dissatisfaction over his thankless 9-5 job while Lifeson\u2019s guitar roars big, ravenous riffs that allude to the working man\u2019s yearning for thrill, excitement and meaning. During the extended bridge Lifeson delivers some killer soloing before the trio enters a tight-knit, fast-paced passage where they finally shows off their chops.\n\nFans of Rush should give this album a listen, specifically to hear the fiery \u201cWorking Man,\u201d but make no mistake about it, this album is significantly inferior to the group\u2019s next ten albums.\n\nOrignally written for deinoslogos.wordpress.com\n",
        "\nBefore Rush developed one of the most innovative and influential sounds in modern rock, the group was not much more than a Led Zeppelin-worship act. On the self-titled debut, Rush fails to even create top shelf Zeppelin-worship. The songwriting is overly derivative, the lyrics do not fit Geddy Lee\u2019s vocal persona and the drumming is far too vanilla. On its sophomore release, Fly by Night, Rush predominately produce cuts of Zeppelin-inspired hard rock, but this time they do a damn good job of mimicking the masters.\n\nFrom the opening notes of Fly by Night it\u2019s clear that Rush have improved their sound in numerous areas. Most importantly, the pedestrian drumming of John Rutsey is replaced by astonishing percussion of Neil Peart. Peart treats drumming like a master painter treats landscape painting. In the same way that the painter is careful to give each tree, mountain and stream its own personality through the small details, Peart constantly provides subtle variation, seemingly within each bar. His fills are varied and elaborate and add tons of color to every song. Peart plays with power and precision, which in turn allows Lee and Lifeson to play more technical progressions and employ a greater variety of time signatures. As a result, the compositions have way more detail and depth than those found on the debut.\n\nAnother major upgrade is in the production department. In contrast to the flat sound of the debut, Fly by Night is a robust recording, with each instrument filling a ton of sonic space. Echo and reverb are used effectively to create a rich textures, especially on the icy \u201cBy-Tor and the Snow Dog\u201d. The improved sound is partially due to equipment upgrades at Toronto Sound Studios and partially due to the superior sensibilities of Terry Brown (who would produce the next seven Rush albums).\n\nPeart\u2019s impact as a lyricist is also evident. Gone are the clich\u00e9d rock n\u2019 roll lyrics of the debut (save the Lee penned \u201cBest I Can\u201d) and in their place are Peart\u2019s poetic and fantastical lyrics. In addition to simply delivering some beautiful lines (the chorus of \u201cBeneath, Below and Behind\u201d is Pulitzer-worthy), Peart\u2019s lyrics fit Lee\u2019s vocal style very well. Lee\u2019s soaring falsetto is the perfect medium with which to express the dramatic stories and big feelings found in Peart\u2019s lyrics.\n\nWhile Fly by Night still stands the shadow of Led Zeppelin, Rush are at least resting beneath the right branches. Instead of trying to replicate the raunchy and sensual dimension of Zeppelin\u2019s sound (which just doesn\u2019t fit Rush\u2019s personality), Rush replicates the bright, upbeat sound of Zeppelin\u2019s mythological tracks such as \u201cBattle of Evermore\u201d and \u201cOver the Hills and Far Away\u201d. Even \u201cAnthem,\u201d which structurally resembles the visceral, erotic \u201cBlack Dog,\u201d attunes the format with philosophical lyrics and bright, spirited vocals. As a result, Rush sound less like out-of-place wannabes and more like Zeppelin\u2019s little brother who can\u2019t help copying his cooler older brother\u2019s style, but at the same time is at the cusp of developing his own identity.\n\nThat unique identity manifests on the eight and a half minute epic \u201cBy-Tor and the Snow Dog\u201d. Over the years, Rush have become known for allowing the instrumental segments of their compositions to express portions the song\u2019s narrative, and that is achieved brilliantly here. The first two verses set the stage, describing the a mystical world in which By-Tor and the Snow Dog prepare to battle over the fate of its land and people. The battle is expressed through screeching guitar and bellowing bass which shout at each other over racing rhythm before culminating in a series of heavy stop-start riffs that are executed with razor sharp precision. At first, the riffs are bridged by jaw-dropping drum fills, but after a while Rush just leave bars of silence between the crunching riffs. Eventually the composition falls into the dead space and enters the \u201cAftermath,\u201d a minimal and atmospheric passage that creates an icy atmosphere through chimes and atonal guitar work. The song concludes with a soulful, bluesy guitar solo that leads back to the third verse, in which Lee celebrates the victory of the Snow Dog.\n\nWhile \u201cBy-Tor and the Snow Dog\u201d is the only true masterpiece on the album, tracks like \u201cAnthem\u201d and \u201cFly by Night\u201d are beautiful and catchy pieces of 70\u2019s rock that are full of spirit and energy. On the downside, Fly by Night does contain some filler at the end. \u201cRivendell\u201d is a dull and melodramatic acoustic ballad that drags on for five torturous minutes. \u201cIn the End\u201d is nowhere near as boring, but it does lack a memorable hook and is bloated at almost seven minutes. Even if this album loses steam down the stretch, there is enough quality material here that it is essential listening for Rush fans. On Fly by Night Rush begin to piece together their identity and establish the excellent chemistry that would drive them onward through the next two decades. Even if everything isn\u2019t in its right place, Rush have clearly taken flight.\n\nOriginally written for deinoslogos.wordpress.com\n",
        "\nIn my one-man religion, I have several precepts that I try to rigorously follow. One says, \u201cthou shalt love Rush above everything else\u201d. Well, maybe not above Priest, Maiden or Pink Floyd, but almost. I also believe that if you don\u2019t like Rush, you have 99% more probabilities of being a douche bag. I mean, how could anyone dislike a band that has stayed true throughout four decades of existence and is composed of three of the most talented and influential musicians to ever walk the Earth? A band that has pushed the boundaries of musicianship while at the same time covering humane and universal themes in their profound and brilliantly written lyrics. A band whose music is unique, awe-inspiring and challenging in the majority of their albums. I\u2019m sure all this sounds as fanboy rambling but respect must be given where respect is due. And to add to their enormous list of accolades the band just released their 18th full-length in this great year of 2012, proving to the world that they\u2019re still relevant and in good shape.\n\nIt is my opinion that Rush\u2019s best works where released during that amazing streak of \u201977-\u201984, with the exception of the outstanding Counterparts and that they\u2019ve never reached that level of awesomeness since, save for a few songs here and there. And as it happens with other bands, some fans tend to overreact whenever these Canadians release new material. Therefore, I was initially reluctant to the hype surrounding Clockwork Angels, but after repeated listens I finally gave in and had to happily admit it\u2019s status as one of the band\u2019s finest albums of their entire career. It just blows most of the progressive records (metal or else) produced this year. It is a more cohesive record than 2007\u2019s Snakes & Arrows, superior though less varied. It is in fact, their best 21st Century album so far, and it demonstrates they\u2019ve been escalating in quality again. It\u2019s no flawless masterpiece, especially not when measured against their back catalogue, but it\u2019s excitingly close. \n\nYou definitely can\u2019t go wrong in picking this one up. IT\u2019S A RUSH ALBUM. Excellence is guaranteed. It\u2019s only a matter of how much of that you\u2019ll get. And the answer is: plenty of it. I haven\u2019t delved much into the album\u2019s story and lyrics yet, that I\u2019m sure are interesting on themselves, but the music alone is fulfilling enough to check it out. Throbbing bass-lines and a heartfelt performance by Geddy Lee, uplifting guitars by the ever underrated Alex Lifeson and Neil\u2019s trademark extremely tasteful percussion, all blended and distilled to produce a work of finesse that rocks as if these gentlemen were in their mid-twenties. An equilibrium of the three forces that empower this band. Though if my life depended on it, and I had to choose but one instrument as the ultimate ass-kicker from this album, it would be Geddy\u2019s bass. Damn! It\u2019s plain gorgeous. But none of the three gods ever abuse their dexterity. Forget about pointless exercises in self-indulgence. We\u2019re long past those. And the production work is just superb, I\u2019ve no complains in this area. It\u2019s crystal-clear, meaty, perfectly balanced.\n\nSo, standout tracks? My first choice has to be third single \u201cHeadlong Flight\u201d, which screams \u2018PROG!\u2019 during its whole seven minutes of bliss. It is indeed a return of sorts to their golden age style and a treat for fans of said period. This is a mandatory new addition to that hypothetic \u201cbest of\u201d setlist of the band. I imagine it will become a recurring number during their shows from now onwards. But make no mistake, this song has been carefully crafted and is no wank-fest nor show-off. It is a brilliant SONG, and deserves that title all the way. And so does \u201cThe Anarchist\u201d, which grabbed my attention at first listen, unlike the three preceding songs in album order. To fully enjoy those, I\u2019ve required further listens. Now I can safely state that there aren\u2019t filler tracks at all here, each and every one offering something worthy of your attention, which is a needed feat as five of them break the 6 minute mark. Another favs of mine are \u201cCarnies\u201d, which after 26 seconds starts with a Pantera-ish riff (WTF!? But yes, that\u2019s right, and it works marvelous) and carries on in extreme catchiness fashion; \u201cSeven Cities of Gold\u201d also displaying an extra catchy chorus; and the climatic closer, \u201cThe Garden\u201d, easily among their best ballads, majestic and delightful. \n\nRush again has provided us with a masterful collection of riffs, solos, rhythms and verses that invites us to dream and wonder. This album is deep, mysterious and while never stops rocking hard it requires multiple listens to fully appreciate. And remember this is coming from a Rush fanboy. Some parts and some songs may ensnare you at first listen, but the more you experience Clockwork Angels the more you\u2019ll be enthralled by it\u2019s brilliance and mystique. Keep on exploring and you\u2019ll discover more and more goodies. Yep, this is one of those albums. This is a pretentious-free prog rock crafted by the seasoned masters, and no prog-head should miss it. If you prefer tech death brutality or DragonForce sheer speed and note abuse this might not be for you. In that case I\u2019d say you\u2019ve no real taste, but hey, this is a Free World.\n",
        "\nWell, as I eagerly await seeing Rush live again (by the time this review is accepted I most likely will have already seen them), I feel it is time I formally review this record. IT is undoubtedly the most important piece of music to me, as I was completely ignorant of what music could do until hearing this. When I was a freshman in high school, I was driven to buy this album with my birthday money by some unknown force. Before then, I had zero, and I mean NO interest in music at all. Everything I heard on radio and what not did nothing but annoy me. but something about the spacey sci-fi cover intrigued me. So, there I was with the CD in my stereo....\n\nAnd it, frankly changed my life. The crazy Overture I can play in my head from memory at anytime at will. It is just THAT memorable. Then the softly but perfectly uttered 'and the meek shall inherit the Earth'. Simply chilling. That segment is actually what I chose to play on my graduation slideshow for my class when my picture came by. There were no other songs I even considered. Anyway, The epic title track continues with the viral Temples of Syrinx, another segment that will never leave the memory of any mortal man, with its shrieked cries of control and power over the Solar Federation. \n\nAt this point, little me was already blown away. He wasn't on this planet anymore. He was daydreaming. He saw the towering cities of other worlds, as a new realm of existence opened up to him. In less pretentious terms, I discovered my passion: music. But the song continues with a brilliant guitar piece by criminally underrated god, Alex Lifeson. Discovery is composed to sound like a person discovering the guitar, but in such a way that it is still awesome to listen to. The beautiful vocals of Geddy Lee really come through on this segment, though my favourite vocal lines come a bit later in Oracle: The Dream.\n\nPresentation forwards the story with the priests rejecting music, as I had. With the very high shrieks of the priests contrasting the soft spoken protagonist, this section is vital. But Oracle has to be my favourite part of the song. The build up of the guitars and vocals is just amazing. Soliloquy is the depressing part of the song, which comes with very sorrowful riffs and atmosphere which all culminates to the very heavy for its time Grand Finale.\n\nIt goes without saying that the entire song is stuffed with virtuoso drumming courtesy of God of Gods Neil Peart, with equally intelligent and rapturing guitars and bass. But the story itself makes it one of the best rock songs ever. It still holds up to this day as one of the best, and no prog epic has ever met it in the slightest. This song is truly amazing, and I could have gone on forever, but that wouldn't be convenient as time reading this review could be spent listening to this album.\n\nIt's side 2 that doesn't hold up as well now that I am older and a little more mature. If I wrote this then, this site would've been hacked, and this album would be the only album on it. But now I can look at it with much less bias (maybe still a little). Don't get me wrong, none of these songs are bad, hell none of these songs are bad at all, but I still can't give it the perfect score. \n\nA Passage to Bangkok is a classic, and is one of my favourites on side 2, with its bluesy sounding licks and its very atypical of Rush lyrics. Twilight Zone is second weakest track in my mind, but its chilling atmosphere keeps it memorable, especially the part about the giant boy making you his new toy. That always makes me smile.\n\nLessons stands as one of my favourite all time Rush songs. It's acoustic chords never cease to make me feel... happy. Very happy. The lyrics always make me think of the many happy memories I have, and that makes this song very special to me. Tears is the weak link here. It is a bit too soft for this album I feel. And even Geddy Lee sounds a bit bored in his vocal delivery on this one. Something for Nothing ends the album on a higher note, and its hard rock riffing is pretty memorable but not perfect.\n\nIn the end, (ha, Rush song!) this song is a near perfect masterpiece that everyone should own, but side 2 cannot live up to the epic. And no set of songs could. But I still can't give it a perfect score. So, though I owe this album a lot, and it is insanely good, Tears, the Twilight Zone and Something for Nothing don't stay with me. Still, a 98 out of 100 or a 5 out of 5.\nHighlights:\n2112\nA Passage to Bangkok\nLessons\nSomething for Nothing\n",
        "\nAnd what's worst, if you have exactly between this album two of Rush's majors ('A Farewell to Kings' and 'Permanent Waves') the only result will be, most probably, to become a \"kvlt\" favourite or recieve the shades of the forgotten-ness.\n\nAnyway, in the beginning, there was 'Cygnus X-1 Book I: Prologue' in the aforementioned album \"AFTK\". And here the things are very clear, clever and correctly prepared. The touch remains classy, refined, well purposed and driven. Feeling can be felt, the instrumentation works perfectly for the matter and leaves the expectator with desire of knowing how it continues. Then, when starting this record, you get there with the top of the emotions. But slowly, these are replaced with a bit of dissapointment. Specially because in the second part, 'Cygnus X-1 Book II: Hemispheres' the heavy hitting effect is lost. Everything gets shadowed by the attempt of doing something extremely big, extremely experimental, extremely kinda philosophical. I mean, being nerdies and lovers of Ayn Rand's literature is alright for me, but an excess in the attempt of make sounds on that behalf can finish in this pretentious and unworthy descendant of the previous Cygnus episode. Too much arrangements, too much synthetizers and non-pure sounds, too much mix and almost no blood, no nerves, no Rush's spirit.\n\nAfter this dissapointment, is hard to get it right again and the rest of the record fails to deliver, as well. 'Circumstances' and 'Trees', both look alike, they are almost throwaways, made in the outside, for the outside and without a point in here. Maybe 'Trees', with a more raw and heavy-like approach can do something for washing the face of the tracklist, but remains short, without enough testosterone, without that thing that amazed us in \"A Farewell to Kings\" or even \"2112\". Is the same feeling of the whole album, resumed in one particular and not-long-lasting-epic song.\n\nOnly with the arrival of 'La Villa Stangiato' (which almost correctly sentences as a secondary name 'An Exercise of Self Indulgence' as it is a premonition of what's happening in the album itself) we can remember why Rush is Rush. The bass-lines are quite heavy and tasty for any metalhead and the guitar returns where it belongs: the center of the tale. The guitar intro deserves some attention, as well. It was like a return to some roots, not all of them, only some, but with a futuristic vision. Here, we can find some of the ideas that shall rule in the modern stage of Rush, say, the beatboxing duo of guitar/drums in a cooperative rythmic fashion with the chromatic lead of some glowing and free-willed bass lines. To me, the best instrumental by Rush.\n\nFinally, yes, the album is too short, repeats itself over and over and, if you are not a huge fan of the band, like me, you will get bored and probably, you will leave it right away. If you do that, let me advise you, this thing deserves a little bit of your listening efforts, as many great ideas can be found here. And if you are a die-hard fan, well, let's admit altogether ('cause I'm a die-hard fan as well) that this one is not one of the finest by Rush and they can do much better. They did, actually!\n",
        "\nAnd finally, we reach the climax in Rush's development. After this, the eighties would take toll and ravage away most of the finest achievements by our favourite canadian power trio.\n\nThe thing is that, far from being a heavy metal album in it's own sense, it has that metallic touch and instinct with which we can all enjoy and expect some powerful formulas of joy and music. It's that way how it is here, despite the narrowing sounds, which fell apart from 2112 and A Farewell to Kings.\n\nFirst of all, here, we get a little bit of all what made the mythical reputation that was gained by Geddy Lee, Neil Peart and Alex Lifeson in the mid-seventies but in a more simplistic and straightforward shape. Directed to major audiences, getting away from the spectacular performances and entering into the playground of AOR greeting. Of course, far from criticizing Rush, one of the top-bands of their genre, we can only say that they did it perfectly great in here. See the example of \"Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow\": despite being a band with the most gifted player in neoclassical and traditional metal ever and a couple of the most talented guys (Dio, Powell, Airey...), they managed to shift their initial heavy metal style to a more AOR sound and, well, there we got that ugly time in the 80's Rainbow. This thing didn't happened (at least in Moving Pictures) with Rush.\n\nA couple of \"national anthems\" in terms of mainstream success are part of this record, name 'Tom Sawyer', 'Red Barchetta', 'YYZ' or 'Limelight'. And, in all, as stated above, they manage to reach popular agreement without leaving, at least entirely, their traditional style of composition. We are not in the territories when Magical Mystery Tour-kind of songs like the majestic 'Xanadu' or fans-favourite '2112' lighted and lifted us into a new world of the finest music of its genre. This is different. The sound is another. But, fortunately, it has the same feeling and that's what we most appreciate, for the sake of Rush's name.\n\n'Tom Sawyer' gets it right. It has a characteristic sounding, spacey/airey keyboarding opening with a bunch of heavy beating blasts by the drumming section and maybe the catchiest lyrics in the band's history. A powerful way to start the thing, with powerful resemblances of Permanent Waves. It has the Rush Touch (stupid rime, but yes, that thing actually exists) and it's enjoyable for both metalheads and AOR listeners. Almost the same happens with 'Red Barchetta' and 'YYZ'. The former is a song with lots of feeling, a nice guitar playing and an hypnotic harmony. Again, must be said, the lyrics are different, more for the suits of common listeners instead of philosophical themes or romantic poetry. The latter has a legendary reputaion, specially for being an instrumental rock piece without the presence of the drums and even so, reached kinda mainstream popularity. So, experimental shapes are on the mood here, as usual, but in a more AOR way, and the thing works perfectly for the issue, at least until this point; then, a little but non-escapable mistake appear in the final songs of the album: 'Limelight', 'The Camera Eye', 'Witch Hunt' and 'Vital Signs'.\n\nEssentially (and for avoiding a long a song-per-song review, I'll go straight to the point) the failure in those four tracks, despite their total enjoyability and some magic tricks made available by our gifted friends in the band, is that they contain lot of hybrid-ness. They are uncertain of their DNA, they don't know if they are progressive rock/metal flirting pieces or audience oriented songs. That's why, even if they are almost filled with usual subtleties by the band, completely digestible for any hard rock/heavy metal fan, in a strict sense, they are incomplete. Warm and powerful but fading stars. The weak spot among them songs is 'Limelight', by far. Sounds like a vaulted track resurrected from Permanent Waves but 25% lighter, and that can't be good at all, because that album has the exact ammount of \"heaviness\", considering Rush's style, and making this composition even lighter can't help very much. The song lingers as a weakling and that's unworthy for the band, no matter how popular the piece can be among Rush's fans (that would be me).\n\nAt the very end and after several times of listen, we figure out that this is a masterpiece album by Rush. The last addition in what I like to call the \"Rush's Holy Trinity\" (with A Farewell to Kings and Permanent Waves). It has some of the most straightforward and known songs by the band with some tasty touches of their classic creativity and inspiration in the rest of the tracks, maybe with a little bit of hybrid sounds and weakness, but a great album on its own by a legendary band.\n",
        "\nTwentieth record by a band that has been around for four decades, survived all the changes in musical scene with a ghusto, experimented wisely at times yet never quite straying away from their basic sound. Rush in many ways symbolizes perfection for a rock band. This twentieth record is a full fledged concept album based on organised religion. A novel based on the same is planned a friend of Neil Peart. \n\nTechnically the band is in monstrous form. The vocals are great; no not jaw dropping technically but deliver perfectly in terms of control and emotional captivity. His bass work is excellent. Let us say it aloud for once folks, Geddy Lee is the best bass player in the world. The mix highlights his bass very well and it is very delightful to hear great bass lines so clearly in these times where the engineers probably have forgotten about a certain instrument called the bass guitar. Need I say anything about Neil Peart's drum work? The drum work may have simplified from the days of Hemispheres but not one beat in this record is out of place. The guitar work is great and is just like what was in the band's prime years. The production packs much of a punch, and I would say that this according to me is the most perfectly balanced production I have heard. The drum sound is perfect, the rhythm guitar is crunchy, the bass lines are not drowned.\n\nAmong the songs, Clockwork Angels features 12 beautifuly composed songs, each no less triumphant than the last one. The songwriting is quite diverse and maintains the album's consistency perfectly. This album does not tread any new waters, but whatever music they present here is of the highest caliber I have heard. The songs are catchy and entertaining in themselves yet at the same time presenting subtle yet definite complexity throughout. The song length is perfectly balanced, and the songs are given complete room to breathe and grow. The song lenght is utilised perfectly in every song, and never do we hear anything sloppy or dragging. There is no song which I can claim to be a highlight. Oh well, a couple of songs say BU2B or Caravan maybe more catchy than the rest, but the album presents sharp consistency throughout. At the most by third listen every listener should be able to appreciate this album. Flaws, there are none; not on this record. \n\nIt is not always that you find a twentieth album to be so good that in fact it may be the band's one of the best. In an age where bands find it hard to come up with good ideas after ten records, these three young men who are just shy of sixty still push on and have great world tours. This record is must listen for any fan of progressive rock in general. Listening this album and looking at their recent tour, it does not seem that the band is ready to retire and it seems that they still have quite something much in them yet. But if they plan to retire, this will be the biggest send-off album that any band has made till date.\n",
        "\nDespite being the most influential prog rock / protometal band of all time and holding a solid place in the Olympus of music gods, Rush have, for most of their career followed, or at least tried to follow, contemporary trends. They went aesthetically bonkers with kimonos and whatnot in the 70's, fell in love with synthesizers in the 80's, and embraced alt-rock in the 90's. But after Neil Peart's personal tragedies forced the bands first hiatus at the turn of the 21st century, they dispensed with these attempts to be cool and just decided to do things their own way 100%, starting with their comeback album Vapor Trails. The rest, as Rush's massive following will attest to, is history. Now, after two albums of \"modern\" Rush music, their long anticipated steampunk rock opera has arrived. And it is a thing to behold.\n\nFirst of all, you'd be hard pressed to find a rock band that's gotten legitimately HEAVIER as time went on, while maintaining their consistently high level of musicianship. Save for orchestral additions on some songs, long gone are the window dressings they've utilized to great effect in the past. The album sounds big, bold, organic, straightforward, and intensely focused. From the monolithically metallic anthems BU2B and Headlong Flight to the ballad-esque The Wreckers and The Garden, the sound is always powerful without falling into the notorious loudness traps that Vapor Trails fell into. The mixing/mastering isn't absolutely perfect, but it's probably some of the best they've had. The only possible complaint is that it isn't as overtly flashy as some of their more famous albums and songs; nary a big, ear-catching moment from Alex or huge drum interlude from Neil, and Geddy's voice is much, MUCH warmer and more subdued compared to decades ago, but every song is still nonetheless perfect in its execution, showing the kind of cohesion almost 40 years of collaboration and touring will bring to a band.\n\nAs far as the lyrical concept, it's almost too soon to talk about it, as the tie-in novel won't be on sale for another few months. But from the song intro snippets in the CD Booklet along with the lyrics themselves, it paints a vivid picture of a world ruled by a clockwork point of view, a steampunk concept of predestination determined by an unseen watchmaker and his Angelic artifice servants. It's a journey for something of true meaning in a world where no one questions their existence. It's not always a pretty journey, but as the protagonist puts it, it's the best he could and that's good enough.\n\nAs a whole, Clockwork Angels is everything I wished for. I don't need another La Villa Strangiato composition or glass-shattering vocal lesson; this album does everything right anyway. Rush has produced something that shows their age, but their wisdom along with it. The trio have said they're far from retiring, but this album is pretty easy to visualize as an ultimate culmination of everything they've ever done. Things like Geddy's falsetto are gone forever, but what they can hearken back to is ruminated on and looked upon with fondness. Headlong Flight can easily be seen as their self-thesis on their career, Wish Them Well is pretty plainly their response to all the criticism they've ever faced, and The Garden...well...if they retired now, that would be the greatest epilogue to a band's history ever recorded. How they could ever top this one remains to be seen, but they were able to keep up the good work after 2112, so I won't doubt their drive for a second. \n\nIf this turns out to be their last album, it's a towering monster of a send-off. But if they've still got more gas in the tank, I can only imagine what they have in store next.\n",
        "\nAnd here we witness, yes, the magnus opus in Rush's career. Til' this date, unreachable for many things. It's hard to make differences between prior watershed albums like the overrated but nice \"2112\" or the brilliant \"A Farewell to the Kings\". It's hard to explain why this is it and why this one is not. Maybe, there is a subtle line that defines what can be detailed and what cannot. But we try, we do our best and we believe we are doing it without mixing the heart in the opinion, only using the braincells for the analysis.\n\nThis album, full of magic tricks, starts with an anthem: 'Spirit of Radio'. An innocent song, lyrically speaking (this shows us a shift in Rush's lyrical themes), it's about a guy who loves music and specially, non-sold-out music. In this piece we meet many of the concepts that we can find in the most popular songs by our favourite canadian trio, say the songs in \"Moving Pictures\". A brilliant and hard/heavy hitter opening with an actual rush of instrumental movements. The keyboards prepare the pathways for a powerful mix of guitar and bass kicking. Then, as a sudden, a rythmic change. This song is the starter of modern Rush's song, for the good or for the bad. And as a whole, the band never created (with the exception of the masterpiece 'Xanadu') something as vigorous, dynamic and multifacetic.\n\n'Freewill' is a good song, as well, maybe not as good as our opener, but close enough. The lyrics, once again, are proof of the shift in the band's lyrical themes. From Taylor Coleridge's poetry and Space Themes to \"Life Issues\". That's not bad, at least for me, as I don't care too much about lyrics, as long as they fit to the feeling of the music. Anyway, this song has some of the most intrincate bass lines by Rush and a distinctive paice. As I stated before, this song is almost like the second part of 'Spirit of Radio'.\n\nFrom this point on we enter in dark-like realms. 'Jacob's Ladder' has something enigmatic. While the sound belongs to the songs by Rush in the 80's, something here has the taste of the hidden and unique flavours of 'Xanadu' or the finest moments in the song '2112'. A bright, keen and full singing is suddenly broken by a thunder and lightning storm of magic drumming and guitar riffing. This is Rush doing their best, though is debatable if it fits into their finest songs. Mostly because of the hybrid sound. In any case, is a great song, worthy of Rush's bloodline.\n\n'Entre Nous' has something, as well. It's kinda a love song but in an original progressive shape. Even if the sound does not reach a level of excellence, is good enough for mainstream dudes, specially because of the more familiar structure it contains. Goes extremely well from times to times and it's catchy, somehow. The same happens with the weaker song of the album, 'Different Strings'. Although this means not that the track is bad one. Simply, stays in a more old-fashioned way of doing music, despite masterful drumming, which is always usual in Rush. Finally, we get to 'Natural Science', a song that gained the reputation it has nowadays for a couple of powerful live performances that gave us. Again, Rush progressive-ness gets to the highest point, an atmospheric feature, starts like flowing, grows bigger with a frantic bass-driven lyrical section and a petit but tremendous guitar solo and finishes ala-Rush, with an insane drumming combination with a scherzo-like timing and then, the fading, the waves... The permanent waves... The finest song in the album.\n\nThe only failure, in my humble opinion, is that the voice sounds very highened in the mix when compared with the rest of the instruments. That thing brings, as the only result, a little loss in the whole heaviness of the album and a little reduction of the effect that makes Rush an undabatable source of light and energy in the metal world: their instrumentation. Because, sometimes, the thing sounds hollow, overwhelmed by the voice, by far higher and ahead in the sound mix. Despite this thing, this album is THE moment of the band. They will reach their definitive recognition in \"Moving Pictures\" but this was the top spot.\n",
        "\nAfter the somehow start-grower \"2112\", very overrated everywhere though good stuff, good enough for starting a new way in metal, our favourite power-trio offers us this tiny but tremendous piece of gorgeousness. Yes, after the previous album cited above, they've learnt something. They finally have put the pieces together for bringing us what would be the first of the three masterpieces in their catalog.\n\n\"A Farewell to Kings\" is like \"2112\" but without most of the mistakes made in the latter one. Actually, is a full solid piece of work where the working society formed by this canadian dudes finally reach the peaking cota. The sound, as well, touches us in a more polished and clear way, with the enough amount of distortion and sharpness. Is a watershed in the evolution of Rush, an evolution that shall get to its logic conclusion in \"Moving Pictures\".\n\nThe main opener may not be a powerful headblaster song, but contains various amounts of Rush's multifacetic quality of composing. 'A Farewell to Kings\" is a nice slowpaced song with an unique accoustic intro and a great feeling in the singing. This song makes a magic trick and confuses us all with his enjoyable and hypnotic rythm, because right next to it we contemplate the growing power of a magnanimous force. Yes, 'Xanadu'. That track needs no introduction for Rush's fans nor progressive metal fans. The atmospheric introduction with a rubato-like beat and a multiple exchange between bass lines and the guitar is impossible to forget after heard. As an electric storm, the song grows stormy until the grand entrance by the singing. Never, ever, you shall listen a more heartbreaker and headkicker Geddy Lee than in this song. He simply owns you. When he arrives to the second chorus-verse in the phrase \"I've drink from the milks of paradise... Oh, paradise...\" (I pity you if you think sexually about this, it's based on a poem by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, though, well, it's laughable and the content debatable...) you are mesmerized, tamed, possessed by the Rush. The sole presence of this song makes this album a masterpiece.\n\nAfter 'Xanadu' is difficult to keep it up. And with 'Closer to the Heart', well, the effect is completely lost. Once I've said that, with songs kinda this one, Rush looks like a more rocker version of Air Supply. And yes, this song gets it very wrong, despite Geddy's great performance and a couple of nice interventions by Lifeson. Yet enjoyable, it's far from Xanadu's reach. For AOR audiences, though, this is a suitable song. The same happens with 'Cinderella Man', though here we got an exception, cause Lifeson drops us his progressive vein and manages to give, for this track, an unique melody. Rush have made a lot of songs like this one, in-betweeners, enjoyable but filler-like songs. From all of those, this one is the finest. Maybe 'Madrigal', being so short, so mellow and simple, is the major flaw here. Yet, this piece is not a total loss, as we recieve nice singing with a solid bass line. And when you compare it with other flawed pieces by Rush, which are not many, but there are (cough, 'Tears' in \"2112\", cough), 'Madrigal' is pretty decent.\n\nAnd, as usual, our canadian trio wants to surf over sci-fi waves and they launch us into the 'Cygnus' Saga. Here, the first part: 'Book One - The Voyage'. Another progressive rock-metal brilliancy, it contains some of the finest drumming combinations by Neil Peart, oh you fucking rule. The thing here is the alternative lines, even if the sound and the essence is the same, we got different shapes from the tunes made in the whole song. A bit funky, a bit groovy, a bit rocker, a bit bluesy, with much progressive sounding and as I stated before, a clockwork drumming. By the way, the song gets even better when you meet the second part, believe me it does.\n\nSynthesizing, we got here one of the three holy-albums by Rush. The continuation of \"2112\" but without most of the mistakes found there. If you are a fan of Rush, well, you can't actually consider yourself a fan of this band if you don't have this record. But if you are new with the band, this album is a nice way for having your first taste of it. Completely safe masterpiece.\n",
        "\nRush have been around for over four decades now and are still out there to fascinate several generations of progressive rock fans with new world tours and charismatic outputs. Many other heroes have gone a long time ago like Genesis or Pink Floyd, others have gone through weirdest changes and live from their past status such as King Crimson or Yes and a couple of great bands like Pendragon or Spock's Beard have never gone beyond the status of underground heroes that have more recently influenced progressive rock bands but never reached out for a wide spread commercial success. RUSH simply are the kings of progressive metal and have not written amazing records throughout their whole career and always tried out new things. Any cultivated rock or metal music fan should know Rush without the glimpse of a doubt. One can cite the epic conceptual masterpieces \u201c2112\u201d from 1976 as well as the critically acclaimed \u201cMoving Pictures\u201d in 1981 but also more recent stuff like the last output \u201cSnakes & Arrows\u201d from 2007. The brand new \u201cClockwork Angels\u201d must not hide behind these records and is another highlight in the band\u2019s brilliant discography. I would even go as far to say that it\u2019s among my very favourite Rush outputs ever right now but of course it hasn\u2019t passed the test of time yet.\n\nEven though I really adore this band, I must admit that their earlier works are not always easy to digest. The album structures are generally complex and often mix catchy, commercial and memorable short tracks on one side with rather experimental epics with a focus on instrumental passages on the other side. Many changes of style from hard rock beginnings over progressive experiments to shorter mainstream attempts divide the band\u2019s discography into different eras that are not always adored by every fan. The high pitched and somewhat feminine vocals of Geddy Lee have always been charismatic but kept the band from gaining a definite mainstream status and I must admit that I couldn\u2019t listen to them all day long.\n\n\u201cClockwork Angels\u201d is in my opinion the band\u2019s most accessible record and I mean this in a good way. The record feels so effortless, honest and powerful that it always outs a smile upon my face. The band perfectly mixes complex structures and diversified fresh song ideas with loads of catchy parts and addicting melodies you won\u2019t get out of your mind from the first try on. I immediately fell in love with this record and it hit very quickly. On the other side, each song offers many perfectly arranged details to discover over and over again and the somewhat autobiographic, emotional and philosophical lyrics of this conceptual masterpiece are more than ever worth to be examined a little bit closer. The lovely booklet may help you to take some time and get into the excellent lyrical attempts on this stunning record. I have also to underline that Geddy Lee\u2019s vocals on this record are simply amazing. They sound not as strained as they were in the past but surprisingly down to earth, mature and warm without losing their uniqueness. Usually, vocalists get worse as time passes by but with his fifty-eight years, he is at the definite zenith of his career and sounds better than ever to my ears. For all those that have somehow disliked his vocals, you should definitely give this record a spin as they are much easier to approach as they were in the past days. Not only the vocals have improved but also the already excellent msuical skills of the band. Add a top notch production to this and you might realize that there\u2019s not much left to criticize on this album. \n\nMusically, the short three minute tracks are as detailed, harmonic and precise as the seven minute epics. The band varies from amazing calm souns with space elements, decently soft sring passages, chilling acoustic guitar tones, peacefully pumping bass guitar lines and a varied kit of drum techniques in one single perfect song such as \u201cHalo Effect\u201d on one side to one of the heaviest songs ever written by this band with \u201cHeadlong Flight\u201d, a nostalgic anthem with a wild middle part where evry instrument has its time to shine even though the whole things remains coherently connected by a killer chorus that other progressive rock bands wouldn\u2019t write in their whole career. This album really offers anything you\u2019ve ever liked about the band. There are highly experimental middle parts in complex masterpieces such as the diversified title track \u201cClockwork Angels\u201d or the heavier pumping \u201cSeven Cities Of Gold\u201d. New things as the circus ambiance in the beginning of the diversified grower \u201cCarnies\u201d can be heard every now and then if you listen this record attentionally with your headphones on. There are also many potential hit singles that remind me of intelligent rock and pop music from the seventies and eighties as in the airy \u201cThe Wreckers\u201d or the very warm \u201cWish Them Well\u201d that has a melodramatic but also very positive message. T hese songs sound not nostalgic but so fresh as if they were done by some thirty year old musicians. RUSH are definitely still hungry and have a lot to say. In their whole career, they haven\u2019t written a twisted and emotionally driven top notch ballad as the closing \u201cThe Garden\u201d that sends shivers down my spine and almost brings me to tears each time I listen to it. \n\nIn the end, Rush deliver once again another highlight of their career on this intense record that iis already on a close run to become my favourite record of the year. Anybody who likes progressive music should call this record his own. It might one day be as essential as a \u201cIn The Court Of The Crimson King\u201d, \u201cDarkside Of The Moon\u201d or \u201cThe Lamb Lies Down On Broadway\u201d and should be seen as a modern classic of progressive rock that underlines in the best manners that this genre isn\u2019t dead yet at all.\n",
        "\nI want to make clear this: Rush is one of my favourite bands. But far from being an essential album in musical terms (in historical and commercial terms it is), this is one of their worst efforts. Blame this on being the first attempt they did, because they evolved and reached their peak in A Farewell to Kings, Permanent Waves and Moving Pictures, their holy trinity, but this one is far from those three, even if here we can find a couple of the embryonary ideas for the future sound of the band.\n\n2112 is the main piece here, a conceptual line story about science fiction, space travelling and a couple of mysteries. Honestly, the track starts promising with the famous \"Overture\", which has a bunch of powerful riffs and a nice mix of atmospheric keyboarding. A nice way to open any album. Then, we reach \"The Temple of the Syrinx\" and, by god, we actually stay on our sits listening to this. The rythmical pattern drawn by Neil Peart with his powerful and filling drumming, alongside a speedy and progressive tune leads us to the conclusion that Rush was not a joke. They were actually a force to be taken in count both in rock and metal world. Unfortunately, from this point on, \"2112\" enters into a hollow.\n\n\"Discovery\", \"Presentation\" and \"Oracle: the Dream\" are weaklings. They don't have the emotion nor the strength enough to keep your attention. Oh yes, we can find here a couple of touching singing, some masterful solos from the guitar, and, as usual, Neil doing his thing and doing it well. But they lack, as I stated above, the power, the emotion, the \"Rush Spirit\" if I can define it using a quote. Yeah, you can try to sound progressive and atmospheric, but do it without damaging the beat, the feeling. This is what happens in those movements. They loose the line, the string, they fall deep in a pretentious world rather than a joyful and creative new vision of things. Only until \"Soliloquy\", which contains one of the most endearing singing by Geddy Lee and a couple of the most inventive lines ever written by our favourite power trio: \"My spirits are low in the depths of despair... My lifeblood spills over...\" we encounter the Rush we know and like. The \"Grand Finale\" has a frantic drumming section which rules your mind, with the the guitar helping it, and that is. \"2112\" is a rollercoaster of greatness and mellowness, an in-between, unfortunately.\n\nAfter this, well, something great must have been done to save the album, but the band fails to deliver. We found \"A Passage to Bangkok\", a song with a nice melodic intro, but once again, remains there, as an attempt. It never gets to the point, even if Lifeson does his best for trying to awake it. \"Twilight Zone\" it's like an hybrid between early Pink Floyd and late Led Zeppelin. And, yes, as an hybrid, works, but not as a song written by Rush, a band that gained his reputation for being original and progressive, not by trying to copy what others have done before. Almost the same happens with \"Lessons\", with that nice accoustic guitar sound leading the paice, actually sounds like an excerpt of \"2112\" (the song). It's radio friendly, enjoyable, with a rocking chorus and somehow touching lyrics, but nothing to amaze, nothing to remember. You can consider it a child-of-it's-time, a 70's song and no more. \"Something for Nothing\" is the only song that excells. Heavy, speed-paced, with roaring singing by Geddy Lee and a couple of riffs from hell, joint with a masterful drumming, is a return to the Rush Spirit, to that thing we like and enjoy. Unfortunately, it's not enough to save the album.\n\nBut what's awful here is that crappy piece known as \"Tears\" which should have had enough power to ban Rush from the metal archives. Deep Purple also had a dreadful piece in his underrated \"Fireball\" named Anyone's Daughter, but this is completely balanced with the rest of the album. Here this doesn't happens, unfortunately. It's a totally unnecesary ballad with little to save. Maybe Geddy was trying to show how versatile his voice might be, but my friend, this was not the way. I have nothing against ballads, but this one has no ground for break. It's mediocre, usual and without touch. Even worst, when I heard it for the first time, I thought \"this is a song by Air Supply\", but no, I was wrong. It was from Rush and that's a disgrace for their glorious career. I won't talk anymore about that.\n\nSo, if you have, in a song that has more than twenty minutes only 6 or 7 excellent ones and the rest are rolling around being good and mediocre ones, and then your album is almost completely made by fillers, well, I shall rate this with a 73%, because it is a good thing, overall, pretentious, overrated and freaky yes, but good enough. Now, after listening to that song \"Tears\", well, I must degrade around 10 points to my final note. Yes, it hurts, but hurted me the most standing to that piece. So, sorry, Rush, I like you, I really do, but... Whatever...\n",
        "\nOn certain occasions in their discography, the holy triumvirate that is Rush seems to get the itch to do their own spin on what is popular at the time. Grace Under Pressure pretty much copied the style of The Police and in doing so created one of their greatest (and most underrated) albums ever. Power Windows and Hold Your Fire were very much in-line with the synthpop style of the mid/late 80's, and both are also quality releases that are still uniquely Rush. Counterparts is basically the trio saying \"Alternative? Grunge? You call this hard? Gimme a break! Stand back and watch how it's done!\"\n\nRight from the opening few songs, it's apparent the clean-cut, synth-fueled Rush of the 80's is long gone, replaced by Alex Lifeson once again at the firefront, delivering his signature style of paradoxically easygoing yet fast and complex riffs and solos, propped up by Geddy Lee's god-tier bass lines and beatmaster Neil Peart keeping everything chugging along as only he can do it. A few synth sounds still exist within, but they're relegated to support/accentuating roles now, and the difference is huge. While not produced much louder than their previous works, the music on this just feels so much more massive in tone than their 80's offerings. with the opening trio of Animate, Stick it Out, and Cut to the Chase being the best, and hardest hitting. But even with all this raw rock power, they still find the room for cultural commentary. Whether it be compassion towards gays on Nobody's Hero or contemplating gender/race differences on Alien Shore, Rush always seems to be able to deliver heartfelt messages without having to sound soapbox preachy.\n\nThis album formed at just the right time, melding Rush's impeccable lyrical work and musicianship with the hard-nosed, cathartic yet disaffected alt/grunge wave of the time, serving as an appropriate spiritual prototype for bands like Incubus, Foo Fighters, and Porcupine Tree; hard-working modern rock bands that are nebulously genre'd; anything from progressive, alt-rock, punk, even the hybrid genre alternative metal. While said genre and bands aren't officially recognized by Metal-Archives, it's still an important outlier genre to pay attention to, and Counterparts is its most complete template.\n",
        "\nAs had become traditional for Rush by this point, after four studio albums they brought out this live piece to summarise this particular era of their career ranging from Signals to Hold Your Fire. Of course, the problematic aspect here is that half the albums in that range are rather lacklustre efforts on their part, but I still had reason to hold out hope - after all, if the live versions of the tracks showed a bit more flair and style then perhaps the album could be a better way to experience that material.\n\nAlas, in common with too many other live albums from the era A Show of Hands is simply an exercise in wheeling out performances indistinguishable from the studio renditions of the songs in question bar from the ever-present roar of the crowd (which, to be honest, is mixed far too high for my liking). As other reviewers have pointed out, a lot of this is due to the constraints of the synth-heavy period of their sound - with only three musicians onstage, the synth parts had to be largely preprogammed, more or less killing any scope they had to introduce any variation into the songs.\n\nStill, though I understand why the album sounds this lifeless, that still doesn't excuse said lifelessness; as it is, whilst the musical direction the band took in this period sometimes yielded incredible results in the studio (as on my favourite of their synth-heavy albums, Grace Under Pressure), it clearly horribly compromised their live show. Perhaps hiring a guest musician or two to provide backup on the synths might have made for a more organic experience, but then again the trio's chemistry has always been so tight that incorporating more musicians into it would be a dangerous proposition indeed.\n\nAlternately, if the album had included more 80s performances of less synth-dominated parts of their back catalogue it might have gone better - it closes with a reasonable rendition of Closer to the Heart, and the difference between that track the program-locked material before it is striking. But then again, All the World's a Stage and Exit Stage Left had already covered all the best songs from prior eras, and there seems to have been an effort made to avoid duplicating songs presented on those two.\n\nIn short, by this stage of their career Rush had written themselves into a corner with their live albums, in that everyone was expecting this release to focus on the tracks from Signals to Grace but the fact was that the songs in question just didn't lend themselves well to live performances. If you already own the studio albums these tracks came from, then you already have more interesting and lively renditions than the tracks in question than the rote runthroughs on offer here.\n",
        "\nAn excellent refinement and polishing of the approach taken on Permanent Waves, Moving Pictures is a strong candidate for the best album Rush ever made. Rush had begun to incorporate an increasing amount of synthesisers into their music on the preceding album, and this tendency continues this time around. The sole extended track on the album, the ten minute The Camera Eye, makes good use of this by having Geddy Lee primarily play synthesisers for the first part of the song, which is about the ambience of New York, and then switch to bass for the second half, which concerns the ambience of London; just as the modernity of New York and the history of London are contrasted in the song, so too are the future direction of Rush and their recent musical history brilliantly contrasted in the piece.\n\nIn terms of structure, the first side consists of catchy and accessible numbers which showcase the band's hard rock and metal chops whilst continuing their project of condensing progressive rock song structures into short, bite-sized chunks. This is perfectly captured on what I consider to be their best song, the haunting Red Barchetta, whose movements capture nostalgia, exhilaration, action, and escapism in an emotional trip that perfectly parallels the narrative of the song; the opening chords of the piece never fail to make hairs rise on the back of my neck. The side also includes YYZ, an instrumental in the tradition of the excellent La Villa Strangiato - the best track from Hemispheres by a long way - which again condenses the sorts of twists and turns and technical musicianship found into the earlier piece into a shorter and very accessible format.\n\nThe second side of the song is devoted to more experimental and murkier material, and has taken a while to grow on me - but grow on me it has. As well as the aforementioned The Camera Eye, it includes the spooky Witch Hunt - a rare Rush excursion into horror - and Vital Signs, in which Rush's increasing New Wave influences are manifested in a very Police-like incorporation of reggae rhythms into the song (though I have to say I think Rush succeed rather better than the Police did).\n\nOn the whole, this is an album where Rush hit a perfect balance between progging out and rocking out, in which experimentation and accessibility and cool synthesiser pieces and heavy guitar solos all work in perfect harmony. In other words, it attains the balance which Hemispheres spoke of but didn't actually attain itself, and in that sense it can be seen as the culmination all the work Rush had done up to that point. The band would take a radical new direction with their next album, but their early progressive metal period ended on the best possible note.\n",
        "\nHaving mastered the accepted conventions of prog rock on Farewell to Kings and the title track of 2112, and having taken them to excess on Hemispheres, Rush then set about changing the rules to suit their ever-evolving sound. Not a single song on Permanent Waves has a running time of less than ten minutes, but whilst Rush's revised sound is delivered in radio-friendly portions, the content of the songs themselves is as innovative and technically complex as ever.\n\nMusically speaking, this album sees the band sitting on the cusp between metal and hard rock, with hard rock winning out on most tracks but metal still creeping in here and there, usually when Alex Lifeson decides to get a little wild with his guitar (as on Jacob's Ladder). Neil Peart's drumming is, of course, whilst Geddy Lee breaks out some really excellent bass solos. Thematically, the band steer away from fantasy and allegory in favour of a more direct lyrical message - Freewill, for instance, is a song which proves that you don't have to be angry, accusatory, or downbeat to endorse atheism, whilst opening number The Spirit of Radio is a simple song about the love of music.\n\nBut the real genius of the album is how all these ingredients, plus Rush's love of complex time signatures and so forth, is broiught together in perfectly formed little songs that are as catchy as hell, without sacrificing any of the complexity. Many other prog rock bands were trying to make their style more accessible at this time, but this was usually at the price of damping down the whole \"prog\" aspect of their music and leaning more towards a poppy, mainstream style. Rush were one of the few who accomplished a broadening of their appeal without compromising their musical vision, and Permanent Waves is the album they accomplished this on.\n",
        "\nThe followup to Farewell to Kings takes the approach of that album, cranks it up to eleven, and also sees Rush experimenting with an increased presence of synthesisers and keyboards in their work. Whilst these experiments would yield the sound of albums like Permanent Waves and Moving Pictures - foreshadowings of which can be heard here and there on this album - Hemispheres itself is a rather muddled beast.\n\nSide one is dominated by the title track, the sequel to Cygnus X-1 on the previous album - although both thematically and musically, it couldn't be more different. Cygnus X-1 is a spacey number about a guy who deliberately steers his spaceship into a black hole out of his burning curiosity to see what was on the other side. It was tight, cohesive, had different sections seamlessly melded together through tight changes of time signature, and it rocked like you wouldn't believe.\n\nHemispheres, conversely, is a bit more of a mess. It's a fantasy story about the conflict between the gods of reason and emotion and how eventually they install a mortal to adjudicate the balance between them. So far, so prog. The problem is that it's yet another Rush epic that, like the bad old days of Caress of Steel, just doesn't have sufficient ideas to fill its running time. What's more, the different sections feel hastily pasted together, almost as though they are separate songs that happen to run together. The same was true to an extent of 2112 of course, but 2112 both rocked harder and kept the listerner's interest far more than Hemispheres, and didn't repeat itself nearly so often.\n\nOn the second side we have two throwaway tracks - Circumstances, which sounds like a reject from side two of 2112, and the heavy-handed political allegory of The Trees. But at least we also have the album's saving grace - La Villa Strangiato, a 9 minute instrumental track which both acts as the culmination of their prog-above-all period and as the transition to the next phase of their career. Ducking and weaving at a breakneck pace through a range of different moods, juggling time signatures without breaking a sweat with each band member soloing like their lives depend on it, it's everything that the title track should have been but wasn't.\n\nStill, one really awesome track isn't enough to save an album that is otherwise rather inessential. Harsh, maybe, but there's no getting away from the fact that this is a very transitional album which would have got a significantly lower rating were it not for the wonders of La Villa.\n",
        "\nHaving saved their careers with 2112, and noting the appreciative reaction to that album's ambitious prog epic on side 1, Rush increased the prog rock influence on their formula on this album. In terms of lyrics and themes, this is almost like Caress of Steel Take Two - it's still rooted in sci-fi and fantasy with objectivist ideology poking its head up here and there (though not so obnoxiously that you can't look past it if you're not a Rand fan).\n\nThe big difference is in the compositions; not only had Rush clearly advanced as musicians by this point (Geddy Lee's bass work in Madrigal and Cygnus X-1, in particular, is pretty damn amazing), but their songwriting had also matured. On preceding albums, songs were either comparatively short or of absolutely epic length, with comparatively few in-between; this time around, they show much more willingness to compose songs of moderate length, and only stretch out to the ten minute and beyond mark if they really have enough ideas to fill that much time.\n\nWith an infectious amount of energy and enthusiasm for the songs here - Rush know that they are playing unabashedly geeky material here, and they are absolutely cool with that - Rush deliver a performance which takes their music to the next level. With strident declarations of intent, acoustic romanticism, and foreboding black hole rhythms all in the mix, this is also one of the most varied Rush albums of their early career. The first Rush disc which is a flat-out great album from beginning to end, Farewell to Kings is a must for anyone interested in fusions of metal and progressive rock.\n",
        "\nCobbled together in a hurry to cash in on the success of 2112, All The World's a Stage is an adequate but not exceptional summary of the early period of Rush. The recording quality is just about acceptable but not stellar, hinting at the band's live power without quite adequately capturing it. The songs from the first three albums are by and large improved by the raw live performance and the band's increased technical chops - in particular, the selections from the debut album now only sound influenced by Led Zeppelin, as opposed to being slavish imitations of superior Zep songs.\n\nHowever, the songs from 2112 suffer from the production quality, and from the fact that 2112 itself is trimmed by about five minutes or so, a decision which will enrage purists. (Particularly since one of the sections trimmed - \"Oracle: The Dream\" - is the part which most points the way to the style the band would adopt on Farewell to Kings.) Still, the album is an authentic-sounding snapshot of the Rush live experience at the time, with between-song chat preserved - as well as several minutes of post-concert chatter tacked on at the end of the last track, which feels rather needless.\n\nOn balance, I'd say this album was recorded slightly too early in their career - it relies a bit too much on material from the first three albums to fill out its running time, and they're just not strong enough to carry it. The Different Stages set has a live disc from a 1978 performance, and having an extra album's worth of quality material to balance out the setlist makes all the difference. This is a live album which was probably welcome at the time, but has surely been superseded now by later live releases.\n",
        "\nBy the time Rush came to record 2112, Caress of Steel had been a commercial and critical flop and the band fully expected it to be their last album. Kicking off with a side-long prog metal epic despite their advice of their label, the band suddenly and unexpectedly turned out to be quite good at this prog thing after all. The title track from this one blows away the false starts of Fly By Night and Caress of Steel with stellar performances from all concerned, tighter compositional structures in which there's always something interesting happening, and a plot which is unashamed of its nerdiness and which is still exciting to hear after a dozen listens. (Oh, come on, tell me you don't get a shiver down your spine when you hear the distorted voice declaring the Elder Race's conquest of the solar system at the end of the song.) So what if the plot might be a thinly-veiled Objectivist allegory (or, more likely, a swipe at the music press for not accepting Rush's musical vision) when it's so good to listen to?\n\nThe second side of the album provides a tight set of shorter songs which proves that the band had also got the knack of producing these as well. As goofy as the thinly-veiled weed worship of A Passage to Bangkok is, it's still one of the catchiest songs they've ever done, with its thunderous guitar solo by Lifeson being a particular highlight of the album, Lessons is enjoyably upbeat and manages a nice blend of acoustic and electric guitar lines, and Something for Nothing is a great barnstormer to close the album.\n\nThe album isn't quite perfect - The Twilight Zone lacks the boundless energy the rest of the songs have, and doesn't quite hit the spooky atmosphere it aims for (though it comes close), and Tears is a lacklustre, melancholic ballad which even the generously applied heaps of Mellotron can't save from being bland middle-of-the-road slop. But even with these roadbumps on the second side, the album is still an enduring classic and the first sign that Rush might be able to stick it out for the long term. Finally mastering the progressive metal style they'd been tinkering with for two albums, the band took their place at the spearhead of the nascent subgenre, and with 2112 they more than earned it.\n",
        "\nRush had abandoned their unbridled Led Zeppelin worship and plunged into uncharted prog metal waters on Fly By Night, so when the first song on Caress of Steel - Bastille Day - is yet another Zep tribute, it bodes ill for the rest of the album. Sure enough, Caress of Steel represents an awkward compromise between commercial rockin' out and progressive metal excess. Both aspects of the album are critically flawed;; the band don't really seem interested in the shorter songs, whilst the prog epics suffer from Rush's compositional chops not quite keeping pace with their ambition.\n\nOf the shorter songs, Bastille Day is the Zep imitator as mentioned, I Think I'm Going Bald is an equally unoriginal and uninspired riff on Goin' Blind by Kiss, and Lakeside Park is entirely forgettable. As for the prog pieces, the Necromancer pads out its running time with an overlong narration at the beginning, takes too long to build up steam, and isn't that impressive what it does. The Fountain of Lamneth, similarly, pads out its runtime with far too much filler and compares poorly to the sidelong epic on the next album, 2112, which it occasionally sounds like working sketches for.\n\nUltimately, Caress of Steel is what's called a \"transitional\" album, that being music reviewer code for an album which tries to go for two different sounds at once and fails to accomplish either of them. Probably worth a listen if you're a major Rush fan, but don't expect it to supplant 2112 or its successors in your collection any time soon.\n",
        "\nStanding head and shoulders above the Led Zeppelin worship of the previous album, Fly By Night sees Rush create a first rough draft of their distinctive prog metal style. This is most apparent on the album's highlight, the multi-part epic By-Tor and the Snow Dog, which aside from a slow section towards the end is a great prog metal composition featuring some superb guitar work from Alex Lifeson.\n\nOf course, the transformation in the band's sound is thanks mainly to the presence of Neil Peart, whose more technically proficient drumming allows the band to explore more complex musical territory. But both Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson give a superior performance this time around as well, the presence of Peart clearly boosting the band's morale and both founder members relishing the opportunity to show off their skills outside of a blues-rock framework.\n\nIt isn't a perfect album, though; it occasionally suffers from muzzy production values and a residual tendency towards lightweight rockers (such as the forgettable Best I Can or Making Memories), and the faltering acoustic piece Rivendell is an embarrassing slice of Tolkien worship that's best forgotten about - not least because it stretches about a minute's worth of musical ideas over five minutes. Nonetheless, the album brings the band appreciably closer to becoming the dominant force they would become, so major-league Rush fans will probably want to pick it up regardless.\n",
        "\nRush's sole album with founding drummer John Rutsey is an object lesson in how much a change in lineup of a tight three-man unit like Rush can change the character of a band. More or less everyone with an interest in progressive metal knows Rush as a technically proficient band who are constantly experimenting with different directions to take their sound in, are blessed with one of the scene's most technically proficient drummers in the form of Neil Peart, and feature the instantly recognisable high-pitched vocals of Geddy Lee. Aside from Geddy's vocals, none of these qualities are in evidence on their debut.\n\nSteeped in Led Zeppelin worship, the album showcases a band which clearly have potential but just aren't pushing themselves to realise it. The point of interest for most Rush fans will be how Rutsey compares to Peart. The answer: not well. It's impossible to tell whether he was simply a less talented drummer who was holding the band back due to his inability to play more technically complex material, or whether the band as a whole were simply not making use of their talent at this point in time, but the overall effect is the same: Rutsey snoozes through all the usual hard rock cliches (complete with cowbell) and does nothing particularly spectacular.\n\nAlex Lifeson turns in the most distinguished instrumental performance here - particularly his solos on the extended numbers Here Again and Working Man - but again he's simply running through the hard rock playbook rather than making any new contribution on here. As for the vocals, whilst Geddy's distinctive voice is in place it is jarring to hear him try an unconvincing impersonation of Robert Plant, and he's hampered by the lack of the witty and articulate lyrics Rush are usually known for (except on Working Man). Again, this is probably a consequence of the different lineup, since Neil Peart would take on primary lyrical responsibility once he joined the band.\n\nOverall, the album's a bit of a disappointment, and the only genuinely memorable song on here is Working Man - which has been given superior live renditions by the current lineup, particularly on All The World's a Stage and Different Stages. Quite simply, unless you are burning with curiosity over Rush's origins, there's no compelling reason to own this album.\n",
        "\nPermanent Waves is one of the most accessible and commercial records that Rush ever made and I don't mean that in a negative way. The brilliant opening double pack \"The Spirit Of Radio\" and \"Freewill\" are catchy and easy to listen to but contain still enough original guitar riffs, rhythm changes and progressive harmonies to satisfy the fans of the last outputs and not only a new target. Those two songs had everything to become two amazing hit singles and are from that point of view probably the two strongest short tracks Rush have ever written in its long and bold career.\n\nThe band still proves that they have kept the spirit of their calm and progressive moments with the strong \"Jacob's Ladder\". Even if one considers the high quality of many epic tracks from the previous records, this song is still a very special gem and has an outstanding atmosphere that makes it stand out and can be considered as a fan favourite on this record. It's a song that grows one you and needs some attention to dig deeper and deeper into its subtle magic.\n\nJust when the band seems to head for a really great album and a top notch rating, something unpredictable happens. There really is a split between the first and the second half of the record. Seen from a purely technical point of view, the following songs are surely well executed and at least interesting to listen to but they sound somewhat cold, intellectual and too technical to me. They simply don't have the magic and warmth of the first three tracks and rate this album way more down than I initially expected.\n\nThat's why I feel a little bit weird about this record in the end. It has its great moments and starts very strong but loses my interest towards the end. I would still not consider it as a bad album but one of the good average records in the discography of Rush. It's definitely not the highlight that it could have been in my opinion but it's without the glimpse of a doubt a great record to kick off a wonderful decade of amazing music.\n",
        "\n\"A farewell to kings\" is another visionary progressive rock record by the Canadian legends \"Rush\". It unites rather catchy and commercial songs like \"Closer to the heart\" with epic conceptual science-fiction pieces like the brilliant \"Cygnus X-1\". Any fan of progressive music can hear that this record largely influenced bands such as \"Ayreon\" and \"Dream Theater\" many years ago and it is interesting to discover the roots and influences of those outstanding bands. Personally, I adore the diversity and visionary works of Rush and prefer them to \"Genesis\" that got to commercial and \"Pink Floyd\" that were not always able to get their inspirations to the point. \"Rush\" are neither very commercial nor handicapped by heavy drug abuse so that they are free to do what they want. That's what this album is all about: diversity and freedom. In the progressive rock world, there are only \"King Crimson\" and \"Tangerine Dream\" that I like as much or more than Rush.\n\nNevertheless, there are a couple of flaws on this particular record. First of all, the band starts with the most incoherent and weirdest song \"A farewell to kings\" that really takes some time to grow. It's not the best choice as an opener and title track and probably the uneasiest song on the record. I can't get a healthy approach to it as there is a lack of addicting elements in this experimental song that goes a little bit nowhere. Second, this record is technically well crafted and even perfect but I miss some emotions and some human warmth in the songs. That's a flaw that many progressive rock bands have but some exceptions prove that this is possible and that's what divides the small path between an excellent and a very good band. The third negative point is the vocals, probably the only truly weak point in this band, Rush\u2019s Achilles\u2019 tendon if you want to call it like that. Geddy Lee screams and yells like an angry woman from time to time and especially the more complex epics are too much interrupted by his surely unique but pretty much annoying voice. Most people might pardon those flaws and I agree that they don't really do any harm as I appreciate discovering this record over and over again but those points are the reasons why this isn't the band's best work and why some people might have some difficulties to get into this.\n\nThe instrumental parts are the true highlight on this record and I mostly appreciate the longer tracks that have less lyrics and concentrate on a conceptual atmosphere like \"Xanadu\" and especially the outstanding \"Cygnus X-1\" that surprises with its dystopian and mysterious moods and offers many changes of style, rhythm and melody and is one of the best progressive rock tracks in history.\n\nIn the end, this early masterpiece of the band is amongst their best albums but not yet in the top notch because of a few little flaws. The longest and most important tracks are all great and add something new and unique to the genre while the shorter tracks are less impressive. From an intellectual and technical point of view this record is close to perfection but concerning the emotional and coherent point of view, there are a couple of aspects that could be further worked out.\n",
        "\nHere it is, folks. The first ever \"progressive metal\" record, and consequently, one of the greatest. Listening to this album is like being granted a free passport to boob land, finding a 100 dollar bill in the parking lot of your local Wendy's, smoking crack cocaine, fucking Jocelin Donahue (star of \"House of the Devil\", if you were wondering), and listening to Pestilence's \"Testimony of the Ancients\" all in the same night. Yeah, and it's still not their best album!\n\nIf you've ever listened to Rush's first two albums (1974's \"Rush\" and 1975's \"Fly By Night\"), then you'll probably be aware of how they were oozing with a strong, happy, confident spirit still unmatched in the progressive rock genre (the band 3 came very close with \"The End is Begun\" in 2007, but still, close but no cigar). Well, \"Caress of Steel\", also released in '75, features this spirit as well, but featuring elements which perfectly foreshadow what was to come with the band's legandary opus, \"2112\" (released in 1976). The music could best be described as a fusion of speed metal and prog rock, with influence from punk, jazz, ambient, blues, and who knows what else shining through. \n\nThe opening three numbers serve as the first \"half\" of the album, all being more upbeat, happier tracks in the vein of the previous albums, and all three are absolutly stunningly awesome. Alex Lifeson's riffs and solos are generally the focus of these tracks, and because of this, some of his greatest ideas are to be heard (the solo 1:35 into \"Lakeside Park\", for instance is extremly memorable and adds alot to the overall atmosphere of the track). This is not to say, though, that Geddy Lee and Neil Peart don't shine. Geddy's vocals are amazing as always, while his bass playing is more technical than in the past. Neil Peart, as one of the best drummers out there, will obviously shine in any instance, but I'll refrain from really talking about him very much until I cover his well, his thing...Anyway, the aforementioned \"spirit\" plays a bigger part during this part, with \"I Think I'm Going Bald\" appearing (on the outside, at least ;D) like a perfect fit for their debut, with some chunkier, heavier riffs showing through, though there is a stronger progressive influence at play than before. As well, let's not forget the speed metal number found in \"Bastille Day\", which remains to this day one of (but not the) greatest tracks on the album. This is often considered one of the band's signature songs, and there's no question why. It's the perfect opener for the album, featuring a fuckload of energy and some of Geddy Lee's best basslines (seriously, that chorus has some killer bass)! \n\nThe second half consists of two epic tracks, \"The Necromancer\" and \"The Fountain of Lamneth\". This is where the whole band really begins to shine, with each member working together to create some of the best music imaginable. \"The Necromancer\" is certainly darker and more ominous than anything the band had created up to this point, and it really shows how strongly the band has matured. Neil and Geddy provide the rhythm much more often here, while Alex Lifeson shreds away some of the best solos of his career (that I'm aware of). I mean, just listen to that solo about 10:28 in...holy fuck, that's how it's done folks. That's all I have to say about that.\n\nNow we're onto the greatest song on the album, and likely one of Rush's best tracks, \"The Fountain of Lamneth\", which lasts 19:58. Were Rush normal human beings, this song would normally be the result of a band creating a time machine and going into the future, stealing the best ideas they would ever make, then coming back and recording what they find. But we all know that this is not the case, so the most I can say is that it's truly magnificent. The emphasis on contributions from all members is emphasised even moreso here than on \"The Necromancer\", with Alex Lifeson delivering some truly magnificent riffs (i.e. 13:42), Geddy Lee supplying the killer basslines and some amazing vocals, and Neil Peart being, well, Neil Peart, and giving us one of the most insane drum solos he's ever done about four minutes in (and considering how good of a drummer he is, that's saying alot!!). I don't want to ruin anything for you, but please realize that while the length may seem a bit excessive, every second is essential and just as important as the last (even the little bits of silence between the parts add alot of suspense for someone like me). If you're a fan of \"Rivendell\" from \"Fly By Night\", you'll find there's a little treat waiting for you about halfway through. \n\nWell, I probably shouldn't go any deeper into how great this album truly is, I'll leave that to you. I'd suggest this to fans of Rush in general, especially people who dig the first two albums the most! Buy it today or miss out on some of the best progressive metal ever released.\n",
        "\nUpon purchasing this album, I didn't really know what to expect. I had already heard much of Rush's 80's material, from Permanent Waves to Hold Your Fire. I was starting to get into prog at this time, hearing much of Dream Theater and Pink Floyd (some consider them prog, including myself). So I purchased this, eager to hear what Rush could bring in terms of Progressive Rock/metal. Boy did I make a make smart decision. \n\nHemispheres is simply incredible. We start off with my favorite song that I've ever heard, lyrically that is: Cygnus X-1 - Book II. We have a man who has been sucked into a black hole and emerges into Mount Olympus (with his body destroyed) and witnessess a fight between Greek god's Apollo (god of sun, wisdom and light) and Dionysus (god of wine and theater) and their fight to control the people involved to side with what they represent. Apollo promises to shelter the people and show them how to build cities, while Dionysus asks the people to embrace nature and indulge in your emotions. This causes the two Olympians to fight, splitting the \"single, perfect sphere\" into the double hemispheres. Our protagonist sees this and lets out a scream which causes everything to stop, and bring the hemispheres back together. He is then crowned Cygnus, the god of balance. This song surpassed Under a Glass Moon (Dream Theater), as my favorite song lyrically, and i thought that could never be done.\n\nMusiclly, the song is amazing also. At 18 minutes, it's truly a wonderful, sprawling epic. It has multiple time signature changes, three decent solos, and Geddy Lee gives one of the greatest vocal performances of his career. Music-wise, I think 2112 (the song) is a better epic, but lyrically this song is superior. It doesn't dissapoint.\n\nWe now come to Circumstances, which seems to be about a man who wishes he could change his situation to how he would want it, stating \"The more things change, the more they stay the same\". It does have a short instrumental section, but i was hoping for a solo or two. Oh well, still a great, catchy track.\n\nAfter that is The Trees, which is apparently about two types of trees bickering at each other, with maple trees wanting more sunlight while the oak trees are hogging too much of it. Interesting concept, and they made it work into a damn good song, along with a slow section which later speeds up to finish strong.\n\nWe now end with a 9 minute astonishing (it is Rush after all) instrumental called La Villa Strangiato. This is really great, easily comparable with another monumental instrumental called YYZ. Features some of my favorite fretwork I've heard on guitar, and heavy emphasis on bass. It also arguably the best extended solo the band has to offer during it's slower section. I was hooked by upon listening to it. These guys really are virtuosos, bravo boys.\n\nAll in all, this a very strong album. But it's also quite short: there's only 4 songs on it, equaling 36 minutes, wit the first and last song making over half that album. However that's not to say it disappointed me at all or left me wanting for more. I give it 90 points, minus 5 for shortness of two of the songs, and minus 5 for quantity of songs. Other than that, I highly recommend it.\n",
        "\nI\u2019ve wanted to write a review of this album for some time now, but I find it hard to articulate how I feel about it. Anyway, I\u2019ll try to do it justice.\n\nThis is the first album I really got into by Rush. I\u2019ve liked the band for quite a while, but it was always various songs, and their more recent live albums that I listened to. I never gave Power Windows much of a chance, partially due to the rating score on metal-archives; I chose to check out albums that had been rated high. Eventually I got around to hearing Mystic Rhythms, and from there it began. I have become infatuated with this album and it is by far my favourite album. There aren\u2019t really any other Rush albums that I listen to the whole way through; Grace Under Pressure and Hold Your Fire sometimes\u2026 (I love their mid 80s period).\n\nA common criticism of the album is the lack of presence from Lifeson. I suppose this stems from the fact that the songs aren\u2019t riff driven, but that is where the true genius of his playing shines through. His playing is so fantastically tasteful, textural, and succinct. He does so much, by at times doing so little: minimilistic brilliance. Personally I believe some of his best soloing is on this album. Take for example the solo on The Big Money; it\u2019s nothing short of orgasmic.\n\nThe calm approach also applies to Peart\u2019s work on the album, so tasteful and perfect. The simple repetitive drumming on Mystic Rhythms creates a hypnotic effect that drives the song and makes it so memorable. They do so much by at times, but not doing too much. The tasteful playing creates expansive songs that breathe.\n\nGeddy, on the other hand, is as brilliant as ever on the bass. His vocals also sound the best out of any work from the 80s as well. There must have been something happening in the band that created such cohesiveness. \n\nAnother criticism levelled by many is the use of keyboards. This isn\u2019t the first album they used keys on, and it wasn\u2019t the last. Whereas previous albums sounded more like progressive rock with keyboards added later, Power Windows uses the keyboards in conjunction with the material. It sounds so much tighter and organic than their other work. The great use of effects by Lifeson on this album also adds to the layers, creating such a smooth sound.\n\nPeart\u2019s lyrics at times can be fairly cheesy, but on this album I find them to be much deeper and profound. The only detraction could be some of the lyrics in Territories. The lyrics deem with a lot of individuality (Grand Designs), evil powers (The Big Money & The Manhattan Project), collective consciousness (Mystic Rhythms), and following your dreams (Middletown Dreams). I could go on at length about the lyrics on this album, but I\u2019ll cite a brief excerpt from Grand Designs: \n\u201cAgainst the run of the mill, \nStatic as it seems, \nWe break the surface tension with our wild kinetic dreams, \nCurves and lines, \nOf grand designs\u2026\u201d \n\nThey get me every time\u2026\n\nThe only aspect that detracts from this album is the lyrics on Territories, and not them all, but particular verses that just make me cringe. The music is still good, but I feel the song would have fit better on Grace Under Pressure. Perhaps it was left over from that writing period. That is the only thing holding this album from a perfect score. Even that being said, the album is close to perfection. I really had to nitpick to find something wrong, and even then the lyrics aren\u2019t that bad. \n\nI hope more people can enjoy this album. It can take time to get into it, due to its unique nature, but it\u2019s worth it. This more than any of their other albums takes time to get into, and I really find it to be the pinnacle of their 80s output, much more than the popular Moving Pictures.\n",
        "\nFor many fans of progressive rock, the genre is the absolute pinnacle of sheer musical prowess, at least in the confines of rock music. This is a fact that not many will argue against. Progressive rock pushes the limits of rock to extremes that were not even imaginable before its establishment and bar a few exceptions, still haven\u2019t been achieved in other rock sub-genres. Taking this into account, shouldn\u2019t the greatest creations in progressive rock be the most revolutionary pieces in rock itself? To a large extent, this fact holds. Be it Jethro Tull\u2019s Aqualung with its rustic, folk feel or ELP\u2019s Tarkus which is every keyboard player\u2019s \u2018dream-come-true\u2019 album or even Pink Floyd\u2019s The Wall, the big daddy of all concept albums; progressive rock beasts tend to go down as genre shaking pieces of music. In this regard, Moving Pictures is the odd one out from the pack. There is no denying its influence on future progressive rock and metal groups but revolutionary it was not. In fact, it isn\u2019t even the most progressive in Rush\u2019s discography, yet there aren\u2019t many who argue its greatness. The reason for that is the general creative intelligence of the songs present on it and more importantly, the fact that this album marks the one occasion when Rush got the formula of technical genius and accessibility just right.\n\nThe album preceding it, Permanent Waves, was Rush\u2019s first attempt at simplifying their sound for the masses. The end result was a good album which nonetheless didn\u2019t sound like typical Rush. Now, Rush had never been the most complex songwriters; their music always retained a certain commercial feel which was in part responsible for them being so popular in the first place. But Permanent Waves was a bit simple when seen in context with the albums preceding it and although they pulled it off quite well, I always found that album a bit weak relative to albums like \u2018Hemispheres\u2019 or \u20182112\u2019. The album was more like a heterogeneous mix of \u2018progressiveness\u2019 and commercial simplicity, with large bits of both which the band failed to powder and assimilate properly. Moving Pictures also has a heavy commercial touch to it but this time it has been blended wonderfully with the technicality and \u2018progressiveness\u2019 that made Rush so special in the first place. When you listen to it for the first time it doesn\u2019t challenge you, it\u2019s easy to follow and enjoy. But as you delve deeper and give the album more plays, you realize that things aren\u2019t as straightforward as they seem. What seems like a simple melody at first turns out to be a complex interplay between the bass, guitar and drums with the keyboards thrown in at times. Certain songs will threaten to break into the simple verse-chorus-verse formula and then may proceed to awe you with a what-the-fuck-just-happened styled bass line or a drum breakdown or even a keyboard solo emerging out of nowhere. Imagine it like a painting you\u2019ll see in the Louvre, simple and not extraordinary for the usual visitor but the art connoisseur will see the sensibility hidden in the simplicity. Similarly, this album also unveils itself to you, as it is given more and more plays. Yet, it is quite a simple album to \u2018get into\u2019 even if you don\u2019t like progressive rock.\n\n\nNow, this album is universally considered the perfect Rush album to start with, a fact that I will not try to refute. It captures the basic Rush sound perfectly, although in a much simpler than usual form. So, I think a description of the aforementioned sound will not look out of place for a review of this album. Since, their sophomore album, which saw Neil Peart\u2019s addition to the band, Rush have based their song structures around Peart\u2019s tight drumming. The drumwork featured on Rush albums is some of the best I have heard in prog rock and there aren\u2019t many drummers who can touch the mastery shown by Neil and he does all this without eating up the other instruments\u2019 parts. The bass and guitar both take the lead and seem to go in totally different directions. You\u2019ll rarely find the bass \u2018following\u2019 the guitar and vice-versa, yet all of this stays completely coherent. Lifeson rotates between pulling out clear cut riffs and creating a melodic wall of guitar, each put to ample use depending on the song and moment. The best part about Rush is the fact that none of the three instruments seem to be stealing the other\u2019s thunder. On the longer songs, you can observe bass solos and even drum solos, in addition to the guitar solos which Lifeson is pretty good at conjuring up.\n\nThe above formula has been slightly simplified on this album. Well the first change is the presence of keyboards. Older Rush albums didn\u2019t feature a lot of keyboard work other than the odd addition now and then, which was also done merely to enhance the mood of the song. On this album, the keyboards play an important as seen on the Rush classic Tom Sawyer. Neil Peart\u2019s drumming here is still incredibly tight. The word virtuoso will not be a wrong description for his skills as a drummer. The most important thing is that he knows how to restrain himself, so his drumming never becomes overbearing. You will not see him miss a beat and the rhythm changes following the time signatures are quite smooth. Not that there are a lot of time signatures on this album but the odd feel that is usually accompanies them is a bit subdued here. Depending on how you perceive your prog rock, it can either be great or disappointing for you. Of course, you can belong to the third category like me who enjoys both in equal degree. The guitar retains the rich, melodic feel unique to Rush and there are some great guitar solos here. That typical wall of guitar sound is still there but with the addition of more riff based parts. Unlike older Rush albums, there is no use of the acoustic guitar in any of the songs (if there is, then at least it is not obvious to untrained ears like mine).\n\nThe importance of bass as the lead instrument has been greatly curtailed on this album. No bass solos or bass only intros for you; I think this can be attributed to the fact that Lee takes on the keyboard duties as well. The keyboard parts eat up the few moments which would have instead seen the bass taking the leads from the guitars but that isn\u2019t really a huge problem because the keyboard work is great and not excessively technical unlike what you\u2019ll expect in an ELP or DT song. The vocal style unique to Lee is a yet another factor that sets Rush apart from other bands, progressive or otherwise. His voice has an incredibly warm feel to it, which is amplified by fact that he is a bit nasal. Lee\u2019s range is quite wide, although he sometimes grates a bit when suddenly shifting from the lower to the higher notes. Now, the vocals are one Rush aspect which is an acquired taste, a lot of my friends don\u2019t seem to warm up to Geddy\u2019s vocals. Although considering the fact this review is most probably being read by a metalhead, the odd vocals should not be a problem. A lot of metal singers have really weird vocals, compared to them; Geddy is as accessible as a pop singer. His approach here is considerably softer than the one on 'Hemispheres' or 'A Farewell to the Kings' with no screaming parts to be heard. I personally consider this album to be his best work on the microphone.\n\n\nMoving Pictures speak a million words. This title for the review has not been given without thought. Eyes are considered the most vital of the 5 senses. A lot of times, you have to see a thing to truly appreciate or hate it. More explanatory than words, a mere picture can convey what a thousand words can\u2019t. In this regard, the sense of sound is not far behind. Good music has the ability to please not only the ears but the eye as well. Maybe it\u2019s the mind\u2019s eye that I am talking about but a lot of songs have the ability to invoke images in our minds that not even our actual eyes can perceive. Be it dark ambient that can create both an oppressive atmosphere as well as a calm surrounding around you or power metal that can make even a silent introvert feel like a broad sword wielding medieval warrior, music has the ability to stimulate the senses like no other medium. This album takes that idea and builds on it. Every tiny detail has a meaning, the keyboard intro to Tom Sawyer, the chorus to Limelight and the sound of shattering glass in YYZ all fill in the general scheme and unless you are musically impaired this album will make you see things. Remember that if a mere picture can speak a thousand words than Moving Pictures can SCREAM a million.\n\nThe song Tom Sawyer features a futuristic keyboard intro and has an overall cold feel that builds the images of today\u2019s world gone astray, a world where man is mean and thinks only of himself. The song is quite possibly the most popular Rush song and is one of my personal favorites as well. Red Barchetta, the second longest song on the album has a very simple structure for a prog rock song of its length and is one of the inferior tracks of the album but fortunately, it still gets the job done. YYZ is a super technical instrumental that strives to destroy any other instrumentals known to metalheadkind. The calm intro lulls the listener and once you drop your guard, all the instruments jump at you together. The thundering drum work and the heavy riffs on this song make this song a prime candidate for distinction as the first true prog metal song. The song is also the most technically as well as structurally complex one on the album, even more so than the 10 min epic which appears later. The song Limelight talks about the pains and pleasures of being in the \u2018limelight\u2019. Another one of my favorites, this song has a warm feel to it, which contrasts the cool elusiveness of Tom Sawyer. The Camera Eye is the last one of the Rush epics as the band did not put such long tracks on future albums. The song has some great guitar solos and after the 2 min prelude, song has a compact structure. The movements of tracks like 2112 and Xanadu are nowhere to be seen. Witch Hunt paints a grim image of the past, which is colored deeper by Geddy Lee\u2019s vocals. Although I personally consider this song slightly weaker than the rest but it still achieves the purpose of creating a rich atmosphere I mentioned in the previous paragraph, quite well. Vital Signs is a surprisingly catchy song and ends the album on a high note. It also features the best bass lines of the album; the keyboard couldn\u2019t eat up all of them.\n\nA lot of bands falter and some fall face first when they try to change their sound. Some do it efficiently but kill themselves later (Enter essential Metallica comparison here). Rush are not like that, as I said before this album portrays a band undergoing change. The song Red Barchetta is 6 min long yet has a simple structure, even more so than Tom Sawyer. Vital Signs is another song which belongs more to the hard rock genre than prog rock. This still shouldn\u2019t be much of a surprise because the aforementioned changes weren\u2019t abrupt; Rush had made it clear with Permanent Waves that they are simplifying their sound and this album is the logical continuation of the idea. Keep this in mind that for all its simplicity the album is still a prog rock album and a very good one at that. YYZ alone bangs this fact home for those who think otherwise. I deducted a bit from the overall score because the track Witch Hunt didn\u2019t appeal to me as much as the other reviewers. Maybe, I just don\u2019t like the grim side of Rush. Also, Red Barchetta was a bit underwhelming. If you are a newbie to both prog rock and Rush, this album is the perfect starting point for you. If you are an old timer refusing to give this a chance, well stop being a brickhead and buy this as soon as you can. If you are just a metalhead who stumbled on this page by mistake, then you have made a great mistake. Moving Pictures is without much doubt the best heavy prog album I have heard and is recommended to anyone who just likes music, even if he has no interest in even trying prog rock.\n\nHighlights : Tom Sawyer, YYZ, Limelight, Vital Signs\n",
        "\nHemispheres is one of those albums that embodies everything great about its constituent genre. With the exception of a couple of other notable bands, Rush stood at the top of the progressive rock obelisk, a result of the remarkable efforts of this and their previous albums sans Caress of Steel. It was here that Rush finally found the perfect balance between multilayered epics and concise but equally majestic compositions.\n\nThe titular opening track stands as the indisputable champion of Rush\u2019s career \u2013 and yes, that does include \u201c2112.\u201d It\u2019s unlikely that there will ever be a more engrossing depiction of Greek mythology in the realm of music \u2013 their pinning the gods of love and reason against each other was a stroke of genius. As Dionysus and Apollo fight over the fate of mortals, the world plunges into chaos and war from a lack of balance between emotion and intellect. In the midst of Armageddon, a group of neutral men travel into the black hole of Cygnus X-1, where the spirit within calms the hearts and minds of humanity and brings peace, thereby reuniting the \u201csplintered hemispheres.\u201d Rush\u2019s ingenious implementation of program music draws the listener into the story. For instance, both Apollo\u2019s and Dionysus\u2019s sections use the same principal riff, thus evoking a feeling of mental war. Meanwhile, the final section employs acoustic guitars and mellow vocals to signify the calm after the chaos (which was represented through aggressive electric guitars and Lee\u2019s louder, more involved singing). Every different section sparks a distinct reaction in the listener, such as the opening sense of foreboding. When the story becomes violent, so does the resulting feeling. Likewise, when things calm down, the listener feels at peace. While \u201c2112\u201d only flirted with the idea of program music, \u201cHemispheres\u201d uses it to its full advantage.\n\nThe other piece to implement differing sections is the twelve-part \u201cLa Villa Strangiato.\u201d It opens up with neoclassical minor-key acoustic guitar almost mistakable for Yngwie Malmsteen, before the trademark \u201cRush-isms\u201d come in \u2013 that is, esoteric instruments and melodies \u2013 and the song crescendos into its main passage, a swift, invigorating guitar line. This section doesn\u2019t outlast its welcome, as the song soon slides into a slower, atmospheric solo part. As the song continues, many distinct movements take place, the best of which is the rough and spooky \u201cMonsters\u201d piece and its subsequent bass soloing about two-thirds of the way through the track. Each part is short in length, but fleshed-out enough to prevent unfulfilled expectancy. \u201cLa Villa Strangiato\u201d ends with a reprise of the \u201cMonsters\u201d section and the theme, before abruptly ending on a strange bass solo and a final, unexpectedly pitched guitar note.\n\nBut lengthy, progressive symphonies aren\u2019t all Hemispheres is about. The two other tracks don\u2019t even reach five minutes, which is not to say they lack effectiveness. \u201cCircumstances\u201d tends to employ shorter riffs backed by speedy basslines instead of the unusual ones the long tracks did. There\u2019s also an actual chorus in this song, one that is used sparingly enough that the listener hopefully anticipates its appearance. The lyrics to the chorus include an entertainingly involving French section:\n\n\u201cPlus \u00e7a change, plus c\u2019est la m\u00eame chose\nThe more that things change, the more they stay the same. \u201c\n\nMeanwhile, \u201cThe Trees\u201d describes a particularly odd situation: argument between oak and maple trees. Apparently the maples are angry because they can\u2019t reach the sun\u2019s warmth, and decide to keep all trees equal \u201cby hatchet, axe, and saw.\u201d Unfortunately, the delivery of these lyrics as well as the overall instrumentation leaves a bit to be desired, and so \u201cThe Trees\u201d is the only disappointing song on Hemispheres. However, it is still pretty good, and so this is a minor inconvenience in the grand scheme of things.\n\nOverall, Rush\u2019s sixth album is a landmark in its genre as well as the band\u2019s discography. It combines long and short songs without the bloated mishaps of Caress of Steel or the imperfect brief parts of 2112. Those into progressive rock or any similar style of music will be doing themselves a major favor by looking into this seminal 1978 offering.\n",
        "\nOriginally released in the spring of 1974, Rush\u2019s debut album provides a solid start that is unlike the various personas that the band would take on in the future. Instead of being faced with extensively layered keyboards and intellectual lyrical themes, we are treated to a harder style based on the likes of Led Zeppelin and Cream with lyrics based on more typical rock topics of the time. The album is also noteworthy for being the only one to feature the late drummer John Rutsey, who was unable to extensively tour with the band due to health problems and paved the way for drummer extraordinaire Neil Peart.\n\nAs previously stated, the music often sounds like something that would\u2019ve been recorded by Led Zeppelin in the time period that their first two albums were released. Bassist/vocalist Geddy Lee often sounds like Robert Plant on helium and even outdoes him with the wails on such tracks as the aggressive \"Finding My Way,\" the guitar riffs have a muddy touch often associated with Jimmy Page (The main riff to \"What You\u2019re Doing\" in particular sounds eerily similar to Zeppelin\u2019s \"Heartbreaker\"), and they included a few blues jam in the forms of \"Here Again\" and \"Before and After.\" Fortunately the songwriting is done in good taste and the similarities are done in tribute rather than plagiarism.\n\nGiven that Peart had nothing to do with the writing of this record, it\u2019s certainly obvious that the lyrics on this album are drastically different than that would appear on later efforts. The themes on the album seem to hit closer to home and include ideas related to \u201clove\u201d and the pursuit thereof (\"Finding My Way,\" \"Need Some Love,\" \"Before and After,\" \"In the Mood\"), friendship (\"Take a Friend\"), music in general (\"Here Again\"), critics (\"What You\u2019re Doing\"), and the blue collar lifestyle (\"Working Man\"). I don\u2019t think they\u2019re as bad as some listeners think they are, but it is a little creepy to hear Lee wail about how he\u2019s \u201cgonna get ya\u201d in that sense. There are just some people that never should write about sex. If it makes you any better, I\u2019m one of those people...\n\nDespite being a little derivative, this may be one of my personal favorite Rush albums and is worth checking for fans of the band and heavier classic rock.\n\nPros:\n1) Accessible songwriting and good variety\n2) The band members are already good at their crafts\n\nCons:\n1) Slightly primitive lyrics\n2) Occasionally derivative of other bands\n\nMy Current Favorites:\n\"Finding My Way,\" \"Here Again,\" \"What You\u2019re Doing,\" \"In the Mood,\" and \"Working Man\"\n",
        "\nIf you thought the 80\u2019s were a tough decade for Rush, the 90\u2019s would prove to be even tougher. Starting strong with Roll the Bones (just as the 80\u2019s started strong), the band carved out a direction that even their most dedicated fans wouldn\u2019t have expected: guitar-driven modern hard rock. Counterparts was the first album to utilize this much heavier, much crappier sound, but would it be the last? Well\u2026\n\nTest for Echo is a continuation of that Counterparts sound; that is, Rush playing hard alternative. Alex Lifeson\u2019s guitar has a heavy crunch to it (\u201cDriven,\u201d \u201cVirtuality,\u201d \u201cDog Years\u201d) and he often experiments with dissonance in a grungy manner that might have been cool had he been playing with Pearl Jam or somebody (\u201cTime and Motion\u201d). He rarely solos, contributing mostly in layering distorted and clean tones for the painfully straightforward songs. More so even than on the albums leading up to it, Test for Echo is exceedingly dull. Peart\u2019s eccentric drumming, Geddy\u2019s fluid bass, Lifeson\u2019s guitarwork: all toned back to the point of acquiescence. Even the synthesizers (now appearing very discretely), seem like afterthoughts. So what the hell are we listening to here?\n\nWell I suppose the point here was about the songs, about the lyrics, about the meaning behind the music. Connecting with a 90\u2019s rock audience was not achieved through instrumental prowess, but through simplicity, repetition, and identifiable vocals. Now Geddy\u2019s bass is actually still pretty strong at times, but listening to him dictate from atop Peart\u2019s socially-conscious soapbox becomes positively exhausting. I miss the wailing, spirited Lee who could attach meaning and emotion to occasionally cheesy fantasy lyrics; I can do without the soft-spoken, lifeless Lee who barely makes an impression in these TfE songs. And as far as cheese goes, it\u2019s Peart delivering the goods like never before: from spiritual hooey (\u201cTotem\u201d) to social matters (\u201cHalf the World,\u201d \u201cThe Color of Right), to embarrassingly bad metaphor (\u201cDog Years\u201d), he says a lot without saying much at all. I\u2019ll take cheesy sci-fi or Ayn Rand adaptations over preachy bullshit (\u201cResist,\u201d possibly the worst song they\u2019ve ever written) any day. There\u2019s just no feeling in these songs, and the band doesn\u2019t even try to convince you otherwise. Even the instrumental \u201cLimbo\u201d can\u2019t bring much of the classic Rush sound to mind.\n\nA very shallow rock record, it\u2019s the Hold Your Fire of the 90\u2019s. Interesting only in that the basswork is neat (\u201cDriven\u201d verse especially) and there is some nifty tonal architecture (similar to what Tool might do on an off-day) the band occasionally constructs, Test for Echo is one of those albums for the diehard Rush fanatic only.\n",
        "\nAfter the recording of Test for Echo, Rush drummer Neil Peart was struck by tragedy, opting him to take a leave of absence from the band for an indeterminate period of time. In the meantime, bassist Geddy Lee went and recorded a solo album and guitarist Alex Lifeson went and\u2026.well, got older (he may have had a side project in there as well, I can\u2019t remember). But Peart did return, and the band celebrated this by recording a back-to-their-roots rock record, the first album to not utilize synthesizers since the mid-70\u2019s. \n\nBut what is a comeback album without a few misleading claims? Indeed, there are no synthesizers used on Vapor Trails. It\u2019s a very heavy, guitar-driven hard rock record that\u2019s a bit too straightforward to be considered progressive, but it\u2019s not a flash from the past. Just as Rush\u2019s earliest hard rock was appropriate for the era in which it was recorded (the 70\u2019s), Vapor Trails sounds like what it is: a hard rock album released in 2001. So those who were disappointed by the hard alternative sound forged on the band\u2019s 90\u2019s albums shouldn\u2019t get their hopes up because this sounds just like those did. However, the Rush playing on this album is a band refreshed, much unlike the Rush pre-hiatus. The revived Peart delivers one of his strongest performances in years, while Lee and Lifeson\u2019s guitars crunch harder than ever (that \u201cOne Little Victory\u201d intro riff is huge). The material is not intricate by any means, but it\u2019s clear that the creative juices are once again flowing. Lifeson\u2019s riffs are interesting, Peart is vibrant, Geddy Lee is Geddy Lee, things are good.\n\nThe album tends to be heavier than most of the band\u2019s records, with lyrics bathed in optimism instead of pretension (there\u2019s plenty of spiritual mumbo-jumbo too, as well as a glimpse into Peart\u2019s catharsis). There\u2019s a little Alice in Chains in here, a little Soundgarden, and, my god, a little bit of Rush too. Indeed a lot of the better musical ideas occur during the subdued moments, where Lee and Lifeson harmonize as beautifully as they ever have. Once again, we find Alex Lifeson being a bit too modest with his soloing, but his rhythm technique makes up for it a bit. All in all it\u2019s just a solid, albeit long, Rush album; the only problem being that it\u2019s a modern Rush album, making it far inferior to those of their heyday. \n\nBut considering the age of the band, the direction they were heading prior to this, and the personal tragedies of Peart, it\u2019s a miracle that this thing is listenable at all. The fact that it\u2019s quite good is even harder to believe, but it\u2019s quite the case here. It won\u2019t be an immediate favorite for fans coming off a steady diet of their classic material (in fact, it probably won\u2019t be a favorite at all), but with the right perspective, it\u2019s clear that it is an honest, consistent album from a band that a lot of people had written off as spent. Perhaps not the comeback album you might have been hoping for, it is nonetheless reasonable for what it is.\n",
        "\nIn my opinion, Rush\u2019s legacy is defined by their consistency. Their first decade of studio activity (the ten albums from Rush to Grace Under Pressure) ranges from quite good to absolutely brilliant (the lowest score I\u2019ve given to any of them is an 80). But no band whose work spans a long period of time is capable of maintaining such an inspired pace forever. After all, Rush has two more decades worth of material since \u201984. Power Windows, their eleventh studio album, is the first to dip below their legendary margin of quality and unfortunately it wouldn\u2019t be their last.\n\nThe theme of the album is power and ironically, that\u2019s precisely what its songs lack. Opener \u201cThe Big Money,\u201d despite being one of the better tunes on the album, is a great example of what\u2019s wrong with Power Windows. There\u2019s just too much reliance on the synthesizers and vocals and not enough emphasis on the band\u2019s famous rhythm section. Alex Lifeson is again virtually absent from this recording, as he is on most of the band\u2019s mid-80\u2019s output (the leads are there, but they\u2019re brief and unimpressive). Getty\u2019s bass is still prominent and Neil Peart\u2019s drum prowess is too, but by track two the rampant synthesizers have become completely overwhelming. A line from \u201cGrand Designs\u201d states it best: \u201ctoo much style without substance.\u201d \n\nBut truly, it\u2019s hard to concentrate on the funky bass of \u201cThe Big Money\u201d and cool vocal harmonies with all the pad layers. This problem recurs throughout the album, notably in \u201cTerritories\u201d and \u201cEmotion Detector.\u201d What happened to the subtle layering of Signals? Or at least the potent moodiness of Grace Under Pressure? Indeed there are no songs with the immense draw of \u201cBetween the Wheels:\u201d the best we get here is \u201cMystic Rhythms,\u201d the band\u2019s weak attempt at a pure New Age sound. With all the emphasis on atmosphere and superficial pop fodder, you\u2019d find it hard to believe this band ever played rock music, progressive or otherwise.\n\nThe only song that really approaches the pedestal of what Rush is capable of is \u201cManhattan Project,\u201d a song about the atomic bomb. Sort of connected to Grace Under Pressure lyrically than to the rest of this album (which is remarkably less compelling than a Rush release typically is), it makes use of a moodier atmosphere complemented by booming bass pedal to good effect. It\u2019s also the sole beacon of thoughtfulness; the rest of the album seems lazily written by comparison. \n\nFor those that really enjoyed Signals and Grace Under Pressure, Power Windows is an extension of that sound, albeit a shallower, forced incarnation. Similar to Yes\u2019 90125 and other 80\u2019s releases from 70\u2019s progressive bands, it\u2019s the first album chronologically that you could call mediocre and not receive a tirade of abuse from Rush\u2019s devoted fanbase. \n\nKey tracks: \u201cThe Big Money,\u201d \u201cManhattan Project\u201d\n",
        "\nI have to say, apart from being the single greatest influence on the genre; they are the single most consistent band ever. It\u2019s the band\u2019s 15th effort damn it! And they still manage to bring fresh new equally amazing tunes. The sound here is slightly different though; it\u2019s a little more towards mainstream pop, but don\u2019t let it disappoint you because their original retro groove is still there. \n\nA lot of the characteristics of their original self can be seen here. When other bands move towards a more mainstream sound they end up losing half of their original fan base, but not this one. Despite the change in sound, this album can convey Rush\u2019s capabilities to its old fans, and introduce the band\u2019s abilities to new ones. Not only does this invite more audience & reaches number two at the US billboards without disappointing existing followers, it should climb a couple of spots in both parties\u2019 list of favourite artists. \n\nHowever, having said all of that, if you for a moment forget that it\u2019s the band\u2019s 15th effort and raise your expectations as high as 2112 or Moving Pictures, you are left with fairly less technicality and complexity as compared to what made you fall in love with the band. Now I for one wouldn\u2019t criticize the album for such a petty reason, but just to play devil\u2019s advocate, the song structures here are too simple as per Rush standards. The time signatures and chord progressions are simpler as well. Usually with Rush\u2019s music there are more things you notice about the composition the more times you listen to it, unfortunately not in this case. Apart from the regular overdubs theres almost nothing here that you won\u2019t be able to catch or identify the first time. \n\nProduction has never been a problem with Rush. The balance between all instruments here is perfect and the variations in guitar tones are noticeable. Such stellar & resonant mixing can be found only with this band and maybe some other rare cases. \n\nThe keyboards have been drawn out till a certain extent but they have retained the beautiful overtones. Alex sheds out a lot pretty cool riffs throughout the album and makes himself count. The guy has always been overshadowed by his band mates but here he tells us why he should not be overlooked and why he deserves his share of credit. \n\nLyrically, dark emotional themes are still the focus, as can be seen in songs like Nobody\u2019s Hero and Everyday Glory. However, I wouldn\u2019t agree with the Grammy nomination of the instrumental \"Leave That Thing Alone\" due to its high level of simplicity. Its sounds like a talented alternative rock band trying its hand at an instrumental and is nowhere near Rush standards. \n\nEverything taken into account, this album still deserves a good, sturdy and respectable 77.\n",
        "\nFinally. Finally, the rather weak and uninspiring \u201csynthesizer era\u201d (except Grace Under Pressure) of one on of the most revered bands in the business today ended with the release of Rush\u2019s fifteenth studio effort in the year of 1993, \u201cCounterparts\u201d.\n\nThe music however isn\u2019t exactly a return to their progressive roots. The album adopts a very commercially successful, radio friendly approach to music with the influence of pop still clinging on to the band\u2019s music though it\u2019s more of an influence rather than the band\u2019s chosen genre of music. Long, complex tracks and mind-boggling time signatures are no more and Geddy Lee\u2019s open mindedness to experimentation and continuous craving for learning and adopting new styles of music has lead to the band even incorporating the sound of 90\u2019s alternative rock within it\u2019s spectrum. This album sheds off much of the main artillery the band had during the last decade of its music, which is quite obviously the synthesizer with much being the key word. The synthesizer is now more of an accompaniment to the band rather than the centerpiece as it had been for the past decade. \u201cCounterparts\u201d is one of the band\u2019s most guitar driven albums let alone in a decade but in their entire lifetime, which has now entered its fifth decade since its inception in 1968.\n\nThe near complete shedding off, of the synthesizer is evident as the album kicks off with \u201cAnimate\u201d, with Neil Peart\u2019s drums and Lee\u2019s bass signaling a new era in the band\u2019s music and is a great slightly pop influenced rock track with the synthesizer playing in the background, helping rather creating the atmosphere the band intends too. The newly acquired alternative rock mixed with the 60\u2019s hard rock sound is all too much evident with the band dishing out one great track after another and almost clearly signaling the band\u2019s return to form. \u201cStick It Out\u201d almost abandons the pop influence and seems like Rush in it\u2019s early days mixed with the catchy choruses, the characteristic of 90\u2019s rock. \u201cCut To The Chase\u201d, the third track is probably as close to the band\u2019s progressive era as it got to wit this effort. Mixing of intricate melodies as still making it seem as if they belonged together best describes this track. Nice shifts between Alex Lifeson and Neil Peart only make this song better. \u201cNobody\u2019s Hero\u201d, on the other hand is a more serious track and is a mini classic by Rush. It is mainly acoustic and bass yet goes along very well and leaves a good taste in the mouth.\n\nAfter almost lulling the listener to almost believing that the band has strongly returned to form even if it does not mean playing progressive again, this is where the decline even if it rather graceful begins. \u201cBetween The Sun & Moon\u201d is a fun track and reeks of a rather chilled out approach by the band. The next tree tracks, \u201cAlien Shore\u201d, \u201cSpeed Of Love\u201d and \u201cDouble Agent\u201d are however not good at all. With pop being the main influence here and the synthesizer once again being much more than just an accompaniment, these tracks are a rehash to the bands previous, rater poor, synthesizer era. Except for the solo these tracks may prompt you to press the skip button and I encourage you to do so.\n\nThings once again begin to change with the instrumental of the record, \u201cLeave That Thing alone\u201d. A synthesizer intro, huge chunky bass lines, amazingly precise drum lines and guitar work backed by dreamy melodies are the main characteristics of this track. This was also chosen for a Grammy under the \u201cBest Rock Performance\u201d section but was closely edged out to the title by Pink Floyd\u2019s \u201cMarooned\u201d. \u201cCold Fire\u201d and \u201cEveryday Glory\u201d are good album enders and both meander on the outskirts of being great tracks but never really get there.\n\nTo break it down, with respect to the band members, Geddy Lee\u2019s bass lines are extremely great and are unsurprisingly the highlight of the album. More than 40 years of playing the bass surely accounts for something and he always makes it count. This man is a genius. Another sign of greatness is his consistency as a vocalist. Almost twice the age of most in the business today and yet he puts them to shame with his ability not only to carry on but also because of his flexibility, carrying off tracks perfectly sounding emotional, serious or in a downright chilled out good mood. Alex Lifeson hasn\u2019t sounded better in along time and his solos are noteworthy. Nothing technical about his guitar work here, just another example of his ability to play with amazing precision and suiting the theme of the album. The same thing can be said about Neil Peart\u2019s performance on the drums with his performance with his work on Animate, Everyday Glory and the instrumental Leave That Thing Alone worth a mention.\n\nThe fans of progressive Rush may find this a bit of a letdown and those tracks in the middle of the album, which bleed inconsistency not helping much either. A good album nonetheless, signaling the entry of the band into yet newer horizons.\n",
        "\nHemispheres is a majestic yet charming album that features Rush doing what they did best in this era of their creativity; using whatever textures of music were necessary to bring their elaborate stories to life. \n\nThe mammoth title track opens with splashes of clean guitar before a menacing march. Some of the musical themes that will be reprised over the course of the song are presented in the prelude as the lyrics set the stage for what you are to witness. The Apollo and Dionysus sections are two halves of the same whole not only in terms of the album's concept, but in the music. The main riff for each section is the same only with different lyrics each presenting a different point of view, thus illustrating a mind at war with itself. The weird time signature of the riff combined with Geddy Lee's mesmerizing vocals pull you into the debate and further make you feel as if you are a part of the story. A heavy galloping riff is the transition into the Armageddon section which is one of the most powerful moments of the album. \"Circumstances\" begins with a heavy riff that gets modified later in the song to create a memorable chorus. This track is a great example of how Rush could craft a song with a radio-friendly length, but without sacrificing the riffs, time signatures, and experimentation that define the band. This ability would become the foundation of their next era of songwriting beginning with Permanent Waves.\n\nDespite the innocuous title and happy feel of the music, the lyrics of \"The Trees\" read like the nightmare version of \"Hemispheres.\" In this scenario, the two opposing forces within the same forest were so busy arguing with each other that they were ignorant of any external danger until it was too late. The sensitive instrumental section beginning at 1:50 is one illustration of how Rush create a story using music. Clean guitar, temple blocks, and keyboards evoke images of creatures frolicking in the forest. Hey, there's that monstrous owl from the Fly By Night cover! If this was a movie, this would be the part where the camera pans away from the arguing maples and oaks, across the woods to give the viewer a better idea for the vastness of the landscape as opposed to the narrow view of the two opposing parties. Maybe you would catch a glimpse of some loggers arriving, not with malicious intent, but simply to do their job. You can feel the tension in the music at 2:39 when this serene setting takes a dark turn before cutting back to the maples and oaks preparing for a showdown. The final verses have a wicked sense of humor that make this song even more endearing upon each listen. \n\n\"La Villa Strangiato\" starts with some Spanish guitar before a quirky instrumental section builds up to the heaviness at 2:02. From there the song explores the eponymous strange village with a variety of blazing guitar leads, complex basslines, and unpredictable drum patterns. Each listener will claim a different part of the song as its defining moment and that fun riff section that begins at 5:50 is a sure highlight. As complex as this song is, there is little self-indulgence even though the track's subtitle suggests otherwise. Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson, and Neil Peart are masters of their craft and even the most bombastic parts of their music have a clear direction. Each display of instrumental devastation serves a purpose to the song and acts to keep moving the story forward.\n\nHemispheres features the engaging lyrics, brilliant soundscapes, and skewed melodies that continue to define Rush. If you're more a fan of their epic fantasy era rather than their personal/philosophical age then this is essential listening. New fans who'd like to hear progressive music that emphasizes storytelling over flash should also check this out. This is simply a great album from a great band.\n",
        "\nWidely regarded as one of the most important progressive rock records ever released, \u201c2112\u201d is also considered as an unparalleled album in the large discography of Rush. The album is divided in two sides: the first one, which contains the epic title track, clocking in at (more or less) 20 minutes, and the second one, which contains five shorter tracks. While I must admit that the title track is indeed a classic, a great great song, I also have to say that, unfortunately, the second half of the record really harms the whole listening experience. All the songs featured on the second side are, so, pretty average and even weak.\n\nAnyways, you can find here great performances of the three musicians (this is Rush, remember that!). Geddy Lee delivers a very varied performance, vocals-wise, sometimes shrieking and screaming like a madman and sometimes singing very melodically and softly. His bass playing is also top notch, as everyone says. There is also an use of keyboards, I think that's he who plays them. They are used mostly on the title track, especially on the beginning of it. \n\nAlex Lifeson, the gifted guitar player, is another essential element of the trio, also delivering a varied performance, as he also uses the acoustic guitar very often, especially on the title track (on some movements like \u201cDiscover\u201d and \u201cSoliloquy\u201d) and on the more laid-back songs of the second half of the album.\n\nThe most important element of the band is Neil Peart, though: what a kick-ass drummer indeed! He is pretty dynamic throughout the record and, most of all, his playing is extremely technical. You can never tell what he's going to do next, he's extremely unpredictable, complex beat after complex beat, fast fill after fast fill, he really delivers a very good performance. He was also responsible for the writing of the lyrics; they are pretty good, especially on the title track. The concept of this tune is also great, even reminding me a bit of Orwell's book, \u201c1984\u201d, with its themes of domination of the government over the people. Basically, the story speaks about a guy who lives in a world ruled by the Priests of the temples of Syrinx. Later he discovers an acoustic guitar and begins to express his feelings with it. Unfortunately he presents the instrument to the Priests; they immediately destroy it. The guy, then, dreams of a better world and begins to feel that the Priests are unjust and... I think I have spoiled the story enough.\n\nMusically, this epic piece is also pretty varied and absolutely great. \u201cOverture\u201d is its first movement, being a nice instrumental, preparing the listener to what's next. It's no \u201cYYZ\u201d, but far from a filler. After Geddy Lee sings the legendary verse:\n\n\u201cAnd the meek shall inherit the earth\u201d\n\nThe second movement begins, being called \u201cThe Temples of Syrinx\u201d. Lyrically, it speaks about the Priests that rule those temples. \u201cThe Temples\u201d is a very dynamic rocker, featuring one of the most aggressive vocal performances of Geddy Lee. It is a relatively fast movement and the catchiest section of the title track, since the chorus is incredibly addictive. \u201cDiscovery\u201d is a slower movement, with Lifeson using his acoustic guitar and Lee singing very gently. \u201cPresentation\u201d is heavier, though, especially during the \u201cdialogue part\u201d, where the main character of the concept talks with the Priests about his discovery. \u201cOracle: the Dream\u201d and \u201cSoliloquy\u201d are, again, calmer. The last movement, \u201cGrand Finale\u201d, is another instrumental, pretty similar to \u201cOverture\u201d, featuring some nice guitar solos. The song ends with a mysterious outro.\n\nUnfortunately, the second half of the record is a lot worser than the first, some songs are just average and some really weak. \u201cA Passage to Bangkok\u201d is probably the best track of the second side, being a straight-forward hard rock tune. \u201cTears\u201d is a poor attempt at a emotional ballad and \u201cTwilight Zone\u201d is very annoying, with that stupid interlude (\u201cyou have reached the twilight zone\u201d...). \u201cSomething for Nothing is another rocker, with a catchy chorus, and \u201cLessons\u201d another calm (and weak) song. It seems that Rush used all their energies on the composition of the title track and forgout about the other tunes. Unfortunately, because of that, the whole listening experience is harmed.\n\nAnyways, this is a decent Rush record, better get JUST the title track, trust me, it's the only thing about this album worth listening. Better, get the title track, \u201cTears\u201d and \u201cSomething for Nothing\u201d. If the album had this tracklist, it would be a lot better.\n\nBest Moments of the CD:\n-the chorus of \u201cThe Temples of Syrinx\u201d; when the main character of the title track is learning how to play the guitar; the outro.\n",
        "\nRush's back catalogue is a largely a maze of different niches and styles within the progressive rock field. From the classic rock approach of Rush and Fly by Night to the epic stylings of 2112 and A Farewell to Kings to the synth laden era of Signals and Power Windows to the more modern prog approach of Counterparts and Test for Echo, Rush has quite an impressive resume. Which part of Rush's catalogue does Vapor Trails finto then? Well the short answer is none.\n\nRush is known for having an amazing drummer and two very largely underrated players. The highlight of this album is definitely Neil's impressive drumming, but Alex and Geddy definitely shine on this album as well. Alex Lifeson has a knack for writing very memorable riffs that are not showy. His performance on this album is completely outstanding. A lot of really awesome riffs and even a couple of really well thought out solos. Geddy Lee, as usual, has impressive bass lines throughout the entire album. He definitely forges ahead and plays a lot of really memorable lines and fills. And his vocals are spot on! This is best vocal performance Geddy has done since \"Grace Under Pressure\". Neil Peart sounds as incredible as ever. My only qualm (and this is minor) is that since the late 80's until now he has been riding on the ride cymbal a little too much. He belts out a lot of really awesome fills and rhythms (listen to One Little Victory). \n\nThis Rush album is a different beast than anything else they have released to this point. It's full of energy and really is a hard rock album (and I haven't seen Rush this energized since \"2112\"). It seems Rush has forgotten or purposely left out many of their progressive tendencies and went for an all out rock album. This is by no means a drawback! It seems to make every song a little more easy to swallow and digest. Rush are definitely making a statement with this album, and that is \"we're not your mom and dad's Rush anymore\". While a lot of this album is hard rock, there are some nice ballads (such as \"Ghost Rider\"). Many people seem to knock on Geddy Lee for his vocals, but I think they definitely work on this album. The faster, more driving pace of many of the songs just fit his vocal style so well. And the ballads! Geddy just sounds great on those too!\n\nThe production is top notch. Every instrument shines through. No instrument undermines or tries to outdo another. Everything has the proper place in the mix and the vocals are just right as well. So no complaints there.\n\nThe only real drawback of this album, in my opinion, is the lack of an epic track (I know we haven't seen one of those in quite some time). But then again, with the style of this album, an epic track may not have worked out very well.\n\nRush definitely deserves applause for creating a memorable and uplifiting album (especially after the trials and tribulations of Neil Peart prior to this release). It's just an amazing album that has to be heard. I think that all fans of Rush and prog should check this out. If you're new to Rush, this may be a great starting point!\n",
        "\nAfter 2007's masterful studio output 'Snakes & Arrows', Rush hit the road in support of their latest offering. They really were riding a high. S&A was viewed by many as arguably Rush's finest offering since the 80's as well as a sign of rejuvenation and that the band's life blood was flowing ever strongly. So, in hindsight, I guess it was really no surprise that the band wanted to perpetuate the wave of acclaim and momentum by issuing (yet another!) live album. Indeed, this two disc release is the full-monty for any Rush enthusiast. Old, new, and surprisingly obscure songs have found their way into the latest live set list and put together provide the perfect companion piece for the studio recording. \n\nEver present are the classic live staples ala Tom Sawyer, Spirit of Radio, Freewill and Subdivisions (the latter sounding as inspired and moving as it ever has, I might add) while numbers like Circumstances, Entre Nous and Digital Man will bring a smile to any Rush lover's face for their combined unexpected presence on this release. Actually, when it boils right down to it, that is the main selling point of Snakes & Arrows Live: the oddities. The classics have been heard on Rush tours and live releases ad-nauseum for the past three decades but the aforementioned \"treats\" are what keeps these Rush live offerings fresh and buy-able. A Passage to Bangkok, Witch Hunt, Mission and Between the Wheels are other prime examples of underrated moments from the group's past that have crept into their live repertoire in order to please the die-hards. Not surprisingly those are the songs that leave the biggest impact and come across as the most exciting, genuine and fruitful.\n\nThe band also chose to play a large portion of the songs off Snakes & Arrows on the subsequent live shows. Some work and work well while others meander and can be considered the low-points of this album. Spindrift, for example, does nothing for me outside of an okay main riff and Armor & Sword is just doldrum in my humble opinion. Fortunately though, that's where the cons end as the other Snakes & Arrows tracks are performed with vigor and translate very well on stage. From the heaviest 'Far Cry' to the lightest 'Hope', if you listen to this live CD and have not heard the studio versions then it's really not to hard to grasp why the latter was considered such a juggernaut when it was issued. Oh, and don't worry, Neil Peart has another \"Does this man have 5 arms?!\" drum solo included here with a notable big band flare to it. It's fun, just like the rest of this stellar release.\n\nThis was business as usual for the band. Another tour, another impressive live album. While there are minor faults with this one such as certain songs that just aren't exciting in a live setting and Geddy Lee's voice at times coming across as a little weak, this album packs more than enough punch and will undoubtedly keep Rush fans happy for the time being. Until they start salivating for that next brilliant studio album, that is.\n",
        "\nAnd a damn fine album at that. This is the first of many Rush albums to 'click' with me, and it's obvious why. Geddy Lee provides great vocals (unique and distinctive voice as well) while Alex Lifeson provides great supporting vocals. Alex brings in some blistering prog-rock solos, while Geddy Lee backs it up with some of the greatest bass I've heard on a rock album. Then, Neil Peart. This guy can break out complicated, almost impossible, drum tracks that never disrupt the rest of the music, even when soloing. The writing as well is superb, especially on the epic 20-minute title track.\n\n2112 is one of a few ultra-long songs that dot Rushs early work. This one is the longest and arguably the most epic, with a storyline about a man who finds a guitar, only to be rejected by his society and himself commiting suicide. The musicianship and writing on this song is amazing, the beginning provides the live-staple and is followed up by an acoustic, detailing how the main character learns to play guitar.\n\nI would easily buy this album for just the title track, but the rest of the album is extremely solid. Passage To Bangkok, while the weakest, gives a good chorus. The Twilight Zone is a softer song at some points, hard at others, overall it provides a good feeling that coincides with the excellent TV show. Lessons sees Geddy screaming like a teacher trying to get through to a stubborn student.\n\nNext up, Tears, easily the strongest on the latter half of the album, is a moving song that makes you feel genuinely sad. This song just is overcome with emotion, and if you're not careful you could find yourself spilling tears over Tears. The album closes with Something For Nothing, a solid song with a great chorus.\n\nOverall, this is a great prog-rock album, and provides a great contrast between the acoustic and the almost metal-esque riffs. I'd suggest this to anyone who's looking to get into Rush.\n\nHighlights: 2112 Pts. 1, 3 and 6, Tears\n",
        "\n2112, Caress of Steel, Hemispheres, A Farewell to Kings... All of those Rush albums are widely regarded as landmarks of the progressive rock/metal genre. They influenced lots of new bands and musicians and played an important role in the divulgation of the progressive genre.\nAfter composing those technical and complex albums, Rush began a new phase, composing more radio-friendly and straight-forward songs than true progressive epics.\n\nThis album represents the transition between those two phases; on one hand, it has Natural Science and Jacob's Ladder, two tracks that wouldn't sound out of place on, for example, Hemispheres, and, on other hand, it has Entre Nous and Freewill, two extremely catchy tunes that would fit well on Moving Pictures or Grace Under Pressure, two records that the band released after this one.\n\nAfter giving the album some spins, it's easy to find evident differences between Permanent Waves and the rest of the 70's Rush catalog. \nFor example, Geddy Lee isn't shrieking like a madman anymore, as he delivers a more melodic performance. \nThe songwriting isn't so intricate. \nThere is more emphasis on the keyboards.\nEvery song is catchy.\n\nWhen trying to release a more radio-friendly record without losing their own identity, countless bands failed. Surprisingly, Rush succeeds doing it: Permanent Waves is, probably, a commercial record, but it still has progressive elements all over it, that keep the integrity of the band intact.\n\nThe record is an authentic hymn to life. The uplifting lyrics of Neil Peart fit the beautiful music very well, and because of that, the album has an interesting and happy atmosphere (from Entre Nous, an authentic ode to love, to Natural Science, a hopeful track that talks about honesty and sensibility).\nDespite being a fantastic lyricist, Neil Peart is also, like everyone knows, an outstanding drummer. He proves that again on Permanent Waves, playing hard and complex patterns that fit the music (instead of playing those patterns just to show that he can do them well); he also shows some versatility, adopting a softer approach to the calm Different Strings.\n\nThe first track was the first big hit single of the band and is called Spirit of Radio. In fact, despite being a hit single, the song is pretty complex, featuring some interesting transitions, a reggae-influenced (!!!) section and a fine guitar solo. This tune is also an example of the new vocal approach that Lee adopted. As I've already said, don't expect Geddy to scream like on 2112, he now sounds more like a conventional rock vocalist. And that doesn't work bad at all, as he delivers a nice vocal performance, which fits the warm atmosphere very well.\n\nAll the other songs of the album are divided into two categories: the catchy ones and the progressive ones. Freewill, Entre Nous and Different Strings fall into the first.\nFreewill contains, probably, one of the \u201ccatchier\u201d choruses I've ever heard. Entre Nous is an authentic underrated gem: contains a bass and a guitar solo (that are just amazing, if you ask me) and great lyrics. Different Strings is the softer song of the record, a tune dominated by the uplifting acoustic guitar work of Lifeson and the astounding vocal performance of Geddy Lee.\n\nNatural Science and Jacob's Ladder fall obviously, into the progressive category. Jacob's Ladder is, probably, the only somber song of Permanent Waves. It begins with a priceless build-up and then Geddy begins to sing about a storm that is about to begin... And then, around the two minutes mark, the storm is unleashed, thanks to a fantastic guitar riff and to the precise drum work of God, err, excuse me, Neil Peart. The middle section of the track is filled with a quiet breakdown, which probably represents the end of the storm.\nNatural Science contains, again, amazing lyrics and is divided into three sections: Tide Pools, Hyperspace and Permanent Waves (which is my favourite section).\n\nThis is a record to be heard as a whole; in my opinion, the songs sound rather weak when heard individually, but, as a whole listening experience, the album is a winner. However, some tunes, especially Freewill, Entre Nous and Spirit of Radio can get old pretty FAST, which is definitely a bad thing. The durability of those songs isn't very good.\n\nIf you can, get the remastered version of the record, as the sound quality is thirty times better than the one of the original version. My only complaint about the production is that I can't hear the bass drums on many of the songs, but, otherwise, the production is top notch.\n\nRush certainly released better albums, but this one is good, nevertheless.\n",
        "\nDo not expect another 'Moving Pictures' but do expect a form of Rush which maintains it's old style while continuing to add new elements. Rush's newest release is far from what you would consider a 'classic' but may be considered a 'favorite.' The amount of instrumentals may leave you flustered, but the amount of good material is very high. Rush continues it's consistency while other group's fail to deliver after their prime. This aspect makes Rush better than most bands who lack in releasing good albums one after another.\n\nAfter the first listen of this album I said to myself that it was a good album and I was not dissapointed but I realized it followed the trend of many less popular Rush albums, that being one or two hit songs and a lot of similar sounding alright songs. But upon my second listen I realized this was not the case. 'Snakes and Arrows' is an achievement which is better than many of their other albums. This may be hard to believe but I would rather listen to this album than '2112' or 'Fly By Night.' \n\nThis disc contains some of my favorite Rush songs. It really is, for a band that's far past it's prime, an amazing release. It sounds less grungy than \"Vapor Trails\" yet less progressive than \"Farwell To Kings\" or \"Hold Your Fire\". Yes, there are many instrumentals, but they are all pretty good, and don't overstay their visit.\n\nMy favorite song is \"The Way The Wind Blows\". It starts with Soft thumping drums, before bluesy, shredding guitar comes in. The riff is very heavy and pushing while the vocals recall songs like \"Tom Sawyer\" and \"The Spirit Of Radio.\" The songs pushes into six and a half minutes and is really in my top 5 Rush songs. \n\nAnother really good songs is 'Far Cry' that also has a very heavy riff, but is a little more jamming and fast paced. The chorus is very catchy and the song is also a very strong track. 'Armor And Sword' is another longer song that is very enjoyable. It begins very laid back with the line, \"The snakes and arrows a child is heir to, are enough to leave a thousand cuts.\" When the line is done the song gets massive an epic.\n\nRush is at the top of their game. When I saw them in concert for this album Neil Peart delivered and amazing, over ten minute long may I add, drum solo. They can still jam with older songs like 'YYZ' and Geddy Lee can still sing \"The Spirit Of Radio' like he did in 1980. Unlike other groups Rush is still as good as they were when they were young and I await future releases from this band.\n",
        "\nWhen someone tells you that they hear this album played everywhere, they are correct in the sense that they probably mean it, which is that most of these songs are radio mainstays despite the objections of throngs of cynical, asinine critics. However, the permeation of this album is twice so for those who followed the progressive metal album that was ushered in during the late 80s by the likes of Queensryche, Fates Warning and Dream Theater. Although each chose to emulate the sound of this album in different ways, the character of these songs can be readily extracted from such important releases as \u201cWhen Dream and Day Unite\u201d, \u201cRage for Order\u201d and \u201cPerfect Symmetry\u201d.\n\nRush has always exhibited a duality of complexity and accessibility, and here the band achieves the most balanced combination of the two. Ordinarily it would be unheard of for a song such as \u201cTom Sawyer\u201d with its complex rhythmic or \u201cRed Barchetta\u201d with its quirky harmonic passages to enjoy such notoriety and regular radio play, but with the right combination of hooks and the needed symmetry in the song\u2019s structure the band seems to scoff at the notion that all of the best songs contain a clich\u00e9 melody and a repetitive background. Even would be simple songs like the riff happy rocker \u201cLimelight\u201d and the quasi-reggae \u201cVital Signs\u201d make use of relevant lyrics and meshing of styles to disprove the notion that mainstream acceptance comes with the acceptance of musical shallowness.\n\nThe overall production and the mixing of the album is the very definition of sonic tightness. Although most would ordinarily question the concept of having a guitar tone that meshes together so well with the synthesizers employed to bolster the arrangement, Alex Lifeson\u2019s tone during his solos sometimes accomplish this, particularly the seemingly improvised \u201cLimelight\u201d solo and the more methodical lead break on \u201cTom Sawyer\u201d. The most aggressive tone is found on YYZ, which is probably the most musical sounding technical display instrumental I\u2019ve heard out of a band in either the rock or prog. metal umbrellas. Geddy Lee and Neil Peart continue to showcase the impressive feats of skill without taking away from the continuity of the arrangement, a trap that many progressive bands fall into.\n\nOften known for their longwinded rock epics, Rush has also included a break from the accessibility tendencies of the rest of the album in the 10 minutes plus \u201cThe Camera Eye\u201d. It goes through the usual contrasting sections of easy going keyboard ambiences and harder edged guitar driven ones, while maintaining the same synchronicity of the arrangement. The only real flaw in this rather impressive opus is that it takes too long to get going and doesn\u2019t present any instrumental feats until a guitar solo just a minute short of the end of the entire song. Part of the problem lies in that the band set such a large precedent for itself with the ambitious and towering \u201c2112\u201d epic and the unavoidable comparisons between it and the band\u2019s subsequent epics will rear its head for any listener familiar with that album.\n\nBut speaking from a personal standpoint, the most relevant song on here also proves to be one of the band\u2019s most underrated songs. \u201cWitch Hunt\u201d provides a simple subject matter in the lyrics, delving into the darkness of the witch trials of Salem, a favorite subject for many NWOBHM acts as well. However, the music contained within is probably one of the greatest yet likely unintentional displays of traditional doom metal I\u2019ve heard. The atmosphere at the beginning is so spooky it rivals the dark pictures put forth on the Black Sabbath self-titled song, while the low end chords that build the body of the song carry a slight similarity to the Dio-era classic \u201cSign of the Southern Cross\u201d, and might have had a somewhat indirect influence on the latter as well given the 10 month split between the release dates of the two albums. Geddy Lee\u2019s vocal delivery is also in top form, avoiding any extremes in high and low and simply giving a somber and narrator-like approach to the word delivery.\n\nAlthough the addiction that many classic rock stations have to playing most of the songs on here, this would be a worthwhile purchase for the fact that the two on here that don\u2019t enjoy as much play are more than adequate for the value of the album. Likewise, you get to experience the full scale of the work put into this towering work without some hack disk jockey trying to put his own thoughts on one of the songs into words before spinning some overplayed Zepplin or Lynard Skynard song. I would put this one in a very close second behind \u201c2112\u201d in terms of albums to get by the band if you\u2019re new to them. But for those of you who quake about how amazing \u201cImages and Words\u201d is, this is the album that likely made that one possible.\n",
        "\nHell of an album. The first song, Tom Sawyer, well... We've all heard it. We're all familiar with the synthesized bass note opening it's way into a pretty hard rocking commercial tune.\n\nThen comes Red Barchetta. By God, this song is a ballad of sorts, in the floaty, light way it begins, and the song itself is a love song about a car, and a song about enjoying time with ones uncle, in a futuristic setting where driving is outlawed. Great riffs, great, audible bass, and great, subtle drumwork. The vocals are just what one is to expect from Geddy Lee.\n\nYYZ is a godlike instrumental, pacing it's way quickly through near impossible riffage, scaling, and crunching. Quite fun to hear, and definitely fun to see live.\n\nLimelight is an amazing tune, not only because of the 7/8 time signature dominant in most of the song, but because of the solo, and the general feeling of the song as a whole.\n\nThe Camera Eye begins with a synthesized intro that reminds me of the soundtrack to Dawn of the Dead. The song reaches its true beginning at about 1:31. It's a pretty good song, utilizing that special synthesizer in a way that makes this very track unique. Much is touched on throughout the song, as far as tempo, signature, and sound is concerned. Amazing changes.\n\nWitch Hunt is BY FAR, my favorite Rush song. This song is amazingly creepy, yet beautiful. The haunting synthesizers, the chimes in the beginning, the sound of wind fading into the sounds of a mob (it's actually just the band drinking outside the studio layered on top of each other), and the drums that sound like a march, all segue into the most grim riff imaginable from such a band. The time signatures are impressive, as it is almost impossible to discern what time signature they are in at any given time. The lyrics are amazing, and delivered well by Geddy Lee.\n\nVital Signs sounds quite poppy. A shock that it was not one of them played on the radio.\n\nAll around, an amazing album.\n",
        "\nRush probably has the most loyal fandom of aging rockers this side of Pink Floyd. Problem with such a loyal fan-base when it comes to an old band is, every time there's a new album coming out, you are going to have all sorts of enthusiastic hype claiming it to be the return of the band to its mighty superior roots and this low bitrate 30 second teaser sample reminding them of the glory days of the band. Same thing happened with Rush's latest album Snakes & Arrows.\n\n\nPersonally the expectations weren't high considering the last album Vapour Trails was quite a debacle. Things change though. I mean, the band isn't back to its roots or anything. Neither is Alex Lifeson showering us with his blazing solos nor the band is writing sci-fi epics like the old. Snakes & Arrows sees some drastic and important evolution elsewhere.\n\n\nSticking to writing guitar driven songs thankfully, most of these are given a very see-saw epic structure because of being written on an acoustic guitar with contrasting heavy guitars and the band has clearly put them all together in the jam room instead of the isolation approach. Acoustic guitars are often strummed throughout songs even while electric and distorted guitars are present and Lifeson uses banjos and mandolins to effectively dress things up a little every now and then. Don't fret though, there's absolutely no shortage of loud distorted rhythm guitars because the band completely rocks out here. It's just that the wild extremes are rather well worked out and the band just writes one great cohesive song after another with great arrangements, filled with layers and layers of guitars and some brilliantly infectious choruses. And a sea change from Vapour Trails, the production is crisp and you can hear all the guitar layers, the subtle mellotrons and even the one time orchestral bit, all damn clear.\n\n\nSome of the songs are immediately catchy and these are the ones that make this album click right away. Album opener Far Cry, Working Them Angels, The Way The Wind Blows, Faithless, Bravest Face, We Hold On are all some of the strongest songs the band has written in years and these will hit you right away, and also have enough in them to last multiple listens. This means that the listener, after the first few listens are going to favour the second half over the first. Especially considering the second half has three great instrumentals. The Main Monkey Business, which is bound to give these post-metal types a major complex and has Neil Peart's most goosebump inducing drum lines , the bluesy 12-string acoustic solo instrumental called Hope and the crazy Malignant Narcissism (a reference to a term used to refer the North Korean dictator character from the Southpark creators' movie Team America: World Police) which would fit damn fine on John Paul Jones' first-class Thunderthief album. They should write more instrumentals in the future. All three really strong compositions in the second half implies, I really couldn't wait till I'm past the first few songs.\n\n\nBut hold on - the rest of the first half grows a hell lot over time. Armour & Sword, The Larger Bowl (note Peart trying out some fancy Pantoum on this one) and Spindrift are as great as the rest of the early winners and those kickass instrumentals.\n\n\nThere are moments of vintage Rush, there are moments when the band is sounding completely like never before and there are moments especially in the middle of the album when the band takes a bluesier stance. Great playing from all the three as expected, killer writing with enviable hooks and that perfect unquestionable production. Geddy's voice has aged well with the high pitched squeals pertinently missing, Peart's lyrics mostly revolve around real life experiences and as for the solos, there are at least a couple of them that are prominent lead parts but go elsewhere if you're looking for Lifeson Leads \u00ae. These veterans are the top of the game and this is easily their best since Presto. I love this evolved modern Rush. Buy this already.\n\n\nhttp://www.kvltsite.com\n",
        "\nAfter four respectable studio albums throughout the 1980's - comprising Signals though to Hold Your Fire - it was once again time for Rush to release a live record. After all, they did have a penchant for releasing one live album for every four studio recordings. Meticulous band, I know. Anyways, \"A Show of Hands\" was their third offering outside of the studio and would turn out to be another impressive addition to the series of live releases the band had been issuing since 1976.\n\nIronically enough Rush chose the Three Stooges theme to open their shows on this tour. I say ironically because Lifeson, Peart and Lee are anything but stooges. Their ability to release quality album after quality album had been well documented by this point. A Show Of Hands would turn out to be no different. Every song on this album is played well and there are few points when the release really drags on. Subdivisions & Distant Early Warning are the obvious standouts having been the best tracks on their respective studio albums. Live they are just as inspiring. Marathon and Mission are two other highlights. The latter from Hold Your Fire sounds much more sincere and emotionally driven in a live setting moreso than in the studio, while the same can be said for the former. Mystic Rhythms is another track that comes across sounding like a million bucks on this album despite it's subdued nature. The song's heavy atmosphere carries over well from the studio to the stage, also. Witch Hunt is a pleasant inclusion on this release and is another song that lives up to its past studio brilliance. It is a great song that benefits from some over the top keyboards. And as expected, Closer to the Heart closes the album in fitting fashion.\n\nThere are some lackluster moments on this album, however. Turn the Page sounds quite goofy and Time Stand Still is simply average compared to the rest of the pact. However, the obligatory Neil Peart drum solo and Red Sector A more than make up for those minor complaints.\n\nAll in all, this was business as usual for Rush and the end result is another fine live recording. Though 'A Show of Hands' may not be the first thing to spring to mind when one considers Rush's extensive list of live releases it is nevertheless a fine representation of what the band had to offer while touring in the 80's.\n",
        "\nIn the late 1970\u2019s Rush were riding a wave of momentum that was years in the making. After three fairly promising studio albums the band struck proverbial gold in '76 with '2112'. It was applauded by many for its epic 20 minute plus title track which to this day remains a significant milestone in the band's history. Many people were beginning to take notice of the Canadian boys and in order to prove themselves consistent and worthy of such widespread accolades Rush would need to equal 2112's successes with their follow up release. At the time, many nay-sayers were afoot who suspected it couldn't be done. 2112, after all, was a daring release and one that usually only comes along once in a band's lifetime. But only a year later, Rush's \u2018A Farewell to Kings\u2019 would virtually render it\u2019s a predecessor a mere afterthought.\n\nA Farewell to Kings remains one of the band\u2019s most heralded albums. They began dabbling in admittedly odd instrumentation such as using a mini moog and bass pedal synthesizer all in an effort to carve out their own distinctive brand of progressive rock. It was different and despite lacking in proficiency in the beginning it did work on a number of different levels. The two lengthy compositions on A Farewell to Kings feature prominent use of these newfound elements. They also remain two of the band\u2019s signature songs from this period of their career. \n\nThe first, Xanadu, starts off quietly all the while perfectly introducing these new found musical additions. The intro reaches a climax at around the 5 minute mark and then the song erupts in soaring fashion. Such overwhelming power that leads you to believe you are in for something grandiose. An alternation between verse and chorus leads to the closing minutes at which point an epic Lifeson guitar solo takes the tune home. Xanadu is something that really needs to be heard. A perfectly constructed song that is not at all unnecessarily long for being 11 minutes and tells a story through not only the lyrics but the exceptional music also.\n\nThe closing track, Cygnus X-1, is the album\u2019s second lengthy track. With this song Rush managed to perfectly convey what a daring and dramatic quest into space would sound like. Complete with dark unsettling synthesizers this track is akin to Xanadu in that it opens quietly then explodes into musical splendour. Lee\u2019s bass intro sets the tone for the bumpy ride into the Milky Way \u2013 something not all that difficult to imagine as the song creates perfect theater of the mind in the listener. Smart time changes, superb build and technically advanced musicianship, as well as the heaviness of it all, make Cygnus X-1 instantly loveable. It\u2019s among the best of Rush\u2019s lengthy compositions.\n\nArguably, Xanadu and Cygnus X-1 do take center stage on A Farewell to Kings, but the rest of the release is mostly comprised of shorter albeit equally satisfying material. The title track is catchy and instantly memorable. It\u2019s a very effective opener that can be referred to as a sophisticated up-tempo rocker with a fantastic chorus that it is just impossible not to sing along to. Add to that a very captivating main riff from Alex Lifeson and a short classical guitar into for a little flair and you have another gem. \n\n\nCinderella Man, meantime, is also a winner that features equal parts acoustic and electric guitar. One minute it\u2019s full of vigor the next it\u2019s quiet and almost lifeless though miles away from descension into boredom. A raunchy middle part guitar solo from Alex Lifeson makes one conclude that Cinderella Man has multi personalities and you\u2019re not sure who you\u2019ll be dealing with next.\n\nCloser to the Heart, alongside Tom Sawyer and the Spirit of Radio, is often regarded as the band\u2019s finest moment in the minds of a mainstream audience. It packs quite a punch for being under three minutes long and is almost entirely worthy of all the attention it\u2019s received over the years, though time hasn\u2019t done it any favors . The song, mind you, would go on to become a crowd favorite when performed live and demonstrated Rush was just as successful at writing short radio friendly songs as they were lengthy epics.\n\nA Farewell to Kings (2112 not included) was the first in a series of must have Rush albums. The only bump in the road here is the filler tune Madrigal and even that is excusable for being under two and a half minutes in length. This was the beginning of the second chapter in Rush\u2019s career and unequivocally the most successful. A Farewell to Kin\\gs would set the stage for years to come. It is a great entry point for those willing to explore the most acclaimed portion of Rush\u2019s catalogue.\n",
        "\n*Cue the MC*....\"Would you please welcome home...Rush!\"\n\nAnd with that, the beginning of their first live album. And what a live album it was. Comprising material from their first four releases, All the World's A Stage proved to non concert goers and live faith alike that Rush knew how to deliver the goods, when it counted, in a live setting. The album features songs recorded over four days at Toronto's Massey Hall and the production is not too raw yet not unpolished, putting forth the perfect sound for the kind of performance the band will be delivering. Speaking of the performance, it's very energetic and tight (when have the band sounded anything but?) and some songs sound faster at times even superior to their studio counterparts.\n\nBastille Day is the opener. A fast, hard rocker that gets the crowd on its feet and is many times better than the original album version from Caress of Steel. It just sounds much more exciting and lively and it really is the perfect way to kick off the show. Actually, the next three songs are quite similar to the first in that they're all fast, really solid tunes that plug along without missing a beat. You'd swear the band had about fifty cups of coffee before taking the stage as they rock off the first five numbers with tons of energy and near flawless execution. Not at one single point do they sound sloppy, lethargic or uncomfortable. It's evident they had their act together on this night.\n\nContinuing, Lakeside Park is a slow to mid paced song that's simply okay. Geddy's vocals are kinda overbearing here. It is probably the weakest moment on the album but it is by no means intolerable. 2112, the band's magnum opus is next. It's a condensed version from the original seven parts to five but still succeeds with the peaks and valleys formula, slowing down during one part and speeding up the next all the while gradually building until the final climax that is the Grand Finale. This sounds as just as good as the studio version even if it is shortened. \n\nBy Tor & the Snowdog could be considered the highlight of the album. 5 or so minutes are tacked on to the original 7 minute version to allow for some extended live jamming, The song concludes on a crashing, boisterious note that leads into \"In the End\" a Fly By Night song that features some killer soloing from Alex Lifeson but is ultimately a little too soft and laborious for my liking. The band concludes their set with two songs from their debut: Working Man & Finding My Way. At the nine minute mark we get the essential Neil \"the Professor\" Peart drum solo. Yes, he was a machine even back in '76.\n\nWhile Rush would continue with the four studio albums followed by one live album formula for the majority of its career, All the World's A Stage is important in that it showcases the bands best material from the first part of their existance before they turned into a full-fledged prog outfit. Many of the songs are superb slabs of high octane rock n' roll while only two come to mind as being simply 'average'. The performance is full of energy and each band member was on top of his game on this night, making it very difficult to find faults in the release.\n\nFor 1976, this live album was simply unbeatable.\n",
        "\nIn 1981 Rush began distancing themselves from the sound that had garnered them so many fans and loyalists in the decade previous. The band began abandoning the progressive rock elements and long-winded, complex compositions of years past - a cornerstone of their critically acclaimed releases. The resulting album \"Signals\" was certainly a change from their past works. Now, shorter, snappier songs accompanied an influx of keyboards and synthesizers. The music seemed to be more to-the-point and while it may not have been the successful formula they created and perfected in earlier times, it worked just the same. Because of this, Signals was mainly well received and remains a strong part of Rush's library to this day. However, the band's follow up Grace Under Pressure was by no means insufficient. The 1984 album finds the band pursuing the transition initiated on Signals but doing so amidst darker lyrics and more varied soundscapes.\n\nThe opener \"Distant Early Warning\", a cold war anthem, remains one of the band's most legendary tracks. It features a very memorable chorus that works hand in hand with perfectly used keyboards and driving guitars to push the track over the top. It was the perfect way to open the album and it's a track you'll notice yourself listening to again and again because it has great lasting value. \n\nMeantime, the ska inspired \"The Enemy Within\" and horn laced \"Kid Gloves\" illustrate the band was set on diversifying their overall sound while maintaining that unmistakable Rush aesthetic. But despite being eclectically ambitious the band also didin't forget how to write sturdy, hard rocking songs. The closer \"Between the Wheels\" is highlighted by menacing keyboards but also by some fantastic work from Alex Lifeson who plays his part perfectly on this album despite being buried in the mix from time to time. Regardless, Between the Wheels It is by far the heaviest song on the album and includes a solo that may even rival \"Freewill\" from the Permanent Waves album. It certainly wouldn't be ludicrous to call it one of Rush's most underrated songs. \n\nOther standouts from Grace Under Pressure include Red Sector A and Afterimage. Both songs are very poignant musically and lyrically. The sincere Afterimage deals with the loss of a loved one while Red Sector A features more heavy, intense keyboards as well as mellow, crisp guitar passages and speaks of human tragedies & sufferings during World War II. In fact, with a few exceptions, you could say that at the time Grace Under Pressure was Neil Peart's most mature album, lyrically.\n\nThe highlights certainly do outnumber the faults on Grace Under Pressure but there a few missteps that inhibit this release. Red Lenses is so silly that it commands the skip button treatment and The Body Electric, while not entirely worthless, is not too far off either. However, these are the only two examples of excellent songwriting gone astray on an album that any Rush fan needs to procure.\n\nGrace Under Pressure is undeniably a winner.\n",
        "\nTransition into the 80's may not have treated Rush too well according to some of their fans. A victim of the times, so to speak. Others, however, feel just as strongly about the band's synth-laden catalogue as they do the group's quitessential 70's releases. \n\nI fall into the latter.\n\nIt isn't hard to recognize that the band wanted to perpetuate what they had started on Signals and continued with Grace Under Pressure. As a result, Power Windows shows a band furthering experimentation and alteration yet remaining confident with their new sound. This is a very smart album, both lyrically and musically, and while you can eschew it for it's cheesiness you also have to appreciate that for it's time Power Windows was anything but subpar.\n\nThis album converys a very distinct atmosphere. Songs like Big Money, Middletown Dreams and Grand Designs produce a cold almost autumn like sensation. In fact, after hearing the album, one can completely comprehend the cover and understand the parallel between it and the music. The album title speaks volumes. Indeed, very powerful.\n\nIt isn't difficult, however, to see how one would not care for Power Windows. The band sounds dramatically different than their efforts five years prior and gone are the complex, lengthy compositions in favour of a more straightforward to-the-point approach. For some, the excessive keyboards do not help matters either. If one didn't know better Rush from 1985 and Rush from 1980 were two completely different bands. At least, to the untrained eye.\n\nLee's intricate and stunning bass lines are ever present, Lifeson while often times overpowered by the synths has some fine moments and Peart's handling of the lyrics is just superb. Mystic Rhythms sticks out for that very reasons and remains an all time favourite from this part of Rush's career.\n\nPower Windows remains Rush's top release from their 80's era for the simple fact that everything clicks. That is to say, each song contributes nicely to the identity of this album. It's a curious album musically and lyrically but tremendous and unique.\n",
        "\nA rejuvenated band & a practically flawless album. \n\nSnakes & Arrows is Rush's most exceptional output in years. Period. Stylistically, they've modernized their sound while keeping the musical elements that have made them a force to be reckoned with over the past thirty years. The result is a very energetic and dynamic record that is arguably their most accomplished release since Presto!\n\nThe first thing you'll notice upon listening, aside from the expected flawless musicanship, is the excellent, sharp production. Really the best the band has had in years. Such crystal clarity that showcases each instrument perfectly. Needless to say, with such fantastic songwriting it would have been a shame to release these tunes with a less-than-stellar sound.\n\nMusically speaking though, Rush haven't lost a step and if anything they continue to mature, refine and evolve their sound. That's saying a lot too considering most musicians their age rely on past glories and newer watered down material. Not Rush though. Rockers Far Cry, The Main Monkey Business & Workin' Them Angels demonstrate the band has not tamed or toned down their sound and if anything they continue to harden it. Meanwhile, sonds like The Way the Wind Blows display a breathtaking gradual build from soft and slow to powerful and epic. This release has dynamic written all over it.\n\n\nAside from sounding like a million bucks production wise and musically speaking, Snakes & Arrows also has tremendous, tremendous flow. One solid song after another. Short acoustic instrumentals compliment longer \"heavier\" tunes while harder instrumentals lead way to more melodic cuts. The disc, while clocking in at over an hour manages to keep the listener's attention by presenting a fresh sound with excellent construction and flow. \n\nMoreover, I really don't need to tout the musical ability of all three members of this band anymore than has been over the past three decades. Let's just say Geddy Lee is a bass god, Neil Peart a drum god, and Alex Lifeson is absolutely one the most underrated rock guitarist of recent times. Put all that together and you have another musically proficient album. \n\nAdmittedly, though, Snakes and Arrows is a grower. At first I enjoyed it but it certainly took multiple listens to fully appreciate this fine work of art Rush has crafted. Naturally, certain songs stick out more than others. Far Cry, the Larger Bowl and Bravest Face were three songs I just couldn't get enough of in the beginning but as time went on I realized each song is tremendous and individual. \n\nHaving been a Rush fan for years and owning 95% of their output I can easily say this album is a breath of fresh air in a dull, lifeless hard rock era where so called \"important\" bands would rather emulate every other band generic ensemble rather than release something meaningful and heartful. \n\nRush, safe to say, have not succumbed to this and continue to release pertinent, intelligent music. \n\nOne of the best of 2007.\n",
        "\nRush releases what is their 16th studio release, and what will ultimately be their last album of the 90\u2019s: Test for Echo. Meant to represent the band asking the hypothetical question of searching for intelligent life in this darned crazy world, but ultimately it\u2019s an apt metaphor for a band searching for their fan base, many departing after a decade of dwindling reasons to care about this apparently venerable franchise. \n\nThe new direction started on Counterparts continues, Rush composing another release driven by pure guitar sounds. Goodbye to keyboards and over the top musical extras, but not the heavy hand of production. Over dubbing and layering run rampant, and the only way the guitar sounds heavy is due to much meticulous engineering or the patent pending 90\u2019s excursion into rambling distorted guitars. Would it have killed them to just go out their and bust out these songs like the 3 man rock band they once were? Seriously, an album where Rush circa late 70\u2019s does their take on the 90\u2019s would have been interesting, but certainly not this \u2013 An alternative 90\u2019s band that does their take on Rush. \n\nBut even that could have been more interesting than this. This is just easy and safe writing. Once again, the band performs well. But the layers of production and repeated simple writing ethic (the correct term is \u201cPhoned in\u201d) make that irrelevant. Even Liberace himself would have a tough time making chop-sticks sound interesting. Same with the lyrics, I don\u2019t always expect a lot in the lyrics, but I do expect more from one Neal Peart. The man who wrote \u201cXanadu\u201d, \u201cTress\u201d, Hemispheres\u201d, or \u201c2112\u201d is capable of better than songs about internet relationships or a dog as metaphor for mans life (?!). \n\nThe formula is simple \u2013 Lifeson play the same alternative rambling leads, or an actually pretty good background lead to Geddy\u2019s bass lead, while Peart plays solid percussion, but nothing particularly amazing for a man with his reputation; each song a typical verse/chorus that repeats and blends with the next song to repeat the cycle. \u201cTest for Echo\u201d opens up, and it is solid enough. Lifeson sounds like he is having a good time, in the front and back when needed. This is not \u201cSomething for Nothing\u201d by a long shot, but it is solid. \u201cDriven\u201d, \u201cHalf the World\u201d, \u201cThe Color of Right\u201d are all decent, but nothing special. After this the album does a repeat of Counterparts and declines, sporadically providing decent songs, but also poor to average filler. In fact, this album falls further as it just starts to blur as your mind wanders to more interesting things. In total, some of these songs are decent, but none can carry an album, making the totality a mere blah. If you want to bother, you can rip a few songs off this to add to half of Counterparts and make a decent Rush 90\u2019s CD. \n\nI have to declare this to be the worse Rush album to date. At least with every other album, including the ones I have rated average to poor, there is at least one or two songs I find the urge to play once in a while. I haven\u2019t picked this one up in years, and only then to write this review. In the end, I can\u2019t shake the feeling the guys were on cruise after 20 years and 15 albums.\n",
        "\nWhat is this that reaches my ears? Why it\u2019s the most guitar driven sound from Rush in over a decade. In fact, the keyboards are so far back, they have been relegated to an incidental texture that has not been seen since Permanent Waves; just straight on notes from one Alex Lifeson and Geddy Lee. As this jolting sound blasted out of the car stereo on its first spin, I nearly spilled my oversized Slurpee all over my car\u2019s dash in sheer joy. Such a reaction would have been a waste on two accounts: First, the alcohol in said Slurpee would have gone to waste; second, this is not a return to form. \n\nBesides the idiosyncrasies of Roll the Bones, the previous 10 years of Rush\u2019s discography has been one stumble after another, the godfathers of progressive turning their wasted talents to the simple and shallow depths of synth-pop purgatory. But here the guys give up the instrumentation devices of this period and return to the basic formula of a three piece rock band. Yes, the guitar has made its triumphant return, and Rush is a better band for it. \n\nBut\u2026\n\nAfter the initial sound hits you, that sound starts to sink in and it becomes apparent that while the instruments have returned, the music being played is not a similar return to form. Pop still clings to this like a will-o-the-wisp, a ghost of albums past. But the 80\u2019s has been merely updated to the 90\u2019s, Lee\u2019s affection of watching and learning from modern trends has lead to the new white meat of commercialism: 90\u2019s alternative rock. Guitar driven alternative soundscapes mix it up with varying shadows of what Rush once was and degrees of what the band is capable of. At times it works, and bursts with hope for the future direction of the band, but at other times it breaks down into a morass of average and becomes a tough sludge to wade through.\n\nThe album starts out strong, \u201cAnimate\u201d pounds out well enough, Peart opening up with some warm drum pounding while Alex and Lee announce the new worldview order. \u201cStick it Out\u201d attempts to make up for Alex\u2019s lack of guitar presence on the last four releases, putting out his toughest, coarsest sound in recent memory. Things get better with \u201cCut to the Chase\u201d, with its wonderful shifts between Alex and Lee; it is well written and the band seems motivated to punch it through on the backs of their instruments. The rest rises and wanes like the tide, hints of greatness mixed with the tarnish of playing to a new pop scene. \u201cNobody\u2019s Hero\u201d is decent, and I appreciate Alex keeping the acoustic work in his vocabulary, but the made of radio chorus with its soap-box lyrics drags it down from lofty heights. \u201cDouble Agent\u201d, \u201cLeave that Thing Alone\u201d, and \u201cCold Fire\u201d drives forward with hints of greatness, but not enough to take the songs all the way. The rest is just average to poor, with too many tracks that just wash into background noise thanks to the same lack of depth. \n\nThis is almost a satirical opposite of their last release, where Roll the Bones possessed many of the synth-pop sentiments and over production I detest, but actually manages to work well thanks to good writing and performances; Counterparts removes the flop, brings home the guitars, and then runs it into slow motion with average writing. Sure, the performance is strong, but that is in the context of the material given to work with. Not a bad album at the end of the day, with songs ranging from good to poor throughout this makes the sum total disappointingly average. \n\nSomewhere hiding in this album is a good solid EP. As it is, it is a welcome change of sound that briefly sparkles before dimming into irreverence, shrinking into the shadows of a catalog filled with monuments.\n",
        "\nIf you like synthesizers and large productions, then you might want to take a big breath. Inhale deeply of Roll the Bones for it is the last time you will hear those sentiments in a Rush album; the band herein finishes what was started on Presto, if not back on Power Windows, and closes out an era of musical direction. Pop, synths, and super production collide with a reemerging focus on guitar, and compositions with depth, to offer a momentary glimpse of how the 80\u2019s could have sounded and worked, but failed because they didn\u2019t before passing into the twilight of history. \n\nAlex Lifeson is a welcome presence on here, his guitar an active and thankfully noticeable force herein. Welcome back! The band is at its best when you are allowed to go my man, never forget that. The keyboards are a texture, one that is notable but no longer an equal member of the band, its roll for the previous three albums properly consigned to the lead guitar. Alex, with Lee, is all over this thing as they should be. And Lee is simply Lee. After thirteen studio albums, what can be said but he continues to prove what the bass is capable of accomplishing. It\u2019s a lead instrument, its rhythm, it does solos. Hell, you can cut a tin can with it. When combined with Alex it lifts Roll the Bones to a level not seen in almost a decade. \n\nNeal Peart continues his journey for the perfect drum sound. His days of electronic drum sounds have disappeared, showing that a good drummer is a percussionist, a greater part of the whole that still maintains a wonderful warm sound, indifferent to supplying simple patterns in a verse or busting open the skills only he can deliver. He\u2019s simply great when he needs to be but not shy about disappearing into the back if the song demands it. Speaking of Peart, his lyrics are the best he has offered since Grace Under Pressure, the album thematically based around the concept of chance; many of the songs deliver the theme up in intelligent ways that add depth to the experience. \n\nThe album itself demonstrates the theme in some interesting song styles and structures. \u201cDreamline\u201d opens the album with a nod to the recent past in dramatic shifts from verse to chorus, but with Alex opening up in it, the style now works. Neal\u2019s lyrics are almost conversational in tone making the offering brilliant. Contrast this to the title track, whose chorus features an acoustic guitar while an interlude to the solo features one of the few raps I like. Yes - A rap. It\u2019s centered on the persistent theme of chance and I can\u2019t help but like the deep voice rolling out the smart lyrics. Then again, I\u2019m highly biased having seen this live: A giant skull with the mohawk bust this part out. \u201cWhere\u2019s My Thing? Part IV\u201d is the groups first instrumental since \u201cYYZ\u201d, and its just great. Sure, it suffers from high production, and it\u2019s too bouncy for its own good, but its just so god-damn fun I can\u2019t help but like it. Every band should take five minutes to show off. \u201cGhost of a Chance\u201d is Rush\u2019s answer to a ballad, and one of the few love songs they have put out, but an entrancing if not well written piece. \u201cNeurotica\u201d is an odd song that is infectious; light blending choruses being pushed by Lee, who dominates the verse with a heavy bass line, while Alex opens up in the pre-chorus up all over the map with simple but blistering axe work: a strange combination that is simply great. Finally, \u201cBet Your Life\u201d is an average closer with pop sentiments, but the lyrics just make the song; the group basically throws several dozen philosophies at the wall while Lee sings over the montage/mess with a simple chorus. Weird and interesting (and lyrically engaging) wins the day on this one. \n\nAn eclectic but wonderful culmination of what the group has been doing for the last four albums; it\u2019s easily the highlight of the period and a fitting end to it as well. Yes, it nods to a few pop trends of the time; but it is well written, excellently executed in its performance, and the trio is at full form and equally involved. That easily makes this the best 90\u2019s offering from Canada\u2019s greatest export.\n",
        "\nMy friend put in this album when it had first come out when I was over his house. I wasn't really paying any attention to it because I was in a very epic game of Uno, this comes back to haunt me. But a few days later I heard \"Far Cry\" on the radio and the melodic pre-chorus and chorus got me instantly hooked. About a week later I went out and purchased this album.\n\nI popped this CD in and heard the immediate, heavy thumping of the intro to \"Far Cry.\" I remember a different friend saying, \" Wow this is Rush? It sounds too heavy to be them.\" Which is 100% true. This sneaky single and first track on the CD starts in heavy with pounding, melodic bass drums and the bass guitar which delivers the sense that this might be one hell of an album. Wrong! All the effort in this album went towards writing \"Far Cry.\" The song after it, \"Armor and Sword,\" calms down considerably. Its so soft that it's nearly an acoustic session. No catchy riffs, no heavy parts, and what I think to be a maraca in the background. But I still had some hopes at this point.\n\nBut my hopes and dreams never became a reality. The rest of the album followed the same boring and light song structure as \"Armor and Sword.\" I don't really see anything else that sticks out as entertaining within this album. My mom who thinks that Nickelback is \"too heavy\" actually didn't mind this album. The only other song that I ever care to listen to is \"Workin' Them Angels.\" Now if you're into really soft stuff, this album is for you! If you're like me, you'll find this album boring and repeating. Other than \"Far Cry\" I can't pick out what songs are which, and I've listened through the album quite a few times now in order to write this review. \n\nKudos though for helping me fall asleep while in the car on the way to Baltimore. The endless drone of the same sound kind of did it for me. I find albums with variety are the key to a successfull album. And unfortunately one heavy song doesn't cut it. I should've listened a bit closer during that game of Uno, I don't think I'll ever play that again.\n",
        "\nRush opens up a new era in musical direction with Presto, it being the first releases after their third live offering in Show of Hands. Rush starts to move out from the synth 80\u2019s and their roll as composers to slowly find a new direction in the wastes of the 90\u2019s. This makes Presto a transition album, a loner of sound and style that is really a forgotten part of the catalogue. The popcorn pop sentiments still cling like a remnant of the past, but merge with the reemerging roll of Lifeson along with the bands reawaken desire to fire on all cinders again. This makes Presto a difficult and tumultuous release that rattles as much as it rides, but hiding beneath the hood of this enigma the band pulls some rabbits out of the hat with some excellent performances.\n\nGeddy Lee is in good form, his bass working its magic, being more than rhythm and a driving force as a whole. Once again he steps out and performs some succinct but good bass solos and the occasional bass lead. Singing, he\u2019s grown as a singer and delivers more in the realm of dynamics and melodies. Neal Peart has turned in a better performance with more interesting material, stepping up his game over the previous two releases, and this enriches these quirky performances. He even goes so far to rebuild his kit to pull off some excellent drum work on \u201cScars\u201d. Don\u2019t be fooled by the high production, there are no overdubs here \u2013 I\u2019ve seen him perform it live and can attest it is the real deal. Alex Lifeson, however, is the real story, as he tunes in on Presto and joins the fray. While certainly not a return to form, he does go equal time with the synths and it is a welcome thing indeed. Further, for the first time in years he pulls out the acoustic guitar. There is plenty on Presto to enjoy as the band slowly puts some punch back into playing. \n\nHowever, these fine points don\u2019t change the fact that the sound struggles, this transition from musical, writing, and production styles creates a mix that lacks identity; but the sound hints at a power thanks to the guitars, even if it won\u2019t be realized for another album. In fact, that\u2019s the feeling I get from this album, a sort of identity crisis that makes you wish to get on to the next album and hear exactly where the band intends to go with their music. Guitar based versus crash into mainstream choruses and the whole eclectic mess results in an album only a Rush fan can love, for only he will take the time to unlock and appreciate Lee\u2019s solo work in \u201cShow Don\u2019t Tell\u201d, Peart\u2019s percussion in \u201cScars\u201d, or Lifeson\u2019s leads in \u201cSuperconductor\u201d. But notice I speak in moments, parts of songs, and not as a whole. There are quality songs to rip, but overall the moments hide within other songs and are just as easy to pass over, which is why this album is ultimately just as easy to pass over as you move through a discography with much more to offer.\n",
        "\nNow THIS is bliss music! This is the first Rush album i've ever heard, and as soon as I heard a 30 second clip of 'Passage To Bangkok' I knew I had to own this. And i'm glad I do! This is a prog masterpiece! The first track is a 20+ minute epic about a future world where all art (including music) is being controlled by some space government. A boy, who thought the world was ok, discovers an old acoustic guitar in a cave and is blown away by the beauty of the music it creates. He presents it to the space government folks who decide to destroy it to stay in control. Knowing how much the future world lacked beauty, the boy wished he could sleep, dream and never return. Awesome! \n\nIn my original review I moved away onto the other tracks next, but i'm gonna revisit this because i'm starting to enjoy the first track even more. There are just more things you notice about the composition the more times you listen to it. For instance, when you hear the waterfall in the background (when the acoustic guitar is discovered, I presumed this is the 'III Discovery' part) the tinklings on the acoustic must represent the boy discovering the instrument and examining what exactly it can do - I never noticed this before. And then in the 'IV Presentation' part, I also noticed how when the boy is speaking the music is very soft, quiet, almost vulnerable, whereas when the government establishment people are talking the music is loud, powerful and dominating, symbolising their power over the young boy. Brilliant! I can't praise this piece enough, and this is probably the best piece of progressive music i've ever heard, the rest of the music on this album doesn't quite reach this calibur. \n\nYet the other tracks are certainly not lacking either. Passage To Bangkok is epic as anything, which some really weird (in a proggy good way) melodic riffing and impressive vocal lines. Tears is a beautifully sad ballad (which has been covered by Dream Theater) and Something For Nothing is a brilliant hard rock track to top the album off. \n\nThe leadwork on here is phenominal, especially towards the middle of the title track. If you enjoy classic metal, old hard rock and progressive music you need to own this, this is an essential for you. \n\nATTENTION ALL PLANETS OF THE SOLAR FEDERATION! \nATTENTION ALL PLANETS OF THE SOLAR FEDERATION! \nATTENTION ALL PLANETS OF THE SOLAR FEDERATION! \nWE HAVE ASSUMED CONTROL! \nWE HAVE ASSUMED CONTROL! \nWE HAVE ASSUMED CONTROL!\n",
        "\nRush closes out their 4th era of music with another live release, this one enclosing their 90\u2019s output: Presto, Roll the Bones, Counterparts, and Test for Echo. I must admit, I was a little leery of this one at first, the 90\u2019s not exactly being home to a lot of Rush I liked. But for their fourth live outing, Rush turns the tables on their own tradition and delivers some surprises. The first thing is that this bad boy packs 3 CDs with a total of 33 songs! Two discs cover several 90\u2019s concerts while the third is a recording from a concert in 1978. Oh yea, I was starting to warm to this real fast. \n\nAs always, there is an emphasis on the newer material, which is good (11 of the 33 songs are from the last four albums). Normally, I\u2019d complain that of the remaining 22 songs, 15 appear on previous live albums; but the trick here is that they all appeared on a release at least 15 years old at this point and further, that one suffered from over-production. Thus I\u2019m getting some of these songs under better circumstances. Also, not one song from the late 80\u2019s is present, so none of the newer material covered on Show of Hands is repeated. For my money, I\u2019m getting a more complete concert that doesn\u2019t repeat anything from the previous 16 years and actually delivers a better sound for some of the classics. \n\nBut that isn\u2019t the whole story. At this point in Rush\u2019s career, there was a purposeful shift away from the synthesizers and bigger productions. This not only produces a more organic guitar sound but as a result encouraged the band to revisit some of their early material. The result is some great classic seeing the light of live recording for the first time, and the list reads as a roll call of honor: \u201cLimelight\u201d, \u201cAnalog Kid\u201d, \u201cNatural Science\u201d, \u201cFarewell to Kings\u201d, \u201cCygnus X-1\u201d, and \u201cCinderella Man\u201d. And that\u2019s still not all - You also get the piece de r\u00e9sistance in the first ever full live performance of \u201c2112\u201d! No cuts or modifications due to space, just a full on performance. \n\nAs far as production goes, it is done well; the band learning well from previous live albums how to balance production with the vibe of sounding live. Further, I have to admit to enjoying the newer material on this album. Hearing them live with the classics under one natural guitar driven sound works well, and if anything heightens them.\n\nThis also comes with a booklet that folds out into a 7 panel montage of live memorabilia from the previous 24 years, while several panels on the backside house simple but fun live snap shots. Very nice and I\u2019m glad to see some thought put into this. \n\nGreat songs, the first live run of 6 great classics, a generous potion of old material reissued under better production, and \u201c2112\u201d\u2026 Oh hell yea. If you like Rush, this is the Rush live album to get.\n",
        "\nThird time out for Rush on a live release, highlighting the albums proceeding the last live outing: Signals, Grace Under Pressure, Powered Windows, and Hold Your Fire. By highlighting, I mean that Rush has once again put out a live album that is full of new material (save one song) that has not been released live before. This is a wonderful trend that gives maximum value for your purchase. After all, if you want the older songs, you can already get them on the previous live releases by the band. The one remaining song, \u201cCloser to the Heart\u201d is understandable as an album closer due to its popularity plus the longer instrumental used to end the album on a great final note. \n\nThat\u2019s the second thing that is nice; the one song they repeat is a different version. This makes having this version new and interesting. The excellent drum solo fills this role as well. Final thought is the intro. This live album provides one of the silly introduction pieces the band uses to kick off their concerts. In this case it is the 'Three Stooges theme\u2019 (\u201cThree Blind Mice\u201d - cute). Just a fun extra to help capture the live experience and I whole heartedly agree with that. Live albums should be more than a glorified best of compilation with crowd noise. \n\nAnother big plus is the production. The sound is good without sounding like it was worked over. Production can kill any album, but especially the fragile balance needed to make a live recording work. \n\nMy only real complaint for an otherwise well thought out album is the actual songs selections. This era of Rush features the career shift to 80\u2019s synth-pop, so naturally it is spread over this album. Although to the bands credit, they do pull off the massive production pieces well despite being a 3 piece outfit (assuming you ignore the fact the guys are heavily dependant on synthesizers and sequencers). But going into this live recording I knew I would have to deal with this era of Rush. The big problem for me is that they pulled the majority of the songs from the worse two albums!\n\nFun with statistics:\n\nDrum solo: 1\nOld Song: 1\nRepeat Song: 1\n\nGood Albums\nSignals: 1\nGrace Under Pressure: 2\n\nPoor Albums\nPowered Windows: 4\nHold Your Fire: 4\n\nSo the best two albums from this era get one fifth of the time while the poor ones get two-thirds! What a waste. But I will give one silver lining to the whole affair: The songs from the poorer albums do sound better here than their studio counterparts thanks to the guitar driven sound from being live. Still, overall there were better songs to pull from this era and the album suffers for it. \n\nIn total, this album is equipped with some poor song choices, but the good production and better sound of these songs live, all combined with the little extras and considerations do make it an overall good live album. But let\u2019s face facts, Geddy Lee is one of the best bass guitarists in the industry and the artsy cover shows him playing keyboards \u2013 That should tell you something.\n",
        "\nIn 1978, Rush released Archives, a box set that reintroduces the first three releases from the band: Rush, Fly By Night, and Caress of Steel. Actually, by Lee\u2019s own admission, the purpose was not to offer a retrospective (it had only been a couple of years) so much as to give Caress of Steel a second lease on life. The band was still pretty pissed off at the treatment that release got by critics and the impact it might have had on purchases from fans. As far as I have been able to determine, this has only been released on Vinyl, tape, and eight-track; existing on a limited run that ran out long before the time CDs. \n\nThe Box set itself is nice, featuring the star from 2112 along with the guy standing before it, arms upraised; all on a grey field. An interesting choice considering that the album 2112 is not featured at all. Inside you get a mini-poster also found in the Hemispheres original LP featuring a live shot of each band member. Beyond that, there are no extras you would normally find in a box set. No booklet, history, or any other extras. \n\nThere are three albums, one for each original release. No additional music, just each album reproduced in full. The discerning listener will note a slightly cleaner production and a few minor changes (the chimes at the end of \u201cBy-Tor and the Snow Dog\u201d are longer and now recorded into the track itself), but these are minor if unnoticeable; this was released in 1978 after all, several years away from the digital explosion in music technology, and more importantly only several years after the originals. Essentially, you are just getting each of the first three albums at once. \n\nAt the end of the day, this interesting release is something only a hardcore Rush fan could want, the only value it has is the fact it is collectible. For the rest of the population, you might as well just pick-up the first three albums \u2013 They are easier to find, they will be cheaper, plus they are available on CD.\n",
        "\nIn a catalogue of many \u201cBest of\u201d compilations Chronicles is unique on several accounts. First, it was released in 1990, so it includes a lot of material but nothing from their 90\u2019s output. Withstanding Roll the Bones (which is a good release) that is a good thing as the material was weaker.\n\nSecond, and in theme with the title, it actually dedicates tracks for each album released \u2013 including the live albums. Thus you have an interesting retrospective of each album, notably 2 tracks per album save 1 for the live albums and only one from Presto (it was the current release at the time). Also, Moving Pictures, being the golden child of the discography receives 3 tracks. This is pretty sweet, as you are not force fed \u201cThe hits\u201d, but get something from all the albums. \n\nThird, also fitting the chronicles theme, the tracks actually go in order of release. Thus you can listen to the songs and see the progression of the band through the years. That\u2019s pretty cool seeing how many compilations just mix the songs up, forcing the listener to jump jarringly from one era to another without rhyme or reason. \n\nAt two discs, this is packed full of songs (28 total \u2013 29 if you include the two parts of 2112). If you don\u2019t own a lot of Rush, then you get a nice variety of material to listen to, picking from the albums you may wish to follow up on. This little exercise is further enhanced by the booklet which divides the tracks by album. Speaking of the booklet, you get a few bonuses. It offers an actual mini-history of the band and a picture of each album. The details are a bit light, and it would have been good to get commentary from each member of the band, live pictures, session notes, or at least a little something extra for fans that have most of these albums but alas it doesn\u2019t happen. That wasn\u2019t something the labels didn\u2019t figure out to later unfortunately. Also, there is a lack of any unreleased material to add value for fans. No B-Sides, demos, cover songs, or even a new live song. If you are a Rush fan, you most likely already have these songs and will get nothing new to make this worth your time. \n\nDespite the good selection of songs, I do have some gripes on the content. This album was released in the age of CD\u2019s, and with the time these make available there is no excuse for the band to put some of their epic classics on here. Having Cygnus X-1 together for the first time on one CD would have been great, and would have been an excellent showcase for the bands history. I understand that would mean half of Hemispheres would have been reproduced and the label is probably banking on hardcore fans to just buy the respective albums, but this is a wasted opportunity to introduce new fans to the art-prog 70\u2019s. Further, they blew a golden opportunity to include the \u201cFear\u201d trilogy in its entirety. For those new to Rush, the \u201cFear\u201d trilogy is three songs (\u201cThe Enemy Within\u201d, \u201cThe Weapon\u201d, and \u201cWitch Hunt\u201d) that appeared individually on three different albums. Fans will have to wait another 16 years to get it complete.\n\nAs I stated, if you are a Rush fan who has most of the albums, then this offers little incentive to pick it up. There is nothing new to make it a must have. However, if you are new to Rush, or have only a few albums, then this is one of the best Rush compilations on the market. Despite my misgivings on how the label blew some song selections this is a very good introduction to Rush. It\u2019s chocked full of good material and highlights each release, giving you a chance to survey the entire catalogue and pick possible points of interest to investigate further.\n",
        "\nRetrospective II is the second installment of compilations that were released in 1997 to coordinate with the reissues of each album highlighted on this disc. This disc being a typical \u201cBest Of\u201d that provides assorted songs from 1981 to 1987. \n\nSadly, this compilation fails to deliver on a number of accounts. First, thematically, they left off Permanent Waves which fits the style of music much better than Retrospective I where it is was shoe-horned in, probably to boost purchases from new fans more familiar with the radio cuts. Second, for the discerning metal fan, this era is just not stacked with their best work. Half the album is wasted on material from the sub-par releases inhabiting Rush\u2019s synth-pop late 80\u2019s period, Power Windows and Hold Your Fire. At least for your money, you get three songs from the progressive epic pieces of Moving Pictures; four gems from the creamy synth-rock of Signal; but sadly only two from the neo art-prog of Grace Under Pressure. \n\nThe most important crime though, is the complete lack of bonus material. There is no booklet, just a fold out cover with the various album pictures and credits. No history or stories, band interviews. Hell, I would have been happy with a few pictures from the time period. Next is the music, here again there is nothing new for the Rush fan. No unreleased material \u2013 not even a lousy live cover song. In fact, there is a live album that was released in this period that is ignored! This compilation, while containing many fine tracks, contains not one reason for a Rush fan to pick it up. In the end it just comes off as a quick cash grab by the label. \n\nCompilations follow different rules than a normal album, thus the rant on incidentals. On a normal album, it\u2019s all about the music. Albums stand or fail on the quality of the music. Extras don\u2019t matter. But a compilation is nothing more than a re-release of selected musical moments from each album covered. You don\u2019t buy a compilation just for the aesthetics of the songs, for you are either an existing fan (In which case you already have these songs) or you are a casual fan (In which case you are not just listening to the songs, but getting a career retrospective); either way, extras are an essential method of hyping the band and giving value over the existing releases. \n\nThe music alone would make this compilation an 80, a rather sad commentary considering this is suppose to be a \u201cBest Of\u201d, but the sheer lack of any bonus materials or new songs makes this completely unnecessary for regular fans. As for new listeners or casual fans, unless you get a really good deal, you will be better off passing by this release along with its sister release Retrospective I and spend your money on Chronicles for a better retrospective on the band.\n",
        "\nMid-to-late 80\u2019s Rush is not a subject I tend to approach enthusiastically. With Neil Peart\u2019s eccentric drumming and Alex Lifeson\u2019s guitar presence becoming increasingly toned down while the bass and synthesizers became dominant, what the once-impressive trio was playing was barely above straight-up pop-oriented rock. But Rush were never a band known to play the same sort of thing for any extended period of time, so a changeup was inevitable. And thankfully, it was a change for the better in the form of Presto. \n\nThe most immediate improvement Presto holds over the last two efforts is in the mix. The synths, at times intrusive and overwhelming before, are toned back to auxiliary status while the guitars have been brought up to a reasonable level for the first time since Moving Pictures. This allows the emphasis to return to the rhythm instruments, resurrecting the groove that Rush maintains so very well. The importance of the mix cannot be understated: though several of the songs on Presto bear strong ties to the Hold Your Fire sound (\u201cThe Pass\u201d and \u201cWar Paint,\u201d for instance), they are much more tolerable due to the reasonable production. It\u2019s just a more complete package and everything the band does just sounds much better because of it.\n\nIn fact, we even get a few great songs out of \u2018em. Opener \u201cShow Don\u2019t Tell\u201d is excellent, carrying a similar vibe to \u201cThe Big Money\u201d but a bit more enthusiastic. \u201cSuperconductor\u201d is another energetic one and another obvious highlight. The less obvious ones roll around near the album\u2019s end, due in no small part to an interesting new synthesizer sound. I can\u2019t think of any other time that Rush used clean piano tones to complement their sound like in \u201cRed Tide\u201d or \u201cAvailable Light\u201d and it\u2019s a shame, as it\u2019s an interesting dynamic that works well on this album and probably could have been well utilized elsewhere instead of the cheesy 80\u2019s clich\u00e9s on which they too often relied during this period. Geddy Lee would use real piano sounds on his solo album, but that\u2019s a different story altogether.\n\nOf course, Presto is still far from an ideal Rush release. A few of the songs lack personality, blending right into that stereotypical 80\u2019s Rush sound (still better than Hold Your Fire of course) and \u201cScars,\u201d with its dance beat and electronica vibe, is a complete throwaway. Peart is a bit short of the mark lyrically as well, apparently unable to revive the connectivity he used to wield freely. Regardless, it\u2019s a quality album if you\u2019re a fan of the band and, despite the fact that it\u2019s barely classifiable as progressive rock, is still a marked improvement over its weaker predecessors in both songwriting and performance.\n",
        "\nRush releases their 12th studio album, and the pinnacle of Rush\u2019s new wave synth era is realized, the bands long climb taking them to the summit as master composers. To bad we gave up the journey, not wanting to see this view from the wrong hill. Hold Your Fire is a collection of all the wrong ideas from Powered Windows, with any remaining old fashion rocking filtered out to insure a perfect pop collection; at times inspiring, as if the bands current mission statement can\u2019t completely deny the great performers and writers behind the curtain, but otherwise safe and light weight.\n\nThe music gasps with a few moments of greatness, but otherwise crumbles under its own sanitary perfection, forcing the listener to see the empty space where once stood a complex machine. Big productions and engineering perfection is now an end instead of a means. And when the music does hit hard, you just probably missed it after wading through mediocre versus and simple performances. Now there are two words that make me want to cry: \u201cSimple Performance\u201d. This is Rush for Gods sake. Yes, Peart is performing well, and Lee is still a signature bass player, but both simply blend into the background, the band intentionally holding their fire as performers, writing themselves into a smaller part of a big whole. Don\u2019t even get me started on Lifeson. Besides a decent showing in the first and last song, the poor guy seems like an afterthought. How in the hell a three man rock band decides to write their only guitar player as a supporting part is beyond me. The moments he is allowed to shine (usually a token solo, which are still good) are just criminally to far apart. \n\nLyrically, this album rides just above average. I don\u2019t expect bands to necessarily be profound as a rule, but this is Rush. When I put on Rush I have expectations, but it\u2019s hit or miss on this one. If you look beyond ideas that are safe, generic, or pretentious (see \u201cSecond Nature\u201d), you\u2019ll see that \u201cMission\u201d turns a pretty good verse, and the conceptual \u201cHigh Water\u201d delivers in an abstract way. \n\nSpeaking of \u201cHigh Water\u201d, for me this is the one song that delivers as a whole, the simplicity and polish of the 80\u2019s highlighting a brief shinning moment of progressive conceptual goodness. Peart brings his \u2018A\u2019 game, Lee\u2019s bass is sublime or commanding as needed, and my god Lifeson slowly comes to life. His gradual escalation coinciding with the eastern themes, which is excellent for the song structure - Where have you been Alex! It\u2019s not \u201cSomething for Nothing\u201d by a long shot, but at least you\u2019re here. Next time get the guys to make the other nine tracks like this, and the album would have been a solid piece of 80\u2019s art-prog. I can live with keyboards and all the other stuff when they are on hand to support you. \n\nIf you are a big fan of 80\u2019s pop, this album will deliver for you. To the bands credit, they have written an album that far exceeds what one would think be possible of such music. If you are a huge Rush fan, you\u2019ll find a few moments, so wait and get a good deal on this along with its sister release Powered Windows. From there you can rip them together into a pretty decent EP of your favorite tracks. The rest of you will find this average at best. For me, this is a disappointing moment in a lackluster period of Rush\u2019s catalog. Moral of the story: A musician should never hold their fire.\n",
        "\nRush\u2019s 11th studio album to date fully realizes the bands growing trend of using super production and new wave synthesizers: The crisp and clear dream of 80\u2019s new wave pop. Sadly, this time around great performances can\u2019t save the band from themselves. Rush composing, constructing, and engineering an album that have rendered themselves into a bright and shinny two dimensional picture. \n\nThis is production turned up to 10, stifling otherwise decent performances. Music has a life to it that flows with energy, a life that can be drowned by a cold and sterile picture perfect production. Peart\u2019s percussion is an example, his technical prowess is still on display in many fine moments, but comes across as clinical, mechanical, and computerized. That is in itself a tragedy, as the listener should never have need to contemplate if the sound is genuine or a trick of studio magic. Peart is that good, engineers only on site to calibrate their instruments to his higher standards. The fact that this is lost or questionable is criminal. Add the keyboards and you have a sound that actual sounds more dated than material Rush released half a decade earlier\n\nThe compositions run from inspired moments to a desire to fast forward, usually in the same song as if each tune was a mix of old Rush and new wave filler, causing a urge to fast forward to the good parts. Alex Lifeson\u2019s guitar is properly mixed for the first time in several albums, but he spends too much time being another background texture, no different than the keyboards, until let loose for brief inspired moments that unleash what could have been. If they would have put the keyboards as sole background texture, and gave the forward parts to Lifeson to rewrite into riffs, this album could have delivered. Lee\u2019s bass is thankfully the same, his ability to work his half of the rhythm section only surpassed by his ability to make the bass a dominate and unique participant in the music. Peart, as mentioned is still in top form, my only wish is the production was rolled back to allow some warmth into his performance. \n\nSure, the guys rock hard at times, like in opener \u201cBig Money\u201d, but you still need to wait for a live release to hear them flourish under the banner of performance over production. Atmospheric moments, like in \u201cMystic Rhythms\u201d are lifted by well thought out composition but fail to carry their weight, again due to the airless vacuum of the production. See \u201cXanadu\u201d from A Farewell to Kings for atmosphere done right. \n\nLyrically, the album bounces around on subjects conceptually involving \u201cPower\u201d, but is underdeveloped and unworthy of the group\u2019s legacy, Rush now writing trite complaints about money, working too hard, and international disputes. That being said, honorable mention goes to the well researched \u201cManhattan Project\u201d, which is a good song and the only piece that lyrically delivers. \n\nAnd that is where the album ultimately falls apart; the guys are superior to the songs they have written and better performers than the sound they have created. Rush have obviously taken great care and time on this album, their self appointed roll as composers being taken seriously \u2013 To the point of burying their sound within safer ideas and a big budget spectacular. To bad they forgot we\u2019re here to rock.\n",
        "\nRush continues the synth based 80\u2019s with the neo-art prog rock of Grace Under Pressure, also known to fans as \u201cP/G\u201d. The smooth production and light tone of Signals was a pendulum swinging one way, with the weight of Grace Under Pressure swinging the other. By weight, I mean the multi-layered density of the sound, as if the band wanted to bring all the instruments forward, ultimately resulting in a texture of sounds washing over you all at once. Also, the tone of the album lacks the light soundscapes of its predecessor, musically and lyrically, becoming the darkest album since Caress of Steel and arguably the darkest album in the catalogue. The production of 80\u2019s Rush was painted in varied bright colors while Grace is many shades of grey. \n\nLifeson is more in the forefront this time, and it\u2019s good to hear his axe work swinging, the chops working in long deliberate strokes of dark contemplations. See \u201cBetween the Wheels\u201d for some of Lifeson\u2019s most sinister sounding solo work. Lee\u2019s voice rolls over the troubled landscape with grim lyrics, addressing varied personal and societal issues revolving around the theme of pressure. This can be the apocalyptic \u201cDistant Early Warning\u201d, the concentration camps of \u201cRed Sector A\u201d, or the fatality of \u201cBetween the Wheels\u201d. Peart\u2019s percussion is its usual technical greatness, but more structured, an attempt to drive the music less at times but provide support beams for the whole mass. This style change is due to the music, which has now taken a left turn from the usual hard rock of Rush with infusions of ska and reggae. \n\nThat last point must be reiterated, for the casual hard rock fan can be very well put off by this change in the groups sound. If you do not care for ska or reggae, then this albums stock will drop quickly for you. Keep in mind the ever-present keyboards also. There is a lot going on within those three concepts to turn many a headbanger away, for surely there is a lot going on that betrays the principles of rocking out and metaldom in general. It\u2019s the compositions themselves, combined with the performances that once again save the whole confusing approach, turning the dark tales into more than their parts, the density betraying a gratifying depth. \n\nGrace Under Pressure is the odd man out in the 80\u2019s synthesizer sound of Rush, an era that continues to polarizes Rush fans. While the sounds are there, the album is not the pop fare associated with later releases. It\u2019s an eclectic piece of dark art prog rock that is really the dark horse of the catalog. A love it or hate affair that is a definition onto itself, a piece of muse centered upon itself; combining many elements of what Rush was with what Rush will become, mixed with what Rush is this once. Give it a spin or three, but go in with both ears open.\n",
        "\nRush returns with Signals, and launches another series of releases that will culminate after three additional albums in their third live recording Show of Hands. The first era of releases were marked by the bands drive to perform, while the second era was dominated by writing, both lyrically and musically. This new era will be dominated by the band becoming composers, with larger productions dominating their albums. On a musical level and notable for many fans was the complete change in sound \u2013 The presence of keyboards signals that the band has embraced the 80\u2019s new wave. Further, subtle changes have taken place; epic or exotic arrangements are replaced by shorter pieces infused with larger productions.\n\nThe sound slams home, requiring mental rearrangement of what Rush is, for while the core of the band is still here, it is subtle in comparison to the changes. This is an album that, for the average metal loving listener, is designed to fail on several accounts: First, the keyboards take center stage, becoming an equal member of the band. Second, the lead guitar is mixed behind the keyboard. Lifeson\u2019s guitar is there, but more subtle and background. The guitar solos are not as dominant to the other instruments, and even these have been replaced by keyboard solos at times. The end effect is a recipe for disaster, but despite these enigmas the compositions and performances pull through to create something that just plain works. In spite of the new wave influences, Rush wrestles the sound into something of their own that actually rocks well, surviving the test of replays due to its depth and underlying complexity (Something new wave suffered from). \n\nNotable moments: \u201cSubdivisions\u201d is a driving masterpiece, and a good example of how keyboards should be used when envisioned as a full member of the band. \u201cThe Analog Kid\u201d features Lifeson the best and with Lee flows nicely, at times sounding as if the duo were just flat out jamming. \u201cThe Weapon\u201d continues were \u201cWitch Hunt\u201d left off (or will follow it) as part two of the Fear Trilogy, and is excellent with its explorations of how people, and societies, use fear against each other. \u201cLosing It\u201d is a great ballad, reflecting on the waning years of one\u2019s life with a perspective on Hemmingway. Lifeson has some great guitar work with his solo. If you are going to write a ballad, this is the way to do it. Period. Finally, \u201cCountdown\u201d is designed full gear for commercial and video play, but I can\u2019t help but like it. It\u2019s an infectious song that musically and lyrically builds in symbolism and homage to the launch of a space shuttle. A bit cheesy? Yes, but also tasteful and well done. Sometimes it\u2019s good to remember that music should be fun. Oh\u2026 And it also has a great keyboard solo for those that can appreciate it. \n\nLight, the sound rolls and lifts in a well blended whole; there is a depth to this album that once played and released is actually quite good. The band is still rocking, moving with a fluid grace, it soars with the kind of spirit only these veterans can produce or get away with on such a style change. Lee\u2019s bass is still great and his solos work well, if anything his playing is more dominant herein. Peart\u2019s percussion is complex, at times subtle, but still the dominating rhythm machine. While Lifeson\u2019s leads are drowned out his solos are still great, his imprint is still working its magic as a multi-textured part of the whole. The arrangements are excellent, the group writing pieces of music that flow with grace, the production here melding the compositions into an artistic whole, sounds and textures ebbing and rising with a craftsman detail. Once you get by the keyboards and larger production, you see eight tracks that still move with their own integrity, all stories from the group\u2019s vision; composed and performed into a creative whole that shines with a gleam, making you believe for once that digital engineering can realize a musician\u2019s dream.\n",
        "\nFour more albums under their belts and Rush come forth with their second live set. Most of this being recorded on the Moving Pictures tour, with a little of previous tours tossed in as well. Out of the gate, the first thing to note is the song selection. Most of the songs are from the last four albums, with only two coming from before the previous live release All the World\u2019s a Stage. As those two songs were not included on the previous live album, that gives us songs never released live before. Making me not pay for more of the same material, only half a decade after the last live outing, is a good thing and gets big thumbs up to start. \n\nNext noticeable item is the lack of the Cygnus X-1 opuses. This is highly disappointing as this would be the first and best opportunity to have them combined on one album, and live no less. I understand that 30 minutes of music would probably take up to much space, but come on \u2013 It\u2019s a signature classic of this period, and they had edited it down on tour anyway. Perhaps it would have worked easier in the CD age, but what would have been the harm in an extra record? It\u2019s a minor complaint, but for me a wasted opportunity. \n\nMost important, the sound is odd if not a little sterile for a live release. The sound portrays some tinkering with the wonderful digital technology new at the time. The tracks have been lifted or diminished too much, and the live feeling is drained some in the process. Sad really, for it will be a while before these classics see the light of live daylight on an official release again. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the sound is of good quality, very polished in fact at times. That is the problem. This is a live recording and the sound is almost *too* polished; notable exception being \u201cThe Spirit of Radio\u201d, which sounds weird, struggling versus soaring as the opener. Rule #3 of live albums: Do not make a live album sound like a glorified studio album with crowd noise. This album runs close at times, but doesn\u2019t cross the line; notably because the production tried to have it both ways, which is probably why it failed. Quite the shame since the performances could easily stand on there own and shine without the listener questioning if the shine was due to liberal use of digital polish. \n\nAs stated, the performances themselves are good; the guys still masters of performing despite the layers of complexity exhibited on these songs. At the end of the day, these songs are live renditions of songs written by guys who love progressive music, played with the same sentiments for those who love progressive music. Highlights include: \u201cCloser to the Heart\u201d with the crowd singing along (making you wish you were there to join in); \u201cThe Trees\u201d comes with a well performed acoustic intro in \u201cBroon\u2019s Bane\u201d, courtesy of Lifeson; Peart\u2019s solo within \u201cYYZ\u201d still earns him the title of \u201cProfessor\u201d; \u201cXanadu\u201d still succeeds in being the musical masterpiece that it is; \u201cLe Villa Strangiato\u201d closes the album jamming out ten different ways from Sunday. Also of note is the solo work from all three, with their overall performances being outstanding and lifting the final score despite my complaint on the production.\n\nWhat you have here is a snap shot of the last part of Rush\u2019s golden era. There are some great performances here that should form an outstanding picture of this period, if not for the production. The end result is a release that lacks its full potential, almost relegating the album to a collectable for hard core fans. There are just too many later live releases with much of what is found here to make it a \u201cMust have\u201d. If you\u2019re a Rush fan, then you\u2019ll enjoy this, if for nothing else than to have the only live versions of \u201cRed Barchetta\u201d, \u201cBeneath, Between, and Behind\u201d, and \u201cJacob\u2019s Ladder\u201d. Otherwise, the casual Rush listener is better off picking up Different Stages or Rush in Rio to get 90% of what\u2019s on this album (plus a lot more music).\n",
        "\nThis is the album that defined the path that Rush would take in the decade to come. Adopting soon-to-be-drum-legend Neal Peart as percussionist and lyricist, Rush blended a fine progressive edge and memorable lyrics to their otherwise carefree 70's hard-rockin' sound and proceeded to alter the course of history. Fly by Night, though only a shadow of what would follow it, still stands as one of the band's defining albums and an easy favorite for fans of 70's classic rock and progressive. \n\nMost Rush fans are familiar with the easily recognizable though admittedly straightforward title track, but this album is considerably more diverse and intricate than that. Peart's influence is immediately apparent in the first minutes of \"Anthem,\" a complex and catchy tribute to the novel of the same name. Listen to this after say, \"Working Man,\" and hear the sheer difference in playing style from debut drummer John Rutsey. This is still Zep-influenced 70's rock for sure, but deeper and far more focused musically and lyrically. As good as Peart's drumming is, it is his lyrics that complement this the best, weaving tales of fantasy and personal reflection as a master poet would. Tales that are expertly sung by Lee and fantastically accompanied by Lifeson's much-improved guitarwork. \n\nThe song structures are just as diverse as the lyrics. The album starts off in typical Rush fashion with a few quick rockers that are just a tad too complex to be confused with songs off their self-titled debut. \"By-Tor and the Snow Dog\" is their first attempt at an epic and a good one at that, interplaying instruments, mood, and subtlety as potently as they would on A Farewell to Kings. Then there is the classic title track, which I'm happy to say still gets occasional radio airplay. The final tracks of the album shift towards the mellower end, letting Getty Lee show off his expressive side and Alex Lifeson show off some fantastic clean tones. All in all, it's as consistent as it is varied, with the only hints of cheese manifesting themselves in the 'battle' section of \"By-Tor\" in the form of some really weird vocal/sound effects (these are annoying as hell, though only amounting for a small portion of the total track). \n\nLike much of Rush's output, this is to be recommended, with the added weight of it being among their best works. Enjoy.\n",
        "\nIn a catalog of great releases, and a dynasty of innovative and epic moments, Moving Pictures enters the unsuspecting musical marketplace of the 80\u2019s and goes off like a shrapnel grenade, destroying the status quo, ripping apart perceptions, and shaking the foundation of rock. Only the blistering attack of 2112 operates at the same level, competing with this on its own terms. It\u2019s the kind of release that fires up fans, turns the heads of casual listeners, and earns the grumbled recognition of critics. Timeless and yet here in the now, this is the Rush album. Rush\u2019s discography is home to many a fine song, a number of which are better than what is found on this album, but no one album succeeds in being the complete package that isMoving Pictures.\n\nThe music is the most heavily guitar driven sound from the band, past or present. Not that this is heavy metal, for it is not, it is hard rock, but still distinct for its weighty axe work. The keyboards are still on there inevitable march towards dominance, but still a background player on this release. The percussion is the technical attack that only Peart can deliver, evolving herein to be so much more than and integral to the structure of the songs, yet never more than what is needed. Lee\u2019s bass work is officially the poster child of how to make the instrument relevant, being more than a member of the rhythm section. These two alone underscore the weakness of many others in this department, who think rhythm is nothing more than a necessary if formulaic participant in making a well crafted catchy tune; then failing to do with 100 percent effort what Peart and Lee do as an after thought. And Lifeson is all over this thing like a brilliant mad axe-man, chops cleaving a path for the ages. In a catalog of great guitar moments, past and present, here he sets the bar. The man is on fire with countless great solos, all works of art in their own right, his sound ranging from light to heavy but always passionate and intense. \n\n\u201cTom Sawyer\u201d is the inevitable focal point, the single that put the guys on the map, Rush\u2019s most recognized song amongst casual listeners. It\u2019s a great song, and a showcase of enough progressive elements in four minuets and thirty-seven seconds to send even the most hardened technical critic into progasms. It is also the most overplayed song in the group\u2019s discography, which is a shame. Second most overplayed song would be \u201cLimelight\u201d, with its introspection on the intrusion of success being cast over great driving guitar work (And one of the catchiest riffs from the band). Hopefully you haven\u2019t been oversaturated with these two to the point of tuning them out, for they are both excellent. And if you have been killed on these two, then at least check out \u201cLimelight\u201d again for Lifeson\u2019s solo (2:37). It is certainly one of his best. \n\nThe rest of the album is a roll call of great musical moments: \u201cRed Barchetta\u201d is an outright classic song, the story of a Sunday afternoon drive in a world were the automobile has been banned (Actually based on a story by author Richard S. Foster). The lyrics flow smoothly, the music rising and falling to portray the story with cinematic grace. This is how progressive music works on the highest order, when music and lyrics combine to give all the technical excellence a purpose. \u201cWitch Hunt\u201d explores the darker side of mob mentalities and musically represents the dark subject matter perfectly. Lifeson wields his guitar in evil strokes not seen elsewhere in the group\u2019s entire discography, his guitar melting into Peart\u2019s lyrics to the point of chills. \u201cYYZ\u201d competes with \u201cLa Villa Strangiato\u201d as best instrumental by the band, this one being more concise and driving than \u201cLa Villa\u201d but lacking the others gravitas at times. Notable fun fact for you guitar players, the riff pattern at the beginning is Morse code for those same letters. \n\nFinal song note, fans of epic songs will need to take in the \u201cCamera Eye\u201d, for it is the last of the longer Rush \u201cEpics\u201d. An eleven minute suite in two parts, the first representing New York, the other London, it is a flowing piece of cinematic musical magic. Much like this album it is a lush fusion of sounds, polished smooth into a purposeful whole, while still edgy enough to be driven by guitars. Lifeson brings home another great solo to end the piece as well. \n\nDon\u2019t let actual radio play and counter sales get in the way of giving this a spin, for this is a success despite such bravado. One of the few times that critics and platinum sales get it right, for once doing the job they were intended, for even a broken clock is still right twice a day after all. Simply put, this is one of the greatest hard rock albums to be etched into vinyl. For once, you can believe the hype.\n",
        "\nOn Permanent Waves, Rush enters the 80\u2019s and the beginning of a new musical direction, compiling what is in essence a transition album between their sound of the 70\u2019s and were they were going in the 80\u2019s. What results is s juxtaposing of elements seemingly opposed: Longer songs opposed to standard length tracks, lyrics that are conceptual metaphors versus succinct statements, outstanding axe work opposite keyboards, and bright musical landscapes rising above foreboding contemplations. But for all its opposing elements it still results in a fine emulsion of sound and content. \n\nThe actual tone of the album is darker when compared to the Rush catalog, hopeful moments taking on a grim conscience at times. The album starts out fired up with \u201cThe Spirit of Radio\u201d and progresses into moody, slower, contemplative pieces before ending on the conceptual \u201cNatural Science\u201d. Lyrically, it goes from the corruption of music, to facets of determinism, through the stately march of storms, into the exploration of strength in differences, to mankind as arrogant architect of a miniscule portion of what we know. A literal tour de force of philosophy, both complex and accessible (another of those opposing relationships). \n\nThankfully the music is lighter, but solid enough to carry the load. Lifeson moves through melodies, still a master of the guitar, at times holding off to the solos to breakout into cascading or simple passionate structures. Either form, he is still at the top of his game. Check out the solo in \u201cFreewill\u201d, it\u2019s a whirlwind free-for-all nestled within the songs complex composition. Peart seems subdued, but listen close and you will find a subtle technical conciseness holding up the entire structure, the man being more artist than percussion at times. Lee\u2019s shrieks are almost completely gone; his voice now flowing with the music while his bass work is on target. The band is tight as always, putting forth straight forward, radio friendly tunes and grand complex structures in one sitting. At times both even collide. Traditional sounds hang like a specter of the 70\u2019s interwoven with elements of the new, like a proud parent encouraging its offspring to open its wings and fly. A special note on the increase in keyboards for those who fear the new wave-synthesizer 80\u2019s; consternation is not warranted, for they are only background and a minor part of the albums sound. The guitar is still the hero of the band on this release.\n\nWhile not the full throttle piece de r\u00e9sistance as many Rush classics within their golden era (The first 8 full releases), and further overshadowed by being sandwiched between fan favorites \u201cHemispheres and Moving Pictures, this album is still solid, with great moments, and has much to offer in its own right. It\u2019s mostly remembered for radio friendly hits \u201cThe Spirit of Radio\u201d and \u201cFreewill\u201d, the last a bit overrated save for Lifeson\u2019s great solo work. \u201cEntre Nous\u201d should have made the radio and \u201cNatural Science\u201d now lives onstage for the great piece it is. \n\nPermanent Waves unique placement in the bands discography makes it a transition album between periods, but with the distance of time freezing these songs into a special place and sound of there own. Note that the band had three of the songs on their set list for their last tour, and that\u2019s half the album. From a catalog 17 releases deep! Take it from Lee, Lifeson, and Peart \u2013 This is worth a place in your collection.\n",
        "\nSometimes a picture really is far more descriptive than words. The cover of Rush\u2019s Grace Under Pressure, an expressive and eye-catching depiction of a figure staring off into the horizon, serves as a fine prelude to the album. This is a band looking to the future, a band focused on expression, and a band of complexity and subtlety. A band not easily defined by images or words. Refusing to accept the limits of their sound and songwriting, Rush continued the path they began carving with Signals for better or for worse, but most certainly without looking back.\n\nAnd though Grace Under Pressure is certainly softer than even Signals, I think the final product was more or less for the better. Again, don\u2019t confuse softer with simpler, as they\u2019re still pulling their weight, but whatever rough edges the band might have had before this have been smoothed and polished. Getty Lee sounds the best he\u2019s ever sounded vocally, while his playing is not a step below his level of ability on Hemispheres. Whereas many players will dumb down their playing when going for a simpler sound, Getty Lee is just as fantastic as ever. Same can be said for Neal Peart of course, whose ever-evolving technique and creativity continue to impress. The real surprise on this album is the greater role that Alex Lifeson plays on this album. His guitars are still used as a backing instrument, but he\u2019s quite audible (he was mixed out for a significant portion of Signals) and his playing is just as good as ever. Note however, that as the guitars are increased for this album, the synth presence is as well. The band\u2019s sound is completely saturated by the various effects and it\u2019s one of the primary reasons this album is mellower. But what it lacks in sheer rock \u2018n\u2019 roll bravado it makes up for in mood and atmosphere. Though Rush was always a band of hope, they can\u2019t help but cast a melancholic feeling throughout Grace Under Pressure, the only exception being the laid-back \u201cRed Lenses,\u201d which calls to mind some of the avant-garde King Crimson output in the 80\u2019s. This feeling holds up lyrically as well, with most songs expressing discontentment just a hint shy of despair. And it actually works really well, considering the mood of the songs themselves, with only the chorus of \u201cThe Body Electric\u201d calling to mind the band\u2019s sci-fi past in the cheesiest of ways (it\u2019s in binary, sigh). But overall, the new mood is versatile enough to be applied coherently throughout the album, resulting in another highly consistent release.\n\nAnd it is consistent, as all the songs have likeable qualities akin to the band\u2019s nature. But like all of their 80\u2019s albums, there may still be a listening curve for fans of the band\u2019s prog-era or those that aren\u2019t into albums of a mellow nature. Hopefully those for which this applies will be able to overcome their stigma and appreciate this. Otherwise, they\u2019ll just be leaving more to love for those of us that already do.\n",
        "\nAnd here it is - the end of an era. Take it all in, for herein finishes the run of Rush epics. For the third and final time, Rush pens a song that goes coast to coast and fills a side a vinyl, in this case the suite \u201cCygnus X-1 Book II: Hemispheres\u201d. As if to end this chapter in style, this song is part two to \u201cCygnus X-1 Book I: The Journey\u201d from A Farewell to Kings. \n\n\u201cHemispheres\u201d continues the journey of the hero from the last album, wherein the science fiction tale describes his ships journey to, and subsequent destruction by a black hole in the Cygnus constellation. Now we pick up the tale, as a fantasy, the hero arriving formless onto a land locked in an ancient civil war. One faction is Apollo, representing logic while the other is Dionysus, representing love; each forming in the great conflict a hemisphere, representing modern conventions on right/left hemispheres of brain function. This is a classic argument in science fiction, where logic and love is cast opposed and in conflict. From the vantage point of being an outsider he immediately sees the war for what it is, a house fighting against itself. The gods listen to him and fix their world by joining the two forces into one, thus the two hemispheres form a complete sphere; both interdependent to complete the world. \n\nThis suite runs in 6 parts. While not the opus that \u201c2112\u201d is, it is still solid. The music is mellowed out progressive rock, but innovative and good; the band tighter and at the top of their game. The lyrics tell a wonderful story, but too much at times as Lee seems pushed to keep up with everything that needs to be said. You will need to hear this a couple times to get everything. On the plus side this pushes Lee into new vocal territory with positive results. \n\nAnother song note, much has been made over \u201cThe Trees\u201d, a good song with debated lyrics; opinions range from comments on French/English relations in Canada to labor disputes in general. Peart claims the song was inspired by a cartoon and is about collectivism. To me, it seems to be an analogy about egalitarianism and the cost of enforced outcomes. Either way, it\u2019s quite a piece of music, so take a listen and decide for yourself. \n\n\u201cLa Villa Strangiato\u201d is the final track and another long piece. It is also the first Rush instrumental, and the guys go all out on it. Someone must have told them that instrumentals are the point in a concert where you ratchet things up to show off, advice obviously followed being subtitled \u201cAn Exercise in Self-Indulgence\u201d for a reason. The good news is that this does not come across as a meaningless exercise in needless musical-masturbation. It is a smooth run for over 9 minutes of musical greatness. And yes, for those who love the old Loony-Tunes, the riff at 5:49 and 8:03 is the \u201cAssembly Line\u201d music from many a great cartoon. \n\nAs the last chapter in this period of writing, Rush goes all out. The writing is over the top. The music is complex, smooth, and flowing, much care applied to the sound. Acoustics and electric guitars seemingly join into a lush production, layers of textures applied to give the sound depth. Peart continues to amaze, adding complements to his kit and being a technical master. Lee proves again that bass work is a full time member of the band, even getting a chance to show off eloquently on \u201cLa Villa\u201d. Lifeson is all over this like a kid in a candy store, enjoying every riff and carrying you along for the ride. The music hits its apex with the instrumental, the band putting an exclamation point on not only this album, and an era.\n\nProg fans will love this album - It has all the facets to make it succeed. Non-believers will find it difficult, side one encompassing 18 minutes that need to be treated as a whole; they will likely not have the patience to give this a few spins to peel back the layers and unlock its moments. Side two, while still painted by the broad brush of prog, is good solid hard rock and \u201cLa Villa Strangiato\u201d just owns no matter what kind of music you like.\n",
        "\nA Farewell to Kings heralds the next phase of Rush\u2019s discography, the band now free to explore its muse, 2112 putting the band firmly in the driver seat of their destiny. The new period of albums, culminating after three more releases in the live set Exit\u2026 Stage Left, is the journey of Rush stretching out from writing for the sake of performing into performing as writers. Writing, music and lyrics, become center stage as Rush starts its final foray into the progressive genre. The love of performing is not diminished; it\u2019s just no longer the obvious beachhead of their creative efforts. \n\n\u201cA Farwell to Kings\u201d opens up the album with a confident sound, but one that is firmly planted in rock. It\u2019s all good, but must be noted for those looking for another 2112. It\u2019s not going to happen. Rush has moved on from that album\u2019s tone into hard rock conceptual landscapes. Mid-paced and precise, \u201cKings\u201d explores society\u2019s ills from the historical perspective of future historians looking upon our times. What makes this interesting is that it does this in the form of a question. It\u2019s a great song, but the payoff for this is in the track \u201cCloser to the Heart\u201d, the well known hit from the album. This is where the band stretches into lyrical poetry, for not only is \u201cCloser to the Heart\u201d a philosophic/societal evaluation, but more importantly it\u2019s the counterpart to \u201cA Farewell to Kings\u201d, delivering the band\u2019s answer to the very questions the title track proposes.\n\nImportant song note is \u201cCygnus X-1 (Book One \u2013 The Voyage)\u201d. Another long piece, it begins the final foray of Rush into progressive epics. Clocking in at over 10 minutes, it is a Sci-Fi tale. This song is a bit odd in that it is only half complete (thus the subtitle); once you realize this is part of a bigger piece, being continued on the next release Hemispheres, it becomes more tangible. As a stand alone, it is some good music, but average as a whole and needs to be combined with \u201cHemispheres\u201d it takes on more depth. You would have though someone at the label at one point would have though of this and combined the two on a compilation. \n\nAll of this brilliant song writing aside, the real story is the standout masterpiece: \u201cXanadu\u201d; inspired by the Samuel Taylor Coleridge poem \u201cKubla Kahn\u201d, a name that should be recognized easily by most metalheads for \u201cRime of the Ancient Mariner\u201d. \u201cXanadu\u201d is a timeless piece of magical muse that transports the listener years away to another land, to \u201cDine on honeydew and drink the milk of paradise\u201d, for better or worse as will be seen! Lee\u2019s vocals describe this land, but the music is perfectly crafted to carry you there. It not only succeeds by not breaking the golden rule of long songs by not feeling long, but is just a brilliant piece. For me, this rises to join the level of all time classics. It\u2019s the perfect display of progressive rock, gorgeous layers of music portraying more to your senses than most films or pictures can do when handicapped the ability to provide a visual. \n\nThe band is tight and on target, conceptual, composing, layering constructs of depth making the listener wonder how three men managed the whole affair. Peart\u2019s percussion encompassing many new pieces of equipment, none used needlessly, reminding the listener there was an era that instruments served the purpose of the song versus the song serving the purpose of the instruments. Lifeson is literally full of life, ranging from concise acoustical work to outstanding axe work, his solos more than the music but not above it. Lee still proves the bass is a fulltime member of the band, being more than support, and even steps out on \u201cXanadu\u201d to play rhythm guitar. Lee\u2019s vocals have developed from his early patented shrieks, into many ranges, his voice now another instrument used to develop the tone of each song. \n\nA Farewell to Kings is a hidden gem of the catalog, forgotten by many due to time and distance, further lost in the shadow of being sandwiched between fan favorites 2112 and Hemispheres. But this stands well the test of time and is worth many a spin.\n",
        "\nIt must be stressed that Rush are not a metal band. Never have been, never will be. In fact, Rush are not on this site so much because they are metal as because all of progressive metal and most metal with epic or prog leanings (Iron Maiden, for instance) owe a huge debt to Rush. Rush can be fairly heavy at times, but if you want to throw the horns, you'd be better off buying a Dream Theater record. As of the release of Snakes and Arrows, Rush have been playing for almost forty years. Very, very few artists can boast of having performed for 40 years, and most stalwart bands eventually sink into utter mediocrity before fizzling out (Metallica, for instance). Snakes and Arrows marks the 18th studio album from Rush, among countless live albums, EPs, and compilations, and thousands of live shows. And, surprisingly, this latest offering from Rush is pretty damn good.\n\nI have previously listened to Rush's most recognized LPs, 2112 (1976), and Moving Pictures (1981), and was not terribly impressed with either of them, especially Moving Pictures, which has some of the worst synthesizer patches I have ever heard (not to really fault Geddy's synth playing, it's just that the sound sets he used were, to put it gently, poorly chosen). And, after hearing Snakes and Arrows, I daresay it's much better than their works from their supposed heyday. In their 50s, Rush humiliate musicians 30 years their juniors and stand alongside Dream Theater, Spock's Beard, and Porcupine Tree as stars of modern progressive music.\n\nOne striking feature of Snakes and Arrows is its organic and open feel. The production of Snakes and Arrows is truly beautiful, achieving a powerful, clear sound without overprocessing it to the point of sterility (see Dimmu Borgir for a particularly egregious example of sound engineering sucking the life out of music). Gone is the muddled, overcompressed sound of their previous album Vapor Trails (2003). Each instrument can be clearly picked out and followed.\n\nA slightly ominous tone pervades the album and shines through even despite Geddy Lee having such a voice that he could sing doom metal and make it sound happy. His 2112-era crotch-grabbing wail has been tempered greatly by aging and, in fact, he hits very few high notes. His singing is slightly tarnished by his fetish for multitracking, which doesn't quite work as well for him as it does for the infamous Norwegian one-man choir Kristoffer Rygg (Ulver, Arcturus). However, his bass playing remains as stellar as ever, and the smooth, refined tone of his bass may surprise metalheads who expect percussive, thumping, pummeling bass playing as heard in most modern metal bands.\n\nSubtlety, not flash, is the flavor of the day. While it has many technical moments (like the amazing instrumental \"The Main Monkey Business\", which stomps YYZ into the ground), this is not Liquid Tension Experiment or Spiral Architect. Rush succeeds on the strength of their songwriting, not masturbation, as is evident on the rip-roaring \"Far Cry\", which is incredibly fun to listen to.\n\nThe album branches through several musical directions, from near metal (the Dream Theater-ish Far Cry), to grooooooooovy acoustic folk rock (The Larger Bowl, whose title possibly refers to what you might want to smoke while listening to this song), and a nod to Rush's beginnings as Zeppelin-ish hard rock (Spindrift), to prog rock insanity (The Main Monkey Business). Despite the diversity, the songs have an overarching style and a strong feeling of continuity. \n\nSnakes and Arrows is not a return to the '70s sound and silver kimonos, but it is an excellent album all the same, and, in my opinion at least, it stands above their 70s work. The fact that Rush is a 40-year-old band and put something of this caliber out is just unbelievable, but hearing is believing.\n\nStandout tracks: Far Cry, The Main Monkey Business\n",
        "\nThe 70\u2019s saw the explosion of the live album upon the music scene, a relatively new concept in rock, but one that would immediately become popular. It made Kiss, as well as Frampton. Hell, it is the only thing Frampton is remembered for. Cheap Trick is better remembered today for  Live at Budokan than the pop they produced in the entire 80\u2019s. It was logical for Rush to follow suit. How could a band devoted to performing not do that? All the World\u2019s a Stage is a natural step in the bands discography, one they embraced so well they decided to release a live album every five releases there after until the millennium. \n\nThe production is the first thing to get your attention. It is good, clean, and portrays the band well. It gives you the feeling of being at the performance without any over-production nonsense that turns a live album into glorified greatest hits with crowd noise. The second thing that jumps out is the viability of the performances themselves. This is a band that knows how to play there instruments, meticulously able to recreate their studio releases live. Not very surprising for a band born of the seventies, but must be said due to the rabble that has soaked into the music landscape over the last 35 years; I\u2019m sure everyone has been burned at one time or another by a band that can\u2019t bring it live, making you realize how essential the producer and engineer are to many a groups success story; none of that here with Rush being the real deal, actual adding to their catalog. That is the true test of a live album. Does it add to their catalogue? Does it make you wish to see them live? Would you just rather listen to the studio version of these songs? God I wish the labels would ask those questions before releasing most live albums. \n\nAs an example, \u201cBastille Day\u201d ounce for ounce pounds out better than the original. Don\u2019t fret if you have put off the purchase of the murky depths of Caress of Steel, for you get \u201cBastille Day\u201d here arguably better. Let them eat cake indeed. Another example is \u201cSomething for Nothing\u201d. Lifeson is on fire through this, swinging his axe with a passion that projects how much he loves his chosen profession. I want to see him rip through this song, which means the live format succeeds. That\u2019s the kind of thing you look for in a live album. \n\n\u201c2112\u201d is played out in all is glory, not quite as awesome as the studio, but still a good time. Oddly, \u201cDiscovery\u201d and the \u201cOracle\u201d are both missing from the performance. I assume this is due to time constraints or something similar. Fans will have to wait 22 years for Different Stages to hear a full live performance of this immortal classic. \u201cSoliloquy\u201d, on the other hand is here and flat out better than the original, and that is saying a lot; simply beautiful. \n\n\u201cBy-Tor and the Snow Dog\u201d rocks out more than the studio, sacrificing a little progy precision for outright jamming, and that is not a bad thing when done right. This is done right. It finishes with the ambience of the original sounding more psychedelic, before jamming out to the finish. It\u2019s a great listen that makes the listener wish he was on hand to take in the waves of music washing over the crowd. \n\nAnother notable mention is \u201cWorking Man\u201d. Its great to hear the band bring this monster live, the listener treated to hearing Peart pound this out. Just Glorious. As a performance treat, the band breaks into \u201cFinding my Way\u201d in the middle, and also interrupts the attack with the professors drum solo. The band is tight and spot on bringing down this medley, wrapping up the album to an epic conclusion. Although the CD re-masters include the encore of \u201cWhat your Doing\u201d from the record. \n\nLive albums to many times come across as filler in a bands catalogue, more of an excuse to squeeze money out of an existing song; but there was a time when live meant new, exciting, and a measure of a bands success; a time when performers found success by the strength of a live release. When done right, it should act as a badge of honor. A right of passage from performer to artist as if the young apprentice was holding up his first masterpiece to the craftsmen of his trade. While sadly this is not always the case, the fact is Rush proves their right to join the ranks craftsmen. Part metal, hard rock, progressive, and out right jamming, All the World is a Stage is all of that. But at the end of the day it succeeds because it is the most important thing of all: A concert I wish I could have seen.\n",
        "\nWow, just wow! I didnt expect too much from this album, but I was sincerly blown away by how awesome it is. Maybe its just the fact that its their newest album, but for the moment, I consider it like their best album. Call me crazy, but that's how it is. Its THAT good!\n\nThere's everything on this album; Melodic instrumental songs, Typical Rush songs, epic songs, rockers and dark songs. The music sound pretty much like Vapor Trails(The pre-chorus from Far Cry for exemple sound a lot like the pre-chorus from Earthshine in style, but hey, that's not a bad thing at all!) and Rush's 3 other albums before, but more melodic, catchy and original. There's 3 intrumental songs on this album and the one called 'The Main Monkey Business' is simply brillant. Its filled with great riffs and really nice melodies that actually sound kind of like Maiden's typical cool melodies. The other instrumental songs are also very good, but not long enough, sadly(less than 3 minutes). The bass work is really cool like always and Geddy still show his awesome skills. The guitar work is really good and it never sound the same, there's a lot of experimentation and different techniques. The solos are your typical Lifeson's solos that sound really nice. There's some really great heavy riffs in there, but also some beautiful acoustic parts and even some jazz/blues sounding riffs. The drumming is really technical like always and really enjoyable. I don't tend to care much for drums, but the drums on this album is very memorable and I can't wait to hear the songs from this album performed live. Each songs are very memoraable and I seriously would love every songs to be performed live. The lyrics are typical Rush lyrics...In other words, really great and intelligent lyrics. Like every Rush albums, this is a grower, so if you don't like it too much at first just give it some more try and you will notice how good it is. Personally, after the first listen I was already hooked, but we never know.\n\nI highly recommend it! If you were disapointed by Vapor Trails like some people I know, don't worry, this album is 10 times better.\n\nBest songs: The Main Monkey Business, Spindrift(Dark!!), The Way The Wind Blows(cool heavy verse and catchy overall), Faithless(memorable chorus), Bravest Face(memorable chorus part 2) and Workin' Them Angel(memorable chorus part 3).\n\nLeast memorable songs: The last 3, but they are still great... Just not as good as the 10 other songs which are simply very hard to beat.\n\nI give it a rating of 100/100 because it just blew away! It always feels good when after years of music listenning experience you can still find some really good, original, memorable albums and that's what Snakes And Arrows is. A perfect album.\n",
        "\nCaress of Steel is probably the most panned album in Rush\u2019s discography. Nestled in between the classic Fly by Night and the absolute masterpiece that is 2112, Caress is often seen as underdeveloped and overextended, an album the band were not yet experienced enough to pull off properly. In many ways, this is absolutely true: Rush could have made this magnificent. But it\u2019s not terrible for what it is, that being a perplexing amalgam of 70\u2019s rock, prog, psychedelic, and folk that might just pleasantly surprise the hardcore fan of old-school Floyd, Tull, and Yes.\n\nThe first hurdle one has to clear to get into this album properly is the production. It\u2019s immediately evident after a few seconds that this is not as crisp and clear as the previous two albums were, but it does a nice job in making this thing sound absolutely ancient. There\u2019s something about a mustier sound that really adds to the fantasy element presented in the lyrics. But anyway, once you get used to it, you\u2019ll find that the band still sounds really good. Alex Lifeson does rip into some fantastic leads on here, but much of his playing on here is acoustic, which is where the folk influence really starts to show. Don\u2019t worry though, there\u2019s still plenty of hard rocking riffage, with his great pre-synth-era guitar tone. Also as expected, Getty Lee\u2019s voice is sublime through most of this, with maybe one or two high wails that he sounds like he\u2019s struggling to reach, and his bass playing is as superb as ever. And of course Neal Peart provides the ultimate rhythm section to every song on here, with a little screwing around in \u201cDidacts and Narpets.\u201d But the band\u2019s quality of performance is to be expected, as it\u2019s the songwriting that is the problem here, not the players. \n\nThe album starts off quite well, the first three songs of standard length and not sounding too far removed from Fly by Night material. \u201cBastille Day\u201d is a fantastic rocker with a marvelously catchy chorus, definitely one of the highlights for any Rush fan. \u201cI Think I\u2019m Going Bald\u201d is the last song to carry the spirit of their debut, rocking just as hard as any of those songs did. \u201cLakeside Park\u201d is refreshing and mellow and an easy shoe-in for second best song on here, with some of the album\u2019s more thoughtful lyrics. The album starts to unravel a bit with the epics that follow these. \u201cThe Necromancer\u201d has a lot of cool ideas rhythmically, but Peart\u2019s lyrical accompaniment is somewhat corny, especially the narration before each of the three parts. This detracts a bit from the song, which is a shame, as there are some pretty heavy passages. Album closer \u201cThe Fountain of Lamneth\u201d is even more epic, clocking in at over twenty minutes. Rush fans be wary: just because you love the 2112 Suite doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll be quick to embrace this metaphorical tale. This is the half of the album that will take the longest to grow on you, especially if you\u2019re not much for the brunt of 70\u2019s progressive music. I won\u2019t attempt to provide any lyrical interpretation, but the song itself is very dynamic, sweeping from soothing acoustic passages to Rush\u2019s traditional heavier soundscapes and everything in between. This is very Floydian at times relying heavily on mood and tone as the various parts flow through one another. But again, this is no 2112: the lyrics are a lot denser and deeply bathed in symbolism, while the transitions between chapters aren\u2019t nearly as fluid. Also notable: on the cassette version I have, \u201cDidacts and Narpets\u201d and \u201cI Think I\u2019m Going Bald\u201d are switched in the tracklist, showcasing the awkwardness of the former very early in the album and effectively destroying the complete flow of the final epic by the addition of the latter. This is almost exclusively fodder for the truest of prog fans, those that think Tales from Topographic Oceans is far more breathtaking than pretentious and/or those that think the Atom Heart Mother Suite is among that band\u2019s finest works.\n\nIn conclusion, my first impression of Caress of Steel, coming off a steady diet of Hemispheres, was decidedly negative, but the album has fast grown on me. Most of its problems are superficial, as the album is still effective in engrossing the listener in its symbolist realm. It\u2019s not necessarily a casual listen, but most rewarding albums tend not to be anyway.\n",
        "\nRUSH. Their debut\u2019s cover emulates the same simplicity and energy that Yes\u2019 debut did back in \u201869. Oddly enough, as that giant of a progressive rock band reached their peak, another giant was just starting to emerge. But Rush in 1974 was not the same Rush that had resurrected the progressive spirit at the end of the 70\u2019s and through the early 80\u2019s; rather, this was a band that had more in common with classic rock than with prog. This is Rush in a stripped-down, lighthearted rock \u2018n\u2019 roll format, that while certainly inferior to the masterpieces that would shortly follow it, has plenty of merit in its own right that fans of 70\u2019s music are certain to embrace.\n\nThis album shows Rush\u2019s influences more so than any other album they would go on to release. This is 70\u2019s rock without a doubt, like Led Zeppelin if they were better at their instruments with a twinge of AC/DC to add flavor. The songs are simple and catchy with solid performances from all the members. Alex Lifeson does a hell of a job channeling the energy of his predecessors, sporting the bluesy riffery of Jimmy Page, showcasing the heavier-than-thou guitar tone of Tony Iommi, and even calling to mind the soaring leadwork of David Gilmour from time to time, especially in \u201cHere Again.\u201d Getty Lee is just as phenomenal as always. While his playing is a bit simpler on this release, it still comes out strong on the recording. His vocals are solid as well, at times reminiscent of Robert Plant (undoubtedly one of the reasons this release often gets compared with Zeppelin). In fact, most of the songs are very Zeppelin-ish, consisting of straightforward classic heavy metal rhythms and catchy vocal lines, deviating only in the longer, bluesy \u201cHere Again.\u201d \n\nThe only real downside to this release is that it\u2019s the only album released before drum legend Neil Peart was in the band. Not that John Rutsey doesn\u2019t deliver a worthy performance on here (he does), but this release really suffers from the lack of Peart\u2019s lyrical contributions. Again, think rehashed 70\u2019s rock, with lots of \u201coooo baby\u2019s,\u201d \u201coh yeah\u2019s,\u201d and classic rock clich\u00e9s. \n\nFans of later Rush might have a hard time going back in time to get into this album. There\u2019s no deep philosophical exploration here, nor is there any extended epic tracks. Just a handful of fun, rocking tunes that still stand strong among the lot of popular early 70\u2019s rock. Some of this even overshadows Deep Purple in terms of sheer heaviness and it\u2019s definitely worth checking out if only to give \u201cWorking Man\u201d a couple of spins.\n",
        "\nThird time out and now Rush is out to complete the creative head dive into progressive rock. A hard working band at this point with Caress of Steel quickly following on the heels of Fly by Night in the same year, and overall their third album in only two years. \n\nSome of the Zeppelin influences can still be heard, but this release sees the real stretching of muse for the young band. Not only does this album contain another story piece in \u201cThe Necromancer\u201d, but a second such piece in \u201cThe Fountain of Lamneth\u201d that clocks in just shy of 20 minutes to become the first of three Rush epics to comprise an entire side of vinyl. \n\nThis release is a hit or miss affair that takes a number of spins to warm to, but still is not saved from the skip button at times. This is an album by prog lovers, for prog lovers, that loses everyone else within its metaphors and complexity; the band embracing their passion of progressive music, but at the cost of passion at times. Complexity and composition trumping some of the live hard rocking felt on the previous two releases. Notably the darkest album of the bands discography, the tone is deep with textures of cerebral engagement \u2013 Hookah not included. Simply put, if you like to band your head, there is only one track to even contemplate it on, the rest more suited to a mystics smoking room where stories of yore and metaphysics abound. \n\nThat being said, there is still much to find for the patient listener. The drumming is, of course, top notch and the guitars range from acoustics to heavy, while the lyrics run the gauntlet of philosophic to even a bit silly. \n\nThe album opens up in the opposite extreme from all such criticism however with the speed driven \u201cBastille Day\u201d, a great song with solid riffs, great percussive hammering, and lyrics wonderfully set to the French Revolution. In fact this classic would open many live shows for several tours. From here things downturn a bit to \u201cI Think I\u2019m going Bald\u201d and \u201cLakeside Park\u201d. Mid paced tunes that are decent but somewhat forgettable; \u201cBald\u201d being more of a band inside joke on guitarist Lifeson for his concern over his hair. Side one ends with the three part Necromancer, actually a bit of an adaptation of Lord of the Rings with creative literary license filing off the serial numbers. The necromancer in the tale is another name of Sauron, the travelers are the hobbits, while the hero is the return of By-Tor from the previous album to save the day. I do not know why he is a hero now. Its odd and I have yet to hear a reason or figure out why. The narration is oddly monotone requiring a bit of getting use to, but the song overall is good as the music succeeds in being deep and dark. Nice solo work in the second part shows Rush stretching their chops successfully, and the acoustic work in the final part works well to denote the hero winning. \u201cBy-Tor and the Snow Dog\u201d it is not, but still good stuff all around. \n\nBut the epic song pieces don\u2019t end there, as \u201cThe Fountain of Lamneth\u201d goes coast to coast on side two. Lyrically, the song is a deep philosophic journey of a man\u2019s life through the metaphor of him searching for the fountain of youth. This one comes in six parts. The whole affair falls short at times with some parts being better than others, as if the craft of writing the lyrics bogs down the music, stifling it under its weight. Not a bad piece of muse, but not great either, and at the end of the day a 20 minute epic that dominates half of a release needs to pull its weight better than that. \n\nThe odd man out for a great early discography, Caress of Steel requires a few spins to appreciate. You can see the growing pains and the direction the band is going. Despite some solid moments it fails as a follow up to the excellent Fly by Night. It is really an album for progressive fans; leaving non-believers a bit, dare I say it - Bored. If you like progressive rock, and can get a good price on it, test its murky waters yourself. You\u2019ll find some good songs worthy of making it part of your collection. If you don\u2019t like progressive, then you\u2019re better off moving past this release to clearer waters, and at some point a Rush compilation CD with Bastille Day on it.\n",
        "\nHere we are, four albums to date in a scant 2 years and Rush crashes upon the music masses with an opus of concussive proportions. The spirit of live rocking collides with progressive music, mixed with dual edged lyrics to burn in the crucible of one angry band, forging an opus in 2112. Within its scorched halls hangs hell bent guitar riffs that equally turn to soft acoustic passages. Lifeson is literally on fire with enough energy to personally scorch his share of the track into the vinyl. Awesome percussion as always, and not just drumming my friends; Peart continues to expand his kit. Not that it matters, as he\u2019s probably the only man alive that could take Lars\u2019 thrice damned trash cans and own Hammersmith. Lee\u2019s vocals move up and down, screaming and singing, with his base work perfectly marrying rhythm and riff into a masterwork weapon that destroys and heals with each stroke. \n\n\u201cWe've taken care of everything, the words you hear the songs you sing\u201d\n\nOpening up, the first song goes coast to coast to comprise all of side one (for those of us who still spin an album or two). \u201c2112\u201d is a story that pays creative tribute to the classic novel of Ayn Rand, Anthem. It portrays a totalitarian future of collectivist domination through art and media, individualism crushed by the spoon fed will of the people\u2019s \u201cRepresentatives\u201d \u2013 In this case priests. Fitting actually, as in real life, you can\u2019t see God, so his priests dictate \u201cHis will\u201d to you. So the secular equivalent would be the intangible \u201cWill of the people\u201d and the necessity of \u201cTheir will\u201d to be dictated by similar minions. \n\nInto this oppressive world comes a man who discovers a guitar buried in ancient ruins. He manages to create music with it and is delighted at what he has discovered. His excitement turns to horror as the priests react dismissive and angry at his discovery. They tell him that it is a \u201cToy\u201d of the past that caused the downfall of man, to forget it for it doesn\u2019t \u201cFit the plan\u201d, then promptly destroy the instrument. In other words, the individualism inherent in creating music with such an instrument is bad, for it is not of collective design. The \u201cPeople\u201d didn\u2019t do it, he did it himself. Only what they create is good. Finally, typically of what a dictator can\u2019t control, they destroy it. \n\nFrom here the man becomes depressed, as he dreams of other worlds. There, the people play the music he has heard and are free to \u201cLive and grow\u201d. Those people are revealed to be ancestors that fled this world when the current regime took control. The story turns dark as the man sees a world of freedom, realizing he can\u2019t go on pretending to live in this world where his reawakened self is being crushed. He escapes the system in the only way he knows, by committing suicide. The story ends with the return of the elder race to finally throw done the federation once and for all. \n\nBut that is not the real story of 2112. \n\n\u201cJust think of what my life might be, in a world like I have seen\u201d\n\nThe real story is about a band that just finished creating an album of deep progressive rock that received bad press. The critics were vicious in assailing Caress of Steel and overall reaction was poor, so poor the band named the ensuing tour the \u201cDown the Tubes Tour\u201d. This led to pressure from their record label to drop the \u201cpretentious\u201d stories and music, to return to the fun Zeppelin rock style of the self-titled debut. \n\nThis should sound familiar to any music fan, for it is the repeating story of all music. Any metal fan will recognize what carnage it can cause. It is the story of hair metal in the 80\u2019s, or the wholesale abandonment of metal in the 90\u2019s. The siren call of success over substance has led many a fine band to their demise. But for all of those times bands have played the game of the labels, selling out to go the route of artistic insignificance, or in the case of the 80\u2019s killing and burying metal six feet deep, this story ends different. \n\n \u201cAttention all planets of the Solar Federation. We have assumed control.\u201d \n\nRush didn\u2019t play the game. Instead, they got angry, deciding to go down in flames writing their own music instead of compromising, so they came out swinging at the label and critics with 2112. If you think about the story within \u201c2112\u201d, and the story of why the band wrote it, they are the one and the same. In fact, this is primarily why I laid out the whole story above, for you to see the comparison of art imitating life. An artist faces oppression by a power group that wants to force them into line, to play that groups game. But the artist refuses to play the game; they would rather lose on their own terms versus compromising their freedom. \u201c2112\u201d is a great story of a collectivist future, but a better story of the one time a band looked straight at a label and raised their middle finger with a hearty \u201cFuck You\u201d. But for Rush this wasn\u2019t suicide, but success. \n\nWhat about the music? How does music stack up? To put it simply, the song \u201c2112\u201d itself combines heavy riffs, great percussion, the intelligent lyrics of a good story, and straight out passion to create one of the greatest pieces of music to dominate a full side of vinyl. The lyrics tell a story, but the music tells and advances the story as well. Twenty minutes roars by and you will have hardly noticed. This is the signature Rush song and a piece of influential progressive goodness. If you listen to Caress of Steel then 2112 you can hear the difference - It\u2019s profound. 2112 has that extra passion behind it that drives the content forward. \n\nAfter the opus of \u201c2112\u201d the tracks return to earth and become a little more hit and miss. \u201cA Passage to Bangkok\u201d is an interesting conceptual hard rock piece that tells of the band touring the world to hit the prime drug spots. The music is good and thematically well representing the Far East journey described. Fun song actually, but the band probably enjoyed too much smoke on that one for the next song is \u201cThe Twilight Zone\u201d with its zany lyrics. Not a bad song, but doesn\u2019t bare the test of repeats well. Cute lyrics are like that sometimes, requiring space between listens so they don\u2019t crossover from cute to silly. \u201cTears\u201d sufferings from the skip button treatment also at times. It is as a moody slow ballad seemingly out of step with their entire discography. It\u2019s not a bad song, just slightly above average and my score is representative of this track, along with \u201cTwilight Zone\u201d dragging down the album down just a bit. \u201cLessons\u201d holds its own, being solid and a fine piece of music melding smooth acoustics and axe work, Lifeson channeling the Zepps again in his spotlight solo work. \n\nFinally, the album blazes to an end with another great piece in \u201cSomething for Nothing\u201d. After a nice intro, we see the control drop and the passion boil forth again to scorch the landscape, guitars crashing into Lee screaming more than the lyrics of a song, but the mission of the whole album: \u201cWhat you own is your own kingdom, what you do is your own glory\u201d. The lyrics say it all; with this song being an excellent piece in its own right as well as an exclamation point to a fantastic album. \n\nPart progressive, narrative, rock, science fiction, and metal, but in sum nothing but phenomenal. 2112 is this and more, for this is not so much a review as it is a clarion call to not let this album go unnoticed and its story forgotten. It\u2019s not a matter of whether this should be in your collection, but when.\n",
        "\nA somewhat awkward title with this being Rush\u2019s second release, but the title is in the content; for while the actual self-titled debut was a worthy album in its own right, it is not the style of muse that would become these godfathers of prog. This release is the first full step in that direction, with Fly by Night the unfurling of new drummer Neil Peart and the music that would define the band, and eventually a whole genre of metal. \n\nNeil Peart\u2019s introduction is seen in the sound of the drums and the content of the lyrics. Peart\u2019s vast literary background being quickly noticed and appreciated by both Lee and Lifeson who cared little for the job of lyricist. And the impact on content is noticeable, for the typical Zeppelin rock of the debut has been replaced by tales of Middle Earth, classic tales of good versus evil, and homage to the literary classic Anthem of Ayn Rand. The percussion is technical in a manner that emphasizes intricate precision versus simple beats or needless execution. The man would become known as \u201cThe Professor\u201d for justifiable reasons. \n\nThe music has also advanced from the debut, and while it is still hard rock, the style is steeped in the burgeoning form of progressive. At the time, this was represented by such bands as Yes or old Gabriel era Genesis, both group\u2019s inspirations of complexity to the band, but transformed herein into something heavier. Lifeson chops are on and his solo\u2019s strong and Lee continues to be a great bassist whose presence is not an after thought or plays second string to his vocal duties. \n\n\u201cAnthem\u201d begins and the guitar\u2019s crunch combined with the percussive precision heralds the new era of music. This song represents side one well with good chops, hard solos, and Lee\u2019s patented early shrieks. The name itself representing the short novel by Rand and in content a clarion call of individualism versus collective, charitable atrophy; the lyrics, \u201cLive for yourself - There's no one else more worth living for. Begging hands and bleeding hearts will only cry out for more\u201d is a long distance from \u201cBaby I\u2019m coming to get you.\u201d\n\n\u201cFly by Night\u201d headlines side two and is the better known song herein, a classic that still smuggles its way onto the airwaves to date. \u201cMaking Memories\u201d is an acoustic jam that was literally written while the trio was lost on the back roads of Indiana, and seems out of pace with latter material, but is a solid track and nicely changes up the albums tempo. Finally, \u201cIn the End\u201d threatens to continue the softer second side\u2019s persona into the finish but blisters open into anthems of catchy guitar riffs, the sum being a total of several guitar textures and fine \n\nSeemingly the odd man out, \u201cRivendell\u201d is a dreamy acoustic ballad of all things Tolkien. It is slow, and would probably work better with the same level of smoke inhaled by the artists performing it. More of a mood song and I sometimes hit the skip button. Same can be said of \u201cBest I Can\u201d, a holdover from the previous tour that falls short in moments. Neither is a bad song, just average. \n\nBut the true master piece and blue print of metal prog is self contained within \u201cBy-Tor and the Snow Dog\u201d. As \u201cWorking Man\u201d represented the self-titled debut\u2019s look at the future of Rush so does this masterpiece predict the groups direction to many signature classics to come, all while arguably being the first truly metal progressive piece to hit vinyl. Its 8:39 minutes are even broken into movements as if to slam the point home. Further, the song just kicks ass through all nine of Dente\u2019s cursed layers. \u201cBy-Tor\u201d is the story of an epic battle between good and evil in verse with the actual battle represented by instrumental axe work. This song does a rare feat in music and ends without seeming as long as it is, for it does not possess a dull or repetitive moment - It succeeds in captivating the listener and holding their interest. This is the ability of the lyrics, but more importantly the music itself to project a story from beginning to end, and makes Fly by Night worth picking up for this track alone. \n\nCollectors Factoid: For those who have the vinyl version, the chimes at the end of \u201cBy-Tor and the Snow Dog\u201d are actually imprinted into the groves at the end of side one, after the actual track and not the record proper. On older record players that don\u2019t automatically pick up the needle, this causes the chimes to continue forever until the record is manually stopped. \n\nThis album, while Rush\u2019s second release, is in reality the debut of Rush the progressive band and the first album to carry the modern line-up. It is a solid album with enough outstanding moments to call it a classic and a worthy addition to your collection.\n",
        "\nThe year is 1974 and so begins the carrier of progressive legends Rush, in what would become a discography celebrated for creating and inspire progressive metal. But before those days would come, this unknown Canadian band serving time hoping gigs in their van would release this self titled debut. Rush was originally released on the bands self-made Moon label after being rejected by the major labels. Irony considering this release would eventually become the largest selling debut in Canadian history. \n\nFirst of note is the absence of drummer and lyricist Neil Peart. The bands original drummer was Alex Lifeson\u2019s long time friend John Rutsey, who also \u201cwrote\u201d the lyrics for the songs. I quote that do to the fact the lyrics were always changing, leaving Lee in a position to sometimes just wing it on stage. By the time the debut was recorded, Rutsey failed to deliver the final lyrics, forcing Lee to recall all the lyrics he had performed live or just write new ones. To this, Rutsey had a dislike for heavy touring. Further, Lifeson and Lee wanted to pursue songs in a progressive/technical way which didn\u2019t settle well with the traditional rock persona of their drummer. With the group signing to Mercury and the U.S tour beginning Rutsey called it quits. Not that the drumming is bad, for they actually work well for the style of music presented. They just sound weak compared to later releases. Listen to All the Worlds a Stage to hear these songs with better drum work to see what I mean, including Peart\u2019s drum solo lovingly nestled into the middle of Working Man.\n\nHistory lesson aside, how does this album stack up to the massive discography of the godfathers of prog? Rush is an interesting amalgamation of hard rock and tantalizing hints of what was to come. And this is certainly hard rock with a large serving of Zeppelin love sans the acid moments. This is quite understandable in light of the fact the band wrote and performed these songs live over the five years leading to this release, creating classic hard rock designed to be performed in halls and bars from \u201869 to \u201874. \n\n\u201cFinding My Way\u201d opens up the album and already you know this is a different Rush. Lee\u2019s \u201cOh\u2019Yea\u201d, \u201cWhoa, babe I\u2019m coming to get you\u2026\u201d vocal puts you on notice. This is certainly not the lyrics of master muse Neal Peart. But the guitars kick and drag the listener along in a festival of riffs married to 70\u2019s guitar rock done damn well. This song, with the album, wares the test of time well with only a few moments of dated rock creeping into the mix, but overall certainly sounds less dated than the material the same group put out in the late 80\u2019s. \u201cNeed Some Love\u201d is atypical of several tracks (\u201cIn the Mood, \u201cTake a Friend\u201d) in giving the listener a fun romp through the toe-tapping of bar room hard rock. This is the nature of this album. It\u2019s got some good catchy riffs and for the astute listener deeper moments (The guitar work in \u201cHere Again\u201d), but at the end of the day this is rock, albeit heavier, and the kind of fun you have listening to tunes while having a drink at the bar. Not a bad thing, and certainly a lost art form in its own right, just surprising to associate with the group that wrote \u201cXanadu\u201d and \u201c2112\u201d. As far as that style of hard rock goes, this album bashed the competition. \n\n\n\nBut we are not done, as the album ends with the critical mass of \u201cWorking Man\u201d. In the epic story of Rush with this release being chapter one, \u201cWorking Man\u201d is the foreshadowing of what is to come. Essentially, this is heavy metal\u2019s answer to Styx\u2019s \u201cBlue Collar Man\u201d. \u201cWorking Man\u201d ignites the airwaves with a driving riff, pounding rhythms, and guitar solos married intricately and artistically in the key of heavy. Sorry to all of you 70\u2019s bar-rock bands, your groovy jam-tunes just became the artistic equivalent of children drawings hanging from the refrigerator. This song is the driving force that put Rush on the music map and still holds its own as a classic to this day. Assuming you don\u2019t happen to own one of the gazillion \u201cBest of\u2026\u201d compilations Rush has put out, this album\u2019s purchase is worth this song. \n\nLess identifiable at first, the real spirit captured in this album is the natural love the band has for playing live, and it shows in each song. This spirit would continue through the next three releases and reach its zenith with their first live release All the Worlds a Stage before conceptual structures and artistic composition would completely occupy the group\u2019s muse. But that is another review.\n\nIf you are not a fan of late 60\u2019s to 70\u2019s Zeppelin style hard rock, then you should just keep moving past this release. If you are looking for early prog, then you might want to check out everything Rush released after this album up to the early 80\u2019s. If you want a great 70\u2019s hard rock album then this is a worthy addition to your collection.\n",
        "\nRush have always been an odd band. They build rich, layered cityscapes with only three members. They have a libertarian philosopher for a drummer, and a beak-nosed shrieker for a bassist and singer. They have a guitarist whose cold, calculated genius merely backs up the sound created by the first two. And they invented prog metal as we know it today.\n\nGeddy Lee and Neil Peart really build the songs with their bass and drum lines, giving Rush a quality that few metal bands have \u2013 namely, that the bass is more interesting to listen to than the guitars. A few classic rock bands such as the Who and the Beatles have this quality, but in metal, the guitar is normally the main thing, while the bass only helps drive the point home.\n\nThe thing about their sound is that it\u2019s a very warm, inviting sound. They rock, time-change, and yes, play really fast, with a vitality that few other prog scientists or shred cyborgs have.\n\nPermanent Waves is their seventh album out of seventeen, and it is this stage in an artist\u2019s career where they usually first begin to drift and run out of ideas. Compare it to other prominent seventh albums. Never Say Die, Reload, or Cryptic Writings this ain\u2019t. Rush sounds like a young band still on their second album \u2013 in the stage of their career where they have the money to go out and make something truly amazing, but are still young and hungry enough to want to do so.\n\nThere are basically three pairs of songs on this album. The first pair is the album\u2019s two hits, \u201cSpirit of Radio\u201d and \u201cFreewill\u201d. \u201cSpirit of Radio\u201d is a happily humming tribute to\u2026well the radio, back when radio was worth a crap and Drowning Pool didn\u2019t exist. It\u2019s one of the times when Rush\u2019s \u201cprogginess\u201d and skill make their songs warmer and more happy. Not Dragonforce happy, mind you, but the kind of happy that evokes genuine joy, the kind of happy where you can hear the essence of life bouncing and shooting through the song. \u201cFreewill\u201d, on the other hand is a little darker and more uncertain of itself. Its lyrics struggle with an age-old question, but it seems very confident when the chorus comes around. After all the struggling with questions of fate on the verses, it\u2019s a welcome thing to hear Geddy state on that chorus \u201cI will choose the path that\u2019s clear/ I will choose free will\u201d.\n\nThe next pair of songs are the album\u2019s two epic nature stories. \u201cJacob\u2019s Ladder\u201d, a simple but poetic description of a thunderstorm (\u201cThunderheads are rumbling in a distant overture\u201d) starts out with a deceptively simple 11/8 pattern, a few talk/sung lyrics, and then the clouds close in. The stormy instrumental section stays, raining on your parade until a synth drone announces the parting of the clouds. It\u2019s a good song, but it is absolutely OWNED, as is everything else on this album, by its partner, the 9-minute epic \u201cNatural Science\u201d. The crowning moment on the whole album comes when the first chorus hits in all of its head-spinningly complex glory. And it\u2019s damn catchy, too. Then the track blasts into \u201cHyperspace\u201d, its \u201cmechanized world out of hand\u201d contrasting with the simplicity of \u201cTidal Pools\u201d. After an uncharacteristically awesome solo from Lifeson, the song finally brings it full circle with \u201cPermanent Waves\u201d. Its grand fanfare wraps the album up all nice and ties a bow on it.\n\nThere is one more song group. These are the more acoustic songs, \u201cEntre Nous\u201d and \u201cDifferent Strings\u201d. They are both tender semi-acoustic songs about how humans relate to each other. \u201cEntre Nous\u201d is more rockish and electric, but it slows down for a very cool acoustic chorus. \u201cDifferent Strings\u201d is more of a platform for Peart\u2019s lyrics, which are both instantly comprehendible and deep at the same time. It reminds you of one of those acoustic songs Led Zeppelin used to do, particularly \u201cThank You\u201d off of their second album.\n\nIf Rush is your thing, this album is highly recommended listening, despite its length. It\u2019s prog that you\u2019d actually listen to for fun, instead of admiring the fast playing or searching for the meaning of life in the lyrics. Is there anything wrong with that?\n",
        "\nRush is one of those bands that has always been there providing great music, surviving all the \u201cfly by night\u201d trends (no pun intended) and creating great music all along the way. Their viewpoint, articulated both in lyrical and musical form, is that any artist must strive to the absolute limit of his natural capabilities. This is articulated through their outlandish sound, a sound that is completely all their own, and one that is matched by a unique philosophical viewpoint.\n\nSome of the videos found on here give clues to the hidden meanings behind the complex lyrical metaphors that populate many of their earlier material. \u201cCloser to the Heart\u201d begins with two eyes surrounded by blackness looking out with pictures of various tyrannical figures such as Mao and Stalin, along with corrupt and despotic leaders of democracies such as John F. Kennedy, which articulates a sense of sarcasm in the words that all must know their place. It makes ask such basic philosophical questions such as \u201cWho decides what a person\u2019s place is? Or an entire nation of people for that matter.\u201d Likewise on the video for \u201cThe Trees\u201d the depiction of a mighty and magnificent oak stripped of its branches and its beauty is a clear metaphorical condemnation of the insidious ideals of collectivist/socialist demagogues and their mindless mobs of followers. But in between these powerful images you see something even more moving, the band itself at work on their instruments, which are the tools of their unique brand of craftsmanship. \n\nOther videos such as \u201cThe Big Money\u201d and \u201cMystic Rhythms\u201d do not have such powerful yet simplistic imagery, but instead feature the band with a more 80s oriented image, but not to the detriment of the song. Others such as \u201cSubdivisions\u201d do carry some imagery in the form of child outcasts seeking escape from reality in a video game, but again the imagery does not articulate an intellectual metaphor, but more bolster a point that is quite clear and simple in the music.\n\nIf nothing else, the contents of this DVD flow in the same manner a time machine would, taking us from the humble beginnings of a 70s Prog Rock band who had a dramatic influence on the heavy metal genre into a full blown 80s New Wave inspired band with the same sense of musicality and technical proficiency. Any consistent fan of the band will enjoy this collection, be it the serious moments or the more light hearted ones, they are all priceless and waiting for those who want to remember the older days of Rush\u2019s glorious and still active career.\n",
        "\nOne of the great oddities of music is the \u201cGreatest Hits\u201d albums, or \u201cBest Of\u201d type albums. Some are great (Alice in Chains\u2019 \u201cBest of the Box\u201d) other can be totally maligned and defeat the purpose of having one (Megadeth\u2019s \u201cBack to the Start\u201d may come to mind). \n\nBut fans of Rush need not worry, \u201cThe Spirit of Radio\u201d is one of the better ones out there. Why is one of the better ones? Well, most importantly, it goes in chronological order, a must for \u201cGreatest Hits\u201d albums. But besides that, it includes more than just the \u201chits\u201d it includes many songs that fans will appreciate too. Also, they stock the album with the best material, and not a few songs from each release.\n\nAlso, being that it is in chronological order, it is interesting to hear the changes that Rush incurred over 30 odd years, in less than an hour and a half. From Geddy Lee\u2019s vocals to the inclusion of more synthesizers, those changes can be heard throughout. \n\nBeing that this is a \u201cGreatest Hits\u201d all the songs are critical! But sometimes \u201cGreatest Hits\u201d include songs that may make people scratch their head, this has none! Though, it must be noted that \u201c2112\u201d is a shortened version, which is a bit of a letdown, but not a huge one, as it contains \u201cThe Temple of Syrinx\u201d, the best part of that song. So \u201cThe Spirit of Radio\u201d has no blunders in the track-listing department, despite the minor complaint.\n\nOverall, \u201cThe Spirit of Radio\u201d is a quality \u201cGreatest Hits\u201d album. It accomplishes what a \u201cGreatest Hits\u201d album should, it provides both new and old fans with a showcasing of their best material on a single disc. Also this has a ton of tracks, so its worthy of purchasing.\n",
        "\nEasily one of the highlights of Rush's three decade career, the quite successful Moving Pictures album displays the most cohesive fusion of their progressive rock roots and the atmospheric synthesizer layerings that would begin dominating the band's sound immediately after this album. Say what you will of their career afterwards, this album is a staple in the collections of progressive rock fans and contains some of the band's finest work to date. \n\nThe band themselves are at their prime here. Getty Lee generally refrains from utilizing his soaring falsetto, but his voice still sparkles with that timeless energy that hasn't faded since the first album. His bass sounds magnificent and his playing is as fluid as ever. Neal Peart always aims to please and he almost outdoes himself on this record. His drumwork is ever-changing and technically impressive, but his lyrics outshine his playing. Expressive poetry in motion that even the most intellectual of progressive acts today cannot top. This is the last album before Alex Lifeson would take a backseat in the mix, and listening to this album really makes you wonder why. His solos are fiery and his rhythm work is perfect, possibly his best performance on a Rush album up to date. But what is performance if the songwriting suffers? That's not even a point of consideration here, as the songwriting is just as outstanding as the musicianship. \n\nThe magic of \"Tom Sawyer\" rocks out as strong as it ever has, despite some wear from rock radio overplaying it. One of the first hit Rush tracks to be primarily synth and vocally driven, it sets a precedent for opening tracks on their next few albums. \"Red Barchetta\" still stands as one of their most moving numbers, with classic lyrics and incredible melody lines. \"Yyz\" is often used as a basis for comparison with modern prog instrumentals, simply because it's technical, it effectively showcases all aspects of the band's sound without showboating, and it's damned catchy. The only thing I can hold against this album is that it falters as it nears the end. The songs on the first half are so awesome that the second half pales in comparison. Not that these are bad songs; \"The Camera Eye\" is a great epic track. It's just that the album loses just enough momentum to render its ending far less memorable than its start. \n\nRegardless, this is essential as far as Rush albums go and a reasonable argument could be made to declare it the best. That'll likely be contested until the sun burns out, but you won't hear anybody calling this mediocre. Easily accesible to any progressive fan.\n",
        "\nRoll the Bones is a strange Rush album, mixing the synth driven elements of the band's 80's material with some newer elements, most notable in the Getty's vocal melodies and some of the song organization. Like Presto, this isn't a progressive rock album so much as it is a more pop-oriented album, but it still makes for a good listen now and again.\n\nAlex Lifeson continues to play a decisive role in band's post-Hold Your Fire sound. His rhythm work here is well crafted and his solos are fiery and passionate. The main focal point on any Rush album is still Geddy Lee, of course. His vocals don't go as high as they used to, but he still sings better than his contemporaries. His bass work is always relevant and continues to be a driving force in every song. I think Neal Peart's drumming has gotten even better since the previous albums, with even more progressivism audible in his very dynamic playing. Like most Rush albums, the instrumentation is spot on.\n\nWhere this album excels over the last few is the songwriting. The first plus is having Lifeson back in the mix, both figuratively and literally. It's nice to hear his guitar playing throughout rather than occasionally. The synths still play a big role, but have been toned down to allow a more even sound. The lyrics are generally memorable, except that notorious hip-hop part in the title track. Seriously, who the fuck came up with that section. That song would be the coolest track on the album (the synths are awesome and the chorus is quite catchy. Most of the songs are similar in mood, not quite up-tempo, but not dragging along either. \"Where's My Thing\" is the first instrumental written since \"YYZ,\" and it's quite worthy of the band's reputation. Otherwise, nothing that really stands out as exceptional or unbearable.\n\nAnd that's the only real problem with this album; that none of the individual songs are particularly mind-blowing. Rather than featuring some classics, what you get with Roll the Bones is a set of decent songs that show that Rush hasn't died off yet and isn't planning on it. Far from their best album (it's not even Presto-quality), it still makes for a welcome addition to any fan's collection.\n",
        "\nHaving split with long-time producer Terry Brown after Signals (who co-produced every album from Fly by Night to then), it was only a matter of time before Rush fell into the same pack as their peers, altogether abandoning progressive rock for the younger, hipper synth-pop of the 80\u2019s. Miraculously, Grace Under Pressure was still a really good effort, despite the overwhelming synthesizers. Power Windows wasn\u2019t bad, but you could see that the band\u2019s ideas were running thin. And then comes Hold Your Fire, which is the musical equivalent of the band bending over and receiving a major shafting from the sound of the era.\n\nThe sound on Hold Your Fire, while realistically a natural evolution from their other 80\u2019s albums, is Rush at their most fragile and innocuous. The New Age leanings that were perceptible on their previous few releases are in full swing here: the result is an album that is soft, commercially appealing, and utterly devoid of the things that make Rush worth listening to. Where is the hard-riffed, technically astonishing rock outfit that tossed literarily brilliant epics in the face of skeptical critics and came out on top? Not here my friends. Here we have an aging band trying to recapture the acclaim of youth by doing things entirely different than they would have then. Alex Lifeson\u2019s guitar hasn\u2019t been a focal point on an album since 1981\u2019s Moving Pictures. Think he couldn\u2019t be utilized any less? Here\u2019s he might as well not even been in the studio. He spends the duration of the album competing against the heavy synthesizer for supreme backing instrument that you\u2019ll barely hear beneath the bass and vocals. Of course Geddy Lee fans can rejoice over this: the bass is everything. Even on this, the band\u2019s mellowest album, Lee\u2019s bass is still punchy and wonderful. His vocals are nothing special, though fans of his later, more expressive singing may enjoy it. Peart\u2019s drumming isn\u2019t particularly special either, as he concentrates more on being textural than anything else. This includes utilizing a lot of auxiliary percussive gimmickry, the kind that your New Wave types were synthesizing anyway. And speaking of synthesizers, they\u2019re actually a little less persistent on this record. Not that they aren\u2019t everywhere (they are), it\u2019s just that they\u2019re not as overwhelming as say, the fucking bass guitar. Yes, Geddy is good, but did Steve Harris mix this album or what?\n\nSo as for the songs, there aren\u2019t even any highlights. The more energetic numbers of \u201cForce Ten\u201d and \u201cPrime Mover\u201d are the closest to past Rush rockers, while \u201cTime Stand Still\u201d has certain niceties to it. But otherwise the songs stick to the basic formula. Straightforward, unremarkable, non-progressive, bass-heavy, synth-heavy, pop-rockers that drone along for a few minutes longer than any of them should, occasionally featuring a castrated Lifeson solo. That\u2019s the base recipe for a Hold Your Fire song, topped off with pretentious, pseudo-spiritual fluff for lyrical content. Sounds delicious.\n\nI know a couple of Rush fans who really dig this album, so there\u2019s no guarantee that you\u2019ll hate it. But I\u2019m certainly not afraid to say that it sucks, so I will. Hold Your Fire sucks. You like Rush? Well you better like them a hell of a lot before you spend a penny on this one.\n",
        "\nWith Permanent Waves and Moving Pictures, Rush entered the 80's strong, incorporating more synthesizer layers without missing a beat or compromising their style. With Signals, Rush took their new soundscapes even further. Getty Lee's synth work was no longer just another instrument, but one of the primary elements of their songwriting. Not allowing themselves to be confined by preconceived notions of their sound, the band were able to create another classic, one of expression and melody on par with their earlier works, but of an entirely different dynamic. \n\nThis album is considerably mellow, even more so than their previous two efforts, but Rush's energy is not spent. The rhythm section that made the band famous is still intact, only now topped with the constant synth presence. Fans of the band's back catalogue will also notice that there isn't any more epic songs on here; rather, the band has chosen to focus on shorter, more straightforward compositions. But don't miscontrue shorter for simpler: these songs are just as intricate as ever, though perhaps a bit more familiar to the average listener structurally. There's also a notable sense of minimalism in the synth work. Though there's rarely a moment without some sort of pad effects, they are never applied more than necessary. The drums and bass still shine through as much as ever and Getty Lee's vocals, while toned down, compliment the music better than ever. \n\nThe only real question raised is this: what the hell is Alex Lifeson doing? Because honestly, through much of the recording, I'm not exactly sure. For whatever reason, possibly to favor the increased synth usage, his guitar is mixed somewhat low. Accompanied with the lighter tone he uses on the album, it makes him diffiicult to hear for most of the album. His solos still come through, but even these are toned back a bit, a shame considering how good he is. \n\nBut the diminished presence of Lifeson is the only hindrance to this album. This is one of the few Rush albums where every song is of a consistently high quality. Thoughtful lyrics touching more on natural science than science fiction grace every song here, as well as some experimental elements, namely that of reggae-like passages. Check out some of those mellow parts in \"Chemistry\" and \"Digital Man\" to see what I mean. Cool stuff, and a definite progression from earlier works. \n\nAltogether, Signals is a fine album, certainly worthy of the Rush name. Fans of their older material (Prog-era) might have an initial hangup, but this album will certainly grow to be a favorite. \n\nHighlights: \"Subdivisions,\" \"Chemistry,\" \"Digital Man,\"\n",
        "\n2112 marked the beginning of Rush's golden period, with a nice stretch of some of the band's best material to date. Their progressive experimentation on that album continues onto the masterful A Farewell to Kings, a solid combination of epics and classics that remains one of their best releases to this day. \n\nThe album begins with the title track, a generally rocking tune with an awesome acoustic intro. I'm pretty sure that Neal Peart has written just about all of Rush's lyrics since he joined the band. I'm not going to assume it for the sake of accuracy, but regardless, the lyrics on this album are phenomenal from beginning to end, as immediately apparent on the title track. Afterwards is the epic \"Xanadu,\" based on the famous incomplete poem by Samuel Taylor Coleridge (the other famous Coleridge piece \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\" would be the subject of an epic of the same name by the mighty Iron Maiden). \"Xanadu\" is amazing and atmospheric, almost not seeming eleven minutes in length. The hit single \"Closer to the Heart\" is next and it deserves the attention it gets. It's just a great song. \"Cinderella Man\" is another solid rocker, though not as good as the title track. \"Madrigal\" is a mellow change of pace and not at all out of place here. The final track is the second epic, the science fiction based \"Cygnus X-1\". It doesn't top \"Xanadu,\" but it's impressive to say the least. Overall, not a bad song in the bunch. \n\nGetty Lee's voice is in top form here. His inimitable falsetto is powerful and expressive, and his bass playing is intricate. Neal Peart proves his drumming prowess throughout the album, with a lot of auxiliary percussion cycled in and out. Alex Lifeson's playing generally takes the back seat to the other two, but his playing here is incredibly effective and his solos are top notch. So overall, not a weak performance from anybody. \n\nAs far as Rush albums go, it doesn't get a whole lot better than this. Sure it's not their best work, that honor would go to 2112, Permanent Waves, or Moving Pictures, depending on who you asked, but it's a high level representation of the band's skill, progressiveness, and creativity. And really, what more can you want from a band?\n",
        "\nThough Rush had already put out some good material, it was with 2112 that they singlehandedly became the most influential progressive rock/metal band of all time. Without this album, or more specifically without the epic title track, we would not have the masterful progressive metal epics that we have today. No \"A Change of Seasons.\" No \"Divine Wings of Tragedy.\" Sure, Yes put out some truly epic tracks, but the majority of these were overly artsy and notably pretentious. Jethro Tull had the mighty \"Thick as a Brick,\" which is twice as long as \"2112,\" but it was more folk rock based than metal. Somehow Rush created the perfect epic: impressive concept, flawless execution, and solid production. And unlike Yes, Rush manages to keep it interesting for its entire length. It takes a bit of time to grow on you if you're not used to listening to songs over 5-6 minutes in length (in this case over 20) but is an amazing musical experience once you've grown to appreciate it. \n\nThe concept is grand indeed. 2112 is a stirring tale of an individual's struggle against conformity, backed by some of the band's best songwriting. Riff cohesion is beautiful, all the themes are memorable, the vocal lines are catchy as hell, and the band plays phenomenally. The sign of a good epic is that it seems shorter than it is, and the 2112 Suite certainly fits the criteria. Though the other reviewers have celebrated this quite adequately, let me just add that it is indeed as good as it's hyped up to be. \n\nBut while the title track is over half the album's length and its primary focus, it's not the only song here. The other five songs generally get disregarded as filler, but I think that's an unfair judgment. Had they been on a less epic Rush release, they'd probably be more liked. Regardless, they're all solid songs. \"A Passage to Bangkok,\" \"Lessons,\" and \"Something for Nothing\" are all solid rockers, each with its own redeeming qualities. \"The Twilight Zone\" is a little mellower, but quite cool. In my opinion, the best of the 'other' songs is the ballad, \"Tears.\" Getty Lee's voice is absolutely sublime and incredibly emotive. The chorus chord progression is brilliant and the synth involvement makes it that much more touching. One of the best ballads I've heard on any album. \n\nThis really is a masterful album. It's powerful, expressive, and far more than memorable: the 2112 finale will stick with you for a long time. Definitely a record worth owning and listening to repeatedly.\n",
        "\nI think it\u2019s extremely difficult as well as dangerous for a relatively new fan of Rush to make a review on any of their albums, especially if the album just happens to be \"2112\". So the only reason I\u2019m attempting this, is because I\u2019m hoping it will reach people who have not yet heard of Rush's music or who are in the very beginning of this magnificent musical journey.\n\nWhat is really great about Rush is that each one of their early works consists of few songs. And I mean as few as five or six pieces of music per album(even four in the case of \u201cHemispheres\u201d). With so little in an album you really have no excuse but to really spend some quality time listening to their stuff. \n\nIn my humble opinion, what you get in \u201c2112\u201d is Rush at a turning point in their artistic career. And it happens to be so, simply because this is the first progressive album of the threesome, entailing however a lot of hard rock elements, that are most evident in their previous recordings (\u201cFly by Night\u201d & \u201cCaress of Steel\u201d). In other words in this album we have the ideal combination of Rush\u2019s dual musical personality of the 1970s which lies between hard rock and progressive rock. From the next album, \u201cA Farewell to Kings\u201d and on, Rush is a band that enthusiastically further expands and builds on its progressive nature.\n\nThe album starts with perhaps Rush\u2019s ultimate epic, \u201c2112\u201d. The song lasts over 20 minutes and as soon as it finishes it is guaranteed that you will want to hear it again. As in all Rush epics, it consists of several smaller songs with one single lyrical theme and with the mood dramatically changing as one part finishes and another begins. The remaining five songs are all between 3 to 4 minutes long. \u201cA Passage to Bangkok\u201d is perhaps the most bad-ass song in the album and has the meanest riff! It\u2019s an upbeat song with a strong heavy rock, almost metal feeling. \u201cThe Twilight Zone\u201d is a great composition with amazing tempo shifts and a nice feeling to it (especially the guitar solo in the end). \u201cLessons\u201d has more of an alternative rock vibe to it, starting of with acoustic guitars. Again an up beat tempo song with a positive attitude. \u201cTears\u201d is the ballad for Rush in this album. Acoustic guitar parts can be heard here as well. The song\u2019s best part is definitely its chorus where Lee\u2019s voice is full of emotion. \u201cSomething for Nothing\u201d is the ideal ending to a perfect album. The song is literally built on the astonishing bass lines of \u201cMaster\u201d Lee with a great deal of help coming from Peart, whose drumming on this one is enjoyable as well as impressive. \n\nAll members are beyond doubt experts in their instruments. Geddy Lee (one of Cliff Burton\u2019s major influences) provides a solid foundation for the music with his amazing low end frequency upon which Alex Lifeson\u2019s riffs and solos are built naturally. Neil Peart is probably the greatest drummer in progressive rock music. He plays anything from simple rhythms, to extremely fast patterns (especially when it comes to fills). His ability in changing tempos and time shifts really adds to the progressive flavor of the album, while his fills are plainly inspiring (you can easily see where drummers like Mike Portnoy draw influences from). As for Lee\u2019s vocals I think that his high notes are phenomenal and a perfect match for the music. I cannot think of him signing in any other way in these 1970s Rush releases and especially in \u201c2112\u201d.\n\nIn conclusion in my opinion, \u201c2112\u201d is the best album of Rush and thus a must have for any fan of progressive rock/metal. It\u2019s the ultimate classic from a band which throughout their career but especially during the 1970s wrote and produced records of the highest quality and value.\n",
        "\nFor those of with an anecdotal knowledge of Rush\u2019s long and illustrious career producing high-IQ progressive metal cum rock, this review might be a touch disconcerting. Because before they adopted the style of long, complex, thoughtful, technically advanced and technologically enhanced rock, Rush were a power trio nearly as hoary as Mountain, Cactus or good old Led Zeppelin. \n\n\nYup, on their self-titled debut, the Canuck trio let loose with Sabbath like brooding (\u201cWorking Man\u201d) up-tempo blues stencils (\u201cWhat You\u2019re Doing\u201d) and just plain old basic hard rock (\u201cFinding My Way\u201d). This is not to say that this material is better than the band\u2019s later work, but it\u2019s most assuredly more in step with what\u2019s bands of their ilk were pursuing back in the day. And they do a damn good job of it to boot. Geddy Lee, sounding for all the world like Budgie\u2019s front-man Burke Shelley, lets loose a horny, highly out of character performance on lustful cuts like \u201cIn The Mood,\u201d while Alex Liefson provides his usual economic guitar support. Even in this potentially show-off friendly matrix, Alex hangs back most of the time, offering competent though hardly overstated solos performed with a conservative amount of effects. \n\n\nDrummer John Rutsey would be evicted after this album, allowing the arrival of the far more technical and cerebral Neil Peart. And shock, surprise, that\u2019s where the Rush tale diverts from bawdy roughneck rock to intellectual progressive mucking about. But here in sainted \u201974, Rush were just looking to rock out and party. Just like the rest of us, man.\n",
        "\nRush's MOVING PICTURES is a brief trip but an amazing one. The band for the most part broke free of the big epic pieces with this album's prequel PERMANENT WAVES and this one, but songcraft is king on the album. Synthesizers work their way in, but not as many as on the band's other 80s albums like SIGNALS. The overall sound is one of pure musicianship and technical skill, but one that still captures the ear with catchiness. This album also spawned three hit radio singles, which is incredible, since there are only seven total songs. \n\n1. Tom Sawyer- The band's biggest hit starts off the album. Drum god Neil Peart steps it back a notch to give Geddy Lee's bass, keyboard, and vocals the spotlight, while Lifeson plays a convincingly enough classic rock guitar, even when he isn't programmed for such a categorization. The lyric is the tale of a character who is every bit a rebel as the true Tom Sawyer, hence the title. \n\n2. Red Barchetta- This song is quite the interesting one. The soundtrack is light, airy, Blind Guardian-inspiring, and downright poppy, but the lyrics are a surreal, government-stabbing horror story of how in the future we will be so programmed by the powers that be that the car will be outlawed, and simply driving one will be a terrible crime. There may be no monsters, ghouls, or witches, but make no mistake: this is modern-day horror. Neil proves how he can explore the human mind and discover what worries us most, and this is some of his best work this side of 2112.\n\n3. YYZ- The band's quintessential instrumental takes its spot as a daring track three. It starts as a bit of a scale exercise aided by the precision drumming of Peart, but we see that the twisted minds behind Rush have made is something so much more. The guitarwork is insane, and the miniature bass solos throughout are enough to send Steve Harris and Geezer Butler into the fetal position. The listener soon discovers that the overall purpose of this bustling four-and-a-half minuter is Rush proving that they are the most tight-knit and technically skilled unit ever to grace our headphones, speakers, and music collections.\n\n4. Limelight- This hit song takes its place as my favorite on the album (though it is just about impossible to truly choose just one). The intro guitar riff is Alex in full-on rock star mode, legs spread into a power stance and eyes intent on his destiny. What makes this song so cool is that all this rock starriness is abandoned come solo time, which combines elements of progressive rock, classic rock, metal, progressive metal (his forte), reggae, and jazz. This sort of uncategorizability is what truly categorizes Rush, not just Lifeson. The lyric is Neil being artsy again, suggesting that all the world is a stage and we are merely each another's audience. He also writes a classic rock staple: the tale of a band who just has it too damn good. So good, in fact, that living in the limelight becomes a burden. All these things melt together to create the greatest hit the band has recorded, and certainly this album's best song.\n\n5. The Camera Eye- While the band may have sworn off epics, this ten minute song begs to differ. The synthesizers that would appear more throughout the first half of the 80s Rush records appear in the most abundance here of anywhere on the album. The band also reuse an element from the great big conceptual pieces of their 70s work, that being dividing a long song into parts. The song may be long, but it has purpose. It won't go down as one of their great epics, but don't write it off as bad. That would be wrong of you.\n\n6. Witch Hunt- Alex Lifeson again displays his versatility and variety by playing some of the most doomy and sinister guitar ever to fall from a 1981 guitar, and pretty damn convincing too. This song is the first in a reverse order series called \"Fear\". The lyrics showcase political and humane horror as does track two, this time in a more understandable, mainstream, and less deep way: the witch hunts of Salem in the colonial times. The lyrics point out just how horrible mankind can be if he puts his mind to it. 'Tis a theme that ne'er fails, and helps us all feel a little better about ourselves, if not giving us a long hard look in the mirror.\n\n7. Vital Signs- This was the band's \"last minute\" song for this album, something they had on every album, said they in Martin Popoff's CONTENTS UNDER PRESSURE: 30 YEARS OF RUSH AT HOME AND AWAY, a book that I would strongly recommend to absolutely any Rush fan. But as with most all of these last-minute Rush songs, it sounds anything but rushed. The lyrical artfulness of Neil is too high for even me to decode, save for the fairly universal line: \"Everybody got to elevate from the norm.\", one that Geddy repeats extremely well throughout the song's winding down. Keyboards reappear in nearly the abundance of The Camera Eye, but never are turned away due to Geddy's masterful and modest use of them. No one should complain about this as a closer, either. It fits where they put it.\n",
        "\nRUSH- GRACE UNDER PRESSURE\n\nThe first of my top three reviews is for an album by a band that are very special to me. Special, that is, in a different sense than the two bands who rank above them, because they paved the way for those bands\u2019 very existence. Canada\u2019s Rush, in the mid-1970s, invented progressive metal. They fused the sounds of early metal bands like Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple with the sound of British progressive rock in the vein of Genesis and King Crimson, effectively creating my favorite genre. My favorite album of this band is one that came out ten years into their career, Grace Under Pressure. Rush fans and n00bs alike have accused me of having poor taste in Rush, maybe because Grace could be thought of as the sequel to its precursor, Signals, because both albums tend to be dominated by keyboards, but further listens should reveal that this is an entirely different kind of animal, perhaps the most bestial metal experience Rush released from 1984 to the present, save for Vapor Trails. \n\nSince this is also a thread about your three favorite bands, this demands a bit of background. I got into Rush when I was a wee lad of ten or eleven, listening to classic rock radio and hearing songs like \u201cTom Sawyer\u201d and \u201cFly by Night\u201d. It took until two years later, when I finally got into metal, to buy my first record of them, Moving Pictures. It was an album that demanded your full attention, and that intrigued me. I was a prog nut before I even realized what prog was, and I was interested by the weird time signatures and experimental use of instruments. Rush meant much to me in my formative years, and they remain high on my favorite band list.\n\nAnd so commences the review of the album, song by song.\n\n1. Distant Early Warning- The album kicks off on a fresh and positive note, and the guitars and synthesizers are more or less evenly distributed in the production. That delicate balance is struck time and time again on the album, which is one of the reasons it is my favorite from Rush. Lyrically, Neil is at the height of his game, weaving a tale that can be taken as metaphoric for the Cold War tension of the time (Leonard Roberto, author of A Simple Kind Mirror, argues that Grace is a concept album about the East-West conflict). Geddy Lee\u2019s voice is truly great on this song and the album in general. This is a vocal from a short-lived era (roughly 1984-1991) during which he no longer utilized his shriek, nor had his voice begun to wither away. On an album full of gems, it\u2019s hard to say which one is my favorite, but this one just may take the prize.\n\n2. Afterimage- This is a highly personal song. A friend of Geddy and of the band died in an accident during the sessions for the album, and he was immortalized in lyrics that read as a eulogy. Geddy recalls talking and drinking in the misty dawn, and skiing fast through the woods with this stranger to the fanbase but beloved friend to the band. Alex Lifeson, guitar god, steals the show on this, with his tasteful fills during the verses and equally tasteful take on an atmospheric interlude. The song is all in all a classic, and was probably my favorite one on the album on my first listen to the album.\n\n3. Red Sector A- Wow. If you want to shed a tear listening to Rush, go for this song. It isn\u2019t a ballad, but it evokes twice the emotion of any power ballad you could name. Geddy\u2019s parents were both Holocaust survivors, and this song is a brutal description of the horrors which occurred during those years. The imagery is powerful, referring to \u201cragged lines of ragged gray\u201d and depicting \u201cskeletons, they shuffle away\u201d. As a personal crusader of teaching the lessons of the Holocaust and acquaintance of one of the Mengele survivors, this song truly touches the core of my soul. Musically, dreary minor chords dominate, and there is heavy synth use. The instrumental sections do just what music should, it conveys the message of the lyrics just as powerfully as the lyrics themselves. This song is another classic. \n\n4. The Enemy Within- This is Part One, therefore the last song (Rush can count backwards because they have more money than you), of the \u201cFear Trilogy\u201d. The listener, after listening to a song about bereavement and a song about the Holocaust, needs this song. It picks up with a happy rhythm, and has a generally enjoyable vibe to it. The album\u2019s title probably comes from this song (that and Rush\u2019s high opinion of themselves ), featuring the line \u201cI\u2019m not giving in to security under pressure.\u201d The Fear Trilogy ends on a high note and the song is a wonderful way to end side one of the vinyl of the year, 1984.\n\n5. The Body Electric- Kudos to Walt Whitman for writing \u201cI Sing the Body Electric\u201d and inspiring Neil Peart to write another technology-based song (the other great one has a twenty-one and a twelve somewhere in it). This is the story of an escaped humanoid trying to reprogram himself in the \u201chot desert sun\u201d. If you\u2019re curious, Geddy sounds very good in binary code. S.O.S. \n\n6. Kid Gloves- Ignore the very stupid title and get to the actual lyrics (well, except the part that rephrases the very stupid title). You\u2019ll realize that Peart is sort of penning a sequel to \u201cSubdivisions\u201d. The guitar is the showcased instrument (Except for the drums. I only haven\u2019t mentioned those because every single Rush song showcases the drums. Neil can\u2019t help it.). Alex plays an aggressive staccato riff and segues right into the powerful vocals that Geddy belts out over sustained chords and truly metal riffage. Rush were such forerunners. You can sense the Dream Theater itching to get out in songs like these. \n\n7. Red Lenses- If there\u2019s a song that could possibly be linked to the Red Scare/Cold War/Communist theory that Mr. Roberto came up with, it is this song. Opening directly with Geddy singing, \u201cI see red\u201d, this song seems to be a jaundiced look at the fear that was spreading the western hemisphere, and had been since the \u201850s. Perhaps he is wagging an accusing finger, perhaps he was joining in the fear. It\u2019s quite hard to tell. But children, beware, there may be Soviets hiding under your bed, according to this song. The song is, again, awfully metal, disproving the uneducated horses who try to accuse Rush of abusing keyboards on this album. This is the album\u2019s weak link, to be certain, but that doesn\u2019t keep it from being an incredible song.\n\n8. Between the Wheels- Sure, it\u2019s keyboard-dominated, but this dreary showcase of skills is a perfect closer for a perfect album. If you want to see it in it\u2019s most incredible version yet, buy the R30 DVD. Geddy\u2019s vocals aren\u2019t as good, but Alex sounds great on it. The nihilistic theme reemerges, saying that the way mankind is headed, we could see \u201cAnother war, another wasteland, another lost generation.\u201d The song clocks in just under six minutes, and is fittingly epic for its length (the longest on the album, though it seems quite short). The soloing is downright insane during the instrumental section. Geddy\u2019s vocals on the chorus sound great too, especially the last time around. I can hardly explain just how good this song is. You may find yourself listening to it several times in a row without cease. Buy the album.\n\nDo I have to tell you? 100%.\n",
        "\nVery, very nearly there. Rush's prog flirtings would soon properly come to fruitition but they still had a hurdle or two to get over. This is one of the least popular 70s albums, and admittedly probably is one of the weakest, but that's not saying much seeing as at this time Rush were still owning left, right and centre.\n\nThese ones get slated by prog fans for their unwillingness to let go their hard rock roots, but this kicks off in fine fashion. \"Bastille Day\" was used to open their live shows with for years after this album was released and it's not hard to see why. It's an uptempo rocker that makes full use of the band's synergy and developing songwriting abilities. It maximises the turbulence of revolution into an almost epic structure with stellar instrumentation throughout.\n\n\"I Think I'm Going Bald\" is the last gasp of the first album's heavy Zeppelin inspiration and as such isn't bad. It's Rush after all and it's funny to see this laid back and simple structure get set upon by Neil Peart, who brings strange OTT moments to it. \"Lakeside Park\" is really relaxed and breezy with it's gentle acoustic guitar lines and Geddy's carefree vocals. This one moves about the place in complicated Rush fashion but it's subtle and the feel is never lost within the changes.\n\n\"The Necromancer\", in three parts, is probably their most flaccid attempt at an epic. Each section is musically fine but shockingly unmemorable as a whole. It's underwhelming placed next to the might of \"2112\" and the cheesy narration really kills it off. \"The Fountain of Lamneth\" follows with twice as many parts and being almost twice as long (very nearly a whooping 20 minutes!) to boot. It's much better than the previous but lacks the natural flow from one part to the next that \"2112\" perfected. Now, both really were in essence 6 and 7 little songs plastered together, but \"2112\" just felt right in it's moves from one to the next and even felt, if abstractly, like it was a perfect whole. They explore their British symphonic prog fixations a bit further here, and the Yes-isms are loud and proud. They never forget to break out the hard rocking groove and I can't fault any of the performance. It's just very tame in comparison to what they'd let loose in the next few years. That said, \"Panacea\" and \"Bacchus Plateau\" are the highlights of 6 parts that move between light and dark moments very often.\n\nGeddy once said of this period: \"You could just smell the hash oil coming off us\" or something like that. Well I don't know if they were taking too much or too little but this album could might have benefitted one way or the other.\n",
        "\nRush have had a immensely successful career for a three man prog band from Toronto. Over the years the prog rockers have released a string of spectacular albums to the delight of their fans. Rush's career has spaned over thirty years. Countless brilliant albums have been released over these thirty glorious years including \"Fly by Night\", \"2112\", \"Moving Pictures\" and \"Signals\" to name a few. With this in mind, Rush could easily make several compilations to showcase their talent from various eras. They took advantage of this with \"Retrospective I\".\n\n\"Retrospective I\" covers all the of Rush's work from 1974-1980. This means, only material from the self titled album to \"Permanent Waves\" is included on this compilation. The 1990 compilation \"Chronicles\" had to cover every Rush album up to that date so it was bound to miss a couple essential tracks but with \"Retrospective I\", it can focus on only one decade. This compilation demonstrates the brilliance of Rush with songs like \"Xanadu\", \"Bastille Day\", \"La Villa Strangiato\" and \"2112 Overture/The Temple Of Syrinx\". These songs showcase Rush's great lyrics and ability to produce some of the best progressive music around. The great songs don't stop there, \"Retrospective I\" also has the best, catchiest and most popular Rush songs like \"The Spirit Of Radio\", \"Closer To The Heart\", \"Fly By Night\" and \"Anthem\". This compilation has everything.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Retrospective I\" is more for new fans so they can get properly introduced to the band, while the die hard fans would go with the more complete compilation in \"Chronicles\". This compilation could have been a little bit better maybe if there would have been the inclusion of one or two live tracks but that is nothing to fuss about. \"Retrospective I\" demonstrates the three geniuses who call themselves Rush at their best by featuring their legendary work in songs like \"The Trees\", \"Something For Nothing\", \"Finding My Way\" and \"Freewill\". All and all, a great introduction point.\n",
        "\nI only gave this 95 because this was on loan from a co-worker and I didn't get to watch the easter eggs--if I had, then the rating might've been higher. That aside, this is an amazing document of a triumphant performance by the Canadian rock masters in a country they'd never played in before, under frightening and potentially dangerous weather conditions (it was pouring rain at a monsoon level, nearly). And they pulled it off as only they can. \n\nAs the title of the review implies, the audience in this is positively insane! They sing along with every word, every note of music, even during the instrumental interludes! The crowd shots show all of them dancing, singing, going absolutely wild in a way rarely seen in America at concerts, at least in such a positive and non-destructive fashion. They show intense appreciation for the band as they perform an involving set of material spanning literally their entire career. Geddy comes right out and says early on they're going to play as much music as possible to make up for their never having been to Brazil in the past, and they deliver the goods as only they can.\n\nThe band is in their usual top form, and Alex' soloing in particular is fabulous, equal turns virtuosic, emotional, tender, and raging. He also goes through about a dozen different guitars in the course of the concert, electric and acoustic! What an underrated player he is. He also gets to show an aspect of Rush not known to most--their loopy sense of humor as he introduces the band and incorporates a silly scat-singing bit into the routine to make it much more amusing than usual. \"This is jazz...jazz is WEIRD!!\" Geddy being introduced as \"The Boy From Ipanema\" and obligingly playing a snippet of \"The Girl From Ipanema\" on the bass is very funny!\n\nNeil Peart is up to his customary deity-like standard and his solo spot, \"O Baterista\", alone is an amazing display of drumming at its most musical and coherent--no mindless pounding here. Most drum solos are just that, frantic and mindless pounding that is ultimately aimless. He ends up playing with an entire big band orchestra thanks to modern technology at the end and it has an effect like no other. \n\nGeddy, well, he is all over the stage when not pinned behind his keyboards and dancing on his bass pedals, and his vocals seem not to have changed at all since the 70s. He is not straining at all, it's still there and perfect. And his bass rings out loud and clear, unlike most concert settings where it is drowned out. They play with the same enthusiasm they had as young men and it is wonderful to see them obviously having as much fun as they are onstage.\n\nThe sound of the DVD is flawless, if a little muddy at very first given the weather conditions, but it clears up quickly. The picture is excellent also and the camera angles and work overall are quite creative and well-edited. The music is top-notch and even the songs I wasn't that familiar with I ended up enjoying very much. \n\nThese veterans delivered under nightmarish conditions and proved themselves the pros they are in front of a total of roughly 120,000 people in those Brazilian dates. Salute them and buy this DVD for the ultimate rock concert experience!\n",
        "\nOne thing I've noticed through my experiences listening to Rush albums (with the exception of their usually amazing live releases), is that they fall under one of two categories (or both): (1) They have some great songs or a great epic but are quite weak besides that, or (2) They are perfect in every way except length. This release falls under the latter...\n\nOverview: This was a pre-sytnh era Rush album and my favorite at that! Probably their most balanced album as far as long, progged out songs mixed with short catchy tunes is concerned. Faster tunes and slower ones are also another point of balance. The flow of this record is just amazing. Warm sound, tons of unconventional instruments, and brilliant lyrics make this a classic. Not a bad song on it.\n\nTrack-by-track:\n\n1. [A Farewell to Kings] Strong, strong opener. The mood is first set with a soothing acoustic classical guitar piece that is eventually joined in with some bells and ambient nature noises. Then come the opening thud and following mid-tempo section. Eventually this picks up with a cool little riff accompanied by some master percussion work. The song remains at this tempo until you reach the almost head banging chorus with the accents on the up beats. Geddys vocals reach a high point (in the literal sense) in this little ditty. The solos show off the entire band. As it closes it slows down a bit, taking it down a notch for the next song.\n\n2. [Xanadu] Here comes the first epic! This one starts VERY quiet. The most dominant sounds being a wood block arrangement by Mr. Peart. This one accelerates musically but then hits a stop before the slower vocal section comes in. Chill as hell, and truly sets the stage for the rest of the song. The verses are fast and riddled with stops where Geddys vocals are allowed to soar. Strange thing about this song is: for what it is (a long prog-rock song) it's quite simple as far as song format is concerned. It's mostly a verse chorus type thing. Yet somehow, Rush makes it not boring, and before you know it the song is over.\n\n3. [Closer to the Heart] The radio hit. This is a sort of a \"peace&love\" type tune that you can really sing along to. Starts with an infamous acoustic guitar riff that is joined by vocals and then drums and bass. Pop-length songs might seem weak most of the time, but after hearing the serious opening track and epic second track, this is quite welcome. Simple lyrics, simple music, simple and short solos. Very uplifting, very good.\n\n4. [Cinderella Man] Mid-tempo song with slower chorus. Another simple but good song. Especially appropriate for those of us still feeling the after-effects of Xanadu, haha. This picks it up a bit, but is not too much of a jump from \"Closer to the Heart\". Lyrically lovely and subtly good musicianship go hand-in-hand and make this song as good as it is.\n\n5. [Madrigal] My only gripe with the album. Now would be the time to start picking things up again, but instead we take a step back and get a song even slower than the previous two! A simple love song that is very slow and almost too simple even for a ballad. Fortunately it doesn't last for long and we soon get what we were waiting for...\n\n6. [Cyngus X-1 Book 1-The Voyage Prologue] And here's the second epic (as if you couldn't tell from the name)! We get a surprisingly eerie intro with some futuristic-sounding noises and a deep, alien-like voice speaking in the background. After a while of this, a funky bass line kicks in and an equally laid back guitar and drums join in. The vocals that soon join in go from laid back to much louder, as does the music. After a short while of this, we get some good headbanging bits, and then the next part comes in.\nThis one is a bit more up-beat and happy, a HUGE jump from the last part. A big instrumental section comes after this and eventually we hit the chaotic section that leaves us hanging (until part two that is...)\n",
        "\nMost bands do their best work within their earliest recordings, when the passion burns hottest and the music flows most freely. Most bands, however, are not tinkering away in isolation on a type of music never (or only circuitously) heard previously. Rush did not really manage to capture the elusive essence of their sound until their fourth record and even then took an additional two records to inch their way to the creative zenith of the early 80\u2019s. No, Rush has no Sad Wings of Destiny or Ride the Lightning to shake the collective consciousness of the music world and even their first convincing testament to progressive metal (2112) is often a shaky affair. But in spite of the lack of a real lightning rod, watershed album it is still worthwhile to take a look at the murky meanderings on Rush\u2019s first three platters and specifically here on A Caress of Steel.\n\nMore so than the bouncier and generally lighter Fly By Night, A Caress of Steel can make a case as the first progressive metal LP. It would be difficult to call an album with one twenty minute track comprising side two anything but progressive and the metal quotient is certainly quite respectable, but this bares little resemblance to the prog metal of today. The album is quite jammy and certainly in a technical headspace, but its more of the pastoral 60\u2019s drenched sound of Jethro Tull or The Moody Blues crossed with the chops of Yes, and perhaps with a touch of Procol Harem\u2019s class and The Who\u2019s wild heart. However, there are certain elements of the core sound that are present here, as well as paths that have since become weed-choked and overgrown from disuse. The acoustic passages on this album are positively ethereal, folksy and often melancholic. The subtle shading here is above and beyond the scope of the great majority of bashers who would follow outside of freak mutations such as Opeth, and here they are allowed to dominate. I\u2019d conservatively estimate that half of Caress is acoustic. Rush would later cultivate these magical musics and integrate it more smoothly with the rest of their sound; here the about-faces seem downright amateurish at times.\n\nThe metal here is thumping and enthusiastic, utterly 70\u2019s in sound. You wouldn\u2019t guess that the riffic pyrotechnics of 2112 were immediately forthcoming by listening to Caress because everything here is low-slung and Sabbatherian. \u201cBastille Day\u201d does brisk business, but lacks the Purple flavour that signifies speed metal heritage, and \u201cI Think I\u2019m Going Bald\u201d is no more (and no less!) than dirty blues played loud, distorted, and half-cocked. But look ye at the second part of \u201cThe Necromancer\u201d (\u201cUnder the Shadow\u201d) and savour the death-shrouded Zep-improving trick-flipping funk metal, the raw and raspy Geddy vocal, the bass-driven groove riff. When Alex cranks the guitar on that sucker, it\u2019s as mosh worthy as any riff of the early 70\u2019s. The stop-start timing of that tight riffset is impressive, but what follows is more so. Sabbath fastbreak section with a total neoclassical shred solo o\u2019er top around the seven and a half minute mark that leads into a brief neckwrecking riff at 8:30. Pause the CD. Rewind that riff. Hardest riff in metal as of 1975? Were it longer the likes of \u201cSymptom of the Universe\u201d would quake in their boots.\n\nSo, why 69/100? Well, quite frankly, Rush just aren\u2019t good enough to get everything right yet. \u201cThe Necromancer\u201d which consists of awesome psych-y space rock (\u201cInto the Darkness\u201d), crushing metal (\u201cUnder the Shadow\u201d), and uplifting Wishbone Ash-style acoustic rock (\u201cReturn of the Prince\u201d) manages to shoot itself right in the foot by including a good two minutes of NARRATION by some guy who sounds like he\u2019s been smoking pot since roughly 1968. This dope is outright gutbusting to people who don\u2019t know the album and the number one cause of strokes for people who try to take this thing seriously. There are three interludes wherein the \u2018plot\u2019 is explained for us, completely breaking the flow of the piece and eternally maiming what should have been an evergreen Rush classic. And try not to laugh when Geddy starts yowling about Prince By-Tor. My lord.\n\nThe song construction is incredibly bizarre to boot. There are two drum solos here that burst out of nowhere (one is actually titled, \u201cDidacts and Narpets\u201d) and sound like crap because the bass drum sounds totally hollow. And good luck listening to \u201cFountain of Lamneth\u201d is one sitting. There are a number of good-to-excellent parts such as \u201cIn the Valley\u201d and the sublime \u201cNo One at the Bridge\u201d which manages to capture a feel not unlike what Priest achieved on much of the Sad Wings LP. And that solo\u2026 my God. But while I\u2019m thanking you for that, I must confess God\u2026 those long mellow acoustic sections are damnably hard to keep straight. There isn\u2019t enough variation here, and worse, \u201cLakeside Park\u201d and \u201cThe Necromancer\u201d also contain similar acoustic sections. All this adds up to is a lot of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. It feels like a sin to condemn the music box-like beauty of \u201cPanacea\u201d as I listen to it now, but will I remember it an hour from now? Sadly, the answer is no.\n\nIn short, A Caress of Steel is a curiosity for Rush fans, and those few of you here who have an affection for 60\u2019s folk and progressive rock. A beautiful, crafted, and surprisingly farsighted curiosity at times\u2026 but a curio nonetheless.\n\nStand-Outs: \u201cUnder the Shadow\u201d, \u201cNo One at the Bridge\u201d, \u201cI Think I\u2019m Going Bald\u201d\n[Note: Generally I take songs like \u201cFountain of Lamneth\u201d as one song, but here I\u2019d be recommending more than half of the album with my standard three-song stand-out list, so I went sectional. So there.]\n\n[Note the Second: Check out the liners for the CD reissue. Are those lyrics impossible to read or what? Reprinting the original jacket is fine, but bump up that font-size damn you!]\n",
        "\nEver since I started listening to Rush, I've is superior to its much-heralded successor, 'Moving Pictures'. I like that album a lot, too, but 'Permanent Waves' just seems more consistent overall. Additionally, the concluding song on MP, \"Vital Signs\", just might be the LAMEST song Rush ever recorded. Besides being the very first album to come out in 1980 (!!), it marked another first for the band as well: No longer was their work about side-long epics with sci-fi themes. This album saw the band mixing their brand of prog-rock with radio-friendly tunes. There, I said it! Radio-friendly. Yet, for those songs' relative accessibility, they rock hard and are still flawlessly composed.\n\nThe disc opens up with the pair of radio hits I was alluding to above, \"The Spirit of Radio\" and \"Freewill\". The former has an upbeat melody but, oddly enough, contains lyrics that lament the state of radio at that time. Evidently, besides being a drum wunderkind and one of the most literate lyricists in all of rock, Neil Peart was also a prophet. I was too young to remember what was played on the radio back in those days, but Peart somehow knew just how polluted and filth-ridden the FM waves have become as of late. The latter delivers exactly what it promises: a song that underlines the importance of making your own decisions. One of my favorite lyrics makes an appearance in the chorus, when Geddy sings: \"If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice\". Alex plays a cool solo after the second chorus. Despite being easier-listening, these two songs have enough time changes to keep the listener engaged.\n\nEvery great album's gotta have an epic, and \"Jacob's Ladder\" is the first of two. Fans of the band's earlier work should greatly enjoy this one. My favorite parts include the instrumental section which is in 5/4 time and later on a spacey part featuring Alex cranking out a convoluted riff in 13/8 (which is one of his finest moments as a guitarist), complimented by Neil's uber-precise percussive work and Geddy's eerie synth-playing. Clocking in at around 7 1/2 minutes, this song is sustenance for the ears. Up next is the quasi-ballad \"Entre Nous\". The reason I use the prefix quasi- is because Peart eschews sappiness in favor of profundity, yet the song is a tad on the light side. In any case, I have no gripes about the song.\n\n\"Different Strings\" is a very atmospheric track and is even softer than \"Entre Nous\". Replete with great lyrics and beautiful synthesizer accompaniment, this is a nice lead-in to the final track, the 9+ minute \"Natural Science\". WOW, and I thought \"Jacob's Ladder\" kicked ass. If this is not the greatest song Rush has ever recorded, it is almost certainly in the top five. A song about the environment and divided into three movements, proceedings start with the sound of ripples in the water, followed by some nice melodic singing from Geddy and acoustic guitar work by Alex. Then things kick into high gear. For all the precise musicianship, this tune never sacrifices memorability. Neils drumming in this song isn't just virtuoso--it's OBSCENE. I have encountered professional drummers who have thrown fits after trying (in vain, of course) to play Neil's parts. The sounds of waves crashing against the shore stamp finality on the album.\n\nThe fact that this album contains only six tracks does not hold it back much, if at all. My sincere wish is that Rush return to making epic songs on new albums like they did on this record and those previous. It is a pleasure to listen to and review albums like this. 'Permanent Waves' should be in your collection regardless of what kind of metal you fancy; it's that damn good.\n",
        "\nI like this album, but I could totally see any random Rush fan trying to forget it. They went for a more streamlined sound, definitely more poppy than before. This may or may not be a good thing with most bands, but Rush injects enough of their own sound to make it sound interesting. Although Geddy has definitely calmed down over the years, and his vocals have gone from a black metal shriek to semi-emo vocals, they\u2019re not that bad on this re-cord.\n\nOn Test For Echo, I really despised most of the songs because they were completely in-distinguishable, and mostly did not carry the Rush signature sound we all know and love. It just never clicked with me, and even the \u201chit\u201d Driven is just average work for Rush. Counterparts provides a slightly more relaxed, less strained version of that sound, and with some well-needed hooks added, it is actually quite a listenable record.\n\nThe album starts out with the bass and drum driven track Animate, which is really free in its composition, and shows a more smooth, less jarring side of Rush. Most of the time Rush tries to put some odd time signature in the song to make it more interesting, which works sometimes (Distant Early Warning), and fails horribly other times (Tom Sawyer, who needs to hear that descending riff a million times?). Animate is very streamlined, and pretty much all in 4:4, making for a decidedly easier listen.\n\nStick it out, the second track, is kind of goofy, and I\u2019m sure they had fun writing these ridiculous lyrics. The way it\u2019s provided through a counterplay between different Geddy vocals in the chorus, and slow grind during the verses, is semi-interesting, but I would not pick this song as the better song, although the riff under the chorus is undeniably metal.\n\nCut To The Chase is not bad, it has the same easy feel of the first song, and the lyrics are a little less random than Stick it Out. The counterpoint between bass and guitar is fun, and makes the song move nicely. Geddy actually sounds genuinely serious on this song, which he has failed at in the past, often ridiculing himself. There are some irritating pop tricks like repeated background vocals and random keyboards to add to the \u201catmosphere\u201d, but they\u2019re not overpoweringly annoying.\n\nNobody\u2019s Hero is a really great short epic, with Geddy\u2019s more serious voice showing through well. Alex winks back at his past solo style in a short burst of overdriven solo after the first chorus. The song is mostly acoustic guitar and bass though, and this works very well. It\u2019s not overly long, and the riffs are very tasteful for the lyrics. This song is definitely a highlight of the album\n\nBetween Sun and Moon returns Geddy to his solo album vocals. I address his vocals a lot in this review, as they easily take the foreground on this album. The instrumentation, al-though still talented, has nothing on the earlier ultra-wank Rush. The songs are written more for the songs than for Geddy\u2019s bass fills or Neil\u2019s Buddy Rich imitations. This song is a pretty good example of it. Although there are some show-offs from Neil, it\u2019s pretty basic. Hearing Geddy Lee play a straight eighth bass line almost makes you think he\u2019s tired of playing ridiculous fills.\n\nAlien Shore is a lot of fun. It has kind of an arena rock sound to it, without resorting to cock rock. The two songs that follow (The Speed of Love and Double Agent) actually kind of follow a similar formula in this, except for the random spoken part in Double Agent. Rush doesn\u2019t really put a whole lot of effort into making these songs unique, but they\u2019re still a bunch of fun to listen to. Keys are sparse, but present. Bass is easily the loudest non-vocal instrument, and the drums are appropriate, with Alex easily having the lowest volume, as he has had for the entirety of the 80s.\n\nLeave That Thing Alone is one of those Rush instrumentals that doesn\u2019t resort to too much wanking, and concentrates mostly on atmosphere. They basically take the middle keyboard section of YYZ and extend it, with some new parts added. This fits into the al-bum very well, and Neil actually shows off some really tasteful playing in the mid sec-tion.\n\nCold Fire and Everyday Glory are good album enders, and actually don\u2019t let up the en-ergy, or suffer from 2112 disease (putting some random tracks written in two minutes at the end of a record). Geddy sounds pretty poppy on these tracks, which would be out of place for earlier Rush, but on this record it works just fine.\n\nOverall this record is a nice disc. It\u2019s not as jarring and progressive as earlier Rush, but it still provides some good tracks, and a smooth listen.\n",
        "\nMany Rush fans will tell you that the 1970s were the band's best decade. After all, in just six short years, the Canadian trio had managed to release the best selling debut in Canadian history, two successful follow up albums and the monster smash that was '2112'. So how do you close out a decade as strong as this one? Simple; you release the masterpeice that is 'Hemispheres'. \n\nAs usual, all three band members bring everything they've got to the table. Geddy Lee's voice soars above the crescendo of Neil Peart's masterful drumming, while his driving basslines provide a solid foundation for Alex Lifeson's awesome riffing and incredible solos. Try as hard as you might, you just won't find a single second on this disc that doesn't rear its head back and scream excellence.\n\n2112 fans were thrilled to see another epic opener, this time the sequel to Cygnus X-1 from 1977's 'A Farewell To Kings'. Clocking in at an impressive 18 minutes, the song manages to stay fresh throughout - it never gets old and it never gets boring. Musically, the band remains solid, as showcased by the wicked basslines found in \"Circumstances\" and the wonderful instrumental \"La Villa Strangiato\". Lyrically, Neil Peart is at his finest, from the political metaphor that comprises \"The Trees\" and the cohesive storyline found in \"Cygnus X-1 Book II: Hemispheres\".\n\nAll in all, you will be hard pressed to find dissapointment within this album. From the moment you hit play to the second you inevitably start it up again, the album never fails to deliver. The only flaw this album has is its length - or more to the point, the lack thereof. However, it remains an excellent way to close out an even more excellent decade, 'Hemispheres' is a must-own album for not just any Rush fan, but anyone who even slightly apprieciates the progressive genre.\n",
        "\nRush, one of the most original and intelligent bands in rock history evolved from early hard rock influenced albums to some kind of art rock in 80's. Music is full of synthetizers, keyboards and with no more long compositions. \nRush started this experiment with previous release Signals, but with this album song compositions, sound and using of new elements (synths, keys) became finally complete.\n\nEverything starts with the album cover, which is nice, atmospheric and very deep. First song on album, Geddy Lee's favorite Distant Early Warning has typical trademark for Rush in 80's, that means energic, but balanced guitar production and sound almost based on keyboards, what helps to create original and fantastic atmosphere. Don't get me wrong, keys are not lead instrument here, but their role is still very important.\nGeddy's vocals became with previous albums more listenable, and they are no longer so high-pitched and agressive. You can hear that he tried to get more emotions and tone into his voice.\n\nI said there's no more long compositions. Rush left their long progressive opuses and turned into more conventional song structures, the length of songs is always about 5 minutes.\nBand uses this standard music elements to create something new, strong and inovative. Their creativity was incredible in that time, because with using only typical rock instruments (vocals, guitar, bass, keys) they were able to create trends.\n\nThe sound is really nice and deep. Another thing are percussions... always very inconspicuous, but important for the sounding of songs, and if you will be attentive, you will find their technical excellence.\nI don't want to dissect songs here, because the thing, that this whole album is about, is lyrics hand in hand with atmosphere.\n",
        "\nAhh, yes, this was the album that got me seriously listening to the loveable Canuckleheads known as Rush. Every aspect of this album is perfect, and critics be damned for calling them pretentious, less discriminating fans can blow me for calling them humorless and boring. \n\nTerry Brown's production was sterling for the time, every instrument laid out nice and clean for all to hear, yet rich, full, and possessed of the depth that analog recording can give best. And it shows that Rush had really hit their stride as musicians and songwriters, streamlining their approach from the sometimes unwieldy epics of their beginnings to more accessible songs that still maintained their superior musicianship. While the songs here are more radio-friendly, the playing still is as good as it gets in rock or metal without becoming self-indulgent masturbation (are you listening, Dream Theater, etc.?). The songs are perfect in their construction too, always catchy, always involving, always mesmerizing. \n\nNeil Peart's brilliant wordsmithing and death defying drum work are top notch as always, and it bears mentioning that Alex Lifeson is a criminally underrated guitarist too. He shreds, crunches, and lays down all manner of textures all over this album, complimenting always the other players while he's at it. Geddy Lee is one of the all time rock bass gods, and it always amazes me how me manages to pull off sometimes doing three things at once onstage (singing, bass guitar or bass pedals, and keyboards!). His tone is thick, gritty and growling, a constant punchy undercurrent beneath the guitars and riffing right along with delicious complexity--no droning pedal tones for Mr. Lee, never. Those eldritch wails of his are unique, to say the least, too. \"Moving Pictures\" delivers the goods and how.\n\nMy favorite songs on here...well, OK, I do like \"Tom Sawyer\", great album opener, but I really dig \"The Camera Eye\" for its relentless driving feel and its slow buildup to that uptempo verse. I also really like \"Witch Hunt\" for its eerie intro and timely lyrics that remain true today, and chalk up another brilliant instrumental victory for \"YYZ\"--that main riff after the intro is bloody impossible! \"Limelight\" is a great song with intelligent (of course) lyrics about fame and its price, and the drumming is superhuman from start to finish. And \"Red Barchetta\" really shines too. Aw, hell, I love the whole album, but those are my personal picks, the best of a beautiful lot. \n\nThey grew steadily more ambient and textural, not to mention more accessible after this album, during the 80s, but I'm glad that they seem to have gone back more to the sound they had on albums like this in their current direction. And can it be ever said that Rush have ever released a crappy album? I think not, myself. \"Moving Pictures\" is a meisterwerk, a product of a band confident and assured in and of their writing and playing.\n",
        "\nWarmth. As the shining silver disc spins round the spindle, travelling along its intransient and unwavering path as it always does, the music produced induces a peculiar feeling in its host. Warmth creeps from out the headphones nestled in your ears and travels through your nerves, tingling, thrumming, gently probing for those secret places in your heart where it might curl up and brighten your day. It speaks of comfort and companionship, unquestioning affection and heartfelt belief in music for the sake of music. As I glance at the pulsating red line that runs through the liners, the lifeline that is the 'permanent wave' of the album's title, I come to realize something profound and beautiful about this record. There is devotion here, and love too. Rush loves us.\n\nPermanent Waves is a bouncing, ebullient, and wondrous landmark from Canadian rock's ever true standby's; a goddamned institution, say true. There is a glorious life in these hallowed licks, and one can take comfort in the knowledge that Rush poured all of their expertise and all of their will into every note. Rush were the ultimate craftsman, never letting a song leave the nest without the strength to fly and grow and that is why they have lasted. That is why they are legends and the father's of a whole subgenre of heavy metal. That is also why their very best material can function on a host of levels.\n\nExamine Permanent Waves as an exercise in musicianship. These songs are crafted to exist as constructions of verse solo and chorus, as conventional pieces of rock music. But they are also home to an astounding level of exploratory interplay between marvellous instrumentalists. One can follow any instrument throughout the album, noting its progress, appreciating the impressive variance and melodic ability exhibited by each. They're all independent of one another, all playing toward the same goal but undertaking their own journey's to reach it. If you were to isolate any of the instrumental tracks I suspect that each would be quite listenable and enjoyable. This stuff is no less than masterful.\n\nGeddy Lee never stoops to simply hammering on a chord to establish a rhythmic base; rather, he flits around the whole canvas of this sonic work of art, weaving his way between Peart and Lifeson, soloing here, riffing there, playing what the song requires. He does what even his greatest influence John Entwistle (The Who) sometimes failed to do, which is respect the song. It is such a powerful aspect of his particular musical genius, something that many of his followers fail to grasp. John Myung (Dream Theater) understands it; Steve Harris (Iron Maiden) does not.\n\nNeil Peart, no less than the Father Son and Holy Ghost of progressive rock drumming, understands this just as keenly. As a wiser critic than I once said, you never know what he's going to do but he is always on the beat. Peart is the drumming equivalent of Lee, a master of rhythm who also plays some of the best leads in the business. The man's fills are the stuff of legend, and his soft-touch ability is amongst the best in the business. Consider his unconventional approach to the heart-rending ballad \"Different Strings\". A lesser prog drummer might've overplayed the track into an early grave; another might've left it so barren that it lost its yearning intensity. Peart elects to apply a twitchy, almost nervous ticking to several sections, at other times he barely kisses his cymbals with his sticks. In other tracks, such as around the 04:00 mark of \"Entre Nous\" the man hammers out power fills that belie his unflagging precision with force and strength. The man is feel incarnate.\n\nAnd no other guitarist could be more of a fit than Alex Lifeson. He too exhibits a duality in his play, flitting between virtuosic soloist of the highest calibre and masterful rhythm artiste. He riffs majestically on \"Jacob's Ladder\" and with deadly metallic precision on \"Natural Science: Hyperspace\", solos with a delicate psychedelic tone on \"Different Strings\", and displays often his impressive acoustic prowess.\n\nEach one worthy of study, but it is the way they fuse together that makes them what they are. Three minutes into the spiky prog-AOR of \"Freewill\" Lee begins to solo. Next, Lifeson begins shredding, but Geddy doesn't stop. Stereo solos. Finally, Peart joins in the fun by bashing away at his kit underneath Geddy, somewhat synchronising with Geddy's licks and yet also keeping time. Roughly 120 seconds of solo stuffed into 40.\n\n\"The Spirit of Radio\" may be the finest example on this album of Rush's extraordinary cohesion as players. There is great irony in the fact that the most beloved radio hit from the album, the lead single is in fact a highly complex prog-de-resistance with unfettered performances and an almost freeform feel. There are bouncy, melodic rock sections, a reggae inspired break, labyrinthine bridges connecting disparate parts, headbangable metallic riffs, and coursing through it all the permanent wave of naive wonderment as represented by Lifeson's shrieking bursts of static-y transmission tying the package together.\n\nThat last bridges into how Permanent Waves is equally strong as a collection of wonderful songs. The heroes here are lyricist Peart, who crafts unencumbered odes to nature, love, understanding, and music that express in equal parts literary prowess and a naive belief that what one says is more important than the constraints one is supposed to adhere to in saying it. The songs are almost dauntingly hyperverbose, and Geddy Lee must be given a hand for rescuing them from seeming cold or distant. Who but Lee could've rescued these words?\n\n\"Each of us\nA cell of awareness\nImperfect and incomplete.\nGenetic blends\nWith uncertain ends\nOn a fortune hunt that's far too fleet.\"\n\nThey are comforting, grandfatherly even, but good songwriting? Perhaps not. But Geddy, Geddy reaches down and screams them from the tips of his toes and in his passion you come to believe that this unwieldy ill-conceived rhyme is a profound statement. For all my occasional smirking at his wailing voice, Geddy has the rare ability to make lyrics stick. He wails with all of his soul, and he makes possible all of the thoughts that Peart wishes to express.\n\nAnd sometimes, he doesn't have to. \"Jacob's Ladder\", a creeping tour-de-force that could very well be the blueprint for Metallica's progressive instrumental masterworks, is a semi-instrumental with few technical pyrotechnics and only brief verses bookending the piece. Riffs advance and retreat like armies on a battlefield, the band locked in step and singularly purposeful. It is both unvirtuosic and highly cerebral, Rush experimenting with an almost classical style of composition. Organ-flavoured keys, militant-metal riffing, and circular spiralling leads. Unconventional simplicity at its best.\n\nIn a scant thirty-nine minutes Rush deliver a testament to sheer unadulterated Rush-ness that is representative of everything this band stands for. It IS pretentious, it is sweetly innocent in its morality and its view of the world, it is completely and utterly honest with the listener. It is rarely simple and seldom underwritten and yet it breathes freely and without reserve. Not every moment is 'perfect', not every song structured as I would have done it, not every brilliant riff carried as far as it might go... but I wouldn't change a single note. Permanent Waves feels like a living entity, timeless and yet I feel that my appreciation of it might change in years to come. Even if I set it aside and never listened to again, even if I came to feel tired of its unrelenting gentle tone and sweet nature, I would not change one fucking note.\n\nBecause it is Rush. And this is the way it had to be.\n\nStand-Outs: \"The Spirit of Radio\", \"Different Strings\", \"Jacob's Ladder\"\n",
        "\nIt's always strange, make the review for album which is out for a years, and many people know this release.\nOk, we have there the prog rock classic. Rush's 2112, third album with drummer and main lyricist of the band Neil Peart. And first their commercially known and sucessfull album. Because it's still early work, lyrics is based on sci-fi, and the title opus 2112, composed of 7 parts, is something like social - political story bout fictive republic on planet somewhere in space. In fact it's critique of socialistic politics.\n\nThe whole album except softer and balladic parts is very energic, dynamic and catchy. The fact that will you love the most is the technical skill of band members. Especially Alex Lifeson and his solos are always fantastic. The riffage through all songs is something fresh and with excellent bass playing by Geddy Lee it's very strong combination. Everything is based on heavy, fast, but technically great drums. Music with lyrics and atmosphere is very dramatic, and in ballads is place for another emotions too.\n\nBut the strongest point of this release is songwriting. Rush has finally evolved into complete musicians with good technical and songwriting skills. I can say, there's no moment, that will bore you. It's fascinating listen how the instruments are changing the leads. Always it's guitar, but sometimes will take this role Geddy's bass, and there's also drum solo, and many instrument parts, where you can hear great technique.\nI absolutely love the fact, how Geddy's vocals fills the space between drums and guitar, the sound which is not so massive, because we're still talking bout rock, maybe early metal in some parts. Hand in hand with this comes the question of production. I said it before, the whole sound is very dynamic, there's place for every instrument, and especially sound of guitar is very hot and powerful.\n\nFinally, this album is filled of excellent new and fresh ideas, and that's the reason why this became classic among classics. There's no weak moment, no incosistent parts.\n",
        "\nThe album begins with the sound of guitar pull-offs sweeping across the soundscape soon to be joined by bass and drums. The opening track \u201cThe Spirit of Radio\u201d is an anthem to the powerful force of the radio and the music industry. In keeping with this theme, most of the album Permanent Waves is very radio friendly. With the exception of \"Jacob \u2019s Ladder\" and \"Natural Science\", the songs here are of radio length: around 4 minutes or so. Two of Rush\u2019s most popular songs came from this album. The aforementioned \u201cSpirit of Radio\u201d and \u201cFreewill\u201d still receive radio air time.\n\nAt this point in their career, Rush was slowly phasing away from the progressiveness of previous works like \u201c2112\u201d and \u201cHemispheres\u201d. This is not to say the material here is not progressive, in fact, this is a great album for those that want to hear two different sides of Rush: The longer epic side, and the shorter, more accessible side. Even in the shorter songs, there is an element of experimentation. For instance, in \u201cSpirit of Radio\u201d, near the end the song goes into an unexpected reggae-like bridge section before hitting the guitar solo. A few albums later, they began to add more of the reggae riffs into their sound (Vital Signs and Digital Man being good examples).\n\nFor those that like longer, more experimental songs, Permanent Waves has a lot to offer. I\u2019ll be honest, I\u2019m not a huge fan of \u201cJacob\u2019s Ladder\u201d, however the more I listen to it, the more it grows on me. It\u2019s a seven minute, mostly instrumental song. After an ominous beginning with lyrics about \u201cclouds preparing for battle\u201d, the song goes into a lengthy mid section. Here is where the \u201cshort song\u201d crowd will likely tune out. The riffs here have a military march feel to them, very fitting of the previous lyrics. Some synth later comes in, along with Geddy\u2019s vocals shaped into a robotic voice. The guitar returns, slowly growing louder and building up to a loud climax. I can see why some could see this as a boring song, as I used to think that way before, but there\u2019s a lot here that is heard only after a few extra listens.\n\nThe big, epic track of the album is \u201cNatural Science\u201d. This is an excellent track and is definitely the highlight of the album. Not only is the concept here noteworthy, the music and atmosphere created as so fitting of its title. It begins gently with the sounds of waves hitting a beach. In comes an acoustic guitar with some reverb added on, making it sound as if he\u2019s playing it on a deserted beach somewhere. Right as the first set of lyrics is finished; the sounds of seagulls can be heard in the background. Pretty cool. There\u2019s some rich visual imagery here in the lyrics. For example: \u201cWheels within wheels, in a spiral array, a pattern so grand and complex, Time after time we lose sight of the way, Our causes can\u2019t see their effect.\u201d Add to that more strange vocals effects during the \u201cHyperspace\u201d section and you\u2019ve got a song that\u2019s full of interesting twists. It\u2019s a shame that this was one of Rush\u2019s last \u201cepic\u201d songs.\n\nSo putting this all together, there\u2019s a good mix of shorter, accessible songs, and longer more complex ones. Rush may have gotten more radio friendly at this point, but they still had the artist integrity and the brains to come up with some great progressive rock songs. Permanent Waves is a fine album, maybe even superior to Moving Pictures.\n",
        "\nThis is one of Rush's classic releases, from before they got a synthesizer fetish. Wait, you need more reason than that to buy this album? Well, ok. \n\nOn this album, we get to see Rush at its best. Rush has yet to top \"Hemishperes\". It kicks off with the continuation of the Cygnus X-1 story, part one of which was the ending to their previous album, \"A Farewell to Kings\". It's a great epic, clocking in at just over 18 minutes long, and is great from beginning to end. Geddy Lee's voice is really great, and try not to sing along with the \"Every soul a battlefield\" part. Of course Alex Lifeson's guitar is fantastic, Neil Peart pounds the skins like a master, and Geddy Lee proves that he can play bass as well as he can sing. It's my opinion that Cygnus X-1 pts. 1 and 2 comprise the best concept song the band has ever written, even though 2112 has a slightly better storyline. \n\nYou would think the rest of the album would be filler, and that's almost true. The second song, Circumstances, is a pretty regular song for Rush, being about 3 1/2 minutes long, and possibly an attempt at a radio hit. Despite that, it's still quite good, and I never skip it. Next up is The Trees, which is a decent enough slow-ish song, dealing with trees (duh) and having some meaningful lyrics that I won't ruin here. Good, but pales in comparison to the next one. \n\nWhich is: La Villa Strangiato, a nine minute instrumental! This is a really great song, and definitely Rush's best instrumental. Geddy has a great bass solo in there, and the whole thing just rocks. \n\nThe only flaw with this album is that despite the lengthy songs it's still a little short, being just over 35 mintutes. On the other hand, I much prefer a short album to Rush packing in a bunch of radio-friendly filler songs. If you're at all a fan of Rush, and you don't have this, get it right now. If you're new, I'd suggest starting with \"2112\", then moving on to \"A Farewell to Kings\", and then buying this one, so you can see their evolution, and because the first part to Cygnus X-1 is on \"A Farewell to Kings\".\n",
        "\nThe 80's were gone and a new decade was beginning. During this time Rush still pressed on since the early 1970's. An achievement not many bands have been awarded. But with a new decade and most bands changing images and sound, Rush kept a key element and added some new ones as well. The result is some mediocre music by Rush, which remains underrated to most people, except for die hard Rush fans. \n\nIn 1991, Rush landed out it's fifteenth full-length album, Roll the Bones. In the past Rush made some pretty good albums with a few dozen hit songs. But you never hear any of their new stuff on the radio...why is this? What made Rush famous was their undying will to make music complicated in their strange, but unique, progressive rock style. For Roll the Bones, each song has its own feel for progressive music, which is one of the key elements. But Rush added some new stuff, that always this album to be swept under the rug. \n\nOne of the thing Rush added was a lot of symphonic/synthesizers. Okay sure Rush has done this before, but this time it comes to just about every song. This is a good thing in that the extra sound boosts the quality of the music, but in a bad way the songs sound very repetitive. The other element that Rush added was how the songs were structured. Most of the songs, like 90% of them, are slow. The songs are very melodic, and don't feature some of the cool stuff that Rush is known for. There's maybe one or two intense solos, no insane drum beats by Peart, and the songs just seem to run together, which is very repetitive and boring. \n\nEven Geddy Lee's singing gets boring. It is almost like he just sat there and sang it while he was watching tv or something. Now this is not to say that the album is bad, it is a very decent Rush album. However, no songs stand out as being hits, or being worth your time listening too. I recommend this to all Rush fans (rather die hard fans). If this was your first Rush album, you would probably throw it out and never buy anything Rush again. Some good songs to check out are: Dreamline, Face Up, and Neurotica.\n",
        "\nNow, cover albums are generally not that good, and this is no exception to that rule. I can't say this is really bad, but it's not as good as it could have been.\n\nFirst of all, the songs are technically tight and performed perfectly, and that is part of the downfall of this album. If Rush did their own spin on these songs, rather than just performing them as they once were done, I feel it could've been much better.\n\nGeddy's vocals don't really seem to fit, and most of the time they sound distorted, as if they were made to fit in production. If this is true, it doesn't work at all. Of course, the instruments are played amazingly, and as they should be. Every note being clearly heard, as a liking to the original songs. Alex's solos really stand out, though, as he performs other people's songs with so much passion.\n\nThe best tracks on here are Heart Full Of Soul, For What It's Worth (the best song) and Crossroads (what a solo, utterly amazing).\nSummertime Blues is a big letdown, as is Shapes Of Things because it just sounds so strange with Geddy singing it.\n\nI'd only really recommend this if you're a completist, or you really want to hear Rush pay homage to their idols. As I said, it's not that bad, but don't expect a stellar performance.\n",
        "\nBy the time Rush came out with Signals, their sound was drastically changed. Yes it is safe to say, what metal Rush had was depleted. Thus creating a sound that was unique of Rush. This album really isn't that heavy, in fact it is easier to hear the bass then it is the guitar. It's not a bad album but it isn't the best Rush album by far.\n\nCould Rush out do their last album, Moving Pictures, and be successful again? Well the answer is no. The best way to describe Signals is very atmospheric like. Every song sounds like you are floating on a cloud, because it is that soft. In fact I don't think there are any distorted guitars, if there is they are very hard to hear.\n\nOne of the big things that Rush brings in to this album is synthesizers and keyboards. I know Rush has been exploring with this stuff for a long time now. But this album basically leans off of them, using them in every song at just about every point you could expect to have \u2018em. Other wise Geddy Lee's vocals are always up to par. Neil Peart's drumming is, and always will be fucking awesome.\n\nNot the best Rush album to get, but overall not bad. The only song that really sticks out as being good is Subdivisions. Some of the other songs grow on you after awhile, like Digital Man, New World Man, and Countdown. That is if the softness of the songs doesn't send you into a sleep first.\n",
        "\nRush have long been the kingpins of prog-metal, from it's invention on A Caress of Steel through such classic albums as 2112, A Farewell to Kings, Hemispheres, Permanant Waves, Moving Pictures, and Presto, and remain thus through an endless stream of covers from the booming prog-metal scene.\n\nHowever, just like virtually every other classic metal act Rush always idolized and tried to emulate classic rockers from the 50's and 60's. Much like Sabbath it's as if they became awesome and innovative in spite of themselves.\n\nSo, after thirty years of flying digits and ultra-wordy epics, they decided to let their hair down and pay homage to their own idols. While there's nothing patently wrong with the idea, it simply comes across as a mildly derivative but ultimately unsatisfying listen. Simply put, Rush is too intelligent and advanced for this stuff, and they can't really surmount their own massive shadows to prove themselves as just a coupla guys who love to rock 'n roll.\n\nThe songs are well done, deviating little from the originals. The production is pristine and crisp, and they perform the songs perfectly in all regards. Lifeson plays note-for-note perfect, but his style and perfect playing sort of drain the fire from the songs, the cold technical mastery and unique sound actually playing against him. Peart is, for an absolute first, totally unremarkable, and Lee, well, ol' Geddy's voice is simply not right for these songs. The man's voice is hardly in the same style as Roger Daltry or Eddie Cochran, and his high-pitched willowy style is (even kept in a low register as it is here) just not right for the stuff they're playing.\n\nBasically a one-time spin. There isn't anything really wrong with it, but too a Rush fan it just can't feel right. Here's hoping the boys are just relaxing before their next opus, continuing the virtually unbroken streak of extremely competant records by this legendary group.\n\nStand-Outs: \"The Seeker\", \"Crossroads\"... and meh, nothing really special here.\n",
        "\nRush is great; I never get tired of listening to them, even though I have only a few of their albums. I got this on a whim, mostly because of the \"career retrospective\" nature of the tracklist. I only knew a handful of the songs here, but the ones I didn't know were just as enjoyable. It's interesting to hear them play brand new songs, and 30-year-old numbers back to back.\n\nFrom other reviews I've read, I get the impression the sound quality is the most hated of any Rush live album. It's true, the crowd is constantly noticeable, and it is a stadium crowd. I think this is part of the show though, and it's cool to hear everybody scream at a certain part in a song. The music mix is kind of bass-heavy, so it makes for good blasting, and all the instruments are clear (guitar, bass, drums, voice, synth). You can hear everything that's going on at once, which is a rarity in recordings, especially live ones.\n\nThe performances themselves are great! It is amazing that after so many years, the band still has a spark, and still transmits so much energy. The songs I already knew (mainly the real famous ones) are played accurately, but also they are adapted very well from studio to a live setting. The songs all feel like they were meant to be live songs, even the radio hits like \"Tom Sawyer\" and \"Spirit of Radio\". The ones I didn't already know (mainly the newer songs, especially from the Vapor Trails album) are interesting, and made the performance seem well rounded. Listening to Rush in Rio makes me want to buy those other studio albums that I don't have!\n\nSo basically, I give it 90 for being an excellent live album, although I can't give it a perfect score (due to the nature of live albums, having no new songs). A little more improvisation or creative twists on old songs would have been nice, but why nitpick? Rush is obviously still a great live band, even this far into their career.\n",
        "\nIt is hard to say that Rush's really early stuff is considered heavy metal. Some people don't consider any Rush albums to be metal! Rush's self titled album and debut is not metal, but it is an excellent piece of classical rock. The first album also starts to push a familiar Rush theme of progressive guitar writing. Although the progressiveness comes out more later in Rush's career. \n\nIt is easy to see that Rush was fueled by Led Zeppelin. The riffs and drum beats really sound like they belong in a Led Zeppelin song. Like What You're Doing's main riff and Lee's vocals on Finding My Way are very Zeppelin influenced. Even the seven minute blues like song Here Again is similar to Zeppelin's Since I've Been Loving You.\n\nHaving only eight songs, this album isn't really that long. The only Rush hit from this album is Working Man. However, most of the songs on this album are worth listening to, including What You're Doing and Need Some Love. \n\nThe production is alright, but not the best -unless you got the re-mastered version. Geddy Lee's singing is bright and brilliant like on all the Rush albums. Sometimes he tries some weird screams and moans like Robert Plant. That's just not his style though. Lifeson adds some pretty interesting riffs, but the technical riffs that Rush is known for is hardly seen on the debut. The drumming flows good with the music, but it isn't Neil Peart. There are no crazy drum fills or syncopated rhythms. Over all it isn't a bad album, but it isn't the best Rush album. I would really get it if you were trying to get all the Rush albums or you were a huge Rush fan. For metal heads, I wouldn't recommend it, you need one of the late 70's early 80's albums, unless you like classical rock.\n",
        "\nProbably Rush\u2019s most 80s sounding album, Power Windows has a lot of synth on it. While Hold Your Fire had plenty of synth, it came off to me as more mature and refined in sound. Lyrically, this album deals with different forms of power whether it be money or nuclear bombs. So technically this is a concept album. I am a fan of concept albums as long as the songs are strong enough to support the overall concept. While the songwriting here is good, the resulting sound of most of the songs bugs me. \n\nThe Big Money is exceptional. The slap bass line rocks in the verses, it\u2019s probably one of the better bass lines he\u2019s written. The guitar solo in the song it great, although it doesn\u2019t sound quite as strong as it should be. This is probably due to either the production or the type of guitar he used at the time, plus I\u2019m comparing it to the Rush in Rio version where the guitar sounds much fuller.\n\nThe next track is Grand Designs. This is where the synth and chime sounds are overdone. The beginning alone is enough to make you cringe. It sounds very . . . joyful. Not that sounding happy is a bad thing, however it feels like something that would fit on a kid\u2019s TV show. Other than that, the verse of the songs works well. The guitar has a reggae-like quality to them.\n\nI don\u2019t have a problem with Rush using synthesizers to complement the music, it appears that here they decided to use it way to much. See Middletown Dreams, Mystic Rhythms, and Emotion Detector for the \u2018dated\u2019 80\u2019s sound I am referring to. I\u2019m sure back then it might have sounded fine, but twenty something years later, it doesn\u2019t come off as \u2018cool\u2019 sounding.\n\nBesides the negative points, this is a Rush album so you can expect worthy performances by each member of the band. I wish the guitar\u2019s sounded a bit thicker to make the music for driving, but the solos here are worthy to be called Lifeson\u2019s own. The bass lines, as mentioned previously, as quality. Neal Peart sounds like he began experimenting with electronic drums, as the album has some drumbeats that vary from the typical drum kit possibilities (see Mystic Rhythms). \n\nThis one has grown on me the more I listen to it. Try to put the synth in context and enjoy the album.\n",
        "\nI don't understand why Rush doesn't have more reviews on this site. It's really a crying shame considering how emotional, talented, and influential they are. I can understand how people have a hard time thinking of them as metal because they do in fact sound closer to prog rock and classic rock, but damn, they're on the site now! Everyone needs to get with the program! \nAnyway, Vapor Trails continues Rush's trademark slice of intensely emotional, heavy, driving prog rock/metal and though not a masterpiece or as atmospheric, memorable, and progressive as Test for Echo, I see nothing wrong with a band toning down their sound a little bit for experimental and creative purposes. Hey, as long as they're not turning mallcore on us then I'm cool with whatever they decide to do.\nWhereas Test for Echo was more ethereal and atmospheric( as well as having less radio viability), there in fact was a single from this album, though I can't remember which song it is. The ironic fact is, though, that these songs aren't as memorable as the ones from Test for Echo. You would think since this album is more straightforward and commercial-sounding then the songs would stick in my head more, but it's not the case.\nGeddy Lee still somewhat sounds like the chick that never was, Alex Lifeson is still churning out heavy, crunchy, technical grooves, Neil Peart still knows how to devour those drums of his, and the bass is still right on target.Here we have a technical opus that doesn't become long-winded and superfluous like some prog acts do.\nI believe, also, that the lyrics on this album are still somewhat political and worldly like they are on Test for Echo, but the meanings of them didn't register with me yet. I will read the lyrics soon to determine this, however.\nAll in all an excellent release from a highly talented, but overlooked band. Not a masterpiece, but pick up just the same.\n",
        "\nThis may be Rush\u2019s most synth-laden album, but it is still of excellent quality. One of the major complaints I have heard about Rush\u2019s synth era is that Alex Lifeson had less to do. That\u2019s not entirely true. Sure, he doesn\u2019t play blazing leads or crunching riffs as he did in the early days, but he does play some excellent rhythm guitar during this era. Even still, a lot of his best solos were done through this time period so it\u2019s not like he abandoned them all together. Don\u2019t expect to hear classic hard rock when playing this album. It definitely softer, but the depth of the music is great. \n\nThe opening track, Force Ten, rocks the hardest here. The bass line is phenomenal, and overall the synth does not strike me as being as cheesy as it was in the past. Time Stand Still is probably the most \u2018pop\u2019 song here, but at least the lyrics are strong. It\u2019s about wanting to slow down time to enjoy life a little longer. Prime Mover has yet another excellent bass line. I really wish more bands would use leading bass line like Geddy Lee does instead of just playing root notes. My favorite of the album is Mission. It\u2019s got inspirational lyrics about sticking to your dreams and goals in life, and it has great instrumental section near the end. A powerful guitar solo finishes off the track, and I think it\u2019s one of Lifeson\u2019s best.\n\nI have spoken mostly about Geddy and Alex, but what about drum god Neil Peart? He\u2019s not all over his drum kit like in the past, however he used electronic drums and percussion here, so his creativity is still evident. HYF has some of his best lyric writing as well. Force Ten, Mission, Open Secrets, and pretty much every other track has well written lyrics. I\u2019m not sure if there is an overall theme to the album, but a lot of the tracks have inspirational lyrics.\n\nThere are some weaker tracks here though. I\u2019m not a big fan of the closing track, High Water; it just doesn\u2019t come off as epic as a closing track should. Mission probably would have worked as a better closing song. Tai Shan is ok, as long as you don\u2019t expect a usual Rush song. It\u2019s mostly synth and mandolin, but no drums. It has grown on me with several listenings.\n\nI know I said in a previous review that Permanent Waves was my favorite, but HYF practically surpasses it. It may have a lot of synth in it, but Rush performed it well. It\u2019s definitely worthy of checking out.\n\nHighs: Musicianship, lyrics, mostly everything.\n\nLows: The synthesizers may turn some people away.\n\nFinal Comment: One of Rush\u2019s strongest albums.\n",
        "\nLike Queensryche's Hear in the Now Frontier, I also once rented Rush's album Test for Echo from the library and decided to burn it upon a subsequent listen. God, I love the library where I live. You can rent ten albums at once and return them about a month later. They're metal selection is slim to none, however.\nI'm not so sure what Rush is doing on this site, as I'm yet to hear evidence of heavy distortion, heavy soloing, etc., but I suppose they have been a large enough influence on the metal world to be included on this site.\nAnyhow, this album has one of the most captivating covers I've ever seen. I know you shouldn't judge a book by its cover, but if you're getting a very good impression by that cover, you should go with your gut feeling, and that's what I did. The cover consists of a towering sculpture of a person made out of large marble rocks standing on the beach.\nThe music, of course, is also noteworthy. The only way I'm familiar with Rush is from their singles that I've released, and this album shows the band in an entirely different respective. Every song on this album is less processed and more atmospheric than any single I've heard from them on the radio. Many of the songs are sung with such an emotional sincerity that it's easy to become attached to the music even for just the pure feeling of it. Catchiness abounds on this record as well. Inspiring acoustic work is to be found on Driven, nice syncopated leads on Virtuosity, and a 'wordly' vibe emanating from the song \"Half the World\". Lyrically, this album is also a standout. The lyrics deal with everything from the shallow experience of talking to someone on the Internet to politics and you can tell Geddy Lee means what he's singing.(Can you believe I once thought Rush's vocalist was a girl? *shrugs) This album probably shouldn't be considered the best in their catalogue, but it stands out as a bold, expressive piece of art with enough driving aggression and melody to become revered by Rush fans, progressive rock and metal fans, and rock and metal fans in general. For its cover art alone, this album is worth picking up.\n",
        "\nThe only reason I don't give this album a perfect score is that their following stuff is even better (and because of that stupid sound effect passage in the middle of By-Tor and the Snow Dog). From the opening unison salvo, you can hear where bands like Dream Theater draw tremendous influence from far as chops go, and you can also hear the infinite difference between previous drummer John Rutsey and current god Neil Peart, with his terrifically accented snare work. After the opening shredding, everything pauses and they go into this soaring riff in case there was any question about whether this band kicked ass or not. From there, it's a roller coaster of diverse & memorable riffs and solos from Mr. Lifeson, Peart's godly drumming and interesting lyrics, and Geddy's banshee wails and monster bass work (that's right, you can hear the bass in this band). The rhythmically unique \"Beneath, Between and Behind\" is one of my favorites, and that groovy riff in the middle with the whole open-closed hihat pattern will silence any naysayers who put down Neil as having no groove (or maybe he doesn't, I wouldn't know, but the band rocks pretty fucking well and grooves here). \"Rivendell\" is, as the name implies, about all things fantasy-related, and is actually a quiet acoustic number with some downright beautiful classical guitar work. Not a weak track on here, some terrific and revolutionary progressive rock/metal/whatever, and a good starting point for a band with a huge discography full of great albums.\n",
        "\nSure, critics may have panned Rush during their three decades of output, but what do critics know? \"Moving Pictures\" is definitely ranked in my top three Rush albums, and for a good reason. A perfect balance is struck between the hard rock tendencies of earlier albums and the more electronic influenced experimentalism that they would eventually come to be known for.\n\nWith Rush you get three proficient musicians that aren't afraid to push the limits of what this genre has to offer. Geddy Lee's bass playing is top notch, while his high pitched vocals are an acquired taste at best. Alex Lifeson is one of the finest guitarists to emerge from the 70s/80s, and this album is a definite indicator of that. Last but not least, every modern drummer can kiss Neil Peart's ass for all I care. A great lyricist and an astounding drummer? Count me in. \n\nStandout tracks on this album include \"Limelight\", \"Tom Sawyer\", and the concert favorite \"YYZ\". Dream Theater should be ashamed of showing their Rush fanboyism with the song \"YTSE Jam\", but I'll save that for another time. \n\nIn closing, you could easily find this album for less than ten dollars, and you should get it if you consider yourself a fan of Prog Rock, or any form of rock for that matter.\n",
        "\nAlthough I don't claim to be the biggest Rush fan, I've heard more than enough of their work to know what their fundamental sound is and Test For Echo exhibits a good show of what Rush is all about - diversified rock. While most seem to consider this to be one of their less ingenious pieces, I find it to be both well-balanced and extremely catchy, most of it anyway. \n\nOf course as in most albums there are the stand out songs such as Virtuality, Driven, Totem, and the title track, but what's really great about this CD is that there are no bad songs. Basically, you can stomp your feet to any track, whether or not you really hear anything terribly creative or unique in it. Some may argue that more of the same isn't good enough, but Rush can't be expected to create a new musical theme every time they come out with a new album. I think it's perfectly fine to re-use a good basic sound mechanism as long as you keep shifting the gears around a bit, and that's just what the band does.\n\nI did notice that, unlike the majority of Rush's music, I needed to listen to Test For Echo a few times over before I really caught on to it. It had to grow on me, which came as a surprise since I was used to the usual pick-up-and-play nature of the band. This may be a good thing though, as a CD with more depth will hold your interest for a more expansive period of time.\n\nLyrically, Rush brings forth their usual blend of thoughtful poetry, real life questions and nonsensical rhyming sequences. If you enjoyed these before, this new serving will sit just right with you. Those who don't care for this style will hopefully be able to appreciate the album for it's music alone, which is not a very hard thing to do anyway.\n\nTest For Echo is a smooth ride through the avenue of traditional progressive rock. Rush fans need not be told to check this out, and new listeners should find plenty of solid, if not entirely unique, musical enjoyment.\n",
        "\nAhhh, Rush. One of my favorite bands of all time; and this is the album that started it all for me. Now I've been a drummer for most of my life, and my drum teacher was always raving about Neil Peart, who called a god. I decided to check out Rush, and took my chances on this live album. Oh, MAN. Their energy on stage is insane, and every member of the band has amazing. Plus all the songs are killer. It starts off with \"Spirit of Radio,\" one of their biggest hits. It's catchy. It's good. Geddy Lee is a great vocalist in my opinion. I know a lot of people who are turned off by Rush because of the vocals. Well fuck y'alls. You're missing out. \n\nSongs of note:\n\"Yyz.\" This completely blew me away. A long insane drum solo by The Professor, Neil Peart. Listening to this completely changed me as a drummer. \n\"Jacob's Ladder, The Trees, and Xanadu.\" These three equally great songs are merged together, though they're three different tracks. Jacob's Ladder is a great epic, and goes into The Trees, another epic, then goes Xanadu, another epic! These three songs are very synth heavy, and Geddy Lee is the man on synth. \n\nEverybody should get this album. Everyone will enjoy it. Musicians will enjoy it even more, the musicianship on this disc is incredible. I learned a lot listening from this. Not only as a musician, but also a human being. As the final notes of \"La Villa Strangiato\" ended, I looked myself in the mirror, and decided I was going to get out of my nowhere job and make something of myself. Now I'm the manager of a big real estate agency, married to a beautiful wife, and it's all thanks to this one album. Thank you, Rush. Thank you. *sniff*\n",
        "\nConsidering what Neil Peart went through prior to this recording, it's impressive that he still has his heart in his playing. Once Rush got back together and he had worked out some of his problems, they crafted this 'comeback' album of sorts. It is a little different for them. Renowned as the kings of progressive rock/metal/whatever (an idea I totally agree with), it's interesting to see that this album isn't nearly as technical or progressive as many of their earlier efforts. More straightforward songwriting seems to be the order of the day here, and it works in most places. The catchy opener One Little Victory, which comes bursting right out of the gates with Peart's propulsive double bass/snare rhythm (VERY cool drumming), and some pretty heavy riffing for them which happens to be really well-written. Though mostly verse-chorus-verse, there are some jumpy transitions here and there, and it's such a cool song that I've got no complaints. Alex Lifeson actually pulls out some surprisingly heavy and groovy riffs, particularly near the end of Peaceable Kingdom, what a badass riff! Still one of the most diversely talented guitarists out there. This is also one of my favorites on the album, with a beautiful chorus and very cleverly written lyrics, impressive stuff. Geddy Lee shines throughout with his soaring vocal melodies (he's still got it) and killer basswork, the latter of which really shows on Earthshine. Basically, strong songwriting throughout most of the album, and it's less technical and progressive for Rush, but not bad by any means. Worth checking out.\n",
        "\nVapor Trails is by no means a complete album, but I haven't been able to get some of these songs out of my head, they are just that good. I had the priviledge of seeing Rush on this tour, and they have to be one of the greatest live bands in the world. I even enjoyed the songs off of Vapor Trails, which I haven't heard prior to the concert. Instead of criticizing the mediocore, I'll stick to the greatness that this album conveys. \n\nOne Little Victory used to irk me slightly, because it sounded like Geddy Lee was whining too often, but Rush fans have to learn to live with that and it is actually a pretty hard driven song with excellent bass work. \n\nGhost Rider is one of my favorite songs from Rush. Its just so beautifully written by Neil Peart. A very ballad like song that is shows many that Geddy Lee's voice is getting much better. Its supposed about the untimely death of his wife and daughter and how it possessed him to ride his motorcycle across the world. If you are interested, he wrote an actual book about the entire events as well aptly named Ghost Rider. \n\nSecret Touch is another really nice song, mainly so because it showcases Geddy Lee's ungodly bass playing ability. Once again another beautifully written song. \n\nThere are many nice songs on this album. I just decided to showcase my personal favorites. My only complaint about this album is that Rush seems to be doing what Dream Theater has been doing with Mike Portnoy, with Neil Peart. Neil is IMO the closest to god of drumming as their can be, but he doesn't display what he's capable of here really. He sounds more powerful here than in previous albums, but he doesn't showcase his technicality, and I know its not because he lost it, because he was still ruling ass live. Great drumming would bring this album up to a 100 pretty quick.\n"
