        "\nI'll maintain two key points throughout this review (for an album I did not think would be my first coverage of the band who invented the genre this site is dedicated to). First, each of the heavy songs on Black Sabbath Vol. 4 are expansions upon the style heard in the five heavy songs on Master of Reality, where Iommi focused more than ever before on the emphatic, driving riffing that would set the metal genre apart from other rock that uses guitar distortion, for lack of a more eloquent description. It's a simple style albeit more involved and concentrated than the bluesier approach of the first two Sabbath albums, so it makes sense that it doesn't end with classics (as in greatest songs ever written) like \"Sweet Leaf\" and \"Lord of this World\", and before a new metal listener checks out Pentagram or Saint Vitus, Vol. 4 is what they need next to get perfectly acquainted with this genuinely heavy playing style - a crunchier, more bashing style that is not as commonly heard in traditional heavy metal post-1983. Gallops, yes, melodic leads, yes, but not a lot of low-end \"DUN, DUN DUN, DA, DA-DUN...\" I want to emphasize that observation because it brings me to my next point - the seven heavy songs on this album are just skull-splittingly heavy for their time and still rely more on distortion and crunch than most extreme metal. Dying Fetus is heavier than Black Sabbath, I think we can all agree on that, but what really NEEDS distortion more? What emphasizes the growling tone originally produced by overdriving your amp settings until it fucked with your pickups more? John Gallagher's hyper-speed chugs broken up by tapping down a dissonant scale, or fucking \"Wheels of Confusion\" 20-some seconds in? Yeah, \"DUN, DUN DUN, DA, DA-DUN...\" all the way!\n\nAnd this is why Vol. 4 is the perfect sequel to a relatively consice classic like Master, especially before releasing brilliant masterworks of early progressive metal in '73 and '75. This would be Sabbath's last \"doom\" album for a while, I guess, and it's a damn fine note for Iommi to leave off with for a while, before eventually returning to his signature chunkiness (in my opinion, he did that on Mob Rules which I think sounds bigger than the first Dio-fronted album). This 1972 effort has been called inconsistent due to tracks like \"FX\" and \"Laguna Sunrise\", but honestly, sequencing matters very little by today's standards - Sabbath have so many classic metal songs so just throw ANY of the seven heavy metal songs here in a playlist with all your favorites from albums before and after this one, and you're set - there is actually a larger portion of metal to be heard here than on Master, and I'll say that despite that one being my preferred Sabbath outing. Even if you're reviewing this from a vinyl standpoint, there's still 11 minutes worth of the signature Sabbathian heaviness before a piano ballad (not as good as \"Planet Caravan\" and \"Solitude\" I'll admit) and a filler track enter the fold. Plus, the groovy-as-hell \"Supernaut\" closes out the A-Side, so there's no point complaining. \"Tomorrow's Dream\" is a classic shorter song as well that balances nicely between the chunkier heaviness mentioned from the previous track and a truly unforgettable momentum, with a cool pull-off riff in between the verses that emphasizes the lower C standard tuning. You can do a lot with that sort of power-chord progression and Bill Ward's drumming makes it extremely catchy in this case, as well as brighter sounding than it should be due to his use of cymbals. Ozzy also displays a little more range here and you get a sense of the charisma he's known for as a frontman.\n\nOn the low-end side of things though, I will say this is not an album that comes to mind for the Geezer-sucker in me. He's there alright, and of course his tracks are very necessary for sounding this heavy in '72, but that's kind of just it. Less of his jammy basswork circa 1970 and more just following Iommi, but it sounds superb all the same. \"Snowblind\" isn't overrated at all either, Iommi hadn't played heavy riffs accented by the chord strumming heard there very much up to this point, and eventually bands did catch on, like The Gates of Slumber with \"Suffer No Guilt\" (random example that came to mind, there's better ones). At those chord strumming moments (the sound of which did not initially appeal to the Indian kid with no background in western music, feeling drawn specifically to heavy metal who was me), the fine bassist that Geezer really is does in fact come through, then it picks up in much the same way \"Under the Sun\" is remembered for after its DOOMED intro. In Snowblind though, the final groove is more approachable in a hard-rocking sense, whereas in Under the Sun it's kind of hypnotic what Iommi is playing. That closing track on this album also makes for a break that is very similar to that of \"Into the Void\" from the previous album, but firstly, Ward plays something noticeably different this time, and self-plagiarism does not apply when you're this ahead of your time and creating a new, really daring style of music.\n\nIf it seems like I'm reviewing this music from simply a \"well how about that guitar distortion!\" standpoint by saying things like \"the heavy songs\" and \"crunchy\", that's because I absolutely am - like I said, this style emphasizes why the genre was actually dubbed \"heavy metal\" to begin with. The use of distortion (and a better tone than most of what today comprises metal anyhow) is consistent to the point where the songs that do not feature it are noticeable deviations from the essential sound, the guitar sound which is now obligatory and taken for granted in metal - hence why it's so nice returning to the roots, roots that do it better than any other band heavily abusing drugs could today. Well, Iommi wasn't to such an outrageous extent, and you know he's the mastermind.\n",
        "\nEver since the proper vocalists became a part of Black Sabbath, the band\u2019s sound had more or less become accessible (that\u2019s not to say that there haven\u2019t been exceptions; think of the ugly, yet appealing Born Again, or the doom-laden behemoth Dehumanizer), but repetition has rarely been part of the band\u2019s repertoire. The Tony Martin years, too, had proven to be more of a versatile timeline of the band that some people give them credit for. Unfortunately, versatility doesn\u2019t always result into quality and Headless Cross is a good example of such. Whereas The Eternal Idol sounds fairly down to earth and Tyr has evocative epics in store, Headless Cross reminds me of something that could only have been written in the 80\u2019s and is best forgotten.\n\nBased on the titles, you\u2019d think that Headless Cross would be a darker and gloomier than The Eternal Idol. Come on now; titles like \u2018\u2019Kill in the Spirit World\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2019Black Moon\u2019\u2019 sound more promising titles than \u2018\u2019Hard Live to Love\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2019Born to Lose\u2019\u2019, don\u2019t they? Don't be fooled; rarely does Headless Cross deliver and whereas its predecessor shares its lightweight moments as well, it at least sounds more nuanced. Here you get \u2013 spoiler alert; two highlights and the rest has its moments or sounds downright awful. Combined with some abysmal performances, I\u2019m rather surprised how well Headless Cross has been received over the years. But seriously; \u2018\u2019Kill in the Spirit World\u2019\u2019 is so bad that had Ozzy Osbourne heard it, he would have been glad to have been fired from the band. It\u2019s a fluffy rock number with Tony Iommi\u2019s feather light guitar work that makes \u2018\u2019Paranoid\u2019\u2019 sound like \u2018\u2019Into the Void\u2019\u2019. It also features Geoff Nichols playing some of the most tasteless keyboard riffs that I could think of and even Tony Martin\u2019s delivery ranges from laughable to pure crap on this one (what\u2019s up with that nonsensical chorus, anyway?) Comparably, \u2018\u2019Call of the Wild\u2019\u2019 sounds slightly better for a while; partially spooky and partially foreign sounding (cool lick there, Iommi\u2026I only wish you had used it in a better song instead). The verses sound shady and promise a lot, but once you get to that karaoke chorus, the whole thing turns into a laughable mess. \n\nWhat I find even more frustrating is how the actual highlights aren\u2019t just outstanding on the album, but remain some of the best cuts from this era to begin with. The title track gets supported by some massive riffs and shows that Tony Iommi is still capable of delivering the goods once he\u2019s determined to write something heavy. Tony Martin, too, sounds in top form here; his blistering high notes add a certain amount of tension to the story of the song. \u2018\u2019When Death Calls\u2019\u2019 is something rather different, but it\u2019s another favorite of mine. Like a macabre hymn of emotional power, it\u2019s a dynamic power ballad that allows Tony Martin to demonstrate his vocal range. You\u2019ve got these eerie verses that resemble death approaching, a loud the chorus and the tensed bridge where Tony Martin goes wild between Tony Iommi\u2019s distinctive and melodic guitar chops.\n\nEven though I\u2019ve given Headless Cross several chances over the years, I\u2019m just not convinced that there\u2019s much else to praise. \u2018\u2019Devil and Daughter\u2019\u2019 reminds me of \u2018\u2019Glory Ride\u2019\u2019, because it resembles another journey towards nowhere land. You\u2019d think that Tony Iommi would make this boring trip just once, but the result is another galloping song that riff-wise has very little substance to it. \u2018\u2019Nightwing\u2019\u2019 is another frustrating song and even though its chorus has a majestic quality to it, you\u2019ll unfortunately have to deal with these sleepy verses where practically nothing happens. You get the deal\u2026Headless Cross seems like a dark album on the surface, but do you really think that Satan would approve of something that sounds as silly as this? You bet he wouldn\u2019t.\n\nThis review was originally written for antichristmagazine.com\n",
        "\nWhile Sabbath may be known for crafting 48 songs over a six album span, they must also own up that they crafted 32 songs over four other albums ( 8 on Technical Ecstasy, 10 on Never Say Die, 2 on Reunion, 12 on 13 ) that all pale in great comparison to those six albums. If people are going to act as if the post-Ozzy eras never happened for reasons only attributable to insanity, then they must confess that most of those final 32 songs also barely possess the right to wear the name Black Sabbath on its sleeve.\n\nThe two studio songs from Reunion and two of those three studio albums ( Technical Ecstasy & 13 ) certainly deserve their notorious derision, but Never Say Die is unfairly lumped in with them. Unjust due to the album being significantly more energetic and fun, instead of the mostly dreary previous album and the woeful follow-up 35 years later. As a Black Sabbath album in the purest sense? Not exactly within the vein of those six landmark albums, it still deserves to bear the bands lofty name because since when has Sabbath concerned itself with only being a heavy metal band?\n\nNever Say Die, just like its predecessor, is absent of the doom heaviness Sabbath was known for. The album not only features next to no real metal moments but the second side of the album is devoted almost entirely to swinging rhythms and hook laden grooves. This leads to what makes this album fail.\n\nThe real issue is how it ebb and flows throughout; side one features more uptempo songs but they all suffer by way of less memorable melodies. Never Say Die is energetic, perhaps the most consistently fast song ever recorded during Ozzy\u2019s tenure but still boring. Hard Road & Junior\u2019s Eyes are tragically awful, showcasing a band desperately searching for a commercially successful single. Not only were both songs A-sides on their respective singles, both are obvious down to the exact tempo. In the past when Sabbath did this same thing it still featured that doom-laden heaviness, here it is replaced with the band branching dangerously close to showtune territory. But what of the other song on the albums first side?\n\nJohnny Blade is the only song on the albums first side that is a staple of the bands songwriting prowess; you know the type, two completely different songs sutured together with awe-inspiring passages that sound like they always belonged. Every song on side two of the album, with the exception of Over To You, fits that description. Shockwave & Swinging The Chain are both very brief ideas/songs sutured together but where the individual sections are so completely different that their seamless flow is a testament to the bands progressive tendencies. The buzz-saw like guitar in the interlude and final minute long coda of Shockwave by themselves is worth more than the entirety of both the Technical Ecstasy & 13 albums.\n\nJunior\u2019s Eyes, as I wrote above, was the other single and is the weakest track on the whole album. Wretched vocal performance, just like Over to You, and the most basic of all the compositions, but considering that Sabbath were intending to release a ballad as a single, they should not have gone with this drivel but with the absolute highlight of the entire record: Air Dance. \u2026 In just over five minutes, the band delivers one incredibly eclectic masterpiece. Complete with dreamy and godlike piano playing by Don Airey throughout, the band reminds everyone of their splendid songwriting prowess. The fact that the final three sections comprise more then half of the song and has no vocals is not to downplay Ozzy here because it is his vocals that make this track truly special. His heartfelt wails embodying the character like only he could, this style suits him well. Yes it is a ballad where he normally does not shine but the vocal melodies have a rather rapid succession to them, a much more suitable range for Ozzy in this era.\n\nSo Never Say Die is mostly drawn down by inconsistent writing, every time the band picks up some serious steam, they are dragged down by dreadful compositions. Never Say Die & Johnny Blade are a very effective one-two punch to open the release but Junior\u2019s Eyes & A Hard Road are momentum killers, as if they came from a completely different writing session. After those two duds come Shockwave & Air Dance, which are latter era Ozzy highlights but then is followed by the awful momentum killer Over To You. The record does recover at the end with the rather fun and Jazz-laden Breakout/Swinging The Chain, but also show just why this incarnation of the band was destined to end with this album.\n\nHaving the initial Ozzy era end with a saxophone driven Jazz instrumental and then a song sung by drummer Bill Ward shows just how fractured the band and songwriting was for this release, the original Sabbath\u2019s true swansong. Speaking of Bill Ward singing on the albums closing track does make this record historic; because both Geezer and Iommi contribute vocals during Hard Road, this is the only album to feature lead vocals by all four original members. On the point of fractured songwriting, considering the original four members would only record one more song in the intervening four decades, that being the subpar Psycho Man from Reunion, makes those awful notes sung during Over To You be the dying moans of this once proud musical institution as it was meant to be. How fitting it is\u2026\n\nThe album is definitely better than Technical Ecstasy & 13, more upbeat than Master Of Reality, with its highlights being on par with any album not named Sabotage or Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, but those low points are shockingly bad. There is no moment of the album that is cringe worthy embarrassing like heard on Technical Ecstasy, or sleep inducing boredom like heard on 13 but those low points drag the album below the classics. If you subtract Junior\u2019s Eyes, Hard Road & Over To You, you might end up with a vastly different(see: improved) impression of the album.\n\nHighlights: Air Dance, Johnny Blade, Shockwave, Breakout.\nShadows: Junior\u2019s Eyes, Hard Road, Over To You.\n",
        "\nThis was a very controversial album for a while. In the mid-90s Black Sabbath was relaxed and the original line-up was gone. Buttler left the band speaking ill of the riffmaker saying he was lowering the quality of their music gradually. On the other hand, Tony Martin expressed the desire to reinterpret this album and believed that Forbidden was shit because of the background that surrounds it, and especially because he was not focused at the time of voice recording; for that simple plain reason, Tony considers Forbidden a lost album. All this he said in an interview and was enthusiastic about reinterpreting it and was convinced that has the ability to do it much better. Tony was even surprised that there are people who like this and found something that really worked. \"How can you like that?!\", he said. And I say: Time Tony, time puts things in their place.\n\nThe once last album left a bittersweet taste in the best of cases among the followers. This one was massively lambasted by the critics of the time who used as the main argument the inclusion of members of Body Count in the making of the LP. While the record isn't amazing, it has the feeling of being hastily cooked but the product has aged really well 27 years later. The passage of time rewarded the once-maligned production of Ernie C whose sound is clear and forceful and quite in keeping with the undeniable avant-garde 90s sound, but faithful to their style or at least faithful to the Tony Sabbath era. 1995 was one of the heydays of grunge and these sirs had to evolve in order to avoid the impact on their ancient music in the non-pejorative sense of the word. Songs like \"Can't Get Close Enough\" or \"Shaking off the Chains\" evoke the dominant Seattle Sound of the moment. The opener \"The Illusion of Power\" has the collaboration of Ice-T in the choirs, with raps included. If you think \"Shaking off the Chains\" sounds like a rap of dubious origin just for the vocals following the main riff, then what about Iron Man, NIB, Electric Funeral, and half of the songs by the Ozzy era? Now, this album has an improvable production, it's the only complaint I could have.\n\nHowever the real highlights are Guilty As Hell, Rusty Angels and Kiss of Death. They not only bring together the best of Tony Sabbath, which is saying a lot, but the best of all their lineups as well. Tony's comeback seems to revitalize their liveness to unimaginable limits and his innovative spirit really shows the efficiency in his vocal leads. It needs to be emphasized that \u201cRusty Angels\u201d is a pop metal-oriented about a tale of a warplane graveyard, while the title track \u201cForbidden\u201d is fueled by a powerful heavy riff from Iommi and Geoff Nicholls' standout keyboard. Another fact you should not ignore is that Iommi had been involved in the production and mixing of their records since the years of Rodger Bain, however, the riffmaker didn't contribute to the production on this one and then he criticized the producer's work saying that the sound was not very good and they weren't satisfied with it. Yet this album could end up being more different than it currently is because these sirs left out many of Ice-T's ideas, and Tony remade a lot of things and probably managed to change things more or less the way he wanted them.\n\nBeyond the perception they have in this album, don't believe in the hate of fans, 13 is really worse than Forbidden: it's repetitive, boring, with no imagination, and therefore with nothing to offer. At first glance they just wanted to fulfill the commitment to reunite the original lineup. Forbidden at least represents a more honest and fresher vibe, with great Iommi's riffs and very memorable cuts that distinguish the Iommi-Martin-Powel-Nichols-Murray style. In my particular point of view, the worst Sabbath album is 13, including Ozzy himself who only babbles on the songs. I thought it was going to follow the same line as The Devil You Know which was excellent, heavy and at times dark\u2026 then with 13 they lowered the level a lot: it seems like a rescue of lost unreleased songs in the early 70s but deceptively remastered. Forbidden is experimental and somewhat removed from traditional heavy metal yet it's not bad at all, it has the master's great riffs and Tony's fantastic voice\u2026 with Powel's arsenal! What more can we ask for? Not bad, this is far from damn bad, beats Never Say Die and Seventh Star but still below Technical Ecstasy which was more lysergic.\n",
        "\nThere has been said much about this album and before entering the bowels of it, I have the duty to summarize, invariably, how 13 is a work that could have been better and how it could easily end up being infinitely worse. I can't help but conclude that the balance is quite unfavorable and to be honest, this is the worst Black Sabbath album ever recorded, even worse than Never Say Die, their weakest album in the entire normal period before they split up in 2006. No, this is not better than Forbidden or Seventh Star or Technical Ecstasy, albums that at least were honest and faithfully reflected the musical inspiration that the God Iommi was directing with his golden strings. But seriously speaking and beyond the cheesy quibbles, those hair metal albums are far better than this. It is not remotely decent and it's insulting to compare this with its \"predecessor\" The Devil You Know, so let's see the indisputable reasons that tell us about a record as significantly usable as predictable that led them to this sad farewell. I seriously want to believe that this album should never have existed.\n\nFirst of all, reading the song titles makes me imagine a powerful potpourri of things. The songs are clickbait and look powerfully promising. It looks like the \u201clost\u201d seventh album that could have been released after Sabotage and before Technical Ecstasy. One would imagine that this one spews misunderstood paradoxes from its first beats, something that only the greats can brag about inexcusably. You may discern if 13 really sounds so classic and so old, or on the contrary, if it's something extremely surprising in the disappointing sense of the word. I really tried to like this, I gave it forty listens to find out any magic vintage harvested by Iommi's deified fingers, the drummer (is it though?) and the bassist (the only one that plays a worthy role in this coldly calculated set). Even after forty listens, it's still not clear to me. It's so ambiguous. At first glance, the result could be 100% authentic music with no hint of scam, fraud, or violent poof; but on the contrary, it's a non-negotiable verdict for loyal fans like me who assume that the \"Black Sabbath is back\" slogan is not enough considering the fact that an album must be conceived by the most sincere of attitudes. Thus, dealing with three billionaire grandpas who owe nothing to anyone is commendable: quality and good ideas above any other consideration, and also, attitude and respect for whoever buys your records. Clearly, 13 can't be compared to anything they did with early Ozzy and it's infinitely below the average of what Black Sabbath have done in their entire career with any lineup. You may think there are 53 minutes infested with clear ideas correctly articulated, impeccable professionalism, and no weird experiments as anyone expected, but this sounds so monochrome that instead of turning the sabbath black and shaky, it turns gray and bootless.\n\nThe songwriting is so rigid and so monolithic that the only song that dodges this parameter is \u201cDamaged Soul\u201d. Then, \"End of Beginning\" begins as a festival of boredom and misery, turning the sabbaths grayer or less fun. The complaint here is not that the tracks are too long and boring, and it's not a matter of haven't listened to Black Sabbath, Paranoid or Master of Reality. For whatever it was, I would accept someone coming with a more solid argument that honestly justifies it while I'm baring the musical value of this. It's not that they're slow, long, lethargic or whatever, this goes beyond the concise premises of a canonical example of doom metal. Anyone who justifies it can say that Sabbath with Dio was something else, but Sabbath with Ozzy should sound like this and it's good that they did it. But no. \"God Is Dead\" left me indifferent, and it may be Ozzy's best vocal performance but saying that Iommi rules with his incombustible leads is something else. These songs present the most lackluster performances ever but this may sound like true Black Sabbath for the unwary, although it would be unfair not to rescue the last two plausible songs. \u201cLoner\u201d traverses the gloomy dark swamps that evoke those traversed ones in Vol 4 or Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, as well as in N.I.B. However, the oneiric \"Zeitgeist\" tries to highlight how these guys work hard to keep their legacy as it reminds of Planet Caravan or Solitude, and their objective is to recall the legendary saga of lysergic interludes in order to blow your mind on the next track, but \"Age of Reason\" honestly doesn't meet expectations: it's unremarkable yet I'd be lying if I don't say that the bass has one of the best lines in the whole work.\n\n13 is a bland, monochromatic and uninspired album. Delving into that, many may think that the self-titled debut is like that too, but that's blasphemy, we can't extrapolate the low brilliance of this album with the glory of their massive debut. It's understandable that it's too unfair to defecate on someone's work when the intentions have been the best, beyond the \"complications\" that interfered in its gestation, because Iommi showed that he had balls enough in The Devil You Know, which in my opinion should have been released under the name of Black Sabbath as a collaborative, farewell album. Forbidden went much more unnoticed than this and was for a long time a dignified, discreet, and honest farewell until this sad offspring was born. I was really hoping for more honesty from Iommi, but his mistake is forgivable, he's the godfather of heavy metal. However, if you want a more natural and entertaining record, get Purple's Now What?! released in the same year.\n",
        "\nThe 80\u2019s marked the start of inconsistent line-ups, sounds and production values for Black Sabbath. It\u2019s as if Tony Iommi kept adapting more to his singer\u2019s styles rather than the other way around and just couldn\u2019t stick to one sound on a consistent basis. By 1987, Tony Martin was introduced to the Black Sabbath crew; resulting in yet another side of the band that was previously unheard of.\n\nTo start things off with, the production is ideal for what Black Sabbath (or rather, Tony Iommi) was aiming for; allowing every instrument to shine with purpose. The drums sound enormous, while Bob Daisley\u2019s bass pops up for an occasional extra fat edge and Tony Iommi\u2019s guitar tone makes The Eternal Idol an accessible listen. This album also welcomes Tony Martin on vocals and despite singing Ray Gillen\u2019s vocal lines, his delivery sounds rather elegant and emotional. Strangely enough, I\u2019ve heard people compare his delivery to those of Dio, but I just don\u2019t get that. Dio was quite a versatile singer who could switch between a cleaner approach and dirty distortion. The latter certainly isn\u2019t a part of Martin\u2019s repertoire...so the next time you hear someone claim that they\u2019re identical singers, just tell them to clean their ears.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s all about the songs that make or break an album (who would have thought otherwise?) and in this case, we\u2019re fortunately dealing with more goodies than garbage. \u2018\u2019The Shining\u2019\u2019 introduces things nicely, even if it's a puzzling introduction. Clearly lacking in scope to be considered an epic, yet full of twists and turns, it's quite a journey of a song. You\u2019ve got an ethereal introduction that promises something colossal, but once Tony Iommi quickly makes up with a simple pounding main riff, it\u2019s clear that the track was meant to be an ear worm. Yet, my favorite moment has to be the tune\u2019s bridge; where Tony Martin shows what his pipes are made of (my guess would be gold, but I\u2019m not a vocal expert) and harmonizes through the smooth licks that Tony Iommi laid down for him. Although based on the novel with the same name, you have to admit that sonically speaking, this track doesn\u2019t really recapture a horror flick by any means, but I guess that naming it \u2018\u2019The Rainbow\u2019\u2019 would have been a bit silly, wouldn't you say?\n\nFrom here, The Eternal Idol shows its different sides and thus, also varies in consistency. At its most serious, you end up with semi-epics by the name of \u2018\u2019Ancient Warrior\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2019Nightmare\u2019\u2019. The former isn\u2019t very Sabbath-esque per se, but the foreign landscapes that the track exposes are quite something to behold. You\u2019ve guessed it; it\u2019s the most evocative song here; thanks to the mythical lyrical passages and melodic, yet well-crafted riffs that take the listener to the realms of old. \u2018\u2019Nightmare\u2019\u2019 is another good one and actually sees Tony Iommi reaching back to his trademark groove of the Dio era, only to speed up with dramatic effects once Tony Martin starts to repeat the song title during the tune\u2019s tensed climax. Unfortunately, there are times when The Eternal Idol reveals its age. Come on now: \u2018\u2019Hard Live to Love\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2019Glory Ride\u2019\u2019 and are strong reminders that this came out in the 80\u2019s and while I don\u2019t mind metal to sound somewhat dated, these tracks sound extremely superficial. \u2018\u2019Hard Live to Love\u2019\u2019 has Tony Martin singing some of the silliest lyrics that I could think of (and I don\u2019t mean that in a fun way), while Tony Iommi plays some sleazy riffs that are a far cry from his best post-Ozzy work. \u2018\u2019Glory Ride\u2019\u2019 isn\u2019t quite as awful, as it relies on a crunchy main riff that has some meat to it, but it doesn\u2019t take long before Tony Iommi starts to gallop through the verses on auto-pilot. \n\nSaving the weirdest cuts of the album for the last, The Eternal Idol ends with two contrasting songs and honestly, the results are fairly mixed. \u2018\u2019Lost Forever\u2019\u2019 is an unexpected blast of captivating speed metal and again, it doesn\u2019t bring back classic Black Sabbath\u2026but that\u2019s no issue to me. Tony Martin wails with conviction as always, while Tony Iommi plays some mean riffs before the track reaches that heavy-as-hell break in between. The title track does something completely different; as it sees Tony Iommi looking back to the 70's for inspiration...but it was clear that during the this period, he was better off playing something different. Not only does the track sound way too self-conscious with a main motif that recall the band\u2019s iconic \u2018\u2019Black Sabbath\u2019\u2019, but with someone like Tony Martin on vocals (who, as great of a singer as he is, sounds far too civilized to scare you), you end up with something too forced for its own good.\n\nWhile some consider The Eternal Idol to be a lost classic and others are convinced that it hasn't aged well, my opinion of it falls somewhere in the middle. It's undeniably a flawed record that features some serious questionable tunes, yet it's worth spinning from time to time...so take that as you will.\n\nThis review was originally written for antichristmagazine.com\n",
        "\nThe most fitting place to begin is directly at the beginning where everything started. This takes us all the way back to the year of our lord 1970 with the very first record of the self-titled Black Sabbath. Before I get into this I need to get into some history, first we have to acknowledge the fact that Tony Iommi spent a brief time frame with the band Jethro Tull and the way in which Iommi enjoyed handling things were very different then Jull. And Ian Anderson was the leader the man. He was basically telling and calling the shots and that went directly against Tony Iommi's personal philosophy, however his experience taught him that he really wanted this and if anybody really wants to succeed in the record business you have to work hard at it.\n\nBlack Sabbath at one point was initially called Earth before the name we all recognize. The name Black Sabbath came from the name of a movie that was being shown in a theater around where the band was currently located. Strangely enough they had to change their name because another British band at the time had that name. It is strange that 30 years in the future in the 1990s another band would arise with the name Earth and would develop some underground cult success. Almost as though assuring in a new wave. Black Sabbath ushered in heavy metal in general and Earth thirty years later would help perpetuate the modern drone movement. Black Sabbath as a debut can sometimes seem like a mess. Can sometimes seem like they're just random jam sessions by a couple of hippies that decided to use tritons as opposed to your traditional sounds from your guitars. And with vocals that almost sounded like they were being shrieked by a guy that had no purpose being a vocalist. \n\nThere are reasons for that too. It's the fact that this album had only two days to record and one of those days was mixing (so basically in 24 hours not only did they have to have their material and gear, but they also had to perform it and get it down on tape) that way it can be mixed the next day and then the LP could be shipped. Quite the daunting task (one would think) however the result is actually what many people would consider to be the first true heavy metal album of all time. Forget all the proto metal ideas. This was the real deal. The real legit idea. Heavy metal in its infancy.\n\nThis is the after birth. Ladies and gentlemen. Black Sabbath's self-titled record is the after birth of heavy metal's inception, creation, and eventual outpouring out of the womb of musical motherhood. This is the album that does bring us of course the \"Black Sabbath\" track and also the wildly popular \"The Wizard\". These songs were all done in one fell swoop and whenever you listen to it at some points it can seem a little jumbled up. It can seem a little disjointed. It can really take you on a harrowing journey where you feel disconnected with your body and your mind but that's exactly the way that Black Sabbath really intended this release to sort of be. That's how they intended their sound to sort of feel like. For this particular generation it was supposed to be something completely dark. Something completely different. Really it was something that's supposed to be influenced by the macabre. The HP Lovecraft's of the world. Ideas that you never once really saw explored in music whatsoever. There might be darkened themes in the music of the past however it was not something that was as direct and as potent as was heard on the self-titled Black Sabbath album. For the first time in many young individuals and old individuals lives they heard music that genuinely scared them. That was the allure. That was the draw. That was the acclaim, however it wouldn't be until their second album where Black Sabbath will start to feel not only success but also the controversy that comes with it.\n",
        "\nIf ever there was a truly bad album in Sabbath\u2019s catalogue. I am sure this record has its fans, for anytime a band has a discography as extensive Sabbath, there are certainly albums that fail to reach critical or commercial success for different reasons. Even more certain are the fans that come to appreciate those albums, even if for nothing than wanting to champion its under-performing nature. I doubt many of the albums fans can argue much of the criticisms this album has lauded. \n\nEven the proponents of this release recognize that if a different band name accompanied the artwork, it would be obscure. It simply cannot stand on its own without its flaws being glaringly obvious. Because this is Sabbath however, Technical Ecstasy has the abject placement of succeeding six vanguard albums that redirected the course of music history. Certainly no easy act to follow and since it was the first true blunder of the bands output, it is doomed any way you try to approach the release.\n\nNow while that reason is valid, it does not change one clear fact about this album; even the quality tracks (there are a couple) are weak and characterless. Ward\u2019s drums are flatfooted, Geezer\u2019s bass is just wallpaper and Iommi\u2019s progressive tendencies are not reeled in. I normally appreciate diversity and the album does show some variety but none of it sounds organic. It sounds like a strong songwriting team fracturing as a result of several things all converging at once. So no focus can be found and while I normally adore Sabbath for their eclecticism, this album is consistent on one thing and that is what I dislike the most. SLOW TEMPOS!\n\nI DO appreciate doom metal for what it is, but I simply cannot bear the vocals of Ozzy when the songs are slow. This is supposed to be Metal and, regardless of what adjective you wish to preface the genre with, the one element most associated with metal is energy. Where is the energy here? There are a couple of moments and, what do you know, they are the best songs. Fortunately, all three are grouped together between tracks 4 - 6. Gypsy, All Moving Parts (Stand Still) & Rock And Roll Doctor are the best these eight songs have to offer.\n\nThese songs work because they move along fast enough for the creation of easy vocal melodies, where Ozzy shines best. Contrast the funk-laden Rock And Roll Doctor, complete with resplendent piano by Gerald Woodruffe, with the aggravatingly wearisome You Won\u2019t Change Me, complete with abhorrent vocals by Ozzy. He snivels in a discordant manner throughout this song and the unfortunate interlude of Backstreet Kids, which goes to prove my point. Backstreet Kids, when moving at a fast pace, was shaping up as a decent opener and one of Ozzy\u2019s better performances of the record. As soon as he has to stretch out his vocal expression during that unfortunate interlude, it becomes like Mount Tambora levels of catastrophe. Another perfect example is with album closer, Dirty Women. It is said to be another highlight but I fail to see how anyone can claim that. It is seven minutes of plodding repetition, with a hook that goes nowhere, horrendous vocals, but the lone moment is exhibits any kind of energy Ozzy suddenly sounds respectable. It is not all on the Ozzman here however since the bands also fails spectacularly. The final two minutes are incessant noodling by Iommi as if the song is meant to blunder aimlessly around as if begging to be put out of its misery.\n\nEven It\u2019s Alright sung by Bill Ward proves it was not all Ozzy\u2019s fault. While Bill certainly sounds better than Ozzy would have on this song (the reason why below), it is still a pointless and meandering ballad that fades out like an old dry leaf blowing into a sewer drain. Absolutely none of the music here stands out as worth your time. So how do I know Bill sang that ballad better than Ozzy would have? Well\u2026 Ozzy does not do very well when having to carry a slower moving composition but then add in sap coated balladry and it is a recipe for disaster.\n\nWe have reached transcendence on repugnant performances by someone I am told deserves the highest extolment as a vocalist. As I have disclosed many times, possibly to the point of annoyance for any reader, my favorite part of Black Sabbath is their eclecticism. Their desire to include everything they can under the Black Sabbath name, however She\u2019s Gone is proof that variety for the sake of it does not always work. I am not inherently against this or any other type of ballad, even by a metal band, and the music of this song is rather idyllic. However if I wanted to listen to a band that falls somewhere within the realm of rock go full on Barry Manilow than I would listen to Styx. At least there Dennis DeYoung is a credible vocalist, this composition simply does not do Ozzy Osbourne any justice. I also think that it divulges this albums biggest defect, the songwriting is simply too spiritless for any band of this caliber.\n\nShe\u2019s Gone can be seen as the trifecta of the three true ballads during the Ozzy era, (Solitude & Changes being the first two). Not only are they the only true ballads this lineup did, they are all the same lyrically. A lost loved lyric, never a result of inevitable demise but of the brokenhearted variety. So as little effort as possible, yeah?\n\nDespite their melodramatic lyrics Solitude and Changes both work because the music was thick, heavy and extremely atmospheric or brooding with doom textures that it made songs both simultaneously different but still contextually authentic at the same time. For She\u2019s Gone the music is blissfully major and therefore contradicts the lyrical tone, in fact without the melancholy violin strings one would think the music was almost whimsical and enchanting. However, again, the music is only at fault to a point, this performance is the most embarrassing of Ozzy\u2019s tenure with the band.\n\nSo, to conclude, if this album had been made by an unknown band with an incompetent vocalist in the same year, it probably would not even qualify as \u2018metal\u2019. Most would never know it existed, but because it bears Black Sabbath\u2019s immortal moniker it is weighed against the rest of the material.\n\nTo further illustrate just how bad this album is, consider those that only accept the Ozzy era of the band; who refuse to accept any Sabbath recording without this particular lineup. In the minds of those fans, this album was the end of the bands golden era, ending a six album run and then nothing of note in the 45 intervening years up to this here review. So Technical Ecstasy stopped the innovative train dead in its tracks, and since they never again recovered from this here derailment, it deserves its routine placement as the worst album of at least the Ozzy era, if not for the bands entire existence.\n\nHighlights: Rock & Rock Doctor, All Moving Parts, Gypsy\nShadows: You Won\u2019t Change Me & Dirty Women\n\nEmbarrassment: She\u2019s Gone\n",
        "\nLet's face it, Dio's comeback in Dehumanizer seemed really short-lived, being an alpha helping hands, an aspect that definitely adds a spark to the band. Recordings were turbulent and Tony Martin almost came back in the middle of the process, but the result turned out quite satisfactory, registering as one of their heaviest albums ever. With Dio and Iommy gulping and ready to go on tour, the bombshell went off when Black Sabbath made a deal to open some shows for Ozzy Osbourne in Los Angeles, which was enough for Dio to leave the group for good. \"No, I'm sorry. I'm more proud than that\" he said. And that's when the good man Rob Halford went down with a parachute and became the temporary leader of Black Sabbath in order to save the country. After the dust settled, the band returned soon for another record, bringing Tony Martin back.\n\nCross Purposes came to the world with a more melodic and less heavy sound, also within the level of the previous works with the same vocalist, but with a more 90s sound which resulted in a great, consistent, well-produced album. This record also marks Black Sabbath's only album with talented drummer Bobby Rondinelli, who has played on Rainbow. Tony Martin put on record a very competent work again, while tracks are well alternated between more lilting and melodic moments, with few individual highlights but working better as a whole. There's no longer the 70s dark atmosphere that at times was rescued in Dehumanizer.\n\n\"Psychophobia\" is one of my favorites, like \"Cross of Thorns\", which is quite difficult to remember at first. \"Back to Eden\" and \"Evil Eye\", this last with Tony's great vocal performance, also attract attention. The opening track \"I Witness\" works well too, starting off with some energy, of course not comparing to the other gigantic opener classics. Finally, here is the advice to see and hear the great \"The Hand That Rocks The Cradle\". Black Sabbath enjoyed the recognition in the 90s of all the business, the press, the critics and the public, made up of anonymous beings like us and by musicians from bands that dominated the environment, from Soundgarden to Type O Negative or Cathedral, and the reasons are found in these songs: in \u201cInto the Void\u201d and all its intricate ways; in the unmistakable harmonica of \u201cThe Wizard\u201d; in the evil that will never be redeemed in the eponymous Black Sabbath; as well as in the storm that's unleashed every time they play on the difficult to verbalize Sabbath Bloody Sabbath.\n\nWe have a good album that pleases those not very demanding listeners. This may have been Tony Martin's end career on Black Sabbath, but they chose to record another record later: Forbidden, a mechanical disc, poorly produced, uninspired and very difficult to digest. We all know what happened from then on: they continued to get greater every day, to the point that for the umpteenth time Butler and Iommi gave us the opportunity to hear those reminiscences of their mother band in Heaven and Hell. Some so many and some so few, friends.\n",
        "\nAfter 3 albums in a span of 17 months, the third being the thinnest at progression, Sabbath would have been forgiven if they rested on what worked thus far and treated their creative output as a conveyor belt. Pumping out the same album with slight variations into perpetuity, but in only fourteen months they started the second phase of their first era. Never again would a Sabbath album be as heavy as they were on Master Of Reality but, fortunately, they would also never be that simplistic either. Four of the next five albums - beginning with this very release - all share one congruity and that is eclecticism.\n\nAs you might have guessed from the review title, not all of this inconsistent output is for the best. To review I will break the ten songs on this album down into three distinct sections. The first are the songs on this affair that are a streamlined style: Supernaut, St. Vitus Dance, Tomorrow\u2019s Dream. All maintain the same tempo, never straying too far from a base rhythm, with the exception of an interlude each. The songs all have great energy but are still the most basic of the songs presented here. These blatant attempts at hit singles (albeit with Iommi\u2019s signature doom-laden guitar tones) are all fun and uptempo that still possess songwriting grace. This is not a condemnation but I doubt many would find Tomorrow\u2019s Dream or St. Vitus Dance as stand outs were it not for Iommi\u2019s guitar tone.\n\nThe second section are two songs that do fit into the streamline style above but lack the one component and that is, ironically, heavy metal. Of these two songs? The second of the two is a continuation of an idea introduced on the previous album(Orchid). That was a classical flamenco piece, but Laguna Sunrise here takes the evolutionary step by adding garish keyboards and magnificent choir backdrop to the thick layering of gentle guitar lines from a classical acoustic. A beautiful interlude. Its other function is to break any potential monotony, allowing a chance to breathe before the next avalanche of doom graces the listener.\n\nThe first of these two songs however is Changes, and it is so unlike anything in Sabbath\u2019s catalogue that most metal heads distance themselves from it. Some see it as a step backwards since it is retreading previous ground(Solitude), however I cannot reach this conclusion, at all. Changes is definitely an evolution of Solitude. It is more polished for sure but the music put forth is incredibly doom-laden and sorrowful. Changes is not like the embarrassing She\u2019s Gone from Technical Ecstasy, the atmosphere here is so morose that it achieves the intended effect of pure melancholy. I freely confess to not being much of an Ozzy fan, but for all of my dismissal, Changes is one song I believe Ozzy performs better than any singer who has tried it, both in Sabbath or as a cover. It sounds like it was written with his overly emotional drawl firmly in mind and he reaches some incredibly poignant moments. I would go even further and say Changes is the greatest ballad ever sung in Ozzy\u2019s career, be it in or out of Sabbath, and is the best the band has done in any era of their existence as well.\n\nThe third set of songs, where the album really shines, are the most diverse: Snowblind, Cornucopia, Under the Sun & Wheels Of Confusion. Why these four? What makes them different? ... These four songs comprise a total of twenty-three minutes and three of them are buried deep within the grooves. Nothing speaks to an albums quality than when great tracks can be found in the back half. Most bands put their strongest songs at the front of the release, Sabbath bucked that trend by making their most progressive songs of the album hidden deep. Each of the four are vastly different from each other but also different from themselves as well. How is that possible?\n\nIf you read the title to Under the Sun it has an added subtitle of Everyday Comes and Goes, which has a purpose. It is a literal 75 second interlude placed directly in the middle of a song that was never as fast, kinetic or drum heavy as this interlude was. It also has a clear beginning, middle and end, so why was it here? It literally comes from nowhere, a first time listener is sure to be surprised by how quickly this interlude passes by. Moments like that are what was missing on the previous record. Cornucopia is another where there is literally five distinct sections in the composition, and, again, each one drastically different. The opening riff is not only heavier than every second of the Master Of Reality album, it is also the most evil sounding riff to ever grace an Ozzy era record.\n\nSince these four songs have the most energy I want to shout out this albums greatest contributor, Bill Ward. It should come as no surprise that Ward has his fingerprints all over these compositions. Not only is he shown respect in the overall mix, his Jazz/Swing flavored percussion is what makes these songs incredibly groovy. The drums throughout Supernaut sees Ward flawlessly alternate between brushes then traditional sticks. It might or might not be obvious upon first listen but is quickly realized how much of the fastest songs on this platter places Ward to a degree more important than Geezer Butlers bass. This is not to say Butler slouches as lyricist or demigod of the low-end, but not a great deal of the proceedings stand out because of any slick bass runs by Geezer. This is perhaps his most subdued album of the Ozzy era.\n\nIt might seem ironic to call an album\u2019s best performer the drummer when three of the ten tracks do not feature any, and two of the tracks that do are a bit standard, but he drives these songs with his perfect blend of heavy hitting and finesse. The two previous albums were streamlined (Paranoid) or simplistic (Master Of Reality) and I feel the compositions restrained Ward's ability to add his signature color. Amy Jazz percussionist will know that rule number one is \"you are always one hesitation away from solving all your problems.\" ... You see, keeping time is not at the forefront of most Jazz, it emphasizes taking the lead with artistic color and low end voicing instead of being reduced to just providing a backing metronome. This comes through on each of the four songs I put in the final section. Just like with the debut, Volume 4 really excels at showing the importance of Bill Ward to what made Sabbath so unique. Ward was a drummers drummer, a very expressive and fluid performer, who knew how to make even his repetitions stay engaging. For no matter how heavy and metallic Iommi and Geezer were making a song here, there is Ward playing in a way that is impossible not to groove with. Songs like St. Vitus Dance and Supernaut can be literally danced to on a ballroom floor, both of them are really only \"metal\" because of the use of distortion on the stringed instruments. The former even lends itself dangerously close to being useful as a Cabaret.\n\nEven though Master Of Reality is considered a classic, I think the band hit a songwriting low on it, and it can be argued that was because of the workload. Two albums and 14 original songs, along with 187 shows in just 12 months in bound to burnout any creative team. After the weak previous effort the band recovered by using some time off and observing the trends of the time to inspire them. While there were lots of bands only hard rock to Sabbath's heavy rock within their vicinity, the Sabbath members grew up with (and thus most inspired by) artists stylistically as far from the music they would eventually create as one gets. Considering this is only two years into their pro recording career, not much else existed in the world of heavy rock, so it should not be surprising to hear the outside influences filtering into the songwriting. Iommi might be the person who invented heavy metal but he grew up idolizing Frank Sinatra, and no one would confuse him with anything metal. Strip away the gain on those amplifiers and then one has to ask how much different is it really? Each member of Sabbath at this point were not just musicians on the job, they were full fledged songwriters, and write what you know describes a writer. These men wrote what influenced them, and outside of the 1972 era rock and roll world was a rising trend of Funk artists. Music that emphasized upbeat tempos, slick percussive-heavy songs that energized audiences; streamlined but full of energy and fun. Whereas Sabbath had been cold and somber in their previous two artistic creations, this album hearkens back to the debut not just by reestablishing Bill Ward but by being mostly warm and fun. Seldom choosing to beat you over the head with doom, instead baiting you into grooving out with crafty truly dance-laden patterns. Listen to the long interlude of Wheels Of Confusion or its spellbinding two and a half minute coda, titled The Straightener, for proof how groovy the album lends itself.\n\nHighlights: Supernaut, Under the Sun, Cornucopia\nShadows: Wheels Of Confusion, FX\n",
        "\nTell me how the first time I ever heard \u201cChildren Of The Grave\u201d that I thought the eerie outro voices sounded like Jason Voorhees. What better way to capture such a dark and eruptive disc of what many call the first true doom metal album than with a horror movie figure? It\u2019s no secret that Master Of Reality has a reputation for being the one that dropped everything down and executed its rhythms the way we know and love the genre today, even fifty years later. But how they managed to darken even the songs written in a lighter vein to a scarier degree is just mind blowing. \n\nSeriously, let\u2019s take a look at even the more welcoming tunes before us. \u201cAfter Forever\u201d should jump out immediately, being the infamous song around Christianity that still doesn\u2019t shed much light in the realm. The booming bass hooking onto the upbeat lead guitars may feel that way at first, but then it drops to a chugging note, eventually winding up in a stomping bridge. Going softer yet, you have \u201cSolitude\u201d which has always contained such a haunting feel. While yes, it is incredibly soothing, the woodwind instrumentation, spine-tingling bass, and hopeless vocal delivery injects a feeling of abandonment that I just can\u2019t ignore. Every little bell and string pluck makes a difference.\n\nNot abnormally jarring enough? I even think the simple acoustic interludes do the trick as well. \u201cEmbryo\u201d less so because it\u2019s over so quickly, but its odd placement of connecting the upbeat \u201cAfter Forever\u201d with the menacing drive of the main riff in \u201cChildren Of The Grave\u201d is what gets me; the suspense of knowing what is ahead of you. On the other hand, \u201cOrchid\u201d adds horn-like effects to the back of its acoustical mass to invoke the feeling of crashing into a proverbial barge while out at sea. On the surface, I wouldn\u2019t see this as intentional or even something everyone picks up, but it\u2019s hit me that way from day one. Even the fun number around smoking the reefer \u201cSweet Leaf\u201d dials the rhythms down into darker depths with the minor keys of execution.\n\nAnd then we have the parts that truly hold Master Of Reality to such heavy heights. The aforementioned \u201cChildren Of The Grave\u201d goes from pummeling rhythms backed by clanking kicks by Bill Ward to slow and menacing doom riffs laced with terror. The execution is so wonderful that you forget how simplistic and monotone a lot of this track is, and it goes on for just the right amount of time. Throwing any hint of a solo only into the end was such a power move that I feel like it could have gone on even longer and I wouldn\u2019t have complained. Like I already said, it\u2019s descent into that misty and chilling exit with whispers and distorted sounds depicts the entire record wonderfully.\n\nDriving this in even harder, that leaves two other dense bangers that hold the same weight but go a different direction. I like to think of \u201cInto The Void\u201d as the darker counterpart to \u201cFairies Wear Boots,\u201d as they both work so well as the closer in each of their respective albums. This one starts on the same type of catchy riff, but when it burns down to a slower boil, it melts everything around it to truly follow through with that message of rocket fuel burning the atmosphere. On the other hand, \u201cLord Of This World'' dials in those Hellish lyrics and slower tempos to drive everything home with the doomiest and gloomiest number on the record.\n\nAn album with only six songs and two interludes, with none of them being overly long, while achieving this much, and allowing it to stick together without any awkwardness is really the best way to describe something that is perfect. Set aside all of the influence, the \u201cfirst\u201d aspect, and all that would unravel later on. At an objective level, Black Sabbath hit their peak very early in the game, and it\u2019s one of those records that buries so many layers deep into the grooves.\n",
        "\nYou would think that bringing in Ronnie James Dio into the picture meant a merging of Black Sabbath and Rainbow, and one of the things that I love is that it simply is not. Can you imagine taking the disjointedness that was Never Say Die! and throwing that into the blender with their new frontman? Nah, a mess would ensue. So the only logical way to go is reinvent themselves, and in hindsight, there really wasn\u2019t much out there that sounded anything like Heaven And Hell. We had our Saxon\u2019s and Motorhead\u2019s of the time, but talk about paving the path for what I truly think would become USPM.\n\nThe most notable thing about this record is the way it consistently works with progression, utilizing that to work as a rising action to what would be the climax of not only a story, but also musical avalanche. The title track spends so much time riding on simple riffs, a steady bassline, and throwing vocals on the forefront. Yet never at any point does it feel like it drags, because you can just feel the drop coming, like a long ass rollercoaster. Even when you reach the solo, the resolution still doesn\u2019t happen until you reach the closing vocal lines, speeding up everything that came before.\n\nOther examples of this exist here, just to way lesser degrees. The acoustic intro for \u201cChildren Of The Sea\u201d does this in a more subtle way, coming in with a clean and colorful lick that leads to traditional Iommi-style riffs. What\u2019s extra fun is songs doing this the opposite way, particularly \u201cDie Young\u201d. That one rides primarily on faster passages only to drop everything in a jarring manner for a soft and soothing bridge. Synths do wonders for this song! Ending with \u201cLonely Is The Word\u201d was also a solid move, as it fits in the least and contains the bluesiest progression. It almost works as an open-ender to keep you looking forward to what\u2019s next.\n\nBetween all of this is straightforward tracks to allow Heaven And Hell\u2019s refined and powerful approach to break more ground. Varying these apart from one another manages to pack everything up to a point that the melodies stand out on their own and catch on very quickly. \u201cLady Evil\u201d of course is a steadier one that allows the bass to showcase itself decently, whereas opener \u201cNeon Knights\u201d goes the other direction and show\u2019s Black Sabbath\u2019s leap towards something far more intense without any sign of slowing. \u201cWishing Well\u201d nicely places solos into the chorus to hook the listener even more, while you get \u201cWalk Away\u201d working as a simple rock \u2018n roll number.\n\nThe impact that this had really doesn\u2019t need to be said. Much like when the band dropped that debut a decade earlier, they had basically re-reinvented the wheel. Sure, music of this type existed before, but Black Sabbath really solidified it here like they did with similar sounds of the late \u201860s prior. It\u2019s fortunate that the years following for the band would successfully follow in its footsteps, even if a bit uneven at times.\n",
        "\nIf you took the insanity aspect out of Sabotage, you\u2019d basically be left with what was Sabbath Bloody Sabbath. In other words, you\u2019d be left with something the littlest bit more consistent, dropping the weirdness to a lower weight on the scale. That amount is just perfect, because it\u2019s what lets this disc set itself apart significantly from what came before, but it\u2019s not jarring and tough to dive into (at least not for me). Everything on this, despite the sidestep, I find to be pretty accessible and listener friendly.\n\nAnd for that it is damn near perfect. Starting with the riffs alone, at the expense of a little bit of density, there\u2019s a refined feeling to them. But what\u2019s nice is Black Sabbath\u2019s ability to use the right method at the right time. The massive title track sounds all sorts of light and fluffy rhythm-wise, while also introducing a new vocal approach from Ozzy. That is, until you get about halfway in, and suddenly things drop to a deeper level of demonic animosity while the vocals jump up even higher. This type of contrast incorporation was key to making the fifth effort by Tony and co. one of the absolute best they ever did.\n\nOutside of that, the tracks stick to the warmer end of things for the most part. When they don\u2019t, the tones still feel a bit less threatening. Some may view it as a mistake, I see it as an enhancement. Obviously \u201cFluff\u201d is the standout that fits really none of this, the acoustic instrumental that\u2019s soothing in its own way but hardly fits anything else. But on a more fitting note, \u201cWho Are You\u201d is a glaring example of how one of the darkest, most bleak and dreary sounding numbers ditches traditional tone for entirely separate instrumentation. To me, it\u2019s as if \u201cAm I Going Insane?\u201d was more self-aware. Other classics that feel a bit more traditional to the doom style like \u201cSpiral Architect,\u201d or one of my personal favorites \u201cA National Acrobat\u201d warm up the guitars to deliver some of their most digestible material to listeners from any angle. That up-tempo bridge in the latter song grooves so much harder than it has any right to.\n\nWhich leads me to the songs that take that uplift and slap it on the entire track. \u201cSabbra Cadabra\u201d is such a fun example, as it doubles down on the bouncy passages without ditching any form of stable songwriting. Moreover, the incorporation of a piano on that was truly wonderful and added even more life. Same can be said for \u201cLooking For Today,\u201d one that I find to be very chorus-heavy in that its tempo strengths lie there. I\u2019d wager that \u201cKilling Yourself To Live\u201d is similar, taking a very serious concept and making light of it in delivery.\n\nIt\u2019s a lot to take in for sure, and that\u2019s the beauty of Sabbath Bloody Sabbath. It pairs well with its successor, acting as the focused version. Most of this is pretty common knowledge by now, but the similarities between these songs and how they go together is crucial. I\u2019ve loved this since my first time hearing it and I don\u2019t see that ever changing.\n",
        "\nWriting music around Satan wasn\u2019t anything new for Black Sabbath at the time, but what about an entire album focused around the concept? While it isn\u2019t a linear concept album in a story sense, the general feel is held together by that theme kicked off with a haunting \u201cGates Of Hell\u201d to get us moving. Moreover, the glam-like touches and pretty delivery would hint at romanticising evil, which I absolutely love. Tony Martin already proved his strengths as a Dio follow-up type prior to this record, but Headless Cross is where the band seriously shines during this era.\n\nMore specifically, I would argue that this record sports one of the best songs that Iommi and co. as a whole ever wrote in all eras. \u201cKill In The Spirit World\u201d encapsulates everything wonderful about the entire album. Packing what would normally work as an epic into a manageable five minute song is a smooth and welcoming riff build, light synth-backing, and vocal perfection on top of it. Yet during the bridge and solo, things take a darker turn before the resolution, almost acting like the Dark One is luring us in himself. Break this apart and spread it everywhere, and you\u2019ve got the peak of what is a perfect disc.\n\nSome of the most glorious parts of Headless Cross blend in the most contrasting angels. \u201cDevil & Daughter\u201d has a driving rhythm section backed by some of Cozy Powell\u2019s heavier clashing cymbals and faster drumming, but utilizes the synth fills to solid heights. Catch more of this in \u201cBlack Moon,\u201d reminding me a bit of \u201870s era Rainbow. Closing track \u201cRightwing\u201d does this by introducing itself on a fun acoustic jingle, working into doom metal riffage to finish on a memorable note.\n\nConsidering how clean everything is, softees are a promise. None really hold that the whole way through, but \u201cWhen Death Calls\u201d opens on the calmest note before unrolling into a doomier take, similar to \u201cRightwing\u201d. Brian May takes the solo once things kick in a bit, and I really can\u2019t complain here at all. The title track likely has the steadiest beat, easily falling on the warmer side of the spectrum, as does \u201cCall Of The Wild.\u201d The latter specifically hones in on some serious melodies, being one of the more chorus driven numbers.\n\nThe mixing of approaches being pulled off in about as smooth a manner as possible makes this excellent. The strong delivery of every part brings it to even more impressive heights, and taking the Satan concept and twisting it to feel less threatening allows it to stand out more. Instead, it works around fear, escape, coping, etc. showing the general aesthetic wonderfully. If you only listen to one of their albums from this era, let it be this one.\n\nOriginally written for Metal Inferno\n",
        "\nSome say that the sixth Black Sabbath effort was where Ozzy\u2019s vocals reached their peak perfection strictly because of the range used here. While that\u2019s objectively true, it isn\u2019t why Sabotage is one of my favorites, rather, the songwriting reached a cross between new levels of heavy and weird. This entire thing feels like a proverbial descent into madness the further you get, and it\u2019s so fucking eerie. All of that combined makes for potentially their most jarring release, a good way to cap off the era of perfect records before things headed down a bit.\n\nTo describe what I mean, I\u2019m unfortunately going to have to take a track-by-track approach for accurately showing the progression. Opener \u201cHole In The Sky\u201d doesn\u2019t appear any different than what was coming before, with its catchy doom-riff with noise approach. But its sudden cut into \u201cDon\u2019t Start (Too Late)\u201d sets everything into an uncomfortable motion. Now all of a sudden we\u2019re hitting levels of aggression that we\u2019ve never seen before with \u201cSymptom Of The Universe\u201d which everyone basically knows by now. It\u2019s the weird settle-down into colorful flowery acoustics at the end that keeps things going in an odd direction. \n\nThen enter the massive banger \u201cMegalomania,\u201d potentially my favorite, and the next phase of this spiral. It\u2019s an obvious epic that goes through several perfect sections, but I think people miss how dark and empty this song feels. The tone of it leaves an impression of being lost in a dark room with zero direction thanks to the haunting bass trickles, menacing leads, and echo-like vocal approach. Black Sabbath hit peak spooky vibes here and I feel like that gets missed far too often. It would be enough to drive anyone into the madness of \u201cSupertzar\u201d. This one took me forever to appreciate because of how it just sounds like a fifteenth century chant with heavy guitars, but said guitar lines are great. The only unfortunate part is \u201cThe Thrill Of It All\u201d being placed before it, because swinging from \u201cMegalomania\u201d into that would have been absolutely captivating.\n\nBeyond that, you reach the peak of the weirdness with \u201cAm I Going Insane? (Radio)\u201d. The chorus is weird enough as is, but then add in the weird instrumentation that feels like a distorted Magical Mystery Tour track. The screaming and laughing that closes us off into \u201cThe Writ\u201d basically acts as a return to reality. Had \u201cThrill Of It All\u201d been dropped to the back of that one, I think the flow would have made more sense. Listening to that lump of songs feels like being tossed into a dimension of different times and brought back, to the point that I forget who I\u2019m even listening to half the time.\n\nTruly, Sabotage is so fucking difficult to conclude in a structural format that isn\u2019t just breaking apart every track, and that\u2019s what I love so much about it. This is such a discomforting listen, despite being their heaviest up to that point. The songs have so little in common with one another outside of that descending insanity that I mentioned, and it\u2019s truly wonderful. Absolute masterpiece work of art.\n",
        "\nThe fourth outing by Black Sabbath simply titled Vol. 4 is one of those albums with unfortunate placing. Coming in between their doom metal masterpiece Master Of Reality and the weird but strong step forward Sabbath Bloody Sabbath makes it the overlooked middle child by many a person my age. Obviously plenty still love this one, but it gets a little less light because of that. I guess opening on an 8-minute song was a ballsy move, but it\u2019s a pretty perfect song.\n\nWhen people think of this record, it\u2019s more than likely they\u2019re thinking about the piano ballad \u201cChanges\u201d or the live staple \u201cSnowblind\u201d. Both are rightfully memorable, the former being yet another step into different territory for the band, the latter continuing the doom metal formula they had cemented into the universe. Then of course there\u2019s \u201cSupernaught,\u201d the gallop-drenched banger that acts as the flipside, completing the circle of singles that probably hold the catchiest choruses as well as taking the most credit.\n\nBut Vol. 4 has loads of treasure in the deeper cuts. The aforementioned opener \u201cWheels Of Confusion\u201d hearkens back to the phase-oriented songs that the debut struck so hard, swapping between the calmer and faster parts, before ending on a trippy dance-worthy note. If anything, this foreshadows their upcoming blend of evil and pretty colors that show serious fruition on the next two records. Of course \u201cSt. Vitus Dance\u201d fits the latter description so well from front to back, where \u201cUnder The Sun\u201d goes the total opposite way and burns everything to a hot crisp. That\u2019s probably the most sinister song on the entire album. \n\nAdmittedly, this outing lacks clear direction, but while it doesn\u2019t weave this into a consistency factor like the debut did, I do find the writing to be superior. Not only are the riffs themselves catchy all around, but the variety is executed wonderfully enough to overlook that tiny complaint. Well, that and the fact that \u201cFX\u201d is one of the most worthless things to appear on any album. You get the point, though. This is a bit of a transitional album that hinted at the weirdness of the next two while still holding the traditional doom candle that came before it.\n",
        "\nYears ago, I actually found myself liking this one a lot less than I do now only because of the hype around it being the first of the first. But the truth is, beyond Black Sabbath being the ignited spark that brought everything we all know and love as heavy metal, there\u2019s way more to it than just that. Maybe the title track is something we could chalk this up to. Since it\u2019s all anyone ever wants to talk about, we get this feeling that it\u2019s the only important part. Thankfully that just isn\u2019t the case.\n\nMatter of fact, \u201cBlack Sabbath\u201d might be my least favorite song off of the debut. I personally think more magic lies in \u201cBehind The Wall Of Sleep\u201d than anything else. Just because of the way it really emphasizes that whole \u201cthe spaces between\u201d factor. Let alone the fact that this riff is so catchy and utilizes the ascend/descend tactic of the same notes rearranged so wonderfully, but the bassy fills that gap Iommi\u2019s solos to the several different verses brings it to heights greater than anything the band did that year. Everyone by now knows how important the bass and drum combos were to this record; it\u2019s all over the place. But this is where it reached its peak performance.\n\nMoreover, a record as loose and chaotic as this one being able to hold the same exact vibe the entire run of it is fucking masterful. Like, that song is made up entirely differently from the opening title track, and between it you stick \u201cThe Wizard\u201d which is another step away, but they all fit together like a perfect jigsaw puzzle. \u201cThe Wizard\u201d is probably my second favorite track because of the contrast in heavy riffing with the upbeat harmonica and barrage of bass/drum combos holding it up. Add in the extreme shift in tone after the intro where Ozzy starts singing and you\u2019ve got yourself a banger and a half. \n\nThat\u2019s all without even mentioning any of the combo songs that run together as a giant noodly epic, making up at least half of the content on Black Sabbath. It used to bother the shit out of me until I was able to see the uniqueness of it. \u201cA Bit Of Finger / Sleeping Village / The Warning\u201d is such a monster! There\u2019s so much Led Zeppelin-esque wandering with Iommi\u2019s leads in the middle, taking several different moods to the point that you completely forget that there are lyrics. When the vocals come back at the end, it\u2019s like a resolution you weren\u2019t even looking for, and it took a while before I could appreciate the greatness of it.\n\nBlack Sabbath\u2019s debut is a weird one to take as a \u201cfirst metal album,\u201d and that\u2019s why I always recommend people start with Paranoid rather than this. It\u2019s an album that has been talked about and praised to death, yet for it being the first of its kind it\u2019s really not conventional to how the band would become. People will compare this to Cream, Uriah Heep, and other proto-metal acts, but I don\u2019t even think it\u2019s any closer to that than it is to KISS or Aerosmith. Nothing this loose while also being this consistent exists (at least in metal), and that\u2019s important.\n",
        "\nWant to talk about finding what was obviously being searched for for at least half a decade now? No matter how much I think the previous couple albums fared, there was an obvious lack of clarity for the future of Black Sabbath. While Seventh Star definitely aimed towards the right mark, the potential was realized with The Eternal Idol. By now, most know that this portion of Tony Martin\u2019s saga was what truly follows the Dio era in stylistics, but this is where I think the glammier touches reach peak fruition thanks to being blended enough to not irritate the general metal dork fanbase. \n\nBy that, I mean it\u2019s not as blatantly obvious as it was with the prior effort. Because of it taking the back seat, Iommi and Martin now have the opportunity to spread their wings in a more traditional metal backing without ditching the spoopiness of synth and warmer glazings. Moreover, the songwriting takes a (mild) step away from the accessibility that came before and works its way back into something a bit more conceptual in lyrics and sequential in musical passages. Naturally, we have a consistent disc with a pleasant makeup, loaded with hooky chops that vary greatly and clean vocals that couldn\u2019t fit better if they tried.\n\nWhat\u2019s amazing is that there\u2019s still so much to take away from. Even the doomy history of the band shines so wonderfully. The obvious monster in this case is the closing title track, which almost throws back to the earliest of the band\u2019s days under an \u201880s umbrella. \u201cAncient Warrior\u201d has the booming rhythm energy and hard drum pounds with the perfect touch of crawling leads, all topped off with some of the neatest melodies this band has had since Heaven And Hell. You can get this with a blusier angle in \u201cNightmare,\u201d feeling less threatening but equally stompy. \n\nOn the flip side, The Eternal Idol has an even balance of faster paced bangers as well as more hook-laced gems. \u201cHard Life To Love\u201d takes a harder stance with its powerful leads and galloping bridge, while opener \u201cThe Shining\u201d brings forth that same accessibility on an easier note. Some get a bit more to-the-point, and shine the vocals in a brighter way meant to capture a chorus driven number like the poppy \u201cBorn To Lose.\u201d \u201cLost Forever\u201d is an anomaly in its ability to come so close to a thrash metal tune while still fitting in so well, and that\u2019s just incredible.\n\nAlthough I think there\u2019s one record that tops this one in regards to the Martin era, the sweet concoction that came in 1987 is one that deserves the more recent praise it gets. It\u2019s another example of something being unfairly overlooked for so long, only for people my age to dig it up thanks to the internet and worship what rightfully is deserving. Stellar songwriting everywhere, wonderful consistency, and the mechanics of every musician is top notch.\n",
        "\nApproaching a record that I take great pleasure in talking about is always a fun time! Ian Gillan had a pretty large resume by now, between his own jazz-fusion band and Deep Purple. The same could obviously be said for Black Sabbath, despite this being where the lineup changes really start to get rapid. What\u2019s so special about Born Again though is the fact that both parties dipped their toes into something derivative of each respective artist\u2019s typical style. Iommi and co. had never really made anything this raw and dirty, and Gillan never put this much oomph in his voice prior, trading technique for aggression.\n\nMany will complain about those things, saying that the raw and mean approach under such a dirty production isn\u2019t pleasant, but I think both of those things are the charm. Moreover, for there only really being seven songs (plus two interludes), this thing covers a pretty large scope of territory. Opener \u201cTrashed\u201d has been one of my favorite songs by the band for a long time, dumping in thrashy (trashy?) riffs and letting the hot and sweaty atmosphere consume everything. The album doing no other tracks like this outside of \u201cDigital Bitch\u201d (the song\u2019s mildly lesser but still solid clone) would have potential to make me complain, but I\u2019m actually glad for it.\n\nI say this because the other songs do just as much with different materials. \u201cZero The Hero\u201d is more of an injection from the doom history, crawling in with a steady and heavy rhythm topped by catchy lyrics. Another personal favorite is \u201cDisturbing The Peace\u201d simply by how evil it sounds. Construction wise it\u2019s pretty basic, but the maniacal outbursts, explosive drumming, ear-shattering guitar wails, and ultimate hook into the cleaner bridge is just magical. Not enough? The title track works as a near-balled, simmering everything down as a step outside of the sauna that is this record\u2019s harsh air holding it all together.\n\nCould Born Again have been a bit better? Maybe. There\u2019s some glaringly corny stuff on here such as the aforementioned \u201cDigital Bitch,\u201d but all of these moments to me still matter and work the way stronger filler should. More importantly, it stands out so significantly from really anything else in the band\u2019s discography due to it being the least clean thing they\u2019d ever do. Considering that the vocalist is someone who normally hits your pristine highs and uses superior technique, it really made for something abnormal.\n\nOriginally written for Metal Inferno\n",
        "\nNeed I really touch on Side-A outside of the intro paragraph? By now Paranoid has basically become the staple go-to first metal album. Two of the radio hits I think are deserving of legendary credit. \"Paranoid\" is such an impressive pop/metal banger for being pulled out of nowhere, and \"War Pigs\" has some of the most advanced construction for its time. But I\u2019ll also say this; I think \u201cIron Man'' is has one of the most boring rhythm sections ever, and I hate that it became one of the biggest things the band ever did. I won't spend time being too grumpy about that.\n\nBut really, if that were all there was to it, I\u2019d probably throw this in the \u201cheavy metal starter pack\u201d bin and have little else to talk about. Side-B has some serious treasure; while the seasoned listener knows this, the surface level listener tends to let these be overlooked. I actually think this is also where the doom metal sound took greater fruition, giving way to the perfection achievement of this style on the next record. \u201cHand Of Doom\u201d (it\u2019s in the fucking title) lays the groundwork for our favorite slow-crawl style that erupts in a similar manner to \u201cBlack Sabbath,\u201d though I think the writing here is superior. I\u2019d also say Alice Cooper\u2019s \u201cBlack Juju,\u201d co-opted this, except that one adds the synths and even darker elements. Same type of layout, different approach.\n\nParanoid also knows how to run that way with a more basic idea, and that\u2019s where \u201cElectric Funeral\u201d enters, likely my personal favorite on the disc. That song gives off endless feelings of a melting atmosphere around you, and if Ozzy\u2019s terror-laced vocal delivery paired with the Iommi\u2019s burning thickness does nothing for you, then I\u2019m not sure what to tell you. Closer \u201cFairies Wear Boots\u201d is where we bring on the fun, looser element that kinda sports the biggest blues rock backing that made up the bands\u2019 roots. Not to mention, some of the greatest lyrics they wrote on the entire album are here.\n\nTrying to deny this of its legendary status would basically be criminal. Though I like it less than the other five of the first six records in this era, it has something for everyone. Is thinking \u201cIron Man\u201d is boring a bold statement? Yeah, probably, but at least it fits well with everything beside it. The second Black Sabbath record has its accessibility on the front side, and its true colors with deeper writing on the back side, and when push comes to shove, I\u2019m thankful for it.\n",
        "\nRemember all of that talk of Ronnie James Dio doing doom metal on The Devil You Know but me not finding it to be as great as everyone else? Well guess what, Dehumanizer is where I get my (better) dose of that. Considering this is the only Black Sabbath record from the \u201890s that\u2019s really anything I\u2019d call great, it also serves as a bit of direction in the midst of general confusion. No less, this is also probably the first truly doom metal album the band did since the mid-70s, and managed to sound closer to that genre\u2019s styles of the time period. \n\nSo it goes without saying that there\u2019s a lot for this to live up to. While Dio had already kinda started heading this way with Lock Up The Wolves, he managed to channel it over here alongside some stellar songwriting tactics. Never at any point does Tony Iommi lose his charm, heavily through the ability to remain riff focused but still having solos that just scream cleanliness and trade off with Ronnie in the foreground. This record as a whole is also the greatest example of some of the steadiest pace-progression they ever had. Nothing is overly jarring, and the way that they tend to start on slower, menacing riffs that work their way into a galloping frenzy is pretty fun.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that Dehumanizer completely ignores the frontman\u2019s roots. I absolutely adore \u201cTV Crimes\u201d because of its ability to lift him high and reflect the raw talent, as well as coat it with this undertow of terror that fits the rest of the record\u2019s approach. On a similar subject, opener \u201cComputer God\u201d hits us with the aforementioned slow riffage to start us on the right foot, following with one of the best guitar solos on the disc. Furthermore, there are some seriously hooky chops among us. The significantly warmer makeup to \u201cSins Of The Father\u201d is so memorable, and the chugging choppiness of \u201cMaster Of Insanity\u201d is a real earworm.\n\nWhile it may have taken a while to grow on me (mostly due to not being acquainted with the style when I was younger), I do think that the Dio-reunion record is an essential listen. It may not be my favorite subjectively, but it gets to spread its wings from so many different angles, and does more for me than Mob Rules does. Making that work in a completely consistent way almost always allows for a gem.\n",
        "\nIt\u2019s a weird world when a band opens on a song that so clearly reflects a lesser version of the opener on its prior album, but people somehow prefer it, aint? Ha! Sorry, I couldn\u2019t help but open on something spicy. Truth be told, there isn\u2019t really that much to say against Mob Rules other than that it doesn\u2019t do anything very different from what they did a year earlier. In my eyes, that\u2019s hardly a crime, but just something worth noting.\n\nScratch that, this one does something the prior album didn\u2019t do, and that\u2019s give us a trippy interlude track between the doomiest song on the disc and the greatest song on the disc. So let\u2019s talk about those. The title track I feel has always stood above the rest of this because of it breaking the general flow of retreading what we\u2019ve already heard. The vocals in particular here seem to have more grit than anything done prior. The focus was always on clarity rather than aggression, but it certainly peaks its head thanks to there being an extra push behind the rhythms. Such a strong note for Vinny Appice to show is harder colors as well.\n\nThough the rest of the album never reaches this amount of energy, there are still some other moments that do \u201cmore of this\u201d pretty damn well. \u201cSign Of The Southern Cross\u201d is the most doom song in the new era, and if anything eludes heaviest to what would come further down the frontman\u2019s career. You get a little of this in \u201cFalling Off The Edge Of The World\u201d tacked on the ends, but that one plays as more of a Tony Iommi showcaser. Some feel a bit too much like they\u2019re meant as filler, such as \u201cCountry Girl,\u201d but at least it\u2019s good filler, because not everything can be complex or an anthem, right?\n\nAt the end of the day, if Mob Rules is the worst \u201880s Black Sabbath album, then I\u2019d say that\u2019s a pretty damn solid decade for the band as a whole. Loads to take away from this disc, just not much that holds a light to Heaven And Hell.\n",
        "\nAmazingly, Technical Ecstasy isn\u2019t something that took overly long to grow on me despite it entering the last phase of weirdness amongst the Ozzy era. Though it\u2019s pretty obvious by now that Black Sabbath have stepped beyond the comfortable boundary for many, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a fault at all. Rather, the thing that holds this one back is the blunt lack of consistency in any way, shape, or form. If I heard all of these songs for the first time not knowing who it was, and you took away the vocals, I would assume it was a shuffled playlist.\n\nLiterally, not a single song on the entire first side holds anything in similarity sans Ozzy behind the mic. This is the weirdest mix of galloping rock \u2018n roll, dreary doomism, and Beatles-like power pop balladry. Now with that in mind, on an individual level all of these things are great. \u201cIt\u2019s Alright\u201d is such a soothing number with its smooth delivery and wonderful instrumental toppings. I also think \u201cYou Won\u2019t Change Me\u201d has a darker edge from the organ alone than anything else on the entire disc. And just the intro of \u201cBack Street Kids\u201d should give you an idea of how solid the upbeat rock number is.\n\nSide B is more or less a mildly diluted version of everything just described. In other words, far less memorable but strong enough when you revisit it, there just seems to be a missing link with the \u201cdoes this stick?\u201d factor. I suppose \u201cRock \u2018N Roll Doctor\u201d is immune (ha!) to that thanks to it having such a catchy chorus, but at the end of the day it\u2019s definitely one of the more throwaway tracks. Much like that, \u201cShe\u2019s Gone\u201d is a decent one that I can enjoy as well, but still falls short in comparison to typical Sabbath balladry. The only true exception here is closer \u201cDirty Women,\u201d a longer banger that shows the band\u2019s classic colors a bit more clearly than anything on here. (Cue up a sped-up \"Breakin The Law\" in that solo, amirite?)\n\nA plate of drastically different foods that mostly taste good is better than a plate of similarly dull foods that have zero flavor, and that\u2019s my weird way of summing up Technical Ecstasy. The first three songs and the closer hold the most weight for sure, but nothing here is offensively bad, it\u2019s just a bit poorly structured. If this awkwardness didn\u2019t show the struggles going on with Tony and co., then the next one certainly would.\n",
        "\nTruth be told, in the chaotic world that was Black Sabbath\u2019s existence in 1986, I\u2019m very glad that Seventh Star exists. Though it\u2019s widely seen by everyone (including the album art itself) as a Tony Iommi solo effort, I think it worked perfectly to transition us into the Tony Martin era. Gone is the hot and noisy atmosphere of the last album, and arrived is a similar vein to the Dio era structures but with that touch of glam that never surfaced until now, and a slight lean into AOR territory. \n\nMatter of fact, the actual writing is pretty all over the place, and I think that\u2019s really the main thing that holds this back from reaching the potential of the next two records to come, because boy is it stellar and pristine otherwise! There\u2019s a lack of one forward vision here the way that most Sabbath albums actually have, further cementing it as a transitional work that happens to just be loaded with chops. The title track actually gives me huge \u201cPerfect Strangers\u201d vibes, with its slower trudge under a clean surface and explosive rhythms. You can get the flip side of that on \u201cHeart Like A Wheel,\u201d taking the same approach and stripping away the fierce factor but adding the bluesy rhythms and lead rambling.\n\nBut like I said, there\u2019s a lot more going on. The classic \u201cNo Stranger To Love\u201d shines the glammy future and Glenn Hughes\u2019 AOR injections for a stellar radio-type ballad. Want a version of this not in ballad format? Cool! Have a slice of \u201cAngry Heart,\u201d a steady number that carries more weight but stays just as smooth. Sandwiching \u201cNo Stranger\u201d you have bangers going totally opposite with \u201cIn For The Kill\u201d and \u201cTurn To Stone\u201d which come close to \u201880s Judas Priest aesthetic.\n\nAll of this is truly wonderful, and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a single bad song on Seventh Star. It\u2019s just all over the place in dynamic, and I\u2019d go as far to say that it\u2019s a grower. This one took several years for me to appreciate at all, and up until about now to actually say I love it. Thankfully this seems to have a bit of a following that may not have been there prior. If nothing else, it works as a wonderful slide from Ian Gillan to Tony Martin.\n",
        "\nBlack Sabbath doesn\u2019t really have any albums that aren\u2019t at minimum \u201cgood\u201d save for Cross Purposes which I find to be completely forgettable. Oftentimes it\u2019s Forbidden that gets that title, but I actually think it\u2019s the best one out of the six albums that aren\u2019t \u201cgreat.\u201d Yeah, it\u2019s pretty obvious that Martin phones in his vocals, yes, there are some signs of tiredness, and yes, it\u2019s a little unconventional. But what\u2019s important is that I find this one to be more memorable than any of the lesser albums, even if not constructed particularly well. Lack of consistency probably didn\u2019t help out either.\n\nThe most glaring example is the opener \u201cThe Illusion Of Power\u201d which has vocal ramblings that we\u2019ve not seen often, and it features Ice-T which is completely out of left field for this band. But guess what, as awkward as it is, it\u2019s a hell of an earworm and the doominess of the riffs mixed with it fare for something fun at worst. \u201cShaking Off The Chains\u201d is a musical eye sore when looking at the poor delivery, especially vocally, but its stompy presence and tight bridge allow me to overlook that. Outside of the obvious though, \u201cCan\u2019t Get Close Enough\u201d gets unfairly overlooked. That wavy soft lick is incredible, and the flow of this song feels like it could have been a live staple. \n\nThe rest of Forbidden is hit or miss. Some of the songs sound like they could work as any other normal song from Tony Martin\u2019s era that are worth the revisit, others definitely feel a bit more empty. The back half of this album drops off and could have been trimmed of a song or two. On the other hand, ones like \u201cI Won\u2019t Cry For You\u201d and the title track have the same spoopy glam energy that made Headless Cross incredible, but with less redeeming value.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, the flaws on this disc aren\u2019t avoidable and I get why it ranks pretty low on most lists. But I do think it has some qualities that help those things matter less. And it does blow my mind that people take Cross Purposes to this one. For how much Black Sabbath has to offer, you can get almost everything good here elsewhere with better company. But I do think it\u2019s worth hearing.\n\nOriginally written for Metal Inferno\n",
        "\n13 is probably one of my biggest examples of a favorable-neutral album, as it actually ended up being better than I was anticipating, which helps. How much could you have really hoped for? As a baseline listen, it\u2019s exactly what you\u2019d expect. The attempt at recreating something from the \u201870s falls flat the second you apply the modern production, stripping away exactly what added so much charm to the original run of Ozzy records. And yes, Ozzy\u2019s voice also has the nasally tint to it that all of his later solo albums post Ozzmosis smeared us with. So how is it not a trainwreck?\n\nThe answer lies in the fact that despite these unpleasant face-value issues being blunt, the actual songwriting is pretty solid. This and only this is the reason why I prefer it to The Devil You Know by just the tiniest bit. If this record took the intensity, delivery, and fierceness of that record and applied it to this songwriting, you\u2019d have one hell of a reunion album. To be clear, that isn\u2019t consistent with the entire length, because there are definitely some overly-long tracks. But the ones that are worth hearing are written pretty well.\n\nFor starters, I think one of the most overlooked ones is \u201cLoner\u201d because of how well-paced it is, and the softer licks in the bridge are super tight. I also love the progression of the rhythms. \u201cLive Forever\u201d rides heavily on having a chorus hook that I really like; while a bit repetitive, I am a fan of its transitions. \u201cZeitgeist\u201d gives off big \u201cPlanet Caravan\u201d energy and I find it to be a very smooth one, especially with its acoustics. And of course \u201cGod Is Dead?\u201d is a bit of an earworm, admittedly. These tracks are nothing monumental, but I do find them all to be memorable, and I look forward to them every time I revisit them. \n\nBut like I said, 13 is definitely bogged down with some of the issues mentioned earlier, giving it a more generic feel than it needs. Opening on \u201cEnd Of The Beginning\u201d was also a tough roll, since that song is one of the most mediocre. Do I love this album? Nah. Do I like some of what\u2019s here? Yeah. The perfect idea would have been taking the best songs from The Devil You Know, the best one from this, and making one giant reunion compilation that absolutely smokes.\n",
        "\nIf you\u2019ve ever read Ozzy Osbourne\u2019s book I Am Ozzy, you\u2019ll know that he himself didn\u2019t think anything they did was truly good following Sabbath Bloody Sabbath. I\u2019m gonna have to hard disagree with this, as I think his entire classic run is pretty damn untouchable. At minimum, it\u2019s solid, up until his last dance with the band, Never Say Die!. If you could tell that there were tensions in the band with Forbidden but can\u2019t see it here, then you may need your ears checked. The prior disc may be one of their weirdest, but it\u2019s hooky from cover to cover at worst.\n\nThis excludes one thing; the title track. This attempted continuation of Technical Ecstasy is pretty forgettable, but has one gem that I can never get out of my head. \u201cNever Say Die!\u201d rakes in the harder energy and speedier cuts of Sabotage served on a warmer platter, and I honestly think this would work as a radio hit. Issue is, when one radio-type song is your only full standout, you\u2019re left with a bunch of stuff that ranges decent to awkward. That\u2019s not my idea of a sturdy foundation to carry a disc on its back. \n\nWith that in mind, the only other things worth talking about are what clearly come off differently but don\u2019t land thanks to faulty conditions of the pilots. For one, all of these songs are way too fucking long and overly reach for a sense of spitting out something different and interesting. By this point in the \u201870s, prog rock, and more operatic bands had broken some hard ground (Styx, Rush, Queen) and I really feel like the band channeled that into an autopilot mode that really just made for an awkward blend of heavy metal and funky bass passages. Don\u2019t read me wrong, I won\u2019t deny that said passages aren\u2019t strong; Geezer shines very bright in \u201cJunior\u2019s Eyes,\u201d but for heaven\u2019s sake that song just feels endless, much like the piano passages to the rest of \u201cAir Dance.\u201d.\n\nThe rest of Never Say Die! is held up by similar tidbits without completed delivery. You can\u2019t really talk about this album without mentioning the Bill Ward-fronted closer \u201cSwinging The Chain\u201d and its charming, noisy aura minus anything else memorable. Iommi\u2019s lead in \u201cShock Wave\u201d is compelling but doesn\u2019t incubate a particularly great song. Circling back to the overly long issue, \u201cA Hard Road\u201d also feels like it coulda smacked hard had it, once again, been shorter. The songwriting on this album needs a trim worse than Forrest Gump at the end of his run.\n\nBottom line, far worse things have happened. I find myself returning to this one roughly once a year or so, less than any other Ozzy record. Every time, it\u2019s worthwhile, but I forget about almost all of it within a week\u2019s time. I\u2019m glad that this exists, because revisiting it always feels like the first time, and it\u2019s fun as hell to talk about. If there weren\u2019t so many small flavors to dig from the center of the tootsie-pop, this could have been their worst effort. But as a whole, I can see why a big change for the band was in order.\n",
        "\nI changed my mind; though Tyr is one that I find to be pretty forgettable, I neglected the fact that Cross Purposes is even more so to the point that I almost, uh, forgot. Following the explosive reunion album featuring Dio on vocals two years prior, you\u2019d think maybe the band would go the extra mile here to stand out. Not only is that not true, but it in fact falls short even more. Talk about retreading old ground for the sake of playing safe!\n\nMuch like the last Martin-fronted record, this spins itself off of the same things that made the first two records with him excellent and goes absolutely nowhere with them. At least before, there was an attempt at being original, and the Norse toppings made it notably different. Now, take that lack of inspiration and pass it through one of the heaviest, doomiest discs Ronnie James ever fronted, and you\u2019ve got a second wannabe ingredient. Indeed, there is a clear step down in tempo and step up in intensity regarding the riffs. \u201cVirtual Death\u201d really feels like it wants to do what Dehumanizer did, but I personally think the songs on here that fared even better were when the speed picked up. The following track \u201cImmaculate Deception\u201d is likely my favorite one, only from the drumming and the drastic shift in drive. As a whole though, not one bit of this serves as anything memorable to me. \n\nBut Cross Purposes isn\u2019t flat out bad, thankfully. Martin\u2019s voice is still as pristine as ever, Iommi\u2019s solos and riffs are still present, and this could have been a far greater disaster than I\u2019m letting on. But man, could you get a little less phoned-in with writing patterns, or even just vary them from things that have already been done better before by the same general lineup? There is such poor flow from track to track that I\u2019m not even sure what the general idea was meant to be. It\u2019s the longest album that Tony Martin fronted, but it offers up the least. The way I feel about this record is how most feel about Forbidden, and I actually understand that. With that said, you\u2019ll find me returning to that one more regularly than this one. Maybe it\u2019s just me and I\u2019m missing something?\n",
        "\nAs an endless Tony Martin sympathizer, it\u2019s important to acknowledge that not everything he did was great. In fact, I really only think two out of five are, but that\u2019s for another time. Saying Tyr \u201cdoesn\u2019t feel like Sabbath\u201d would also be a dumb move, as the band had gone through so many stylistic changes up to this point that such a statement would feel redundant. This is however the concept album that seems to heavily attract power/doom nerds, and after many years of trying and trying again, I just can\u2019t find the appeal. Musically it\u2019s fine, not too removed from what they\u2019ve done prior, but it doesn\u2019t stick.\n\nMatter of fact, I think it\u2019s worth acknowledging the band deserving props for going this direction in the first place. I can\u2019t think of too many times where they reached these levels of operatic save for some sparse Dio-era moments and a few of the weirder Ozzy songs. Tyr pretty much nails that across the board. My issue lies in the fact that it feels like it channeled the dark/glammy energy of Headless Cross and painted some extra bells and whistles without bringing anything interesting to the table. \u201cJerusalem\u201d sounds like it could have come right from that album, but reworked to fit into this Norse themed disc.\n\nThe rest of this is just because it\u2019s well-executed music that I can\u2019t seem to find memorable at all. The acoustic guitars? Neat! The isolated operatic-like vocals? Impressive. The memorability? Non-existent. One that comes to mind is \u201cThe Sabbath Stones\u201d since it\u2019s one of the songs that dives into these tactics most heavily; it\u2019s also one of the doomier numbers. But the song really just doesn\u2019t do anything for me. Others like \u201cThe Law Maker\u201d hook me on a promising note with harder punches but drop my interest after a minute or so. The things I do enjoy feel like they\u2019ve been done before, but better. \u201cValhalla\u201d and its synthy intro are solid songs, but for the billionth time, I can\u2019t find myself returning to them for any reason.\n\nPerhaps you could say it\u2019s all me. This is my least favorite Black Sabbath album (save for Cross Purposes), but at the end of the day I just see it as C-grade heavy metal that isn\u2019t bad nor great. But let that showcase what this band can really do. Twenty albums over a nearly fifty year span, and this is as bad as it gets? That\u2019s pretty damn solid!\n",
        "\nAn album that has reached this magnitude of worship over the years cannot receive a disinclined review lightly and I have no intention of doing so. What I hope to avoid however are the standard conversation stoppers regularly employed by all Sabbath fans, first and foremost being the magnificent claim that it must be like for its historical importance. Some albums become so popular over time that saying anything bad of them has become like heresy now; this is likewise for albums that developed a reputation for being awful. They have been so blindly accepted as good or bad that their caliber, or lack thereof, have developed the honorary but erroneous title of officially good or officially bad and this has led to the following, unfortunate, truth:\n\nThere are some albums you are not allowed to hate and some albums you are not allowed to like.\n\nI critique an album as good or bad based on the album without any reference as to who made it or how influential it is/was, this will be one of those reviews. Black Sabbath's reputation does not make them invulnerable to unfavorable judgment and their album will be judged on its own merits, notoriety be damned. A word about Black Sabbath:\n\nTo say that Black Sabbath as a band was ahead of their time is an understatement. This was the release that saw the band de-tune their stringed instruments, completing the intent first established the previous year. If you deem this album to be good because of the heaviness and the stripped down raw feel, I have no issue with that, I am aware Black Sabbath created doom metal with this release. The problem is they failed miserably as songwriters. I won't even say that this is a non-album; Master Of Reality is an anti-album, where little to nothing happens, nothing is said and little to nothing is done. A album that is literally about nothing, vacuous.\n\nThe truth is that you can fast forward through most of this album and not miss anything spectacular, ninety percent of it is totally dispensable and the other ten percent just doesn't matter. The phrase \u201cnothing happened\u201d can never be more literally stated about an Ozzy era release than this.\n\nThink I am just joshing? Being contrary for the sake of it? Then take off your obsession based nostalgia goggles and take a look at the album's artwork. This is the same band who managed to snag a perfect visual representation on their debut by having one of the best album sleeves in all of music history, yet just two albums later we get artwork with just the title and nothing else. I guess they thought we would be happy they are written in giant font but no, the font is ugly, the colors are weak and it reeks of laziness. About the only good(?) thing I can say about it is that it DOES perfectly represent most of the music herein quite perfectly. At least the music that most like the album for. How is that I know you are not asking, but this imminent slashing, could be repeated for most of the albums songs....\n\nThe opening track, Sweet Leaf, is an transparent ode to marijuana. Not only does it begin with a cough but a cough produced by Iommi after hitting a joint, method music making I suppose. So I can see how this song would be more of a relaxed fair, its slight swing makes it excusable. There are no excuses however for why it also has only 2 guitar riffs. 2 and not only are there just 2 they are laughably simplistic and not even creative. This is not the driving melodic riff of Electric Funeral or Wicked World, this is just a couple of power chords.\n\nLet me state that there is nothing intrinsically wrong with being repetitive, it is a function of all music, but it is everything that is wrong to be repetitive when moving at a snail\u2019s pace. This is not some experimental avant-garde piece where there are 7 vocal lines in a 12 minute suite. This is a tedious, plodding song, with tedious, plodding music meant to be just a backdrop so as to shine the brightest light on, unfortunately, its worst performer, Ozzy, singing tedious, plodding vocal lines.\n\nTo my ears it is never good to have Ozzy sing over slow music, where we are forced to listen to his voice. This would be successful in some cases from Volume 4 - Never Say Die but here Ozzy gives only one quality vocal performance, more on that later.\n\nNow as I wrote, Sweet Leaf is an ode to marijuana and its relaxing effects. So after Ozzy - sounding like he has a clothespin on his nostrils - forgets to carry a tune over a single riff repeated enough times to redefine the word monotony, the band suddenly forgets what drug they were writing about. Out of nowhere there is a minute long jam session, which I concede is not half bad but why is it here? It might due to the band knowing how boring the song was and had to wake their audience and themselves back up and let Ozzy go backstage and pray for a better effort. A prayer of course that went unheard. Proof there is no God?\n\nNow I will concede that it is the most fun part of the song - mostly because Ozzy is not singing(see: ruining the song) - but what does that lead to? An exciting crescendo (\u00e0 la Spiral Architect, N.I.B. or Sabbra Cadabra)? An ironic sudden shift in tone and style (\u00e0 la The Straightener, Symptom Of the Universe or Johnny Blade)? Several seemingly unrelated passages (\u00e0 la Killing Yourself To Live or The Writ)? Nope ... Just back to that single riff repeated until you loathe its very existence and those awful vocals.\n\nAs I wrote above that could describe the entire album. After Forever and Children Of the Grave are the albums stronger moments but like all the other numbers, they fall somewhat flat because of two problems. First are the vocals, the way he ends the lyric lines in the verses of After Forever, or the unbelievably awful delivery during the opening lines for Lord Of This World, which is a song that perfectly represents my second problem. The music.\n\nBill Ward, Geezer Butler and Tony Iommi are more than competent, they have proven to be reliable on two previous albums. The three of them begin Lord Of this World with a bit of tense anticipation and the entire song can be pointed to for the claim that it redefined the word heavy, in a musical context. No one in 1971 sounded like this. But like all of the compositions here, it fails to have any imagination, the opening musical stanza is tense but plummets immediately. Returning to that snails pace and going absolutely nowhere musically, then Ozzy assaults your eardrums. This performance is one of the absolute worst in Ozzy\u2019s career, which is saying something considering the majority of his solo output.\n\nChildren Of the Grave is a highlight but only musically, Ozzy is listenable on this track but I have heard much better versions. So when I write listenable, mind you, it is only at the expense of being generous. It illustrates perfectly what I wrote before, when Ozzy is singing over an energetic composition he can sound really awesome.\n- Sabbath Bloody Sabbath and Sabotage are not only landmark releases but even I, one of Ozzy\u2019s biggest critics, concede a large part was because of him. Whereas all 7 of the other albums released during Ozzy\u2019s original tenure had lots of energy, Master Of Reality lacks both energy and experimentation.\n\nAs much as I praise the music over the singing, they are just as guilty because nothing is spectacular here and if you listen closely you will hear that every idea on this album has been done before. Black Sabbath did nothing musically, in regards to metal, on MoR that was different from their previous material. The structure of the songs, the riffage, the plodding nature, the vocal melodies following identical guitar melodies, etc... But the 7 other albums had diversity, MoR just plods along, each song riding one or two riffs through their entirety. Where is the adventurous songwriting? Everything about Master Of Reality is bare-bones, raw and stripped down to a primitive form that meanders about, aimlessly. That is fine for what it is but this is heralded as \u201cone of the crowning achievements\u201d of a \u201criff god.\u201d This I elementary stuff for Iommi. This was the \"best\" he could do at the time?\n\nAfter Forever has a progressive approach to it, with dissimilar sections and all, but that had already been done with Hand Of Doom. Into the Void does have a notable intro, a main rhythm pattern of D and E fifths, repetitive vocal melodies in between these two chord forms, an entirely different progression in the middle and an extended instrumental coda, but War Pigs had already checked each of those boxes. Of the 5 (only 5 mind you) metal songs on this album, the one with the most riffs is Into the Void with \u2026 5. 5! Again, this was the \u201cbest\u201d Iommi could do at the time?\n\nSo that is all of the \u2018metal\u2019 songs on this release. The remaining 3 songs are, ironically, the most memorable, if for no reason they are absurdly different. I do appreciate the jingle Embryo being played before Children Of the Grave, it is a deceptively goofy piece to happen before a serious and headbanging anthem. Orchid is a 90 second instrumental, which I love. Being an enormous fan of classical guitar, especially the flamenco, I find this to be a beautiful little interlude.\n\nThat leaves only Solitude, the one quality vocal performance I wrote about way back when. The music is gentle but brooding, with a melodic and emotional flute played by Iommi. It is an insight, like Orchid, of what we could expect from Iommi from then on as he set the world ablaze as a songwriter. But the song is mostly known as the weirdest and most original vocal performance of Ozzy\u2019s career, at least with Black Sabbath. It literally does not sound like him at all. This is obviously due to studio magic and vocal effects but it is so incredibly different that it led to oft-repeated falsehood that Bill Ward sang the song. It has a dark mood and thick atmosphere that, if nothing else, introduced a new instrument to the fold and evidence of what was to come.\n\nIt is for that reason I fail to get what is so great about this album. The song with the most evolution, the most passion and original idea was when they stepped into slight Barry Manilow territory. Unless I am missing something here, the only notable songs are Orchid (being a classical guitar interlude) and Solitude (introducing the Flute and as the next evolutionary step from Planet Caravan). Otherwise, the real lasting legacy of MoR is just the down-tuning to C# for all stringed instruments from then on, producing a much thicker and heavier sound. That is it.\n\nSabbath have released significantly better albums, including during the Ozzy era, just listen to any other. Yes this album is historically significant and neither do I find it an abomination as I might have made it seem. If you are a fan of metal music that routinely moves like it is stuck in molasses, or smoked some of the finest Colombian Red Sweet Leaf around, then this is right for you. If you are a fan of metal music that routinely places a vocalist at the forefront during his worst vocals in 20 years, then this is right for you.\n\nI concede the albums significance, there is no doubt many a young metalheads who were inspired greatly by the thundering rhythm section of down-tuned strings and absurdly dark and heavy atmosphere. This was no doubt revolutionary but like most things that have the right to own the distinction as first of the kind, it is eventually surpassed in subsequent generations as all of the tools available to make the original will be available and more advanced later on. Even Black Sabbath themselves would do music on the next 2 albums, as well as 18 years later, that is much heavier.\n\nHighlights: Solitude, Orchid & Children Of the Grave\nLowlights: Sweet Leaf, Lord Of this World & Into The Void\n",
        "\nParanoid is a pretty weird album. It's not, as I said about the debut, an unlikely album in the sense that Black Sabbath seems to hang together by spider webs and fate's will. No, Paranoid is weird for a host of other reasons, but I suppose the primary point among them is that the troupe of 4 Birmingham lads were pretty weird themselves. We'll get to that in a moment, though; first, some other oddness. According to the band themselves, the success of their first album took them completely by surprise, and as their gigs doubled and tripled in size and profit within just a few months of the release going up the charts, they began receiving offers and opportunities from all over the place, though consideration of the American market ended up playing a large role. Signing to Warner Bros. Records in the States gave a good leg up for the quartet despite being unknown, never having played there beforehand. As a result of the deal, Sabbath were ready to tour the US in the summer of 1970 while their debut was high in the charts, yet their supposedly Satanic image came up against the trial of professed Satanist Charles Manson and followers, during which Manson incited both the court and the media by claiming that the murders committed were due to secret messages in the heavy 'Helter Skelter' by The Beatles. Occult rock fell under immediate suspicion, but the detail that dug the grave for the tour can be found in the manner that actress Sharon Tate had been slaughtered: heavily pregnant at the time, she was stabbed repeatedly in the stomach before Manson and cohorts daubed the word \"pig\" on the front door with her blood. Black Sabbath - definitely not on the same wavelength themselves - were about to appear on stage playing their dark rock music, and the song 'War Pigs' would be one of the focal points of the show. Tour cancelled.\n\nOf course, the real irony stems from the actual subject of 'War Pigs'. Sabbath had met soldiers involved in the Vietnam War while playing their residence at the Star Club in Germany (the local US bases were a kind of stop-off for returning troops) and heard stories not only about the conflict itself but also the level of despondency and drug use, particularly heroin, on the front lines. The song itself was an old one, written before Black Sabbath was recorded, though the negative view on the subject was unhelpful to the US government at the time (1969 having returned an all-time high number of casualties), certainly with that title slapping them in the face. As a result, the record company objected to the name being given to the entire album, at which point the single 'Paranoid' had already performed superlatively in the British charts and therefore provided a more convenient title. And so, the paranoia of the suits caused Paranoid to be dubbed thus ironically. Thematically, that proved apt anyway, seeing as Sabbath had focused much more on real-world issues than the often fantastic tropes of the debut, detailing the dangers of technology, mutually assured destruction, mental breakdown, and drug abuse, which was just about to become the group's specialist subject. In my view, this kind of intense pessimistic scrutiny makes Paranoid much more of a \"heavy\" album than Black Sabbath (the adjective was originally associated with topic and mood as well as instrumentation), while the coupling of more oppressive playing techniques on several of the key songs makes this my first candidate for a metal album, in addition to the most likely source of doom as a concept and a sub-genre.\n\nYou can always rely on these guys for a laugh though, because Black Sabbath themselves had none of the confidence or maturity that we nowadays wish to project on the album, nor did they specially seem to mind all the requests from management and elsewhere as long as there was a gig to play, drugs to smoke, and perhaps some money at the end of that. Geezer Butler later frothed over a gig in March 1970 when, \"We went there in a car instead of a van, and we found an ounce of hash in the dressing room.\" Standards, right? Writing 'Fairies Wear Boots' as either a retort to the skinheads who set upon the band or as a totally made-up lyric about being zonked (the doctor says, near the end of the song, \"Son, you've gone too far/Cause smokin' and trippin' is all that you do\") doesn't exactly supplement ideas of a mature Sabbath either. Musically, we get a different story. Led Zeppelin was the strongest influence by a mile, and in fact almost proved the obstacle to Paranoid's success. Having listened almost constantly to Zeppelin's II album, the band had noted how closely the instrumental 'Rat Salad' mirrored John Bonham's percussive display on 'Moby Dick', both in position on the tracklist and in its main function, which was to showcase Bill Ward's drumming. By itself, that might not have become an issue, but when producer Rodger Bain suggested that they record 'Paranoid' - supposedly just \"a bit of nonsense\" they were jamming in the studio - Sabbath generally and Geezer in particular objected on the grounds that it sounded too much like Zeppelin's 'Communication Breakdown' and would be discovered instantly as a rip-off. I can tell you that the main riffs of the 2 songs are extremely similar, the vocals sound entirely different, and Sabbath's has a much more satisfying groove. The lyrics though, you can tell were written right there and then in the studio.\n\nThe music, too, continues to be quite weird. I can see how 'War Pigs' emerged from those massive on-stage jam sessions in the early days, since the song has a totally bizarre musical structure yet really flows properly from start to finish, touching 8 minutes. I've always thought that putting solo vocal lines in verses is a bold and underrated tactic, and that's what Sabbath use for the first and second verses before developing a loping groove out of evolving percussion and repeated licks, which explain why we don't need a chorus. In terms of this kind of outside-the-box creativity, 'Hand of Doom' stands tall as another progressive piece, though this time it doesn't have the same freewheeling style as the much less tense instrumental break in the middle of 'War Pigs', nor that release of tension in the coda at the end of the opening cut. Instead, 'Hand of Doom' deserves its status as namesake of the doom metal genre, actually not because it spends all 7 minutes at slow pace, but because the creeping bass riff and foreboding chords in the first and last 2 minutes had already made all the impression they needed. Remember, we're talking weird: for 1970, that main verse sequence seems not only sinister but also extremely deliberate in terms of eerie mood, like 'Black Sabbath' with the basic tritone riff taken forward a good few steps. I'd point to the rhythmic part at 3:38 (in the middle of the faster section) as another key moment for doom, in the first place due to the contrast between the energetic exhortations of Ozzy at full belt and the impending sense of danger in the marching riff, then secondly because the drums, bass, and guitar seem just a touch out of step with each other, which would come to define that lagging, lurking doomy sensibility over the next couple of decades.\n\nHowever, if we're really talking weird, heavy, and doomy, I can't pretend that 'Iron Man' and 'Electric Funeral' make a smaller impression. This pair represent more than just a couple of iconic riffs...or maybe they don't, since the riffs drive the songs so absolutely that their \"heaviness\" seems beyond dispute. Away from chord- and melody-oriented rock and blues towards a more rhythmic, guitar-centred model of music, these songs feel like something quite different, even compared to the other songs on Paranoid. Ozzy following the riff of 'Iron Man' with his vocal lines - tonally and rhythmically - proved a masterstroke for a piercing, nasal voice like his, and essentially reinforces the strength of the riff in the manner that Candlemass later tried to do with all their string players maintaining one line, then the vocalist more or less trades licks with Tony Iommi through the chorus. Of course, it helps that the whole thing is massively headbangable. All that said, I'm convinced that 'Electric Funeral' pushed Sabbath further over the precipice than any other song, slightly messy vocal scanning notwithstanding. Even now - and I'm sitting here a little over 50 years later - the main riff crushes me beyond comprehension and seems without precedent, flattening tone and brutal effect squeezing together to perfection. If 'Hand of Doom' gave doom metal a name, 'Electric Funeral' gave it a target, and not much has improved on that song since.\n\nI suppose the rest of the album seems weird in more of a 21st century manner than it would have in 1970. For rock bands of the time, mixing a very soft \"contrast\" cut like the jazzy campfire dream of 'Planet Caravan' among the molten heaviness elsewhere was more expected, and we can probably thank the gods that this ended up a smoky hippie jam rather than an actual ballad, as 'Changes' was on Vol 4. It suits the mood of Paranoid in some ways, although I wish it could have been placed a little more carefully; after the catchiness of the title track it stalls the flow quite seriously, whereas putting it between the sudden ending of the slightly repetitive 'Iron Man' and the zombie crawl of the equally spacey 'Electric Funeral' might have produced more of an effect. The rather showy antics of the band during the more serious cuts jars a little with me too, though I concede that the instrumental sections are inserted far better than, for instance, that of 'Warning' from the debut, even the sudden shift into lively tom work and almost funky guitar in the middle of 'Electric Funeral' getting directed carefully and segueing back very cleanly too. On that topic, the tail of the record jams more heartily than anywhere else, 'Rat Salad' indeed largely featuring Bill Ward's prowess with the sticks alongside a well-worked build-up and conclusion, then 'Fairies Wear Boots' evolving through plenty of movements (more drum fills than you can count) before finally getting to its welcoming main riff. I'll drive a wedge between them and say that I'd prefer to see 'Rat Salad' at a show, but that 'Fairies' never gets dull, moving on from section to section like 'War Pigs' though with arguably more inventiveness and instrumental know-how, largely from the superlative Ward and also Iommi with some quirky melodies and unselfish rhythmic play. Overall, Iommi's lead work - to say nothing of those amazing riffs - saw a drastic change for the better between Black Sabbath and Paranoid, mostly in terms of control and relevance of the lead to the song.\n\nAs ever, rating an album like this gives me a huge headache, because so many different elements are worthy of consideration. From the influence angle, I strongly believe that Paranoid laid the groundwork for future heavy bands much better than the debut, which had been left behind even within a few years. These days, I still hear bands trying to improve on 'Electric Funeral' and 'Hand of Doom', with rip-offs aplenty. That said, in its own day and age Paranoid was generally a leader rather than a follower (aside from a few Led Zep steals) and pushed rock music into new, dark realms in terms of sonic and thematic heaviness. It also helps that I can listen to it front to back and enjoy the whole thing, appreciating the performances and mostly condoning the decisions along the way. Their inherent weirdness certainly helped Black Sabbath to stand out back in the day, and that spark of the weird means Paranoid remains a great listen even half a century later.\n",
        "\nBlack Sabbath needs no introduction to anyone who has even the most basic understanding of heavy metal. The godfathers of metal themselves have had a lengthy discography with many hits, and even some of their weaker releases still have something special in them that makes them memorable. However, while there is a huge debate on what is the best Sabbath record, my choice would easily have to go to their third studio album \"Master of Reality\". This release saw the band exploring more doom metal structures as well as an even heavier sound that would give birth to the stoner rock/metal movement. Not only is this their best album, but its stoner moments are extremely strong and innovative to a then-new genre.\n\nLet's start off with the instruments. Sabbath's previous two records had their own heavy moments, but those albums fall flat when compared to MOR. Beginning with the song \"Sweet Leaf\", it starts with Tony Iommi coughing before we are immediately thrown into some heavy riffs. The guitars are easily the best part of the album, as they contain some heavy distortion, which is amplified by the slow-paced playing. This gives the atmosphere a slow, downer, and doomful feel, and it works perfectly. The drums also has some basic beats, but later in the song where it gets more intense, the drumming gets more complicated, and leads the other instruments to a more fast-paced, anxious moment on the track. The bass is also just as heavy as the guitars, and it adds in a thick foundation to establish the distorted riffs and drums. All of this is combined to make \"Sweet Leaf\" a strong composition, but it's not the only good track on here. \"Children of the Grave\" and \"Lord of This World\" go for a more epic and upbeat tone, which are further executed with the uplifting guitars and ecstatic drumming. \"Solitude\", however, remains one of my favorite sad metal tracks of all time, as the guitars play some calming riffs, with flutes and bells in the background further enhancing the slow and moody atmosphere. Every track on this album has some excellent guitar riffs, and the overall composition of this album is excellent.\n\nWhat makes this even better is the vocals. Ozzy Osbourne's vocals on the previous albums are great, but his vocals are even better in this album. Ozzy emphasizes his words more than in previous releases, and his shouting gives him a raging personality that is fantastic at leading in the listener. One excellent example of this is in the final track \"Into the Void\". This track has some groovy riffs and rhythmic drumming, and this reflects well with the vocals. Ozzy's haunting voice flows perfectly with the doom/stoner feel, and his story about the rockets is greater thanks to his emphasis of some words. Also going back to \"Solitude\", Ozzy's singing is superb, as his more depressed personality makes his voice sound more angelic and soothing, further enhancing the sorrowful track. Ozzy's vocals on this album are damn near perfect overall, and it mixes extremely well to the instruments.\n\nEven the lyrics are exceptional. The lyrics deal with themes on drugs, especially on the track \"\tSweet Leaf\". Just look at this verse from the song for example:\n\nMy life was empty, forever on a down\nUntil you took me, showed me around\nMy life is free now, my life is clear\nI love you sweet leaf, though you can't hear\n\nThis verse is about the person feeling empty, but now has something to look forward to thanks to the \"sweet leaf\". Sweet leaf is slang for marijuana, but the way the lyrics are written makes the reference feel subtle, and is further enhanced with the slow and stoner riffs and Ozzy's energized vocals. When it's not about drugs, however, the lyrics can get spiritual. Take the lyrics to \"After Forever\" for example, where this verse quotes:\n\nCould it be you're afraid of what your friends might say\nIf they knew you believe in God above?\nThey should realize before they criticize\nthat God is the only way to love\n\nThis verse is about being open-minded about a god existing, which the band written to prove that they weren't Satanists. However, the subtlety is what makes this work extremely well, with the questions leading to multiple answers, and suggesting that it can be good or bad should there be a god or not. While the lyrics are simple on paper, their subtle tone enhances the themes, and they would be further executed by the instruments and vocals.\n\nSo what else can I say about this album other than it's the best Sabbath record ever? The doom/stoner instruments lead to some incredible riffs, the vocals only enhance it with Ozzy's extravagant vocals, and the diverse lyrical themes make the verses subtle and down-to-earth. Black Sabbath has released so many other albums since then, and while they've since disbanded, that doesn't mean that their work can't live on. If you're looking for a doom/stoner metal album with a heavy 70s nostalgia vibe, then \"Master of Reality\" is an album I highly recommend.\n",
        "\nSo, to no one's surprise I just bought the \"second\" Deluxe, 2 CD, Edition of Black Sabbath's Mob Rules. There's no reason to give a review of the original album's music, it was groundbreaking Metal that started with Heaven And Hell, while the tracks on this actually surpasses them with even more intensity and overall heaviness in feel. But why buy another deluxe edition? Wasn't the first one enough? No.\n\nY'see, the one from 2010 was actually for sale outside of the US. Because of that, while you got a remastered original album, the bonus \"Die Young (Live)\", and the \"Heavy Metal\" version of the title track, it's bonus disc was the entire limited edition CD of \"Live At Hammersmith\". It was a great addition since the original release of \"Hammer\" was limited to only 5000 copies, selling out on day one and still to this day not released on it's own. When I got it I noticed that the overall volume levels on both discs were surprisingly lower than usual standards. While I didn't want it \"blown-out\", it was obvious that even remastered if you had to turn your stereo up full max to hear it, it misses the point. And honestly, with all of these 2010's, 2CD Sabbath deluxe Vertigo versions (there are to date nine of them: Black Sabbath, Paranoid, Master Of Reality, Heaven And Hell, Mob Rules, Live Evil [though with NO bonus content], Born Again, Seventh Star, & The Eternal Idol), each suffered the same fate, being just too low to really appreciate any overall remastering improvement. While the first three were eventually released over here through Warner Brothers, they too were just ports from the Vertigo remastering.\n\nBut ten years later, Warner decided to give it a spin, and yes, they did it right! Like others they've gave the 2CD treatment to (Alice Cooper's \"Billion Dollar Babies\" comes to mind, the ONLY version you'll ever need), this remaster features broader range, sharper clarity (Mob Rules always tended to be on the \"bassy\" side, now fixed), while not going into brickwall country. Simply put, I've owned Mob Rules on four different CD's in my life, this one beats all of them in one sonic punch. But the main reason to buy this isn't just the album, but the bonuses, and this time, they are different. While the Die Young/Heavy Metal tracks remain (also sounding much better), gone is Hammersmith, mostly, in favor of a different concert, \"Portland 1982\". However, it's placement is sorta strange, starting on Disc One, then two songs in, continues for the rest of Disc Two. Why they didn't place Hammersmith on here is beyond me, but they did decide to give you three songs from it, two of which weren't performed in Portland being \"Country Girl\", \"Slipping Away\", and yes another live \"The Mob Rules\". In fact \"Mob\" is on this edition FIVE times, with another oddity, a 2021 Remix that sounds like a mash up between the original and Heavy Metal versions, not essential, but still a cool listen. But with the extras being what they are, the star of the show is Portland.\n\nInstead of Hammersmith, a best-of collage of three shows in a row put together seamlessly, Portland is Portland, that one complete late April 1982 show. While it's possible they're might be some editing here and there, it doesn't compare to what Hammersmith went through. As for it's sound quality, maybe it's a hair less as clear as Hammer, but miles above of what a bootleg version could ever be. And while most shows from this tour tend to sound the same, this Portland presentation has a unique mix. While Dio sounds as front as ever, Iommi's volume takes a back-step to Butler and strangely keyboardist Geoff Nicholls. While on paper this might throw off some purists, it gives an interesting listen, with Geezer just tearing up his parts and to hear what Geoff actually did for the ambiance of the performances are quite interesting. Trust me, he's no John Lord behind the scenes, just adding enough here and there to fill any holes, what few there were. The set-list is no shock, what you'd expect, but as always a variation every so often. And I could sware I can hear Ronnie's voice crack just once, and for one of the most perfect voices in Metal live to actually crack, even once, is worth the price of admission it's so rare. So, would I miss Hammersmith if I didn't own both? Maybe, but Portland is longer, more real & in your face, and the Vertigo version with it will always be around. I say, Portland, the better choice at this point.\n\nSo if you finally want the definitive version of the second-led Dio Sabbath album, this is it. Great volume without any brickwalls, nice extras that fulfill nicely, and a longer concert with a mix you've never quite heard before. That and of course a full many-paged color booklet, gatefold Digipack cover, and alot of history written out inside, this is one Mob Rules that rules them all\n",
        "\nSo Dio leaves the band and sets out for a solo career and along follows Vinny Appice. Black Sabbath would then recruit original drummer Bill Ward and then snatch up another legendary vocalist Ian Gillan of Deep Purple. This version of Black Sabbath would only release one album together and that would be Born Again in 1983. Now I have never delved much into the Black Sabbath stuff post Mob Rules but I figure while listening to Born Again I review the record. Born Again is very atmospheric at times yet corny other times, it's a very odd record for me. Some songs really stand out and make me think what could have been while others make think what were these guys thinking. \n\nThe production/mix on this record is very 80's and for me this is the first 80's sounding Black Sabbath album despite Heaven and Hell and Mob Rules being released in 1980 and 1981. Those first two Dio era albums had a strong 70's vibe to them. The Production/mix here is pretty good as it is classic sounding bill wards snare is saturated in that reversed reverb that grew in popularity in the early 80's and essentially became standard back then. The guitars are thick and sludgy yet really clear sounding. The bass is present in the mix as always when it comes to Black Sabbath and Ian Gillan sounds decent here but I much prefer him in Deep Purple. \n\nThe songs here are alright nothing really special or interesting. Some of the lyrical content and song titles are just cheesy for example \"Digital Bitch\" is full of cheese and is just a downright terrible track. \"Trashed\" is alright but doesn't really grab me like any of the previous Black Sabbath stuff did. The 2 instrumentals are kind of pointless as they are just atmospheric tracks that bridge into the next songs that follow them. \"Disturbing the Priest\" doesn't do much and drags along majority of the song. \"Zero the Hero\" is probably the most known track on this record and is one of the best ones on here and despite being very doomy its got a catchy chorus. \"Born Again\" the title track is by far the best song on the album its a sort of semi ballad that is slow and atmospheric but man this is the sort of stuff that should have been more prominent on this album. \"Hot Line\" and \"Keep it Warm\" are mid tempo rockers that end the record and are easily forgettable. \n\nBorn Again is a odd album for Black Sabbath and the Gillan era would only be a phase for the band as they would move on from him shortly after. Most of these tracks seem to be more adapted to his style rather than the trademark Black Sabbath sound like songs like \"Zero the Hero\" and \"Born Again\" which are the only 2 amazing tracks on this record. I wouldn't recommend this album to someone new into Black Sabbath and I'm sure the die hard fans of the band will hate my view of this record but for me this just isn't that special of an album despite coming from the founders of heavy metal. \n\nPick up \"Zero the Hero\" and \"Born Again\" then forget the rest...\n",
        "\nAfter almost a decade of 3 different singers and mediocre albums Black Sabbath finally brought back the best singer the band ever had, Ronnie James Dio. With Dehumanizer we see the band pick up right where they left on with 1981's Mob Rules and it is a shame it only lasted with this album only. The band seemed to be revitalized with the return of Dio fronting them and produced in my opinion the last great Black Sabbath album. Production/mix wise this album sounds great and everything is clear and audible even the bass is out there in open like always when it comes to Black Sabbath you could always hear Geezer groovin' away throughout the tracks. Iommi's guitar sound is incredible here and is reminiscent of the early 80's Black Sabbath guitar tones. Dio as always sounds immaculate even at 50 here in 1992 he just kills it on this record, the dudes voice was simply ageless. Appice is amazing as always and easily adapts back into the doomy sound of Black Sabbath after being away for 10 years and also playing with Dio on his first 4 releases during the 80's. \n\nDehumanizer contains 10 tracks clocking in at just over 50 minutes and provides a lot of different elements while still retaining their iconic doom metal vibe and atmosphere. Some of these tunes are really good and quite catchy while some others are a bit cheesy and just sort of drag on. \"After All' and \"Letters From Earth\" are classic sounding Black Sabbath super slow doomy tracks they drudge on in a good way. \"Computer God\" and \"Master of Insanity\" have these start stop type of riffs with frequent pauses allowing for some clever and catchy powerful verse lines from Dio. Also that intro riff in \"Master of Insanity\" is quite technical for the band as most of their tracks do not contain that type of riffage and timing. Iommi definitely stepped up his game on this record solo wise. Tracks like \"Time Machine\" is really uptempo for Black Sabbath standards keeping a steady pace throughout the entire song. \"I\" is a blend of all these techniques making it the most versatile track on the entire disc to my ears. \"Buried Alive\" has a ridiculously heavy intro and keeps that gritty vibe throughout the track and is one of the heaviest Dio era Black Sabbath tunes ever. My favorite song on this album is the ballad \"Too Late\" and for me Dio's best performance on the whole album. He just adds a whole other layer to these type of tracks not saying he wasn't good at the heavier stuff because he was just great at everything but these ballad tunes he really shined. \n\n\"TV Crimes\" and \"Sins of the Father\" are pretty generic and lackluster compared to the rest of the songs here. \"TV Crimes\" is by far the worst song on Dehumanizer and is just as cheesy as the music video for it and lyrically doesn't make any sense. I'm thoroughly surprised a song like \"TV Crimes\" got a music video compared to some of the other tracks on this record. \"Sins of the Father\" just drags along and feels a lot longer than what it actually is and the song itself is pretty generic compared to some of the moments in other songs on Dehumanizer. I feel like without Dio these two tracks would be pretty unlistenable. While I do like this album a lot for what it is I do believe it is a step down from the first wave of Dio era Black Sabbath albums due to there being a few tracks I would more of less skip over when listening to Dehumanizer mainly the two mentioned above. You have to be in a certain mood for this album I guess being the thrash fanatic I am but this album is definitely miles ahead of any of their releases post 1981. There isn't much more bad about this release other than some of the songs may be slightly boring and may feel longer than what they are if this isn't your main cup of tea. Other than that this is a damn solid album for band 20 plus years into their career and a much better album than the Dio solo work that came after Dehumanizer. As much as I like Dio on Dehumanizer and in Black Sabbath in general, I'd still take any of the 1970-1975 Ozzy era Black Sabbath albums over Dehumanizer.\n\nIt sucks this was the last Dio era Black Sabbath effort. I really would have liked to see what they could have done throughout the rest of the 90's had this lineup soldiered on. I believe the band could have possibly topped this release had another album surfaced with this lineup. It's no doubt though that Dehumanizer was a nice return to form after a decade of lineup changes and experimentation.\n",
        "\nand a damn fine epitaph, if you ask me; I mean, you have none other than Ice-T from the fashionable at the time thrash/crossover rappers Body Count helping\u2026 I was personally expecting him to be rapping \u201cBody Count\u2019s in the house\u2026\u201d here and there, but he didn\u2019t. He was forbidden to participate fully\u2026 thank god.\n\nThe Sabbath period with Tony Martin was a very strong one\u2026 and just to think that the latter only joined the team after Ray Gillen (later Badlands) quit. Yep, his involvement gave the fledgling veterans a vital ingredient, one that kept them afloat all the way to the mid-90\u2019s. Those 90\u2019s, not a very propitious time for old school metal exploits, and one could only speculate as to the potential appearance of another flop along the lines of \u201cNever Say Die\u201d if the band had lasted longer\u2026\n\nbut they didn\u2019t; they stopped in time thus keeping their high reputation intact. However, this stoppage wasn\u2019t exactly a natural one; there were quite a few reasons for this more or less timely dissolution: the times weren\u2019t very welcoming for the retro metal heroes, the line-up was shaking, Geezer left, there were even rumours that Iommi was looking for ways to reunite with his ex-colleague Ozzy Osbourne thus leaving Martin in the trenches once again, like he did in 1992 when DIO (R.I.P.) came back for the recording of \u201cDehumanizer\u201d\u2026 on top of that, the hoax that the band were teaming up with Ice-T and Ernie C from the mentioned Body Count batch turned out to be true\u2026 what the f\u2026?! In other words, all the circumstances surrounding the recording sessions spelt just one word across the sky: \u201cdisaster\u201d, and not a fabulous one at that. \n\nAnd that\u2019s why my admiration for the band increased severalfold when it turned out that this swansong at the time was every bit as convincing as the preceding offering. Thumbs up, veteranos! Certainly, you can\u2019t expect a masterpiece along the lines of \u201cMaster of Reality\u201d or \u201cEternal Idol\u201d, again under the adverse circumstances, but very few were the classic metal albums from the 90\u2019s that held their own with such dignity. Squashing the naysayers first with the formidable doom march \u201cThe Illusion of Power\u201d, not without the help of Ice-T who recites belligerently on the side; before brightening the horizon with the playful quasi-groover \u201cGet a Grip\u201d, the only unmitigated nod at the ruling trends. Diversity for better or worse doesn\u2019t become the name of the game, fortunately, excluding the bluesy rockabilia \u201cSick & Tired\u201d, the band taking care of business with the sinister marvel \u201cShaking off the Chains\u201d, a total return to the early Sabbath days, an earth shaker second-to-none also graced by superb vocal performance and a restless fast-paced break. Things can seldom get any better than this, on this or on any other opus, but wait till you hear the supreme ballad \u201cI Won't Cry for You\u201d, the steady hypnotic mid-pacer \u201cGuilty as Hell\u201d, the heavy metal staple \u201cRusty Angels\u201d, and especially the excellent atmospheric closer \u201cKiss of Death\u201d, a varied thrilling ride mirroring the contrasting \u201cballad vs. dynamics\u201d layout of \u201cChildren of the Sea\u201d and \u201cThe Sign of the Southern Cross\u201d. \n\nWay to go, fellows, a dignified exit on all counts, sweeping away all the anxiety and nervousness besieging the band previously, also seeing them steadfastly holding onto the same values they pioneered some 26 years earlier. Cause could there be a better numetal vogues\u2019 defier than Black Sabbath, the fathers of the genre? No, not really. A stance that was worth of bigger respect having in mind the hordes of old school acts who had fallen, more or less willingly, under the groovy yoke during the 90\u2019s. The Sabbaths held their head high during these most trying times, and left their legacy unstained\u2026. and unrapped.\n\nAt the time no one knew that this would be the last Black Sabbath album for nearly 20 years\u2026 for some the admiration towards the latter has gone up because of this fact; for others it has diminished since it could have been better, this swansong at the time\u2026 sure thing, but how exactly do you produce an undisputable classic heavy metal masterpiece in 1995? How inspired would you feel for such a feat surrounded by all kinds of modern influences those insistently pricking your aura, delving into your subconscious, sucking away your creative urges towards the classic values? Drawing vistas of humiliation and a \u201claughing stock\u201d status if tempted to release them, these obsolete tunes\u2026 an unenviable setting from which the veterans emerged victorious. \u201cForbidden\u201d; by all means. This is a fortress erected as a defender, and a shelter; a stolid unflinching, determined stronghold where only the Sabbath stone was allowed to roll, and with it the entire retro metal carnival\u2026 until the next renaissance.\n",
        "\nI am a long time fan of Black Sabbath, first saw them on the Dehumanizer tour, and count five of their releases amongst my all-time favorite albums, so I should explain my problems with Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, which from 1991 through 1995 was my #1 favorite release of theirs. Since that time, I have played, studied, and written a lot of music, and can now better pinpoint why I've liked this album less and less and less over the years. Simply put: Every song gets worse as it goes, except Who Are You?, which I don't like except for the eerie synth break in the middle with the marching band-style snare drum accompaniment.\n\nI appreciate the more progressive direction on this release--and conceptually like the idea of the band including some lighter moments--but the songs generally lose their way or fizzle. My favorites on this lp---the songs Sabbath Bloody Sabbath and Sabbra Cadabra---both have endings well below the quality of the song themselves. A weird jam with a quick fade concludes the former and some go-nowhere honky tonk ends the latter. Killing Yourself to Live takes a turn for the worse at \"Get High\" though is still decent, but the chipper, uptempo part after that section kills it for me. Looking for Today is the Rock and Roll All Nite of this album: a strong verse leads to a cloying and very forced chorus. National Acrobat is awesome for a while...but then \"progresses\" into yet another unfocused jam, and I really like progressive rock, which seems to be an influence on Iommi and Co. at this point in their careers. But most of my favorite King Crimson, Yes, ELP, Eloy, Genesis, Pink Floyd, and RPI songs get better or maintain quality as they navigate their complex arrangements...\n\nAlthough MANY great Sabbath MOMENTS are on this album, singing especially, I feel that all of the good songs go downhill. To me, a good song that has 30 not good seconds at the end is tarnished and no longer fully \"good\" and why this album is less than the sum of it's parts. For the same reasons, I don't adore the almost excellent Sails of Charon by The Scorpions---that mixboard nonsense ending is real weak---and the same goes for Judas Priest's Savage, which is torpedoed at the end by the puerile refrain--\"Who's the savage?/Modern man.\"\n\nI adore Black Sabbath, but value many other albums of theirs more highly, especially Mob Rules, Heaven & Hell, Vol. 4, Master of Reality, and Tyr.\n",
        "\nAs the 70s rode by, the grandeur of classic progressive rock started to fade, while heavy metal music continued its unstoppable, nitroglycerin-fueled ascent. Judas Priest was on the rise, since '76 the undisputed rulers of all metaldom, but they would soon be challenged by a young London quintet named after a medieval artifact of torture and capital punishment. Meanwhile, the progenitors of it all saw their powers diminished by the ever-worsening behavior and addictions of their iconic frontman, Ozzy Osbourne, and their own creative implosion. Something had to be done. The band made a risky choice in parting ways with the Prince of Darkness himself, but the choice paid dividends... a fuckton lot of them. See, in order to replace a deity and maintain balance and purpose in life, one must replace it with another deity. The briefly turned three-piece band found their savior in the small-statured but gigantic persona of The Holy Ronnie James Dio, ready to pick up where he had left at the helm of Ritchie Blackmore's enormously influential Rainbow. \n\nThe chemistry was immediate, a fiercely strong alloy of metal the result, tough enough to compete with the nascent NWOBHM bands that had mixed the aggression and speed of punk music with Sabbath's own heritage. This indeed comprises a grand rebirth for Black Sabbath, and for a brief moment at the dawn of the 80s, they managed to reclaim the heavy metal throne from the suddenly toned down Priest and the recently debutant Maiden. Heaven and Hell features virtually no filler, it's all thriller. With Dio at his prime, and an inspired again Toni Iommi, the heavens were the limit... and they were reached. Iommi's decision to turn his back on commercial hard rock for good was among the best things that ever happened to metal. Had we've been left only with his incredible heavy/doom legacy from the first half of the 70s, we would've been extremely blessed anyway, but thankfully THE GODS HAVE BEEN GOOD FOR ALL OF US BELIEVERS.\n\n\u201cNeon Knights\u201d starts with propulsive Iommi riffs, some of his best ones since half a decade back, and the recognizable vox of our beloved Dio, which immediately tells us this was going to be a very different version of Sabbath, one brighter, but more energetic as well. The doom and gloom mostly gone, Dio's lyrics usually end up more introspective and thought provoking than 70s Sabbath. Instead of contemplating the strife of life by tales of war, drugs, destruction, insanity and decay, Dio addresses the listener to look inwards. Of course, social conflicts are still addressed, as in the opener. The line \u201csave us from the jackals of the streets\u201d has always brought images of urban gang fights movies and post-apocalyptic barbaric tribes like the ones from the Mad Max series. But it is mostly a journey to one's mind, heart and consciousness, lines about reaching our feelings and our two-faced morality plays. Dio's love for sword & sorcery fantasy also replaces most of the dark sci-fi the guys explored in their Ozzy years, another fact that also ensures we will enjoy both eras with their distinct characteristics. \n\nAll eight circles of Heaven and Hell are as virtually perfect as on any metal masterpiece you can think of. Although\u2026 some are more perfect than others. I would say side A kicks the shit outta side B, despite the fact that all these tunes are tip-top Sabbath quality. But \u201cChildren of the Sea\u201d, with its melodic acoustic lines and the monumental \u201cHeaven and Hell\u201d itself are A+ all-time classics of heavy metal music. \u201cLady Evil\u201d, despite its dark subject matter, is probably the most amusing track on the record, in great part because of Geezer Butler's sexy bass lines here and the simple lyrics amazingly sung about the titular magical femme fatale. On side B, \u201cWishing Well\u201d also carries this festive style, while \u201cDie Young\u201d constitutes my second favorite after the title-track, and such a resonating hymn for the metal masses, as we now accumulate a full decade without Dio sharing this doomed planet with us. \u201cWalk Away\u201d would be my choice for the least outstanding track, but closer \u201cLonely Is the Word\u201d is a tremendous finish to this masterpiece, with an almost bluesy cadence and feel, as well as Iommi's most colossal solo on the album. \n\nI'll give myself the luxury of coming up with a minor gripe about Black Sabbath\u2019s 9th full length, and it is Bill Ward's drum playing. It's just not as interesting as it was during the early Ozzy years. His signature aggressive breaks and shifts are nowhere here to be found, nor his tribal attack on air toms. That's something that started to change for the bad since Technical Ecstasy (yeah, that record in which he also sings, one of Sabbath's worse ideas ever). Both he and Geezer provide instead a simpler but clockwork-efficient path for the rest of the band to follow. Geezer remains more adventurous, and his bass tone is just gorgeous. That's something that hasn't really changed in all of Sabbath's eras. But as I said, it's just a teeny weeny piece of small useless bitching on my part, so pay no attention. The songs flat out rock the hell outta you as they are, no question about it, empowered by a flawless production. In fact, if not for Diamond Head's magnificent gem of a debut, I would pick Heaven and Hell as the best metal album released 40 years ago. A good second in my book, and the number one place in thousands of other metalheads own 1980 Best Of lists, dictates this should be revered, worshipped and played and played and played by you all 'till Hell and Heaven collide at the end of times.\n",
        "\nBy the mid-eighties, Black Sabbath had become a Tony Iommi solo project with an inconsistent line-up that changed almost yearly. The Eternal Idol was a particularly chaotic affair. The singer, drummer and bassist who started recording the album didn't stay and were replaced by a new singer and bassist as well as a stand-in drummer. Even the band manager was fired during recording. Surprisingly enough, the final result doesn't sound all over the place and sees the band return to its doom and heavy metal roots. The material however is rather uneven and makes for one of Black Sabbath's worst outputs.\n\nThe only song that fully convinces is massive doom metal epic ''Eternal Idol'' that oozes with atmosphere, creativity and classic Black Sabbath trademarks such as eerie vocals, menacing guitar tones and slow but thundering rhythm section supported by some fresh cinematic keyboard effects. It's regrettable that one of the band's very best tracks is overlooked because it can be found on an overall forgettable record that was rightfully negatively received back in the days.\n\nThe rest of the record attempts to go back to Black Sabbath's trademark sound but fails to develop the unique charm of the early years or even the more experimental albums released in the mid-eighties. The band doesn't have much chemistry which isn't a surprise considering the revolving line-up. The rhythm section sounds bland and uninspired. The guitar riffs are often repetitive and unspectacular. New singer Tony Martin has a decent melodic voice with a slightly rough undertone but he is not as emotional as Ray Gillen, not as catchy as Glenn Hughes, not as dynamic, flexible and skilled as Ian Gillan, not as dramatic and talented as Ronnie James Dio and certainly not as atmospheric, passionate and unique as Ozzy Osbourne. The gloomy keyboard work is the only element that can be described as truly convincing and that's a shame for a heavy metal album.\n\nIn the end, Black Sabbath's The Eternal Idol features an excellent title track that might figure among the band's five greatest tunes ever while the rest varies between slightly above average and slightly below average Black Sabbath material by the numbers. Some people tend to rate this record up retrospectively because they didn't like the bluesier commercial predecessor Seventh Star that is certainly an acquired taste. But while the predecessor could be controversially discussed, this record here is bland, boring and unimaginative which is certainly worse in my book. This record is only interesting for die-hard fans and collectors and I would even go as far to say that this release is the worst in Black Sabbath's discography up to the moment when it was released.\n",
        "\nSeventh Star was initially supposed to be a Tony Iommi solo album but the record company insisted on releasing it under the famous Black Sabbath banner. It's no surprise that this album doesn't have anything to do with the band's previous doom and heavy metal outputs. This release focuses on adult-oriented rock, blues rock and glam rock in the key of Def Leppard, Dokken and Whitesnake.\n\nEven though this was supposed to be a solo album, singer Glenn Hughes of Deep Purple fame is the shining star here as he finds the perfect balance between passion and skills and provides every song except for the vapid instrumental tune ''Sphinx (The Guardian)'' with energy and melody. Toni Iommi's guitar play has notable ups and downs. The passionate solo in catchy and powerful opener ''In for the Kill'' works splendidly and so does the bluesy doodling in the playful ''Heart Like a Wheel''. On other occasions such as the fluffy lead single ''No Stranger to Love'' and the concise closing ballad ''In Memory'', his play is however shockingly unspectacular. This release features live keyboarder Geoff NIchols as regular band member for the first time. His play gives the album a dreamy, fluffy and melodic note that clearly aims for commercial appeal. Fans of old date might dislike that direction but one has to admit that the keyboard play is very efficient and on the pulse of its time.\n\nOne of the record's biggest flaws is the uninspired rhythm section. The bass guitar play by Dave Spitz is almost inaudible in the production. The drum play by Eric Singer at times sounds like a drum computer, especially in the disappointing title track ''Seventh Star''. This is particularly irritating since both musicians have excellent reputation and performed in numerous excellent rock bands throughout their respective careers. As mentioned earlier, the toothless production clearly aims for commercial success but makes a soft rock record out of a potential hard rock effort. A more dynamic and gritty mastering would have rated the more streamlined tunes up quite a bit.\n\nThe remastered deluxe edition includes some rare live material with another singer, relatively unknown but very energetic Ray Gillen, and the band sounds much better on stage than in the studio. The vocals are absolutely outstanding, the guitar play is more domineering, the keyboards sound less straightforward and the rhythm section provides some much-needed energy. Sadly, the quality of those live cuts is extremely poor and sounds as if the concert had been recorded with a potato. That's truly a shame since the band was in great shape back in those days and even the older Black Sabbath tunes work splendidly and sound better than the live cuts with Ian Gillan a few years earlier.\n\nIn the end, Black Sabbath's Seventh Star should appeal to blues, glam and hard rock fans but might disappoint doom and heavy metal fans. The album is a commercial product of its time that has a certain nostalgic charm. It has its entertaining values but is also flat and predictable. If you like this type of music, you should rather listen to Bon Jovi. The deluxe edition with seven great live cuts rates this release up despite their poor sound quality. Faithful collectors can pick this obscure release up while everyone else should listen to the unusual material first before taking the risk of purchasing it.\n",
        "\n\"13\" was supposed to be the return of Ozzy meant to save Black Sabbath and have them sail off into the sunset with one more classic album. Imagine me, sitting here shocked to see the album being met with mixed to negative reviews upon its release, when in reality, the album pretty much has the same standards I always expected and had for Ozzy era Sabbath. To call a spade a spade, lets lay bare what \"13\" really is. \"13\" is an absolute cash grab of a record. One made with bloated songs that are basically retelling of many of their classic songs. They all wanted a few more million dollars since they were getting older, and Sabbath knew they had your money just from saying Ozzy was returning. The quality of this album flat out didn't matter. The cover could have been a giant middle finger with songs full of Ozzy farting into the mic and it'd have sold millions. Is \"13\" a bad record? No. Not at all. But it's entirely as mediocre as the rest of the era. Since Bill Ward wasn't joining Iommi, Geezer, and Ozzy, Brad Wilk performs drums. Not saying he's a bad drummer at all, because he's competent the whole way through, but out of all the drummers on planet Earth, I want to know what lottery he won to get the role.\n\n\"Ozzy's voice is shot,\" they said. \"He can't sing anymore,\" they all continued. And I tilt my head and ask \"When could he EVER sing?\" The fact that people put 'anymore' at the end of the statement is a mystery I will never be able to solve. The team behind \"13\" did literally everything within their technological power to make Ozzy's voice sound as good as it could with distortion and effects, but you can only put so much lipstick on a pig. The very first track \"End of the Beginning\" shows you exactly what you're in for, so it's a fitting opener. It's an absolute retelling of the self tilted track from their debut. Iommi busts out a three note riff at the same pace and style as the three notes that built the band all those years ago. The track tries to disguise what its doing by picking up the tempo sooner than the original track its mimicking did. The uptempo part that comes in actually has a very solid groove and rhythm, but it just makes me feel like I've heard it all before. It makes me want to go back and listen to some older Ozzy era stuff I enjoy. And that's not what a new album should be doing. A new album should make you want to add it to your rotation and collection. Not just put it down and go back to the old stuff. Ozzy's ad libbing of \"Alright\" and \"Okay\" towards the end of the song is also almost a comical parody of himself that makes me smile every time. The track that follows, \"God is Dead?\" is very much a missed opportunity to me. This song definitely had the frame work to be very good, but it's too bloated to even stand up and walk on two feet. Iommi alternates an eerie clean riff and a simple, but explosively heavy riff to give it its mood. Ozzy actually would have been a GREAT fit for this song in his youth, but all of the very obvious effects and distortion holding his voice together like duct tape is too much of a detraction to appreciate the melodies. I actually quite like the chorus, though. Both Iommi's riff underneath it, and Ozzy's desperate calling get stuck in my head when I listen, so they certainly accomplished that mission. But nine minutes long, guys? Come on. Have mercy. The quicker riff at the end of the song is very, very typical, basic Sabbath. Nothing about \"God is Dead?\" is terrible, but MINUTES of it could have been shaved off. It should have been 5 minutes tops. As decent as I think a lot of sections of it are, there is just no way it can hold my interest and attention for 9 minutes.\n\nThe closer \"Dear Father\" is very much similar to everything that's wrong with \"God is Dead?\" but a lot more boring. Another inflated 7 minute song that can't justify that kind of length. Iommi's riffs on this track are far, far from anything special from him. Ozzy's vocals are whiny; especially on the chorus. A positive for this song is that Geezer is really showing off his chops when the song speeds up. In general, the quicker paced segment of the song in the middle tries REALLY hard to pick the energy up, and it comes close to working, but just misses the mark. Once again, it's a good enough section to make you want to listen to other Ozzy era material, but not good enough to stand alone. It doesn't last very long either, before returning to the same monotonous verse parts it started with. It's as dull and bland as Sabbath gets. The track before, \"Damaged Soul,\" is definitely the worst the album has to offer for me. Once again, this is an attempt by the band to be super bluesy. The main riff and melodies definitely have a swing to them, so it's better in that respect than \"Sick and Tired\" off \"Forbidden\" was, but yet again, it has nowhere to go with an eight minute inflated run time. They even try to add a harmonica section as if to try and call back to \"The Wizard.\" The song pretty much has no transitions or variation to it either. You hear the first minute, you've heard the entire eight minutes minus some very noodling and uninspired solos. This one is just such a waste of time baring Geezer, who once again is the only saving grace for the song.\n\nThere are a few tracks on the record I enjoy very much, though. \"Loner\" is the star of the album. It has a powerful riff coming from Iommi that Geezer matches nicely. Ozzy is actually really getting into this song, and he's able to dial back and push forward variations of energy and emotion exactly as they're needed. The whole song does that very well to match, too. The transitions to the clean segments from Iommi give the song breathing room and thinking time that's needed to let the theme of the song sink in. \"Loner\" actually probably makes my top 10 songs from the Ozzy era, so I tip my hat to them for coming up with at least one song that lives up to their older material. I also quite like \"Zeitgeist\" a good bit. Despite the fact that it's mimicking \"Planet Caravan\" quite clearly, I actually like \"Zeitgeist\" a lot more than the song it copies. Iommi's acoustic part sets a really nice stage, and I actually think Ozzy brings out nice and extremely fitting vocal melodies for the parts, which I don't think \"Planet Caravan\" had. Geezer is giving periodic but spectacular bass work to give the tune some depth and life. Iommi's closing solo is also a very beautiful one. All in all, \"Zeitgeist\" is the track that I feel is undeservingly passed over the most from \"13.\"\n\n\"13\" isn't an awful album by any means, but I don't think it's the way ANY fan of Black Sabbath, Ozzy era or otherwise, wanted them to end their career. It's very easy to tell there were a lot of people in the kitchen cooking this record up besides the three members of Black Sabbath. There are absolutely elements of the record to enjoy here, but those elements are bogged down by an aged Ozzy, bloated songwriting, and rehashed material. I think there's enough here for Sabbath fans to give this album a listen and maybe cherry pick a song or two, but it's a real shame that Black Sabbath's legendary book closes with such a soulless cash grab of an album.\n",
        "\n\"Forbidden\" is very often cited as Black Sabbath's worst album of all time. It was a record made pretty quickly, and mostly done to fulfill record obligations. It's the last Sabbath album featuring Tony Martin, and the last Sabbath album (under this or any other name) for over a decade. The album featured the return of the \"Tyr\" lineup, which means Cozy Powell appears on drums, and Neil Murray takes back bass duties. Now, I don't think \"Forbidden\" is Black Sabbath's WORST album, but it certainly is one of them. There are three Ozzy era albums that I think are a little bit worse, but \"Forbidden\" is within reach. Many songs on the record have sparks of good elements and smart ideas, but there just wasn't enough care behind them to execute what could have been. To \"Forbidden's\" credit, there are only a couple of songs on it that are downright awful. An immediate thing I have to point out is that the trigger Cozy Powell uses on his snare drum sounds AWFUL. It's so insanely fake sounding. When he's just doing single snare hits, it's passable, but whenever he does a roll or fill on the snare, the fake hollow sound is cringe worthy. Across the record, everyone is putting on passable performances to not totally embarrass themselves, but it's very easy to tell that the passion is just not there. Tony Martin is probably the weakest on the entire record. I don't think it's his voice so much as it was the vocal rhythms he wrote that just fell apart.\n\nMy favorite track on the record is without a doubt \"Rusty Angels.\" The opening riff from Iommi is unfortunately insanely close sounding to \"Sins of the Father\" from \"Dehumanizer,\" but it's a pretty solid track despite this. Martin is really selling the quasi uplifting feeling of the song, and all of Iommi's riffs set up a great tone all by themselves. His riffs along with Powell's drum groove give this track a pretty good flow. It's definitely a different sounding Sabbath track due to the 'positive' feeling, but it still has a bit of a somberness to the chorus that doesn't make it totally out of left field. Iommi's solo, both riff underneath and actual solo, are really cool. Not the fanciest Sabbath track, nor one of my favorites when taking their whole career into consideration, but still an enjoyable track nevertheless. \"Get a Grip\" is probably the only other track from \"Forbidden\" that I listen to with any regularity at all. Iommi unleashes several pretty heavy and aggressive riffs throughout the entire track, and I find Martin's chorus to be a very catchy one. The segment right after the second chorus is a little bit to whiny and sappy for me, but it doesn't last long, and Iommi's solo makes up for it. The quicker part at the very end of the song is also quality. Iommi shows off another cool riff, and Martin's tortured vocals sell the segment before it fades out. Again, far from a perfect Sabbath track, but it's a good enough song to be memorable and enjoyable on this release.\n\nEveryone seems to immediately write off \"The Illusion of Power\" due to the inclusion of Ice T. I personally find it to be a decent addition to the album. Iommi gives it a simple, but still classically heavy riff. Martin's near rapping vocals take a little bit of getting used to, but they give the track a little bit of a frantic energy behind the heaviness of the riff to fit very nicely. I think the chorus is REALLY catchy, and Ice T's deep voice behind Martin give it a lot of depth. When Ice T himself comes in, I definitely admit that his voice is a bit too different and slightly too unfitting for Sabbath, but I absolutely would not say that he ruins anything. His segment is short and sweet, and accomplishes what it needs to. While I wouldn't hold \"The Illusion of Power\" up on any kind of pedestal, it's FAR from one of the reasons why this album isn't good. It's a unique Sabbath song for a one off experience. \"Shaking Off the Chains\" also has some of Iommi's best riff work on the record. I really dislike Martin's vocal melodies all across this track, but Iommi's riffs almost make up for it. From the verse riffs to the chorus riff, these are pure quality Iommi power. Murray's bass work is also pretty solid on this one, too. Martin is the one who really ruins the song. He sounds absolutely bored and dull singing on this one. It sounds like he was reading a newspaper while recording the vocals. I have no doubt a different Sabbath singer would have sold this song a bit better. His vocals are a prime example of the lack of passion that went into this album.\n\nThat mostly ends the compliments I can give to \"Forbidden.\" \"I Won't Cry for You\" is far from the album's worst, but it's still a pretty subpar experience. I actually really like Iommi's slightly mystical sounding clean riff over the opening and the verses, and Murray again has some decent bass work on the track too, but there's just nothing else the song has to offer to seal the deal. The song gets slightly heavier for the chorus, but just adding drums and electric guitar doesn't instantly make a better experience. The chorus is the song's dullest moment. Martin's vocals aren't his worst, but they still sound pretty sappy and pathetic. The riff and playing behind him are just dull, par for the course playing, so it definitely doesn't support such a weak chorus. It's not an awful track, but one hundred percent entirely forgettable. The title track to the record is another unquestionably lackluster and forgettable one. Once again, Iommi actually brings some pretty decent riffs to the mix, but the song just didn't have enough to it to connect the dots. After the intro, some short verse sections are introduced that are entirely dull and bland. The chorus of the song is another absolutely pathetically sappy and cringe worthy one. It's another song that just ends up sounding whiny and bored. There is truly close to zero inspiration or imagination on this song. It's an insanely standard, paint by numbers hard rock track.\n\nIt still gets even worse, too. \"Can't Get Close Enough\" is absolute garbage. The intro clean riff is simplistic and once again, Martin's vocal melodies just sound like he couldn't even care to try. It's another example of him sounding like he's reading off a sheet of paper instead of from the heart. The weak intro lasts for about a minute and a half before it goes anywhere, too. And by anywhere, I mean it goes from nothing to a slow crawl. Iommi comes in with a bit of a heavier riff, but it's still a fairly standard one from him. Even when the song picks up, Martin's vocals seem bored and desperately trying to get the listener's attention. Besides the heavy part coming in after the intro, the song has no other transitions to give it life, either. It's an utterly soulless filler track that has no inspiration from a single person on it. Worse STILL is \"Sick and Tired.\" Cozy Powell actually has a REALLY awesome drum intro to the track, but that is all there is going to it. The song is a sad attempt to make the lineup sound ultra bluesy, and it falls flat on its face. Iommi's riff sounds like a man stuck out of time. The riff sounds like a parody of a blues rock riff. it's almost insulting, because Iommi has always been blues inspired, but not to the point of near parody like this song is. Martin is just doing a ton of rambling on the track. There's not one cohesive moment on the entire run time. It absolutely sounds like a warm up jam that got thrown on the album to pad the length. \"Sick and Tired\" is without question one of the worst Black Sabbath songs of all time.\n\n\"Forbidden\" unfortunately ends up being a pretty bad chapter for Sabbath to end the Tony Martin era on. On top of that, it leaves a sour taste due to there being no other Sabbath releases for such a long stretch of time. It's a real shame because there are templates of greatness on this album. There are many cool riffs or melodies or moments interspersed that unfortunately just leave the album treading water on its best moments. Regardless, as a total package, \"Forbidden\" is definitely a dud, and is JUST outside of their bottom three albums of all time for me. Fortunately, Iommi still had another great album in him which came more than a decade later.\n",
        "\nAfter Dio's exodus following \"Dehumanizer,\" Tony Iommi once again looked for Tony Martin to help him out. The result is \"Cross Purposes.\" This time around, though, Geezer Butler stuck around, making it the only album Martin and Geezer played on together. Bobby Rondinelli was recruited to play drums, and he definitely does a fine job with some good playing on it. \"Cross Purposes\" ends up being the final good album of Black Sabbath's career (at least under that official name), too, as both the final Martin era album \"Forbidden\" and Ozzy's return with \"13\" are lackluster at best. Even still, \"Cross Purposes\" is a good release with mostly solid material making up its run time, but at the same time, even though it's a generally consistent release, it both doesn't have the stand out tracks that the other Martin releases had, and also has a decent amount of dead weight that said releases didn't have. On top of that, while Tony Martin is still an excellent singer across \"Cross Purposes,\" he's missing some of the power or enthusiasm he had on \"Headless Cross\" and \"Tyr.\" It definitely feels like on those two albums, he was pulling out all the stops to try and impress Iommi, but after he was replaced by Dio, he stopped giving it 110% upon his return for this record.\n\nOne of the standouts it DOES have, however, is \"The Hand That Rocks the Cradle.\" Iommi's light riff that Geoff Nicholls' keyboard compliments make a pretty yet still ominous introduction. Iommi's main riff that comes in after is an absolutely KILLER one, though. Probably his best riff of the album. Rondinelli helps drive it forward with a very nice groove. After the chorus, the eerie atmospheric part comes back, and the swaps between these two parts give the song the space it needed to become a really good tune. Once Iommi starts his solo for the song, he literally keeps it going until the song fades out despite a transition in parts. Iommi always loves doing fade out guitar solos, but this one was a bit different in that regard. The following track, \"Cardinal Sin,\" is my personal favorite for the record. Iommi's intro gives a very annoyed kind of doomy feel to it. With the keyboards accenting it, it feels like someone just woke a monster up from its sleep. Nicholls' keys across the main melody of the song that match Iommi give it a pretty unique and almost operatic feeling. Martin matches this theatrical style with verse melodies to match. He gives a vocal performance that leave an air of mystery behind the lines. The song also picks up very nicely mid way through. Iommi gives a riff that is much more in the forefront of the track that Rondinelli is again supporting very nicely. Martin also turns up the heat a bit more to match the power of the new riff.\n\nThe last of the album's true standouts is \"Immaculate Deception.\" Once again, this song has some of Iommi's best riffs, and Nicholls' always stellar atmospheric keys gives him weight. Geezer is also absolutely awesome on this track. His bass work is swelling and standing out behind Iommi just enough to not steal all the spotlight, and he gives more tasty grooves for the segments of the song that speed up. The song has a great variety of different parts that help it stand out with both great riffs and a plethora of slow and fast segments. Martin definitely does an acceptable job on vocals to fit each part, but Iommi and Geezer are really the two to listen for here. \"Cross of Thorns,\" despite not being quite as enjoyable as the other three I already mentioned, is still a very enjoyable track. This is probably the song on the album that Tony Martin shines the most on. The somber acoustic intro is once again really made by Nicholls' supporting keys, but Iommi comes out of that with another really heavy and very catchy riff. Martin's vocal melodies across this track, especially the verses over that Iommi riff have a fantastic flow and power to them. \"Cross of Thorns\" is another song that has enough variety and great parts all across it to make it a really good song.\n\nThe album's opener \"I Witness\" is a pretty conflicting track for me. On one hand, I LOVE the chorus to the song. Both Martin's chorus melodies and Iommi's chorus riff are fantastic, but it takes so long to even get there, and the verses and pre chorus that come before it are pretty bland. Iommi's intro is cool, and the little flourishes he gives behind the intro that come back around are neat, but the main riff of the song is very boring. Martin also sounds very bored, and like he's giving the verses minimal effort, too. The differences make the song a very unsatisfying and sour experience. I think this tracj could have been a lot more than what it ended up being with more care and attention. Similar things can be said for \"Virtual Death.\" Geezer is once again the star of this track from the very start. His bass work is deserving of its prominence, and he's setting the bar for the rest. The song has a decent riff, and I appreciate the doom-y, slogging mood it brings to the table, but it just never goes anywhere. Once more, doom-y isn't Martin's strongest suit (in fact, it's probably his weakest), so his vocal melodies again just sound bored and uncaring to me instead of spooky or depressing like I think was intended. The track also barely has any transitions or shifts at all, so it really is a drag that slogs on. \"Virtual Death\" had a good template for itself, but the structure just falls apart with monotony as it progresses. It's far from the worst on \"Cross Purposes,\" though.\n\n\"Dying for Love\" is another absolute slog of a song. This is yet another track that goes absolutely nowhere, and has very little motivation behind it. Iommi opens up the song with a one minute long solo that is as generic and bland as a guitar solo can get. It just sounds like noodling notes instead of a real structured solo. Even though Geezer is doing his best to hold the song together, it just greatly overstays its welcome. After the solo, we have another minute long part with a simplistic and equally dull clean guitar part from Iommi, and Martin's vocals are just as uninspired and bland as the rest of band is. It takes more than half the song before another riff comes in, and this is the third Iommi riff of the song that is just paint by numbers. \"Dying for Love\" truly is a disgrace of a track that has no good ideas, and yet has the audacity to be the second longest track of the record. \"Psychophobia\" is also a pretty annoying song to me. It's hard for me to describe why, but everything about this song just makes me grit my teeth. Iommi's main riff just seems too wild and random without a good punch to it, and Martin's quicker vocal melodies also don't fit it at all. The melodies sound jagged instead of smooth, so it makes the entire track piercing. The whole song sounds frantic, but in an unplanned and unstructured way, so it just makes me groan. The one saving grace about this one is that the three minute run time prevents it from being a flat out cancer, but it's still one of the most annoying and uninspired tracks of the Martin era for me.\n\nWhile \"Cross Purposes\" is still a solid album overall, it is very easy to see the seams starting to tear on it. All the signs were there on this record that spelled the beginning of the end for me. The songs started to lose the high standard the band had, and there is a lot of padding and nonsense on this record for me. Tony Martin, while still good, did not bring his A game for \"Cross Purposes.\" There is definitely still enough enjoyable material on the record to make it undeserving of being passed over, but this is far from the first Tony Martin era Sabbath album I'd show to a newcomer of the era. The album definitely has some favorites I pick out and throw on often, but it's not a release as a whole that I reach for out of the band's large discography.\n",
        "\nDespite the Tony Martin era of Sabbath being a delight for me up until this point in Sabbath's career, I gladly push it aside for \"Dehumanizer.\" The greatest Sabbath lineup of all time, which debuted on \"Mob Rules,\" returns for another Sabbath one-off. Geezer Butler returns to the fold alongside Vinny Appice, and of course, the unparalleled Ronnie James Dio on vocals. For my money, this is far and away Black Sabbath's heaviest album. Iommi sounds re-energized once again with the old gang back together, and returns to being at the top of his rift crafting work. \"Dehumanizer\" might be Vinny Appice's heaviest work of his career (though I'd say Dio's \"The Last in Line\" has more technical playing from him), and Geezer's much missed songwriting and standout bass work makes a big return here. Above all else, Dio sounds absolutely FURIOUS on this record. He still has the beauty you'd expect from his voice, but many songs on the record shows him replacing this with livid, intense, angry vocals. As another note, this album has one of my all time favorite album covers. The sinister, evil, yet cool sci-fi feeling of it is very captivating to me.\n\nNowhere does the album's heaviness show better than on the closer \"Buried Alive.\" Iommi's main riff almost sounds like a swarm of angry hornets is approaching to devour you alive. Dio's aforementioned pissed off vocals have a bit of a distortion on them that make them sound spectral along with the anger. Dio's vocal melodies also switch between anger and fear, which give the song a haunting feel to it. I daresay this track is as close as Black Sabbath comes to making an 'extreme' metal track. Despite that, though, the song's chorus brings back Dio's traditional melodic side that shows that he still has the pipes he's famous for. \"Master of Insanity\" is all Geezer. This was a track that he literally carried over from one of his solo projects, and Sabbath really changed very little about it. Riffs are almost identical, a lot of the vocal melodies remained the same, and the chorus is exactly the same. If you haven't heard the demo from his band of this track, go out of your way to do so. Sabbath sped it up some, and obviously improved it with their master craftsmanship, but it's a GREAT song either way. Geezer leads the way himself with a fantastic bass intro before Iommi's main riff. Dio's perfected blend of anger and beauty is also on full display on the song. The chorus is powerful and catchy, and Vinny shows off his great flow with matching drum work accenting each riff and bass hook.\n\nGeezer also brought with him the title for \"Computer God,\" which opens up the album. However, unlike \"Master of Insanity,\" the song is entirely different from his original demos. Only the title remained the same. \"Computer God\" is both my favorite song from this record, and also my favorite Black Sabbath song of all time. Vinny Appice opens the song up with a really heavy and satisfying drum intro that really demonstrates how underrated he is. I also find that the drums over the clanging of metal in the background set a good tone for both the track and the album. Iommi's riff stomps the ominous tune forward before Dio opens with his absolutely foreboding vocal melodies. Geezer also gets some moments to add little bass flourishes when there's a pause. Iommi's chorus riff is incredibly catchy for me, and Dio complements this with an awesome mixture of beautiful melody and theatrical warning. About halfway in, after the second chorus, Iommi slows the song down with a wonderful clean guitar part where Dio really gets to show the true beauty behind his voice. After that, the song picks back up to where it was for one more short moment before exploding into the song's final much quicker section. Iommi gives a great solo before Dio rushes in to finish the song's journey. Now, his vocal melodies are a mixture of anger and disappointment. Vocals that represent warnings being ignored, which led to a doomed conclusion. \"Computer God\" just has layers upon layers of depth and variety to it. Especially as an opener, there's so much to listen out for. Every member of the band is doing something special somewhere on it. One of the most underrated songs in all of the Dio era is \"Letters from Earth\" for me. Iommi has a ton of really killer underrated riffs on the track. The intro riff has an great flow, the verse riffs have an aggressive groove, and the riff he uses right before the solo for a bit is SUPER heavy. Dio's vocal melodies have a very distinct feel that sounds separate from the riff, but still connects back to it. The chorus is another catchy one, and Vinny is connecting the dots with his fills and crashes both for Dio and Iommi. Iommi is also adding periodic spacey guitar flourishes and accents, along with some light keyboard work to give the song some atmospheric weight fitting of the title.\n\nProbably the song I hear talked about the most from \"Dehumanizer\" is \"I.\" It's well deserving of the attention, too. Even though there are a handful of tracks from the album I prefer and wish got more attention, \"I\" is still pure Dio era Sabbath magic. Iommi busts out some trademark heavy riffs, and it's another track where Dio's powerful anger shines through and enhances the mood. Despite his anger on the song, though, his vocals, especially the chorus, have a very uplifting feeling. Only a singer of Dio's caliber is able to make his vocals so juxtaposed in such a magnificent way. Geezer also has a very underrated bass groove underneath the chorus. It's another Geezer part that is easy not to notice, but as soon as you pay attention to how brilliant it is, it'll draw your attention every time you hear it from then on. The biggest outlier on \"Dehumanizer,\" and I mean that in a good way, is \"Too Late.\" The song is absolute beauty, and the track on the album where Dio shows the least anger, and gives us his famous melodic voice the most. Iommi opens with a fantastic acoustic part, and with Dio's sad vocals, it gives a feeling of sitting around a warm campfire to hear a story after a cold night. Once Vinny comes in, he's able to display the perfect amount of power in his drumming without overdoing it and ruining the somber beauty of the track. It's not all acoustic, though, as Iommi goes from acoustic to electric for the second chorus. Dio's vocals get appropriately more aggressive once the electric guitar kicks in. Still not with the glaring anger he has on the rest of this record, but he turns up the heat enough to make the transitions have weight. \"Too Late\" is really a journey of a track that runs the gambit of emotions and moods, and does them all justice. It gives some much needed air to \"Dehumanizer.\"\n\nUnfortunately, though, I have to point out that \"Dehumanizer\" does have one song weighing it down. It's the one and only Dio era Black Sabbath song I dislike, and find very little redeeming about. That song is \"Time Machine.\" What a weak song. \"Time Machine\" doesn't deserve to stand along with any of the other Dio era songs. \"Time Machine\" wouldn't be a bad song for most of the other Sabbath eras, but I expect better of this lineup. Iommi's main riff on the song is pathetically weak. It has no balls and no weight behind it. It's a paper thin sounding riff. I also don't like any of Dio's vocal melodies. None of the melodies are exceptional or super fitting. His chorus melodies are maybe the worst of the worst. They sound bored, and don't have the power or drive that Dio almost always provides. Iommi's chorus riff and Geezer's bass work in the spacey transition part are probably the only two good things I can say about the track. Otherwise, this song is an utter disappointment. I'm also not the biggest fan of \"After All,\" but it's still leagues above \"Time Machine.\" \"After All\" is without a doubt a more traditionally Sabbath feeling doom-y song. Both Iommi's riffs and Dio's vocal melodies are downtrodden and depressing. They both set a very good atmospheric tone for the song, but the tune just doesn't really pick up enough for me. Despite the mood being spot on, the song really drags its heels way more than it should. Every section of the song takes just a bit too long, and although I do enjoy this track, I find myself wanting to fast forward bits and pieces of it for it to make its point faster. Still a quality song despite that.\n\nI put \"Dehumanizer\" as Sabbath's second best album of all time behind \"Mob Rules.\" It definitely has more fat that could have been trimmed off of it than \"Heaven and Hell\" or \"Mob Rules\" has, but as a full product, I still think the aggressive heaviness of this record makes it a bit better than the very, very safe \"Heaven and Hell\" sound. Sadly, though, Dio's return didn't last long. \"Dehumanizer\" ended up being another one off for this lineup. After another disagreement, Dio once again left with Vinny Appice to go back to his solo band, and Iommi would look back to Tony Martin to pick the pieces up. This lineup would fortunately have one last hurrah with each other much later in their careers, though. Even with a different band name upon their return over 15 years after this record, this devil you know will ALWAYS be Black Sabbath to me.\n",
        "\nAfter the new Tony Martin era of Black Sabbath was able to release a true gem with \"Headless Cross,\" they were able to follow with an album that almost matched \"Headless Cross\" with \"Tyr.\" Now, the first thing to note about \"Tyr\" is that it's, again, a VERY different kind of Black Sabbath album. It's not quite as riff focused as pretty much every other Sabbath album is. Tony Iommi is still delivering quality riffs of course, but both the song structure and the production on top of that give everyone else more room. It might be Iommi's least prominent album, but on the flip side, it's Powell and Martin's MOST prominent album, and I find they make up for that very well. \"Tyr\" pretty much gives us the same lineup as the previous album, but Neil Murray takes over on bass. I don't think his bass work is nearly as prominent as Cottle's was on the last album, but he still does a respectable job, and stands out nicely when he has his moments.\n\nThe first song I like to point out is \"The Law Maker.\" It's a really fun and energetic track. Iommi delivers a great riff to open it up and Cozy Powell's strong consistent pounding really gives the song the life it needed. Tony Martin comes in very powerfully on the song, and the chorus is both catchy and equally strong. I definitely want to note that there's a line in the song that always makes me think. \"Silver mountains won't save you from hell, the prince of darkness inside you will dwell.\" I might be reading too much into the line, but I always thought these were subtle references to Dio and Ozzy who came before Martin. Silver mountains of course being a reference to Dio's classic \"Man on the Silver Mountain\" from his Rainbow days, and obviously, Ozzy has always been nicknamed the Prince of Darkness. Again, I might be over analyzing, but it's good thought food. I'd love to be given the chance to ask Martin or Iommi about it. In any case, \"The Law Maker\" may not be the fanciest track on the record, but it's just a great kick-ass, adrenaline fueled Martin era Sabbath track. You can also guess from the album's title, but there's a good amount of Norse references and themes across the album. Once again, that's a clear indication of what a different kind of Sabbath album \"Tyr\" is. Nowhere is this more apparent than on the combinations of \"The Battle of Tyr,\" \"Odin's Court,\" and finally \"Valhalla.\" These three songs all seamlessly fade into each other, so I really consider them one song. The first is your basic atmospheric instrumental. \"Odin's Court\" is an acoustic mood setting interlude. Both of these tracks are really building both a narrative and the frame for \"Valhalla.\" \"Odin's Court\" is a very nice track that does its job very well, though. Tony Martin gives a really beautiful performance, and of course, Geoff Nicholls' keyboards are essential to this kind of story telling. \"Valhalla\" is another explosive performance from the band. Iommi leads the way with a heavy and triumphant riff. Tony Martin brings yet another really catchy chorus, and the power and emotion that the song's theming absolutely required. Once again, I give Martin tons of credit here, because a singer who didn't take the story or theme seriously could have absolutely killed the song dead in its tracks, but Martin is selling it in his voice like a million bucks. These three tracks, again, are far from the fanciest or best Sabbath has to offer, but the story telling behind it is an awesome change of pace, and they're still solid, enjoyable tracks.\n\nNowhere does Tony Martin shine more than the opener \"Anno Mundi,\" though. For me, this song is easily the biggest highlight of his entire career. Tony Iommi's clean opening riff reminds me a little bit too much of \"Children of the Sea,\" but the rest of the song is dynamite after that little nitpick. Iommi's main riff isn't his most catchy or technical, but it has this grinding aggression to it that really paces the track very well. The range Martin shows on \"Anno Mundi\" is incredible. He's able to deliver both beautifully melodic vocals as well as more serious and gruffer vocals in measured variation. He even fits the chanting vocals that are interspersed throughout the song perfectly. I know this will still be too cheesy for a lot of people, but his dedication really saves the song from being a comical joke. This all culminates in how he sings the \"your eyes are burning\" line. He double tracks himself, and his high notes are so fantastic here. The emotion and strength bring a visceral combination. Cozy Powell is also delivering some really impressive fills behind this whole section, and Iommi's riff is simple, but has the perfect amount of heaviness the section needed. This section loops to fade the song out, and it'll definitely leave you needing to catch your breath if you're singing along. Cozy Powell is also the one to listen to on \"The Sabbath Stones.\" He delivers beats all throughout this track that set the frame for every section perfectly. After the intro, his crashes and fills are accents that amplify every note being played by Iommi. Iommi's riff on the song is solid, but not his best. Powell's playing helps Iommi sound like there's more power in his riff than there might be with different drum work behind it. After this, the song settles down to a calmer acoustic section. The rhythm section is everything here. Murray's bassline is prominent and tasty, Nicholls' keys are essential to the 'calm before the storm,' feeling, and Powell's now calmer snare rim shots absolutely make the change of pace. The later, faster section of this song might be Iommi's best riffing on the entire album, too. With another perfect ride pattern beat from Powell, Iommi delivers a riff that is both heavy, and VERY catchy once the song speeds up. It's a very underrated riff, and it makes the song pretty special to have moments where every single member stands out for a section or so. The final riff of the song that Martin matches with his vocals is a great way to close the book on \"The Sabbath Stones.\"\n\nOne of the more unique tracks on \"Tyr\" is \"Jerusalem.\" Iommi has another very solid riff on the track, and Martin harmonizes his vocals over the last few notes of it. Like he does very often, Martin wrote a very catchy, melodic chorus to culminate this song. Much like \"The Law Maker,\" this song is just another very fun one with the right mood and good playing across it. It's a song that I don't think would have fit on any other Sabbath album besides \"Tyr,\" though. The ending is also a personal favorite of the Martin era for me. The notes Martin has been singing over Iommi's riff the whole song get multi tracked and sung on their own without the rest of the band to give it a unique standout. \"Feels Good to Me\" is \"Tyr's\" filler track, unfortunately. It's a very, very boring standard power ballad. While it's absolutely a boring track, less so than the quality of the song itself, it's just SO unfitting with literally every other song on this album. While every other song on the record follows Norse or fantasy themes, this one takes a personal love song-like vibe that absolutely shatters the themed immersion the rest of the album tries so hard to build. It's pretty much as out of place as you can possibly make a song. And on an album where the themes and mood are a huge part of it, immersion breaking like that is an absolute death sentence.\n\nNow, I love \"Tyr,\" but this is an album that I can absolutely understand how some people may not. It's not a record like \"Headless Cross\" was, where I felt it was just a victim of circumstance. I'm sure for most people it's enough of a deterrent that this record doesn't have the original lineup, but adding the fact that Tony Iommi is definitely less prominent on this record, and it makes sense. I just find that \"Tyr\" gives powerful enough performances from everyone else, along with Iommi's support, to make up for that. The album might be Martin's best on his own, as well as Powell's best work with Sabbath. I also find the deeply routed Norse and fantasy themes to be a nice breath of fresh air for Black Sabbath. Do I think they should have stayed in this direction? No. Not at all. But as a one off experience, I think \"Tyr\" is a greatly underrated record. However, much to my delight, there was an old friend of the band that was looming on the horizon of \"Tyr\" to come back and say hello.\n",
        "\nAfter the mess that was \"The Eternal Idol,\" Black Sabbath become laser focused when delivering \"Headless Cross.\" Hands down, \"Headless Cross\" is the greatest non-Dio Black Sabbath record. No question. Everyone has their A-game on for this record. Tony Iommi and Tony Martin are backed by the solid playing of Laurence Cottle on bass, and the absolutely incredible Cozy Powell on drums. Cozy is an absolute master of his craft, and fit the Martin-era Sabbath sound perfectly. Tony Martin found an identity with this record, and he no longer sounds shaky or hesitant like he did on \"The Eternal Idol.\" He shows what he's really capable of when he's able to build an album from the ground up along with the rest of his band mates.\n\n\"Call of the Wild\" is a good track that demonstrates the sum of what this lineup brought to the table for \"Headless Cross.\" A good, more thematic riff comes from Iommi before Cottle's bass helps Tony Martin's intro. On the chorus, Martin gives some powerful notes, and Powell uses an incredibly tasty beat during it with a brilliant ride pattern that swaps in some china cymbals for accent and variety. During this section as well, Iommi brings a dancingly ominous riff that Geoff Nicholls' keys support. After the solo, Tony Martin picks his power up some more, which keeps the energy of the song up. Everyone is really doing their part in supporting the other band members, and building a solid collaborated effort. Of course, the title track of the album is a brilliant one. Iommi's main riff is trademark heaviness from him. However, he gives the rest of the band a LOT of room on the verses to do their own thing. On the main verses, Tony Martin really sets the tone for the song with some more dramatic vocals, and Nicholls' spooky keys add to the atmosphere the song builds. Cottle's bass is doing a lot of subtle, cool little flourishes behind it as well. On this section, as well as a lot of moments throughout the album, Cottle's bass work can easily be overlooked, but he's doing tons of simple, but very interesting work. The track's chorus is explosively powerful and catchy. Martin really belts out some impressive pipes for it. Iommi's heavy riffs almost play a supporting roll each time they come in. They're always entering at moments to help the song take off, and he really picks up the other members on his entry every time. His riffs are still quality and signature even though he's a bit more supportive. His solo is fantastic (another moment where Cottle really shines, too), and it's just very interesting and brave to me that he took the role he did on this song.\n\nSabbath really pace themselves well, and take the time to build an epic from the ground up on \"When Death Calls,\" too. This was a song that absolutely couldn't be rushed to have the impact it has. Iommi's playing starts out very soft but atmospheric, which the keys and Cozy's cymbal swells add to greatly. Martin has a great voice to deliver the slow burn, and once again, he's able to increase his power and energy with measured success along with the others as the song builds up. For the chorus, the band erupts with simple, but heavy playing that culminates the melodic journey before settling back down. Iommi adds a bit of acoustic guitar in the back just a touch, and mid way through the song, it picks up into a consistently heavy, strong groove led by Iommi. Martin keeps the drama of the song going with his theatrical warnings. A guest guitar solo from Queen's Brian May is also a welcome introduction to the song, and I just want to give him a ton of credit for doing a solo that is INCREDIBLY fitting of a Black Sabbath track. \"When Death Calls\" is a pure, great example of mood setting absolutely making a song. My favorite track on the entire magical record, and my favorite song of the entire Martin-era is the criminally underrated closer \"Nightwing.\" Again, a big part of this song is the mood and theatrics of it. Iommi leads with beautiful acoustic work, Martin again really sets the tone with his dramatic vocals. His chorus shouts really show off what power he has in his voice. Iommi's main verse riff is equal parts heavy and ominous, which makes perfect juxtaposition with his melodic acoustic parts. But the star element of this song is the solo for me. Iommi throws in an absolutely incredible acoustic guitar solo that is just not talked about enough. \"Nightwing's\" solo absolutely deserves to be in Iommi's top 10 solos he has ever done. It adds an incredible amount of beauty and depth to the song, and makes it feel alive, right before a heavier electric solo. \"Nightwing\" is another track that enjoys taking its time on the journey, and paces itself well enough to become a special song.\n\n\"Black Moon\" is also a very, very unique Black Sabbath song to me. It has one of the most interesting grooves to it that Iommi's riff creates. It's a very catchy riff, and Cottle's bass is actually matching it every time it comes in. The start and stop groove they both have actually make it essential for Cozy Powell's drum work to keep the pounding nature going. Martin's vocal style on the track also takes a lot of start and stop breaks, so Powell is really the one that keeps the whole thing together. The chorus is once again both amazingly powerful from Martin, and insanely catchy. Iommi also has a really strong solo on it. \"Black Moon\" is far from the most complicated song, but it just has such a unique and catchy, fun feeling to it. The only track on \"Headless Cross\" that I don't feel is quite up to snuff is \"Kill in the Spirit World.\" Now, \"Kill in the Spirit World\" is still a FANTASTIC track that absolutely does not weigh the album down at all, but I just think it's lacking a little something compared to the rest. The song might have some of Iommi's catchiest riffs, and Martin's verse vocals give a bit of a different mood then the riff that makes the song stand out from the rest. I think the chorus is pretty weak, though, and this song, like much of the album, tries very hard to have a theatrical mood to it, but it falls just a tiny bit short compared to the rest of the album. Cozy's fills are dynamite on it, however. Again, these might be minor nitpicks, considering it's still a very enjoyable song, but that's really just a testament to how great \"Headless Cross\" really is.\n\n\"Headless Cross\" does very little wrong. In fact, I believe the only 'crime' this album committed was being different. It's not the Black Sabbath people immediately expect upon hearing the name of the band, and Tony Martin doesn't have the legendary status Dio does (not at all trying to insinuate he's on Dio's level, mind you) to nullify the fact that it isn't the original lineup. I believe that everyone should do their best to give \"Headless Cross\" a fair shot as a record without trying to compare it to anything that came before it. It's an awesome record in every sense of the word, and I truly think it deserves so much more praise than it will ever receive.\n",
        "\nIf you look at the history surrounding \"The Eternal Idol,\" you'd notice that the recording process of this album was an absolute mess. The album underwent a staggering amount of personnel changes before release, both within the band and behind the scenes. We end with, of course, Tony Iommi, accompanied by returning Eric Singer on drums from the previous album, Bob Daisley filling in on bass, and Tony Martin on vocals. With all of these changes, it's pretty amazing that the band was able to make \"The Eternal Idol\" a pretty good album, though. The Tony Martin era of Sabbath is one of the most criminally overlooked eras of any band. Is it the same Sabbath sound as the one that got them their fame? No. Of course not. Is it still really good material? Absolutely.\n\nNow, the first thing to note is that the production on this album is absolute garbage. Probably the worst production values on any Sabbath album, especially considering that their 70's albums were WAY better produced despite this one being nearly 20 years later. As with \"Seventh Star,\" the bass is nearly nonexistent, Iommi sounds very thin, and Eric Singer's drums sound very, very distant. The entire album has this muddy, choppy, far off feeling. Nothing is crisp or clear at all. If you're listening to something else, and then you play a song from this album, it always makes you feel like your speakers/headphones broke in some way. The production is EASILY this album's biggest strike. Even considering all of the problems that occurred when recording this album, it's still unacceptable. Tony Martin still hadn't quite found his voice entirely on this album as well. He's still a very good singer, but on all future albums, his style is definitely more deliberate and noticeable than on \"The Eternal Idol.\" Maybe it was the fact that he was basically re-recording Ray Gillen's original vocals, so he was trying too hard to copy them, but whatever the case, he definitely sounds different and less distinct on this album than he would on all future releases with Sabbath.\n\nBut all of that aside. How is the music? \"Ancient Warrior\" is one of most traditionally Sabbath tracks of the record. After a very short keyboard intro from Geoff Nicholls, Iommi enters with a very crunchy, heavy riff. He would continue to deliver very solid riffs all across this song. Martin sells the mood of this song very well with solid notes, and the right emotions where they're needed, and Nicholls' atmospheric yet light keyboard work adds a lot of depth and mood to the whole thing to help bring it together nicely. The chorus especially is very powerful, and Iommi has a cool solo on the track. \"Nightmare\" definitely has a similar vibe going on during it. Once again, Geoff Nicholls brings a perfect yet short keyboard intro to give the song the opening mood it needed. Its a dreamy melody that still has an ominous feeling in the lower held notes behind it that allude to the song's titular theme. Iommi's riff on the track is another strong, heavy one with a really great groove flowing it forward. After the second chorus section, the song takes a bit of a tone shift and becomes slightly more aggressive with Iommi's new riff accompanied by a laughing section. Martin is able to adapt to the change well with a matching power to his voice. Still very melodic, but with a bit more fire behind it. The two different feels the song has help make it a very enjoyable listen that doesn't become stale.\n\nI'm honestly pretty surprised the band didn't choose to make \"Lost Forever\" the album's opener. It has the same kind of feel from Iommi's riff as \"Neon Knights\" or \"Turn Up the Night\" did. It's a quick, energetic but simple riff to give the song its energy, but Iommi also gives a much better, more memorable riff on short transition elements all throughout. Tony Martin does a really good job on this song. He's able to mix the strong energy the instrumentals give him to work with, but is also able to keep his singing melodic and pleasant to listen to. On the final section that fades the song out where he repeats the song's title, he delivers a measured amount of desperation in his voice to sell the mood. The album's actual opener \"The Shining\" (definitely based off the book/film) is still a spectacular one, though. It's definitely one of the most varied, well written songs of the entire album. After a fantastic intro that mixes clean and electric playing from Iommi, the track explodes into maybe Iommi's best riff of the album. A catchy riff with his signature feel all over it. This song was a really a make or break moment for Tony Martin, too. A lot of the verse sections give him a LOT of space with just drums and very light bass and keyboard work behind him. If he wasn't up to the task of holding the song up during these moments, the track would have absolutely fallen apart. And the last thing you want is for your opening track with a new singer to fall flat. The chorus is an absolutely fantastic one. Martin's double tracked shouting chorus is both catchy and strong. Before the solo, the song slows down a bit, giving a good mix of Iommi and Martin together for a more melodic section. Iommi's riff is a fantastic combination of heavy and melodic to give Martin a strong backbone to set the tone for this section. Iommi's post-solo riff is also another FANTASTIC one, and it leaves a good impression despite only used as a short transitional riff. It's very easy to tell that the most work and passion on this record went into \"The Shining.\"\n\nIommi also delivers a fantastic and catchy main riff on \"Hard Life to Love,\" too. It still has his signature feeling to it, but it's a really addicting riff. Eric Singer probably does his best work on this track, too, throwing in short, but solid fills throughout the verses. Martin gives another strong chorus on top of it, too. He actually dials back on the power of his voice when delivering it, and gives it an almost 'matter of fact' feel that is both unique and very fitting of the mood of the track. Everything about this song is just fun, catchy, powerful Martin-era Sabbath material. Well done throughout. Sadly, all is not amazing, though. Without a doubt, \"Born to Lose\" is the worst track on the record. It's a really bad one. Iommi opens up with a pretty standard riff. Pretty quickly, Martin comes in, and at first, with the way he sings, it sounds like he's just ad libbing a little bit before the actual verses of the song start, but then when he keeps going, it's jarring to realize these ARE the verse melodies. His \"Aaah aaah\" calls are cringe worthy. Martin just isn't the right singer for that kind of soulful wordless ad libbing. His notes are bad, and he sounds very hesitant and bored doing them. The chorus of the song also feels no different at all from the verse sections, so it lacks a punchy or passion that a chorus should really have. \"Born to Lose\" sounds like an insanely thrown together afterthought of a track. As if they finished the record, and then were told they needed one more track to fill more time on the album, and pushed this one out quickly.\n\n\"The Eternal Idol\" is truly an album where the behind the scenes problems show in the final product of the release. The album behind those problems is actually quite a good one. The production value of this record is almost the death of it, and I definitely think my score for this album would be higher if not for that. Besides \"Forbidden,\" this one is probably the worst of the Tony Martin-era, but it still has a lot working for it, and is worth the listen. You can feel that \"The Eternal Idol\" was the building blocks of something else, and fortunately for Tony Martin, unlike Ian Gillan and Glenn Hughes, he got a chance to take a second shot at his work with Sabbath. This release did a stellar job at starting a new lineup strong, and planting the seeds for something even greater that was to come.\n",
        "\nAfter the one-off album that \"Born Again\" was, \"Seventh Star\" becomes another one-off. Now, it's pretty common knowledge that this was supposed to be a solo album, but got converted into a Black Sabbath album, but that shouldn't instantly doom the album. Much like my review for \"Technical Ecstasy,\" I also think this album is such an odd mix of enjoyable, slightly underrated songs, and utter nonsense. This time around, Iommi is backed by Glenn Hughes on vocals, Dave Spitz on bass, and Eric Singer on drums. All three of them are competent musicians (at least from the very little of Dave Spitz I can hear), but I definitely wouldn't say any of them are particularly special on the album. Glenn Hughes especially, I always found to be a better backup singer like he was during his Deep Purple tenure than a lead singer. He's definitely solid on \"Seventh Star,\" though.\n\n\"In for the Kill\" starts the album with the best track it has to offer. It's a pounding, driving track, and Eric Singer plays slightly off time with his main drum beat to give the song a pretty cool, technical feeling. Hughes shows some great depth to his vocals on the track, and the chorus is absolutely electric. It's definitely one that's going to get stuck in your head. After the second chorus, Iommi comes in with a cool short transition riff before a rather nice solo on the song. \"In for the Kill\" is a very underrated Sabbath track that might be very different than their roots and famous material, but is still fantastic. \"Danger Zone\" is the only other truly superb track on the record. Iommi's main riff on this song is a terrific one that can easily stand up for itself, and is worthy of his name. I'm not a big fan of the chorus, but Hughes' verse melodies that he sings over that great riff are definitely strong enough to not make the song fall flat. As the track goes on, he keeps trying to add a bit more power to them with each verse, too. \"Danger Zone\" isn't trying to do anything fancy, but it's definitely a very good song for what it looks to do.\n\nThe title track of the album is the song that tries to be the most Sabbath-like of the bunch. It's still a very good song, too. Iommi's main riff is a pretty trudging and doom-y one, and the chorus is absolutely fantastic. While Hughes certainly isn't bad by any means on this track, I definitely think this was a song that Dio or Tony Martin could have made even better than it is. His notes are great, but he's just missing a bit more emotion on his voice that could have taken the song to the next level. The verse melodies leave a little bit to be desired, but everything else is good enough around it to make up for it. The middle section gives a phenomenal atmospheric keyboard melody that sounds like orchestration right before Iommi brings in a solo that isn't matching the notes, but has a very similar feel and groove to it. Singer also gives some nice, versatile china cymbal hits during this section to add some weight to the solo. Iommi gives another very traditional and powerful riff at the very end of the song to fade it out. The last of the song's on \"Seventh Star\" that are enjoyable at all is \"Turn to Stone.\" Eric Singer opens up with a short, but energizing little solo. Once again, the chorus of this track is really what makes it interesting. The band really nailed the choruses for a ton of this album. The verses as well as most of Iommi's riffs on the song are merely average, but with the great chorus as well as a really great solo, and a driving energizing feeling to the whole track, it makes \"Turn to Stone\" a decent enough addition to be a worthy of the album's track list. While simple in concept, it doesn't overstay its welcome, which was necessary.\n\nThe other half of this album is very bad, though. \"No Stranger to Love\" is just an absolute drag. However, I will say, if you've never seen the music video for this song, I strongly recommend you do so. Tony Iommi has to act like he's having a breakup, and clearly, Mr. Iommi was not born to be an actor. It's awkward in a delightful way, and the cuts between a random wolf running around and Hughes trying to give the camera these deep looks is incredible. To give the song credit, again, as I've said a few times, the chorus is definitely catchy in a sappy cheesy way, but that's about all the song has to offer. Iommi is giving one of his most basic performances ever, and while Hughes is doing his very best to sell the emotion, the whole song is just so uncharacteristically sappy that it just comes off as parody to me rather than genuine. \"In Memory\" just didn't need to exist, either. It's two and a half minutes, and definitely seemed like it was supposed to be an outro piece or an 'epilogue' to the album, but it's just entirely pointless. Basic acoustic playing and riffing from Iommi and Glenn Hughes basically just repeating himself a lot just leaves me scratching my head as the album ends. It's one of the weakest and questionable ways they could have ever ended an album. The track sounds like it should have been a transitional moment in \"No Stranger to Love\" rather than its own song.\n\nThe absolute worst is \"Heart Like a Wheel,\" though. Hands down one of the all time worst Black Sabbath songs out of any lineup. There is almost no more boring song that is devoid of any good ideas than this one. And it's EASILY the longest track on the whole record, too! This is nothing but a boring, repetitive blues jam that has nothing to offer. Not one riff, one solo, one vocal melody, one drum rhythm...nothing is even remotely redeemable about this song. It goes absolutely nowhere for a near 7 minute run time, and the repetition to the song is truly staggering. The song writing has no structure at all. It feels like every single member of the band is playing their parts on the fly. The song sounds like a studio warm up that someone recorded and decided to stick on the record. Absolutely unacceptable. Bassist Dave Spitz basically is nonexistent on the record too. The bass is BARELY audible enough to tell that there is one, but there is not one moment where it is noticeable. I honestly can't tell if this was because Spitz was a bad player, or if they just drowned him out in the mix \u00e0 la Metallica.\n\nI don't judge \"Seventh Star\" with the mindset of \"should this be a Black Sabbath album.\" Quite frankly, I've heard enough people tell me my favorite Sabbath records aren't 'real' Sabbath records as well, so the thought doesn't even cross my mind. I look at \"Seventh Star\" and ask if it's a good album period. While I don't think \"Seventh Star\" is AWFUL by any means, it certainly is on shaky ground. It is an album with a few enjoyable moments, but is otherwise pretty forgettable beyond that. You should definitely throw this album on a few times in your life, because I think a lot of people will be able to cherry pick a few songs to keep around from it. That being said, once you've found that small number, there is very little about this album that you'll rediscover if you ever decide to revisit it. It's a bit of a 'one/two and done' album. Thankfully, though, Iommi would soon pick up some new musicians to give Black Sabbath another era worth talking about.\n",
        "\nAfter the departure of Ronnie James Dio and Vinny Appice, Sabbath once again found themselves needing members to fill their lineup. Deep Purple's Ian Gillan would be called in to fill the role of the former, and original drummer Bill Ward makes his return as well as his final Sabbath appearance on \"Born Again.\" The album is undoubtedly a solid one, but Gillan just doesn't click with the other three to me. Don't get me wrong, he has ALWAYS been a phenomenal singer, and he absolutely kills it on \"Born Again,\" but at the same time, I just don't feel his voice, and the rhythm in which he sings his verses fit with Iommi's riffs most times. The disjointed and sometimes confused nature of some of these songs leave the album as a solid but also standard experience instead of an incredible one.\n\nThe song this shows on the most to me is \"Zero the Hero.\" Iommi busts out a super heavy, grinding riff that really sets up an angry mood, but Gillan's voice just doesn't fit when he comes in. He's still singing the verses like this is a Deep Purple song, and it isn't. His flow is utterly unmatching of the riff he's singing on. It almost feels like he's singing an entirely different song over the riff. His vocal melodies just aren't matching the instrumentals at all. He's not singing with the riff, he's not singing on the riff, he's not singing across the riff. He's just kind of ranting out his vocal melodies randomly. With a more fitting Sabbath singer, this song could have been an absolutely epic and powerful song. Instead, it's just a competent one. The chorus is very good, though. The title track is another example of where Gillan COMPLETELY misses the mark. Iommi's main riff might be the most downright depressing and somber of his entire career. The notes along with the distortion are just so sad and mentally heavy. It's pure doom-y glory. Now, a singer who understood this could have tapped into the insanely solemn emotion Iommi set up to make this a mastercraft of doom and heavyness. However, when Gillan comes in, instead of sounding like a man who lost everything dear to them like the vocals should have sounded like, he sings with the emotion of someone who forgot their keys on the way to the car, and had to go back inside to get them. His notes are all well done, and it's not like he's singing poorly, but he one hundred percent missed the mark on the emotions the song was built on. Although the chorus of the track is downright terrible, just to show his incredible chops, Gillan belts out a trademark scream that is the closest he ever comes to fitting the track correctly. So once again, this just remains a decent Sabbath track instead of a legendary one it could have been.\n\nThere are definitely tracks Gillan fits better on, though. The opener \"Trashed\" is without a question one of them. Geoff Nicholls' keyboards lead a triumphant sounding intro before Gillan comes flying in. Iommi definitely doesn't have a great riff on the song, but Gillan does such a great job that he holds the track up despite this. Geezer also gives a prominent and flowing bassline behind him to supplement the weaker riff too. This is a pretty average track with all things considered, but it's a perfect example of the type of song Sabbath needed to write to fit Ian's style best. My personal favorite song on the record is \"Disturbing the Priest.\" It is definitely the best blend of Black Sabbath and Ian Gillan that the album has to offer. The song has that doom-y, evil feeling atmosphere from the band, and Ian is really able to sell this particular track very well. His laughs, screams, and shrieks are an absolute treat. They absolutely make the song. The screams after the chorus sound absolutely tortured behind Iommi's simple riff, and during that chorus, Bill Ward compliments Gillan's vocal rhythms well. Unfortunately, I think this is the only song on the record that is the perfect compliment of Black Sabbath and Ian Gillan's styles, instead of leaning heavier in one direction or the other.\n\nThe final two tracks on the album are definitely where \"Born Again\" suffers, however. These two songs are demonstrations that this album needed more time in the writing stages. This lineup was clearly running out of ideas by this point. \"Hot Line\" honestly sounds like an underdeveloped outtake to me. It's not horrible by any means, but it is one of the most paint by numbers metal song you'll ever hear. It sounds like a song a college band would write. Not Black Sabbath. Iommi's main riff is absolutely nothing special at all, and neither Ward nor Geezer really have much to add to it. Gillan stands out the most with a decently catchy chorus, and he really tries selling the track with his screams and bellows, but it goes absolutely nowhere. Five minutes, and the song doesn't have any great transitions or different sounding parts to it. What you hear within the first thirty seconds is what keeps going and going for five minutes. \"Keep It Warm\" is far worse than that, though. Where \"Hot Line\" was at least an acceptable track, if not boring, \"Keep It Warm\" is terrible. Everything I said about \"Hot Line\" is the same here, but worse. Iommi's riff is terrible, again, Geezer and Ward are pretty much phoning it in, and Gillan is far from good on this one. It tries to be this ultra blusey track, but this song is just dead on arrival. To call this song bland would be an understatement. Iommi giving a solid solo is probably the only redeemable thing about the entire song. Like I said before, this song sounds like something a local bar band would write. Not a combination of Black Sabbath and Deep Purple.\n\n\"Born Again\" sits comfortably right in the middle of the Black Sabbath discography. It's an enjoyable experience with a lot of new tricks the band is pulling. The album is also different enough from the rest of their catalog to be an enjoyable change of pace. However, disjointed and underdeveloped songwriting makes so many songs on the record just miss the mark. They wind up average listens when they were so close to being very special. It's a shame that this album was a one-off for this lineup, because I definitely think they could have risen to the top if they were given another album or two to develop their songwriting style together more. \"Born Again\" is definitely an album that should not be passed over when listening to Black Sabbath, but at the same time, it's just a bit of a shame due to the album's wasted potential.\n",
        "\nFinally, Black Sabbath could show all of the true talent and potential they had inside. Adding Ronnie James Dio on vocals behind Iommi and Geezer is just the magical spark the later two needed. Finally, you had one of the greatest singers of all time paired with one of the best guitarists of all time, and one of the best bassists of all time. Almost every member of the band sounds re-energized. Adding Dio broke the chains of limitation Iommi had around him from being shackled with Ozzy, and it immediately shows. \"Heaven and Hell\" demonstrates sides of Black Sabbath that you wouldn't even know they had if you just listened to the Ozzy era.\n\nTake \"Children of the Sea\" as an example. Starting a song with a terrific acoustic intro, and having a singer with an absolutely beautiful voice carry his soaring notes over it without having to worry about their voice shattering the peace? What a concept! The track follows with a heavy Iommi riff that shows Tony's stuff while also still letting Dio show his power too. Geezer is also throwing in some really creative little bass hooks behind it all too. \"Children of the Sea\" is a very good example of Dio's versatility. He's able to switch between such purely beautiful vocals to some more passionately aggressive ones during the heavier parts. He also adds some fantastic little chanting vocals for weight and effect behind Iommi's solo. Finally, the song has one of my favorite endings in all of music. Dio's warning of \"LOOK OUT\" right before the door slams shut is just SO powerful. Of course, it's hard to mention power when talking about this album without referring to the title track. The main riff proves that Iommi is a riff master, and that he wasn't out of gas, considering his riffs had been pretty sub-par most of the time on the last few Ozzy era albums. The song gives a perfect blend of his heavy riffing which give Tony attention, and then swapping to give Dio's vocals the spotlight before they both combine. All the while, Geezer is giving us one of his most quintessential and iconic basslines (although there's much debate on who actually wrote it). His bassline holds the whole song together, and is the reason the song remains interesting each time Iommi and/or Dio need some air. He drives in the quicker ending portion of the song, too, where Dio gets to do some ad libbing over another Iommi solo. To put the track to bed, Iommi plays an acoustic outro beautiful enough to bring a tear to my eye.\n\nGeezer is definitely also the leading man when it comes to \"Lady Evil,\" too. He punches the song forward with a tremendous bass part, and even when Iommi comes in with some great riffing, he's really the one to listen for on the track. Iommi gets to play with some really cool effects on his guitar during the solo, too, which might not have fit quite as well on a song that didn't have such a mysterious aura to it. Dio is having an absolute blast singing this track. His voice just delivers the perfect kind of warning and mystical aura the song needed. It's like he's singing you a fairy tale, and if there's anyone who could convince you that witches were real with their vocal style alone, it's Dio. \"Wishing Well\" is another brilliantly fun track that I think is MASSIVELY underrated. Even among the Dio era alone, it's a passed over track, let alone Sabbath's whole discography. It's definitely a track that is quite a bit more uplifting for Sabbath's standards, but it doesn't sacrifice their sound or integrity to do so. It has this great high energy bouncing flow to it that once again, I truly feel Geezer helps pave out. Iommi's riff isn't the best he has ever made, but Geezer's great bass helps draw the attention his way instead. During the middle section of the song, while Iommi adds some lead guitar flourishes behind Dio before the solo, he also uses some very subtle acoustic guitar that gives the song a lot of texture.\n\n\"Die Young\" is definitely my favorite song from \"Heaven and Hell,\" though. New keyboardist Geoff Nicholls gives a brilliant atmospheric intro. The use of keys all throughout this era are used as accents and compliments, which is much more appropriate of Black Sabbath rather than when they were a focal point when used during the Ozzy era. They're adding depth and emotion all across this song. The track is explosively heavy too, both coming from Iommi's fantastic riff, and Dio's masterful singing. Despite the heavy energy, the song has plenty of versatility. The softer chorus section is a showcase for Dio, and lets Iommi give us moments of calm. The following start and stop section between heavy crashes and Iommi's small solos are another great, unique moment from the song. Dio also gives us a lesson on mood setting during \"Lonely is the Word.\" The song has a doom-y mood despite Iommi's riff not being the heaviest of his career. It's a solid riff, but it's Dio's voice that brings that downtrodden atmosphere home. He has both the power and the emotion in his voice to personify the loneliness this song alludes to. I also love both of Iommi's long solos on this track. Each solo is able to match Dio's emotion perfectly, and once again, Geoff Nicholls soft keys that begin during the final solo compliment Iommi's playing, and give a 'far away from home' feeling.\n\nHonestly, my biggest complaint about this album is the order of the tracks on the second half. Both \"Wishing Well\" and \"Walk Away\" are more upbeat tracks, and both \"Die Young\" and \"Lonely is the Word\" are heavier, and 'darker' tracks. To go from \"Wishing Well\" to \"Die Young\" to \"Walk Away\" to close on \"Lonely is the Word\" is jostling the listener's emotions back and forth. Just when I'm getting in one mood, the album suddenly jolts me to another, and then back and forth again. Switching \"Walk Away\" and \"Die Young\" would have easily made the album have a more cohesive flow. \"Walk Away\" in general is definitely the worst song on the album, too. It's far from a bad song, but it's pretty sappy. Geezer has a great bass part, and Dio's melodies are as strong and promising as always, but it's a pretty barebones and sappy song behind that. The chorus, I assume, is supposed to be a catchy one, but it just makes me shake my head. It's a song that doesn't detract from the album when I listen to it as a whole, but I never turn \"Walk Away\" on by itself. Solid track, but nothing special whatsoever.\n\nYou may have noticed that I didn't mention Bill Ward once. That is because he barely does anything noteworthy at all on \"Heaven and Hell.\" It's pretty common knowledge that his alcoholism was at its peak during the recording of this album, and while he definitely isn't embarrassing himself here, he's pretty much just going through the motions. With his departure after this album, Sabbath would welcome underrated drummer Vinny Appice to complete my favorite lineup in their history. \"Heaven and Hell\" was and still is a phenomenal Sabbath album that showed how much creativity the band still had. It showed what Iommi could do when we wasn't limited by his singer. At the same time, though, \"Heaven and Hell\" is actually my least favorite of the Dio era. While still brilliant, the best was still yet to come.\n",
        "\n\"Mob Rules\" is not only far and away the greatest Black Sabbath album of all time, but one of the greatest metal albums period. It's one of my top 5 albums, and is another of my quintessential desert island discs. Whenever I meet a fellow Sabbath fan, especially one who is at all familiar with the Dio era, my immediate goal is to present a reasonable argument to get them to realize that \"Mob Rules\" is better than \"Heaven and Hell.\" Now, I love \"Heaven and Hell,\" but literally everything it does, \"Mob Rules\" does better. It's often said that both albums have a similar structure, which they undeniably do, but \"Mob Rules\" is just \"Heaven and Hell\" if it had FIRE. \"Heaven and Hell\" is such a safe record. That's understandable, because a famous band was getting a new singer to replace a beloved one. It's fantastic, but it very rarely is showing any teeth. \"Mob Rules\" knows that the previous album played it safe, and says \"Alright, this is what we're REALLY about.\" If you're reading this review, turn \"Mob Rules\" on right now, and clear your head. Don't think of this album as \"Heaven and Hell's\" little brother when you listen. Let \"Mob Rules\" stand on its own, and I can promise you you'll realize how criminally underrated and overshadowed it is.\n\n\"Falling Off the Edge of the World\" is worth the price of admission by itself. I don't know what more you can ask for of a metal song. It starts with a sad, but beautiful clean intro that builds that deep emotion inside with Dio's sorrowful voice, and the equally mournful orchestration behind it. From there, the song just builds and builds and builds. First with Vinny Appice's introduction, then with the first of Iommi's heavy riffs. Every second of this song is layering on itself. Finally, when Iommi introduces his main riff, it's one of his greatest ever. Dio's formerly sad voice is now filled with pure aggression. The main melody of the song, both riff and vocal wise have so much fire spewing from them. Vinny Appice's fills are precise and complimentary to the band. They're both powerful and tasty. Vinny Appice is as much of an underrated drummer as \"Mob Rules\" is an underrated album. He's got a stupendous feel to his playing, and he has technical chops to not be passed over as well. I think his playing is a LOT more fitting of a band like Black Sabbath. \"The Sign of the Southern Cross\" is a song that rivals \"Falling Off the Edge of the World\" when it comes to building a song from the ground up. Iommi starts the track with a FANTASTIC acoustic guitar part that gives the entire album a lot of variety and weight. Dio's voice just sails and soars over the top of it with grace and beauty. Then the song explodes with a slower, stomping, incredible Iommi riff. He really has the best of his best riffs all across this album. Behind Dio's main vocals, Geezer gets to add some really cool effects to his bass which give the song a 'cold' kind of feeling to it. During the main riff, he adds a lot of sweet little bass flourishes as well that are easy to go unnoticed, but add a ton to the song. Vinny is on fire with his fills during Iommi's fantastic solo as well.\n\nOf course, this fades to the short, dark, atmospheric intro \"E5150\" before launching the title track. \"The Mob Rules\" is just so incredibly aggressive. The flame's return to Dio's voice again, and this is another song that shows how insanely versatile the man was. So much of \"Heaven and Hell\" showed off his beautiful soaring range, but \"The Mob Rules\" is just pure anger, power, and energy from Dio. His scream to open the song up, and then his screaming chorus call are absolute staples. Iommi's riffs match the energy, quickness, and aggression the entire way through. This might be THE Black Sabbath song when it comes to just raw strength and pure heavy metal energy. \"Voodoo\" is another one of my favorites. I always juggle between \"Voodoo\" and \"Falling Off the Edge of the World\" when it comes to a favorite song from this album. \"Voodoo\" has one of my favorite Iommi riffs of all time. I find the riff to be incredibly catchy while also having a great flow and rhythm to it. Appice's pounding behind it adds to make a great groove, and Geezer is playing a great bass hook that is a a bit more isolated from the rest of the band. Dio is just dark across the whole track. This is another song that sets the bar for telling a fantastic story with a tone of voice alone. His voice on the verses are just absolutely uncaring. And I don't mean that he is uncaring about his singing, I mean that he gives a perfect mood of the story-teller of the song being absolutely ruthless and uncaring during the course of the story. Despite this, the chorus is one of his most melodic, and is truly addicting. Iommi's solo is one of his best on the album to cap it off. \"Voodoo\" might not be the most complicated song out there, but it's a phenomenal Black Sabbath and metal song in every way.\n\nThe most underrated song on this underrated album quite possibly is \"Country Girl,\" though. Iommi unleashes another absolutely stunning riff, and Vinny's added china cymbal beats behind that main riff give it a very unique feel. It's little moments like this where Vinny shows off what a brilliant drummer he truly is. Meanwhile, that riff gives a foreboding feeling to it that Dio matches upon his entry. This time around, Dio's vocals actually follow Iommi's melody, giving the verses a perfect blend and mixture of the two. He gives another peak at his versatility on this track by showing that same angry fury on the verses, but also his incredibly melodic side on the transition portion right in the middle of the song before the solo. This whole track is another journey and one of my top 10 Sabbath songs, despite the title, \"Country Girl,\" being a bit misleading of what is to be expected from it. Definitely do not judge this book by its cover. Opener \"Turn Up the Night\" is also a fantastic way to kick the album off. It's both fun and incredibly energetic. Iommi's riff is simple, but not simple enough to be boring like \"Neon Knight's\" main riff on \"Heaven and Hell\" is to me. His riff here is punchier, and the difference between \"Turn Up the Night\" and \"Neon Knights\" can also easily summarize the difference in the two albums as well. The chorus is a really catchy one, and Iommi's lead playing over it, as well as his solo are super cool and a ton of fun. Dio's multi-tracked chorus along with those lead flourishes really give the chorus to the song a very big feeling to it.\n\nEven the song that I think is weakest on the whole record is still fantastic. \"Slipping Away\" definitely fits the bill for the weakest, but it's still a very, very good track. It just unfortunately is matched by absolutely lights out tracks across the rest of it. Dio's melodic chorus is great, and the section after the chorus where every member of the band has small 'solos' is a real treat. First, Vinny gets a section where he's throwing some of his best fills where Geezer and Tony give him breathing room, and after that, we get another measure of Iommi and Geezer dueling small solos back and forth which each other. It's really a treat to listen to. Especially so for Geezer's solos, which are just awesome. It makes it painfully obvious that Geezer should have been given a couple of more bass solos during Black Sabbath's tenure. I just think that Iommi's main riff is a fairly weak one. Doubly so considering his riff writing is absolutely next level on almost every other song on this album.\n\nEveryone is at the absolute peak of their game on \"Mob Rules.\" There's no wasted potential from a single song or member of the band's individual playing on it. It has all the fire and passion physically possible from a Sabbath record. The album marked the last time this lineup would be together for more than ten years, however, which is both unfortunate, but also a blessing. Due to the split, Dio would take Vinny and create a pretty great solo career for himself (that's a story for me to tell on another day, however.). I always prefer to make believe that it was because they all knew this one couldn't be topped, rather than the truth that such strong personalities couldn't coexist at the time. Iommi and Geezer would continue on together for a little longer, and even though the best had ended, that doesn't mean it was entirely the end of good material for Sabbath. There was still a lot of good to come from various other lineups.\n",
        "\nHeavy metal icons Black Sabbath had become quite volatile in the late seventies and early eighties with four different line-ups for four consecutive albums. New singer Ian Gillan of Deep Purple fame had yet again a significant impact on the band sound. He had adapted some expressive trademark screams by Ronnie James Dio but also the low, gloomy and atmospheric register of Ozzy Osbourne. He represented the strengths of those two entirely different singers and had the potential to appeal both to fans of old date and those who had preferred the band's more recent outputs. Spoiler alert ahead, Ian Gillan would only record one record with Black Sabbath and be replaced by another former Deep Purple singer with Glenn Hughes.\n\nStylistically, this record mixes the dramatic heavy metal spirit of predecessors Mob Rules as well as Heaven and Hell with the band's early drug-infused gloomy doom metal outputs Master of Reality and Volume 4. The opening tunes are particularly tough to digest. The instrumental tunes ''Stonehenge'' and ''The Dark'' are boring fillers that have no reason to even exist in the first place. ''Trashed'' ends on an unimaginative fade-out while ''Disturbing the Priest'' is a nervously fidgeting contrast that feels completely out of place.\n\nThankfully, the other tunes are so great that this album still deserves attention and recognition. ''Zero the Hero'' is an epic doom metal milestone that represents everything Black Sabbath has stood for in its long career. Tracks like ''Keep it Warm'' are shorter, faster and catchier and contrast the moodier tunes perfectly as they offer excellent commercial potential. \n\nBand leader Tony Iommi shines with his gloomy trademark guitar riffs and a few colourful flute sounds. Bassist Geezer Butler works with precision and skills but his contributions should rather be called serviceable than outstanding and it would have been great if his skilled play had taken even more space. Drummer Bill Ward came back to the band after sitting out on Mob Rules and performs as if he had never been away in the first place. New singer Ian Gillan manages to blend in very well and proves that Black Sabbath always had a talent choosing great singers.\n\nThe deluxe edition includes energetic bonus track ''The Fallen'' and some rare live cuts with Ian Gillan that sound really great. In retrospective, both Ozzy Osbourne's and Ronnie James Dio's departures were saddening but the fact that a talented singer like Ian Gillan only stayed for one album is also truly regrettable. The numerous line-up changes would ultimately lead to a lack of commercial success that only reappeared with the two later reunions with both Ronnie James Dio and Ozzy Osburne.\n\nIn the context of Black Sabbath's discography, Born Again is neither among the band's worst cuts nor among its greatest moments. Faithful collectors and fans should pick this album up nevertheless and especially the remastered deluxe edition offers value for money. Despite a horrible cover artwork depicting something that could come from a bad kaiju movie of the early sixties, Born Again is better than the difficult circumstances might have indicated.\n",
        "\nSabbath's ironically titled \"Never Say Die\" ended up being the last for the Ozzy era's initial run. Sabbath had been on life support for several years at this point, and this album was the end of it. Where \"Technical Ecstasy\" was an album that was plagued by hot and cold extremes of decent material and utter trash, even \"Never Say Die's\" best moments are mediocre. There are little tiny moments of brilliance across this album that help it end up better than \"Sabotage\" was, but there was just not enough decent songwriting to connect the dots and flesh this record out. In fact, maybe the best part of this entire album ends up being Don Airey, who ends up adding his masterful keyboard work throughout.\n\nFor instance, the biggest song on this album that I WISH I could like, and comes so close to being a solid Sabbath track is \"Air Dance.\" It's easily the best track on the record, though. Iommi starts the track out with an AMAZING riff that's so catchy and heavy. There are tons of times I just loop the first 30 seconds of this song to get my fill of this riff, because it's never to return after the intro. What follows is a solid almost jazzy piece that's calm and soothing in a way. Don Airey's majestic piano work is what makes the track, and that piano gives the song's title meaning. The piano parts just give an instant feeling of a waltz through the air. The quicker ending portion of the song feels like lounge music in a fancy club, which is a different and refreshing take for Sabbath. Iommi's solo is really cool here. Unfortunately, though, this song just lacks something of a punch to make it a fully quality listen. I can't really put my finger on exactly what's missing, but there's just not enough for me to hang my hat on. Maybe bringing back that brilliant intro riff and giving another small heavier section could have done it. The following track \"Over to You\" is another track that Don Airey really makes. Now, \"Over to You\" is a VERY bad song, but his fluttering, dancing piano work that shoots in occasionally is the only good thing about it. Beyond that piano work, you've got a pretty terrible, uninspired Iommi riff, and a song that absolutely goes nowhere. None of the original Sabbath members are doing much of anything on this track besides the bare minimum to bring the album's run time up. It's not an offensive track, but it's absolutely one of the most boring the band would ever offer. I beg for it to end every time I listen to it.\n\nOther than \"Air Dance,\" \"A Hard Road\" is the only other track on the album that I get even the smallest bit of joy from listening to. It's still far from a great Sabbath song, and still, no one is really doing anything special on it, but it gets points from me for its sheer and utter catchiness. This is a song where, the moment I start to listen to Ozzy era Sabbath, or see the cover of this album, that chorus pops into my head, and gets stuck there for a while. The only other noteworthy thing about this song is that it's the only time all four Sabbath members sing. Damn is that chorus catchy, though. Speaking of the other Sabbath member's singing, Bill Ward takes lead vocals on \"Swinging the Chain.\" This is another pretty okay track from the album. Iommi's riff, while too grainy and distorted for my taste, is very, very heavy and powerful. Bill Ward's voice is very good on this song, and it almost makes me think he should have been the lead singer all along. The chorus is much weaker than the verses, though. While, again, this track is far from outstanding, it gets a pass from me. I do want to note that I find it very fitting that the harmonica returns on this track, which I don't believe had been utilized by Sabbath since \"The Wizard\" on the debut. Even though Ozzy isn't playing it this time around, it definitely makes it feel like Sabbath knew this was the end of this lineup. This track's intro instrumental \"Breakout\" is also pretty fun with its horn section boosting the band.\n\nThe title track and \"Shock Wave\" are where this album suffers the most, though. The title track is so awful. My one note is that Geezer drops a really cool bassline on this track. One of his only standout moments on the album besides \"Junior's Eyes.\" Iommi is, again, barely doing much of anything on this song, and for my money, this is one of the least 'Black Sabbath-y' tracks by Black Sabbath. This song sounds like it could have come from any pop rock band that was around at the time. Not Black Sabbath. Ozzy's voice is AWFUL on this song. He tries to exhibit a high range on the verses, but you can physically hear him straining and struggling to hit the notes, and stay in tune. The chorus is also pathetic, so there's really not one element that salvages this song. \"Shock Wave\" is just incredibly boring and predictable, much like \"Over to You\" was. Iommi has an okay riff to start it off, and a nice solo later, but the song has pretty much no progression at all. It really just flounders around without any kind of progress until it ends. This is another track that I struggle not to zone out during when I listen to this album.\n\n\"Never Say Die\" ends up being an incredibly dull and tired release that has very little to add to Black Sabbath's catalog. Honestly, though, I think we can all agree that both Sabbath and Ozzy needed a break at this point. If this split hadn't happened, I doubt they'd have done anything other than put out release after mediocre release. At least with the split, Ozzy could go on to do a solo career where his wife would use her marketing genius to swindle people into thinking he has any kind of real talent at all. More importantly, though, the musical geniuses Tony Iommi and Geezer Butler could finally get a singer on par with their own talent: Ronnie James Dio.\n",
        "\nMany people consider Black Sabbath's \"Technical Ecstasy\" to be the beginning of the end. Personally, for me, it was over for the Ozzy era before this album was released. However, this album is a good bit better than \"Sabotage\" was, so there's some solace in that fact. To be perfectly honest, if you only cherry pick from this album, it could be one of the better Ozzy era Sabbath releases. But as a total package, there's much to be desired. This record is an incredibly mixed bag. There's a decent amount of interesting things happening on it, but there's also a ton that's just awful about it. There aren't many albums that are such a cluster of enjoyable material and garbage like \"Technical Ecstasy.\"\n\n\"Dirty Women\" seems to have been the track that has stuck around the most from this record, and there's good reason for that. It's certainly a better track on the album, and honestly one of the better Ozzy era Sabbath songs. Ozzy actually does a pretty good job at selling this song, especially on the chorus, but Iommi is the real hero. This is another song that shows what an absolute riff genius he is. Riff after riff on this track is fantastic. The opening riff has a heavy, yet 'sly' feeling to it. The transition riff after the verses is probably my favorite on the entire song, and its backed by some keys that add more weight to it. The riff that immediately follows that one is fantastic as well. Bill Ward throws in some cool double bass work towards the end to drive and keep the song building. My only complaint is that I think the outro is a bit too long. If about a minute was cut off it, I think it'd have been just fine. Great Sabbath track across the board here. Another pretty interesting track is \"All Moving Parts.\" This song is another actually good combo of Ozzy and Iommi. Once again, I think Ozzy's vocals are pretty decent on this track. Maybe a little bit to bored sounding, but pretty solid for his standards. Iommi's riff is simple, but with a perfect flow to it, which Ward's equally simple drumming helps pound out. Geezer is also bouncing his bassline along very nicely on this track. It's some of his best work on this album. The quicker section a bit later is a great breath of fresh air to add some much needed variety to the song. Iommi leads on with another fantastic riff during it.\n\nThe only track on the record that can rival \"Dirty Women\" for me happens to be \"Gypsy.\" Bill Ward opens up with a very tasty and unique drum groove, and after this intro, Iommi busts in with another very heavy riff which Geezer mirrors. The pre chorus is a fantastic one. Iommi uses another simple, but heavy and catchy riff with a piano behind him, giving him the weight he needs. This is a song that I really feel like has a lot of good ideas behind it. It paces itself very nicely to cut out an enjoyable track for this record. The opener \"Back Street Kids\" is another pretty solid one. It's a quick paced song for Sabbath's usual standards, and Iommi's chorus riff that he uses as an intro is heavy in an almost theatrical way. Ozzy's monotonous voice is actually a dead ringer for this kind of chorus, and it gives the almost robotic sound a great feel. The keys later on the song are also fantastic, and it helps the song almost become uplifting.\n\nBut where those four tracks are pretty enjoyable, the rest are terrible. This album has two ballads. Sabbath does not have a good track record when it comes to ballads, and these two are no exception. \"She's Gone\" is the better of the two, as Iommi's acoustic guitar melody and the orchestration that go behind the track are sad and downtrodden. However, while Ozzy's voice isn't the WORST on this song, his singing comes off as cheesy to me. Like a man who is faking a sad emotion instead of actually experiencing it. It turns the song from sad to downright pitiable, and it's a disjointed connection that just doesn't work. \"It's Alright\" is pure and utter garbage. Bill Ward's voice actually might even be better than Ozzy's, but this track is pathetic. It's not a beautiful song, it's not a happy song, it's not a sad song...it's just nothing. It's a song that doesn't know what it's trying to go for, and isn't the slightest bit interesting on top of it either. The entire four minute run time, it feels like all four members of the band are staring at each other, giving each other sideways glances as if to say \"..what are we doing with this song again..?\" It sounds utterly thrown together and accomplishes nothing.\n\nThe ballads aren't the only source of poor material on \"Technical Ecstasy,\" though. \"You Won't Change Me\" is another very bad Sabbath track. The intro is a heavy, brooding one, and this might get you to think this is going to be the Sabbath song on the album that goes back to their classic roots, but it quickly devolves. The keys that come in are an odd transition, but what comes after that is just a boring jam. Iommi's guitar parts are terrible the whole way through, Ozzy's vocals are dull and uninspired, and neither Ward or Geezer are doing anything of their own to try and save it. The song pretty much keeps going in this direction without any transitions or progress at all. It's the second longest track on the record, and didn't even have enough interesting material to be the shortest. The one and only good thing I can say about this song is that Iommi's solo at the end is very cool.\n\n\"Technical Ecstasy\" is almost an even 50/50 split of material that is worth existing, and material that is utter filler to justify the record's existence. When this record is on its game, it's actually one of the better Ozzy era Sabbath experiences. But the other half of the time when it whiffs, it's one of the worst. Honestly, a lot of times when I'm listening to Ozzy era Sabbath, I take the good songs from this record, and the couple of solid tracks from \"Never Say Die\" and combine them to pretend that the Ozzy era had one decent last gasp before fading away. While this is not a great album by any stretch of the imagination, I also don't think it's worthy of being written off nearly as much as many Sabbath fans do. This is the definition of a pick and choose album.\n",
        "\nI guess it's time for another unpopular opinion of mine. \"Sabotage\" is the worst Black Sabbath album of all time. That's right. Worse than \"Forbidden,\" \"13,\" \"Technical Ecstasy,\" \"Never Say Die,\" and even \"Seventh Star.\" I have listened to this album so many times, and find very little redeemable about it. After coming off the stupendous release of \"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath,\" where Sabbath seemed to have learned and grew so much, one would think that this trend would continue. You'd be wrong. Not only did Sabbath take so many steps back on this record, but they ran in reverse so quickly, they pretty much fell off a cliff.\n\n\"Am I Going Insane\" is the only track on the record that even sounds like it's even remotely related to \"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath.\" But unfortunately, the song sounds like it was a rejected outtake from that album. The keyboards give the song a unique feel for the album, and Geezer has a pretty solid bassline behind it, but that's where the compliments end. The song is so repetitive, it certainly makes me feel like I'm going insane. Not only is it repetitive, but Ozzy just drones on and on and on all over it. The chorus in particular is one of the most pathetically emotionless and dull choruses he could ever sing on. This song is barely 4 minutes, and it feels like it's 10. \"The Writ\" also has some small atmospheric keyboard sections, but they're few and far between, and the rest of the song is absolutely abysmal. Ozzy's shrill screaming across this track is borderline physically painful to my ears. The rest of the song is just so insanely boring. The rest of the band sounds like they fell asleep. Iommi is barely holding chords on this track, let alone writing a riff. Bill Ward has the most basic drum beat that has ever been conceived. Although the acoustic harpsichord section gives it a little bit of variety, the song is still an absolute snooze. It's 9 minutes of utter dull Sabbath nonsense.\n\nThe worst of the entire album might very well be \"Megalomania,\" though. This track feels like Sabbath is trying to parody themselves. It sounds like they wanted to make a doom-y epic like their glory days, but it just turns into another boring snooze of a track. Another decent bassline from Geezer, but that's it. Iommi and Ward again do pretty much nothing on the whole track besides hold the most basic of basic riffing and beats. A bit before the halfway mark, the song 'picks up,' to put that very generously. Iommi gives a half cocked riff that makes him seem like a shell of his former self, and again, Ward is barely trying. The song is nearly 10 minutes, too. Absolutely unacceptable. If this song was a mere 2 minute interlude for another track, it'd be far too long. \"Megalomania\" is one of the absolute worst songs the Ozzy era of Black Sabbath would ever offer. No excuse here. \"Symptom of the Universe\" tries very hard to have a bit more life, and absolutely does have a bit more of that classic Black Sabbath feeling. Iommi gives a riff that shows he's alive on this album, and Ward's fills are actually very tasty and well done across it. His main beats are pretty bad, though. Much like he also does for \"Hole in the Sky,\" he just slams away at his crash without any taste or feel behind it. Similar to how I felt for \"Into the Void,\" Ozzy tramples all over any possible enjoyment I could have in the track. His nasally crooning just cuts the song down before it can even stand. His voice is awful on this song. Iommi gives a fantastic solo, and the interesting acoustic ending prevents \"Symptom of the Universe\" from being a downright miserable experience. This is a song on the album that I can sit through without wanting to break something, but I don't enjoy it either.\n\nIn truth, \"Supertzar\" is the only song on this entire record that I think is worth much. It's a brilliant instrumental track with an intense marching feeling. But despite the intensity, the choir gives so much beauty to it too. Iommi gives some solid riffing, but his riffs as well as Ward's marching drumming are a guiding point for the choir, which is the highlight of the song. There are moments where the choir duel with Iommi's riffs, and the whole song just keeps building and building so well. This is easily both the best song on this record, and also one of the most unique Sabbath songs from the entire Ozzy era. It's the only song on \"Sabotage\" I listen to with any kind of regularity whatsoever. \"The Thrill of It All\" is also not bad. This is definitely the only song featuring the whole band on this album that I don't think is terrible. After a pretty standard intro to the song, Iommi belts out a fantastic start and stop riff. The flow of the riff gives the song a powerful and really head-bang worthy feeling. Unfortunately, this really solid section doesn't last long. By the half way point in the song, it devolves into a mess. Just random, boring playing from all three members of Sabbath follow the second half of the song, and the track ends up plodding away aimlessly until it's finally over. \"The Thrill of It All\" is by far the biggest waste of potential on the album.\n\n\"Sabotage\" isn't quite bad enough to belong in a trash bin, but it is the closest Sabbath ever comes to it. It dangerously teeters on the edge of falling in. There is just a nauseating amount of utterly dull, boring, useless material across this entire record. I know I've used the word 'boring' so many times during this review, but that's the only way I can describe so much of it. Even when a few tracks have a good moment or so, they don't last long before a transition extinguishes the fire. This album wasn't the death of Ozzy era Sabbath, but it certainly was the point where it received a mortal wound too serious to patch. The next two records wouldn't be QUITE as bad, but where this album took the bullet, the next two are the band's trips to the emergency room, and then finally the nurse finally putting them to sleep to end it.\n",
        "\nBlack Sabbath's fifth album \"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\" is without question the greatest album from the Ozzy era. There's not a single other album from this era that even really comes close. Musically, this is the best, and most diverse the group would ever get. All of the mistakes that led to the mediocrity of the previous album have been corrected and then some on this release. On \"Volume 4,\" where the songwriting was paint by numbers Sabbath, and there was really very little diversity to the tracks, \"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\" has a huge variation, and great writing. The production is also back to being perfectly crisp and clear. This album took SO many chances that went against what was expected of Black Sabbath, and they paid off.\n\nFirst off, I need to say. I love \"Who Are You?\" Even among fans of this album I see and hear SO much hate for this track, and I don't get it. It's one of my top 3 from the Ozzy era. Maybe its because of my adoration of power metal, but the synth work is such a treat for me. It's such a unique Sabbath song on so many levels. I've heard Ozzy had a big part in writing this tune, and while I often don't agree with him, if this is the truth, my hat is off to him for this song. Along with the cool synth parts, Geezer is matching the rhythm and giving it so weight with his bass. The solo section is the song's best moment. The synth parts which are layered by Iommi's guitar part along with the beautiful swelling piano parts are a real achievement. Ward's marching drum work that brings this section home adds a nice little layer of depth on top of that. While \"Who Are You?\" is in my top 3, my number one Ozzy era Sabbath song is \"A National Acrobat.\" The opening riff is easily one of Iommi's best of all time, and when he layers it after one go around, it becomes so catchy and heavy. \"A National Acrobat\" just has such a punchy flowing groove bouncing along that makes it incredibly addicting. The quicker part after the solo is a great change of pace. Iommi plows forward with another absolutely catchy, fantastic riff, and this transition just keeps building until an abrupt end.\n\nTo give more credit where it's due, \"Sabbra Cadabra\" might very well be Ozzy's best vocal work of his entire life. He's actually a treat on this song. This song is just chock full of fun moments. Every single member of Sabbath just sound like they're having a blast playing this song. Geezer keeps the bouncing fun nature of the track, and Iommi's riffs are equally jovial and still fantastic. Once again, the atmospheric keys and the strong piano melodies during the middle section of the song add so much depth to the track. The piano stays around, too, and even has a little bit of a solo while Ozzy adlibs over it later. Ozzy also shows a little something special on the album's closer \"Spiral Architect\" as well. After a pretty acoustic intro from Iommi, the song kicks in with a groove that's uplifting while also not betraying their style. The verse melodies are decent, and when the orchestration comes in and Ozzy's voice double tracks, the real meat of the whole song comes to fruition. This orchestration soars and becomes the real forefront of the entire later portion of this track. It ends the album beautifully, as if Black Sabbath are taking a bow as they close the curtain on the album. \"Fluff\" also picks up as a spiritual successor to \"Laguna Sunrise,\" and while not quite as good, it's still a beautiful little aside to the album.\n\nThe two weakest tracks on this album are probably the two most popular from it, however. Those would be the title track and \"Killing Yourself to Live.\" Now, before you bite my head off for saying that, I am NOT saying that either of these tracks are bad tracks. Both of them could easily stand tall with a lot of the Ozzy era. I just think they're a bit weaker than the rest of the album. The title track of the album is an Iommi riff that I often see credited as one of his best but I can't agree with that. It's not a bad riff by any means, and most other guitarists could never come up with one half as interesting, but for Iommi's standards, I think it's a pretty standard riff. It's really Bill Ward's beat on this song that I can't stand. While Ward is pretty competent on this entire album, his main beat on this track is just so weak. He totally misses a chance to really pound out a heavy beat to fuel the album. Instead, he gives this weak little thump that goes nowhere. \"Killing Yourself to Live\" has a strong chorus, both riff and vocal wise, but a lot of the rest of the track just kind of floats along for me. The middle and ending parts are just kind of boring, and go on for way to long. This is a track on the album that could have had its fat trimmed off.\n\n\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\" stands tall as the greatest Ozzy era Black Sabbath record. While it still has its limitations in engaging me, I cannot honestly say there's a bad track on this album. It's an enjoyable one through and through. This record showed an incredible amount of musical growth, advancement, and maturity, which, unfortunately (or fortunately for me, since I'm not huge on this era) they decided to throw away on their next album. It also serves as the last gasp the era had to breathe. We only take a deep dive down from this point forward until Dio came along to save the band.\n",
        "\nFor their first three releases, Black Sabbath released albums that I always considered to be good enough to get enjoyment out of, and for the many individuals that like the Ozzy era more than I do, it's definitely clear why they would. This album is the first of the album's that I find to be pretty inexcusable. It's certainly not abysmal...but it's far from good. This one is a clear and massive step down from all three that came before it. Everyone is in a haze on this album. First, the production is terrible. I'm not sure how you downgrade your production despite two years passing, but they managed it. Not only that, but the songs seem to have different production values on a track by track basis. Certain tracks bury instruments in the mix, but on other tracks, the same instrument that was buried is suddenly vastly in the forefront.\n\n\"Cornucopia\" and \"Tomorrow's Dream\" are two examples of this. On \"Cornucopia,\" Ward's snare sounds hollow and muffled. Sometimes it barely feels present. Iommi is also masked quite a bit by Geezer and Ozzy. Ozzy's vocals in particular are much cleaner and clearer than the other three. Now, putting on \"Tomorrow's Dream,\" suddenly Iommi is right there in your ear, Ward's snare is nice and snappy, but now Ozzy sounds like he's distant. Things like this happen all over the album. As songs, both of these songs are pretty standard, yet not noteworthy Sabbath tracks. \"Cornucopia\" has an incredible and doomy intro riff, but the verse riffs are pretty weak. Ozzy's verse melodies are actually pretty decent and versatile here. The halfway point in the song gives way to an insanely weak segment on all accounts. Ozzy's shouting isn't really fitting, and Iommi's riff here is very dull. \"Tomorrow's Dream\" is a track that isn't offensive by any means, but goes absolutely nowhere. Not one member of the band does anything interesting, and after its short three minute run time, I just shrug and move on. This is a track that I imagine is for the Ozzy era buffs only.\n\n\"St. Vitus Dance\" is an absolutely awful track. Iommi's intro riff sounds like it belongs in a country song, and while the following riff is a little stronger of a riff that's worthy of Iommi, the song just loops back and forth between them. This song is like \"After Forever's\" child, and all of my complaints about that track remain, and only get worse here. It's a disjointed mess of a track, and even a short run time can't make it passable. Then we have \"Changes.\" Apparently, Ozzy felt he was Elton John when this track was made. His voice isn't good enough to fit most heavier songs, let alone an attempt at a ballad where he's the star. I know it might seem to be easy or cheap to pick on the ballad, but as a power metal fan that enjoys a good deal of cheesy ballads, I can say with the utmost certainty that this song was just a mistake. Iommi's piano work is solid enough, but Ozzy's lack of any kind of range or depth to his singing voice make an attempt at an emotional song feel like a joke.\n\nAll is not lost on the album, though! \"Snowblind\" is probably in my top three to five songs from the entire Ozzy era. The track is almost good enough to make the rest of the forgettable album worth it. Everyone is coming together to make Sabbath magic for this track. Iommi's riff is just fantastic, and gives a perfect groove. To back it up, Bill Ward, who I usually don't love, gives his verse beats some very tasty snare ghost notes that really improve the rhythm and feel of the song in a subtle way. Ozzy's vocal style is also very fitting for this track. He actually shows that he very sparingly can have a pretty decent range with the right tune behind him. The quicker tempo part towards the middle-end of the song showcases another of Tony Iommi's mastercraft riffs, and the quick transition gives the song a lot of variety and depth. When the song returns, the small keyboard work keeps that variety pulsing forward. \"Snowblind\" is just a truly well done, well written track on all fronts.\n\nThe only other track 'hard' track that I enjoy from this album is \"Wheels of Confusion.\" The intro is just a bit of a jam, and while the verse riff and melody isn't super special, the transition riffs are a lot of fun. The later uptempo part of the song is the most fun for me. Geezer has a great bouncing bass groove keeping the flow up for Iommi to solo over. The track also ends on a fun solo that adds a bit more keys and also a bit of an acoustic guitar to back it. Although both during this ending and on the entirety of \"Supernaut,\" Ward is going way too crazy on his crashes. The constant crashing really ruins any groove or flow from both. \"Laguna Sunrise\" is another of Iommi's beautifully made tracks. Musically, he crafted a song perfectly fitting the name he gave to it. His lovely acoustic parts along with the equally wonderful orchestration behind it give a perfect image of waking up on a warm morning to a bright sunrise. This song has the beauty that \"Changes\" WISHES it had. No vocals required.\n\nSabbath's fourth release just doesn't have what it takes to cut it. While it remains decent enough to stay afloat, treading water is about the best it can possibly hope to do. This album is not a downright dreadful one, but there's a lot of mediocrity to it, and there's barely anything about this album that Sabbath hadn't already done better on their previous three. I'll take \"Snowblind\" and \"Laguna Sunrise,\" and leave the rest. Fortunately, though, the best of the Ozzy era was cresting the horizon of that sunrise.\n",
        "\nAfter Sabbath hit their stride with \"Paranoid,\" their third output, \"Master of Reality\" definitely takes a small step backwards for me. This record is definitely still a solid one, with a lot of good elements to it, but there's nothing masterful about it like the album name suggests. I hear people call it Sabbath's heaviest record of their career all the time, and for sure when it was released it was, but of all time? \"Dehumanizer\" would like a word about that statement. Even if you want to just isolate the Ozzy era, in terms of pure heaviness, \"Sabotage\" probably beats this one out, too. On a technical level, this album isn't any of the member's best work. Iommi and Geezer still have amazing moments for sure, but neither of them are at their best here. Even songwriting wise, this album has a little less depth than even \"Paranoid\" had.\n\nMy complaints about Ozzy and Bill Ward start to really hit their boiling point on this record. \"Sweet Leaf\" is a prime example of why I dislike Bill Ward's style. His fills during and right after the solo of the song are so incredibly sloppy that it hurts. The whole section just has wild, spontaneous smashing across the whole thing. It's unfitting and off-putting. It adds virtually nothing to the track's mood or groove beyond Bill saying \"Look what I can do!\" I actually enjoy \"Sweet Leaf\" beyond this, though. It's definitely one of the album's standouts. Iommi belts out a very catchy, great grooving riff, and Ozzy sells the track pretty well. He does not do the same on \"Into the Void,\" however. Let me start by saying that I absolutely ADORE Iommi's into riffs on this song. And Geezer matching the riff behind him? Just magical. Every single time I listen to this album I wish I could love \"Into the Void\" because of this. But I cannot. Ozzy Osbourne 'sings' it. His vocals on this song are beyond awful. No melody even remotely. No emotion. He has nothing to bring to this track. He just whines his monotonous voice all across the track as if he just couldn't care to try. I'm not an Ozzy fan in general, but he DEFINITELY has done better than THIS. This song might be his worst work across his entire Sabbath career. His voice is one hundred percent bad enough to shatter any enjoyment I could possibly have for the track.\n\n\"Lord of this World\" and its intro \"Orchid\" are the true standouts on this record. \"Orchid\" is an outstandingly beautiful piece from Iommi. His acoustic melodies shine a bright light on the album, and the relaxing calm before the strong this track brings give so much life into the album. The flute work on \"Solitude\" is probably the only other similar moment on the record that gives us this kind of beautiful relief. \"Lord of this World\" has a swinging crushing groove to it led by another brilliant riff from Iommi. Geezer is also on fire with his bass work on this track. I think it's especially apparent on the solo of the song. I find myself listening more intently to Geezer's playing during the solo than I do to Iommi's. Bill Ward breaks out some insanely unfitting and gross cowbell work over some of the transition portions before the solos, but this is one minor complaint on an otherwise fantastic track.\n\nFor me, \"After Forever\" is definitely the worst track on the entire record. It starts out with an insanely sappy, boring, cringe worthy riff by Iommi, but then breaks into a far more fitting, heavier Sabbath riff during the verses. The verse riff is fantastic, but the song keeps switching back and forth between these two riffs, and it just makes it feel disjointed for me. It always makes me feel like they had half an idea for two different songs, but couldn't think of what to do with them, so they just mashed them together. While definitely not an awful track, I feel the songwriting on it is poor at best. As sacrilegious as I'm sure it is to most people reading this, I also think \"Children of the Grave\" is a pretty boring track. Not bad, but definitely boring. This is probably the one moment on the album that Ward's drumming shines on, and Geezer is also stupendous here. Iommi's riffs are just...nothing special here, and the song just loops on and on to me.\n\n\"Master of Reality\" is an album that does so much right, but so much wrong too. I always summarize it as an album that showed an evolution for Iommi and Geezer, but a devolution for Ozzy and Ward. And for the most part, the first two would keep growing and evolving from here, and the later two would keep slipping further and further. For me, it has always been an album with very few truly low points, but not really any shining highlights either. It's a solid addition to the Ozzy era, but I wouldn't call it the best for any member of this band.\n",
        "\nThe most amazing thing about \"Paranoid\" to me is that it came out just a bit more than six months after their debut. The musical growth Sabbath showed between the two is astounding. So much of the floundering around they did on the debut is gone on \"Paranoid.\" Usually that kind of growth can take a band half a decade over the course of several albums, but Sabbath evolved to the same degree in such a short time. Of course, Sabbath always has blues influences in their music, but where on the debut, it was dripping with it, \"Paranoid\" uses it more as an influence as opposed to worship. The debut started to pave the road, but \"Paranoid\" actually did the heavy lifting to complete that road.\n\nOn my previous review of their debut, I mentioned really not being a big fan of Ozzy or Ward, but in all fairness, this album is some of both of their best work. A big strike against \"Paranoid\" is really of no fault of its own. The pure over saturation of the album, especially the hits, has kind of dulled the impact of the album to me. Everyone has heard \"War Pigs,\" \"Iron Man,\" and the title track of the album ad nauseam. Regardless of what you personally think of these tracks, I think we can all come to an agreement that Sabbath has SO much more that deserves to share a bit of the spotlight with these three. This can be said of the Ozzy era just by itself, let alone the great work that came after it.\n\n\"Iron Man\" is a fantastic track, and one that I think helped establish Iommi as the riff God he is. Every single riff he throws out on this song is just genius. Heavy, brilliant, powerful riffs. Ozzy's shrillness in his voice is actually very fitting here as well. \"War Pigs\" is a song that I pretty much skip to the end of every time I listen to it. Not being big on Ozzy, the fact that a huge chunk of this song kind of rests on his vocals to guide it just doesn't do it for me. I also HAVE to mention that this song also shows a little bit of the youth still remaining in their songwriting, considering the FIRST two lines of this song rhyme \"masses\" with....\"masses..?\" Really guys? It also baffles me that no one really mentions this, either. I know the meaning of each of these are different on each line, but still. Could we not have thought of something else to fit? The last two minutes of this song are where it's at, though. One of Iommi's most genius solos and riffs ever make my boredom of the rest of the song fade away. The ending is worth the song's run time by itself.\n\nThe title track of the album...sure is a Black Sabbath song. Everything about it is just far to simplistic for me. Frankly, it's one of Iommi's most boring riffs of his entire career, and Geezer and Ward aren't really doing anything special either. I definitely don't hate the song but...again, can't wrap my head around why this song has gained the popularity that it has. The closer \"Fairies Wear Boots\" is another of the album's weakest tracks for me. I definitely appreciate the heavy energy the song brings to the table, but once again, Iommi's riffs on this track are pretty weak. Not horrible riffs by any means, but I expect better from him. I do enjoy his very cool, but short solo on the track. This is just another song that Ozzy is meant to carry, and while I definitely do not think he ruins the song like I think he does to other songs, his voice is just not good enough to carry songs.\n\nNo, \"Planet Caravan\" is the song on the album that he kills almost single-handedly. First, I will point out that Bill Ward's hand drum work is beautifully done to enhance the mood of this track. He calls himself a 'percussionist' instead of a 'drummer,' and while I find that insanely pretentious, this song is probably an example of what he refers to. But while he, Iommi, and Geezer all do their part in laying the frames of a really atmospheric song...here comes Ozzy to destroy it. No amount of distortion on his voice can save it. His whiny, shrill, bored vocals pierce the atmosphere of the song like a blade. A more talented singer could have made this song a perfect breathing point that adds variety to the album, but instead, I flinch whenever his voice flutters into my ears. Now, I haven't given Geezer nearly the credit he deserves up to this point either. \"Hand of Doom\" is the track where the rest need to bow to him. Again, Bill Ward's subtle snare rim work does a lot to sell this song as well, but it's Geezer's perfect bass lines that makes this song such a joy. Iommi is mimicking it to help bring it to the forefront for a while, but Geezer is the backbone, and the one to listen to the most on the track. Iommi comes out with a solid and enjoyable riff when the song explodes to the heavier segment, and Ozzy actually does his part on this song well. His voice does a very good job at selling the downtrodden mood the track feeds on. \"Hand of Doom\" and \"Electric Funeral\" are really two songs that specifically helped mold the doom metal subgenre, and both are quality listens.\n\nThere is absolutely no doubt that this album deserves the attention it got then, and still gets today. Undeniably, every single person on this website; be they a humble user such as myself, or one of the many bands housed on the site owe something to this record. Sabbath took some monstrous steps on \"Paranoid\" since their debut, and this record is without question one of the best the Ozzy era has to offer. Both Black Sabbath as a band, and each member individually would only continue to change and expand from here. Unfortunately, for some members, this would end up being for the worse instead of the better.\n",
        "\nLet me clear the air right off the bat, so you can burn me alive before I even get to the review. I LOVE Black Sabbath, but what I love about them are the two men holding the guitars. Tony Iommi and Geezer Butler. In my opinion, Ozzy Osbourne is the luckiest man in the history of music. The man has as close to zero talent as you can possibly get, but he found himself with musicians who were so talented, they made him look good, and he has since made a career out of it. While I definitely think Bill Ward is a technically VERY good drummer, I do not like his style in the least. I think his beats and fills are SO unfitting for the music being played around him. As an aside, I DO think this album is some of his best work. Naturally, this means that I end up liking Sabbath more and more after these two hit the road. All of that being said, I don't hate Ozzy-era Sabbath. There's still quite a bit of quality there.\n\nFor their debut, the first side is what matters and keeps my interest, and the second side is pretty forgettable material. If the second side of this record wasn't on this album by this band, I don't think anyone would really talk about it. I think the biggest face-palm on the whole record is on the closer, which is their cover of \"Warning.\" Ozzy sings the chorus as \"I was born without you, baby\" instead of \"I was warned about you, baby,\" which literally defeats the entire purpose of the song's title. Now, as noted earlier, even though I'm generally not huge on Bill Ward, this album is probably the album that his drum work fits the best. Mostly due to the fact that this is probably Sabbath's least 'metal' record, which is drumming style fits better for. This track is no exception. Geezer is the star of this track with a phenomenal bassline. His bass fills gaps in songs all over this album to keep giving listeners something to enjoy while the rest of the band takes pauses. At the end of the day, though, Ozzy's crooning is a total emotionless bore, and Iommi doesn't really have a good riff. He does a TON of solo noodling, but this only accentuates the fact that this track is just such a boring, uninspired, lazy jam of a song. Despite this song being a cover, their interpretation of it is an utter snooze.\n\n\"Wicked World\" is again, also just pretty much a jam, albeit a more bluesy and uptempo one. Once again, Geezer's bass work ends up being the real hero for the song, and again, like before, Ward's drum work is pretty tasty for this kind of song. While Iommi has a pretty cool atmospheric solo in the middle, he's really not doing much else interesting on the song. Ozzy just doesn't have the voice nor the strength to carry this song as I imagine was intended. However, he does get to shine a bit with his harmonica work on \"The Wizard.\" This track is definitely a direction the band never took anywhere else in their career, and that great catchy harmonica groove which is followed by some simple, but powerful Iommi riffs give this song a very special feel. Ward is also flying in a very appropriate way on this song, and his fills add to the power and energy of the track very well.\n\nOf course, the title track can easily be called the song that MADE metal, and for good reason. It is atmospherically a really doom-y and ominous song despite the simplicity to it. In that aspect, I have nothing but respect and admiration for what Sabbath set out to accomplish. That's what it comes down to here for me. Much like this album, I have a ton of respect for this song. But if you asked me if I really LIKE it? Well, I can't really say this is a song that I throw on to just listen to it. I love the atmosphere, but it's a bit too long for Iommi's three notes of doom for my taste. On top of it, while the song tries to be ominous and scary, Ozzy's voice is the exact opposite. He can scream and cry all he wants, but he just doesn't have the range to sell me on what's offered. The quicker paced ending groove is a wonderful way to close the track out, though. I just wish it came about a minute and a half earlier.\n\n\"N.I.B.\" is the crown jewel of this album, though. Quite honestly, it's one of the best tracks from the entire Ozzy era in my opinion. Geezer's bass intro is a nice little showcase of what he can do, and it remains tasty while also not going on long enough to overstays its welcome. Iommi's riffs and little solo melodies all across this song are fantastic enough to be an inspiration for every single person reading this review. And again, writing and singing about Satan to any degree in 1970 took a TON of courage, so I cannot give Sabbath more respect here. This song is just a heavy, fun song that gives a little bit of everything you could want in a Sabbath track.\n\nAll in all, I also think the album's theming both musically and lyrically are just inconsistent and off the walls as well. You have half an album of really dark, powerful tracks that have structured writing, and then another half of bluesy jams that seem quite random. Black Sabbath's debut is one that I absolutely acknowledge what it means to music. I have the utmost respect for what this album built the groundwork for. However, respect and enjoyment are two different things, and I think both this band and this genre had long strides to take from this solid jumping off point before I hit enjoyment as well as respect.\n",
        "\nHarking back in time and space, one fondly mind-wedgies themself by appraising their Dio-helmed Heaven And Hell masterpiece from 1980 - year of Dobermans, Oldsmobiles and Intellivision - as Black Sabbath's most soul-edifying record, more so, even, than past epoch mammoths Master of Reality or ascending Volume 4 and Sabbath, Bloody, Sabbath. Hence, according to manifold, at times bold or provocative, Metal-Archive musings, they also sense an underlying mythical sheen exclusive to its lot. \n\nJust like Elvis' \"Hounddog\" or Bill Haley & His Comets' \"Rock Around The Clock\" - which beats Kuenring's \"Rock Around the Christmas Tree\" any day - and, most iconically, Jerry Lee Lewis' \"Great Balls Of Fire\" ripped our folks, as much as theirs, new ones, kick-ass, pioneering worthies such as the progressively numinous and enchanting \"Children of the Sea\" or auspicious lead choked humdinger of a timeless, knockabout, rustproof mien, \"Die Young\", moulded our culturistic sensibilities for a lifetime. That said, the latter is immensely replayable due, in part, to Ron's mellifluous crooning at the behest of a scintillating, ahead-of-its-time bridge which yields further celestial leads of a trilling and centrifugal - not fugacious! - nature. Geezer's bass actively caroms about with insouciant ease, like a clumsy Middle Age jouster's primitive untarnished weaponry. Leads, especially on \"Neon Knights\" and, of course, the latter half of \"Heaven And Hell\" shine as brilliantly - that is, with a similarly eerie and beatic iridescence - as any Kreutz Sungrazer! \n\nI'd caught Black Sabbath live the last time they were in town, with both shows fronted by Tony Martin - he performed well enough, but, surely, was no Ozzy or Dio - yet the real deal occurred the second go-around, whence the lights dimmed during said epochal title track at Montreal's Molson Center sometime during the Summer of 2002. As soon as he broke into that fanatically dexterous, hyper-motion power-lead, it was like both he and the audience conjoined together, rooted in spot as if in a trance, immobile-like and utterly daz(zl)ed...right \"into it\". (I could've sworn I saw a halo above Tony's shaggy pate!) \n\nAny metal head worth their salt must duly (re)acquaint themselves with Black Sabb's \"Le Paradis et l'Enfer\". Surely, one day, decades into the future, potentially next century, its timeless mythos and lore will honor the hallowed museum stores accredited to an inimaginable long-descended generation of hardened, and no less wise, (cybernetic? cloned? biologically engineered?!) minstrels. For example, there's no reason why the catchily sardonic \"Lady Evil\" - my preferred track alongside \"Neon Knights\", \"Die Young\" and, of course, solo-extravagant top codpiece \"Heaven And Hell\" - shouldn't distantly prevail, well into the Age of Aquarius, whilst tickling our & their humours from here to infinity and beyond. \n\nAs such, dig Butler's gibbous, thwump-ing bass (line) to \"Lady Evil\" (precursor to 3 Inches of Blood's \"Lady Deathwish\", maybe?), buoyed by ever-rocksteady mid-tempo drumming - the likes of which set up/down (all around!) a killer Evel Knievel assimilating ramp, in time for its silly and wanton, albeit injuriously gripping, chorus. How often, now, have I begat wry, eyebrow cocked attention upon my twisted person by letting it slip out in public, most shamelessly?\n\nHa! It's no wonder, then, this here Dio, Iommi, Butler and Ward incarnation of Black Sabbath commands us, thusly, towards (an) everlasting night.\n\n\"There's a place just south of Witches' Valley\nWhere they say the wind won't blow\nAnd they only speak in whispers of her name\nThere's a lady they say who feeds the darkness\nIt eats right from her hand\nWith a crying shout she'll search you out\nAnd freeze you where you stand\n\nLady Evil, evil\nShe's a magical, mystical woman!\nLady Evil, evil in my mind\nShe's queen of the night!\nAll right!\"\n",
        "\nA couple of unsuccessful albums and weird changes in the band's formula gave rise to Osbourne's departure in such an unexpected fashion. For those reasons, the project seemed to remain headless, with no apparent direction and pointing directly to the abyss from a creative standpoint. Ronnie James Dio, on the other hand, left Rainbow after certain creative differences with Ritchie Blackmore. However, as a surprising move from destiny, Dio joined Black Sabbath as their new vocalist. As such, his arrival came along with a renewal in the Sab's formula but keeping essential components. Among others, the doomish paces and the trademark dark atmosphere.\n\nThe first sign of changes is visible through their legendary speed metal track \"Neon Knights.\" The powerful and strong feeling transmitted by the song together with the well-known mighty vocals from Dio and his trademark dungeons & dragons songwriting style, made of it a very astonishing initial shot. Moreover, the soloing from Tommy Iommi is no less than impressive due to his ability to play soft guitar solos that fit the most energetic songs. \n\nHis guitar playing skills are more evident, nonetheless, in the title track, which is with no doubts, one of the most impressive tracks Black Sabbath has ever written, definitively, a total winner. This number incredibly starts with a very astonishing guitar riff, and it moves along at different tempos. Still, as it is the style of other previously created proggy masterpieces (\"Stairway to Heaven\" as an immediate example), the song grows incredibly during the ending part. It runs along with a quite memorable guitar solo.\n\nAnother impressive epic piece is the mid-paced \"Children of the Sea,\" totally, a highlight of this album. Of course, everything here is as perfect as in the two songs mentioned above, especially, on how the song transitions from a melodic acoustic intro to heavier passages. Other highlights include the faster \"Die Young\" and the closing track \"Lonely is the World,\" which features a beautiful guitar solo at the ending part. That said, Sabbath came back to the arena with a very competent release that marked the return of a band in a very unexpected fashion. To your surprise, there is no filling stuff to be found but a song set that will make you listen to it over and over. It is is an essential release if your favorite metal subgenre talks about dungeons and dragons.\n\n=====\n\nI'm proud to announce that this is my 50th review in the site, and what a special album to write about!\n\nSpecial thanks to the Encyclopaedia Metallum staff for all their continued support!\n\nYou can also read this review in https://antichristmagazine.com/review-black-sabbath-heaven-and-hell-vertigo-records-warner-bros-records/\n",
        "\nOf all of their studio albums, and particularly during their 70s heyday, Black Sabbath's best is Master of Reality. At a very lean 34 minutes, it does not need to be any longer than it already is. Sure, you could have the interludes Embryo and Orchid lengthened, but that could honestly lead to unnecessary padding. Master of Reality thrills you and then leaves just as soon as it arrived, like so many other great short albums do. Yet, most of the songs are five minutes long, with the album closer being six, so you get some sizeable epics on this thing, ranging from surprisingly pro-Christian themes as a retort against the claims of Satanism (After Forever & Lord of This World), the rallying up of the children of the future to resist atomic war before it's too late (Children of the Grave), the loss of the self after a break-up (Solitude), the want to leave Earth after the damage done (Into the Void), and an ode to smoking the puff ting spliff (Sweet Leaf). The album is also all the more important and imperative as its the band's first trve metal album, abandoning the blues rock from their debut and the hints of it on Paranoid entirely for something wholly original.\n\nTo say that the two albums which precede it were influential is such an understatement it's not even funny. Paranoid, especially, fucking rules. The first side alone, you have the epic anti-Vietnam War Pigs, which has some of the best riffs and musical passages known to man - that DUN DUN! tho - and the title track which is persistent and driving. Planet Caravan slows things down, before picking it all back up with Iron Man, another contender for best riff ever. Also, I must add, the second half of that album is just as good, with the one-two slow punches of Electric Funeral and Hand of Doom, the latter about the damage PTSD does to war veterans and details the story of one who resorts to heroin. It is let down slightly by the instrumental Rat Salad, but the anti-skinhead Fairies Wear Boots closes the album off strongly. Most of all, the band are on point throughout this album, especially the rhythm section.\n\nBlack Sabbath acted as one entity but were also comprised of four individuals who each brought something to the table. The rhythm section consisted of Geezer Butler on the bass (he also wrote the band's lyrics), and Bill Ward on drums. Butler is a fantastic bass player with a speedy right hand and adds something of a groovy funk to the proceedings. Bill Ward's jazzy influences were pretty pronounced and was not flashy, though his fills were subtle and well thought out. Without them, the music of Black Sabbath would have been stiff and stunted.\n\nTony Iommi is the godfather of metal. Make no mistake about it. After losing his fingertips in an accident at his workplace, he had to have metal implants where they used to be. This led to guitar playing being painful, especially because he occupied the bottom two strings most of all for lower, chunkier riffs. So, by the end of 1970, he downtuned his guitar a whole step and a half to make it relatively comfortable to play. The result? One of the first uses of down-tuning in rock, though far from being an aesthetic choice, this was out of necessity. \n\nI'll be honest: Ozzy Osbourne's vocals were not technically good. He goes out of key, his voice cracks, he wobbles, and sometimes shouts aimlessly. However, he was absolutely perfect for Black Sabbath. Songs about insanity, the Devil, nuclear war, war in general, drug-induced paranoia, depression and anger at what mankind has done do not sound best through pitch perfect vocals. He was the ultimate harbinger of doom, second only to the guitar in being the key focal point of Black Sabbath.\n\nWhoever decided that Master of Reality should begin with the sound of Tony Iommi coughing after taking a big hit with a joint is a genius. It's actually hilarious, considering the band's image of poe-faced, doom-obsessed troglodytes. Instead, the opening song Sweet Leaf is a love song dedicated to marijuana. It has all the subtlety of a Rolling Stones song about sex. Oh, and, I should mention: the fucking riffs on this album, and indeed on this song, are some of the best ever recorded. Just balls to the wall riffage that doesn't relent and keeps coming back for more and more. Ozzy's vocals are a little unhinged, a little high, with plenty of \"oh yeahs!\" and \"oh right nows!\" as if there were no tomorrow. His desire to smoke the cush is complete with phrases such as \"you introduced me to my mind\", or \"my life is free now, my life is clear\", or \"you gave to me a new belief\". I love the introduction of the second guitar playing the notes of the riff come verse two. I also love the bridge section with rolling toms which almost go out of tempo against Butler's walking bass line and Iommi's shredding, before it gradually slows down again and - BOOM! \"COME ON NOW!\" Amazing, amazing song. \n\nAfter Forever is the first overtly pro-Christian song by Black Sabbath, though maybe that's not true. It is clue from the outset that the band were Christians, but this was more subtly used on previous albums. Now, they are not kidding around; they love Jesus. What's more, the main guitar melody - complete with some sweet bass playing - is actually triumphant. The verse riffs are cripplingly awesome, with the bridge taking things lower and deeper. It is a little long, but ultimately worth it, and whilst I don't agree with the song's message, it's all about the music, man, so who cares?\n\nA short, interlude entitled Embryo segues nicely into the album's most famous song, Children of the Grave, with a speedy and shuffled groove established early on with Butler's bass pulsating with emerging drums. You hear feedback. And then, the first true instance of the down-tuned guitar by Iommi. Another killer riff, and in comes another killer vocal performance from Osbourne. Lyrically, it does read as fairly standard protest stuff - \"revolution in their minds / the children start to march / against the world in which they have to live / and all the hate that's in their hearts\" - but the desperation and the urgency for the children to \"listen to what I say\" is apparent, especially in the shadow \"of atomic fear\". Each verse ends with a \"yeah!\" which would normally be out of place, but actually works in the song's favour. After another great solo, complete with unison bends, the closing minute is this creepy ambience, complete with \"children of the grave\" whispers, as if these same children are whispering from beyond. Chilling stuff.\n\nOrchid is a nice little ditty to open up Side Two which could have used some expansion, but whatever length, it does not prepare anyone for the menacing swagger of Lord of This World. As soon as that riff bursts out of the gate, you know you're in for a wild ride. Unexpectedly, the song slows down and sleazes along effortlessly. Ozzy's vocals are upfront and confrontational, presumably from the point of view of Mr. Skydaddy himself. \"You're searching for your mind, don't know where to start\" is an epic, put-you-on-the-spot opening lyric, and the song turns even darker; \"the soul I took from you was not even missed, yeah!\" And then, comes cowbell! Woo hoo! More epic doom riffing; \"Lord of this world!!!\", return, more cowbell.\n\nSee, here's the thing: a lot of songs on this album follow the same pattern. Epic intro, verse, interlude, verse, bridge/tempo variation, verse, solo, outro. You'd think that it would get boring but Black Sabbath always keeps it fresh and entertaining on this album. Speaking of that, check out Solitude. You know what I said earlier about Ozzy's vocals being not technically good? Well don't listen to me because I'm full of shit. He actually sings on this song, and he sings well and emotively. In fact, it's probably Sabbath's best ballad full stop. The guitar is so smooth and sorrowful, whilst the bass emphasises the melancholy of the song's themes. The absent drums work in the song's favour, and the addition of flutes and pianos foreshadow the band's next album, Vol 4. \n\nAs an aside, read these lyrics. They are actually heart wrenching.\nOh, where can I go to and what can I do?\nNothing can please me, only thoughts are of you\nYou just laughed when I begged you to stay\nI've not stopped crying since you went away\nWent away, you went away...\n\nInto the Void reads almost as a continuation of Solitude. It's almost as if the same narrator has taken matters into his own hands. That opening, sludgy and utterly stoned riff kicks in with some lazy drums before giving us a small variation. The pace picks up and then we are literally \"in the atmosphere\" with Ozzy. The music has the rumbling quality of the rocket in the song, and Ozzy's echoed vocals sounds like he is far from Earth, about to make the \"final suicide\". The bridge even turns into proto-thrash metal (what didn't this band influence?!!) before returning to the main motif.\n\nLet's not beat around the bush: Into the Void is the heaviest song of all time. Sure, you get louder songs and about more gruesome subject matter, but it doesn't get any better than the closing minute and a half of Iommi riffage. Butler and Ward also jam a little at the end, too! The whole thing is a masterpiece in the pleasure-pain see saw: the guitars are mixed a bit too loudly and panned rigorously in the last sections, but it's the kind of pain that gives its way to ecstasy and repeated listens.\n\nWhich is why I think Master of Reality is the best Black Sabbath album. They maybe had more iconic songs on Paranoid, and became much more diverse on Vol 4, or more proggy on Sabbath Bloody Sabbath and the criminally underrated Sabotage, but when it comes to delivering the best of the best, Black Sabbath only needed about 30 - 35 minutes of material to not only birth doom, sludge and stoner metal, but to further their musical development and evolution. And at nearly forty-eight years old, it shows no signs of ageing. Most of all, it was always be the Master.\n\nPlay it fucking  loud.\n",
        "\nAs a millennial, I\u2019ve had more than one friend question if 70s Black Sabbath is actually \u201cmetal\u201d by modern standards. Such a concept is obvious heresy but makes some sense if you squint hard enough at it. Omnipresent radio rock staples aside, the band operated outside of heavy metal conventions as often as they were inventing them. Their first two albums are basically dark blues records, the run from Volume 4 to Sabotage might as well be prog rock, and their last two with Ozzy aren\u2019t heavy by any stretch of the imagination. But all things considered, Master of Reality is enough proof that Black Sabbath was always at their core a heavy metal band.\n\nDespite whatever protometal relic you can pull out of your ass, nothing was heavier than Master of Reality in 1971. Tony Iommi\u2019s guitar tone was enough to set that distinction. Black Sabbath\u2019s prior albums had a decidedly ominous atmosphere but his decision to downtune with Geezer\u2019s bass following suit took that sense of impending doom to unprecedented levels. It\u2019s organic enough to not sound out of place in the 70s rock climate but still has enough grime to be just as earthshaking as your modern stoner/sludge metal fare. Groups like MC5 may have been rowdier and more aggressive, but this album still sounds like the goddamned apocalypse.\n\nThe band also seemed to be tighter as a unit with a much more focused vision. The Sab Four always had fantastic chemistry but the structures on this album are more fully realized than anything that had come before. Nothing on Paranoid could\u2019ve ever reached the speeds of the charging \u201cChildren of the Grave\u201d and while the tempo shifts on songs like \u201cSweet Leaf\u201d and \u201cInto the Void\u201d are nothing new, they were never this purposeful. The band was clearly done meandering around and not a single second is wasted, effectively bridging the gap from the psych blues jams of \u201cWarning\u201d and \u201cN.I.B.\u201d to the elaborate journeys of \u201cMegalomania\u201d and \u201cWheels of Confusion.\u201d\n\nOf course, the album\u2019s stellar songwriting is what truly drives everybody and their father to imitate it so much. Whether you\u2019re looking at the \u201cLord of this World\u201d doom chugs, the proto-power metal \u201cAfter Forever,\u201d or the ambient \u201cSolitude,\u201d every song has a legendary status with influences heard in multiple demographics. But in contrast to Paranoid\u2019s overplayed nature, these songs are actively sought out and seemingly spread in a much more organic fashion. Everybody in the underground knows \u201cSweet Leaf\u201d and \u201cChildren of the Grave\u201d but is anybody as sick of them as they are of \u201cWar Pigs\u201d and \u201cIron Man?\u201d\n\nMaster of Reality is a perfect album by every standard. It shows Sabbath at their best as musicians and songwriters while setting an insanely high bar for all other heavy metal acts to follow. Some could deem the album too short, especially with two of eight songs being short interludes, but anything more would just be superfluous. The individual songs are all complete and the short overall length feels like a challenge for anybody who would follow in their footsteps. I can only imagine how cataclysmic this thing sounded back in \u201971 but with how timeless it sounds, you don\u2019t have to come at it from that angle to fully appreciate it.\n\nHighlights:\n\u201cChildren of the Grave\u201d\n\u201cLord of This World\u201d\n\u201cSolitude\u201d\n\u201cInto the Void\u201d\n\nOriginally published at http://psychicshorts.blogspot.com\n",
        "\nBlack Sabbath was the band M-A asked for when I registered. Who invented heavy metal was the question, right? Honestly speaking, I thought I had to answer Cronos, Paul Speckmann or, when push comes to shove, Joey deMaio. However, one day I found the answer. Nevertheless, \"Headless Cross\" has absolutely nothing in common with innovation. Tony Iommi and his almost interchangeable companions recorded a very polished, smoothly flowing album with conventionally designed songs. This doesn't sound very exciting? Well, we are coming to the point right now.\n\nLead singer Tony Martin knows his metier, but he always sounds too clean, too pure and over-emotional. Although his voice has depth and charisma, he is not the natural born metal vocalist and some hideous background vocals (\"Devil & Daughter\") are even more annoying. In his best moments, Martin sounds like the unforgotten Ronnie James (\"When Death Calls\"). Well, I am quite sure that Dio's voice would have make pure gold out of this dramatic and intense highlight, but Martin also does a good job here. Too bad that the band is not able to keep the class of \"When Death Calls\" during the entire playtime. Riffmaster Iommy presents some generic macho-riffs in the title track. They seem to be carefully aligned with the equally generic artwork and push the painfully conservative number on a solid level. Generally speaking, riffmaster cannot be blamed for offering insubstantial songs under the banner that condemns him to constant top performance. \"Call of the Wild\", for example, has some really strong sections, not only the somewhat desperate chorus. \"A Kill in the Spirit World\" also scores with a chorus which floats above the profane things, but it does not go hand in hand with its good time rock verses.\n\nThe production walks the thin line between \"harsh enough\" and \"too light\". Whenever the quintet pulls out all the stops, the album glitters with a profound heaviness, but the rather emotional parts often fail to generate an appropriate pressure. Of course, all instruments are well-balanced, while the voice stands in the spot light. But I guess a band with that status cannot win with a good sound, it can only lose when confronting the audience with badly produced songs. It might be unfair, but even a flawless mix should be nothing but a matter of course for the leading bands of the genre, at least in my humble opinion.\n\nThe lyrics also remind me strongly of Dio. \"A kiss in the wind whispers murder, murder\" is only one of the lines which fit the lyrical approach of the little man with the impressive vocals. And yes, there is maybe a spiritual and musical connection between this album and the glorious \"Dehumanizer\" with Dio's gargantuan performance. But more or less each and every song of \"Dehumanizer\" hit the bull's eye, while a few tracks remain pretty faceless and predictable on the here presented work. Perhaps heavy metal would be more exciting if Paul Speckmann had invented it. Or Cronos, Donald T. or Maggy Thatcher - I will discuss this with Tony Iommi.\n",
        "\nBlack Sabbath were a heavy metal and doom metal band from England. But that's obvious at this point, considering everyone in the band today, are/were well-known musicians who basically found this amazing genre of music. This album really digs into the style of how heavy metal and doom metal were founded with it's very experimental construction. And with being formed in 1969, and becoming an exceedingly large band through various changes throughout their career, quite a few of us reviewers could appreciate such outstanding music. I'm so glad that the art of recording and capturing the illusion of music became apparently during this era. Or a lot of us would have really missed some of the best and original music performed by their original creators. Bless this record. \n\nThe production of this recording is exceedingly fine, considering the year this record was released to the public. It's nearly perfect in quality. One could only assume how difficult it probably was to actually produce this record. Especially when you think about it now, people like myself would have it greatly easier than these guys back then. Everything is a form of instant-gratification now...like, seriously. The guitar melody and structure are solid. Not overly fancy, but slow, low, strong, distorted and straightforward. You have really slow tempos and it's a little groovy from time-to-time, with some high-pitched guitar-based intro with some well-paced drumming. The drumming is really on-point and has such a nice tone, played really well. I'd dare say that the drummer has been playing for awhile before having this record released, it's practically gold. Not missing a beat. \n\nThe bass is a decently strong, driving force in the background. You can really feel it, it's like being a few miles down the road and you can hear a Detroit concert across the lake where Windsor is. Something like that. The bass provides really good leveling, in terms of audio. It's not blurry-sounding, it's actually quite clean, and considerably low in tone, which I think is fantastic. Good ol' Ozzy's vocals are something on a totally different level. The guy's got such a strong-like voice, has a lot of power in his voice. I think singing became almost-natural to him. Could you imagine him doing early 1980's death metal vocals? No way, not me. I wouldn't be able to begin to imagine that. So-much passion and emotional tone, in his voice. That harmonica though...seriously... That's so funky, it's really amazing. The instruments being used back then when this was recorded, are just simply amazing. Even the quality of the instruments themselves, sound so-much better than the modern ones we hear on virtually any record now. \n\nI simply love this band's album artwork. So retro-like, simple and something you could relate to, yourself, back then. A little bit odd in some sense, but something that was really catchy and would attract you, in order to purchase this record. This band might be overrated, just in general, but these guys really did make quality music, art and everything else...they worked considerably hard to get the fame they ended up earning today. If not for these guys, metal in general, any form of it, wouldn't be alive 'n well as we know it, that's for sure. Go out and purchase yourself this amazing gem. Lyrics are really something else as well. I can appreciate the thoughts and feelings that goes into the word-writing stages. This record also provides cover songs, too. Which are great! It's (the album, I mean) worth every buck you put towards it. It's chill, simple and just so memorable!\n",
        "\nBlack Sabbath getting Dio on board was a great move. Sabbath getting Vinny Appice to replace Bill Ward was sensible. Sabbath writing and recording Mob Rules was\u2026predictable. A certain spark meant that Heaven and Hell proved one of the band\u2019s strongest records, especially after the disappointments of the latter Ozzy years; this successor, released around 18 months later, doesn\u2019t really have the same spark. Good songs comingle with decent ones, but the decent ones just end up sounding like filler \u2013 talented artists treading water in the frothing pool of the early \u201880s.\n\nI\u2019m not very happy with what changed stylistically during this period, since it seemed that the band\u2019s sound smoothed out and became closer to hard rock than heavy metal, whether that be the early doom metal template or the more progressive metal of the mid-\u201870s. Granted, having Dio on board must have made Tony Iommi want to change things up, though he regresses to simplistic riffs that generally go on too long in any given song. Go and read Caspian\u2019s review if you want an overview of how repetition goes wrong on Mob Rules. My personal beef, however, remains the lacklustre creativity that went into this album. If you believe half the stories about Iommi\u2019s cocaine use, you\u2019d bet that he wasn\u2019t up to making cool-headed decisions: this album just seems to be the wrong direction at the wrong time. If it picks any direction, that is.\n\nYou see, we get a couple of songs ripped from Dio\u2019s time in Rainbow, one big doozy from Sabbath\u2019s own past catalogue, a ballad that opens similarly to those on Heaven and Hell, another (slightly less) pointless interlude, and one or two cuts that caught the trend of the NWOBHM. The ones that cluster around the end of the album fall sonically closer to the hard rock of Dio\u2019s last Rainbow album Long Live Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll, particularly \u2018Slipping Away\u2019, which is the nadir of this effort. Edging into sentimental territory on \u2018Country Girl\u2019, \u2018Over and Over\u2019, and \u2018The Sign of the Southern Cross\u2019 may have suited this version of the group much better than early Sabbath, yet it also highlights the cleanliness of the production, commercial ambition of the direction, and \u2013 unfortunately \u2013 lack of chemistry between the bandmembers. The mix of things going on feels just like the group\u2019s situation at the time: Mob Rules is an album that showcases a crisis of identity.\n\nThe points where things definitely go right would certainly be enough to satisfy most fans of heavy metal. The title track sounds approximately 10 times more energetic than everything else here, using the faster, more upbeat formula that became possible for the group with Dio on vocals, while \u2018Turn Up the Night\u2019 seems theoretically creditable, since it provides a positive contrast with the largely slow pace elsewhere. However, placing it first and taking little care in finessing the piece was probably a mistake. I\u2019m fairly keen on \u2018Voodoo\u2019, even though it falls into the hard rock category that I\u2019m less interested in; that\u2019s because it struts pretty nicely and poses prettily with the solo, Iommi crinkling the strings of his guitar at several moments. (By \u2018crinkling\u2019, I mean he\u2019s pushing them down onto the bridge with his hand, and the effect is an attractive metallic crinkling noise.) Despite accusations that \u2018Falling Off the Edge of the World\u2019 recycles elements from the previous album, it\u2019s a pleasant romp through mid-paced energy after beginning as a contemplative ballad.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t say I disliked Mob Rules so much as to call it bad or to say that it isn\u2019t a reasonable addition to the band\u2019s discography, though it doesn\u2019t possess the interest value of any of the \u201870s material, nor the quality of Sabbath\u2019s other work with Dio. Not so many fresh ideas flourish on here as you would hope from such musicians, nor are the songs really up to that much, even factoring in my disappoint with the style. Usually, Mob Rules gets caught up in the general Dio/Sabbath enthusiasm, but I seem incapable of that. Not that great.\n",
        "\nBlack Sabbath completely reinvented itself when Ozzy Osbourne left and Ronnie James Dio took over. \u2018Heaven And Hell\u2019 turned out to be one of the greatest heavy metal albums of all time and made Sabbath catch up with the blossoming NWOBHM scene with class and conviction. Its follow-up \u2018Mob Rules\u2019 is often seen as more of the same. But while the album still mostly relies on the perfect blend of Sabbath\u2019s at the time unprecedented heaviness and Dio\u2019s more melodic hardrock sensibilities, it\u2019s also quite a bit heavier than \u2018Heaven And Hell\u2019. \u2018Mob Rules\u2019 is an excellent album in its own right.\n\nLooking back, it does seem like remaining original members Tony Iommi (guitar) and Geezer Butler (bass) tried to inject some more of the slow, heavy doom metal (although it was not yet known as such) that Black Sabbath was renowned for in the Ozzy-era back into their sound. Though to be fair, the arrival of new drummer Vinny Appice probably contributed to that as well, as he is a more straightforward power hitter than Bill Ward. I have once seen the album described as Iommi and Dio trying to blow each other off the record and though that description is apt, it also suggests less cohesion than actually can be heard.\n\n\u2018The Sign Of The Southern Cross\u2019 is far and away the longest and heaviest track on \u2018Mob Rules\u2019. It is built upon simple, but monstrous riffs that don\u2019t contain a lot of notes, but wring everything out of those that are there. It also is the perfect rebuttal for the previous statement, as the band leaves plenty of room for Dio\u2019s majestic voice in the verses. This also does wonders for the dynamics of the song. Following it, however, is \u2018The Mob Rules\u2019, which injects Sabbath\u2019s music with the savage aggression of the punk era. In a way, \u2018Mob Rules\u2019 marries what were the best elements of past and present when the album came out in 1981.\n\nOne often heard complaint is that \u2018Mob Rules\u2019 follows the sequencing of \u2018Heaven And Hell\u2019 a little too closely, but that may originate from staunch critics of the band. Sure, \u2018Turn Up The Night\u2019 is stylistically similar to \u2018Neon Knights\u2019 \u2013 uptempo, powerful and romantic \u2013 and tracks like \u2018Voodoo\u2019 and \u2018Country Girl\u2019 reprise the loose, rocky vibe of the likes of \u2018Lady Evil\u2019, but the sound of \u2018Mob Rules\u2019 is so characteristic that nobody would mistake them for \u2018Heaven And Hell\u2019 tracks. In addition, \u2018Falling Off The Edge Of The World\u2019 and \u2018Over And Over\u2019 don\u2019t sound like anything Black Sabbath has done before or since. The latter is an impressive doom metal ballad, unlikely as that sounds, and the former an epic heavy metal track that would not sound out of place on one of Dio\u2019s first two albums, had it not been for the main riff that just screams Iommi.\n\nUltimately, \u2018Mob Rules\u2019 does in deed fall somewhat short of \u2018Heaven And Hell\u2019. The interlude \u2018E5150\u2019 is much too long, especially considering its place on the album, and \u2018Slipping Away\u2019 isn\u2019t exactly the most inspired Black Sabbath track to date. Give it some time, however, and the album will proof it has a lot of merit on its own. Some of the songs are quite unique entries into the Black Sabbath catalog and worthy of being heard. There is simply too much good stuff on this record to be dismissed as the lesser Black Sabbath album with Dio.\n\nRecommended tracks: \u2018The Sign Of The Southern Cross\u2019, \u2018Falling Off The Edge Of The World\u2019, \u2018Turn Up The Night\u2019\n\nOriginally written for my Kevy Metal weblog\n",
        "\nEven now there is just three of them left; the drummer's seat is now occupied by Tommy Clufetos (who used to drum for Ted Nugent and other well-established bands) and good old Rick Wakeman's son, Adam, who is credited as guest keyboardist although I could not spot him throughout the nearly 110' gig.\n\nMaybe the band members are not conveying the impression of being on fire anymore as in the early days, but they sure put out a hell of a show. Clufetos does not try to sound like himself, matter of fact, if I had closed my eyes, I could have sworn it was Bill Ward, except on the unbelievably long drum solo (FFS; do they still play those ??!!)\n\nEditing is very old school, which I loved. The picture is sharp and clear. The terrific lighting that doesn't interfere with the filming at last; which used to be a problem with old concert footage. The Picture is excellent for a standard dvd, averaging almost 8.5 Mb/sec, and I highlight the fact because nowadays most labels put a terrific Blu-Ray release and at the same time an incredibly poor afterthought of an SD DVD.\n\nSound : loud and clear LPCM and DD 5.1 streams with a great mix except perhaps for the drums, which, if of incredible presence, are tuned very low, which made my sub -that is crossed at 90 Hz for punch- produce very deep bass but not the punch I had expected. Anyway, I think this was made purposefully to achieve a more \u00a8stoner\u00a8, detuned sound, that gets better and better as the show progresses. Iommi's guitar, if a bit echoey courtesy of the acoustics of the particular venue, is on top of it all as every metal band should feature. I loved Ozzy's voice, which was too good to be true due to the very evident use of Pro Tools in the post production; I will take a good-sounding, doctored DVD over a raw, bad sounding one on any given day, because concert dvd are products that recreate the gig at home, and they have to sound good.\n\nAt the risk of sounding clich\u00e9d, this is a must-have dvd together with the \u00a8Never Say Die\u00a8 one.\n\nOriginally written for amazon.com by yours truly.\n",
        "\nWho wouldn't have seen it coming? Black Sabbath was a thing of the past, as most of their best albums were concentrated heavily in the early-to-mid 1970s, with a few gems sprinkled sparsely throughout the remainder of their career. Yet after eighteen years without releasing an album, Tony Iommi reunited with Geezer Butler and Ozzy for one last hurrah. The year was 2013, and the album was titled 13. Could not the forefathers of all metal be slightly more creative? Apparently not.\n\nThe first problem with this album is the band's inability to change. Yes, they are most respected for their earlier sound; but Ozzy Osbourne had departed as vocalist in 1979 and the following series of albums wildly branched off from what seemed to be the group's original intent. In terms of what metal had to offer in the late '70s and early '80s, Osbourne's solo project was nearly on the total opposite side of the spectrum from his first few albums with Black Sabbath. So the fact that they would reunite only to record what sounds like a bad attempt at a second Master of Reality is disappointing at best. Were Iommi and Butler (the chief songwriters of the band) unaware that an immeasurable quantity of bands had already mimicked, and occasionally even improved upon, their sound? It appears they were completely oblivious to the further development and progression of the doom metal genre after they exited its spotlight. Many of the riffs here are not really ripped straight from their own early discography but were undoubtedly used countless times by other, more recent bands.\n\nNext issue: The overall sound of the album. The guitars sound fake, for starters. I don't know if Iommi was playing through a simulated amp or not, but it sure sounds like it. They have an unusually twangy sound, with an annoying emphasis on the high end. And Ozzy... sigh. I think he's auto-tuned, to tell the truth. He's way too on-key and precise for someone that can't maintain his voice for an entire concert. The vocals all over 13 have this odd robotic effect, giving the whole thing away.\n\nThe riffs are boring and uncreative, and each one is repeated far too many times. Trying harder than ever to maintain a slow tempo and a doomy atmosphere, Black Sabbath created an album of eight songs with virtually none that really are distinguishable from the others; the exception would be the quiet and solemn (yet still not fantastic) \"Zeitgeist,\" which seems to be an homage to earlier works like \"Planet Caravan.\" In fact, it's when Iommi switches from high-gain to clean channel that the album's best moments really shine through, particularly on \"God Is Dead?\" and \"Loner.\" Brad Wilk, most notably from Rage Against the Machine, does spice the album up a little bit with his drum parts.\n\nI would not call 13 a good album, nor would I recommend it for nearly any reason. In fact, I think Black Sabbath's legacy would have done just as well without such an album. The riffs come off as pretentious and contrived after so long, and the digital enhancement does no favors to the legendary band's sound. Overall, it's a throwaway with only a few worthwhile moments, and not even one fully great song.\n",
        "\nMore often than not, most mainstream Black Sabbath fans all over the globe are typically reverent of their 70's albums with Ozzy Osbourne. Albums like Paranoid and Master of Reality and even Sabbath Bloody Sabbath and Sabotage are paraded around as being the pinnacle of Sabbath's large discography, being called masterpieces and even being portrayed as some of the best albums of all time. While yes, it is certainly true that the aforementioned releases are great in their own right, being instrumental to the creation of metal, the ones putting them up on this high pedestal tend to be quite ignorant. While many have perhaps explored the Ronnie James Dio albums a smidgen, most don't dare to go past Mob Rules or even Sabotage. This has lead to many missing out on some of Sabbath's greatest releases like Tyr, Seventh Star, and the album being reviewed here, the mighty Headless Cross.\n\nFor starters, the cast of musicians for this album is simply phenomenal. As this is a Black Sabbath release, Tony Iommi is, of course, present, once again showing that he has not slowed down in creating crafty and crushing riffs. The ever-underrated Tony Martin, who may just be Black Sabbath's best vocalist, is also back, delivering a hard rocking and gritty performance. And of course, the lineup would not be complete without drummer Cozy Powell, who lays down a powerful and monolithic drum track on Headless Cross. Geoff Nichols also returns, adding cool and atmospheric keyboard parts whenever they are needed. There's also a bassist here named Laurence Cottle; he plays simple but classy bass-lines that mainly just go with the riffs played by Iommi. However, a great lineup such as this one doesn't always mean great music. Even other Sabbath albums like Born Again or Never Say Die did not fare as well musically despite their respective lineups. Thankfully, this did not turn out to be the case with this opus.\n\nLuckily, Headless Cross manages to be an extremely atmospheric and robust album, despite being only 7 actual songs. Starting off the album after the intro is the riffy, mid-paced title track. Sporting both epic verses and a grand chorus, it is no surprise that this manages to be one of the best songs Black Sabbath has ever crafted. Directly following this is the upbeat and synthy \"Devil and Daughter\", in which the band practically melts the listener's face off with its gallantry and might. \"When Deaths Calls\" is yet another highlight of the record, with its soft intro and eventual shift into more glorious riffing and speed. Brian May of Queen also contributes a memorable yet simple solo on this song, which is also one of the standout moments of the album. Similar to this, the closing track \"Nightwing\" yet another shining example of the more epic style Black Sabbath went for with Headless Cross, with the whole song being rather bombastic and dramatic in delivery, much like the rest of the record. Every song is incredibly riffy, many being influenced by 80's rock, which may be a turn off for some (the production is also kind of 80's sounding, which does make the album seem somewhat dated). Nevertheless, all songs are worth listening to; there are none that can be skipped or be construed as filler.\n\nLyrically, most songs are about Satan and whatnot. While yes, this does sound contrived and typical for a band so often regarded as being \"evil\" by the mainstream, this is their only album that I'm aware of that just pretty much has a direct focus on Satan, with their other albums being more focused on real life subjects, drugs and fantasy. The devilish lyrics also greatly go along with the actual songwriting present on the album, which is certainly welcome.\n\nBlack Sabbath never managed to make an album better than Headless Cross either before or after it. Though albums like Dehumanizer and Master of Reality do come rather close, they simply do not manage to overcome Headless Cross in sheer battery and boldness. Since it is now known that Tony Iommi is reproducing and reissuing the much maligned Forbidden album, hopefully the rest of the Tony Martin era albums besides the Eternal Idol and now Forbidden can be reissued. There is far too much remarkable material on the albums with Tony Martin for them to be neglected. Hopefully Headless Cross and the other Martin albums can be reissued soon, for everyone's benefit.\n",
        "\nIt was all so unlikely... How the four members of Black Sabbath even got together is a tale hard to believe, since four less similar people would have been difficult to find. When Ozzy Osbourne first turned up on Geezer Butler's doorstep, he was a skinhead wearing no shoes and dragging a boot on a piece of string, while Geezer was a hippy guitarist. When the two were in a local band called Rare Breed, they hoped to pinch a drummer from the recently split-up Mythology, but ended up with the (admittedly skilled) guitarist being dragged into the picture as the pair refused to part. The drummer was Bill Ward and the guitarist was Tony Iommi, a man who, no more than six years earlier, had been Ozzy's secondary school bully. Unlikely though the alliance seemed, the quartet (slimmed down from a sextet by two shambolic performances as The Polka Tulk Blues Band) managed to land a slot as a regular club band in Germany thanks to their manager Jim Simpson. For budding musicians like Ozzy and Geezer who had grown up idolising The Beatles, playing the same Star Club where their heroes had cut their teeth was at once a victory and a challenge. Performing four sets a night without almost a speck of original material was tough going at first, not least for Tony, whose endurance was tested by the heavy jamming that the group used to fill the time, as well as the plastic caps that he wore on two fingers of his right hand, the fretting hand for a left-handed guitarist.\n\nTony Iommi's damaged fingers, nevertheless, may just be the reason that Black Sabbath has become the album celebrated as the advent of heavy metal. Why is this heavy metal when none before it was? Tragic irony aside (the accident happened at a sheet metal factory), the injury led to Iommi changing his technique and using lighter guitar strings, adding a unique edge to his playing style. It didn't make him better than others, perhaps, but certainly different. Remember that Geezer was a hippy guitarist? When Tony was introduced to the band, Geezer was shunted sideways onto bass, but didn't even have a bass guitar to rehearse on at first, meaning that he played the four strings in the same way he had been playing six, following Iommi's blues riffs and thickening the tone of the guitar as a result. The technique was lifted from Cream's Jack Bruce, turning an already heavy blues sound into an even heavier one. Finally, Geezer bent his bass notes, giving an ominous twist to the heaviness. Nowhere is this more obvious than on the song that birthed metal. A riff originally brought in from some bass jamming, the simplicity of the creaking tritone is in stark contrast to every other song released in 1970 - 'Black Sabbath' is bold, deadly intent without a hint of skill or musical freedom. The raw, knife-edge tension and unexpected lyrics, the sheer horror of Ozzy's wavering voice, the idiotically simple toms that Bill rumbles around each verse - even the title of the song itself - exhibit a departure not only from the music that prevailed in the late '60s but even the contemporary conception of what music should be. It's little surprise that the band named themselves after the song.\n\nBut of course, the title track of Black Sabbath is the exception to the majority of the album, while it doesn't even retain its sense of otherness from start to finish, Tony's brief solo at the close acting as a very accurate marker of the year of recording. And, in fact, the whole Black Sabbath album wasn't meant to end up the way it did. In the first place, Black Sabbath didn't aim to sound like they did: it was simply a matter of circumstances conspiring to form the record. Almost the only thing they agreed on was that they wanted to sound like Led Zeppelin, yet there is no sense of Zeppelin's majesty to any of the songs on this debut, just workmanlike heavy blues spiced up by flashy guitar solos and a vocalist who is either a stroke of genius or a stroke victim depending on your point of view. Much of the direction for the album can be attributed to the record companies Sabbath consorted with, as well as an engineer named Rodger Bain, for whom posterity should be more thankful. Regarding the record companies, the song 'Evil Woman' was suggested to the band by Fontana, who had signed Sabbath for one single. Everyone, particularly Tony and Geezer, hated the idea and wouldn't have recorded it without serious persuasion. Even so, the guitar-oriented sound of the cover is catchy chart rock that fits in among the looser original material without too much problem. The opposite issue arises with the album's other cover song: a monstrous 10 minute version of 'Warning', originally a three minute song by Aynsley Dunbar's Retaliation, but in the hands of Sabbath a vehicle for jamming in the most unrestrained style they would ever record to a full-length. Having developed 'Warning' when playing the Star Club's marathon shows, Sabbath actually recorded 48 minutes of instrumental tomfoolery for the track while in the studio. Imagine Black Sabbath without 'Evil Woman' (or 'Wicked World', depending on the version) and with a mammoth closing song - would the words Pink Floyd not resonate more than heavy metal?\n\nA band schooled on the endless jamming of the late-'60s were fortunate to have written 'Black Sabbath' in such sharp, raw fashion, but Rodger Bain is responsible for ordering the rest of the recording into the shape that we know today. Don't overlook the fact that the material laid down for 'Warning' alone was longer than the eventual LP in its entirety. The process of editing down the basic recordings took Bain a whole day, during which he clipped 'Warning' back into line, added the sound of storm, rain, and tolling bells to the opening of the title track, and even took pains to make the ending of side A ('N.I.B.' rounded out the original vinyl's first side) exactly the same as the closing crash of sound on 'Warning'. Thus what we hear on Black Sabbath owes a lot to the engineer's presence of mind, both in countering the disorganized improvisation that the band thought appropriate and also in giving the album a weighty punch that would mark the border between hard rock and heavy metal. However, a debt to the record company must also be acknowledged, since Vertigo may have unknowingly provided the most important touches. A new label at the time, and one founded to release the newly popular \"album-oriented\" rock music of the day, Vertigo jumped at the chance to release the record seeing as Sabbath had already recorded it, making it extremely cheap business for the label. Someone in the Vertigo offices was clearly a creative thinker and, identifying the satanic themes of the title track and 'N.I.B.', included an eerily gothic poem within an inverted cross on the inside of the gatefold cover. Considering that Ozzy was expecting the album cover to depict a photo of the band members, the creepy figure in black was another aesthetic step away from all that '60s rock represented and towards something new and darker.\n\nThe presentation of Black Sabbath may well have been contrary to the group's expectations, but the result was electric. The quartet was a bunch of mismatched freaks with one masterstroke of dumb luck in the song that gave them their name and also in the outsized crucifixes that Geezer had made them wear after the brush with the devil that 'Black Sabbath' details. Without Bain's intro to that song and careful editing, without Vertigo's creative marketing (the release date of Friday 13th February didn't pick itself), and without the uniformity of dark themes and sounds assured by Tony's crippled fingers and such covers as 'Evil Woman' and 'Warning', Black Sabbath would have amounted to little. The title track would have aroused interest for a while, but, musically speaking, Black Sabbath was nothing special. It's useless arguing that the musicians were virtuosos or ahead of their time, because they were very much of their time. Bill's drumming was unusual, taking influence from Gene Krupa and American jazz of the '40s, while Tony was skilled enough as a guitarist to be asked to join Jethro Tull - a role he rejected even before Black Sabbath had written their most important tune and changed their name from Earth. However, nothing about the musicianship on Black Sabbath suggests excellence. The climaxes that the three instrumentalists bring 'N.I.B.' and 'Warning' to are skilful but conventional, using more rhythmic rock trickery on Bill's part than anything discernibly fresh for 1970, though one can see how this would have excited live audiences. The same goes for the rumbling heaviness of some of the older cuts, since 'The Wizard' and especially 'Evil Woman' sound merely like blues songs from the days when the band was Earth. Just consider how 'The Wizard' uses harmonica as a lead instrument: it fits the song, yet it has never been a partner for heavy metal. To some extent, 'N.I.B.' is not a great deal more particular in its riffing style, though the lyrics and Ozzy's mesmerizing slow break give it a certain aura, which is also true of the slow darkness exhibited on 'Behind the Wall of Sleep' and 'Sleeping Village', which is arguably a purpose-built introduction for the gloomy and oppressive verses of 'Warning'.\n\nViewed through modern eyes, the features listed above make Black Sabbath a horrible mess and a decidedly unexceptional album. As rock music, the plainness of some of the riffing is unfortunate, while the idea of dragging the songs 'N.I.B.' and 'The Wizard' through so many verses was not conducive to listening pleasure, a criticism that 'Black Sabbath' only escapes by maintaining tension until the final denouement. That plainness is happily ameliorated by the inventiveness of the drumming during some of those songs, as well as the contrast between the rockier numbers and the more atmospheric ones, of which 'Behind the Wall of Sleep' comes off as by far the most deserving but least appreciated. On the other hand, where musicality grows unrestrained, such as during 'Warning', Tony's soloing becomes repetitive and annoying, since it really is just showing off and sounds paltry compared to what Eddie van Halen would be able to do less than a decade later. There are some inspired moments scattered about, such as the riff beginning at 5:15 of 'Warning' that Cathedral would spend a whole career replicating, as well as Bill's ability to play around the riff in 'The Wizard' and the gentle touch of the vocals in 'Sleeping Village'. This last detail highlights how Ozzy's voice undeniably suited the slow parts much better than the upbeat ones, sounding miserable during 'Evil Woman' and even the verses of 'N.I.B.', which perhaps pushed the band further into the dark and slow direction that dominated by Master of Reality. The parts of Black Sabbath where the combined effect of the instrumentalists and singer shows the full potential of the sound add up to under 15 minutes of the 38 minute album. Nevertheless, those parts are sometimes very special, which is why this album is still being talked about nearly 50 years after it was made.\n\nUltimately, Black Sabbath has become a legend in heavy metal, the popular perception of the album a greatly distorted version of what it really is and what it was meant to be. As a late '60s rock album, it is slightly irritating and of average quality, while as a modern heavy metal album it fails to meet most of the criteria that we consider essential to the genre. If the band had written and recorded it the way they had imagined, it would have almost certainly been forgotten among other second-string groups of the day, though the additional steering of the engineer and label staff served to highlight that there was the spark of something different here, which was further developed by Black Sabbath over the following couple of years. Still, there have been few songs to capture the same essence as 'Black Sabbath' ever since its inspiration crept through from the other side. And without that song...chances are you wouldn't be reading this review on this website. It was all so unlikely...\n",
        "\nI always owned Never Say Die, but aside from one or two tracks given lip service, I never really gave it a thorough listen. I know you aren't supposed to let dodgy reputations keep one from listening to/enjoying an album, but that oblong album cover, combined with the fact that none of this stuff was ever played live after its mother tour didn't make Never Say Die very inviting.\n\nMartin Popoff has claimed that Never Say Die was \"more of a work of art than Heaven & Hell\" because it was the perfect picture of a band completely falling apart. A snapshot of an unmitigated disaster so perfectly realized that it needs to be displayed for all to see. A \"so bad it's good\" album if you will. Sorry Marty, but reality TV, The Room, and those fucking shark movies sucked then and they suck now, and I don't care what the meta-text of an album is, if its bad, its bad.\n\nI will say that the circumstances that brought this album to light to bring up some interesting straw-man killing fires. In the spirit of \"Why couldn't Bon Scott sing on Back In Black,\" I'm sure Ozzy purists have whinged for a generation why it wasn't he who could have sung Children of the Sea and Heaven & Hell. But unlike Bonny being dead before ringing Hells Bells, the answer is a very simple: because Ozzy refused to sing them. Sabbath had written a large chunk of material while Ozzy pursued a solo career before being officially shit-canned, and in a strange diva-esque moment refused to sing any of what they had written. Matter of fact the band was simply so unable to re-write the album that some of those tracks just ended up on the album without Ozzy. Now, you know why Bill has lead vocals on Swinging the Chain (as opposed to certain looneys thinking he had a breakout performance with \"It's Alright\"). As for vice-versa, well Dio couldn't handle Sweet Leaf for very long on the Heaven & Hell tour (and standard opener Symptom of the Universe wasn't even touched), so I'm doubtful of his attempt to tackle notes that I'm sure Ozzy himself knows he won't be hitting for much longer.\n\nI guess how bad Never Say Die is depends on what you're expectations are going in. If you are looking for a 1978 hard rock album, it still falls short of Van Halen, Stained Class, Hemispheres, Powerage and Long Live Rock & Roll, but you know what, it still rocks. There are plenty of solid songs and great riffs that if they were written by any other band, a hessian would find them perfectly acceptable. Status Quo fans in particular would swear A Hard Road escaped Shawshank Redemption style from the If You Can't Stand The Heat sessions. If you are looking for the dark, menacing outfit that brought you the wicked tales from the crypt such as War Pigs, Black Sabbath, Children of The Grave and Megalomania, you are up Rick James creek without neither crack pipe nor Charlie Murphy.\n\nStill, I'd be lying if I said this album didn't have it's moments (that Hard Road riff being one of them), most of them being in the first half of the album. I was rather shocked how well Johnny Blade held up when I revisited the album in full. If there's any song that could have gone on any of the classic Sabbath albums, it's this one. With a rolling snare drum rhythm as its backbone (Bill Ward is a diamond on this song), and a strange keyboard roll for atmosphere, Johnny Blade is a harrowing, if slightly cliched peek into gang culture. If this was on Technical Ecstasy, it would have been an improvement. Hell, this probably could have made Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath without too much of an issue. By the way, anyone who thinks this song has anything to do with glam metal is a damn fool. Glam metal is 4/4 hard rock with way too much swing, pop and femininity. This is nothing of the sort. I remember in one of those \"Sabbath invented every genre of metal\" articles someone tried to make the claim they invented hair metal with Dirty Women. Granted they were wrong there too, but at least they were close there with lyrical similarities.\n\nThe general sound of Never Say Die is clear enough regarding individual instruments. Sensibly, Black Sabbath albums live and die on Iommi's guitar tone but unfortunately we're still stuck in this strange, sterile 70s sound that hampered Technical Ecstasy (and Heaven & Hell for that matter). This is Ozzy's voice is also starting to deteriorate, showing shades of the almost whiny wail we're used to on the first few Ozzy solo albums. Bill, in spite of the band collapsing all around him, sounds the most inspired he's been in years, dolling out swings, rolls and fills to envy (see the aforementioned Johnny Blade and Junior's Eyes for the standout performances).\n\nNow, how bad does the album get? Again, it depends on your expectations. Some listeners might think Sabbath was already down the shitter when they tuned the guitars back up to standard after a four album downtuned grand slam. So maybe the first notes of the title track signal the ear AIDS. But the tracks that are just post Thanksgiving chores after to get through are Breakout and Air Dance. Breakout is a dull instrumental based around an even duller riff with a saxophone soloing aimlessly over it. Yes, a saxophone, and the whole thing sounds like an 80's sitcom theme. I don't care where you are on the rock spectrum, no self-respecting band should be sounding like a sitcom (for an example of the saxophone done right in metal, go look up Necromantia's Scarlet Evil Witching Black). Air Dance starts like a throwaway track before descending into some really bizarre lounge sweet. You know how everyone tells you Fear Is The Key is a terrible song, then you listen to it anyway for curiosity, hear that awesome riff and wonder what the hell is wrong with everyone, only to be blindsided by that beyond dumb \"lies and lies and lies\" bridge? That's what Air Dance is, without the awesome riff at the beginning. Then there are just stupid little moments throughout the album that were thrown in out of desperation at Luke's Wall in the hopes they would stick, but end up sabotaging the song. The flourishing piano licks in Over To You; the ooo ooos in Shock Wave; the pathetically sung \"don't you ever say die\" in the bridge of the title track. Even the \"why make a hard road, why can't we be friends\" backing vocals in A Hard Road keeps me from giving that one full marks. There's also the overall feeling that this has just all been done before, and not in the fun \"so what, let's do it again\" Motorhead way.\n\nNever Say Die was where something had to give. Fortunately it was Ozzy, and we got two great bands instead of one tired band. Everyone could agree and enjoy Blizzard of Ozz and Heaven & Hell with equal admiration and respect, with no bickering or line-drawing for decades to come. Approach with extreme caution. Or don't, and best let popular consensus think it was Shigeru Miyamoto who invented that iconic triangle design.\n",
        "\nIt is completely unpleasant to me writing this review. First of all, because I made a strong statement myself: Never to review Black Sabbath before reviewing at least 100 albums. I don't know why I took that stand, but anyway. As I went to the record-store, I found this thing and the poor impression it left me forced to break that status quo.\n\nThis line-up features three of our all-time favourite guys doing their metal thing: Uncle Ozzy, that non-gifted singer but with such charm and gusto for the stoner stuff. Tony Iommi, the man himself of metal and Geezer the Beer Wizard Butler, an underated bassist, as heavy as your sexy sister listening to Coldplay while having sex with that nasty boyfriend of hers. Yeah, a total badass Mr. Butler is: a genius. \n\nBut among those three major names, a dude was added to parasite the sacred cow from inside out and weakening the whole digestive system of the organism: Brad Wilk. Hey, don't you lie on us, we all know that this guy is actually Angelo Sasso, that nice friend of our Rock and Rolf uncle, the mythic drummer made of transistors and energized by electromagnetic impulses. Now, you may believe that he was a real human being, with flesh, bones and blood. I can say to you \"that's ok, if you think someone with flesh and bones can be so DEAD while playing the drums in Black Sabbath\". God bless Vinny Appice and Bill Ward, to say the least, we are terribly sorry for this.\n\nFirst of all, I think there is a strong agreement that Dio was far better in the vocals than Ozzy. Yes, right. But we all missed the classical growling style of uncle Oz doing his stuff a-la-early doom. Sabbath Bloody Sabbath comes strong in our minds, we fall into that and we play joyful stuff on and on. Lots of black magic here, there, everywhere. The guys from Birmingham were just simply more than what we could believe. Majestic. Now, we fall into this trap named \"13\" -add the albums made by Ozzy with those by Dio, including \"The Devil You Know\" and you get a number- and our face plunges down to the floor. What is it? Was it this for real, or just a crazy dream ? \n\nThat same 2013, Deep Purple, the other band that created heavy metal, released its album \"Now What?!\" and, somehow, nobody in the metal scene seems to noted it. Despite of that, the guys led by Morse (yeah, Steve Morse, because he was the lead in that album, finally they forgot about Blackmore) manage to create an album which chooses to be within the first category. Reinvention, with a feeling of deep respect with the ancent and forgone glory days. But something of its own, with a pure essence and magic. With an own personality. Somehow, a great album of \"the other band that created metal\" went completely unnoticed by the metal audience. Only my review there, after several weeks of release.\n\nBlack Sabbath has chosen the second way of \"harvesting from the past\". The coward way. And I really hate to say that, since Tony Iommi is a god for me, I have a picture of him, in the 80's, with his guitar, sticked to the main wall of my bedroom, alongside my poster of Ritchie Blackmore. But yes, they chose the \"coward\" way, the second. With Ozzy, completely out of shape for singing (he isn't precisely the most gifted vocal performer but at least, in his glory days, could manage to be in tone, in the line) and Angelo Sasso playing the drums here (I refuse to believe there was a human drumming here, it was a machine or they borrowed from the nether-realm Running Wild's legendary boy), there was not much to expect. Only Iommi could have saved this, but get this: instead of punching us in the face with his riffs, he keeps on looting and faking everything he could from his albums in the 70's.\n\nYeah, you can say \"well, many people does that kind of things, even Iommi can...\" and I can kick you in the face, dropping out one of your rancid teeth. Iommi, the metal god himself, doing self plagiarism! I thought I would have died before seeing -or listening, as matter fact- that. \n\nOne can think about many theories here. Maybe Dio put a spell on Iommi before his death, maybe Tony is just trying to pull our strings as much as possible to see how loyal we are to his music. Maybe being close to someone who was so close to Lars Ulrich can infect you with laxness of creativity, maybe Rubin itself injected into Iommi's blood (while he was sleeping) some scar tissues of Hammett, making our favourite guitar-riffer losing his power. Maybe this is a conspiracy led by that zionist Digital Bitch that turned Ozzy into her drone... Maybe... Maybe... Maybe...\n\nBut I think about this possibility and in my humble opinion, is the most logical one: maybe they just went into the studio for the total sake of money-making and with no clue, not even a hint on how to do a new album. Therefore, they did the basic: they went the coward way, imitating what they have done before, doing it intentionally kinda-atmospheric dark and throwing it to the sales market to get the fresh coins over the table. Yeah, that's it. They just entered the studio, they just copied a couple of things from a long time ago and there you go: RIAA Platinum.\n\nTo talk about the songs is to inflict ourselves more pain than what is needed. But we should? Anyway, let's just start...\n\nFrom the very first second, when I heard the single \"God is Dead\", I detected some evil -and I'm not talking about Lucifer, that's our friend- lurking into the magic realms of the Black Sabbath. Something was just so tame, so squared and fitted to sound this way. Too flat and simple. Of course, those chords at the beginning are so doooooooooom, so daaaaaaaark, so mooooooooody. Yes, pal. And so boring. So \"I've heard this thing before but way more gutsy\". Then, the blast: OMG... METALLICA!!\n\nYeah, that's what I thought. Are we listening something from BS? Really? Well, this single almost blew my mind away, in a bad way. Ozzy singing this, with no passion, no magic... \n\nAfter that impression, I cherished myself with a thought: \"no, it's just an illusion, like everything in human reality. Tony is playing tricks with our minds, as usual\".\n\nWell, it wasn't an ilussion: the album just gets worst by every listen you give to it.\n\n\"End of the Beginning\" tries to emulate that song we all know and cheer, written by Black Sabbath in the album Black Sabbath and entitled \"Black Sabbath\". In every aspect, yeah, every one. It has nothing new, it has nothing mystic nor esoteric there. It's plain plagiarism but with 40 years of decadence. 40 years of Ozzy's voice getting duller and duller. And no magic moment from Iommi, only Geezer being solid from behind. And Angelo Sasso, of course, pure magic this guy!\n\nI closed my eyes and my ears for a moment. But I was starting to listen \"Loner\" and some hope slided in my mind. Maybe if we can forget Ozzy and his miserable non-singing here and maybe if Angelo Sasso was more erratic, more human, this piece could have evolved in something respectable. But no. Ozzy sings like me in the bathroom, but with no shame and this drummer KICKS EVERYONE'S ASS! The self-plagiarism is way too obvious here and Iommi just can't excite us enough with a timid solo, that's pretty much of it. And, get this, I'm saying that this song is one of the good ones of the album! So, this album is crap, no doubt about it.\n\nWe all heard about \"Planet Caravan\", about \"Stonehenge\" and some other pieces like \"Zeitgeist\" before, in BS's large catalog. Well, this song is not entirely wrong in the strict sense of \"reaching your head\". It does, it goes well. But lacks the feeling, the thing goes way too one-sided, linear, single-functional. The song is enjoyable, of course, if we forget that it was written by Iommi and friends. You can even play this in a night at a beach in Santa Monica or Biarritz, if you are in Europe. Or in Copacabana. Light a fire, get your guitar, sing along some pretty ladies and they will admire your talent, they'll say to you \"oh, that's such a lovely song, is it from Bruno Mars?\". \"No, dear ladies, this thing is from Black Sabbath\". \"What? You loser, Sabbath has balls, this thing is from Bruno Mars\".\n\nSasso tries to turn himself into a real entient for a moment, when \"Age of Reason\" starts. Geezer Butler does the magic later, the thing climbs some hills and this song actually rocks. But, hey, when you take a deeper listen here, you figure out that our drummer keeps on doing the same thing for about seven minutes, excluding the necessary shifting moments in the bridges and in the solo, if we can call that a solo, coming from Iommi. In the slow moment of the song, Metallica's shadow appears again... But suddenly, the thing shifts a little bit and returns to the Sasso pattern. Iommi tries to save what was a promising song in his last solo, he achieves some points, but everything goes hollow again, there is no magic here. I'm not listening to Iommi and that's painful.\n\n\"Live Forever\" is an attempt to \"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\" us all, with some touches of \"Master of Reality\" but with no spirit. There are lots of good ideas in the mood of classic doom. But just without balls, without the courage needed to explore them all and getting an answer. And Ozzy gets more and more annoying as the song goes by. Iommi tries hard to be Iommi, but he can't. Or he just don't want to? Oh, please, ged rid of Ozzy NOW. And of Angelo Sasso. Have you heard about this song of Metallica: \"2x4\" in the Load album? Take a listen and compare it with some parts of \"Live Forever\". \n\nTrying to save the panorama, Iommi takes full charge at \"Damaged Souls\" and \"Dear Father\". In the former, Ozzy also does better, at least he sticks into the tone and drives the lyrics to a respectable end, while surrounded by Iommi's solo, by far the finest here -without being impressive-. That harmonica also brings to us, at least once in this crap of an album, some fond and magic memories... The guitar solo tries hard and for a moment, you say loud and clear \"hey, this is Iommi\". The doomy atmosphere is strong and sounds natural, not \"forced\", comes along the beat. Does just great, good. Regular, acceptable. And being \"regular and acceptable\" is unacceptable in Black Sabbath. In the latter, Sabbath finally reminds how to full-throttle the thing. It is not close of being a masterpiece, but gets somehow close. After a long torture, this couple of songs gives to us some final and little rejoice. \"Dear Father\" starts moderato, grows bigger, gets faster, beats a lot -without a proper riff, mind you, only a mediocrity by Iommi- and finishes with the album trying to leitmotif-us with a famous sound of a bell... And a rainy environment... I just can't say anymore. \n\nThat's enough for me writing about the songs in this album. \n\nThe only player up to his responsablity here was Geezer. Ozzy just... Can't be fixed. Iommi wasn't Iommi and Angelo Sasso is a legend (as this Sabbath drummer will become one, believe me). But Mr. Butler stood tall, doing some nasty things with his bass. Listen to \"Loner\" for instance. It may trick on you with that bluesy rythm, but Geezer is going way beyond there. Take a deep listen to \"Age of Reason\" and \"Dear Father\" and you will find a glorious Geezer doin' his thing and doing it right. As it should, in a BS album. Geezer Butler, such a good chap.\n\nOh god, even the quality sound production just makes this thing worst. And remember, ladies, Rick Rubin was a good pal of those guys in Metallica, so nothing good can be taken from his influence. Enough said.\n\nAnyway, for finishing this painful review: if you like and appreciate the ballsy way of looking through the past but with a macho attitude, go and get the nice album released by Deep Purple this same year (have you heard of it?). Maybe not that metal, but much more brave than this coward and inspiration-less thing, created for the pure sake of sacking and plundering our precious bodily fluids and money. And if this is the end of Black Sabbath, what a sad finish... I hope they'll vindicate themselves.\n",
        "\nSo this is it; the last officially released Sabbath music ever, only available to the lucky fans who attended their final world tour. It contains four live tracks, preceded by four outtakes from the 13 recording sessions. While it does seem fit to honor the dedicated fans who saw the band's end, there seems to be a lack of finality about this \"EP\" (the actual run length is over 54 minutes, much longer than most EPs); it's by no means an outstanding release, nor does it provide good closure for the nearly five decades of metal pioneering that Black Sabbath brought to the world.\n\nThe fact of the matter is, the first half of this CD is comprised entirely of studio outtakes, suggesting they were deemed unworthy for release on 13, which in my opinion is a decent album at best. While a couple of these tracks do shine through, the other two are mostly stale and repetitively reflective on the rest of the material the wrote around the same time.\n\nOne of the better of the new songs, opener \"Season of the Dead\" features a percussive main riff from Iommi, accompanied by Ozzy's classic haunting vocal melodies. \"Take Me Home\" is of similar quality, with emotionally motivated vocal performance and a beautifully written classical guitar solo. While \"Cry All Night\" can be enjoyable at times, it and closing song \"Isolated Man\" for the most part fail to hit the mark. Throughout the EP, Geezer Butler drives the music with his signature tone and quick bass fills, greatly improving on Iommi's regular repetition of the same riffs 32 times in a row. On the downside, Bill Ward doesn't make an appearance here, instead replaced by Rage Against the Machine drummer Brad Wilk. Although Wilk is undoubtedly a capable drummer, I miss the jazzy passages Ward delivered on the earlier albums, which would've added a better finishing touch to The End.\n\nThis is by no means a bad or inconsistent record. It's interesting, and it does feel special to be included in such a small number of fans who are able to own it. Only half of the new songs are thoroughly good, but that doesn't mean the rest isn't entertaining. The four live tracks are sort of useless, considering they're from the previous tour and all of them were also performed at the respective concerts at which the EP was to be purchased. So in other words: if you own this, great. If you don't, good luck finding it anywhere!\n",
        "\nSabbath with Tony Martin means basically one thing: power metal \u2013 modulated, of course, by Iommi\u2019s doomy twist to it. I hold that to be true from this album (the first with the new headman) all the way down to at least Cross Purposes (and perhaps even Forbidden, the most obscure of all?), though this particular aspect of it probably peaks with Tyr (1992). It is remarkable, in passing, that with five albums, this is the bands second-longest enduring singer (nevermind the rest of the lineup). It is indeed astonishing, when you think of it, how such an inexperienced bloke could just be lifted into the heaven (or hell, rather) of heavy metal music, out of nowhere, and, alas, deliver. After all, having had the inimitable Ozzy (marvellous in his sonic weirdness, his Joplin-like looks and hand-clapping joyfulness, belonging firmly in the seventies), the amazing Dio (surely their most consistent frontman, and the one I happen to admire the most for all he has said and sung) and long-standing star, master Gillan - not to mention that unbelievable screamer, Glenn Hughes (sadly troubled and adrift during and after the making of Seventh Star) \u2013 after all this, I was saying, one doesn\u2019t really expect Iommi\u2019s riffs to fit in that well with yet another vocal approach, and especially one nobody\u2019s heard of before. And yet\u2026\n\nSo that\u2019s the first thing: you\u2019re in for some more epic vocals here. Secondly, there\u2019s the heavy use of keyboards (courtesy of Geoff Nichols), which, together with the vocals, means there\u2019s a lot of atmosphere to these songs. It comes as no surprise then that, thirdly, at least some of the themes are of a more epic kind, of which \u2018Ancient Warrior\u2019 \u2013 rather a dull title (but heavy metal is too often fond of clich\u00e9s anyway) \u2013 is surely the best example.\n\nIn spite of this overall coherence in tone, so to put it, this makes for quite a varied experience. You\u2019ll have outright rockers such as \u2018Hard Life to Love\u2019 and \u2018Born to Lose\u2019, with its unusually catchy chorus (plus the rather unremarkable \u2018Lost Forever\u2019), as well as slower, more epic tunes like \u2018Ancient Warrior\u2019. \u2018The Shining\u2019 itself,, the opener, is a marvellous example of how a growing power-metal aesthetic here meets doom metal\u2019s minor mode harmonies and dissonant tones. In between rockers and epics, you get good blends, such as \u2018Glory Ride\u2019, with its distinctive 80s feel. \u2018Nightmare\u2019 is mid-paced march-like piece \u2013 the groove feel is irresistible \u2013 with a verse somewhat reminiscent of \u2018Lonely is the word\u2019 from the Heaven and Hell record (1980) but an overall feeling more akin to Manowar (not far from 1983\u2019s Born Again in this regard, by the way).\n\nThen at some point there\u2019s \u2018Scarlet Pimpernel\u2019. It would have been nice to see the interlude turn into a song of its own, especially as it is not organically tied to what follows (\u2018Lost Forever\u2019), except as a sort mood clearer, cooling down the ambience a bit. Indeed, it is functional as a break so you can go take a leak or what have you (good toilet music, then, if you own a medieval-themed pub: I can almost hear glasses and drunken conversation \u2013 also roasted pork comes to mind, for whatever reason \u2013 while it\u2019s playing; we don\u2019t happen to have many of those where I live). Finally, the title track (incidentally the longest, by a small margin). Not unlike the eternal classic, \u2018Black Sabbath\u2019\u2013 if somewhat more homogeneous and less dynamic in its development \u2013 it is hard to describe except as that for which Sabbath are probably best known for (name it what you will; think of the rainy tritones of said classic and Ozzy\u2019s nightmarish soliloquy, and you\u2019ll see what I mean). Only Martin is less a weird (and less a devilish) than an epic screamer: much like Johan Landquist, that other bloke-out-of-nowhere-turned-torchbearer-of-doom, in Candlemass\u2019 debut. The sense of despair, however, is nearly as powerfully conveyed by all three.\n\nIt is probably fair to say that this isn\u2019t the best from the Tony Martin era, but hell, it\u2019s pretty damn good. And since Sabbath themselves haven\u2019t cared to highlight this phase of their career, it\u2019s definitely worth a pick. This is a great piece of history, if anything. And if there\u2019s one thing admirable in the tradition of heavy metal, it\u2019s the joy with which we\u2019ll eagerly search the litters of history for unrepeatable relics. The Eternal Idol is itself a shining joy.\n",
        "\nAfter 18 years \u2013 most of it out of the spotlight \u2013 Black Sabbath was reunited (again!) and plans for a new album started to spread across the metal press. The metal community was anxiously waiting for a new Sabbath album, specially after their last effort with Forbidden, undoubtedly the worst album of any incarnation of the band. Heaven & Hell's version of Sabbath did a hell of a job on The Devil You Know, so everybody was expecting something of the same quality from the original members of Black Sabbath.\n\nBut the first disappointment came with the news of the exclusion of Bill Ward, the original drummer of the group. The matter was never really cleared, as Iommi claims that Bill wasn't in health condition to tour on a regular basis, and the drummer says he would play with the band if they showed him a \u201csignable contract\u201d. The fact is Bill was out, and Sabbath needed a drummer to do the work. Butler and Iommi had already reunited with Vinny Appice on Heaven & Hell, so everybody thought he was the next choice. But the band decided to hire Brad Wilk, ex-Rage Against The Machine, to play as session drummer. The line-up for 13 was complete.\n\nAnyone that listens to the album, will be sure of one thing: this is Black Sabbath. Iommi's slow and heavy riffs are there, Geezer's lyrics and bass are there, Ozzy's surprisingly good voice is there. But something is missing. The album sounds.. uninspired. Listening to the first songs will make any fan realize that a lot of them are identical to songs the band released in the 70's. Most of the songs on 13 have riffs or guitar parts that reminds you, or are even identical to parts of songs like Black Sabbath, N.I.B, Planet Caravan, Cornucopia, and others. The main riff on Loner is practically identical to N.I.B. All the classical moments of Iommi's guitar playing are there, but it just sounds like a repetition of what the band did in the past. It's too simple for the evolution of Tony's guitar playing over the years. If Heaven & Hell did an excellent job on The Devil You Know, sounding original and yet sounding like Dio-era Sabbath, why Sabbath didn't try a better job on 13? \n\nAs said before, Ozzy's voice is particularly good on this album. The vocalist had struggled with drug problems and eventually voice problems over his solo career, but at this venture he surely made a better job than usual. The drums, on the other hand, sound too bland for a record from a band like Sabbath. There's not a single highlight from Mr. Wilk's work. Bill Ward surely is missing on this album. \n\nThe excellent point on this album are the lyrics though. The apocalyptic atmosphere is particularly exciting, and the inspiration from Nietzsche on God is Dead has brought some attention to the complexity of Butler's writing, as other songs are very exciting as well: most of the lyrical content in the album has philosophical questions about the future (or the end) of the human race, the robotization and sadness of post-modern life, and of course.. evil. \n\nIn the end, 13 has a few good moments, but they are shadowed by the just \u201cfine\u201d instrumental work. The album did very well on the charts, reaching number 1 both in the UK and USA. But all this financial recognition didn't make it better for the listener. The band embarked on a world tour to promote the record, the last on their career, but fans are undoubtedly wishing for more. This is not the way we want to remember the last Sabbath. I sure hope they can do a second \u201clast album\u201d.\n",
        "\nThe year was 1983. Dio and Vinny Appice had left Black Sabbath almost a year before and the band was heading towards the end, with Iommi and Butler as the only members. Things were not looking good and the band was searching desperately for a new singer. When the auditions began, even Michael Bolton (the pop singer) auditioned for the position. But the two remaining members were not satisfied with the results. Sabbath was in the dark, and getting out was not gonna be easy.\n\nWhen the band changed their manager, hiring Ozzy's father-in-law Don Arden, he suggested the name of Ian Gillan for the band's vocals. Both the band and Gillan were a little reluctant about this venture, but after meting Butler and Iommi for a night of heavy drinking, the game had started: the ex-Deep Purple was in, and Sabbath had a new vocalist. Born Again was beginning to take shape.\n\nAlthough the record had success in the charts, both in the USA and UK (getting up to n\u00ba4), it wasn't as successful as the other Sabbath releases in the 70's and early 80's. It was also panned by music critics, as the mixing was too \u201cthick\u201d and raw, as opposed to the evolution in the production process of the Sabbath sound. Every album sounded better than the last, and Born Again broke this \u201cchain\u201d of evolution.\n\nBut music critics never take into account what fans want from a record, even though they are the final consumers of the product of the band's work. If you look into the reviews of Born Again made by most famous websites and magazines, you will see mostly harsh words about the sound, the band and the album cover. But if you ask the fans, the opinion is almost unanimous: the album has the classic Sabbath evil \"feeling\" in it.\n\nGillan's addition to the band gave them a different approach when it comes to songwriting: Butler and Dio's lyrics were mostly about occult and fantastic themes. On the other hand, Ian was more used to write about quotidian things: Trashed is about his car accident near the studio, while Disturbing The Priest is about the band's feud with priests who lived near by the recording site. Most of the songs deal with drinking, religion, sex, critics about modern life and the band's contempt towards Sharon Osbourne, as shown on Digital Bitch (\u201cShe's got more money than I've ever seen, but she's a greedy emotional looter\u201d).\n\nThe instrumental work is something else that drives attention: Iommi's riffs are at the top spot here, and he uses faster solos than on previous records, abusing on legato techniques and chromaticism. The \u201cthick\u201d sound of the mixing gives the guitar a \u201cdirty\u201d sound, combining perfectly with his playing style. This record sounds more \u201cevil\u201d then most Sabbath albums. The drums and bass work are also perfectly adjusted to the new sound, and the return of Bill Ward gives new energy to the band, as some of his drumming sound heavier and more inspired than ever.\n\nNow it comes to the worst and the best qualities of the record. Keep It Warm is definitely the worst song of the album, with a strange chorus and weird riffs from Iommi. It's not the worst song in the world, but it doesn't stand up to the rest of the music on the record. Gillan's voice, however, is Born Again's best feature, as it sounds more \u201cwild\u201d and \u201cevil\u201d and in any other record he has sang. Some of his screaming on Trashed and Born Again are memorable.\n\nBorn Again may not be a \u201cclassic\u201d Sabbath album, but it surely deserves to be compared to the best works of the group. Ozzy once said he believed this was the best Sabbath record after his departure. Famous musicians like Chris Barnes, Lars Ulrich and Max Cavalera cited the album as one of their favorites. The record passed the test of time, and always shows up on lists of \u201cmost wronged\u201d metal albums. It's a pity the recognition for the band's work came too late. But better late than never.\n",
        "\nThe beginning of the nineties - we all know that this was not the best time for pure and honest metal. I was therefore surprised that a more or less outdated formation came to present the true spirit. Of course, I am speaking of Black Sabbath, the inventors of heavy metal. Indeed, Cronos, you did not invent each and every form of hard music. This is just one of your Luciferian fairytales. But little Satanists aside, what do you need for a good metal album? Well, one thing is for sure. Lock the door of the studio as soon as Ozzy appears on the horizon. Ronnie James Dio (R.I.P.) is responsible for the lead vocals and I have no doubt that many people like his powerful, expressive, melodic and poignant voice. On his solo albums, he sings a lot about rainbows and further nonsense, but here we have intelligent lyrics (about hypocritical TV preachers, for example) and capturing song titles like \"Letters from Earth\" or \"Sins of the Father\". Long story short, nobody misses the croaking owl called Ozzy. But let's make an experiment, everybody who is sad that Ozzy was not involved: clap your hands!\n\nI hear nothing.\n\n\"Dehumanizer\" suffers from an artwork that every demo combo would reject, but the songs have a heavy fundament, catchy riffs and strong choruses. It goes without saying that Dio's voice gives the tunes a very mighty and unique character, but there is also a very strong liaison between pure metal and atmospheric insertions. \"After All (The Dead)\", an absolute highlight, marks the prime example in this context, because its generic yet overwhelming guitar work creates a very scary mood and the lyrics match the composition excellently. A shiver runs down my spine when I am listening to lines like \"What do you say to the dead / Is there a place where it's burning / It says in a book I once read / Yes there's a chance of returning\". I don't believe in reincarnation and I hope that the world will never be confronted with my second me, but sometimes I wish that Dio would return. Or Paul Baloff. Or... too many to mention. But let's get back to the here and now. Tracks like \"Sins of the Father\" show the majestic approach of Black Sabbath very well. A pretty calm beginning leads to a heavyweight riff-monster which offers an almost bottomless depth. And there is a big difference whether a \"normal\" vocalist or Dio sings line like \"how much longer are you gonna pay for yesterday - sins of the father\". \n\n\"Too Late\", the ballad of the full-length, does not remain behind the other tracks. Despite its pretty soft beginning, the song does not lack heaviness due to the crunchy riffs that form the second half. Now at the latest it is obvious that \"Dehumanizer\" is a jewel or maybe the jewel of Sabbath's catalogue. And therefore it is no surprise that the self-confident, stomping \"I\" and \"Buried Alive\" with its subliminally hysterical end finish the output in a very exciting manner. Both songs score with fantastic choruses that impress with their longevity and the dragging, flattening and droning guitar of \"Buried Alive\" leaves its mark as well. Dio and Iommi never forget to add a melodic touch, but it is clear for all to see (and to hear!) why this music is called heavy and not melodic metal. And this type of sometimes slow-paced, sometimes mid-paced metal is brilliantly performed. It's one of these albums where I am not able to find just one boring section. Not to mention a throwaway track. Each and every one is good or even excellent and they all paint pretty dark pictures, not at least because of the somehow pessimistic production. It is powerful, well-balanced and does not lack pressure, but it does not offer any rays of light and, just to avoid misunderstandings, that's a good thing.\n\nFrankly speaking, I have never been a supporter of Black Sabbath. I respect them for their innovative force, but the hippie look of their early years made it hard for me to like them. Not to speak of Ozzy. Okay, he is the only owl that has a legendary status and, despite his odd style of singing, a certain charisma. Nevertheless, it is impossible for me to take a dude seriously that celebrates himself for having become his own caricature. Anyway, \"Dehumanizer\" is a robust and clearly structured album, coherently designed and with a lot of substance. On the one hand, it offers a kind of traditional \"consensus metal\", on the other hand it is full of exciting moments, sections and songs. So from my point of view, this timeless document of pure art has the power to inspire millions of metalheads. Maybe you are one of them.\n",
        "\nThe story goes that Black Sabbath tried the same method to write their follow up to Volume 4: Bel-Air mansion, cocaine galore, only this time nothing happened. Then they travelled back to England and found this spooky castle and even then it took a while for the band (or rather Tony Iommi) to come up with anything. Finally, the Sabbath Bloody Sabbath riff emanated from the strings of Tony's Gibson SG, and the ideas began to flow forth.\n\nAmongst those ideas were Fluff, Who Are You, Looking For Today, and a few other oblong constructions that seem to fit the album's angelic back cover rather than the muse for demon-rape hentai of a front album cover. Given how many seemingly un-Sabbath ideas there are on this album, it's fascinating that people still include this amongst Sabbath's classic period, choosing to ignore the much heavier Sabotage over this. To be fair, I've heard anywhere from \"after the first four Sabbath albums\" to \"after Never Say Die.\" Now, in no way am I saying this album is bad, or even that all of the more unconventional ideas here are bad, just that it was pretty incredible this album allowed Ozzy to get away with singing \"lovely la-ay-ay-ay-day.\" I chalk it up to the 70s, where everyone was just more open minded and fan bitching was kept in bowels of bars and playgrounds where it was promptly marginalized the second the band came to town for a live show. I'm not really sure any band could get away with this album today, given that one simple blabbermouth comment will immediately dissuade scores of mouth breathing retards. Ignoring the cries of the fans isn't always a bad thing, folks.\n\nStill, I have to call a spade a spade, and Fluff is easily the second worst track from the Ozzy era. I can understand the occasional interlude like Orchid or Laguna Sunrise for the sake of variety, but this? This is just awful. The band America laughed this shit out of the room for being softer than melted ice-cream. Then there's Who Are You, which was written lock stock and barrel by none other than Ozzy Osborune all by himself. Of course this song also falters under scrutiny, because as nicely as that keyboard riff fits the Sabbath sound, we all can't help but wonder why the hell Tony Iommi isn't playing that riff on the guitar? He doesn't even play it as a doubling rhythm track to the keyboard, which I think would have given the song a massive boost. Spiral Architect and Looking For Today is where we start to cross into the realms of great ideas of expanding into the Black Sabbath sound. The former seems to use an acoustic guitar as it's backbone (though a proper electric riff does pop in from time to time), and Looking For Today seems to undergo an R&B diva vibe that Judas Priest would briefly embellish a bit further on the Killing Machine album. It's also worth mentioning that there's a lot of orchestra instruments on this album. Hell, Looking For Today even has a flute underneath the pre-chorus.\n\nFor better or worse, there's enough proper heavy Sabbath songs to fill up an album side. A National Acrobat, Killing Yourself To Live, Sabbra Caddabra and the absolutely nightmarish title track are just as much staples of what Black Sabbath do best alongside Children of The Grave, Iron Man, etc. Well, ok, Sabbra Caddabra is also another weird one, sounding like a lost collaboration track between Black Sabbath and Elton John, but again, that riff! One thing you might not be prepared for is Ozzy's Judas-fucking-Priest like performance in the second half of Sabbath Bloody Sabbath. I had heard most of the Sabbath classics live before the studio versions so hearing \"WHERE CAN YOU RUN TO\" erupt out of nowhere, along with everything that followed was such a gut punch. It was the first time Black Sabbath managed to scare the shit out of me. Master of Reality and Volume 4 had gotten listeners accustomed to an Ozzy Osbourne that could at the very least, last a few rounds with Robert Plant and Ian Gillan, but nobody saw this vocal performance coming. I guess the fact that Ozzy wasn't capable of performing this part live after 1974 (if he ever did that is) has preserved it like a horror movie scare that hasn't been copied and parodied in an attempt to soften the blow. Then you combine that with the song's coda, which actually sounds like the remaining ensemble is musically ripping your mind apart and sucking it into a black hole, and you have a tour-de-force that screams \"this is heavy metal!\" It's surprising Fluff wasn't placed directly after this track to try and bring the listener back to reality.\n\nWhile the rest of the album doesn't quite match that song's caliber, you best believe Sabbath Bloody Sabbath is worth buying for the title track alone. Even if you already have the song on one of the greatest hits comps or on an MP3, get it anyway. You never know when those other \"copies\" might scratch/get corrupted from internet viruses.\n",
        "\nBefore I get to the rest of the album, let me state up front that Changes is a fucking abomination, an aural train wreck with absolutely no business being anywhere near a Black Sabbath album. I don't anybody mistaking me for a person that thinks this song has a redeeming feature, or is acceptable for human consumption in any way. FX is almost as bad. Skip these two \"songs\" all together.\n\nThe A side of Volume 4 is as powerful as the one in Paranoid. In some ways, and that is high praise. it's real drugged-out debauchery awesomeness. The washed-out opening blues that introduce the album sounds like waking up in the middle of a siren-scored night in your own coke-ridden excess, and that's the vibe of the album. But in a cinematic sort of way. It's visceral. Tony Iommi's guitar is mixed way up, which means that you get to hear him at his fiercest. It also means you can barely hear Geezer Butler. Frankly, I'll take that sacrifice, because Iommi is just unbelievable here. Wheels of Confusion and especially Supernaut are the essence of head-banging metal. His solo in Snowblind is not his best on the record but its as good as most of the solos on here. My opinion for best guitar solo on here belongs to Supernaut. The driving riff in Under the Sun sounds like galloping down a dark forest trail to the battlefield, and Iommi throws some fun licks into St. Vitus Dance to turn the song into a relatively accessible party shaker. Its a decent song but not much else really and its too short.\n\nI'm not actually sure why Ozzy gets to be on the cover though but it really is a moot point. The riffs on here gets a little much by side two; come to think of it, but not in a bad way and that is the brilliance of Iommi's riffs. The band used this formula on Master of Reality too, and that's a great album. The thing was, the riffs were even better! Snowblind, competent as it is, is sort of a bad sign and by Cornucopia, the songwriting non-finesse is starting to just sound plainly a little worn-out, and not even Ozzy's 'ariiiight!'s get much energy up. And the Spanish guitar instrumental Laguna Sunrise, pleasant though it is, sounds too distant from the album, like it was recorded by different people in a different decade in a different part of the world. It's more bizarre than interesting, at least in the context of this album.\n\nBut overall you need this album. That is only if you haven't heard it yet but how can that be possible over forty years later. This album needs to be heard and enjoyed. Long live metal.\n",
        "\nLike my title states, I believe that this album is underappreciated. \n\nYes, most fans dislike this album. Yes, the members of this band (especially Ozzy, if you need proof, read his autobiography) do not look back on this album/period fondly. Regardless, this album does not sound bad.\n\nI will admit that the album may not be as good as the band's previous work, but it still sounds like a Black Sabbath production and album. The addition of keyboard synthesizers do seem to expand on the bands sound while adding to Sabbath's \"darker\" sound that they are known for. Also, let us not forget how the band had experimented and even used some synthesizer work on their previous albums. Looking back, one could also view the addition of the synthesizers as \"being ahead of their time\" or even \"pioneers\", since much of the next decades work (including metal and even Ozzy Osbourne's solo work) included keyboard synthesizers.\n\nAlso, the bands performance is still great. There is still the signature \"dark\" guitar work of Iommi throughout the album. Geezer's ant-establishment lyrics (which they have had in all of their albums) is well-represented, along with his bass. Ozzy's vocals, even though he was losing interest in the band, and was looking to form a new one, are actually just as good on this album as the earlier ones. Bill Ward's drums keep perfect time, cause the album to sound great (as always), and even his vocals, as represented in the track, \"It's Alright\", are rather good. Lastly, as stated before, the addition of the keyboard synthesizer work complements and adds to the overall feel and sound of the album.\n\nThere are also other reasons as to why this album is underappreciated. First for many fans, they did not care for the direction that the band seemed to be going. This is understood, for it is of personal taste. Second, it is well known that all of the band members (not only Mr. Osbourne) have admitted to having addiction problems, and at this time in their career led to many difficulties in this (and especially the next- Never Say Die!) album. Again as stated before, there is also Ozzy Osbourne's lack of interest in making this album due to his addiction problems, and looking to start another band with other musicians. Therefore, it only makes sense why some fans, and the band do not look at this album favourably.\n\nRegardless of the problems stated above, the expansion on the sound and solid work from the band's members still make this an album worth listening to and an underappreciated work by Black Sabbath. This is especially evident in the fact that regardless of the problems that the band was going through, they were still able to come together and make a decent album together. This is proof of true talent, and one of the reasons why this band is considered on of the greatest in rock and roll. Even at their worst they were still better than others.\n",
        "\nI do not hate this album. I totally understand why there are people who do, and even why people would be clamoring for Ronnie James Dio to join the group already (I would agree if he wasn't spending 1976 recording the seminal Rising and going on to record the classic Long Live Rock & Roll the year Black Sabbath shat out Never Say Die). Technical Ecstasy seems overproduced, and there's a lot of moments on here that seems the band is trying to sellout for some mainstream appeal. Case in point: It's Alright. These guys were so high they let Bill Ward sing a fucking Billy Joel song. Why do people hate Changes again? If you're gonna worship the Piano Man least attempt to emulate songs like Prelude/Angry Young Man or The Ballad of Billy The Kid (or Big Shot or Close To The Borderline, but those weren't written yet so they wouldn't have gotten the inspiration).\n\nOne critical piece of information that historians seem to forget around this time is that Black Sabbath have tuned their guitars instruments back up to standard. I'm guessing Tony Iommi was so high on cocaine he didn't need to make things easy on his fingers anymore. He was also high enough to think he was a record producer. His production here can best be described as sterile. You can hear all the instruments properly for most part but Tony Iommi's guitar just doesn't sound as full as it did on those early Sabbath albums. What's worse I swear they stuck with this sound up through Heaven & fucking Hell. I don't quite get how Martin Birch never figured this out and sought to immediately correct it (thankfully he would for Mob Rules, but still). Nonetheless, all the cocaine in the world can't stop Anthony Frank Iommi from writing some damn fine riffs. Dirty Women, All Moving Parts (Stand Still), You Won't Change Me (well the opening, anyway) and Gypsy are all solid heavy riffs in the Sabbath vein that we mostly recognize. \n\nNonetheless, there are also some bad moments here too. Like, really bad. Rock & Roll Doctor is ok on certain days, and other days you curse the band for making this a live staple for the remainder of the original Ozzy years. This song would have trouble cutting the mustard as a Status Quo song, let along a song by the band that redefined darkness and heaviness. She's Gone is Changes 2.0. I defend Changes a little more than most Sabbath fans but this song adds nothing, NOTHING that song didn't already. Complete waste of time. Even Dirty Women; the first four minutes are great but it just goes on and on and on and why the fuck didn't they fade this out 3 minutes ago? Especially since you can barely hear Tony under the millions of layers of vocals droning \"dirty women\" with as much inspiration as a Fred Durst drunk on Keystone. Oh, and that Breaking The Law riff everyone says is in Dirty Women? Well all I can say is if Priest did steal it, they put it to much better use than Sabbath did.\n\nTechnical Ecstasy is something I'd recommend for Ozzy Sabbath fans only. After Sabotage its like the band were creatively and emotionally drained. If you really want to own it, get it for as cheap as you can.\n",
        "\nMany folks seem to think that heavy music, particularly heavy metal music, can only be successfully recorded under conditions of poverty, sorrow and misery to capture the \"authentic\" vibe of \"real music.\" Volume 4 is Exhibit A to an opposing viewpoint academic journal that simply reads \"Holy crap you are wrong you fucking idiot.\" Volume 4 was recorded under the conditions of: giant mansions, 8 track stereos, a color TV in every room, all the hoes you can tap in a day and cocaine; mountains, glaciers, icebergs and Blashrykh-esque crystal fortresses of cocaine.\n\nGranted, it's not the most consistent of Black Sabbath's early works, and that is saying something considering this is the band who thought Fluff, Solitude, and that super long guitar jam on Warning were good ideas to record for posterity. The song that is practically universally despised is Changes, completely eschewing guitar for a piano approach to all things. My take: it's not my favorite Sabbath tune or even my favorite Sabbath interlude song from this album (that would be Laguna Sunrise), but it's really not that much of a betrayal of Black Sabbath's dismal spirit. It's certainly not Piano Man (not that there's anything wrong with Piano Man, or Billy Joel for that matter), and is a much more effective \"my wife left me/died\" track than the previous album's attempt, Solitude. Then there's FX, which is just goddamn awful. The record executives who were concerned the album's working title was a reference to cocaine should have been more concerned that there was a two minute waste of time consisting of lousy guitar effects as the fourth track of the album.\n\nNonetheless, people come to Black Sabbath for the heavy, and the riffs; and sweet creamy Jesus raping both Satan and Prophet Muhammed does this album have both of those in spades! Some of these tracks are some of the greatest creations that Black Sabbath came up with. Do not just listen to Snowblind when you get this album. Don't get me wrong, Snowblind fucking owns, but I'm not entirely sure why that was the only live staple to come from this album. Supernaut was hailed by Frank Zappa of all people as the greatest rock riff of all time. It's up there that's for damn sure, one of Tony Iommi's finest fretted feats. Bill Ward is also praised for his drum soloing on this song, but I honestly don't hear it. I do hear a damn fine, even funky beat around 2:37, but no soloing.\n\nBut the real highlights of Volume 4 are the first and last tracks. These are doom metal epics of the highest, pure uncut Colombian caliber. For all the praise that Into The Void [deservedly] gets for setting new standards of heaviness, Under The Sun/Every Day Comes & Goes manages to be even heavier. I'm not really sure how this one got forgotten in the mists of time, but seminars could and should be run on this song alone. Wheels of Confusion starts off with a brief swinging blues shuffle before descending into a concrete brick factory at 20 seconds in. Specifically a factory that drops concrete bricks on the heads of those who believe in false metal. You can practically see Ozzy Osbourne, adorned in white frills, raising both his arms in peace signs in time to the artillery fire rhythm, demanding the venue audience do the same, and will likely tell them to clap their hands not two seconds later. You better clap those hands dammit, it's good arm training to help you lift, brah.\n\nThe first sixth Black Sabbath albums are quintessential. As the title suggests, this is the fourth. Do the math.\n",
        "\nMaster of Reality is the third record by Black Sabbath. It was released in 1971 less than a year after Paranoid. How do you follow it up? Considering they will release these records so quickly and within a certain period of time this was not a problem for Black Sabbath. They were already writing the material for this album within a month or two after the release of Paranoid. This record had the arduous task of following up Paranoid, but did so with flying colors. This album has gotten darker, and is lined up with another impressive selection of songs. This is another album that many people will claim to be their favorite, and for damn good reason. Probably the biggest surprise is found in Solitude, one of Sabbath's most forgotten tunes. Based around a medieval chord progression, Iommi and Butler paint a perfect smooth picture, while Osbourne's vocals are augmented by a flute. Bill Ward never makes his entrance, letting this fantastic song remain mellow the whole way through.\n\nThis music on this release is very aggressive but at the same time it's very melodic there's a lot of great music encased within this release. It is one where you see a lot of raw emotion but at the same time you also find a lot of real issues with the music from a lyrical persepctive. This is a release from a band that has already been able to observe some of the things going on around them on their first two records. It is the bookends that are really what's encouraging and also very spectacular.\n\nSweet Leaf the opening track on this release is something that really gets me pumped up. I really enjoy the opening riff. The riff is one of those intoxicating melodies that will stay in your head forever. It doesn't matter what you're doing. mainly because Ozzy Osbourne is able to really showcase his ability to be very calm and cool but he's doing it in such a subtle manner. A manner that is very easily replicable but you can never match his charisma, his emotion and his passion behind this track whenever he's singing.\n\nThis release has gone two times platinum and that might not seem like much considering some very popular bands go platinum in one year and this is two times platinum over the period of over 40. However you have to understand this is a very new genre. One half of people are still definitely afraid of Black Sabbath and the music they ended up very rightfully burying into the ground. \n\nAnd now we simply have the greatest metal song in history. Yes, its that great. I am talking about Into the Void. The band certainly go out with a bang with this metal standard. Tony and Geezer's riffs are at their best and Ozzy Osbourne's voice was rarely so effective and his voice fits Butler's lyrics almost in a perfect way. And so the album draws to a close with a great solo and an even better riff from Tony Iommi. Though never as famous as Paranoid, Master of Reality is easily my favorite Sabbath album (only Paranoid and portions of Sabbath Bloody Sabbath and Sabotage come close to it for me.) Its dark, its metallic, its grinding, and its Black Sabbath at their finest.\n",
        "\nWhile I do defend Tony's right to use the Sabbath name throughout the Ozz-less period, I've also made many a statement saying that the first two Sabbath albums with Dio weren't really proper sounding Sabbath albums, sounding more like Rainbow (or Dio, whatever you want to call it).\n\nThat ends right here.\n\nThis album is a return to the sound of Master of Reality, Volume 4, Sabotage, etc., etc., this is proper sounding Black Sabbath. It just happens to feature Ronnie James Dio on vocals. Judging from the far more socially relevant lyrics, you'd think Geezer was back on lyric duties, but no it turns out Dio is very capable of writing beyond dragons and rainbows (after some prodding from Iommi, that is). Computer God in particular is a very inspired poem from the man on the silver mountain (termination of our youth, FOR WE DO NOT COMPUTE).\n\nI suppose if you were to be super critical, you could say the one missing element is Bill Ward, but Ward was already losing his chops around 1980. Lemmy only knows what kind of positive effect, if any, his playing would have had on the album. True that the dream skinsman would have been Dio's former Rainbow bandmate Cozy Powell, but history seemed to prove they would stay former bandmates forever. Vinnie Appice does just as fine of a job, if not finer, as he did on The Mob Rules.\n\nHighlights...good Lemmy what isn't a highlight? Well, I was never that crazy about Time Machine. Having one version on the album was trepidatious, but two (the reason this album doesn't make it past 90)? No thanks. I was a little annoyed when that was one of the Dehumanizer tracks chosen to play live when I saw this lineup on the 2008 Metal Masters tour. As opposed to After All (The Dead), Buried Alive, Too Late, I (no wait they played that one). Master Of Insanity is a particularly compelling blast of Zeppelin rocker energy. Yes I am making that comparison because there is a nicking of Wanton Song here, but then again I thought Wanton Song kind of sucked to begin with. The intro to Sins of the Father has a passing resemblance to Soundgarden's \"Searching With My Good Eye Closed\" but again, it takes something a bit too passive and meandering and gives it a sense of urgency and danger. I've heard a few critics (ok, just Martin Popoff) say this album was Sabbath following the grunge trend, similar to what Judas Priest did with Painkiller. Both notions I vehemently disagree with because both respective bands begat both of these trends. Sabbath in particular, no grunge/Seattle band would dare blaspheme it's name (well, Kim Thyali kind of did, but he ended hilariously languishing in obscurity. Having your riff correctly repurposed by a band you thought had \"boring parts.\" Rolling on the floor laughing my ass off indeed). Sabbath merely swooped down like a bloody angel fast descending to show these flannel fruitcakes how its supposed to be done. They never did listen though did they? \n\nAn incredible metal record, an incredible 90s metal record, no less. This is the one post Ozzy-Sabbath album you need to own.\n",
        "\nFirst off, Ok junior, NOW you can sing the praises of Tony Iommi tuning lower and creating a much heavier sound that would define metal. Even though most bands around this time stayed in standard tuning for another decade or two, whoops. But yes, here is the beginning of the detuned era for the Sabs, and I say era because it would not last throughout the rest of the band's career despite what unscrupulous critics would say (they would tune back up again around Technical Ecstasy).\n\nBut Tony doesn't just rest on his laurels and settle for insipid chords the entire time (which he very easily could have done, the whole point of tuning down was to make playing easier on his fingers). Master of Reality gives us great, heavy fucking metal riffs that sound great in standard tuning, or any tuning (go look up a 1992 performance of Into The Void with Tony Martin, standard tuning and still Azbantium splitting). It isn't just Tony dropping great riffs either, After Forever's primary riff is actually an immense bass line from Geezer, while Tony counterparts with chords (I said the entire time, and these chords Shirley can't be insipid). I always did wonder what that would sound like if Tony copied the bass line to make it a proper riff. Whatever, you don't question early 70s Tony Iommi, plus he steals the show right back from under Geezer at around 3:25, arguably the finest riff of the whole album!\n\nOne thing that doesn't really get talked about regarding Black Sabbath, beginning with Master of Reality is just how high Ozzy's vocals would get here. All it takes is the opening seconds of Sweet Leaf's \"ALL RIGHT NOW!\" to realize this is a much more sonically developed Ozzy Osbourne then the man who could barely droll out \"the world today is such a wicked place!\" Must of gotten quite tired of the Gillan and Plant comparisons. You would think that with the other melodic instruments would tune lower, Oz would have followed suit to try and play to what the public perceived as the band's strength, but going higher, subverting that expectation, is just one of the little moments of genius the man contributed to the band.\n\nThere is a weakness to this album, and that is Solitude. This is the worst classic Sabbath song. Yes, even worse than Changes. People love shitting on Changes but at least it sticks to Sabbath's theme of depression and sorrow. The only themes Solitude has are vapidity and nap-time. It's worth a listen if you want to hear Geezer and Tony at their most subdued (which is not necessarily a bad idea), but there really should have been another proper heavy song here, since we already had two very solid moody interludes with Embryo and Orchid. \n\nThat aside, Master of Reality is every bit the classic it's been made out to be over the years. Incredibly innovative not just for it's tunings, but for its ghastly vocals as well as sewing the seeds of thrash. Arguably the most important album Black Sabbath ever made, its worth buying for Children of the Grave alone, and the rest is like a fantastic full price rebate.\n",
        "\nThose infamous words via the infamous rock critic Lester Bangs, would not only set the stage for the tension between rock critics and Black Sabbath, but the mainstream in general. Actually another popular misconception about Sabbath is that Lester Bangs always hated them, when the truth is he didn't quite get it at first. I think he can be forgiven considering this album dropped that faithful unlucky Friday with only a couple of Led Zeppelin, Blue Cheer and Cream albums to prepare the world for it. He would later say of Master of Reality \"They should be as palatable to anyone with a memory as the stereotypic two-and three-chord structures of the songs. The only criterion is excitement, and Black Sabbath's got it.\" Which is as close of a compliment from a Rolling Stone critic as one is gonna get.\n\nA more accurate description would be Arthur Brown through a jazz filter. This album is the sole reason why I think Bill Ward is a better drummer than John Bonham and I will fight you for it. Don't get me wrong, Bonham is great, but I don't quite remember him having that unironic jazz swing that Wicked World gives us. There's also this wacky syncopation that feels like a proto-blastbeat on the fast and final section of the eponymous song. If you're gonna test that theory by going straight from Fleshgod Apocalypse of whatever to that song you probably won't hear a blast beat as you know it today, but good Satan is Bill giving that snare drum a walloping. His finest moment on here (and possible of his career) however, is The Wizard. Sure he could just play a straight rock beat underneath, but where the hell is the fun in that? This is one of those songs where you could fill and flam the entire time and as long as you're still keeping time it's all good!\n\nOne thing worth noting about this album is like it's successor, Paranoid, this album is not in a lower tuning. The whole thing is in standard. Those classic riffs from Black Sabbath, NIB, Behind The Wall of Sleep etc, are all in the E to G keys. The detuned days wouldn't start until Master of Reality. I think these riffs are better for it, as the tonality allows the actual horror to shine through.\n\nSpeaking of horror, everyone loves to say how this album is still the scariest album ever after all these years, and it's just not true. Sure the title track stands up to scrutiny but most of the horror feeling flies out the window the second we hear that harmonica. Don't get me wrong, I love The Wizard and it's harmonica (I'm still surprised we never got more of it in later years as Ozzy is fairly competent with it), but scary? No. There's also the extremely strange matter of the drum, bass and guitar solos throughout the album. The album's construction was approached as though the band were playing a show, essentially a live album but without the crowd. That altogether attach is the stuff classics are made of but the problem is shows, especially in the 70s always featured unaccompanied solos and jamming to make up for the lack of material. Nowhere is this more apparent that the final track, Warning. Sabbath would make brilliant use of these jams in later years, starting as early as Paranoid even, but that final half of the song is a bit of a rough patch to get through. Yes Tony does use some creepy chords and licks here but one can't help but wonder if some producer chopping would have helped here.\n\nOn the one hand, you don't rate the first few Black Sabbath albums, you accept them as genius. On the other hand, I can't exactly turn in a review without a number ranking, and I feel a bit dirty giving this less than a 90 considering it's historical importance. But 1970s musical trappings, as fun as they can be (moreso than the trappings of most other decades) hinder the album's goal of being a Boris Karloff horror film put to music. Not that this should be ANY sort of dissuasion from you purchasing the album. If you don't own this, you are not metal. Period.\n",
        "\nI'm one of the very few people on the planet who thinks this is a better album than Heaven & Hell (and also in my opinion this isn't even the best Dio fronted Sabbath had to offer). Not just in terms of aural consistency, but the production is a lot better. Tony Iommi's guitar actually sounds like the chunky beast that gave birth to heavy metal! Look no further than the title track, which just screams metal! \n\nAlso, I've heard some critics complain that The Mob Rules just repurposes the Heaven & Hell tracklist formula, and to this I have a two-pronged rebuttal: 1) this album still did it better, 2) the song Heaven & Hell repurposes the Snowblind riff, so get bent. Honestly this criticism can really only be applied to one song, and that is album opener Turn Up The Night. Is it recycling? Yes. Is it inferior to its counterpart Neon Knights? Yes. Is it a bit too commercial? Yes. Is it a reason to write off the whole album? FUCK NO! Plus there's the whole Voodoo being the second track of the album and not sounding at all like Children of the Sea detail that fucks up that whole narrative. Maybe if Falling Off The Edge of the World or Over & Over was the second track that theory would hold more water.\n\nAlso immediately worth noting is newcomer drummer Vinnie Appice, who fits the band perfectly. To be brutally honest, I think he should have replaced Bill Ward on Heaven & Hell. On cranky days, I'm the kind of person that will rank Bill Ward in his prime better than John Bonham, but the facts are a) Bill was coming out of his prime, and b) his heart wasn't in on Heaven & Hell. He's on record saying that he doesn't even remember recording some of the tracks, and just flat out walked out in the middle of the tour. Hindsight can really suck sometimes.\n\nHighlights of the album include the majestic Sign of the Southern Cross, 8 minutes of powerful majestic power/doom metal (pay attention to Geezer's hypnotizing bass line under the verses. This was even better to witness live) as well as the lethal title track with its death-from-the-skies attack on the senses. Who cares if it doesn't sound like Master of Reality? It's metal and it fucking rules (insert mob or fools related-pun here)!\n\nI suppose the biggest reason why I rank this better than its predecessor is even the filler here is better than the filler there. Well, Ok, E5150 is dumb and FX-esque but one use of the skip button is certainly better than two. Recently listening to this album in full for the first time in a while I was bracing myself for the cringe that I thought would be Country Girl and I was shocked to find myself enjoying it! I used to hate this song along with Walk Away, thinking they were the biggest disgraces to the Black Sabbath name, that Ozzy would never have approved odes to love. Then I would have put on Sabbra Caddabra and jammed to it with zero sense of irony or self-awareness. Funny lot, Ozzy fanboys. It also helps if you keep in mind the \"Rainbow ft. Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler\" formula that started with Heaven & Hell. Especially when you listen to Slipping Away. I mean come on guys, the riff is a repurposed L.A. Connection. If you would rather listen to Slipping Away over L.A. (hell, I would) that's fine, but anyone that doesn't see the similarity, at least in feeling, is being dishonest with themselves.\n\n[Don't] listen to the fools who call this a step down from Heaven & Hell. The Mob Rules kicks ass and is where Black Sabbath really climbed back to the top of the mountain. Only to completely squander the momentum over live album semantics.\n\nRecommended tracks:\nThe Sign of the Southern Cross\nThe Mob Rules\nFalling off The Edge of The World\n",
        "\n*Tap tap BGHAARR!* \n\nYes Ozzy, you're looking through a hole in the sky but we're all looking through the hole in our heads left by that monstrous opening. Holy smeg that riff is so cool, it's almost delicious it's that good. This album is a true great for music in general, heavy/progressive metal and 1975 AND THE WHOLE THING IS JUST BECAUSE OF FOUR SONGS!!! What? Only half the album? But surely that makes it only half good? Well bollocks to that, I have a love that never dies for this record. \n\nRecognised by some as the first thrash song, Symptom of the Universe has another pummelling main riff so epic you need a whole song as an intro. No wonder this is one of Sabbath's best loved tracks; it's straight heavy metal, powerful and aggressive with Ozzy at the helm. Naturally people love it. I on the other hand so love the thrashy riff but enjoy that dropping transition to the second part of the song with the different structure and solos. Somehow they forced even more into this song and it still didn't break despite the mild reggae influence of the final passage. A true testament to the magic powers of these four Brummies. \n\nYes only half the songs on this record you will actually remember BUT that is because the others just aren't a match. If they had appeared on Sabbath Bloody Sabbath or Judas Priest's Rocka Rolla they would of been hailed as classics. Unfortunately \"Am I Going Insane and The Thrill of It All aren't on those albums so are kinda filler here but by no means are garbage. Speaking of garbage Supertzar should of never been invented let alone published on such sheer wonder as Sabotage. Other more minor annoyances include that strange jumping bit near the end of \"Thrill of It All\" and the fact the Bill Ward's drumming has lost all of the jazz fills, rolls and tricks from Paranoid and Master of Reality. Which is a shame because Sabbath's most technical and intricate album deserved, no, damn right NEEDED those mega patterns. Instead of the \"THUD THUD THUD THUD THUD THUD\" gifted in every track as soon as the rest of the band gets more forceful. I dunno, hopefully he was doing a bit more behind the kit and the mix just stuck it all underneath the other instruments. Even the remastered versions still have this flaw though... \n\nAs I said before Hole in the Sky has it's monster main riff and kinda sits as a \"standard heavy metal\" regulator for the three other giants of the album... \n\nWith enough evil to scare off Melissa the notes creep out off the back of that weird twist at the end of the previous track. Megalomania makes you sit back and think\" ah I get a break from the weirdness and go back to the type of classic Sabbath from Paranoid or their eponymous song. Yeah you do but not for long... The fucking song just takes off, switching to an odd time signature, occasional chord bursts from Iommi's guitar that are reminiscent of an F1 car shooting past and the best damn vocals of Ozzy's career. He is literally possessed at this point, shrieking ever maddening verses over the top of a bloody fantastic rolling bass line. It really is a trip in someone else's mind. I simply cannot describe properly the elation I get from this insane twist in the track. I cannot believe they didn't play this (or any) of Sabotage at their final gig. Which was amazing by the way.\n\nOverall this is a very well presented and laid out album. Only Superstar spoils it but ah well, it's still the best Sabbath record. \n\nHighlights: definitely the four titans of this album; with head crusher extraordinaire Megalomania sitting in it's crown at the top of these, grinning and picking it's teeth with a thunderbolt both of which were wrestled off of Zeus. The wah wah afflicted bass of Geezer in \"The Writ\" produces that little bouncing feeling is not your drugs finally kicking in (ok it might be), beautiful lyrics really shine through, helped by the dual layered vocals and crystal passages. The mad twists halfway through Mega and Symptom really show off the progressive nature of the record and the band at the time, it's just such a shame that they couldn't keep up this golden streak. Don't do cocaine kids.\n",
        "\nThere it is: the end of the end. Black Sabbath has massively influenced heavy rock music in the first ten years of its gigantic career and has managed to go out with a bang over the past five years of its career, including a strong comeback album, an outstanding final extended play and a series of concerts including the very last one from their hometown of Birmingham included here. There exist numerous versions of what might be Black Sabbath's final release. Any fan should definitely go for a version including the entire concert plus a final recording session of five Black Sabbath classics in a vivid live in studio approach. The band shows that it hasn't lost any of its atmosphere, charisma and energy after forty-nine years and it will be missed dearly.\n\nThe concert summarizes one last time everything Black Sabbath has always stood for. Bluesy, gloomy and precise riffs, hypnotizing guitar solos, dominating bumblebee bass guitar sounds, tight drumming with occasional percussive elements, eerie melodic vocals, mysterious and occult lyrics and a show with only few special effects but a true front man with a humble attitude, great sense of humor and, most importantly, a close connection to the audience. The sound of the release is authentic, energetic and unpolished. The video section is acceptable even though it includes a few too many cuts and split screen sequences which is a problem most contemporary concert movies suffer from but it certainly isn't among the worst of its kind. The atmosphere at the beginning and the end of the show is amazing but I found that the audience was at times surprisingly quiet in between.\n\nObviously, some elements such as the set list could be criticized here but that wouldn't do the band justice. Is this concert the best show ever recorded by the band? It certainly isn't but it's clearly above average and the historical context of the show makes it an unforgettable milestone in the history of music. Should you own this package? If you like rock and metal music of any kind, you most definitely should. Thank you for the music and God bless Black Sabbath.\n",
        "\nWell, it's over folks. The guys who pioneered heavy metal are done for. This is the album where they say goodbye and give it all they got. Damn, do they deliver. This album has their best of the Ozzy discography pretty much, including some bits of songs that haven't been played live in years! The band overall delivers a great performance, with the exception of Ozzy, but his performance isn't terrible though, and it's really good for his age honestly. He was hitting some high notes that he hasn't hit all that much in recent years, and overall he was giving it all the effort he could possibly give at his age. Of course, he couldn't hit all the high notes, but you could tell he was trying, which is okay! Iommi's performance is probably the highlight of this album though, as his solos are just as good as they've always been. Also, that drummer is pretty damn good. His drum solo was repetitive at times but he has got some skill. Geezers' playing is also very audible and as good as he's always been. Especially his solo. That was really good honestly, almost better than the original solo. It's not like 70s Sabbath appeared out of nowhere, but the guys still deliver a killer performance.\n\nI'm gonna go a bit more in depth on the individual performances. So basically, as you expect, Ozzy's vocals aren't that great, but for what his age is, they are pretty damn good. He was hitting the high notes on Under the Sun very well, and he eventually got tired and hit lower notes, which is understandable. Also, he did bring down his vocals on Children of the Grave, which was disappointing, and probably the worst performance in the show, but it's still not terrible. Now for Iommi, he was killer this entire show. His solos are just on point on every song, despite the fact that they are usually different than the original studio versions. The solos never fail to be bad in any way, as he sticks to his usual style of soloing that can please any Sabbath fan. His guitar tone is also quite good, and it's even better when he's tuned down, which makes the songs sound even heavier than they already were. That's what I like about live Sabbath performances, the songs sound really heavy. As for the bass, what more can I say other than Geezer is a great bassist? I mean, his solo after Behind the Wall of Sleep is just as good as the original solo. It has a lot of wah though, which could've been reduced, but it didn't mess up the performance too much. Geezer plays beyond what the original solo was, which makes it more interesting, but still true to the original solo. When not soloing, he plays his lines well. It's audible as well, which shouldn't be surprising since Sabbath isn't known for degrading the bass in the music. The drummer shines the most on the Rat Salad solo. It isn't really anything like the original solo, and I prefer the original solo, but he does a great job. The main gripe with the solo is that he repeats some patterns a bit too much, and it sounds less like a solo when he does that. Nonetheless, he has a good amount of drum technicality, and in the songs themselves, he does his part in playing Bill Ward's parts. Having Bill Ward play there would've been better, but Tommy is an adequate replacement. There's not much to say about the keyboardist. He just does his job and that's it. Nothing spectacular, but nothing bad either. \n\nI'd also like to comment on the fact that Sabbath played snippets of songs that haven't been played in years, specifically Megalomania. That's a great, and underrated Sabbath classic that needed to be played more when Ozzy still had his voice. Of course, they leave it to the middle part where Ozzy takes a break so he doesn't sing there, but it's still nice to hear. Supernaut and Sabbath Bloody Sabbath was also nice to hear as well, despite them being cut short like Megalomania. All 3 of the songs are 1 track on this album, which works out because they're not playing the full songs, but some riffs from the songs. The Megalomania performance had me mouthing the words actually.\n\nOverall, this is a highly recommended release for Sabbath fans who missed their last show. It shows them at their best in years, and it's enough to satisfy fans. The performance is killer from everyone but Ozzy, and his performance wasn't terrible. If you see this in stores, you should pick it up. I know I will.\n",
        "\nTyr, son of Odin and a viking god of war, is the protagonist on this album. After \"Eternal Idol\" and \"Headless Cross\", the band brought us a handful songs in the purest Birmingham style. There are fans who prefer their epoch with Ozzy for how important they were, especially by the development of heavy metal which lays the basis of doom sound, that\u2019s true because you can't understand them without appreciating their beginnings. However, I like all eras, especially the ones of Dio and Tony Martin, both dinosaurs of metal. The line-up consists in Iommi, Powell, Murray, Martin and Geoff Nichols on keyboards, a veritable cast of monsters that needs no introduction. This album is full of potential hymns worthy of Sabbath's repertoire, really powerful songs with riffs and choruses which burn your head. This band's tandem is infallible when it comes to writing good songs.\n\nThis album was not well-received, but as time heals, the quality was recognized and today is valued with more justice than before when Black Sabbath was immersed in a crisis of brutal credibility. I really say there are only seven songs since tracks 5 to 7 are a \"three in one\", which are thematically dedicated to god Tyr, but lyrics don't matter because what matters is music. In my vinyl appears that songs are composed by Black Sabbath, and lyrics by Tony Martin. In contrast to might seem, this isn't a conceptual disc because the other songs don't talk about Norse mythology, they're varied lyrics. I'd say this is a heavy metal classic ever, heavy metal with no labels which provides dark sound, melancholy ambient and magic melodies. Perhaps can be added baleful and mysterious as well, sounding as a set of compact songs, with Iommi's heavy riffs and Martin's ripped, powerful vocals with a powerful rhythmic base where Cozy Powell outstands. Songs travel between the power metal vein with easy but effective choruses (emphasizing the honorable \"Jerusalem\"), they're both relaxed and optimistic. All in all, this record has a quite successful production and a brilliant cover which outstands as a battle standard.\n\nBlack Sabbath went on to a new phase that many didn't understand. The instrumental, heavy and technical songwriting is combined in a good way with Tony's chilling vocals; we have even \"The Battle of Tyr/Odin's Court\" which seem to be the starting point of a new way of doing music. The 80s did end with Tyr, an album which fits perfectly into a top ten and I dare to say in a top five in Sabbath\u2019s career, some people have said that the no-classic singers who did record with this band shouldn't release discs under the band's name because they weren't Black Sabbath. On the other hand, we must finish once and for all the apriorisms related with Black Sabbath because is still said that the so-called Osbourne's years are above Dio's and Tony's epoch, which are true fallacies. In short, Tyr was a work that deserved to be continued but at the end, egos did weigh more than a good agreement. Luckily, Cross Purposes fixes the inconvenient with Tony's comeback, considering it more accessible than Dehumanizer.\n",
        "\nWhat has happened here? While Heaven and Hell was a diverse yet focused heavy metal milestone that deserves all the praise it gets, Mob Rules is quite underwhelming. While the sum was greater than its part on the excellent predecessor, Mob Rules sounds unfocused. While the forty minutes of the predecessor passed by so quickly that one couldn't stop listening to the release all over again, Mob Rules sounds like an endless streak of plodding tunes. After listening to both records numerous times, I'm going to elaborate upon three reasons why Mob Rules doesn't convince me.\n\nFirst of all, the record plays it safe. Some people might say that one shouldn't change a winning formula. This is true when the formula is executed perfectly. However, this isn't the case for Mob Rules. It copies Heaven and Hell without achieving its quality. The opening up-tempo track ''Turn Up the Night'', even though it is still one of the better songs, is nowhere near as energizing as ''Neon Knights''. ''The Sign of the Southern Cross'' overstays its welcome with a length of almost eight minutes, followed by a vapid instrumental entitled ''E5150'' that adds three more minutes of boredom. If compared to last record's epic ''Heaven and Hell'' that had a memorable riff, a mysterious middle section and appropriate overture and coda with acoustic guitars, ''The Sign of the Southern Cross'' only features a few nice acoustic guitar melodies and great vocals but these two elements just can't carry such a long track on their own. While the predecessor closed with the inspired melancholic ''Lonely is the World'' with dominant bass guitar, precise drumming and skilled vocals, Mob Rules ends with the plodding ''Over and Over'' that fails to evoke an epic atmosphere and rather reminds me of a conservative rock lullaby.\n\nSecondly, the individual performances aren't as convincing as on the predecessor. The guitar riffs aren't as gripping, melodic and memorable and the guitar solos are at times lacking emotions as well. The bass guitar is less audible than on the predecessor and doesn't have the same dominance, energy and vibe. New drummer Vinny Appice isn't as convincing as Bill Ward. The drumming on this album often feels repetitive and restrained and rarely provides some much-needed energy. Bill Ward wasn't a flashy drummer but his style was precise while Vinny Appice's performance is lacking precision and sometimes sounds as if he were sleepwalking behind his kit. Only Ronnie James Dio delivers a passionate performance and makes several below average tunes sound at least above average. His style hasn't changed or evolved either but he is on the some top quality level as on the predecessor and he is the only one involved who adds some energy to an album that sounds lifeless but not in an atmospheric way.\n\nThirdly, the songwriting is lazy. The riffs often sound like weaker copies of similar techniques used on the previous record. Therefore, they aren't particularly memorable despite Iommi's signature style. The guitar solos feel like mandatory middle sections that are placed in the songs as predictable routine jobs. In several cases, songs end on uninspired fade-outs of guitar solos. If you feel your guitar solo is going nowhere or so repetitive that you need to fade it out, then it usually means it just isn't a good guitar solo and this applies quite often here. The bass guitar and drums are retrograded to background and rhythm instruments that fail to develop the songs. Especially the epic ''The Sign of the Southern Cross'' and the closing ''Over and Over'', which are the two longest tracks on the album, are at times shockingly uninspired regarding the main rhythms. A few drum fills and one or two audible bass notes can't hide that lack of inspiration. Overall, the longer tracks overstay their welcome and don't get to the point. They are neither surprising, nor intellectual or emotional. There is no reason for ''The Sign of the Southern Cross'' to be eight minutes long. The track could be edited to four minutes without losing any essential elements and would sound much more compact and focused. Only the shorter tunes such as the powerful ''Mob Rules'' and the playful ''Slipping Away'' recall the quality of the predecessor. The record's second half is a slight improvement over the disappointing first part.\n\nIn the end, Mob Rules is a weaker copy of Heaven and Hell and disappoints with a predictable formula, unconvincing instrumental performances and lazy songwriting. Only Ronnie James Dio's vocals are as great as on the predecessor. His performance and the few shorter songs save this album from being below average. While Heaven and Hell was a milestone for both Black Sabbath and the heavy metal genre as a whole, Mob Rules might be on of the band's weakest and most overrated efforts ever. Mob Rules is for collectors and faithful fans only. If you already own Heaven and Hell, you don't need Mob Rules.\n",
        "\nChanges and experiments aren't much welcomed in the music business nowadays and this especially applies to the metal genre. Traditionalists complained about the groove metal genre that appealed to younger audiences that weren't familiar with traditional metal subgenres in the nineties. In the beginning of the new millennium, more conservative metal fans wouldn't even accept alternative and nu metal as genuine metal subgenres and even created the pejorative term mallcore for it while it served as a gateway to other types of metal music for those who didn't know about it before. Nowadays, the same thing applies to metalcore and deathcore that appeal to younger audiences while older fans once again refuse to associate them with their favorite type of music. When a popular band goes through an important line-up change such as getting rid of a founding member or replacing the singer, the reactions are often negative as well.\n\nHeaven and Hell is the most popular exception to the phenomenons described above. Black Sabbath changed its style and went away from both the slow-paced gloomy doom metal of the early years and the more psychedelic hard rock style of the late seventies. Heaven and Hell is a heavy metal album with a consistent mid-tempo pace and a mixture of more serious tracks like ''Lady Evil'', a few more uplifting tracks such as ''Neon Nights'' and some tunes with epic proportions like ''Heaven and Hell''. As if this change weren't enough, charismatic lead singer Ozzy Osbourne was replaced by Ronnie James Dio who has a completely different voice with a much higher range, a more melodic and high-pitched singing voice and a quite theatric and expressive manner to it. I'm quite sure these two important changes would be criticized by more conservative fans these days but back in the days when heavy metal was still in its early stages and constantly evolving, this record was hailed as a renaissance of a legendary heavy metal band after two lukewarm final efforts with Ozzy Osbourne. Heaven and Hell got the reception it deserved and probably even beyond that because the record felt particularly refreshing after the two previous unfocused efforts.\n\nThe reasons for the success of this record that made so much sense back then but might be surprising from a contemporary point of view can be explained by three precise factors. First of all, this release is Black Sabbath's most focused effort since at least Sabotage. Gone are vapid instrumental tracks, songs that needed to be sung by the drummer because the singer didn't like the lyrics and sudden genre changes within the same album. What we get here are eight heavy metal tracks that don't sound repetitive but manage to vary quite a bit within the boundaries of their subgenre. The opening up-tempo track is as well executed as the plodding title song with its unforgettable main riff. This album doesn't include any fillers or even slightly weak tunes. It's focused, heavy and passionate from start to finish. \n\nThis leads to the second factor. The band members seemed to enjoy themselves while recording this album. While the songs from the previous releases were at times lackluster and all over the place, the four musicians involved in this album all deliver outstanding jobs in their respective categories. The guitar play sounds variable, memorable and emotional. The main riff of the title song is one for the ages, the guitar solos sound inspired and always blend in and even the few acoustic guitar parts make sense in their respective song structures. The bass guitar is as audible, dominant and energizing as in the band's early years. It isn't just there to add some galloping background rhythms but is as essential to the sound of this release as the guitar play. The drumming is precise and to the point, harmonizing brilliantly with the bass guitar rhythms in particular. The performance isn't flashy or spectacular but always serves the atmosphere and songwriting of each specific tune which makes for a focused and grounded approach. The vocals are quite variable and always suit each song excellently. Sometimes the vocals are a little bit fast and high-pitched, in other songs they are soothing, slow and seducing and in some tunes we get an epic, gloomy and theatric approach as if you were listening to a shady campfire tale. Every musician involved in this album delivers an outstanding performance.\n\nThe third and most important element is that the four individual efforts lead to something even bigger as the different band members are truly collaborating and working towards a specific goal. This is why Heaven and Hell has both a clear guiding line in form of its heavy metal vibe and a quite creative and diverse approach where each song tries out something slightly different to complement one another. Each song convinces individually but the sum is even greater than its different parts. Back when the record was released, Heaven and Hell was one of the very best heavy metal album so far and showed what can be achieved in this genre from dreamy power ballads over intellectual epics to vivid up-tempo rockers. Heaven and Hell showed the full potential of heavy metal music and it became an example, influence and inspiration for many other groups. One could even say that Heaven and Hell was the starting point of heavy metal's most glorious decade. The legacy of this release is truly remarkable.\n\nIn conclusion, Heaven and Hell convinces with focused songwriting, passionate individual efforts and truly collaborative teamwork. Despite the individual quality of each of the eight songs, the sum is greater than its parts as this album as a whole showed the true potential of the heavy metal genre back then, was the starting point of heavy metal's most glorious decade and has achieved a remarkable legacy that hasn't lost its impressive charm. Even nearly four decades after its initial release, Heaven and Hell is a brilliant example that change can be an enriching and positive thing. I'm a massive fan of Ozzy Osbourne and Black Sabbath's early years and I will always prefer Ozzy Osbourne's gloomy uniqueness over Ronnie James Dio's more theatric approach but I have to admit that Heaven and Hell is a very good album that has stood the test of time. In days where the metal community seems to divided between more conservative minds and more experimental fans, this genre could need another Heaven and Hell that unites both sides because of its excellent quality.\n",
        "\n(Please see my profile for my rating scale.)\n\nHere at metal-archives, Black Sabbath albums appear to be in very high esteem indeed. Even the Ozzy-less, Dio-less albums tend to score surprisingly highly. Looking at other high-profile metal bands' output -- say, Metallica, Iron Maiden, Megadeth -- this site's reviewers tend to be far less forgiving of all but the absolute classics. \n\nNow, this Black Sabbath album, Paranoid, is currently rightly sitting in the mid-90s. Well deserved...\n\n...but then every one of the band's first six albums is right around 90 or higher. Paranoid is, it appears, just another highly efficient member of an amazingly consistent set of records. Well, I beg to differ. Paranoid has a wider reputation of being a standout, and in humble opinion it is really on another level -- even against the other early classics by the same band.\n\nI get it. Black Sabbath essentially invented heavy metal. The whole genre is built on the template of those five or six albums. They deserve the utmost respect and admiration.\n\nBUT! While full of excellent material, only one of those albums is equal in quality to Paranoid -- and that's Paranoid itself. The gap between Paranoid's quality and that of the others is really quite wide, and while it has become fashionable to pick other records over the \"obvious\" choice that is the present album, I have to say that being fashionable does not make it justified.\n\nConsider the first track, the 8-minute epic War Pigs. This is a song that works on every level. Musically, it is through-composed and quasi-progressive, eschewing a simple structure and indulging in restrained but beautifully melodic guitar solo sections accompanied by adventurously melodic bass lines by Geezer Butler. (Note that each solo isn't just improvised noodling but rather develops one sublime melodic idea or another.) Tony Iommi's riffs are tight, dark, and dripping not just with heaviness but also a cutting feeling of anger. Bill Ward's drums thunder on with explosive and varied fills that make the rhythm section more of a lead instrument rather than just a time-keeper. The lyrics (albeit starting off with a rather clumsy rhyme -- \"Generals gathered in their masses / Just like withes at black masses\") are utterly evocative of the evil realities of every war ever fought, later juxtaposed against an apocalyptic-demonic judgment day wherein the \"war pigs\" get what was coming to them all along, a date with Satan. War Pigs is so fucking good that it's difficult to imagine how the rest of album can possibly keep up.\n\nStrictly speaking, it doesn't. Nothing here is as good as War Pigs -- nor is any other Sabbath song -- but on the other hand, have you ever heard Iron Man, with its utterly irreplaceable, classic main riff? How about the title track, a short but addictive single featuring a particularly sweetly-toned Iommi solo? Fairies Wear Boots, though not exactly a Tolstoi-esque narrative lyrically, is yet another live favorite with a beautiful set of intro and outro guitar-bass explorations. Even the lesser known tracks are metal templates. Hand of Doom, for example, is highly underrated with its slow build, light-touch drumming, and utterly crushing climax anticipating thousands of heavy metal songs to follow the same template.\n\nIt's all good. All of it... but what sets it apart from Sabbath's other output is that the lack of excesses of success keep both the writing and playing tight, hungry, and angry. Iommi is a riff machine under any circumstance, but Paranoid was apparently recorded in a couple of days due to lacking funds; and similarly lacking funds meant no access to mountains of cocaine. As a result, the band sounds tightly practiced: they went in with ready songs knowing just how to play them, laid down the tracks, and that was that. Lacking money and full control over the studio meant professional engineering and production, meaning no \"experiments\" in the producing department. That is to say: a clean, balanced sound, where every note by every instrument is clearly heard. And what's heard sounds live and organic, other than a few overdubbed SFX. (Sabbath here never cheats by adding rhythm guitar during solos; that's Geezer's bass territory. However, solos are at times enhanced with a 2nd lead guitar used to great effect. Tony is not a flashy lead player, but the 2nd lead makes things more lively and just a bit shreddy at times.)\n\nBeyond the technical aspects, the ultimate effect is that it isn't just \"heavy\": Sabbath is always heavy. No: Paranoid sounds ANGRY, too. The music cuts and attacks, used like a precise weapon. It's certainly not thrash metal, but still the effect is quite different from the down-tuned sludginess of the follow-ups Master of Reality and Vol. 4, hard rock experimentation of Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, or vestigial blues jamming of much of the self-titled predecessor and debut album.\n\nIn particular, Ozzy is still in the all-too-brief early part of his career when he was actually GOOD: when his voice sounded fittingly eerie and alien, at times even deep -- perfectly complementing the songs. Just think of it: Ozzy Osbourne's voice is usually in the \"excuse\" part of every review of every record on which he appears (even his solo output!) -- you know... \"good songs, and Ozzy sounds fine given his limitations...\" etc. etc. No; on Paranoid he's an inextricable part of the near-perfect whole. Not only does he hit the notes, but he actually improves the songs with his execution, particularly on War Pigs and Iron Man. (That said, he was possibly even better/more determinedly demonic on the debut album.)\n\nSo, yeah. While non-metal press tends to dismiss every Sabbath album BUT Paranoid, it isn't fair either to compensate for this by dismissing its standout stature, claiming it's one of many similarly great albums. Paranoid is Sabbath at its peak, by far. Hell, War Pigs would've been enough to make it so!\n\nP.S. Planet Caravan, a slow ballad of sorts, evokes a certain mood but tends to be a skipper for me. The album's lyrics are evocative of powerful imagery but are also somewhat childishly written. These are real issues, but the overall effect is hardly damaged, unless you are extremely snobby about such things.\n",
        "\nThe mid-1980's was a time filled with turmoil for Black Sabbath and its ever-fighting leader and guitarist Tony Iommi. After losing Ronnie James Dio in 1982, the band would venture on to try out a large bulk of different singers (and backing members) from both sides of the world. By 1987 the band had settled with the late Ray Gillen as its singer and the work for The Eternal Idol started. Sometime during the album's recording process, however, Ray Gillen suddenly left the band and was replaced by the future long-term vocalist Tony Martin.\n\nThe Eternal Idol is largely a natural evolution and, to some extent, continuation from the band's previous album Seventh Star, which was initially contemplated to become Tony Iommi's first solo album. Just like with Iommi's intended solo effort, this album sees Sabbath going for a more typical melodic 80's metal approach. Where Black Sabbath once was leading an evolution of heavy music, we now hear them adapt to the younger rockers instead. While the new sound and formula certainly is something different for the band, I don't really feel like it's anything wrong or bad about it. In fact, Iommi's trademark sound and riffs are all still there. The greatest differences lie in a slightly increased use of keyboards as well as Martin's powerful 80's arena-esque vocals.\n\nThe album kicks off with \"The Shining\", a very anthemic tune which also happens to be one of the band's most underrated ones. It's followed by \"Ancient Warrior\" which is not only one of the album's slowest and heaviest tracks, but also said to be one of Tony Iommi's personal favorites from this album. After this point the album is more or less a collection of mid-tempo anthems to faster and aggressive rockers, all of which work well together and manage to create a good flow throughout the album. Despite its overall typical 80's metal sound, however, there are a few occasions where we get treated with classic trademark-sounding doom riffs such as in \"Nightmare\" and the title track.\n\nWhile the song material tends to be really good, the album suffers from one great flaw which is its production. I always found this album to sound pretty bad. I've gotten used to its sound over the years, but I still cannot get over the feeling that it sounds more like a rough mix than a final mix. It's not as bad as the horrible and muddy mix on their 1983 album Born Again, but that one's also quite notorious in the \"bad record mixes\" department. Still, the mix on The Eternal Idol sadly leaves a lot to be desired, and despite the album receiving remaster treatment at least twice throughout the years, it hasn't really been improved (it sounds exactly like the original release).\n\nThe Eternal Idol is possibly the most underrated/overlooked Black Sabbath release of all time. The Tony Martin era in general is widely overlooked, but this one takes the cake for me personally. While some of the other Tony Martin albums have gained more of a fanbase, such as 1989's Headless Cross, this album still stands as something of a pinnacle in the darkest chapter of Sabbath's career. I personally think this is a criminally underrated Black Sabbath release. One that I actually find myself listening to more these days than several of the Ozzy and Dio-era albums.\n",
        "\nThere's an old saying about music (I'm actually just making it up now, so don't go searching for the quote). It goes like this: if you don't like Black Sabbath, you haven't listened to enough of their albums. That's because Black Sabbath were so many different things over a period of 45 years, morphing from proto-metal upstarts into prog rock riffmeisters to a prominent place in the burgeoning NWOBHM to a secret epic metal phase which is probably my favourite from the (mostly) Birmingham four-piece. There's another saying as well (same source, by the way), which is that if you've listened to all of Black Sabbath's albums and still don't like them, then you don't like Tony Iommi and therefore you don't like guitar music. All of which would imply that you've come to the wrong website or I've just become more famous than I ever imagined and you're reading this somewhere else.\n\nSo let's assume that you're here because you like heavy metal, since that's the most likely explanation. You know Dio, right? He sings on this album. He sings very well. You know Tony Iommi, right? He's on the album too and he's also very good. Perhaps you've heard of Geezer Butler and Bill Ward? The other two men who invented heavy metal: they play on Heaven and Hell as well. They are great, especially Butler.\n\nThat little paragraph tells you what everyone already knows about this version of Black Sabbath, but it doesn't say anything about what makes this both special and different from other albums by the band. The first thing that distinguishes this from the early incarnation of the group (conveniently forgetting about Technical Ecstasy and Never Say Die!) is the pace of the songs. While TrooperEd may be having a laugh about this really being a Rainbow album, there's enough of the energetic style of Dio's last venture with that band, Long Live Rock 'n' Roll, to prove more than just an incidental connection between the singer and Richie Blackmore's project. The manner in which the title track takes off in its second half harks back to Blackmore's riffing on that album's 'Kill the King', while the more rocking 'Wishing Well' moves in the same circles as 'The Shed (Subtle)' or 'Long Live Rock 'n' Roll'. On the other hand, there's a different kind of influence on the likes of 'Neon Knights' and 'Die Young', sounding closer to the more primal Iron Maidens and Saxons that were cropping up by 1980 as they bound forward on the kind of riff that made 'Sanctuary' a breath of fresh air in the UK. The quality of those songs, though, is actually that much higher than Iron Maiden or Wheels of Steel, the fluidity of the solos and masterful bubbling bass work refining the punky rawness of early NWOBHM into a finished product, while Dio is clearly the most accomplished vocalist of the three groups (bearing in mind Paulo Di'Anno still fronted Maiden at this point).\n\nNaturally, Heaven and Hell isn't all about pace, taking things down a notch for 'Children of the Sea' and the obligatory mournful closer in 'Lonely Is the Word'. The use of acoustic guitars and fluctuations in song movement give an extra dimension to those songs, ensuring that the emotion seeps in by way of the defeated mid-section leads and hopeful ending of 'Lonely Is the Word' and the soothing calm of the former song. Even at these moments, in addition to the steadier rockers 'Walk Away', 'Lady Evil', and 'Wishing Well', the music remains busy, Butler, Ward, and Iommi continuing to supply diversions from their respective instruments, the guitarist drenching several songs in leads and the rhythm players rarely settling to remain out of the spotlight. For anyone expecting doom metal, Heaven and Hell is pretty barren of the stuff, which may explain why the subsequent formation of the band named Heaven and Hell (who released The Devil You Know in 2009 with Vinny Appice taking the place of Bill Ward) did not experience total success with a generally darker sound. Here, only a short bridge in 'Walk Away' and the epic opening of the title track could be called doomy, meaning that the general mood is much lighter and more wistful than any of Sabbath's earlier or later material.\n\nThe only thing that remains for me to comment on is the quality of the 40 minutes of music. Quite honestly, the style doesn't suit me throughout Heaven and Hell, since the more rocking songs can feel a little throwaway at times, even if 'Lady Evil' is an absolute stomping stormer of a rocker and the other two have some good moments, especially with the leads. I'm more a fan of the fast paced material, plus the songwriting on the title track is impossible to fault, though I can't actively complain about any of the band's decisions in playing, even if it would have been nice to make the style a bit more Sabbath specific. In any case, this is an iconic release with four musicians at the top of their game (whatever people may say about Ward, he does a good job to my ears) and has some of Black Sabbath's best songs, along with a few that are high in quality but slightly exchangeable. You'll be wanting to listen to this one, that's for sure.\n",
        "\nBlack Sabbath is a band that needs no introduction. They are the band that singlehandedly created heavy metal, and laid the foundation for all of those who followed. While some will undoubtedly point to Deep Purple and Led Zeppelin and claim them to be equal pioneers, neither of them were quite as heavy as Black Sabbath, nor did they have same eerie sound, bleak lyrics, or occult imagery. Coming out in 1970, near the end of the hippie movement, Ozzy and his pals created quite a stir in the music world. As the hippie movement came to an end, and Black Sabbath spread their influences to countless other bands, the face of music would drastically change.\n\nThe music on this album is pretty much what one would expect from an early heavy metal album. The guitar and bass are very heavy sounding, yet retain a bluesy quality to them. Bill Ward's drumming is also very aggressive for the time this came out. Ozzy sometimes comes off a bit raspy now and then, but his voice is still very good and fits the music quite well. The album has an overall earthy sound to it, as if the band deliberately wanted an unpolished sound. The lyrics definitely reflect the band's interests, such as the band naming themselves after a horror film. This is also evident such as the case with \"Behind The Wall Of Sleep\", which is directly inspired by the HP Lovecraft story, Beyond The Wall Of Sleep, and \"The Wizard\" which is based on the wizard Gandalf from The Hobbit.\n\nWhile it's certainly debatable which Black Sabbath record is the best, I think it's safe to say that this is the most important. I would absolutely recommend it to anyone that is new to, or at least has some interest in heavy metal. Not just for it's importance, it is just a quality record filled with memorable songs. Pick this one up right away!\n",
        "\nWhat comes to mind first and foremost when I think of this outrageously strange Black Sabbath oddity is a piece I read about Kurt Cobain (RIP) selecting this album for his birthday at a K-Mart back in the day, leaving his poor mother aghast. Stricken, she exclaimed: \"There is NO place for THAT in the Cobain home!\"\n\nFrankly, I've always been perplexed by Born Again, prejudiced towards it even because of its horrendous cover and grimy production, same as with one time \"Deep Sabbath\"/\"Black Purple\" vocalist Ian Gillan who - and here's another fun tidbit - supposedly threw up upon seeing the atrocious devil baby on a garish purple background before puking once more after hearing it! He even chucked the entire lot of promo copies out the window. No wonder he didn't stick around for a repeater. \n\nIce breaking pleasantries aside, I think the real culprit of my initial dismay is the ensemble of B-side tracks, notably \"Digital Bitch, \"Hot Line\" and the lewd sounding \"Keep It Warm\" which still has me scratching my head while smirking at such inherently cheap, sleazy titles. However, upon giving Born Again a recent re-listen, I'm inclined to change my tune and paint it in a slightly brighter light. \n\nFor one thing, Tony Iommi proves once again why he's the bed rock to Black Sabbath's foundation; while a couple tracks really are tripe, such as the flaky \"E5150\"-like two minute interlude preceding \"Disturbing The Priest\", \"Stonehenge\", whose thumping beats at one point have me expecting some bewilderingly misplaced hardcore techno muzak, a menial \"bah humbug\" title track and album closer \"Keep It Warm\", Iommi's unmistakeable trademark style of barn burning (soloing) is ever present. I mean, at least \"Digital Bitch\" and \"Hot Line\" adhere to the hard-driven approach found on such Sab staples as \"Neon Knights\" and \"Thrashed\", which granted is a fine opener all things considered. \n\nIf there's one thing to be said about Iommi's guitar playing, it's that he never fails to \"turn up the night\" when the moment's right, be it on monster classics (i.e. \"Heaven And Hell\" for instance) or humdrum fare, namely Born Again's B-Side, with his fast and furious trilling (pinkie dominated) leads. Well, \"Keep It Warm\" for that matter sounds like a Technical Ecstacy or Never Say Die cut with its lazy honky-tonk feel and genial vibe: \" I'm like a gypsy, I need to roam, but don't worry I'll be coming home\" - this definitely sounds like a hard rock-ish Deep Purple track. Despite all the pitfalls and quirks surrounding this release, I have to say Ian Gillan indeed made himself at home. (Funny too how a drunken Iommi finagled with the mixing at the last minute, thus warping Born Again's overall sound). \n\nSo, a slight recap: \"Thrashed\" is a typical hard-driven Sabbath opener spiced up with atypical Gillan/Deep Purple chutzpah (see title of this review!) giving way to a trio of atmospheric numbers, the aforementioned \"Stonehenge\", the iconic \"Disturbing The Priest\" (inspired by a real life incident where a genuine man of the cloth politely asked the boys at the castle to tone it down a bit volume wise - and , might I add, much later covered by Sweden's purveyor of anvil-smashing, true grit heavy metal, RAM) and the forty five-second instrumental \"The Dark\" (some weird tomfoolery played backwards) and lead-up to Born Again's highlight, the brooding \"Zero The Hero\". Like \"Disturbing The Priest\", it adheres to a slowed-down pace and eerie connotations to the backdrop of cataplectic, incremental drumming and a super sinister revolving guitar riff. I remember first seeing a live version - the video - of this track on MTV as a kid and being completely entranced. Gillan's evocative rap, notably on the chorus, slays:\n\n\"What you gonna be, what you gonna be brother\nZero the Hero\nDon't you wanna be, don't you wanna be brother\nZero the Hero\nWhen you gonna be, when you gonna be brother\nZero the Hero\nImpossibility impissibolity mother\nReally a Hero!\"\n\nIommi's in top form once again with some decidedly \"evil\" sounding soloing before Gillan steps back through the portal for a final harangue. Great stuff! I also find \"Digital Bitch\" a pleasant surprise. Despite a lackluster chorus (\"She's a digital bitch\" ad nauseum), the instrumentation is on par with former Dio-fronted material not the least of which a fine twanging solo on Iommi's behalf. The lyrical content is ahead of its time - a precursor to our modern era's industry of X-rated web/\"kink\"-cam overlays -, also nicely paralleling Tank's \"T.W.D.A.M.O\" (That's What Dreams Are Made Of). Now, I admit I don't care much for the title track's placid lull and easy listening array of Gillan's introspections. \"Hot Line\" however, deserves an accolade if only for mimicking the downright cool \"Lady Evil\" From Heaven And Hell.\n\nThere you have it; although I was going to make Born Again my pre-requisite \"failure\" (i.e rated less than 60%) in order to establish \"street cred.\", doing so would be a little unfair considering I got a few jollies out of this browbeaten affair. Let's \"keep it warm\" by still according it a passing score. Born Again won't induce many, if any, returns, except for token reminiscence or morbid curiosity, yet, for myself, it wasn't all for naught...\n",
        "\nSabotage is Black Sabbath's last truly excellent record with the original line-up before drug abuse and personal conflicts let to a first split. Sabotage might be one of the band's gloomiest and heaviest records of all times without losing the band's eerie and psychedelic vibe. \n\nThe opening \"Hole in the Sky\" represents the record's unique style very well. Ozzy Osbourne's vocals sound a little bit more aggressive and desperate than usual and give this song a dystopian touch. The discordant mid-tempo riffs and hypnotizing rhythm section only add to this song's particular vibe. The track ends abruptly after four minutes which might be a reference to The Beatles' \"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\" and this surprising conclusion only adds to the track's scary and unpredictable atmosphere.\n\nSabotage is filled with creative twists like this one. Aggressive and fast-paced proto thrash metal as in the outstanding \"Symptom of the Universe\" meets mystic and plodding space rock with a length close to ten minutes in \"Megalomania\". I'm usually not a fan of Black Sabbath's instrumental songs that are often fillers but they are very well done on this album. \"Don't Start (Too Late)\" is a sinister folk-inspired acoustic guitar interlude that gives us a very short short break between two of Black Sabbath's heaviest tracks ever written. \"Supertzar\" is my favorite Black Sabbath instrumental because it incorporates Russian folk sounds in a very gloomy way without overusing them in a stereotypical way. This little experiment just blends in perfectly and even adds to the typical Black Sabbath sound. I could go on and talk about the other Songs but let me simply tell you that there is no filler to be found and that the different songs all have their gloomy atmosphere in common and represent the band's whole creative spectre from blues rock over folk rock to thrash metal better than any other release. \n\nTo keep it short, Black Sabbath's Sabotage manages to be both among the band's most aggressive and most atmospheric albums of all times. The band had reached a creative peak and managed to find new soundscapes that only added to its typical gloomy sound as the quartet experimented with acoustic folk sounds but also some of its heaviest riffs ever written. The band invented a sound close to thrash metal with \"Symptom of the Universe\" about a decade before this genre would actually kick off but also manages to create an appealing mixture of folk sounds and doom metal in tracks like \"Supertzar\". That's why Sabotage might be one of the most creative, diverisfied and influential records in the history of heavy metal. Anyone who listens to metal should be familiar with this classic. Along with the equally excellent but stylistically different predecessor Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, Sabotage is my favorite Black Sabbath release to this day.\n",
        "\nBlack Sabbath and heavy metal as a whole were in big trouble around 1992. After a couple of mediocre studio albums, notably Headless Cross and TYR, Sabbath fell into the \"man, they were great way back when...\" speak as well as the state of metal after grunge came in and swept their depression-rock all over the music landscape. Outside of Metallica at the time, you didn't, or in a lot of cases couldn't, put out a metal album that would take much notice.\n\nEven metal vocalist great Ronnie James Dio couldn't catch a break, playing to 3000 seat venues after playing 30,000 ones less than a decade earlier. But at one of those smaller venues former Sabbath bass great Geezer Butler visited Ronnie at one of his shows, grabbed a bass, and the two played music together after ten years apart. After speaking to only original member left guitarist Tony Iommi about the experience, it was decided that it was time again to join forces and reclaim Black Sabbath Mark II. And that result was Dehumanizer.\n\nWith the original line-up that created the classic album Mob Rules, Dehumanizer retained that metal power while ditching Ronnie's trademark \"dungeon and dragons\" lyrics with ones based upon the world of the early 90's, being the computer age \"dehumanizing\" the people that created it. The album featured amazing Iommi riffs, Dio vocals still in top form, Geezer playing with new life, and drummer Vinny Appice once again laying down the doom & boom of his powerful drumming. It was hard to believe that at the time these guys had been already recording music for over twenty years because this reunion showed them with more strength and power than ever. Well produced and still to this day as fresh as the year it was created, Dehumanizer brought Sabbath back into the spotlight and clearly shown through amidst the grunge river of the 1990's.\n\nThis reissue has got to be one of the best Black Sabbath Deluxe Editions out there. Where others have vocal-less versions of songs, some bad sounding live tracks, or a B-Side or two, Dehumanizer has 10 extra tracks, each worth your purchase. Not only do you get the alternate versions of both \"Time Machine\" & \"Letters From Earth\" (both of which I personally prefer over the ones that ended up on the album), but the single edit of \"Master Of Insanity\", and what I would like to go into with detail, the \"Sundome\" live tracks.\n\nYou see, I've been a fan of Sabbath since I could remember, but by the time I was old enough to go to concerts, it was very hard to actually see them live. The Iommi-led version of Sabbath just didn't sell enough tickets to continue an American concert tour back in the late 80/early 90's. But when the reformed Dio-era/Dehumanizer tour was announced, I was ready...and so were the fans. The concert they performed in Tampa Florida (only their second USA show on the tour) was amazing, and they played like they were twenty-feet high. It was a show worthy of a live album, and somehow my prayers were answered because when the Master Of Insanity promo CD single (Parts One & Two) came out, select tracks from my show were there! They recorded and released a total of 4 songs from University Of South Florida Sundome show. \n\nNow not only does this Deluxe Edition feature those 4 tracks, they dug up yet another, the medley of \"Master Of Insanity/After All (The Dead)\", all remastered and sound great compared to the original CD-single issue. Along with all this, is great book-like packaging with unreleased photos and new liner notes that really explain what the life of Sabbath was like back then, and what eventually led to it's way-too-quick end until the 4 would re-reunite for Heaven And Hell over another decade later. So if you're a Dio or Sabbath fan, own Heaven And Hell or Holy Diver, this album deserves your attention. It is just as important as the Dio-led 80's albums and needs to be heard in this remastered form. Worth every, single penny I paid for it, this is the Deluxe Edition of Sabbath I'll cherish the most. All Hail Black Sabbath!\n",
        "\nBlack Sabbath's inaugural reign as the undisputed emperors of heavy metal music ended in 1976, when another Birmingham contender launched their sophomore attack, titled Sad Wings of Destiny, the record that started an utmost dominion of all things metal for the Priest, lasting 'til the beginning of the next decade, a period in which Sabbath had to bow down their head to the new Iron Thro\u2026 I mean, Metal Throne ruler, before the helping hand of Ronnie James Dio put them on the map again, ready to ride the NWOBHM as if they were Miki Dora. That was not only due to Priest's amazing streak of masterpiece after masterpiece alone, but also because of Sabbath's inability to maintain the heavenly high-level quality of their first six LPs. Their number seven, released seven month's after Judas Priest's breakthrough, turned out to be bad luck for the seminal quartet, as Technical Ecstasy lacks both interesting technique or any ecstasy at all. \n\nThe Dadaist cover artwork by Hipgnosis studio is certainly as far from the Sabbath aesthetic as possible, and remains one of the weirdest and most misplaced metal album covers of all time. The concept of two robots in intercourse is not that bad in itself, but the resulting image feels more suited for a Supertramp LP than anything metal or even hard rock-ish. Hell, there are darker and meaner Pink Floyd record covers, most of which happen to be designed by Hipgnosis as well. But when one listens to the Bill Ward-sung \u201cIt's All Right\u201d, things start to make (NO FUCKING) sense between the non-Sabbath artwork and the non-Sabbath music. There are heavier Beatles songs than that, and I'm not fucking joking! It's not that Mr. Ward has a bad or unwanted voice, but the track is among the least-Sabbath (or metal) sounding they've ever put to tape. \u201cGypsy\u201d is another one in which they tried to branch out, kinda trying their hand at Queen's baroque style, a failed enterprise somewhat rescued by the ever powerful guitarwork of the riff master himself, Tony Iommi, one of the few saving graces in this, or any, Sabbath material. \n\n\u201cAll Moving Parts (Stand Still)\u201d, side B opener, tries to conjure up the Coverdale-powered spirit of that era's Deep Purple, with some scent of 'sexy' funky hard rock, but The Prince of Darkness' voice sounds totally wrong and out of place in such a composition. Surprisingly, \u201cRock 'n' Roll Doctor\u201d seems to insist with that direction, kinda anticipating the vapid glam metal that would appear half a decade into the future. What a waste of three minutes time in anyone's life! \u201cShe's Gone\u201d is a sad ballad with some orchestration, and while it pales in comparison to \u201cChanges\u201d from Vol. 4, it's a decent tune, featuring the saddened Ozzy we all like to enjoy. The two minor jewels I would consider for an Ozzy-years Best Of compilation are \u201cYou Won't Change Me\u201d and of course, their own seven-minute response to \u201cVictim of Changes\u201d, tip-top closer \u201cDirty Woman\u201d. Even if both tracks sound closer to uplifting hard rock than to their gloom and doom of old, the riffing is strong and memorable enough in those two to save the album from being an utter failure. \n\nThe band abandoned the multi-instrumental exploration of the previous two releases and decided to focus again on rock's basics, but their decision to leave metal behind for more accessible sounds cost them their personality and grandeur. Even the production is flawed, with Butler suffering a bit of neglect, the remastered album version not helping much. Not that it would make much of a difference if his presence would have been enhanced in the original mix though, as the rhythmic section is too basic, straightforward and uneventful to cause much of an impact. Ozzy's voice remain distinctive, but it\u2019s definitely not that suited for the compositions at hand, and the already mentioned Iommi shines mostly during the solos, but his riff selection for this record is not that impressive. Sadly, Never Say Die! would prove even more appalling, but as everybody knows, the second decade and second classic Sabbath lineup would bear sweetest fruit.\n",
        "\nThis \"sold at concert venues ONLY\" CD is quite the gem to the Black Sabbath fanatic like myself. When the reunited Sabbath (minus original drummer Bill Ward) got back together after Ronnie James Dio's passing and the end of Sabbath's Mark II's \"Heaven & Hell\", they could have put the phone book to music and we'd all come a runnin'. The resulting album 2013's \"13\" was an amazing album considering that they hadn't been recording together for over twenty years and guitarist Tony Iommi's lymphoma illness. Though Bill Ward's absence was definitely felt, the songs truly tried to capture the spirit of the band's first four albums. Some songs even sounded like remakes of classic tunes like Black Sabbath, Planet Caravan, and War Pigs. However, when the album came out it was released in different versions, some with only eight tracks with deluxe versions had a total of 11 and 12. It was rumored that Ozzy, Geezer and Tony actually completed a total of sixteen songs for the record, and this CD proves that.\n\nThe first four tracks on the CD are the final four that never made it to any other version of \"13\" before it. Surprisingly, each of the tracks sound as mastered and completed as anything on \"13\" (even sounding better than the Best Buy only track \"Na\u00efvet\u00e9 In Black\" which to me sounds demo-ish and somewhat incomplete). What's surprising is like the song \"Methademic\", a song that was on 13's bonus disc yet made it into their live set, the first track \"Season Of The Dead\" could have been one of Sabbath's next singles it's so good. The other three: Cry All Night, Take Me Home, and Isolated Man each have a uniqueness that have merit being on the final product as well, almost as if they planned for this release for the live shows, to leave four great tracks to sell as new a few years later. These songs are not throwaway to any Sabbath fan & must own to sit next to your copy of 13.\n\nAs if those tracks weren't enough, you get four live songs, all with incredible clarity and performance. To anyone else like me who has a copy of the live album/DVD \"Live...Gathered In Their Masses\", you already have a live version of tracks 5 & 7, but the live tracks \"Under The Sun\" and \"Age Of Reason\" are brand new to the audio front. Under The Sun (originally on Volume 4) is special because I have never heard of them playing this live before (correct me if I'm wrong), nor at least it appearing on a bootleg. Age Of Reason didn't make \"Masses\" set either, so bonus points for that too. Make no mistake, even after all these years, nobody jams live like Sabbath, and these four tunes proves that.\n\nIn the end (pun), this is a great treat for Sabbheads. I would be fooling myself if somewhere down the road, these songs as well as all 16 tracks with the live ones, end up on some deluxe version a few years from now, but for now this is the only way to have a hard copy of them. Not to be ignored if you're either an Ozzy freak or Sabbath die-hard, this rare CD is quite the treat. Thanks for reading & thanks for Sabbath!\n",
        "\nTechnical Ecstasy doesn't do its name any justice and is the weakest release of the original Black Sabbath line-up. The problem isn't necessarily that the band shifted its sound from heavy and doom metal to adapt a more blues and hard rock inspired sound. This shift actually worked rather well for this record's successor Never Say Die! that had several great tracks such as ''Johnny Blade'' and ''Junior's Eyes''. Technical Ecstasy's problem is that the songwriting is all over the place. The tracks don't sound fleshed out, the different songs don't really fit together and the record is missing a truly memorable tune. Some people say that album closer ''Dirty Women'' is an overlooked gem but I have to disagree since that song doesn't give me anything and I find it very hard to not skip any parts of it over an excruciating length of far over seven minutes.\n\nThere are a few interesting experiments to be found on this album. Interesting has to be taken literally because these songs aren't particularly great but they aren't fillers either. They are just interesting. The ballad ''She's Gone'' comes around with acoustic guitars and violin sounds that one would rather expect from Simon and Garfunkel than Black Sabbath. This elegiac song is the band's most unique ballad and one can't deny that it has a really numbing atmosphere. ''It's Alright'' is another ballad but this one is a little bit more vivid and features some piano sounds instead. Once again, it's a song one would rather expect from a hippie band but then again, all Black Sabbath members were heavily abusing drugs during the recording sessions which might explain these soundscapes. The most outstanding element about this song is that vocals are performed by drummer Bill Ward and while his voice isn't as unique as Ozzy Osbourne's psychedelic style, his vocals would perfectly fit to a blues or soft rock group or a second-rate The Beatles cover band.\n\nAside of these unusual experiments, is there at least one truly great song on this release? In my opinion, there is exactly one to be found and this track is called ''Gypsy''. I like everything about this song from the vivid percussion overture over the simple but efficient hard rock riffs underlined by uncomplicated piano sounds to the epic and melancholic chorus. The song also features Ozzy Osbourne's most inspired effort on this release since he is missing some energy in most of the other tunes. I also like the slightly mysterious and occult lyrics that recall classic Black Sabbath songwriting. Despite having different parts, the songwriting sounds coherent and fluid in this song which is exceptional by this record's low standard. Still, this song is far from being related to metal and could rather be described as melodic hard rock but it succeeds very well in this particular genre and is good for what it is.\n\nTo keep it short, Technical Ecstasy can't be recommended to fans of Black Sabbath's early doom and heavy metal soundscapes and even as a blues or hard rock record, the successor Never Say Die! sounds much more focused and fresh. Technical Ecstasy is for avid collectors only or for people who usually aren't into heavy metal and are looking for a classic seventies rock record with an authentic hippie vibe. Technical Ecstasy isn't a disaster from an objective point of view but by Black Sabbath's standards, it's not only below average but even a contender for the band's worst studio record.\n",
        "\nBlack Sabbath's Never Say Die! is a quite underrated record and at the same time the end of an era since it's the band's last output with the original line-up. Some records that followed this one were great and even better than this release but I don't really consider them Black Sabbath albums. Call me closed-minded in this particular case but Black Sabbath's unique, typical and revolutionary sound is what makes the band's first eight albums so special. Even though Never Say Die! is far from the band's best output, it's still a great and important release in the history of heavy rock and heavy metal that anyone interested in the roots of these genres should know and own.\n\nMany people criticize the record for its lack of heaviness and its sound that is overall closer to hard rock than to heavy metal but this slight change of style gives this album an own identity without denying its roots. Ozzy Osbourne's psychedelic vocals are still imperfectly perfect, Tony Iommi's riffs are as gripping and heavy as they always used to be, Geezer Butler's bass guitar work doesn't simply follow the lead guitar but has its own shining moments and shows a musician who developed his own style with each album and Bill Ward's drumming runs like clockwork and sounds much more focused than on earlier records. Especially the rhythm section delivers an outstanding job on this release while guitarist and singer are on a constant high level.\n\nThere are a few weaker cuts in the second half of the record for sure but the album has a series of highlights in the first half that make you forget about the record's downsides. The opening title song is catchy, refreshing and uplifting and surprises positively as a vivid rocker with a positive vibe that shows that the band was trying out new things on this output. ''Johnny Blade'' is a slightly more complex and epic rocker that tells one of the most intriguing stories Black Sabbath has ever told. The melancholic ''A Hard Road'' with its multiple backing vocals is a successful collaborative effort in a time when the band was already about to fall apart. My personal highlight is though ''Junior's Eyes'' which is one of the very best Black Sabbath songs ever written and an incredibly underrated gem. The song unites the strengths from the band's earliest releases and the last two albums of the original line-up. On one side, the song has gloomy lyrics and sinister bass guitar sounds but on the other side, the track is much more playful and vivid like several songs from the last two albums of the seventies with a mid-tempo guitar work and powerful and tight drumming. Other bands would have dreamed to have such a song in their repertoire but Black Sabbath didn't even play this song live as far as I'm informed. It's quite impressive that the band was able to pull off such a track despite the tension in the band and the heavy drug use beyond creative inspiration.\n\nEven some of the odder tracks in the second half have their charm. I somehow like the plodding closer ''Swinging the Chain'' where drummer Bill Ward performed vocals because Ozzy Osbourne refused to sing this song. To my surprise, Bill Ward does a solid job and would make a great singer in a blues rock band. Heavy metal purists might dislike the track just as most parts of this album but if you take this release as a hard rock or blues rock release, one has to say that it's above average and has numerous highlights despite a more vapid middle section.\n\nIn the end, there are two approaches to this album. Those who believe that Black Sabbath must play gloomy heavy or doom metal and try to compare this release to the band's first six records or anything released after the split of the original line-up, might find this record lackluster. However, if you are open to accept that the band experimented here and there and adopted a sound inspired by blues and hard rock, then you will enjoy this release. The previous record Technical Ecstasy had a similar approach but was overall very hit-and-miss. Never Say Die! sounds more experienced, focused and fresh and includes an absolute band highlight with ''Junior's Eyes'' as well as several other average to very good songs. A true stinker is nowhere to be found. I like this album for what it is and even though it isn't the perfect swansong for the original line-up, it presents a charismatic band open to experiment and break genre boundaries which has always distinguished Black Sabbath. From that point of view, Never Say Die! is a typical Black Sabbath album that might not reach the quality of some of the band's earlier works but which easily beats its predecessor.\n",
        "\nWhile I disagree with this statement, many Sabbath fans posit that the band experienced a steady decline throughout the 70s. Drugs became more integral to the band; strongly permeating into the music, and they became more experimental, leaving behind the closed minded individuals obsessed only with the doom of their early days. After Never Say Die! was released in 1978, Ozzy was thrown out of the band due to tensions between him and the other members. A year later, the band bounced back, entering the studio with Ronnie James Dio from Rainbow, and they experienced a rebirth, a career turnaround, albeit one that made perfect sense in their chronology of albums, with 1980's majestic Heaven and Hell.\n\nMusically, the band continued to modernize their sound. This is obviously with the first notes of the opener \"Neon Knights\". The track, considered a Sabbath classic, is a fast, almost speed metal song with very anthemic passages. Dio's style of vocal delivery is very different, and it practically circumscribed the band's sound. Ozzy followed the guitar lines with his voice for the most part, as heard on early numbers like \"Iron Man\". Dio, on the other hand, tends to do more extravagant things with his voice, and writes his own vocal melodies over the instrumental stuff. This makes the band seem bigger, more polyphonic, and probably more typical of the era, trading in a very small amount of their character. Dio writes the lyrics here, and unlike Geezer, who wrote most of the Ozzy era lyrics, his words deal more with fantasy as a metaphor for philosophical stuff than darkness, death, and doom. Again, slightly alters the personality of the band, but this is still typical Sabbath at the same time.\n\nMusically and technically, this is quite different from what Black Sabbath had been doing prior. There is less experimentation, meaning less psychedelic stuff, autoharps etc. and more contemporary metal structuring. This, this album is less innovative than something like Sabbath Bloody Sabbath or Sabotage. Mostly, this is a very guitar driven album wuth s one great riffs, some very in line by the NWOBHM movement of the time. This is heard the most in the punkish \"Die Young\", arguably the epitome of Heaven and Hell. That said, Tony Iommi does an excellent job of allowing his own style to bleed into a different style of riffing. He has stepped into another dimension with his lead work. He shreds a lot here, something I had no idea he was capable of doing until I heard his later stuff. He employs a lot less of the pentatonic blues stuff in favor of more technical work. It sounds great and really fits the style of this album.\n\nSome of these tracks have acquired a bad name amongst metalheads, because they express more of what Dio was doing prior to his joining Black Sabbath than what 'the Sab' had been doing. These songs include the fucking awesome \"Lady Evil\", \"Wishing Well\", the overly upbeat \"Walk Away\", and the bluesy closer \"Lonely is the World\". Some of these tracks, \"Wishing Well\" especially, resonate more with the \"cutesy' nature of Elf than they do with Sabbath's evil style. \"Walk Away\" is the downfall of this album, and honestly, I do not like it at all. Nothing against Billy Squier, but this sounds like him, completely out of place with its overly brisk, laid back sound. Conversely, there are also some great songs adored by most fans here, especially \"Die Young\". This song is the essence of the power of mid-period Black Sabbath, with its excellent synth work, and heroic, epic speed metal sound. This one is very indicative of what Dio brought to the band. Other great moments include both the powerful chorus riff and beautiful acoustic Medieval outro of the seven minute title track and the creepy lyrics of \"Lady Evil\".\n\nI think that Heaven and Hell is a huge, pre-emptive \"fuck you\" to the \"No Black Sabbath past Ozzy\" crowd, and it proves how adaptive the band were in incorporating a new, very different vocalist into their lineup. This is a great album, an essential.\n",
        "\nParanoid. The 1970 Black Sabbath second album that not only exploded them into heavy metal icons but single-handedly created the music genre as well. Nearly every single metal fan from all generations have experienced it and probably will never be topped or repeated in success. Hard to believe not one, but three all-time classic tunes came from this one album: War Pigs, Iron Man, and of course the song they wrote last minute just to fill up the album's length, Paranoid.\n\nThis album has been released and reissued more times than one can count. Just recently, Paranoid (along with other Sabbath classics) got the 2 CD deluxe treatment back in 2009. Now, we have this, the Super Deluxe Box Set, this time with four complete discs of music, and extra swag to boot. But is it overkill? Too much of a good thing? The answer is no, but a little yes as well.\n\nFor only thirty or so dollars, you get four discs with a '70 tour program, a hard-cover book full of new interviews, pictures, & insight, and a full sized poster of the band from this era, all contained in a heavy-duty box to hold it all. Each of the albums come housed in a LP reproduction slipcovers that have each disc in a paper protector inside the sleeve just like the old days of vinyl. But it's what's on these discs that make it a worthy purchase or not.\n\nLet's skip to disc two, the 1974 quad mix of the album. This is a rarity for Sabb fans. But because CD is only 2 channels, you aren't actually getting the 4 channel Quad Mix like in '74. What you get here is what would have come out of your back speakers, with the original album coming out of the front two. Still with a very different mix, with additions and subtractions to the existing music, it's quite a treat, while never, ever replacing your main mix album. Great to have, but really not that essential.\n\nBut where you stop questioning your purchase is with discs three and four. Two concerts from 1970 right before Paranoid came out and before Sabbath made their first American appearance, This is the true reason you bought this set! One concert from Montreux and one from Brussels. Now the Brussels disc has been widely bootlegged for years. This is the one that was misnoted as being from \"Paris\". You've seen the video on various Sabbath specials and even Ozzy's \"God Bless Ozzy Osbourne\", but you have never, and I mean never heard it sound this good. From the moment I pressed play I was shocked at it's fidelity and clarity. After decades of listening to the boot of this, I can now toss that away forever. In fact, most of this recording ended up on disc two of Black Sabbath's Past Lives release (with added crowd noise), but that too sounds like mud compared to this. In fact, it's also more complete than any boot/Past Lives recordings, with more Ozzy chatting and tune-ups (sorry no more songs though). The Montreux show is also of excellent quality, with Ozzy's young voice so clear, you'll turn your head thinking he's right there in your living room. Two greats shows, with alternate lyric versions of Iron Man, Hand Of Doom, and even the \"Walpurgis\" version of War Pigs and incredible sound that I still can't believe they were able to remaster with what they were working with. I personally would have paid thirty bucks for these two discs alone. Again, they are the true reason why you should buy this set.\n\nAs for the main disc one, the original album, yes it sounds great. With volume levels at a proper, yet not crushing level, it puts the 2009 studio version to shame. While \"The Black Box\" 2002 version comes close, this one has even more clarity and body. If you ever looked for a definitive version, this one is it, though I believe this remaster is available as a single disc release now too.\n\nBelieve it or not, I do have one issue about it that I'm going to share with you. You see, for one album to have the title \"Super Deluxe\", it still seems to be missing something. For one, the 2009 2CD re-release had a second disc of eight tracks featuring instrumental and alternate vocal takes of the songs from Paranoid. Interesting stuff, but it's NOT part of this release! And also, when you read the informative book included with \"Super\" you'll notice many quotes taken from all the band members as well as former managers and engineers from a 2010 home DVD/Blu-Ray release from the \"Classic Albums\" series. This disc too is MIA from this box set. You'd figure that by the name alone you wouldn't have to make three different purchases to have a truly complete collection of the Paranoid album, but sadly if you really want it all, that's what you'll have to do.\n\nIn the end, this still is one incredible box set for one incredible, ground breaking, genre creating, album. Hopefully others in Sabbath's library will also get the same treatment (Master Of Reality, anyone?), but this was the obvious starting point. With such a low price you can't really go wrong with this, and again, the live discs are just too good to pass up (did I mention outside of bootlegs, \"Super\" is the only way to get them?). So go back to 1970 and revisit the greatest heavy metal album of all time. And this time in style! Oh Lord Yeah!\n",
        "\nYowzer! I shamefully admit I never gave Black Sabbath's Mob Rules from 1981 a proper listen until now and must admit I'm rocked out of my gourd! Sort of an extension of Heaven And Hell, this Dio fronted classic is currently dominating my headspace. Allow me to elaborate without getting too far ahead of myself and looking like a fool (which, granted, I am having waited this long to give it the praise and respect it deserves. Then again, \"If you listen to fools, the Mob rules!\").\n\nRight away, a special thanks must be extended to Night Demon for its recent yowling cover of \"Turn Up The Night\" (the Ventura, CA natives sure have a thing for \"Night\" themed openers i.e. their namesake track from its initial EP, \"Screams In The Night\" from Curse Of The Damned and the jangling \"Welcome To The Night\" from its wicked sophomore release, Darkness Remains) as it put me on the right track. Without missing a beat, this compelling \"feel good\" opener possesses the same hard-rocking vibe as Heaven And Hell's \"Neon Knights\" thanks to its congenial, meat & potatoes straight-forwardness and Tony Iommi's furiously twangy barn burner of a solo. Along with Ronnie James Dio's expedient vocal delivery, the listener instantly knows Mob Rules is a major step up from the Ozzy fronted head-scratchers, Technical Ecstasy\" and \"Never Say Die\" (whose title track surpasses by far the travesty which is \"Backstreet Kids\").\n\n\"Voodoo\" is a new and improved version of Never Say Die's \"Swinging The Chain\" while \"The Mob Rules\" and \"Slipping Away\" retain a sure-fire honky tonk vibe thanks to Iommi's Lynyrd Skynyrd-ish hard-rocking blues riffs and Dio's sardonically cheerful chanting on the former, which includes unforced, slap-happy drumming on behalf of Bill Ward's replacement, the as-competent Vinnie Appice. As for Geezer Butler, his bass playing is chill yet expressive as usual while retaining a thick, meaty tone. In fact, his hunky dory, \"slippery\" bass solo on \"Slipping Away\" is a nice surprise as it shows he can deftly manoeuvre without making one feel pummelled by way of sheer obliqueness. \n\nDefinitely worth mentioning is how Iommi's soloing on these tracks matches the fire and intensity of \"Turn Up The Night\". I have to say, his lead work on both \"Heaven And Hell\" and \"The Mob Rules\", while just as invigorating, is much less dark as well as more technical than on say, Sabbath's flurry of 70s releases where it distinctly sounds evil and twisted. Here, the excitement level is the same minus the doom and gloom.\n\nOh! one track which surpassed my expectations is the cornily titled \"Country Girl\". Genial in its simplicity and warmth, it's one heck of a rock steady pseudo-ballad, sure to put a smile on your face. It's probably my preferred track lyrics wise.\n\nInstances I could do without are the \"FX\" (Volume 4) like \"E5150\" - which leaves me flummoxed in spite of its well-meaning spacey ambiance - and the ex-tenuous first half of the studio version to \"The Mob Rules\". While \"Falling Off The Edge Of The World\" also gets off to a slow start, it's redeemed once Iommi's revolving riff and still-hot soloing comes into play. It's not my go-to track (this would be \"Turn Up The Night\" of course!) but still respectable in its own right. The same goes for the brooding epic \"The Sign Of The Southern Cross\", which beautifully alternates between acoustic interludes and electric meandering without altering its tempo. It's the kind of track which simply reels the listener in, freezing them in place as its melancholic spell takes hold. If this relatively obscure (to me anyways) release fails to attain 90%, it's mainly because of the lackadaisical closer \"Over And Over\", which at least brought my heart rate/ pulse down to a reasonably safe level. Dio's slightly operatic crooning here verges on mundane although thankfully Iommi comes to the rescue with his final well-poised and touching leads. \n\nWhile the uncharacteristically moribund album art wins no favours from me, The Mob Rules is highly worth checking out for Ozzy-era Sabbath fans who, as I, allowed it to unceremoniously \"slip away\" from their grasp. Highly recommended for both its cool musicianship and evoked nostalgia.\n\n\"Fell in love with a country girl, morning sunshine\nShe was up from a nether world, just to bust another soul\nHer eyes were an endless flame, holy lightning\nDesire with a special name, made to snatch your soul away, yeah\n\nWe sailed away on a crimson tide, gone forever\nLeft my heart on the other side, all to break it into bits\nHer smile was a winter song, a Sabbath ending\nDon't sleep or you'll find me gone, just an image in the air\"\n",
        "\nBlack Sabbath Live At Hammersmith Odeon was quite the treat to commemorate the release of Black Sabbath's 2007 best of album \"The Dio Years\", as well as the 2007 world tour featuring the classic Dio/Iommi/Butler/Appice line-up, rechristened Heaven And Hell. Recorded during the 1981 Mob Rules tour (the exact same tour that provided us Live Evil), this recording takes the best versions of those performed songs from three out of the four Hammersmith Odeon sold-out concerts between December 31st 1981 through January 2nd 1982 and compiles them seamlessly as one glorious presentation. Even though this was released and sold-out as a numbered limited edition of only 5000 copies on May 1st 2007, and went out of print on its first official release day, it was eventually repackaged with the 2010 deluxe 2 CD edition of Mob Rules. But is it worth the purchase, especially if you already own Live Evil?\n\nActually, this CD is more than I ever could have hoped for as a life-long Black Sabbath fan. I probably didn't even have this recording before as a bootleg (I don't recognize it audio-wise). Rhino majorly cleaned up this recording. True soundboard, remastered excellently, in fact it might even be better than Live Evil....well maybe that's pushing it, but its way up there. And it\u2019s long too at 79:52! And with two rarely heard live tracks, Country Girl & Slipping Away, as well as Iommi's shortened solo, makes this so worthwhile to add to your collection. Even Dio on this one says \"Piss off, I'm gonna burn in Hell with all of you!\" instead of the usual \"Go Away, I'm gonna burn in Hell...\". I've got a lot of \u201cHeaven And Hell\u201d live performances with Dio & he never said it like that before! I do wish they did the entire \"Slipping Away\", instead of going to the drum solo in the middle. That part where Tony & Geezer trade licks on the studio version is great live, I do have a boot of them doing it in full somewhere, but just not on here like that. It's just too bad they stopped doing \"Sweet Leaf\" live by this time too, the only other Ozzy-era track they did live with Dio, that would have been the cherry on top. Oh well, you can't have it all.\n\nConcerning though the battle between Black Sabbath fans, \"Which live album is better: Hammersmith or Live Evil?\", truthfully Live At The Hammersmith Odeon is a great addition to any Sabbhead's library, but it's not as essential as Live Evil. First off, Live Evil is classic due to its 35 year old existence (wow, has it been that long!). If Hammersmith came out in 1982, then Live Evil in 2007, maybe. But that's not the case. Second, Live Evil is a fuller representation of a complete Black Sabbath concert, LATHO is not. Let me explain. When Castle Communications reissued/remastered Live Evil in 1996, they edited out things like Ronnie banter, crowd noise, and some of Tony's solo to make it fit on one disc, instead of the original two. LATHO was done in the same way. Don't believe me, think about it, how long is the crowd applause in between the tracks....it's two or three seconds each...that's not realistic. You mean Ronnie didn't talk to the audience at those shows between songs? C'mon. And Iommi didn't do a full blown eight minute plus solo either? Sure they did, Rhino Handmade just edited it out from the master to make it fit on one disc, while Live Evil was always meant to be a two record/two CD release, hence as much filler as possible resulting in a complete show, solos, banter, crowd, and all. But don't get me wrong, LATHO has some of the best editing I've EVER heard on a live recording! But the editing is quite apparent to fans like me with a ton of boots in our collections already. But trust me, in a way it's sorta nice to get to the point with this recording, compared to times when I have to wait 30 seconds or more to get to the next song on Live Evil (LATHO's editing is way better than what Sanctuary Records did on Disc Two of Sabbath's Past Lives CD), but the average fan will never notice, but to most of us Sabbheads it's apparent pretty early on, yet completely acceptable due to the quality it was done here.\n\nFinally, Live Evil was recorded in the intent of a worldwide audio release, LATHO was not. It's more as a library recording for the band and management. Even though the remaster job on LATHO is excellent, you can tell that the instruments weren't \u201cmic'd up\u201d for that purpose. Also, some parts of LATHO wouldn't cut it for a major/first live representation of a band like Sabbath (I'd doubt Iommi would like to relive the drama of \"Live At Last\" again). The feedback during \u201cN.I.B.\u201d, the \"trying to get the girl in the front row to sing Heaven And Hell and failing\", and other bits like that show this is basically for collectors only, hence why it premiered on Rhino Handmade at only 5000 copies first (and not on Rhino's main label at your local store in millions), and ended up as the \u201cbonus\u201d disc of the deluxe version of Mob Rules. But it is exciting as the day it was performed and again shows just how powerful Black Sabbath Mark II actually was.\n\nSo in conclusion, LATHO is a great addition to the ever growing live Black Sabbath library. Excellent sound and mixing, the more varied set-list, and some of the best remastering you\u2019re going to hear in a long time. While it won\u2019t make any Sabbath freak throw away their copy of \u201cLive Evil\u201d in a metal garbage can, it will look nice sitting right next to it on your Sabbath CD hall of fame. And now that it\u2019s been re-released with Mob Rules, the search for it has gotten a lot easier. Thanks for reading & all hail the Sabbath!\n",
        "\nThere have been a lot of Black Sabbath albums over the years and - let's face it - some of them have been spoken about less than others. Such is Tyr. Dwelling in the Sabbathian obscurity of the Tony Martin era, with Tony Iommi the only original member, and sounding little like their famous early output, it might not be a surprise that this has been swept under the carpet, though it doesn't make it any less of a shame, because Tyr is very good. Just to qualify that statement for anyone with Master of Reality halfway into the rubbish bin, it isn't really an important album in terms of developing new ideas and pushing the genre forwards, though it's a great example of epic metal done in an altogether inspiring and memorable manner.\n\nCalling this epic metal does a considerable service to Tony Martin's vocals, though he is more than happy to return the favour in our direction and sounds like a bigger Dio (I guess everyone was bigger actually) with his pants set on fire and fairly similar themes to sing about. He's got that same sort of timeless mid-range that makes everything sound like the opening of an old book, yet he never goes over the top even when he's belting out the chorus of 'Valhalla' or 'Jerusalem', both of which sound fucking great. We get lots of lyrics about what I'll term \"old stuff\", such as a stone circle ('The Sabbath Stones'), some kind of war (I'm not sure if 'Anno Mundi' is historical, but the title's in Latin so that counts), and of course Vikings (on 'Odin's Court' and 'Valhalla') The exception is 'Feels Good to Me', which is a slight oddball in such a set of fantasy and history songs, although doesn't totally spoil the mood that is set up by the atmospheric lyrics and the efforts of the rest of the band. And this is definitely a band effort, Iommi turning in great memorable riffs in almost every song and some tasty solo work, while Geoff Nicholls make an important contribution with keyboards that don't overwhelm the music but carefully control the quieter moments and make the dramatic ones truly bombastic. If you feel like checking the credentials of the rhythm players, 'The Sabbath Stones' is the place to do so, the pace dropping and other instruments allowing them room to build drama by way of Cozy Powell's tom hits and Neil Murray's elegant backing basslines.\n\nTyr is not all about atmosphere either, so anyone who has read comments about this sounding light can relax a little and, as long as the volume is turned up, rock out as well. 'The Law Maker' is the paciest track here, racing off on a storm of soloing and packing a little speed/power influence, while the doom fans are sure to be content with 'The Sabbath Stones' and 'Anno Mundi', despite the tendency of the latter to go more into epic doom territory. I find a comparison which returns to my mind frequently is that of Candlemass's Chapter VI, which is in fact a very similar kind of album, transforming the Swedes' heraldic doom into a more mainstream, doom/power hybrid. The \"Valhalla suite\" is a great composition as well, beginning with the keyboard intro 'The Battle of Tyr' that morphs into the impassioned acoustic 'Odin's Court' and finally explodes in the bombastic 'Valhalla', which adopts a healthy fast-medium pace to kick the doors down in the excellent second half of the album. 'Feels Good to Me' is probably the most commercial effort on this release that again builds through acoustic verses to a powerful slow riff in the chorus, yet it is 'Heaven in Black' that brings proceedings to a storming close with what I consider Black Sabbath's greatest chorus, a searing energy possessing Martin as he rides high on Iommi's irresistible riffing.\n\nFor such a compact album as Tyr, there is a lot of material to explore here, with clear progressive elements guiding the songwriting on several of the songs, though never causing any stagnation in the free flow of riffs and enjoyable rhythm work. Personally, I'm not much of a fan of acoustic songs but freely admit that 'Odin's Court' is a worthy example of how to do it right despite the fact that 'Feels Good to Me' irks me just a bit from being much longer, mainly comtemplatively acoustic, and just missing the same epic feel as the rest of the material. That makes it rather plain in comparison to the richness of the other songs, something that cannot be said of 'The Sabbath Stones', which has so many changes that some of it amounts to farting around. Nevertheless, the vast majority of the material on Tyr is strong not only in Sabbath's discography but in the combined fields of doom, power, and epic traditional metal, while the weaker songs are not bad by any means. If you want to listen to some straight up quality music, forget who Black Sabbath are and just stick this straight in your player - you can't go far wrong.\n",
        "\nRecently I purchased (or actually re-re-re-purchased) one of my top twenty-five favorite albums of all time, Black Sabbath's eleventh studio album 1983's Born Again. Considered by most to be Sabbath's last \"classic\" album, this pairing of the original band's musical line-up (the last to feature drummer Bill Ward) with the vocal powerhouse of Deep Purple's Ian Gillan, has got to be one of the most interesting moments in Sabbath's family tree. After the exit of Ronnie James Dio and Vinny Appice to solo stardom, Iommi & Butler were in quite a fix. To lose an original vocalist like Ozzy Osbourne and come back as strong as they did with Dio afterwards, this was one hard act to follow. So the pressure was on to create a new line-up that could compete with the past, while staying current in the heavy metal early 80's. And they did with Born Again.\n\nTo me and many others of my generation, this is Sabbath's heaviest & most evilest albums. Epic on a huge scale (much like started on Mob Rules), the sound and material make them seem 20 feet tall performing it. However, when it was released a lot of fans didn't know what to make of it. For many, the crossing of Purple and Sabbath was too much to take. But as time progressed, a lot of fans who grew up to become music makers themselves of the thrash & death metal genres, took Born Again over all else as their Sabbath. Tracks like \"Zero The Hero\", \"Trashed\", and \"Disturbing The Priest\" carried such an evil vibe that it influenced those genres like how the Ozzy/Dio years did to heavy metal. From start to finish, despite it's strange bass-like final mix, it is a metal masterpiece. As a lifelong Black Sabbath fan, my favorite band, it is my 4th favorite BS album, only behind Mob Rules, Master Of Reality, and Sabotage.\n\nAs for this deluxe version, it is truly a great version of the album to own. Strangely, it is the only album in Sabb's line-up that still doesn't have a CD release in America (Seventh Star finally came to the US in 2015). Sadly though, it's not perfect. For one, the Sabs always desired re-mixing the album to give it a sound different from it's cluttered state it's been in since '83, but the master tapes at this time couldn't be located and a remaster from the original mix was done. While it sounds great, apparently the \"loudness war patrol\" fans got the last laugh because to be honest, it's very low in overall volume. While I didn't want it's peaks and valleys to be crushed, it could have been brought up more than what it is. I even own the Castle remaster from the 90's and it's volume is at a proper level. But then again, most of us will buy this for the bonus disc...\n\nWith disc two you get two unreleased studio tracks: an extended version of \"Stonehenge\" that honestly won't have you desiring that version from the edited one on the album (it's a little too long for an intro) and \"The Fallen\", a song that was left off but I'm not sure why, it's great and fits the album nicely. Then comes the live concert portion, nine songs from The Reading Festival that show just how powerful this version of the band was live. Gillan handling the Ozzy material, especially the song \"Black Sabbath\", are fresh and new evil ways to look at the classics, while the material from Born Again rock harder than ever. This second disc, unlike other Sabbath deluxe versions, should be one of the main reasons to purchase this if you already own the Castle remaster too. It's worth it.\n\nWith a great liner-notes booklet, featuring lyrics, the original tourbook, and pictures even I have never seen, this is one nice package. Granted, I wish the audio was louder, but it still jams like it's 1983. Recommended to anyone who ever was or is a Sabbath freak, Born Again is an important, yet short lived, moment in Sabbath history. All hail the Sabbath!\n",
        "\nThere have been plenty of purists who thought Black Sabbath should have changed their name to something else after Ozzy was fired. Considering this was the same band that got horrendously fucked over by management and record companies to the point where they wrote a couple of songs about it, there's no way in hell they were going to tempt fate anymore than absolutely necessary, and I seriously doubt any musician critics would have had the balls to do the same under the indignant fat of Warner Bros & Don Arden.\n\nWith that being said, this is not a Black Sabbath album. I've heard some people call this a Dio album except the concept of Dio was never a thing until after the man left Black Sabbath, even though this does contain alot of his ideas and trademarks. So really this is a Rainbow album, featuring Tony Iommi on guitars, Bill Ward on drums etc. etc. Granted you could argue that Never Say Die and even Technical Ecstasy didn't sound like Black Sabbath either, but they were also the sound of a band choking on fumes.\n\nThat said is it a bad album? Fuck no! But it's not exactly perfect either. Most of my complaints have to do with side 2 is uneven as hell and having some bad songs that these Ozzy haters would take Sabbath or Ozzy solo to the gallows for featuring. The worst of which is a turd called Walk Away. Never mind the fact that the riff sounds like it was rejected by Sammy Hagar for being too stupid, this contains the lyric \"Lord, she's handsome.\" People give Ronnie shit for his lyrics, and this is one of those times where its warranted. Women are never \"handsome,\" Ronnie. \"She\" should never ever be used as a pronoun for that word, there's also no real evidence about this song being about a transsexual either, so that's a double fail. The other offending song is Wishing Well, which sounds like it was leftover from the Never Say Die sessions. You'd think Tony would have learned the lesson of scrapping everything from that abortion. And this is a song that opens the second side of the album! I always skip from Heaven & Hell to Die Young, and I think that song works much better as a side opener anyway with its moody atmosphere. I'd be a little more lenient if Die Young and Lonely Is The Word were right next to each other, rather than having to involve periodic use of the skip button.\n\nOne other weakness of this album is Bill Ward. There is plenty of evidence showing Bill was not happy with Ozzy's departure, to the point where he's claimed he doesn't even remember recording the album. Judging from his extremely sparse playing I wouldn't be surprised to hear he didn't record it at all. The only remotely interesting things he does here is a double time snare drum charge that kicks off the climax of the title track, along with a 32-note hi-hate shuffle in the middle in the middle of Die Young. Compounding that with the drug debilitation and alcoholism he was suffering, the truth is Bill was falling short of the lofty standard he set in the 70s. There's a reason why they brought in Vinnie Appice for the reunion rather than try and work things out.\n\nWith all that being said, when Heaven & Hell is on, it is fucking ON! Some of the best songs of Sabbath and especially Dio's career were recorded on here. Most of them are the ones we all know about; Children of the Sea, Neon Knights and the mile-wide menhir that is the title track. Side A is about as perfect of a side as one can get. Even Lady Evil, if Rainbow fans loved songs like Starstruck and LA Connection I don't see what they can't love this one. While I do think Ronnie is a bit overrated as to how much he widened the bands sonic scope (if he had this great range why couldn't he sing Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, Symptom of the Universe or Megalomania on the Heaven & Hell or Mob Rules tours?), his songwriting meshed with Tony Iommi's like peanut butter and chocolate. This is exactly where Long Live Rock & Roll should have picked up (I didn't mean the Rainbow comparisons as negatives you know) and hell if someone were to slip some of the songs here into a Rainbow playlist I wouldn't hold it against them at all.\n\nIf you love heavy metal, there's no reason you shouldn't own this. I just don't quite agree with everyone when they say this is Dio's finest and most essential work with Black Sabbath. Incidentally, Dio would go on to make an album with Sabbath that actually sounded like the doom crunch from the 70s that we all craved. But that's another review for another day.....\n\nRecommended Tracks:\nChildren of the Sea\nLonely Is The Word\nHeaven & Hell\n",
        "\nLive... Gathered in Their Masses isn't only Black Sabbath's live reunion release but could also be the legend's last live record ever. If that last option were to be the case, the British heavy metal icons would leave on a high note. Recorded live in Melbourne, Australia, this release portrays a band that clearly enjoys itself on stage. Many people have criticized the band to have come back for the money but it seems obvious to me that the main factor for the band's return has been its will to play live for its fans one last time and have a great time. Mission accomplished.\n\nThe band sounds nearly as tight as it did in the seventies and later on during its first reunion in the nineties. Ozzy Osbourne is an outstanding entertainer and knows how to communicate with a crowd even though some of his speeches are predictable and even if he messes up some of the lyrics here and there as his vocals aren't always able to follow. He still gives his very best and his enthusiasm is simply contagious. Nothing compares to Tony Iommi's precise slow-motion riffs that manage to sound both meandering and to the point at the same time. He hasn't lost any of his skills despite his age and health issues. Geezer Butler has always been the silent force in Black Sabbath and his gloomy bass guitar play harmonizes perfectly with Tony Iommi's sinister riffs. His bass guitar play makes Tony Iommi's distinctive style sound more grounded and accessible. Since Bill Ward didn't join the band for this reunion, this live album features American drummer Tommy Clufetos who has played with artists and groups such as Alice Cooper, Ted Nugent and Rob Zombie in the past. I don't really get why Brad Wilk wasn't brought in who has played the drums on Black Sabbath's last studio album but Tommy Clufetos does a really great job on the drums as he plays them very precisely and tightly. Even though he looks like a hippie and is only half as old as the other band members, which looks slightly awkward on stage, his playing style blends in perfectly.\n\nThe production of this live release is quite good. It actually sounds live and we get to hear all the small mistakes that make such a record an authentic document. All instruments and the vocals are perfectly audible. The audience isn't the most enthusiastic I have seen but is still audible at the right moments.\n\nThe set list offers a solid mixture of the band's numerous classics and a few new tracks. There's no need to introduce the former as the tense build-up of the opening ''War Pigs'', the distinctive bass play of ''N.I.B.'' and the almost thrashing heaviness of ''Symptom of the Universe'' still work as perfectly as they did four decades earlier. Some of the latter tracks were only played during this first part of the tour. The rhythmic ''Loner'' is one of my favorite tunes from the band's last studio record and even though Ozzy Osbourne's vocals sound slightly out of focus at times, the track works quite well in concert. The opening riff is really dominating and the rhythm section grinds slowly but ferociously through the song. It's sad that the band dropped this cool tune from its set list later on. The concert even features a rare live rendition of ''Methademic'', which was only included as a bonus track on some limited editions of the last studio album. In my opinion, the band should have put that record's four different bonus tracks plus the four unused tunes which were later on released on the group's final EP ''The End'' together for another studio album. ''Methademic'' is a great and dynamic tune that sounds much better than many regular tracks on the last studio record. It's great that the band realized this song's potential and performed it live for a limited time. Last record's lead single ''God Is Dead?'' is also performed live and I really like this gloomy track with its epic build-up and meandering structure. In my opinion, it's on the same level as several classic epics such as ''War Pigs''. Only the dragging ''End of the Beginning'' sounds a little bit too much inspired by the band's early classics without adding anything new to the group's distinctive sound. It's still a good song but the only one that isn't close to perfection on this great set list.\n\nThis release is available in numerous editions. Only the limited box set including a Blu-ray, two DVDs and one disc includes some additional footage aside of the main concert. We get three additional live tracks from the early years as well as some interview and show day footage. This bonus material should have been included on any edition in my opinion because it doesn't make much sense to buy both the Blu-ray and the DVD version of the same concert in my book. The CD version of the show is also far from being perfect because it only includes two thirds of the actual show. The band should have released the entire set with the three bonus live tracks on two discs to offer some value for money for those who only want to hear and not necessarily see the show.\n\nAside of the lack of bonus material and the unfair release strategy of the different editions, Black Sabbath's Live... Gathered in Their Masses captures a band that still enjoys itself on stage and knows how to deliver an entertaining show. The reason why regular and occasional fans should purchase this even if they already own other Black Sabbath live records is the fact that the set list of this concert includes four new tracks, including three songs that work particularly well as they expand and respect Black Sabbath's heritage.\n",
        "\nOh, what an anomaly this album is in the grand Sabbath catalog as a whole. It did not bode well for the album since the very beginning of its own inception. The previous year, 1994, Tony Iommi had successfully united Black Sabbath (except Ozzy Osbourne) with Tony Martin at the helm, and they were even planning on recording an album together... however all that fell apart pretty quickly again. Also, we're in the decade of grunge; not a very favorable time for an old metal act such as Black Sabbath. To renew themselves the record company contacted Ernie C and Ice-T from the infamous rap metal group Body Count to help with production as well as guidelining the songs themselves, but during the recording of the album an eerie feeling is in the air as Tony Iommi looks into a reunion with Ozzy Osbourne. \n\nPretty chaotic circumstances if you ask me and indeed it sounds like a recipe for disaster. But did everything turn out as bad as people would think? I'd like to say no, and here's why!\n\nOverall this album is an aggressive beast in its very essence and it takes the brooding and raw feel from Cross Purposes up an extra notch. Compare it to Headless Cross and Tyr and you may even call it incredibly simple, which it definitely is! We have easy going and fun rocking riffs that charge forward like an angry bull, just ready to make you rock your head off. For that reason the songs also worked so very well live as the energy was there from the get-go. The prime example of the album's nature is in truth the song Get A Grip. The song in structure is very reminiscent of I Witness off of Cross Purposes: not a lot of fancy over-the-top stuff, but a very sure and steady track. To top if off the album was recorded in mere weeks (compared to the months it usually took), and supposedly Tony Martin used the first take for his vocal recordings for every song: quick and easy out the door into the public.\n\nThe album does branch out of its simplicity however and it includes a lot of elements that suit Tony Iommi's optimal playing styles: this album is essentially all about him, for good measure. Tony Martin sings for his life, but does not achieve the heights on previous albums, Neil Murray is hidden away in the mix and Cozy Powell's drumming was ruined by Ernie C (that wanted him to play more modernly). All we have left is a Tony Iommi that frantically riffs away constantly as well as throwing in up to three solos in many of the songs. So if you're a big Iommi fan then this album should not be too shabby for you. Iommi really gets to shine on the heavy blues track Sick And Tired that screams desperation and sadness: a theme that is very much present through the entire album. Also the closing song Kiss of Death shows us a complex and dramatic composition previously seen on When Death Calls and The Sabbath Stones. A perfect way to end the album in my opinion, as you hear the faint clocks ticking away at the end: a symbol of the end of the Tony Martin era.\n\nLyrically this album, as previously mentioned, drives around themes such as frustration, anger, sadness, betrayal. Often I've thought that this is Tony Martin finally breaking down from the backstabbing he's suffered throughout his time in the band. He never quite knew when he was in or when he was out, and as soon as the Forbidden tour finished the phone just stopped ringing. He was never officially fired from the band. Food for thought in my opinion. His desperation is very clear in the title track, Forbidden, where he wails and screams about trying to understand what it is he's done wrong. It is also said that a lot of the lyrics from this album were never actually written down on paper. Tony Martin just improvised them as he went along in the studio and sang what came to his mind. Some might call this unprofessional, but I feel there is something heavily artistic about it: he got the raw message out as well as his pure emotions. He didn't sugar coat the lyrics as he usually did on previous albums which makes the impact of the core messages more apparent. \n\nPeople always criticized the artwork and that I will never understand. I feel it is badass! It connects so well from back to front and has some cool cartoonish imagery that sort of reminds me of what was done on Sabbath Bloody Sabbath. I always felt that a lot of the covers from the Tony Martin era became a bit too staged and forgettable (especially on The Eternal Idol. Yuck). But here it comes forth very memorable and gloomy as the album naturally also is. \n\nProduction wise... well, we all knew this was coming. It does not suck, and in fact I think it is decent, but it is not how a Sabbath record should have sounded. Had Ernie C done this to his own Body Count albums it would've rocked! Because it has this punk-ish simplicity to it that their sound just embodies by trademark. But even though this Sabbath album is easy-going and simple it still needs this delicate sound that the Tony Martin era stuff previously had. The sound does not fit the songs or their nature and it comes across rather painful on some tracks: especially Rusty Angels where the chorus sounds like a muddy pile of mush when in fact it is composed by beautiful and harmonic arpeggios. Better luck next time, Ernie!\n\nForbidden did flop in the end and is probably the Sabbath album that has sold the fewest of copies worldwide. It was conceived in an unfortunate time and set of events that partially is Tony Iommi's own fault for trying to make two versions of Sabbath work at the same time. He ended up tripping over the project and for many it stands as a stain on the whole career. However, the truth is that the album is not bad. It has a lot of good moments and elements that would've made a hit record had the band atmosphere been more friendly and calm, and if they had taken just a little longer time polishing and finishing up the album: as well as sticking it to the company and throwing out Ernie C to find a more suited producer. Tony Iommi has said he will be remastering this when he has time, so when that day comes then maybe the album will find some justice amongst the regular fans and not just the hardcore ones.\n",
        "\nThe mighty Sabbath found themselves in the middle of the 80\u2019s with not much to offer to the growing competition. Ronnie James Dio (R.I.P.) left after two albums and a live performance, and the stunt with Ian Gillan wasn\u2019t exactly the rebirth the guys were envisaging. Little by little the Sabbath ship was abandoned by everyone save for Tony Iommi, of course. To put an insult to injury, the Ozzy solo career nearly hit the stratosphere after \u201cThe Ultimate Sin\u201d, leaving his old comrades far behind\u2026\n\nNot an enviable situation at all to the point that even Iommi started thinking about embarking on a solo career rather than riding a half-dead horse in a humiliating semi-gallop through the very competitive 80\u2019s. Easier done than said, and the man found himself one day surrounded by luminaries like the singer Glenn Hughes, another Deep Purple representative, the Kiss drummer Eric Singer, and the relatively unknown at the time Dave Spitz, the brother of Anthrax\u2019s Dan Spitz. The material was ready just waiting for someone to hit the \u201cPlay\u201d button\u2026 with one small difference, though: Warner Bros., the label in charge, didn\u2019t want to release the album under the Iommi moniker. They wanted to capitalize on Black Sabbath\u2019s fame, whatever was left of it at the time, so this had to become another Sabbath album\u2026\n\nI guess Iommi didn\u2019t have much of a choice, except for the cover art probably, and the album reviewed here has been a part of his main band\u2019s discography for over 30 years now. It\u2019s a public secret that it doesn\u2019t possess the trademark dark doomy vibe of the older works, and as such hasn\u2019t been very warmly accepted by the band fans. However, as a work of pure classic heavy metal done right this album can match any other opus from the decade all the way to \u201cBlackout\u201d, \u201cDefenders of the Faith\u201d, and \u201cBalls to the Wall\u201d. There\u2019s literally nothing wrong with it from the first to the last note\u2026 except that it doesn\u2019t sound like Black Sabbath. Besides, it presents Iommi as a fine axeman finally; with the abrasive ship-sinking reverberations gone, the man sounds way warmer, more flexible and more proficient\u2026 and less doomy.\n\n\u201cIn for the Kill\u201d is a mighty galloper the guys riding the winds of power metal with Hughes\u2019 outstanding vocals the best possible companion to the impetuous riff-fest. A great beginning on all counts which also has its lyrical side in the face of \u201cNo Stranger to Love\u201d, already released as a single a few months prior, a supreme heart-rending ballad with warm bluesy overtones, a perennial hit that has appeared in numerous \u201cbest ballads\u201d compilations through the years. \u201cTurn to Stone\u201d presses the pedal down again, a wayward proto-speedster which brings the energy level up again. Not for long as the title-track is a high-octane doomster, the only reminder of the earlier Sabbath catalogue, a brilliant epic with the stomping riffs and the memorable chorus. Time for some smattering old school heavy/power metal with \u201cDanger Zone\u201d, the definitive hymn with Iommi and Hughes in a highly inspired form the former unleashing all his guitar grandeur, something which wasn\u2019t quite possible within the restrictive doom-laden context of the earlier efforts. \u201cHeart Like a Wheel\u201d is an overlong bluesy ballad which slows the album down, but at least Iommi has plenty of chances to show-off with stylish, quasi-doomy licks. The latter vibe stays around for \u201cAngry Heart\u201d which can\u2019t be labelled as anything else but blues metal; still, its soulful relaxed rhythms are a wonder to listen to, especially if you\u2019re in a retrospective mood for which a great help would also be \u201cIn Memory\u201d, a superb short ballad which is way more than just an epitaph with Hughes\u2019 hypnotic emotional croon hovering above the heavy, pensive riffage, particularly on the several higher notes; a vocal talent second to none who would grace another strong showing (Yngwie Malmsteen\u2019s \u201cOdyssey\u201d) two years later.\n\nIommi had done a great job acquitting himself in the most admirable manner imaginable, putting his signature underneath this recording which revealed him as an individualistic musician, perfectly capable of operating outside the shadow of Black Sabbath, on full throttle at that. Either for commercial reasons or because of the old \u201cOld love gathers no rust\u201d proverb (which can\u2019t be any truer, mind you), the man subjected his solo strives for the greater good, and voted to carry on with the Sabbath moniker which produced marvellous results before long, putting the band name back on the very front of the metal arena. The band still stand strong despite the numerous turmoils, conflicts, backward stabbings and what not, and even ended up with Ozzy in the line-up again\u2026 it\u2019s a picturesque world out there, one that would always secure a vacant lane for an ever-rolling Sabbath stone.\n",
        "\n2015, it's the last day of summer for me. At the time, my 15 year old self was into stuff such as Pearl Jam (still am somewhat), Alice In Chains, Soundgarden, and any kind of 90's alternative band, more than I was metal at the time. I had listened to Rust In Peace awhile back at the time and thought it was really good, but then my dumb ass decided to worship Korn for awhile. Anyway, I was at the local CD store one day picking up some new CD's, and I saw Paranoid by Black Sabbath for $5 brand new. I'd already knew of Black Sabbath from listening to their Masters Of Reality album nonstop that past summer (I'll get into that album one day), so I knew these guys were worth the $5 price tag. What I didn't know, is that my life was about to change that day. After arriving home, I popped the CD into my stereo, and once I heard the opening ring of War Pigs. I became a metal-head at that very moment, and knew that this was something I had never really heard of at that time.\n\nWhen you listen to Paranoid, you're in for a grim listening experience. There's no hippie love songs on this album, or even songs about flower power (goddamn you Robert Plant), instead, your greeted with songs about war, mental Illness, and political corruption. Basically, Sabbath were one of the first bands to talk about the shit that no one else dared to talk about. Not only that, but the music on this album truly is evil sounding, even in today's times. Tony Iommi's riff's create a feeling of despair, neurotic-ism with the out of nowhere, yet fitting guitar bends and sometimes even the tone of the guitars, and sadness all at once. A great example of these characteristics is in the song \"Electric Funeral\". The riff in that song is spawned straight from the other-world, or at least something you'd hear when greeted at hell's gates. A wah is used to great effect to create the sense that this song could fall apart at any minute, and it sure seems like it's about to when we get to the middle section of the song. But it doesn't, instead the guitar is unleashed, creating an angry landscape, while also making the listener think, is it possible for a guitar to sound completely mad? The only reason I say this, is right when said middle section is about to end, Tony implements these simple, yet effective bends into the riff. These bends only further fuel the song's intensity, and I swear to god, the first time I heard this song, I was terrified. Not many albums have the effect to make a listener feel terrified, but Paranoid does it exceedingly well. Not bad for an album that came out in the 70's, and that's the beauty of Paranoid. It can still have the same reaction on someone as it did in 1970, and that right there, has a big part in why this album is such a classic. \n\nBut an absolutely amazing atmosphere would be nothing if the songs weren't any good. Worry not my friends, Paranoid is pure perfection. Seriously, War Pigs, Paranoid, Iron Man, Electric Funeral, Hand Of Doom, and Fairies Wear Boots. Each song has a swinging, yet firm groove (thanks to Bill Ward & Geezer Butler), and every note played by Mr. Iommi always feels as though it's adding to the overall atmosphere of the song. No noodling to be found here. Take for instance War Pigs, it's a simple, yet VERY effective riff that's played in the beginning that makes it feel as though judgement-day is upon us. Add in the ominous, creeping bass line, and the siren effects, and it's the definition of a perfect opening track. Then Ozzy sings his iconic lines, \"Generals gathered in their masses, just like witches at black masses.\" and from there, we are greeted with the most iconic groove/riff-age of all time if you ask me. It's hard hitting, and straight to the point at least for the first half of the song. The second section of War Pigs transitions into a jazz esque section with these absolutely beautiful guitar lines being played by Tony. The guitar sounds like it's almost crying in pain by the end of the song, almost as if it's lost the war, and it's art that directly tugs at my heart-strings every time I hear it, for I was about to quit my obsolete grunge band during this time, but I didn't really know what kind of music I wanted to play, that is until I heard this song. THIS is the song that made me want to not only play metal music, but also become a metal-head, so it will ALWAYS hold a special place in my heart for that reason. \n\nIf your a metal-head and you don't own this absolutely essential album, then your fucking up big time. And if you don't like this album, I'm sorry, but to me your a poser. For this album gave birth to the genre we know and love today. Deep Purple In Rock, and the first Sabbath album may have layed out the blue-print for Heavy Metal, but Paranoid was the first TRUE heavy metal album. Without it, I don't know if I would even be typing this review out right now...\n",
        "\nFeelings of nostalgia are normal for most people, its the consequence of having a functional memory and remembering happier times. Its no small coincidence then that bands sometimes aim to return to the past, either in an attempt to reconnect with themselves or perhaps a fanbase they've seemingly drifted away from. While sometimes looked upon with negative connotations, sentimentality tied to the past is a fairly normal thing that pretty much every person does in some form or fashion.\n\nThis all said, is it any real surprise that 13 turned out like it did? While some of us were hoping for a triumphant return to the grandoise works of very early 70's Sabbath, it's not the least bit shocking that a reformed Ozzy led Sabbath took the route they did. With the unfortunate passing of Ronnie James Dio and subsequent end to the Heaven and Hell outfit, eyes were turned to Osbourne to lead the Birmingham foursome once again. While Bill Ward would be sitting out this go around, Ozzy would be returning to the studio with Sabbath thirty-five years after his goodbye in Never Say Die. Geezer Butler would also be tagging along, his first appearance since Cross Purposes way back in 1994.\n\nThis out of the way, 13 is really nothing more than a tribute to the past that edges dangerously close to self-plagiarism. Once again, this is hardly surprising considering how long its been since a Sabbath studio effort, let alone one to feature its most iconic frontman. As you might expect, 13 charges back to the first two Sabbath records in the self-titled and Paranoid. It borrows that free flowing, wandering character that the self-titled had while maintaining a certain murky edge associated with that album. It's probably no small coincidence that Loner sounds shockingly similar to N.I.B. off that same album while just next door Zeitgeist immediately brings Planet Caravan to mind. Damaged Soul could have easily fit on the self-titled album (minus the huge differences in sound quality,) though that same descriptor could fit most any song here.\n\nTo an extent, this is more than expected and even satisfactory. Despite his age and tendency to bungle on his own studio efforts, Ozzy Osbourne sounds pretty decent here, even strong at times. Tony Iommi is not himself with his riffs and solos when compared to his more glorious days in the 1970's to early 1980's, but still very impressive here. Geezer Butler also shines, perhaps more so than anyone else, with some memorable bass work. Brad Wilk (from Rage Against The Machine) is mostly forgettable, but considering he was hired as a stand-in for Bill Ward, I suppose that is to be expected. I could go on to bring up the obligatory complaining that the production sucks, effectively neutering any punch this album could have had, but I'll decline. Considering Rick Rubin was involved, its slightly better than I had imagined. At least the drums are less obnoxious than they were on Death Magnetic, so we count our blessings where we can and oddly enough the mix does not really sound that bad when I take the time to really think about it.\n\nIts not hard to listen to this album and feel a tad disappointed. Even with their age in mind, Black Sabbath had always been an evolutionary group never sticking in one place for too long. To hear them revert back to their roots seems jarring in a way, almost as if the band themselves have zero idea what to do except do whatever people expect them to. 13 is hardly a bad album, but it comes across as a mediocre one worth a couple of spins before inspiring the listener to return to the albums this is emulating. That's definitely not a good sign, as even the band's lesser efforts of the past like Born Again and Forbidden weren't deliberately trying to ape the past. This album is basically trying to remind the world of what Sabbath once was, way back before anyone really knew what metal music even was supposed to be. This makes 13 a decent but ultimately unnecessary record.\n",
        "\nGenerally speaking whenever someone talks about the Ozzy years, they say \"after the first four or five albums they fell off\" and I want to take a crowbar to their miserable empty heads. Or at the very least I want to grab hold of their collars and yell at them \"WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH SABOTAGE YOU MISERABLE CUNT?!\" Even Rolling Stone magazine gave this thing a good review. I'd like to repeat that because it's fairly important: Rolling Stone, the baby-boomer cum rag that gave a bad review to anything with a heavy guitar sound, gave this album, a good review. Now you'd think some backwards logic would be employed such as \"If Rolling Stone gives it good review it must be shite,\" we're talking about Sabotage here. Not only the Ozzy era's finest hour, but Sabbath's finest hour in their 45+ year career.\n\nAt the very least it's Ozzy finest moment vocally. He's hitting notes here that neither Dio nor Robert fucking Plant were able to hit (at least in 1975 he wasn't hitting those notes anymore. Fun fact: In a review for Zeppelin's 1975 double LP, perennial fart-knocker Robert Christgau says Plant was starting to get on his nerves, 'and [he liked] him.' For all the lionizing of Dio being Sabbath's greatest vocalist, I don't ever recalling him tearing Symptom of the Universe or The Writ up live on the Heaven & Hell tour. He wasn't exactly itching to do Sweet Leaf either, but I digress. To be fair, Megalomania was a struggle for Ozzy live as well. Just listen to Past Lives where he has to bailout and switch to a much lower octave about 3/4 of the way through. But still for one glorious year, Ozzy was the best metal vocalist on the planet. Drugs are hell of a drug kids.\n\nThe only member who's not quite at the top of his game is Bill Ward, not that you'd immediately notice from the drum-fill destruction that is Symptom of the Universe. But the Gene Krupa-isms that flourished throughout the first four albums have kind of eroded. Most of the time he plays relatively straight. But still, he's much more sound and reactionary here than he is on say, Heaven & Hell, where the alcohol and Ozzy's departure took even more of a toll than usual.\n\nBut the people who have really stepped up their game were songwriters Tony Iommi and Geezer Butler. While Ronnie definitely has a history of unintentionally exerting his ideas into a band, I don't think Heaven & Hell could have taken shape the way it did if progressive, epic, and heavy as fuck masterpieces like The Writ and Megalomania hadn't sown those seeds five years ago. The acoustic/mellotronic breaks around 5:05 of the former are particularly mindbending. Ozzy's vocal plays a perfect Lebowski rug and gives the moments a brilliant feeling of depression and exhaustion. Megalomania also has a twinge of that R&B home-wrecked and pissed off Arethra Franklin sensibility in its second half. One of two examples of a slight Mowtown influence in metal.\n\nBut Sabbath has been, and always will be, about the fucking riffs. Symptom of the Universe is credited as the first thrash song and with, very, very good reason. This was the first Black Sabbath song I ever heard as a live track, and as you might imagine, it tore my head off with its intensity. I'd almost venture to say practically every other Sabbath song after that was a letdown because very, very few songs in that break-in period impressed me as much as that one did. It was probably a smart decision to leave the \"Woman child of love's creation\" part out live though, as the band never seemed to be going anywhere with it. Even Supertzar, an instrumental track best described as a glorified PA intro, has not one but TWO killer riffs many rock bands they wish they could have as their hit single.\n\nNo Sabbath album seems to be without excess, however. I've never quite understood the point of Don't Start (Too Late). I'll admit Orchis and Laguna Sunrise can be fun moody pieces every once in a while, but this literally feels like tripping over a rock after the mid-paced majesty of Hole In The Sky. Especially after it seems like the track accidentally had a second or so cut off. It's way too short and has no musical direction to be of any value. There's also some days where Am I Going Insane works, and some days where I just have to skip to The Writ. It can be just a tad too goofy sometimes.\n\nThe absurdly high ranking is a combination of the band at their peak and the undeniable historical importance of Black Sabbath. Sabbath got fucked something fierce by management and with Sabotage comes time for some Arctically served revenge. The first SIX albums are cornerstones of heavy fucking metal, and don't you let anyone forget it.\n",
        "\nA common misconception about Tony Iommi is that as a result of his fingers getting a little too friendly on his date with the welding machine, he (and Geezer by consequence) immediately had to drop down to C tuning to make playing easier on his fingers. If the above sentence were on some sort of \"True or False\" test, the correct answer would be in fact be False. Yes Sabbath did tune down....on Master of Reality. But those classic riffs on those first couple of albums? Black Sabbath? Standard tuning. NIB? Standard tuning. Dirty Women? Standard tuning. Heaven & Hell? Standard tuning. War Pigs, Iron Man and Paranoid? E A D G B E standard tuning. All you \"only detuning is heavy\" fools who can't possibly bear to be above drop D, read em and weep. I also didn't mistype with those latter day Sabbath tunes either. Eventually, old Anthony Frank actually got bored with the detuned sound and the band went back up to standard tuning (and this would include live performances as well. Go rewatch the 1978 Never Say Die concert and see if you notice anything peculiar about Children of The Grave, Snowblind, Symptom of the Universe, etc.). Sabbath would stay in standard for quite a few albums. The quality of everything from Technical Ecstasy through Born Again is certainly debatable, but the point is this myth about Tony Iommi having to always downtune because of his fingers being chopped off is exactly that, a myth.\n\nOne other thing of note is that despite an almost universal appraisal of creation from the genre's direction, Black Sabbath's rhythm section functioned a lot differently than say....Slayer's. People often mention the blues influence on Sabbath's music, but they quite frequently forget the jazz influence, which comes courtesy of Bill Ward. Bill Ward's Krupa worship has always been early Black Sabbath's secret weapon. One need look no further than War Pigs verses. But for all the credit Geezer and Bill get, I actually think the spruces of jazz take away from the heaviness rather than accentuate it. One example of this is Electric Funeral. It's telling how the bridge is executed rhythmically here vs. how it was executed on Reunion. On Reunion its executed like a speed thrash section, whereas here it's executed with this swing-time Buddy Rich pizzaz. Another one of these moments comes when Hand of Doom kicks into high gear. If you take the acid trip gone wrong sequences in Winnie The Pooh and the Blustery Day and Dumbo, and place one of those femme fatale jazz singers in high cut dresses with a nightclub band behind them as the soundtrack, that's what you get from Hand of Doom. It's perfectly plausible to imagine her singing to nightclubs full of fedoras that their skin is turning green and giving death a kiss (you poor little fool, now). Fairies Wear Boots is another example of that jazz swing gone wonderfully wrong. This extravagance seems more like a progenitor to power metal than any other sub-genre of metal. That's what Bill Ward brought to Sabbath. Personally, I love Bill Ward's approach and for all the raving people do about how Sabbath are originators, I wish they took more cues from him. Usually people look at modern examples of great heavy rhythm sections and they usually name check Brad and Tim from RATM, but Brad Wilk's approach is probably the most anti-drum fill since Phil Rudd. Kind of funny in hindsight considering that Sabbath calls for drum fills but they got such a non fill person to \"fill in\" for Bill Ward on 13. Jazz drumming is usually light and floaty rather than the clicky double bass pounding of modern recordings we hear today. Think about that next time Henry Rollins decides to prattle on like an idiot about rhythm sections (though the fanboy in me can't deny that Geezer and Bill are the greatest rhythm section in music).\n\nIn this day and age, it can also be a little difficult to fathom how this could have been the heaviest thing ever in 1970 when Led Zeppelin had three albums with around the same amount of riffs and screaming as this does. If you've ever listened to the Who live album \"Live At Leeds\" you'll definitely hear lots of moments that walk the razor's edge between really distorted R&B and heavy metal. The excuse that Paranoid was metal 100% of the way through doesn't fly here either, as the presence of Planet Caravan and Rat Salad proves. While I personally don't think the idea of heavy metal really coalesced until Judas Priest or so, I will argue the album deserves most of its accolades because they went completely in on the concept and atmosphere of the darkness. Sure the Rolling Stones and the hippies were all \"make love, not war,\" but none of them were completely willing to defiantly call their album War Pigs with a full blown mockery of calling politicians pigs. While not every song here deals with the dark and apocalyptic, they do deal with truly fantastical ideals that one simply can't articulate in normal every conversation. You show me someone talking about how they want to take a woman in a rocket into outer space and how he saw fairies with boots and I'll show you a homeless lunatic.\n\nA common criticism of the first album was that it was a bit too jammy for its own good. I don't think that's entirely fair as the band wasn't even sure they were going to record a second album and for all intents in purposes, recorded a live performance complete with unaccompanied solos and everything. That is scaled down considerably here and the free form moments actually feel organically integrated into the song. As Pete Townsend once remarked, they were following the music rather than writing it. The best example of this being War Pigs/Luke's Wall, although does anyone actually call it that full name anymore? My best guess is Luke's Wall begins at the 5:41 mark, but its been called War Pigs for so long, not to mention it doesn't feel right stopping the song before its proper ending. Then there are tracks like Iron Man, Electric Funeral and Hand of Doom which don't so much have jamming, but King Crimson-esque time changes that, in all cases, ramp up the intensity. It's rather laughable that people called Sabbath too slow to be listenable. Not only did most of the tracks have moments where they sped up, but the picked the exact right time to do so to perk the listeners attention right back up.\n\nWith traces of the blues still left in the band (personally I don't think they ever left until Ozzy did), Black Sabbath pushes the idea of their fuzzy yet chunky brand of heaviness just one step further. Not to mention constructed some fine tunes in the process. WITHOUT tuning down....yet.\n",
        "\nSabbath Bloody Sabbath was the first Black Sabbath album that I ever bought on CD. My Dad recommended it to me based on the fact that it was his favourite of the three Sabs albums that he owned on vinyl (along with Paranoid and Never Say Die). And boy did it turn out to be the perfect introduction to Sabbath for me! On a slight side note, I think the album cover is perfectly evil, if a bit dated looking.\n\nAs with other Black Sabbath albums, the main strength here is the riffs; most of the album contains epic heavy riffs. For instance, the title track is absolutely epic dungeon metal; that opening riff just sounds like it\u2019s tearing the dungeon manacles right out of the stone walls. Oddly enough that first riff is followed up by a section that sounds rather like Jethro Tull (not a bad thing!) before returning to the heavy stuff. The outro riff used to scare me in my youth, but now I appreciate just how evil sounding it is! With the exception of the acoustic song Fluff, every song contains wonderful Iommi riffs, especially the title track, A National Acrobat, Sabbra Cadabra, and Killing Yourself To Live.\n\nLyrically this album comes across to me as one of their more interesting/strong albums. A National Acrobat has awesomely odd lyrics (\u201cwhen little worlds collide, I\u2019m trapped inside my embryonic cell\u201d) and one of Ozzy\u2019s best ever laughs right at the end of the extended middle groove. Killing Yourself To Live is a wise cautionary tale, and Spiral Architect is a gem of a tale. Ozzy does a great job on all the tracks!\n\nBlack Sabbath also show maturity and well placed variety on this album, things only hinted at on their previous albums. Fluff is probably Sabbath\u2019s most beautiful acoustic song. It\u2019s certainly a lot more melodic, smooth, and beautiful than Laguna Sunrise, which always sounds a bit choppy to me. And Sabbra Cadabra might be early Sabbath\u2019s most upbeat and polished song. My Dad once described it as \u201ccandy Sabbath\u201d and I think that\u2019s a good description, what with all the Rick Wakeman keyboards and the romantic lyrics. But unlike the awful Changes, FX, and the questionable Laguna Sunrise on Vol. 4, the variety really works here!\n\nThere are a few areas for me where this album loses some marks. The first three tracks on side two drag for me after repeated listenings, and the synthesizer on Who Are You sounds a bit dated and cheesy. Also Geezer is much less noticeable on bass than in the previous four albums. However for the first time Bill Ward goes an entire album without ever sounding like a silly drummer to me. No indeed, on this album Bill Ward fits in perfectly on every song. It\u2019s as though he learned how to be a drummer between Vol. 4 and Sabbath Bloody Sabbath.\n\nThe last track, Spiral Architect, is one of Black Sabbath\u2019s crowning achievements as musical artists. It\u2019s not my favourite song by them, and it\u2019s probably not their best or most influential track, but there\u2019s something about it that transcends the need for genre identification as a listener. It shouldn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a metal head, regular symphony goer, or a jazz fanatic. Spiral Architect is such a well written song that it should provide something for everyone. It starts out with beautiful haunting acoustic guitar, before building into something majestic and sweeping, with guitars, drums, great vocals, and tasteful orchestral arrangements. The spiral city architects indeed, Messrs Iommi, Osbourne, Butler, & Ward!\n",
        "\nAfter 15 years of time spent apart continuing their respective musical careers with varying degrees of qualitative success, the fates have called Ronnie James Dio and the line up that gave us Mob Rules and Dehumanizer to return once more to dazzle the ears with the metal majesty that has seemingly never left them. The reunion that has spawned The Devil Cried has brought back a level of credibility and flair that had been sadly lacking since the exodus of Tony Martin and the inception of the musically unproductive Ozzy/Sabbath reunion, and the resulting song itself finds itself in fairly similar territory to where they were in 1992, namely a musically dark and somewhat mechanistic area that reminds heavily of the Grim Reaper meets Terminator visual that typified Dehumanizer. \n\nAlthough only one out of a highly anticipated collection of three new studio recordings, \u201cThe Devil Cried\u201d does not disappoint in its faithful reenactment of the Dio era. It features a dark and crushing main riff that is slightly reminiscent of \u201cLady Evil\u201d, but the character of the guitar sound screams something far closer to \"After All (The Dead\" and a tempo a bit closer to said doom-steeped anthem of despair. Ronnie\u2019s vocal delivery is as bombastic and raunchy as ever, proving that age does not necessarily steal anything from one\u2019s vocal constitution and sense of unfettered passion. But above all else, it's about as catchy as they come and sticks in the memory about as quickly as any of this lineup's previous single releases throughout the years.\n\nFans of Dio and the small group of years that he spent in the Sabbath fold will obviously not be disappointed, for this song alone would make picking up the soon to be release The Dio Years compilation worth it, as it is everything that we\u2019ve come to love about this line-up of Black Sabbath, not to mention an early taste of what is sure to be a brilliant collaboration that will hopefully last longer than the last one. Forget about Ozzy, screw \u201cPsycho Man\u201d and \u201cSelling My Soul\u201d, this is the real goods. In all honesty, I myself already have the compilation on advance order and look forward to listening the hell out of this song, along with the other two latest auditory treats to come out of one of the finest of metal's longest standing and formative bands.\n\nOriginally written on March 14th, 2007.\n",
        "\nFor me what makes this Black Sabbath\u2019s best album is the overall consistency in the quality of the songwriting and musicianship, the excellent atmosphere, and the lack of sustained laughable moments that seem to dot some of their other releases.\n\nThe first thing that strikes me is Iommi\u2019s tone. It\u2019s so incredibly heavy and distinctive. The opening two seconds of Sweet Leaf\u2019s riff (after that now legendary coughing) sounds like the air is being filled with liquid sludge. The only heavier moment on the album is the opening riff from Into The Void. Listened to attentively on vinyl, that bastard just makes my ears ooze with sludge. I was so pleased that the sludge experience on Into The Void was replicated when I saw them live back in March 2016. Along with his great tone, Iommi also presents us with some extremely catchy riffs.\n\nSo with the aforementioned thick, dark, fuzzy, sludgy riffs doing their work on the albums five heavy tracks, it\u2019s time to move on to the other electric instrument: the bass guitar! As usual Geezer is on fire, anchoring the songs with heavy notes, often playing awesome ascending and descending lines (especially in the first two songs), and just generally fitting in flawlessly with whatever Iommi is doing.\n\nOzzy\u2019s singing is great as always. It\u2019s true that you either like his voice or you don\u2019t, but if you do like his voice, there\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with his performance on this record; he delivers. Lots of great \u201coh yeah\u201d moments that might be a bit predictable, but somehow he pulls them off rather charmingly. The lyrics work really well with the atmosphere of the music. Dark themes such as drugs, death, sadness, and destruction are just the ticket for these songs.\n\nMusically my only minor complaint with the album has to be Bill Ward\u2019s drumming. Being a drummer myself, the first time I heard each of Sabbath\u2019s first four albums I literally laughed out loud at some of Bill\u2019s drumming. It isn\u2019t until Sabbath Bloody Sabbath that to me his drumming is no longer odd at best, laughable at worst. At least on this album the only time that I visibly cringe is during the extended middle section of Sweet Leaf. His drumming during that section sounds like what I imagine a hamster in a wheel would sound like if it was given a drum set. On the rest of the album though he plays competently with some interesting offbeats and good enthusiasm. His best moment is likely the eerie sounding timbales on Children Of The Grave. They really help to give that song it\u2019s wonderfully evil atmosphere.\n\nNow while this album is arguably one of the heaviest albums of all time, the reason it works so well not just as a metal album, but as a piece of music in general, is that the five ultra heavy tracks are balanced out with three lighter ones that don\u2019t change the atmosphere. The two short acoustic instrumental tracks are very haunting and beautiful. Embryo in particular sounds like it could be from the dark ages. The longer Solitude sounds like a better version of Planet Caravan from Paranoid. Very poignant and dark.\n\nIn short, this is Black Sabbath\u2019s best album based on its remarkably consistent dark and evil tone, and its lack of filler.\n",
        "\nThere's a lot of argument as to where metal's origins lie. Many will point at heavy psych bands like Iron Butterfly, or highly influential hard rock bands like Led Zeppelin. But for me, the first metal band has always been Black Sabbath. No band before Sabbath was ever as consistently heavy and evil sounding; nor has any other band been anywhere near as influential to the many decades of metal musicians that would follow. By extension of the assertion that Black Sabbath was the first metal band, their self titled debut is the first metal album. However, with that said the question remains: is it a good album? I think most would agree with an honest \"yeah.\"\n\nThe album begins with an unbelievably brilliant self titled track that more or less defines metal as a genre. The first thing one hears when he or she puts this album on is the sound of rain and a slow distant bell ring. Tony Iommi's legendary saturated, distorted tone cuts in and the first riff is played. Ozzy Osbourne delivers the first lyrics \"What is this that stands before me? / Figure in black which points at me / Turn around quick and start to run / Find out I'm the chosen one.\" In less than a minute Sabbath created a genre that would employ heavy distorted guitar playing, creative and often excessively dark ambience, and lyrics obsessed with evil, mysterious and mystical themes. The first song on the first metal album was a master stroke. Few artists in the history of modern music have been as inventive or influential in their entire careers as this first track.\n\nSoon the second track \"The Wizard\" begins with a bit of harmonica riffing. To the contemporary metal listener, this can be somewhat jarring. The harmonica isn't exactly a go-to instrument in the metal genre. But in 1970, Black Sabbath thought they were making a really dark, really heavy psychedelic blues album. The harmonica was natural to their supposed genre and they used it. The harmonica doesn't take away from the darkness that the album set into motion with the first track, but the instrument choice does deserve some explanation. It is the first in a list of curiosities that Black Sabbath put on this album largely out of a spirit of experimentation.\n\nA bit later towards the middle of the album, the song \"N.I.B.\" begins with a slow bass solo played through a wah pedal. This bass intro is another of the afore mentioned curiosities. The rest of the song is a really heavy tune that Ozzy sings from the perspective of Satan seducing someone into his control. That's pretty damn metal. The band's very name is positively evil, but \"N.I.B.\" is where Black Sabbath really sets a precedent for metal's interest and sometimes worship of Satan.\n\nThe album ends with a lengthy (over ten minutes) cover of \"Warning,\" originally performed by The Aynsley Dunbar Retaliation. The lyrics have to do with a love affair gone awry, but on this track the band really shines with some truly impressive soloing. Tony Iommi, although perhaps not the greatest metal guitarist ever to live, is probably inarguably the most influential. The fast \"sheets of sound\" soloing technique played over slower heavy groove oriented rhythm guitar would live on as the predominant metal guitar style for a decide before thrash metal became popular in the early 80's. Near the end of the track, some complicated free improvisation goes on before the band kicks into gear for the last minute or so.\n\nFor an album this influential to also be so great to listen to is an absolutely amazing feat. Sabbath gave the people what they wanted (dark, heavy evil) but left the door open for thousands and thousands of bands to walk in their footsteps and go even further. Metal would change as time went on, but Black Sabbath's bass heavy, Satan obsessed, doom inspired and shredding filled debut lives on as one of the most astounding musical accomplishments of the 20th century.\n",
        "\nI guess this album surpassed my expectations. Grant it, I didn't expect very much from this release. I was prepped for a great, big heaping of uninspired heavy metal laced with Ozzy's signature nasal cavity delivery. But could you blame me for thinking that? They've been using the last 20 years to play reunion concerts with a senile-looking frontman. The band didn't seem interested in writing new music. I didn't think they had it in them anymore. Tony, Geezer, and Ozzy are 3 arthritic old men who've been worn out by years of touring, drug abuse, and bathing in money. What a fool I was to think that. Not only did this album surpass my expectations, but it turned out to be excellent. Hell, I'd go ahead and consider it one of the best heavy metal albums of 2013. To be fair, it didn't have much competition.\n\nI approached the first track like Lila Crane at the end of Psycho; Dreading with uncertainty. However, the song erupted with a dark, sense of doom accompanying the instrumentation. Iommi works his cunning guitar wizardry to create an exceptionally plodding, heavy riff. A sense of relief came over me before the instrumentation cut out and left the verses bare prepared for Ozzy to surely ruin this song. I anticipated for the worst, but found my entangled pessimism unraveled as Ozzy delivers a surprisingly great vocal performance. Okay, he's no Rob Halford, but he's not doing his typical delivery where he over pronounces each individual word...oh wait. Well, at least he cleared his congestion. To be honest, his delivery adds a chilling element to the song. It emphasizes the down-tempo pace to build the overall atmosphere. Despite that, it doesn't make the song feel like a tortuous crawl which is remarkable considering the length. It's eight minutes yet it only feels like four. Not only that, but his vocals also places importance to the lyrics. The song details how mankind is just made up of mechanical beings devoid of any emotion trapped inside human bodies. The only way one can escape this fate is to begin a new life to lead and not be bogged down by one's past identity . Not the most original message, but certainly serviceable. Although, the lyrics can use some improvement. There's a bit too many \"yeah\" and \"okay\" towards the end of the song for my liking. Besides that, I'd consider this to be the best track of the album.\n\nIt's certainly not downhill from there, though. The lead single of the album, \"God is Dead?\", stands out for its questioning of the oft-quoted Nietzsche statement. As the protagonist(probably Satan) witnesses the evil that plagues earth, he begs to question of there being a God to stop this wickedness. Instead of forcing a narrative down the listener's throat, it ends on an ambivalent note. I honestly appreciate that. The whole album isn't entirely slow, doom metal tracks. Songs like \"Live Forever\" and \"Loner\" pick up the tempo and allows Iommi's abilities to shine. He manages to arrange some jaw-dropping solos on both of those tracks. The best part is that those songs are not entirely dedicated to the art of shredding. \"Loner\", for instance, tells the narrative of well...a loner which hits a little too close to home.\n\nYou know, I haven't mentioned the new drummer yet. That's because he isn't really worth mentioning. Brad Wilk ruins the classic lineup for his inclusion as the drummer. He's component on the entire album, but you won't leave this going, \"Wow, those drum fills were absolutely wonderful.\" I only notice him, because his drums are mixed right in front and you can't ignore it. That definitely doesn't help on songs like \"Age of Reason\" which makes the drums sound almost time-aligned. He does display his talents on songs like \"Dear Father\", so you can't claim that he's a complete hack. Still, you can't help but wish for Bill Ward to have played on this instead\n\nOverall, I strongly recommend this album. It's dark, heavy tone and masterful songwriting makes this album a standout amongst Black Sabbath's discography. It's a long album yet it keeps you interested, so it feels like the appropriate length. There are several small issues with this album, though. I can't say Rick Rubin did a spectacular job producing the album. While I don't mind the loudness of it, I take issue with the use of certain vocal effects on songs like \"God is Dead?\" and \"Zeitgeist\", as well as the mix on the drums. However, those are honestly nitpicky. The album deserves to be heralded as the great comeback that it really is. I still have one question, though. With the general assumption being that this is the last Black Sabbath record, Is this really the high note the band wants to end on?\n\nBonus: The deluxe edition came with 3 additional tracks with 2 of them being great. \"Methademic\" is the first great one which begins with an acoustic guitar giving a beautiful intro. As soon as you processed that, the track immediately goes all guns blazing and takes you along with it. The main riff of this songs reminds of Sabbath around the Sabotage era with its bombast and mellow verses while keeping a fast, steady tempo. \"Pariah\" is the second great one which clearly takes influences from \"Supernaut\". The main riff will drive you insane with how catchy it is. It sticks in your head and makes sure you won't forget it. The other half of the song goes transitions a somewhat, unexpected calming passage for Iommi's glorious solo before going full throttle again. The mediocre track is \"Peace of Mind\" which is surprisingly average. Not even a good average. There's just not that much to it. I appreciate giving Geezer some spotlight, but that really doesn't do much. If you're going to buy the album, then I'd recommend getting the deluxe edition for \"Methademic\" and \"Pariah\". They're definitely worth your while.\n",
        "\nBlack Sabbath of the early 70's released some of the heaviest, most drug-influenced and dirtiest albums ever. After their fourth effort, Black Sabbath Vol. 4, the band changed its sound. Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath, the band's fifth effort, ended its sludgy phase. The production was much cleaner, and the riffs became much more melodic. In addition, from that album and on Black Sabbath have started adding more and more progressive elements and synthesizers to their music. Despite the sound change, the album was well received among fans and critics, and it is still loved to this day. The following album, Sabotage, would drive further away from the band's original sound. Much more progressive than before, two songs in it pass the 8-minute mark, and in addition there is a heavy synth use, as clearly seen in Am I Going Insane (Radio). Sabotage was also rightfully well-acclaimed, and the problems only began to show up on their seventh studio album, Technical Ecstasy. It is considered by many the first bad Black Sabbath album.\n\nIn Technical Ecstasy, the band started experimenting a lot with different sounds and types of music. A lot of the heaviness they were known for is gone, and synth use is very prominent. Some of the tracks, and especially Rock N' Roll Doctor, can barely be considered metal. The aforementioned is a failed attempt at making a pop/rock hit, while All Moving Parts (Stand Still) and Gypsy are both groovy and upbeat with some sort of funk influences. The album also contains two ballads, It's Alright and She's Gone. The former actually being sung by the band's drummer Bill Ward. That leaves us with only three heavy metal songs on a Black Sabbath record, all of which are highlights of the record. \n\nThe opener Back Street Kids is fast and heavy with some great riffs and an unusual bridge to keep things interesting. The heavily synth-driven You Won't Change Me is extremely melodic and emotional, turning up to be one of the best moments of the album. The real highlight, though, is the closer Dirty Women. Over 7 minutes in length, this bombastic song shifts between some of the best riffs and solos the band ever preformed. The song could be easily matched against most of the songs on Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath.\n\nEven when leaving the metal tracks aside, the album still does have some fine moments. The two ballads are both very nice, and the vocals by Bill Ward end up being very refreshing and fitting for a ballad, even though the ballad itself comes across as slightly cheesy. In contrast, She's Gone has a beautiful atmosphere, but lacks in the vocal section, seeing as Ozzy Osbourne is not very talented singing clean. Thus, the three track span from Gypsy to Rock N' Roll Doctor is easily the worst part of the album, but all three, and especially the first two, have some nice moments that prevent them from being total ass like the awesome guitar solo in Gypsy.\n\nLacking in the songwriting section as it may be, some other aspects of Technical Ecstasy pick it up. The production is perfect, very much resembling the great one on Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath, and the vocals on the heavier tracks are surprisingly very well executed and end up being some of Ozzy's finest moments. That being said, his vocals on some of the other tracks are absolutely atrocious. The performance by other band members is also very good, especially the surprising vocal performance by Bill Ward. \n\nTechnical Ecstasy is an album most Sabbath fans love to hate. While the band's distinctive sound did change in it, this isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. Despite having some bad/average tracks, the album contains some amazing and overlooked tunes.\n",
        "\nIn the late 1970's, the legendary creators of heavy metal, Black Sabbath, were going through some rather tumultuous times. They had released two lackluster records, were dealing with Ozzy's antics and drinking problems, and were overall struggling with a serious lack of inspiration. After Ozzy was given the boot, one would think that Black Sabbath would be doomed. That is until the almighty Ronnie James Dio takes the helm for their 1980 comeback album: Heaven and Hell. Heaven and Hell was a massive achievement for the band and is arguably one of heavy metal's grandest moments. But what about its 1981 successor? A lot of people forget about Mob Rules, and rather unjustly so, as it is still a great album in its own right. Is it as good as Heaven and Hell? Not at all, but this record is not without merit. I happen to enjoy it very much, and I find it is rather underrated. \n\nThe structure of this album definitely can be related to its predecessor, the songwriting is on almost as high of a level, and the riffing and rhythm section are largely similar. What separates this album from Heaven and Hell is that this one is a lot darker in subject matter and tone. A lot of the songs are reinforced by eerie keyboards or dark and menacing riff work. The guitar tone is also a lot thicker and more menacing, unlike Heaven and Hell's brighter, crisper tone. Take the prechorus of the title track, the chords Tony plays are thick, muddy, and atmospheric giving a wicked wall of sound. He does this all over the album, on almost each song. Another notable example of this is on \"Falling Off the Edge of the World\", which features lots of thick, menacing reverb packed guitar chords. \n\nThere is also a good helping of diversity on the album, with a collection of faster tracks, mid paced ones, and some longer epics; even a ballad. Tracks like \"Turn Up the Night\" and the title track show off a lot of energy reinforced with a refreshing aggression delivered by Dio's vocals, while songs like the fan favorite \"The Sign of the Southern Cross\" and my personal favorite, \"Falling Off the Edge of the World\" feature longer running times and more involved compositions. Generally, the album is quite diverse, featuring lots of different arrangements and riffs. \n\nOne of the albums most attractive traits is its very heavy, crushing musical approach that just kicks ass. It never gets old hearing the satisfying assault of those thick distorted power chords delivered by Tony. A great example would be the track \"Voodoo\" that begins with a rather unique guitar riff that works extremely well, then the song kicks in to gear with Vinny's classic hammering drums that really make the song a blast. It wouldn't be fair if I didn't mention the famous title track, which starts off with a pretty iconic riff before the unleashing of a classic Dio scream. While Heaven and Hell had more of a refined and focused sound, I think the best way to describe Mob Rules is aggressive. The album (with the exception of the ballad) has a pretty aggressive tone to it that keeps it in its own little musical niche. \n\nThe aggressive and dark sound that this album has is reinforced by heavier and thicker production. As I said earlier, the guitar tone is a lot thicker and sludgier, but even the bass is thicker as well, providing a great means of delivering crushing riffs in the classic Tony Iommi style. The production on Heaven and Hell is more crisp with an edgier sound that was supplemented by subtle use of keys when needed. The production here is largely similar, but leaning towards a chunky sound that is supplemented by dark and eerie keyboard work. The production style fits the music quite well. Take \"Falling Off the Edge of the World\" for example, the intro to this track is very dark and menacing, featuring eerie keys and a melancholic guitar line led by Dio's softer singing voice. After this section ends, the song smashes you in the face with thick and powerful chords and crushing drums. This part is one of my favorite parts on the album before exploding with a very fast guitar riff accompanied by a wicked bass line. It gives a great taste of the album as a whole, I suggest listening to this song for a sample of what Mob Rules has to offer. \n\nThe musicianship is fantastic here, and if you were a fan of the musicianship of the previous album, you'll dig this. Tony brings another set of great riffs and some killer solos, while Geezer's bass lines are active and inventive like they were on Heaven and Hell. Geezer even has some distorted lead dueling licks on \"Slipping Away\" that are a real treat to hear. The biggest difference on this album when it comes to the instrumentation is the change of drummers. Bill Ward had left the band prior to this album, so Dio brought in Vinny Appice, who would later appear on many other Dio-led records. Bill's drumming was more groovy and intricate, full of fills and interesting accents here and there, while Vinny has more of a straightforward drumming approach that changes the direction of the music a bit. Instead of more intricate and groovy drumming, we have a very heavy hitting and simpler style. It is not bad, but I actually prefer Bill to this. Dio's vocals are absolutely fantastic as always, he literally has never had a poor performance on all of the album's he's performed on. He really was the king of heavy metal, truly spectacular. His songwriting is top-notch as well, and he does a great job of leading the band for this record. My favorite vocal performance on this album is \"The Sign of the Southern Cross\", in which his voice takes the forefront and comes about with a mesmerizing delivery. \n\nOverall, Mob Rules is a great album that is quite underrated by many. This deserves the admiration that a lot of other Sabbath albums receive, while it is not quite on the same level as a lot of them. The majority of this is amazing, but tracks like \"Country Girl\" and \"Over and Over\" keep this from breaking the 90% mark. If you liked Heaven and Hell, you'll like this one too, heck I even know somebody who prefers this album to that one. If you haven't heard this one yet, check it out, but this is the weakest of the three Dio Sabbath albums. The song \"Falling Off the Edge of the World\" is in my top 5 Black Sabbath songs, and is definitely worth checking out, it's by far the best track here. All in all though, this is a great album. It is dark, heavy, well written and well played with some great production. Mob Rules deserves a little bit more attention in the heavy metal world, I have always thought of it as kind of an unsung classic. \n\n\"Never, no never again!\nListen to me and believe what I say if you can\nNever, this is the end\nYou know I've seen the faces of doom and I'm only a man\nHelp me, tell me I'm sane\nI feel a change in the earth, in the wind and the rain\nSave me, take me away\nYou know I've seen some creatures from hell and I've heard what they say!\n\nI've got to be strong\nOh, I'm falling off the edge of the world\nThink you're safe, but you're wrong!\nWe are falling off the edge of the world!\"\n",
        "\nThe end tour is underway right now and Black Sabbath gave those who went to see them live a little parting gift. This EP is a hard to come by gem of an album that I was lucky enough to get ahold of. As they opened the gates to the United Center in Chicago, I raced to the merchant counter and snagged one copy of The End for myself. Having the physical copy is a dream come true and I am glad I didn't have to resort to listening to a bootleg copy.\n\nAs far as the music goes, we get doom and gloom old school Sabbath once again. If you have heard 13, you will know how these songs would sound. Iommi's signature guitar doom, Geezer\u2019s distorted bass and Ozzy\u2019s signature vocal style. The four new songs made available all have their highlights and easily could have been on 13. Season of the Dead is a heavy and gloomy tale of war akin to War Pigs. I think it could have fit but people would have criticized it for being an updated version of War Pigs. Cry All Night, is a fantastic song with a great melody thanks to Ozzy. Take Me Home shows the band going back to their creative roots when the song takes a total left turn into an acoustic guitar solo that is stunningly beautiful. It helps to balance out all of the heavy and depressing Iommi riffs. Those are about all of the highlights as Isolated Man is by far the worst song. Nothing about it is memorable and is best relegated to a B-side track.\n\nThe second half is just fine, but it doesn't merit very many listens. Hearing live tracks from the last tour is not very exciting. Since I have watched and listened to Gathered In Their Masses, it is safe to say that these 4 live tracks are essentially cut from the same cloth. There is not much else to say about the live tracks. Maybe I would have been more impressed if they did a live DVD so there is something visual to watch. These songs are just thrown in to fill space and make it seem like a more cohesive release.\n\nThere is no need to cry, so wipe away the tears, buying this little relic is worth it if you see them live. 30 bucks is no big deal if you love the band. It is 51 minutes of previously unheard material and there is no guarantee that this release will see a worldwide market. It far from essential unless you plan on seeing them live and love anything that the band releases.The big question is will this be the actual end for Sabbath or will this be the final parting gift? It is far from perfect, but it is the fathers of heavy metal we are talking about!\n",
        "\n''The End'' is a valuable gem since it's probably Black Sabbath's final release with new studio tracks if the band doesn't organize another reunion with Tony Martin or again with Ozzy Osbourne in the future. This EP is only sold at live shows during their final tour this year if there isn't going to be a bland re-release in the future. Let's just hope that the band remains authentic, credible and honest and doesn't release the material on this record again or bring out another studio release which would decrease this release's initial value and rightfully offense the most faithful fans. My friend and I were actually able to get a copy of said album each without any problems and supplies didn't seem to be limited at all so far on tour. Thirty dollars are a lot of money at first sight but you get a historical release from a historical band and the whole release is filled with just under one hour of music which makes this EP longer than many regular studio albums. I didn't regret purchasing this release for one second.\n\nThe four new songs are very similar to songs that were already released on the last full length output ''13''. Therefor, it makes sense that they didn't make it onto said release. Especially the gloomy stomper ''Cry All Night'' is ridden with guitar effects and ends with sounds of rain, thunder and bells just like the similar ''End of the Beginning'' on the previous output. The heavy ''Isolated Man'' convinces with psychedelic vocal effects and offers lyrics that are extremely similar to the straighter and catchier ''Loner'' released two and a half years ago. The slow-motion groover ''Season of the Dead'' would have had its righteous spot on the predecessor since it's quite catchy in its smooth simplicity while the shortest cut ''Take Me Home'' would have rather had a filler spot on the last full length effort even though it's somehow saved by a surprising middle part with some acoustic guitar parts reminding me of folk tunes from Southern Europe. In the end, ''Cry All Night'', ''Isolated Man'' and ''Season of the Dead'' are all solid good to slightly above average Black Sabbath material while ''Take Me Home'' is clearly below average in my book.\n\nThe four live tracks have been recorded in Australia, Canada and New Zealand over the past three years. The sound quality of the tracks recorded in the southern hemisphere isn't much better than bootleg recordings from soundboards or cheap recording devices and especially ''God is Dead?'' sounds somewhat muddy and unbalanced and this amateurish recording doesn't do the engaging original any justice. The two tunes recorded in the northern hemisphere sound a little bit more differentiated and organic and the opening sequence of ''Age of Reason'' is also a perfect example for Ozzy Osbourne's sympathetic interactions with the crowd. In the end, despite the fact that I personally prefer the original songs which were recorded in the southern hemisphere, the two songs recorded in Canada have a much better production and portray the band's entertaining live qualities accurately.\n\nEven though this release is far from being a masterpiece and has its obvious flaws in form of inconsistent productions for the live section and predictable song writing repetitions for the new cuts, I simply adore the band's gloomy atmosphere carried by slow-motion riffs and psychedelic solos, pumping bass guitars, focused and precise drumming and especially Ozzy Osbourne's perfectly imperfect vocals filled with authentic charisma. This mixture that inspired a new kind of music still works flawlessly nowadays for me four and a half decades after its invention. I'm really happy to own this record and true fans of the band should try to get their hands on this authentic, charismatic and unpretentious output.\n",
        "\nBlack Sabbath has so many great albums that people generally overlook a few of their best releases. Everybody knows how great Paranoid and Master of Reality are, and even how amazing Heaven and Hell is; but not too many people, beside big Black Sabbath fans, know of the pure metal awesomeness that is De-freaking-Humanizer. 1992's Dehumanizer is one of this very decorated band's greatest efforts, it combines the raw, heavy sound of the 70's Sabbath with the intricate and masterful sound and songwriting of both Heaven and Hell and Mob Rules. Also, this record has a healthy dosage of pure BADASSERY. Tony wrote some of the most crushingly heavy riffs for this one and Dio, while still retaining his masterful singing voice, sounds very pissed off and wicked. Vinny Appice is back and his drumming here is badass as well, while all of the drums here are quite simplistic, he absolutely HAMMERS them to match the super heavy feel of the album, and he nails everything. Also, Geezer is back with more epic basslines to put the icing on this very, very heavy cake.\n\nThe songs on Dehumanizer range from faster tracks like \"TV Crimes\" and \"Time Machine\" to heavier, more intense songs like my personal favorite: \"I\", the awesome opener \"Computer God\", and \"Letters From Earth\". The album has a pretty diverse track listing, with a wide array of different styled songs. Some of the earlier Sabbath albums all had a bag of songs that were pretty similar to each other, but here you get a really enjoyable listening (and headbanging) experience. The overall feel of Dehumanizer is a lot darker and heavier than the earlier two Dio-Sabbath records. Mob Rules hinted at this with a few tracks that featured dark lyrical themes and styles, but it is in full bloom here. Right from the opening riffing of \"Computer God\", I was immediately surprised by the sheer heaviness and power it has. Dio sings this album with a ton of anger and ferocity, that really sends this album over the top, in a good and badass way. The riffs and bass playing are really a wicked blend of both the classic 70's Sabbath and the two Dio-Sabbath records from the 80's. Tony chugs along with some of his best riffs of his career and tracks like \"Letters From Earth\" remind me of the old school Black Sabbath riffs, while songs like \"Time Machine\" and \"Sins of the Father\" would fit right in with the stuff from Heaven and Hell and Mob Rules. The best songs on this album, in my opinion, are definitely \"I\", \"Computer God\", \"Sins of the Father\", \"Letters From Earth\" and \"Master of Insanity\". The rest are all amazing, and some will find that it's crazy that I left off \"TV Crimes\" and \"After All\", which both rule. It just shows that this album has a lot to offer to lots of different people. Some people say that \"Too Late\" sucks, but I disagree. It is the slowest on the album, and the majority of it is softly sung accompanied by acoustic guitar passages. I have grown to really like it, especially the cool part in the middle (the \"Save me!!!\" part). It's very well done, especially taking into consideration that that kind of song is very easily screwed up. \n\nThe instrumentation on Dehumanizer is really good. Black Sabbath may have gotten a little more technical before, like with Heaven and Hell, Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, and even some songs from Sabotage, but the musical skill is still very present here. Tony is top notch here, he usually is, but his riffs and solos are all wicked on this record. Geezer is also very good here, he plays some really awesome basslines, namely \"TV Crimes\" which has a really great bass part toward the middle. His bass tone is unique on this album, its pretty heavy but clanky too (see his little fill on \"Computer God\"). Vinny Appice is back, and he hammers the kit so hard on this record. I personally love his drumming here, it is pretty simple but it suits these songs so well and I think that the sound of the drums rules on here. Ronnie James Dio is spectacular on every record he sings on, and on Dehumanizer he is pissed off and ready to smash your face in. He sings these songs with this raw wickedness that you usually don't hear him unleash. His vocals on \"I\" are absolutely badass, and help make it the best track on this awesome album. \n\nDehumanizer is definitely one of the most underrated Black Sabbath albums, and one of the most underrated heavy metal albums as well. This is brilliant from start to finish, with some of Black Sabbath's greatest moments on here, like \"I\" and \"Computer God\". It is so awesome hearing those wicked riffs with angry ass Dio yelling over them, not to mention Vinny's super heavy, hammering drums. Dehumanizer really is fantastic, and it is arguably their best album, depending on what your tastes are. This album is a must have for all fans of Dio, and this is one of the best records he sang on. I strongly recommend this to all heavy metal fans and Black Sabbath fans. Those who like doom metal and dark lyrical themes and styles will love this as well. Dehumanizer is one of my favorite albums in my whole collection, it is freaking epic. This album seriously deserves a lot more attention, it is an absolute gem. This awesome record deserves more praise than it gets; it's a dark, mean, heavy, and wicked slab of pure heavy freakin' metal. \n\n\"I am virgin\nI'm a whore\nGiving nothing\nThe taker\nThe maker of war\nI'll smash your face in!\nBut with a smile\nAll together\nYou'll never\nBe stronger than me!\"\n",
        "\nFrom the first note of 'Wheels of Confusion', one instantly knows that the groaning blast of 'Master of Reality' had been replaced by something very different, infinitely more sprawling and relaxed and optimistic, though distant and booming nonetheless. The rest of that song (at 8 minutes, it's a challenging choice for an opener) does nothing to point back to the grim trudge that the band had already pioneered and, concrete-heavy guitar aside, sticks closer to the stereotypical spirit of the 70s than Sabbath ever would again. Although it's clear to see that all of Black Sabbath's early works shifted around from style to style and experiment to experiment, 'Vol. 4' is the album that drifts most lazily between genres and ideas, sometimes incorporating strange ideas because of their strangeness, not because of their musical merit.\n\nPleased with cocaine and dazzled by the sights and sounds of sunny America, the four Brits would seem to have lost some of the gritty determination captured from Birmingham's steel factories and replaced it with other ideas about being groovy, or soulful, or just blissing out in an instrumental haze. There are a ton of ideas here, not least the fuzzy bounce of 'Tomorrow's Dream' and 'Supernaut', the folkily atmospheric 'St Vitus Dance' and blissed out 'Laguna Sunrise', or the jam freedom of the long opener. Then there are those other (questionable) ideas, like 'Changes' and 'FX', as well as the rather more familiar drudgery of 'Cornucopia' and 'Under the Sun', which would have fitted onto either of the two previous albums. However well or poorly this range of styles accords with one's idea of Black Sabbath, it does cause the slight issue that 'Vol. 4' is the very definition of inconsistent, both in tone and quality, easily yielding to the band's every songwriting whim without ever becoming progressive or totally indulgent.\n\nThe objective success and subjective legacy of these songs are rather difficult things to measure, though come down to the musicians responsible for their creation, and the balance (or imbalance) between them. In the first place, Tony Iommi really drives this album with his guitar playing, throwing down the mood and content of most of these songs before his bandmates have their say. 'Wheels of Confusion' and the insanely catchy 'Supernaut' are led by his ideas, the fizz and zip of the latter sounding exactly like what is happening while he plays - burning a hole through the musical world. Of course, Bill Ward also has his drum solo on 'Supernaut', though it's the exception that proves the rule, since the song breathes while the percussion rattles about, before Iommi picks up the riff again and the song lurches forward once more. Ward has the slight burden of soft bass drums to contend with, though for 1972 one shouldn't expect too much aggression to come from the kit: at this primitive stage of hard rock and metal, the drummer himself was the main source of energy, yet Ward is a little restrained on many of these songs, perhaps lending them their subtler edge compared to previous Sabbath efforts. Geezer Butler gets his bass into the stomach chamber on many of the songs, really coming into his own on the slower, rumbling songs, but also complementing Iommi's double-tracked guitar on the more spacious 'Snowblind' and 'Wheels of Confusion'. Ozzy Osbourne isn't nearly as revelatory as 'Paranoid' saw him, actually behaving far more conventionally than one would expect or desire: considering that his ability is far outweighed by his charisma, it's disappointing that he doesn't have much chance to sound like he's forecasting the end of the world, while he struggles to match the more free-spirited direction that his bandmates had set out on.\n\nWhat all this results in is a Black Sabbath less well-defined that they were prior to this album, which ultimately pointed the way forward for the rest of the decade. Dipping into the warm textures of 'Laguna Beach' would have been unthinkable a year earlier - even naming a song 'Laguna Beach' would have been unthinkable - but 'Vol. 4' really does embrace the musical spirit of the time and incorporates as many elements as the band wish, opening the door for the more fully integrated experimentation and progressive tendencies of the widely lauded 'Sabotage' and 'Sabbath Bloody Sabbath'. In my view certainly not the best release from the band, this album seems more like a stepping stone from Sabbath's initial template of heavy metal to a different, if hardly less important, phase of their career - a necessary step towards growing up.\n",
        "\nBlack Sabbath does not need an introduction at all. They are Black effing Sabbath, that's all I have to say. One thing I do have to say is that way too many people overlook the Dio years of this band (the Tony Martin years too). This album is arguably their best release, it is a huge step up from their late 70's material, it boasts the greatest metal vocalist of all time at the helm, and Tony Iommi is at his creative peak here. While Geezer was absent from the majority of the songwriting process, which could spell doom as he was the band's primary lyricist, the lyrics and songwriting is absolutely top notch here due to Dio's awesome musical approach. Dio was exactly the musician and vocalist that Black Sabbath needed. Heaven and Hell is proof of that. \n\nThere are eight songs on this record and all of them, while possessing a similar sound, are all structurally and musically unique. Some of the songs are pretty fast and straightforward, like \"Neon Knights\", \"Wishing Well\", and \"Die Young\", which while being fast, still have lots of elements that make them fresh and interesting. A good example of this would be \"Die Young\" (which was the song that made me a Sabbath fan) with its soft, piano-backed chorus that works wonderfully and surprisingly well. \"Neon Knights\" is a heavy metal classic with its heavy pounding awesomeness and a wicked chorus. Some of the other tracks are more involved and longer, like \"Children of the Sea\" and the title track. These two songs are definitely the best on the album, and the title track is in my opinion Black Sabbath's best song (\"I\", \"Into the Void\" and \"Megalomania\" come pretty darn close too). \"Children of the Sea\" was apparently written in a few minutes the very first time Tony and Ronnie got together to jam, and holy fudge they hit a stroke of genius. The acoustic passage is beautiful in this one, and the main riff is crushingly heavy. I love the ending of this one, the riff is so freakin' epic along with Dio growling, \"Look out! The sky is falling down! Look out!!\" It's so badass, this track is definitely one of the stand out tracks, and it really showcases what the album has to offer. There are some more catchy ones as well, such as \"Lady Evil\" and \"Walk Away\". \"Lady Evil\" is badass and really catchy, although some Sabbath fans dog on this track. The last song on the album, \"Lonely is the Word\", is heavy as hell but really slow and poignant. It is a pretty strange tune, but it is really enjoyable, especially the solo sections. The album is so diverse and so masterfully done, it really is spectacular. \n\nThe musicianship is really, really awesome here. Black Sabbath is known for a heavy, plodding, and sometimes sludgy sound, but here everything is fresh and cleanly executed. Of course, there is nothing wrong with the 70's Sabbath, as most of it ruled. It's just that this is like a breath of fresh air musically. First of all, instead of C# everything, the album's tuning is in E flat so there is an immediate change in the overall sound. Tony takes the cake here in my opinion, his playing is magnificent on every song. Some of these riffs are his best, and these solos are by FAR his best. The solo's from \"Neon Knights\", \"Die Young\" and the from the title track are some of the greatest in the entire Black Sabbath catalogue. Holy crap the title track has such amazing lead work, it is art at its finest and he shines so much on all of the lead sections. The part right before it picks up is just fantastic. The vocal work is just unbelievable, if Dio is not the greatest metal of vocalist of all time I seriously would like to know who is. Only Rob Halford comes close to Dio's legendary pipes. His lyrics and songwriting ability is fantastic as well, and Heaven and Hell is one of his best works. Geezer's playing (while some of it wasn't exactly written by him) is fantastic as usual here. Geezer is one of the greatest of all time, his style is unique and dynamic, and his fills and licks are superb. The bass playing on \"Wishing Well\" and \"Die Young\" are some great examples of Geezer's great playing. Bill Ward's drumming is fantastic as well, he makes for one hell of a rhythm section when combined with Geezer. Heaven and Hell is probably the greatest showcase of what this band of capable of, and it is also proof that Ozzy is the least important member. Dio mops the floor with Ozzy when it comes to sonwriting, and don't even get me started on their singing ability. While I love Ozzy, it shows that what really makes up this band are the 3 musicians behind him, and with Ozzy being replaced by Ronnie James Freaking Dio, Black Sabbath shines as the true masters of heavy metal that they are. \n\nHeaven and Hell is an absolute classic of the heavy metal world, and it is one of the most well done and consistent albums by this band. Heaven and Hell is another one of those albums that I deem worthy of the sparkly 100%, and it is easy to see why. Black Sabbath was doomed after two weak records in a row and losing their frontman. They stuck it out and snagged the almighty Ronnie James Dio and put out their strongest release yet, reviving the entire band's legacy. This record is a must have for all heavy metal fans, I recommend this strongly to all who have not yet heard it. It completely changed my outlook of Black Sabbath and heavy metal in general, and to all you fellow bass players out there, you are gunna dig this. This album is one of heavy metal's very best, I seriously think it's nuts that a lot of Sabbath fans hate this. They are missing out on a great album, don't be like them and give this a try. \n\n\"They say that life's a carousel\nSpinning fast, you've got to ride it well\nThe world is full of Kings and Queens\nWho blind your eyes and steal your dreams\nIt's Heaven and Hell, oh well\nAnd they'll tell you black is really white\nThe moon is just the sun at night\nAnd when you walk in golden halls\nYou get to keep the gold that falls\nIt's Heaven and Hell!!\"\n",
        "\nYears ago, when I first discovered Black Sabbath while playing Rock N' Roll Racing on Super Nintendo, I started to avidly seek out all their releases, excited like a kid at Christmas with each new purchase. I soon realized only the 70's material featured Ozzy Osbourne on vocals, so I focused mainly on their first eight albums. Was I ever in for an unpleasant shock (#[email\u00a0protected]%!) when I popped the turnip which is Technical Ecstasy into the tape deck. \n\nThe opener \"Backstreet Kids\" immediately caught me off guard. With its pedantic, out-of-place ghetto references and Ozzy's overly nasal twine, it didn't take long for it to get on my nerves. The line at the end of the verses : \" Nobody I know is gonna take my rock 'n roll away from me\" is especially horrid. I remember feeling uneasy and cheated while sensing a foreboding apprehension of what was to transpire.\n\n'Turns out my fears were well founded. \n\nMany of the tracks seem like they were composed off the cuff; either the boys from Birmingham had one too many and strayed away from the beaten path or they were recovering from a serious hangover while writing them. As well, they sound hastily put together, as if the band was hemmed in by cloying record executives while trying to meet a deadline. Take \"All Moving Parts\", for example. The less said, the better. It's basically an uninspiring and boring song as flat as a glass of 7-Up left on the counter overnight. Another would be \"Rock N' Roll Doctor\", although I admit the cowbell and piano strokes are a nice touch. Other than that, one could say the entire song is a cry for help. (\"Gotta See My Rock N' Roll Doctor\" repeated a gazillion times!). I find it particularly unfortunate that Ozzy's vocal range bleakly hangs somewhere between the eerie and mesmerizing overtones of their earlier albums and the rock orchestra splendor of his solo days (i.e. Blizzard Of Oz). Somehow, he seems to lack his usual one-of-a-kind charisma and overall magnetism this time around. \n\nA decent song which could have nicely complimented some other powerhouse of an album is \"Gypsy\", which has a cool David Bowie (RIP) /Rush vibe to it, yet here it is hopelessly lumped in with \"It's Alright\", and \"She's Gone\", two absolutely unnecessary pieces of saccharine whimsy. Hence, the problem: half of Technical Ex is comprised of fluff (of course, no disrespect to their instrumental of the same name) while most of it is devoid of any truly satisfying or memorable moments. This is not \"metal\" at all, nor is it acceptable in my book!\n\nAlso, I could have done without the melodramatic synthesizers that pop up intermittently throughout the album. They definitely didn't manage to re-produce the psychedelic and welcome effect found on Sabbath Bloody Sabbath. As far as the rhythm section goes, the band seems to be asleep at the wheel most of the time. Geezer Butler's past synergy and drive from albums such as Paranoid and Master Of Reality are missing; his bass lines come off as cheap and generic. Bill Ward's drumming also lacks his earlier years' relaxed and trailblazing break beat style. Here, they are not impressive at all and thump meekly. \n\nAll is not lost however. The final track, \"Dirty Women\", saves the album from total disgrace (otherwise I would have rated it closer to zero). Although the main guitar riff sounds sort of derived from \"Cocaine\" by Cream, it still fully rocks, grabbing the listener by surprise with its octane driven power and Tony Iommi's flurry of much needed trademark barn burning guitar solos. Despite his shortcomings, Ozzy Osbourne does manage to redeem himself here. If all the songs had the same punch as this one, Technical Ecstasy could have been referred to in the same breath as Sabotage or maybe even Volume 4. Alas, it's stand-out quality is somewhat diminished by its misogynistic title and crass lyrics (I see a man, he's got take away women for sale, yes for sale./ Guess that's the answer, 'cause take away women don't fail\"). I'm not trying to preach here; I can see the appeal in writing a song about a man's relationship with a prostitute. However, this can be achieved in a classier and more tasteful way. (A good example would be \"20 Buck Spin\" by Pentagram). Needless to say, they sure didn't have their female audience in mind when they wrote this one. \n\nAs for the cover, well I guess it's a love it or leave it affair. Hypgnosis had already come up with some pretty rad cover art (such as Pink Floyd's Dark Side Of The Moon and Led Zeppelin's Houses Of The Holy) but to me this looks like something inspired by a glue-sniffing session or a nicotine patch induced nightmare. Geezer Butler should have seriously refrained from designing it (let alone submitting it!), and rather focused his undivided attention on the actual music. Granted, he may have been cleverly attempting to portray the looming threat of mall culture consumerism (robotic shoppers riding escalators) or perhaps technology's unavoidable encroachment on the masses. Instead it comes off as a ghastly eye-sore. A blank canvas would have been preferable to this.\n\nIn a nutshell, this album was a huge disappointment and is best left forgotten in order to not tarnish the awesome nostalgia derived from their first six albums. Even though he was and still is a huge inspiration, Tony Iommi scarcely shines on this release, with the exception of \"Dirty Woman\". Thank goodness for that! At least it didn't turn out to be a permanent thing, as his fretwork on Heaven And Hell clearly proves. The end result though is that Technical Ecstasy is substantially less appealing than the band's past achievements. They really should have taken a couple years break after Sabotage in order to sort themselves out from their heavy drug use and come back to the table with a rested and more focused outlook. Heck, even the last Ozzy fronted Never Say Die ('78) surpasses it. In order to review this properly, I had to painfully re-listen to it one final time. I hope my sacrifice was worth it.\n",
        "\nBlack Sabbath's Master of Reality is a very interesting piece of art to review. Master of Reality is an extremely short but very effective album. As Mr. Iommi would call it, Master of Reality has elements of light and shade. The early 70\u2019s were a ripe time for Sabbath as they were churning out classic albums left and right. Already with the self titled and Paranoid album under their belt, Sabbath begin to experiment with their sound. What resulted is music as heavy as anything that was heard before.\n\nBy today's definition, doom metal bands are extremely heavy. Without getting into specific bands, doom metal is slow and heavy music with crushing riffs. Black Sabbath perfected that exact sound except with much more finesse. Doom and gloom was a tool in their tool belt, but it didn't define their sound. Master of Reality is the pinnacle of that theory. No other 70\u2019s band could have played a song like Children of the Grave and then follow it up with a beautiful instrumental Orchid. That's just one example of how heavy Sabbath could get, only to bring it down with a mellow track. Many bands today put out an album full of all these crushing tunes that relentlessly beat down your throat that they are a metal band. Sabbath had finesse and swagger. Many bands experimented with many different sounds in the 70s, but Sabbath was in the top tier for making that experimentation work within an album.\n\nMaster of Reality is a 34 minute journey that ebbs and flows. The slower songs contrast with the heavy songs and the darker songs contrast with the lighter ones. It's that perfect balance that makes this one of the most metal and heavy albums Sabbath ever did. Solitude is a slow and solemn song that takes the listener down into a deep abyss. All of a sudden the song is over and the closer Into The Void just crushes you with the buzz saw intro. I feel like without Solitude, Into the Void wouldn't be as heavy. They both work with each other and they both need each other to be successful.\n\nIt is evident that Sabbath were hungry at this stage of the game. Sabbath wanted to be the heaviest around. There is a reason they are the metal godfathers that we know them as today. The power and the hunger drove Sabbath in those early days. With Master of Reality, we get the most ambitious Sabbath release. They didn't care about a radio single, it was all about quality to them and that would continue on into the 70s and beyond. Master of reality was far ahead of its time for 1971 and it is still a breath of fresh air in today's standards.\n",
        "\nNever Say Die? Well to many Sabbath purists, this was the end of the band as Ozzy would sing his last tunes with Sabbath. Truly each musician carried on and Ozzy did his solo band but for decades this was the original Sabbath's swan song. A vast departure from the doom and gloom they had previously conquered.\n\nEveryone who knows anything about metal knows this band and knows what the stood for. They are the metal genre but at the same time they are so much more. Ultra heavy riffs that crush your soul were just part of their arsenal. While Sabbath will always be more popular for that style, they were really a Swiss Army knife when it came to genre hopping and musical styles. Constantly evolving and changing. Technical Ecstasy and Never Say Die are often put at the bottom of the pecking order when it comes to top Sabbath albums. It is easy to say that they don't sound like the band, but I see it as a metamorphosis or a change.\n\nNever Say Die is far from a perfect album or even a classic album. It has its moments of brilliance and a great number of shock value when listening to it for the first time. Sabbath play a lot of jazz and they experiment with a lot of different sounds. This was a turbulent time for the band with Ozzy\u2019s troubles and the entire band with their cocaine. It is surprising that they didn't just go into the studio and cut some typical Sabbath that they were known for. Despite all their problems, they fill the album with essentially what a Sabbath fan would never expect.\n\nThat is what is to be loved about this album, its surprise factor. You get jazzy instrumentals, like in Breakout which is so out of left field. Bill Ward sings on a blues track Swinging the Chain. The title track is the albums Paranoid which goes at a breakneck speed. There is a little doom and gloom with Shockwave but the song sounds more upbeat and happy. The album when you break it down is really a train wreck of musical styles but somehow it works. Whether they were trying to fit in with the times or just too drugged up to care, Never Say Die proves to be another unique offering from the four men from Birmingham. I don't think it deserves the panning that it has gotten over the years (I mean Ozzy even hates it!) but I would think only a hardcore Sabbath fan would want to own this. If you understand the phrase Black Sabbath were like the Beatles of heavy metal, then this may be for you!\n",
        "\nWhen Black Sabbath made their self-titled debut and released it on February 13, 1970: something happened. What many have believed as the pivotal creation of heavy metal, it is still quoted as such more than 40 years later. Originally recorded in one day, that one day proved to be the first step into an incredibly popular genre. It was dark, heavy, and haunting. While their debut was undeniably great, many cite Paranoid, their second release, as their best to date, their magnum opus. While it may be an overstatement as the single reason heavy metal is what it is, Paranoid is Black Sabbath at their peak.\n\nThe main selling point about Paranoid is that it never takes time to build, and the performance of the band members is top-notch. Tony Iommi's guitar is as dark and inventive as many say it is, from the cataclysmic midtempo solos of War Pigs, or the famous wah wah melody in Electric Funeral. The bass of Butler is almost godly: the tempos are crushing and wicked. Bill Ward's drumming is set at an incredible pace, showing off skills in the 2-minute instrumental Rat Salad, and the ending of Iron Man. As for the former trait: the tracks are unbelievably creative, showing off spastic energy throughout.\n\nA good example would be War Pigs, the high point of the album because it relies on atmosphere as well as heaviness, and it succeeds in both points. The opener alone should prove that Sabbath has ditched the blues influences altogether, making more space for their signature style: pure, cataclysmic brilliance. The vocals are far from the focal point of the album: the instruments are the dominant, the leading force of the LP. Such facts of that are proven on tracks such as the seven minute Hand of Doom, a bass-and-guitar shared song, shows that while the lyrics are not the focal point, they otherwise paint the atmosphere well, the former a spectacular show of anti-war aggression.\n\nWhile these songs rely on instruments, Planet Caravan is purely based on atmospheric nature, it is otherwise the most unfitting tracks on the album. With a slow, more peaceful bass-and-guitar melody, Osbourne's lyrics have more of an underwater feel and they describe traveling the universe\n\nSaid greatness is copied on Electric Funeral. Featuring a nine-note wah-wah pedal riff, the lyrics describe a post-nuclear world, ravaged by warfare. The vocals do an amazing job of capturing the post-apocalyptic feel (Storm coming, you'd better hide from the atomic tide / Plastic flowers, melting sun / Fading moon falls upon / Burning globe of oxy'n fire, like electric funeral pyre), and the frenzied midtempo section finally showcases some bass lines and a fast-paced drum section. And of course you have the title track Paranoid. From album filler to album hero overnight and for good reason. It rocks like few songs can and yet it is not my favorite from the mighty Sabbath. I can name 10 songs right off the bat I enjoy more.\n\nI'll be completely honest: I was skeptical of Paranoid the minute I heard it. Re-listening to the album, was I overcome with the same sense of awe and nostalgia that millions around the world have felt? Yes! Paranoid is brilliant. Paranoid is brilliant. This album has managed to keep a legacy going for years, along with its predecessor and successor so yes it deserves a 100.\n",
        "\nThough it was barely acknowledged when first released in 1989, it's hard to emphasize just how significant Headless Cross is in the grand scheme of Black Sabbath's career. The Eternal Idol had previously explored a darker sound and introduced what was left of the fanbase to singer Tony Martin, but Headless Cross perfected the style and pushed its strongest elements to even further heights. It wasn't a monolith statement but it could be regarded as the first true Sabbath album since the early 80s.\n\nFor starters, there hadn't been a Sabbath lineup that showed off this much talent and chemistry since The Mob Rules. The production is clearer than The Eternal Idol's had been, giving Goeff Nicholls's keyboards room to provide some admittedly dated atmosphere and allowing drummer Cozy Powell's hard hitting barrages to give extra aggression to Iommi's signature riffs and solos. Tony Martin also seems to be more comfortable this time around, showing off a wide range and dramatic character that was previously limited by a need to match Ray Gillen. Bassist Lawrence Cottle also manages to stand out on the title track despite only playing on this as a session member.\n\n\nThe band's doomy power glam template also allows for varied songwriting. The title track and \"When Death Calls\" are easily the album's strongest tracks as the former recycles the anthemic march of \"Heaven And Hell\" to great effect while the latter has some climactic tempo changes and soaring vocals. Elsewhere, \"Devil And Daughter\" borders on speed metal, \"Black Moon\" effortlessly alternates between blues and power metal, and the closing \"Nightwing\" serves as a grand but ominous ballad.\n\nThe lyrics also opt for a darker tone though this has become a point of contention for some listeners. In contrast to the occult warnings of Sabbath's classic era, Headless Cross is much less subtle and takes cues from King Diamond. The results are about as campy and may be too cheesy for those used to grimmer insights. If anything, pointing out all the times Martin ad libs and references Satan would probably make for a fun drinking game...\n\nLike any good 80s slasher flick, Headless Cross is a little too dated to have the scare factor it may have once had but its excellent performances give it a timeless appeal. Black Sabbath feels renewed here and the album has its share of classics even if they are frequently dwarfed by the band's more famous ventures. It's a shame that this didn't put them back into mainstream relevance but subsequent releases were enough to prove the band's staying power.\n\nHighlights:\n\"Headless Cross\"\n\"When Death Calls\"\n\"Black Moon\"\n\"Night Wing\"\n",
        "\nIt is not unknown for a band to blow their creative load on their debut album by placing all their strongest songs on it and then suffer a sophomore slump with their next record, which ends up mostly filled with the lesser tracks in their repertoire. Conversely, some bands truly find their feet at the second time of asking and fully develop their original sound. 'Paranoid' is the quintessential example of this.\n\nThe record is a quantum leap forward from the debut, in terms of song writing and cohesiveness. The whole band seems tighter, playing more as a single unit of interwoven energies. Gone are the uncertainties that affected the second side of the self-titled album - there is no blues-rock guitar solo showcasing here. Gone, too, are the cover songs. Here we have eight original compositions, fully formed and tightened up from their original drafts. Only 'Rat Salad' allows room for indulgence, being nothing more than a drum solo, but even so it's only a couple of minutes long - noticeably shorter and more to the point than Led Zeppelin's contemporary effort Moby Dick.\n\nSabbath's true power as a band emerges on this record. Nearly ever song has riffs that have become not so much well-known as legendary. While the songs aren't necessarily overly complex or played with an excessive amount of technicality, they are all well-constructed and memorable. 'War Pigs' opens the album with a monstrous dirge of guitars, the bass picking out a line through the murk, and then develops into a heavy yet jazz-inflected groove, with interesting drum work - Ward plays around the riff, jazz-style, instead of providing the back beat. Unusually, many of Sabbath's songs from the Ozzy era use the combined guitar/bass riff as their main underpinning, with the vocals and the drums dancing around the core sound that Iommi and Butler produce. 'War Pigs' is the best example of it. Although it's eight minutes long, the song doesn't drag and has a nice coda of rolling riffage which brings to mind a tank wading through a battlefield. The sudden speed up at the end [done by fast-forwarding the recording tape, maybe?] is a nice touch and a quirky way to bring the song to a close.\n\nThe other songs perhaps aren't quite as individually arranged as War Pigs - a lot of them follow a standard verse/chorus/faster bit/verse/chorus pattern - but they are all distinctive. 'Iron Man' in particular boasts a riff that levels everything in its path and has a really good slow grind to it. 'Electric Funeral' follows the same pattern and is even more dirge-like, a feeling enhanced by the bleak lyrics about nuclear war. 'Hand Of Doom' is more laid back, only really exploding into life at the chorus and the mid-section, but the slothful, lethargic pace of the opening and closing bass line and verses seem quite appropriate for a song where the lyrics starkly warn of the dangers of creeping heroin addiction.\n\nLyrically, almost every song deals with the darker aspects of the world - war, drug abuse, mental illness, gang violence and apocalyptic scenarios. While the lyrics on the debut were noticeably darker than what other bands were writing at the time, on 'Paranoid' Sabbath look at the human condition's darker corners with a relentless determination. Although the lyrics are simple, they get their message across very well and bring to mind fairly stark and honest images, and serve as a good reflection of some of the worries and concerns of the times that the album was recorded in. Interestingly however despite the gloomy themes the music is not overly off-putting or too numbingly downbeat to listen to - the sheer core energy of the riffs and the vitality they contain are life-affirming.\n\nHowever, amid the bleak vistas and concerns about the world, Sabbath do find time to relax a little. While 'Sleeping Village' on the debut album had been little more than an eerie fragment of a song, 'Planet Caravan' not only expands the idea into a fully formed composition but serves as a welcome moment of escapism and reflection away from the riffage and darkness. It's very soothing and quiet, and works beautifully as a counterpart to the first two songs by being placed directly after them. Sabbath would use this tactic on subsequent albums, but not with quite such a calming effect as they managed here.\n\nFinally [as it can't really be ignored] the album contains Sabbath's best known hit, 'Paranoid'. Originally written in about half an hour in order to fill up space on the album, it's a zippy little tune. For a hit single, it has pretty dark lyrics - in 1970, not too many other songs in the charts were tackling mental health issues so upfront and directly - but has a very catchy riff that's ensured its worldwide popularity down through the decades. However, in terms of overall sound it isn't entirely representative of the album [or indeed this period of Sabbath] as a whole, so anyone buying the album on the basis of knowing this one song should expect a few surprises.\n\nSabbath's debut is widely regarded [and rightly so] as a milestone in heavy metal. But for myself, Paranoid is where the band truly found their sound and fully developed into the colossal riff machine of legend. The song writing is better composed, the sound is tighter, the extraneous flab has been trimmed down and what is left is a ferocious, mean, cohesive and precision-cut set of songs. Although there are a few minor complaints [the production is still somewhat thin, and doesn't totally do the heavier aspects of the music justice - these songs sound a lot heavier and more uncompromising live], 'Paranoid' marks a major step forward in Sabbath's career, and to this day is an album that should be in the collection of anyone who is interested in heavy music. And Sabbath were only just getting started....\n",
        "\nBlack Sabbath's debut album which has been considered to be ground zero for heavy metal definitely deserves its props for being highly influential musically, as well as something different for that time period. While other bands such as Blue Cheer and Led Zeppelin have been recognized as pioneers of metal along with Sabbath; I think Sabbath were simply the heavier and more ambitious of the three, and definitely better in regards to lyrical content when compared to Zeppelin. However, I think this debut album is terribly over-rated, and those whom consider this to be the greatest metal album of all time can't possibly believe that. Especially when Black Sabbath would go on to surpass this album in terms of quality twice long before 1972 came around.\n\nBlack Sabbath has its flaws for sure but when this album gets things right it can be quite captivating. The group had some really good chemistry and the production values displays this well enough, with the instruments and vocals coming in quite clear. The doom and bluesy atmosphere can quickly grab the listener's attention. The opening track is just as perfect as everyone claims it to be. It's very atmospheric, creepy, and even mysterious as Ozzy takes his time revealing whom the threat is. The sped up climax caps off this brilliant composition of approaching doom making it by far the best and most memorable song on the album.\n\nAnother stand out happens to be NIB with its haunting lyrics grabbing me the most. This can easily be the second best written song on the album, because lyrically it reflects the darker content the album opened up with. In addition, I find it to technically be among the better with Geezer's bass complimenting Iommi's riffs all too well. Despite how out of place The Wizard feels especially immediately after following the opener, it's still a really solid banger with nice riffs and the harmonics combo to it.\n\nI like Wicked World musically; the melodic bass adds a mesmerizing depth to it that sticks in my head; but I can't stand the ignorance in some of the lyrics. Even in that time period the holes in their argument is wide enough to fit the moon through. The final song combo A Bit of Finger/Sleeping Village/Warning, is a hard, bluesy jam session that caps things off quite nicely. \n\nI can't deny my overall enjoyment for this album and I do acknowledge its importance, but the truth, to me anyway, is that this album is quite inconsistent at times and perhaps only half of it is really actually heavy. Plus Ozzy's tone deaf vocals have their moments of shining, while on others it feels as if Black Sabbath could have used a better singer right then. In closing, this is definitely an album that should be in every metal heads collection, old or new, however I wouldn't claim this as something that should be quickly added into the collection, at least not before their later works such as Paranoid, Master of Reality or Sabotage. Plus ignore the hype of this being the greatest ever. It's just... no, it's not true.\n",
        "\nIn 1978, Black Sabbath released their final album with Ozzy (for a long time) with 'Never Say Die!'. The band pretty much continued their experimentation with \"softer\" rock songs, much like on 'Technical Ecstasy', which was released two years prior to 'Never Say Die!'. As we all know, Black Sabbath had always made sure not to release the same album twice, so if you think that 'Sabotage' and 'Technical Ecstasy' were experimental, then think again, because 'Never Say Die!' takes it a step further.\n\nGone are the doom and gloom that most associate Black Sabbath with, but it's hardly a surprise considering the fact that a number of albums before 'Never Say Die!' were much \"merrier\" to the listener's ears than the band's creepy and bluesy self-titled debut album, the more traditional heavy metal-orientated 'Paranoid', the fuzzy and stoned groove-fest that was 'Master of Reality', and then of course the more experimental and progressive albums that followed suit.\n\nBy the time Black Sabbath released 'Sabotage', which is a brilliant album mind you, the tight-knit chemistry and friendship was beginning to dwindle due to personal issues; mainly caused by a large consumption of alcohol and drugs. 'Technical Ecstasy' can probably be considered a minor bump on the road, when compared to the albums released in prior to it, so how did 'Never Say Die!' fare? Well, pretty much similarly, only tensions within the band climaxed before, during and after the recording and the release of the album.\n\nCritics, and especially fans of the band, weren't pleased with the direction Iommi and co. were heading. That became evident with 'Technical Ecstasy', but it increased with 'Never Say Die!'. And to be honest, Black Sabbath sounded tired.\n\nThere is a great deal of experimentation going on here with the band tapping into different genres, and not only within rock and metal, but also jazz. \"Air Dance\" is the best example of that on 'Never Say Die!'; a song that has a bittersweet sounding guitar and a dreamy piano driving the song. There is a tranquil section in the middle of the song with a spacey atmosphere before it breaks into this jazzy part. It doesn't sound like Black Sabbath at all, if you think of their glory days, but this is certainly not a bad song. In fact, I really like it. It's a very unique song. Furthermore, there is a horn section and a pretty rad saxophone solo on the instrumental track \"Breakout\", which extends the non-hard rock/metal elements on this record. Take it or leave it.\n\nLike I mentioned earlier, there isn't a whole lot of metal going on on this album. The title-track is a fun rocker with a lot of cheese on it. It's a fun listen for a while, but it quickly becomes somewhat mediocre. Oh, and the main-riff sounds eerily familiar to Thin Lizzy's classic \"The Boys Are Back In Town\"! This brings me to another point of this record. It seems like riff-lord Iommi has taken a back-seat on 'Never Say Die!'. The music doesn't necessarily revolve around his amazing axe-work. In fact, it seems like Ozzy's voice is the driving-force here with Geezer following-up with some pretty neat basslines. Take for instance the song \"Junior's Eyes\". It's a great song in my opinion with a psychedelic guitar riff that hovers behind a groovy bassline and Ozzy's vocals. It's got a pretty infectious chorus and a decent guitar-solo from Iommi, but doesn't re-capture what he had done on previous albums. Not even close. Bill Ward isn't left out either. His drumming is always good, and like on 'Technical Ecstasy', he handles the vocals on album closer \"Swinging the Chain\"; a very bluesy rocker, in which he does pretty well as the vocalist.\n\nThere are some more straight-forward rockers present on 'Never Say Die!', too. \"Johnny Blade\" features a Rainbow-like keyboard/synth and a decent, rocking main-riff, but ultimately it fails to live up to its potential, as the song drags on for a bit too long. The same can be said about \"A Hard Road\". Totally mediocre. But, \"Shock Wave\" is better and features perhaps the best guitar-work by Iommi on this album.\n\nTo conclude this review, I have to say that 'Never Say Die!' is a decent album. It doesn't deserve the bashing that it gets (much like 'Technical Ecstasy'). It's misunderstood in the sense that it probably wasn't even meant to be a metal album (again, much like 'Technical Ecstasy'), but unfortunately, the relationship between the individuals of the band had hit rock-bottom, so instead of the natural, free-flow type of chemistry, it seems like a lot of the songs, if not all, are somewhat forced. The music didn't come out naturally like before, and it probably felt more like a chore than a fun hobby to record 'Never Say Die!'.\n\nCredit where it's due, though. Black Sabbath wanted to explore further and push boundaries, like they always did, but the combination of faltering friendships, and other bad things caused by drugs and alcohol, the band probably bit more off than they could possibly chew with this record. So, to me, 'Never Say Die!' is basically 'Technical Ecstasy pt. II', only slightly weaker.\n",
        "\nYou don't need any explanation as to who Black Sabbath is. As a matter of fact, I'm not so sure if I need to type an introduction to this review, 'cos chances are you're already coming up with one in your head. The presence of Black Sabbath in the history of metal is just as prevalent as the presence of Abraham Lincoln in American history. Everything that must be said about them has already been said. \n\nThe riffs of this album, written by Tony Iommi, are somewhat basic and easy to play. The title track especially is an extremely simple riff that only consists of a few power chords. I'm giving that a free pass 'cos this was state of the art at the time of its release. Bear in mind that in 1970, heavy metal was pretty much unheard of. Black Sabbath was pretty much the only \"real\" metal band in existence at that time, and a simple riff like that in the title track could get away with being basic, since nobody else at that time would play something like that. If the album was released today, \"Paranoid\" would be considered one of the worst things ever since people have come up with even more basic riffs in this day in age. I guess it's probably why \"13\" never did so well, 'cos we've heard the riffs found in its songs so many times before. Had it been released in Black Sabbath's heyday, it would've been looked at as a masterpiece. Speaking of masterpieces, we also have the songs that would go on to influence doom metal. \"Electric Funeral\" with its plodding and ominous vibe is one of them. \n\n\"Paranoid\" is also a step up from their previous self-titled debut, since the band has upped its game in so many ways. One way is that they decided to record separate tracks separately, as the previous album had different sounding tracks that combined to make one song (the famous \"N.I.B\" got paired with \"Behind the Wall of Sleep\" as one song for some reason). It kind of draws us away from the whole jam session feel of the previous album, which some people would probably lament the loss of, but to me I think it was necessary to get rid of. As a result, the longest song, \"War Pigs\", doesn't even make it past the 8-minute mark. \n\nThe band has also put some energy into some of the music. While they were pretty heavy, all of the songs on the previous albums seemed pretty slow and lethargic (not that that was a bad thing, mind you), perfect for any doom metaller out there. On \"Paranoid\", however, we get songs that have a lot more aggression and energy, even the slower songs. \"Fairies Wear Boots\" might not be super-fast by any means, but it has more crunch in it that gives it its status as a classic among Sabbath fans. The title track, despite being two minutes long, is pretty much the fastest thing the band had written at that time and it would be one of many tracks on here that would inspire many bands that aren't doom metal in the future.\n\nSome influences of the first album still persist, however, but that's not really a bad thing, since the lethargy of the band's sound is basically its style. I have mentioned earlier the slow and sinister gloom of \"Electric Funeral\", but we've also got \"Hand of Doom\", which hearkens back to the days of the first album. It's pretty soft in some parts like many of the songs from that album and it has that plodding tempo, too. Surprisingly, there's one song on \"Paranoid\" that's completely soft all the way through - \"Planet Caravan\". It's just such a weird track that has a piano instead of guitars and vocals that use a special effect that produces a somewhat watery sound and its origin is pretty much anybody's guess. I suppose that a song such as this wouldn't sound out of place from an album released in the '70s, even if it was one of the first heavy metal bands. Much of the aggressive metal that we know and love didn't exist at that time, so Black Sabbath could totally get away with it. \n\nNot only is \"Paranoid\" basically the cornerstone of heavy metal as we know it, but it's also a must-have for any metal fan out there. It's a classic that is to us as Shakespeare is to high school English teachers. Needless to say, there doesn't need to be much to say about it. It's an album that I'm pretty sure its title track is covered by every fifth grader just starting their band. This album has made its mark that much.\n",
        "\nThe year was 1976 and after a shockingly good streak of excellent album releases, Black Sabbath finally released 'Technical Ecstasy'; an album that isn't as consistently good as the previous ones. I say finally, as if it's a good thing, but I'm sure many people were wondering if the band could do any wrong, and 'Technical Ecstasy' proves us that Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, Bill Ward and Ozzy Osbourne weren't gods but rather demi-gods. So, not completely flawless, but pretty much divine anyway, so who gives a fuck, eh?!\n\nYou really need to listen to this record in the correct mindset, because this is not so similar to the Black Sabbath albums that were released before this one. If you're aware of what direction the band was going (not necessarily down, but experimenting with \"softer tunes\"), then 'Technical Ecstasy' should at least bring you some pleasure. It took me a while to get used to this album. The first time I listened to it, I wrote it off as an abomination and left it to collect dust for a very long time. That would change, when I had listened to Black Sabbath's so-called classics to death. That would be all the albums released before this one, and then the likes of 'Heaven and Hell', 'Born Again' and 'Dehumanizer'.\n\nSo, after all, I gave 'Technical Ecstasy' a second chance, and I'm glad I did, because I found things I almost instantly appreciated after initially abandoning this misunderstood piece of work. The tracks that I instantly fell in love with were \"You Won't Change Me\" and \"Dirty Women\"; the former one opening up in a very doomy fashion, but then breaks into a somewhat bittersweet-sounding hard rock ballad that could be comparable to something that Deep Purple has done; mainly because of the good use of keys. \"You Won't Change Me\" is just a very good song, in my opinion. It is, however, bested by \"Dirty Women\". \"Dirty Women\" is a longer track that can be broken into three sections. The first one being the co-operation between the guitar and keys driving the song (with Ozzy's vocals on top, of course), then there's a fairly long section where Iommi plays a solo type with the continued backing of the keyboard before the song breaks into a more heavy and intense bit with Ozzy howling epically, and finally there's an almost sing-along type of outro. It's a great song; a Sabbath classic, in my honest opinion.\n\nLike I said, initially, these two songs were the only two songs I instantly liked after giving 'Technical Ecstasy' a second chance, but fun rocker \"Back Street Kids\" soon followed, as well as the beautiful and sad \"She's Gone\"; a song with keys matching the importance and greatness they had on 'Sabotage'.\n\n\"It's Alright\" is a ballad with drummer Bill Ward on vocals. It's not an amazing song by any stretch of imagination, but it's a pleasant listen; certainly not a typical Sabbath song, but I like it. This was a track that I didn't like at all to start with, but getting to know the band and its direction more greatly helped me appreciate it and eventually like it more.\n\nThe same can be said about 'Technical Ecstasy' as a whole. I shunned it to start with, because it was so not like the Black Sabbath I knew, but in the end, that's what Black Sabbath is and has always been all about. Experimenting with music. They never released the same album twice and this is just another one among them all. Another thing is that 'Technical Ecstasy' wasn't really meant to be a heavy/doom metal album in any way or shape. I really doubt that the band got together and planned exactly what their next album should sound like. And if you listen to the albums released before 'Technical Ecstasy' and notice where the band is going with their music, this album makes a lot of sense. It was meant to be a softer Sabbath. It was meant to be different.\n\nThat's a risk the band had taken on every record and executed perfectly. 'Technical Ecstasy' wasn't as impressive and successful like experimentation done on albums such as 'Sabbath Bloody Sabbath' and 'Sabotage'. 1976 was a troublesome time for Black Sabbath and whether that had an impact on the quality on some of the tracks on here or not, is debatable. But it seems like Black Sabbath had taken their experimentation on some of the songs here too far, and thus they ended up sounding mediocre in comparison to the band's stronger offerings.\n\n\"Gypsy\", \"All Moving Parts (Stand Still)\" and \"Rock 'n' Roll Doctor\" are all average songs. Sure, they have their moments like Iommi's impressive lead-guitar on \"All Moving Parts (Stand Still)\", but ultimately, these songs are just filler, and if they had been trimmed off the album and 'Technical Ecstasy' was an EP instead, it would be a very good one.\n\nAll in all, 'Technical Ecstasy' is as overlooked as it is misunderstood, so if you decide to listen to this album with the wrong mindset (that is, if you expect it to sound much like the albums released between 1970-1975), then you'll be disappointed. It took me a good while to learn to like this album, and once there, I found it to be an overall decent album. Flawed, but it certainly has good tunes, too, with the highlights being \"You Won't Change Me\" and \"Dirty Women\".\n",
        "\nBlack Sabbath had released five amazing albums from 1970-1973. The band took a well-deserved break from writing and recording new music after a blazing start to their musical career. The Birmingham-based rockers had started out as a heavy blues band with their self-titled debut album and 'Paranoid', then went on to play more straight-forward (and down-tuned) heavy metal with 'Master of Reality' and 'Vol. 4', and the band continued to explore new territories within the heavy music scene by releasing 'Sabbath Bloody Sabbath', which wasn't only heavy, but also combined some soothing, and almost cheerful, progressive rock/metal elements with brilliantly executed acoustic guitars and keyboards.\n\nBlack Sabbath would build on what they created on 'Sabbath Bloody Sabbath' and released the even more experimental and progressive 'Sabotage' in 1975. While not as sophisticated (and in my opinion; amazing) as 'Sabbath Bloody Sabbath', 'Sabotage' has got some of the band's finest moments in terms of evolving and just pure musical enjoyment.\n\n'Sabotage' starts off in a ferocious manner with \"Hole in the Sky\"; a song that has a very heavy and memorable riff and some of Ozzy's finest vocals. It's a relatively straight-forward track, if you compare it with the more technical and progressive semi-epics that are also on this album. The same can be said about a song like \"Symptom of the Universe\", which has a very fast, and almost proto-thrashy main-riff, but then breaks into an acoustic section that is perfectly executed and doesn't interfere with the mean heaviness otherwise heard on this track. \"Thrill of it All\" is another song that is fairly straight-forward and driven by the might riff of Iommi, and is probably the best pure \"metal track\" on 'Sabotage'.\n\nThe more progressive elements are exercised to the fullest on the almost ten minute epic \"Megalomania\". It's got pretty much everything that later prog rock/metal bands would later exercise and further build upon. A quite complex song structure, tempo changes, mood changes... it goes from slow, dark and melancholic to a fast, up-beat song and the song just feels shorter than it really is. \"The Writ\", the album's closing track, can also be considered a semi-epic clocking in at almost nine minutes and shares a similar progressive nature to \"Megalomania\", though, not as impressive in terms of complexity. The keys/synth is also utilized more on 'Sabotage' than ever before on \"Am I Going Insane (Radio)\" and the impressive instrumental \"Supertzar\".\n\nOzzy, Tony, Geezer and Bill are all in great shape too as far as musical talent goes. Ozzy's voice is stronger than ever, Tony's guitar-work is more progressive-orientated, as well as technical and virtuoso-like, than ever before, but still flexes his straight-forward heavy rocking riffs too, and rhythm section Geezer and Bill are as solid and bad-ass as always.\n\nThere is really nothing wrong with 'Sabotage'. I prefer 'Sabbath Bloody Sabbath' by an inch or so, but 'Sabotage' is well and truly a masterpiece in its own right and deserves the highest praise from all metal fans, since it covers pretty much everything that is metal today (except the extreme black and death metal, but you get the point).\n",
        "\nIt was late 1973 and Black Sabbath had already released four albums: 'Black Sabbath' and 'Paranoid' in 1970, 'Master of Reality' in 1971 and 'Vol.4' in 1972. What was clear was that the band was growing; both musically and in popularity. The four Brummies had managed to record and release four excellent albums that were all unique, so on the first day of December, 1973, Black Sabbath released 'Sabbath Bloody Sabbath' and I can imagine that fans were thrilled to see what Iommi and co. had come up with this time.\n\nLadies and gents, 'Sabbath Bloody Sabbath' is quite possibly Black Sabbath's finest record ever and arguably the first true progressive metal album. It's difficult to explain how good this album really is. The band had borrowed all the best elements of the four previous albums and added it into a pool of fresh ideas, in which the river went one direction and that was to the land of awesomeness. No, but really, this is, in my opinion, when Black Sabbath peaked.\n\nInstead of analysing every track to death, I will make it very simple: there is not a single bad track; not even a single bad moment on the entire album. This is pretty much perfection. The combining effect of Black Sabbath taking the best elements of previous albums and adding it into a layer of fresh, progressive ideas worked wonders. 'Vol. 4' was a bit like this, but lacked the cutting edge and execution of 'Sabbath Bloody Sabbath', and also had a much darker and creepier atmosphere.\n\n'Sabbath Bloody Sabbath' is a fun listen. Of course it's not all about being jolly and merry, since Black Sabbath was the opposite of that, at the time when hippies were being overly-happy (ignorant). But the music and some of the lyrics (yes, Sabbra Cadabra, I'm looking at you) are much more up-beat and \"happy\" than on previous records. But naturally, there are also the darker and more mysterious lyrics thrown in the mix.\n\nThe music itself is greatly improved and sounds fresh. There is less of the very dark and doomy sound that the band had become famous for and there was a rapid increase in sophistication in the overall song-structures and progression. There are some very melodic and almost symphonic qualities scattered about and there is also an increase usage of acoustic guitar and keys to add to the more \"sophisticated, progressive\" approach. Take for instance \"Sabbra Cadabra\". It's got an amazing tempo and one of the more famous guitar-work by Iommi, but the song breaks into a synth-heavy part with normal keys subtlety added, too. Another example is \"Who Are You?\" is entirely synth-driven. It must be the only Sabbath track that doesn't feature guitars. Then, we have acoustic guitars in songs such as \"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\", the beautiful instrumental \"Fluff\", the insanely catchy \"Looking for Today\", which also includes a flute, and finally the astonishingly beautiful album closer \"Spiral Architect\".\n\nThis isn't to say that there aren't moments of the good, old, crazy and heavy Sabbath. 'Sabbath Bloody Sabbath' has some of Iommi's greatest axe-work ever. Especially the leads and solos are incredible in some of the songs; most notably \"A National Acrobat\" and \"Killing Yourself to Live\".\n\nI would recommend this album to anyone. Even non-metal fans. This is as good as it gets. I can't point out a single flaw on this record. Heck, there isn't even a moment where poor, old Ozzy sounds a bit off! Also, after Black Sabbath had released 'Sabbath Bloody Sabbath', they would finally get favourable reviews from music critics at the time, which they hadn't; despite releasing four excellent albums before this one. So, I think that says enough. This album is amazing.\n",
        "\nBlack Sabbath's fourth album 'Vol. 4' proved that Black Sabbath were far from done with experimenting with difference methods of manipulating the art of music. Heavy fucking music in this case. On 'Vol. 4' Tony Iommi decided to down-tune his guitar even further from what he did for 'Master of Reality'. Iommi's now very heavy guitar mixed with the fact that the band was recording this album in Los Angeles (first time recording an album outside the UK, if I remember correctly), and were pretty much high on cocaine throughout the whole process, gave this album an atmosphere that was different from the one experienced on any of the three previous albums.\n\n'Vol. 4' starts off pretty fucking fantastically with \"Wheels of Confusion/The Straightener\"; an almost 8-minute epic that gives us an idea where Black Sabbath is heading. The song progresses from a very emotional intro to a bad ass and memorable main-riff. Ozzy's voice is also getting stronger and is becoming a vital ingredient to the Sabbath sound. The song then breaks into a faster section where Iommi is shredding a bit before returning to the main-riff again, and finally the second half of the song (\"The Straightener\") kicks in. A long, awesome instrumental piece that showcases the amazing dexterity of Iommi's guitar-skills. This is the catchiest and most memorable bit of the whole album and definitely one of the stand-out moments in this great band's career, in my opinion. So awesome!\n\nFollowing the excellent album opener is the shorter, but almost as memorable rocker \"Tomorrow's Dream\". It's got a similar feel to the first half of \"Wheels of Confusion/The Straightener\" with a memorable riff and a very decent vocal performance by Ozzy. The song also features a guitar solo that sounds so familiar. Probably because most metal bands in the world have borrowed it at some point (take for instance Church of Misery's \"Shotgun Boogie\". It sounds just like the solo bit in \"Tomorrow's Dream\").\n\nThe rest of 'Vol. 4' shows further experimenting from Black Sabbath. \"Changes\" is the album's token ballad featuring Ozzy's voice, a piano and some background strings. It's a beautiful song, but is unfortunately the weaker of the band's ballads at that point (Planet Caravan and Solitude are definitely stronger). \"Supernaut\", \"Cornucopia\" and \"St. Vitus Dance\" are fairly straight-forward, heavy rockers, but with a unique feel to each one of them to differentiate from one another. \"Snowblind\" is an emotional, metaphoric song about the snow (cocaine), \"Laguna Sunrise\" is a beautiful, acoustic instrumental; very pleasant to have among all the darker songs and album closer \"Under the Sun/Every Day Comes and Goes\" is one of the heaviest and doomiest Sabbath songs ever.\n\n\"FX\" is the only odd one. It's an instrumental that serves no real purpose other than freaking out a high person who's listening to this album. It's a typical psychedelic drone of some sort, but to make it a track on its own was probably not necessary. Minor, minor complaint only, though. \n\n'Vol. 4' is definitely a time where Black Sabbath went on to experiment even more unexplored areas of the heavy music scene. This album is a tad less consistent compared to 'Paranoid' and 'Master of Reality' (on par with 'Black Sabbath'), but has its great moments. The overall feel is gloomier than usual; perhaps and most likely an indicator of where the band was heading; though there would be a massive and awesome skipping stone of fantastic albums before the Ozzy-era's demise. The unknown area and the large amounts of drugs took a toll on the band, but they were still eager to continue their streak of great, heavy records and weren't afraid to experiment to achieve this.\n",
        "\n1970 had gone by and the four strange Brummies under the moniker Black Sabbath had already released two very impressive, dark and heavy records: 'Black Sabbath' and 'Paranoid'. Both of these records laid down the foundation to what we know as heavy metal; basically evil sounding and aggressive blues. While these two albums weren't particularly hailed by music critics at the time, the average heavy rock fans adored them, so it was pretty clear that Black Sabbath was up to something special.\n\nIn 1971 the band released 'Master of Reality'. They once again managed to craft a new collection of music different from the previous record(s), much like 'Paranoid' was different from 'Black Sabbath'. Tony Iommi had created a brand-new way of playing heavy music by turning blues into something evil and corrupt with the simplest of riffs on the famous (and the first doom metal song) \"Black Sabbath\". On 'Paranoid', he had reduced the blues elements to an extent where the music was more free-flowing, heavy and gritty, but still maintained a healthy dose of the blues evident on songs like \"War Pigs\", \"Hand of Doom\" and \"Fairies Wear Boots\". Prog elements had also been injected to the classic sophomore album.\n\nOn 'Master of Reality' however, Iommi decided to down-tune his guitar (Geezer's bass followed suit) and began writing more straight-forward, aggressive riffs and voila! The world's first true stoner metal album was born. The free-flowing heaviness and grittiness of 'Paranoid' was amplified through the deeper, simpler and more aggressive riffs. You could perhaps say that Black Sabbath became even more headbangable by the time this album was released. This doesn't mean that the music was completely stripped off technicality. Prog elements were indeed being experimented with on 'Master of Reality', too. The opening track \"Sweet Leaf\" has a SWEET mid-section that is truly epic in its own rights.\n\nLyrics ranged from the sweet leaf (weed, duh!) to religion (\"After Forever\") and war and terror (\"Children of the Grave\"), (\"Lord of This World\") and (\"Into the Void\"). There is also a mellow and quite depressive ballad called \"Solitude\", as well as some short instrumentals that give 'Master of Reality' a good variety of music, which is a clear indication that there was more to come from Black Sabbath. This was just the start, and what a great one. In less than two whole years the band had already released three very impressive records that, despite not sitting well with music critics at the time, blew the fans of heavy music away.\n\nIndividually, the band were also on the up. Tony Iommi's guitar is and will remain true art. In that day and age nobody could do what he did. He turned something so simple into something so awesome and spiced things up with some sick leads and solos. You could say the same about Geezer Butler's basslines. It's almost like him and Iommi were jamming in a joint womb; their chemistry was and is second to none. Bill Ward's jazz-trained drumming is also something that gives the great music on this album a certain spice; a great quality that works perfectly with Iommi's and Butler's string-wrangling. Good, old Ozzy who has never been the greatest singer (bless him) was also improving gradually along with the rest. What he lacks in an actual singing-voice, he makes up with charisma that he seems to be able to pull from his ass at any given time. His haunting bellows also go hand-in-hand with the equally mysterious music.\n\n'Master of Reality' is a must-listen for all fans of heavy music. It's impossible not to like this album.\n",
        "\nLet's face it, even if we don't listen to them that much, we all know who Black Sabbath are; they're the band that started everything. That's not a hyperbole, either, they literally began heavy metal music as we know it (although some would argue that it was Steppenwolf or Deep Purple who should have the honor of starting it). Despite not being completely perfect, this album, \"Black Sabbath\" laid the foundations for what was to become the music genre we all know and love. \n\nWhen people first heard the title track in 1969, they were terrified. All it took were three ominous chords, and the stage was set, the song also having dark lyrics relating to Gothic imagery and the occult that up until now, no one ever dared use in their own songs. A new sound that made use of dark and intimidating imagery was born; a sound which had not been heard before. Before Sabbath, the hardest anyone's ever gotten was Led Zeppelin, and by our standards, it wasn't very heavy. Come to think of it, the music on this album isn't as heavy as the stuff we're used to listening to more, but at the time of its release, \"Black Sabbath\" was the most terrifying sound that any musician could ever achieve. It's part of the reason why the band got popular in the first place, people were afraid of those three chords int he title track, but at the same time, they were either curious, or blown away by them. \n\nIf you listen to the other songs on this album, though, they're actually just like any other classic hard rock song. The main difference between Sabbath and other bands is the wailing of Ozzy's voice. While other bands around at the time would have their vocalists growl and roar, Ozzy would simply wail and moan, suggesting a gloomy tone to the song. If the band used any other vocalist, songs like \"The Wizard\" would be nothing more but a Steppenwolf clone, even with the fancy fretwork of Tony Iommi. Ozzy, however, puts some flavor into the song with his unique voice, making it more original. If you listen even closer to the songs, you'll realize the band's influence wasn't so much rock, as it was blues. Some of the riffs and solos in the songs on here utilize a pentatonic scale commonly found in blues songs. The band also uses power chords, common with many bands at the time, but due to the guitars being heavier than before, songs like \"N.I.B.\", which feature these chords, sounded like something completely new.\n\nAlso common with some bands at the time, like Led Zeppelin, is the fact that the band tended to play some of their songs all in one go. That meant that we get quite a few songs all in one track. Although later editions of this album have the songs separated into their own track, my own copy features \"Wasp\", \"Behind the Wall of Sleep\", \"Bassically\", and \"N.I.B.\" all in one track. For a person that wants to listen to the cool power chords that make up \"N.I.B.\", this can be a huge inconvenience. Subsequent albums released by Sabbath wouldn't have this problem, as they recorded all of their songs separately, but the songs on here are also proof of really long jam sessions that happened in the studio. I guess it's 'cos the band wanted to give it a somewhat natural flow, as if you were actually at their gig. But there are some people that just want to hear \"N.I.B.\", not the whole jam, okay? Fortunately, this does not pertain to some versions of the album, but on mine, it does.\n\nEven if you're one of those people that say that Steppenwolf were the ones that laid the foundation of heavy metal just 'cos they coined the term in their song \"Born to be Wild\", there's no denying that Black Sabbath made metal what it is today. It also had a hand in the birth of doom metal, the subgenre that would try and recreate (or rip off) Black Sabbath's signature sound. It has some blues, and it has some rock, but \"Black Sabbath\" would be the album that would solidify the presence of heavy metal in the decades to come.\n",
        "\nWhat can I say that hasn't been said already about Black Sabbath? Probably not much. Black Sabbath is (debatably) the first metal band, and clearly the most influential of the early metal bands. Their mix of blues and rock and making it very, very dark, was something that hadn't been done before (arguably), and truly made an impact. Any band that plays metal will tell you, Sabbath was an important and early influence. But for a band that has been releasing albums for 44 years now, some records have to be more important than others and some records better than others, and that leaves us with Paranoid. \n\nParanoid is the product of a real working band. It was their second album to come out in the year 1970, and two albums a year is no small feat, even back then when it was common for bands to quickly release albums. This makes the focus of Paranoid quite an oddity. The band sounds like they've had plenty of experience making albums and writing songs, two things that really aren't true. When compared to their debut, this almost feels like a band at the end of their career, not a band only now releasing their sophomore album. This is an album where the band knows what it wants to do, and they know how to do what they want to do effectively.\n\nThe first half of the album is pure classic material. War Pigs/Luke's Wall, Paranoid, Planet Caravan, and Iron Man. Three of these are classic rock radio staples, and the fourth, even if you haven't heard it outside this album, is a very important song in its own right. The song is basically about floating through the universe with ones lover and the songs sound reflects this. The song has been covered by Pantera on their 1994 disk, Far Beyond Driven.\n\nThe second side is where things start to drop a bit. Not that the songs are bad by any means, in fact 2 are real classics. Electric Funeral, Hand of Doom, Rat Salad, and Jack the Stripper. The first two are awesome and up to par with side A, it's really the last two where things fall off a bit. Two bad, and really these songs are bad either they just aren't as good as the other songs on side A, songs doesn't equal a bad album, but here it comes at the tail end of the record, leaving me with almost a bad aftertaste. This is too bad, as had those songs been else where it wouldn't feel that way. \n\nStill, the album is focused. It's a fair improvement over Black Sabbath the album, and is also a large step forward in heavy metal history. The songs here are, bar the last 2, consistent and of good quality. Admitting, there isn't much variation here, and so the album can get a bit boring at the end, which when combined with the two lower quality songs at the end, make the album feel both longer and kinda boring. Still, if you call yourself a metalhead, but you don't own this, you aren't a real metalhead until you do.\n",
        "\nHow Black Sabbath managed to release their sophomore album 'Paranoid' the same year they released their excellent self-titled album is, in itself, rather amazing. The Brummies chose to go for a darker theme than the 'peace and love' charade at the time, and did so to great effect. While Black Sabbath used themes such as occultism, black magic and fantasy in their first record, they chose to use actual horror themes from real life for 'Paranoid', such as war and nuclear weaponry; something that's very evident in songs like \"War Pigs\", \"Electric Funeral\" and \"Hand of Doom\", but there are more fantasy-based songs on here, too, such as \"Planet Caravan\" and \"Iron Man\". \n\nApart from the lyrical themes, the music itself is somewhat different from the 'Black Sabbath' album. 'Black Sabbath' was heavily inspired by blues and it was the dominating element, but on 'Paranoid' the blues have taken a back-seat to a more wild and heavy approach. The song \"Paranoid\" is a great example of this. It's very simple, the beat is steady and the tempo remains on a relative fast note. There are of course strong blues moments present, too. \"War Pigs\" is essentially a heavy as shit blues rocker and features a mean solo by Iommi towards the mid-section of the song before it breaks into a part known as \"Luke's Wall\" which; needless to say, is awesome. And this is clearly a sign that Black Sabbath are becoming more and more progressive with their sound. Furthermore, \"Fairies Wear Boots\" is an even better example of this, as it's even bluesier than \"War Pigs\" and has got some strange, but very cool tempo changes. Speaking of new sounds, \"Planet Caravan\" is a trippy, spacey ballad about flying through space with your lover. Isn't that rad? It's a very good, relaxed tune nestled between the wild, bluesy metal fest.\n\nThere are other goodies on this album. \"Electric Funeral\" is evil. Just pure evil. \"Hand of Doom\" is mellow metal track with a bass opening and general formula that has been copied by countless of bands over and over again... some chill bass with laid-back drumming, somewhat quiet vocals, and then BOOM guitar crashes in loudly. \"Rat Salad\" is a brief instrumental where the focus shifts onto Ward's drumming. And then of course there is \"Iron Man\", whose opening riff is known to most people, be they fans of metal or not. Also, Ozzy's vocals seemed sharper and better than on their debut album, so that's also a plus.\n\nOverall, 'Paranoid' seems more thought out and focused than its predecessor. Although, the band states that 'Paranoid' was written while on tour, they somehow managed to make it sound like something they had been concentrating on writing for much longer. Heck, the song \"Paranoid\" was written as a last-minute filler. It took them about 20 minutes to create and finish it, and it became one of the most famous heavy rock songs ever. Whatever the Sabs were doing during this time, it was working.\n",
        "\nTony Iommi was still the man in the '80s, but fewer people took note. \"The Eternal Idol\" is loaded with impressive riff work and Black Sabbath have always carried a mighty blues influence and a lot of the material on hand here echoes that. \"Born to Lose\", \"Hard Life to Love\" and \"Nightmare\" are all prime examples of this: simple and old-fashioned, yet effective. \n\nAlthough blues-influenced hard rock didn\u00b4t sound like a hot thing in the mid-'80s, that\u00b4s what Black Sabbath was always about. Many fans always cite Ronnie James Dio as the superior vocalist compared to Tony Martin, but I don\u00b4t know. Sure, Dio\u00b4s range is one of a kind, but Martin\u00b4s more down-to-earth approach suits these songs like a glove. Can\u00b4t imagine \"Hard Life to Love\" rocking as good as it does here if it was fronted by Dio. \"Lost Forever\" is the more '80s spiritual cousin to \"Symptom of the Universe\", one of the fastest and trashiest songs they\u00b4ve ever done to my knowledge. \n\nAnother significant thing about this era of Tony Iommi and crew is the use of keyboards. The final releases with Ozzy hinted at this and even \"Sabotage\" and \"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\" were heavy on psychedelic organ work. This came back on \"Eternal Idol\" in a big, very '80s way. The intro to \"Nightmare\" will give you flashbacks to the scores for \"Nightmare on Elm Street\" (no surprise since I heard it was actually planned to be included on the soundtrack to one of the sequels) and in general the keys sound rather spooky and epic without being cheesy. Lots of clean guitars, too - check out the intro to \"The Shinning\" and the beautiful semi-acoustic break in \"Glory Ride\". \"Scarlet Pimpernel\" is a purely acoustic interlude, bringing to mind \"Orchid\" on \"Master of Reality\" and further deepens the fact that both albums are indeed done by the same band.\n\nIf \"The Eternal Idol\" has a flaw it\u00b4s that none of the songs really scream \"highlight\" or \"instant classic\". There isn\u00b4t a new \"N.I.B\" or \"Solitude\" here, but what there is is on a constantly excellent level. Every song is somewhat distinctive and there are no low points either. The production sounds very '80s, but not at all dated, and I think this aspect of the record has aged rather well, although it makes \"Eternal Idol\" somewhat arena rock-ish, but that can be a good thing and it is here. On a side note, you gotta hand it to Martin-era Sabbath. \"Headless Cross\", \"Tyr\", and \"Eternal Idol\" have totally kick ass album covers. Look at this cover and tell me it\u00b4s not a huge improvement over \"Paranoid\" and \"Sabotage\".\n\nSo yeah, for me the one era of Black Sabbath past \"Never Say Die\" was from \"The Eternal Idol\" to \"Tyr\". Not too many fans see it that way and so this is also likely to remain the most obscure era in Sabbath history. I have no idea why as this rocks harder and better than most.\n",
        "\nThis is the first proper heavy metal album. Some critics try and point to the first two Led Zeppelin albums as being the origin of 'metal', or even cite Deep Purple's In Rock as a foundation stone, but they're wrong. Those albums are very good, but they are, essentially, hard rock records. An actual metal album can always be told apart, because it will have a certain weight and vibe to it that hard rock music just doesn't have.\n\nNowhere is this distinction better illustrated than by comparing the first song here, \"Black Sabbath\" with the openers from Zeppelin's early albums. In 1970, absolutely nothing else sounded like this. The eerie sound of rain and a tolling bell immediately set up a far more gothic, bleak ambiance than anything that had gone before. And then THAT riff slams in. Three simple notes, arranged sparsely, but with an enormous, core-energy power from the bass and guitar playing in unison which had not been laid down on tape before - the traditional blues roots of the song are mixed with an element of classical music's dynamics and sounds to create something a step above everything else at the time. The lyrics too immediately stand out as noticeably darker - none of the usual Zeppelin/Purple subject matter, but something filled with dread and fear. Track one, side one and heavy metal arrives and pays its calling card. The production is quite basic, however [not surprising given that the album was recorded on a small budget] and this perhaps robs the song of some of its power and heft - it's worth checking out the BBC Session track released on the 90s Ozzy solo compilation The Ozzman Cometh to hear the definitive version of this song.\n\nThe opening track really is what makes this album, and elevates it from a somewhat ordinary debut into a pioneering moment in musical history. Not to say that the other songs here are bad, but most of them can clearly be traced back to bands like Cream, Zeppelin, even the harder elements of Hendrix - they're more variations on the blues rock/hard rock template as opposed to the groundbreaking title track. Side One is fun to listen to, especially the almost bouncy rolling groove of \"Behind The Wall Of Sleep\" [again with some rather mysterious and interesting lyrics] and the harmonica-enhanced stomp of \"The Wizard\". \"N.I.B.\" is still a regular in the Sabbath live show to this day, and boasts some harder riffing, although the production again lessens the impact of the tune.\n\nSide 2 is more diverse, and features only three tracks [some versions of this album add a fourth, an original composition entitled \"Wicked World\"]. The cover song \"Evil Woman\" sounds noticeably more lightweight than the rest of the album, though it is catchy. The delicate acoustic interlude \"Sleeping Village\" though is an underrated highlight and would have been nice to have heard expanded into a full song. As such it nicely sets up an atmospheric interlude which is another indicator of how this record differs from what went before - this is no \"Black Mountain Side\", but rather an eerie, sombre observation. This snippet would also set the template for Sabbath to include at least one lighter acoustic spot on each one of their first six albums, as a way of breaking up the heaviness.\n\nFinally, we have the Aynsley Dunbar cover \"Warning\" and this is where the album hits its major stumbling point. The actual rendition of the song itself isn't bad at all [it has quite a decent riff], but in the middle it's stretched out by Iommi doing some very long passages of soloing. Now Iommi isn't a bad solo player, but he sounds better doing it in a live setting, or if on record doing it over the top of a song, rather than stopping an entire track to just solo for minutes on end. It feels awkward, and interrupts the flow of the song. If you're a big fan of blues rock style guitar showmanship, this will probably be more enjoyable, as it is I'm forced to knock a few points off the rating here as this section gets pretty boring to listen to at times.\n\nOn a purely musical basis, this record is a solid first effort, although there are some lesser moments and the production saps it of vitality in places. Strictly speaking I think I'd give this somewhere between 75% and 80% on that basis - it's good, sure [and the cover art is excellent], but from their second record on Sabbath would refine their sound and focus and produce much more consistent albums [until the drugs affected the songwriting in the late 70s]. For my Sabbath fix, most days I tend to reach for Master Of Reality/Vol. 4/Sabotage rather than this record. However on a basis of historical importance and worth, this is easily 100%, and taking this into account I think a score somewhere in the 80%-86% range is appropriate. This is where it all starts - heavy metal arrives on this record, with the title track, and music would never be the same again.\n",
        "\nThere is no need to introduce the most awaited metal comeback release of the year, because everything has already been said. So let\u2019s head straight to the music written and performed by Ozzy Obsourne, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, and session drummer Brad Wilk (of Audioslave and Rage Against The Machine fame).\n\nAfter only a few seconds, it\u2019s as if you were back in 1980 and the band had never parted ways with Ozzy Osbourne. All early Black Sabbath trademarks are still there. Ozzy Osbourne\u2019s vocals sound imperfectly perfect, and haven\u2019t changed a bit during all these years, despite all the alcohol and drug abuse. Tony Iommi\u2019s slow-motion signature riffs are depressive and heavy as always, and the bass guitar play by Geezer Butler is solid but somewhat overly conspicuous. In a few tracks, the bass guitar is too dominant. But that\u2019s the only flaw of the production signed off on by Rick Rubin. In fact, the production sounds grounded and timeless, not too modern and loud as on Metallica\u2019s Death Magnetic for example. Traditional Black Sabbath fans should feel relieved by now. The drum play by Brad Wilk is well-integrated into the band\u2019s sound, but also sounds a little bit shy and slowed at some moments. A more dynamic and unique touch would have been an interesting addition, but the way it has turned out, his drumming performance is rather close to the skills of Bill Ward.\n\nI feel that the album tries too venture too far back to the early days of the band. The riffs in the dragging and poorly-chosen opener \u201cEnd Of The Beginning\u201d immediately remind me of the legendary \u201cBlack Sabbath\u201d song, and the closing moments of the last track \u201cDear Father\u201d, with sounds of bells, rain, and thunder is also copied from the same track. Many of the new songs are too closely inspired by several classics of the band\u2019s first ten years. There are a few too many d\u00e9j\u00e0-vu (or better said, d\u00e9j\u00e0-entendu) moments on this release.\n\nNevertheless, the overall impression of this record remains very positive. The shorter tracks are especially captivating and energizing. I would cite the fun ride that is \u201cLoner\u201d for example, and also the dynamic mid-tempo anthem \u201cLive Forever\u201d. A few bonus tracks like the strong \u201cMethademic\u201d hit the same vein. In my opinion, the band should have used the four bonus tracks for another regular record, along with four other new songs, rather than backloading this album.\n\nThe longer tracks definitely require a lot of patience. In the beginning I found \u201cGod Is Dead?\u201d rather unspectacular, but eventually I found that the simplistic doom metal riffs, the haunting vocals, and the gripping signature lyrics work very well together, and this first single really grew on me. The bluesy touch in \u201cDamaged Soul\u201d where Ozzy Osbourne plays the harmonica is also a well-written grower.\n\nThe most outstanding song on the release is, without a doubt, \u201cZeitgeist\u201d. It\u2019s a psychedelic, slow, and wafting rock song with laid back acoustic guitars, smooth percussion work, and strange vocal effects. It sounds a little bit like a possible sequel to \u201cPlanet Caravan\u201d to me, and is a welcome break amidst all the depressing riffs and lyrics. It lightens up this otherwise dark record.\n\nWhat we have here in the end is a very solid record that goes back to the early days of the band \u2013 but it\u2019s not a masterpiece. What I\u2019m missing is a truly catchy track like the diversified \u201cBible Black\u201d from Heaven And Hell, or a shorter potential hit single like \u201cLet Me Hear You Scream\u201d from the last Ozzy Osbourne solo release. This record doesn\u2019t care about conformity, evolution, or modernity, and Black Sabbath simply plays what it does best. That\u2019s probably why the final result doesn\u2019t only sound familiar, but also quite sympathetic. 13 sounds coherent and relevant, despite its nostalgic touch. It\u2019s a little miracle that this doom metal dinosaur is still alive and still celebrating a genre that has long since gone out of vogue. They deserve all of our respect. As long as these guys are still able to do so, I\u2019m hoping for other records in the near future. Any fan of doom or heavy metal should of course call the limited edition with four bonus tracks his or her own.\n\nOriginally written for Black Wind Metal\n",
        "\nReleased extremely quickly after their self-titled debut, Paranoid completes the one-two punch that Black Sabbath set out to deliver to the public in 1970. This is arguably Black Sabbath's most popular and most recognized album as it has garnered a reputation as a classic over the years and as one of the first metal records to hit it big. It's hooks have given Paranoid unparalleled rock radio staying power and It's more clever and innovative artistic moments make it a musical statement as praised in the underground as it is in the mainstream. Doom metal also seems to be in the fetal stage with Paranoid as slow, muddy riffs slog along in their misery and melancholy, creating an ominous picture that is described in Ozzy Osbourne's sometimes foreboding, sometimes strange, and sometimes epic lyrics. The innovative Sabbath style of sluggish, overwhelming, loud, distorted noise added to the mix of bluesy riffs and 60's rock hooks create an album that not only breaks ground, but stands it as well.\n\nParanoid features a heavier, tighter, and all around more refined sound than the self-titled had. It's also takes the long, drawn out jams of the first record and instead go for the route of writing more compact and coherent songs. The tracks go on for much longer and feature Tony Iommi playing around with his guitar techniques, crafting big, technical solos and building songs out of the jam rhythms to create a very tasty combo of songs. Paranoid also seems to ramble for less than their self titled due to the fact that the songs move much faster and have more catch, as opposed to Tony just showing off with massive jams. While that was somewhat entertaining on their debut album, here it's more streamlined, less fatty, and more appropriate. Paranoid is basically where Black Sabbath turns a lot of the rougher bits of their self-titled into something much more meaningful and memorable, and as a result we're given a classic and catchy, yet bizarre, rough, and overwhelmingly loud record that smoked nearly everything back then on terms of heaviness.\n\nThe mixture of Tony's guitar play, Geezer's dark and unorthodox lyrics, and Ozzy's haunting voice give plenty of musical density to this album as best exemplified by it's songs. War Pigs starts off with roaming guitars that give the impression of smoke over the battlefield just before the big fight. Then with a strike of the guitar and a steady pounding on the drums signify the fight has begun and it's time to charge in. Ozzy's narrative plus a kicking main riff do plenty to cement this number's classic status. These catchy characteristics are explored further on such radio staples as Iron Man and Paranoid. Iron Man and Hand of Doom end up building on the doom elements introduced into the first album and refining them to make them less like slapdash jams and more like well structured songs which enhances the memorability and mood conveyed by the murky, riff-heavy trudges that these two songs deliver to us. To fans of the old jamming, they need not despair for that hasn't disappeared completely for their sound, what with the jazzy Rat Salad and the incredibly soft, but brain-twistingly psychedelic Planet Caravan which relaxes and at the same time conjures trippy imagery in the mind. Bluesy riffs with jazz accents guide the listener through all of Paranoid's songs and welcome you to the bizarre realms inside the minds of Black Sabbath. With insane imagery, catchy writing, and just an enjoyable hint of crushing gloom, Paranoid definitely puts it's listener in for a satisfying experience.\n\nIn short, this is arguably one of the first true classics of metal ever. Paranoid improves markedly on it's predecessor to give us a memorable, high-quality album with a moderate portion of gloom to further enhance Black Sabbath's reputation for creating dingy yet catchy hard rock. For metal fans searching for a well known breakthrough for the genre, look no further.\n",
        "\nNo point dressing it up, or hiding it behind a long intro paragraph: while this album is really competent- definitely the technically best Sabbath record they'd done up to this point- it's also really boring. It used to be an album I rather enjoyed- my favourite Sabbath album, even, but as the early Ozzy records grew on me to the point where I genuinely really liked them (as opposed to some \"appreciate for historical value\" bs), Mob Rules is revealed to be what it is: a rather boring album, an album that sounds like it was made by studio pros for studio pros, an album with little in the way of energy and with about as much atmosphere as the moon.\n\nSome songs do rip a bit- Turn Up The Night sounds half finished, but the main riff and chorus is cool, Falling Off The Edge of The World is a real Iommi-by-numbers deal but has nice parts (until the main riff gets driven into the ground), and the title track does actually have a bit of bite to it, one of those rare actually-heavy Dio Sabbath moments. Three songs out of nine songs, though, and the rest, well. It's competent, but also rather comatose- mid paced, sleepy hard rockers with excellent vocals, riffs that have been played before and in much cooler ways, boring ballads with excellent vocals, boring everything! Boring boring boring. With excellent vocals.\n\nWhether it's Voodoo's profoundly half assed main riff that never seems to end, Slipping Away's profoundly half assed main riff that never seems to end, Country Girl's profoundly half assed main riff that never seems to end, or The Sign of The Southern Cross's profoundly half assed main riff that never seems to end, entertainment value is really hard to find here, unless if your idea of a good time involves slow/mid paced riffs with the energy of a coma patient. One wonders if the limitations of working with someone like Ozzy were actually necessary for Iommi and co. to come up with cool shit- that otherworldly, rather nasal whine that required similarly otherworldly riffs and ideas to compliment it. Without it, or perhaps, with a competent singer who could hold his own, there's a slide into a comfort zone, into mediocrity, into fuck-man-i'm-super-bored territory.\n\nAnd look, it certainly \"sounds good\", don't get me wrong. The guitar tone is delicious, the rhythm section sounds great, the use of synths, effects etc is tasty as; it's a big sounding album. But those are comments that you could apply to nearly any album by a big band. If anything, a rougher production could've done wonders for the album; lending it a bit of the rawness and heft that it so desperately needs. It's all polished, it's all just there, without doing anything more.\n\nTo conclude, then: I've said \"boring\" a few billion times in this review, so allow me to rephrase: it's a really unexciting album, full of nothing-ish hard rock riffs that an Iommi 10 years prior would've never bothered to record. Turns out the dudes who are all \"only Ozzy sabb is real\" actually have a real point!\n",
        "\nThe 'black sheep' in the title refers to the status of this record among all the other influential and good quality Black Sabbath offerings. We all know little (or more) about Black Sabbath's history, their line-up changes, their music, their influence in the metal scene and their fame. We also know some harsh truths as well, one of them being that the Ozzy era gets way too much credit while the later 80s and 90s albums (except for the Dio years) gets almost no credit. A shame indeed, as we will see that Sabbath did not run out of fuel once Dio exited the band.\n\nBorn Again was a bit of an oddball for me. It was an album that you either would just love it, or you would hate it to the core. If anything, it managed to polarize Sabbath's fan-base which I think it was a good idea (too much solidarity kinda blows) but at the same time it represented the clear path of decline for the band. Seventh Star was another oddball as it tried to borrow a few things from what was commerical in rock music during that time (pointing at the glam scene from the US) but it got a little bit underrated simply because it was supposed to be a solo project of Iommi, rather than a Sabbath release. The Eternal Idol marked the real revival of the band, even though the record was plagued by inconsistencies in the song-writing deparment and the newly appointed vocalist, Tony Martin did not have enough time to settle within the band.\n\nAnd here comes Headless Cross. Luckily, this album was not done in a 'headless' manner, Iommi seemed to have invested a lot of energy and passion in it, thus it sounds fresh but at the same time, I believe it to be the darkest album Sabbath ever recorded. It is also a semi-conceptual album revolving around the incidence of black murrain in Medieval England as Headless Cross seems to be a real location, not an invented one. But when things are said and done, Iommi is not the only factor that manage to make this album sound great. It is also the contribution of Tony Martin that made this album what it is.\n\nTony Martin, in my view, is a vocalist that does not have the wide range and vocal spectrum like his predecessor and he can't hit the high notes that Ronnie James Dio could, which for a part of the fan-base might've been a bummer, although he can sing in a more varied way compared to Ozzy. For me, Tony Martin gets the second place as the best vocalist Sabbath ever had in its line-up. Same like Dio, Martin also has his way of providing a deep and emotional performance, especially on songs such as 'When Death Calls' (which features a guitar solo done by Brian May of Queen's fame) which is probably the darkest song Sabbath ever created (atmospheric wise) since their debut. Also, the other band members had an important contribution as well and here I mention the late Cozy Powell with his drumming that partially reminded me of Bill Ward and the keyboardist Geoff Nichols from Quartz' fame.\n\nIommi and the gang this time preferred to play with some occult lyrical themes, a sensitive issue since the band has always been haunted by people that would use their reputation for their own benefit, and also by people that would just criticize them for this sort of exposure. Regardless, I did not find any of their previous material anywhere near satanic, but it seems like Tony Martin really had some balls when he came up with these lyrics. The eponymous song and When Death Calls feature minor mentions of Satan, but not in the worshiping way that you see in some death metal bands (Deicide) or black metal bands (you name them). If anything, they just use it as a sort of scarecrow, rather than a character worthy of being worshiped or admired. \n\nSabbath also presents fast-paced tracks (as opposed to the mid-paced tracks that I already mentioned) such as 'Devil and Daughter', track on which Martin proves that he possesses healthy lungs too. 'Kill in the Spirit World' is also a nice track that features a pop-rock riff, probably a remnant of the Seventh Star recording period which later develops into an incredibly heavy and evil atmosphere with Iommi provinding some evil riffage that blows your mind. 'Call of the Widl' does not argue about our daily toilet needs, but how nature pisses on us, literally! Initially, this song was supposed to be named 'Heroes' but I am glad that they discarded this song title (even though it got discarded for a stupid reason) as this one fits the theme of the song much more.\n\n'Black Moon' is a B-side track from the recordings of The Eternal Idol played in a different key which does not sound all that bad. At the very least it maintains the quality of the record while being more bluesy and doomish than the previous ones while the closing song, 'Nightwing' represents another highlight of this offering which plays with the tempo all along until the end. Yeah, there is another track featured as a bonus on the picture disk but I am glad that it will stay there as it feels like it is from another movie.\n\nAll in all, Black Sabbath basicaly reentered on the metal map with this record and has proven that they were not yet devoid of creativity. The new members brought a breath of fresh air in the song-writing department and Martin even brought new insights in the lyrical department as there was no Geezer Butler to cary out in this domain anymore. Suffice to say, except for the production quality, you can't really complain about this record as there are basicaly no flaws other than a weak bonus track. Unfortunately, the Tony Martin era gets way too easily discarded because of the fame of the other two frontmen which is ashame since he ain't a bad frontman either. If you wish to check out this era of Sabbath, then I think Headless Cross is the perfect choice to begin with.\n",
        "\nWithout going too much into history, Black Sabbath's self-titled debut album was released during the hippie movement. Peace, love and drugs ruled; also in music, and were a way to escape from the much darker reality. Black Sabbath, though, created a different type of music. Instead of cowering of fear when faced with the world's more sinister topics, they thrived on it and created what is now an album that pretty much started this wonderful genre of hard rock music called heavy metal.\n\nI would indeed be lying if I said that the four Brummies didn't use drugs to create music. They absolutely did, and more so than many bands at the time, but what they did differently was the fact that they took on the darker subjects instead of escaping them. To be fair, more of the actual real-life problems were more apparent on later records such as 'Paranoid', while 'Black Sabbath' is a more fantasy-based album with dark, shadowy entities and wizards (the title track and \"The Wizard).\n\nBlack Sabbath obviously hadn't found \"their sound\" yet by the time their debut album was released. The music here isn't heavy metal as we know it, but rather a mix of their musical backgrounds i.e. blues and hard rock. But to say that the songs on this album aren't heavy would be a wretched lie. The doomy and eerie intro/main riff in the opening song (title-track) was so game-changing in the art that is music at the time, and to this day remains a blueprint to any type of metal out there. A classic tune to say the least. \"The Wizard\" is also a heavy one. Compared to \"Black Sabbath\", \"The Wizard\" is much more upbeat and wild. Hell, Ozzy even plays an amazing harmonica on top of the magnificent riffage of Iommi and tight rhythm section handled by Butler on bass and Ward on drums. Heavy, bluesy, catchy, perfect. The album continues in a similar vein with \"Behind the Wall of Sleep\" and the great N.I.B. after a brief bass-solo by Butler. Black Sabbath round the album off with two cover tunes \"Evil Woman\" and \"Warning\" and a somewhat mellow Sabbath tune called \"Sleeping Village\". The first cover song \"Evil Woman\" is a decent rock song, but the latter one \"Warning\" being a tasty diddy! Iommi simply slays on this song with some tremendous guitar-work. In between those is \"Sleeping Village\"; a song that isn't too memorable compared to the rest of the album, but at the same time isn't bad at all.\n\nAs far as individual performances go, they're top notch. Ozzy, while never the best singer out there, has a voice and style, as well as a stage presence, that fits Black Sabbath's music perfectly. Iommi's innovative axe-work deserves huge credit. From the eerie melodies of the title-track, the heavy and memorable riffs from \"The Wizard\" and the amazing improvisations on \"Warning\" show how great of a guitarist he is. Butler's basslines are solid and just as important to the music as Iommi's riffs. Drummer Ward is the unsung hero here, though. His jazz-trained drumming is a vital ingredient to Black Sabbath's music and raises the bar even further.\n\nThere aren't exactly any weak spots to point out on this album. \"Evil Woman\" and \"Sleeping Village\" are perhaps the weaker songs on the album. Not bad, just not as great and memorable as the others (most notably \"Black Sabbath\", \"The Wizard\" and \"N.I.B.).\n\nA bluesy hard rock album with a touch of sinister occultism is a way to describe 'Black Sabbath'. Without a shadow of doubt one of the most important albums released in rock history, but perhaps overshadowed (and understandably so) by later Sabbath albums such as 'Paranoid' and 'Master of Reality'.\n\nOn a dull, rainy day, you stare out your bedroom window at the grey, run-down church sitting in the midst of an equally-decimated cemetery, when you suddenly spot a dark shadow. As you stare at it, you notice it's staring right back at you and slowly starts to creep towards you. Then, the church-bell starts ringing, before an almighty crash of thunder knocks you down flat on the floor... If you imagine this, you get the idea of where you're heading when you hear the spooky intro to this wonderful album.\n",
        "\nThis is the true, original Black Sabbath, captured live to tape in their dead and gone 1970s glory, so what's to complain about? Couple of things, I guess, even from an Ozzy era Sab worshipper such as myself. For instance, why did they open the record with \"Tomorrow's Dream\"? Why does the first stoner metal song ever written come after a rather mediocre tune? Well, fuck it, because I can simply drop the needle straight onto \"Sweet Leaf\", light up, and head for the riff-filled land.\n\nThe inclusion of songs like \"Killing Yourself To Live\" and the crushing \"Cornucopia\" are a Sabbathian dream as those deeper cuts are rarely available in any compilation, live or otherwise. The opening lick of \"Cornucopia\" is one of the most punishing riffs in the entire Sabbath riffalogue, and it's a goddamn shame that it's so commonly overlooked. At least Type O Negative understood the meaning of it all, as they would sometimes tease their live audiences by just sticking the tip of that one in there. Ah, this piece of wax is truly a Sab nerd's delight.\n\nSide A is rounded out with the first death metal song known to mankind, I think you know it, for it will crush all of humanity from here to eternity: \"Children Of The Grave\". That's right, I make no bones about worshipping at the altar of the Lords Of This World. I digress, and alas! I was at first deceived by the track list of side B, as all the sleeve will tell you is that three songs are there, and two of them have been performed at probably every Sabbath show ever. \n\nThe reason you should buy this album is for \"Wicked World,\" for it is so much more than just that classic and jazzy little number. Yes, Tony wanks it for an extended amount of time. Whatever. The reward for the true fan is the tasty riff cornucopia (see what I did there?) of \"Into The Void\" (which, in case you didn't know, is the heaviest riff EVER, period) and \"Supernaut\", but hark, what is this that jams before me? The Sabs have got the blues, mates! I had never heard this one before, and I don't know what to call it, other than glorious! Spellbinding! Providential! Over the blues-driven genius that is Iommi-Butler-Ward, Ozzy commiserates with us about a no good woman who done him wrong. I fucking love this! And all I had to do was happily hand over $5 to my local record store for this live slice of riff cobbler, performed by none other than the inventors of the riff!\n",
        "\nBlack Sabbath past 1983 is not a topic you generally see brought up in discussions about the band and their 40+ year history. For a number of reasons (the negative critical reaction to Born Again, the bumping up of Tony Iommi solo record Seventh Star to Sabbath album and its subsequent tour falling to pieces, the constantly rotating lineup from the points Bill Ward and Geezer Butler quit in 1983 and 1984 respectively up through the first original lineup reunion, among others), for nearly 15 years the band was critically and commercially ignored save 1992's Dehumanizer, which featured fan favorite vocalist Ronnie James Dio fronting the classic Mob Rules lineup, which later went on to form Heaven and Hell in the mid-2000s. Amid the bedlam of lineup changes in the lead up to 1987's The Eternal Idol, Iommi enlisted the services of Tony Martin, who would go on to be the longest running singer in the band's history aside from Ozzy Osbourne. With Martin at the forefront, the band would release a string of criminally underrated albums, none moreso than 1989's Headless Cross, an album that combines the majesty of Ronnie Dio's albums with the evil, black magic overtures of Ozzy's albums, dumps a big fat pile of \"80s\" on it, and gives us an absolutely magnificent album in the process.\n\nWhen you think of Black Sabbath, generally what comes to minds of most are stripped down production values, Iommi's proto-doom riffing style, heavy, thumping bass lines, and Ozzy's signature crooning, right? Well throw all that out the window, because Headless Cross is, for the most part, the opposite of the classic Sabbath sound. What we've got instead is an album that strives to be as grandiose as it possibly can be, what with Martin's impassioned, powerful wailing soaring over Tony Iommi's guitar work which, while still being very clearly Tony Iommi, takes a more epic, rocking turn. The music here, as a rule, is driven primarily by the vocals, with the rest of the music serving as the backdrop for Martin's voice to sail above it. Some songs are more active than others, with special mention going to the catchy as all hell swing of \"Devil and Daughter\" and \"Black Moon Rising\". Nods to classic Sabbath exist here, such as the title track's heavy resemblance to the \"Heaven and Hell\" from the eponymous album, the chorus riff of closer \"Nightwing\" still retaining that doomy, proto-stoner feel to it from old Sabbath, and the song \"Black Moon Rising\" practically being a classic-style Sabbath song, but for the most part this is a new sound performed with the passion of a group that's trying as hard as they can to make a great record.\n\nBass here, while prominent, isn't as much a driving factor to the music as it was on the older material. This is alright for me, as the music doesn't really call for super active bass lines as it did in the older, significantly more stripped down material from the band. The slack is picked up by the heavily increased use of synthesizers and keyboards, courtesy of then-longtime unofficial member Geoff Nicholls. The keyboards help give the album the incredibly \"80s\" feel it has along with the production style, rich in reverb and echo just as you'd expect a mid-to-late 80s rock or metal album to be. It could be considered \"overproduced\" for the time, but the music found here, excellent as it is, wouldn't be nearly as grandiose sounding if it had the production style of the older Sabbath records or even the style of contemporary bands like Iron Maiden. The legendary Cozy Powell's drums pulsate through the songs, rarely taking the forefront yet still active enough to not be boring. In other words, they fit the music perfectly. \n\nLastly, there's Tony Martin. I cannot imagine a more fitting voice over top this material than his, and he delivers the performance of his life here. As mentioned previously, Martin's vocals are the main focus of the music on Headless Cross, and considering he was on equal ground creatively with Iommi for this album, it's understandable why he would make it so. Martin was also for all the lyrics on Headless Cross, which take a decidedly darker approach than even the albums on which Ozzy Osbourne was the singer. Devilish themes had always been a main topic of the band's songs, but this was the first Black Sabbath record to be almost entirely about Satan, with \"Nightwing\" being the sole exception. \"Nightwing\" may just be my favorite song lyrically on the album, reading as if the words came from an olden time story of the titular winged beast of the night. It's like metal music made specifically for listening around the Halloween season, and that isn't a bad thing in the slightest.\n\nAs time has progressed, the reputation of Headless Cross, as well as most of the other Martin-era Sabbath albums, has increased dramatically for the better. Those who may not have been aware of its existence have discovered, or rediscovered in the case of older listeners, the album and have had almost universally positive words for it. As one of those younger persons not initially aware of the Tony Martin-era Black Sabbath records, I can say with certainty that Headless Cross is my favorite album from all the eras of the band. I know plenty of people who would cry heresy at that statement, they having worshiped the vinyl Black Sabbath through Sabotage were pressed on since their early years, and for people like that you can't really say otherwise to change their mind. For others with a more open mind, or those not aware of the band's records beyond the Ozzy and Dio eras (and Born Again), or those just interested in ridiculously epic 80s heavy metal, you absolutely should listen to Headless Cross. It is a slab of heavy metal perfection that will not disappoint.\n",
        "\nLate into December of 2013 and with the release date for this fanzine looming large it became apparent that not every release I wanted to include would make the cut thanks to time constraints, and some difficult choices had to be made. Should I prioritise bands that I have interviewed? Stick to writing about the year's best releases, or include more of the chaff so I don't come across too fawning? Focus on friends' bands? Irish bands? Classic bands? Bands who are largely unknown (who sharing knowledge of has always been my greatest joy in zine writing)? One album required no decision-making though and that was 13. Even if it meant ignoring some more underground releases how could I not devote some space and time to writing about the first studio Black Sabbath album in 13 years, and the first with Ozzy in a whopping 35? Especially when, in the grand scheme of things, it is a damn decent Black Sabbath album.\n\nEverything on the early part of this record has a strong whiff of classic Sabbath about it, whether it's the total \u201cN.I.B.\u201d-referencing main riff to \u201cLoner\u201d or the quiet and introspective \u201cZeitgeist\u201d which could have easily belonged on Vol. 4. It might have taken a lot of studio trickery to get Ozzy sounding this powerful again, but as he croons out \u201cAstral engines in reverse/I'm falling through the universe again\u201d it is obvious that time has not dented Geezer Butler's lyrical prowess- or Tony Iommi's riffing for that matter.\n\nCall it being cautious, or holding the band to too high a standard by expecting them to match what they achieved 40 years ago, but on the album's lead single track \u201cGod Is Dead?\u201d I wouldn't expect anyone to fall head over heels in love with this record. But given time and repeat listens and Iommi's real power as the Riffmaster General shines through in how insidiously this songwriting will penetrate your soul. It would've been preposterous to expect a trio of men in their mid-60's to write a barnstormer like Paranoid at this stage in their lives, but creating a classic grower of an album is clearly not beyond their power. \u201cBeginning Of The End\u201d and its journey through the various guises of early Sabbath (from the very \u201cBlack Sabbath\u201d-like Doom crawl and pondering lyrical intro through the groovier Masters Of Reality-influenced mid sections and into the more anthemic Never Say Die!-esque finish) might show just how heavily referencing to their glory days this album is, but it also shows how time has not dulled their majestic creativity.\n\nSide two of this record does falter slightly thanks to opening with \u201cAge Of Reason\u201d which despite being a solid track doesn't quite get the blood pumping again, and its heartwrought climax would have made it better suited to closing the album out I think. \u201cLive Forever\u201d is the closest thing to a dud here but momentum is regained thanks to the harmonica-laden heavy Blues Rock of \u201cDamaged Soul\u201d and 13 goes out on a total high note with \u201cDear Father.\u201d Everything here from the sinister Doom-laden main riff which perfectly matches the lyrical theme of clerical child abuse and the absolute viscera with which Ozzy spits out the line \u201cYou have taken my life, now it's your turn to DIE!\u201d, tempered by the insanely catchy groove of the bridge section, caps this comeback off in glorious fashion.\n\nBecause of side one being the stronger of the two here you might expect that the longer the album goes on the more the quality dips, but the fact is I would actually recommend the extended digi-pack version of this album over the single LP version. \u201cDamaged Soul\u201d might be a bit lacklustre in comparison to the other bonus tracks, but excellent choruses of the warning against excess of \u201cMethademic\u201d and the reflection on the band's previous media ostracization with \u201cPariah\u201d are absolutely worthy additions. All in all the CD version of 13 clocks in, like the band members' ages, at nearly 70 minutes and the fact this gets more pleasurable to listen to every single time is just as staggering. Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, Ozzy Osbourne- take a bow. I am in awe. [8/10]\n\nFrom WAR ON ALL FRONTS A.D. 2013 zine- www.facebook.com/waronallfronts\n",
        "\nThis album is considered by some to be Black Sabbath's final classic (though I personally think that label belongs to Sabotage). Tony Iommi was suffering from writer's block, and the rest of the band themselves felt lost without his riffs to inspire them. But finally, one day he came out with the riff for what would become the title track on this album, and then what followed was a heap of amazing songs, which collectively produced the best Black Sabbath album to date. This, funnily enough, was also the first album to receive positive reviews from the critics as well. Although albums like Paranoid and Master of Reality stand as heavy metal classics today, they were in fact, panned upon their initial releases. This one, however, wasn't.\n\nSabbath Bloody Sabbath adds a touch of sophistication and an extra atmosphere to the band's sound, with a more prominent use of keyboards, synthesizers, strings and other various instruments added on to the traditional rock instruments the band were accustomed to, but without losing any of the heaviness in the riffs or the drums that were present on each Sabbath release, and certainly not taking away from the strengths of the band as a unit. The band's ideas have clearly been more fleshed out here than on previous albums, with all of the songs lasting 4-6 minutes long and each carrying several shifts in tempo, a change of mood, or at least some kind of surprise to keep the listener hooked. There is a lack of short instrumental or experimental tracks in the vein of \"Rat Salad\" or \"FX\" that many of the previous albums had, but the album also lacks in 7+ minute epic tracks like \"War Pigs\" or \"Wheels of Confusion\", which isn't a bad thing. The songs are kept short enough to keep most listeners interested but are also long enough to cover enough territory to make them special. Nothing about the band's style and sound is necessarily compromised, but just added onto.\n\nThe \"doom and gloom\" type-themes are still here in all their glory. The intriguing album cover alone is a good demonstration of this particular mindset. On the songs themselves, the band covers themes such as birth, death and religion, with the latter particularly being looked at through a cynical perspective, with lyrics such as \"Living just for dying, dying just for you\" and \"You think all the people who worship you are blind\" demonstrating this. The band even goes as far as to acknowledge their own bad habits in one particular song, \"Killing Yourself to Live\", which contains references to their heavy drinking and drug use. Some regard this album to be the beginning of the end of the original line-up, as relationships between members were slowly beginning to disintegrate, which would eventually affect the songwriting chemistry, more obviously reflected in \"Technical Ecstasy\" and \"Never Say Die!\". With that said, the hard feelings generated from the tensions perhaps inspired \"Killing Yourself to Live\".\n\nHowever, some of the lyrical themes are more positive, and they contrast with the dark, heavy music, most notably in \"Sabbra Cadabra\", which is Sabbath's stab at a love song, and certainly not a bad one at all, though unconventional; it creates a moody atmosphere with the help of bluesy drums and pianos despite Osbourne singing about his love for a woman. There are also quieter songs with less instrumentation, such as the acoustic instrumental \"Fluff\" and the slow, synthesizer-driven \"Who Are You\" which Osbourne supposedly played a large part in composing, but the songs blend in well with one another all the way through, and there is never a truly dull moment.\n\nOverall, Sabbath Bloody Sabbath feels less like a typical Black Sabbath album than their previous releases, because of the differences in song structure, and the general atmosphere, but, at the same time, retains many of the signature elements that made people fall in love with the band in the first place. The riffs are still just as inspiring as ever, the drumming is still just as varied and jazz-fuelled, and Ozzy Osbourne hits some of the highest notes he's sung in his career. The band's lasting influence becomes clearer with each listen. (In fact, I honestly believe that the second half of the title track may have played a big part in the emergence of death metal.) You will need to listen to it for yourself to understand the band's true importance to rock and metal as we know them. I recommend it to fans of pretty much any genre of music; it's that gripping.\n",
        "\nIt would be near impossible to overstate the influence of Black Sabbath. How many bands can claim that they not only created a genre, but perfected it almost from the get-go? Only the mighty Sabbath, and yet, with the creation of a rapidly growing genre and five classic albums already under their belt, they still weren't ready to rest on their laurels. Sabotage wasn't created by a band that had anything left to prove, but you wouldn't be able to tell just by listening to it. It's truly admirable that a band as massively acclaimed and respected as Sabbath was in the year 1975 was still really firing on all cylinders. So, in terms of the music itself, why is Sabotage such a respectable effort? \n\nWell, for starters, going through the six essential Sabbath albums in order, you really notice how their composition skills got stronger and stronger progressively, with Sabotage being the apex. With the exception of some sections of Megalomaniac, there's very little dead air on this album. It all feels very purposeful, and whenever a musical motif starts to wear thin, the song fluidly transitions into a completely new one. For example, the song Symptom of the Universe-it starts out with an ultra-heavy, chugging riff, and after a quick verse-chorus-verse, goes into what is perhaps Tony Iommi's finest guitar solo, which then transitions into an absolutely radiant reggae-tinged acoustic outro. None of it is predictable, yet at the same time none of it is forced. \n\nOn top of that, Ozzy has really found a niche with his vocal style. Ozzy isn't a great singer, and he seems to know it. So, to make up for his decidedly un-pretty voice, he focuses on what he's good at-being as imposing and intimidating as possible, to the significant benefit of songs like Hole in the Sky or Thrill of it All. He does get a little sidetracked on the overly melodic Am I Going Insane, easily the album's weakest track, but more than makes up for it on every other track. \n\nThe instrumentation, big shocker, is also great. Bill Ward's drumming is probably at its best ever, particularly with the furious fills on the track Symptom of the Universe. Tony Iommi still has yet to run out of great riffs (and with the success of 13 28 years later, one wonders if Tony Iommi actually did sell his soul for his talent). With the exception of Symptom of the Universe, he focuses less on solos here and more on double-tracked, layered riffs akin to the style of Rush's Alex Lifeson. Geezer's bass playing on Sabotageis a little slack compared to the frenetic, busy basslines he lived for on Paranoid or Vol. 4, but in terms of keeping the rhythm incredibly tight, he more than does his job. \n\nThe production here is stellar. Every instrument sounds crystal clear, and every song sounds massive and arena-ready. Producing an album like this would have been a Herculean task as well, considering how frequently the atmosphere shifts gears. To tweak the sound perfectly so that the outro to Symptom can fit like a glove on the same album as a dark, heavy track like Superztar is an incredible feat, so props to Mike Butcher (who I admittedly was not familiar with before looking up his name just now) for handling it gracefully and tactfully. \n\nUltimately, an album like Sabotage stands as a testament to how great Black Sabbath really is. It distinctly carries their stylistic mark, yet sounds quite different from anything they had put out before. And on top of that, for all I've gushed about this album, I'd still put it on the lower end of a ranked list of classic-era Sabbath albums. To a Sabbath beginner, I'd say start with the first four LP's, then get this and Sabbath Bloody Sabbath later, but that's not to say either LP is any less rewarding. Sabotage is an absolutely essential album.\n",
        "\nIt's been 35 years since the classic Black Sabbath lineup put out a proper full-length release. Alas, Ozzy, Tony, and Geezer finally returned to the studio (unfortunately, sans Bill Ward) to record what will probably the final Sabbath album the world may ever see, for better or for worse. The return of the champions of 70's heavy metal (and the creators of the metal genre itself) naturally gave way to much speculation in the metal community. 13 was what we got, and the fans' response has been mixed to say the least. So, how does the giants' return fare? \n\nFirst off, one major thing has to be kept fresh in mind-Black Sabbath didn't really have anything to prove recording 13. From 1970-1975, this was a band that recorded six of the most unarguably classic albums in heavy metal history. No other metal band in existence has amassed such an indispensable run of albums. This is a band that had more than paid its dues. The only tasks a new Black Sabbath record would have to perform are 1) Proving that the band can still play well, compose strong songs, and generally function as a unit, and 2) Washing the foul taste of  Never Say Die out of their fanbase's collective mouth. And overall, 13 manages both of these tasks admirably. \n\nThe compositions on 13 are, for the most part, rock-solid, probably because a great deal of the album (wisely) borrows from older Sabbath material. The riff on \"Loner\" has seen countless comparisons to \"N.I.B.\", and anyone who enjoys deep cuts \"Planet Caravan\" or \"Solitude\" will get a kick out of \"Zeitgeist\". The recycling, while rampant, is anchored by catchy, enjoyable enough melodies (or variations on older melodies) that most will forgive it. (On the subject of recycling/homages, there's a nice little touch at the very end of this album that bookends both the album and possibly the band's discography surprisingly poignantly.) \n\nAnother aspect that should be acknowledged is the strength of the writing. There are some strange moments lyrically (\"You don't want to be a robot ghost/occupied inside a human host\") but on the whole, Geezer's lyrics on this album are as passable as they ever were before. I'd argue that, from a songwriting standpoint, tracks like \"Dear Father\" and \"God is Dead?\" boast some of the most thought-provoking writing ever to appear on a Sabbath record. Of course, in the grand scheme of things this really isn't saying much. Listening for life-changing lyrics on a Black Sabbath album is like going to a five-star Italian restaurant and ordering a cheeseburger off the kid's menu. You're simultaneously missing the point of the experience and focusing on something you could get far better prepared with more appropriate atmosphere elsewhere. \n\nOf course, I have to address the elephant in the room-no, Bill Ward is not on this album. Yes, his absence is majorly felt. Yes, Brad Wilk frequently tries to ape Bill Ward's style of playing. But you know what? I will defend Wilk on this album. His respect for his elders, (and more importantly his superiors) is definitely felt. He does a serviceable job keeping time, and, for the most part, he backs off and lets the fantastic guitar work and Ozzy's surprisingly decent vocals speak for themselves. When he does try to be Bill Ward, it rarely works for him (with a couple of exceptions, for example the fantastic fills in the opening to \"End of the Beginning\"). The drumming on 13 isn't going to melt any faces, but it could have been far, far worse. \n\nThe MVP on this album is without a shadow of a doubt Tony Iommi. While the riffs on this album are pretty decent, they absolutely pale in comparison to the utterly fantastic solos. I've long considered Iommi to be an underrated soloist and he proves it here once again. Not only are they acrobatic and technically impressive, but many of them go on for full minutes or more, and still manage to keep engaging in spite of that length. Not only are these solos worthy of the classic era of Black Sabbath, but it sounds like his craft has steadily improved since the band's salad days. I urge any skeptics to delve into this album at least once, just for the sake of some jaw-dropping guitar work. \n\nOne final thing that desperately needs mention is Rick Rubin's production. It's...atrocious. The riffs sound muddy and overly compressed, the drums are far too heavy and occasionally get in the way of the riffs, and Geezer's bass playing, a bastion of the classic Black Sabbath sound, is buried so deep in the mix that it's hard to tell what he's playing most of the time. It's not 100% terrible, the tones on the solos sound pretty good, and the heavy, bluesy feel on \"Damaged Soul\" (which I personally consider the album highlight) benefits from the mix. But ultimately, for an album this anticipated in a genre Rubin has notably failed with in the recent past (We're looking at you, Death Magnetic) there were some far better potential candidates. \n\nAll in all, while 13 isn't going to be your new favorite Sabbath album, it definitely could have gone much worse. Hell, the music they put together is solid enough that if they had gotten Ward to play on it and fired Rubin, it could have been a substantial entry into the Black Sabbath oeuvre as well as possibly one of the best metal albums of 2013 (a year that was no slouch in the realm of damn good metal albums). While it doesn't quite reach that astronomical level of success, it definitely deserves classic Sabbath fans' attention. Give it a listen.\n",
        "\n\u201913\u2032, the eagerly awaited new album by Black Sabbath heralds the return of legendary frontman Ozzy Osbourne to the fold, after the tragic loss of former vocalist, another metal icon Ronnie James Dio to cancer in 2010. Of course, with this comes a great deluge of talk, anticipation and speculation as to how the new material will sound and compare artistically with the music that originally made them so important in the first place.\n\nThe new album essentially strives to combine the \u2018old\u2019 1970\u2032s sound that defined their earlier works with Osbourne, particularly their eponymous debut and \u2018Paranoid\u2019 through the polished lens of modern alternative rock, bringing mixed results. The addition of Brad Wilk (Audioslave, Rage Against The Machine) on drums and Rick Rubin as producer are quite reflective of this, but not overly obstructing the aesthetic direction of \u201913\u2032.\n\nAs always, the centerpiece that glues everything together here is Tony Iommi. Within a modern production framework, his guitar tone is quite crunchy and thick, his riffs the fundamental centerpiece of all compositions. Geezer Butler\u2019s bass is quite high up in the mix, always audible and separable from the rhythm guitar. Wilk\u2019s drumming is rather conformist and adherent; something that is just there because it needs to be, not flamboyant or adventurous in the same way that Bill Ward was. Osbourne\u2019s vocals have with age become restrained, so the polish of \u201913\u2032 shrouds the limitations of his singing, but are comparatively sterile when compared to days of yore.\n\nLyrics of songs are also what typified Sabbath in their early days; there is always the essence of social commentary, but it is never there to preach an idea to you. Rather, they try to illustrate the morbidity of the world, its affairs, its tragedies and events and encode them into the cryptic language of heavy metal. Song topics vary from time and being (End Of The Beginning), religion (God Is Dead?), modernity (Age Of Reason) and abuse of power (Dear Father). Thematically, this is one of the few successes of \u201913\u2032. \n\n\u2018End Of The Beginning\u2019 contains a broken down verse riff that is sparse and minimal, sounding exactly like their title track \u2018Black Sabbath\u2019, sans the foreboding tritone playing. \u2018Loner\u2019 has a similar sense of groove in the main verse riff to \u2018The Wizard\u2019. \u2018Zeitgeist\u2019 is an obvious throwback to the psychedelic piece \u2018Planet Caravan\u2019, conspicuous in the use of acoustic guitar, tabla and a use of spacial echo in Osbourne\u2019s vocals. From there on it\u2019s quite easy to establish the heavy emphasis on stockpiled, recycled, trademarked \u2018Black Sabbath riffs\u2019 that permeate all of the songs. It\u2019s an idea where the novelty essentially begins to wear itself thin in spite of the keen effort to rekindle an old flame, and the work becomes more a \u2018product\u2019 than it does an artistic work.\n\nThe purely nostalgic listener will lap this up, but those digging deeper may concur with the reviewer, and find \u201913\u2032 to be a relatively mediocre and unfulfilled venture.\n\nhttp://stenchofishtar.wordpress.com/2013/06/24/black-sabbath-13/\n",
        "\n(This review is for the 2003 DVD version of the 1978 concert).\n\nAn excellent live show, recorded prior to the release of the Never Say Die album, making this (arguably) the final recorded presentation of the original Black Sabbath line-up before they all played with Ozzy again 15 years later on his \u2018No More Tours\u2019 tour and later for the Reunion album.\n\nPresentation is quite simple, only a main menu with the now classic BS cross with the audio and track selection options, while in the background you can see some images of the concert here played and the cheering crowd.\n\n\u201cA decade of Black Sabbath\u201d are the words that mark the presentation of this concert; the song Supertzar is used as an intro for the presentation of the band, and then suddenly Ozzy screams and the notes from Symptom of the Universe start to explode.\n\nFrom the very beginning is really easy to see how Ozzy\u2019s voice has gone from bad to worse and is easier to understand why he had already been kicked out of the band a few months later and why he was kicked out again for good a few months later. It\u2019s a shame, especially if you think of everything Ozzy did after BS and the fact that they are on the road again, 35 years later and Ozzy\u2019s vocals sound better now than it does here. Not exactly the way you would like to celebrate a decade, right? But his vocalization is not always that bad, though; just at some points, particularly on the older songs, because if you pay close attention to how he does it on the songs from the later albums - Sabotage, Technical Ecstasy and Never Say Die \u2013 you will hardly notice some decay.\n\nBut there is something to highlight from Ozzy, not only then but always: his energy, his charisma and his devotion to the crow. No matter how drunk or high (apparently) he was, he kept moving all the time across the stage, jumping, clapping, cheering, inviting people to really live the concert. A BS trade mark.\n\nDespite Ozzy\u2019s faults, the band remains as an excellent live show, since every musician here gives his best to achieve the ultimate BS premise: \u201cgo extra fucking crazy!\u201d Iommi is as creative as always, changing one note here, adding a riff there, perfectly synchronised with Butler\u2019s virtuosity, who rams his four string with the same rage and outstanding technique he did it ten years before and has done it 30 years later. And then we have Ward, who looked always so cool and entertained that he seemed more playing in a garage with friends that in a big venue for a large audience. These three elements combine in such a unique and marvellous way that the music is always perfect and they put Ozzy\u2019s weak points in a second plane, proving that their music \u2013 specially when it comes to live performances \u2013 is a major force that can overcome any difficulty. If it weren\u2019t for Ozzy\u2019s issues, it would have been a 100% for sure.\n\nHere we have ten tracks, plus an intro, a short but great drum solo and also a good guitar solo, with no really classics missing besides Iron Man. In fact, the track list from then to now has barely changed. What was considering defining for the first BS decade will always be, apparently. As always, the band first seems to be gone \u2013 even after the credits for the recording has been displayed \u2013 but of course, they return to deliver their ultimate live hymn: Paranoid.\n\nThe scenery, lights and cameras management are really good, proving that this 10th anniversary show was carefully planned; there\u2019s even a cool effect where the band plays on the background while every musician comes in front in an inset, which is highly creative and innovative for that time; there\u2019s even overlapping images, a revolutionary concept then. Video quality is acceptable and is remarkable that this DVD comes with the 5.1 audio option, and considering this was recorded years before heavy metal concerts became a massive business, the overall product is outstanding. \n\nJust like Ozzy\u2019s voice, this DVD could also have been a little bit better; it would have been great if it had come with something extra: some video clip, an interview, biography/discography, wallpapers, a photo show, anything. Aside from improved sound - and a menu - this version offers nothing more than the original VHS release.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the best BS period, that\u2019s for sure, but the performances from everyone here, the technical issues and the fact that this was a very special and unique presentation make this an instant classic.\n",
        "\nThis album is Black Sabbath's eleventh, and it marks the beginning of the \"lost era\" of the band. After eight albums with Ozzy and two with Dio, Black Sabbath would carry on with multiple vocalists, bassists and drummers (Tony Iommi was the only constant member during this time, unless keyboardist Geoff Nichols is also counted) but would not achieve the same level of commercial and critical success they previously enjoyed. Most of the albums produced during this time did not age well with the critics either, like the first four Ozzy albums did. However, Born Again is something of an exception. The album features Tony, bassist Geezer and drummer Bill Ward, with then-former Deep Purple singer Ian Gillan rounding out the four piece. When the album came out in 1983, critics hated it: the album cover, the songs themselves, and the production. Whilst today, the cover and the production are both still criticised, the songs themselves are generally positively received, and it's no big surprise as to why: Born Again is a good album, hands down.\n\nWhilst the production does sound rather muddy, it doesn't do much to take away from the strength of the songs. You can expect great simple hard rock tunes: \"Trashed\" a song about drink driving which made it onto Tipper Gore's \"Filthy Fifteen\" song list for its lyrical content, \"Digital Bitch\", about a rich woman whose father \"made a fortune from computers\"...and is supposedly also a bitch, and also \"Hot Line\", which admittedly I'm not quite as fond of.\n\nYou can also expect short eerie instrumentals, \"Stonehenge\" and \"The Dark\" are intros to the epics \"Disturbing the Priest\" and \"Zero the Hero\", which are two of my favourite songs on the album. \"Priest\" sounds haunting and satanic with eerie sounds throughout, just as a song with such a title should sound. \"Zero\" sounds totally menacing, not just the music, but also Gillan's lyrical delivery. The chorus also demands you to chant along with him as he sings \"Zeeeero the heeeroooooo!\"\n\nThere is also something of a love ballad here in the slow-moving \"Keep it Warm\". The chorus is very much in the vein of blues/hard rock, whilst the verses are unmistakably metallic, and the riffs are unmistakably Tony Iommi's. It's a solid metal ballad. What else is there to say?\n\nBy all counts, Born Again is a great heavy metal album. It's also a great Black Sabbath album and quite deserving of the name. Many of the albums they made past this point were also good albums that have been sadly overlooked. If you wish to get into the more obscure Sabbath stuff, this would be a good starting point. All three instrumental members are still there, and they are fronted by Deep Purple's singer. It isn't a bad idea on paper, and it certainly still isn't a bad idea when executed.\n",
        "\nThe first four Black Sabbath albums are considered by most metalheads to be some of the best records ever recorded. Few groups have ever had a run of quality releases that are even arguably comparable\u2014Metallica\u2019s first four and Death\u2019s last four; Judas Priest and Iron Maiden have both had such runs. Within metal fandom, either Paranoid or Master of Reality is the most beloved of Sabbath's, but for many critics (myself included) Black Sabbath Vol. 4 is the pinnacle of the original metal band\u2019s career. The 40th anniversary of its release is tomorrow, Sepember 1 [2012].\n\nIommi\u2019s riffs are the main reason for its excellence. The riff from the fantastic \u201cSupernaut\u201d is widely considered his best. Contrasting with the slow-rolling doom riffs he\u2019s better known for, \u201cSupernaut\u201d is exciting, and that is perhaps the reason the song looms so large in their discography. But he still writes some of his best doom as well: opener \u201cWheels of Confusion\u201d is typically excellent, \u201cCornucopia\u201d has an intensely heavy opener, while \u201cUnder the Sun\u201d is the heaviest Sabbath song of all. \u201cSnowblind,\u201d as well, is one of the most iconic (and heaviest) songs of the band\u2019s career.\n\nThe rest of the band is also as brilliant as ever. The aforementioned heaviness is due in large part to Geezer Butler\u2019s bass. Drummer Bill Ward has never been in finer form, and the drum solo on \u201cSupernaut\u201d is absolutely entertaining and fits the song perfectly. Finally, Ozzy is at his best (pre-solo career). His default mode of suffering/fear/paranoia has never been on better display than on \u201cSnowblind.\u201d Piano/synth ballad \u201cChanges\u201d may be maligned by most metalheads and many others, but it reveals a side of Ozzy that had never before been seen. His energy elevates \u201cSupernaut\u201d from \u201cgreat\u201d to \u201cclassic\u201d and makes \u201cTomorrow\u2019s Dream\u201d the underrated burner that it is.\n\nSo why is Vol. 4 held in lower regard among metalheads? Paranoid and Master of Reality are flawless records. They each have one curveball, but it\u2019s an acceptable curveball that doesn\u2019t do much to distract from the overall experience. Vol. 4, on the other hand, has weird experimental track \u201cFX,\u201d relatively long acoustic instrumental \u201cLaguna Sunrise,\u201d and the aforementioned \u201cChanges.\u201d As I\u2019ve maintained before, \u201cit's those imperfect, quirky albums that seem to be remembered a decade later. They grow on you.\u201d Vol. 4 is one of those imperfect, quirky albums. It reveals a band with a command of what they\u2019ve already proven they can do while confidently exploring new terrain, for good or ill.\n\nWhen reviewing a new album, we critics (pro and amateur alike) tend to focus in on an album\u2019s imperfections and penalize it for them. It\u2019s only in retrospect that we can appreciate them for what they add to the experience. Black Sabbath Vol. 4 is the band\u2019s greatest record in part because of its phenomenal successes, but also because of its sometimes-failed experiments.\n\noriginally written for http://fullmetalattorney.blogspot.com/\n",
        "\nOriginally intended to be Tony Iommi\u2019s solo debut, there is no denying that Seventh Star has the oddest status in the Black Sabbath discography. It doesn\u2019t get torn apart like Forbidden or divides opinion quite like Born Again, but rather seems to have gotten lost in the shuffle with its successor The Eternal Idol. Context aside, this album is still responsible for many of the tropes that the band would come to adopt through the late 80s and early 90s.\n\nIn addition to being the first Sabbath album to feature Iommi as its sole original member, Seventh Star saw them fully embracing styles that had merely been hinted at before. Songs like \u201cIn For The Kill\u201d and \u201cTurn To Stone\u201d show a proto-power metal sound that Dio never could\u2019ve predicted while \u201cHeart Like A Wheel\u201d is the band\u2019s first glimpse at the blues since their earliest days. There is also inevitable influence from the time period in its prominent keyboards, reverb heavy production, and all-out power balladry on \u201cNo Stranger To Love\u201d and \u201cIn Memory.\u201d\n\nThe lineup may result in a faceless rhythm section but the overall performances are worth noting. Iommi himself is as smooth as always though his leads are more focused than his riffs as the always-underrated Geoff Nicholls dominates \u201cThe Sphinx\u201d and brings some nice Hammond touches to \u201cAngry Heart.\u201d On the other hand, vocal legend Glenn Hughes contribution is sure to divide listeners as he provides his amazing range and soul but lacks the atmosphere that truly makes a standout Sabbath singer. At least Joe Lynn Turner was busy at the time\u2026\n\nAnd with that to consider, it is hard to recommend this to traditional Sabbath fans. It doesn\u2019t quite match the riff-driven Ozzy era, the majesty of the Dio era, or even the B-movie darkness of their other 80s ventures. The new sounds are also a point of concern as they provide a source of transition but ultimately make the album a true product of its time.\n\nBlack Sabbath\u2019s twelfth studio album may essentially be the best album that Rainbow never made, but it may have more in common with their other efforts from the decade than one would initially think. It is worth wondering how things would\u2019ve been if this had been released properly, but thankfully the band evolved well from here and Tony for a few more chances at a solo career in later years. I\u2019d go for Fused to hear an astounding Iommi/Hughes collaboration or Headless Cross for the best of late 80s Sabbath but this is still worth looking into if you get the chance.\n\nCurrent Highlights:\n\u201cIn For The Kill\u201d\n\u201cNo Stranger To Love\u201d\n\u201cHeart Like A Wheel\u201d\n\u201cAngry Heart\u201d\n\nOriginally published at http://psychicshorts.blogspot.com\n",
        "\nThe influence the Sabbies have had in metal and rock music for more than forty years now is as evident just as it is undeniable. Furthermore, according to Mr. Type O Negative, Peter Steele himself \u2013 and I\u2019m quoting here -, \u201cBlack Sabbath are responsible for all metal, hardcore and gothic music out there\u201d, and that\u2019s saying a lot. I totally agree, by the by. Being so, it\u2019s interesting if not baffling how their fans are into 4 or 5 of their releases only, and that\u2019s just in case they don\u2019t belong to the group of fuckos who only play \u201cParanoid\u201d every now and then to remind their hipster buddies \u201cDude, that was the first heavy metal song. Sabbath rules\u2026\u201d Anyway. Take \u201cBorn again\u201d for instance (recorded the very year I was born, by the way), which on the paper appears as one of those HUGE moments in the history of metal and rock. I mean not daily a band has the chance to combine the talents of Ian Gillan, on of the most gifted 70s hard-rock singers, Mr. Tommy \u201cRiff\u201d Iommi and Mr. Geezer Butler themselves godfathers of extreme music around the world. Why the idiotic media at the time disregarded and even mocked this jewel giving it names such as Deep Black or Purple Sabbath is far beyond my comprehension.\n\nEven though both Sabbath and Purple sort of fit into the same musical genre, the approach each act had to it was almost opposite. While Sabbath were totally into minimalistic sometimes sharp, sometimes crushing, but always groovy riffs plus eerie vocals, Purple guys would rather go for virtuosity, stoned atmospheres, long trippy songs and heavy but exquisite vocals. Combining both styles resulted in an almost experimental form of 70s heavy rock\u2026 recorded in the early 80s. If I were to describe \u201cBorn again\u201d\u2018s sound by attempting to define a sub-genre it fits, I would say it\u2019s heavy doomy stoner rock or something, all finely flavored by Mr. Gillan\u2019s amazing work, which gives to the record a unique and elegant touch of real old school. Now, the tag experimental has been used pretentiously by progressive and technical bands, but in this case I think it\u2019s got more to do with the intentional overuse of simpleton lilting riffs, always sticking to mesmerizing ostinato patterns. Also, Tony Iommi stuck to his tightest chops this time, and made each section endure long periods, so that the songs sound like hellish hypnotic engines.\n\nNot that the production excels, but taking the decade it was recorded and released into account, as well as considering the type of music this is, it\u2019s quite decent. Everything\u2019s clearly audible, there\u2019s little else to say.\n\nOnce I read in a quite famous metal magazine I shan\u2019t mention here that \u201cSabbath\u2019s style was unique despite the lack of proficiency of Iommi\u2026\u201d Bullshit. Tommi\u2019s performance is sloppy, that\u2019s fo\u2019sure, yet that\u2019s part of his style, which has nothing to do with today\u2019s obsession with perfection \u2013 pointless precision and velocity in most cases if you ask me \u2013 plus, I\u2019d love to see any contemporary technical guitar player doing any better, especially with their fingertips gone. When it comes to \u201cBorn again\u201d, good ol\u2019Tommi brilliantly managed to integrate his peculiar style to something that appropriately fit the whole fusion concept of the album. The guitar solos are not that memorable though. We all know soloing has never been his area of expertise. Fuck it, that magazine was Hell Awaits.\n\nIan Gillan used to be one of the greatest heavy singers ever, no matter my colleagues disagree. This record is another proof of that. He sings consistently and dynamically according to each song, and he\u2019s more than capable of theatricalizing quite convincingly like in \u201cDisturbing the priest\u201d, a song in which he also shows off his falsetto skills. Also, Gillan is responsible for one of the catchiest Sabbath choruses ever: the one sung in \u201cZero the hero\u201d. The whole song is a jewel, goddammit! No wonder why even Barnes couldn\u2019t resist covering it. In the end, it\u2019s such a pity Ian just collaborated on this Sabbath record\u2026 Are you aware of WhoCares?\n\nThe same he\u2019s always done, Geezer knows his role. He knows it, but we\u2019re lucky enough he ignores it all the fucken time, meaning yes he can and does accompany songs providing a solid ground, however he can and does face up to Iommi\u2019s chops with his own. Butler isn\u2019t into showing off either, so you could call his lines somewhat discreet if you like though. That constant battle between guitar and bass is one of the features making Sabbath sound so special. This work\u2019s not an exception.\n\nI ain\u2019t a fan of Bill Ward. Never was. Since he hasn\u2019t been included in latest Sabbath reunion, everybody claims he\u2019s da drummer. In my opinion his work here is appropriate, and that\u2019s all there is to it. Yes, he does OK, and yes, any other drummer could have done equally good or even better. Who\u2019s the best friend of a musician? His drummer!\n\nLyrics are average the Sabbath way. They\u2019re fun and catchy, although not that profound or anything. Good and irreverent enough: \u201cGood life is contradiction because of the crucifixion\u2026\u201d\n\nNot having ever had the chance to hold a physical copy of this in my paws, I\u2019m only to judge it\u2019s frontal cover. The legend speaks of Ian Gillan throwing up when he first saw the raw and bizarre graphic treatment they gave to the picture of this cute little baby. Obviously, he wasn\u2019t used to the ways of such an obscure and even evil imagery in a band. Of course, Gillan wasn\u2019t the only conservative cunt who felt frankly offended by it. Then again, when it comes to the godfathers of metal, the more controversial, the better.\nLogo\n\nSabbath switch logos in almost every release. Sometimes they\u2019re cool and sometimes they\u2019re shitty. This one happened to be shitty.\n\nMake no mistake, \u201cBorn again\u201d is the most underrated release by the Sabbies. It truly was a re-birth of the most influential heavy sound ever, and it stands alone as their most experimental work; at the same time it\u2019s a display of pure and traditional hard-rock meeting doom and heavy metal. As it often happens with great works, it\u2019s a little too short though.\n\nOriginally written for www.globaldomination.se\n",
        "\nGod Is Dead? Was the first and only single released from Black Sabbath\u2019s 13. This is in no way a traditional three minute single off of your typical album. It is a slow developing, doomy 9 minute slab of Black Sabbath. Once again the Ozzy fronted version of the band shows their creativity and their lack of concern for the mainstream. They do whatever the hell they want to on their own terms. God is Dead is a musical piece, not just a song.\n\nIt is not secret that Iommi is a riff master. The song itself starts out slow with that doom and gloom riff that Black Sabbath coined in the early 70\u2019s. Iommi\u2019s riffing conjures up an atmosphere of impending doom throughout the song and he proves once again to be at the top of his game even when facing death. The song moves at a snail\u2019s pace as it ebbs and flows from the softer gloomy riff and the ultra-heavy doom riff. The song really picks up around the 6:00 mark as it rises up from the doom and gloom with a Hole in the Sky flavored fast riff. Almost immediately after we are punished by a more up-tempo riff makes you want to head bang because of the sheer heaviness. We also get an uncharacteristically short solo that acts as icing on the cake to a wonderful performance from Iommi. The solo is short but it really works well with the song. Just because it is a 9 minute song doesn\u2019t mean that there has to be a wealth of careless noodling on the guitar. The solo just fits and enhances the song without losing much focus. Of course Black Sabbath is known for the riffs and I hope I have made that apparent that God is Dead? has a wide variety of classic Iommi. \n\nMuch like the entire 13 album, this song is heavy, doomy and certainly thought provoking. The song seems blasphemous at first listen because God being dead is quite the sensitive subject. It is controversial to have a song like this on an album let alone a single release. The informed and intelligent are able to see the connection with Friedrich Nietzsche and his famous phrase. It really doesn\u2019t deal with the literal death of god but it deals with god on a philosophical level. Nietzsche claimed that god was dead in our hearts and all the bad things going on in this world make that evident. That is what this song is about to put it in the most basic way. Geezer takes us inside a religion fellows mind as he tries to justify god\u2019s existence.\n\nIf you listen to the lyrics which are easy to follow along with, you can hear Ozzy say \u201cI don\u2019t believe that God is dead\u201d. In my mind the religious individual is not really sure of himself anymore and he could be losing touch with God along with the entire world. I think Nietzsche would be proud. The song delves deep into an age old issue with a twist that proves that Geezer Butler is still capable of writing thought provoking lyric sand that a band from the 70\u2019s can still have their classic sound while still sounding relevant. \n\nThere is absolutely nothing that I can find that is faulty with this single. It shatters the mold of a typical single. It has fantastic Nietzsche Purple Spaghetti artwork which is utterly ridiculous in an awesome way. It is a slow, doomy track that the original Black Sabbath is known for with fantastic thought provoking lyrics. Geezer and Tony really shine on this with an incredibly loud bass style and a short but effective guitar solo respectively. In my eyes this song is a great musical piece that fits well in the Black Sabbath discography. I would have enjoyed a traditional single release instead of just digital download on Amazon and Itunes. I would love to have that artwork to look at but the only way you can get it is by getting the super deluxe package only available on BlackSabbath.com. Aside from that small blunder, I cannot find much fault with this fantastic song!\n",
        "\nWorry not; I won't rehash how important the SABBATHians are to us who like our music loud, ungainly, and distorted. They've earned their stripes, by golly, and they know it. Whether it's the first four albums people praise to death, the post-Ozzy years that some people revere versus others, or the tumultuous period of changes in line-up, musical direction and lyrical focus (bestowing upon this reviewer one of the best albums he's ever heard...try and guess which one!), the original fearsome foursome has solidified themselves within the marbled walls of history. And that they're still willing to perform live and release new music after all this time is pretty fantastic as it is. Nothing's stopping them now...not egos, not money, not cancer. BLACK SABBATH could very well outlive us all.\n\nRight? Well, let's see...\n\nAs weird as this might sound, hearing a SABBATH recording with modern, digital production seems rather out of place given their personal musical direction. But that\u2019s really just a minor argument, if one at all. Let\u2019s just get into the nitty-gritty of \u201c13\u201d. To call the material \u201cfamiliar\u201d is doing is just enough justice, as I can\u2019t say SABBATH has really shot for unfamiliar territory all through the years. Sure, there were a few deviations here and there, but the main bulk of their output was just straight-up heavy metal with slow, doomy undertones, and that\u2019s just what you get here. Yet I\u2019ll admit that there\u2019s a bit more spring to the band\u2019s step with regards to the songwriting and performance level. I guess listeners would be surprised to hear just how loud this group of old timers can still be, and just how timely their material would come off as despite how weathered and worn it could have been after 35+ years of frightening the masses. I\u2019ve really not heard these guys sound as powerful as they do with this outing in a long time now, and it\u2019s a bit hard to tell if it\u2019s due to the massiveness of the music itself or the production value which has the guitars and some of the vocals WAY TOO UPFRONT (due to Rick Rubin\u2019s ear-bleed production/mixing approach\u2026but then again, that may be the point?). That works out fine for the riffs, which are as thick and potent as before, but not so much with poor Ozzy\u2019s increasingly derelict vocal scheme, which at best sounds competent and at worst sounds tired and more aged than they would let on. I mean, there were moments where I wasn\u2019t sure if Ozzy knew where he was while warbling his lines! Still, I\u2019ll give the group props in being a tight, rather energetic quartet that deliver the goods when it comes down to it (the drum position controversy be damned), something you can\u2019t take away from them. That being said, though, competence and tightness cannot undo a dated musical approach. Iommi and Co. are riff-smiths like no other, but the output is still mired in the musical tandems of old with really no inklings of evolution or differing ideas thrown in, so it seems. The album is littered with all that makes SABBATH who they are and what they do best, but\u2026that\u2019s all you get. Really. And this leads \u201c13\u201d into becoming a two way street; some folks out there would take the album for what it is, a nice foray into old world metal that some would conclude gets better with age, but others might question the relevance of this during an era of countless sub-genres and metallic crossbreeding. I mean, back in the 70s SABBATH had no equal. Their genre-based peers relied more on a rockin\u2019 atmosphere and folk stylings versus being a bludgeoning mass of wickedness. But these days, despite putting out a better product than one would let on, SABBATH remain on a plateau all their own. They aren\u2019t able to canoodle with the likes of WHITECHAPEL or IMMORTAL or PANDAEMONIUM or whoever. They wouldn\u2019t fit. And besides, where do the SABBATH dudes sit with the kids these days? Do they matter? Do they even KNOW WHO THEY ARE?? That\u2019s not up to me, sadly. \n\nAt the end of the day, BLACK SABBATH prove that they can still somehow survive on/by their own musical merits, and I did enjoy this for what it was, really, but I think I could\u2019ve used more. Some newer ideas spewing down the pipeline. But as it stands, I would still recommend this for one and all, particularly those who partake in \u201cVolume 4\u201d on a daily basis.\n",
        "\nBlack Sabbath\u2019s return wasn\u2019t much of a deal for me. First of all, without Bill Ward they\u2019re not really Sabbath, however with Iommi and Geezer still there I hoped they would bring back some of the old stuff. They clearly did not.\n\nThe first track released was God is Dead? and it clearly wasn\u2019t a great choice. Having said that, the better tracks on the album are only marginally better. When you hear a Black Sabbath song after years, you, would expect to get goosebumps like the very first time you listened to the intro of Iron Man. This wasn\u2019t even remotely close. Iommi was always known for the \u201cepicness\u201d in his riffs, and the first song released from a new album after several years did not have any epicness in it, neither in the riffs nor the leads. Sign of things to come? Definitely. After listening to whole album, with a predetermined mindset of wanting to like it, I was disappointed. Like I said, the epicness was amiss. There were no riffs I could take back, no orgasmic solos that would give goosebumps. The latter half of the album is a tad better than the former. The production too, not a favorite. Though the bass stands out like Pakistani in Ecuador, it does not quite how I would like Geezer to sound. I would much rather have him sound like the way he did in the intro N.I.B, modernization of this lord of low frequency\u2019s tone borders on the blasphemous. Ozzy sounds much better than expected, albeit I was never a fan of his, admittedly so.\n\nAn utter let down, for such a legendary band. Especially after a bundle of years. Quote unquote, Rick Rubin has shat all over this one. Well, thankfully there are only 8 songs to endure. I shall look for memorable riffs and orgasmic solos in other doom bands. A Sabbath album is still a Sabbath album, credit to them for making one, if not for much else. It\u2019s not a Sabbath album we deserve, but it\u2019s the one we need right now.\n",
        "\nBlack Sabbath is one of the godfathers of heavy music. Their influence is just unparalleled. I could probably type anything here and you would go with it because you\u2019re not really reading this part. It\u2019s just the same boring crap you read in every review of a legendary band. I could talk about dancing elephants and mental asylum inmates who throw their own feces at the wall, and you\u2019d probably just ignore all of it because it\u2019s generic fodder for an opening paragraph. Don\u2019t people ever get tired of writing those? I sure get tired of reading them. Nobody cares if you\u2019re 16 and just discovered Sabbath three months ago and are now an expert on them. In fact nobody really cares about the umpteenth review for a hyped-up new album by a classic band, because they all say the same old shit over and over. Stop it!\n\nWith that said\u2026\n\nThis really is a pretty lame album. I loved 2009\u2019s The Devil You Know but this one, lazily titled 13, is like an easy-listening version of Sabbath. I mean I guess it\u2019s pleasant to listen to. It doesn\u2019t bother me to have it on, and the band doesn\u2019t derivate from the sound that made them famous. It\u2019s a very \u2018nice\u2019 album. But is that really what Sabbath was about? I guess if you listen to \u201cWar Pigs\u201d on the radio enough times, and watched the movie Iron Man and heard the titular Sabbath song in the end credits, you might think this is an amazing album. But if you like the eclectic, eccentric prog-isms and the adventurous nature, this will just bore the hell out of you.\n\nIt\u2019s Sabbath played as Rick Rubin, Sharon Osborne and the mainstream record companies always saw them as, through vision clouded by dollar signs and gold coins. You get sludgy riffing, rocking tempos and doomy lyrics, plus Iommi\u2019s signature bluesy solos and Ozzy\u2019s signature nasal holler, but it\u2019s all just so pass\u00e9 at this point because the songwriting does nothing but ape their old classics. On The Devil You Know we got exciting, propulsive tunes that actually added to the discography; here we just get re-enactments of old tunes with new lyrics set to them. None of these songs suck, but none of them will blow you away either.\n\nThe whole idea behind this was to go back to the days before metal, to record something that sounds like it would have come right after Black Sabbath. Which they did\u2026to a fault. The whole idea of Sabbath in the first place was to innovate and progress beyond musical boundaries, to play around and do things nobody had heard before, which \u2018normal\u2019 people would find repulsive and ugly. They were as much a rebellious band as any punk outfit with hippie lyrics criticizing war and praising drugs and everything. So the concept of 13 being a \u2018back to the roots\u2019 album is ironically exactly anathema to what the band was about. It is the exact opposite to what Sabbath meant in the old days \u2013 it is the vacuum in which innovation is sucked up to die. For that I should rate it lower but honestly like I said, none of these songs are truly bad. They\u2019re just mediocre.\n\nThey go through every clich\u00e9 you would expect from Sabbath \u2013 every song uses some basic template of a famous song from their debut, whether it be the first two songs sounding like bloated versions of the titular \u201cBlack Sabbath\u201d track or \u201cLoser\u201d being a dead ringer for \u201cN.I.B.\u201d \u201cZeigeist\u201d is pretty much \u201cPlanet Caravan,\u201d and the other songs are mish-mashed from a bunch of different old Sabbath tropes. Some of them have pretty catchy hooks and Ozzy can muster up some attitude. Iommi\u2019s guitar playing is still rock solid. But the whole thing is just so safe and boring. None of these songs will be remembered like \u201cBlack Sabbath,\u201d \u201cSabbath Bloody Sabbath,\u201d \u201cChildren of the Grave,\u201d \u201cInto the Void,\u201d \u201cMegalomania,\u201d the list goes on. It\u2019s a decent tribute album but as a Sabbath album it is sad.\n\nSabbath on here sounds very pleasant. Pleasant \u2013 in regards to an album by the original evil, heretical band of musical misfits, who broke down so many walls. What a day, to say so.\n\nIt would be an amazing Reverend Bizarre album though, by comparison.\n",
        "\nThere\u2019s a lot invested in the first album under the Black Sabbath banner since 1995\u2019s Forbidden. Tony Iommi and Geezer Butler are still together after the ill-fated Heaven And Hell and Ozzy Osbourne is back in the ranks, but the inclusion of Brad Wilk in place of Bill Ward keeps this from being a complete reunion of the original lineup. Factor in a Rick Rubin production job and a couple health scares and you\u2019ve got a great album with all the ingredients to make it even better.\n\nEven if you don\u2019t factor in Rubin\u2019s insistence on a back to the roots approach, 13 sounds exactly like you thought it would. Their first three albums are the most obvious reference points but the structures and tone aren\u2019t too far off from Iommi\u2019s most recent works and there are traces of Born Again in his soloing style. The band dynamic is also identical to what one would expect as Iommi\u2019s signature riffs drive the songs, Geezer provides a powerful bass presence, Wilk is competent though lacking Ward\u2019s jazzy flare, and Ozzy\u2019s vocals are edited to sound about as good as they can at this point\u2026\n\nThe lyrics are also pretty solid though there isn\u2019t anything quite as apocalyptic as \u201cElectric Funeral\u201d or the band\u2019s self-titled anthem. The tone is a somber yet contemplative one as songs like \u201cGod Is Dead?\u201d and \u201cDear Father\u201d sit in on religious debates while \u201cLive Forever\u201d and the bluesy \u201cDamaged Soul\u201d discuss the inevitability of death. While the topics are nothing new, they sound a bit more real when delivered by a group of men in their sixties and fit the songs incredibly well.\n\nBut while a downtrodden doom album was just what we wanted from Sabbath, there are moments where this album feels like it may actually be too slow. While the exceptions of the \u201cPlanet Caravan\u201d sequel \u201cZeitgeist\u201d and the upbeat \u201cLive Forever,\u201d all the songs are slow plodders with occasional signs of life in the form of a speedy bridge. There\u2019s not a badly written track on here but the overall album feels like it needed to be more dynamic. Just listen to the album with \u201cMethademic\u201d and \u201cNaivete in Black\u201d in place of \u201cEnd Of The Beginning\u201d and \u201cAge of Reason\u201d and you\u2019ll see just how excellent this album could\u2019ve sounded.\n\nIf the tolling bell at the end of \u201cDear Father\u201d means that this will be the last Sabbath album, then I will take this as a rocky but ultimately strong swan song from a group of seasoned veterans. But I will also take this album as a sign of greater potential if this turns out to not be the case. Either way, 13 is a great entry into the Sabbath canon that is even better if you get ahold of the deluxe edition. Of course, nothing can fill the void that was created by the nonexistent follow-up to The Devil You Know\u2026\n\nCurrent Highlights:\n\u201cGod Is Dead?\u201d\n\u201cLive Forever\u201d\n\u201cDamaged Soul\u201d\n\u201cDear Father\u201d\n\nOriginally published at http://psychicshorts.blogspot.com\n",
        "\nThis review is one of the pinnacles of writing career. This is the very band that brought me here today to write for you lovely folks, and I\u2019ll be honest I didn\u2019t expect very much all at all. To see a band you worship offer up something that might otherwise be subpar is always frightening. We never want to see our idols fall from the often self-serving personal graces we afford them. \n\nFolks, I can\u2019t accurately tell you how happy I am to have been wrong in assuming that this 13 record might not be worth hearing. \n\nTo do a review of this nature is always a tough undertaking; putting aside personal hopes and histories is always a challenge. That said, Black Sabbath does what is expected of them: they issued a CD that is both historically relevant and a modern piece of heavy metal intensity so good it should shut up all the detractors, of which I was, stupidly, one. The first track \u201cEnd of the Beginning\u201d has such an insane Sabbath bloody Sabbath-meets-Black Sabbath tone to it, it\u2019s just sickening. At the end I loved hearing a \u201cLooking for Today\u201d sound written all over it. Without completely copping the original sound so as to mask a lack of ideas, Tony Iommi simply pulls some musical artifacts from that brilliant mental arsenal he harbors and applies them in generous but sparing amounts. Of course we probably all heard the powerful \u201cGod is Dead\u201d track released beforehand, and it was a pleasant surprise indeed, but \u201cLoner\u201d seems to call upon the Heaven and Hell era in terms of overall tone. I love that this record calls upon the sounds that made Black Sabbath famous without relying solely on past glories to guide them through this release. These gentlemen know full well by now what to do and how to do it. \n\nNow, as for Ozzy Osbourne\u2019s vocal duties, I\u2019m sure there\u2019s quite a fine amount of studio magic helping him through the recording, and that\u2019s expected at 64-years old, but his dark, slow, even brooding vocal fits the exact sound Rick Rubin was going for as producer. Rubin stated he was going to draw out the Sabbath of old and damned if he didn\u2019t do just that. Geezer Butler sounds as heavy and thunderous as he has, oh, every step of his illustrious career with no stultification in sight. That booming underside that has influenced nearly every metal band over the last five decades never gets old, and as a bassist myself I\u2019m thankful for that. \n\nAnother point of wild contention was the lack of Bill Ward on the drums in favor of Rage Against the Machine\u2019s Brad Wilk. Wilk does a fine job and doesn\u2019t miss a single step when driving these masters forward with some seriously destructive skin bashing. His nice ride in \u201cLive Forever\u201d is as competent as anything on past albums. Yes, it\u2019s difficult to get past the fact that this lineup is, factually, incomplete in terms of \u201creunion\u201d, but putting aside egregious wants and allowing change to be a positive rather than a negative will help us all enjoy the album much more along the way. I think a lot of people figured Sabbath would sound like Audioslave or RATM by taking in Wilk, and that\u2019s both ridiculous and presumptuous. He added a great sound to the mix and should be complimented.\n\nThe track \u201cDamaged Soul\u201d clocks in at just under eight-minutes, and it\u2019s a fantastic mixture of modern-day doom and ancient ideas brought to a new, hopefully appreciative audience of younger fans ready to enjoy the actual music herein and not just the Hot Topic shirts that gives them mall-cred. Mr. Butler\u2019s finger-thumping beneath the surface is just what the metal fan ordered, and he will no doubt send a legion of people to their bass amps and four-string axes to learn the pregnant, overpowering and often frustratingly-skilled lines herein. Mr. Osbourne\u2019s vocal here is the familiar longing sound we\u2019ve come to miss in recent years that just seems to ease out of the speakers with all of the trepidation of molten lava cascading down a volcanic hillside towards an unsuspecting village. No, he\u2019s not the same demon that screamed out \u201cThe Writ\u201d or \u201cLooking for Today\u201d, but this is definitely an Ozzy of older and still potent design. \n\nThe guitar solo in \u201cAge of Reason\u201d is so magnetic and fluid with Mr. Butler\u2019s rapid plundering complimenting the effort; musically these guys are as potent in their 60\u2019s as they ever were in their hungry, lean 20\u2019s. The \u201cPlanet Caravan-esque\u201d beauty of \u201cZeitgeist\u201d is also the perfect \u2018lull\u2019 in an otherwise dark and heavy collective, for a Sabbath record without such an insightful, thought-provoking track is simply unacceptable. I\u2019ll further admit that hearing Ozzy sing about a life in ruins through \u201cDear Father\u201d brings a happy sort of dark joy to this old heart of mine. The little surprise ending of the domestic album (sans bonus tracks) is a smile-inducer for sure. \n\nIn terms of historical reference, Black Sabbath stands alone in influence, style and importance; with 13 the gauntlet is not only once more thrown down for all to see, it sits in defiant full view for the masses, young and old, to understand just what magic awaits with decades of heavy metal greatness both complimented and extended. \n\nThank you, gentlemen.\n\n(Originally written for www.metalpsalter.com)\n",
        "\n\"The Eternal Idol\" was no mega hit, but it was more successful than a lot of heads could have predicted. After a lengthy tour, Tony Iommi and Tony Martin went back in the studio to dish put yet another heaping helping of atmospheric heavy metal. Iommi later reflected that much was well in his life at this time, and the whole process of making this album was considerably less chaotic than the work put to make \"The Eternal Idol\". This reflects in 1989's \" Headless Cross\", another excursion into the dark realm of 80's Sabbath. Admittedly overall this effort doesn't pop quite as well as the last album, as it tends to fall really flat near the end of the album. But when all's said and done, good album is a good album, and it includes one of the best metal songs of the 1980's, if not ever...\n\nBlack Sabbath turned back into a tighter team this time thanks to meticulous auditions and the help of friends. Iommi still kills in the way of memorable riffs and shredding solos, which now feel even more spirited than on the last album. Tony Martin gives one hell of a performance once more, his series of humming wails and howls as darkly powerful as ever. Replacing Bob Daisley is one Laurence Cottle, whose swaggering string work adds immensely to the heaviness and aura. Lastly the drumming. Oh yes, on the kit is the late, legendary skin-basher Cozy Powell, giving a restrained but very powerful and stead-sure performance throughout the record.\n\nLike I mentioned before, the album is rather front-heavy with the stronger tracks, while later on it kinda fizzles out. But even still the spooky atmosphere remains strong. \"Kill In The Spirit World\" and \"Call of The Wild\" have a few okay riffs thrown around but otherwise they're really boring and kinda keep going on and on. Also, I'm sure I'm gonna get crucified for this, but I never really liked \"Nightwing\". OUCH! Someone just threw something heavy at me and I seem to be bleeding profusely...OK, I'm back. Yeah, I know everyone seems to go ga-ga for this track but I never found it terribly engaging or interesting. No apologies. Most else though is damn fine, like the stomping, bluesy heaviness of the cool \"Black Moon\" or the catchy, vaguely commercially-accessible \"Devil And Daughter\". Then...the title track. Oh my fucking head wound. This is one of Sabbath's best songs. This is one of the best metal songs of the 80's. This is one of the best metal songs EVER! The thundering drum fill to hook you in, the fluttering, deep bass, the skull-crushing buildup to the chorus, and that riff, oh my fuck that heavy fucking RIFF! You got to hear this one to believe it, preferably in front of your computer at the stroke of midnight with all the lights turned off. \n\nOverall, \"Headless Cross\" lacks a little of that oomph that made \"Eternal Idol\" stronger, but it's still no weak effort. The performance of the band is tight as hell, the riffs and solos kill aside from a few clunkers, and that rich, dark atmosphere still rides on high. Black Sabbath waits for you, for death, for torture...AT THE HEADLESS CROOOOOOOSSS!\n",
        "\nWhen one thinks of the mid to late 1980's, Black Sabbath seems to rarely spring forth as one of the prime examples of heavy metal reigning at the time. The name seemed to harken back to a bygone era of music, a name that seemed like it may keel over at any moment. But Tony Iommi, the face and true driving force of Black Sabbath despite what media twats and depraved Ozzy fanbitches want you to think, was one not to give in. A black cloud of difficulties plagued the man at this time, whether it was a myriad of studio issues or ugly matters in his own life. Yet, even in a haze of drugs and a legion of nonbelievers who had little to no faith in the name Black Sabbath anymore, Tony still managed to give us \"The Eternal Idol\". In my opinion it's arguably one of the best, if not the best, of the band's 80's efforts. Aside from a few musical shortcomings and a couple more boring tracks, \"The Eternal Idol\" is a solid accomplishment full of riffs, tight musicianship and rich atmosphere.\n\nTony Iommi is still at a creative high here, despite his drug and marital problems at the time. The metal god's memorable riffs and rich solos still bleed with creativity and emotion. The bass is an interesting story, as apparently the strings were plinked by several different people on several different tracks during several different takes, another studio issue. The credit ultimately went to noted Ozzy Osbourne (another weird connection) bassist Bob Daisley, who puts on a solid, workmanlike show, as does the stable, powerful drumming of Eric Singer. And speaking of singers, another studio problem was the need to rerecord the vocals of the late Ray Gillen, who was blown out of his mind during much of the recording process. Enter one of Black Sabbath finest singers, Tony Martin. Martin brings back some of that Dio swagger and growl, though lacking that heavier-hitting power in Dio's vocals; Martin's howls feel a tad cleaner, even more angelic in a way. Together, the two Tonys are a force to be reckoned with. \n\nThe production is a stupendous high mark, rich in atmosphere and a clean but still heavy aura to it, further enhanced by the subtle but notable airy keyboard work of the great Geoff Nicholls. The music itself continues on the path of the power metal-like territory first awaken by \"Heaven And Hell\" 7 years back; it feels comparably similar to the Iommi solo project \"Seventh Star\" as well, but with more of that traditional Sabbath bluesiness back in the mix. And like typical Sabbath, much of the songs don't stray past mid-paced, though we do have a couple more uptempo stompers in the catchy, bluesy \"Hard Life To Live\" or one of my favorites on here \"Born To Lose\". We have more atmosphere drenched in the slower stuff, like the solid \"Nightmare\", which begins with spooky chimes and the like before going into and riding a classic Iommi riff for a bit before getting a bit faster towards the end. The title track brings a sense of evil the Ozzy stuff had into the atmosphere. Then there's the opener \"The Shining\"; definitely a classic if not for that ear worm main riff alone, even if it's basically the \"Heaven And Hell\" riff sped up a bit.\n\nOverall, this is and still remains one of the best Sabbath studio albums that many have never heard. There's a few so-so songs and boring moments (\"Ancient Warrior\" and \"Glory Ride\", while both good, aren't terribly memorable), but much of it is enlightening by the strong, atmosphere-heavy production. Not to mention it's all backed up by the always strong work of Tony Iommi, as well as the much-welcomed addition of Tony Martin. \"The Eternal Idol\" was first released in November of 1987. Can you imagine? Cruising down an isolated country road, it's not quite dark, but an eerie mix of black, blue and dark yellow hang in the sky. The wind blows light as yellow and red leaves sway across your windshield, the moody \"The Shining\" reaching from your speakers, always ready to stay eternal.\n",
        "\nAlbums don't come more eagerly anticipated than this. The first recorded work of an original Black Sabbath line-up (well, almost) in 35 years has been enough to send paroxysms of excitement throughout the metal world and far beyond, but like all such highly promoted releases the hyperbole often clouds true judgements of quality. As a committed Sabbath fan of a measly 12 years I can't hide my excitement at the arrival of \"13\" but how does it stack up against one of the most revered back catalogues in rock history?\n\n\"End of the Beginning\" starts in a suitably imposing manner - a stomping, pounding riff breaks into a more restrained variation, an instant indication that the gloomy doom template of yore is to be recited, albeit with the crisper clearer production that is nominally to be expected from a Rick Rubin release. Enter then one John Michael Osbourne, whose opening line of \"Is this the beginning of the end?\" is suitably precinct given the circumstances. His legacy needs no further introduction - it is one that makes his enduring survival to this date astounding - but it is unlikely to be boosted further by the addition of \"13\" to his discography. Recognition must be given to the truth that Ozzy has never had the vocal quality to rival the likes of Dio or Rob Halford, but it is all too apparent when he signs \"Lost in the darkness I fade from the light\" at the start of \"God is Dead?\" or through the \"Planet Caravan\"-esque \"Zeigeist\" to note the production values that have gone into generating a computerised version of his 1970s self. Such touches of fairy dust have the effect of reducing the capacity for Sabbath to recreate the natural sound of their classic material, although his undeniable enthusiasm heard through the amount of \"Come on now!\" and \"Alright yeh!\"'s make his struggles a more touching affair. Ozzy's performance simply accentuates the weight of expectation on the riff-writing performance of Tony Iommi, a man who fits the bill of the ultimate metal guitar god.\n\nStockpiled in that opening duo are signs of the riffs that have built Iommi's legacy, but taking into account their positioning at the forefront of the album I can't help but feel their pounding simplicity sounds dumbed down in comparison to the sheer scale of not just classics from the early Sabbath LPs, but Heaven & Hell\u2019s 2009 effort \"The Devil You Know\". Take \"God is Dead?\" for example - the heavy opening and closing which book-end the softer tones around the vocals feel a cop-out and limit the song's ability to generate the ominous darkness that is historically the Sabbath staple.\n\nThe more nuanced \"Age of Reason\", replete with a thunderous bass performance from Geezer Butler and the rather reserved drum rhythms of Rage Against the Machine's Brad Wilk (more on that later) mark it as a contender for the comeback track of the album. Having gotten through the downbeat opening pair \"Loner\" kicks into a more positive \"Sabotage\" style vibe as Ozzy sympathises with the outcast in the subject's matter: \"I wonder if he will be happy when he's dead\". \"Live Forever\" enters life with a descending riff of relative non-descriptness before it perks up dramatically with a bass driven tempo and some of Ozzy's better vocal lines in the piece, as he sings \"I don't wanna live forever but I don't wanna die\" he leads the song into some characteristic Iommi soloing and the chance for him to lead the song to a unusually swift (for this album) sub-five minute conclusion. It is no \"Paranoid\" in length or effectiveness but it certainly resembles the mindset of that classic.\n\nThe slow, moody, bluesy \"Damaged Soul\" is the closest Wilk comes to being able to add his own touch to \"13\". One wonders what Bill Ward may have been able to do had he been on the \"13\" stool as his jazzy rhythms would have felt much more at home on both this track and the album as a whole for Wilk offers little more than solid yet uninspiring beats at all turns. Instead \"Damaged Soul\" is most notable for Butler's excellent showing and Iommi's lead solos that at times recall Down, a band unashamed of their Sabbath influence and who harbour their own unique brand of blues-incorporated doom. \"Dear Father\" runs with a similar beat to much of what has come before and therein lies the rub - this collection of slow-mid tempo riffs offer a collection that would be the best most other bands could offer - the kind to get the head nodding at all times - but when held up against the sheer mind-blowing quality of the riffs on 70s Sabbath material it naturally struggles in comparison.\n\nMy copy of the album comes with a bonus disc of three tracks; drug-themed \"Methademic\" starts as if a cut-off from Metallica's \"Black Album\" before being most notable for some odd vocal patterns from Ozzy late on; \"Peace of Mind\" feels rather like a solo Ozzy track from his successful 80\u2019s career while closer \"Pariah\" is the best of the three and could easily have adorned the main album proper.\n\nIt would be easy to accuse Black Sabbath of being a legacy band in 2013 but rather than this being a B-league band from back in the day rehashing past glories this is the band that has brought us all here, made everything we love in metal possible and for that they will always have time in the hearts of millions. \"13\" is by no means perfect but it still offers plenty to love for those who have waited many, many years for this moment and that is definitely worth celebrating. \n\nOriginally written for www.Rockfreaks.net\n",
        "\nIf you went 7 years back in time and told me that in 2013 Black Sabbath would release a new album with Ozzy Osbourne, I would have been very skeptical to put it mildly. It seems that pigs do fly though, and now we have it - a new album from the original line-up (sadly minus Bill Ward) titled 13. \n\nLet's get one thing out of the way first: like most Sabbath fans, I would have loved for Bill Ward to have played on this album. However with that being said, I think Brad Wilk does an admirable job filling in and my grade for this album is solely a reflection upon the quality (or lack thereof) of the music. \n\nRick Rubin allegedly asked the band to approach this album as if they were making the follow up to their debut album and after listening to it, that much is obvious. There's a track here that pays heavy tribute to Planet Caravan. There's a track with harmonica and there's even a rain, thunder, and church bell outro to the last track (not counting the bonus tracks). In some ways this all smells a lot like the first 4 Black Sabbath albums and there is definitely a lot of nostalgia on offer here. Sadly, that's all there is to it. \n\nThe first 2 tracks, \"End of the Beginning\" and \"God is Dead?\", is like walking through the desert. Once you make it through, you will be parched for water, but sadly all there is is a poor man's version of \"Planet Caravan\" called \"Zeitgeist\". \"Loner\" doesn't fare much better, and while the galloping riff of \"Live Forever\" sounds a bit like \"Children of the Grave\", it isn't half as good. Next the band chew the cud on a pair of brooding and doomy tracks called \"Damaged Soul\" and \"Dear Father\". \"Damaged Soul\" is the better of the 2 and offers some nice guitar work from Iommi, but it's a very small light in the darkness if you ask me. \n\nIf you own a version with the bonus tracks, you have a nifty little song called \"Methademic\", which compared to the rest of the album is surprisingly good. The rest aren't any better than what is on offer on the standard version. \n\nWith this album Black Sabbath had created a self-indulgent tribute to their own legacy. I don't know why they feel the rest of us had to listen to it too, though. All it does for me is make me want to put on Master of Reality or Paranoid. The band has said this might not be their last album together, but if it is, I'm not too bothered.\n",
        "\nThis album is perfect. It's so utterly perfect overall that it inevitably starts sleazing at some stage simply because one hardly expected that the grandfathers of the genre, being in their mid/late-60's, would be able to fulfill all the expectations with this effort, and even to go beyond that. And this is this \"beyond\" part which kind of sleazes...\n\nAs a rule a really perfect piece of art is not supposed to get a 100% score hence the evaluation here. But the truth is that these ears thoroughly enjoyed this carefully crafted slab of high-octane antedeluvian doom metal which finally provided the missing link between \"Paranoid\" and \"Master of Reality\". The \"masters of reality\" go through the motions without rushing forward so there are no energizing galloping riffs here ala \"Children of the Grave\"; neither are there any discordant proto-thrashy shreds in the spirit of \"After Forever\". The guys simply doom, doom... and doom for almost an hour oblivious to any current trends on the scene fixed upon the times when they literally created everything we call metal nowadays. \n\nThose who expected Ozzy to flop will apparently have to wait for the next installment of his family's reality show. Because the man pulls out commendable, albeit calculated and obvioulsy guided, performance although he very seldom risks his voice beyond the meditative semi-stoned clean croon which gives the album a spacey psychedelic vibe. But let's leave him alone (the media already bothers him too much), and look at the other heroes involved here: Geezer traditionally provides a solid, never obtrusive and show-offy, bass bottom and he doesn't disappoint here pulling the fat strings unerringly in a simplistic reverberating fashion. \n\nMr. Iommi, the master of the riff, serves some of his heaviest ship-sinking guitar parts which still sound impressive without the dirty, macabre atmosphere of their early recordings. His performance in particular evokes a strong feeling of deja-vu at times (\"End of Beginning\" with its slooow never-ending riffs is a nod to \"Black Sabbath\"; the main riff on \"Loner\" is an audacious reference to \"N.I.B.\", the not very necessary one here; \"Zeitgeist\" is a largely successful combination of the band's highest achievements in the ballad sector: \"Planet Caravan\" and \"Solitude\"; etc.), but very few could expect the man to re-invent himself at this age. So doom on, Tony...\n\nBrad Wilk (Rage Against the Machine) must have been ecstatic when he was asked to replace the \"traitor\" Bill Ward, but his not very emotional timid drumming hardly does justice both to him and to the album. The thundering bottom of Ward is sadly missing at times, especially on the slower sections Wilk's jingling hardly bringing even the slightest tremors in the listener's ears. He's apparently much more conscious of not messing it up rather than doing his best. And he almost manages to succeed in the former... \n\nSo there are flaws here after all. Yes, there are, but the joy of listening to the Sabbaths playing the good old stuff gelling so well after a lifetime of separation sweeps all of them away; with a single Ozzy stoned croon; with a single Iommi doomy chord; with a single Geezer fat string burp. Number 13 didn't prove fatal to the band; on the contrary, it sees them alive and well to pull a few more similar numbers in the future. This reunion may not make them exactly \"lords of this world\", but it would by all means erase the \"grand\" part from \"fathers\". All right now...\n",
        "\nWhile the magic of the first (6? 8?) Sabbath records is credited equally to Bill, Ozzy, Tony and Geezer, for the most part Black Sabbath was and always will be Tony Iommi and the quality of their records hinges upon how the others play off his riffs. With Ozzy's mojo long-lost and Bill out of the picture entirely, expectations were understandably low for 13. These weaknesses do show up from time to time, but surprisingly, it turned out to be a pretty good album, even by Sabbath standards.\n\nIt's been noted that some songs are reminiscent of others. This doesn't bother me, as it's nothing new for Tony and Sabbath. How many times did we get another version of Neon Knights to open a record in the early '80s? How many songs since 1980 feature the Heaven and Hell gallop? How much does Symptom of the Universe sound like Black Sabbath sped up? True, End of the Beginning does sound like the opener on the debut, but it's also pretty similar to Illusion of Power from the Forbidden record. Loner calls on the riff from NIB but the vocal line is similar to Air Dance, of all things. The jazzy leads at the end of Zeitgeist (appropriate name for a throwback to Planet Caravan) likewise remind me more of Air Dance than anything. I think if it weren't for the bongos, the Planet Caravan comparison wouldn't be as obvious. Live Forever resurrects the riff from Zero the Hero in a livelier fashion. All these instances are more hints than direct self-ripoffs. A Tony riff sounds like a Tony riff and Tony riffs are what Sabbath is made of.\n\nOzzy's vocals are under-produced and I'm not even sure if they're double tracked. He used to layer and harmonize his vocals even at the height of his ability 40 years ago - why these tools weren't employed this time around is beyond me. It would have really helped. His patterns and melodies are more or less the same throughout, sometimes working just fine and sometimes lacking inspiration. Brad Wilk does a very good job, as good as anyone they ever had play drums in Sabbath. The absent Bill Ward would have added some real spice and variety to Tony's compositions to make this a more enjoyable listen. He is missed.\n\nLike its predecessor The Devil You Know, 13 starts out too slow for too long. I might have ordered the songs differently on each, to mix the faster and slower numbers more evenly for better digestion. All in all both albums are probably too long for their own good.\n\nThe bonus track Naivety in Black is the prize of the bunch, with enough heaviness and momentum to stand proudly next to anything they've ever done. I would include it in any home-made Sabbath compilation. Live Forever easily makes the list of keepers, and when Damaged Soul picks up towards the end it's a genuine Sabs jam I can imagine listening to on a bootleg from 1974. Tony will probably never run out of riffs and there isn't a song on here that doesn't make me crack a wicked smile at some point in awe of his mastery. He still manages to throw in weird intervals and unexpected chromatic movements that keep things fresh yet still familiar. The old records will never leave our players, but if you crank this one with an open mind you might come away with more than you expected.\n",
        "\nSo after the string of controversies and accidents that linked the four principle individuals involved with the release, it is quite a surprise (well for me at least) that we had the blessing of seeing Black Sabbath's name on a full length for the eighteenth time. The oddly titled 13, takes things in a traditional route of the early 70s; slow, crushing and bluesy yet simple and straight-forward. 13, being a heavily expected and awaited release for one due to this being the very first release under the Sabbath name since the mediocre Forbidden in 1995 and the first since 1978 featuring original vocalist Ozzy Osbourne, doesn't quite get hammered down by expectations and lives up quite strongly up to the name of its creators.\n\nThe problems that plague this record tend to be with the producer, the vocalist and the drummer. No matter how hard fans had called for a reunion with him, few can now deny that Ozzy Osbourne's voice is not even a shadow of the man he was once. His studio albums had been perfectly engineered with effects making his vocals listenable. But we find no such ingenious ideas at work on this release and the vocals to be atrocious at best. The man now no longer has any knack of keeping a note steady and on this record it seems he is not even trying earnestly. Oh well everyone might agree that he was never one of the better vocalists technically to begin with, but he always came up with an honest performance and sang from his heart. Megalomania, Black Sabbath, Sabra Cadabra; need I say more. The production problems stem up from the very horrible sound of the drums and guitars. Now guitars being prominent in the mix is a great thing but here on this record the guitars have a dense, sludgy and muddy sound that sounds more processed than raw. Original drummer Bill Ward's absence meant Black Sabbath needed a temporary drummer. So in came Brad Wilk of Rage Against The Machine fame. Now I will never even start comparing him with Ward, but a competent and professional performance was expected from him which his is far away from. \n\nAmong the positives, the compositions are quite good, though far from Iommi's more recent works with Glenn Hughes and Ronnie James Dio. The riffs, though sometimes sounding quite a bit stale, are composed quite well and are simple in structure. Geezer Butler gives a superb performance with the bass which has become customary of him. The consistency of the record is so-so. But when the tracks get going, they do manage to pack a solid punch. Among the tracks, the final two tracks Damaged Soul and Dear Father and the opener End Of The Beginning are absolute gems. The closer Dear Father especially has a very dark and haunting chorus and a great performance from Geezer with the bass. End Of The Beginning is a lengthy and progressive track with very well constructed riffs from Iommi which gel perfectly into each other. The catchy single God Is Dead? and Age Of Reason are good yet flawed tracks. God Is Dead? works very well with it's catchy chorus but drags along for quite a while and would have sounded infinitely better had a couple of minutes been chucked out from it. Age Of Reason falls flat on its face with its main mid paced riff, which though good, is repeated far too much. A great solo towards the end from Iommi forms the highlight of the track. Loner and Zeitgeist are the low points in the album. Zeitgeist totally falls apart with its Planet Caravan worship with absolutely hideous vocals courtesy Ozzy Osbourne and drags along far too long. Loner, with its N.I.B. ripped off main riff is far too simple and repetitive and tends to be sleep inducing at best. \n\nCasting the nostalgia around the record aside, this is a flawed yet good record which has been drenched back and forth in controversies. The album reflects the absolute hopelessness and despair that has always been the highlight of this band's music and proves that age has not made the masterminds behind it slouches in their art. Though some of the work from this record might be absolutely great, the record as a whole does not hold far too much staying power. Bottom-line; 13 is recommended to all the fans of the band who would instantly identify with the band's roots for a couple of spins at least.\n",
        "\nFinally we have the release of the new highly anticipated Black Sabbath album showcasing the original line up from the 70's minus Bill Ward and whilst it is a good album, it's not without its faults and doesn't completely stand up to quality of the first six albums with Ozzy on vocals. That being said, I really do enjoy listening to the album, I just feel that it could have been better.\n\nMany have bemoaned the fact that Bill Ward was not included and at risk of sounding like a broken record, his jazzy, groove style of playing is greatly missed here and I think that had they got a drummer similar in style to Bill Ward it would have added an extra dimension to the songs (I know it's probably completely improbable, but imagine having a drummer like Neal Peart on the drums for Black Sabbath in place of Bill Ward! Now that would have been something!). \n\nI'm not going to bash Brad Wilk, as he he is an accomplished drummer in his own right, his drumming on the album isn't bad at all and I am a fan of Rage Against The Machine, it's just that he is a very straightforward hard rock drummer and Ozzy era Black Sabbath is known for the jazzy drumming style of Bill Ward. \n\nAnother criticism is that a lot of the songs seem to plod along at the same pace and it would have been nice to hear a few faster paced songs to break the album up. In addition and as has been said previously, Black Sabbath are not only renowned as the inventors of heavy metal and doom, they are also renowned as the inventors of stoner and sludge and their early compositions also contained elements psychedelia and progressive rock and the inclusion of some of the aforementioned styles into some of the compositions would have moved it away from being just purely a doom album and more in keeping with their original 70's sound which incorporated all of these styles. \n\nLastly, Rick Rubin. How this man is a world renowned producer is beyond me. The production on this album is too crystalline, too clear and overproduced, the drums too low in the mix (Rubin hasn't really done Brad Wilk any favours in this department) and the sound clipped and mastered too high. It was apparently Sabbath's intention to make the album modern sounding and up to date, but if you compare the production on this album against the production of the Heaven & Hell Album, The Devil You Know, it pales in comparison. I think this album would have sounded better had Iommi produced it himself. I also believe Rick Rubin is solely responsible for stifling their creativity by making them try to recreate something they had done in their past. \n\nHowever, in spite of the above, there are some good points to the album. the riffs on God Is Dead? after the 6 minute mark are pretty cool (I don't like the guitar solo however, far too simple for a man of Iommi's talents and his tone is kinda strange), Loner and Zeitgeist (although sounding quite similar to Sabbath Bloody Sabbath and Planet Caravan) are pretty good songs. I think my personal favourites on the album are Age of Reason, Damaged Soul (evil blues with Jimi Hendrix style guitar solos - sounds like it could be off Grand Magus' self titled album) and Dear Father (Methademic is also a pretty decent song - definitely opt for the bonus disc version). \n\nApparently Ozzy has stated that \"there'll probably be another Black Sabbath album\" - I really do hope there is and that they get Bill Ward back on board and produce it themselves as that would be one hell of an album. Until then, this will be on heavy rotation.\n",
        "\nSo the first Black Sabbath album in 18 years, or the first Black Sabbath album with Ozzy on vocals in 35 years, is finally here. Following the departure of original drummer Bill Ward, due to contractual conflicts and who knows what else, Brad Wilk of Rage Against The Machine is handling the drums on this album. I can\u2019t say that I dared to hope for a masterpiece album, especially not after God Is Dead? was released as a single - a song that I still feel is one of the weakest of the album. It just sounds very predictable to me, if that makes any sense.\n\nThe first thing that struck me when I listened to 13 was that some melodies were very familiar. The opening track End Of The Beginning is a slow, heavy song which bears many resemblances to the Black Sabbath - i.e. the self-titled song from the 1970 album - as well as the track Hammer Of Doom from Candlemass\u2019 2009 album Death Magic Doom. The song does however take an interesting turn about halfway through and I find I enjoy the song quite much. A little bit later on we have the song Zeitgeist which is basically a more boring version of Planet Caravan, with the same kind of instrumental set up but lacking that psychedelic groove.\n\nThe album sounds more or less the way you\u2019d expect a Black Sabbath album to sound in 2013. Brad Wilk does an okay job at the drums but I do miss Bill Ward\u2019s creative drum fills from the old days. The best performances of the album come from the gentlemen Geezer Butler and Tony Iommi, who complement each other fantastically. Geezer\u2019s thick, organic bass playing lays the foundation upon which Tony\u2019s riffs and solos sound even better, with the jamming-style second part of Damaged Soul as a shining example of this. It\u2019s just too bad that Ozzy really don\u2019t have any power left in his voice, although this should come as a surprise to nobody. Someone said that it sounds as if he\u2019s singing while sitting in a comfortable armchair and that\u2019s a pretty accurate description, in my opinion.\n\nThis album naturally has many similarities with 2009\u2019s The Devil You Know, both in how it\u2019s produced and in the overall impression of the songs. Actually, to me Loner sounds like a song written for Dio and not for Ozzy - especially the intro sounds like something off of Heaven And Hell or Mob Rules; I enjoy its straightforward rock \u2018n\u2019 roll feeling nonetheless.\n\nThe lyrics seem to be focused a lot around death, which is logical with Tony\u2019s battle against cancer in mind. It\u2019s something that gives an extra impact to the music \u2013 for example, the phrase \u201cI don\u2019t want to live forever but I don\u2019t want to die\u201d from Live Forever suddenly means a lot more than it would have otherwise. All in all, this is an okay album with some great moments and some weaker moments. If you enjoyed The Devil You Know then you\u2019ll probably like this album as well and I guess that which album you\u2019ll prefer of the two eventually boils down to whether you prefer Ozzy or Dio on vocals. Take it for what it is - a Black Sabbath album recorded 45 years after the band started out. After all this time, Tony Iommi still knows how to write new, awesome riffs but sadly Ozzy\u2019s singing is the weak link.\n\nOriginally written for www.metalcovenant.com\n",
        "\nWow Black Sabbath is back and I could not be happier. We have the legends and innovators of heavy metal back with a new album With Ozzy, Geezer and Tony back in the fold. Ozzy is back on a Sabbath album for the first time since 1978\u2019s Never Say Die and Geezer is back with his first Sabbath album since Cross Purposes. I am sure you all know the back story to this by now but Bill Ward was unable to join in with the group due to a contract dispute. That is just fine in my book as we still have \u00be original members and a worthy drummer who is nothing more than a session musician. Brad Wilk from Rage Against the Machine and Audioslave filled in for Bill and did an admiral job.\n\nTony Iommi is and always will be the god of riffs and that comes as no surprise as this album is filled with many memorable ones. From the intro to End of the Beginning to the bluesy Damaged Soul, there is plenty enough here for Tony to keep his well-deserved throne. I am not sure how he pulled this off with his lymphoma and he deserves all the credit in the world for delivering us the incredible riffs and solos.\n\nGeezer Butler really shines on this album and I can hear his bass clearly. In fact, all of the instruments are clear on this album but the bass really rumbles on this. It is nothing that Geezer has not done before but his playing is as solid as ever. As many of us know he is also the main lyricist of the group and has never received an ounce of criticism from me before. Overall the lyrics are good but are sometimes sloppy and thrown together on the fly. \u201cHe\u2019s just a loner, he never says hello\u201d is just one example of the poorly written lyrics. The lyrics in Loner are pretty dull and just don\u2019t cut it which is very disappointing. There are some fine moments like in EOTB like \u201cReanimation of the sequence, rewind the future to the past and reanimation of your cyber sonic soul, transforming time and space beyond control\u201d. These fine moments are extremely catchy and enhance the listening experience for me.\n\nOzzy appears to be revitalized on this album and his performance shows passion and energy. It is about what I expect from a man who is pushing 70 and probably should be dead by now. He doesn't really \u201csing\u201d great on the album but there are moments of greatness like the \u201cI don\u2019t want to see you\u201d part in EOTB. He hits a soaring high part and pulls it off magnificently. Half of the time he is just half talking or rapping the lyrics as featured on the lines from God is Dead?. There are still great melodies that he came up with and it shows that he can still work well developing melodies with Tony Iommi. The big difference between Ozzy solo and Black Sabbath is that he is just another band member in Sabbath and he doesn\u2019t have the pressures of working exclusively by himself. I think this motivated him to do his very best for the band because this could be the last we ever hear from him and he wanted to preserve the legacy of the original eight albums. I know I definitely appreciate what he has done and if this is his swansong then he will go out fronting the band that started it all for him!\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Brad Wilk does just fine on this album. He tries to emulate Bill Ward and it works to a certain extent. I would much rather have had Ward on the album, but we get what we get. I am not really going to praise or condemn his work on the album because he is just a fill in session member. The other three members really steal the show on this one and they are most important to the success of this album. Bill Ward could have done this album easily and there is a lot he could have brought to the table with his originality. There are not many who can jazz and Swing like Bill and it is disappointing he was not present. That is why I have marked down 8 points off the score to make that a point of emphasis. One aspect that really stands out to me is the bongos on Zeitgeist. They act as a brilliant change of pace with their soothing atmosphere and simplicity. Otherwise this is a pretty generic offering from Brad as a whole.\n\nI think the best way to describe this album is that it is homage to the original 8 albums. That may really bother some people but almost every song is influenced by their past. We have the bells and thunder in Dear Father akin to the original bells, rain and thunder in the original Black Sabbath song. We have the spacey and psychedelic ballad Zeitgeist which sounds like Planet Caravan or Solitude. End of the Beginning sounds like a mix between Cornucopia and Black Sabbath with the ultra-heavy riffs at the beginning, and the prolonged solos akin to Dirty Women. Loner is a 21st century NIB and the list goes on. It is really just Black Sabbath with a modern day twist.\n\nWith 13, Sabbath was not going to reinvent the wheel but they stuck with their great formula. Those original 8 will always be better than 13 and will be what Sabbath is known for in the end, but it is nice to have something fresh and new to sink our teeth into. I never thought the album would be a reality but we are blessed to receive this. Thank you Rick Rubin, Tony, Geezer and Ozzy for giving us an album to be proud of.\n",
        "\nOriginally written for Me Gusta Reviews. www.megustareviews.com\n\nDoom metal pioneers, and masters of \"the riff,\" Black Sabbath, have dropped their highly-anticipated release 13. For the serious metal fan, Sabbath needs no introduction, and because I assume my readers are \"serious metal fans,\" I will provide no introduction. I couldn't do this legendary band justice if I tried!\n\nThe songs found on this record are heavy, well composed and well recorded. There is an excellent flow from track to track, and each track demonstrates that the three members of Sabbath can still dominate the riff. Three members of Black Sabbath...this is where my problems with this record, and the band, begin. We all remember very vividly how the band ostracized Bill Ward and we witnessed him being discarded by the wayside, both physically as the drummer of Black Sabbath and historically (Bill Ward being erased from all Sabbath's photographs). This public shaming of Bill by the remaining three original members came off as childish, immature and unnecessary. Furthermore, it left die-hard fans asking, \"Why\"? However, remaining optimistic, fans anticipated the return of Vinnie Appice, but he was never consulted. The drummer picked to record this record was Brad Wilk of Rage Against the Machine notoriety, but I'll discuss his selection in more detail later. The fire and passion of Bill Ward's drumming is absent from this release and any Sabbath fan can hear that something is missing regarding these new songs.\n\nI personally felt no heart while listening to this record. I had no desire to headbang (let alone bob my head to the beat). All I heard while listening to this record was a band writing a new album to cash in on their name and notoriety, which resulted in a very stale, unimpressive and bland feeling on the listening end. Sabbath also seems to be ripping off their own songs on this record. For example, the opening track, \"End of the Beginning,\"seems very similar to the classic \"Black Sabbath\" off their very first record. Both structurally and dynamically, all I could think back to while listening to this track was \"Black Sabbath.\" Secondly, the band pulls a similar stunt with the song \"Zeitgeist.\" Rather than hear the song for what it is, all I could think back to was 'Planet Caravan\" of Paranoid fame. Because of the two instances described above, the only thought to enter my mind upon the conclusion of this record was \"cash cow.\"\n\nRegarding the production of this record, the only complaint I have is the guitar solo towards the end of \"End of the Beginning\" is mixed quite obnoxiously over the vocal line (on most records you listen to, when a solo and vocal line join together, the vocals usually take the predominant seat in the mix, but what do I know?). Other than this one personal peeve, the album sounds impeccable. Rick Rubin has done another phenomenal job at the mixing desk! Nothing more needs to be said regarding this outstanding audio engineer and his great catalog of work.\n\nBrad Wilk is known for his extensive work with hard rock outfit Rage Against the Machine. Many Sabbath fans were taken by surprise when he was announced as the drummer for this record (I was among those fans). I think Brad does a great job on this record, but I have to admit, I feel bad for the guy, and here's why. He wasn't on Sabbath's radar until Rubin recommended him, making it clear that if it weren't for Rubin, someone else probably would be on this record. Secondly, he was not offered to join the band before or during the recording of the record (something that probably won't happen even after the official release) and he is listed as \"Guest/Session\" on Metal Archives. Thirdly, when (and if) Sabbath hits the road in support of 13, I feel Brad Wilk will not be joining them onstage. Conclusion? I feel Brad was used by the band for their own personal gain, and no musician \u2013 especially one as well-known and respected as Brad \u2013 should be subject to that treatment.\n\n13 marks a return for Black Sabbath, but a return for the sole purpose of cashing in on the Sabbath name and legacy. The album has no heart, no Bill Ward (or Vinnie Appice) and fails to grasp and hold the listener in interest. The records of the Osbourne and Dio era effectively drown 13 (is this a surprise?). One can state that this record stands alongside (or slightly above) the Martin era records, but even the Martin era records are drowned by the Osbourne and Dio era records, so this comparison in itself fails 13. Here's my advice. Give this record a once over and upon the conclusion of 13, dust off those old Master of Reality, Paranoid, Vol. 4 and Sabotage records for the real magic, and remember Black Sabbath as they were, not as the childish, immature band they have become.\n",
        "\nIt\u2019s only a slight exaggeration to state that reunion albums are inherently doomed to failure. Reunion albums are always weighed down with burden of being compared to bands\u2019 past accomplishments. Very few bands manage to come even close to those lofty expectations. The pressure is even greater when the band is as iconic as Black Sabbath\u2014the band most responsible for the genesis of heavy metal. The expectations and hype have been compounded by decades of speculation about a reunion album between the band\u2019s four original members. Over the last fifteen years Tony Iommi, Ozzy Osbourne, Geezer Butler and Bill Ward have sporadically performed together live; in 2001 they even started recording an album, only to abandon it when side projects got in the way.\n\nThus, when the four legends from Birmingham announced in 2011 that a new Black Sabbath album was in the works, it looked like the world would receive the first studio recording from the original Black Sabbath lineup since 1978. However, it wasn\u2019t meant to be; drummer Bill Ward was unhappy with the offered financial compensation and was swiftly replaced by Rage Against the Machine drummer Brad Wilk. Still, 13 marks the first Black Sabbath album since 1996 and the first with Ozzy since 1978.\n\n13 kicks off with a dark, distorted riff set to a drum beat fit for a funeral dirge. After a few bars, the distortion drops outs, leaving a spooky melody and devious drum beat, setting the stage for the introduction of Ozzy, whose first line is a question: \u201cIs this the end of the beginning?\u201d. Sound familiar? Yes, that\u2019s exactly how Sabbath\u2019s self-titled debut opens (\u201cWhat is this that stands before me?\u201d). Like most reunion albums, 13 doesn\u2019t muddy the waters with innovation; instead it regurgitates the sound of Sabbath\u2019s glory days. 13 is predominately comprised of slow, doomy cuts of heavy metal that recall the first four Sabbath records. There are occasional touches of psychedelia that hint at the group\u2019s next two albums, Sabbath Bloody Sabbath and Sabotage.\n\nSo how does Sabbath do at replicating its classic sound? In a word: adequate. Everything about this album is just good enough. With regards to Ozzy, \u201cjust good enough\u201d is more than anyone who listened to his last few solo albums could have expected. His vocals have become increasingly laughable over the last decade, marked by poor delivery and an overdose of tasteless studio effects. Producer Rick Rubin leaves the production gimmicks at a minimum, allowing Ozzy\u2019s rickety cackle to be what it is. Ozzy isn\u2019t able to add as much color to his delivery as he did in the 70\u2019s, but his performance is sufficient.\n\nOn the other hand, \u201cjust good enough\u201d from Tony Iommi is a disappointment. In 2009 Tony Iommi delivered a barrage of devilish riffs on Heaven and Hell\u2019s The Devil You Know. (Heaven and Hell was essentially a reunion of Black Sabbath\u2019s 1981 lineup: Iommi, Butler, drummer Vinny Appice and the late Ronnie James Dio). In contrast to the fire and venom Iommi displayed on The Devil You Know, here he just seems to be going through the motions. The riffs are sufficiently dark and doomy, but by and large, they lack spirit and inspiration. One can\u2019t point to any flat out bad riffs but most of the riffs are about on par with what one finds on your typical retro stoner metal album. There are two exceptions. First, there is the clean psychedelic ballad \u201cZeitgest,\u201d which ends with ends with an absolutely exquisite jazzy guitar solo. Then, there is \u201cDamaged Soul,\u201d which taps back into the Sabbath\u2019s blues roots with a thick, groovy riff and some slow, bluesy soloing. Ozzy even pulls out the harmonica, which hadn't made its mark on a Sabbath record since the 1970 debut.\n\nRick Rubin\u2019s production job is a mixed bag. On one hand, he does manage to make Ozzy sound like a competent vocalist\u2014no small feat in 2013\u2014but on the other hand, he also puts Ozzy\u2019s vocals upfront in the mix. Why put the weakest link in the forefront? The other instruments just aren\u2019t muscular enough. The drums are especially in need of a little more power.\n\nPeople will be quick to compare 13 to Sabbath\u2019s classic records, but it isn\u2019t fair to expect a band to match records that literally reshaped the landscape of popular music. A fairer comparison would be the reunion albums of other heavy metal icons such as Iron Maiden (2000\u2019s Brave New World) and Judas Priest (2005\u2019s Angel of Retribution). Like Sabbath, both bands mostly stuck to the formula that earned them devoted fan bases in the first place. However, both Priest and Maiden managed to provide more memorable moments and offer more impressive musical and vocal performances than Sabbath has on 13. Thus, even when measured against other reunion albums, 13 is a cut below par. Again, 13 isn\u2019t a bad album, just an album that rarely manages to rise above the genre\u2019s median and even the most pragmatic metal fans had to be hoping for a least a little more than \u201cjust good enough.\u201d\n\nOriginally written for ourvinyl.com\n",
        "\nHow many bands have a legacy as important as the one Black Sabbath has built? The band started a musical revolution and has influenced more bands than anyone, excluding maybe The Beatles. Can a new record live up to a catalog of records that for the last 43 years has been the blueprint for all heavier music? Their new release 13 is their first record with vocalist Ozzy Osbourne in 35 years.\n\nSessions originally started thirteen years ago but soon fizzled out, as the material didn\u2019t live up to the bands expectations. Holding a press conference on 11-11-11 they announced to the world that they had been writing and were going to give it one more try to capture a record they felt was worthy of the Sabbath name. That\u2019s when the wheels began to fall off.\n\nOriginal drummer Bill Ward had a very public battle with the band and withdrew himself from the recording process. Depending on whose side you believe, it was either financially motivated or Ward wasn\u2019t up to the task on playing the drums any longer. Then guitarist Tony Iommi was diagnosed with early stages of lymphoma and has been treating it with chemotherapy, which he will have to endure for the rest of his life. Osbourne also drug relapsed and was separated from his wife Sharon. \n\nLongtime Sabbath fan and producer extraordinaire Rick Rubin was brought in to work with the band for their reunion album. His goal was for Sabbath to go back to the sound of their earliest days. He sat Sabbath down and played them their debut record Black Sabbath. He wanted to instill in them the sound and style that was initially captured and bring back the jazz and blues influences that dominated their early sound.\n\nRubin also recommended Audioslave and Rage Against the Machine drummer Brad Wilk as Ward\u2019s replacement for the sessions. Although initially an odd pairing, Wilk\u2019s sense of style and swing was the perfect choice. \n\n13 opens with the bone crushingly heavy \u201cEnd of the Beginning.\u201d Instantaneously we are brought back to their debut as a plodding guitar line accompanies a vulnerable Ozzy who asks, \u201cIs this the end of the beginning or the beginning of the end?\u201d What a prophetic line for a band that is trying to find their way 43 years after they began. This is an epic track and one that only Sabbath can produce, not containing a chorus and based around five different movements that never repeat. Once the speed picks up this song is an all time classic. \n\nThe acoustic based \u201cZeitgeist\u201d is a throwback to the stylings of \u201cPlanet Caravan\u201d and \u201cSolitude.\u201d A gorgeous acoustic guitar and bongo\u2019s mesh beautifully with an elegant over effected vocal from Ozzy. We are taken on another trip through space with deep lyrics about black holes, string theory and nuclear fission that only Geezer Butler can pen. A perfect interlude on a record that is mostly heavy and crushing.\n\nThe record ends strong with the blues and jam inspired \u201cDamaged Soul\u201d and \u201cDear Father.\u201d The former track is a throwback to their roots and was written and recorded live on the spot. The rawness serves the song as Iommi\u2019s solos are so stunning one feels like they are in the room while he is playing. How many bands could ever imagine coming up with something so stunning while jamming?\n\n\u201cDear Father\u201d accompanies the best chorus on the record and the most disturbing lyric. Dealing with the topic of a pedophile priest who now has to deal with the consequences as one of his victims has come back to murder him. Another ambitious track that is impressive in scope.\n\nThe extended version comes with three bonus tracks (another track is included as a Best Buy exclusive) and they are equally as impressive. The crystal meth inspired \u201cMethademic\u201d is the best of the bunch as it is up-tempo and goes for the throat with one of the best riffs on the record. The now out of print box set comes with a bonus DVD, photographs, a vinyl pressing and hand written lyrics. An impressive and classy looking set.\n\nFive of the eight tracks clock in over the seven-minute mark but in classic Sabbath style the songs never lose their interest, as there are enough changes to keep the listener engaged. 13 is a throwback to the vibe of their first three albums and there are nods and hints at past work but nothing is retread. If we can let Slayer and AC/DC slide on repeating themselves, I think we can accept the band that started it all to dip into their glorious past.\n\n13 is a brilliant return to form and finds Sabbath more cohesive than ever. The combination of Iommi\u2019s riffs, Geezer\u2019s lyrics and Ozzy\u2019s one of a kind voice and melodies is astounding. Ozzy might not have the range he once had but his voice is captured perfectly by Rubin as its emotional, compelling and the best he has sounded since his 1995 solo record Ozzmosis. No Auto-Tune or over processed vocals that Ozzy has been relying on for his past few solo records is to be found.\n\nThis is not only the most anticipated album of the year but of the last 35. If one isn\u2019t a fan of this record I just can\u2019t see them ever being a fan of the original eight records. If this is indeed the end of the beginning then 13 is the perfect exclamation point on a career that is untouchable. \n\nAs a longtime fan I can\u2019t begin to describe the emotion I have had listening to and discovering their new record. Iommi, Butler and Osbourne have been a permanent fixture in my life and 13 feels like old friends coming back home and reminding us all that music is played from ones heart and soul; something that is missing from most of modern day music. \n\n- Originally published at About.com Heavy Metal\n",
        "\nHere\u2019s the rundown on \u201913,\u2019 Ozzy Osbourne\u2018s first full-length album with Black Sabbath in 35 years: It\u2019s not embarrassing in the least. In fact, it\u2019s pretty darn good and at times it\u2019s great.\n\nIt\u2019s unfair to ask, and highly unlikely, that \u201913\u2032 will ever achieve any kind of equal footing alongside the group\u2019s masterful six first albums. But it\u2019s definitely cut from the right cloth, and it\u2019s probably the best effort from anybody on either side of this camp since Osbourne\u2019s \u2018Diary of a Madman\u2019 (R.I.P. Randy Rhoads!) and his former bandmates\u2019 \u2018Mob Rules\u2018 came out in 1981.\n\nIt\u2019s definitely the most mature thing Ozzy\u2019s been a part of in years. His vocal range is diminished, but he uses what he\u2019s got wisely, and it\u2019s great to see him playing songs made for adults instead of trying to get the kids at Hot Topic to \u2018Scream \u2018 along with him. It\u2019s also wonderful to hear him together with guitarist Tony Iommi again \u2014 the re-ignition of their chemistry is obvious from the very start of the album.\n\nYou miss original drummer Bill Ward\u2018s swing, sure. Some of the lyrics (such as the pointless paradoxes \u201cIs this the end of the beginning / Or the beginning of the end?\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t want to live forever / But I don\u2019t want to die\u201d) are groan-worthy. But the participating original members sound fantastic together. Thankfully, the record is not over-produced \u2014 it sounds like three guys playing together in the same room, especially when Geezer Butler\u2019s bass gloriously rumbles just a bit outside of the expected lines.\n\nNaturally, the album\u2019s highlights find the band quite nakedly revisiting some of the peaks of their past. The riff from \u2018N.I.B.\u2019 gets a re-write for the storming \u2018Loner,\u2019 but good luck staying mad about it for more than about a minute. Similarly, the gorgeous \u2018Zeitgest\u2019 harkens back to \u2018Planet Caravan\u2019 right down to the hand drums, processed vocals and spanish guitar accents \u2014 and again, you won\u2019t care.\n\nBlack Sabbath really go back to their beginnings with the heavy blues of \u2018Damaged Soul,\u2019 an eight-minute long harmonica-accented monster which is one Hammond organ short of being among the nastiest Allman Brothers Band songs ever written.\n\n\u201913\u2032 ends with the same church bells heard at the start of Sabbath\u2019s self-titled 1970 debut, and this would indeed be a fine ending to their recording career if that\u2019s what the group intends. But Iommi proves \u2014 as he did on 2009\u2032s Ronnie James Dio-fronted \u2018The Devil You Know\u2018 \u2014 that he\u2019s still got plenty of riffs left, so if everybody\u2019s still getting along here\u2019s hoping we get \u201914\u2032 or whatever it\u2019s called sooner rather than later.\n\n Originally posted in http://ultimateclassicrock.com/ \n",
        "\nThe time has finally arrived. Black Sabbath is back with Ozzy and writing new material. Of course, drummer Bill Ward does not make an appearance, but that\u2019s OK. Brad Wilk of Rage Against the Machine fame does an excellent job filling in on the drum throne. You may be aware that you are not listening to Bill Ward, but it is (for the most part) clear that you are listening to a Sabbath album. The energy is usually high, Iommi\u2019s riffs are metal, and his solos are, as can only be expected, fucking amazing. Geezer Butler has a very powerful presence on the bass and adds to the intensity during Iommi\u2019s solos. This is a band that, after decades without Ozzy, and even with a new drummer, stands strong with its new material and original lead singer. Welcome home, Ozzy! Now, there has been some skepticism about this album. First of all, there was some concern over the sound. Would this just be another Ozzy album, would it be a rehashing of the same old sound from Sabbath\u2019s glory days but with half the heart (these guys are in their sixties), or would it be a completely unrecognizable mess? For the most part, none of these fears came to pass. Yes, some songs do sound like Ozzy tunes at first, and I will address that momentarily, but overall, this is a Black Sabbath album that provides some very familiar elements while offering some newer fare that is quite refreshing and works well with the old Sabbath sound. \n\nDid I mention that Iommi sounds great? His solo on the song \u201cDamaged Soul\u201d says it all. His solos provide that great seventies soul we all remember while matching the darker/heavier tones provided for the modern age. Surprisingly, these two opposing sounds work together very well. There is that familiar Sabbath tone and a newer, heavier metallic presence keeping the music fresh rather than old and rehashed. Other fine examples are \u201cAge of Reason\u201d and \u201cDear Father.\u201d These songs have a very heavy rhythm caused by Iommi and Butler taking the tone and distortion to a place lower than on previous albums. Even Butler\u2019s work on Ozzy\u2019s \u201cOzmosis\u201d does not reach the level of heaviness found on Sabbath\u2019s 13, and they pull it off nicely. This does not sound like a group of old timers trying to fit in with the new sound. It sounds like seasoned veterans embracing the new and making it their own, which is fitting considering Sabbath\u2019s very wide range of influence over the decades.\n\nThe most familiar sounding track on this album is \u201cZeitgeist.\u201d This song sounds a lot like \u201cPlanet Caravan\u201d and may have even been written as a follow up. The tone is similar, the tempo is slow, and even the drumming is similar with Brad Wilk on hand drums through most of the song. Ozzy sings with that same reflective echo effect but with much greater clarity. Even Iommi\u2019s solo at the coda sounds very similar to his coda solo on \u201cPlanet Caravan.\u201d Interestingly, this is not a negative aspect of the album or song. The familiarity is a welcome addition, and the quality of song writing is excellent. Again, this sounds like a follow up song, not a rewriting. It is also the only slow track on the album, which makes it unique in the lineup between the heavier \"Loner\" and \"Age of Reason.\"\n\nMy one complaint about this album comes in the form of two songs, \u201cEnd of the Beginning\u201d and \u201cGod is Dead?\u201d In fact, my complaint is about the same style in which these two songs were written. For each, the first two thirds sound just like traditional Ozzy songs rather than Black Sabbath. \u201cEnd of the Beginning,\u201d wich starts the album, sounds disjointed at first. Ozzy\u2019s lyrics are very elementary (more so than his usual style), and Iommi and Butler don\u2019t seem to have found a connection with one another. The melody is too tight with little soul, which is a terrible way to begin any Black Sabbath album. On \u201cGod is Dead?\u201d the melod and tones are so similar to Ozzy's solo work that I kept expecting Zakk Wylde\u2019s pinch harmonics to make a presence. Thankfully, they don\u2019t. Fortunately, both songs pick up momentum and end very much in Sabbath fashion: with intensity, soul, and outstanding riffing. These are the only two songs that begin this way, indicating that they may have been the first two written and/or recorded. The rest of the album feels much more consistent both in writing and sound and does not delve any further into that realm of Ozzy\u2019s solo sound, which would be extremely disappointing.\n\nOne last point I would like to discuss is the bonus disc. Personally, I feel that the three extra songs should have just been put on the album. They are excellent and only continue the flow provided with the original eight tracks. One particularly interesting song is \u201cMethademic,\u201d an acoustic track that infuses metal acoustic and heavy distortion. I was honestly not expecting this on a Black Sabbath album and found it a very welcome addition. It begins with a slow but deep acoustic solo riff followed by a very heavy and pounding entrance by the rest of the band. From there, the song remains electric, fast, and heavy. \u201cPeace of Mind\u201d and \u201cPariah\u201d are also good additions but do not have that same unique writing as \u201cMethademic.\u201d Due to their heaviness, these three songs come the closest to being Ozzy songs, but Iommi and Butler maintain a strong writing presence that keeps the songs in the Black Sabbath realm. Great songs all around!\n\nMore than anything, 13 is a return. It is a return of original Black Sabbath members (minus Bill Ward) to the recording studio. It is a return to that old familiar Sabbath sound of heavy metal and soulful blues. It is also a new beginning. Brad Wilk\u2019s presence on the drums is an interesting and fitting addition to the lineup. Iommi and Butler\u2019s expanding on their metal sound while maintaining familiar textures provides a fresh sound with a welcome touch of sentiment. For those who are not familiar with Black Sabbath, this is a pretty good start, but do refer to their first several albums. For those who already know and love Sabbath, this is an outstanding piece of work.\n",
        "\nIt\u2019s kind of like the now infamous Ozzy salvo right at the start of the album - 'Is this the end of the beginning? Or the beginning of the end?' As the run up to the recording and release of the album indicate - the end has already and quite surely begun. But rather than being swift and merciful \u2013 its proved to be one steep, horrifying descent. Even the delivery is a prelude of things to come. You could almost picture Ozzy reading this off a lyric sheet, looking slightly sideways at Rick Rubin and the rest of the band (if they cared to show up) and almost saying 'Is this how I should do it? Is this right?'. That's the level of engagement you get on this album. The distance between the band as composers and the songs they have written \u2013 the epitome of artificiality if there ever was one. The riff, in the meantime is a port of 'the' Black Sabbath - if by a variation you would mean a 3rd tier knock-off sapped of all the energy, atmosphere and ingenuity that made the original work. The kind a garage stoner band would play to emulate a storied band back then known as\u2026Black Sabbath. \n\nSo that's all the album really is. It\u2019s the sound of a great band becoming their own tribute act, a completely unhilarious caricature of themselves. It\u2019s the mark of aged old men increasingly threatened by the prospect of irrelevance and penury taking a legacy without any known parallel and tearing it to pieces. The issue isn\u2019t that they aren't breaking new ground, like many say they should. Clearly, they don't NEED that to be any good. They're retreading old ground, and sacred ground at that. Pillaging the ashen remains of their history for their own shallow egos. But this might not be problematic for some. Some might say that it isn't wrong for Sabbath to plagiarise their own works. To take a riff, throw out a few bars. Or take a melody, transpose it to a different key. Put it all together and call it a song. After all classic band X and Y have been doing the same thing and never failed their troglodyte fanbase for years now. But then again, these people are dead wrong. The point is Sabbath is nothing like any of those bands and never will be. They were never the darling of classic rock magazines, never among the group of 'oldies'. Even if the same hare-brained critics and award shows that tore them down back in the day would in hindsight very much proclaim a heraldry of them these days. Remember that when you see \u2018Iron Man\u2019 or \u2018Paranoid\u2019 on Classic Rock Vol 1. Through several lineups and changing times, Black Sabbath have never been the kind of band that uses their history as a crutch to compensate for shoddy, derivative work \u2013 due mostly to the persistence of one Tony Iommi, who seems so incredibly estranged from his signature style here that he has to rehash previous works like never before to retain any semblance of it. \n\nThe stuff Sabbath played even at their most pandering and commercial was hardly the sort of material for mainstream or critical adoration. They were an oddity, more than anything. They weren\u2019t by any means pretty. They had a singer that could barely sing but sounded just right. A guitarist who'd lost a few of his fingers but could still teach the likes of Ritchie Blackmore a lesson in the power of riffs as opposed to showmanship. A bassist and drummer who could truly swing, in the best sense of the term - they were TIGHT before it even existed. Adversity and risk created this band and made it what it is. When this same band takes the easy way out and plagiarises their works as if they were say, AC/DC. It truly doesn't work. Because 'Black Sabbath' never was pub rock. It wasn't something you'd raise your glass to 'cause you like the groove. It was something that hit you and hit you hard. Something that left with much much more than an immediate impact restricted to \u2018catchiness\u2019 or image. And when you go about striving consciously to produce equivalents of those seminal pieces, something the band wouldn\u2019t stop to even in their heyday \u2013 its effect is summed up in the word itself. Equivalent. Neutered. Music of this kind was never meant to be replicated. This band was never meant to be dumbed down into a jukebox playing regurgitated \u2018hits\u2019 and reminiscing about the glory days, as most classic rock clusterfucks and revivals tend to be. And certainly not with the tech-savvy, irritating shenanigans of one Rick Rubin for a backdrop. How he managed to screw up this up \u2013 I can hardly tell. This is a group of musicians that sound so immediate and lively - you could probably catch them on an 8 track recorder and be amazed. \n\nWhat then could be redeeming about the album? Well as much wrong as it does for their legacy, it still does get some right done in the present. Though, to be frank - this has been done better prior by Sabbath themselves and a whole ton of bands descended from them. You could play spot the riff all over of course, whether it\u2019s the 'Hole in the Sky' reprise in 'God Is Dead?' or 'N.I.B.' in 'Loner'. The template is very much borrowed. But that aside, when your source material is as strong as this \u2013 you really can\u2019t go too wrong. 'Loner' still does rock a fair bit. The 'Planet Caravan' homage in Zeitgeist also sounds great - and could have been that much better with a more expansive production. The latter half of the album sees the band trying to come up with something more original and herein lie occasional flashes of brilliance. 'Age of Reason' for one is a song that would've sounded absolutely fabulous with Ronnie James Dio at the helm and features very classic Iommi riffs and leads, aesthetically more like the Dio-era than anything prior. 'Damaged Soul' really grooves, and has a great bluesy bridge (with harmonica) - sounding almost like something off 'Sabbath Bloody Sabbath'. Geezer shines particularly on this one, and while he stays consistently good for the entire duration of the album \u2013 one can\u2019t help but think that this could have been much better served if the core material was framed with just as much ingenuity. I did find the closer 'Dear Father' straining, clunky and overlong. Though most of the songs here seem to compensating for real content with reinforced song lengths. I know Ozzy has plenty of issues to deal with, but the next time - atleast throw it over a monster riff, or something barely memorable. Do something, damnit. In an almost tragically self deprecating way, the album \u2018ends\u2019 with the fading sound of a tolling bell and rainfall that marked the \u2018beginning\u2019 of their debut. \n\nSo what exactly could have made this much much better? And if the band is really quite as bereft of ideas and verve as they sound here, injected some much needed life into this? Among the more glaring omissions. Aside from the stillbirth that is the production - which makes terms like \u2018overproduced\u2019 and \u2018sterile\u2019 seem almost laudatory - is the drumming. Now hiring Brad Wilk seems very much like straining for some appeal with the newer crowd. A Sharon Osbourne decision, if there ever was one. His drumming defies all cliches, in that it sticks so closely and unprecedentedly to them that it\u2019s hard to even call it a cliche. Its effect is simply that of a festering sore. This, when you could have possibly got the able and excellent Vinny Appice on board? Well I guess he knew better than to have anything to do with this stinker anyway. Now, the vocals. Ozzy could never really sing anyway. Even in his prime, he was two notes short of being effectively mute - but he made up for all of it with plenty of bat-shit craziness. Sadly and rather predictably, none of that resurfaces here. Thankfully, the music is rather low-key and doesn't have him strain much. And I guess I've acquired some immunity to his penchant soul-sucking babble - dwindling it down to a mere rather than an active annoyance now. His vocals also evince a ton of studio tinkering, though that does very little to save it. But one can only wonder what could've been if the band had the artistic integrity to bring in Tony Martin, Glen Hughes or for that matter- Ian Gillian? That WhoCares single showed SUCH promise. Now an entire album of that would be a truly worthy return. Oh well. \n\nIn conclusion, I can't tell if this is a cash grab. It would be highly unbecoming of the band to cave in at this stage of their careers (though there was that previous reunion\u2026) yet the signs are all there. The entire band did gang up and collectively screw over Bill Ward. That's for sure. Ozzy, in rather poetic irony, alleged senility as the sole cause for Bill\u2019s dismissal. And Iommi even stooped so low as to use his cancer as a somewhat justification for the low blow claiming that 'he couldn't wait' and 'had to do this'. You'd only think he had a masterwork in the wait with such a sense of urgency. And while The Devil You Know raised the bar ridiculously high - showing much younger bands how hard the Gods could rock, all this does is evoke pity. Which is really not a good road for Sabbath to go down. It seems highly unlikely from this that there is retribution for this band. I guess, they're willing to try. And they may prove me wrong, yet. But I won't be waiting. Not too far back, Tony Iommi was a high watermark in the metal genre. One that never did fade and held its own stolidly through all the tumult and glory of this band. But perhaps it\u2019s only good for the metal scene to let go of its exalted heroes and move on - as painful and unbelievable as it seems. And will continue to seem as desperate fans strain and bandy about collective praise for this hack job. Only time will tell where things go from here. Won\u2019t stop them from touring and milking the shit out of this for the next few years I guess.\n",
        "\nCast your fears, doubts and worries aside. The godfathers are back and not to disappoint. The mood of this album is classic Sabbath, the feel of this album is classic Sabbath, I had initial worries due to the lack of Bill Ward and the release of 'God Is Dead?' as a single (which I thought was a good song but nothing exceptional), but those original worries have been blown away by an icy cold breeze from the lords of doom.\n\nThe album crawls to life with 'End of the Beginning', which takes a while to come to life and gets you initially worried, you begin to wonder if this whole album is going to just ooze along like a slug in treacle and take you nowhere special. Then Iommi bursts to life with a solo and the song picks up - a faint hope. Out of the dark left behind by 'End of the Beginning' is the single 'God is Dead', a song yet again displaying the dark sabbathy gloom we have grown to love and expect, with ocassional glimpses of what these 60 year olds are still very much capable of.\n\nLoner is the next track and much more of a 'hard rocker' with surprisingly blunt lyrics and a catchy riff telling the sad story of a 'loner' ending with the lyrics ''The secrets of his past live deep inside his head, I wonder if he will be happy when he's dead''. The mention of a riff brings me nicely onto my next point. Tony Iommi. He leads the way in this album combining catchy blues with heavy down-tuned riffs that would turn any party into a funeral march. Then just when you think you're going to be sucked into a black hole the spacey 'Zeitgeist' is there to take you aboard it's spaceship and carry you away. Zeitgeist is one that grows on you with every single listen and has a very 'stoner' element to it, much like the classic 'Planet Caravan'. It can make 4 minutes feel like a lifetime, and a lifetime feel like 4 minutes at the same time.\n\nThe next four tracks are 'Age of Reason', 'Live Forever', 'Damaged Soul' and finally 'Dear Father'. Now I don't want to dwell too long on 'Damaged Soul' and 'Age of Reason' not because they're bad, but due to just how good 'Live Forever' and the exceptional 'Dear Father' are. 'Age of Reason' is an excellent track that brings the album back down to earth talking of a 'shattered world that's gonna die', and features more classic yet refreshing Iommi riffs and another vocally strong performance from Ozzy. 'Damaged Soul' is very doomy-bluesy track that lulls you ever closer to your inevitable death bed mainly thanks once again to Iommi.\n\nWedged between 'Age of Reason' and 'Damaged Soul' is 'Live Forever'. This bursts to life in flames of catchy, rifftastic, heavy as hell and strangely epic combinations of everything metal. With simplistic lyrics of 'Well I don't want to live forever, but I don't want to die' you'll be dragged into the torn world of Ozzy - and you won't want to leave. Finally the album ends with 'Dear Father', a dark twisted story that will have you cowering in fear and feeling a very expressable disgust at very obvious figure head. This song is a mixture of faster paced versus' and guitar work by iommi followed by a slower harrowing chorus as if sung by the devil himself at the offenders. There are inexpressable by text changes in pace, mood and power in this song that I cannot match with mere words. Simply listen and enjoy...and enjoy the last 30 seconds.\n\nAlso going to include a notable mention to the bonus tracks, all of which could hold up in an album from any other band, especially 'Methademic' which could arguably earn a place as a main track on this album. After all it wouldn't be Sabbath wihout a track dedicated to a drug, would it? Fast paced, creepy and drug inspired - great song. Don't miss out on the catchy 'Peace of Mind' and lyrically astute 'Pariah' either!...Yet to hear 'Na\u00efvet\u00e9 in Black' but I'm sure it won't disappoint.\n\nTo summarise: It's Black Sabbath showing the rest how it's done, now bow to their feet. 95%.\n\nHighlights: Toni Iommi's creativity straight from the abyss. 'Zeitgeist', 'Live Forever', 'Dear Father', 'Damaged Soul'...the whole bloody thing!\n",
        "\nRevisiting the past is among the more commonplace things that any person does in their daily lives, it's all wrapped up in having a functional memory. Any band, at any given moment during the creative process of making an album, is always considering some past effort either courtesy of themselves or someone else. It is thus important to state emphatically that any problem with the long awaited full length Sabbath album with Ozzy back in the captain's chair is not that it looks to the past, or even that it dwells upon it to an obnoxiously obvious extent (and it does). No effort really lives or dies by \"what\" is being attempted (barring something that is completely incomprehensible like Metallica's disastrous collaboration with Lou Reed), but rather in \"how\" this come about. The devil is always in the details, as the old clich\u00e9 goes, and while the sadly defunct Heaven And Hell project succeeded masterfully in sticking to the devil they already knew, the same can not be said insofar as \"13\" is concerned.\n\nTo dispense with the obvious, this album is about as overt of a stylistic throwback as has ever been encountered, even by the standards of the likes of Count Raven, who've been attempting to capture the magic of Ozzy era Sabbath and translate it into a newer and more stylized doom metal medium. Frequent occurrences of near self-plagiarism abound, with a particular emphasis on the band's first two albums, though some traces of their mid 70s progression up to \"Sabotage\" come about at times, most notably during the latter part of \"Age Of Reason\" where a heavy keyboard presence paints a chord progression that all but anticipates the eventual NWOBHM just as said album did in 1975. But it isn't merely blatant references to slightly modified riffs or ideas from Sabbath's best known songs and albums, but also in the free-flowing, jam band character that was a continual staple of this band's sound for the entire 1970s. In both a micro and a macro sense, this is an all out attempt at a 1970s revivalist album.\n\nTo break with a growing consensus of detractors of this tragically flawed comeback, what is ultimately wrong with this album does not reside in the original membership to any large extent. Iommi's riffs, while blatant variations on past efforts (be it the \"N.I.B.\" homage in \"Loner\" or the obvious \"Planet Caravan\" tribute \"Zeitgeist\"), are catchy and well-realized. Ozzy's vocals, while extremely limited in range and processed to the point of sounding way too clean, are sufficient and even strong at times. And the strongest link in this rusty chain proves to be Geezer, whose bass lines are a bit restrained by the standards of his brilliant work on \"Paranoid\", stand out nicely and keep the arrangement mildly animated despite the largely slower tempos in play. Even Iommi's solos, which have reverted back to outright blues rock orthodoxy, are organized nicely and tell a solid musical story (his lead work on \"Damaged Soul\" is particularly impressive).\n\nThere are two primary factors that drag this album down and make it an equally mediocre effort (though for different reasons) to that of Ozzy's last weak farewell album \"Never Say Die\", and their names are Rick Rubin and Brad Wilk. The whole of Wilk's work before being tapped for this project has been an exercise in dryness and simply showing up and keeping the beat. His mundane and orthodox drumming can be likened to a plate full of toasted bread, filling up one's stomach but having no flavor or intrigue to speak of, making one wonder why they didn't just use a drum machine, which would have fit in well with Rick Rubin's production practices. And that's just the issue with the former party in this album's downfall, Rick Rubin is about as artificial in his approach as a basket of plastic fruit. Everything is so overly balanced, bereft of any organic feel or punch that one will find himself on his knees, begging for the instrument tracks to bleed together for just 3 lousy seconds. The guitar distortion on here literally sounds like it was produced by a keyboard, and the drums struggle to really have any depth, though they are mercifully less loud and overbearing compared to \"Death Magnetic\".\n\nAlthough it is a rarity that relatively decent songwriting is completely sabotaged by a lackluster production, it has been perfectly accomplished here. It presents an awkward paradox between classicism and modernity that results in a fairly elaborate album coming off as completely stale and contrived. Writing the same basic album(s) doesn't necessarily lead to this sort of situation (as anyone who listens to AC/DC can testify to), but it leaves things exposed if it isn't done to its fullest consistency. Nevertheless, this kind of an album is sure to sell fairly well for the same reasons that the new Swedish 70s retro phenomenon Ghost has been making waves, because gimmicks can stand in the place of just about anything else, and there may be no greater draw for hipsters than Black Sabbath going back to their roots while having the producer trying to outdo Bob Rock. But for those who want a quality listening experience are encouraged to refer to the last offerings of this outfit with RJD at the helm, both as Heaven And Hell and the brief stint under the Sabbath name for the new material heard on \"The Dio Years\". Hopefully this will be the last time that Rick Rubin has anything to do with Black Sabbath, even if it means this is the last LP to come out bearing their insignia.\n",
        "\nAnd so the day arrived. After all the legal drama, Heaven and Hell - all things said against Ozzy - and Dio's passing, Iommi, Butler and Osbourne reunited to release a sort of final statement to finish their history as Black Sabbath/Ozzy fronted version of the band. \n\nAs a brief introduction that will serve as comparison and explanation of the following points, I think Heaven and Hell was a band that was doing very, VERY WELL. Dio's fronted version of Sabbath (as they said plenty of times) released a monolithic and crushing album in the name of The Devil You Know. It was a very simple premise: to make honest metal which every member was enjoying on doing so. The songs were fresh, but had the classic Iommi riffage, the production was perfect and the performance was stellar. So, what am I doing talking about this? 13 is the opposite of that and it's why the album is so bad I'm my opinion. Being honest, this had a bad feeling from the very beginning.\n\nAs a sort of disclaimer, I feel the need to add that I don't hate Ozzy and the band at all. On the contrary, I had plenty of faith and good expectations, especially in Iommi, given the great work he did with H&H. Geezer has always been an excellent bassist and his basslines are made for Iommi's riffs to shine. Wilk is indifferent to me; I think any decent drummer could have made a decent job, since the music would be fairly slow and the strings have been always the highlight in Sabbath, especially the Ozzy albums.\n\nThe album starts with 'The End of the Beginning' and the first chords tells you it's Iommi doing his thing. Sadly, those riffs are only a slightly faster version of the riffs presented on the S/T album (the S/T track specifically). Ok, for Tony to come up with new riffs over decades must be quite the challenge, but this is ridiculous. When you listen the whole track and then the whole album something becomes very apparent: Sabbath used as templates some of their most famous songs ever and it shows. It's too evident how much they tried to replicate their old sound and style that hurts.\n\nFor me, Sabbath was always about innovation and playing whatever they wanted. Iommi released Technical Ecstasy and he didn't give a fuck about fans' opinion; it was what he wanted to do and he just did it. When Ozzy left, Iommi got into more NWOBHM and Dio's debut with the band shows it, successfully changing the band's style and revitalizing it instead repeating himself.\n\nNow, for the first time, we witness the riffmaster following orders and looking back to find inspiration. It's not a secret that Rubin (the producer) made the guys to listen the first album and 'suggested' to make a follow-up to that legendary effort, Today. I'm now sure why, but Tony was agreed and decided to write songs that sounded old, tweaking old riffs and ideas. You can clearly hear bits, sections and structures of songs like N.I.B., Black Sabbath, Planet Caravan, for naming some, so it's the very nature of the album is what really makes this almost unlistenable. It simply hurts too much to see this level of self plagiarism from the guys who invented metal. The jammed feeling of the old albums IS NOT PRESENT HERE and when they try to sound like rocking, it sounds forced. Everything is calculated; every section is placed where it is for a logical reason: to create a superficial feeling of nostalgia, a throwback feel that makes people appreciate the album not for what it is, but for what you're reminded of while listening to 13. Just look in Youtube for live clips of the new songs and the old ones, the similarities are too many to not be ashamed of.\n\nSongwriting aside, the album suffers from a number of reasons to weep over. The production is very crisp, compressed, clinically clean to the point of getting sterile. So, if they tried to record an album with a 70's vibe, why not aiming for a more dynamic and analog production? the drums sounds like any modern metal album which use Superior 2.0 or Addictive Drums. The guitar tone sounds saturated and at the same time unnecessarily clean and plastic for Sabbath; the lead guitar tone is especially grating, it's almost like a screeching cat. The bass is what I think sounds the best here, no complaints on that matter.\n\nI also need to talk in a separate paragraph about the vocals. Ozzy has never been a great or a merely good singer. He always had a restricted range and mostly followed the riffs. When you had great riffs, great songwriting, Ozzy was just another instrument in the mix: he never grabbed the attention of the tracks cause the riffs were always the main thing about Sabbath. Now that we have a very below-average quality of songwriting, Ozzy's vocals get more attention and his weaknesses are crystal clear. So, the guy that 40 years ago wasn't good at singing, now he simply CAN'T sing. His range, which was already limited, now is reduced to 1 octave, at best. He really tried his best in God is Dead, I know. He and the production team managed to make him sound better than his solo albums, but even Robocop manages to sound more human than Ozzy in his own band. Now I think 13 it's the best he can sound today but that's not saying much. His vocal lines are tired, effortless (excepting parts of GID and 2 lines of Dear Father) and miserable like a grandpa who's forced to run for his life. It's not a gloomy or a creepy performance anymore, it's a pitiful display of a washed-up, ruined man who can't deliver anything worthwhile anymore.\n\nFrom the bonus tracks, Methademic comes as a stronger number than the entire album. Maybe it was a song he did when Dio was still out there, since I think it suits better to RJD than Ozzy anyway.\n\nSo, it's a shame that The Devil You Know wasn't released as a Sabbath album cause it was the last real honest musical endeavor Iommi and Co released at this day. 13 is a very disappointing way of ending a career for the godfathers of metal.\n",
        "\nWhen 13 came out, I was listening to it for the first time (with the exception of God is Dead?) and reading reviews on this site. And quite frankly I think a decent number of them are a little unfair. It seems a bit unreasonable for hardcore fans to expect a perfect return to form for a forty-year-old band with a lineup that has reunited for an album for the first time in over thirty years. Some pan the band's over-reliance on doom, others the hearkening back of past ideas, others of just plain old age. But wait a minute...how is this any different from The Devil You Know? Wasn't that a heavily doom-inspired album with two of the same members of this album? Wasn't it a little repetitive? And didn't fans like it and praise it as another Sabbath reunion? Yes to all of those, and yet just because 13 was a little late to the dance some hardcore fans are crucifying it. Just like the aforementioned Devil You Know, 13 is a tad repetitive with overwhelming doom but is absolutely by no means a bad or even average album. And it's a grower. First impressions aren't always everything, and 13 will probably take a few listens to truly appreciate the music.\n\nGuitarist and lone consistent member Tony Iommi has long been the riff-master of metal and brought us so many classics such as Iron Man, Paranoid, Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, and Symptom of the Universe. So one might be disappointed that he's not pulling any new tricks out his sleeve and instead focuses on overloaded heavy doom riffage. And as the album goes on, some of the riffs get a bit repetitive and less original and recycled. But considering he's the master of the metal riff, he makes even repetitive sound cool and fun. Even as I hope for something a little bit more varied in his riffs I just can't help but appreciate the dark heaviness. And his solos hearken back to his blues roots in early Sabbath, which is pretty awesome. Geezer Butler's bass lines are dirty but very defined and rather than just support the guitar (which is sometimes annoying in metal) he helps contribute to the wall of sound that they created in the early 70's. Rage Against the Machine's Brad Wilk steps in for Bill Ward on drums and, let's face it, there's only one Bill Ward. To expect him to fill his shoes or surpass him as a drummer is ridiculous. Keeping that in mind, his drumming is very solid and pounding and ultimately does its job. Probably one of the biggest issues fans are going to take with this album is Ozzy's voice. Ozzy has never been a technically gifted or singer. That's never been the case, and it certainly isn't the case now. But while Ozzy may not be as skilled as other Sabbath singers, he's always had that \"it factor\", that iconic impact with his voice. It's hard to explain, his voice has just always fit perfectly. And while his voice and range have declined due to age, drugs, and alcohol, he still does a solid job. It just fits.\n\nThe instrumentation is solid, and the lyrics by Butler are still superb. Song topics cover war, the question of religious faith, isolation, and travelling through space. Obviously recurring themes in Sabbath's music. And while there is no undeniable, classic standout track, there is nothing to shake a finger at either. While there is some occasional familiarity Sabbath throws in just enough riffing and breakdowns to keep a certain degree of freshness. The beginning section of opening track End of the Beginning is almost structurally identical to Black Sabbath. However, it speeds up rather than stay too doomy a little less than halfway through the song to avoid a complete recreation. In fact, the song's latter half is spectacular and is sure to bang heads, ultimately being one of the best on the album. Single God is Dead? follows a similar formula but has an absolute killer instrumental breakdown near the end. And while the dreamy Zeitgeist is basically a sequel or 21st century version of Planet Caravan, it's still a pretty cool concept and definitely changes things up. Loner is an upbeat bluesy sort of song and, like Zeitgeist, keeps things fresh during the doomfest. Live Forever accomplishes the same by combining both doom and upbeat metal but is arguably one of the weaker tracks. Age of Reason, Damaged Soul, and Dear Father all continue the epic doom trend of God is Dead? and End of the Beginning. Age of Reason is cool with an extended instrumental section while Damaged Soul carries a bluesy vibe similar to Loner and also features Ozzy on harmonica for the first time since The Wizard (which is pretty awesome). Dear Father follows in the same vein as the other doom tracks but surprisingly ends with sounds of rainfall and the same church bells as Black Sabbath. This very cool ending gives the album a full circle feeling, and perhaps hints that this will be the final album that Sabbath ever does.\n\nIf you buy the album, make sure you get the deluxe edition with four bonus songs (Naivete in Black is only available on the Japanese or Best Buy versions). Methademic and Naivete in Black (a reference to the common misconception of N.I.B. being an acronym for \"Nativity in Black\") are definitely the champions of these four. They are actually two of the best songs on the entire album (Naivete in Black in particular) and are the only fast-paced songs. Peace of Mind and Pariah are more mid-paced songs and while not fantastic, are still pretty good and are solid additions as bonus tracks.\n\nDid this album blow me away? Not necessarily. Is it a bit repetitive in areas? Yes. Is it still a great album for guys who have been in the game for over forty years and essentially created heavy metal? Absolutely. Don't expect Sabbath to redefine the genre they defined in the first place, but this is still a very strong and exceptional album. It seems like wishful thinking to expect this to be perfect, but 13 succeeds in being heavy, dark, and consistent. It might not leave a strong impression the first time around, but a couple of listens later and you have a damn fine album. Who knows if this is really the final chapter for Black Sabbath given the ending of Dear Father, but maybe that is the way it should be. As much as we would all love a full reunion with Bill Ward, maybe the masters of metal have nothing left to prove. Even if this is not the perfect album we were all hoping for, it is still a great one. They have given us decades of excellent music, and have finally reunited to give us even more. And that's all this Sabbath fan asks. \n\nBut in all honesty, I hope they keep it up. I think they proved they still have plenty of gas left in the tank.\n",
        "\nThis isn\u2019t the type of thing I want to be critical of, because even if I have some complaints on their earlier work, and sometimes wonder if I prefer Dio Sabbath, I truly do love the original Ozzy-era Sabbath, even if the last two albums were a little lackluster. But this reunion album might just be as uninspired as the incredibly bland title. The name 13 has no real significance, as it\u2019s their 19th album and their 9th with Ozzy. Only if you ignore all of their albums with Tony Martin, the album with Ian Gillan, and Seventh Star, and only count the Ozzy and Dio albums does this bear any resemblance to a 13th album. And it\u2019s been almost 20 years since they last put out an album. Obviously the name 13 is either just a gimmick, or a lame acknowledgement of its 2013 release. The title isn\u2019t bad, but it\u2019s meaningless and uninspired. Now excuse me why I tell you exactly why that\u2019s relevant.\n\nSomewhere along the line, someone mentioned to Tony Iommi that he was an innovator of the doom genre, and he must have figured that that was what made Black Sabbath good, because there\u2019s a lot of crushing riffs going on here, but clearly everyone forgot that what really made the band great were his riffs. I guess Tony thinks it\u2019s ok to beat us over the head with doomy power chords. Are we forgetting about such great riffs as Sabbra Cadabra, Paranoid, and Supernaut? There just isn\u2019t much that stands out like those riffs on this album. It\u2019s too busy being dark and having a downtuned, murky guitar tone. \n\nIt\u2019s not that it\u2019s entirely devoid of riffs, Loner is a pretty fun song, But I swear I\u2019m listening to Age of Reason for the 3rd time, and nothing really stands out except the part where Ozzy says \u201cToo many lies!\u201d (or whatever) and it sounds like Iommi borrows a bridge riff from Iron Man. Speaking of which, the album repeatedly borrows from past ideas.\n\nDidn\u2019t anyone honestly catch on that both End of the Beginning and God is Dead? both borrow very heavily from the song Black Sabbath? I love that song, don\u2019t get me wrong, but I didn\u2019t ask to hear it again, let alone twice more. Now, neither song is bad, but they both follow a formula pretty obviously set by Black Sabbath. God is Dead? basically has the tri tone, but with an open note struck before it so people won\u2019t bitch, End of the Beginning has a riff that isn\u2019t quite as similar, but isn\u2019t much of a thin veil of a rip off itself, and both turn into a rocker near the end much like Black Sabbath did. Honestly, I had to double check the first time that God is Dead? wasn\u2019t End of the Beginning played slower. And the throwbacks don\u2019t end there; Zeitgeist is essentially Planet Caravan, right down to the space lyrics, except it turns into a true acoustic song by the end.\n\nAnd if you give Live Forever some time to finish building itself up, I think it becomes the faster part of Hand of Doom, but less interesting. I don\u2019t know when he starts saying \u201cJust before you die\u201d just sing \u201cYour mind is full of pleasure/Your body's looking ill\u201d to yourself and see how you feel about it. The rest of the song doesn\u2019t really do anything significant.\n\nThe last two songs are sort of sort of sludge epics, Damaged Soul giving Iommi some time to jam on some solos but not being anything too special, in my opinion, and Dear Father being a surprising highlight, even though when it speeds up, it reminds me a lot of the quicker part of Into The Void, although I guess the whole song sort of harkens back to that song in some ways. And fittingly with all of my references to taking inspiration from their past works, the album ends the same way their first began; thunder rain and a church bell in the distance. \n\nAs far as the album as a whole, in my opinion the guitar tune was a little bit of a complaint. The tuning and distortion didn\u2019t really allow Iommi to shine as he did in the bands classic period, although I\u2019m not sure if he would anyway, considering the riffs on this album seem to pale in comparison anyway. It just felt so much like generic doom metal, which is not what I feel Black Sabbath should be offering me. I don\u2019t know why I dislike it so much, considering I enjoyed The Devil You Know, and I don\u2019t think his tone was much different on that album. He seems more bogged down on this. To be fair, maybe it was because I wanted something more similar to their traditional style with the original line up reunion. And yet, listening back, The Devil You Know still has plenty more moments where the band stops playing Doom metal and really starts rocking. There aren\u2019t any Eating the Cannibals or Neverwheres to be found here. And I guess that\u2019s fine, but if I can make a prediction, I feel like it makes for an album that will maybe be well received until the nostalgia wears off, and then be ultimately forgotten. \n\nOzzy\u2019s performance is pretty adequate. He\u2019s never been a great singer, and a lot of what used to make him unique is gone, but he\u2019s not entirely depressing, even if I think many of the songs would work better if he had more range. Again, he was never the best vocalist, but what ability he has lost over the years have made some impact, but I don\u2019t think anyone will be surprised when they hear it. \n\nOne thing I must compliment the album on is its lyrical explorations. Very interesting stuff from Geezer here, as the lyrics explore questioning one\u2019s own religious philosophies, the quandary of not wanting to die, and yet not wanting to live forever, and questioning if you\u2019d be better off dead. Is Geezer in need of some anti-depressants, because even if some of the ideas and lyrics aren\u2019t the most original, the fact that almost all of the songs on the album at least acknowledge these or similar feelings or thoughts\u2026 it\u2019s kind of heavy shit. \n\nMaybe this is a bunch of guys, guys I\u2019m not sure even actually get along anymore, trying to recapture their 70's sound with modern sound. Tony Iommi is under the impression that because he inspired doom metal he should actually play it, and because of this I felt the album had a lack of memorable riffs. Despite all the negatives I\u2019ve brought up, this is not bad, but it is average, and pretty blatantly derivative of their old material.\n\nI\u2019m sure many will disagree, but I felt this album was something of a disappointment. It\u2019s somewhat generic for Black Sabbath, and for veterans, they seem to rely on their past work for inspiration a little too much. Again, this is not a complete failure, and it probably is worth at least checking out. This is a historic line-up reformation, even if it is without Bill Ward. Unfortunately, it also probably won\u2019t blow you away either. It\u2019s decent work, and will probably make most fans content, but to me, it feels a little uninspired, and I doubt I\u2019ll think about it much once I start playing their older stuff in about five minutes, when I finish editing , revising and adding any final notes I have. And I guess that\u2019s fine. This is still alright. But should we settle on Black Sabbath being just \u2018alright\u2019\u2026?\n\nAddendum: \nI was pretty content with this review. I finished it and decided to base it on the album, and forget the bonus tracks, since even though I like to acknowledge them, I don\u2019t let them affect the score, since they aren\u2019t on all versions. I had, what I figured was a decent review, submitted, accepted, third in. Good stuff right? \n\nThen I got curious about the four bonus tracks. And after checking them out, I had to say something, because WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS SHIT?!\n\nNa\u00efvet\u00e9 in Black, despite my expecting some shitty version of N.I.B. that would be similar to Warpurgis, is the most elusive of the four bonus tracks. It\u2019s a fast paced rocker reminiscent of maybe T.V. Crimes or, more closely, Time Machine. It\u2019s downtuned and a little muddy still, but it\u2019s a good rocker that if puto n the album could alone have probably upped the score to 70%. Methademic has a slow acoustic intro that quickly builds into another decent rocker. Which begs the question, why the fuck did they make all these rockers, and then decide that they didn\u2019t want any of them on the fucking album? The verse features quick drumming and a sort of melodic chord strum rather than a real riff, but my god, some parts of these songs Iommi sounds not only like he almost cares, but actually somewhat aggressive. \n\nDon\u2019t get too thrilled, not all of the bonus tracks are good. There\u2019s always Peace of Mind, a sludgy sort of song that doesn\u2019t really go anywhere or do anything. It speeds up a bit in its latter half, but shit, so do half the songs on the album. I don\u2019t get why you\u2019re so damn hesitant to just punch us in the face with some rock. Give us a Paranoid or Symptom of the Universe. Pariah is a little more mid-paced, and there really isn\u2019t much to speak of here. But while these two songs are lacking, the bonus disc as a whole is probably better than the goddamnmotherfucking album. There is seriously more to remember here than the new fucking album. Sure, it\u2019s still a little derivative, but at least it isn\u2019t derivative AND boring. \n\nWho let Sabbath write these fast paced tracks and then told them, \u201cNo, the fans just want to hear you play a bunch of slow, doomy songs, better to just not put these on the album.\u201d BECAUSE PUTTING A FAST SONG ON THE ALBUM WOULD JUST BREAK MY FUCKING HEART. I can appreciate adding some decent bonus tracks to fans who want to pick up the deluxe edition, but this is borderline a \u2018fuck you\u2019 to anyone who didn\u2019t. Fuck you Black Sabbath. Fuck you Sharon, I\u2019m sure I can find a way to blame this on you, mostly since I\u2019m convinced Ozzy died years ago, and what we\u2019re seeing is literally a hollowed out marionette shell. I hope you get Iommi\u2019s cancer. Not that it somehow becomes contagious, but that it actually jumps from Iommi, leaving him cancer free, and embeds itself in your fucking brain and you die.\n\n\u2026That escalated quickly. In short, if you\u2019re gonna get it, put out the extra $5 for the deluxe edition, because it\u2019s much more enjoyable. Or fuck it, don\u2019t buy it. It\u2019s still not their best work, and do you want to buy an album that wants to rape a few extra bucks out of you just to rise above \u2018mediocre?\u2019\n",
        "\nIn what had to be one of the longest rollouts for an album's release in memory the so-called \"comeback\" LP by Black Sabbath featuring original 'singer' (using that term loosely) finally hits the street. Can't call it the \"original members\" because drummer Bill Ward opted out and apparently Vinny Appice wasn't even asked. 3/4 reunion, ok?\n\nOne's reaction to this album largely rests on three things: 1) How do you feel about Ozzy Osbourne 2) Did you want your favorite band to plagiarize itself? 3) How do you feel about Rick Rubin?\n\nThe first question is an unavoidable one. Osbourne has been a self parody for nearly 30 years, hitting an all-time low with his insipid reality show. In fairness I need to set aside any personal dislike I have for Ozzy the image and review his efforts on '13' on their own merits. Still, for a guy that became famous as a solo artist from two moderately decent albums and 90% image and myth I should be allowed to take a jab at the cottage industry of Oz. Anyway, on '13' he doesn't sound as awful as one would expect. Based on truly wretched live performances vocally on the band's current tour it's obvious producer Rick Rubin had Ozzy sing his lines incessantly until they rose to the level of mediocrity, which is the best you can get from a 60+ year old rock singer who always had a mediocre, albeit unique and fitting for certain material, voice. What I find hilarious is how the old guy gets praise for not sucking! That's Ozzy and the nature of fandom.\n\nRight from the opening \"End Of The Beginning\" Ozzy ee-nun-see-ates his verses with snail-paced phrasing. He makes an already eight minute song feel like an hour. Oh yeah six of the album's eight songs are unnecessarily long (more on that later). Quite simply these sound like guide vocals not the finished work. After two verses I found myself thinking. \"Man, if Ronnie James Dio was singing this could be killer\" because make no mistake about it- this is vintage style Sabbath doom 'metal' and prog rock. Iommi's riffage is unmistakable and his tone evokes the early 70s for the first time since the band's glory days. But that's part of the problem. It's been written many times that Rubin allegedly played the band's first four brilliant albums to the band and said they needed to sound like that again. Mission accomplished. This album drips with musical references and arrangements of the early days. It's so contrived you'd almost mistake it for a parody. Long songs, doomy tempos, provocative lyrics, etc. \n\nSpeaking of lyrics the album's boring first single, \"God Is Dead?\", is banal to the extreme. Think \"gloom/doom/tomb\" rhymes and you get the picture. Speaking of \"GID\" this is another in a series of songs that have no business being seven-plus minutes. Clocking in at nearly nine (!) minutes this interminable track takes about six minutes to get to the interesting bit where it switches to uptempo and we are greeted with a classic Iommi riff that continues for the duration. It swings mightily for those three minutes granted but those first six minutes gave me the same feeling I had when watching the Robin Williams movie \"Toys\". Crushing dullness. Most songs on this album fail to merit long running times. They're not interesting enough and it just gives too much space for Ozzy to drag the album down and drag it down he does.\n\nEven on the \"faster\" (barely) songs like \"Loner\" Ozzy inspires laughter with his trademark \"oh yeah!'s\" and \"come on now!\" fillers. At least \"Loner\", despite simplistic lyrics (sample \"He's just a loner/ He does things alone\"), rocks a little. Again Dio would have elevated this one ten stories. \n\nThe album does contain two exceptional songs. \"Zeitgeist\" with it's bongos, jazzy guitar lines and breezy slowness reminds me of the band's great \"Planet Caravan\". Immediately I had to go back and listen a second time to accept this album contained a genuinely good song. It does and even contains one approaching greatness. The bluesy \"Damaged Soul\" is the one time the band revisits it's roots and doesn't elicit cringes. The band simmers on this one. Ozzy doesn't venture out of his tiny comfort zone vocally while Iommi wrings every drop out of his guitar strings. There's even an Osbourne harmonica bit just like the old days. This one works because it feels like a loose jam session that Rubin let slip his fussy grips.\n\nThat brings us to the notorious Rick Rubin, king of compression and loudness behind the board. I don't claim to be an audio expert but there's just something sterile about his productions. Every instrument is crystal clear and all up in your ears. On this one Ozzy's vocals just sound so clinical. While listening I kept picturing Rubin saying to Ozzy: \"Alright Ozzy, let's do that line again and again and again and....\" because his singing seems almost programmed. That's the case of this whole album. It's so unashamedly contrived you just don't get lost in the music. Oddly, though, Iommi- the obvious hero on this LP- sounds great throughout the album. Geezer Butler's bass is mixed right too. The drums? Flat sounding and forgettable. It's like they told Brad Wilk \"Okay, just keep a beat and don't try to get cute buddy!\".\n\nBottom line: Ozzy fans will call this a masterpiece because it sounds like classic Sabbath and Ozzy can do no wrong. Fans who are now professional critics will rate it high because of their shock that it isn't as terrible as predicted. Those of us that like Black Sabbath but don't exactly consider Ozzy-related projects among our favorites won't be able to overlook the albums many flaws. I blame it on Ozzy first. Rubin second.\n",
        "\nSo Black Sabbath return for real with new material, with Ozzy on the microphone. Everyone is excited for the return of their heroes, and anticipation is high for the next album, Megadeth's Th1rt3en. No wait, sorry, Black Sabbath's 13. Yes, this is a super exciting time. But no, 'God is Dead?' isn't the super exciting release everyone hoped for.\n\nAt this point, with the thousands of Sabbath imitations out there and the general evolution of metal since the 70s, it is difficult for the band to sound exceptional any more. For instance, the run-of-the-mill clean guitar part during the verses could have been written by anyone. It wouldn't be under the spotlight if it were just a little more complex and less 'DARK!!'. Of course, this leaves the door open for Ozzy's unique vocals to elevate the track to the usual Sabbath standards. Given some fairly interesting lyrics, Ozzy just sounds tired. Even when the track intensifies, when things should go in to overdrive, Ozzy is stuck in the same octave, with an almost identical lyrical pattern, with only 'God is Dead!' to punctuate the monotony. The song is just under 9 minutes, and does nothing to justify such length. I suspect had the song been cut by two or three minutes so that the energetic last section starts in the middle rather than towards the end, the reaction would have been a lot better, and this rating would be higher. Unfortunately, each play of 'God is Dead?' leaves the listener wondering why they haven't just put on four Slayer songs instead, or why they aren't playing 'A National Acrobat' and doing 2 and a half minutes of exercise when it is finished.\n\nNew listeners probably won't understand what the fuss is about. They'll wonder who these old farts are and why it is such a big deal for them to be making a comeback. In the case of 'God is Dead?', can you blame them? I can't. The upside is that the new CSI-premiered track sounds like something not to fake getting excited about. Let's hope the album rocks too!\n",
        "\nI've long been an advocate of the non-mentioned, non-Ozzy Sabbath albums. Mob Rules, Heaven and Hell (to a lesser extent), Eternal Idol and in particular Headless Cross get the same attention that an orphan from China gets from non-celebrity parents. Even on my own blog I've been adamant about the lack of attention given these releases dating back to 2009 when I did a quick article reviewing several albums rather briefly including Black Sabbath's Headless Cross and as recently as a couple weeks ago upon Sabbath's release of the abhorrent God is Dead? music video starring the vocally impotent Ozzy Osbourne. I digress however as I'm not interested in proving how terrible Ozzy is in comparison to every vocalist Sabbath has had since and prior. Rather, Headless Cross deserves mention and awareness because of a slough of great songs, great performances and to hopefully cut through the plague of individuals out there that attempt to sully the work Sabbath did after Ozzy's dismissal and after the impeccable vocal marksmanship of Ronnie James Dio on Heaven and Hell and Mob Rules.\n\nI originally owned the CD Version of Headless Cross which I neglected in my youth. I traded it away for a copy of The Puritan's Lithium Gates. Doom for doom at least but I lost out on three of the greatest Sabbath (Headless Cross, Devil and Daughter and When Death Calls) tracks in favor of one immense extreme Dooooom track (It Is Your Own Decision To Respect Life). I picked up a copy of the album vinyl as soon as possible to overcome this self-imposed wrongdoing. While both albums retain minimal artwork, I must admit, the cover to Headless Cross is one of the most immediate and definite representations of Doom and of Heavy Metal which has ever been inked onto a one square foot record sleeve. The ominous cemetarial cross harkens the subject matter within, the black and white colorless manifest to this day is reminiscent of so many of the albums covers employed throughout metal, especially within the underground and the backside of the album, featuring the broken cross headstone, symbolizes the heavy metal stance - agreed upon by so many - of an anti-religion, anti-establishment credo which has become ingrained in the minds and imagery of the genre. But looking closer there are subtleties. There is no image of the musicians or mention of them on the outside of the release. The Black Sabbath moniker appears small on the cover and the album title appears only on the reverse. The emphasis is on the Cross and the hidden moon, small in an ebony sky behind cimmerian clouds. \n\nEverything here is precisely effectual starting from the ominous introductory piece \"The Gates of Hell,\" straight through the final track, \"Nightwing.\" There is a definitive 80's production here which is not to be supplanted but it's one of the album's strengths. The atmosphere created by Geoff Nicholls' keyboards at pivotal moments through tracks like \"Call of the Wild\" maintain that horror-like motif of 70's films. Those that claim the album is an 80's glam album need look no further than the lyrics which are morbid and demonic. If anything, what could be perceived as an attempt towards 80's accessibility could actually be deemed a clever and devilish propaganda trick. Ignorant vagrants looking for an album to enjoy could be seized unwittingly and thrust into the darkest and deepest throes of the Devil's malice. It happened to Brian May of Queen fame -he appears on the album's most powerful and emotive track, \"When Death Calls,\" - at the behest of Satan and even the acoustic moments of album draw thee in. I've been lost for a long time. \n\nThe four best tracks are the irreplaceable title track which, with it's steady drum beat and iconic clear yet muffed guitar tone, lead the way through a story which - at least after listening to this album so many times - I could imagine no one else narrating other than Tony Martin. One of the least talked about aspects of this album is Laurence Cottle who direct and particularly syncopated style comes across well on this album. His bass lines are notably driven on the album and while he rarely does anything of particular technical prowess, without the momentum of his bass lines, songs like \"Devil and Daughter\" would be nothing but a collection of well intentioned riffs over a metronome-like Cozy Powell. He pulls the rhythm section from beyond and ties it to the surface with one big subtle knot noticeable only after direct contact for long periods of time such as I have been known to enjoy with this album. Ultimately the three best tracks are the A-sides on this album though and after the title track, \"Devil And Daughter\" is fun and naughty, pleasurable and painful. Memorable to infinite ends. \"When Death Calls\" ends the A side with a menacing, discomforting and powerful. When Death Calls... There's no tomorrow. For me, when Martin proclaims \"For I Believe, Satan lives in the souls of the dying,\" I get shivers at easy it is to hear that on a record and know that line would freak 90% of the world out. Awesome riffs and Brian May's lead is one of the best ever put on a record. \n\nThe B-sides are less engaging. \"Kill in the Spirit World,\" while momentarily strong during the choruses and pre-solo instrumental sections reverts constantly to an unfittingly optimistic verse. The solo is excellent but that verse... \"Call of the Wild,\" also suffers from a similar fate though less pronounced as that encouraging vibe is dashed after the intro for the most part. Another notable lead. Recognize the pattern here? \"Black Moon,\" is notable for it's stop start main riff and strong finale of leads and big chords complementing Tony Martin's croons. \"Nightwing,\" starts with some killer fretless bass work, acoustics and keys before following a similar structure as \"When Death Calls,\" with the heavy emphasis on the refrains. While a strong track, the A-sides are just so good they make the B-sides seem less than they probably really are. Great album through and through even with some small flaws on the follow through side. It's hard to find an album with no flaws though, and I'm not one to ignore them to prop up a previously acknowledged opinion on what Sabbath's best era is. I think the music itself backs that up and it sure as hell came after 1979.\n\nOriginally written for Contaminated Tones\n",
        "\nThere has been talks of a reunion of the classic Black Sabbath line up for what feels like forever, and I must admit I felt skeptical that it would ever happen. In a way it hasn't, because Brad Wilks of Rage Against The Machine and Audioslave fame has replaced Bill Ward as the skinsman. However, although the omission of Ward is unfortunate, this still is effectively a classic Black Sabbath reunion. I have to admit that because of Ozzy's solo work I was a bit worried that this could possibly turn out to be something that could be damaging to their legacy (some would argue that they already did this with the final two albums of their classic era, but they effectively recovered with Dio). The first offering from their upcoming albums is the Nietzsche inspired single \"God Is Dead?\". \n\nI was never expecting a perfect return to the glory of their early albums. Those album represented a particular moment in time; one where everything they were doing was new territory. While this certainly isn't as good as the classic days, it certainly is no fuck up. The production isn't as raw as it was in the 70s, but I kind of expected this would be the case. Thankfully it is not polished to the point where it starts taking away from the music. Ozzy's voice is less nasally than it was on the old material and is, well, not as good. However, they could be so much worse. I saw him live recently, and although it was most definitely a good time, the vocals seemed to be wavering a bit. His vocals have been quite bad on recent albums, as well. I've heard that Rick Rubin really pushed Ozzy to do his best here, and the effort paid off. Again, they don't recapture the old glory days, but they are passable. My biggest criticism is that they do seem too overproduced, much more so than any of the instruments. The lyrics are pretty cool, except for the occasional flub such as \"Out of the gloom I rise up from my tomb into impending doom\". \n\nIf this track proves anything, it's that Iommi is still the fucking man. He is essentially responsible for the establishment of metal as a whole as well as the subgenre of doom metal, and he never really has lost his touch. Releasing a nearly nine minute long song was a ballsy move for the mostly reformed Sabbath lineup. However, this risk plays off. This gives the song time to grow naturally as well as time for the atmosphere to sink in. Iommi's guitar work is really what makes the track. From the more pensive tritones, to the more ass kicking riffing, it is readily apparent that the man still knows what the fuck he is doing. Although the lead guitar is very brief, goddamn does it deliver. It is a compromise between the more bluesy style employed when Ozzy was originally in the band and the more melodic style often used after his departure. It captures the best of both worlds. Geezer's bass hangs low, with a dominant tone, often deviating from the guitar. \n\nThe fact that the replacement for Ward is the man who played with Rage Against The Machine has been somewhat controversial in the metal scene. If you think they are a terrible band, I still don't get what would imply that the man is a bad drummer. Even if you don't like their sound, I can't see anything wrong with the drums on any Rage albums. Personally I really like the first RATM album, with the others being largely hit or miss and not retaining the anger and intensity of the self titled (I think a lot of this has to do with a pissed off fiercely anti-capitalist far-left band getting rich off the capitalist system they hate not really working). Anyway, Brad proves that he can get the job done. Although I would still rather Ward, who I especially love for his brief drum solos and his fills, I have absolutely no problem with the former RATM drummer behind the kit. \n\nThough the former glory of classic Black Sabbath can never truly be recaptured or replicated, I'm just glad they're back together making music that isn't lame. I could go comparing this to the old stuff all day, but in the end, despite not being as good, this is worth listening to in it's own right. Although the production and especially the vocals sounds more modern, the band still sound like Sabbath and I'd take this over Never Say Die! any day of the week. Time will tell what the rest of the album will bring us, but I am now much more confident that it will be a successful one.\n",
        "\nWow. Just wow. Upon hearing that a new Sabbath single had been released, I ran to listen at the earliest opportunity. And, well, I didn't like it. So I left it a few days, spoke it through with some friends who loved it, and went back to listen. And I still didn't like it. When one listens to Ozzy's vocals on Master of Reality and Vol. 4, we encounter a brilliant vocalist - full of energy and vocal range. When we listen to Heaven and Hell; to Paranoid; to Born Again, we are presented with the musical genius of Tony Iommi, whose simplistic riffs are the most catchy of any metal band and provides hours of pleasurable listening experience.\n\nSo what's with this?\n\nThe track relies on 3 or 4 main riffs: a slow acoustic one, that attempts to seem dark with use of the tritone and sadly fails; a use of one note repeated to build up before a chorus; an average chorus riff; and a brilliant solo build-up riff. The song is, as with most Sabbath stuff, based around pentatonic minor and blues scales, but here it just lacks any sort of punch. There's no really catchy riffs or beat, save perhaps the riff before the solo. The bass, which carries a similar tone to Steve Harris' [of Iron Maiden], plays a series of open 'twanged' strings throughout several of Iommi's riffs, which adds a dirty and annoying feel to the song. As if the riff wasn't boring enough already, they add dirty lo-fi bass to it. Blegh.\n\nOzzy's vocals are also disappointing. His vocal range is contained to one octave, and only varies by a few notes at a time. He seems tired whilst singing, and it's sad to listen to. He also seems way too high in the mix, because the song doesn't seem \"full\" to listen to. One can hear Ozzy prominently, but the riffs seem either too distant or too quiet. I can't quite put my finger on it. To add insult to injury, the lyrics themselves are rather boring. There's no other way of putting it.\n\nThe positives: Iommi's solo, and the riff that builds up to it. Based on the blues scale, we are treated to a glimpse of what this song could truly be. The drums blast around a series of blues scale descensions, after which Tony himself delivers a 4-bar solo that takes us back to early Sabbath. It's beautiful to hear, but it quickly returns to the boring riffs and Ozzy singing \"God is dead..?\" Oh, and speaking of drums, the drums here do what they must, essentially. They're not brilliant nor boring, they're just there.\n\n*Sigh* It's a shame. There was so much potential, and it seems to have been wasted. I pray that the new album is more upbeat, catchier and just more Sabbath than this one, or else it does truly demonstrate that the Prince of Darkness and Godfathers of Heavy Metal are finally getting too old for this.\n",
        "\n\"Heaven And Hell\" made a heck of splash in the metal community, for better or worse. There was (shit there probably still is) people out there who just won't accept the greatness Black Sabbath re-emerged with on their 1980 effort simply due to a cleaner sound and a new singer. It's too bad, because then that mean they would have missed out on the superior followup album, 1981's \"Mob Rules\". This album takes what was good about \"Heaven and Hell\" and makes it better. Sadly this album tends to remain trapped in the monolithic shadow of its predecessor and to this day still remains an underrated gem in Sabbath's entire discography. \n\nThe crew from \"Heaven And Hell\" returns with a vengeance, albeit with a new drummer on board. Bill Ward was totally unable to commit to his drum work at this point in time due to numerous problems in his personal life. His replacement is future longtime Dio cohort Vinny Appice, who's energetic double bass, fills and numerous lightning quick drum rolls are very much welcomed. Dio's vocals are still on fire, ever unstoppable and vigorous. But Tony Iommi and Geezer Butler still steal the show with their respective guitar and bass skills. Iommi's riffage and leads in particular I've always found more inspired and memorable on here than on \"Heaven and Hell\". Geezer is still Geezer, his bass always notable, present and strong.\n\nOne thing I want to mention is the production, which I forgot to mention in my review of the last album. Both were produced by Martin Birch, a respected producer who also worked with Deep Purple, Rainbow and Iron Maiden. His work is very, very good, all instruments get their dues and then some and Dio's vocals sound unbeatable. The whole thing has a clean, vibrant but at times appropriately dark feel.\n\nThe songs on \"Mob Rules\"...well...rule! I always found the numbers on here to be much consistent than on the previous album, not to mention far more memorable overall. This is potentially due to that the songs feel more upbeat in delivery and are a bit more streamlined than the more harrowing, lengthy structures of \"\"Heaven and Hell's\" tracks. We start with \"Turn Up The Night\", which clearly tries to recapture the speedy goodness of \"Neon Knights\" but fails to be as good as that particular song. Still, it's a fun one, complete with especially booming bass and patented Iommi shredding. The more mid-paced \"Voodoo\" follows; it's most comparable to a more melodic take on that kind of heavy metal Accept is best known for. The utterly fantastic \"Sign of the Southern Cross\" comes next. This is one of Sabbath's best songs EVER! THIS is what the title track of the last album should've been! A light acoustic intro gives way to meaty, immense as hell riffs and bass while Dio belts out lyrics weaving a tragic tale of religion's icy grasp; awesome song! Heck, I even like the instrumental followup \"E5150\"; it's pretty creepy and surprisingly heavy, similar to the group's earlier work or the oddness that would permeate the infamous \"Born Again\". Keyboardist Geoff Nicholls gets to strut some of his stuff on this track as well. This dark instrumental then gives way to the short, furious title track, which exists little more than to kick your teeth down your throat!\n\nSide 2 isn't really bad, but definitely more lacking . \"Country Girl\" mostly hangs on one big hook that never really leaves the song; catchy, but it gets old after a while. The rocking \"Slipping Away\" is a bit better with energetic guitarisms and drumming, but isn't too memorable after the fact. \"Falling Off The Edge of the World\" plays like a little brother to \"Sign of the Southern Cross\", and is almost as good; very dark but it gets nice and energetic around the 3 minute mark. \"Over and Over\" closes the album on sadly something of a low note; it's just a kind of generic slow song. \n\nOverall, the mob does indeed rules, and so does Sabbath. While the 2nd half of this record does loose some steam after the ass-kicker title track, it's still pretty listenable. Additionally, the veterans are as great as always, as are Dio and Appice in their respective roles. While Black Sabbath's world would only get more complicated from here on out, \"Mob Rules\" will always be here. A memorable, underrated effort well worth the time of anyone into classic metal, and the name Black Sabbath...\n",
        "\nBlack Sabbath is and always shall be one of those truly legendary bands, not just in metal, but in music all together. It's hard to believe that at one point in time they were about to fall off the map completely. After the late 70's misfires of \"Technical Ecstasy\" and \"Never Say Die\", the group went into hibernation for a couple years, ultimately culminating in the removal of the one and only Ozzy Osbourne from the ranks. But in 1980, a little man from over the rainbow took the ozzman's place, and the result is one of the most talked about \"rejuvenation\" albums in heavy metal's history. Me personally I don't think it's that fantastic, but we do have a pretty good album here.\n\nThe two top dogs on \"Heaven And Hell\", as with on pretty much any Sabbath record, are Geezer Butler on bass and riff god Tony Iommi taking on guitars as always. Geezer's bass is fuzzy and prominent, making for a nice balance/counter-balance to Iommi's rhythm riffage. Some of Iommi's finest leads are found on this particular album, while the separate riffage, while strong, are not as great on here as many of his numerous earlier efforts on the Sabbath classics. Bill Ward's usually spiffy and energetic drumming sounds on here rather mundane and pentatonic. The man was beginning to suffer from alcoholism at this time, and since this is what was most likely affecting his work, I guess I can cut him some slack, even though I personally hold little sympathy towards alcoholics. But the big name here, the big change to Black Sabbath's sound, is the only and only late great Ronnie James Dio at the mic. Dio's replacement of Ozzy is one of the great examples of a band's new singer being massively superior; Dio's booming mid range, sweeping howls and emotional clean vocals wipe out memories of Ozzy's tuneless, whiny squawking with little difficulty. \n\nIommi and Dio worked side by side during the creation of \"Heaven And Hell\"; with Dio's vastly different vocal style they didn't even bother to hide that fact, and instead began composing work more suited to the new vocalist's style. The final result is cleaner, less doomy and drugged out heavy meal more comparable to the power metal movement later in the decade. My main gripe with this album though is that even though this is Sabbath, and not only that but Sabbath without useless interludes and PCP musical progressions, there isn't as much as one would hope for in the way of big, memorable riffs. I mean there is, but there should be more. Plus I always thought a lot of the songs on here just went on and on or when they didn't they still weren't very interesting. Plus, not nearly enough faster material either.\n\nAt least things start off with a bang. Opener \"Neon Knights\", ironically the last song composed for the album, is pure starter fuel metal. Dio's righteous vocals, Iommi's charging rhythms and the boisterous bass of Butler make this a killer starter. The more balladic \"Children of the Sea\" follows, a slowish, melancholic rocker with nice, fuzzy guitars and a series of great riffs, particularly the moody acoustic moments. The rather bland and forgettable \"Lady Evil\" gives way the the titanic title track; a bit overrated ( I think the following album's \"Sign of the Southern Cross\" is far superior), but it's still pretty damn good anyway I guess with the crawling mood and unforgettable main riff (one of Iommi's finest). \"Wishing Well\" is also kinda forgettable but gets a pass from me for being a but catchy. The aggressive \"Die Young\" with its ballady middle part is pretty worthwhile but doesn't stick to long after the initial listen. I find the following song, the rocking \"Walk Away\" with many a catchy guitar lines, to be superior. \"Lonely Is The Word\" closes the album on a solid enough note.\n\nOverall, I think \"Heaven And Hell\" is a little overrated. Many of the songs don't stick as well as one would hope, and there really should be more attitude and riffage than what we got here. But the work and still effortless energy of Iommi and Butler are still to behold, as is the raging and always dependable vocal work of Mr. Dio. Incredible for the musicianship, decent on the actual music. Worth a few listens but keep your expectations in check.\n",
        "\n\"Headless Cross\" marks the end of Iommi indulging in the commercial stuff that he likes (his solo album and \"Eternal Idol\") and trying forcefully to re-establish Sabbath as a credible name for the late-'80s metal crowd, possibly for financial reasons. \"Heaven and Hell\" had been an album were Sabbath triumphantly re-entered the post-NWOBHM metal scene while sounding fresh and authentic. They had help from Dio, who had sung some fast and heavy stuff with Rainbow (\"Kill the King\", \"Light in the Black\"), and it can be clearly seen between \"Never Say Die\" and \"Heaven and Hell\" that Iommi reinvented (learned) his soloing style.\n\nAt \"Headless Cross\" times, the metal scene consisted mostly of glam rock/metal on one hand and of speed/thrash metal on the other. Iommi couldn't completely turn thrash metal, no one would have bought that, so instead he kept some form of commercial metal that didn't have the glam imagery. Hence the quasi-Satanic lyrics on this album that weren't a trademark of Sabbath, but were now expected out of their legacy (just their name alone) and of rumors concerning Ozzy 's lifestyle (bats and doves) which had had a ripple effect on Sabbath, too. \n\nThere are obvious moments on this album when Iommi consciously created songs that would remind listeners of previous glorious Sabbath songs while trying not to copy them too much. \"Devil and Daughter\" definitely re-brands the \"Children of the Grave\" riff and structure, while the pace and bass line of \"Headless Cross\" are reminiscent of \"Heaven and Hell\"'s. It's clear on \"Headless Cross\" that Martin was going to try and sound like Dio, contrarily to the previous album where had to copy Ray Gillen's guide vocals, and Ray Gillen hadn't been quite told to copy anyone. Geoff Nichols was in the band at the time and was the longest serving Sabbath member after Iommi, which helped maintain some aspects of the Dio-era sound because Nichols had been more involved than usual in \"Heaven and Hell\" during the short moment when Butler quit. \n\n\"When Death Calls\" is an excellent ballad and it ends with a faster part like some early Sabbath numbers (including the self-titled track or also \"Heaven and Hell\"), but it wouldn't appeal to ballad lovers because of the lyrics and imagery. \"Nightwing\" is another good Dio-type ballad, quiet with heavy moments with interesting acoustic guitar from Iommi. Some other songs are kind of similar, but \"Black Moon\" has a more distinct feel than the rest of this album, a short blues rock number written during the \"Eternal Idol\" sessions. \n\nIn \"Call of the Wild\", Martin tried to reference both Ozzy and Dio eras with the mention of Lucifer (\"N.I.B.\") and princes and kings (\"Neon Knight\": dragons and kings). In \"Devil and Daughter\" he re-used some of the lines he wrote during his stint with Blue Murder for the song \"Valley of the Kings\" (itself a variation on \"Kashmir\" with some \"Stargazer\" influences). The latter song does sound quite like Martin-era Sabbath, which shows that Martin really brought his own vocal lines (though influenced by Dio). To say a bit more about the lyrics, the \"Devil and Daughter\" title is similar to Ozzy's \"Devil's Daughter\" that came out the year before (\"No Rest for the Wicked\"), and the chorus to \"Call of the Wild\" (Hero) is the \"unknown\" title to Ozzy's hidden track on the same album. Bob Daisley played bass on the previous Sabbath album and then with Ozzy on \"No Rest for the Wicked\", so perhaps that could explain the similar song titles? To be sure, Martin contributed most of the lyrics, but it's not impossible that he had \"working\" titles set by Daisley during previous sessions.\n\nAll and all, the problem with the Martin era was not Martin's voice, which was excellent. It was simply that the band didn't produce anything original, and what they produced was deemed too wimpy by thrash metal fans and too dark and \"Satanic\" by glam metal fans. The guys didn't look like the guys in Poison; Martin's hair was on par with Geoff Tate's...going, going...and that didn't help video clip rotation or poster sales. Though The Scorpions did appeal to \"ballad fans\" despite their older and rugged look, they sang about believing in love, not about Satan living in the souls of the dying.\n",
        "\nIt's often been said that this is a conceptual album about Norse mythology. But the bulk of this album is pretty much Judeo-christian. Side A alone (1-4) could have made a decent concept album on the Bible if not the Torah; Law Maker is almost about Moses, Jerusalem could be about King David or Jesus. The concept of Anno Mundi is related to the creation of the world as expressed in the Judeo-christian scriptures, and the Sabbath Stones conjure the images of tablets of stone. Both songs are also about fulfilling prophecies. Those references aside, Anno Mundi conveys an anti-war message not unlike War Pigs (generals..), Sabbath Stones was the third ever song to feature the word Sabbath in the title (and second one to actually feature the word Sabbath in the lyrics) but the first one in a long-time (17 years). This is to mean that Martin, who wrote the lyrics, was consciously trying to maintain a certain level of familiarity and continuity with the band's previous work. Another example of this is the mention of Lucifer in Heaven in Black (N.I.B). Not attempting to sound sinister with every sentence allows Martin to come up with some pretty fine lyrics.\n\nAbout the Norse part of the album, the song Valhalla must be directed to Tyr (otherwise there is no reason for the album's name) and is loosely about Ragnar\u00f6k, the final battle at the end of the world, which Loki indirectly triggered (he who has the skill of deceit). The version which Martin referred to here is probably the Germanic one which inspired Wagner for Der Ring des Nibelungen (G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung, or Twilight of the Gods) because it refers to a ring. \n\nNow, about the music. Not unlike Headless Cross, Iommi has been recycling some patterns from Sabbath's earlier glorious days. Anno Mundi's acoustic intro is eerily similar to that of Children of the Sea; and the riff is reminescent (though in a lesser capacity) of Zero the Hero's (and Guns'N'Roses' Paradise City to some extent, but this is GnR's fault originally). The verse part of Sabbath Stones is built on the War Pigs model; a riff with lyrics sang in between. Heaven in Black is built on a Children the Grave pattern (listen to the riffing during the verses). Still, aside of the Anno Mundi intro, these borrowings are quite subtle and if anything, serve to give a continuity feel.\n\nThe album has very fine moments, such as the contrasting acoustic passages in Sabbath Stones, whose lyrics are ambiguous and evocative enough not to make anyone cringe. Anno Mundi has beautiful vocal overlays and works very well on all levels. The heavier, fast-paced songs (The Law Maker and Heaven in Black) provide a good contrast to the album which otherwise contains several soft parts. Jerusalem and Valhalla have extremely catchy, and yet not cheesy, choruses and very good build-ups. Cozy Powell's power drums on Valhalla mark the transition from Odin's Court to that song very well. The Battle of Tyr is perhaps a little cheap (keyboard orchestra?) but nevertheless provide a Wagnerian feel to this ~8 minutes song which culminates as Valhalla. \n\nOne can't blame Sabbath here for playing it safe and trying to apply a recipe; it was very uncommon for a metal or rock band back then to have orchestral passages on an album (I'm not talking about orchestrating certain songs like Queensr\u00ffche or Aerosmith did with Michael Kamen). Same for the subject matter which gave the album its title; this is before the label Viking metal was crafted. Though Manowar and Bathory had sung about Nordic mythology already, I really don't think here that Sabbath were trying to jump on any bandwagon. They chose this subject probably because they had done the pseudo-satanic thing an album before, and wanted to explore other ominous fantasy subjects (as they had started with Dio); they could have chosen Celtic, Greek or Roman mythologies.. the English week days are almost all named after Norse god names, so perhaps it was just an arbitrary decision.\n\nOdin's Court contains very nice electric guitar licks who would later turn up on the Bible Black song. As for Feel Goods to Me, it is reminescent (in its overall commercial attempt) of No Stranger to Love from Iommi's previous solo album and one can indeed wonder.. what was he thinking ? Did he really thought he would get an MTV hit with this song or video? It's not a bad song, but it affects the cohesion of this album.\n\nWorthy of mention is that this album had the rhythm section (bass+drums) of Whitesnake, Slide it In era. Does it show in the music? No. In this type of Sabbath, bass is not very important. Headless Cross had a session bass player, and here is Neil Murray who already has a good musical relationship with the drummer. He does a fine job, but the job is not that all important, unlike in other eras of Sabbath where Butler is needed. This kind of polished-AOR rock doesn't need the Geezer Butler bass, though obviously he could also do the job.\n\nAll in all, this album is constituted of 1)a mini album whose themes revolve around Christanity and/or Judaism (1-4), 2)an EP whose theme is Norse mythology (5-7), 3)a MTV/radio-friendly ballad (8) and 4)a heavier song based about some kind of episode from the Russian Empire (9). It could have been a more credible album if better organized, were the MTV ballad removed and the Norse trilogy (one three-part song, really) expanded to make two cohesive, individually themed album sides.\n\nIt is a very good counterpart to Headless Cross. Both albums form an era in themselves, and this one is the lighter side, whereas Headless Cross is the darker.\n",
        "\nWhen you think of Black Sabbath , frontmen Ozzy Osbourne and Ronnie James Dio would come to mind. But does anyone remember Tony Martin? You know, the guy who fronted Sabbath for 10 years after Ian Gillan and Glenn Hughes had lead vocal duty? As it turns out Tony Martin stood at the mic longer than any other Black Sabbath vocalist not named Ozzy Osbourne. Even longer than iconic replacement Ronnie James Dio. And yet some casual Black Sabbath fans have probably never even heard of him. A decent number of hardcore fans also tend to overlook and disregard that era of Sabbath, as Tony Iommi was the sole remaining founding member and seemed to have a new lineup with him every few months or so. Combined with a drastic change in sound from the bluesy Ozzy era and the fantastical Dio era is what caused many to question Black Sabbath's legitimacy and led to the band's decline in fame. Tony Martin was hired as a replacement for Ray Gillen during the recording of The Eternal Idol and did quite a stand up job. His first test passed, Martin returned with Sabbath to the studio for the follow-up. The result was Sabbath's most evil and underrated masterpiece: Headless Cross.\n\nWhile Black Sabbath had generated controversy as a \"Satanic\" band since its inception with songs like Black Sabbath and N.I.B., very few of their songs had anything to do with the devil and instead focused on topics such as war, drug addiction, and society. Even the fantasy-based Dio era was more focused on wizards and what have you. Thus, Headless Cross is lyrically Black Sabbath's darkest album, with every song (minus bonus track Cloak and Dagger) dealing with the occult and supernatural. And yet it is not a doom metal album either, most of the songs being upbeat and epic rockers contrasted by eerie and demonic-sounding keyboards. To pull off such an effort, Geoff Nicholls does some of his finest key work on Headless Cross with spine-chilling yet ambient melodies. Newest recruit and Rainbow veteran Cozy Powell brings his trademark snare to the forefront, ultimately solidifying his status as second to Bill Ward. The bass work is also impressive as jazz-oriented session member Laurence Cottle does a good job complimenting Tony Iommi with some of his most underrated guitar riffs and solos. The bass intro of When Death Calls is not only amazing but truly haunting, and full-time replacement Neil Murray would do a good job covering it in the subsequent tours. And that brings us to Mr. Martin. It was with Headless Cross that Tony began to flex his vocal muscles, and his high-powered screams on Headless Cross, Devil & Daughter, and Nightwing are mind-blowing. With such a stable lineup, a solid album would be expected. But Black Sabbath exceeded those expectations with Headless Cross.\n\nInstrumental intro The Gates of Hell sounds like it came straight out of a horror movie and sets the tone for such a spooky album. Rattling drums and ghostly wailing keyboards transition right into the title track. While underrated, Headless Cross ends up being one of the greatest songs of any Sabbath lineup. From Cozy's classic drum intro, to Iommi's upbeat yet grinding riff, organ keyboards, and Tony Martin screaming a very catchy chorus, Headless Cross is an unrecognized classic and a tough song to follow. But the band manages to keep the pace going. Devil & Daughter has a more mainstream feel to it and is one of the fastest songs on the album. Iommi pumps out one of the best solos of the album while Martin hits some of the highest notes of his career. When Death Calls is the darkest song on the album, featuring a soft and spooky keyboard melody and cymbals in the verses before transitioning to a diabolical riff in the chorus. The second half of the album picks up with blistering speed and features easily the best solo on the album from Queen guitarist Brian May. Kill in the Spirit World and Call of the Wild are both similar in being upbeat rockers with Call of the Wild taking a more aggressive feel and Kill in the Spirit World being more upbeat. Kill in the Spirit World may sound a little too lighthearted at the beginning but eventually contrasts that mood with an eerie chorus and bridge before one of Tony Iommi's best career solos. Call of the Wild also has one of the more memorable choruses. Penultimate track Black Moon is a contender for being the second-to-best song on the album with an absolutely bluesy and aggressive riff and most sing-a-long chorus on the album to help send Headless Cross out on a high note. The final track is psuedo-ballad Nightwing, which starts with a dark yet tranquil acoustic riff before introducing a heavier chorus. Tony Iommi does commendable experimentation here with electric and acoustic guitar solos while Tony Martin hits the same notes you couldn't believe he hit in Devil & Daughter. The only song on the album that falters a bit is bonus track Cloak and Dagger. Though a decent rocker, it doesn't seem to fit with the general theme or feel of the album. That being said, it's only a bonus track and doesn't affect the rating much at all.\n\nDespite having a more anthemic-rock feel compared to the Ozzy and Dio albums, Headless Cross is every bit as deserving of the Black Sabbath name as any other album. Black Sabbath recorded their first album with the idea in mind to create music tantamount to horror movies, and Headless Cross is the album that best fits that bill. Though upbeat in nature at times (with the exception of Headless Cross, When Death Calls, and Nightwing), occult lyrics and demonic keyboards make Headless Cross Black Sabbath's darkest album. Though currently out of print and generally unknown by most except for veteran Sabbath fans, Headless Cross achieves to be not only the best Tony Martin album, but easily one of Sabbath's best overall. All hail to the headless cross.\n",
        "\nTony Martin, thou hath been forsaken. Seriously, the Tony Martin era of Black Sabbath has always been criminally underrated except amongst the hardcore Sabbath fans on Youtube and this website. And yet I still see ridiculous references to Tony Martin copying Dio's vocal style or head-scratching comments that the music became more power metal-oriented. True, the Tony Martin era of Sabbath featured drastic musical departures from the bluesy and brooding Ozzy era and the fantastical yet dark Dio era, but was it ever for the worse? In this reviewer's eyes, no way. Still, with Tony Iommi having been the only remaining original Sabbath member from Eternal Idol to TYR and the band having a revolving door of musicians, I understand some diehard Ozzy and Dio fans' skepticism. But Cross Purposes saw the first and only Tony Martin album to feature founding bassist Geezer Butler after his return with the Dio-fronted Sabbath album Dehumanizer. If that doesn't bring some \"legitimacy\" to the Tony Martin era, then the sound certainly should, as Cross Purposes is classic Sabbath in 90's form.\n\nDespite the sound and the top-notch musician line-up, Cross Purposes was not even supposed to be a Sabbath album. It was supposed to kill time until the original lineup could reunite. But label pressures forced the album to be branded as Black Sabbath and Geezer left shortly after in disillusionment. This is truly odd as Cross Purposes has a very \"Sabbath\" feel to it. There may be a \"90's rock\" touch to it, but bands can't stick to the same old song-and-dance for 30 years. Familiarity comes in the form of dark brooding numbers reminiscent of Ozzy and Dio mixed with fast-paced rockers more in touch with Tony Martin. In the end, it's a fantastic combination of sound. While Dehumanizer went overkill a tad bit with the doom metal, it's used much more sparingly this time around. The musicians are also on top of their game. Tony Iommi remains the riffmaster of metal and an excellent soloist, Rainbow's Bobby Rondinelli gives Bill Ward and Cozy Powell a run for their money with blazing-fast and pounding drum work, Geoff Nicholls' keyboards add both atmosphere and eeriness to the melodeis, and Geezer's bass lines are dark and heavy, proving the chemistry between him Iommi is still in full force. Hell, even Eddie Van Halen shows up with a crazy solo on Evil Eye. Oh yeah, Tony Martin is still kinda good too if you didn't notice. He continues to carry the passion and emotion in his delivery from previous albums while occasionally adopting a more brooding voice to show off his true range. \n\nCross Purposes has one of the most consistent, top-to-bottom lineup of songs on any Black Sabbath album. Album opener I Witness rushes out the gate with a speedy yet sinister guitar riff while Martin shows off his vocal range by alternating brooding with screaming. Cross of Thorns and Cardinal Sin are dark slower-paced numbers which grind with aggression and make use of the soft-loud dynamic. Psychophobia and Back to Eden are more upbeat rockers with the former fast-paced and the latter more restrained in delivery. Immaculate Deception is heavy and grinding like Cross of Thorns and Cardinal Sin with its verses but picks up in speed during the choruses. The most unique track, The Hand That Rocks the Cradle starts with an eerie keyboard melody before erupting into a faster-paced rocker and alternately returning to the keyboard melody before the final verse. It's really the more brooding grinders that hearken back to the early Sabbath days while the others are more reminiscent of the previous Tony Martin albums. The three remaining songs are the only ones that are either somewhat lacking or hit-and-miss. Virtual Death is an extremely dark doom metal song with a cool bass intro from Geezer, but the slow and grinding riff combined with Martin's lower range make it come off as an Alice in Chains impersonation rather than Black Sabbath. Evil Eye features an awesome guitar solo from Eddie Van Halen, but it ends up being a somewhat boring mid-paced rocker. Dying for Love, the only true power ballad on the album, isn't bad as far as Black Sabbath ballads or ballads in general go, but it's not very interesting or notable either. However, the fact that none of the aforementioned songs are even really bad and that the rest of the album is so strong is what prevents Cross Purposes from getting a lower score. Had all copies contained the Japanese bonus track What's the Use?, an extremely fast, catchy, and headbanging rocker that is a serious contender for the album's best song, the album would have been even more near-perfect.\n\nPoor Tony Martin. This album was his finest hour behind Headless Cross and is a serious contender for one of Black Sabbath's top 5 albums. The combination of dark grinding metal with fast-paced rock, combined with Geezer Butler's contributions, really helps put to rest the whole \"Tony Martin era of Black Sabbath isn't real Black Sabbath\" argument to rest. And that's not to say that any of the Tony Martin albums weren't true Black Sabbath albums either. But Cross Purposes is what reminds fans of the older days by bringing all eras of Sabbath into one awesome album. But if Black Sabbath fans can't understand or accept the merits of this album, then what's the use?\n",
        "\nAh, Paranoid. Black Sabbath's best-selling album and debatably their best album. It has a certain charm that will never be matched, not even by the most brilliant of metal artists. It's probably the best traditional heavy metal album made. The riffs that have that nice bluesy feel, Ozzy's dark doom metal vocals, and Bill Ward's complex but rhythmic and soulful drumming form a satisfying and unique work of art. \n\nThe riffs from the songs are probably most worth noting. Eg: The opening riff from \"War Pigs\". It's amazingly atmospheric while containing what I consider nearly a perfect melody. On the other hand, the other, more bluesy and energetic riffs mix in nicely with the darker ones. Another thing definitely worth noting is the variety of song structure in the album. You have the darker, doom metal heaviness present in songs like \"Hand Of Doom\" and \"Electric Funeral\" while you have the faster, more hard blues-rock feel in songs like \"Paranoid\" and \"Fairies Wear Boots\". I would say my favourite riff is the opening riff for Electric Funeral. I love how they can put a dark riff and add a \"wah wah\" sound to it. \n\nAnother factor that really adds to this album is Bill Ward's drumming. He actually makes good use of the cymbals, something a good number of drummers fail to do. He also has the ability to do decent quieter drumming during the more low-key passages, such as in the intro to Hand Of Doom. This shows that he is a drummer who is willing to try different things and experiment. \n\nHow could I forget? I don't think metal genres like gothic, doom, or sludge would be the what they are without Ozzy's atmospheric vocals. He practically pioneered the usage of gloominess in singing during the early 70s (keeping in mind goth rock wasn't invented yet). He sounds like a lost child crying out loud in despair for help. It fits perfectly with the instrumentation of this album. Both his voice and the riffs carry the same emotion. \n\nOverall, this is a great album and really shows what Black Sabbath has to offer. I recommend getting it, especially if you enjoy older, traditional heavy metal. Probably my only complaint about this album is that it's only 42 minutes long, in other words the fun doesn't last forever. Still, you're probably missing out if you don't have it and if you get it, It will surely make it's way into your heart. No doubt.\n",
        "\n**Note: This is a review of the 2010 Deluxe Edition**\n\n\u201cThe Eternal Idol\u201d is a funny album. Going into the recording for Black Sabbath\u2019s 13th album, the unlucky number foreshadowed what was about to happen to the group\u2019s ranks. It started out with Tony Iommi on guitar as always along with Ray Gillen donning the microphone with Eric Singer and Dave Spitz on the drums and bass respectively. By the time the Idol was finished, Spitz and Gillen were out and the reliable Bob Daisley and little known Tony Martin would wrap up the recording sessions. With the sudden line-up changes, Iommi still managed to make a cohesive record with heavier guitars than \u201cSeventh Star.\u201d There are some elements of glam thrown in as well, letting it be known this is indeed came out in the eighties. The 2010 deluxe edition comes with two b-sides as well as the demos with Gillen before he departed.\n\nThe most notable aspect is the new comer behind the microphone with Martin. He is blessed with the powers to resemble Ronnie James Dio at times and nail all the high notes. His ominous tone in the title track can send shutters down your spine and the grandmaster Iommi provides the necessary tools in \u201cAncient Warrior\u201d to let Martin\u2019s voice shine. \n\n\u201cThe Shining\u201d opens with an acoustic part that bursts into electric gravity with a riff easy to headbang along with complimented by solid vocal lines and chorus. The aforementioned \u201cAncient Warrior\u201d is a standout track because Martin\u2019s voice travels with the rhythm wonderfully and the synth effects provided by Geoff Nicholls are a nice touch.\n\nThe idol loses its luster with \u201cHard Life to Love.\u201d This song would not sound out of place on a Dokken record. Dokken rocks, but a band like Black Sabbath should not be hopping the glam train. The offense would be committed twice more with \u201cLost Forever\u201d and \u201cBorn to Lose.\u201d The latter always makes me think of Motorhead because of the title and this song receives a pass because it is hard not to appreciate the riff and Eric Singer\u2019s drumming stands out.\n\nIf the hardened listener is gawking for true Black Sabbath from the Ozzy Osbourne days then \u201cScarlet Pimpernel\u201d and the title track may provide the answer. The former is a little acoustic number with Iommi putting some light notes together and it serves as a change of pace and a breather for what is ahead. The title track has the gloom and doom that provides a sense of despair that permeates the atmosphere. It\u2019s a startling ending to an album that is pretty upbeat throughout.\n\nThere are two extra songs on the first disc in \u201cBlack Moon\u201d and \u201cSome Kind of Woman.\u201d \u201cBlack Moon\u201d would reappear on \u201cHeadless Cross\u201d, but the single version is different as there are no added vocals near the end of the song and not as much put into the lead guitar from Iommi. It still is an enjoyable tune and the verses give Martin room to deliver his message. \u201cSome Kind of Woman\u201d seems like an answer to Van Halen\u2019s \u201cHot for Teacher\u201d with some blistering guitar effects and theatrics and fast paced singing. It is not that great a song though and ultimately forgettable.\n\nDisc two has the Gillen sessions and the one thought that prevailed was that was his album. \u201cThe Eternal Idol\u201d suited Gillen\u2019s strengths and he sings effortlessly and flawlessly. It is a shame that he did not stick around long enough to have his voice on the record. This is by no means an affront to Martin because he does a great job on here and he is to be commended for coming in on short notice, but Gillen has more the glam image to him and lyrics about love and women seem more believable with him singing than an ugly dude like Martin. If there was any doubt that Gillen could not conceive demons in his voice than look no further than to the title track to dispel any doubt. His voice soars in \u201cGlory Ride\u201d and the chorus lines seem so natural to him.\n\nIf you are going to purchase this album, then this is the way to go. The deluxe edition is more expensive, but it is hard to deny the extras. On the other hand, if you already own this then its best to decide the worth of wanting the Gillen demos and the two b-sides. As for the album itself, I point to what Alex Milas wrote in the linear notes as he basically states this no classic, but is a mark of a band trying to survive and hang on to its legacy. That sums the album up perfectly.\n\nnicksmetal.blogspot.com\n",
        "\nAfter the release of Vol. 4, Black Sabbath seemed to be heading down a road of mediocrity. Thankfully they proved all wrong with the release of their follow-up album, Sabbath Bloody Sabbath. The band took a turn into a more progressive band with complex song structures, odd time signatures, and longer songs. Full of amazing guitar work, great bass playing, and tight drums his turn led to one of Sabbath's greatest offerings.\n\nIommi takes the thin tone of the previous album and amps it up to how it should have sounded while showcasing some of his finest guitar playing. This album is full of complex and heavy riffs like that of the title track, \"Sabbra Cadabra\" and \"Killing Yourself to Live\". Tracks like \"A National Acrobat\" really show Iommi greatness with multi-structured riffs, catchy interludes, and great solos. Iommi shows a great deal of his most interesting solos on \"Killing Yourself to Live\" and \"Looking for Today\". \"Fluff\" is a great piece featuring only acoustic guitar, piano, and synth. This song has a great tone and atmosphere that feels like you are floating high in the clouds making this one of Iommi's best acoustic performances. It seems as if after Vol. 4 Iommi realized his mistakes on Vol. 4 and completely fixed them all. and overall Iommi does a brilliant job on this record providing one of his best performances to date.\n\nThe bass on this album is very good. Geezer is actually audible on this album, which is a huge improvement from the last. He has a nice clean tone that can be heard rumbling about on \"Sabbra Cadabra\" and \"Spiral Architect\". \"Who Are You?\" has some great distorted bass playing in the background. This is a great effect to the song and really makes the doomy atmosphere shine. Geezer does a great job of this record keeping the groove and even doing his own in some parts which is nice to hear again.\n\nBill Ward is back on drums and seems to be more motivated this time around. Supplying some great beats on \"A National Acrobat\" and \"Spiral Architect\". It's great to hear Ward actually feel like he is into the music he is playing and work with it. His kit has a great tone with cymbals that are at the perfect volume. Ward does some nice rolls here and there on \"Looking For Today\" and \"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\" that bring back the greatness of his work on the earlier albums. In the end Ward does a fantastic job fixing the volume problems of the past album as well as getting more motivated and into the music.\n\nOther than the regular guitar, bass and drums, the band experiments with other instruments like the flute and piano while Rick Wakeman from Yes does keyboards. Surprisingly these additional instruments work extremely well in this new prog oriented music. The flute on \"Looking For Today\" is rather nice behind the vocals and acoustic guitar giving the song a Peter Gabriel era Genesis feel. The keyboards on \"Sabbra Cadabra\" fit shockingly well in the song and bringing it to a great descending passage for the rest of the track. \"Who Are You?\", which i admit i actually hated at first, is a rather odd song. In the vein of the 70's prog of the time, they made a keyboard oriented song that is very doomy. This song could take some time to understand but you'll learn to appreciate Sabbath experimenting.\n\nOn vocals are presented from none other than Ozzy Osbourne who does a great performance. Ozzy's voice is higher this time around but work great with the proggy music on this record. Ozzy does a great job expressing emotions of the lyrics like on \"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\", \"A National Acrobat\" and \"Killing Yourself to Live\". Overall Ozzy's voice seems really motivated and into the music like the rest of the band and supplies a great vocal performance. The lyrics on this record are some of my favorite from main lyricist Geezer Butler. \"A National Acrobat\" has amazing lyrics talking about reincarnation and living multiple lives. While \"Sabbra Cadabra\" tells a story of loving a woman and thinking your life is going well and then leaving her and soon realizing her importance to you. It's a typical 'you dont know what you got until its gone' story but the band expresses the lyrics very well. \"Killing Yourself to Live\", which is written about Bill Ward's drinking problem, shows the sadness and confusion of drinking and not being able to get out. Geezer and the band wrote their best lyrical content on this record and make it work perfectly with the music.\n\nFive years into the groups career they are still producing great music and possible their greatest offering. Full of amazing and complex riffs, great rhythm section, and Ozzy's emotion vocals this is an album for any metal fan into Sabbath and looking to see their more experimental side.\n",
        "\nHeavy metal pioneers Black Sabbath were well on the road to glory after releasing their previous album, Master of Reality, but it seems they have lost their footing a bit on there next release, Black Sabbath Vol. 4. Somewhat carrying the heavy guitars from the previous album and making them flatter and louder, while drowning out the bass that made Sabbath so great in the first place. This is not at all a bad album, but can take some getting used to and could turn off fans of the first 3 albums due to its production.\n\nFirst things first, the guitars. Iommi has somehow taken his monstrous tone from the previous album and made it thinner and louder, a lot louder. This new direction for the guitar tone can take some getting used to, but I'll admit it does have a great middle and high section and even a great low on the intros to \"Cornucopia\" and \"Under the Sun\". The riffs on this record can seem kind of unmotivated at times but can be overlooked with great riffs like that on, \"Supernaut\", \"Tomorrow's Dream\" and \"Under the Sun\". Iommi also shows his acoustic skill on the track \"Laguna Sunrise\" which is a decent track and definitely the weakest of his acoustic work. Some great solos are on this record including one of Iommi's best, \"Wheels of Confusion\". The biggest complaint about the guitars is they are too damn loud, but the riffs are good so its kind of a double edged sword.\n\nAlong with the guitars, the vocals on this record are loud. Ozzy's voice seems slightly too loud as if he is competing with the guitar for decibels. Ozzy's voice is rather good though, its full of energy and ready to play. \"Supernaut\" has some great energy from Ozzy and keeps the track moving at a great pace. \"Snowblind\" also has some nice vocals patterns and lines that make Ozzy really stand out. The lyrics on this album are pretty good too. Speaking about drugs, depression, and religion in the typical Black Sabbath style. \"Under the Sun\" has come great lyrics talking about not wanting to be preached at and told what to do. \"Cornucopia\" has come great lyrics as well, talking about government corruption and brainwashing. The legendary \"Changes\", which is a piano ballad piece, that is rather sappy with the lyrics but is a great tune in the end. \n\nBill Wards drumming on this record is pretty solid. Giving some decent structure to the songs but seems to be unmotivated and just came along for the ride. Ward's cymbals are also way too loud. Covering up everything that there is to be heard at times like on \"Supernaut\" and \"Snowblind\". Other than that Ward's drumming is just okay at best and definitely his weakest contribute to the bands discography.\n\nGeezer Butler's bass is nowhere to be heard on this album which is definitely a huge problem. The bass being turned all the way down really takes the great rhythm section Black Sabbath is known for away from this album. Instead he lets the guitar stand up front, which is okay i guess, Iommi does a great job on guitar and but without the bass it does half the greatness it could have.\n\nOverall this album is good but has a few fatal flaws that can turn away fans. Iommi's guitar and Ozzy's vocals are too loud, Ward's drumming seems uninspired and lacking with incredible loud cymbals and Geezer is nowhere to be heard. Yet Iommi provides some amazing riffs, Ozzy displays some fantastic vocal lines and lyrics, and Ward gives decent structure to the song. This can be a tough album to get into but it should be checked about by any metal fan.\n",
        "\nVol. 4 is a good album. No, a GREAT album. Sabbath really sounds like they're trying to do something new and it works most of the time. MOST of the time. \n\nYou may notice that this is probably the most \"upbeat\" album of Sabbath's Golden Age (70-75). It has its darker moments, but the tracks are more up-tempo and the lyrical themes aren't quite as focused on the occult. There's even a \"breakup\" song (Changes). I do admire this for the most part; the experimenting here is dangerous and consistently successful. There are two instrumentals that serve as simple filler (FX and Laguna Sunrise) and while this wouldn't be the first time Black Sabbath filled track space with minuscule tracks like this, they really don't serve much of a purpose. On Master of Reality, each \"ditty\" set the tone for a particularly epic track. On Vol. 4 they seem pointlessly shoehorned. \n\nTony Iommi can still riff as always. His highlights include opener Wheels of Confusion, the epic Snowblind, and the ridiculously fun Supernaut. His playing is a little bit faster than normal, but he doesn't lose the sludgy feel that he perfected on the other albums. One thing that HAS consistently changed are his solos, and they are absolutely STUNNING on Vol. 4. \n\nBill Ward and Geezer Butler make for a fantastic rhythm section as always. Sadly, they aren't given as many chances to shine, and sometimes they just feel \"along for the ride\", which is a shame, because they have the potential to carry a song. I wish they had gotten rid of FX and Laguna Sunrise and given Geezer a bass solo (like on the first album) or perhaps a song where Ward could show off a bit, like on Children of the Grave or Symptom of the Universe. \n\nEven if a few of the riskier experiments don't quite work, Vol. 4 is packed with great, essential tracks. Snowblind absolutely rocks balls, and I can't imagine how incredible it would be to hear live. Supernaut is a great song to jam out to, and Wheels of Confusion packs the free-jamming and soloing that made the first album and Master of Reality so great. I recommend it to you if you consider yourself a Sabbath fan.\n",
        "\nThe legendary Black Sabbath crashed into the music scene in early 1970 with their groundbreaking debut. Pioneering a genre isn't easy, but Black Sabbath seems to pull it off with ease. Combining blues, jazz, and rock into what is now known as heavy metal. Showcasing the classic metal riffing, unique vocals, and truly phenomenal rhythm section, making this one of metal's best offerings...and I'm not just saying that because it was the first metal record, simply because it is just that good.\n\nGuitars are supplied by none other than the legend, Tony Iommi. Delivering crushing riffs ranging from blues, rock, and even jazz. The eponymous \"Black Sabbath\" and \"The Wizard\" have great heavy opening riffs that really show what heavy metal is all about. Other riffs like \"Behind the Wall of Sleep\" and \"Wicked World\" are very bluesy and show Iommi's roots as a guitarist. Some great solos are on this record as well. \"Sleeping Village\" has a nice bluesy solo that climaxes greatly and brings the song nicely back to the main riff. The group's cover of Aynsley Dunbar Retaliation's \"Warning\" really show Iommi's improvisational skills towards the middle and end with a three minute solo. Overall his tone is great. Very heavy with a nice and smooth mid section and twangy highs that fit perfectly with the album.\n\nThe real star of this album is Bill Ward. Laying out some of the smoothest and grooviest beats, rolls and fills I've laid ears on. I'll admit, I am a sucker when it comes jazzy drum rolls and beats and let me tell you the rolls and fills on this album satisfy my jazz craving. Beats like that on \"Behind of the Wall of Sleep\" are catchy as fuck and hold the whole song in place well for Geezer to jam while Iommi rips up on the guitar. Some great rolls and fills are also present like on \"The Wizard\" and \"Wicked World\" that would make any jazz fan proud. Ward's kit has a very clean and natural sound to it that I admire. Along with Ward's jazz and blues background he is a great addition to the rhythm section.\n\nAlso within the rhythm section is Geezer Butler on bass. Geezer does a great job on this record, really backing up Iommi's licks and riffs with a great sense of rhythm and timings. \"Behind the Wall of Sleep\" has some great classic Geezer lines that are in perfect harmony with Ward's beats and Iommi's riffs. \"Warning\" also has a great groovy bass line that shows his true capabilities to keep a groove going and improvise around it. Other than bass lines, \"N.I.B.\" has an awesome bass solo intro slathered in some wah-wah and a bit of distortion. The solo is pretty great and leads perfectly into the opening riff. In general Geezer's bass is very clean and very playful. He is not shy to toy with the groove or add his own thing into the songs, which really makes his bass playing unique.\n\nOn top of all of this stand Ozzy's vocals. Ozzy's voice sounds rather old as if he pulled a Benjamin Button and started with the voice we would later have at 50. It actually fits nicely in the blues infused music and sad lyrics. The lyrics are typical Sabbath stuff consisting of doom, evil, and darkness. The opening track \"Black Sabbath\" has a fantastic vocal role in the song. Speaking of being visited in the night by a the devil, it works so well with the music. \"Wicked World\" also has great lyrics. Talking about how the world is kind of fucked up as well as political criticism. In the end great vocals, actually one of few albums were Ozzy actually \"sings\".\n\nThus, metal is born. Rooted on blues, rock and jazz Black Sabbath presents the original sound of metal. Showcasing heavy riffs, dark vocals and lyrics, and a rhythm section that is tighter than a nun's cunt, this is a must for any metal fan or those looking to get into metal.\n",
        "\nAh, Master of Reality. The crown jewel of the sludgy origins of the metal genre. Black Sabbath DOMINATED the metal scene, and for good reason. Tony Iommi's riffs are almost always unforgettable, Bill Ward's drumming is ridiculous, Ozzy's vocals, though gruff and very off-putting at first, have a distinct quality, and Geezer is, in my opinion, the greatest bassist of all time. Master of Reality was probably the first metal album that I could consider high art. There is such a terrifying shadow-and-light dynamic here. But enough gushing. Let's really talk about WHY Master of Reality is, well...masterful. \n\nStarting off, songwriting is stellar. There's stuff here that's haunting (Into the Void) thought-provoking (Children of the Grave) controversial (After Forever) and poignant (Solitude). Master of Reality truly exploits a massive range of emotions in its eight tracks (Only six of which even have vocals!).\n\nInstrumentals have always been one of Black Sabbath's strongest points. Tony Iommi probably has more unforgettable riffs on this album than most guitarists have in all their career. The structure on Children of the Grave was, at the time, unlike anything Sabbath had normally written. Children also has one of the catchiest riffs you'll ever hear, and is guaranteed to get stuck in your head later. Bill Ward's drumming on that same track is ridiculously tight. This is actually one of the few songs I've ever heard where I ALTERNATE between air guitar and drums. Geezer Butler's bass guitar adds a lot of the quality which makes this album so amazingly heavy. He doesn't play around with it much, but the \"less is more\" approach really works. Into the Void is easily Iommi's highlight on MoR, as it bears the greatest metal riff ever penned. Overall, riffs are as strong as ever. \n\nOzzy's voice is always a stumbling block. He is very raspy, and sometimes he sounds like he's choking on a rat, but even for its shrillness, Ozzy's voice fits the songs here perfectly. Ozzy's voice is, for better or for worse, very recognizable, very memorable, and very imposing. As always in Sabbath, he uses his vocal disadvantage to the best effect. \n\nSpeaking of vocals, there is one track that stands out for its lyrics-After Forever. See, I LOVE this song, I love the riffs and the tune and almost everything, but this song takes a lot of shit because it's a rather ham-fisted Christianity endorsement. But even though I am a staunch Atheist, I have an appreciation for the passion Geezer has for his faith. He could bear to tone it down, but this song still isn't bad by any means. \n\nProduction, as always for the classic lineup of Black Sabbath, is muddy and grainy. But much like Ozzy's raspy voice, this actually has an advantage, because the production quality fits the songs being played nigh-perfectly. It never gets in the way, and that is pretty impressive a feat in itself. \n\nLyrical themes are varied. There is some very meaningful, powerful stuff here (Children of the Grave warns the consequences of nuclear warfare, for example.) Of course, in its sound, this album is very sludgy, very \"stoner\", and nowhere does this shine through more than on the album's opener, Sweet Leaf, a love note to marijuana. Solitude is a relatable song about loneliness. The tone and themes here are very dark. \n\nSo there we have it, Master of Reality. There are qualities this album has that are almost intangible, for example, Master is one of the few albums I've ever heard that is both frenetic and slow at the same time. It's also one of the best albums I've ever heard for simple relaxation. Plus, it's a thinker's album. To paraphrase Sweet Leaf, this album introduced me to my mind. My favorite metal album ever, if you haven't heard it then go listen NOW.\n",
        "\n**Note: This is a review of the 2010 Deluxe Edition**\n\nThis has to be the goofiest title of a band ever. Seeing \u201cBlack Sabbath featuring Tony Iommi\u201d is like if \u201cThe System Has Failed\u201d had the title \u201cMegadeth featuring Dave Mustaine. There is no one else anyone would expect being associated with these groups so I can imagine the bewilderment or laughter when metal connoisseurs saw this record when it first came out. It is understood this was supposed to be an Iommi solo record, but Warner Bros. wanted the Black Sabbath stamp on it. With that fact, this is not your typical Sabbath affair with heavy guitars and doom laden lyrics. It actually has more an eighties feel which works at times and also does not while also showing Iommi\u2019s blues background. The addition of another former Deep Purple singer, Glen Hughes, is welcomed and delivers a great performance. A deluxe edition was made available in 2010 and features a concert from the Hammersmith Odeon in England with Ray Gillen on vocals and it all bundles up as a nice package capturing a tumultuous period in Black Sabbath.\n\nIn addition to Hughes, Iommi armed the rest of the band with a couple of young guns in drummer Eric Singer and bassist Dave Spitz as Geezer Butler had enough and Bill Ward could not be found. The combination of the four all lead to this varied selection of songs on \u201cSeventh Star.\u201d\n\nTo all the hardened fans that keep a skeptical eye on this product, I urge to remove the veils and take this for what it is. This album is not going to conjure up memories of \u201cSabotage\u201d or \u201cHeaven and Hell\u201d, but it holds up well in the lengthy and varied Sabbath discography. \n\n\u201cIn for the Kill\u201d is quite literally the killer opener with a low riff and Hughes declaring his prey by commanding \u201cThunder shattered the dawn.\u201d This bit of lyric tingles the senses and I love the way Hughes delivers the lines. In fact, Hughes delivers an awesome performance on this record. The way he laments on \u201cIn Memory\u2026\u201d and conjures up images of ancient Egypt in the title track is remarkable and is attention grabbing.\n\nThis is all possible because of the other major player and who this record features in the guitar god himself with Iommi. It is hard not to appreciate the riffs on display and the song arrangements leave plenty of room for Hughes to do his magic. The title track stands out as a top song because of the gloomy atmosphere and once the background hymns kick in with the chorus; it never fails to send a shiver up my spine. Iommi lets his blues background shine in \u201cHeart Like a Wheel\u201d and the combo to round out the album in \u201cAngry Heart\u201d and \u201cIn Memory\u2026\u201d leave memorable guitar parts. The former also has some acceptable keyboard parts provided by Geoff Nicholls and the build-up of the riff to the vocal lines is impressive. I love the contrast provided as it segues into \u201cIn Memory\u2026\u201d with the depressing acoustic guitar and the way Hughes says \u201cIt\u2019s still haunting me\u201d really makes the listener feel his pain and regret.\n\nThe only clunker is \u201cNo Stranger to Love\u201d with its cheesy synths, cheesier lyrics, and sounds very eighties. This has no place on a Sabbath record, Iommi record, or any record for that matter. The guys are much more capable than this. Funny enough, this deluxe edition includes a bonus track of this song presented as an alternate version. The song is worthless in both formats, but the music video is good for a chuckle.\n\nThe other songs that resemble the eighties are \u201cTurn to Stone\u201d and \u201cDanger Zone.\u201d They are both straight ahead rockers that some would say have a glam edge, but the songs have some delicious riffs. \u201cDanger Zone\u201d is the stronger song due to some awesome drumming by Singer and complimented by a trademark solo by Iommi. The way the guitar jumps out the riff in the middle is a nice touch added.\n\n\u201cSeventh Star\u2019s\u201d second disc is a concert taken from the Hammersmith Odeon with Gillen on vocals along with Spitz and Singer. Gillen took over for Hughes because of his massive drug problem and he suffered an injury which caused him to not be able to sing very well. This concert is basically a glorified bootleg, so the sound isn\u2019t strong, but it is nice to have Gillen featured on a Sabbath release and the guy has a great voice.\n\nGillen has the energy and passion of Ronnie James Dio, but he also can conjure up demons and doom like Ozzy Osbourne could. He sounds more natural on the Dio songs as songs like \u201cMob Rules\u201d and \u201cNeon Knight\u201d seems more suited to his style. However, on the tracks \u201cWar Pigs\u201d and \u201cBlack Sabbath\u201d he sings with a higher tone because of his wide range, but he makes it work and keep the spirit of the original intact. In fact, his performance on \u201cBlack Sabbath\u201d is remarkable because he sounds strangely similar to Osbourne in the beginning and the way his voice changes with a slight growl in when the song picks up shows he can be very diverse.\n\nThis extra concert is also a neat extra because you can hear two songs that will most likely not be heard in concert again in \u201cDanger Zone\u201d and \u201cSeventh Star.\u201d They work well in the live setting, especially the latter song. The keyboards are also more prominent in these songs as well as the whole concert.\n\nBlack Sabbath was in a time of great change in this period, but it still results in a good album. It is not Iommi\u2019s best, but it has a lot of strong songs to take great enjoyment too. The deluxe edition also has plenty of pictures and the story of how this record came to be. The live concert with Gillen should provide extra incentive to procure this copy. The sound has been improved a little bit, though the bass could have been nudged up, but the sound levels are consistent and retain its balance. This would not the last collaboration between Hughes and Iommi as his guitar playing along with Hughes\u2019 voice are a perfect match. The title on the cover is strange, but any Sabbath fan should take a dive into this album that features Tony Iommi. \n\nnicksmetal.blogspot.com\n",
        "\n**Note: This is a review of the 2011 Deluxe Edition** \n\nBlack Sabbath was back into rebuilding mode after the mighty Ronnie James Dio and drummer Vinny Appice left the band due to some miscommunication and poor handling of the \u201cLive Evil\u201d album. Tony Iommi went into his bag of tricks and turned heads with the announcement of Ian Gillan coming into the Sabbath fold. Purple and black mixed together sounded intriguing and it culminated in the release of \u201cBorn Again\u201d with the one of the most infamous artwork ever created. The demon baby from hell is definitely eye catching and may also induce vomiting, like Gillan stated when talking about the cover. Finally, after all these years of trying to find a reliable copy, a deluxe edition was bestowed upon the masses in 2011 with the baby in all its glory along with a studio outtake and a live show from the Reading Festival in 1983.\n\nThe most noticeable aspect of the original release of \u201cBorn Again\u201d was the poor production which had a very flat sound and muddy guitars. The deluxe edition remedies the problem as much as it could as the original tapes could not be found, but there are some noticeable improvements as each instrument is distinguished as the drums give a sharper snap, bass lines are recognized, and Iommi\u2019s guitar is clearer. \n\nAs for the songs themselves, it\u2019s like Sabbath received a shot to the system. Ozzy Osbourne and Dio never really used their voices wildly like Gillan does here. He carries an attitude and does not use his screams judiciously. In the opening moments of \u201cTrashed\u201d, Gillan sends a shriek to announce that he means business. The track itself is a solid opener featuring a driving riff with Gillan seeming to enjoy himself singing about how he took Bill Ward\u2019s car for a joyride and wrecked it. \n\nIommi pays back Gillan\u2019s eagerness by conjuring up some of his most sinister riffs. The crashing cymbal and snare provided by Ward act as a crescendo to Iommi\u2019s hellish guitar in \u201cDisturbing the Priest.\u201d Gillan laughs like a madman and provides some vocal theatrics to one of the standout tracks. Iommi provides another gem with the most famous song from this album, \u201cZero the Hero.\u201d The song seems like the successor to \u201cIron Man\u201d as they both have that signature riff, interesting characters, and are very memorable.\n\nThe meld of Deep Purple and Sabbath comes into play with the final tracks \u201cHot Line\u201d and \u201cKeep it Warm.\u201d The titles don\u2019t exactly seem something one would see on a Black Sabbath album, but with Gillan penning the lyrics, there are some tongue-in-cheek sexual moments, but it works well with the content. Iommi lets the blues roll on the latter track featuring a great jam at the end with him, Geezer Butler, and Ward letting it fly. \u201cHot Line\u201d has the as expected energetic vocal performance and a very catchy riff to knock your head to. Iommi nails down a gritty solo to round out a very cool song.\n\nThe only truly weak song is the goofy titled \u201cDigital Bitch.\u201d The vocal lines are weak and the guitar isn\u2019t as strong. It does not help both as the chorus is not memorable and hearing Gillan sing these lyrics as well as the song title is too silly to take seriously. The title track also just falls short of being very memorable as it has a slow, dooming atmosphere, but it does not go anywhere. It has potential, but a stronger chorus and more interesting instrumentation could have helped. The last bit of quibbles is the two little tracks of sound effects in \u201cStonehenge\u201d and \u201cThe Dark.\u201d \u201cStonehenge\u201d has eerie effects similar to \u201cE5150\u201d and then segues into \u201cDisturbing the Priest\u201d, but serves little purpose and \u201cThe Dark\u201d is some low, strange noises that transition into \u201cZero the Hero.\u201d This leaves only seven actual songs on the album.\n\nApart from the record is the gem on the second disc of this deluxe edition. There is a studio outtake of a song called \u201cThe Fallen\u201d which shows Ward flexing his muscles on the drums and the guitar puts together competent notes when it hits the chorus. An extended version of \u201cStonehenge\u201d is also included and it\u2019s basically three more minutes of eerie, spacey sounds.\n\nThe live concert at the Reading Festival is when business picks up. All I can say is Gillan is a beast singing the Sabbath classics. His performances of \u201cIron Man\u201d, \u201cWar Pigs\u201d and \u201cParanoid\u201d are stellar. He unleashes spine-tingling screams to go along with the riffs in instrumental parts and injects new life to tracks associated with Osbourne. These moments make me wish that this lineup stayed together, but then \u201cPerfect Strangers\u201d would not have happened. \n\nBev Bevan filled in for Ward on the tour and does a competent job. He does not have all the groovy fills that Ward provides, but he certainly did not detract from the performance. \u201cWar Pigs\u201d gives the indication that he knows what he\u2019s doing. \n\nThe \u201cBorn Again\u201d tracks receive some good pub too as \u201cHot Line\u201d comes across well, but I was not too fond of \u201cDigital Bitch\u201d in the set. \u201cZero the Hero\u201d retains oozy guitar and a wonderful solo from Iommi. In the encore, the boys throw a nod to Gillan\u2019s previous band by pumping out \u201cSmoke on the Water.\u201d I could only imagine how awesome it was seeing the Sabbath guys playing a Purple classic with Gillan. The crowd was electric during this performance and definitely gives that feeling of wanting to be there.\n\nThe deluxe edition of \u201cBorn Again\u201d also contains notes on the album came into being and also an essay by the man who created that darn devil baby explaining its origin and how it was accepted as the design. The live show is worth the purchase alone and serves as a time capsule for that period of Black Sabbath. Any fan curious of this collaboration and looking to finally get their hands on this album should take the plunge into Purple Sabbath.\n\nnicksmetal.blogspot.com\n",
        "\nI was twelve. I had a little-VERY little-experience with metal (four Metallica albums) but I had never gone any further. I came across a copy of Paranoid at a local used-CD store and got it even before having heard any material, just because its reputation preceded it. I was NOT disappointed. \n\nProduction is pretty awful by today's standards, but when you think about the year it was released, the short time it was recorded over and the ridiculously low budget, that's certainly excusable. It's not as well-done as some of Led Zeppelin's work, or Sabbath's next few albums, but the lackluster production doesn't hinder the music terribly. (Well, except the bass. Practically inaudible.) \n\nThe music itself is absolutely awe-inspiring. Back Sabbath's self-titled debut was inconsistent, but there's no fucking around here-with the exception of Planet Caravan, every track here is pure metal, and every song (except the strange, polarizing Electric Funeral and the shamefully underrated Hand of Doom) is a legend. The atmosphere is consistently dark, it just varies in different levels of darkness. Even the least eerie song (Paranoid) is pretty damn heavy. Songwriting is guaranteed to satisfy, dealing with subject matter such as greed (War Pigs) mental instability (Paranoid) and at times, seemingly nothing in particular (Electric Funeral). \n\nOzzy Osbourne's voice is, as even the most die-hard fan will tell you, fucking terrible. Raspy and annoying, this man can truly grate on your nerves-which is why he was PERFECT for this album. The lyrics could not fit his high, nasally voice any better. Tony Iommi's sludgy guitar work amazingly compliments the dark lyrics and slow tempos that most of the songs adhere to. Tony is the best kind of guitarist-simple, yet brilliant. The riff on Iron Man is unforgettable, rivaled only by Smoke On the Water (which I think is a horribly overrated song, but that's another story) in terms of influence. Geezer is a great bassist-too bad that slightly shitty production drowns him out on several of the songs. However, his work on the tracks where it is actually noticeable (Hand of Doom, Paranoid, War Pigs) is stellar. \n\nSong structure does, at times, seem formulaic-for better or for worse. Slow, heavy opening riff, two verses and two choruses, then the tempo speeds up and Tony plays his solo. This is certainly a winning equation, but only works so much. About half the songs use this format, just barely the right amount that it isn't overused. Paranoid is the only consistently up-tempo song on the album, and is reminiscent of some of Led Zeppelin's songs-especially Communication Breakdown. Planet Caravan is very \"stoner\", with light guitar, a catchy little \"riff\", unusual lyrics, and a whispered delivery by Ozzy. Rat Salad and Jack the Stripper are out of place but not awful, though they are hardly memorable compared to some of the album's other tracks. \n\nI feel the need to identify two tracks on the album, for very different reasons. One is Electric Funeral, a song that garners some praise-not quite \"legendary\" praise, mind you, but some-and for the life of me I CAN'T FUCKING UNDERSTAND WHY. I even have a friend who claims this is Sabbath's best song. (This same friend fiercely defended St Anger in an argument, though, so......anyway, that too is another story.) This song, to me, sounds like a CARBON COPY of the excellent War Pigs, but with retarded lyrics; it doesn't follow a similar format to the one I mentioned above, it abuses that formula. This is the only truly weak song on Paranoid, and ultimately drags the score down a bit. The other track that warrants an Honorable Mention is Hand of Doom. This song is brushed off by many as-and there is no possible explanation for this-the WORST SONG on Paranoid. This track starts out with a great, memorable bassline, and MUCH better lyrics than Electric Fuckery. One part of why people seem to dislike Hand of Doom is the tempo change, and admittedly it is VERY jarring. The first time I listened to the album, I thought it was a completely different track. But that's not enough to ruin the song. It doesn't \"become crappy\", it just \"changes abruptly\". I find it to be incredibly fun to listen to and jam to, and it is my personal favorite on the album. \n\nUltimately, as far as albums go, this one is about as close to flawless as they come. Only one bad track, and plenty of classics to make you forget that one. This is REQUIRED LISTENING for all metal fans, along with such other classics as Number of the Beast, Master of Puppets, Ace of Spades, and Painkiller. In fact, this album is BETTER than any of those in my humble opinion. It will be remembered through the ages as an indispensable gem of the metal genre.\n",
        "\nThere are some groups of people who when they get together, are bound to deliver quality. Be it the coordination among themselves coupled with their talents, you can see a spark, a striking superior quality compared to that of their peers. OK the group may have differences, ego problems, may even split, but be what may, they are an integral part of each other, and when they are together, they are bound to shake the world. The group of Tony Iommi, Ronnie James Dio and Geezer Butler is one such iconic group. Though having just a couple of albums together prior to this one, there can be no denying the fire these guys brought with them. So Tony Iommi, with limited success with Tony Martin (No offense against Martin, he is a terrific vocalist), decided to go for a reunion. Totally abandoning the power metal direction Iommi had taken since Dio's arrival, the band takes a dark, heavy and punishing road which can be dated back to the days when Tony Iommi single-handedly revolutionized the art of heavy riffing. \n\nTechnically the band is in awesome form. Tony Iommi proves just why he is the God of heavy riffs. The riffs are slow, heavy and crushing and majestically interwoven into each other. It feels as if you have been hit by a dozen of jackhammers on your head. The vocals are truly spectacular; an insane combination of spite, rage and fear mixed together in a glorious manner. If ever there was a doubt about Dio singing aggressively, it is put to rest here. He snarls, shrieks, roars and croons effectively adding a bleak and unpleasant colour to the music, a stark contrast from his Children Of The Sea days. Geezer is in great form himself with his grim bass lines providing for a perfect backdrop in the bleak scenario. The production is raw and punishing, with the rhythm guitar having a crisp and crunchy sound to it. The rest of the elements aren't ignored, and the vocals, drums and bass are balanced perfectly in.\n\nThe album comprises of ten spectacular tracks rooted down in pure doom metal. The consistency of the album is quite high; high so much so that this might be their most consistent album ever. A dark, sludgy and many a times an angry atmosphere decorates this album throughout its duration. The songs are catchy enough to be appreciated at the first listen and the choruses are creative and powerful. The lyrics are simple, yet powerful and go well along with the general bleak atmosphere of the record. The songwriting is simple and straight-forward, yet displaying a matured sense of musicianship which can only be achieved by veterans. Mostly the songs are constructed around a single or at most two riffs but are arranged cleverly enough to ensure that the song remains powerful throughout it's duration. The song length is perfectly balanced and is utilized well for most of the time. Low points in the album are few and between. Just somewhere between Time Machine, Sins Of The Father and Too Late, the album loses its steam which it has picked up. But fortunately the lows are not too low and are far few and between to be ignored. \n\nThis album deserves a worthy mention among the very best of Black Sabbath with such gems as Sabotage, Master Of Reality, Heaven And Hell, Tyr. Bottom-line, this album is a must listen for every fan of heavy metal. It is a shame that this album came out during the dark ages and failed to receive the attention it deserves.\n",
        "\nAlthough I would likely point the finger at King Crimson's \"21st Century Schizoid Man\" as the harbinger of 'heavy' in heavy metal, there's absolutely no denying what a massive impact Black Sabbath's self-titled debut had on the formation of the genre. With that context in mind, there's no wonder why it's still considered a classic by many, forty-odd years after its release. It is a lumbering, ugly hard rock record with strong ties to the blues and the occult, and though Black Sabbath do not impress near as much here as they would with the essential \"Paranoid\", its historical significance alone warrants a listen.\n\n\"Paranoid\" would solidify the band's take on heavy metal, but the rich distortion and 'evil' tone have been nailed from square one. At this point, I might liken Black Sabbath to Led Zeppelin's first two albums. Though rooted in the American blues style that swept through the British hard rock scene at this time, the aggression has toned up several notches. In the case of Sabbath- and arguably what most sets them apart- is their devotion to a dark atmosphere. The infamous 'tritone' is upheld from the very start; the title track \"Black Sabbath\" opens with an unforgettably doomy riff, and vocals to foreshadow impending damnation. The title track sets a standard for doom metal that many bands still compete with.\n\nThe distorted riffs are a constant throughout \"Black Sabbath\", but the songwriting feels more at home with its time period after the title track. \"The Wizard\" through \"Sleeping Village\" are all rocking tracks that make no effort to hide the heavy blues influence. Of these, \"The Wizard\" and \"N.I.B\" stand out, the former for its deep harmonica work and fantastic riffs, and the latter for its superb bass work, courtesy of Geezer Butler. \"The Warning\" brings Sabbath back to a more epic format, relying heavily still on bluesy riffs, but taking the structure a step further, and giving Iommi plenty of time for fiery solos that draw a parallel to Jimmy Page's lead style.\n\nAlthough I loved his vocals on \"Paranoid\" and have been impressed by some of his performances thereafter, Ozzy Osbourne feels like the weak link on the debut. His nasal vocal tone fits the eerie atmosphere, but his voice feels unrefined and unkempt. Of course, this fits the description of the rest of Black Sabbath, but in the case of Ozzy's voice, it doesn't bode well. With the exception of the first two tracks and the catchy \"Evil Woman\", the vocal melodies feel tacked on without too much thought.\n\nIt's not the masterpiece that Black Sabbath would craft later the same year, but for the fact alone that they were able to revolutionize hard rock music within a single album, the debut deserves to be heard. Tony Iommi takes centerstage in everything the band does here, and though the songwriting does not feel as consistent or focused as they would for the two following records, the band's gritty sound and influence cannot be underestimated.\n",
        "\nAlthough guitarist Tony Iommi has always been the heart of Black Sabbath, an album with three quarters of the band missing doesn't quite qualify as a Sabbath album. Of course, the band had not suddenly split up. Rather, \"Seventh Star\" was supposed to be a solo album from Tony, not the latest disappointment from the masters that once brought us some of metal's best records. Even looking past this obvious oversight, \"Seventh Star\" is an undercooked piece of melodic hard rock. With weak production, generic riffs, and only a handful of decent songs, Black Sabbath have another bland album to their name.\n\nThis certainly isn't the first time I have found Black Sabbath short of quality, but \"Seventh Star\" feels even moreso out-of-place than other weaker albums like \"Never Say Die!\" or the more recent \"Born Again\". Of course, Iommi never intended for this to sound like his flagship band. Instead of their trademark doom or metal grit, this incarnation of 'Sabbath' emphasizes melody and bluesy soloing over anything. If I had to compare it to anything else in the band's discography, I might point the finger at the more streamlined sounds of \"Technical Ecstasy\", or perhaps even a de-clawed, anaesthetized \"Mob Rules\". After Ian Gillan's tenure with the band passed on as a failed experiment, we are introduced to Glenn Hughes, who- like Gillan- is better known for his work with Deep Purple. Compared to the vocalists who have contributed under the Sabbath banner before him, Hughes' voice feels like a vanilla, run-of-the-mill hard rock vocalist. His higher register is admirable, but he lacks both the distinctive charisma of Ozzy, and the acrobatic precision of Gillan and Dio.\n\nAs far as songwriting goes, the title track is quite good, enjoying soulful guitar leads and a memorable chorus. Uninspired composition is more of the rule here however; very rarely does it ever go beyond the call of duty. By-the-numbers song structures, flat melodies and average riffs are what define \"Seventh Star\". Even the rhythm section (performed here by bassist Dave Spitz and drummer Eric Singer) seem to do the acceptable minimum. Thankfully, Iommi has given himself some good room to work his guitar, and this is what saves \"Seventh Star\" from a final resting place as a coffee coaster in metalhead living rooms around the world. Of course, the 'riffs' themselves are bland and simple, but his lead work brings the feeling that the rest of the album seems to miss entirely. Unlike a regular Black Sabbath release, Iommi can ideally take all the time he wants to play leads, and though it still doesn't happen nearly enough on \"Seventh Star\", it makes me think that a pure Iommi guitar album would have been something great. As it stands, we have another chapter in Black Sabbath's history that is best left alone.\n",
        "\nBy all means, a collaboration between Black Sabbath and Ian Gillan should have ruled. Sabbath had spurred the heavy metal sound, and Gillan had dished out some of hard rock's most enduring records with Deep Purple. Not only that, but Sabbath now had a precedent to become awesome with a new vocalist. Dio's induction led to \"Heaven And Hell\", the album that saved the band from crippling mediocrity. \"Born Again\" has no such luck, however. The songwriting standards are back to the way they were with \"Technical Ecstasy\", and for whatever reason, Gillan's vocals to not fit nearly as well as they should have. \"Born Again\" is a disappointing chapter in the band's history.\n\nAlthough not as articulate as Dio, Ian Gillan had an amazing voice throughout the 70's. Particularly in his shrieking falsettos, there is no doubt that he was one of his era's vocal greats when it came to hard rock. Listening to his performance on \"Child In Time\" from Deep Purple's \"In Rock\" album makes it clear that his haunting voice would have worked well with Sabbath's relatively dark sound. Although many argue that his bluesy style does not fit with the heavier sound that Black Sabbath goes for, it could have been incredible. Sadly this potential is far from realized; the whole thing sounds underbudgeted and generally uninspired. Gillan's falsettos sound great for the most part, but the songwriting falls flat for the most part. Barring the moments where he sets his voice on fire, Gillan's performance feels like he doesn't care about the music, and who can blame him? The composition falls flat more often than not; there isn't a melody of riff that sticks after the album's over.\n\nThe biggest fault here is undoubtedly the production and mixing. Apparently, the rough cuts were accidentally published rather than the refined mix, and if that is true, it's a pretty juvenile slip-up for a veteran band to make. The album sounds like a rough demo, or a work-in-progress. As a result, the more upbeat 'rock' tracks are completely unenjoyable to listen to, with only Gillan's shrieks clambering above the mess. However, something very unexpected happens as a by-product of this. Also thanks in part to Gillan's eerie falsettos, this is the darkest Sabbath have sounded since the debut. The slower tunes and ambient interludes are actually pretty good, and the lo-fi sludge gives it a diabolical atmosphere that I might compare to some black metal. \"Disturbing The Priest\" and \"Zero The Hero\" rekindle this evil sound. Further proof that not everything is black or white, especially when it comes to music.\n\n\"Born Again\"s creepy vibe is not near enough to save it from being considered one of Sabbath's weakest efforts, sadly. Taking into account the fact that most of the album still defaults on conventional hard rock songwriting, it becomes nearly unlistenable when paired with a production that sounds like it was engineered by a studio intern. It might be worth checking out for Ian Gillan friends, but this is a chapter in Black Sabbath's history that is best left forgotten.\n",
        "\nFirst off let it be known that this compilation only takes you as far as 1994 of Ronnie James Dio's storied career. It was released in 2003 so nothing from Dio's last LP (\"Master Of The Moon\") or the Black Sabbath reunion aka \"Heaven & hell\" could even be considered. This is Elf until the end of Ronnie's Warner Bros. contract in 1994 (the LP \"Strange Highways).\n\nIt's no surprise Rhino wanted another Dio compilation since 2000's mighty fine 16-track \"The Very Beast Of Dio\" collection sold over 500,000 copies in the U.S. (Gold certification in the U.S.). It was culled strictly from the band \"Dio\" and was the first North American \"best of\" (the import \"Diamonds: The Best Of\" had been available since 1994). Instead of doing \"The Very Beast Of, Vol. 2\", which they certainly could considering many many Dio tracks didn't fit on the first collection, they opted to compile Ronnie James Dio's career from his band Elf, through Rainbow, through Black Sabbath, through the Dio band. They decided to attempt this within the space of two compact discs (160 minutes max and Rhino admirably filled approximately 153 minutes worth).\n\nSo how did they do? Rhino usually nails it on their choices and they did pretty darn good on \"Stand Up And Shout: The Anthology\". It's obvious some knowledgeable people were involved with the selection. Of the 29 cuts here 3 come from the band Elf, three from Rainbow, eight from Black Sabbath and fifteen from the Dio band(s).\n\nDISC 1\nEven though the music of Elf, a bluesy, rock'n boogie band, isn't what Dio became famous for the Rhino team, for the sake of being thorough, picked three songs from two of the three Elf albums (\"Hoochie Koochie Lady\" & \"I'm Coming Back To You\" from \"ELF\" and \"Carolina Country Ball\" from the album of the same name, re-titled \"L.A. 59\" in the USA. Nothing from the final Elf LP, \"Trying To Burn The Sun\" is included). Personally, I would have rather Elf been excluded altogether and the collection begin with Rainbow, but that's just my take on it. The three Elf songs are cute but nothing special.\n\nNext up are the Rainbow years. Here is where Rhino makes it's first mistake. Not including live albums, Rainbow made three albums- one of which, \"Rainbow Rising\", is considered a Metal masterpiece. Rhino did pick one from each LP- three essential cuts, 'The Man On The Silver Mountain\", \"Starstruck\" & \"Long Live Rock & Roll\", but \"Sixteenth Century Greensleeves\" & \"Stargazer\" should have been included, perhaps in place of the Elf tracks. Or they could have cut one of the Black Sabbath tracks. Again, though, there's only so much space and Metal tracks are usually long so....it is what it is.\n\nThe Black Sabbath pics are nearly perfect. Three from \"Heaven & Hell\" (title cut, \"Neon Knights\", \"Children Of The Sea\"), three from \"The Mob Rules\" (title cut, \"Sign Of The Southern Cross\", \"Turn Up The Night\") and one from \"Dehumanizer\" (\"Computer God\"). In addition there's a rare live version (not from the the infamous \"Live Evil\" but from the 1982 \"Mob Rules\" tour) of \"H&H's\" \"Voodoo\" included. Nice as that may be they could have included another \"Dehumanizer\" track (such as \"I\") or one of the missing Rainbow songs instead. Afterall, this collection is not a \"rarities\" collection so baiting the hook with one or two is a bit obnoxious.\n\nDisc 1 closes with another rarity, a ripping version of \"Sacred Heart\" from the VHS-only (so-far) \"Sacred Heart-The Video\" release (rather than the mediocre 'Intermission\" EP- a stopgap 6-cut release foisted on the public between Dio's proper albums in 1986). A better rarity and better bait would have been the studio cut \"Hide In The Rainbow\", which was only released on \"The Dio EP\" during the \"Sacred Heart\" tour. The track has since been released on the bonus disc from the Deluxe Edition re-issue of \"Sacred Heart\"\n\nDISC 2\nRather than just copy the tracklist from \"The Very Beast Of Dio\" Rhino swaps a few tracks for a few not included on \"Beast\". \n\nFirstly, from the stone classic LP \"Holy Diver\" we are served up a healthy five tracks (title cut, \"Rainbow In The Dark\", \"Stand Up And Shout\", \"Straight Through The Heart\" & \"Don't Talk To Strangers\"), all but one (\"Don't Talk To Strangers\") of which were included on \"Beast\". From \"The Last In Line\" comes three cuts (title song, \"We Rock\" & \"Egypt (The Chains Are On)\"). The UK hit \"Mystery\" is dropped in place of \"Egypt\". Though a better song I think \"Mystery\" should've remained being it was so popular. Being that a live version of \"Sacred Heart\" was included on disc 1 two more obvious songs from the LP \"Sacred Heart\" are here (\"King Of Rock & Roll\", \"Hungry For Heaven\"). This is the second gaffe. The missing \"Rock And Roll Children\" (included on \"Beast\") was Dio's biggest hit single (#26 in the UK). \n\nAnother mistake comes with the \"Dream Evil\" LP selection. While the great title cut and \"All The Fools Sail Away\" are included the hit \"I Could Have Been A Dreamer\" is not. At this point it seems clear that Rhino wanted this new compilation to be somewhat supplementary to \"The Very Beast Of\". My theory is a bit stymied though by the fact the final two songs from Dio's final two Reprise LPs, \"Lock Up The Wolves\" & \"Strange Highways\") are the same as on \"Beast\", ie, the title track of each album. There were plenty of worthy tracks they could have swapped these for and been forgiven (\"Wild One\", \"Hey Angel\", \"Jesus, Mary & The Holy Ghost\", etc..).\n\nNow that they've released \"Black Sabbath: The Dio Years\" Rhino should do a 2 disc set on JUST the Dio band years. \"Stand Up And Shout\" was doomed from the start. Too much material for two discs. A good effort but ultimately flawed.\n",
        "\nThis 2 disc compilation is the first collection that covers nearly his entire career from his time with Elf, through Rainbow, through Black Sabbath, through Dio (band) to his last days with Heaven & Hell (Black Sabbath). Rhino's decent 2 Disc \"Stand Up And Shout: The Anthology\" stopped short at his final Warner Brothers LP (\"Strange Highways) but is a better overall (but still flawed) set since there's some glaring omissions on \"Mightier Than The Sword\" that were logically included on the Rhino set (\"The Last In Line\" being the most shocking). Only those not familiar with all the albums Dio was involved with will be pleased with this sampler. It does give a more comprehensive portrait of the man's career but it simply is not possible to fit all the essential tracks from Elf to H & H on two discs (not even three could cut it). It earns a point for including one track from his guest work on Roger Glover's \"The Butterfly Ball & The Grasshopper's Feast\" (\"Love Is All\") , which was ignored by the Rhino set but loses more points for omitting the most popular Rainbow track (\"The Man On The Silver Mountain\") and some essential Dio band tracks (\"Stand Up And Shout\", \"The Last In Line\", \"Hungry For Heaven\", \"Dream Evil\", \"Lock Up The Wolves\", etc.. Now, being that there was limited space only the absence of \"The Last In Line\" is completely unforgivable. They chose only \"We Rock\" from the \"The Last In Line\" album instead but since the disc clocks in at only 69+ minutes space was left for atleast one more track and \"The Last In Line\" is a no brainer!)\n\nElf was not a metal band but a boogie-woogie blues rock band so not much is needed despite three full albums being recorded by the group. It's not who Dio became and not what made him famous. Only \"Carolina Country Ball\" from the LP of the same name represents Elf of the 27 tracks offered here. After The Glover track that follows comes the Rainbow years- represented by a surprising 8 tracks. While the great \"Stargazer\", \"Catch The Rainbow\" & \"Run With The Wolf\" are here where is \"The Man On The Silver Mountain\" for crying out loud?!\n\nThe first two Black Sabbath stint is represented by six tracks (\"Heaven & Hell\", \"The Mob Rules\", \"Children Of The Sea\", \"Voodoo\", \"Die Young\" & \"Country Girl\"). This is acceptable even though \"Die Young\" & \"Country Girl\" could have been replaced with \"The Sign Of The Southern Cross\" & \"Turn Up The Night\" and made it slightly better. There's nothing from the infamous \"Live Evil\" set but \"Neon Nights\" appears later being the live version from Heaven & Hell's 2007 tour and subsequent album/DVD \"Live From The Radio City Music Hall\".\n\nNext up is the Dio band years. Not including the weak live EP \"Intermission\" Ronnie's namesake band released five albums before Ronnie rejoined Black Sabbath. Those five Dio albums are represented by a paltry five tracks. Two from \"Holy Diver\" (title track, \"Rainbow In The Dark\"). one from \"The Last In Line\" (\"We Rock\"), one from \"Sacred Heart\" (\"Rock And Roll Children\"), one from \"Dream Evil\" (\"All The Fools Sailed Away\") and nothing from \"Lock Up The Wolves\". Now while all five of these tracks belong here more tracks from these albums should have been chosen in place of too many Rainbow tracks (based on the premise something would have to be cut to make room).\n\nThe Black Sabbath reunion LP \"Dehumanizer\" is represented by \"I\" (not a bad choice even though \"Computer God\" is better) and then three more Dio band albums are completely ignored (yep, nothing at all from \"Strange Highways\", \"Angry Machines\" & \"Magica\") as the collection jumps to 2002's \"Push\" from the album \"Killing The Dragon\" followed by \"One More For The Road\" from the LP \"Master Of The Moon\". While these were the logical choices for the \"KTD\" & MOTM\" albums \"Magica\" deserved at least one track here (such as \"Fever Dreams\") instead of \"Shadow Of The Wind\", one of three tracks recorded by H&H for the \"Black Sabbath: The Dio Years\" compilation. Then comes the aforementioned live \"Neon Knights\", the penultimate track before we get to the fantastic final cut, \"Bible Black\". It was the best pick from an overall great album by Heaven & Hell, entitled \"The Devil You Know\" in 2009- one year prior to Ronnie James Dio's death.\n\nThe first lesson is that you shouldn't try to cram onto two discs a career that consisted of over 20 studio albums, many live albums and guest appearances. The second is that if you're gonna try find someone hip who will narrow it down to the bare essentials. Sometimes they got it right (\"Stargazer\", \"Heaven & Hell\", \"The Mob Rules\", \"Holy Diver\", \"Rock And Roll Children\", \"Push\" & \"Bible Black) and often they got it wrong (leaving off \"Man On The Silver Mountain\", having too many Rainbow tracks, the omission of \"The Last In Line\", \"Hungry For Heaven\" and nothing at all from four Dio albums: \"Lock Up The Wolves\", \"Strange Highways\", \"Angry Machines\" & \"Magica\").\n\nAll in all. Another incomplete \"best of\" comp that will have a short shelf life until someone does it right with a four disc box set.\n",
        "\nSabbath's \"Heaven And Hell\" not only brought their music into a new decade, it also saved them from an inevitable death. The two final albums of the Ozzy era were a sharp boot in the face to the six albums prior that had built the band up as one of the most respected in hard rock and heavy metal. With a new singer and more upbeat sound, Black Sabbath were reinvigorated, and \"Heaven And Hell\" enjoyed the first sounds of inspiration Black Sabbath had felt in a couple of years. \"Mob Rules\" doesn't necessarily push this new sound any further, but it proves that \"Heaven And Hell\" was not a fluke. Although not quite as consistent as its predecessor, \"Mob Rules\" is a great way to wrap up the first Dio era. \n\nAs was the case on \"Heaven And Hell\", the addition of vocalist Ronnie James Padavona changes the band's sound more than I would have expected. Although Sabbath's style had fluctuated a bit during the Ozzy era, the songwriting had generally been based around thick, heavy riffs, courtesy of Tony Iommi and his distinct approach to the guitar. Although Iommi's trademark doom did peek its head up occasionally, it sounded more like Dio's future solo career than anything the band had done in the past. \"Mob Rules\" does not deviate much from this course, but a little more of the traditional Sabbath cracks through. \"Country Girl\" is fueled by an incendiary Iommi riff that wouldn't have sounded out of place on \"Master of Reality\". \"The Sign of the Southern Cross\" is another song where Sabbath harken back to their more downtempo roots. For the most part however, Sabbath go for faster-paced metal tunes; \"Turn Up The NIght\" and the title track \"The Mob Rules\" are both memorable exercises in fire and brimstone.\n\nAlthough I would have thought Black Sabbath were defined by the riffs, it's remarkable how much the music has changed with replacement vocalist Ronnie James Dio. While I thought Ozzy Osbourne had some great pipes on some of their earlier albums, Dio's voice is notably more powerful, effortlessly pulling off operatic belts that would have made Ozzy cower. With that being said, I think Ozzy's drug-addled charm could have added something to these songs that Dio's flamboyant delivery does not. As far as skill is concerned, Sabbath have certainly benefited from the vocal replacement, but Sabbath sound less distinctive than they used to, and a little more like the horde of their contemporary metal bands.\n\n\"Mob Rules\" is not the remarkable statement that \"Heaven And Hell\" was, if only for the fact that \"Heaven\" did it first. Although it does sound as if Sabbath are trying to recall a little of their past sound here, it is for the most part a recreation of the previous album, albeit less consistent and powerful. Suffice to say, Ronnie James Dio brings a very different angle to Black Sabbath, and though I do not find this material to be as memorable as the Ozzy material, this era is a refreshing new sound for one of heavy metal's greatest bands.\n",
        "\nBy this point in Black Sabbath's career, the album title seems to be a pretty spot-on indication of the band themselves realizing they were losing it. The band's past work \"Technical Ecstasy\" wasn't necessarily a bad album, but in the context of following six classics of heavy metal, it could only disappoint. Of course, based on what I had heard from others, I was not expecting much different from \"Never Say Die!\", the last album Black Sabbath would do before being revived by the vocal talents of the late Ronnie James. Although it's relieving to know that Sabbath would yet release some great material with Dio, \"Never Say Die!\" is a whimper, arguably even less successful than \"Technical Ecstasy\". Once again, Black Sabbath may not be total goners here, but they might as well be; the band's eighth studio album is one that should be overlooked.\n\nStylistically, Black Sabbath developed and tweaked their sound quite a bit within a few years, exploring heavy metal, progressive rock, and everything in between. Although it was no surprise to hear Sabbath doing something new in \"Technical Ecstasy\", their new, more straightforward hard rock style was void of both the heaviness and sophistication that defined each earlier album. \"Never Say Die!\" continues this lackluster rock sound, although the music is arguably even worse off. It's no secret that Black Sabbath had been going through some problems over the years leading up to this, and it's evident that the constant arguing and drug excess had gone too far. Although Sabbath still manage to cobble together a functional collection of songs, the performance feels muffled, and the songwriting seemingly done out of obligation rather than inspiration.\n\n\"Johnny Blade\" is a perfect example of how far Sabbath had fallen. Although it still shares Iommi's thick riffing style and Ozzy's nasal vocals in common with an album like \"Paranoid\", nothing really stands out as being impressive, or even that much enjoyable. Whether the blame may be pointed towards the muffled production or the paint-by-numbers approach to his rock riffs, Tony Iommi feels like a declawed lion here, his usual genius with the guitar clouded by ambivalence and 'x' number of different drugs they were taking at the time. Even Ozzy's vocals- which had blown me away only years earlier with his delivery on \"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\" and \"Sabotage\"- are strained and lifeless.\n\n\"Never Say Die!\" is not without its merits, of course. In particular, the song \"Air Dance\" is a refreshing break from the boring hard rock formula, taking in some unique jazz structures in a piece which could have fit into the band's 'prog' era easily. \"Break Out\" is also an interesting song, taking the jazz approach further with a big band arrangement and brilliant saxophone solo. These moments feel very out-of-place in the context of an album that sounds as if the band had given up on trying to progress their music any further. \"Heaven & Hell\" would hear the band playing with a revived vigour. \"Never Say Die!\" is fortunately not the end for Sabbath, but it's a dismal way to end the classic line-up for one of the greatest bands in rock history.\n",
        "\nBlack Sabbath have made some of the best heavy metal albums I've ever heard. Both \"Paranoid\" and \"Sabotage\" have claimed their rightful thrones as masterpieces, and even the relative 'lesser' of Sabbath's early works were still excellent. Alas, the band hit a brick wall, the brick in this analogy representing a ton of drugs and petty argument. By \"Never Say Die!\", Black Sabbath ironically felt dead, not in an atmospheric or morose way, but in that it was clear that music was no longer their number one priority. With this, Ozzy Osbourne left to pursue a successful solo career, and a Mr. Ronnie James Dio came into play. Then best known for his work in Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow, Dio's operatic style was a sharp contrast to Ozzy's more nasal, down-to-earth voice. This shift also made for a big risk on the band's part, but it was one that they needed to take. \"Heaven And Hell\" is now seen as the return to grace for Black Sabbath, although it bears little resemblance to the classic Sabbath sound.\n\nDisregarding the fact that I'm visiting this album a good three decades after it was released, I would not have believed that Sabbath would have sorted out their shit and gone back to recording passionate music after \"Never Say Die!\". In a way, the 'classic' sound of Black Sabbath seems to have died with \"Sabotage\", but then again, Sabbath were never a band to stay in the same place for long. Although Ronnie's solo work would not be out for a couple of years yet, \"Heaven And Hell\" tends to sound more like a Dio creature than the signature sound of Iommi and company. Although I may have preferred to hear a doomier incarnation of Sabbath here, Dio's contributions are impressive and work in the favour of a band that sounds young again.\n\nAlthough \"Heaven And Hell\" would be the most refined and polished Black Sabbath had yet sounded, it has a deeper grounding in heavy metal than most of their previous work. Iommi's riffs are a little less massive than they had been in the past, and as Sabbath albums go, the sound is pretty homogeneous. Although it was commonplace to hear ballads, experimental interludes, and metal screechers all within a single Sabbath record, the songwriting and tone lean towards a theatrical, upbeat energy, with the occasional call for mellowed rock instrumentation. Though this makes \"Heaven And Hell\" more difficult to distinguish on a song-by-song basis than albums from the band's golden era, this is arguably the most consistent the band had ever sounded. Highlights include \"Children of the Sea\" and the immortal title track, but one thing is for sure; \"Heaven And Hell\" is the return of passion for a band that had lost their way.\n",
        "\nWow. In spite of the poor acclaim and ambivalence I have seen aimed towards \"Technical Ecstasy\" and her equally unappealing sister \"Never Say Die!\", I was still a little shocked to hear the great Black Sabbath default on such mediocrity. Although I may have preferred \"Paranoid\" and \"Sabotage\" over the rest, there was no denying that the first six albums of this band were something to behold; it was if the band could do no wrong. As would be the case with a little band called Metallica almost three decades later with \"St. Anger\", the arguments and duress would lead to a decidedly sub-effort from the band. Sabbath have not completely festered here, but considering how great they were before this, there's no way to feel satisfied with this.\n\nIt's not often that fans are so united in their disappointment for a band and album. It seems like everyone plus their mothers, mailmen, and neighbourhood general practitioners can agree that \"Technical Ecstasy\" was a slip-up. In short, the band's style is once again robbed of its metal crunch. Unlike \"Volume Four\" however- which traded heaviness in exchange for sophistication- \"Technical Ecstasy\" comes up without any benefit, as were it an old lady whose handbag was stolen by a street vagabond. Sabbath's musical tightness pulls the album through, but at the end of the day, hearing the almighty Black Sabbath resort to generally bland rock music is a tough experience.\n\nAll disappoints aside, \"Technical Ecstasy\" is not necessarily a 'bad' album. In fact, it appears to be a victim of circumstance. Perhaps if listeners had not become used to Sabbath churning out record after record of inspired excellence, this album would not be looked down upon. Regardless, through the sea of mediocrity defined by songs like \"Backstreet Kids\" and \"Rock N Roll Doctor\", there are a handful of songs that distinguish themselves, for better or worse. \"You Won't Change Me\" is a great seven minute track with some great blues soloing from Iommi, and a piano progression reminiscent of The Beatles' \"Abbey Road\". \"She's Gone\" is nothing compared to some of the band's earlier ballads, but Ozzy Osbourne's passionate vocal performance and a lush string arrangement makes it stand out from the monotony.\n\nOn the other side of the spectrum, we have \"It's Alright\", sung by drummer Bill Ward. Frankly, it really isn't 'alright', in fact, it's arguably the worst track Sabbath had ever done up to this point. Disregarding Ward's tonedeaf voice, the ballad is saccharine enough to put a child off sugar for life. Considering that this is the band that once rocked our balls off with some of the most influential heavy metal ever made, it's a long ways to fall.\n\nFor the most part, \"Technical Ecstasy\" is fairly harmless. Besides \"It's Alright\", it's even listenable. The songwriting runs flat, but Black Sabbath retain enough of their progressive elements to give the listener a surprise, if only occasionally. Taken out of context, \"Technical Ecstasy\" is a run-of-the-mill, albeit inconsistent hard rock album. For those- like me- who are infatuated with the band's six album winning streak, it may be a good idea to save hurt feelings and skip right to \"Heaven And Hell\".\n",
        "\nLike most great bands, Black Sabbath have tweaked and changed their sound gradually, maintaining a distinctive core sound, but experimenting with the way they choose to approach it. Everything since \"Master of Reality\" witnessed Sabbath moving ever closer to a more mellowed, progressive sound. While I felt invigorated as a listener to hear the band transform their heavy riffs into something refined and sophisticated, I could not help but miss the grit and ugliness that made the band's first two releases so great. By the point of their fifth album \"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\", I could have sworn that the godfathers of heavy metal had distanced themselves from metal permanently.\n\nOf course, a masterpiece like \"Sabotage\" was enough to change my mind.\n\nI had heard alot of great things about Sabbath's sixth album before finally giving it a listen. Many fans of the band would even go as far as to tell me it was their favourite Sabbath album. Although the winning streak of excellent albums would allegedly end after this, \"Sabotage\" is a glorious return to the heavy metal crunch, all the way keeping their more recent prog sensibilities in mind. Although the idea of a 'return to roots' intrinsically means to take steps back and regress, the progress Black Sabbath made with sophisticated rock arrangements has not been lost. Here, the synths are subdued in exchange for a rekindled devotion to Iommi's almighty riff.\n\nAlthough Ozzy Osbourne and his vocal melodies still reach for the high notes (as was the case for \"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\") his vocals feel more accustomed for it. I have never considered Ozzy to be the most technically proficient vocalist, but his dynamic performance on \"Sabotage\" demonstrates he is capable of much more than his solo career lets on. The incredible closer and highlight \"The Writ\" has his vocals fit whatever mold the music warrants. The song is first filled with some classic Iommi riffage, and Osbourne's performance matches it with an intense, belting voice. Keeping in line with their progressive side however, the song then breaks into a soft, unsettling moment where Ozzy sounds almost like some of Pink Floyd frontman Roger Waters' more psychotic moments on \"The Wall\".\n\n\"Hole In The Sky\", \"Symptom of the Universe\" and \"Thrill of it All\" are all powerful, rock-oriented songs driven by Iommi's thick riff mastery. At ten minutes long, \"Megalomania\" is a step above most hard rock in terms of its sophistication, fitting in crunchy guitars with piano and eerie soft spots. Although less than a minute long, \"Don't Start (Too Late)\" is an ample demonstration of Tony Iommi's skill with acoustic guitars, a haunting piece that sounds like a rendition of something Igor Stravinsky would do. \"Am I Going Insane\" is the obvious choice for a radio single here, despite being led with prog-canon moogs. Ozzy's vocals are schizoid and quirky, making it one of the catchiest tracks in Sabbath's discography.\n\nGeezer Butler once said that \"Sabotage\" was so titled because the band felt that they as a band were being sabotaged by other people 'ripping them off'. Perhaps this concept may be seen as a heavy metal equivalent to Floyd's cynical dissection of the music industry in \"Wish You Were Here\". Although it's well-known that Black Sabbath weren't getting along too well at this point, \"Sabotage\" is among Sabbath's best work, perhaps rivaled only with \"Paranoid\" as their crowning statement. It's unfortunate that things would go downhill from here for the godfathers of metal, but I can't think of a better way for Black Sabbath to wrap up their classic era.\n",
        "\nWith \"Volume Four\", Black Sabbath developed upon the progressive themes they had planted in their previous record, \"Master of Reality\". Although their sound was still well-rooted in the heavy metal grit they introduced themselves to the world by, Sabbath exchanged some of their less refined sensibilities for more sophisticated arrangements and a generally more artsier approach than what they had gone for prior. \"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\" continues this development, albeit to a lesser degree of evolution than witnessed by their last step forward. Although the cover art implies something ripped from the bowels of hell, Black Sabbath had never sounded so refined, their style creeping ever closer to the world of prog rock. \"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\" may be less of a surprise than \"Volume Four\", but the band's firmer grasp of their 'new direction' results in a slightly superior realization of the 'prog' Sabbath.\n\nProggers will be quick to point out that Yes key wizard Rick Wakeman plays keys here. Indeed, he backs up the band with some inventive piano work on \"Sabbra Cadabra\", but it's nothing that would have been beyond the talents of Tony Iommi. Although the light timbre of the piano would have stuck out like Michael Jackson at a Klan meeting on \"Paranoid\", Black Sabbath had steadily built up an openness to using this and other 'pretty' sounding instruments in their work. The excellent instrumental \"Fluff\" is ample demonstration of the band's fully realized 'softer side'. Of course, the majority of this and any Black Sabbath album still resorts around their brand of thick, heavy rock.\n\nThis may be the first album of Black Sabbath's career where I cannot identify a true standout track that could be promised a place on a best-of compilation. \"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\" still triumphs over its predecessor for the fact that it manages to pursue these progressive sounds with consistency. Sabbath have still not entirely regained their doomy heaviness, but it's certainly a harder rocking effort than \"Volume Four\". \"A National Acrobat\" is my favourite from the album, a slower track with a beautiful dual harmonized guitar lead that foreshadows the music of another legendary British metal band. \"Who Are You\" is a gloomy throwback to Black Sabbath's doom roots, glorifying the synthesizer and featuring some of the band's most sophisticated orchestrations to date. \"Spiral Architect\" (the namesake of an excellent Norwegian prog metal band, by the way) is an upbeat and fitting way to close the album, with acoustic and electric guitars backed up with a Beatles-esque string arrangement. Excellent stuff.\n\nAlthough I did remark that Ozzy Osbourne's vocals had never sounded so powerful and evocative on \"Volume Four\", there is the constant feeling here that he is attempting to go past what is comfortable for his vocal range. Although some of his 'high notes' don't sound too bad, there are points where the strain in his voice is well evident, and it leaves him with less room to explore the emotion of his singing. Of course, it's that sort of adventurous spirit that largely defines this stage of Black Sabbath's development. Not everything was prone to work perfectly, but they did it anyway. In the case of \"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\", it's very clear that they learned some things since \"Volume Four\". The sound is a little more focused, the compositions more consistent, and the orchestrations more sophisticated. It could have been easily expected given the band's impressive track record, but Black Sabbath's fifth instalment is an excellent album.\n",
        "\nEach album that Black Sabbath released up to the point of \"Volume Four\" had showcased some sort of development. After all, most great bands are rarely satisfied with staying in the same place for so long, and it would be natural for these Birmingham gents to want to explore their 'heavy metal' invention in different ways. Although the diversified approach of \"Master of Reality\" surprised me when compared to what came before it, \"Volume Four\" is an even greater leap forward for the band, at least stylistically speaking. Here, the progenitors of heavy metal are embracing the progressive rock movement that was reaching its peak around 1972; if not accepting it with open arms, then at least acknowledging it with a nod and a wave. For all of the new possibilities that Sabbath open for themselves here however, I cannot help but miss the heaviness of their earlier work.\n\nAlthough I do not hide my love for progressive rock, much of the reason that albums like Black Sabbath's debut and their masterpiece \"Paranoid\" appealed to me so much was due to Tony Iommi's mastery of the almighty riff. Not only that, but his guitar tone was heavy and thick, even by today's standards. While \"Volume Four\" has not entirely lost these traits, it's clear from the uncharacteristically mellowed intro to \"Wheels of Confusion\" that Black Sabbath are trying to do something different with their music, for better and worse. While \"Volume Four\" may not be as heavy as what came before, the incorporation of prog rock and American psychedelia is an exciting change of pace. The eight minute rocker \"Wheels of Confusion\" and beautiful mellotron-laden \"Changes\" are major tips of the hat to prog, which was reaching its artistic peak that year with albums like Yes' \"Close To The Edge\" and Genesis' \"Foxtrot\". Among the other unconventional pieces on the album is a listless sound experiment in \"FX\", and \"Laguna Sunrise\", an acoustic piece accompanied by full-blown string orchestration that could easily score the happy ending to a Spaghetti Western film.\n\n\"Supernaut\" has Tony Iommi evoke the spirit of Jimi Hendrix with a playful central riff that ranks among the band's best. \"Snowblind\" is a rocking fan favourite involving the band's love of the Businessman's drug. Although the instrumentation generally feels less defined and powerful than it did on earlier albums, Ozzy Osbourne gives one of the best vocal performances of his career here, his distinctive voice complimented with a trembling vibrato and greater range than previously expressed. The result is an album that often feels more like hard rock than metal in the traditional sense. The songwriting is layered with keyboards, and tricks that the band innovated on \"Master of Reality\" have been developed further here. Although this is the most musically sophisticated album the band had made yet, it lacks the same atmospheric intensity I felt so profoundly with their early work. Although they have sacrificed an aspect of their sound on \"Volume Four\", Black Sabbath's newfound progressive outlook on their music would open a world of new possibilities for them.\n",
        "\nAlthough perhaps not as consistent as their seminal album \"Paranoid\", Black Sabbath took new steps forward with \"Master of Reality\". In the year since their self-titled debut, the band had received their share of fame and notoriety for their unprecedented heaviness and perceived 'Satanic' themes. As such, the band's third record seems to poke fun at these notions, showcasing a more laid back approach, and even praising the merits of Christianity. Although these new innovations don't always shine brightly, there is a still a hefty slice of the classic Sabbath sound here. Once again, Black Sabbath have not failed to impress.\n\nBeginning on the iconic note of a sampled cough, the band erupt into \"Sweet Leaf\", a drug-addled tune that's become a fan favourite over the years. Picking up where they left off on \"Paranoid\", \"Sweet Leaf\" is pumped full of Tony Iommi's distinctive guitar fuzz. Barring that, \"Lord of This World\" and \"Into The Void\" harken back to Black Sabbath's traditional sound. There is still a trace of the downtempo bluesy grime in their songwriting, but it becomes apparent later on that 'Master of Reality' has progressed past what the band was doing the year before. In addition to \"Sweet Leaf\", \"Solitude\" is the other 'known' song from the album, an atmospheric ballad that sounds as if it would feel less lonesome on a prog rock record than anything. Here, Iommi showcases his flute and keyboard playing abilities, a far cry from the sludgy riffs he's best known for. \n\n\"Master of Reality\" also features a pair of 'interlude' tracks that work best as experimental sketches. 'Embryo' is an eerie violin observation that may have worked well to space out the album's first side were it not so aimless. \"Orchid\" on the other hand is a nostalgic bit of acoustic plucking that works well to separate bouts of the band's typical heaviness. Without a doubt, the most controversial track here is \"After Forever\". Musically speaking, it's not such a departure from Black Sabbath's typical sound, sounding a touch more upbeat than their trademark gloom. Lyrically however, bassist Geezer Butler writes about his devotion to Christianity, even ridiculing those who may not agree with the Church. Whether or not this is a tongue-in-cheek jab at the accusations of Sabbath being Satanists, the preachy approach makes one wonder.\n\n\"Children of the Grave\" is my favourite song off \"Master of Reality\". Although it shares the same style of sludgy riffs and over-the-top occult atmosphere with much of Sabbath's work up to this point, it stands out for its relatively intense rhythm, a gallop that would later be mirrored in Maiden's work. Pair that with an added layer of drums that sound like they could have been plucked out of a Voodoo ritual, and you have one of the album's hardest rocking tracks.\n\n\"Master of Reality\" is an excellent continuation of what Black Sabbath were doing on the previous two records. Although not everything works to expectation, the more progressive edge they have here has opened plenty of doors for the band to explore. Overall, \"Master of Reality\" does not share the consistent string of 'essential' songs that \"Paranoid\" or even the self-titled did, but there is more than enough on Sabbath's third to give justice to their legacy as the godfathers of heavy metal.\n",
        "\nBarring the fact that the album was released a damned decade before metal was in full swing, Sabbath's 'Paranoid' was, and is as solid an album as they come. Although the self-titled debut may have had more of an immediate impact, Iommi and company would focus in on their doom innovation, a decision setting them further apart from the hordes of UK blues rockers. It's not often that an album is still relevant forty years after its release.\n\nConsidering how iconic 'Paranoid' is, it seems redundant to dwell on general information regarding the album. Suffice to say, taking into consideration that 1970 was the same year Deep Purple recorded 'In Rock' and the year after Led Zeppelin recorded 'II', Black Sabbath took a more downtuned, heavier approach to rock music. British rock was opening itself up to a more distorted sound in general, but Sabbath weren't afraid to sound ugly. A familiar blues style can be heard in Iommi's crunchy lead work, but the use of tritones, or 'evil' sounding riffs was what gave the band their then-unique take on rock music. The lyrical content somewhat fittingly either contends with the concept of war, or nightmarishly drug-fuelled adventures. As a respite from the doomy riffs, 'Paranoid' is fleshed out with some sounds of 60's era psychedelia, as best exemplified by the spacey, jam-oriented 'Planet Caravan'.\n\nThe first side of the album is a hit parade of some of the band's best-known tracks. 'War Pigs' sets up the rest of the album perfectly; a gloomy overture introducing Iommi's gritty guitar tone and some of the best riffs on the album. 'Paranoid' and 'Iron Man' are both instantly memorable tunes that have earned their due as rock radio staples. My favourite cut from the record would have to be 'Electric Funeral' however, opening the second side on an even darker note. From its signature psych-doom riff to lyrics about the apocalyptic existence of mutants in a post-nuclear city, it perfects the heavy darkness explored on the first side. The rest of 'Paranoid's later half doesn't feel quite as memorable as the first, however. The musical tightness never lets down, but 'Hand of Doom' and instrumental afterthought 'Rat Salad' feel a little less vital than the rest. Luckily, 'Fairies Wear Boots' wraps things up on a rocking note, closing with an epic lead melody that seems to foreshadow the future sound of Iron Maiden.\n\n'Paranoid' is not quite perfect, but it's fairly close, especially considering that the sound of heavy metal was still so young. At the very least, it deserves its status as a classic. With memorable songwriting, evocative lyrics and some of the best riffs ever written, who could ask for more?\n",
        "\nThis album is nothing short of a heavy metal masterpiece, in my humble opinion. Sabbath really redefined their sound and peaked with both this and their previous release, Sabbath Bloody Sabbath. One can hear layered guitars galore and a production that gives the entire album an \"otherworldly\" sound (and transports the listener entirely somewhere else indeed!).\n\nThe album comes out swinging with \"Hole in the Sky\" which showcases all four members at the top of their craft. A classic riff by Tony along with a wonderfully dissonant double-tracked harmony guitar lead, a soaring and melodic vocal line by Ozzy, an incredibly fluid and contrasting bass line coupled with finely crafted lyrical imagery by Geezer, and thundering drumming by Bill Ward all combine to make an incredible whole that is DEFINITELY more than the sum of its parts (and this is only the FIRST TRACK!). A short, classically inspired and dissonant acoustic guitar piece by Tony follows and segues into the classic and bone crunching \"Symptom of the Universe\" which includes a beautiful acoustic layered and melodic outro that is just as lovely as anything the classic prog-rock bands ever did (i.e. ELP, Yes, Tull, etc). This hard/soft formula works so well for Sabbath on this album that they continue to employ it with several of the upcoming tracks. \"Megalomania\" takes it and reverses the order, starting out with an ambient arrangement that can only be described as \"haunting\". Midway through the song, the tempo changes and Sabbath pounds it home like only they can with possibly the most classic and ne'er heard riff of their career and definitely some of the most sinister vocals ever heard on tape before or since.\n\n(Here comes side two, for all of you who first discovered this gem on VINYL.) \n\nJust when you think it can't possibly get any better, \"The Thrill of it All\" comes in with an incredible start/stop riff that leaves you drooling on your fretboard! The \"hard/soft\" formula is again employed and the outro section is every bit as exquisite as the ones that preceded it, if not more so. Next, the Sabs take it up another notch with the awesome \"Supertzar\", which is an instrumental piece that uses a full choir to sing the phonetic and inspiring vocal lines. GEEZ! If only to give us a break, the next track, \"Am I Going Insane (Radio)\", is the \"single\" on the album (if there really ever was such a thing on a Sab release). Lesser in total track time, but no less weird, the protagonist of the song continually asks the listener about the state of his mental health over rhythm tracks that race probably as fast as the poor man's thoughts and sound equally dissonant as his cognitive processes. At the end, one can hear bizarre screams of agony over careless laughter which only slightly prepares you for the magnum opus which is to come. \"The Writ\" starts out innocuously enough with a fluid bass line that only slightly hints at the massive wall of sound to follow. Lyrically, the piece seems to lash out at the horrible management situation the Sabs had just crawled out from under. Sonically, the song is no less poignant. As if stating that the previous efforts did not quite meet their own great expectations, they go again into a melodic outro that seals this masterpiece in the annals of heaviness.\n\nAs if at this point the quivering puddle of what was once the listener on the floor really cares...\n\n- Randy Michaud (TrogDawn)\n",
        "\nThis is the creative apex of both Ronnie James Dio and Black Sabbath as a unit. Yup, this is even better than Heaven & Hell and Mob Rules, mostly because it doesn't suffer from \"goofy filler song\" syndrome that plagued Sabbath from Day One. And who knew Dio could be this fucking menacing? Just listen to I and After All.\n\nThere's not a weak moment on this album (Buried Alive is average, but far from bad), and this is pretty much the standard for heavy fucking metal. You have the obligatory speed metal number (TV Crimes, with one of Iommi's most killer riffs), great mid-tempo rockers (Time Machine and Master Of Insanity), and of course, soul crushing monsters (After All and I...never mind the fact that the little lick in the intro and break is Purple Haze, it's probably the best song Sabbath has ever done!). Oh sure, this is pretty much a \"metal by numbers\" album (not that it's bad...but it's incredibly straightforward and there are no random changes), but if you want a straight-up traditional metal up, this is as good as it gets.\n\nSpecial notice has to be given to Dio's performance here. While he's never had a bad performance on an album, he's never been this amazing. He nails the necessary \"evil\" vibe that the lyrics are going for, especially in After All and I (which happen to be the best songs here). Just listen to the first verse of After All (\"Wonderful day for a killing...IT'S KILLING ME!\") or the last verse of I (\"I'll smash your face in, BUT WITH A SMILE!\" And to think, that predates American Psycho by 8 years!). Oh sure, Dio's solo albums to this point were amazing, but they were all uplifting (not that that's a bad thing), and suddenly he just breaks out and starts spitting acidic lyrics with a passion! A total must-own.\n\nOh yeah, this is also the only Sabbath album cover that actually makes sense AND doesn't suck!\n",
        "\nIf you listen to this album, you can tell the band was essentially done. Yeah, you gotta love the irony of the album title. Never Say Die was recorded under awkward circumstances what with Ozzy returning after he had quit and the rest of the band had already started material with a replacement. Every classic band is entitled to a bad album. Everyone knows how abysmal Technical Ecstasy is. I have not heard it nor have the slightest interest in doing so. I will take everyone's word for it. So they got their bad album out of the way with that one. But what about Never Say Die? I repeat: this band was headed for a divorce. It's one of those albums where you listen to the songs and it's clear the group have gone as far as they can go or should have gone. And Black Sabbath-the original- at this point in time did not go out on top, unfortunately. I won't say Sabbath hit rock bottom as far as quality is concerned (we'll save that for the preceding album and Forbidden) but make no mistake: this is a bad record with some interesting moments in the guise of perhaps(under the circumstances) a couple good songs. You could even say it's one of those \"interesting\" bad albums. And I'll do you one better: there are times when it even stands out for me as a sort of antithesis to Sabotage. \n\nIn my review for that album, I praised Sabb-tastic songs such as Symptom of the Universe and Hole In The Sky among a few others but was critical of it for being top heavy; several overwrought tracks put the band's winning streak of great heavy metal albums to rest. But it's still a damn good album. Conversely, Never Say Die is not. But the two or three better tracks on it are preferable to the lackluster songs on Sabotage. It bears mentioning that Black Sabbath is even more rock-ish on this album than was the case for their 1975 album. Much more. And that isn't a good thing this time around. Johnny Blade, Junior's Eyes and Shock Wave to name a few of the songs clearly are proof. \n\nNever Say Die is the highlight song by a long shot and I guess you could say it was the last classic heavy/doom metal track recorded by the most well known lineup. But even this song is very classic rock sounding with an opening riff bearing more than a passing resemblance to Thin Lizzy. I do like the song though. It's a worthy hit and probably deserves a place on the setlist and Sabbath greatest hits releases. It may still count for that classic Sabbath sound and it's one of those upbeat doom-ish songs the band was also known for. It also must be said that it's alot less heavy than even a song like Changes. \n\nIt's after that opening track where things get really strange. You will still know you're listening to Black Sabbath in most of these songs. Tony Iommi's droning riffs and Ozzy's vocals in general make sure of that. Yet..wow, this album sure likes to pull the string and jerk the listener into a jazz/blues rock direction. I guess when the producer said \"Hey guys, sober up, put that acid down, it's time to come back to Earth and record today\", he didn't mean go back to playing as Earth! \n\nI thought Over To You would be another pure heavy Sabbath track the way it started out-and it does remind me of Spiral City Architect-until..all that jazz! That's what the boys of Black Sabbath get with too much heroin and not enough LSD:that song. Things get progressively worse with Breakout; an improvisational boogie jazz romp that would make even a Deadhead accuse them of being goddamn hippies. \n\nSwinging The Chain has Bill Ward taking vocals. So what does Bill Ward sound like? Surprisingly, not as bad as I imagined. As a matter of fact, it occurred to me upon hearing this that Wino from Saint Vitus really sounds alot closer to Bill Ward on Swinging The Chain than he does to Ozzy Osbourne. By the way, that band Vitus, recorded a song called Thirsty and Miserable which sounds somewhat like Swinging The Chain (but without the boogie rock chorus) which was a very fun song but better yet, lessened the overall blow of the badness of this one. \n\nIf you find yourself tempted to buy this album at the record store, buy it cheap. There are two good songs(the title track and Air Dance) but since Never Say Die crashes and burns, I recommend you get this mostly for the sheer tragicomic value.\n",
        "\nApparently, this album was Black Sabbath's attempt at a straight rock album. That's news to me because Sabotage has some of the band's heaviest moments. When it was all finished, it still ended up sounding like the evil heavy metal they were known for. Unfettered, the goal to record a more traditional hard rock sound was tried even harder for the following two albums-and they succeeded but to awful results. But why? I can kind of understand the band's intent with Sabotage. If heavy metal was its own genre in 1975, it would have been mostly recognized to be populated with not only Black Sabbath but bands like Kiss, BOC, Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple or Nazareth. But we can more or less all agree that the genre proper would not begin until about 1979-ish when magazines were dedicated to promoting Judas Priest and Iron Maiden and the rest of the NWOBHM hordes along with Sabbath. But before that, Black Sabbath was an island..a brand unto themselves: they were metal and metal was them. There would be those who rebut with \"don't forget Pentagram!\" but let's be serious, as good as they were/are, Pentagram at that time was just a bar band who trucked from dive to dive playing a sound that can best be described as a cocktail of a little Black Sabbath and alot of Blue Cheer. So if there were any other \"trues\", they were just glorified tribute bands and even with those you had to be very fortunate to run into them unlike now where you can access 83,000 plus bands (and counting) via search engine. We tend to forget that fact so easily. So, if you were old enough in the early to mid 1970's and you wanted to listen to music about death, war, drugs and other destruction with a sound that actually backed it up, Black Sabbath was the option. Take it or leave it.\n\nOkay, so the question stands: Why did Black Sabbath seemingly want to make Sabotage more in the vein of an \"accessible\" hard rock album? Respectability? Please. Creem and Rolling Stone had long since dismissed this band with scathing reviews on every album during their heyday. And self-respecting rockers hated them too. No, I'm afraid the answer to the question really is quite more simple than that but very clever in design. After all, this Brummie bunch were of the goofy sort that managed to be more down-to-earth yet eccentric in sound than the average decadent rock wanker. The keyword in the first sentence of this paragraph is 'seemingly'. You see, the running gag is that by trying to intentionally create a more \"hard rock\" sound, Black Sabbath only established themselves as far heavier still than everyone else and therefore managed to prove that no matter what, they were playing something much different than hard rock even when they were trying to be more rock-ish; something not yet defined but burgeoning into as yet something to be determined to be what would later be known as the metal genre. Of course, this was already true for them with their previous albums but by diversifying their sound they reinforced this notion to an even greater extent essentially becoming the Lily Munster of the hard rock scene; claiming and shown to be lovingly part of a motley group but standing out like a sore thumb and \"uglier\" than their peers when in actuality they are really beautiful. This time though, Black Sabbath decided to play up and expound on the joke even further. \n\nThe screetch of feedback disturbingly introduces A Hole In The Sky creating a thundering live atmosphere that leads into a classic display of earsplitting doom. Sabotage may contain a more proggy essence of album rock but don't think Black Sabbath isn't done telling the truth about the direction mankind is heading in. Saigon fell and while every other rock listener in '75 just wanted to run away from it all by listening to Born to Run, this band would desist from anything less than a sound that said they were the last bastion of born to be blunt as this song is so forceful and menacing with Ozzy's hysterical wails describing how WMDs will perforate our ozone. And how can anyone mistake Bill's washed out drum sound as they lay down the fire of bombardment in this aural assault? Don't Start(Too Late) is a typical Fluff like acoustic guitar break that Tony Iommi is known for. I've always enjoyed most of these moments on Sabb albums but here it seems more purposeful and aptly titled to the preceding song about earthly destruction. \n\nIf every survey that asked \"Which is Black Sabbath's best song?\" didn't have Symptom of the Universe among the top five, then there should be a formal inquest. Actually, if this song didn't at least appear at the five hole on a \"Best Heavy Metal Song Of All Time\", there should be a formal inquisition ultimately leading to someone being shanghaied to Birmingham, held before a hookah smoking executioner magistrate asking \"DO.YOU. CONFESS?\" with song in question blaring loudly in the background. Yes, this song is that great! It justifies the awesomeness of Sabbath even if today they will have Bullet For My Valentine as an opening act rather than other heavy/doom bands. It justifies Speak of the Devil. It justifies Ozzy wearing a women's dress and my mom's platform shoes on the front cover of Sabotage. It justifies buying every needless compilation that the song appears. Yes, all that and because of songs like this, Black fucking Sabbath will always get a pass. Here on this song, there is a mind blowing crunch of a riff that chugs along at an almost thrash metal-ish vibe. Recording more of a a straight rock album,eh? Oh, how you jest, you japing geniuses! Symptom of the Universe sounds like a symphony of psychedelia gone so horribly wrong and gets the celebration of rancour so deliciously right. This is arguably Ozzy's greatest vocal achievement. His energy again coupled with those violent drum beats are so palpable you can almost feel The Hand of Judgement giving sway of approval whilst displaying the devil horns. If the band doesn't play this track at every show, then they damn well should because it was made to be performed live. I can still visualize the band back in the day on stage with Ozzy belting it out crazily in his white buckskins with Tony playing along in a satin cape. And no other incarnation of Black Sabbath(or any other band) than the original should ever play it and that means you, Sepultura. \n\nMegalomania is a long track that begins like a brooding ballad protesting the unsafe combo of depression, insanity and delusion emphasizing 'mania' when the song breaks out of stupor in the second half into a euphoria of speed riffs and yells(Ozzy screams \"Suck me!\"). The engineering job on this song is pretty impressive as the cavernous echos of the distortion and overdubs spell out the sheer devastating power on the track. Everything but the kitchen sink is fed to the mix including Geezer's doom-y bass dance and a mellotron. \n\nThrill Of It All is a song I really, really like. This is probably the one song that would pass as the most traditionally rock and roll sounding but once again, it simultaneously demonstrates how good this band is at showcasing their very identity as the one true heavy metal band. As its title suggests, it's quite upbeat and full of nostalgia as it makes me visualize the band performing it with one of those blotchy, spastic light shows in the background as Ozzy claps his hands while singing the chorus. Wonderful. Trippy. And headbanging-able. This track sounds like a companion piece to A National Acrobat-the song that ended the previous full-length. What I also appreciate about it are how well worded the lyrics are relative to Ozzy's delivery of them during the song. They are done with a simple and direct prose with disregard for traditional meter i.e. \"Well, that's my story and I'm sticking to it...\"..\"Dontcha think I know my own mind?..Oh yeah..oh yeah\". This is why the legendary singer was so perfect for this band. Every beat and progression keeps on keeping on and it sounds so natural. \n\nIf you were reading this review for the first time and the score was not shown, you would assume thus far that Sabotage was well on its way to getting a damn near perfect score by me. But it's the bottom half where the record really starts to slope downwards. Supertzar-an instrumental- while interesting at first pass, is ultimately rubbish. Tony must have been either high or bored when writing it. Probably both. Am I Going Insane (Radio) is a song that I like less and less each time I hear it and yet I have no real explanation as to why except that it passes as pure filler. Maybe it's because the band hasn't had many filler songs up to this point in their career and so when such a track did come, it was all the more contemptible. It also suffers from tiring repetition as well as being an all too literal reference to insanity when Megalomania hit on that theme with far more devastation and better delivery. And that jack-in-the-box laugh at the end..could they get any more juvenile? \n\nThe Writ starts out decently enough with that soaring riff and Ozzy's shouts but the song goes to shit in the last three and a half minutes. It's a song that's structured as complex as the other tracks on the album but The Writ sounds forced and inferior in heaviness than the first five cuts. \n\nDiscussing where this album ranks among the Black Sabbath discography is up for debate. It's certainly \"up there\" when you take in consideration how long they kept going. As I said, it does contain a few of their best songs and it's one of their most well produced in the Mk. 1 era but the album doesn't finish very strong. Ozzy was once quoted as saying \"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath was the last real Black Sabbath album as far as I'm concerned.\" What he should have said (if I were him) was that Sabbath Bloody Sabbath and the first five songs from Sabotage were.\n",
        "\nAfter a run of five classic studio albums, one patchy but still quite good piece (Sabotage) and a couple of albums best forgotten, the Ozzy-fronted incarnation of Black Sabbath finally disintegrated for good. Luckily, Iommi, Ward and Butler had been having a good time jamming with Dio of late, and took him on as their new vocalist - a crucial moment for the careers of both Dio and the band as a whole.\n\nWisely, Sabbath do not try to mimic the sound of the Ozzy-era albums, instead taking the opportunity of their new lead singer to update and rejuvenate their sound and show those NWOBHM whippersnappers how it's done. The result is a confident and capable album which might not be as starkly original and groundbreaking as their first releases, but still represents a striking return to form after a fallow patch in the band's fortunes and a refreshingly new sound for the group.\n\nParticularly striking is the way Iommi is able to weave guitar solos in his own classic style into fast-paced tunes like Neon Knights, which in their pounding rhythms and Dio's dramatic delivery rank compare favourably to the sort of material produced by Iron Maiden or Judas Priest at around the same time. Meanwhile, Dio proves he's capable of handling slower, doomier material like the title track, Lonely Is the Word, or Children of the Sea. These slower tracks take on a more operatic tone than the sledgehammer-heavy dirges of early Sabbath, but this is only appropriate for Dio's vocal style - which is on top form this time around.\n\nOn the whole, this album is probably more closely aligned to Dio's early solo style than the classic early 1970s Black Sabbath sound, so if you're fond of the former but aren't so keen on the latter, don't be put off from giving it a try, while if you love the early Ozzy sound don't expect more of the same with a different vocalist here. Of course, if you love both early Sabbath and solo Dio, you'll probably end up giving this album heavy rotation anyway.\n",
        "\nReams of study and debate over whether Black Sabbath should be considered the first true 'heavy metal' album have already been ground out through the years in myriad forums. Horns have been locked, sides drawn and oppositions condemned. But while it might be impossible that we EVER pinpoint and agree upon a sole, single progenitor for the medium, the truth is that the style was born out of a number of influences, culturally and musically, which led to a band from Birmingham, England to intensity their heavy blues sound into something we now recognize as a defining, formative work of our beloved escape. Yeah, Black Sabbath might not have penned the very first 'metal' record, and who cares? But I don't think there's any argument that this was the first of such enormous significance...\n\nUpon a cursory listen, of course, one might discern that the band's blues rock roots still shine through heavily here, and as a result the s/t debut is not one of stylistic certainty, but a balance of components akin to the evolving sounds of Deep Purple or Led Zeppelin in the same era. There are tracks here as heavy as fuck-all, and others through which the quartet delves into the psychedelic folk and rock that were a huge influence upon them personally growing up. So by no means is this album thorough in its metallic content, but then, said content is far and away what I'd deem the most memorable writing here, and of course I'm referring to their namesake \"Black Sabbath\" itself, which I'd consider the best and most important track on the album. Samples of rain and church bells build support for the centric, funeral brooding Iommi lick which entire sub genres of heavy rock were born from, and our introduction to Osbourne's vocals is flawless, hypnotic and most importantly: assertively blue-collar and honest.\n\n\"Black Sabbath\" creeps along like every cliche out of nightmare! You can close your lids to this and imagine any serpent, spider or rodent creeping along its carrion course, or a murder of crows stirring upon the grounds of some fell cathedral. Bill Ward's percussion totally sells the simple guitar line which, while alternated between single notes, bends and chords glides through both the corporeal fat of Geezer Butler's bass lines and the foreboding doom of the lyrics. The end of the tune picks up into a fairly 'freakout' sequence of sweltering blues lead and psychedelic, wavy rhythm guitars, but it's not a bad climax, and really the only negative thing I can say about this song, one of the band's greatest, is that it sets up such a high water mark for the album that the ensuing material simply cannot reach or surmount it...\n\nBut it tries. \"The Wizard\" transforms from Ozzy's harmonica intro to a more swaggering form of choppy, heavy rock that wouldn't be alien to fans of Zeppelin, Cream or Hendrix, and the true star here is Geezer's punctual, fluid bass as it clings to the underside of the chords like a green slime about to drop itself on some dungeon victim. \"Behind the Wall of Sleep\" is trippy thanks to the contours of the grooving bass and Osbourne's slightly effected bite, while \"N.I.B.\" sounds like the devil's own spiritual successor to something like The Kinks' \"Girl You Really Got Me\", only more slovenly, measure and mesmerizing. I'm also quite a huge fanbay for the track \"Wicked World\" which appears on the American version of the LP in place of their cover of Crow's \"Evil Woman (Don't Play Your Games With Me)\". The opening minutes are pretty pure blues driven Sabbath groove, with Butler taking another wet-booted stroll in the mix, but what I found most fascinating were the closing moments where the song takes on an almost early 'post-rock' appeal with the calming clean tones in the bridge, and the spacey surge of whining, ambient feedback at its close.\n\nI'm not quite as into some of the minor clips of excess fixed into other tracks here, like the brief Geezer vehicle \"Bassically\", or the rather pointless \"Wasp\" intro to \"Behind the Wall of Sleep\". I also don't really find the cover tunes necessary. The 10+ minute rendition of Aynsley Dunbar Retaliation's \"Warning\" is not a highlight for me, but certainly I found myself transfixed to its strutting style and the great performance on the bass. But then, including covers on a debut album was just not that out of place during this period. Deep Purple used covers, and hell, even Ozzy and crew were themselves on the receiving end when Japan's Flower Travelin' Band kick started its own recording career with Sabbath covers. At least these guys chose a few that were appropriate, flush with the original material. A few that they could make 'their own'.\n\nUltimately, even if it never really eclipses the titular opening cut, Black Sabbath is monumental in its quality and the span of its inspiration upon hundreds of thousands of hard rock, stoner rock, doom and psychedelic metal cosmonauts for the next four decades and on into infinity. I would not say this was my favorite of their records, since Paranoid, Sabotage and Sabbath Bloody Sabbath are just too loaded to deny, but its waves of harrowing nostalgia and morbid, serious lyrical prowess are legion, and \"Black Sabbath\" itself is easily one of the best songs ever in the doom or 'proto' doom category, an apparition of eerie atmosphere that has kept me nervous around graves and doing a double take on every own shadow I've crossed since the day I first heard it.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nAn awkward, transitional album from Sabbath with the prog-metal tendencies of Sabbath Bloody Sabbath competing with two conflicting visions of the band's future. Songs such as the pounding, energetic opener Hole In the Sky or the upbeat, almost funky The Thrill of It All showcase Sabbath as an accessible, down to earth heavy rock band. Conversely, compositions like Megalomania and the closing couplet of Am I Going Insane (Radio) and The Writ find the band becoming increasingly submerged in experimentalism and studio wizardry.\n\nIn particular, Am I Going Insane lacks lead guitar entirely and substitutes in keyboard riffs, an experiment unheard-of for Sabbath at the time, whilst The Writ alternates pounding, heavier sections with synthesizer-laden acoustic segments. All the ingredients which would come together in the critically-derided Technical Ecstasy are laid out here for all to see - the increasing abandonment of the doomy sound the band built its reputation on, the growing love affair with studio gimmicks, and internal discord within the band as to exactly what a Black Sabbath album should sound like.\n\nIt's a good, listenable album, but it isn't much better than \"good\". And when you have five Sabbath albums leading up to this one which each consistently knock the ball out of the park, just \"good\" isn't enough. Sabbath fans will doubtless sooner or later find this one in their collections, but I suspect most will find it gets much less rotation than the band's first five classic albums - or their celebrated early 1980s material with Dio.\n",
        "\nSometimes, words can't describe something you really like. Like, if something is really good, and there is a strong personal factor to it, it's really something that will make that thing really special. And actually, there is nothing more to be said about this album that hasn't already been said. I have known almost every single song from this album my entire life. My father would play this record numerous times when I was a kid, so it grew up on me, and even now, when my personal taste has been almost fully developed, and stretches to way heavier music, this is still a classic, and never will stop being one.\n\nWhere to begin? How about those beautiful guitar licks from the beginning of War Pigs? Or those grandiose lyrics which also makes this song not only a transcendental musical masterpiece, but also the best anti-war song ever? Yeah, Ozzy's vocals may be pretty crappy (let's admit it, he was never a good singer and never will be, but his vocals are a trademark and have lots of spirit), but he manages to deliver the goods. Besides, can you imagine anyone else singing Paranoid or Iron Man? I mean, there are some live versions with Dio, a better singer by a thousandfold, but I never listen to it because this is the way these songs are supposed to sound, and this is the only true Sabbath. \n\nNow, let's talk about the songs. There are 8 songs on here, and not a single one short of a masterpiece. The aforementioned War Pigs is simply breathtaking, from that immortal riff to Ozzy wailing while cursing politicians and generals that use ordinary small people as cannon fodder while they wait at their tents in security for that same people to win their wars. Of course, let's not forget that freaking Geezer's distorted bass, or Bill's insane tom rolls. The title track is a well known song to almost anyone who has anything to do with rock and metal music. Yes, it's overplayed. Yes, it fucking rules. Planet Caravan sounds as if it's been recorded by a bunch of high cannabis users. Oh wait, it IS recorded by a bunch of high cannabis users! This is so charming and calming, and I like it. Iron Man starts with all too familiar 4 bass drum hits before bursting into one of the most instantly recognizable riffs in all of metal. Seriously, whoever doesn't know that one has been officially living under a fucking rock. It's another epic masterpiece, this time about an abandoned war veteran whom everyone rejects. And don't forget that robot that goes: 'I AM IRON MAN!'. Electric Funeral is a very groovy track, and Hand Of Doom is a slow and droning track with an epic riff, lead by bass during quiet parts and by guitar during loud parts with lyrics about how drugs destroy your body and spirit. Rat Salad is actually some kind of an interlude leading into Fairies Wear Boots. Now this one is a real winner, riff-wise and vocally. Oh, and it's about hallucinations (guess because of what).\n\nThe production is also another highlight. I mean, this was apparently recorded in 1970, and since I am a big fan of old hard rock music, I can say that no one had production this guitar-accented. I mean, Zeppelin were a pretty heavy band for its time, so were Purple and Uriah Heep, but this is really something different. Maybe this is where you draw the line between hard rock and heavy metal. But still, no matter how you classify it, you do need this album. It's an essential piece of music no matter how you look at it. Heavy metal fans need apply. Hard rock fans need apply. General good music fans need apply. Enough said.\n\nFavorite tracks: War Pigs, Iron Man, Hand Of Doom.\n\nFavorite moments: Start of the first verse of War Pigs, Paranoid solo, the part when Iron Man speeds up, chorus of the closing track.\n",
        "\nBack when The Eternal Idol was released, you know somewhere Ozzy was loudly laughing his wasted ass off. What a rough period this was for Black Sabbath and it shows on this album. While not as bad as The Seventh Star and yes, despite that record being originally intended as a solo outing by Tony Iommi, it says Black Sabbath on the cover and hence that's exactly what it is. While the Ozzman's solo career(and to a lesser extent Dio's also) soared as he put out loud, catchy and fun if callow heavy metal albums, the once mighty Black Sabbath languished in the shadows of prosperity. Ozzy had bat's heads while Tony needed a cat's paw. There was none. Yes, it seemed the mid 80's was prosperous for every metal band except Black Sabbath. All our favorite moustachioed metal master was left to record with was his bluesy doom guitar, a nondescript rhythm section and a singer who sounds like David Coverdale trying to do Ronnie Dio vocals. And that brings me to The Eternal Idol. \n\nI always think of The Eternal Idol as that album that no one ever buys. It's ubiquitous for that very reason. Always available on the shelf of every record store I've ever been to in the world and always when I was looking for the Black Sabbath album that I really wanted but was not available for me that day. Hell, last time I checked, iTunes sold very few of the band's albums but lo and behold one of the very few they did offer was..you guessed it: The Eternal Idol (cue the laughter at the end of track six). This album is like that pair of cheap sunglasses that Jeff Foxworthy once described as the thing you could chuck overboard an ocean liner in the middle of the Pacific and a frogman will salvage it up and return it to you on the deck unscathed. And so I finally relented and bought this album and it is with me eternally as I persist in somehow misplacing my Sabbath Bloody Sabbath CD. And by the way, I actually cut myself opening this goddamned album (not that I was in any real hurry to hear it or anything). The jewel case was sealed very tight by a yellow used price tag reinforced not by one but two very transparent pieces of scotch tape on the other sides that I had to resort to using a knife. And when I finally pried the disc out and popped it in the player what did I get in return for my blood in? A power metal album bled out. That's right, I bled for some power metal. You'd think Tyr, the out-of-print, hard to get Black Sabbath album would be the CD wrapped tight like there were Benjamins inside but nooooo. \n\nThe first song is The Shining and the opening riff is very unholy melodic doom and I thought \"heeeere's Tony!\". But then the song kicks upbeat and devolves into Deep Purple by the time the singer belts his voice out and into the chorus. Iommi utilizes that opening doom riff into a rhythm again throughout the song along with another crunch heavy signature. It would have been awesome had he reprised the opening riff as a solo in exactly the same way to the middle of the song but instead the track plays out in a very predictable fashion. I was hoping this record would vary it's speed quite alot throughout the tracklist but even before Ancient Warrior was done playing, I was already resigned to the fact that The Eternal Idol was an album that was going to be very mid-paced most of the way. Sure, some other songs will be noticeably faster or slower than others but they don't get your attention by pummeling you the way other songs from the earlier albums did. One of the things I do like about the album are the way synthesizers are placed in songs like Ancient Warrior. They sound just like they did on Heaven and hell or Mob Rules almost. That crisp sense of desolation and gloom. It's quite a reminder that Tony is pitching this album to fans of that era more than anything else. \n\nThe best song probably on the record is the instrumental Scarlett Pimpernel. While it's good and makes excellent use of the synths in the background, the fact that such a track is the best on The Eternal Idol speaks volumes about the lack of traditional doominess throughout the rest of the work. I don't even think Tony should have included the song because it will probably just remind the listener of the earlier more successful albums and they will change to one of those albums before finishing the rest of The Eternal Idol. Lost Forever follows it as the next song like you were daydreaming of the good old days of Sabbath and you just got reminded that those times are over with because this song is just more power metal. It begins with a Judas Priest type riff; fast, heavy but rollicking and the vocals scream with Priest type vigor too but with far less energy and range. Eric Singer is a competent drummer but he has no particular style and seems like nothing more than a session drummer and he was not a very good choice to drum for Black Sabbath. Bob Daisley had worked before with Dio and Ozzy so I guess it is no surprise that Tony Iommi would eventually get around to reaching for his services for Black Sabbath and I stress the word 'reach'. Lost Forever is the only song I noticed where both of those musicians contribute anything as somewhat solid. The bass sounds slightly deeper and reverberates with alot of catchiness. It's the closest thing you will get to being reminded of those types of rhythms from the classic years. The drum hits sound light and perfunctory still but they echo out to something recognizable of Vinnie Appice. \n\nFor those who haven't heard this album and are wondering how much of that \"doom metal\" sound there is to be found, there of course is some scattered about. Not alot but some. The Eternal Idol is an album that you have to really work hard to appreciate it for those moments when they do show up. Mostly the album just teases at it like on The Shining or Scarlet Pimpernel for example. This is a record that might have been good for what it was back in 1987-88 but doesn't quite hold up now. I guess I should point you to the final self-titled track if you are looking for more of that classic doom sound of the band's heyday. It's a fairly decent enough track and the heaviest for certain but I don't know why I am not really all that impressed with it. I think it could be that the album \"railroads\" me into it. It's like, okay they teased and toyed with classic heavy Sabb riffs while mostly mixing a trad/power sound in the meantime and nooooow they want to finally give me a doom metal song. Better than nothing I guess. It has a somber and forboding riff structure to begin and continues with crushing resonance in that guitar sound. Halfway through the song, there will be no mistaking that riff. If you are a fan of Candlemass, you really will dig this number. Especially how it ends with the deep wailing gloom fade out at the end. Is it any wonder why it's the longest track on the record but seems like the shortest too? It's not the most memorable Sabbath song but it gets the job done.\n\nThe thing that bothers me about The Eternal Idol the most however and why it's not a good album is that it all sounds obvious that Tony Iommi is not enjoying playing this material very much. It almost sounds like he is putting out the album because it is a job he has to do and nothing more. I do wonder how long it has been since he actually played any of the songs from The Eternal Idol. Eighteen..twenty years perhaps? This album has not aged very well. If it isn't forgotten, it\u2019s because it went largely ignored too. When the best things that stand out is instrumental song and a riff here and there, it doesn't deserve too much of my time. Maybe the reason why the man on the cover looks so despondent kneeling next to a titty is because said tit (Sabbath) has been milked dry.\n",
        "\nI have never heard a extremely good heavy metal album until I clapped eyes on Black Sabbath's \"Paranoid\", one of the most legendary heavy metal releases ever made. Honestly, this is a work of pure art, an album that has inspired many other artitsts to do the same, but unable to replicate. It has some really good production and recording quality, some of the best and most legendary musicians to date and the quality of the music is just unbelieveable! Listening to this, even now, brings the 70s metal scene back to life.\n\nThere are some songs that are just plain amazing and heavy (ie. War Pigs, Paranoid, Iron Man) and then there are other songs that are so soft and trippy (ie. Planet Caravan, Electric Funeral, Fairies Wear Boots). Words can't describe how great and legendary this album truly is. There are so many words to describe it, so many names, but really all you can say is amazing. Ozzy's vocals and the guitar playing of Iommi are the best parts of the entire piece because they both play along together wonderfully. Bill Ward's drumming and the bass playing by Geezer Butler are also truly mind blowing. Because of their skill level and for the fact they've created an extraordinary album such as this, we can all proudly call them the great grandfathers of heavy metal.\n\nWhen I said the word \"trippy\" earlier in this review, I meant it. When I listened to \"Planet Caravan\" after headbanging to \"War Pigs\" and \"Paranoid\", everything went mellow and calm. Ozzy's vocals chiming into the sound of bongos and Geezer's soft bass riffs playing in the background made everything relaxing and easy to listen to. After \"Caravan\" ended, the intensity just bounced in when \"Iron Man\", \"Electric Funeral\" and \"Hand of Doom\" came blasting through my speakers. It's a great transition from loud to calm to loud again. \n\nWhen songs like \"War Pigs\" started playing, it amps up your mind and energy, you feel obligated to bang that head no matter what the circumstance, you feel the true power of heavy metal with this release. You won't hear speed metal riffs from bands like Megadeth or Metallica, you won't hear open string tremolo picking from Dying Fetus or Cerebral Bore and you definitely won't hear death vocals on this album either. However, because of this band, they made all of those musical techniques and styles made possible, without this album it's safe to say that metal would never have occurred. If it had happened without Sabbath to take the reigns, metal would sound and be named differently. This album is basically like reading a history book, it's like reading about our neanderthal ancestors, however it's music related, instead of primitive men we have Sabbath. Just like when primates evolve and change into human beings, Sabbath creates metal and the genre evolves into different branches.\n\nThere are absolutely no flaws with this piece at all, let's keep it that way. Everything is a solid gold pentagram in my books. Some may not share the same views as me or my other metal brothers and sisters, but then again if they don't then they're not ready to accept the fact that this band brought the genre we love to our world. We have Sabbath to thank for creating such powerful and raw music fit for any metal head young or old, we hope they have a reuinion soon.\n",
        "\nIt's a shame that Black Sabbath never managed to record a live album of a standard they were satisfied with during the strongest part of the Ozzy era. Until Past Lives came out, the closest thing we had was this quasi-official release - not a bootleg, because it was released by people with the legal rights to the recordings in Europe, but not approved of by the band.\n\nThe sound quality is pretty raw, but is above bootleg standards - it's more or less average for a live recording from the era. Musically speaking, if you've had the original albums on heavy rotation this album isn't going to reveal anything particularly new or revolutionary about the material on here - Killing Yourself to Live has different lyrics because it hadn't yet been finalised as a composition but the instrumental side of the song has been more or less pinned down at this point, Wicked World turns into a medley, and Ozzy repeatedly shouts \"COCAINE!\" during Snowblind rather than whispering it once. In fact, it's Ozzy's performance that changes the most from the studio albums here; the album provides ample proof that during his prime Ozzy was an insanely extroverted frontman on a mission to make sure every single member of the audience has a great time.\n\nBuyers should be aware that the first disc of Past Lives is exactly the same as this album, so there's no good reason to buy it separately when you can get Past Lives and in effect have a bonus disc of additional performances with it.\n",
        "\nJust as their first two albums defined the parameters of doom metal and Tony Iommi's downtuned guitar sound on Master of Reality yielded the seeds of sludge metal, Black Sabbath's fourth album sees them redefining heavy rock yet again. This time, though the sludge sound is still present here and there (as on Tomorrow's Dream) and there's the occasional slow, doomy section (as on Snowblind), the sound of the album is a bit more commercial. It'd be easy to mistake this as Sabbath selling out and moving to the mainstream, except at this point in time heavy metal didn't have a mainstream.\n\nInstead, with up-tempo, feel-good songs like Tomorrow's Dream and Supernaut, Sabbath define a new accessible style of metal which would become a touchstone of middle-of-the-road bands for years afterwards, but in 1972 this came like a bolt from the blue and still stands up to its imitators even today. It's far from perfect. In particular, the first half of the album is marred by Changes and FX. Changes is a sappy piano ballad where the band apply amateurish mellotron in an apparent attempt to justify their presence on the Vertigo label (which was supposedly a progressive rock label rather than being a home of hard rock). Even if you set aside the horrible Kelly Osbourne rendition from a few years back, the fact is that the song stinks - the musical backing is simplistic and repetitive, the lyrics are laughable, and in general it simply isn't the sort of music you want to hear when you're listening to a Black Sabbath album. FX is even worse, a laughable stab at musique concrete clearly and thrown in as filler - needlessly, since if FX and Changes had been taken off the album would have been around 37 minutes long, which at the time was a perfectly acceptable length.\n\nIt's marred by two really lousy songs, and it isn't quite as interesting or groundbreaking as the three albums that preceded it, but on balance Volume Four is another great Black Sabbath album that deserves to be in your collection if you loved what came before it, but I'd still recommend any of the previous three over this one.\n",
        "\nThe third Black Sabbath album saw the band attempt to diversify their sound a little, and so there's a bit less of the pure proto-doom sound of their debut on view here and a few more 70s hard rock cliches (Bill Ward even unleashes a little cowbell on Lord of This World). The album by and large succeeds simply by virtue of still being far heavier than anything else being produced at the time, with songs like Sweet Leaf, Lord of This World, and the thunderous Children of the Grave being particular highlights. For much of the album Iommi showcases a newly developed, sludgier, downtuned guitar sound which seems to have influenced just as many stoner metal guitarists as his work on the band's first two albums set the playbook for doom metal guitar. Nowhere is this more powerfully displayed than on Sweet Leaf, which begins with a distorted, hacking cough that transforms into a crushingly powerful riff that doesn't let up for most of the song.\n\nHowever, the album isn't perfect. It includes two small instrumental filler pieces - Embryo and Orchid - which I actually think are pretty decent (I can't think of Children of the Grave without having Embryo as a lead in to it), but others may take issue with. The band repeat the attempt to include a quiet song with the inclusion of Solitude, which unfortunately just isn't very good - it's over five minutes long and really needs to trim three of those minutes, it's a poor attempt at a flute-led melodic love ballad which fails to match up to the efforts of other bands working in the same vein (it reminds me a little of a poor attempt to mimic early Jade Warrior), and the lyrics are the sort of love poetry a self-important 13 year old might compose.\n\nSpeaking of bad lyrics, the words to After Forever may irritate some listeners. The song itself is perfectly heavy, but the lyrics bash people who unthinkingly bash religion simply because they think it's the cool thing to do (which is fair enough - I'm an atheist myself but I think people should choose their religious beliefs because they've thought things through for themselves rather than to make a fashion statement), but then turns around and uncritically embraces Christianity as the answer to all man's ills.\n\nThe contradictory message (\"Think for yourself and don't let others dictate your beliefs! By the way, Christ is the only answer.\") will aggravate those who pay attention, so I advise just immersing yourself in the riffs and letting them flow over you, because musically speaking the song is still a treat - yet another showcase for Iommi's fuzzy riffs, with the repetitive structure set against Ozzy's chantlike vocals giving the song a hypnotic quality.\n\nAnd the fact is that the downtuned sound of this album makes it the sludgiest disc of the Ozzy era. Like the debut album, Master of Reality deserves props simply because it introduced the world to a brand new sound which launched a whole subgenre or two of metal. It's just not quite perfect from beginning to end.\n",
        "\nBlack Sabbath's second album of 1970 still heavily features the doom metal sound that they had already perfected on their debut - unleashed with devastating effect in War Pigs and Hand of Doom - but the selection of songs this time around are more varied, proving that the group weren't just a one-trick pony. Never has a quickie throwaway single been as influential as the title track, which set a precedent for speed metal in proving that crunching heavy metal riffs could be played fast to good effect. The trippy space blues track Planet Caravan proves that the band were paying attention to the experiments then underway in the progressive rock genre, and also acts as an interesting interlude between the speed metal of Paranoid and the doom metal of Iron Man.\n\nThe band even prove they have a sense of humour on the closing track, Fairies Wear Boots, which as well as taking a pop at skinheads who'd hassle the band for having long hair also prefigures the more light-hearted odes to weed and other illegal substances that would make appearances on Master of Reality and Volume 4. The inclusion of this song at the end of the album is actually an inspired choice - after treating the listener to doomy visions of war, nuclear holocaust, and heroin addiction, perhaps something to lighten the mood is essential. And I don't think the band were ever more adept lyrically speaking than on this album; Hand of Doom, in particular, is an insightful and eloquent look at the end of the hippy era and the effect this disillusion had on many at the time.\n\nOn balance, it's hard to say which of the Sabbath albums from 1970 is the superior one. If I absolutely had to choose one, some days I'd probably go for the debut, simply because it chooses a particular mood and then nails it perfectly. Then again, other days I'd go for Paranoid, simply because it is more varied. Both, I'd say, are equally essential to any metal collection, unless you are absolutely averse to slow playing in your metal.\n",
        "\nPreviously a blues-rock band by the name of Earth chugging away in an era where blues-rock bands were hardly thin on the ground, and not really distinguishing themselves from their sound (heck, Iommi jumped ship briefly to play in Jethro Tull before departing to make way for Martin Barre to take that post), Black Sabbath took on a new musical direction inspired by horror fiction, tapped into the spirit of the end of the hippy era, and within a few months let loose this monster of an album, inspiring both traditional heavy metal and several other subgenres with it - doom metal and stoner metal in particular. Led Zeppelin had been active before them, and the Stooges had a raw and nasty guitar sound, but it took Iommi to teach the world what metal truly meant from the very first devastating, Earth-shattering, portentious riff on the title track. Coupled with a competent rhythm section and Osbourne's soul-in-torment wails and a new genre was born.\n\nThe title track sets the scene for the rest of the album, and the subsequent tracks are more or less all cast in the same mold; the only time the album can really be said to speed up very much is for N.I.B., and even then the song progresses with a heavy, plodding march rather than a lightning-fast speed metal gallop. The cover versions of Evil Woman and Warning are so infused with the band's own personality that you could believe (as I did for years!) that they were Sabbath originals.\n\nThe Black Sabbath debut is a territory often revisited, and very occasionally equaled, but surely never beaten in terms of sheer inspirational glory. The pace might be a bit slow for fans of speed metal and styles influenced by it, but if you can take a slow riff or two, then you need to hear this album. If you don't like this one, then you're probably not going to enjoy half the metal out there either.\n",
        "\nI have to be honest about a couple things right up front. First of all, I thought Ronnie James Dio was about ten times the singer Ozzy is. I think Heaven and Hell (or Dio-fronted Black Sabbath, however you choose to think of them) was in many ways a much better band than Black Sabbath fronted by Ozzy could ever be. And I agree that the constantly interrupting interview segments in The Last Supper keep this DVD from being a truly great concert DVD.\n\nAll that being said, though, I have to admit that there is/was something special about the original Black Sabbath lineup that simply works better than any other combination that has used the name \"Black Sabbath.\" You can feel it in the very opening of \"War Pigs\" right towards the beginning of the DVD. You can feel it in how relaxed and playful the members of the band are with each other in the interview segments. You can feel it palpably when you see Geezer and Tony play, in the way they interact with the audience, with Ozzy, with each other, and in the almost youthful energy with which they play when Ozzy is onstage.\n\nI got The Last Supper the week after I got Heaven and Hell Live at Radio City Music Hall. And even though, as I said above, I frickin' LOVED Dio, the difference between Heaven and Hell playing together in that DVD and Black Sabbath playing together in The Last Supper is like night and day. In the Heaven and Hell DVDs (both the Radio City performance and the Wacken performance captured on the Neon Nights DVD), the playing is top notch, but there is a certain kind of business-like atmosphere, compared to the playing on The Last Supper. Geezer in particular is way more laid back. And yes, I realize that there are several years between the Black Sabbath reunion concerts, and it's possible that some of the slightly more subdued atmosphere is simply due to the age of the musicians advancing. But I think it's more than that.\n\nI really think that Ronnie James Dio was such a strong frontman that any band, even the venerable Iommi and Butler, ends up looking a little like a backing band, playing with such a strong frontman. With Ozzy fronting the group, however, there's an amazing balance between all the members; you immediately get the sense that these guys all know each other so well, that they're 100% comfortable, 100% in their element.\n\nSo yes, it's kind of annoying that the interviews keep interrupting all the Sabbath classics being played live. Yes, Ozzy stumbles around the stage like some bizarre bag lady. And yes, this lineup probably has a snowball's chance in Hell of ever reuniting again. But one of the best reasons to get a live DVD of a metal band is to see something special take place, something that has had the great good fortune to be captured for posterity. And The Last Supper is that kind of document. For a very brief time, these guys who started playing music as kids got back together, and just enjoyed the hell out of talking together, playing together, and they recaptured a little bit of the old magic.\n",
        "\nFor their 13th album Black Sabbath (Tony Iommy) recruit ex- Alliance vocalist Tony Martin, whose sound is more in common with Ronnie James Dio more than anyone else. So in this release we see Sabbath heading more for a power metal direction in the vein of Heaven & Hell, except that this is even more epic with good focus on atmosphere. The songs are short and to the point and the song writing is terrific.\n\nAs usual Iommy is the main star of the album. His some of the heaviest riff work in years is displayed here. His leads are also superb and melodic at the same time. Tony Martin is a great vocalist and his vocals are great in the album. He has a great range and has a perfect voice for power metal. He also displays great mid range in many songs especially the title track. His ability to bring emotion into every song is just awesome.Keys which play a small role in the album of adding the epic atmosphere, are played by Geoff Nicholls. The drum work is OK not that great. The production is nice heavy and superb and gives every instrument it's proper, required balance. \n\nThe songs themselves are short and catchy. The riff work is great. Highlights include the opener \u2018The Shining\u2019 which has a catchy and epic chorus and a tremendous vocal performance by Martin. The next song \u2018Ancient Warrior\u2019 is slower, but has even more epic chorus than the opener. The atmosphere in both of these songs is just excellent. They carry a strange aura about them beaten only by Awaken the Guardian. \u2018Glory Ride\u2019 is another good song, not as good as the first 2 songs though. Somewhere around 2nd minute, it breaks into an excellent epic acoustic part, which sounds cool. \u2018Scarlet Pimpernel\u2019 is an acoustic instrumental. Once again great use of the \u2018Children of the Sea\u2019 like atmosphere. \u2018Lost Forever\u2019 is total speed metal, another essential highlight.The title track is totally amazing and is the best song in the album. It is slow, crushing doom metal, a stark contrast to the light, epic nature of the rest of the album. It destroys everything dark and wicked put out so far, by Sabbath. Martin makes use of his mid range here and man does it send a chill down your spine? Yes it does!The whole song does just that. The riff work by Iommy is nice, heavy and crushing. The ending is just apocalypse crushing, down everything in its path.\n\nAmong the weaker songs, \u2018Hard Life to Love\u2019 and \u2018Born to Lose\u2019 feature more life on the fast lane lyrics, which are at odds with the remaining epic tracks. Yet, they are catchy and enjoyable, having good pace, excellent riffs and again good vocal performance. \u2018Nightmare\u2019 is the worst song off the album. The riffs are, a bit less inspired compared to the others. Also it doesn't have a good pace nor good atmosphere, but still is quite a passable track, which just pales compared to the other tracks.\n\nContrary to popular belief, this actually is one of the better albums put out by Sabbath. They would go on to achieve much better results with the indisputable Tyr with such style. But the songwriting and the ability to create an epic atmosphere is very high and it is that which makes this album so enjoyable. So concluding, this is a fine album and is recommended to all without any hesitation.\n",
        "\nIt was the summer of 1976 and I was 11 years old. Tommy, my neighbor, ran up to me and said \"Billy, you got to hear this album I just got.\" Having nothing better to do I agreed to listen, and my life has never been the same as we arrived at his place and he pulled out We sold our Soul for Rock N' Roll and put it on. Besides having the grammatical flaw in it's title this is a classic piece of doom history. From the opening sounds of the storm I knew this was going to be something different, something daring, something scary as hell. I was a christian kid when I heard this and thought up til that point bands like Kiss and Blue Oyster Cult and the like were heavy. They weren't shit compared to the almighty Black Sabbath. These tracks and their original albums scared the hell out of me and put the fear of god in my heart.\n\nThe precursors to today's Black Metal? Maybe. One of the founders of Doom and stoner? Hell yeah. When I first heard Ozzy sing \" My name is Lucifer, please take my hand.\" it gave me nightmares. This put Alice Cooper and his nightmares to shame. Even the insane laughter at the end of Am I going Insane? was new and scary at the time. And I was instantly hooked.\n\nJump ahead to 1979 and I'm stoned and cutting school when I run into my friend Eric. He's like \" Bill I got a bag and tunes at the pad, wanna pop over?\" And I replied \" Hell yeah, whatcha got?\" And he replied \" A half and some Black Sabbath.\" And along we went to his pad. He broke out a bag, his bong, fired up the stereo and proceeded to play songs at random. \n\nWe coughed along with the beginning of Sweet Leaf and sang along with the pro-marijuana lyrics. Changes( A decent piano ballad) came on and I remembered how I played the song and sang along when my girlfriend, Kathy, broke up with me. I real good breakup song. Least it was good before Kelly Osbourne killed it.\n\nAs we got higher I remembered how I first felt at hearing songs like Paranoid, Iron Man and Children of the Grave. We talked about the songs on this double album set and both agreed this was some of the best shit we ever heard. This was the way doom was meant to be played, fuzzed, distorted, downtuned and desperate. And scary. Doom needs to have that feeling of danger, that fear inducing feeling that steadily gnaws at you because deep down we like to be scared and possibly need it too.\n\nJump to today and I'm high listening to these tunes and remembering long past daze gone bye. My youngest son is 18 and I am a Grandfather now and my how things have changed. Ozzy is doing commercials and Black Sabbath is basically history at the time of this review (March 8th-2011) and Songs like Paranoid, War Pigs and Iron Man are played daily on the local classic rock station.. I have not seen Tommy or Eric in ages and I owe them both a big thanks for introducing me to these sounds. My youngest is in the Living room playing Warriors of rock on the X-Box. The song Children of the grave is coming at me as he plays it flawlessly. And we are still living in scary times with the same fears and new ones. And these songs still hold up, timeless they shall remain to entertain us and dare I say, still scare.\n\nThis is a good greatest hits package and a good starting place for those who want to know what true doom is and for those who like to be scared. \"Oh noooooooooooooo, please God help me!\" Accept no substitute, this was one of the originals and I would have to say best doom band and deserves to be in any fan of the genre's collection. With every song a classic on this collection you can do no wrong by getting it. Or better yet buy the original albums the songs came from. Either way add these metal gods to your collection if you have not done so already. You will be glad you did.\n\nKeep it Heavy.\n\nPeace.\n",
        "\nIts hard to believe that metal started four decades ago, so much has happened in the genre since then. We can thank Black Sabbath for all of our beloved metal music; it can all be traced back to them. They did not only start a genre, they were also masters of playing it. Even their earliest songs, like these ones, are solid gold. \n\n\"Evil Woman\" is a cover of the band Crow. While not their most metal song, it is one of my favorites. While not technically all that good, Ozzy's trademark ghastly voice shows that perfection can be found in flaw. While he is singing about a deceptive temptress, Tony Iommi's simplistic distorted power chords provides catchy repetition. While many bands push the bass to the background, Black Sabbath don't follow such conventions. In this song, the bass plays an even more important role than the guitar. The main riff is an alternating patter of power chords and bass lines. As usual, Tony shreds away on the guitar but Geezer Butler's bass mini bass solos really steal the show.\n\n\"Wicked World\" showcases Iommi's uncanny ability to produce amazing solos. Even though he recently lost a fingertip in an industrial accident, Tony plucks away with ability above the vast majority of guitar players. While Ozzy wails on about about gloom and despair, Iommi plays his memorable doom-laced power chords. Bill Ward shows his talent by dishing out drum rolls between steady beats. This song is very good, especially considering that it is Black Sabbath's first original composition. \n\nIf you are looking back into metal's roots, this is the place to start; these are some of the first metal songs. While many bands like Deep Purple and Led Zeppelin came close, Black Sabbath took the leap and began a new style of music. These two songs are perfect examples of how Black Sabbath took blues influenced rock'n'roll and made it into something different.\n",
        "\nTechnical Ecstasy is often considered the first really bad album in Black Sabbath's catalog. With all the legendary things that band did up to that point, it's worthy of reconsideration.\n\nTo understand it, you have to see how the band got to this point. They had released four consecutive mind-blowingly amazing albums in a span of three years: 1970's Black Sabbath and Paranoid, 1971's Master of Reality, and 1972's Black Sabbath Vol. 4. Every one of these albums is an amazing classic. To record even one album that good is reserved for the very best musicians around. To record two of them is extremely rare, and usually requires more than a couple months in between. To do four, in three years, is absolutely astounding.\n\nSo, it's easy to understand why they chose to go for more experimentation on the following year's Sabbath Bloody Sabbath. And the experimentation paid off. Many would even put that album on par with the previous four. After that, they took more time off, waiting until 1975 to release Sabotage. That album continued the experimentation, and in many ways it was still paying off. But with both of these, they still maintained the core, heavy Sabbath sound.\n\nBy 1976, the band must have been exhausted from this insane touring and release schedule. They played around and experimented even further on Technical Ecstasy. \n\nIt starts with \"Back Street Kids\", which is essentially a far less interesting version of \"Children of the Grave\". The follow-up, \"You Won't Change Me\", is a criminally forgotten classic by the band. It's sort of psychedelic gothic doom metal replete with organ. In a sense, it's recent Cathedral, only three decades earlier.\n\nThen it would appear the label put some other band's song on the album. \"It's Alright\" is a boring piano ballad with Bill Ward providing vocals. It is completely out of place on a Sabbath album, but here it is nonetheless.\n\n\"Gypsy\" starts out as fairly standard Sabbath (in the more upbeat parts of that sound) before going into a story told by Osbourne in spoken word with ridiculous piano in the background. That part derails the song, making it hard to appreciate the rest of the song, which is actually quite good once Iommi takes center stage.\n\nWhat should have been outtakes follow on the next couple tracks. \"All Moving Parts (Stand Still)\" is driven by an unimaginative vocal melody from Osbourne, and \"Rock 'N' Roll Doctor\" sounds more like a Lynyrd Skynyrd reject than anything related to metal.\n\n\"She's Gone\", featuring an understated acoustic riff and strings, is what \"Changes\" should have been, and actually isn't that bad. But after that comes \"Dirty Women\". Why they buried this classic tune at the end of the album I'll never understand. It has a killer heavy riff, great bassline, good use of organ, badass drumming, and a catchy vocal hook--everything you could possibly want. \n\nThe Verdict: Technical Ecstasy should never have been a proper studio album. Other than \"Back Street Kids\", \"You Won't Change Me\", and \"Dirty Women\", it comes off as a collection of rarities and B-sides. But it's easy to understand how they got to this point, and it should have been obvious the original lineup wouldn't last long after this point.\n\nOriginally written for http://fullmetalattorney.blogspot.com/\n",
        "\nI'll never forget this one time standing in line to report back in from a liberty port call in Singapore when I was in the service overhearing a conversation between two other guys sharing what they did that night. Usually such exchanges have to do with their drinking experiences that night and where the best \"masseuses\" reside and how many they did. On a Navy ship, blather about such indulgences are as casual and mundane as housewives shooting the shit at a tupperware party. I wasn't struck by tales of strippers pulling razorblades out of their twats or bar fights with Royal servicemen. No, what caught me by attention was the sailor who was matter of factly reporting that he and so and so went and saw Black Sabbath play a gig in a club that night and got the autograph of Tony Iommi and singer Tony Martin afterwards. He was met with an \"oh\" and the conversation moved on to other persons, places and things of relevancy. \"Oh\". And hence, I will always associate that little second hand moment with this era of the band as very \"oh.\" After all, this wasn't any old heavy metal band that may or may not have been heard of by the average Joe. This was Black fucking Sabbath. Or at least what was left of them which sorry to say was not much because if Tyr is the best album from the Tony Martin days, then you need not be bothered unless you are satisfied by name brand appeal alone which I suspect is the case with many people.\n\nNot that this record is bad by any stretch but it really isn't much more than average heavy/power metal with predictable melodies and plenty of filler. That may be good enough for most other bands that play this type of thing but it is NOT good enough for Black Sabbath. Am I putting too broad a perspective on this band after all these years of them having been around? Perhaps. Fellow Brummie Tony Martin is a workman like vocalist with a good set of lungs for heavy metal and I can see why Tony Iommi hired him even if he really is just a second rate traditional metal wailer in the vein of Ronnie Dio. I suppose it also explains alot that Martin wrote all the lyrics on the album. Norse mythology is one of my favorite subjects but I'm not certain that the band plays it up all that well here on this album. Black Sabbath may be Tony Iommi's band but listening to Tyr, I realized just how much Geezer Butler was important for musical vitality in some of the band's heavier sound. He worked well with Iommi in those classic times. Geezer was very much a contributor on Born Again and that was the last album that could be said to be truly \"heavy\". Ian Gillan's half-ass performances for that tour still outshines anything Tony Martin does on Tyr. No disrespect to Martin but it just illustrates the haves and have nots that the guitarist had to work with because one thing that this album strikes me as is that it's kind of soft and quiet. More importantly, Iommi's riff writing is very pedestrian here. There is nothing on it that will make you go \"yeah, that's Black Sabbath right there!\" Where's the heaviness and energy? Well I guess I could point out some examples but they are more in the power metal vein but it's not as heavy as Born Again or Mob Rules.\n\nAnno Mundi starts things off with an opening chord nearly identical to Children of the Sea. Just one more reminder that everything here sounds like the band is trying to rehash Heaven and Hell to very mixed results. I will admit this is a good song to listen to on it's own merits. It's very catchy and melodic. But when a Black Sabbath album sounds more like Manowar and Crimson Glory, it's a problem. Anno Mundi is much more progressively textured than the song it tries to emulate but that doesn't mean it's any better. The second track called Law Maker is quite the lame filler song. Cozy Powell was a great drummer and his rollicking hits similar to what he did on Rainbow's Rising is quite recognizable on this song but as much I love that band, it sounds way too much like them than Sabbath. Even Tony Iommi's progressions and speedier soloing are highly derivative of Blackmore. In of itself, that's kind of cool but the song just doesn't do anything for me one bit. \n\nNow as for Jerusalem, I will admit this a very good track with wonderful catchiness to it. It's still stuck in my head. I know I am one to rag on Tony Martin alot but he is the best part of the song. His singing sounds so much like David Coverdale on this track that it's scary. So I guess he can do more than just RJD impressions after all. Again, a good song but is it a good Black Sabbath song? \n\nThe Sabbath Stones has a couple good bits to it but I think it's yet one of the weaker songs on Tyr. I would say it's closest in feel (slightly) to Black Sabbath's doomier sound that the band was much more known for. It has one of those transitions into melancholy with the mellotrone and acoustic guitar passage and the song sounds like an admixture when the riffs and chorus speed up like that found in the final passage of Heavan and Hell. I didn't like the opening however. I felt Martin's delivery sounded forced and prosaic. This track sounds like it would've worked better had it been done on Born Again. \n\nThe centerpiece of Tyr is really the next three songs. The Battle of Tyr is a pretty majestic instrumental to introduce the suite Odin's Court and Valhalla. These are pretty good songs actually and I wish they would have worked this whole Old Norse concept longer throughout the record although in the first minute or so into Odin's Court with that soft acoustic passage I kept expecting to hear \"fade away, fade away, break the crystal ball.\" Neil Murray is hired help but I really enjoy his bass work on Valhalla. His four strings are engineered quite impressively into the track giving it an epic quality into the stormy forefront of sound. Are these three songs awesome? Almost. Are they classic Sabbath? No. To deem any Tony Martin era material classic would be to marginalize the impact the term \"classic\" has when used in that fashion ESPECIALLY when applied to such a band as Black Sabbath. It's indefensible. \n\nAnd contrary to what you might believe, it doesn't have all to do with Tony Martin because yes, I like Tyr better than the Dio fronted Dehumanizer album which I thought was perfunctory in its heaviness in that it sounded as if what worked for Judas Priest with Painkiller might work for Sabbath with Dehumanizer. It didn't. So there is no pure Dio bias either. Tyr has it's moments(Jerusalem, Odin's Court/Valhalla). It has some catchy songs(Anno Mundi and Heaven in Black) but mostly it has too much of an aftermarket feel with this lineup. The filler songs are too distressing to overcome because it sounds like a band grasping for relevance. Seriously, who ever gets excited about albums like Tyr or worse, The Eternal Idol? It's all very \"oh.\"\n",
        "\nBlack Sabbath's Vol. 4 was a major milestone in their creative thinking and their production. This was the first time the band had really tasted success, and the proof is in the pudding. (Even though their second album, Paranoid, was their biggest hit even to this day, they didn't get much money from it; it wasn't until after their third album, Master Of Reality, that they really got to cash in on their success.) Sabbath had been opened to a world of drugs, women, mansions, and cars that was beyond what they could've imagined. They could buy all the cocaine they could snort, and they took advantage of that, and it is evident in the content on the album.\n\nHowever, Black Sabbath had a way of turning quite negative things into large assets that essentially brought about their success. In this case, they took the abundance of drugs that they were taking to create some truly powerful music. Bassist Geezer Butler used his excellent lyric-writing abilities to piece together some words worthy of rivaling Pink Floyd, with the rest of the band laying down some excellent instrumental and vocal work.\n\nThe songs on Vol. 4 are significantly crisper and cleaner sounding than their previous album. Tony Iommi's guitar has really satisfying crunch, and Bill Ward's drums sound really polished and professional. This is also the height of Ozzy Osbourne's vocal ability; his voice was in top-shape from large tours, he had finally mastered the art of harnessing his sheer power, and the effects of drug use and the long-term effects of performing hadn't killed the lower end of his voice. All in all, Black Sabbath was force to reckoned with during the writing and recording of this album.\n\nSongs like Snowblind, Supernaut, and the eight-minute epic Wheels of Confusion were stylistically the classic Black Sabbath everyone knew from the previous three albums, but the production value of the songs is through the roof, but still have the raw power that inspired the shock-rock genre. \n\nThe album also has some more innovative material, such as St. Vitus Dance and Tomorrow's Dreams. They weren't necessarily as pure and disctinctive as some of their other works, but they were driving, rhythmic pieces that would dictate much of Sabbath's later styles. \n\nSabbath also took a lighter approach with songs like Laguna Sunrise, a double acoustic piece with some great melodies, and the piano ballad titled Changes, which could rival Elton John and Billy Joel with surprising credilbilty.\n\nFurthermore, songs Cornucopia and Under The Sun were aeolian-mode scale based songs that gave hint to some of Sabbath's more signature songs yet to come, and even their definitive doom metal feel. \n\nAlong with experimental piece \"FX\", merely a two-minute mosaic of sound effects seemingly taken from the page of Pink Floyd, Black Sabbath's fourth album is complete. Vol. 4 represent's Black Sabbath's new-found love of excess, something that although it ultimately brought about their demise, allowed them to create some fantastic music. Definitely not an album to be taken lightly.\n",
        "\nMy relation to the Black Sabbath 1983 album \"Born Again\" has been changing a lot since I once heard it on Youtube two years ago. At first my reaction was, like most sane people's \"What the F**K is this? crappy mix, weird screams etc.\" \"Deep Sabbath\" have been hated by many, to some extent even by themselves. But one day when I was really bored I forced myself to listen through the album on youtube one more time, after all, it IS sabbath.\n\nI am glad I did that, it made me realise what a masterpiece this album really is. In my opinion this is THE darkest album ever released by Black Sabbath. \n\n- Did he say the best???? is he insane??? \n\nNo I never said that. There are Sabbath releases that are musically finer than this one, but none of them manage to create such an evil atmosphere. The theme of the album does actually seem to be thought through (even though some parts of it are just random). The cover was meant to be rejected, but it fits into the theme better than anything else. The instrumental songs \"Stonehenge\" and \"The Dark\" together with parts of \"Born Again\" and \"Disturbing the Priest\" give one more dimension to the album, making it more than just another metal release. \n\nOK, but what about Gillan? To many people, partly including himself, he was one of the major problems on the album. He wasn't Sabbath, he wasn't metal, he isn't good at all etc etc. Now, thats all crap. In Born Again Gillan founds a new use for his unique screaming. Instead of the more correct and balanced screams in \"Child in Time\" he screams like a demon, very well fitting into the main theme of \"Born Again\". The most wicked song on the album in my opinion would be \"Disturbing the Priest\" since it combines the devilish laughter of Ian with the dark atmosphere created mainly by Nichols and Iommi. When on tour, Gillan had problems singing some of the old sabbath songs, he said himself that \"I just couldn't relate to the lyrics\". But he did bring something more into the tune \"Black Sabbath\", again with that evil laughter.\n\nThe weakest part of the album? Definitely the mix. Ok, I understand some people that claim it to be a part of the whole dark and evil thing but seriously, its been taken too far. Especially when listening to Hot Line, you just want to close your eyes and imagine yourself remixing the song, you start dreaming about how good it could be... But reality is that its not, the excellent music makes up for it, but thats no excuse. The Demos are not much better, simply because they are demos. But sometimes it can be liberating to listen to them instead of the original album.\n\nOverall the album is a one-of-a-kind evil, dark and interesting release. Today I think of this album as my greatest inspiration, again not since it's the best album I have ever heard, but it's different... And even though what is different is doomed to be misunderstood, I always get a special kind of feeling when those simple first tunes of \"Born Again\" ripple through the air.\n",
        "\nBlack Sabbath continued to elicit more of that demonic skepticism that the era deserved with this 1971 heavy metal record. Master of Reality is eight songs of depressed euphoria. The sixties are gone and the whole album plays like a savage rebuttal to the hippie optimism of Turn! Turn! Turn!. So no, there is not a time for peace and it is too late. You spin this record and you will learn there is only time to pay the piper, point the blame and leave this mortal coil. The debut record and Paranoid broke in these themes as well but Master of Reality is their greatest album and I find it's more polished than even those classics.\n\nThe genius of this record lies in its straight on, more focused bluntness and as it so happens, simplicity in structure. But even more, it doesn't feel like a concerted effort to be as such. It just feels natural. The band did this album not too long after Paranoid and seeking out another album to write and continue the trademark heaviness feels comfortable. The previous two records amped up a blues influence that made them so heavy but Master of Reality is where an inadvertent incorporation of classic music comes into play when it comes to the mechanics. Listen to Sweet Leaf: a simple heavy chord structure with unorthodox drum beats throughout the first half and when it transitions to the solo, that's where the clarity of that classical composition can be heard. I don't know which 1971 song was written down first but Sweet Leaf's rhythm structure has a commonality with Black Dog by Led Zeppelin. \n\nAnd then After Forever is the beau ideal of more of that symphony riff style that Tony Iommi made use of in the two following albums. Bach himself would have been proud to hear that transition break where the thick time-stop thumps the middle followed by Tony's patented blues soloing that goes back to the eponymous record. None of this type of songwriting made sense to anyone prior to when Sabbath came along. It was dark and devilish..pioneering. No one was ready for it but the time was right and that's why this band has left such an impact. The song takes an accusatory Christian stance against hypocrisy and doubt but this is no sermon. This is doom! Religion and its cursory judgment goes well with this heavy metal music that Black Sabbath creates particularly English 17th-century prosecution of it. That's where the classical music influence comes in handy. The short but witch-y folk interlude of Embryo sounds arbitrary but its the type of bauble that gives Master of Reality its doom metal character. Maybe you have We Sold Our Soul for Rock N' Roll or another compilation album that has Children of the Grave but that song just isn't complete without Embryo to introduce it with. \n\nAnyone who is familiar with doom metal will automatically recognize the rumble of Children of the Grave by rote. Tony's rollicking down tempo aggressive riffs, Ozzy's wailing about nuclear uncertainty backed by his delirious pigeon claps make this one of Black Sabbath's most catchiest tunes. Yet another song that is not fit to be sung by anyone else other than Ozzy. Maybe that's why Children of the Sea was written to complement it nine years later. I won't get into comparisons with that era of the band. I like them both but what makes Master of Reality tops is that it doubles back unto itself. How it does that is after the atomic destruction minded song Children of the Grave ends, another darkly mellow instrumental interlude returns only to be followed by Lord of This World; a track coherent with Children of the Grave and After Forever throwing out a blue print for how the later subgenre of doom metal should and did sound like. Solitude is a gloomy number that reinforces the depression of it all. Ozzy sings it with an ever so dreary demeanor and it follows suit to the feeling that Planet Caravan evoked. Basically, Sabbath is establishing a pattern of how their albums will sound like because like the ever familiar Iron Man, Into the Void is another track that everyone will remember the band by. The speed and chugginess of it right after a song like Solitude strengthens the overall heaviness of Master of Reality. And it\u2019s a way superior song to Iron Man as well. They did rip off a little bit of their own song because after the third verse it sounds a lot like Electric Funeral. I was singing along to it and almost sang the main chorus to that track! One more notable thing at play about Into the Void is Geezer\u2019s stern bass . It drifts from trailing Tony\u2019s parts to following Ozzy\u2019s vocals in an almost dancing manner. \n\nI might feel guilty picking Master of Reality as the band\u2019s best record just because it is so hard to choose of the bunch. They\u2019ve recorded some classic albums from 1970 to 1981 and if it is their best, an album like Sabbath Bloody Sabbath or Mob Rules is not too far behind but Master of Reality defines from each song to song what I think of when their name comes up. A heavy metal album from 1971 with music about war, peace, betrayal and annihilation is apropos. It was also my first album from them and everybody in the band sounds much better on here than before. But more importantly, the dark and heavy sound will smack you harder if you are a fan of rock music from the late 60\u2019s and early 70\u2019s. The message? Flower power is over. Time to get with Reality!\n",
        "\nThis review is for the 1-disc remastered version which was released in the late 90s. I think it's been remastered yet again in a 2-disc format, similar to the original release. That being said, this version is edited, allegedly to fit the playing time, and as a result we lose a bass solo and part of the drum solo if memory serves. Some spoken intros to songs are missing too. Long ago I owned the cassette version and the differences between this release and the original were noticable but minimal.\n\nI never had that much of a problem with the sound quality of this album. The remaster sounds much better but it's still not perfect. In my view, my sound expectations for live albums has always been rather low, so if i like the music I can usually forgive less than perfect sound quality. Your mileage may vary.\n\nThis is the Black Sabbath Mark 2.25 version with Ronnie James Dio on vocals, two albums in from taking over for Ozzy Osbourne, and also features Vinny Appice on drums who took over for Bill Ward. The set list is a nice mix of classic Sabbath tunes, none newer than their third album, and new songs the previous two albums featuring Dio. \n\nDio sounds completely focused all the way through (as does the rest of the band). He has such a forceful and powerful voice, whether it be hitting the softer and emotional notes of \"Children of the Sea\" or belting out a loud, evil, sadistic growl (not death metal growl obviously) on \"Black Sabbath\". He also lays down some improvised vocals on \"Voodoo\" and \"Heaven and Hell\", although it's possible that those sections were part of the original writing and just left off their respective albums. I say that because Dio routinely uses the additional lyrics during performances of both songs.\n\nDio is a vocal and songwriting force to be reckoned with. Whether or not the band split strictly due to arguments over the production of this record is immaterial now. The important thing is that Dio had a creative explosion both during and immediately after his tenure with Sabbath, producing 4 utterly brilliant albums between 1980 and 1984, and the world is a better place as a result.\n\nFor those of you who've enjoyed Black Sabbath's music post-Ozzy, this album is the point where Tony Iommi settled on his now-trademark guitar tone. The dry, clearer rhythm and soloing style with a lot less blues influence started here in my opinion, probably due to this being the first time I had heard the \"classic\" Sabbath tracks played with this particular guitar tone. During the 70s Iommi seemed to experiment a lot more with blues and such, and from this point forward he is a full-on metal guitarist. Thats fine with me, as he never forgot how to lay down quality riffs and music as long as he had a strong group of songwriters to team up with. The guitar sound is a bit muddy here, in particular the faster break on \"Iron Man\" could stand to bring the guitar up in the mix, but overall I never had a problem hearing what was being played. This is also the first time I remember hearing that opening solo during \"Black Sabbath\" that's been used ever since.\n\nGeezer Butler's basslines seem to come in and out on this recording, volume-wise. During some of the ripping sections of \"The Mob Rules\" you can clearly hear Geezer, then he seems to fade in and out. The same thing happens throughout the whole album. Its difficult to explain because it's not always noticible unless you are keying your ear to the bassline, and it doesn't really take away from the verall sound of the record for some reason. Kinda odd. his playing is excellent of course.\n\nVinnie Appice had such a massive drum sound during his tenure with Sabbath and the early Dio days. He is absolutely crushing that kit and I'd wager that there was no heavier drum sound to be found back in 1981-82. This remaster gives the drums a bit more oomph, a welcome change. Appice is just plain heavy and mostly precise, although his heavy-handed trademark sound makes any errors stand out much more. I think Appice single-handedly saved \"Mob Rules\" from being a clone of \"Heaven and Hell\", but that's a discussion for a \"Mob Rules\" review.\n\nOverall I enjoy this album, although the sound is not flawless and I'm not always in the mood for Dio's versions of the classic Sabbath songs. The reason this loses points in 2010 is because we now have the wonderful Heaven & Hell \"Live at Radio City Music Hall\" album, which smokes \"Live Evil\" in every way. That album has a better overall sound quality and not an Ozzy song in sight. So, officially this album is getting a 74 from me, which would have been an 84 if the H&H live album didn't exist. Oh, that's not fair, you say? Bite me.\n",
        "\nWith the Born Again-lineup falling apart around him, and even Geezer, the bassist who had stood by him since the inception of the band, was leaving, Tony Iommi decided it was time to lay Black Sabbath to rest, at least for a while. Instead, he concentrated on making a solo album; something with maybe a lighter touch than what people had come to expect from Black Sabbath. A return to roots of sorts, taking cues from old blues and rock, while combining them with newer influences emerging in the western world. However, this was not meant to be. Due to label pressure, he was forced to release Seventh Star under the moniker Black Sabbath - not as a solo album - albeit the label conceded to tag on a description to clear up any confusions about the band. The description was \"featuring Tony Iommi\" which is rather confusing considering Iommi was one of the founders of the band and had always been a member.\n\nNow that the context of the album is established as something of a return to Iommi's musical roots, yet under a lot of pressure from the label, the end product clearly resembles this. The first part of the album plays out like something from a cheesy 80s hard rock album. In for the Kill is made out to be a hit single for the crowds: simple staccato riffs with some long power chords thrown in, something a person who has never picked up a guitar could almost play, singalong melodies with puerile lyrics about the band not backing down from its position at the top of the pack. For the other label-forced hit song there's No Stranger to Love, not that surprisingly a power ballad about being hurt by love yet not being afraid of going for it again. It's appropriately melancholic with its verses, but where it fails is the chorus with its sappy major chord melodies. It would be a good situation to showcase Hughes's higher range, but supposedly with all of his problems at the time, they wanted to avoid that.\n\nThe middle part of the album is more of a standard Sabbath fare: Turn to Stone is this album's Neon Knights or Turn Up the Night, rapid pace with drums leading the way and very rocking riffs. The way the song is constructed with the verses subtly changing to the chorus and then back is very reminiscent of the aforementioned Neon Knights. Definitely an album opener if it wasn't for the label single. The title track is the long epic song of the album, sort of like Children of the Sea or Sign of the Southern Cross. It goes forward with a plodding pace with little variation and isn't quite up to the level of its predecessors. While serving as an advertisement for Eric Singer's lack of ability and flair when compared with the likes of Bill Ward or Vinny Appice, the song - together with its intro, Sphinx (The Guardian) is also an advertisement for the rarely heard talent of Geoff Nichols. The cool little intro, wholly his work, builds slowly into a crescendo just like it should and the background keyboards with their majestic sound give the most important part of the atmosphere on the song itself. But even combined with Iommi's great (yet sparse) leads, the song feels a little hollow due to Hughes not being at his best.\n\nIt's a real joy to hear Iommi and Hughes really letting it all go for the monster of a blues song that is Heart Like a Wheel. Iommi just never stops. With two extended solo sections and a shifting, bluesy, melodic riff playing whenever he isn't soloing, he is always busy. In the first solo he goes a little flashier than what he usually plays, but brings it down for a blues-type in the end and the second one is almost completely in that vein. But no matter what style, Iommi makes it fit the song with class. Due to its blues roots, the song doesn't feature a lot of changes in rhythm so the bass and the drums are there just to provide a backbone for the guitar to perform against. Hughes gets a couple of emotional, stretched, high screams here, which show that even though he wasn't in good shape, he could still perform well in ideal conditions.\n\nThe three last songs, Heart Like a Wheel, Angry Heart and In Memory (though the last two are really one song split onto two tracks), form the best and most unique part of this album. The imbued yearning and melancholy for glories and achievements past is at their core which is why the bluesiness adds a whole lot to them. While Heart Like a Wheel introduces the loss and fleeting nature of all things, Angry Heart/In Memory is how those things affect a person. Angry Heart is the heaviest song on the album and has a lot of forward momentum. It's not going to stop for anything. That momentum is driven by the pounding drums and guitars while a hammond, reminiscent of Perfect Strangers, adds a flair of its own to it. This is the exasperation and fury at the loss of the most important thing in your life, while In Memory is the sadness and melancholy brought on by the acceptance of said loss. A very calm and moody piece, with Hughes singing gently, simple, quiet riffs from the distorted guitar and a soothing acoustic guitar melody in the forefront. Hughes brings the song and the album to a climatic end with some screams where he gives it his all while the audio fades away.\n\nAs said before, the trilogy forms what is the core of the album with its blues-tinted melancholy and were the album a single with just them, it would get a very high rating. However, it is preceeded by a bunch of songs which, while not bad on their own, don't fit thematically or musically together and don't reach the same heights as the ending trilogy.\n",
        "\nThis album is easily worthy of a perfect rating. But I'm sure that some will say that \"Paranoid\" or \"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\" is better. Compared to the three albums prior to this one and the one that would come after, this record is a bit ignored. But this album hits just as hard, and sometimes harder than all of the other early 70's Black Sabbath albums. It's full of the gloom and doom that we all love. \n\nThe music doesn't really differ that much from the typical early 70's Black Sabbath albums. Ozzy's vocals are the same. Tony's guitar is still heavy and down tuned. Geezer and Bill are still a powerful rhythm section. \n\nNow let's get to the songs. There is some slow, heavy and bluesy stuff on here, most notably \"Wheels Of Confusion/The Straightener\", and the unmelodic dark song \"Under The Sun/Every Day Comes And Goes\". There are some more upbeat songs too. Such as \"Tomorrow's Dream\", my personal favorite \"Supernaut\", and \"St. Vitus' Dance\". A cool doom metal band from Los Angeles got their name {Saint Vitus} from the previously mentioned song. \"Cornucopia\" is a mid paced song and seems political. Another very catchy song in the slower range is \"Snowblind\", and it is indeed about cocaine. There are also a few misfit songs on here as well. The melodic instrumental known as \"Laguna Sunrise\" is Tony Iommi showcasing his guitar skills with a harp in the back round. \"Changes\" is just a piano ballad {I hate that word!} with some sappy violins in the back round, not that bad but is miles behind the ominous heavy stuff. And last but not least there is \"FX\", which every Black Sabbath fan except me hates. It is really just a bunch of beeps and noises, I actually like it a lot. The name \"FX\" really says it all for this one. \n\nThis album is essential to every collection of metal albums. As are the other early Black Sabbath albums. You can easily find this album online. So put down that Slayer, Venom, Bathory, or whatever evil metal you're listening too, and check out the band that started it all. You will not be disappointed.\n",
        "\nThere it stood on the display shelf. Monumental. Flanked and almost camouflaged by other gaudy but less maverick looking records. If I was describing something this lucid and capturing during adulthood, it would probably be about that one glowing femme fatale in a gin joint guarded by two girlfriends each of strategically polarizing physical qualities for balanced protection. But no, in this encounter I was not be inhibited by the lame games of later life. Sure, this album whispered something but not of the devious sort of chatter that a woman in a bar would to her two social sentries about you looking her way \"..so if a stranger sees you, don't look into his eyes 'cause it's Voodoo..\" I had no idea what the album was or who it was by. All I knew was, it was diabolical looking and heavy; a herd of executioners regarding me with baleful persecution through their bloody robes with no heads. Did this album find me? As a child, going to the record store was among the most enjoyably fascinating experiences. Perusing through all those exotic looking album covers of some newfangled movement in music alien to me after only after having access to whatever hackneyed feminist singer-songwriter or once-on-the-fringe of revolution(yeah whatever) rock albums my mother kept in the armoire . But the record shop was the armory when it came it to checking out the real booty. Well, one Friday night my father took me to the mall \"..turn up the night, it feels so right!..\" This was around early 1982 and I was just a scrawny six year old with a stringy mop cut wearing Lacoste polo shirts so I am retroactively exempt from any undue accusations of encountering metal in a shopping mall. Anyway, if going off alone under the album's seductive trance potentially put me in danger of becoming the next Adam Walsh, then so be it I was enthralled; helpless to its charms of danger and depiction of bedlam. \n\nWelcome to Mob Rules: Black Sabbath's second best album after Master of Reality. Does my nostalgic value color my opinion of it? Yes, but so what? Most hardcore metal fans strike me as the drippy crowds for yesteryear anyway which is why newer metal material isn't as respected. And besides, it's got tremendous songs and fervor when you get right down to it. I agree with most everyone that this album is back to the classic doom metal sound but still die cut from the Heaven and Hell record which explains why most each track feels like it's a sequel of sorts to a respective song from that 1980 album. But this is a formula that works very well. It's a better album. It's an upgrade. I'll never agree with the many who think Heaven and Hell is better than this \"..you're all fools, the mob rules!..\" While their previous album was quite good, it sounded too much like a hybridization of Rainbow and Black Sabbath. And really, I had no problem with even that for a first get together. Mob Rules is a more confident and consolidated piece of work. The band drew from their strengths from Heaven and Hell and improved on it here with more aggressiveness and bite. \n\nYou got the first song of Turn Up the Night with a thickset and chunky exuberance. Tony Iommi's riffs are pretty feisty on the song going into a colorful and spin happy wah peddle. The band seems to be playing in good cheer for the start of this new release. Voodoo slows things down a little. It was a song that reminded me of Hell\u2019s Bells since the beats and riffs resemble it. With this song, I noticed Geezer Butler goes back to the style of trailing Tony\u2019s guitar. I like how Dio sings this song. Wailing and howling the simple chorus with energy. It was this song that made me pretty sure this was album was going to be even better. There\u2019s no filler on this record. There should be at least one but I can\u2019t say there is. That is not mean all the tracks are equally good but it sure is close packed and alas, the sum equals the whole. I enjoy it as a whole album taken altogether and at the same time it\u2019s packed with a couple very strong tracks to anchor it all together.\n\nAnother reason why I find it amazing that Mob Rules is underrated compared next to Heaven and Hell is because with this lineup on this very album, Black Sabbath brings back the doom metal sound but yet still manages to retool it as their own unique style and even bring influence to other doom bands who used Mob Rules as their calling card influence of doom; most prominently Candlemass. Listening to that Swedish doom band, I am always reminded of this album with the songs The Sign of the Southern Cross, Country Girl and Falling Off the Edge of the World in particular. Heaven and Hell was sort of doom-y but more in line with the power metal genre while Mob Rules is influential to epic doom as again Candlemass or Solitude Aeturnus \u201c..You know I've seen the faces of doom..\u201d \n\nThe little instrumental interlude has returned. I know E5150 might be one of the band\u2019s more disposable items of the sort but I thought it was a quite cool and heavy bridge between Sign of the Southern Cross and the title track. You hear that high pitched electronic sound creeping in at the end of Sign of the Southern Cross\u2019s fadeout and it only enhances the feeling of impending doom coming right at you. Just to give you an idea of how well this works, my friend had this album ripped onto his mp3. He was playing the album through one day but with the way the entire record was uploaded, there would be a noticeable gap of like one second off between the songs as though it was loaded track by track with no discernable continuity for the actual master spacing. So when Sign of the Southern Cross was fading out you could hear just a little bit of the E5150 at the very end of the track but then it there was that second or maybe even only half second gap cutoff into the next song proper. It totally threw everything off. I was pissed. The effect was ruined. Even though E5150 does not seep into the title track, there the timing was still thrown off again for it because the song The Mob Rules actually comes in very suddenly and sooner than expected so then for that one there is yet another delay. \n\nSpeaking of the title track, The Mob Rules is one of Black Sabbath\u2019s best head banging songs. How could anyone not enjoy such a rambunctious and energetic track like this? I like the title tracks for heavy metal albums like these to standout and be among the most memorable and this is one of those glaring examples. E5150 and this title track are featured at the beginning of the Taarna segment of the 1981 film Heavy Metal and that was the best part of the movie. Falling Off the Edge of the World is another splendid epic doom song with Dio\u2019s gentle singing for lament to start it off until it comes back up full throttle into aggressive tritone goodness. When the song ends, Over and Over cuts in almost as fast as the title track did with E5150 which is a detail in of itself that almost makes me think it\u2019s a better end song than Lonely is the Word was for Heaven and Hell. I know one of Ronnie\u2019s influences as an aspiring singer growing up was Sam Cooke and on this last cut, he uses a lot of that Philly soul influence when he sings on Over and Over. If I had to decide though I would say this song is not better than the very similarly styled end song from the previous time out only because Iommi\u2019s solo on Over and Over is nothing special. I will say however, that this song is one of the tracks that showed Vinnie Appice\u2019s drumming to be a very good replacement for Bill Ward on the album. I thought he sounded a lot like Ward\u2019s style and to top it off, he did a better job here than Bill did on Heaven and Hell. \n\nAs I stared at the record (or was it staring at me?), some rock music was blaring very loudly on the store\u2019s speakers. They were not playing anything from this sinister album. I would not hear the album until many years later but the seed of what heavy metal was was planted in my mind at that moment even though at the time I did not know it. My first encounter was a visual one but even if I did not get to hear what was inside it, I didn\u2019t have to at that time for this is one of those albums that just speak to you and it was no leap of faith \u201c..there's a message inside as we build a new life from the past..\u201d If I stared long enough at it, a burning smoke would rise out from all around the album. A crackle and a cloud forming an image of a skeletal hand forming what looks like devil\u2019s horns\u2026\n",
        "\nI have been familiar with this album for many years but there was a time when I used to sit around having casual conversations with guys around my age and when the topic of Black Sabbath came up. Their faces were met with delight and enthusiasm. I remember asking several different mates on three different occasions if they liked the band when they had Ronnie Dio and the reaction was uniformly identical: a slow but decisive sway of the head from side to side before the end of my question. It was amazing. Was I the only one who had taken interest in this part of the band's career? Was John \"Ozzy\" Osborne really the be all end all of Black Sabbath? Where I have lived, it seems these Dio early Sabbath years has enjoyed a renaissance in the last dozen years. They are now older and old rules in the heavy metal world. In my opinion the songs on Heaven in Hell always had that \"old days\", growing up in the seventies and early eighties charm to me and I want to explain how. That being said, while I think this is a very good start of a new era, it has its shortcomings when compared to many of the band's other albums up to 1983. I think those dismissive smirks from my youth might have been thinking of Heaven and Hell when they thought of Dio fronted Sabbath. Find out why..\n\nThat this album was a major house cleaning is old, old news. Anyone can tell just by listening to it. I'm just going to flat out acknowledge what everyone else it seems is afraid to say in so many words: This album is \"Rainbath\". Please, that's not a pejorative description in this instance. Yes, it implies the same thing as the whole \"Van Hagar\" idiom when Sammy joined Eddie V's band but in this case it would not be negative like that one(to most). It's just the most direct way of getting across the fact that you can tell by the direction and harmonies that Dio was co-captaining this ship fresh off from his stint with Rainbow. And a more important difference, it only applies here to this album and this one only. It's a merger of Black Sabbath's sound and Rainbow's. That's all. I think this release was the made with the best of ambitions and optimism by all involved. And considering it was made in a relatively short period of time with some hectic personnel issues before hitting the recording studio says alot about the professionalism heard on the tracklist.\n\nAs I sit here, I'm looking at that list right now. Eight songs. All very neat and tidy; each hovering in and around a consistent runtime. It's a compact design although its length is normal for the day. Nothing too top heavy or unrefined which is something that couldn't be said about Sabotage and Technical Ecstasy. A conscious choice was made to not allow that here. The choice of producer was probably brought in at Dio's recommendation. Martin Birch's handling of this album is the reason why it sounds so shiny. Like with Whitesnake, Blue \u00d6yster Cult and here with Black Sabbath, his studio mentoring is very hands on where on Iron Maiden's albums his role as producer was more on the George Martin custodianship side of things as well as engineering.\n\nTony and Ronnie worked closely to make Neon Knights work as best an opener as possible. It might not have been the first song written but it was tailored and tweaked specifically to be the starter. This track is a self referential inauguration to announce this new stage of Black Sabbath; the fresh brightness of a neon light for the eighties. Were they being self prophetic with the lyric 'hold on good things never last'(acrimonious breakup two years later) and 'nothing's in the past it always seems to come again' (Dehumanizer and recent reunion under H&H)?\n\nThis would be the first release where Tony Iommi adopted a more modernistic change to heavy blues riffing from before that brought a mystical quality to accompany Dio's operatic style of singing. Gone are the straight doom riffs where everything else was written around those. In the previous lineup Tony would have to take charge of everything to get an album written but when Dio joined room had to be made to acommodate his creative experience with textured melodies. It's the reason why Heaven and Hell is not an all encompassing doom laden Sabbath album like before. \n\nThat also meant there is more separation. Since it's less of a spoke and wheel system, the bass has to assert itself more on it's own. No longer can Geezer's bass follow the riffs once the richer sense of placement for solos and Dio's operatic foundation are factored in. As a result, I think Geezer did a great job on here. I'm near certain the elevation to more complexities for an independent bass was at the encouragement of Birch as I noticed it was a style of playing later renowned of Steve Harris from Killers onwards.\n\nHowever, I cannot say that Bill Ward adapts very successfully on the album. His drumming is only adequate here but somehow sterile and perfunctory on half the songs especially on Neon Knights. His transitional rolls on the title track were catchy but on the slow beats at the beginning of the song they seemed lackadaisical and unenergetic.\n\nLady Evil and Wishing Well are filler songs. The latter I've sort of grown to accept because it is rather catchy. Since Ronnie does bring alot of the Rainbow sound, this is one if those songs that sound like it. And as for Lady Evil, it's easily the most filler. The bass is the only standout part but you won't be calling for this song at any Sabbath concert. Very forgettable. Since the album is relatively compact, it's disappointing that there are two filler tracks like that.\n\nDie Young isn't the most popular song in the band's catalog but I think it's an underrated little gem. It's more or less what power/speed metal would sound like a couple years later. It has a break of a mini-ballad in the middle of it that was very nice to hear. I've heard Rob Halford, Ian Gillan and Glenn Hughes sing their rendition of it and all of them sounded bad at it. This is Dio's song and everyone else should not try it. Walk Away is an almost straight rocker that sounds even more Rainbow-ish than the two filler songs(especially with the backing chorus) but Geezer's bass brings that old Sabbath sense to the upbeat track. Don't walk away from it. It should be good enough to grow on you after awhile.\n\nI meant what I said about Heaven and Hell not being top heavy. Lonely is the Word is great way to end the album. It's a testament to how well produced the record is. If the song had not ended up as the one to come out of the bullpen to close the game out, the album wouldn't be as good. That super eclectic riff that opens it is a beautiful thing of heavy metal! Overall, the song is a melancholic doom-y ballad. I love the soft, jazzy solo that Tony plays at the two minute mark because it has a quaint atmosphere of loneliness from the grave. Its sounds identical (but more downtrodden and abridged) to Mick Abrahams' solo on the 1968 Jethro Tull song Cat's Squirrel. With this closing track, I guess it's the right time to mention the keyboard work done on Heaven and Hell. Only were keys used sporadically on previous albums. While they're only a little more present than before, it's noticeable enough when you go up and down through the playlist. They decorate the production nicely and enhance the luster of a brand new sound going into 1980.\n\nAlot of people have made up their minds when it comes to how they view this album. I'm glad it's gotten more appreciation so many years since after it was released. It's not their best,no. It's worthy but hardly addictive next to other Black Sabbath albums.There was a time when a heavy metal diehard had to be a closeted fan of this recording. Are there still many of those who have yet to make the decision? You know what decision...Get off that carousel and ride the well.\n",
        "\nTo talk about a Black Sabbath CD without reference to the band\u2019s story and their influence on the genre is a pretty difficult task, because it is when you listen to albums like \u2018Master of Reality\u2019 that the ENTIRE groundplan of metal magically begins to unfold before you like a scene out of National Treasure (if National Treasure were a better film). This is, and will probably continue to be, an inspiriting factor in someone picking up a guitar for the first time and forming a band, or the key to unlocking metal for someone who previously had not been able to appreciate it. Its relevance and history just make it that kind of \u2018gateway\u2019 album, but it also carries with it honest musicianship and vision, the true ingredient to making it a timeless great.\n\nFirstly though, I want to talk about the album in the context of being a Black Sabbath release. This, to me, is the first cohesive CD they put out. It has all the various elements of the first album, but they have now been separated into their constituent parts; the heavy songs are heavy, the folky songs are folky, and the rocky songs are rocky, whereas on \u2018Black Sabbath\u2019 (and, although to a lesser extent, on \u2018Paranoid\u2019) the influences were a bit more disorganised, mixed in together on the same song which still sounded great, but it didn\u2019t allow a strong identity to form behind the band. \u2018Master of Reality\u2019, on the other hand, is the perfect mix of being diverse and experimental, but all the time feeling ultimately driven by an all-encompassing, distinctive new sound, a sound which is in my opinion the final stone in what they had begun building towards over the past two albums; the dawn of metal music.\n\nOn \u2018Master of Reality\u2019 we find some truly masterful performances by all band members. There are noticeably less solos that wander off aimlessly into the song, taking the direction of the music with them; instead, Iommi gives a much more focused performance on the guitar this time around, with solos still being worked into the music but being stylistically harnessed at the same time so that they don\u2019t feel out of control or scatty. And the riffs\u2026 fucking hell, the riffs on this album are brilliant, from the groovy grunt of \u2018Children of the Grave\u2019 to the sludge covered monster that is \u2018Sweet Leaf\u2019 to the intricate weaving of \u2018Orchid\u2019\u2026 its all great and its all different, and that\u2019s another reason why this album is so important in defining the band: the CD exhibits a hugely varied palate of riff styles, from doom, rock, folk, acoustic, psychedelic, to whatever, but they\u2019re all SABBATH riffs, unmistakable in their simplicity and delivery, which is what made them such an important band in bridging the gap between genres at the time.\n\nThe drumming has slowed down a bit, and there aren\u2019t so many jazzy interludes and off-beats thrown in here which again adds to the \u2018less busy, more efficient\u2019 feel this album has, but the most important consequence of this is that the power coming from behind the kit has increased tenfold, complementing the new, groovier style of writing the band have endorsed. The bass sound hasn\u2019t really changed since \u2018Black Sabbath\u2019, which is a good thing; its still nice and heavy, happy to accentuate the rhythm of the guitar before throwing in a few bluesy hooks into the mix for good measure. Finally, Ozzy. The vocal performance on this album is good. It isn\u2019t anything mind blowing or life changing, but then again if it was it would be separating the album down to its constituent parts, which are far less interesting as individual entities than they are as a collective whole. He is clearly a decent singer, but he made the right decision not to make a point of this and instead be content to ride the grooves that the rest of the band are laying out.\n\nBut I would like to refer back to \u2018Master of Reality\u2019 as being one of THE albums that have influenced metal over the years. The first time I listened to this album I was truly stunned at just how much of the music felt familiar to me. I lost count of how many times I found myself saying things like \u201cthat\u2019s Black Label Society\u2026 that\u2019s Church of Misery\u2026 that\u2019s Cathedral\u2026 that\u2019s Pantera\u2026 that\u2019s Reverend Bizarre\u2026\u201d but what really surprised me were the less obvious parallels that can be drawn between this CD and some pretty unexpected bands: there were moments of \u201c\u2026fucking hell, what is an Akercocke riff doing on here?\u201d and at one point (and I\u2019m not even too sure I believe myself on this) but I swear I could have made a genuine comparison between \u2018Master of Reality\u2019 and Rotten Sound. And yet, this doesn\u2019t just feel like a mere mix of modern day material condensed down into a fading blast from the past. There\u2019s something about this release that feels unique and fresh as it probably did back in the 70\u2019s.\n\nThis deserves all the labels of high appraisal that are thrown around all too carelessly sometimes; a landmark release, timeless, revolutionary, hugely influential. This is the one that did it first and arguably, this is the one that did it, and is still doing it, best. \u2018Master of Reality\u2019 deserves a place SOMEWHERE in your collection, because apart from the amazing songs on it, the blueprint for metal as we know it lies within its dark and gloomy walls, and it will undoubtedly inform you as to where most of the music you enjoy comes from.\n",
        "\nThe reuniting of Dio and Vinnie Appice into Black Sab-I mean the forming of Heaven & Hell has, of course, sparked interest in the Dio years of Sabbath. Completely understandable, since everyone in the mainstream was being told of this semi-reunion and was basically confused, because they always thought Ozzy was the only vocalist Black Sabbath ever had. I mean, after all, Dio certainly didn\u2019t sing Iron Man, War Pigs, or Paranoid, so where did that guy who did Rainbow in the Dark come in? In response to said confusion, not only did Sabbath release the Dio Years compilation, but they released this more comprehensive box set as well. Yeah, the single disc compilation is cheaper and has three new songs, but you\u2019re doing yourself a huge disservice by not owning the original full-length albums. \n\nSo buy this.\n\nI know there\u2019s a rather large group of metalheads who hate the word \u201cremaster\u201d attached to anything they deem \u201cclassic,\u201d but trust me, this is a case where the hatred is unjustified. These remasters, if anything, are superior to the originals in terms of clarity and dynamic power. This Heaven and Hell is not blasphemous, this Mob Rules did not listen to fools, and this Dehumanizer\u2019s reflection turned to steel right before its eyes with just as much viciousness as before. \n\nAnd that leaves Live Evil. If you weren\u2019t sold on the inclusion of those three demi-classics in one place, you need to hear the double live album. The original was a mixing/mastering disaster. No one doubts that, not even the band. Well, Dan Hersch, the man behind the remastering, should be deemed a metallic patron saint for his work here. It\u2019s difficult to turn lead into gold, and nigh impossible to turn raw shit into platinum, but Hersch makes a valiant effort. It\u2019s not just listenable, it actually sounds damn good. The drums are clear enough in the mix, Geezer doesn\u2019t dominate Tony, and Dio is neither uncomfortably close to screaming in your face nor huddling in a corner behind Vinnie. \n\nThat isn\u2019t to say Live Evil now sounds like Unleashed in the East or Made In Japan. There was obviously a LOT of knob-twiddling involved in this work, and so sound levels vary here and there to help separate the different voices from each other. There\u2019s also very little natural dynamic range in the guitar and bass parts, so they don\u2019t quite crush you as hard as they do on the studio albums. To a large degree, though, I don\u2019t think you can blame Dan for this: if the tapes came to him all smushed as the first release indicates, he didn\u2019t have much choice. Again, given the original mastering job, it\u2019s amazing he was able to do so much. \n\nAs for the quality of the albums in terms of the music\u2026 just go read the reviews. I\u2019m not going to write complete reviews for four whole albums in one sitting. I don\u2019t want to write that, and you don\u2019t want to read the wall of text. So instead, let\u2019s talk about what\u2019s specific about this box set, specifically the presentation.\n\nThe albums come in jewel cases inside a black cardboard box. It\u2019s high quality cardboard, though. It\u2019s very thick and tough, so don\u2019t worry too much about scratching or damaging it. The picture on this release\u2019s MA page does a good job of showing the design on the cover, but in real life only the text is in silver. The devil cross image is actually embossed in glossy black paint, providing for a black-on-black look. Pretty spiffy, and very much in the understated, elegant, and majestic line of aesthetics the band has carried. \n\nThe individual albums retain their original artwork, but the part of the jewel case that holds the disc in place is a smooth glossy black instead of the usual/original charcoal with vertical grooves. It\u2019s a nice little visual cue to differentiate the remastered cases from the originals. That said, the disc art has been completely redone. I had only owned Heaven and Hell before buying this, so I can\u2019t say anything about the others, but at least in that case\u2026 you\u2019re not missing anything. There wasn\u2019t any real design on the old discs, just the names and information generally required. The new ones\u2026 are similar, but with a nice little pattern around the outer edges, and they maintain that \u201cblack on black\u201d look. \n\nAgain, it\u2019s hard to speak of whether liner notes were retained or not, especially since Heaven and Hell originally did not come with any to speak of. However, these come with some rather interesting stories regarding each release. These include interview-esque quotes from the band members. It\u2019s nothing a die-hard fan of the band wouldn\u2019t already know, but again, when your target demographic is people who aren\u2019t familiar enough with the releases to own them, it\u2019s a very good touch. Certainly better than empty booklets, at any rate. Still, I\u2019d prefer to have some lyrics sheets included. \n\nI haven\u2019t been inside a mainstream record store lately, but at least at the time that I bought this box, Heaven and Hell and Mob Rules were the only Dio-era albums that were in print. Thus, this box set is at least worth it for easy-access versions of Live Evil and Dehumanizer (I\u2019m with the band on that one: hugely underrated). Hell, it\u2019s worth it just for the remastered Live Evil, since I haven\u2019t seen these remasters outside of the box set. And if you happen to not own Mob Rules, or god forbid, Heaven and Hell, well\u2026 you live a sad and meaningless life until you correct that. Seriously, what\u2019s wrong with you? You\u2019ve got nothing to say. No need to shop around, your forgiveness is right here.\n",
        "\nBlack Sabbath have faltered a bit throughout their career, but at those critical junctures where they made things work, they went all the way. Headless Cross is one of those especially inspired moments; in fact, it ranks among the best albums the band ever released, and for good reason. Iommi dropped the stoned, bludgeoning riffs of his past for epic heavy metal grandeur this time around, a move that perfectly fit with relative newcomer Tony Martin\u2019s majestic, soaring vocals. On the previous album, Martin was held back a bit as a result of pre-written vocal parts meant for Ray Gillen; on Headless Cross, however, he gained the opportunity to show off his prowess, and took his chance to the fullest extent.\n\nThe first encounter with darkness \u2013 the title track \u2013 immediately spellbinds the listener first with Cozy Powell\u2019s much-respected drum mastery, then with one of Iommi\u2019s most immortal riffs. The ensuing forty-minute musical masterpiece is further enhanced with one of Sabbath\u2019s eeriest atmospheres of all time. As for the lyrics, they\u2019re completely obsessed with evil and malevolence \u2013 the only time Sabbath have devoted this concept to an entire album. Yet even with such demonic lyricism and pitch-black atmosphere, the album does not come across as overtly Satanic. Rather, it feels epic on a scale on the same high pedestal as Heaven and Hell did. Of course, Headless Cross does contain its share of diabolic moments, such as the beginning chorus to \u201cCall of the Wild,\u201d not to mention the captivatingly dark effect of Tony Martin\u2019s singing.\n\nTony Iommi displays great versatility throughout the album; there are the gloomy, dominating riffs of old (\u201cHeadless Cross\u201d); soaring melodies reminiscent of the first Dio era (\u201cNightwing\u201d); lurking, shifty ones (\u201cCloak and Dagger\u201d); and even nostalgic blues tributes (\u201cBlack Moon\u201d). His solos tend to be grand and speedy more than anything else, even more than they were on Heaven and Hell. Tony Martin, however, is the real key to the success of this album. He is just as amazing as Dio \u2013 sometimes even better. The chorus of \u201cCall of the Wild\u201d perfectly shows this with its incredible bursts of \u201chero!\u201d in between the longer phrases, as does the chorus to the title track. But the best moment of all is his final line of the album \u2013 that awe-inspiring falsetto wail:\n\n\u201cNIGHTWING FLIIIIIIIIIIIES AGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIN!\u201d\n\nThere is just about no complaint that can be levied on this album. Its atmosphere, its musicians, and its cover are all incredible; rarely has Sabbath reached such a spectacular achievement. Tony Martin and Iommi have both professed their pride in Headless Cross, and it\u2019s easy to see why.\n\n\u201cListen for the feet as they pound the land to the tune of thunder\u2026\u201d\n",
        "\nOriginally intended to be fronted by the late Badlands vocalist Ray Gillen, this 1987 album is typically seen as being Sabbath's lowest point in terms of commercial success and reputation. It was the first album to feature underdog vocalist Tony Martin, the last to feature current KISS drummer Eric Singer, and the only album to feature Ozzy Osbourne bassist Bob Daisley in the group ranks. It also marked a new direction in the reborn band's sound while still retaining a few older elements.\n\nMusically, this album combines a mix of Sabbath's signature doom metal style with a newly discovered power metal influence that makes for an interesting listen. Songs like \"The Shining\" and \"Ancient Warrior\" combine upbeat riffs with a dark atmosphere, \"Glory Ride\" brings to mind Iron Maiden with its more uplifting tempos and dogfighting imagery, and the title track hearkens back to Black Sabbath's self-titled anthem with its intensely sinister guitar lines and foreboding build-up. There is also a great deal of blues influence heard for the first time in the band since the days of \"Volume 4\" that is used to great effect on tracks such as \"Hard Life to Love,\" \"Born to Lose,\" and \"Lost Forever.\"\n\nEven with the member confusion and slightly faceless rhythm section that surround this album, the band itself still manages to put on a solid performance. Iommi is in his element as always and churns out plenty of great riffs and keyboardist Geoff Nicholls occasionally jumps in with some interesting atmospheric touches. In spite of Martin's obvious emulation of Gillen's Robert Plant-inspired wails, he manages to pull off a great vocal performance though it is fairly obvious that the material isn't always in his natural range...\n\nWhile this is a very good album overall, it doesn't have too many songs that could be considered classics and often gets overlooked in favor of such albums as the more focused \"Headless Cross\" and \"Tyr.\" It's certainly worth hunting down for fans of the band and it makes me wonder how the recordings would compare if they had kept GIllen's original vocal tracks...\n\nPros:\n1) An interesting new direction in terms of style\n2) Great riffs, vocals, and keyboards\n3) Solid songwriting\n\nCons:\n1) Faceless rhythm section\n2) Not too many \"classic\" songs\n3) It is fairly obvious that Martin is outside of his natural range\n\nMy Current Favorites:\n\"The Shining,\" \"Hard Life to Love,\" \"Glory Ride,\" \"Born to Lose,\" and \"Eternal Idol\"\n",
        "\nFirst of all, it would be right to say that I\u2019m no big fan of Black Sabbath. Of course I realize the major affect they had on heavy metal, since they were the pioneers of our favorite music. I like most of their work, that is, after the Heaven and Hell album without Ozzy on the vocals.\n\nHeadless Cross came out in 1989 and it was the second album with Tony Martin on the vocals. The previous one, Eternal Idol, was quite nice and their fans\u2019 expectations of something great had grown bigger. Indeed, Headless Cross is a great release without moments that let you down. It creates a dark atmosphere and it\u2019s filled with beautiful keyboard themes by Geoff Nichols.\n\nThere are seven songs in here, apart from a small intro named The Gates of Hell. It is nothing much but it prepares the ground for the self-titled song which really is a killer! It is a six-minute epic and, if not the best, one of the Top-5 songs that Sabbath have ever written, flooded with a unique epic feeling. It begins with a pounding beat by the drums of Cozy Powell, a very well known name among the metal musicians. But after a few seconds comes the thunder, caused by the ultra-heavy riffs of the man who must have been born with a guitar in his hands, Mr. Tony Iommi. And just listen to the solo, the man is unbelievable!\n\nTwo other songs that make this album so magnificent are Devil And daughter and When Death calls. The first one is the only single of the album, which means that it is the most commercial moment of it. Don\u2019t consider it though as something cheesy but as pure heavy metal. It flows smoothly with no surprises. Martin\u2019s vocals are in the front line and he proves that he deserves to be Sabbath\u2019s singer. \n\nAs for When Death Calls, it is another epic that begins with an acoustic theme and gradually turns into a heavy, totally metal masterpiece. The atmosphere reminds that of Mob Rules, while Powell with his virtuoso drum playing and unique breaks, contributes at the most to the creation of this metal monster. And with a magnificent change at 5\u201940\u201d, Sabbath finish us off as the song fades out. Excellent, brilliant, you name it\u2026I love it.\n\nBut there are other songs in the album that are also quite good. Kill in the Spirit World is of medium speed and it slows down even more at the refrain, but it has some really mystical lyrics. It is not a dynamite; however you\u2019ll listen to its five minutes very pleasantly. Call of the Wild follows up and it sounds pretty much like the previous one, though maybe a bit faster and with more tension in its riffs. Nice ones, both of them. Nightwing, which is the last song of Headless Cross, creates a creepy and mysterious atmosphere that, combined with its mystical lyrics about a night hunter, makes you feel he has silently crept behind your back, ready to take your soul to hell! And once again Iommi has the last word playing another wonderful solo towards the end. It is the most suitable finale for a very, very good album.\n\nBlack Moon is probably the only flaw in the album. It is not bad, sharp guitars, powerful drums and beautiful keyboards. I don\u2019t know why but this song sounds very strange to me. Maybe I\u2019m wrong but its rhythm doesn\u2019t echo well in my ears. I don\u2019t want to misjudge Sabbath for writing this one, because I\u2019m not quite sure whether I like it or not. I\u2019ll leave the decision to you.\n\nI think that Headless Cross is the best thing Sabbath have done since Heaven and Hell. They have a great singer and when Iommi is in good shape, everything is doomed to turn out well. I like this album very much and every time I listen to it, I feel compelled to push the PLAY button when it ends. Black Sabbath, once more, thank you very much for everything you have offered to our music.\n",
        "\nI like a lot Black Sabbath's 1970s oldies, riffs are great, sound is heavy and atmosphere dark... But in my opinion there is one problem on those recordings - a big one. It's named Ozzy \"The Sheep\" Osbourne, who's vocals could be described as a mix of bleating and drunken yelling. Well, this problem was fixed when Osbourne departed and Dio came in... And Heaven and Hell was good album, so was Mob Rules (and of course, Heaven & Hell band is also great...). Then Dio gone away. Who could be capable to be the new vocalist of Black Sabbath? Answer was Deep Purple's former (and also forthcoming) vocalist Ian Gillan. Gillan did great job on classic Purple albums, and he does great job on this album as well - and by the way, he did a good job on the other Black Sabbath tracks also as several bootlegs from this era prove.\n\nAlbum starts with speed metal piece called \"Trashed\". It really has energy and power with great guitar solos, and some really heavy riffing. High pitched vocals by Ian Gillan are something new for Black Sabbath and work very well. Moody keyboard intro track \"Stonehenge\" leads us to insane \"Disturbing the Priest\", which starts with Ian Gillan's trademark yelling, mixed with (nowadays almost clicheic) laughing that reminds me of the end of Deep Purple's \"Speed King\". \"Disturbing the Priest\" also has kind of evil which fit very well to the scary downtempo atmosphere and 'horror' sound effects of the track.\n\nBut as it turns out, whole \"Disturbing the Priest\" is actually just a introduction to colossal \"Zero the Hero\". Though \"Zero the Hero\" starts with another keyboard intro named \"The Dark\" this song really shouldn't be titled as own track in my opinion - it's just short piece of keyboard effects... It works anyway, and as the actual song starts it presents us both good lyrics about the easy-life idler who just sits and watches as the life goes on and on - and finally figures out he had not own life at all! The well done lyrics are sung greatly and bit aggressively by Ian Gillan with a way which some way sounds a bit like rapping and makes the track, especially it's chorus, extremely catchy. But \"Zero the Hero\" is not only catchy hit song, but also has deeper dimensions in it's doomy and gloomy mass and even some progression in it's structure: you can hear how the track slowly grows to it's massive ending through the long, atmospheric solos and guitar effects of Tony Iommi.\n\nSo, this was the A-side of the album, that is really good. Then we have there a B-side, that is something else. While it starts with rocking, humorous and quite good \"Digital Bitch\", the messy and overlong yet beautiful title track leads us to two last tracks - which are completely fillers. This may be reason why many feel that this is a bad album - together with the production.\n\nWell, I like the production. It is a bit muddy, but that makes the overall feeling of the album darker and heavier. This is heavy and has evil atmosphere. But I can't understand people who says that the production is terrible. Maybe that's because I've listened a lot of old-school black metal which definitely has not too good production, but I actually like the overall sound of this album a lot. But the two things that really make this album worth listening are Ian Gillan's excellent vocals and Tony Iommi's great guitar riffing and even better solos. Of course also Geezer Butler's heavy bass and Bill Ward's strong drumming find their place on the big picture.\n\nAnd, I even like the cover. It's scary, strange, and symbolic image of the Antichrist's - all that what we think as 'evil', 'wrong' and so on - birth to this world. Much like this album is with it's crushing overall sound and two doom metal monoliths of the A-side. If you can forget the production, which can be problem for some, and two or three fillers, you get a very well done album.\n",
        "\nAh, the crazy 70s! This decade and the one preceding it gave the world of Rock n\u2019 Roll, a bed partner. I am talking about the thing which pretty much became synonymous with rock in this period. No! Not long hair, not sex (that\u2019s for the 80s) but an activity known as drug use. The Beatles did it, Morrison did it and Black Sabbath went as far to write a love song for it. Sweet Leaf is one of those classics whose lyrical content overshadows the actual music. There had been songs about drug effects earlier but never before was such a thing written. A song describing a person\u2019s infatuation with the sweet leaf, marijuana, was really something new.\n\n\nThe strength of this song like pretty much all 70s Sabbath songs is Iommi\u2019s guitarwork. The main riff is a perfect example of a Sabbath riff \u2013 majestic yet simple. Both Ward and Geezer are in top form but the person who truly amazed me with his performance on this track is Ozzy. Evidently, the sweet leaf he is praising so lovingly had not affected his vocals, at least not on this album. His voice is full of emotion and I can safely say that no other vocalist can perform this particular song better than Ozzy had. He sounds like an addict himself, right on the verge of madness. It\u2019s sad to see how he has become a self parody now.\n\nBut for all this brilliance this song has a flaw and a major one at that; the song isn\u2019t high on the replayability factor. It is fun but it loses that novelty fast enough. You\u2019ll love it to bits the first time you hear it but after 7-8 plays you may stop bothering with it, although for a few days only. It\u2019s a shame actually because if this review would have been written a few days after I had heard it for the first time, the rating would have been considerably higher.\n\nThe lyrics of this song are a glaring instance of the band\u2019s infatuation with drugs. It is actually very sad because it was the excessive drug abuse that almost killed Sabbath by the end of 70s. It is a known fact that it was his drug abuse problem that eventually got Ozzy kicked out of Black Sabbath. If that wasn\u2019t enough, this problem is sometimes attributed to killing Ozzy\u2019s vocal abilities as well. I strongly believe that though this track is great, you\u2019ll be better off ignoring the lyrical message.\n\n\nThe B-side to this single is another Sabbath classic; Lord of this World. The track is not so much of a fan favorite but I personally think that this is one of the best off \u2018Master of Reality\u2019 and would have been good enough for a single release itself. All four members of the band shine on this track as well. I may be wrong, but the lyrics on this one seem to be in praise of god. It is surprising that this track isn\u2019t mentioned as often among Sabbath fans because unlike the previous track this song stays fresh even after a lot of plays. All in all, the two good songs on this single are an important part of metal\u2019s history and everyone should be well-acquainted with them.\n",
        "\nAfter the less than favorable reception given to the Black Sabbath line-up fronted by the underrated Tony Martin, guitarist/bandleader Tony Iommi decided to bring back a few figures from his more prominent past and resurrect the line-up led by vocalist Ronnie James Dio on 1981\u2019s \"Mob Rules.\" The resulting album remains one of Sabbath\u2019s most punishing and overlooked efforts to date.\n\nDespite possessing the same line-up, this album\u2019s music has very little in common with the material found on the first two installments of the Dio era. Songs such as \"After All (The Dead)\" and \"Letters from Earth\" provide powerful doom metal dirges while songs like \"TV Crimes\" and \"Time Machine\" show off faster riffs and energetic vocals and a ballad track manifests by means of the depressing \"Too Late.\" Of course, there are also tracks like \"Computer God\" and \"Master of Insanity\" that feature elements of all three styles. The band\u2019s chemistry is also worth noting with Dio in particular delivering one of his angriest vocal performances to date.\n\nJust as Dio\u2019s solo band had done a few years prior to the reunion, the album\u2019s lyrics have also changed to meet the more morose tendencies of the music. While previous albums showed the singer being pre-occupied with the fantasy metaphors that have given him both fans and detractors, this album seems to completely throw them out the window in favor of more realistic themes. Nearly every song is packed with pessimistic themes relating to misuse of technology (\"Computer God\"), questions of the afterlife (\"After All (The Dead)\"), televangelists (\"TV Crimes\"), social commentary (\"Letters from Earth,\" \"Master of Insanity\"), and a few personal musings in between. The song \"I\" provides the album\u2019s only glimmer of hope with messages of individualism and self-empowerment. Of course, it also provides some of the silliest lines that Dio has ever come up with (\u201cI\u2019m a virgin/I\u2019m a whore\u201d)...\n\nFor the most part, the album\u2019s flaws are relatively few and far between. Listeners that are expecting to hear \"Heaven and Hell\" part 2 will certainly be in for a shock when they hear the slower songs and equally crushing lyrics. Other than that, it\u2019s a pretty safe to purchase to make.\n\nAll in all, it's a very underrated effort and perhaps the best Sabbath album since 1983\u2019s \"Born Again\" (Yes, I'm one of those weird people that loves that album).\n\nPros:\n1) Excellent band performance with crushing riffs and angry vocals\n2) Intelligent lyrics with even darker themes\n3) Great songwriting and song structures\n\nCons:\n1) May be a little too slow for more mainstream Sabbath listeners\n\nMy Current Favorites:\n\"Computer God,\" \"After All (the Dead),\" \"TV Crimes,\" \"Letters from Earth,\" and \"Master of Insanity\"\n",
        "\nEvery once in a while, though quite rarely, an album comes about that strikes your attention so firmly and gracefully that, in one way or another, you can't live without it. Greatness profound, with an endless amount of enjoyment that grows exponentially with each listen. For me, one such record is this masterpiece.\n\nThroughout their existence, I've never heard BLACK SABBATH sounds as sincere with their compositions and performance than here on \"Headless Cross\". Even their earlier days with Ozzy, while competant and obviously the stepping stone of all things heavy metal, left a bit to be desired in terms of the amount of heart within the overall performance. Not so on this...\n\nThis would have to be the darkest and most ambitious material the SABBATH camp has ever put out, and nothing before or after will match, in my opinion. The entire performance, from every member, is pitch perfect and unleashes deluges of darkness and wicked impureness the likes of which the fans haven't experienced. Obviously the music revolves around Tony Iommi's mastery of the metal riff, and on this his work is second to none, with the slower, dirgey moments couple with some serious head-banging moments that beg for your attention. And the line-up he's composed for this is something to be quite envious of, especially the talents of crooner Tony Martin, keyboardist Geoff Nicholls and late skinsman Cozy Powell, whole all compile into musicall hell that grips you tightly and refuses to let you go. And while the argument could be made that SABBATH doesn't/didn't need keyboards, I'd have to disagree as the keys are used very tastefully and help darken the music even more, giving it a more theatrical and mysterious feel. There are no songs on here to be considered filler; every tracks is intense and fits the scheme of things perfectly, but the best standouts would have to be the title track, the brilliant \"When Death Calls\", \"Call of the Wild\" and \"Nightwing\", showcasing that SABBATH can be different in their musical wanderings while still holding true to their acid-rock roots. Martin's vocals and lyrics are also at their best, something he really has yet to top; his falsettos strangely working wonders with some of SABBATH's most Satanic and occult-based lyrics, and provides vocal lines that are epic and match the rest of the music quite well.\n\nSo in the end, this is one of the best albums I've ever heard. And every time I hear it it gets better and better. VERY recommended for anything interested in the \"forgotten\" era of BLACK SABBATH's history, as during the Tony Martin years this is the best to offer. Thumbs way the fuck up!\n",
        "\n\u201cVol. 4\u201d was something of a step backward for \u201cBlack Sabbath\u201d in terms of their creativity in many respects. The heavy and very much forward looking \u201cMaster Of Reality\u201d opened a lot of additional possibilities up to the band, but they seemed to have shied away from it a bit based on the two songs found on here. \u201cChanges\u201d is essentially just under 5 minutes of fluff with nasally vocals and really sappy lyrics. Piano alone ballads with occasional string sections in the background are an extremely exposed situation for a vocalist, and Ozzy is not really up to the task, particularly because he\u2019s also pushing the limits of his range and essentially shouting out the chorus. If the goal of this was to show a sensitive side to the band that would appeal to a different audience, the result just falls flat.\n\nThe b-side found on here, which interestingly enough is misspelled as \u201cSupernaugt\u201d, establishing this otherwise lackluster vinyl release as a collector\u2019s item/oddity, is a fairly straightforward, mid tempo rock song with a couple of solid riffs. Although not particularly exciting when compared to several other songs that can be heard on \u201cVol. 4\u201d, it\u2019s influence on more recent music is pretty easy to spot. The one shorter riff with all of the sloppy sounding fret slides is not all that far off from a Nirvana song called \u201cNegative Creep\u201d, which came off of an album that had some primitive though definitely obvious Sabbath themes at work in it. The overloud open high-hat symbol and frequent crash cymbal hits, which obscure the riffs to a degree, were probably where bands like \u201cSleep\u201d and \u201cThe Sword\u201d got the idea for riding the crash cymbal as if it were the ride or high-hat, thus creating that really sloppy sound that many outside of the core-stoner doom crowd can\u2019t stomach.\n\nIn spite of this not being a very entertaining listen, it and the other more interesting songs that came off of \u201cVol. 4\u201d are probably among the most influential ones to many mainstream metal and non-metal bands. It\u2019s easy going, tried and true, relatively safe format makes it appealing to a lot of bands that don\u2019t like taking risks, who appeal to the majority of listeners today who also aren\u2019t big on risk taking. Nonetheless, the album that these two came off of is essential listening, though personally my least favorite among the first 6 Sabbath offerings.\n",
        "\nAlthough there is a broad consensus in the metal world that anthems dedicated to the dark side of the universe involves dissonant and unpleasant approaches to songwriting. Suppose that there are actual entities that make up the dark side of life in some parallel universe. Would they celebrate their nature with songs depicting themselves as cruel, hideous beasts? Or would they perhaps see themselves in a different light? Well, according to Ronnie Dio and the rest of Black Sabbath, this is not necessarily the case, or at least that is what the title song of this single seems to imply.\n\n\u201cTurn Up The Night\u201d may come across as stylistically ironic, having a very cheerful sounding melody being sun in a fairly joyous manner by the 2nd leader of the Sabbath army, yet also having a dark toned guitar and bass heavy sound underneath it. But if you look at it as being demons looking at themselves and critiquing their own nature, this song would suggest that these dark minions see themselves as being the light. And being their own self-proclaimed light wielders, they would no doubt use elaborate guitar solos for their rock anthems, perhaps drenched in rapid back and forth pentatonic licks with a ton of wah pedal noise filtering it through.\n\nAfter the celebration ends, what ensues is a hold over from the previous album in \u201cLonely Is The World\u201d, which reaches back a little bit into Sabbath\u2019s jam-rock oriented era in the early 70s. There are essentially two riffs driving this along, one of them essentially a bluesy drone consisting of two chords/notes. There are two various solo sections, both of them drawn out and heavily improvisatory in nature. Tony Iommi said himself that at the time it was his favorite song for soloing over, probably because it gave him a chance to pull the microphone away from Ronnie for a few minutes.\n\nThis is probably the least purchase worthy in a series of essentially obsolete singles, but it is an interesting piece of history to occasionally chew on. The rabid completist and otherwise legally insane Sabbath fanatics who want to own it all and be buried with it underneath a headstone with a statue of Tony Iommi on it can go to the pawnshops hunting for this. The rest of you normal folks can break out your copies of \u201cHeaven And Hell\u201d and \u201cMob Rules\u201d and listen to them all the way through, or maybe rip them, create a play list of these two songs, and imagine that they\u2019re playing on a record player.\n",
        "\nRiding high off the success of \u201cHeaven And Hell\u201d and taking the loss of longtime drummer Bill Ward somewhat in stride, Black Sabbath elected to promote their second album with a no nonsense approach to heavy metal. That is essentially what \u201cMob Rules\u201d the song is, no nonsense heavy metal, blaring out a singular pounding riff that has come to influence a lot of bands, from Dio\u2019s own solo project in the case of \u201cRainbow In The Dark\u201d, to more recent successful though very different bands like Rage Against The Machine. It\u2019s essentially 3 riffs, one of which behaves as both the chorus, but in typical Sabbath form these 3 riffs are more than enough to lay the ground work for one hard hitting, memorable fit of brilliance.\n\nThe b-side that comes with this, an extra rare live version of the first single from the previous album \u201cDie Young\u201d takes the same approach as the a-side here. There\u2019s no extended intro with a woeful guitar lead with keyboards everywhere, just a straight shot into the main riff and a mostly fast song, featuring a riff that\u2019s a somewhat modified version of \u201cSnowblind\u201d played at a much lighter, faster tempo, with a less down tuned guitar tone and a much more driving rhythm section behind it. Ronnie\u2019s vocal performance is a bit more gravely and rough than normal, and sometimes he goes a little bit overboard and loses the pitch center, but it all works in the spirit of aggressive music, which this band helped pioneer.\n\nThere are copies of this in vinyl still floating around on either eBay or a few other websites, probably not very cheap or easy to come by, but if you are a fanatical follower of the band who has to own every live version of classic Dio era Sabbath that you can get your hands on, then you are welcome to try. But for those normal people out there who think that the 2 studio albums and \u201cLive Evil\u201d are sufficient from this time period, you\u2019re not missing a whole lot by not owning this. It\u2019s fodder for completists and people who are stuck on a now mostly obsolete medium of music listening.\n",
        "\nFollow suit from the precedent the band set for themselves writing the very fast though a bit more epic \u201cDie Young\u201d, Black Sabbath came to the end of their composing process to ponder adding another song to round things out at 8 for the album. \u201cNeon Knights\u201d draws a bit less from the cynical aspects of Ronnie\u2019s lyrical pursuits and a bit more on the escapist, fantasy based sagas of heroes and quests that he became heavily known for in the mid 1980s. It\u2019s markedly happier and more triumphant sounding than most of the songs that ended up on \u201cHeaven And Hell\u201d, save perhaps \u201cWishing Well\u201d, and drives things along quite nicely for it\u2019s full duration, trading up a series of rock inspired riffs that lay the perfect groundwork for Dio\u2019s lyrical storytelling and an impressive couple of guitar solos out of Iommi, while the rest of the band basically play support.\n\nThe live version of \u201cChildren Of The Sea\u201d that accompanies this single is the best version that has ever been done, either by Dio on occasions with his own project, or by any other incarnation of Sabbath with either Dio or one of the other singers that ended up performing it. It shows the band sticking a lot closer to the original format of the song, though Ronnie does do a fair share of ad lib parts in between verses. His vocal interpretation is a good bit more gravely than the one he has on the studio version, but he carries the tune flawlessly in spite of it. In fact, no one on here misses a note, as even Iommi\u2019s solo is actually note for note in line with the studio version, something that rarely happens in a live performance with him.\n\nFor 1980 this was definitely pushing the envelope in terms of aggression and heaviness. It wasn\u2019t necessarily the fastest thing to come out at that time, particularly when you account from Dio\u2019s own work 2 years prior with Rainbow on \u201cKill The King\u201d and a few select faster songs that Sabbath did with Ozzy, but it definitely had a spirit to it that was looking forward to things like power metal and later, speed/thrash. This is worth seeking out solely for the b-side and the trippy cover art, but finding it at a reasonable price is all but impossible, but if someone has the dedication, it\u2019s definitely a catch worth fishing for.\n",
        "\nThis single, this song, was basically the first breath of a resurrected dragon that had been thought slain by the arrow of a lost front man. And like the first breath of any living being that has been resuscitated from the brink of death, it is a violent one that quickly rushes oxygen to all the extremities of its body just before the pulling itself up from the ground. \u201cDie Young\u201d is somewhat ironically titled when considering all of this, as the song was the first step in a rebuilding of the Sabbath name that occurred quite quickly, spawning the legendary \u201cHeaven And Hell\u201d album and setting a whole new era of Sabbath into motion without the need of the prince of darkness following along with the riff.\n\nThis song essentially begins serenely, in somewhat of a similar fashion to that of \u201cShe\u2019s Gone\u201d off of \u201cTechnical Ecstasy\u201d, but with a heavily synthesized sound rather than a natural string orchestra. Then a lone guitar comes alone with a weeping melodic lead line that would later be repackaged on Iommi\u2019s 1986 flirtation with the mainstream \u201cNo Stranger To Love\u201d. But then things kick into high gear as one of the fastest and most aggressive songs ever to be heard at that point in history pours in with the drums driving, the bass wandering, and the guitar crunching out power chords like crazy. In the midst of it all is the voice of Ronnie Dio, like a tragic hero in a Wagnerian opera, shouting almost as much as he is singing, and filling the entire arrangement with a combination of woe and splendor. Iommi showcases his newly found sense of virtuosity here as well as he flies through lead break after lead break, loaded with rapid paced licks and pentatonic runs that are double the intensity of his most adventurous leads in the 1970s. It\u2019s all there, then it goes away for a brief moment of serenity for launching back into a triumphant conclusion.\n\nAccompanying this is an early live version of the future album\u2019s title track, \u201cHeaven And Hell\u201d, performed in its entirety, changed up a bit vocally by Ronnie to give it a more unique character, and spending a bit of time encouraging audience participation, but otherwise a near perfect rendition of the full studio version. It stands in stark contrast to the abridged version that would often get thrown into medleys with either other Sabbath songs or later with Dio\u2019s solo offerings when he performed the song on tour. The only flaw in the performance is that Bill Ward has ceased to be a really active force in the arrangement, opting just to stick mostly to standard rolls for fills and otherwise keep the beat. This newer style that the band adopted definitely required a much stricter rhythm section backdrop, but it seems as if Ward is being a bit stiff even within that more limited approach to drumming.\n\nThis is a consequential slice of Sabbath history, that is, if you can find it. Nearly 30 years of time passing has been the death of many a great single or otherwise non-studio album, and this is now a bit hard to come by. There are still copies of it floating around on eBay in vinyl form, but baring some sort of release of a collection of rare performances from the Dio era of the band, this is probably not going to be easily found. It\u2019s the prelude of an amazing album, but only an obligatory purchase for the most rabid of Sabbath/Dio enthusiasts.\n",
        "\nThis is the most well known and well renowned song of the \u201cForbidden\u201d album, owing in part to a really trippy cartoon music video, but mostly because it is among the most formulaic and derivative of the band\u2019s past. The principle riff is very similar to the one that appeared on \u201cZero The Hero\u201d, a riff which also influenced the famous G&R song \u201cParadise City\u201d. It\u2019s one of those deep sounding chromatic lines that has a little bit of a doom sound, but is played at a tempo and to an arrangement that goes a bit more in a rock/heavy metal direction. It gets a good deal faster than most of the stuff done on \u201cBorn Again\u201d, even getting fast enough to outpace \u201cTrashed\u201d during the ending section. Basically it\u2019s a familiar song, despite the fact that it takes its familiarity from more than one place in Sabbath\u2019s history.\n\nThe one area where this song and the whole \u201cForbidden\u201d album differs with every other one put out with Tony Martin at the helm is the rawness and dryness of the arrangement. Although in many ways this limit\u2019s the band\u2019s possibilities, particularly in the vocal department as all of the vocal harmonies that made their previous albums so epic sounding, they carry it fairly well and serve up a decent offering of metal with a bit of rock on the site. The only downside to it is that the production has made Cozy Powell\u2019s kit sound flat and have a bit of a popping character to it, particularly the snare sound, which masks an otherwise solid performance out of him as well.\n\nOpinions vary on whether or not \u201cForbidden\u201d is a worthwhile album, but I personally think so, and this song is one of the many positive elements to be found on it. There are naturally other songs that are better and flirt a bit with an epic sound within the context of a stripped down approach such as \u201cI Won\u2019t Cry For You\u201d, \u201cKiss Of Death\u201d and the title song. Don\u2019t expect anything up to the caliber of \u201cHeadless Cross\u201d or \u201cTyr\u201d, but definitely expect something that is worthy of the Sabbath name.\n",
        "\nThere comes a time when you find yourself in a situation where no matter what you do someone is going to be complaining loudly about the choice you make, so why not just do the most outlandish thing possible and turn a few heads in the process. That\u2019s not only how \u201cBorn Again\u201d and the resulting alter ego of Black Sabbath dubbed \u201cDeep Sabbath\u201d can be summed up, but particularly how this riot of a song can be summed up. Putting Ian Gillian at the helm was sure to turn a few heads given that Sabbath and Deep Purple were in a rivalry during the early 70s and that the latter had little if anything to do with the former image wise or musically.\n\n\u201cTrashed\u201d is definitely an odd cookie, even when accounting for all the various evolutionary jumps that Iommi took later on under the Sabbath name. It essentially merges the heavy down tuned guitar tone heard on \u201cMaster Of Reality\u201d with the up tempo and happy feel of \u201cTurn Up The Night\u201d, and throws in good old Gillian with his vocal gymnastics and almost completely out of place lyrics about drinking oneself into an utter state of stupor. But the highly original outcome that occurs has a charm all its own, and is definitely a grower once time is given for the shock at Gillian and Sabbath on the same album together wears off.\n\nThe b-side to this very unusual endeavor \u201cZero The Hero\u201d gets even stranger still, as the style of song has shifted completely away from anything remotely similar to Deep Purple, and Gillian is taking on a somewhat more serious role as lyricist. The main riff that drives the verses of this song was borrowed by Guns N\u2019 Roses for their hit song \u201cParadise City\u201d and given a very different spin. For those familiar with said song, down tune that riff, give it the most evil distortion you can muster without going completely into sludge territory, and put some creepy dissonant drones with a heavily reverb powered clean guitar track and you\u2019ll begin to get the idea of where this song is coming from. It\u2019s basically the heaviest song ever put out by the band after Ozzy left, and the second creepiest behind \u201cDisturbing The Priest\u201d.\n\nThe final truth and ultimate charm about the combination that is humorously dubbed Deep Sabbath and their lone studio offering \u201cBorn Again\u201d is that it has absolutely no accounting for nuance of subtlety. It\u2019s an album that takes every aspect of Sabbath to its ultimate extreme musically, and contains songs that rival such Ozzy era classics as \u201cBlack Sabbath\u201d, \u201cSymptom Of The Universe\u201d, \u201cChildren Of The Grave\u201d and all of the other dark and heavy efforts that scared the pants off of everyone in the 70s. Given that the envelope was being pushed further in the 80s by bands such as Venom, the fact that there were songs on this that still could creep people out says something about this band, with or without Ozzy.\n",
        "\nMetal has been known for elevating the act of parodying televangelism through the medium of music to an absolute art form. With such songs as Anthrax\u2019s \u201cMaking me Laugh\u201d, Metallic\u2019s \u201cLeper Messiah\u201d, Ozzy\u2019s \u201cMiracle Man\u201d and a host of others, it seems that the likes of Pat Robertson have nowhere to hide from the biting teeth of metallic satire. But then Ronnie James Dio came along with his trusty pen and paper in hand and along with the rest of the \u201cMob Rules\u201d lineup of Black Sabbath, put together the most ingenious swipe at every money-grubbing, plastic Jesus selling fraud to ever plaster his face all over the small screens of America.\n\n\u201cTV Crimes\u201d is slightly more interesting for its witty lyrics, but one should not discount the wickedly heavy riffs that litter this up tempo masterpiece. With that really dark intro riff that just pummels like a ton of forlorn metal, followed by what sounds like a deeper and bass happy version of the mid-tempo thrash metal that was popular with bands such as Anthrax and Metallica just a couple years prior to this. The solo sees the band reverting back to their melodic metal roots as heard on \u201cHeaven And Hell\u201d, but otherwise this is just an all out chromatic riff assault that just happens to be conducive to Ronnie\u2019s catchy melodic hooks.\n\nNaturally Sabbath can\u2019t live completely in the realm of witty and humorous polemics, so we come to the equally auspicious b-side of this little demo \u201cLetters From Earth\u201d, which strikes a much more serious tone. With its punishing slow tempo and woeful melody lines, this thing just lays on the doom with the same gloomy ferocity that the title song from \u201cThe Eternal Idol\u201d did, but with a slightly sludge-like underpinning to it. It picks up a tiny bit in the middle, going from gravely slow to moderately slow, sort of going back and forth between sounding like something from the early Tony Martin era and something that Candlemass might have put together circa 1987.\n\nWith all of the nimble Jacks out there now on the run unable to continue duping people with their quick lips thanks to the 4 prophets of true doom here, the essential nature of \u201cDehumanizer\u201d becomes instantly obvious. If you haven\u2019t heard the whole album, it is more essential that you check that out rather than spend your time looking for this long lost single, which is a mere 2 chapters out of a much longer book. But regardless on what release you hear this song, the one liners and biting humor contained in here never gets old.\n",
        "\nIn the closing years of the 1990s Black Sabbath were the beneficiaries of one of the most gargantuan tides of hype ever observed in the history of rock music. Everywhere fans seemed to be hungering for some sort of triumphant return to the glory days of the 1970s, where the oldest of metal heads and a good number of non-metal heads agree is where the true magic of heavy metal existed. My own problems with this implication aside, this was a golden opportunity for the band to come together and put together a brilliant new studio album with the Ozzman at the helm, a man who in spite of putting out a crapshoot known to many as \u201cOzzmosis\u201d, seemed to still have his pipes in fairly good working order.\n\nAlas, it was just not to be, as is proven by the musical content of this documentary. As a whole, this is a very good an educational DVD that answers many of the questions that the younger generation of this band\u2019s following had about what went on when all of these classic songs were conceived. But sadly due to Ozzy\u2019s self-destructive behavior and a completely by the numbers performance out of the band, masked only by the elaborate stage set up, what comes across musically is a band that appears to be washed up and out of ideas. Obviously for anyone who has heard Iommi\u2019s solo album \u201cFused\u201d and the latest offering of this band under the Heaven And Hell name \u201cThe Devil You know\u201d, this wasn\u2019t the case, but Ozzy\u2019s extreme lack of stage presence and mostly flat vocal performance just ruins things.\n\nThe band was smart enough to avoid the really botched performances from the \u201cReunion\u201d performance such as \u201cSabbath Bloody Sabbath\u201d where they have to omit the entire closing section and alter the principle verse melody due to Ozzy having almost no high range left and \u201cSpiral Architect\u201d where Ozzy hits all the notes but just sounds utterly lifeless. But even when the band has their best foot forward on songs such as \u201cWar Pigs\u201d, \u201cFairies Wear Boots\u201d and \u201cParanoid\u201d, it just doesn\u2019t live up to the hype and sees Ozzy sounding slightly under pitch and completely underwhelming. Other songs such as \u201cSnowblind\u201d and \u201cSweet Leaf\u201d see Ozzy failing to hit even moderately high notes, though the rest of the band shows a little bit of life on these songs and compensate a little bit for a shot singer leading the fray.\n\nIt\u2019s actually a welcome occurrence when the interview period of the band interrupts each of these songs, as they offer a much more interesting form of content than the butchering of more than a dozen classic songs. Geezer\u2019s reminiscence of the bible bumping bone heads that panned their music without really understanding it, Iommi remembering a journalist who hated the band reviewing a show that they ended up canceling and printing the negative content for a concert that never happened, and Bill Ward elucidating the true origin of the song title \u201cN.I.B.\u201d are all key moments where a great blend of humor and seriousness articulates an autobiography of sorts for the band that millions have come to associate with the birth of metal. Even Ozzy, though stuttering profusely, has a few interesting things to say on the various encounters the band had in their early years.\n\nAlthough this reunion didn\u2019t amount to much more than a 10 year death and burial of Black Sabbath, this DVD is something of a silver lining in an otherwise sad end to a legendary band. It has some interesting details about the goings on of the band from a period that has been obscured by decades of time passing by and buried under the continuing hype of Ozzy\u2019s various solo endeavors and personal antics, as well as several other eras of the Black Sabbath beast with new masters at the helm. For an idea of the fruit that this reunion actually bore, soon after this Ozzy went on to record the worst album of his solo career and then gave birth to the most ridiculous of MTV\u2019s creations since the Real World in The Osbournes. Considering what might have happened if these guys actually went into the studio, I would argue that this reunion was a failure, and 10 years of studio silence is a de facto concurrence of my opinion with objective truth.\n",
        "\nHaving a large collection of cloned or otherwise useless compilations under your name is something of an occupational hazard if you\u2019re an established name in heavy metal. Few suffer from this dilemma more than the founders of the genre Black Sabbath and many of its members who since went on to their own projects, and although Dio has been an established name on his own, he has a fair share of pointless releases under his moniker. This particular release essentially functions as a poor man\u2019s \u201cStand Up And Shout: The Dio Anthology\u201d, as it covers most of the esteemed metal icon\u2019s career since the 1970s. They took the route of less Elf material and more Rainbow and Dio songs, which results in a much heavier and more progressive character, but botch the song ordering and essentially churn out a two disc version of most cheap song sampler versions of compilations that ought to go for $4 a pop at best.\n\nTo give you an idea as to how random this comes off at times, I invite you to listen to the song \u201cHoochie Koochie Woman\u201d from Ronnie\u2019s Elf days and then listen to either \u201cSign Of The Southern Cross\u201d or \u201cDream Evil\u201d immediately afterward and then tell me if placing a formulaic old school rock song with an exceptional vocal performance next to either a longwinded acoustic doom epic or a heavier and faster version of \u201cMan On The Silver Mountain\u201d with a 1987 production would make sense when listening to an album, compilation or not. There is very little sense of pacing going on here at all, apart from a compilation that tries desperately to sound unique from those that use either the tried and true chronological approach, or some variant of an album emulation approach where the songs are placed in a certain order to simulate the feeling of listening to an actual studio release. The only place where this even begins to succeed at sounding like the latter of these two approaches is at the beginning with \u201cHoly Diver\u201d, which has that pristine keyboard intro with the sound of wind in the distance, a perfect segue to any album.\n\nA positive aspect of this album that does make it a superior one to many single CD compilations is that the greater amount of space gave the compilers the ability to represent every album in Dio\u2019s lengthy career with his own band. Too often albums such as \u201cLock Up The Wolves\u201d and \u201cDream Evil\u201d are woefully under represented and sometimes not at all, but here everything seems to be equal, though there is a little bit of a tilt towards \u201cHoly Diver\u201d and \u201cThe Last In Line\u201d, which is typical of most compilations under the Dio name. The choice of \u201cEvil Eyes\u201d was a particularly interesting choice given that it essentially functions as the missing link between the two albums represented here, having the more keyboard oriented character of \u201cThe Last In Line\u201d, but also having a really hard edged riff approach that is fairly similar to \u201cStand Up And Shout\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t Talk To Strangers\u201d. The only disappointment here is that from the vast number of great songs off of \u201cLock Up The Wolves\u201d, they had to go with the obligatory title track, which is all but interchangeable with the similarly slow and doom driven \u201cShame On The Night\u201d.\n\nI give this album credit for making some interesting song choices and for attempting to differentiate itself from the rest of the point, but this is not something that I recommend parting with monetary wealth over. You get songs on here that you won\u2019t get on the similarly long compilation \u201cStand Up And Shout: The Dio Anthology\u201d, but you don\u2019t get any songs that can\u2019t be found on other releases, whereas with the latter you get more Elf songs that are hard to come by and a solid live version of \u201cSacred Heart\u201d. If you like anything by Dio from his respective work with Rainbow and Sabbath, save up your pennies and get one of his full length releases from his 80s back catalog, you\u2019ll thank me later.\n",
        "\nThis is something of an oddity in the form of a CD, bring to a younger generation a live performance that was meant for their parents. It shows Black Sabbath at their youngest and most vital of stages, locked inside the confines of music and camera technology that existed at the time. It was probably the renewed interest in the original Sabbath lineup that occurred after the \u201cReunion\u201d release that spurred the release of this, but suffice to say, this is about as far away from that neo-Hollywood of a live show as any performance can get. There\u2019s no dramatic entrance to a circus display of pyrotechnics and smoke, no elaborate stage to make the band seem large than life, just 4 post-hippie era rockers with a desire to tell all who would listen about the darker side of life.\n\nThe performance of all in congress is fairly good given the circumstances. Ozzy does what he has often failed to do for the past 16 years, which is sing in pitch, and the music is pretty tight and together given that it is presented in a slightly more controlled version of a rock jam. Geezer and Bill Ward are basically a flawless foundation, never missing a note, yet Bill seems quite keen on switching up his drum fills and keeping things very free sounding. The only person who comes up a tad bit short is Tony Iommi, who handles his riffs well enough, but struggles a bit with the solos for \u201cIron Man\u201d \u201cBlack Sabbath\u201d a bit. It\u2019s one of those things where a person tries to play a solo note for note, but finds himself either ahead of himself or a little behind and attempts to cover for it by improvising for a few seconds. It\u2019s one of those things that you usually tend to notice if you\u2019re a guitar player and you know the songs, but in this case it sticks out like a sore thumb.\n\nAlthough I wouldn\u2019t quite call this an essential purchase, it is a nice piece of history that will treat any fan of the band well. It showcases a band that was young and determined, and one that seemed to have the whole world against them yet couldn\u2019t be bothered to care about it. Their just out there, plain as can be, playing their music in the most stripped down of settings, and proving in the process that some music is strong enough to surpass most others even without the aid of radio play or a stream of promotional music videos.\n",
        "\nThere is a basic rule of thumb that is often followed when releasing compilations of well established artists, particularly in the case of Black Sabbath, and it is \u201cwhy release one when you can release two and have twice the amount of pointlessness in the process?\u201d That rule was elevated to something of an art form when it came to the two Tony Martin era compilations that were put out in extremely close proximity to each other in 2001. They both feature a grab-bag approach to song selection that doesn\u2019t make much sense from a sales perspective given that \u201cHeadless Cross\u201d tends to be the most well known album and the rest of the albums had radio hits that aren\u2019t represented on either compilation, so the motivation of these releases make little sense except for as a song sampler, which would normally put them at a lower price level, but not in the case of these two.\n\n\u201cRock Champions\u201d differs from the \u201cPlatinum Disc\u201d compilation only in that EMI took a route of song selection that made a little bit more sense. It\u2019s far from being a good listen, however, due to the track ordering coming across as randomly done and the flow of the album being extremely disjointed. Sabbath went through various stages where they would begin an album with either an epic intro or a fast paced song to open things up, but \u201cHeaven In Black\u201d leading off and being followed by \u201cAnno Mundi\u201d doesn\u2019t make much sense from a pacing standpoint. One minute your high on a solid upper tempo song with an extremely catchy chorus and a punchy set of rock riffs, and the next you are compelled to sit back and listen to an elongated choir intro with something of a \u201cChildren Of The Sea\u201d styled guitar line followed by an epic reinterpretation of \u201cZero The Hero\u201d with the tempo staying largely slow. One might guess that EMI was trying to create a feel similar to what was accomplished on \u201cHeaven And Hell\u201d, but unfortunately these songs don\u2019t work the same way. \n\nFrom here on in there\u2019s a back and forth between epic songs off of either \u201cTyr\u201d or \u201cHeadless Cross\u201d with lower fidelity and rougher but still solid songs off of \u201cForbidden\u201d. It\u2019s almost like the experience of being jerked back and forth during a storm while at sea, inducing a sense of musical motion sickness that instead of making you vomit, induces a state of confusion. There\u2019s no doubting the absolute quality of songs such as \u201cBlack Moon\u201d and \u201cJerusalem\u201d, nor with \u201cGet A Grip\u201d and \u201cI Won\u2019t Cry For You\u201d, but their placement works against the experience of listening to this album all the way through, which is a must for any sort of sympathy being given towards a compilation by someone who already has all of the albums in question. The fact that \u201cThe Battle Of Tyr\u201d leads into a song off of \u201cForbidden\u201d is the final nail in the coffin of a very troubled best of, let alone mentioning that there are no songs on here representing \u201cCross Purposes\u201d or \u201cThe Eternal Idol\u201d.\n\nThere\u2019s still a few of these floating around here and there despite being in circulation for 8 years, but there isn\u2019t any point in getting this. I have a bit more sympathy for this one than the \u201cPlatinum Disc\u201d because they had the good sense to include \u201cAnno Mundi\u201d and \u201cJerusalem\u201d, two of Sabbath\u2019s more underrated yet high quality songs, but any self-respecting fan of Sabbath who is curious about the Tony Martin era will save up his money to purchase the entire \u201cTyr\u201d album and tell Allmusic.com to piss off in the process.\n",
        "\nAlthough there is no bigger fan boy of Black Sabbath\u2019s \u201cHeadless Cross\u201d than me, I have to launch a protest against this single. It features the most well known and frequently performed song to ever come out of the Tony Martin era, but in an unnecessarily abridged format. It\u2019s not a huge loss from a lyrical standpoint as the verse that gets chopped out is recapped after the guitar solo, but the loss of bridge section and the overall shortening of the song really detracts from its sense of epic perfection. It inspires a similar though not quite as power in frustration for all who love the song \u201cHeaven And Hell\u201d every time Dio plays it live and finishes without doing the amazingly climactic, fast ending.\n\nNonetheless, although this isn\u2019t the complete masterpiece, it is quite good, especially when observed in video form. The music video featured the famous scene of a monk acting as blacksmith and hammering out a peculiar shaped cross, hammering to the beat no less, unknowing that is handiwork is destined to be chopped in half by a bolt of lightning, spelling doom for all in the nearby village being devastated by the black plague. It probably didn\u2019t have the same effect as the band\u2019s early works did in their day on the sanctimonious bunch, but I\u2019m sure there was at least a few brain dead modern evangelical leftovers from Reagan\u2019s moral majority who misinterpreted the obvious historicism at work in this song.\n\nThis is not something worth selling your soul for, unless you happen to somehow be able to find this record yet not the \u201cBlack Moon\u201d single, as this one also has the non-album bluesy throwback to \u201cSeventh Star\u201d \u201cCloak And Dagger\u201d on it. It\u2019s a bit annoying that the radio zombies and their dictatorial disc jockey masters can\u2019t seem to handle 6 and a half minutes of great music but can somehow handle 5, but there have been worse editing jobs done on classic songs than this, and there have been far more pointless single releases than this one.\n",
        "\nThere is little doubt in my mind that this song deserved its own single, but what I doubt very much is the rationale behind releasing a one-sided single. When considering the amazing songs that could have been up for being a b-side off the \u201cHeadless Cross\u201c release, most particularly the underrated, straightforward rocking with a hint of doom \u201cKill In The Spirit World\u201d, it just doesn\u2019t make any sense. Nonetheless, aside from the loneliness that \u201cDevil And Daughter\u201d suffers from on here, there isn\u2019t really much to complain about.\n\nWhat is heard here is an epic 80s reinterpretation of the driving, swinging triplet brand of heavy metal that this band pioneered about 18 years ago in \u201cChildren Of The Grave\u201d. Naturally 80s epic has a lot of ramifications to consider, most particularly a heavy keyboard presence, high operatic vocals that go as high as Ronnie Dio but are all but perfectly clean, and a faster and less formulaic approach to guitar soloing. In fact, the guitar solo heard on here rivals just about everything that Iommi has put out, perhaps only being outclassed by the wild shredding heard on the closing song of this album \u201cNightwing\u201d.\n\nIf you are crazy enough and rich enough to actually try and find the original pressing of this, I wish you luck, but there really isn\u2019t a point. It\u2019s an absolutely amazing song but there are so many other places where you can get it, including one of the several Tony Martin era compilations floating around out there, that you\u2019d be better served by just picking up in CD form. Technically this single release could be seen as a cash grab, but given how great the song is, I can\u2019t punish it too harshly.\n",
        "\nA little known fact about the late 80s period of Sabbath is that in spite of being long rid of Ozzy as a front man, his ghost still continued to haunt Iommi despite all of his best efforts. To those who wonder what the hell I\u2019m talking about, it is the funny little story about how this single\u2019s title track \u201cCall Of The Wild\u201d got its name. Apparently Tony and company had elected to call the song \u201cHero\u201d, but due to a song by the exact same name on Ozzy\u2019s latest solo offering \u201cNo Rest For The Wicked\u201d, the name was changed despite the original title being emphasized like crazy during the chorus. Likewise, the b-side \u201cDevil And Daughter\u201d its name changed from simply being called \u201cDevil\u2019s Daughter\u201d because of yet another song on said Ozzy album by that name. One begins to wonder if Ozzy projected himself through the astral plain while in a state of Zen-like meditation and decreed the song titles for two of the more fanfare oriented songs from \u201cHeadless Cross\u201d.\n\nBut band history aside, these two songs are essentially perfect for each other from a stylistic standpoint. They both feature extremely catchy choruses loaded with beautiful vocal harmonies courtesy of underrated genius Tony Martin, nifty little drum intros followed by solid driving beats out of famed and now departed kit master Cozy Powell, pleasing keyboard aesthetics from the man behind the curtain Geoff Nichols, and some of the most memorable riffs every put together by the original man of steel himself Tony Iommi. Likewise, although Iommi was all but completely stuck producing this thing himself, he came out with something that was an absolute winner, particularly in terms of the atmospheric quality that is established through the heavy keyboard usage. There isn\u2019t a dull moment to be heard anywhere, its all one big, riveting epic fest of metal worship as the masters of the original craft can only themselves deliver.\n\nThere isn\u2019t really much reason to track this down unless you are obsessed with owning every single piece of vinyl that Black Sabbath put out between 1970 and 1998, but from a historical perspective this single is sort of an interesting phenomenon. It dwarfs every single put out by the band with Tony Martin, and features some of the most inventive yet consistent moments in Tony Iommi\u2019s extensive career as a heavy metal pioneer. If nothing else, this demands that you get to the store and pick up a copy of \u201cHeadless Cross\u201d fast.\n",
        "\n\u201cHeadless Cross\u201d is arguably the greatest album put together by Black Sabbath during the Tony Martin years, but what is often missed about the history of this album was how many trials and tribulations led to its creation. If the b-sides of the last album\u2019s solitary single \u201cThe Shinning\u201d are any indication, Tony Iommi was fed up with experimenting and wanted to get back to his roots in some way, and that is seen through the two songs that are contained on this single. Both the a-side and the b-side are built within the template of an 80s production not all that dissimilar from \u201cThe Eternal Idol\u201d, but reach back in many respects to the era of the band that preceded the 1980s.\n\n\u201cBlack Moon\u201d is the more obvious hearkening back to the jam-like nature of early 70s Sabbath, built off of a driving yet bluesy riff that has some similarities to the ones heard on \u201cThe Wizard\u201d and \u201cWicked World\u201d. The vocal delivery is much smoother and has an operatic quality to it and the organ behind it definitely gives it a darkened tone that shares more commonality with early Candlesmass than with the Ozzy years of the band, but it still maintains a heavily rocking quality. The accompanying \u201cCloak And Dagger\u201d never made it onto the \u201cHeadless Cross\u201d album, likely due to the fact that its heavily bluesy feel was in contrast with the epic nature of the bulk of the album, but it\u2019s quite a treat for the ears nonetheless. As best I can describe it, it\u2019s a song that would have been more at home on \u201cSeventh Star\u201d, even though it has Tony Martin\u2019s vocals driving it along.\n\nThere are few places where the b-side on here can be found except floating around on the internet in mp3 form, but it\u2019s a worthy listen if you\u2019re looking to hear something a bit different from what Sabbath is known for. This was a heavily eclectic band, perhaps a bit too much so for their label and fans to handle given the large number of songs that got tucked away in now out of print singles. Perhaps some day Iommi will consent to some sort of rarities compilation that will contain all of these long lost experiments, but until then just remember, the internet is your friend.\n",
        "\nThis stands unique among the various singles in Black Sabbath\u2019s history because of how much it elucidates about the history of the band in a mere 3 songs. It tells the tale of Tony Martin in a state of transition, trying to make sense of the changing scenery around him and essentially carry on the Sabbath name (more due to label obligations rather than being something of his own choosing) without any of his original band mates. As much of a radical change back towards the metal paradigm that \u201cThe Eternal Idol\u201d was, it did not happen at the mere drop of a hat, but came about through a series of experiments, some of which are only known via this single.\n\n\u201cThe Shining\u201d is the catchiest song from Iommi\u2019s 1987 effort and among the more consistent with the character of Black Sabbath, at least as it was since Ozzy left the fold. The principle riff that it is based around was supposedly being kicked around by the famed axe man since the time that \u201cBorn Again\u201d was being put together. It\u2019s among the more epic sounding songs to come out of the band in the late 80s, going through a fairly large number of differing ideas, and spearheaded by a driving power chord line that shares some commonality with \u201cHeaven And Hell\u201d. But the star attraction at work here is clearly recently recruited vocalist Tony Martin, whose high soaring yet clean cut vocals bear a large similarity to Solitude Aeternus front man Robert Lowe (a band that was not quite established yet at this juncture in history), and fills the entire arrangement with a sense of light to contrast the dark musical surroundings.\n\nBut in spite of the obvious power and intrigue of the a-side, the b-sides prove to be a bit more educational to those who want a lesson in Sabbath history. Essentially at this point Iommi was kicking around several other potential paths for the next coming album, one of which being a continuation of the \u201cSeventh Star\u201d sound in \u201cSome Kind Of Woman\u201d, which is basically a more riff happy yet not as lead drenched answer to Van Halen\u2019s \u201cHot For Teacher\u201d. It\u2019s more rock than metal, but it slays something amazing and is among the fastest songs that have ever been put together by doom pioneer Tony Iommi. The other path was to reach back to the Ozzy era of the band which consisted of older 70s oriented rock with a dark, down tuned guitar sound not all that far off from \u201cSabotage\u201d. Suffice to say, the original version of \u201cBlack Moon\u201d is very much a far cry from the finished version that adorned the \u201cHeadless Cross\u201d album. Its tuned down significantly lower, has a much rougher mix that sounds somewhat comparable to that of \u201cSabbath Bloody Sabbath\u201d, and has a much darker organ sound. It\u2019s hard to determine which version is better, but in spite of being built off the same pattern of notes and riffs, each version of this song sounds very different in character from the other.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to say where this single can be found except for maybe at some pawnshop in the middle of nowhere, so your best bet is to look online somewhere for the b-sides of this obscure yet elucidating release. It all but completely foreshadows the many twists and turns in Sabbath\u2019s sound that were to come, and it manages to be an enjoyable listen in spite of practically being in completely different genres in each song. Tony Iommi could be seen as a mad scientist of sorts, only wearing black leathers and crosses rather than a white jacket, and this is definitely among his stranger yet very interesting experiments.\n",
        "\nThe often derided and rarely understood solo effort of Tony Iommi \u201cSeventh Star\u201c, which was never meant for the Black Sabbath name, yielded a singular radio hit that manages to strike its own chord despite being well removed from anything ever attempted by the man who gave us \u201cIron Man\u201d and \u201cSymptom Of The Universe\u201d. Say what one might about the rudimentary format of verses and choruses with keyboards a plenty and solos on the restrained side, this thing is just as catchy as they come. Nonetheless, aside from Iommi\u2019s signature soloing style, which does shine through with its usual bluesy luster, anyone hearing this song for the first time will have a hard time admitting that this was under the Black Sabbath moniker.\n\nThe true charm of this release isn\u2019t so much the song itself, but the alternate version that accompanied the famed music video featuring later \u201cStar Trek - The Next Generation\u201d actress Denise Crosby. Just like with cooking a fine delicacy, the slightest little addition of one or two spices can radically effect the taste of the final product, and here the simple addition of a soulful backing choir during the chorus section turns a somewhat plain, radio oriented rock song into something much more interesting. Naturally the song itself isn\u2019t much if what your looking for is crushing riffs, but as far as the vocal performance goes, Glenn Hughes never sounded better. His hard hitting, rough edged, blues/rock inspired shouts are just the right touch to turn a set of 4 or 5 chords into something that won\u2019t ever be forgotten by those who\u2019ve heard it.\n\nThe b-side is a little bit less interesting from a vocal standpoint, but \u201cAngry Heart\u201d definitely is a good listen if you like the mellow, catchy yet riff oriented style heard out of the likes of Ratt, W.A.S.P. and a couple of other harder edged adherents to 80s rock/metal. It\u2019s not the most complex thing that Iommi has ever put out by any stretch of the imagination, and is among the more formulaic offerings from the \u201cSeventh Star\u201d album, but it does its job accompanying the main attraction. \n\nThe problem with these songs is not that they lack anything in the fun or creativity department, but more that they are tailored for a different audience. I can see people who are big on bands like Skid Row and Motley Crue taking to this album, but most who know Sabbath for any or all of their others will likely have a hard time identifying with this. Eclectic minds may differ with the Ozzy and Dio crowd, but I would argue that with few exceptions, this is not something that fans of the band should spend a lot of money on. It is an acquired taste to say the least, and although I have acquired it, I can sort of see why others didn\u2019t.\n",
        "\nWhen it comes to compilations, I tend to not have much use for them unless they offer something aside from songs in some unique ordering that I likely already have on the respective band\u2019s studio album releases. Although a 10 song collection of radio hits that will likely be encountered every couple of days during a routine commute is nice for casual fans of a band who like to control their listening experience at bit more, die hard followers like myself don\u2019t really get much out of it aside from a couple pages thick CD booklet that tells me things that I probably already know. But a compilation of re-released singles that can\u2019t really be found anymore due to the passage of time is an entirely different story.\n\nBlack Sabbath had such a compilation released on their behalf back in the year 2000, containing 6 single releases that were originally exclusively on vinyl in CD form. It is loaded with visual perks: from all of the original cover art maintained upon cardboard cases that house each individual CD, which have a design on their top side to make them resemble records, and also includes a rather impressive poster that has all of the album covers from everything that the band officially released between 1970 and 1978.\n\nThe selection of singles is a little bit puzzling as \u201cMaster Of Reality\u201d isn\u2019t represented at all, and several other prominent albums such as \u201cSabotage\u201d and \u201cTechnical Ecstasy\u201d are only represented through b-side songs. This probably had to do with a desire to try to get as many albums represented within a collection of only 6 releases, but the oddity of having 2 singles from their biggest flop \u201cNever Say Die\u201d and only one single from their first two albums is a bit strange. Nonetheless, the songs that are contained are essential listening, though mostly from a historical standpoint as they highlight some of Sabbath\u2019s most massive leaps from being a mostly 60s rock oriented jam band with a slightly darker character to the beginnings of what would become doom metal.\n\nThis is a recommended pickup for anyone who is a huge fan of the band or a completist that wants to proliferate some version of the band\u2019s historical catalog without breaking his personal bank at pawnshops looking for the original vinyl versions. It\u2019s only a limited segment of a band that essentially defined the entire sound of heavy metal and ushered in several generations of very different musical offspring, but it is a worthwhile segment to have if you are so inclined to learn about it.\n",
        "\nAs hard as it may be for most of us metal heads to fathom today, the music that we know and love has its roots in 1960s hippie culture. Though some of the offerings that would later be put on the famous self-titled \u201cBlack Sabbath\u201d LP would foreshadow a much darker characterization of rock music in a metal transition, Ozzy and company got their start covering and then composing blues oriented rock with a heavily psychedelic character. If nothing else, the image of the band on this single\u2019s cover art is indicative of the time that this came out.\n\n\u201cEvil Woman\u201d is your quintessential bluesy rock number, consisting of a very basic, formulaic, and repetitive set of pentatonic riffs and a tight yet easy going rhythm section. The vocal work has an attitude to it, yet is restrained in its range and largely blends with the rest of the arrangement. Sabbath\u2019s reinterpretation of this song, though today considered fairly tame and in keeping with classic rock practices, was likely the darkest thing that anyone who attended their gigs had ever heard, owing completely to the down tuned character of Iommi\u2019s guitar and the bass heavy tone all but links it by the hip to the bass line.\n\nThe b-side and better known song \u201cWicked World\u201d sees a much more forward looking style, largely resembling the harder rocking character of Led Zepplin\u2019s late 60s material, but with a bit more of a jam session character. Geezer Butler\u2019s heavily active bass work and Bill Ward\u2019s loose flowing, fill happy beats give it a heavily jazz-oriented character, while Iommi\u2019s bluesy yet heavier rock riffs give the overall listen a very cynical character. Things come to a head when things calm down and a brief broken chord line that sounds semi-classical in nature paves the way for a brilliant guitar alone solo in a similar vain to the one heard on Zepplin\u2019s \u201cHeart Breaker\u201d, but with a more structured and disciplined character.\n\nFor the enthusiastic Sabbath completist looking to add this to his collection of historical releases, this and 5 other classic Ozzy era singles have been brought back from the vinyl age in CD form as part of a singles compilation. It is not an essential release and offers nothing that can\u2019t be gotten from the band\u2019s debut LP, but it carries a level of charm for those obsessed with the early history of heavy metal. In short, two very primitive yet auspicious offerings that foreshadowed a new kind of music that is loved by the adventurous, feared by the sanctimonious, and ready to be appreciated by all who hold rock and metal in high regard.\n",
        "\nAfter having scared the living daylights out of the masses with the creepy title track and pioneering doom rock/metal song that bore their name, Black Sabbath pushed the envelope of the early 70s further still with an offering that would serve as a template for a faster and more furious brand of loud music. Ironically enough, \u201cParanoid\u201d was conceived rather quickly and considered filler by Iommi and company upon being printed, but proved to be one of Sabbath\u2019s most well remembered song. It stands in opposition to the entire format of their first album and lacks any of the jam session characteristics that defined a lot of 60s oriented rock music. It consists of a very disciplined and limited set of guitar riffs, a driving beat and bass line rather than traveling improvisatory-like work, and lyrics that left the realm of political protest and horror for the realm of mental illness.\n\nThe b-side of this famous and brief single is one of the similar songs from the band\u2019s debut album. But in spite of its formulaic nature, \u201cThe Wizard\u201d is extremely loose and jazzy sounding next to the soldier like discipline of \u201cParanoid\u201d. Bluesy lead guitar fill ins are thrown in through out the entire song in between sung verse lines, the lead sections are placed in multiple places and have a strictly rock flavor rather than the somewhat forward looking, octave effect oriented solo on the a-side, and the harmonica theme naturally pulls the song back to an earlier era. Nonetheless, a commonality between the two leaps out at the listener when hearing how the elongated power chords attack hard and linger like a dense shadow.\n\nBasically this is more fodder for Sabbath completists looking for something to adorn their collection with its own unique art work and history. It\u2019s historical nature is quite massive, as to this day, many metal bands play faster and more complex versions of this song. The character of guitar sound and recording technology may have changed, but the wicked nature of that distorted, well placed, palm muted power chord never will.\n",
        "\nFlash forward about 2 years from when Sabbath first began their own campaign of \u201cshock and awe\u201d, and the band found themselves delving further into the experimental possibilities opening up to them and the rest of the rock music world. Interestingly enough, this era saw an approach to song creation that relied a lot less on signature riffs and more on lyrics, rhythm section work and atmosphere. Though I personally regard \u201cVol. 4\u201d as the weakest of Sabbath\u2019s first 6 and classic Ozzy albums, it was a very interesting and very different approach from the loose jams of the 1st album, the signature riffing of \u201cParanoid\u201d and the crushing heaviness and aggression of \u201cMaster Of Reality\u201d.\n\n\u201cTomorrow\u2019s Dream\u201d is probably among the least interesting songs for any guitarist of more than 1 year\u2019s experience to learn, consisting of two riffs that are essentially three chords and a bridge that is only slightly more complex. But what is going around all of this is much more interesting, particularly the double bass drum work of Bill Ward, a practice that was not really as common in 1972 as it would become in 1983. Combined with a bass line that wanders around a fair bit, what is accomplished is a sort of rumbling back drop that seems to create two dimensions in the song, one for the rhythm section, and the other for the guitar and Ozzy\u2019s vocals. The singing on this song is really formulaic, and tends to play off the simplicity set forth by the guitars, but does make for a nice sing along tune for anyone on a long commute.\n\n\u201cLaguna Sunrise\u201d is among the more famous of Iommi\u2019s many acoustic guitar caprices. It has a highly repetitive but catchy acoustic guitar theme that loosely resembles \u201cOver The Hills And Far Away\u201d by Zepplin, which is interesting considering that \u201cVol. 4\u201d came out about a year before \u201cHouses Of The Holy\u201d did. There\u2019s a nice little string orchestra backdrop to this, but for the most part it listens like a somewhat redundant acoustic guitar duo with no vocals. Nonetheless, it probably paved the way for such interesting instrumental preludes such as \u201cSphinx (The Guardian)\u201d and \u201cThe Scarlet Pimpernel\u201d down the road.\n\nBasically this is more fodder for completists and rarity hounds. It\u2019s extremely hard to come by in its original vinyl form, but is also available in CD form thanks to a limited edition compilation of Ozzy era singles along with 5 others. It\u2019s among the weaker of single releases to come out of the band during their high period in the first half of the 1970s, but it shows a band in evolution, moving towards their most defining albums in the mid 70s in \u201cSabbath Bloody Sabbath\u201d and \u201cSabotage\u201d. They say that not every experiment in the science lab can be a successful breakthrough, but even lesser discoveries have their merits.\n",
        "\nThis is basically the prelude before the mighty storm that was Sabbath\u2019s crowning achievement with Ozzy Osbourne at the helm. Funnily enough, the single that promoted said album behaves as that forbidding crack of lightning before the downpour, nailing the listener to the wheel with a crushing main riff that still echoes through many metal band compositional offerings to this very day. But despite being a certified riff monster, \u201cSabbath Bloody Sabbath\u201d is a very progressive and complex beast, going through a haunting acoustic section loaded with rhythmic fills and bluesy lead ornaments. The production is a bit unusual in character, with an exceptionally subdued drum and guitar presence and a really forward sounding bass, almost like the mirror opposite of what is considered a raw production by 90s extreme metal standards, but coming off as raw in its own way.\n\nAlthough this promotional offering definitely leaves the listener in a state of utter ecstasy, the b-side that was on the foreign exported versions of the single retains one of the worst songs off of Sabbath\u2019s singular step back in quality that was \u201cVol. 4\u201d. \u201cChanges\u201d is probably one of the most redundant and poorly conceived ballads ever, and definitely the worst one put forth by Sabbath. That sappy piano line just reeks of every generic 70s arena ballad and 80s power ballad in its utter lack of development. Ozzy\u2019s voice also proves to not be up for the task of being as exposed as a lone piano accompaniment makes a vocalist, despite this being where he was at his peak as a singer. \n\nNevertheless, this is a solid piece of history that can now be enjoyed as part of a 6 part compilation of Ozzy era singles put together on CD with all the original artwork. The days of flower power were coming to a close, as can be gleaned not only by the progressive direction that the band had began to take, but by the blood oozing from the two O\u2019s in \u201cSabbath Bloody Sabbath\u201d on the cover, like a pair of eyes bleeding at some terrible sight. Recommended to Sabbath maniacs and rarity hounds only, but definitely something that every fan of metal should be aware of because of its highly influential nature.\n",
        "\nIt\u2019s a difficult thing to fathom, but the sad truth is that all good things must come to an end, and the end was very much in sight in the lead up to the last LP of the Ozzy years of Black Sabbath. Much like the random ramblings of an ancient man in the final stages before death, the band went out in one of the most incongruous of ways possible with an album that was all over the place and didn\u2019t articulate much aside from the fact that the band was still alive in a metaphysical sense. But in that fit of madness there were a few moments of clarity, and they manifested themselves in the two singles that preceded \u201cNever Say Die\u201d.\n\n\u201cA Hard Road\u201d is by no standard a great Sabbath song, but it is a song that has a sense of familiarity and catchiness that makes it recognizable to the metal fan. It rests on a driving mid tempo riff set that tends to drone rather than develop, but rests beneath an adequate vocal performance with a solid melodic contour that bears some similarity to the band\u2019s simpler music on \u201cVol. 4\u201d. The highlights are the really simple yet highly effective guitar solo that can practically be sung along with, and the stew of melodic vocal overlapping that goes along during the closing section of the song. \n\n\u201cSymptom Of The Universe\u201d was a really solid choice for a b-side if the goal was to remind the Sabbath faithful of the time that the band still remembered what they had accomplished, although it utterly overshadows the a-side at every term. It\u2019s one of the fastest and most riveting of Sabbath\u2019s many proto-metal creations, and also drenched in progressive trappings and technical showmanship that rivals the entire progressive rock scene of the time. The principle riff is up there in terms of heaviness with \u201cChildren Of The Grave\u201d and faster than the original speed number \u201cParanoid\u201d, and shows the beginnings of what would later become Sabbath\u2019s darker character on such offerings as \u201cBorn Again\u201d, \u201cHeadless Cross\u201d, \u201cDehumanizer\u201d and \u201cCross Purposes\u201d.\n\nAlthough long out of the realm of mainstream accessibility in its original vinyl form, this can now be found along with 5 other singles from this era of Sabbath in CD form, with the original artwork still intact. It does show a band that was in decay and on the brink of self-destruction, but even the ending gasps of a genius before passing on are a noteworthy event for those that will compile his biography.\n",
        "\nAs stated before, \u201cNever Say Die\u201d was essentially the last mutterings of an elderly genius before slipping away into the peaceful sleep of death. It is somewhat ironic that the band put forth two of their most optimistic songs as promotional singles to their last LP as the original incarnation of Sabbath, mostly because the end result was an absolute disaster. But even in those final moments of delirious rambling, some sense can be made, and was as far as the title track of this album is concerned.\n\n\u201cNever Say Die\u201d is one of the most happy and upbeat songs every to come out of Sabbath, perhaps even more so than their infamous Christian rock hit \u201cAfter Forever\u201d. The principle guitar riff sounds like a lighter take on Thin Lizzy\u2019s \u201cThe Boys Are Back In Town\u201d, though naturally lacking the dueling lead guitar assault. Ozzy\u2019s vocals largely resemble what they would be throughout the 80s, moderated yet still fairly powerful. \n\nThe choice in b-side here is a bit strange, but perhaps that is to be expected giving the analogy that I used before. \u201cShe\u2019s Gone\u201d is a half-way decent ballad, though it doesn\u2019t really serve Ozzy well as he tends to suffer when his voice is really exposed. Instead of a really sappy piano line, this song has a fairly decent though somewhat clich\u00e9 guitar line that is accompanied by a better sounding orchestral mix. The song just sort of comes and goes, but never offends the ears in any way.\n\nThe rapid Sabbath completist will probably hunger for the original vinyl version of this, but due to scarcity and the high price that would likely break most peoples\u2019 personal banks, that sort is recommended to seek out the year 2000 Sabbath singles compilation, which carries every single in this review series in CD form. It\u2019s a fairly solid retrospective on the band that comes with lots of interesting album art, but not an essential purchase as these were put together in the days before b-sides were unique, non-album tracks.\n",
        "\nOzzy Osbourne\u2019s 60th birthday this week has brought up the urge to review one of the forefathers of Heavy Metal. But this review will be on a great creation made after Ozzy\u2019s era. \n\nAfter Ray Gillen of Badlands left the band in 1986 , Black Sabbath recruited the Albaynian wonder and powerful vocalist, Tony Martin. With Tony, the band released some top level albums like: The Eternal Idol , Headless Cross , TYR and after a short break , while Dio took over in 1991-1992, Tony returned and Sabbath released its greatest album and most memorable one in Tony\u2019s era. \n\nThe producion of Cross Purposes , made by Leif Mases and Black Sabbath, is a continuence of the overwhelming ones which has followed Sabbath throughout their long career. Except from the drums, that sounds almost differently from every Sabbath album in the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s, other instruments sound the same as always. Iommi\u2019s Gibson SG\u2019s morbid signature sound is not leaving the zone for more than 20 years and keeps bringing on the sudden chill with a heavy and cool sound. Butler\u2019s bass is not strong as it was in the 70\u2019s but still is a dominant figure. Last is the addtion of the keyboards, that was not a common thing for Sabbath, especially in the 80\u2019s. The keys have an amazing sound while providing a huge support for the album\u2019s atmosphere. \n\nOn this release, Sabbath still maintains its magic from the past and keeps the flame burning with exciting, yet morbid and doomy songs that won\u2019t leave the mind to rest. The music is still flowing through the same line as always bit with a much heavier approach. In comparison to their 70\u2019s era , Sabbath, all along the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s, has created a new image for themselves as a striaght forward Heavy Metal band. This album, virtually, goes in this same approach. The things that slightly remind of the 70\u2019s are the guitar\u2019s riffs and the bass line. In this release such small reminders can be noticed in the slow tempoed, \u201cVirtual Death\u201d. As it seems, Sabbath\u2019s new image gave them more power and appreciation among other bands that were , actually, influenced by them. \n\nLyricly, Sabbath perserve their usual lyrical themes like life and death , the occult and other religious stuff. \u201cCross Of Thorns\u201d , \u201cBack To Eden\u201d \u201cCardinal Sin\u201d and \u201cI Witness\u201d are best examples for Sabbath\u2019s main issues of Religion. \u201cImmaculate Deception\u201d and \u201cVirtual Death\u201d are the example for the Life and Death issues. \n\nIommi\u2019s music still remains mysterious and dark with his influential guitar riffs and neverending solos, Butler\u2019s bass support has almost the same melodic verse as always. The major impact , in the music around Cross Purposes, came through Tony Martin and the versitile drummer , Bobby Rondinelli. Martin is surely one of the best vocalists of his time. His emotive and strong voice can place him with the top of other great vocalists such as Bruce Dickinson , Dio and Rob Halford. Every song on this release is a well credited work by this man. Although Martin , in the present, is busy in other projects and bands, Black Sabbath is, without a doubt, the best place to be for him. Today\u2019s Martin\u2019s main business in music is with his own band that is based on his name. \n\nThe drummer , Rondinelli, shows an impressive ability and has a lot of presence everywhere in the album. His drumming is a bit more progressive than in Bill Ward\u2019s days. All is well accorded to the changes that Sabbath went through since the 70\u2019s. Rondinelli is one , in the line of drummers that were in Sabbath like Vinnie Appice and Cozy Powell, that help to keep the band\u2019s music more suitable for it\u2019s genre and time. Today , Rondinelli is still busy with his self named band that is fronted by Tony Martin. The Keyman , Geoff Nichols, is not the virtuous type, his role is more like many other keyboardists like Don Aiery. Today , Nicholls has the same role in Tony Martin\u2019s band. \n\nCross Purposes is a whole load of hits. Every Heavy Metal fan can find everything here. Melody , doom , Sabbath riffs and even a ballad. The trip begins with the strong \u201cI Witness\u201d that continues the new/old way of Sabbath with Martin. Coming in second is the best track in this release ,\u201dCross Of Thorns\u201d. This song has power, strong lyrics, magnificent solo and a memorable chrous. \u201cPsychophobia\u201d is a Heavy Metal cracker with heavy riffs and great drumming. Martin makes this track a fierce, candid and something that is so common to Black Sabbath. \u201cVirtual Death\u201d is a remmant of the 70\u2019s. A slow paced track that screams mystery and pain. After that heavyweight track comes the release and it comes with \u201cImmaculate Deception\u201d. This track is the fastest track in the album. Fast, not like in Thrash Metal, but for Sabbath it can be considered as a speedster. Also this song posses a great solo , heavy riffs and great chorus. \u201cDying For Love\u201d is a well done ballad that has a beautiful leading riff and along with Martin\u2019s soft singing, it\u2019s a mind blower. \u201cBack To Eden\u201d, another explosive and catchy track that stays in the same vein. \u201cThe Hand That Rocks The Cradle\u201d is the first runner up to be the best track of the album. A well crafted track with hard lyrics, complex riffs and a chorus that just won\u2019t stop being amazing. \u201cCardinal Sin\u201d is another one of Sabbath\u2019s religious songs about sins for the Lord. The mixture of the keys with the guitar\u2019s rhythm provides a massive effect on this song\u2019s theme. \u201cEvil Eye\u201d sometimes reminds of \u201cLady Evil\u201d made in Dio\u2019s era in Sabbath. These two songs are not identical , musically, but when noticing the concept of the lyrics , one can\u2019t miss the imagination between them. Even the aura all around them is similar. \n\nBlack Sabbath is a band, that many artists and fans, look up to as the greatest Heavy Metal act ever to be formed. They went through many changes since their formation in 1969 in Birmingham , UK. These changes , unlike some opinions, made this band even greater than they were back in the 70\u2019s. Cross Purpose comes as a supporter for this emphasis. Today, Black Sabbath are touring with their original 70\u2019s lineup and the fans are still waiting for a comeback album.\n",
        "\nAbout 12 years ago the masses were saturated in mindless glee over the news of the original lineup of heavy metal\u2019s forefathers Black Sabbath reuniting. I must confess that at the time I was swept up by this tide of sensationalism as I had spent a good amount of time in a Sabbath cover band in high school playing all of the obligatory classics note for note on my trusty six string. But even though many thought that the original magic would return and a new studio album would be in the works, the final culmination of what became one of the greatest farces in Metal history turned out to be this solitary song.\n\nNaturally some will point to the other compositional effort of 1998 \u201cSelling My Soul\u201d to disprove this point, but as far as any kind of actual attempt at recapturing the original spirit, this is pretty much it. What we have to show in the confused little demon wannabe known as \u201cPsycho Man\u201d is something that is about 2/3 Ozzy Osbourne plodding with a small helping of atmospheric detailing in the mode of \u201cNo More Tears\u201d and \u201cOzzmosis\u201d, and 1/3 of something that might have been heard on \u201cCross Purposes\u201d or \u201cDehumanizer\u201d, but with less energy and enthusiasm. This listens closer to being an earlier version of a pop/rock/AOR version of metal that would later be explored by Motley Crue with the \u201cRed, White And Crue\u201d new song \u201cIf I Die Tomorrow\u201d. \n\nThe weakness in this song doesn\u2019t end with the lack of interesting songwriting and the going through the motions nature of the riffs and predictable rhythm section accompaniment, but also bleeds into the overall performance. Ozzy\u2019s vocals are all but completely shot, and all of the studio magic in world may bring it up to a tolerable state, but can not hide the lack of range and dynamics in the performance. Multiple voice parts are overdubbed into the chorus to give the appearance of a stronger arrangement, but tends to perplex the ears and defeats the purpose of this song, which is to be a radio hit. Granted, the name recognition attached to this band was so strong at this point due to the media hype that just about anything short of the decrepit rubbish heard out of Metallica on \u201cSt. Anger\u201d would have dazzled critics and fans alike.\n\nNaturally there must be some perks on here to make up for the crappy title song on this single, right? Wrong! In true Metallica fashion, Sabbath put out two versions of this that both essentially compound the problems inherent in the title track. The first version throws in a shortened version of an already predictable song, as if the masses are too dumb to comprehend 5 minutes of 4 bare bones riffs with banal melodies, or maybe the concept of vocal counterpoint is too much for them to handle the ending where the two choruses are mixed together over the faster riff. We are also treated to a remix of said song that basically destroys any of the atmosphere established in the album version, dries out the drums and makes the bell tolls at the beginning almost inaudible. The other version of this single, in an equally stupid fashion, takes out the complete version of the song and replaces it with a pretty poor live performance of \u201cParanoid\u201d off the \u201cReunion\u201d album, where Ozzy\u2019s inability to hold a pitch is not masked by multiple takes and input from others reviewing the process.\n\nAlthough all but completely impossible to find, this release has found a home on the internet in a few places, so if you\u2019re a core-Sabbath fan from any era and you\u2019re up for some self-inflicted pain, then check this out. But for those who aren\u2019t into that but are of a similar musical persuasion, I don\u2019t think I need to reiterate the fact that there was basically no studio material at all after the release of the \u201cReunion\u201d album and that Sabbath has essentially been dead since barring the resurgence of the Dio lineup of the band under a different name. This band went from being a force to be reckoned with in the recording studio throughout the 70s, 80s, and the first half of the 90s to basically being a sideshow attraction for Ozzy\u2019s circus of self-worship Ozzfest. But even if you ignore all of that, this song still sucks and is maybe just slightly ahead of the horrid dribble that Ozzy put out on \u201cDown To Earth\u201d a few years later.\n",
        "\nWhen entering the realm of forgotten wonders that we call a bargain store, I happened upon a deal just too auspicious to ignore. But little did I know when I saw a price of dollars 3, that a horrid experience soon awaited me. The year printed was 1977 and the vinyl\u2019s casing had an artistic rendering grand, but the gears of my merriment would soon be doused with the coarsest of sand. So thus I went home and dusted off the phonograph, and awaited what I\u2019d hope would be an auditory demon\u2019s wrath.\n\nThat intro riff of \u201cParanoid\u201d kicked off this album with a familiar ring, and then I was reminded of a time when Ozzy could still sing. But soon the novelty faded and I sat down to observe, a listener\u2019s fate that no man could ever deserve. The back and forth between songs from 70s Sabbath near and far, quickly turned from Metal madness into a decrepit tar. Why should one go to any store and part with monies silver or green, when a sitting at the halls of Rock radio would freely grant the same dreams.\n\nAnd what of the pacing of these songs too familiar thus? Now this is where I must raise quite a gargantuan fuss. From \u201cChanges\u201d to \u201cSabbath Bloody Sabbath\u201d, a sappy ballad to an epic true? Cramming long ones in the middle, with fanfare at both edges to further perplex you. There is no song on here that can be called a total miss, but the lack of distinction from the last compilation will surely make you hiss. Just obligatory classics with riffs grand yet already known, unless you live under a rock or exist in a dead zone.\n\nHave not mercy on this pile of dung for when it was conceived, for cookie cutter cash grabs old and young are not for you and me. Hear this satirical poem and understand my frustrated cries, for I can not stomach another best of with \u201cTomorrow\u2019s Dream\u201d and \u201cLaguna Sunrise\u201d. But cry not for me my friends in Metal one and all, for I simply paid 4 dollars for an artwork to adorn my wall. The moral of this story for you who frequent the bargain bin, is that a shiny piece of history on vinyl is not a guaranteed win.\n\nOriginally submitted to (www.metal-observer.com) on May 12, 2009.\n",
        "\nAny metal fan who ever felt that Sabbath was no longer Sabbath without Ozzy definitely missed out on some classic, epic heavy metal when the boys from Birmingham teamed up with Ronnie James Dio. The fusion of the two has always released good quality material, period. Bottom line.\n\nIt was an absolutely perfect line-up, but with one fatal flaw: both Iommi and Dio are strong, creative personalities, and you can only have one creative force in a group, not two very young egos fighting for control. A creative split was inevitable, and it occurred the year following this release, a split that would last nine years until the release of another great disc, \u201cDehumanizer\u201d, and of course their current incarnation, Heaven and Hell. C\u2019mon, these guys were made for each other, like Siegfried & Roy, but without the cats and cockplay. \n\n\u201cMob Rules\u201d is a shining example of why Sabbath and Dio are a perfect fit. Although it\u2019s somewhat overshadowed by its predecessor, \u201cHeaven and Hell\u201d, which has better continuity overall, this release still has some of the best, most time tested metal there is. It even offers one of Sabbath\u2019s finest moments, a track called \u201cSign of the Southern Cross\u201d, true epic metal for the ages. A classic. Beautifully written, structured and recorded, with a main riff so heavy it will haunt your dreams. \n\nThe opening track on the disc, \u201cTurn Up the Night\u201d, is a fast-paced, chugging freight train similar to \u201cNeon Knights\u201d, although not as good. This leads you to think the whole thing will be a repeat of the previous disc. But no, give it a chance, and you find a heavy metal jewel with a sound and style all its own. One thing you notice from the very first note is the lead hip-boot heaviness of the recording mix, which was probably the biggest and heaviest sound of 1981. Overall, the album is most interesting when the band focuses on what they were best at, epic doom metal, rather than blues based rock riffs. \u201cSlipping Away\u201d is the least interesting track, and \u201cE5150\u201d is pointless, unlike the instrumental experiments of older Sabbath classics, which I always enjoyed. \n\nStandout tracks include \u201cVoodoo\u201d, a classic evil Sabbath riff, with nothing new but it sounds totally kick-ass. The title track is heavy, fast and aggressive. The sound is so damn huge and everything is max. \u201cCountry Girl\u201d is a classic catchy Sabbath riff similar to the Ozzy era material, with a nice modern melodic touch. \u201cFalling Off the Edge of the World\u201d is another great Sabbath moment. This track is simply awesome from start to finish, with its haunting intro, its slow building doom riff to its fast paced, heavier than hell main theme. The album ends with \u201cOver and Over\u201d, a song that shows these guys knew as well as anybody how to write and play those power ballads that became so popular in the eighties, but with a lot less cheese.\n\nWhy did most of this stuff go unnoticed? 1981 was the era of sissy synth-pop on the airwaves, and heavy music was then being conquered by the energetic assault of the NWOBHM, lead by Iron Maiden, Def Leppard, Venom and others. Sabbath was an old dinosaur at this point, plodding its riffs from ten years before, looking for lost glory. But time has been kind. Any true metal fan will appreciate some of the finest heavy music ever made.\n",
        "\nThis compilation\u2019s title is, as the song count and time duration suggests, inaccurate if not a little bit deceptive. Barring a useless session of parsing the semantics of language, 7 songs do not qualify as a collection as far as I\u2019m concerned. But if judged as a song sampler, which is what I think was the intention of this, it\u2019s not the worse thing to come out of the endless stream of compilation releases under the Black Sabbath label. In fact, in conjunction with a purchase such as \u201cWe Sold Our Souls For Rock And Roll\u201d or \u201cGreatest Hits 1970-1978\u201d, this is a very good supplemental purchase that could help to stand in place of blowing money on the entire Ozzy era discography if you\u2019re strapped for cash.\n\nThe only song that this really shares in common with the other releases of this sort is \u201cSnowblind\u201d, which is probably among the less known and lower rated of Sabbath songs that make it onto every greatest hits album. Otherwise, the song selection consists of high accessible, but little known songs. Such rocking classics as the lead riff happy and Zepplin-like \u201cSabbra Cadabra\u201d and the down tempo doom number \u201cSupernaut\u201d are highly accessible songs that can easily be enjoyed by fans of \u201cParanoid\u201d and \u201cMaster Of Reality\u201d who are not familiar with these songs due to the abridged selection spoon fed to them by rock radio. The same story basically applies, though with a much simpler format, to \u201cSt. Vitus Dance\u201d and \u201cAfter Forever\u201d, which are among the happiest and most up beat of Sabbath\u2019s catalog and would bode well for casual fans of the band who would tend to prefer Deep Purple or Led Zepplin to them.\n\nThere is definitely a point in picking this up if your not going to invest in any of the full lengths from the Ozzy era, or if you only own \u201cBlack Sabbath\u201d and \u201cParanoid\u201d. Having said that, just over 30 minutes of music is not something that you want to spend more than maybe $7 for, particularly if your taking a gamble on whether or not these songs actually agree with your ears since they are very different from the songs often heard on the radio off of \u201cParanoid\u201d. \n\nOriginally submitted to (www.metal-observer.com) on May 11, 2009.\n",
        "\nDespite the best of efforts, every retrospective tends to lack total objectivity and is influenced by the events surrounding it during its making. In the case of the two chaptered telling of Black Sabbath\u2019s story that came about in the early 90s, this influence is fairly blatant. The first part featured a fairly mundane and boring retelling of the Ozzy years, no doubt because Tony Iommi was more focused on making music than living in the past, which is what would happen to this whole band about 6 years later. The second part, however, proved to be much more interesting, though equally as biased by the events that were taking place when it was put together.\n\nAlthough most opinions and individual recollections of the events depicted on here are heard, with the notable exceptions of Ozzy, Glenn Hughes, and Tony Martin, how these events are remembered are subjected to the dominant influence of Ronnie Dio, and the other 3 members of the \u201cMob Rules\u201d era of the band. This is mostly due to the fact that this was put together during the making of the \u201cDehumanizer\u201d album, and because the band was still in a state of life at this point in history, most of the albums created between 1983 and 1990 are treated with a sense of nostalgia, while \u201cNever Say Die\u201d and Ozzy Osbourne are all but shrugged off as complete water under the bridge, and both of the Dio era albums are treated almost as if they\u2019d happened yesterday.\n\nWhile I\u2019m not one to bemoan Ozzy being treated as a footnote in the band\u2019s history considering what occurred after this, this documentary does tend to be a little bit unfair towards the Gillian and Hughes era of the band, while the Tony Martin era is heavily represented yet still treated as something that was completely over and done with. Gillian\u2019s comments on his brief stint with Sabbath are good spirited and humorous, bringing a sort of light heartedness to what is otherwise a fairly serious affair. Cozy Powell\u2019s interviews are also fairly good natured, though not quite as animated and a bit more stoic, while Bill Ward sort of comes off as the tired old guy who used to be a drummer during his brief interview remembering the whole \u201cHeaven And Hell\u201d tour and him leaving the band. Ronnie James Dio is extremely serious and intellectual throughout most of his footage, which basically holds true for most of the mainstays in the band and Iommi in particular.\n\nMuch of the details surrounding the events that led to the constantly shifting lineups in the mid 80s are glossed over or simply omitted. Though whether this was done out of a sense of courtesy between the band members or to fit the template of the time is uncertain, it gives a brighter and more professional picture of all these guys that isn\u2019t necessarily completely true. The dispute of Dio and Appice versus Iommi and Butler is shrugged off by Dio as being merely the consequence of everyone being overworked and details about the nature of the band\u2019s breakup are skipped. Likewise, the circumstances in which Tony Martin, Cozy Power and Neil Murray were booted in favor of the \u201cDehumanizer\u201d lineup is left up to the imagination, which is again directed towards a feeling of professionalism. The truth is that Tony Martin and most of the other musicians not immediately connected to either the Dio or Ozzy years of the band were largely seen as expendable because Iommi, Butler and the others didn\u2019t see these eras of the band as being Black Sabbath, despite the label to the contrary. As a result, the presence of only Cozy Powell to represent this era doesn\u2019t fully do justice to the true nature of how that era of the band has been treated up until the point that this was made, let alone afterward.\n\nThe music videos that are shown on here are equally as interesting as the historical remembrances of each member, and masterfully crafted. Most of the earlier stuff is basic gig footage and lip synced material, of which Dio succeeds as being the most animated and entertaining to watch. It isn\u2019t until \u201cNo Stranger To Love\u201d that the formal music videos actually begin and Sabbath\u2019s short period of flirtation with MTV came into being. The video itself is somewhat corny, particularly the scenes with the characters of Denise Crosby (aka Lieutenant Yar from Star Trek TNG) and Tony Iommi reflecting on their broken relationship and the stray dog walking aimlessly through abandoned parking lots. But the song itself, which is in the special version with the backup singing during the chorus, is quite a treat for anyone who wants a more rocking version of an 80s power ballad. The Tony martin music videos are the best on here, particularly \u201cThe Shinning\u201d and \u201cHeadless Cross\u201d, which both have a strong dark and gothic sense of scenery. \u201cFeels Good To Me\u201d goes back in the corny direction again with a clich\u00e9 Cinderella-like plotline, but the song itself is good despite being edited for radio.\n\nWhen the documentary closes after showing studio footage of the band at work on \u201cDehumanizer\u201d material, there is a lot left to be pondered. The main thing is obviously factoring in what has happened since, and how the optimism of Ronnie Dio and the others about the prospects of their future seemed dreadfully misplaced. Although it is a highly entertaining video and should be bought solely based on the musical content within, a lot of the historical material comes off as either incomplete or obsolete. It is definitely something that should be looked into by anyone who really has an interest in the inner workings of this unique machine that is Black Sabbath, but it should be kept in its proper perspective and not treated as the whole story, but merely a part of it, told in the past about a still more distant past.\n\nOriginally submitted to (www.metal-observer.com) on May 11, 2009.\n",
        "\nYet another in a long line of bargain pickups that I\u2019ve happened upon in my lazy days as a farmer\u2019s market cowboy over the past 4 years, Black Sabbath\u2019s \u201cGreatest Hits 1970-1978\u201d is a great way to familiarize yourself with the entirety of the Ozzy Osbourne era of the band. Something from all 8 of said albums is available for mass consumption, as this compilation takes few risks and basically lays out the obligatory songs from each album, including the controversial final 2 albums that are often shelved by most fans of the band.\n\nThe obvious problem with this compilation for anyone who follows this band regularly is that the selections are a bit predictable, although not really any more so than \u201cWe Sold Our Souls For Rock And Roll\u201d. Obvious and accessible selections from the first four albums, including simplistic audience fanfare such as \u201cParanoid\u201d, \u201cN.I.B.\u201d and \u201cSweet Leaf\u201d ride with the more epic and experimental hits such as \u201cWar Pigs\u201d and \u201cSnowblind\u201d. The selection is predictable, but it avoids a lot of the meaningless obligatory choices such as \u201cLaguna Sunrise\u201d, \u201cTomorrow\u2019s Dream\u201d and \u201cAm I Going Insane\u201d, which are not bad songs but not something worthy of appearing on nearly every compilation to come out between 1976 and now. \n\nWhere this album proves to be a bit better of a purchase than a lot of the other Ozzy era best of releases is the inclusions from the last two albums. \u201cDirty Women\u201d is a personal favorite of mine, as it takes the catchy nature of a lot of the band\u2019s earlier epics and merges it with a somewhat more melodic and less crunchy take on their format. Likewise, the title track of \u201cNever Say Die\u201d is a nice feel good, up tempo rocker that is pretty underrated. \u201cRock And Roll Doctor\u201d is sort of stuck in late 70s rock land, but doesn\u2019t really diverge too far from Sabbath\u2019s standard formula.\n\nAlthough most tend to endorse \u201cWe Sold Our Souls For Rock And Roll\u201d as the compilation to get for this era of the band, this offers a more complete picture of what this period had to offer. Granted, \u201cTechnical Ecstasy\u201d was a bit experimental and \u201cNever Say Die\u201d was a collective failure as an album, but that does not mean that the good aspects of these albums should be ignored as many have come to do. If you can\u2019t afford the first 8 albums and just want the classics, this is the place to go, otherwise bust your ass at whatever job you have and experience the legend in its unabridged entirety.\n\nOriginally submitted to (www.metal-observer.com) on May 11, 2009.\n",
        "\nThere\u2019s a very odd sense of nostalgia attached to this album as far as I\u2019m concerned, because it was released at around the time that I had first discovered Black Sabbath\u2019s lesser known Tony Martin era albums. Unfortunately, just like the later randomly ordered \u201cThe Best Of Black Sabbath (Platinum Disc)\u201d, this doesn\u2019t quite do justice to what was accomplished during that era of the band despite what idiotic music critics and the masses think to the contrary. But it is much better ordered, does due diligence in representing the godly \u201cHeadless Cross\u201d and \u201cTyr\u201d albums, and stands as a much better collection overall.\n\nSince this, much like MEGADETH\u2019S \u201cCapitol Punishment\u201d was a final release to end Sabbath\u2019s tenure with their label I.R.S.; it is put forth with the best foot of the band\u2019s work while under said label. Things kick off with the amazingly memorable and somewhat similar to \u201cHeaven And Hell\u201d classic \u201cHeadless Cross\u201d. It never fails to amaze me that the magical atmosphere that was created on this album was done in the cheapest studio that Iommi and company could find, and that he himself produced it. Throughout the whole listen of that album there was a sort of pristine 80s darkness feel established through the heavily reverb drenched drums, thick keyboards, effects steeped bass and crunchy guitar sounds that perfectly set the tone for any compilation. \n\nAs things progress the often forgotten consistency of the entire Martin era unfold from one song to the next. Although \u201cAnno Mundi\u201d and \u201cHeaven In Black\u201d did not make this compilation, the super epic \u201cThe Sabbath Stones\u201d comes in with its blazing yet doom oriented main riff and an epic mix of Deep Purple and Ozzy era Sabbath influences, along with the Nordic trilogy that followed it on the \u201cTyr\u201d album, which has thankfully not been broken apart and robbed of its flow. Then after a brief interlude back into the Dio era of the band in the up tempo, heavy ended, yet lyrically witty \u201cTV Crimes\u201d, things segue perfectly into the bleak sounding \u201cCross Purposes\u201d. The two songs in congress here are among the darkest in the band\u2019s career, let alone the Martin years, drawing similarities to the likes of Alice In Chains. \u201cVirtual Death\u201d is actually cited as a classic Sabbath song by both Tom Warrior (Celtic Frost) and Trey Azagthoth (Morbid Angel). \n\nThings take sort of a drastic turn during in the production department when the songs from \u201cForbidden\u201d come in. The album\u2019s really rough and drum heavy production robbed it of some of its power, but the album still had a lot of excellent songs and the ones included on here are good representations of that. \u201cLoser Gets It All\u201d was only available on the Japanese import so its presence here might be a good incentive for anyone who might have all of the Martin era albums to get it, though this is a bit hard to come by so one might want to consider whether one nice straight up, mid tempo riff monster is worthy $18. \n\nUnfortunately, the flow and consistency of this album falls away when a handful of token songs from the turbulent 83-87 era come in at the end. \u201cDisturbing The Priest\u201d and \u201cThe Shining\u201d are excellent songs from this period, but their placement is a little bit awkward given the pace established earlier. Likewise, the blues/rock grooving \u201cHeart Like A Wheel\u201d is completely out of place here. Just about any other song from \u201cSeventh Star\u201d would have fit the mood of this album better, though \u201cSphinx (The Guardian)\u201d followed by the epic title track would have been my personal choice.\n\nNonetheless, if you are going to get a non-Dio, non-Ozzy compilation, this is the one that you should get. In fact, I\u2019d recommend it over more than half of the Ozzy compilations floating around since the mid 70s. It\u2019s a final testament to one of the most underrated eras in metal history, an era that was bogged down in brainless demands for a return of the original band based on some sort of misguided nostalgia that was likely brought on by the rediscovery of their 70s material via the grunge explosion. Not long later the mainstream got their wish, which was 10 years of studio silence and the de facto end of Black Sabbath as a force in the recording studio. May all of those who shelve this era be damned to Hades and be tormented forever by little demonic imps wearing \u201cHeadless Cross\u201d t-shirts.\n\nOriginally submitted to (www.metal-observer.com) on May 10, 2009.\n",
        "\nThere are basically no instances that I can recall where I\u2019ve felt any sort of anticipation for the release of a compilation, save for this one. Being someone who has made it a point to own everything with RJD and Sabbath\u2019s names on it, there would naturally be little reason for me to bother spending anything more than a few dollars on a best of album unless I was able to get some rarities to go with it. But in the case of this album, I was in the unique position to witness something that I had hoped would happen for the better part of 10 years, the resurrection of Black Sabbath as a creative force.\n\nThere are basically two ways in which to judge this compilation, the first of which is as an EP carrying 3 brand new songs from a lineup that had been on hiatus for 15 years. In this respect, \u201cThe Dio Years\u201d is a perfect release, as the new songs contained within are nothing short of amazing. Essentially all of the best modern elements of \u201cDehumanizer\u201d have been merged with the simplicity of the band\u2019s earlier efforts with Dio. \u201cThe Devil Cried\u201d is cut a little bit closer to the standard slow grooving yet rocking nature of songs off the \u201cHeaven And Hell\u201d album such as \u201cLady Evil\u201d and \u201cLonely Is The Word\u201d. \u201cShadow Of The Wind\u201d represents the punishingly slow aspect of the band that was really emphasized on slower songs present on \u201cDehumanizer\u201d, though in a bit more of a spooky character as heard on the Tony Martin fronted album \u201cCross Purposes\u201d. \u201cEar In The Wall\u201d is where the band sort of steps away from the modern character of their 90s sound, except in terms of production, and presents a catchy up tempo riff monster that sounds a bit closer to Dio\u2019s work in the past few albums since \u201cMagica\u201d, but with a darker character. Basically each of them have a uniqueness that sets them apart from past works, yet retains the familiarity necessary to be immediately associated with this franchise.\n\nInsofar as the second way that this album is to be judged, which is as a greatest songs collection, a slightly flawed picture emerges. Although there was never really a weak song to be heard out of any of the albums in congress on here, this does suffer for the lack of inclusion of several, making one wonder how this would listen with a couple of substitutions. As fun as \u201cLonely Is The Word\u201d is for those of us who long drawn out guitar solos, this compilation was a missed opportunity to include one of this band\u2019s most underrated and definitely essential songs \u201cWishing Well\u201d, which would showcase the band in a much more animated and varied light. Likewise, although \u201cVoodoo\u201d has a really fun main riff, the absence of the classic slow paced epic \u201cSign Of The Southern Cross\u201d is felt, in spite of the near equally great and lesser known rival of said song \u201cFalling Off The Edge Of The World\u201d has made it onto here, which was quite surprising. And as far as the \u201cDehumanizer\u201d collection is concerned, my favorite song \u201cComputer God\u201d was passed up in favor of the slower and slightly less interesting \u201cAfter All (The Dead)\u201d, missing an opportunity once again to offer an epic alternative to what largely appears as a modern yet bare bones collection of songs from a very multifaceted album.\n\nIn spite of these slight disappointments that sort of bring down the power of the whole release, this is a well put together compilation. The approach to track ordering and pacing is well realized, avoiding the abrupt jolts in style that often occur in grab-bag oriented collections of pre-released material. This is basically what Megadeth\u2019s \u201cCapitol Punishment\u201d could have been if that band had been as stylistically consistent as their older forefathers here have been and had put more effort into writing the accompanying new material. This is the only Dio era Sabbath compilation that is essential, if for no other reason in that the new songs on here blow everything that this band has done since 1994 completely out of the water.\n\nOriginally submitted to (www.metal-observer.com) on May 8, 2009.\n",
        "\nWith the exception of the solitary single from the brief Glenn Hughes interlude that this band had a few years prior, this is the closest Sabbath ever got to morphing into a glam rock outfit, although the album that it came off of was anything but that style of music. It really has little to do with the various parts, but rather how the sum is presented in this particular single. The principle clean section during the verses are a somewhat simplified version of Iommi\u2019s various ballad riffs in the vain of \u201cChildren Of The Sea\u201d, \u201cNightwing\u201d, and even a bit of the intro to \u201cAnno Mundi\u201d. Likewise, the chorus riff is vintage fair Sabbath of the sort that you might have heard on anything in the Dio or earlier Martin albums, with maybe a tinge of the mid 70s portion of the Ozzy era.\n\nThe principle reason why this might come off as a hair band power ballad is almost entirely due to the sappy plotline of the music video, which is all but a direct homage to Whitesnake, but with somewhat of a more philosophical sense to it and a cynicism that was nowhere to be found in Coverdale\u2019s various personal odes to his supermodel significant other. However, things are helped along quite significantly by the intro guitar solo being slashed out along with a bit of the second solo too. What ordinarily would be a fairly drawn out affair with Iommi developing a good set of lead ideas turns into a straightforward rock ballad with some lead guitar window dressing, which is basically what every Aerosmith ballad since the 80s has amounted to.\n\nThe silver lining to this though, as well as the real reason why anyone would want to track this down is the live version of \u201cParanoid\u201d. This is one of very few instances where Tony Martin is able to outdo Ronnie Dio, as the latter\u2019s interpretation of the Ozzy era classic has always sounded a little too theatrical and not as twisted as it should. The guitar solo has been altered pretty significantly to account for Tony Iommi\u2019s more technical lead approach at this juncture. But the kicker of the whole thing is that amazing finale where the reprise the intro to \u201cHeaven And Hell\u201d, and spend about a minute riling up the audience before finally ending the thing. I think at one point Cozy Powell actually starts banging a giant tam-tam in between doing the free time drum ad lib on his kit.\n\nSince the release of \u201cBlack Sabbath \u2013 In Moscow\u201d about 6 months ago, this has basically become obsolete for anyone who has a European compatible DVD player. But until it becomes available here in the states, my fellow American metal maniacs might want to think twice about passing this up if they see it in a bargain basket somewhere. It\u2019s probably worth about $5 at the most, but it is something that you can\u2019t really get anywhere else at the time being.\n\nOriginally submitted to (www.metal-observer.com) on May 8, 2009.\n",
        "\nIt was with utmost surprise that I happened upon this very strange compilation selling for a meager 50 cents at the local bargain bin. This was mostly because I had no idea of its existence, in spite of me regularly visiting the band\u2019s back catalog to be on the look out for cash grabbing best of releases to avoid. But in spite of the peculiarly random looking track ordering, I decided to rescue this poor thing from a life stuck in the equivalent of a Bangkok orphanage for albums and give it a whirl to see what would happen.\n\nIt is very important to stress that to someone who owns an entire studio discography of a band, in spite of the current craze of mp3s and playlists, a compilation that contains nothing but album tracks from studio releases only serves a listener well if the experience of hearing these songs in the provided order is a good one. It is in this respect that this completely fails, as it listens like it was thrown together in the same manner that one would when drawing at a raffle. You need look no further than the jolting transition from the epic masterpiece of woeful fatalism \u201cSabbath Bloody Sabbath\u201d to the good times with harmonicas and the blues in \u201cThe Wizard\u201d, or the free flowing jam fest \u201cWheels Of Confusion\u201d to the angst ridden rocker \u201cParanoid\u201d. There\u2019s no accounting for pacing here, let alone the massive differentiation in production practices from one album to the next, as underscored by when hearing songs from \u201cVol. 4\u201d sitting side by side with ones from \u201cParanoid\u201d.\n\nNaturally if looked at from the angel of a person who owns nothing by Sabbath, there is a pretty good sampling of songs from the band\u2019s first 6 albums, which are rightly regarded as classics. But \u201cWe Sold Our Souls For Rock And Roll\u201d does the same job and with a much more consistent flow. There are some songs on here that can\u2019t be found on that compilation, but considering the number of underrated classics from \u201cSabbath Bloody Sabbath\u201d and \u201cSabotage\u201d that could have made it on here aside from what is presented, particularly with songs such as \u201cLaguna Sunrise\u201d and \u201cHole In The Sky\u201d, which are lower on the ladder than most of the songs on those two albums, this isn\u2019t something that could qualify as an essential purchase. The songs are good, but this compilation isn\u2019t worth more than $1 at best.\n\nOriginally submitted to (www.metal-observer.com) on May 8, 2009.\n",
        "\nI can't believe this album is rated lower than Technical Ecstasy! Surely. I thought, people have more brains than to slough off this album as further evidence of Ozzy's decline and Sabbath's as well. I find this album to not only redeem the grotesque mistep of Technical Ecstasy but offers a view into a Sabbath that almost was. The band all play in top form, in ways they never had before, the album sounds livelier and fuller than its predecessor and it's still relegated to metal history's dustbin of record prejudice.\n\nSabbath doesn't get a lot of credit for being a progressive band. Indeed, held up against the legions of bands that invoke the famous Sabbath sound (the doom/stoner, downtuned guitar style so ubiquitous today) and without radioplay, Black Sabbath's true masterpieces go largely unnoticed. Songs like Fluff and Laguna Sunrise are the polar opposites of doom-and-gloom works like Into The Void or Electric Funeral and show that they were more than just a metal band or \"The Godfathers of Doom\". Black Sabbath albums progressed from lengthy blues-inspired jams to the infamous doom-sound until we reach Volume 4 and the creative lid is blown open. Here, they reached their peak sound, sort of like Opeth from MAYH through Blackwater Park. These albums saw more orchestration, an increased presence of keyboards and a very much matured sense of songcraft. The right combinations of life experience and drugs, basically. \n\nAfter Sabotage, came the aforementioned crapfest known as Technical Ecstasy which coupled with the We Sold Out Souls best of, seemed to signal the downfall of the mighty. Ozzy was in and out of reality and Sabbath a lot these days and as the drama surrounding these times is well known, I think Never Say Die gets a bum rap. At first listen, it's a noticably different Sabbath that eschews its trademark stoner/doom sound for a lot of jazz, a little latin and some late 70s hard rock. There is a common theme of buildup and payoff in these songs with good riffs often giving way to great riffs like the breakdown in Johnny Blade or the money riff in Shock Wave. Never Say Die is a nonstop swinging rock song whilst A Hard Road is a blues paced rollicking sing-a-long. \n\nSabbath came full circle on this album as Never Say Die sports the most jazz influence since the self titled debut. Junior's Eyes' bass and drum fade in sound culled from some live jam, like something you'd here between songs. An earlier version of this song (performed with Dave Walker of Fleetwood Mac on vocals during on of Ozzy's breaks) goes straight into the heavy riffing and features a much more pronounced blues-rock influence. Air Dance is IMO Sabbath's most progressive song since Who Are You but in even more extremity. The first part of the song has a Santana vibe with the only distortion being Tony's latin-jazz inspired licks. The second half, after a quiet interlude breaks into a solo section you'd expect to hear from a fusion group like Return to Forever or Weather Report. Over To You features lush, cascading pianos, both underlying and accenting key sections. Breakout is bold and with the brass arrangement calls to my mind an extended G.E. Smith & the SNL Band jam during commercials.\n\nThe only weak moment on the album is Swinging the Chain. Its a good song, yet unremarkable and coupled with the lack of Ozzy, no small wonder it's the last song. Leaving out on a blues-rock jam we say goodbye to one of the greatest bands in music's history. Had they kept it together, there's no telling what Sabbath could have done, expanding on the template they set up on Never Say Die. Instead, we got Randy Rhoads and the long reign of King Ozzy (79-95), while Sabbath shined briefly with Dio and sank into the mire. I love the s/t and I feel that Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath is their masterpiece but this is probably the album I listen to the most.\n",
        "\nWith their albums becoming increasingly weaker with each successive attempts and their last tour featuring a supporting act called Van Halen that blew them out of the water, Black Sabbath was a metal dinosaur on the verge of extinction. And when they were forced to kick out frontman Ozzy Osbourne, well that appeared to be pretty much it. But then one of those unprecedented, magic moments occurred and ex-Rainbow vocalist Ronnie James Dio (whose career needed a bit of saving itself) was recruited as Ozzy\u2019s replacement. The result was an absolute about-face in the band\u2019s sound and popularity and one of the best metal albums ever released by Dio, Sabbath, or most anyone else for that matter.\n\nI can\u2019t say for sure if the remaining Sabbath members came up with the sound on Heaven and Hell all on their own, if Dio had a direct hand in writing the music, or if it was simply a natural evolution with Dio\u2019s strong melodic vocals as catalyst, but one thing is unquestionably apparent: the sound was brand new for Black Sabbath and essentially updated the band for the new decade. While the later Ozzy-era Sabbath records leaned heavily upon progressive rock territory (without ever actually stumbling into it), Heaven and Hell is both a steadfast return to heavy metal and an almost complete departure from their doomy past. \n\nSome have described the sound as NWOBHM, and while I lean more towards the proto-power metal explanation, there are plenty of moments here to support the former. The quicker tracks (\u201cNeon Knights,\u201d \u201cDie Young\u201d) are closely relatable to the early works of Iron Maiden (listen to Geezer Butler\u2019s bass on the latter). The addition of Dio\u2019s melodicism and experience working with Ritchie Blackmore\u2019s Rainbow add a certain \u2018catchy\u2019 element to the band\u2019s sound, something that was not entirely lacking on the Ozzy stuff, but was far less explicit. This is a good thing, as plainer numbers like \u201cLady Evil\u201d and \u201cWishing Well\u201d shine on like diamonds anyway, thanks to Dio\u2019s excellent voice. Tony\u2019s riffwork is just as efficient as ever, but it is his leadwork that really profits from this new melodic edge. Geezer is Geezer, so there are no worries about the bass guitar presence being anything except magnificent. Similarly, Bill Ward is Bill Ward, though his playing is not as heavy or as frantic as on early albums. Indeed, with the frequent keyboard accompaniments, Heaven and Hell is not as heavy as the early Sabbath records, but it flourishes nonetheless because of the flawless musicianship you\u2019d expect from Sabbath, the powerful vocals and intriguing fantasy lyrics you\u2019d come to expect from Dio, and the excellent songwriting that, prior to this record\u2019s release, I don\u2019t think anyone was quite expecting from the unlikely pairing.\n\nMuch of the record consists of the straightforward, catchy metal anthems like \u201cWalk Away\u201d (which actually borders on hard rock) with the occasional speedier number. However 3/4 of this band was present for the recording of immense, atmospheric heavy metal like that which is found on Master of Reality and Black Sabbath Volume 4, so it is to be expected that they will achieve sublimity when playing at slower tempos. Nowhere is this more comprehensible than on the title track and writing a review for this album without dedicating a reasonable portion of words to the praise of that masterpiece would be criminally negligent. Can perfect be an understatement? From the immense opening riff (the second coming of \u201cSnowblind\u201d), through the bass-driven atmospheric verses, to that awesome post-chorus vocal thing, to the heavenly guitar solo, to the hellish, climactic speed section, to that somber classical acoustic bit that, while it officially ends the track, far from concludes the purposefully ambiguous tale Dio spins before it, \u201cHeaven and Hell\u201d is one of metal\u2019s timeless anthems. The power of Dio\u2019s voice is well suited to a track like this, while sort-of member Geoff Nichols provides the perfect keyboard compliment. Ideas developed here would resurface on the group\u2019s next effort to similar (but not quite equal) effect, as well as on Dio\u2019s own solo material with cheaper \u201cHeaven and Hell\u201d knock-offs like \u201cThe Last in Line.\u201d\n\nHowever the title track is not the only track with an emphasis on atmosphere. \u201cChildren of the Sea\u201d is also pretty impressive, based off a nice clean riff and featuring one of Dio\u2019s more emotional performances. The chorus reminds me of \u201cImagine,\u201d but the track is not weakened because of it. Other notable departures include the bluesy \u201cLonely is the Word,\u201d particularly the outro bit of it, and the interlude part of \u201cDie Young\u201d (once again, thanks to Geoff Nichols for his undercredited role as keyboardist on this and many other Sabbath albums).\n\nIf you don\u2019t own this record already, you\u2019re missing out on one of the best classic heavy metal experiences there is. It is so well-crafted and accessible that even if you\u2019re a diehard Ozzy-era fan, you\u2019ll have no hang-ups with the new vocals and different sound delivered by this lineup. And yet, it\u2019s deep enough that you\u2019ll find your artistic elitist happily listening to the album right next to your weekend headbanger. Enough said.\n",
        "\nI don't really need to write this do I ? Well...... maybe I do . Every single person that defines themselves as a metal head has heard of Black Sabbath even if they haven't heard their music personally . This IS the heavy metal band that started it all for most people as well as for me . I know there have been endless discussions and debates concerning who the first metal band ever was but let's be realistic here it was and it is Black Sabbath . Everyone has an opinion as to whether it was Led Zeppelin or Rainbow or I've even heard the most ridiculous of bands mentioned such as Jimi Hendrix or Steppenwolf but like I said \"let's be realistic here\" . Nobody even came close to making such outwardly heavy music at the time that Black Sabbath did . Obviously I am a maniacal Sabbath fan and my opinion on this matter must seem blatantly clear right ? Well in case it needs to be reiterated the undisputed god fathers of heavy metal were ,,, come on,,,,, you guessed it,,,,,, Black Sabbath .\n\nThere is even more debate as to which of their albums should be classified as the beginning of metal or even as to what albums were considered to be the first metal masterpieces . For this metal head the answer would be their first six albums: Black Sabbath, Paranoid, Master of Reality, Volume 4, Sabbath Bloody Sabbath and Sabotage respectively . Now being a previously mentioned die hard Sabbath fan the obvious answer to this question would be their first album Black Sabbath . Don't get me wrong this as well as all of the first six albums were perfect releases in their own right . All contain a wide array of heaviness and beauty that was evident in every release . Sabbath like most 1960's and 1970's bands were influenced heavily by the blues masters of old and up until Master of Reality this influence was peppered throughout their releases . This is in no way a put down to those great albums as they all mean just as much to me as any of those six other releases, it's just that one album in particular has always stood out as the undisputed heavy weight champion of the world in an early discography peppered with undisputed heavy weight champ's, and that album is Master of Reality . This album has just always seemed to me to be such a pure metal record with nothing but the purest form of metal contained with in it's majestic purple and black covered walls . Even the band's presentation of this album just exudes a fuzzed out stoner feel that has not been matched since it's release date in 1971 . Once again let's be realistic here . This ultimate heavy metal album was released in 1971, a million light years away from what we as metal heads would come to know and love as heavy metal . \n\nFrom the second that Tony Iommi is done coughing after taking a hit off of a joint during a studio session that this band was involved in, the listener is immediately blanketed by one of the heaviest of heavy riffs ever thought possible; the opening riff of Sweet Leaf . The thick dank perfect tone of the guitar is one the stuff legends are made of . Almost indescribably perfect, it has, along with all of Sabbath's efforts around this time, defined the sound and tone that changed the face of heavy music . It contains such a warm inviting all encompassing and completely engrossing feel that it has influenced millions of people to call this band what they deserve to be called, GODS . Master of Reality was without question Iommi's greatest triumph in the driving groove filled riff department . Even the hauntingly beautiful tracks \"Embryo\" \"Orchid\" and \"Solitude\" all fit perfectly amongst the masterful songs that are documented on this great album . They come off as a welcome change of pace and add a bit more substance and feeling that this truly amazing record possesses . Every song on this crushing perfect masterpiece is the early soundtrack to any die hard metal heads very essence . Every single riff this album contains almost teases and taunts any metal fan to try and not bang their head while this perfect yes perfect album is playing . The songs on this one Sabbath album flow so perfectly in succession that it almost tells a story, all the while being what cannot be described as anything other than the heavy metal soundtrack to the bible . The riffs are so heavy and so masterfully created that they will always stand the test of time as a masterpiece just like the Mona Lisa or Beethoven's fifth symphony . \n\nGeezer Butler's bass is the perfect companion to the ultimately dominating riff work that this great album displays . The sheer thick deep rich tone of the bass along with Tony Iommi's guitar sound gives this album it's true dripping with bottom-heaviness appeal . It is prominent in every second of every song and has paved the way for countless other bands to follow suit . This is not just merely an album, it is a guide book for those bands that would seek to play any form of heavy music . The bass driven heaviness that Black Sabbath created is in its truest and most purest form on this album . Geezer's accomplishment's besides his song writing abilities are in his perfect instinctual deliverance of his bass lines that round out the unbelievable groovy heavy riffs of Toni Iommi . Simplicity in its most purest heavy metal form, as well as sheer feel and love for all things heavy as well as the strongest available cannabis obtainable, can be the only explanation of the perfect output that is contained on this album . The guitar and bass sound on this very album is nothing less than perfection defined . It is the ultimate heavy metal sound and no one else anywhere, at any time can ever claim that they invented it besides Black Sabbath . \n\nBill Ward's drumming is also the perfect companion to the songs on his album . He is the unrelenting driving force and the ultimate backbone that keeps this album moving so perfectly . His punishing pummeling style forces the issue at hand aggressively down the throats of all that would dare try to not pay attention to\nwhat is being displayed here . He is the ultimate metal drummer on this, not by showing off his talent (although talent he does have) or by being overly technical but instead with utter unhindered go for the throat ferociousness . There is a no holds barred feeling that comes across in every skull crushing moment that he plays . He rides the cymbals and obliterates his drum kit like a man on a mission possessed by every inner demon that has dared to try and torment him . This is most notable on the simply perfect \"Lord of this World\" \"Children of the Grave\" Sweet Leaf\" and \"Into the Void\" although it is evident in every heavy masterpiece on Master of Reality . \n\nNow onto the ultimate metal singer himself, the man, the myth, the legend: Ozzy . Ozzy's vocals from the Black Sabbath days were, to put it simply, the greatest I have ever heard . He is not only the truest metal singer I have ever heard he is the absolute definition of the phrase \"metal singer\" both in feeling and in sound . On this very album his vocal display is nothing short of phenomenal . All of the first six Sabbath albums contain this amazing feel for the music that he had but this one album in particular is his defining moment as the greatest heavy metal singer of all time . His vocals on here are full of unrelenting passion . Whether expressing his undying love for the \"Sweet Leaf\" or sharing his warning to those who would listen of war and the end of times this is his moment and his moment alone to be crowned undisputed king . His very definable voice is undefinable in a single word or phrase . His high shrieking passion is felt throughout the album and makes this perfect album all the more perfect . His vocals are truly loaded with feeling and add that extra greatness that only he could create . \"Lord of this World\" finds him screaming in the beginning of the song \"Your searching for your mind don't know where to start\" and has always encompassed that feeling that he must have lost his mind during this recording to sing so insanely amazing . It is without a doubt obvious that no one else could have even come close to nailing the vocals on this album quite like Ozzy did . They are perfection defined on every listen . \n\nThank whatever you have made the conscious decision to worship in your life that this album was made the way it was . Without it there would be a gaping void in the collections of metal heads everywhere . Make no mistake about it, this is Black Sabbath's greatest achievement in a long list of insurmountable achievements . This one record is the perfect definition of all that can be defined about heavy metal . This output is the first true bastard son of rock and roll and we as metal heads should feel lucky to own it . What ever genre of metal people are fans of, this without a second of doubt obviously influenced them all . I have loved this album since I was seven years old in 1979 . The day I received it has forever changed the history of my life . This album will always be the ultimate output by the true pioneers of metal . Perfect albums like Master of Reality have always, and will always contain a permanent documentation as to the exact reason that I have dedicated my entire existence to living, breathing, eating, sleeping, bleeding, worshiping, and yes one day dying for my true love: heavy metal . ENOUGH SAID........\n",
        "\nThere seems to be an inevitable occurrence in music regarding truly great bands \u2013 before they break up they start to make crap, and after they break up they continue to make crap. Well, that\u2019s what happened to Sabbath during the last few years of the original lineup. Here were four tired, bored, spoiled asses producing what asses produce. Crap. With the exception of a few great songs here and there, the incredible, powerful and magical band that had struck fear and wonder across the land just five years earlier was completely gone. So Ozzy left and the remaining trio recruited a new singer. Here is where it gets interesting.\n\nAgainst all expectations, both Ozzy and Black Sabbath, after going their separate ways, managed to rejuvenate their music and make some of the most memorable, classic recordings of all time, each in their own unique way, capturing the essence of heavy metal. Such is the case with Sabbath and their singer Ronnie James Dio, who produced an opus for the ages, \u201cHeaven and Hell\u201d. \n\nLike the first four classic Sabbath albums with Ozzy, this is not just a record. It\u2019s a friend. \n\nThe first track, the universally acknowledged metal classic \u201cNeon Knights\u201d, showed the band at its finest: tight, fast, powerful, energetic and bonding beautifully with their new singer. Old Sabbath fans were introduced to a new sound. And it was good. I wholeheartedly agree with an earlier review by ChildOfTheSea who describes this record as NWOBHM. It is not old school Sabbath. It is metal for (what was then) a new decade, a new era. And although metal very rapidly evolved into heavier, faster and more aggressive sounds, the root of all evil can be found here. \n\nThe band sounds amazing! All of them. Bill Ward never sounded better, no bullshit, tight and bright and strong. Geezer Butler was brilliant, a great musician, probably the most underrated bass player in all of metal. Listen to those elegant lines in \u201cWishing Well\u201d. Absolutely beautiful. As for Tony Iommi, he is the undisputed riffmeister. Personally I have always been critical of his soloing, which I found rather amateurish, but here he matured a great deal, and his playing never sounded better. As for Dio? Well, yes old Sabbath rules and Ozzy rules, that charismatic lovable lunatic went on to bigger and better things himself. But after all is said and done and all the heads have been counted, Ronnie James Dio is arguably the best heavy metal vocalist of all time. \n\nThere is nothing bad on this album. The songwriting is mature and refined, while managing to retain the aesthetic appeal and the essence of what we love as heavy metal. Many new bands could, and should, go to school with this disc. My favourite track is \u201cChildren of the Sea\u201d. I could listen to this song over and over until I puke, and while I puke I would turn up the volume so I could still listen without missing anything.\n\nIf you\u2019re from the older generation of fans you love this. If you\u2019re among the younger metal fans, make an effort to understand and appreciate this record. Once you do, you will be forever grateful.\n",
        "\nOnce I had gotten into Metal, surprisingly, it took me a long time to get into Black Sabbath with Ozzy on vocals. I was a big fan of de Dio-era and 'Heaven And Hell' is, to this day, one of my favorite all time Metal albums. 'Mob Rules' and 'Dehumanizer' aren't too shabby either. I guess as a great vocals fetishist, Dio has always had more of an impact on me than Ozzy. However, it was with this album that started really getting into the Ozzy-era. 'Sabbath Bloody Sabbath' is - simply put - Black Sabbath's best album with Ozzy on vocals and one of the best Metal albums of all time altogether.\n\nWhat makes this one so much better than 'Paranoid' for me then? Well, first of all, the sound - and especially the guitar sound - has vastly improved over the last few albums. Tony Iommi started improving his guitar sound on 'Master Of Reality' already, but this is really where he got his shit together. This is just about as good as it gets for 1973. Only Ritchie Blackmore equaled this at the time. Who also improved is Ozzy. While still not quite one of the world's greatest singers, he has a lot more power than before here. Not to mention that he sings in key much more often than on the band's previous efforts.\n\nBut most important is the song material. 'Sabbath Bloody Sabbath' is arguably one of the most experimental Black Sabbath-efforts. Of course, 'Vol 4' takes the cake there, but while the band didn't know where to stop experimenting on that album (resulting in utterly horrible tracks such as 'Changes' and 'FX' to drag the average of 'Snowblind', 'Supernaut' and 'Cornucopia' down), only the over-synthesized 'Who Are You' is a true miss on this album, that one really gets on my nerves. Every other experiment here is a successful one. Rick Wakeman's keyboards on the amazing 'Sabbra Cadabra' really add to the Rock 'n' Roll-vibe of the song, the acoustic 'Fluff' is the first truly good instrumental interlude the band has done, there is even a little Folk in 'Looking For Today' and the overall slightly psychedelic edge of this album creates an atmosphere that is irresistable.\n\nDon't let the experimentalism drive you away from this album. The most important ingredient is still Tony Iommi's mighty guitar riffs. The album starts with the crushing main riff of the title track - if the album cover is the visualization of a nightmare, the title track is the \"audiozation\" of it - and almost every song starts with a classic riff. Just like we're used to from Black Sabbath. Of course, Geezer Butler's brilliance is all over the place as well. I just think there's a lot more power on this album, as well as better compositions than ever before.\n\nFavorites include the amazing title track, 'Sabbra Cadabra' and the incredible 'A National Acrobat'. The latter pummels on in a relatively low tempo, but builds up towards new climaxes so brilliantly, that it keeps on getting better and better. Ozzy's vocal lines are also remarkably good on this track. 'Spiral Architect' is a mighty closer with brilliant use of keyboards (a string section is mentioned, but I'm almost positive that it's a mellotron) and 'Killing Yourself To Live' has a brilliant tension that is almost completely new to this band.\n\nAll together, I think that Black Sabbath hasn't ever sounded as inspired as on this album (and its brilliant follow-up 'Sabotage') with Ozzy on vocals. 'Vol 4' was a nice prelude to what was to come, but I don't think anyone at the time could have expected this. Not even the band members themselves, as I understood they were heavily uninspired until they moved into a \"haunted\" castle for the recordings of this one. If that is the case, I'm glad they got there. This is a monumental Metal release. If you call yourself a Metal fan and don't own this, I won't take you seriously. And in deed, that means I wasn't supposed to be taken seriously until I was about 16 as well. That's when I found out the Dio albums weren't the only great Sabbath-albums.\n",
        "\nThe more that I think about it I don\u2019t really think Black Sabbath were that much of an overtly metal band in the 1970s. Sure, to outsiders they are the epitome of doom-and-gloom drugged-up heavy metal and those that idolised them like, say, Electric Wizard stressed this by focusing in on these aspects in a fairly cartoonish manner. But when I really start thinking about Black Sabbath, I see why I find them so subtle, which is an achievement in its own right when playing on ten. They really don\u2019t bang you over the head with the fact that they are heavy metal whilst doing the exact same thing at the same time. Think about it; all the band\u2019s early output is riddled with massively non-metal moments, but this is what makes them so special \u2013 but of course this gets its detractors, the same fellows who think Hamlet would have been better if Junior had knifed Claudius in Act II rather than soliloquising about the nature of truth and the afterlife\u2026 you\u2019re boring us, William! Cut to the fucking metal, Tony! \n\nI can remember exactly where and when I bought Master of Reality \u2013 it was a summer\u2019s day in York and I was stuck outside of my Grandma\u2019s house as the old dear couldn't hear me knocking, this gave me ample time to dwell on those big, quirky letters on the textured cover and the ethereal, woodland band photography and then when she did open the door she noted \u201cBlack Sabbath, ugh!\u201d certainly remembering the moniker from my father\u2019s spottier days and somewhat of an infliction of her massively Catholic leanings, rather than a somewhat out of place Tom G Warrior impression. Of course, not being familiar with \u2018After Forever\u2019 yet I couldn\u2019t exclaim \u201cBut wait, Gran! This song expresses Christian sentiments!\u201d But by this time I\u2019d already decided \u2013 given that this was my third Sabbath album \u2013 that this was going to be the greatest album ever and I don\u2019t really think my Grandmother was going to do much to change that. \n\nMaster of Reality is heavy. Sure, it\u2019s heavier than anything until at least Welcome to Hell but that, again, isn't of great consequence as:\n-The heaviness of this whole thing is secondary to its overwhelming quality \n- I don\u2019t actually think there to be a higher art form that seventies rock.\nYou won\u2019t find a heavier record for 1971, but the main point is you won\u2019t find a better one, either! Given that 1971 was the year of Fireball, IV, Killer, Love it to Death, Who\u2019s Next Split, Aqualung and God knows how many great records outside of rock music, and thus, my collection! Well, The Pentangle released the merely good Reflection, but never mind that. \n\nGiven that Master of Reality was the record in which Iommi burdened with most of the writing \u2013 and the quality really suffers! \u2013 I should probably focus on him for a while. Well then, Ozzy\u2019s vocals here are wonderful! He\u2019s often the focus of much flak, which in my eyes is most unnecessary \u2013 like all great singers he deals with emotions not technique. Think about it, there is a vast array of emotional variation on all the classic Ozzy-era Sabbath records and Ozzy manages to deliver in a manner that happens to work for each and every style. Just on this record you get the contrast between the stay-at-home-get-high anthem, \u2018Sweet Leaf\u2019 and the forlorn, \u2018Solitude\u2019 (a song that is inexplicably subject to a whole lot of \u201cWhat? That\u2019s Ozzy singing?\u201d moments, well, it isn\u2019t fucking Bill Ward, now is it!). \n\nIt is \u2018Solitude\u2019 that I must single out for particular attention and thus praise (see: rating). It\u2019s perhaps the finest Black Sabbath ballad ever and it\u2019s so perfectly understated and sincere. With most rock bands \u2013 and indeed metal bands \u2013 ballads are just attempts at making a single and cracking into a wider audience (which is perhaps what you can accuse \u2018Changes\u2019 of). I mean perhaps old people who don\u2019t like Sabbath may enjoy this, but to call anything it anything other than the very epitome of an album track would be silly. This is something I\u2019ve always valued with Black Sabbath \u2013 listen to their classic albums and they all function as cohesive pieces, hence them making my favourite albums rather than greatest hits tapes I can play in the car on my way to super cool Kings of Leon concerts. \u2018Solitude\u2019 is certainly similar to \u2018Planet Caravan\u2019, as they share the same dreamy, wistful feel but emotionally they\u2019re undoubtedly different. \u2018Planet Caravan\u2019 is one of the more abstract Sabbath songs and as such a typically Butler-esque affair and if anything it\u2019s strangely close to \u2018Into the Void\u2019 in terms of lyrical themes, whereas \u2018Solitude\u2019 is the sound of road-weary band in some distant hotel room just getting high and jamming because there\u2019s nothing else to do. I must note that the cavernous, gently reverberated guitar sound coupled with the swooning flute is just magical and a testament to the band\u2019s astounding versatility. Also of note: those twinkling bells at the end of the song, what are they? A cat on a moonlight stroll inexplicably captured on record? Master of Reality is full of such weird little moments, be it that pig-based-medieval-instrument guitar sound in \u2018Embryo\u2019 or those haunting moans at the end of \u2018Children of the Grave\u2019. Well, given its positioning I\u2019m assuming the \u2018Embryo\u2019 is from whence the \u2018Children of the Grave\u2019 came and their moans are a result of some displeasure at being born into the grave. Reading too much into things? Perhaps. \n\nInterestingly, given the very bleak start to the previous two records, Master of Reality starts off surprisingly cheerfully. \u2018Sweet Leaf\u2019 is by far the happiest of any of the openers on the six classic Ozzy-era albums. Unusual, though perhaps too stoned to be intentional. But the band ensure that this still isn\u2019t quite the Summer of Love as that riff is still rather colossal and one of Iommi\u2019s most instantly recognisable moments. Still, if you want a heavier version I\u2019d recommend the Live At Last version. I do sort of prefer the more downbeat Sabbath drug songs like \u2018Killing Yourself to Live\u2019 and \u2018Hand of Doom\u2019 they have cooler titles and the overall mood of despair is pretty enthralling. But this is Black Sabbath, emotional variation is one of their many fortes \u2013 it may a stoned, happy anthem it\u2019s still a Sabbath anthem. I\u2019m listening to a Black Sabbath album. Black Sabbath. \n\nSo, \u2018Into the Void\u2019 really is the heaviest song ever (I probably say that about three times a week about different songs, but this is always one of them). I actually rather imagine this as a continuation of the lyrical themes of \u2018Solitude\u2019 it makes for a rather amusing narrative:\n1. Man distraught at the loss of his lover \u2013 be it through death or more worldly reasons like his incessant flatulence in the bedroom, for the purposes of this narrative I shall assume the second is the case.\n2. Man is so distraught he doesn\u2019t think he can deal with being alone anymore.\n3. Man\u2019s distress so great that he boards a rocket to the sun. Leaving the world to Satan, his slaves, and his ex. This doesn\u2019t solve his loneliness as such, but he has bigger problems now. \nBut otherwise the song has supernaut, Iommi in ripping form. It\u2019s easy to forget just how progressive this thing was underneath all the throbbing heaviness, especially with that opening riff that sounds like gangly trolls lifting boulders in some far off and distant land in a time before polygamy was a sin. I suppose that lends itself to the feel I\u2019m getting here \u2013 ancient, archaic, but ultimately very heavy. But still, the song is a monumental achievement and I can\u2019t really think of any band that could have done this around the same time \u2013 with possible exception of King Crimson, who could have played something almost this heavy for a brief moment but followed with five minute bongo solos which you could stroke your beard to. Sure, Purple and Zeppelin were heavy, so were a whole spate of second division bands. But even then it was only Black Sabbath who\u2019d dare to be this ominous and fierce. Unashamedly so, meaning that people assume because you\u2019re a Sabbath fan you spend all your time drawing skeletons on your school work, not that you don\u2019t, it\u2019s just you\u2019ve other hobbies, too. \n\nThis review is dedicated to Rancid Teeth Girl of the QMU. I wish you the best of luck with your dentistry degree and may your kisses be as sweet as your tooth! Adieu, my love, adieu!\n",
        "\nThis album marks the beginning of my metal journey, what an unusual place to start! I was 12 years old and this album's artwork caught my eye in a record shop and I basically begged my parents to get it for me. I had no idea who Black Sabbath was, I didn\u2019t know their previous history with Ozzy Osbourne. Believe it or not, there was a brief period of time when I was under the impression Dio was their original vocalist. After repeated listens and thoroughly enjoying what I heard, I eventually tracked down the rest of Black Sabbath\u2019s work and my love for metal grew from there.\n\nOn my first listen, I was completely blown away by the power and majesty of Ronnie's voice over Iommi's sludgy riffs. The songwriting and performance was so good that I didn't even consider recording quality. Listening with much more experienced ears, I can agree with the complaints of muddy sound. Regardless of whether there was tampering on Dio or Iommi's part, this mix is somewhat lackluster. Usually on live albums the crowd noise is turned up and studio enhanced to give the impression of an extremely enthusiastic, sold-out crowd. On Live Evil the audience is so low in the mix they're inaudible even when Dio prompts them to sing along to Heaven and Hell.\n\nDespite the questionable production; band itself turns in solid performances, Vinny Appice does an adequate job of filling in for the ailing Bill Ward. Many Ozzy die-hards have criticized Dio's vocal phrasing and performance of Ozzy Sabbath songs. I personally don't have any problem with Ronnie's interpretations of the classics as I hadn't heard the Ozzy fronted versions at the time. Even today I still consider this rendition of N.I.B. to be particularly strong.\n\nOverall I still enjoy this album, it was an excellent starting point that turned me onto a style of music that I still follow today. I can see where people are coming from when they criticize the production values and I sympathize with those who can't get past the fact Ozzy isn't behind the mic. At the time of my initial purchase and listen; I wasn\u2018t as well versed in metal\u2018s history, I was just incredibly drawn to this powerful form of music. I guess you can only capture the unique magic of being a 12 year old kid who's never heard metal before once.\n",
        "\n\u201cWicked World\u201d is a song featured on the self-titled debut album of Black Sabbath and it is, at least in my opinion, one of the best songs this english act ever crafted, and that's saying something, because Sabbath released lots of fantastic tunes and masterpieces. \u201cWicked World\u201d begins with Ward hitting his hi-hat very softly, until the first riff kicks in and oh my God, this is a fantastic riff. Melodic and memorable as hell, proving that Tony Iommi is one of the best guitarists out there, no doubts about it. Geezer's bass was at the time an essential part of Sabbath's sound; later, after the release of Master of Reality, his bass playing became simpler and less crucial to the whole sound of the band, Tony Iommi assuming the main role. Still, on this song he is essential, with some fantastic bass licks, during the intro and middle section of this track.\n\nThe progressive nature of Black Sabbath isn't usually aborded by the reviewers of this site, but I, as a lover of progressive music in all its forms, can't help but mention it. Black Sabbath never was a simple band, they've always played strange pieces and adopted a rather complex composition approach. \u201cWicked World\u201d proves it yet again, with its different sections. The first two minutes of the track are dominated by a fantastic main riff, memorable as hell. Ozzy comes in later, singing some verses and then Tony Iommi stops playing his lines and all that is left his Ward and his hi-hat and Geezer and his bass guitar. Later, Iommi unleashes some very psychedelic guitar lines in the vein of \u201cPlanet Caravan\u201d, very calm but still revealing the strong psychedelic influences Sabbath carried during the 70's. After it, we reach the solo section, in which Iommi shreds like a madman, the song later returning to the main riff. A rather strange but still awesome Sabbath track.\n\nThe single also contains another tune, the doom metal monster \u201cIron Man\u201d, which is a song that most of you know well, so I won't take much time describing it. The main riff is lovely and so is the middle section and last part, where another frantic guitar riff kicks in. Concluding, a nice single containing two of the best songs of this english act. If you're new to the band and can't afford buying a LP, buy this piece and you'll get a relatively accurate impression of Sabbath's sound.\n\nBest Moments of the CD:\n-the solo part of \u201cWicked World\u201d. \n",
        "\nPast Lives is an excellent live package, containing lots of the most important and proeminent Sabbath tunes ever and guess what, there are also some precious underrated gems scattered through this fine live album. It perfectly captures the energy of this, at the time, young band: Ozzy sounds as energic as ever and all the musicians deliver excellent performances, especially Iommi, who seems to play all his solos flawlessly, and Ward, who, with his sense of rhythm and technical proeficiency, holds the songs together perfectly. Unfortunately, Geezer's bass is a bit low on the mix, but still audible; I just wish it was louder, though.\n\nSo, on to the tunes. The first CD was all recorded live in the same place, during the Volume 4 tour, and the second one compiles some lost live renditions of this english act (the first tracks are from a show in 1975 and the last ones, from \u201cIron Man\u201d to \u201cFairies Wear Boots\u201d, are from the famous concert in Paris, 1970). The first disk is flawlessly produced, everything is perfectly audible, and so is the first half of the second one; unfortunately, the songs recorded in 1970 suffer from some problems, the sound quality is much weaker and at times it's hard to hear the riffs and the drums clearly. A pity, indeed.\n\nThe first CD kicks in with a dynamic rendition of \u201cTomorrow's Dream\u201d, out of Volume 4. There are two other songs of Volume 4 present here, the mighty \u201cSnowblind\u201d, which benefits from the intense vocal performance of Ozzy (I just love when he screams \u201cCocaaaaine!\u201d), and the underrated \u201cCornucopia\u201d, one of those Sabbath tunes one wouldn't expect to be featured on a live album of the band. Other highlights of the first disk include an extended version of \u201cWicked World\u201d, which unfortunately is a bit on the overlong side, and the awesome \u201cChildren of the Grave\u201d, which contains \u201cEmbryo\u201d as its intro.\n\nThe second CD contains some quite somber Sabbath songs, which is, in my books, a plus: tunes like \u201cMegalomania\u201d and \u201cBehind the Wall of Sleep\u201d are constantly overlooked and are far from the \u201chit\u201d status songs like \u201cParanoid\u201d or \u201cIron Man\u201d enjoy. In fact, \u201cMegalomania\u201d is the highlight of this second disk, with a very powerful vocal performance (even though Ozzy can't reach the high notes on some parts). \u201cHole in the Sky\u201d is much better here than on the studio version, also containing a hilarious introduction (\u201care you high? So am I!\u201d). \u201cHand of Doom\u201d is another sadly forgotten Sabbath tune and it is performed here flawlessly, ending with a little \u201cRat Salad\u201d jam. \u201cSymptom of the Universe\u201d is also very well played.\n\nSo, concluding, an excellent live offering by the godfathers of heavy metal: what really brings the album down is the poor sound quality of the last five tracks but, oh well, Black Sabbath's first era is perfectly represent by this record, an excellent piece to get you into the band, no doubts about it.\n\nBest Moments of the CD:\n-\u201dAre you hiiigh? So am I!\u201d\n",
        "\nEvery once in awhile, you\u2019ll find an album that just blows your mind away. Whether it\u2019ll be the crushing riffs or the extreme vocals or whatever, you\u2019ll have your reasons. Now, Black Sabbath has a knack for this, writing masterpieces within a year or a little more between each other. By law, the first 6 Black Sabbath albums are necessary additions to any metalhead\u2019s collection. My third favorite, behind the pot-ridden Master of Reality and the progressive Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, is Black Sabbath Volume 4. The album art is iconic, featuring a colorized picture of Ozzy Osbourne at a concert, and has been copied by many other bands. Like a little bipolar kid on cocaine, the mood on this album fluctuates from sad and depressing to happy and jovial.\n\nBlack Sabbath Vol. 4 is Black Sabbath\u2019s last album that features a mainly doomy feel, at least with their classic, and best, line-up. Volume 4 has a more polished sound and feel than its three predecessors, and it features some of their best songwriting. When you pop in the disc, and you hear the emotionally depressing beginning of Wheels of Confusion/The Straightener, you know that you\u2019re in for a great, moody, and HEAVY experience. As the longest song on the album, it\u2019s one of the most varied songs, with great riffs and, as other reviewers said before me, three apparent parts. The second part starts at around 1:28, and The Straightener at around 5:17. Each of these parts has a heavy sound and wonder riffs (The Straightener highlights Iommi\u2019s soloing skills), but\u2026will it hold its greatness? Indeed- the quality remains excellent, with a few shifts both good and bad.\n\nLet\u2019s just get the bad out of the way- FX is useless. It\u2019s just a bunch of sounds with little meaning. A waste of two minutes, it\u2019s probably best to skip this boring, \u201cexperimental\u201d interlude.\n\nHowever, everything else on this album features quality songwriting, even the somewhat cheesy Changes, which understandably some people detest. It\u2019s a great and depressing soft little ballad for all you cheese lovers (like me). Ozzy\u2019s vocals sound very emotional, and the piano is just excellent. Laguna Sunrise is another beautiful soft song on this album, with some nice acoustic work. Of course, if you\u2019re all for crushing songs and none of this soft crap, you wouldn\u2019t like these either.\n\nThe best track on this album is a fan favorite that focuses on cocaine. Yes, it\u2019s Snowblind, a midpaced song that distinguishes itself from the rest of the album. It is a very depressing classic with great melody. It opens in a very melodic tone, sending chills down your spine. The main riff is just godly, and Ozzy\u2019s vocals are just plain outstanding here. It even features an orchestra, hinting at what will follow in Sabbath Bloody Sabbath. When the track begins to fade, it leaves you wanting more.\n\nThe rest the songs are as heavy as they can come. Supernaut is a great jamming piece and showcases the happy and carefree side of Black Sabbath. The beginning riff is just plain wacky and so damn good. The drumwork on this song is maybe the most memorable on the album, especially at arount 1:38, where there is a crazy drum solo by Ward. Tomorrow\u2019s Dream is another great song featuring some more jamming awesomeness. It also has one of the best melodic parts Black Sabbath has ever made at 1:28, where Ozzy\u2019s vocals will just take you away. Both of these songs are so damn catchy, and you\u2019ll have a very hard time getting it out of your head (but why would you want to do that, in the first place?).\n\nThe beginning of Cornucopia is one of the heaviest moments on this album and is somewhat reminiscent of the beginning of Electric Funeral, on Paranoid. You\u2019d have to lock your head in a vice to prevent yourself from headbanging to it. And St. Vitus Dance begins with an almost country-like riff. It\u2019s not a bad tune, but it is somewhat forgettable, with no huge highlights.\n\nThe album ends with Under the Sun/Every Day Comes and Goes. The opening riff of Under the Sun is so heavy and crushing that it can kill anyone with a heart condition. Bulter\u2019s basslines is most evident and distinct here. It\u2019s the slowest, ugliest, most melancholy song on this album. The riffs are just great here, sometimes doomy, sometimes technical. In the middle of the song, it switches from Under the Sun to Every Day Comes and Goes, then back to Under the Sun. The last part is an excellent ending to this album, filled with what can only be called doom. The main riff is repeated and it gradually slows until it ends in a subtle note.\n\nIn conclusion, Black Sabbath Volume 4 deserves as much lauding as its three predecessors, and features some of Black Sabbath\u2019s best songs. If you find it anywhere, buy it. Do not download it, do not borrow it- buy it. This is a must-have for any fans of metal.\n\nHighlights- Wheels of Confusion/The Straightener, Supernaut, Snowblind, Under the Sun/Every Day Comes and Goes.\n",
        "\nAs a huge Black Sabbath fan I really wanted to love this. I wanted to give it a perfect rating and rant on about how all the haters are wrong, how the Black Purple was awesome and so on and so forth. Unfortunately I can't do that. But that's not saying the album is bad - it's just very very weird.\n\nLet's we take a look at the individual songs, starting with the opening track, \"Trashed\". The first time I heard this, I found it to be utter crap with boring guitar and the really fucking annoying drawn-out parts with \"I was turning / the tires burning / The ground was in my sky\". Then I heard it a second time, and suddenly the track was all fun, and I labeled it one of the good songs of the album. Now I'm caught in between: True, the song has some catchy parts (and Gillans screams are just as awesome as they are with Deep Purple), but overall, the song is nothing special and tend to get plain boring. Also, the lyrics about drunk driving are nothing special, not anywhere near the old-Sabbath material - but then again, apparently Gillan had overtaken the writing from Geezer.\n\nThe next so-called \"track\", \"Stonehenge\", is the same kind of ambient interlude stuff that Iommi back then had decided to put on almost all of the Black Sabbath albums. Admitted, some of the interlude stuff has been good, and this one is really awesome (but then again, I love Burzums \"H\u0142idskj\u00e1lf\", so maybe I'm not that objective), but the \"Stonehenge\"-interlude suffers from one obivious problem: It's too fucking long for an interlude! The ambient niceness cools you down after the ragingly incoherent \"Trashed\", and you can hear the distant heartbeat among the synth, and then - BAM! - it suddenly flings into the next track, \"Disturbing the Priest\", which has a really EVIL intro, that almost scared me the first time. Gillans demented laughs and Iommis weird and slightly atonal guitar never complimented each other better. The actual song sounds a lot like British Steel-era Judas Priest (disturbing the Priest, eh?) with extra Satan. The lyrics are dark, much much darker than the drunk \"Trashed\" - check out \"The force of the devil is the darkness the priest has to face / The force of the night will destroy him but not disgrace / To get into his mind and to his soul you gotta set alight / The flames of doubt so deep inside\". Well... Not pure poetry, but it works fine in this evil atmosphere. Also, the chorus with \"We're disturbing the priest / Won't you come to our feast?\" is pretty good. Towards the end of the song are some screams, and slight elements of soul, that really smells like Deep Purple, and then the evil intro riff comes again and the whole song ends in a demented craze that even Ozzy would have trouble recreating.\n\nFollowing is, surprise, ANOTHER ambient track, \"The Dark\". Well, at least it's very different from \"Stonehenge\": Where \"Stonehenge\" almost got to sound like a full track from some ambient album cut short by the insanity of \"Disturbing the Priest\", \"The Dark\" is just an 45-seconds interlude. Nothing more. It sounds much like the \"E5150\" from the Mob Rules album: A lot of dark wah wah-like effects and, really, nothing else. The only remarkable thing about is is the outro, or maybe more like the intro to the next track: Where \"Disturbing the Priest\" would just barge in at the end of \"Stonehenge\", the fifth song, \"Zero the Hero\", comes sneaking in during the last 5-10 seconds of \"The Dark\" in a really cool manner. It's actually quite fun to sit and listen to the track in order to figure out when \"Zero the Hero\" is coming. \"Zero the Hero\" grows and grows until it completely takes over with it's strange and twisted intro with a strangely shrieking guitar and another guitar doing deep, slow Iommi riffs. Then Gillan start singing something that in some funny way reminds me of rapping. \"Zero the Hero\" is undeniably my favourite track on the album, it hass everything that's good about Black Sabbath: it's dark, gloomy, evil, has cool riffs (4 or 5 of them), a solo that gets to sound all twisted in the musically disturbing atmosphere created. Yep, the track has a lot of atmosphere, from the constant buzzing from the guitar buried somewhere under the bass in the mix, to the way the keyboard \"The Dark\"-like effects that return close to the outro, to the way the guitar coughs a bit here and there. The lyrics are nothing special, though. Or, well, they are special, VERY special - Gillan was almost certainly tripping on something when he wrote them. Lines like \"You're going so fast you're never ever gonna get down there / where the heroes sit by the river / with a magic in their music as they eat raw liver\" really make you wish Gillan would put down the pipe, or perhaps hand the writing duties to someone else. The chorus, however, is damn catchy, and I've had it spinning around in my head for several weeks, which annoys me greatly. If you only had to get one track from this album, make sure it's this one!\n\nNo more interludes! Unfortunately, that doesn't mean better songs - quite the opposite: The next track \"Digital Bitch\" plain sucks. It's apparently some sort of song dissin' Sharon Arden (the later Sharon Osbourne), but that doesn't help the song in any way. Right from the start the too-high-pitched screaming guitar annoys you with it's presence, and continues to do so as it rambles on throwing random solos here and there without ever truly making sense. The song is as fast-paced as \"Trashed\", but has several more detractors: as mentioned, the guitar totally destroys the song, while the lyrics perform the killing blow - Gillans voice can't change the fact that the lyrics are simply bad, not to mention way too personal. All in all, this is one of those songs that the band should have fooled around with, but let remain on the demo tapes! How the hell this got past production is a mystery to me.\n\nFollowing the fast, chaotic \"Digital Bitch\" is the title track, \"Bor(i)n(g) Again\". Here, the band ventures into new terrain: a power ballad! The guitar provides some sad, wailing tones while Gillan mourningly sings about some bleak subjects that I really haven't figured out yet. The only real change is in the chorus, where we get a bit of the ol' distorted guitar to remind us that this is still supposed to be a heavy metal record. Even though the last couple of \"Booooooooooooooooooooooornnn agaiiiiiiinnnn, you'll be booooooooooorn again\" are okay, and the guitar solo is quite good, this has one problem: It's not what Black Sabbath should do! I keep expecting to hear \"I Don't Wanna Miss A Thing\" in this song. Guys, leave the whining to Aerosmith, and get rocking!\n\nThe next track is \"Hot Line\". Right off the bat you get to let out a sigh of relief, because we're out of the power ballad territory. Instead, this is plain rocking. And by \"plain\" I really mean \"plain\": There's nothing special whatsoever about this song, it's just a decent rock song with decent rock lyrics, and a solo where Iommi goes nuts - yes, he can play fast if he wants to! But, except for the solo, the guitar really doesn't do that much here - just a couple of boring rock riffs. This is a prime example of the fact that Black Sabbath, too, can make filler material.\n\nThe last track, \"Keep It Warm\" starts out with some promisingly heavy guitar and Gillans vocals going all bluesy. Then the chorus, a nice sounding, sing-along friendly chorus. Gillan continues on his almost spoken-word-like blues singing in the second verse, another chorus and then: guitar. The guitar solo starts off in a pretty wailing way, but then suddenly halfway through, it speeds up and gets even more awesome - only to speed down again, and throw Gillan back in the ring to continue singing the chorus ad nauseam. A love blues song, and a nice and safe way to finish off one of the strangest albums in the history of Black Sabbath.\n\nLooking back, this album, named the Ugly Duckling of the Black Sabbath records, is actually a pretty diverse album: It covers a lot of ground from the fast heavy metal of \"Trashed\" and \"Digital Bitch\" over the rocking \"Hot Line\" and bluesy \"Keep It Warm\" to the pounding heavy and evil \"Disturbing the Priest\" and \"Zero the Hero\" and the somewhat weak power ballad \"Born Again\". Throw in the two interludes and you have rock-solid proof to show to anyone who would tell you that \"all Black Sabbath sound like the same\".\nComparing Gillan to his predecessor Dio, as well as his successor Martin would not be entirely fair as both of those had a better production (and neither of them were stoned). Speaking of production, the production of Born Again has been bashed by many, but it's really not that bad. Sure, it can sound a little muddy at times, but to call it a major detractor would be to overreact (but then again, I listen to Darkthrone - compared to that, this is a stellar production!).\n\nRocks:\n+ Iommi's still got it: Many awesome guitar solos.\n+ Gillans screams in \"Disturbing the Priest\"\n+ The doomy, gloomy depths of Zero the Hero.\n\n- \"Digital Bitch\" is annoying and hurts my ears!\n- \"Born Again\" gets too slow towards the end.\n- The production may sound a bit muddy to some.\n\nBottom line: If you buy this, don't expect the Second Coming of Dio or Ozzy. Expect a very strange experience, which may be appealing or appalling.\n",
        "\nThis DVD is a re-edition of an old VHS documentary released in 1991, which related the history of the band on their most successful and legendary days, from their early years on late 60's to the lost of Ozzy Osbourne in late 70's.\n\n\nWe all know that Black Sabbath are the godfathers of heavy metal, so having this invaluable document released on this format is something really great. The digital menus are excellently worked and fit perfectly with Sabbath's music and imagery. We have a gallery of the band's albums from this period with their artwork and tracklisting, and direct links to the musical videos of some songs. Also, as an extra feature for this DVD, we have an interview with the band's early manager Jim Simpson, from the days when they were still called Earth and also Black Sabbath's early days.\n\n\nNow, speaking about the movie, it's a great documentary featuring interviews with Tony Iommi and Geezer Butler, and some other musical videos from this era. It's curious the absence of Ozzy Osbourne... The first surprise is the inclusion of (too) short excerpts from the band's early demos, Song for Jim and The Rebel. Also, we have two crushing metal anthems from their gig in the Olympia theatre in Paris (1970), N.I.B. and War Pigs, which has different lyrics, this time dealing with witches instead of politicians. A weird version of Paranoid, recorded for Belgium's TV in 1970, can be taken as a raritie, because it's nothing that interesting. Of course, Black Sabbath's adventure in 1974's California Jam (where they played with Deep Purple and Jethro Tull) is registered here with an amazing live version of the classic Children of the Grave (from their best album, Master of Reality). We also have other live recordings, this time from a British gig: the stomping drug anthem Snowblind and the (rather thrasher) Symptom of the Universe, one of the heavier songs made by this band. The \"strange\" music video from Sabbath Bloody Sabbath is another raritite, and luckily for Sabbath (and humanity in general), MTV wasn't created yet...\n\n\nThe three last songs are only for die hard fans: Rock N Roll Doctor, It's Alright (with Bill Ward on the vocals) and Never Say Die. Never Say Die earned some respect when some speed metal acts like Megadeth and Overkill covered them (because it really goes with their metal), but the other ones had nothing to do with Sabbath. Made me remember some pop metal acts, instead of the heavy doom metal developed previously by the band.\n\n\nThis DVD re-edition is great for all those who saw the original VHS and wanted to have it but couldn't buy it, and for everyone interested in metal's history in general. Reccomended.\n",
        "\nOf all the Black Sabbath material I have seen, heard, or experienced in my lifetime of experiencing Black Sabbath videos, cds, clips, etc. this video has to be my favorite. I prefer the Dio years to the Ozzy years, but the reason why I love this video so much is due to the attention given to Bill Ward and Geezer Butler - Geezer in the interviews, and Bill Ward in the video clips and segments. You can really get a feel for both of their playing and for their immense musical prowess (as if that was ever an issue). In short, this video exemplifies the two members of the band that, in my opinion get the smallest amount of attention yet deserve the greatest amount of attention. \n\nThere is some truly golden footage here. The conceptual video for \"Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath\" is hilarious due to Ozzy's facial expressing during cutaway segments of the video. Also, Ozzy's dancing in War Pigs is also worth seeing for the laugh but as comedic as the videos are, it is important to remember that this video is as much of a sociological and historical account of the early Sabbath years and the culture at that time as it is a documentation of Sabbath's early material. I do laugh at times at the video, its hard not to sometimes with Ozzy's stage clothing seemingly borrowed from the nearest hippy-cowboy store - at times I wouldn't be surprised to see Geezer or Iommi or Ozzy riding a tie-die pony onto stage - though the magnitude of each song presented always makes me stifle my laughter and bow down to such masterful progenitors. \n\nAmongst the classic footage of War Pigs and the unbelievably classic footage of Paranoid are videos of Bill Ward singing solo accompanied by Geezer Butler on bass (It's Alright) and a decisively rock and roll song way different from what we are normally used to hearing from the Birmingham godfathers (Rock N Roll Doctor). These two songs reveal a much more expansive and varied ability on the part of Black Sabbath. Though Iommi has always had a certain talent for the blues - most evident on the debut - Rock N Roll Doctor shows him in top form years later. \n\nThe quality of the videos is excellent. The sound quality on each song is strong. None of the videos are bootleg recordings or difficult to hear. \"Children of the Grave\" gets my vote for poorest quality though the footage is incredible. A sea of fans, elated to see the band shot from the back of the stage above the drums occupies a large portion of the video though my favorite shot is of Ozzy removing his tasseled shirt and throwing it into the audience - it makes me wonder if that shirt still exists somewhere, a fragment of musical history lost to the years. \n\nBetween each of the ten tracks are interviews with Iommi and Butler which provide context and anecdotes for the songs, moments in time, and Black Sabbath story. These interviews show both men in as professionals artists and, most importantly, simple good friends.\n",
        "\nPretty similar to its predecessor, \u201cMob Rules\u201d is the second album released during Black Sabbath's 'Dio era'. As I've already said, all the tunes are pretty similar to the ones that were released on \u201cHeaven and Hell\u201d, but they are a tad weaker, in my opinion; the album is a bit on the inconsistent side, unfortunately.\n\nEverything that made \u201cHeaven and Hell\u201d what it was is here too: the powerful guitar work, the catchy riffs, the inspired vocals, the audible bass and the solid drumming. The songs are generally midpaced but they can contain, at times, pretty fast parts (see the opener, \u201cTurn Up the Night\u201d). Dio is in perfect shape, his screams being awesome and his melodic singing too (check out \u201cThe Sign of the Southern Cross\u201d). Worth mentioning is also the inclusion of Vinnie Appice into the band, after the departure of Bill Ward: his performance here isn't that technical nor complex, but still tasteful. As for the bass, it is actually much more audible on \u201cMob Rules\u201d than on \u201cHeaven and Hell\u201d, which is obviously a good thing.\n\nAs for the guitar work, it is the most important thing about this record (together with Dio's vocals, of course): Tony Iommi is, and will always be, the leader of the band and his riffs on this piece are all pretty damn good. His solos aren't that present throughout the record, \u201cHeaven and Hell\u201d contained much more songs with longer solo sections, but hey, that's a minor issue, all in all.\n\nReturning to \u201cThe Sign of the Southern Cross\u201d, it is the natural sucessor of \u201cHeaven and Hell\u201d as the long, epic song of the album, and while it is very catchy and solid, the latter is better. It begins very calmly, with some acoustic lines, accompanied by Dio's melodic vocal approach, the song then getting heavier after the mighty, crushing main riff kicks in. A great song, all in all, but it can't be compared to the greatness of \u201cH&H\u201d.\n\nLooking to the other songs, there are two immediate stand-outs: \u201cTurn Up the Night\u201d and the title track, since they both are two of the faster songs Black Sabbath ever penned. They kind of remind of power metal at times, which is pretty surprising, since this band is generally labeled as one of the fathers of the doom metal movement. While \u201cTurn Up the Night\u201d may be faster, it still doesn't beat the opener of \u201cHeaven and Hell\u201d though, the fantastic \u201cNeon Knights\u201d. As for the title track, it simply is an awesome song, great main riff and vocals; the chorus is also extremely well written and catchy as hell. One of my favourite Black Sabbath tunes sung by Dio.\n\nOther highlights include the more midpaced \u201cCountry Girl\u201d, with that amazing chorus (like \u201cHeaven and Hell\u201d, the majority of the choruses of this record absolutely kick ass), and \u201cVoodoo\u201d (again, great chorus). \u201cOver and Over\u201d is the closer and can be labeled as the 'ballad' of the album; despite it isn't a masterpiece, it is certainly better than the calm closer of \u201cH&H, \u201cLonely is the Word\u201d. \u201cSlipping Away\u201d is unfortunately weaker and very forgettable, the same thing going for \u201cFalling Off the Edge of the World\u201d. There's also an interlude present, before the title track, a pretty worthless one I've got to say. It is also overlong, which kind of reminds me of the infamous \u201cFX\u201d...\n\nSo, concluding, another good Sabbath album, this one a bit weaker than its predecessors but still a pleasant listening. Recommended to all those who liked \u201cHeaven and Hell\u201d; it's basically the same thing, even though the songs are, unfortunately, a tad weaker.\n\nBest Moments of the CD:\n-the chorus of \u201cCountry Girl\u201d.\n-the beginning of the title track.\n",
        "\nI'm something of a latecomer to Black Sabbath. To be sure, I 'grew up' on heavy metal, but Sabbath were never one of the bands that I took a liking to; my tastes inclined more towards Uriah Heep and Blue \u00d6yster Cult. This isn't to say that I rejected them, but rather I felt that perhaps early Sabbath were too much akin to Led Zeppelin - a band for which I have very little love - for my liking.\n\nMy thinking in this area has changed in recent years, owing mostly to my exposure to the later entries in the Sabbath category. As a rule I prefer those records which tend towards the more experimental end of the metal spectrum from this band; for example, I prefer Sabbath Bloody Sabbath and  Sabotage to their 'classic quadrilogy' of the eponymous debut, Paranoid, Master of Reality and Volume 4. Again, this isn't to say that I dislike those early entries, but rather that there is little in the music I can readily identify with.\n\nNot so with this album. As I mentioned above, I wasn't reared on Sabbath, and so I don't have a particular dog in the fight between various line-ups and manifestations of this band. For what it's worth, however, I prefer Dio to Ozzy and Gillian, and Tony Martin to all of them, as heretical as that may be. And it is this album with Martin which marks one of the high-water points of Sabbath's career, a plateau mached only by the aforementioned progressive metal epics and the later Dehumanizer. \n\nThings kick off in a big way with the mystic opening riff of \"The Shining\", and at once it's apparent that Iommi is continuing to refine the melodic techniques he began on Seventh Star. Unlike that album, however, this record refuses to denigrate into pop-metal fare, and instead seems to synthesize the harmonic strains of the preceding record with the more standard doomish Sabbath material of years before. This is most apparent in the incredibly riffy second cut, \"Ancient Warrior\", which possesses the same tonal qualities as the material from Mob Rules but with a far superior production. The blues influence made famous in the band's early days returns on \"Hard Life To Love\", and it is with this track that Martin proves himself every bit a match for Dio, transitioning from melodic wails to a soulful croon with ease. \"Glory Ride\" features a powerful galloping bassline and more and evocative vocals by Martin, as well as a stomping mid-eighties break halfway through the song, but might be too 'happy' for the 'serious' metalhead. The following track, \"Born To Lose\", is probably the fastest on the record, but nothing ever seems to go beyond a comfortable and fairly atmospheric mid-pace. This track also features one of the best vocal lines ever written by this band, and includes some excellent bluesy riffage that hearkens back to the earlier years of the band.\n\nLyrically, the band seem a bit more mature here than elsewhere, and this seems to be a trend that would continue throughout the Martin years until Forbidden. While there's still the typical quasi-Satanic lyrical themes, they're handled with a bit more panache here than in several of the previous releases, and Martin helps to carry them to a level which might otherwise not be achieved. The rest of the band is as on top of their game as ever, and Iommi seems to have gotten somewhat more comfortable in his role as de facto leader of the band. One slight issue I had with the record was the drumming; Eric Singer has never been great, and occasionally it seems that he cannot keep the pace with Iommi.\n\nThe rest of the album follows suit, and, while there's not a great deal of diversity here, that's not really what one expects from Black Sabbath. While this isn't the best album by this line-up - that would be the following record, Headless Cross, one of the finest examples of melodic doom metal ever recorded - it's nevertheless one of the best ever laid down by this band, and, fanboy purism aside, is almost better than most of the material they recorded with Ozzy. It's unfortunate that this same line-up would go on to record the awful Forbidden, but that, as one says, is the way the Sabbath crumbled. Recommended, especially for fans of early power metal.\n\nStandout tracks: \"The Shining\", \"Ancient Warrior\", \"Born To Lose\", \"Lost Forever\"\n\nOriginally posted on The Metal Crypt.\n",
        "\nYes, \u201cVol.4\u201d absolutely represents a turning point of Black Sabbath's career: before the release of this record, the band was getting heavier and heavier and reaching the pinnacle that \u201cMaster of Reality\u201d was, they had to search for another directions and styles. The result is a very very heavy album (at least as heavy as its predecessor, that's for sure), but featuring clear and innovative progressive elements, since the songs are all very varied, following distinct structures. If you look to the song lenghts you may conclude that the songs CAN'T be that complex, but the truth is that they are short but pretty complex, you see? The band adopted an even more progressive sound later with \u201cSabbath Bloody Sabbath\u201d and then with the absolute proto-prog metal opus \u201cSabotage\u201d.\n\nAs I've already said, the heaviness is still an important characteristic of \u201cVol.4\u201d, with all the tunes also being quite slow. This is a reason why so many people claim this album to be one of the doomier Sabbath efforts, and I can't help but agree with that. Not only all the tracks are, as I've already said, pretty slow, but also the atmosphere that surrounds you when listening this record is absolutely EVIL. Indeed, Sabbath always produced very obscure music and this opus follows the same path. Only \u201cSt. Vitus Dance\u201d is an exception, being a quite \u201chappy\u201d-sounding track, with that catchy main riff and vocals. \u201cUnder the Sun/Every Day Comes and Goes\u201d is like the other side of the coin, carrying a very dark vibe, thanks to those awesome riffs, courtesy of the always inspired Tony Iommi.\n\nAs \u201cParanoid\u201d or \u201cMaster of Reality\u201d, \u201cVol.4\u201d is another extremely guitar-driven album, the riffs playin a very important role indeed. It's not easy to produce midpaced/slow music, you got to really have good riffs, solos and songwriting to entertain the listener, and Black Sabbath absolutely nail that. The drumming is very proeminent, much more proeminent on this album than on its predecessor, and that's a good thing at the end of the day, because Bill Ward sounds awesome here, with his aggressive beats and fills (example: \u201cEvery Day Comes and Goes\u201d). Geezer's bass is unfortunately a bit low in the mix and Ozzy's performance is pretty competent, all in all.\n\n\u201cVol. 4\u201d also has a notorious melodic edge, mainly with the presence of the ballad \u201cChanges\u201d. It's a very different and distinctive ballad, if you compare it to the first two ones Sabbath ever composed: \u201cSolitude\u201d, on \u201cMaster of Reality\u201d, and \u201cPlanet Caravan\u201d, on \u201cParanoid\u201d. While the first one is very focused on the gentle vocals and on the mellow guitar work and the second on its dreamy vibe, \u201cChanges\u201d differs, with the piano assuming the main role. Unfortunately, and despite carrying a otherwise strong chorus, the track is very repetitive (when I say repetitive, I really mean repetitive... think \u201cSt. Anger\u201d), with the vocal and piano lines being far too similar to work. The sublime \u201cSnowblind\u201d is another example of the melodic elements \u201cVol. 4\u201d contains, the song slowly building up in the middle section, leading us to a fantastic and heartfelt solo, one of the best Tony Iommi ever played. One of the highlights of the album, no doubts about it.\n\nOn other hand, the melody is also present on some of the other heavier tracks of the album: the last segment of \u201cUnder the Sun/Every Day Comes and Goes\u201d is an example, and so is the beginning and ending of the opener \u201cWheels of Confusion/The Straightener\u201d. The two songs are also two of the most complex tracks of the album, and you can easily recognize that, since both are divided in separate movements. \u201cWheels of Confusion/The Straightener\u201d is the longest track of the album, and it sounds like the mixture of three separate and distinct tracks. All the movements are very different, but the transitions are excellent, mind you. It begins with a very bluesy and emotional solo, then going through varied heavy sections, and ending with a marvelous outro, filled with excellent guitar solos, all of them extremely melodic. \u201cUnder the Sun/Every Day Comes and Goes\u201d is also pretty exquisite and uncommon on a songwriting level, the song being pretty heavy all the way through, but containing at least three different segments, each one highlighted with a different riff. The best part of it is, again, the last part, with that beautiful riff, God, Tony Iommi is amazing at creating riffs.\n\n\n\u201cSupernaut\u201d is another example of why Tony Iommi is so good, its main riff being one of my favourites ever (my all-time favourite is the first one on \u201cA National Acrobat\u201d, which is THE perfect riff, but this one is damn close). Its middle section is pretty good too, with those strange guitar, piano (?) lines and drum lines. \u201cTomorrow's Dream\u201d is a catchy tune, with some more amazing riffs, even though it is actually weaker than the ones I've already mentioned. \u201cCornucopia\u201d is a bit on the forgettable side though, and so is \u201cLaguna Sunrise\u201d, the obligatory acoustic number that, unfortunately, doesn't go anywhere, even though it contains some really beautiful lines. At least it's shorter than the boring \u201cFluff\u201d, of the \u201cSabbath Bloody Sabbath\u201d album, so that's something. Finally, \u201cFX\u201d is the weakest tune, by far, being another POINTLESS interlude filled with strange sounds. Absolutely worthless indeed.\n\nSo, another Sabbath classic, even though it's a tad weaker than its three predecessors. Despite its doomy vibe, mainly represented by the heaviness and slowness of the songs, this album also shows the Sabs exploring and using constantly more and more progressive elements which would lead the band, later, to release, like I've already said, the extremely complex and ambitious \u201cSabotage\u201d. There are some killer songs here, but, unfortunately, tracks like \u201cChanges\u201d of the infamous \u201cFX\u201d harm the whole listening experience. Worth listening at the end of the day, though, especially if you like the three predecessors of \u201cVol.4\u201d and also, why not, its two sucessors.\n\nBest Moments of the CD:\n-the beginning of \u201cWheels of Confusion\u201d.\n-the melodic last segment on \u201cEvery Day Comes and Goes\u201d.\n-the first time the main riff of \u201cSupernaut\u201d is played.\n",
        "\nThe third Black Sabbath record is widely regarded as a classic and is also one of the heaviest albums of the band's long catalogue. Here we have Black Sabbath showing an emphasis on slower songs, an approach that the band repeated with the next record, \u201cVolume 4\u201d.\n\nWell, and the question is: is \u201cMaster of Reality\u201d a good album? Yes, it is, no doubts about it. It's incredible how a band could release three top notch albums in two mere years, but, I tell you, Sabbath did it. While not being a long record (\u201cMaster of Reality\u201d contains six songs and two interludes, with the total playing time being, roughly, 35 minutes), it is a very cohesive and strong piece, all the songs flowing well together and sounding fresh. Sadly, \u201cMaster of Reality\u201d is often despised by the majority of the people, who constantly say that \u201cParanoid\u201d is the \u201cbe-all, end-all\u201d of Sabbath's catalogue. How wrong they are, indeed...\n\nMoving on, every musician sounds pretty inspired here. The guitar is obviously the most important instrument of this album; Tony Iommi dominates everything here with his amazing riffs really shining. Almost every riff is, indeed, very catchy and heavier than the ones featured on the band's past records. So, we can find here Iommi's riffs in their heaviest form, that's for sure, even though \u201cVolume 4\u201d also has a couple of interesting heavy ones. He doesn't solo as frequently as on \u201cParanoid\u201d but the solos still play an important role on the majority of the songs. Ozzy Osbourne delivers a competent performance, with his unique voice, even though he isn't, technically speaking, the best singer out there.\n\nAs for the rhytmic department, Geezer Butler's bass guitar isn't as audible as in the past, unfortunately, but is still there. I miss songs like \u201cWicked World\u201d or \u201cN.I.B.\u201d though, with their big emphasis on the bass lines, but heh, it's not a big issue at the end of the day. As for Bill Ward he delivers, like on the previous albums, another excellent performance. His fills are, at times, pretty fast here (check out the middle segment of \u201cSweet Leaf\u201d) and the beats are all very well composed and fit the music very very well. He also shows some restraint, not destroying the tunes with exaggerated fills or something, so that's a clear plus in my books.\n\nThe songwriting is obviously top notch, Black Sabbath is one of the best bands out there in that field. Almost every track is pretty catchy (the choruses are very well written), from \u201cChildren of the Grave\u201d to \u201cSolitude\u201d there are always some hooks present. The middle sections of the majority of the tunes are also filled with decently long instrumental sections, filled with nice riffs and solos. With the inclusion of the two instrumental interludes (\u201cEmbryo\u201d and \u201cOrchid\u201d) and the ballad \u201cSolitude\u201d, the record also becomes pretty varied, which makes up for a richer listening experience.\n\nSo, highlights? \u201cChildren of the Grave\u201d probably is the best tune of the bunch, being one of the faster songs too. Great crescendo and intro, leading us to great heavier segment, filled with dynamic drumming and nice riffs. \u201cSolitude\u201d is another one, a pretty underrated track if you ask me, great atmosphere and vocals. \u201cLord of this World\u201d is a bit weaker but still great, with its fantastic chorus, and \u201cInto the Void\u201d is another monster of heaviness, even containig a little thrashy part on it. \u201cSweet Leaf\u201d is a bit on the average side, though, and so is \u201cAfter Forever\u201d, the (pretty forgettable) second track.\n\nConcluding, another great album by the metal gods; a very consistent and original piece, and also one of the heaviest Black Sabbath records ever. Absolutely recommended to every metalhead out there.\n\nBest Moments of the CD:\n\u201cI love you... Oh you know it!\u201d\nthe thrashy segment on \u201cInto the Void\u201d.\nThe intro of \u201cChildren of the Grave\u201d.\n\n\u201cLord of this world! Evil possessor!\u201d...\n",
        "\nAfter releasing some rather weak records and losing Ozzy Osbourne, Black Sabbath surprised everyone, releasing the very good\u201cHeaven and Hell\u201d, an album featuring the amazing Ronnie James Dio on vocals. The first thing you got to know about this album is that it isn't a traditional Black Sabbath album. If you are expecting \u201cHeaven and Hell\u201d to be a skull-crushing, heavy and doomy record, better search for other things. \u201cHeaven and Hell\u201d is different than \u201cParanoid\u201d and different than, say, \u201cMaster of Reality\u201d.\n\nFirst of all, while the guitar riffs are still heavy, they are played faster, giving to the album a more true heavy metal sound. Check out riffs like the main one on \u201cNeon Knights\u201d or \u201cLady Evil\u201d and you will understand it. The drumming is simple, even giving to this album a strange AC/DC flavour, since Bill Ward seriously overuses the \u201ckick-snare-kick-snare\u201d beat. The bass is audible and provides an extra groove to the majority of the songs. \n\nAbout the vocals... Dio is the main responsible for the drastic change of the band's sound, first of all because he is a singer that can do almost everything with his voice (Ozzy isn't, you know), delivering some beautiful vocals on \u201cChildren of Sea\u201d and, most of all, on the beginning of \u201cDie Young\u201d and sounding pretty aggressive on songs like \u201cNeon Knights\u201d. He also wrote the majority of the lyrics, so they are also extremely different from the traditional Sabbath ones (the ones dealing with evil, Satan, etc). This time, they mainly deal with fantasy, even giving to this album a strange proto-power metal sound, since the bands of that genre generally write all their lyrics about fantasy and such.\n\nThe opener \u201cNeon Knights\u201d represents the new sound of Sabbath perfectly, being a relatively fast song, filled with an unforgettable chorus and some simple yet effective, straight-forward drumming. In fact, this isn't the only song that carries a catchy chorus; the catchiness is, indeed, one of the main characteristics of \u201cHeaven and Hell\u201d, which is a very varied record too. Even though the majority of the songs is straight forward, there are two \u201cballads\u201d/calmer songs here to be found: \u201cChildren of the Sea\u201d and \u201cLonely is the Word\u201d.\n\nAnyways, highlights? The afore mentioned \u201cNeon Knights\u201d is a clear winner, of course. \u201cChildren of the Sea\u201d, a song that resulted from the first jam Black Sabbath ever made with Ronnie Dio, is another great song, the \u201cgreen\u201d lyrics fantastically interpreted by an inspired Dio. Got to love that ending too (\u201clook out!!\u201d). \u201cDie Young\u201d is the best track of the album though, that keyboard beginning (even reminiscent of Pink Floyd's \u201cShine on you Crazy Diamond\u201d) accompanied by the fantastic Dio... Awesome! Then the song explodes and Iommi unleashes one of his crushing riffs, ahhh, perfect! \u201cLady Evil\u201d is another song that I like, especially because of the goofy lyrics, apparently Lady Evil is a \u201cmagical woman, the queen of the night, who can freeze where you stand!\u201d. Hell yeah, cheesy power metal lyrics + Black Sabbath = win!\n\nHowever, one of the mysteries of metal, at least for me, is how the title track is so praised out there. It surely is a classic, a kick-ass song, but it isn't the \u201cmagnificient, amazing, awesome, beautiful, masterpiece of a tune\u201d that many people say it is. A strong song, nevertheless. \nThe only songs that harm the whole listening experience are the last two, at least they sound a bit uninspired for me. Without them, I would give this album some more points, but meh, I'll have to remove some because of them. I like the long guitar solo of \u201cLonely is the Word\u201d though.\n\nSo, a catchy and heavy album by the metal godfathers. That's right, Dio really brought a fresh sound to this band, it's a shame that he had to left the band after \u201cMob Rules\u201d (a pretty good record too). The good thing is that he is right now reunited with Black Sabbath and they are planning to release an album this year (at least that's what Dio said).\n\nBest moments of the CD:\n-the last part of \u201cHeaven and Hell\u201d.\n-the beginning of \u201cDie Young\u201d.\n",
        "\nWith \u2018Born Again\u2019 Sabbath\u2019s career entered the realms of Salvador Dal\u00ed, things got really bizarre. The only rational explanation for this album was indeed the actual reason for its inception; Geezer, Tony and Ian got pissed as newts in the Dog and Bollock, and then decided;\nBlack Sabbath + Deep Purple= \u2018Machine Head\u2019 and \u2018Master of Reality\u2019 times infinity! \nWell, not quite. But \u2018Born Again\u2019 was one hell of a hangover and what exactly do you do when you get drunk? Wear a lampshade as a hat, kiss un-shapely women, direct traffic and converse with trees, exactly, perfectly normal. Ian \u2018flash bastard\u2019 Gillan goes and joins Black Fucking Sabbath\u2026some people have all the luck, aw well, bet he doesn\u2019t have a redwood, oak and a pine as acquaintances.\n\nEven twenty-five years on, some people have difficulty with \u2018Born Again\u2019, with tracks called \u2018Stonehenge\u2019, ridiculous stage props and being, well, a Black Sabbath album. Johnny Rock Press will no doubt compare this strange brew to Spinal Tap. Indeed, \u2018Born Again\u2019 is often considered quite the shit sandwich of Sabbath albums. But to these ears at least, \u2018Born Again\u2019 is something quite splendid, a musical marriage between two of rock\u2019s heaviest giants\u2026but being a showbiz marriage it didn\u2019t last long. Still, \u2018Born Again\u2019 to those who \u201cget it\u201d is a true cult classic and the epitome of an oddity. \n\nSounds great eh? Well, not as such. \u2018Born Again\u2019 is a superb album and strange enough to keep the most ardent Sabbath nerd, i.e. me (although, I\u2019m sure Dio would call me a Neon Knight or something), occupied for hours\u2026much like a jigsaw of Tony Martin getting fired by phone. But it doesn\u2019t sound great; the production is about as clear as the sea at sunny Scarborough! Apparently according to Gillan, the album sounded fantastic until a certain bass player (Jo Burt? Gordon Copley? Who could it be?) decided he didn\u2019t find the bass sound to his liking and then fucked up the mix to the point where we get, \u2018Born Again: A Bass Players Production!\u2019 Unsurprisingly, the bass still sounds fine, but we get Iommi\u2019s muddiest sound ever and Bill Ward gets the dreaded 80\u2019s snare sound. But if the production is too much for you to handle there\u2019s a bootleg available on the interweb or in the Black Sabbath rarities section of local library that has the album in much clearer, albeit raw form. Actually, I find this strange murky dated sound has given \u2018Born Again\u2019 even more of its quirky drunken charm and truly \u201cfuck off, \u2018Paranoid\u2019 only fans\u201d and \u201cfuck you, Dio only fans\u201d vibe as \u2018Born Again\u2019 is truly for the tried and tested, dyed in wool Sabbath faithful\u2026we are those who dream of what Tony Iommi had for breakfast in 1993, buy bootlegs but still wonder what they sounded like at the next gig and know the name of Tony Martin\u2019s orthodontist!\n\n\u2018Trashed\u2019 gets things off to a roaring good start. It\u2019s dafter than the last stop on a pub crawl and aptly enough, its lyrical theme suits its inherent daftness, Gillan\u2019s drunken exploits in Bill Ward\u2019s new car which he flipped and sent into a man-made lake, indeed, the bitch was trashed. Musically, it\u2019s a twisted take on \u2018Highway Star\u2019, whereas the old Purple classic was the sound of a precise automobile speeding down a German autobahn, \u2018Trashed\u2019 is more of a lumbering speed metal song, not so much precise engineering as the sonic equivalent of a bloke, on the wrong side of thirteen pints of Cider with a Madras burning in his lap, driving down winding rural roads with a blithe, devil-may-care attitude. The song also functions as a introduction to Gillan\u2019s vocal histrionics combined with the Sabbath full-throttle roar, if you don\u2019t like this peculiar mix, you\u2019re certainly in for an uneasy thirty five minutes! \n\n\u2018Disturbing the Priest\u2019 is one of the most unique songs the band have done and all the better for it. Atmospherically heavy, it\u2019s a clear continuation of the \u201cSongs wot scare people\u201d theme, with the;\n\u2018You just gotta listen to the night at the ending of the day\u2026\u2019 section being spooky, with a deft touch of homemade Englishness\u2026you know, paper m\u00e2ch\u00e9 zombies and what not. To the detractors of this album it could come across as somewhat of a pastiche of the genre with its stop-start riffs and harmonics (sounds like a precursor to nu-metal, fret not, it isn\u2019t), but I can\u2019t help but be enthralled in this spooky, hazy kitsch. Lyrically, the song can be taken quite literally; the Sabs were blasting away in rehearsals that disturbed a local priest in his daily duties of molestation, penance and exorcisms, so he asked the Sabbath boys to turn it down. Gillan being the agreeable and friendly chap he is (unlike that Blackmore\u2026cor wot a twat) met the clergyman over a drink and as such the song takes a more universal tone on the nature of religion. It\u2019s certainly a interesting listen and shows Gillan adopting an approach that is more in keeping with Sabbath that his more down to earth past. \n\n\u2018Zero the Hero\u2019 shows a simple almost obvious layering of ideas; it\u2019s not rocket science but by God is it heavy with the skulking main riff, a dramatic tri-tone and a bent squealing note. This once again proves why Tony Iommi is the quintessential metal guitarist, it\u2019s his unadorned ideas executed with intensity and conviction. The main riff itself is a monolithic slab of creeping sludge, this is one of the moments where the production actually works in the albums favour, the unbridled heaviness of the main riff is emphasised by the sludgy murky production. It\u2019s a similar effect that Venom had on \u2018Black Metal\u2019, albeit this time it\u2019s less intentional. Geoff Nicholls\u2019 eerie, phantasmal keyboards really shine on this one. \u2018Digital Bitch\u2019 is a fun little rocker and yes, they rhymed bitch with rich. Musically it\u2019s probably the most clear-cut track the band had done since \u2018Paranoid\u2019. The chorus reminds me of punk rock staple \u2018Blitzkrieg Bop\u2019\u2026by um Green Day\u2026 as they do share the same root, 4th, 5th chord progression played to a very similar rhythm. Interestingly enough, this is the first of two anti-Arden songs Sabbath did, the \u2018Digital Bitch\u2019 being Sharon Arden herself. I refuse to call her Osbourne, as she is not married to Ozzy so much as enslaved him in some sort of capitalistic relationship, Sharon keeps Ozzy alive and famous for the price of his soul and the spawning, clothing and feeding of what can be only deemed grey and plastic retards \u2013 bloated troglodyte figures that bear little resemblance to the once beautiful man of John Osbourne. \u2018Digital Bitch\u2019 is one of the albums modest tracks, but again it had no great aspirations other than rocking and warning of the she-devil that is Sharon \u2018ZOG\u2019 Arden. \n\nThe title track itself is again something extraordinary from Sabbath, a power ballad in the truest sense of the term. Gillan really soars in the chorus, his vocals here may not be quite as staggering as the holy trinity of Purple albums were a decade before, but still something quite astounding, especially the way those unearthly banshee wails are harmonised. Again, the ropey production can be seen as working to this songs advantage the murky phased guitar sound gives a sense of undeniable pathos and heightens the poignancy of Gillan\u2019s introspective lyrics. Although somewhat introspective they do have an open-ended quality for the listener to interpret for instance:\n\u2018Look at the prince of evil, fighting for his life\u2019 for me could be seen as a comment on Bill Ward, a prince of evil, as one of the original Sabbath members. Although those who know Bill know he\u2019s far from evil but rather a lovely, caring man (this is all from second hand sources, I haven\u2019t had the pleasure of meeting any of Sabbath\u2019s plethora of members). But indeed, Bill\u2019s alcoholism had left him in a desperate state, with his mental well being exacerbated by the fact he was living somewhat of a lie still playing in Sabbath without his best friend Ozzy. A funny yet tragic anecdote of this was that Tony; proud of Bill\u2019s six months of sobriety, went to get him a plaque. Upon return, Tony found Bill had panicked and got himself drunk. But again, these lyrics are completely open to the listener\u2019s own meaning, to someone else they could mean simply that Count Duckula is a sweet cartoon\u2026 which, if my childhood memory serves me right, it is. \n\nAs you\u2019ll have noticed I haven\u2019t really made many comparisons to Sabbath\u2019s other albums, that because \u2018Born Again\u2019 is a complete curio to the Sabbath canon and as such rather incompatible to say the Dio and Ozzy eras which preceded it or the Martin era. Especially compared to the power metal friendly Dio albums \u2018Born Again\u2019 comes across as a particularly filthy and brash album lacking the finesse of \u2018Heaven and Hell\u2019 and \u2018Mob Rules\u2019, but again that\u2019s right up my street. \u2018Born Again\u2019 is a situation strangely reminiscent to Mot\u00f6rhead\u2019s \u2018Another Perfect Day\u2019. A heavy metal stalwart takes aboard a high profile member to replace a fan favourite with musically fascinating results which have been misinterpreted by critics for decades as some great failure, when in fact a great deal of the bands fan base love these albums in all their bizarre, unique quirkiness. If sales alone were anything to go by one could suggest \u2018Born Again\u2019 went down well with fans, as it was the band\u2019s biggest seller since 1975\u2019s \u2018Sabotage\u2019. Which is a testament to \u2018Born Again\u2019 and its resounding quality as back in \u201983 it would have taken two people to get this onto the turntable\u2026 yes, it is that heavy!\n\n\u2018Born Again\u2019 is somewhat of the ugly duckling of Sabbath albums and to some is about as appealing as actually birthing that impish baby on the sleeve\u2026 but in full Sabbath fanboy form I fucking love it. Again, if anyone\u2019s keeping track this was a far superior product to Ozzy\u2019s \u2018Bark at the Moon\u2019 (3 \u2013 0 already!) and the artwork is garishly fantastic!\n",
        "\nThis is the album that truly put Black Sabbath in the map. Despite the fantastic debut, people just began to look at them with this piece. Anyways, the influence and different elements that Paranoid carries it incredible. Almost EVERY metal sub-genre was born thanks to this record and why? Because of its variety. This record isn't unidimensional; it is a dynamic piece, containing lots of different things, every one of them blended together with the fantastic songwriting abilities of the band. Anyways, let's move on.\n\nTony Iommi obviously is the leader and the most important member of Black Sabbath. The majority of the times you aren't able to choose who is the most important member of this or that band - Dream Theater illustrates this point, since at least THREE virtuosos play on that band. But with Black Sabbath it's another story... The crushing, heavy riffs and the solos play the most important role in the band's sound. Paranoid is a perfect example of this fact. Where would be this record without the killer riffs on Iron Man or the fast ones on Paranoid (title track). Taking the latter, that tune is the most famous track Sabbath ever recorded, being an early speed metal take, working for Sabbath as Communication Breakdown worked for Led Zeppelin (or Highway Star worked for Deep Purple). But there's something that makes Paranoid different from every fast song recorded at this time, by any band: the HEAVINESS.\n\nWhile Deep Purple can be considered an extremely heavy band, with In Rock's Speed King being an authentic anthem of proto-metal, you can't deny that they still had too much classic rock and blues elements to be considered a true early heavy metal act. The same thing goes to Led Zeppelin, a band that explored too many musical genres to even be named as one of the acts that created heavy metal. So, why is Sabbath so different of those two bands? Because of the riffs. Take a Jimmy Page riff and take a Iommi one and you will see. While Page may have created some catchy riffs, he failed at keeping them heavy; Tony Iommi joins catchiness with heaviness, a perfect mixture that put Black Sabbath in a higher level than all the other heavy rock bands of the time.\nTake Iron Man, for example. It begins with Ward hitting the bass drum and then, after a slightly comic \u201cI am Iron Maaan\u201d, the song reaches a bone-crushing section, where that legendary guitar riff is played. Just the dark atmosphere that the song carries is mindblowing. Then, there is a fantastic break around the 3 minutes mark, where Iommi begins to play one of his trademarks solos, it is amazing. Just name a band that, in 1970, released something as heavy as this... Yeah, I know, no one released something like this by 1970.\n\nIron Man also shows another distinctive characteristic of the band: the strange vocals delivered by Ozzy Osbourne. He is not a Ian Gillan, but his voice is so \u201cmetal\u201d, you know? While not being technically great, the guy knows how to sing in a way that perfectly fits the doomy music that surrounds him. Unfortunately, he now is an authentic self-parody, with all those crappy solo albums released and with his soul now belonging to MTV. Sad but true.\nAnother track that benefits with Ozzy's voice is Hand of Doom. Oh boy, and is this track good... Like the name implies, this is probably the first true doom metal song ever recorded, mixing the slow elements that marked the band's debut with some really \u201cevil\u201d parts, where Ozzy and Geezer Butler share the highlights: the first one whispering, in a very (again) \u201cevil\u201d way and the latter plays some nice, mysterious bass lines. Hell, even the lyrics, which are related to drugs, recall today's doom metal.\n\nThe strange structure of this song (with a perfect mix of calm, slower parts, with faster and heavier ones) brings me to the next point: unexpectedly, Paranoid is incredibly progressive. In fact Black Sabbath would experiment more with progression later on (with albums like Sabbath Bloody Sabbath or Sabotage). Anyways, this fact just shows that this album influenced yet another genre: progressive metal. Almost every song shows some kind of progression, from the strange intro and tempo changes of Jack the Stripper/Fairies Wear Boots to the solo parts of Electric Funeral, from the breaks of Iron Man to... well, the whole War Pigs/Luke's Wall song. Yes, this one has got to be among early progressive metal classics: it begins with slow drums and a crushing guitar riff, accompanied by some interesting bass lines but you'll only find the brilliance of this track almost 6 minutes into it, when the song starts to progress to a faster part, which is called, I guess, Luke's Wall. One of the highlights of the record, undoubtedly.\n\nRemember that I called this record varied? Yes, it is varied, and why? Simple: Planet Caravan, a strange atmospheric ballad that is very, very interesting, providing a good break after the metal attack given by the title track and the opener. Ozzy uses a strange microphone that distorts his voice during this track but, in the end, it sounds great (I guess that the band thought that he wasn't the right vocalist to sing a ballad, since, after distorting his voice on Paranoid's Planet Caravan, he wasn't allowed to sing Master of Reality's soft song, Solitude). Iommi plays an interesting acoustic solo and everything is kept together by Bill Ward's percussion.\nPersonally, I consider Bill Ward to be one of the most original, creative and, at the same time, underrated drummer ever. He has a strange style, mixing the irreverent, straight forward drumming of the typical rock drummers with some jazz/blues influenced lines (check out Fairies Wear Boots) and, in this end, this mixture works pretty well. Rat Salad is absolutely dominated by him, with all those drum solos and fills (Led Zeppelin would later rip-off this Sabbath idea, with Moby Dick \u2013 anyways, Bill Ward is better than Bonzo, everybody knows it). It's a shame he is so underrated. The same thing goes to Butler, a wonderful bassist that is AUDIBLE (*party*) most of the times, providing the right base for the other musicians to shine.\n\nAs for the other songs... Electric Funeral is a personal favourite, got to love that part where someone begins to say \u201cElectric Funeral... Electric Funeral... Electric Funeral...\u201d. Jack the Stripper (a part that, I guess, is related to the intro of the song)/Fairies Wear Boots is another good song, featuring some nice lyrics, speaking about how the band was attacked by a group of skinheads. Ozzy and Ward deliver a good performance, but, again, it's Tony Iommi who steals the show with all those fantastic and catchy riffs. What a guitar player, indeed. About the production, it is quite good if you bear in mind when this album was released.\n\nConcluding, this is one of my personal favourite records ever, very varied and carrying a lot of different elements (progressive, doom, speed, heavy metal, blues elements), which is a thing that I personally value. Anyways, there are some low points, like the title track, which, however being very influential, is a rather forgettable song, almost a filler. Plus, this isn't a record that I can listen to everyday, I have to be with the right mood but hey, this is a groundbreaking piece and essential to every one, especially to fans of metal in general. One of my favourites albums ever, probably the most consistent Sabbath record I have ever heard, too.\n\nBest Moments of the CD:\n-the build-up of Iron Man and all its riffs.\n-\u201cElectric Funeral... Electric Funeral... Electric Funeral...\u201d\n-the faster parts of Hand of Doom.\n",
        "\nAfter Sabbath's unholy trinity of the early 1970's, in the form of their first three albums, the band stopped producing hits and instead focused more on creative and personal ingeniousness that was inexplicably absent on the first three. Volume 4 began the trend but lacked certain things to make it a great record, the same goes for this album. The only Ozzy era Sabbath album that could truly be called a 'masterpiece' is Sabotage, but that is another review. Pointing out the negatives about this album would be unfair, not to mention it would only be a few words, so lets look at the positives.\n\nThe first brilliant thing about the album is it's cover, after the previous three dreadful ones we have this demoniacally illustrated picture of demons torturing a man in a bed depicting the number of the beast. May seem dated to those now but for the first twenty years people seen this they were either amazed or shocked, which is the genius of the band, the cut and dry way the band go about this. Here you will not find simple rehashed attempts at the bands debut, or songs glorifying the genre of 'metal'. Instead we have strong political and religious opinions sung with conviction with heavy masterful riffs. Heart-warming instrumentals, eerie psychedelic songs, classically influenced orchestration, all the great things that were absent on the bands supposedly 'better' albums.\n\nWe begin with the title track and from it's opening riff to the clapping on the end of Spiral Architect, we hear Sabbath as both heavy and mighty and soft and finesse. Poetic and straightforward, sleazy and humbled. Sabbath Bloody Sabbath's lyrics deal with the evil of mankind, and how unless a higher powered hand is involved, that evil will never end. Since the suggestion is that evil is never ending and it begins with the first track, while the final track has the word Spiral in it, it is safe to assume the band was trying to formulate a concept here. That highly believable distinction is the albums only shining flaw, as Sabbath was not at that stage yet(see the next album). And while that may seem unfair the blame could only be placed on Ozzy as his vocals are, while improved over early albums, still very one-dimensional and the diversity needed to make a concept album is not there. But with that exception this is a fine album that continued Sabbath's string of highly influential albums that shaped the world of Heavy Metal as we know it.\n\nOne of the brilliant things about this album, which began on Volume 4 and culminated on Sabotage, was the fact that the songs were grabbing and strong for different reasons. In the past the songs were in your face because of Tony Iommi's guitar and little else, and while there is nothing wrong with that, the material did seem to be waning. Here the songs are special and great because of the sonic experimentation, with the slight polka intro to Spiral Architect, classically influenced Fluff or the Pink Floyd influenced Who Are You. The experimentation may not be for everybody and some even claim it to dilute the established sound of Sabbath but after listening to the boring Paranoid, Master Of Reality albums, one must wonder if the band would have died had they never experimented.\n\nWhile there is no reason to go through the songs, as they are all equally great, with the exception Looking For Today, I must praise the best song on the album, Spiral Architect.\n\nQuestion: Hey can Sabbath do anything different than just Metal and have it not be extreme like a ballad, such as Changes or She's Gone?\nAnswer: Spiral Architect. This is the one area of the album that no one ever seen coming, Sabbath playing a song unlike them, with extra instruments unlike any that fit inside their genre?\n\nBeginning acoustically with a polka feel Tony plays a jazzy arrangement with synthesizers and violins to fill out the sound. Suddenly forty five seconds in the light and happy guitar comes in, joined by Bill Ward's pulsating hi-hat rides, the comes the crashing power chords. Oh the light and shade is magical. The riff repeats itself before segueing into the first verse where Ozzy sings with extraordinary power and buoyancy. The chorus' is not soft but not heavy either, instead placing the emphasis on Ozzy's harmonized vocals and the eerie violins, then comes that infectious main riff and hi-hat majesticism. The entire formula repeats itself setting you up for the intoxicating middle section that is short on heaviness and long on violins, coming across as dreamy and almost spiritual. Yes people this is heavenly bliss and it's delivered by a supposed Satanic band. The formula returns for a final time and extended chorus where Ozzy practically cries, 'You know that I should' three times and then that ending. The climax is the highlight of the entire album, orgasmic and lush, close your eyes and you can picture a conductor signaling that crescendo to his orchestra which the musicians execute flawlessly. Such a perfect song and the perfect way to end what some call 'Sabbath's experimental album', perhaps it would fitting.\n\nIn the end Sabotage is better but if your looking for the best Ozzy era material after that album this is where you look.\n",
        "\nAfter releasing a string of great albums, yet changing and shifting within each year, Black Sabbath continued to grow as musicians and expand on their creation that is heavy metal. Sabotage in an album that proved that Black Sabbath were some of the most innovative musicians in history. On a personal note, this author's taste in music was rooted very early on with many songs on this album.\n\nSabbath, being a band known for putting the \"heavy\" and/or \"doom\" in metal, certainly did that on this album. But, as per usual, the approach had some twists on this album as it did on every album they've done up to this (and even beyond today). The album kicks off with the more upbeat \"Hole in the Sky\". Right away, this song gives you the goods, and delivers one of the most CLASSIC Sabbath riffs ever. Along with riff-father Tony Iommi, Geezer Buttler pounds away with groovy bass line that keeps the song in motion. Bill Ward plays in an interesting way with Bill Ward, as he follows but puts his own spin on things. And of course, Ozzy delivers his classic nasal performance but it works with Sabbath's evil persona.\n\nSo it's pretty obvious that the riffs here rule already after the first song. If that's not enough, \"Symptom of the Universe\" is the third track on this album, and delivers one of the quickest Sabbath riffs to date that proves to be absolutely crushing and proves to be a prototype idea for many bands to follow within the years. And just when you think you understand this song, the dynamic group that is Black Sabbath switches into completely different gears and some how manages to make it there logically. Whether it be from drugs, genius, or a combination, they certainly pulled it off flawlessly. \n\nDriven to delusions, \"Megalomia\" hynotises the listener with it's behemoth like pace, as well as in magnitude. This song gets a lot more up beat later on which concludes itself well. Next anthem like \"The Thrill of it All\", which delivers more extraordinary riffs. Not only are the riffs great, but the leads pulled off are brilliant as they are mesmerising. Tony Iommi plays better than most guys with four fingers despite the fact two of his are partly prosthetic. It's truly an awe to hear.\n\nthe cleverly named \"Supertzar\" sounds mythical with it's chants and eeir atmosphere. The riffs certainly sound pretty evil for 1975. It's pretty clear by now that each song has it's own well defined moments that make each song memorable, and thus, something that is timeless. Following the instrumental, a spacey \"Am I Going Insane (Radio)\". This proves to be the weakest point on the album personally, but is still an interesting tracks.\n\nA deep and pulsing bass line leads us to the last track, \"The Writ\", that soon explodes with a mid-paced riff. This song already has the words \"THIS IS LONG\" written all over it, but it's Black Sabbath doing it, so it's guaranteed that it'll be heavy as hell, full of dynamics while still making sense structurally. Subtleties come forth on this song, like demonic sounding vocals that are faintly singing along with Ozzy, that proves to be an enjoyable combination. This song ends of the album quite nicely with it's dark riff that leads us out of the track.\n\nThe production here proves to be a great mix as Tony Iommi's playing sounds distorted with a certain clearness to it that allows listeners to hear each note, and this just shows how flawless of a player he is. The bass is given plenty of room in the production as it proves that the bass has just as much room to move around in the songs in a rhythmic but soulful manner. Each cymbal on Ward's kit sounds warm and resonate well, and the bass and toms all have a great thump. It sounds classic but it sounds so huge at once. Certainly subtleties can come forth in the music too such as keyboards in the background.\n\nThis album proves to be one of Black Sabbath's greatest with Ozzy, and thus one of their greatest in their large discography. It's a stand out record that was as heavy as it was dynamic. This deserves all the praise it gets, and perhaps then some.\n",
        "\nBack when i was at the tender young age of 14, still immersed in the world of 70's hard rock like Queen and Aerosmith, I decided to listen this band i had heard of called Black Sabbath. I was intrigued. Being a member of the newer, more technology-driven generation, I searched for this band on itunes, and I decided to listen to this album called Heaven and Hell. (Being the inexperienced kid I was, i thought that was still Ozzy on vocals...my how far i've come.) The title track basically tore my head off. I listened to this song obsessively. After hearing this, I said to myself, \"hey, this heavy metal stuff is pretty cool, i'm going to listen to more of it.\" And here I am today.\n\n\nNaturally enough, I went on to buy the whole album. The opener, Neon Knights, is easily my favorite track after the title track. It has such a driving riff, catchy choruses, and lyrics you just couldn't forget (I had no clue what Dio was singing about but i could care less--come to think of it, I'm still not totally sure; I just know i love it).\n\n\nChildren of the Sea gives you a bit of a rest after the opener. This band can set a mood, let me tell you. Then, of course, the full song kicks in; if you don't love it, you don't love heavy metal.\n\n\nLady Evil has more of a straight up blues/rock feel to it, but it's still a great track. Not my particular favorite but still excellent.\n\n\nThen it happens; \"Sing me a song, you're a singer, do me a wrong, you're a bringer of evil.\" The opening riff just hits you right in the mouth. It's a classic, genre-defining riff. Then, as with Children of the Sea, it goes into a quiter setting, perfectly accented by Dio's amazing performance and Iommi's passionate, emotion-filled solos (great use of delay, by the way), which the song follows for about four minutes (give or take), until Vinnie and Geezer push it into overdrive. Tony keeps it going, then, \"They say that life's a carousel, spinning fast you've got to ride it well. The world is full of kings and queens, who blind your eyes and steal your dreams it's Heaven and Hell.\" Words simply cannot describe the excellence of this portion of the song. It is perfect. Iommi delivers one of the most impressive solos I have ever heard, and just when you think it's done, a dueling acoustic line ends the song perfectly. Classic.\n\nThen, in true heavy metal fashion, the band says, \"ok, we have them calm, now ATTACK!!\" And just like that, you are immeresed in the driving riff of Wishing Well. This is a very catchy song with a memorable riff (like many of Iommi's riffs). Again, Dio is fantastic, the acoustic guitar in the background adds quite a bit of depth (in my opinion), and again, Iommi makes great use of delay in his solo.\n\nDie Young is another mood-setter. It starts off slowly with a revolving, flange-y sound effect with dueling guitar harmonies to set you up for another driving riff. This song is just another reason why this album is a genre-defining classic. After a few moments of intensity, the song goes into a slower, acoustic/clean part with more flange and delay, with Dio's voice raising hairs on the back of your neck. A few fills by the band, and it's into an Iommi solo. Bloody excellent.\n\nWalk Away also has a 70's rock-ish feel to it. It's probably the most upbeat of the songs. Perhaps not the most memorable track, but still a great one.\n\nLonely is the Word is a slower one, another great mood-setter. Some great soloing by Iommit and a powerful performance by Dio. A fantastic closer to an excellent album.\n",
        "\nOne year ago, I was a good Sabbath fan. However, the only album I had was Paranoid. Then, my brother gave me this compilation and because of that I am a even BIGGER Sabbath fan now.\n\n\nThe compilation focuses mainly on the Ozzy-era: in fact, only three songs of it don't feature Ozzy Osbourne as the vocalist.\nOn one hand, I recognize that that was the best Sabbath era. But on the other hand, I think that a compilation must contain songs of the other periods of the band, so that you can have a better vision of how the band improved over the years. Why not throw in a few Tony Martin songs? Or more Dio ones? The lack of variety is, indeed, my biggest complaint about this album.\n\nOn the first disc, we have a good collection of the best songs of their first three albums. From the revolutionary Black Sabbath to the complex War Pigs, from the mellow Planet Caravan to the heavy Into the Void - everything is there.\nOn the second disc, we have 13 songs of the other Ozzy-era albums, 2 of the Dio-era and 1 of the (short) Ian Gillan-era. However, the selection of songs isn't very good - in my opinion, a Sabbath compilation MUST contain Sabbra Cadabra and National Acrobat! Where are those two classics?\nHowever, Dirty Women deserves a special mention as it is one of the most underrated Sabbath songs ever and finally is featured on one of their compilations! Yay!\n\n\nSo, if you need an introduction to Black Sabbath, buy/download this Best Of, you will get a pretty nice impression of the band (or, at least, an impression of its early days).\nConcluding, a solid compilation but with too many songs featuring Ozzy. Next time throw in some songs of the other Sabbath periods, ok?\n\n80 points- Some flaws here and there, but a good compilation.\n",
        "\nWell this has to be without doubt the wankest Sabbath song ever, it sounds like one of those piss weak power ballads Aerosmith have been making for the past couple of decades. \n\n\u2018Tyr\u2019 was without doubt an excellent Sabbath album and a continuation of the Tony Martin era resurgence. However, this song is absolute cheese and to be fair a lot of \u2018Tyr\u2019 or \u2018Headless Cross\u2019 was cheesy but in a \u201chell yes, sweet mullet Tony!\u201d kind of way whereas this is just cringe worthy. This line up of Sabbath was undoubtedly of a high musical pedigree but even some over the top drumming from the late great Cozy Powell and a tasty guitar solo can\u2019t save this abomination. Most of the second half of the \u2018Tyr\u2019 album dealt with an epic conceptual theme that had something to do with Norse mythology but this is just another power ballad love song almost indistinguishable from hundreds of others in the late 80\u2019s and early 90\u2019s. Sabbath hadn\u2019t had a big hit in quite some time by 90 (in fact big hits were fairly elusive after \u2018Paranoid\u2019 anyway) so maybe the two Tony\u2019s, Cozy, Neil and Geoff though \u201clets steal some of Whitesnake\u2019s fan base\u201d and came up with this complete dross of a ballad. The verses are bland, the bridge reminds me of all those horrendous Aerosmith songs that come on at the end of bad American films and the chorus\u2019 continues that vibe. Aside from this song \u2018Tyr\u2019 is an epic and grandiose metal album proving that the band despite critical onslaught and only having one original member could still deliver some exceptional metal. But \u2018Feels Good To Me\u2019 showed somewhat of an Achilles heel, as even heavy metal Gods like Sabbath were susceptible to writing absolute crap in the hope of achieving that ever elusive big hit single. \n\nOther potential puns I simply didn\u2019t have room for in the review;\nTyred, Tyrd, Feels Like White Lion To Me, Tyr\u2019s in the Attic, Tyrny Kitaen\u2026I could go on.\n",
        "\nSeventh Star\u2019 is the most misunderstood and judging by the reviews on this site, underrated\u2026I was going to say Sabbath album, but that technically wouldn\u2019t be true. Anyway lets get some things out of the way about \u2018Seventh Star\u2019;\n1. This isn\u2019t a Black Sabbath album, therefore complaining about a lack of heaviness is ridiculous. Why would Iommi release a solo album and write material in keeping with traditional Sabbath doom work outs? \n2. This isn\u2019t hair metal or glam\u2026Both those styles are inherently poppy and upbeat listen to Poison then \u2018Seventh Star\u2019, very different. Black Sabbath (or Black Sabbath featuring Tony Iommi) may have had big hair in 1986 but this sure as hell isn\u2019t hair metal, in fact this isn\u2019t metal at all this is a melodic rock album.\n\n\u2018Seventh Star\u2019 is most notable for being the start of a long running collaboration between Tony Iommi and Glenn Hughes, both musicians shared similar backgrounds coming up in the early 70\u2019s midlands rock scene. Hughes\u2019 Trapeze would often play the same gig circuit as Sabbath did and the bands shared friendships, however the musical background and styling of the pair couldn\u2019t be further apart. Glenn Hughes doesn\u2019t really sing heavy metal, his idol is Stevie Wonder and he naturally plays a sort of funky American sounding rock (see Deep Purple\u2019s \u2018Stormbringer\u2019 album). However, it could be argued that Iommi made this collaboration work by toning down his own heaviness and meeting Glenn halfway. \u2018Seventh Star\u2019 more so than any of Iommi\u2019s works features the song writing of Geoff Nichols. Iommi\u2019s long time keyboardist and general right hand man wrote most of the lyrics and a great deal of the music on \u2018Seventh Star\u2019 and as such he could no longer be refused a place on stage with the band. \n\nAlthough some Metalheads may find some of the direction on \u2018Seventh Star\u2019 not to their liking its difficult to argue with the albums overall quality. To my mind there aren\u2019t actually any bad songs on \u2018Seventh Star\u2019 and the album works as a whole. If I was to compare this to Iommi\u2019s other works with Glenn Hughes, which are generally held in much higher esteem, I would say \u2018Seventh Star\u2019 outstrips them in terms of quality by quite some margin. \u2018In For the Kill\u2019 gets things off to a great start, lyrically it deals with the very metal theme of Vlad the Impaler and features some nice galloping in 7/8 time I do believe. Glenn and Tony really do shine on this one, the both excel with powerful vocal and guitar work. The title track is my favourite here, very ominous and majestic with an eastern feel in keeping with its lyrical themes. Geoff Nichols\u2019 keys do really add another dimension to this track, often an eastern sounding song can seem forced but this one works and conjures up images off sweeping desert sands (or Scarborough, I\u2019m not sure which I last visited). \u2018Danger Zone\u2019 is another departure for Iommi, a misguided reviewer referred to this riff work as typical and how very wrong he was. \u2018Danger Zone\u2019 recalls Thin Lizzy with its multi tracked harmonies and driving rhythms. It\u2019s classic 80\u2019s rock.\n\nThere are a couple of controversy\u2019s here for some of my fellow reviewers most notably \u2018No Stranger to Love\u2019 which is a power ballad no question about it. Now, I could be a clever dick and state how \u2018Sign of the Southern Cross\u2019, \u2018Born Again\u2019 and assorted other Sabbath epics were all in essence power ballads as well. However the fact is \u2018No Stranger to Love\u2019 is very different from the aforementioned songs it\u2019s a blatant attempt at commerce. However, if you take the song for what its worth and what it is rather than going \u201comg this isn\u2019t Iron Man!\u201d it\u2019s a fair enough song, not the best on the album but a nice bluesy ballad and also its much better than the sub-Aerosmith abomination of \u2018Feels Good to Me\u2019 from the otherwise excellent \u2018Tyr\u2019 album. \u2018Heart Like a Wheel\u2019 is another one many here seem to have a problem with as it\u2019s a straight up blues song but I find it an absolute joy to hear Iommi given free reign to rip all over this track. This album losses marks for having two songs which are a bit too generic rock, \u2018Heart of Stone\u2019 and \u2018Angry Heart\u2019 both fall into this category, the latter again features some very strong keyboard work and \u2018Heart of Stone\u2019 once again displays just why Glenn Hughes no matter how drug addled, out of shape and erratic was and always will be one of the finest vocalists in rock with a god like range and passion seldom passed. \n\n\u2018Seventh Star\u2019 features two relative unknown musicians, who do a fair enough job. Eric Singer is the weakest drummer Iommi has worked with however he\u2019s still good, its just the production lets him down as his snare sound is somewhat muddy and the drums altogether lacking in definition (although no where near as the abysmal drum sound on \u2018Born Again\u2019). So he\u2019s not really to blame if he can\u2019t compete with the likes of Bill Ward, Cozy Powell and Vinny Appice. Dave \"The Beast\" Spitz does a fairly good job on bass too but again some of the power is lost in the production leaving the bass somewhat subdued. Iommi, as always is a force to be reckoned with, although these are far from the mans heaviest or greatest riffs these are still great and the soloing is frenzied, bluesy and full of feeling, hey maybe its because we\u2019ve actually got love songs this time instead of singing about evil women and devil\u2019s daughters. To my ears at least, this is Glenn Hughes\u2019 finest vocal performance. Despite being in terrible shape due to years of Cocaine, Alcohol and Mars Bar abuse (no seriously, rumours circled of Glenn\u2019s midnight Mars Bar habit) Glenn\u2019s voice is phenomenal and much more rounded than his Purple days where he got more and more like Stevie Wonder by the minute\u2026to the point of being both blind and black by late 1975.\n\n\u2018Seventh Star\u2019 may not be perfect and its far from a heavy metal album\u2026in fact its far from Black Sabbath, but it was never meant to be. I feel this is Sabbath\u2019s second weakest release of the 80\u2019s (\u2018Eternal Idol\u2019 doesn\u2019t do much for me and is in fact far more hair metal per se than this). Don\u2019t try to compare this to any previous works and certainly don\u2019t go expecting \u2018Heaven and Hell\u2019 because it isn\u2019t this is more Whitesnake or Deep Purple than Black Sabbath, but I happen to like both those bands. After this album and a failed attempt at going solo Iommi would fully resurrect the Sabbath name and by 1989 Sabbath had fully recovered with the stunning \u2018Headless Cross\u2019 but to be fair the bands (or Iommi\u2019s and Nichols\u2019 who were the only constant members in this period) mid 80\u2019s slump from 83 to 87 was really a lot better than people give them credit for.\n",
        "\nThis had all the necessary ingredients to be the live album to end all live albums. The four musicians that made up this era of Black Sabbath are of the highest order, even and including Vinnie Appice who was quite green at this point in his career. All of the songs on here, both of the Dio and Ozzy era, are the picks of the litter if you want a solid concert experience from the first 12 years of Sabbath\u2019s existence. So what went wrong? What keeps this from being the staple by which all metal live albums ought to be compared to?\n\nAlthough the legendary status of some albums making or breaking a band is often inflated, in the case of \u201cLive Evil\u201d the tall tale is of equal height to the reality. When considering the stellar sound quality of most live albums that have been put out by Ronnie Dio during his post-Sabbath days, the extremity of his reaction to the horrid mixing job on this album was probably justified, although I doubt this could be blamed on Tony Iommi or Geezer Butler. Whether the mixing guy they hired was a novice or if he mixed this while choking down some fumes from the almighty ganja while chanting praises to it with \u201cSweet Leaf\u201d blasting in the background, the results speak for themselves. \n\nEvery story you\u2019ve heard about this album is true: the drums are hardly audible, the bass is overpowering, the guitar sounds too muddy during the heavy riffs, and Ronnie Dio sounds like he\u2019s singing from backstage on several of these songs. It gets so bad that on \u201cChildren of the Grave\u201d it gets difficult to hear the separation of the notes and instead of the classic shuffle riff that first personified heaviness, we get something that sounds like an elongated note so muddy that it doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s even being muted. Poor Geoff Nichols, who is the sort of un-credited 5th man in Sabbath, is denied any kind of real impact on the atmosphere and sounds even more distant than the drums; you can hear him a little bit during the guitar solos when the muddy rhythm riffs go away, but otherwise forget it.\n\nThe songs themselves are performed flawlessly, despite the large sound level issues. I can picture myself being at this concert and being in a total state of euphoria as I\u2019m sure most that saw this tour probably were, assuming that the sound quality at the concert was not exactly the same as this recording of it is. In some cases like \u201cBlack Sabbath\u201d, \u201cChildren of the Sea\u201d and \u201cHeaven and Hell\u201d the production issues are not as overwhelming as in others and I can really get into what I\u2019m listening to. Ronnie performs the Ozzy era stuff far better than Ozzy ever has either with this band or solo with Randy Rhoades. I have yet to hear a live rendition of either \u201cN.I.B.\u201d or \u201cChildren of the Grave\u201d sung with this much power and passion. The only poor vocal performance on here is \u201cParanoid\u201d, where Ronnie gets carried away and sounds almost like he\u2019s singing with a muddled Indian accent. Every time he sings this song it sounds bad, and his high vocal range doesn\u2019t cut it as an excuse since Tony Martin has pulled this song off far better than this.\n\nAs far as recommendations go, if you can get past the extremely poor sound levels on here, this would be worth getting. It has historical value for Sabbath fan mainstays, both young and old, just don\u2019t expect to be wowed by it. You\u2019d probably get more enjoyment out of hearing the live material from the Heaven and Hell 2007 tour. 25 years after this famous tour Ronnie Dio can still sing with this level of intensity, which is more than I can say for many of his contemporaries who are trying to make comebacks right now. It\u2019s a rather good constellation considering the disappointment I had when I first heard this.\n",
        "\nSo, I was given this VHS by a friend of mine who didn' feel like he really needed it any longer. Well, what the hell, I figured, no reason not to take it, I love Black Sabbath. So take it I did. Took it home and forgot about it for a good long while.\n\nWhen I finally did pop it in my player, i found two things... The first was that Black Sabbath's music videos were hilarious, and the second was that the rare live footage on here was purely amazing.\n\nWe first get to see a live rendition of NIB (a song that, by this point, I'm sure NONE of us are sick of... right). Now, this song sounds great on the album but LIVE... well, it sounds great, because they played it almost directly from the album, solos and all. Not always great, but it fits here. Then we get to hear some alternating interview clips from Tony and Geezer. These are gold, because they tell some nice little anecdotes about the heyday in Sabbath, featuring a quip about Tony Iommi fried on hash, and trying to play a flute in front of a huge audience in concert... without putting it up to his lips.\n\nBack to the video... There are two videos worth mentioning on here, that are not live, but were music videos. The first is Paranoid, and if you haven't seen it yet RUN! NOW! Because it's one of the most essential 70s videos in the history of 70s videos. We've got psychedelic wheels spinning in the walls, we have cameras zooming in and out at an alarming, and we got four band members wearing bellbottoms... genius. The second is Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath, and that's one for the books. Just watch it, you'll know what I mean.\n\nAnyway, focusing more on the music available... the live tracks are great, a real treat, and my favorite comes on next. War Pigs, with some of the original lyrics still intact. Alot of people aren't cognizant of the fact that Ozzy used to sing the song about witches and black masses instead of making a slight allusion to such subject matter. Here it seems like he's improvising and can't decide which to focus on... still a great video.\n\nThe last high point I will focus on is the song Snowblind... a live version of this song is always a treat, but to see them stumbling about the stage, Ozzy smiling and clapping all the while, yelling cocaine... man it's good.\n\nAll in all it's a great video, but there isn't much to it aside from a few high points, which I mentioned here. To the Black Sabbath pack-rat it's a definite must, but due to it's rarity, I'd just try for a DVD set of every volume.\n",
        "\nI first discovered Sabbath in 1983 with the Born Again album, strange for someone who listened to metal as far back as 1975. Immediately I got into the band and the first album I ever purchased by them after BA was this one, in 1984, before ever hearing an Ozzy era song/album.\n\nI validate that this is a great way to be introduced to the band, they're loud, hard, heavy, fast, demonic and crushing, all the elements that give heavy metal it's identity, and who better than to start the 1980's decade than a rejuvenated Sabbath. After 1975's masterpiece, and only Ozzy era Sabbath album to deserve a perfect rating, the band pondered through two good but confusing albums, before Ozzy left/got fired. Instead of running into the night Sabbath got veteran vocalist Ronnie James Dio, who in his own right, had just got done rewriting the face of metal two years earlier while in Rainbow. So it comes as no surprise that a vocalist of Ronnie's caliber teaming up with Sabbath. a splendid album was in store.\n\nNeon Knights, the albums lead off track, surpasses all expectations and reveals right off the bat, this is not the same Sabbath. This is not the same band of middle aged men with a vocalist who's vocals were becoming more and more embarrassing with every passing album. No this was a band of middle aged men playing half their age and a vocalist who's vocals soared higher than his height and slapped in the face all those critics who had written the band off as dead. This was Sabbath refusing to break to the pressures of the business, instead grabbing it by the balls and laughing as the critics groaned in agony at the sheer bliss for which the album offers.\n\nNeon Knights could have been the one and only track here and it would still deserve a rating higher than at least five-thousand other metal bands. Just listen to how Dio sings, \"Bloodied angels, fast descending. Moving on a never-bending light\". That entire section, beginning at 1:28 and ending with a demonic NEON KNIGHTS at 1:48, is beyond description, and gives the album fifty points simply by itself. Throw in the kick ass solo and an appropriate time length, no overkill here, and you got simply one of the bands all time best tracks.\n\nChildren Of The Sea is a bit slower, beginning acoustically and with Dio singing softly about mysticism. The song becomes heavy but never truly gets fast, instead remaining melodic and even returning the opening sequence a few times, it's amazing how many different styles Dio uses to perfection here. So while not as fast as the opener, it shows Sabbath did not lose it's versatility with Ozzy's departure, instead broadening all those otherwise untouched ideas.\n\nLady Evil is a good song with a good bass-driving rhythm, but due to it's placing, that being before the title track, it pales in comparison. The title track begins with the thunderous tone of the opener with a speed similar to the sophomore track, before leading into a grueling bass line. Right off the bat you know an epic has started and you have no choice but listen to Dio's voice, it works so well in tandem that it's authoritative. A ton of riffs and sharp guitar licks are thrown in with some ethereal keyboards for good measure, forcing the song deeper into your psyche. The previous uncharted territory begins two minutes in when a slow gradual build-up sends the song into the next phase, never getting old, instead being pleasurable to the ear every second. The tempo increases as does the dark swelling atmosphere, never taking away from Dio's haunting reverberated voice. After this awesome verse everything quiets down and you know what is coming, God himself to make sure you remember who invented all of this. The first two notes drag on with a purpose few songs can describe, waving and interweaving through the stratosphere you are cast in by the never ending bass line. Blissful licks all played with extreme amount of taste and phrasing sends the song into the next section, drums begin the build up before Tony returns with another solo. Then out of nowhere the final phase kicks in with more kick ass lyrics delivered by a passionate voice Ozzy could never touch.\n\nBecause Wishing Well follows the title track, it suffers the same thing Lady Evil does. In fact some could argue that the entire second half falters because of this, especially since the two weakest songs, in the form of Wishing Well and Walk Away, are located here. But that thinking would be false as while the aforementioned songs do take up the second side, so does another superb track and the best song on the entire album, Die Young and Lonely Is The Word respectively.\n\nDie Young is a mixture of the first two tracks, Neon Knights tone and heaviness with Children Of The Sea's grace, melodic and progressive elements. A ton of fine synthetic are thrown throughout, each with a purpose, that purpose is to give the song an extra dimension of emotion. Dio's vocals continue to be in top notch form, just listen to the second time he sings, \"Gather the wind, though the wind wont help you fly at all\" for proof of this.\n\nNow we come to the closer of such an extraordinary album, the bluesy reflective piece otherwise known as Lonely Is The Word. There is so many styles of music here, with a touch of waltz and country & western in the percussive patterns, though you don't notice. Your too captivated by Tony's crushing yet soothing guitar, Dio's evasive yet strangely relate able lyrics, Bill and Geezer's off-balance rhythm. If you do not feel your heart bleed, your eyes water and your deepest, darkest and saddest emotions come to the surface when Tony begins his first solo just shy of the two minute mark, then you never will. Close your eyes, let him and the deep atmosphere consume your spirit and comfort your most depressing moments, Tony certainly was when he did this. Another verse comes in at the three and a half minute mark and while still evasive, they seem to make so much sense, with Tony's breath-taking fills and Bill's heavy drumming completing the purpose. The next two minutes Tony plays in such a dramatic fashion you could accuse him of just showing off, but you'd be a snot nosed newbie to metal. Each and every note played means something, another attack on emotions, crushing defeat, financial burden, lonely night. Every possible demon comes to the surface here and he just destroys them all, leading you to a much happier place, at least for almost six minutes of the songs duration.\n\nIt's no surprise that the band who, in 1970, laid the blueprint for all metal to follow, and forged ahead throughout the entire decade. Would come down and write another chapter not only in their own history book but Metal's in general. I should not have to recommend this album to you, for you certainly must have it, if not you do not deserve the title of a 'Metal Fan'\n",
        "\nAs you can see from the rating, this is Sabbath's all time best album...\n\nWhile it is true that Black Sabbath has never released a truly 'bad' album, some have been less consistent or enjoyable than others. The reasons can be attributed to many different things, be it the change of direction, the multiple line-up changes, the drugs, etc... But no matter the reason, in the face of all the scrutiny and dying fan base, Sabbath managed to release the greatest album to ever feature the Black Sabbath moniker. If Black Sabbath truly means 'Death' than no album, rather before or after, sums up the name than this album, it's soul is darker, heavier and more demonic than anything in Sabbath's back catalogue. From the thunderous drum intro of the title track or the fade out of Nightwing, and everywhere in between, this is pure bliss to any metal ear.\n\nWhat sets this album apart is not just the quality material, that was expected from Sabbath, but because they step into new grounds and form a loosely-based concept. While it is not Surveillance, Thunder Seven, Streets, The Wall or 2112, it's heaviness and darkness makes up for any holes in the story. Of the Ozzy albums only Sabotage can be regarded as a talented album in terms of vocals. Then when they found better singers, Dio, Gillan and Hughes, some members were either not up to par or the music lacked something. So when they found Tony Martin, the best singer Sabbath has and ever will know, and hearing this albums predecessor(Eternal Idol) one knew the band was only a step or two away from another shining masterpiece.\n\nIf you like your metal served with great dark atmosphere, than sink your teeth into this tasteful dish. Because this is Sabbath's best album ever and Sabbath is one of, if not THE, best metal band ever, this deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as not only the other legendary metal albums by other bands. But also compares well with Sabotage, Heaven And Hell, Eternal Idol or their self-titled debut. Some songs are down tempo, while others are lightning quick, delivered with a sense of urgency and forcefulness that had left Sabbath since Heaven And Hell. Others are doom and gloomy epics like When Death Calls and Black Moon, while others are standard power metal tracks, but never lose it's heaviness.\n\nThe opening Gates Of Hell is a minute intro that conjures up images of taking a trip into, well, Hell. As you cross the gates you find yourself in Hell where helpless victims are found on a headless cross, which has lost it's head to lightning, a sign of heaven forcing it's way into this place. Devil And Daughter sit atop their thrones, sucking the soul from the victims as death calls, as they sink into the sunken eyes of on the face of death. Your tongue blisters from the sweltering heat burning the victims that the evil shadow takes. As a chilling wind sweeps through the wind, chilling the blood in your veins, the spirit world brightens by the star in the Eastern sky, death leaves his hellish house breaking seals and crossing oaths. You are dragged to the blackened pit of Hell all the while praying for deliverance from purgatory, but just as sunshine seems to happen a black moon erases all chances and the nightwing comes down to remove your soul.\n\nOkay so that play on words may be over the top but it's easy to find a story when the entire album is saturated in death, so much so that it makes the previous tales from the band look like tales of 'flowers' and 'happiness'. The riffs are crunching, drums blistering, bass thick and evil and Tony Martin's voice is more sinister than even the most death metal bands. Even when the band tones it down during Nightwing and Tony plays an acoustic guitar, the atmosphere never leaves, only giving you a chance to reflect on the story too dark to tell and too demonic for other bands to touch.\n\nMy only complaint with this record is, unless you buy the picture disk, it leaves out Sabbath's all-time best track in Cloak And Dagger, but if you exclude that minor flaw this is the perfect album. Everything that defines metal and Sabbath is here, delivered by one of the greatest lineups in the history of metal. I shouldn't tell you to buy this, since you are a metal fan you must already have this, if you do not, WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU...\n\nNIGHTWING FLIES AGAIN...\n",
        "\nMy opinion on this album has shifted many times since I first bought it about 10 years ago. I was dead set revolted by it when I first heard it, mostly because it bore almost no similarity to \u201cParanoid\u201d, which was obviously my favorite album during my Sabbath newbie days. Since then I\u2019ve become a bit older and wiser and can thus impart some wisdom to the younger Sabbath fans that are just now coming to know the second half of the Ozzy years. \n\nThere is a right way and a wrong way to view this album, and the wrong way is the way most people view it, which is as a metal album. Although a good deal more riff happy and up tempo, the closest thing this album could be compared to is with late 70s Pink Floyd with perhaps a dash of Styx. Naturally there are many in the Doom and Traditional metal scenes who utterly despise Arena Oriented Rock so they are advised to ignore this album. But for those of you who really like the forward looking idea (at this particular time) of merging heavy metal with progressive rock, this is where it got started and eventually paved the way to the likes of Dream Theater and Fates Warning doing it, this may be worth your time.\n\nNaturally this is not a perfect example of the potential of this style, and better examples of experimenting with acoustic guitars and keyboards can be heard from early 80s acts like Sacred Blade and Queensryche should be sought out if you\u2019re interested in the evolution of this style. \u201cRock N\u2019 Roll Doctor\u201d and \u201cShe\u2019s Gone\u201d in particular are blatant examples of going too much in a generic 70s rock direction and mimicking Zepplin a bit too much rather than evenly meshing such influences with Sabbath\u2019s unique style. \u201cIt\u2019s Alright\u201d is a bit better, but ultimately sounds like a jazzed up Beatles ballad with a more active guitar presence. Bill Ward takes the vocal duties on this one and does an adequate job, which is more than I can say for Ozzy\u2019s performance on \u201cShe\u2019s Gone\u201d.\n\nThe rest of the material on here is mostly solid save a few odd moments here and there. The two that best showcase Sabbath\u2019s success at blending their already established sound with the latest influences they\u2019ve incorporated are \u201cYou Won\u2019t Change Me\u201d and \u201cDirty Women\u201d. They both have long drawn out sections with plenty of development, mostly in the style heard on \u201cSabotage\u201d, and bring out some synthesizer work not heard on previous work. The opener \u201cBack Street Kids\u201d is basically \u201cParanoid\u201d with a Rush style keyboard interlude that immediately invokes memories of 2112 every time I hear it. But the most auspicious moment on this album is the guitar solo section of \u201cAll Moving Parts\u201d where we hear a near identical riff to the classic Heaven and Hell track \u201cWishing Well\u201d.\n\nUltimately, this album is a pretty sizable step down in quality, but far from a throwaway. It has its place, but I\u2019d argue that about 65% of it is not in any metal genre. As a rock album I could say that this is better than a good deal of the fluff put out in 1976, but in terms of everything else that Sabbath put out before this, I can\u2019t recommend getting this before getting any of the other 6. It\u2019s not a flop like its follow-up \u201cNever Say Die\u201d, but it\u2019s not quite good enough to get at full price, so look for it second hand.\n",
        "\nBlack Sabbath were in a bad way by 1975. Years of drug and alcohol abuse had obviously taken their toll, and the stress of constant touring throughout the early years of the decade had also worn down the cohesiveness of the group considerably. This is most apparent on the last two releases from this lineup, the dire Technical Ecstasy and the equally odious Never Say Die, but for one final moment Sabbath were prepared to outshine everyone else in the scene in their full glory.\n\nThe album opens with \"Hole In The Sky\", and it's readily apparent that something is different this time: the guitars sound thicker and fatter than on any preceding Sabbath album, with much more 'crunch' to their tone; the tempo of the song is faster than almost anything in the rest of the Sabbath discography; and the feeling of sublime mania has been replaced with an aggressiveness not yet seen in heavy metal. Gone too are the flirtations with progressive rock displayed on Sabbath Bloody Sabbath; this is a pure mid-paced heavy metal anthem decrying the greed of the modern age.\n\n\"Don't Start (Too Late)\" follows on from \"Hole In The Sky\", serving as nothing more than a beautiful acoustic flourish intro into \"Symptom of the Universe\". A word must be said about \"Symptom...\", namely that this is probably the first thrash metal song ever recorded and one which wouldn't sound at all out of place on a later album like Dehumanizer. Osbourne's howls are as chilling as ever, effectively elevating the simple-yet-heavy riff and hard-thrashing drumline into the upper stratosphere. One of Iommi's best solos in his career comes careening through the song near the four-minute mark, before slowing down into a strangely placed instrumental piece vaguely Latin in nature. This might confuse the listen upon first hearing this track, but I've never found it at all out of place, and consider it an admirable attempt to progress the trademark Sabbath sound without relying on pop-music staples.\n\n\"Meglomania\" is next, and it is, for me, the absolute highlight of the album. Opening with a wondrous, darkly alluring orchestral piece over which Osbourne utilizes his nasally vocals to great effect, this song really kicks into gear about two and a half minutes into the piece, revealing a monumentally doomish riff which only accentuates Ozzy's misery, effectively creating the template from which doom and goth metal bands would draw to this very day. Following a short piano piece, however, the song really catches fire, breaking lose with a riff which can only be called triumphant as Osbourne shrieks in rebellion against the sorrows which have so plagued his life. Like the previous track, this song displays Sabbath's unique ability to completely alter the mood of a song without making it disconcerting in the slightest.\n\n\"Thrill of it All\" proceeds \"Megalomania\", opening with a slow yet catchy riff before breaking out into another splendid solo. This track has a groovier feel to it than anything else on this album, and possesses a certain defiant attitude unmatched on anything else in the Sabbath discography. This is another 'upbeat' Sabbath track, which dispels firmly the old myth that the band, and heavy metal itself, is nothing more than angst-ridden whining. The following track, \"Supertzar\", opens with a riff which could have been utilized more effectively (in an actual song) and a lovely choral backing, but unfortunately fails to amount to anything more than another in a long line of Sabbathian instrumental experimentations.\n\n\"Am I Going Insane\" picks up the pace, opening with a siren-like squeal before disintegrating into an almost joyous semi-rock song which sounds more like something The Beatles would have written than anything relevant to heavy metal. \"The Writ\", however, really saves the last third of the record, serving as the closing epic to both this album and the most productive period in Sabbath's long, illustrious and infamous career.\n\nSave for two plodding cuts which could have been left out without sacrificing anything on the record, this album is a pinnacle in the Sabbath discography. I prefer Sabbath Bloody Sabbath both for its mood and its structuring, but the production values displayed on this record completely outshine anything the band had previously attempted. This would, of course, work to the detriment of the succeeding two records, but that's for another review.\n",
        "\nI picked up this album when I was fourteen after first hearing \"Iron Man\", \"War Pigs\" and \"Paranoid\". Of course being the idiot fourteen-year old that I was, I didn't know exactly where a good place to start was in Black Sabbath's discography, nor did I have any idea that sites like Encyclopaedia Metallum even existed. Hence my eventual purchase of \"We Sold Our Soul for Rock N' Roll\".\n\nThis is a good place to start if, like I was, you have absolutely zero knowledge of Black Sabbath and you want a good sampler of their best material. This collection is the best place to start.\n\nAlthough it was released after their first six albums were out, most of the material here is from their first four. \"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\" and \"Sabotage\" have only one song apiece here, which is ridiculous. There is no \"A National Acrobat\". No \"Sabra Cadabra'. No \"Symptom of the Universe\"...and so on and so forth.\n\nNot to say the selections they did choose aren't good, but half the goddamn album was lifted from \"Black Sabbath\" and \"Paranoid\"...these songs may be classics, but let's not fool ourselves into thinking those two are the only essential Black Sabbath albums. They did add a few songs from \"Master of Reality\" and \"Volume 4\". And unfortunately only \"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\" and \"Am I Going Insane\" (a song that, while good, is not quite on the level the omitted \"Symptom of the Universe\" is on) from their fifth and sixth albums.\n\nI listened to this album for two years before wanting more Sabbath and rushing out and buying their first six albums, which is always going to be the best choice, but if you think you need a Black Sabbath album in your collection, but aren't a huge fan...look no further than \"We Sold Our Soul for Rock N' Roll\".\n",
        "\nBlack Sabbath's album Cross Purposes was the first album recorded after vocalist Ronnie James Dio's second exit from the band, and marks the return of Tony Martin as singer. Geezer Butler stayed on as bassist and the band recruited former Rainbow drummer Bobby Rondinelli. Cross Purposes is the only studio album recorded by this lineup, and in my opinion the album is something of a mixed bag. Not terrible by any means, but I wouldn't call it a classic Sabbath release. \n\nI've always been of the opinion that the first Martin era, with the albums \"The Eternal Idol,\" \"Headless Cross\" and \"Tyr,\" was better than his second go-round with the band. There are rumours that Martin and Geezer didn't see eye to eye regarding songwriting on CP, Geezer wanting to go heavy and Martin preferring some AOR elements. Did Geezer actually say that Tony Martin \"hates everything heavy?\" In any case what we have here are some great songs and some that range from so-so to downright dull. \n\nHighlights of the album are the heavy \"Virtual Death,\" Geezer having a hand in this one as evidenced by the bass solo intro. The riffing is slow and doomy on this one, and Martin makes good use of the entire range of his voice. Another favorite is the excellent \"Immaculate Deception,\" probably the best song on the album. The vibe of this one hearkens back to the Heaven and Hell days, beginning with an odd offtime riff (alternating measures of 4/4 and 6/4 time) then breaking into a high-speed section, Tony Martin's vocals adding intensity to the whole affair. This one is simply a great track and shows why Tony Iommi is still the \"riffmaster general\". My other favorites are \"Cardinal Sin,\" a fast number which exposes the abusive nature of organized religion, and \"Evil Eye,\" which begins with a great doom riff as only Iommi can write them. This one is a bit of a rocker and was co-written by Eddie Van Halen, who didn't get credited in the liner notes. Another great vocal performance by Martin. \n\nThe rest of the album, in my opinion, is kind of lacking. The opening riff to \"I Witness\" doesn't really impress me, although it gets getter during the verse. \"Psychophobia\" is ok but doesn't reach the level of the best songs. I wonder if the lyric \"It's time to kiss the rainbow goodbye,\" is a stab at Dio. \"Cross of Thorns\" is a decent power ballad-type song, but then \"Dying for Love\" is more of the same and not much differentiates the two songs in terms of style. \"Back to Eden\" does nothing for me, and \"The Hand that Rocks the Cradle\" is the real stinker of the album. Musically unspectacular and with the same name as a stupid movie, this songs is at odds with my pro-choice stance on abortion. \n\nAlthough it's not the worst Sabbath album, neither is it anywhere near the quality level of their most classic and influential releases. Geezer exited the band after this one, so it seems the bassmaster supreme was a bit dissatisfied with the situation at the time. Hardcore Sabbath fans will enjoy this one as there are some killer songs, but be aware that the song quality wavers at times. Still, the album is a decent attack against the evils of organized religion and features fine preformances from all musicians involved.\n",
        "\nAs a long time Black Sabbath fan, when I received this box set through a friend, I had a pretty good guess as to what I may find. I was right and wrong, with this collection being both well-rounded and disappointing.\n\n\nFor the new Sabbath listener, you may find some of (few) tracks heard on the radio, including \"Paranoid\" and \"NIB\". These are no doubt good tracks, and along with the others included on this album, make up a good introduction to Sabbath for the casual listener. The tracks included span all of Ozzy-Era Black Sabbath, including mainly hit songs, and the occasional \"artistic-value\" track.\n\n\nSadly, this box set also includes some flat out dismal tracks, mainly embodied in \"Am I Going Insane\", \"Laguna Sunrise\", and \"Fluff\". These are all songs which not many listeners will not appreciate when placed beside classics such as \"Black Sabbath\", \"Paranoid\", and \"War Pigs\". This not so good tracks are not by any means a big problem, as they can be expected of any two disc, era-spanning, box set. Although these songs may seem like filler, by no means let it dissuade a new metalhead from buying this set.\n\n\nAs a last note, the booklet that comes with this set is excellent, full of surprising nuggets of information about Black Sabbath and its members. Included are the origins of the band, and some anecdotes about band members, including Tony Iommi's run-in with a devil-figure.\n\n\nAll in all, a recommend box set, although definitely not essential for the hardcore Sabbath devotee, as the most memorable songs on this box set are already in your collection (hopefully).\n",
        "\nAfter essentially confusing and alienating a large proportion of their fan base Black Sabbath since about 1983 (namely Tony Iommi) decided he needed his credibility back, that\u2019s not to say that \u2018Born Again\u2019, \u2018Seventh Star\u2019 and \u2018Eternal Idol\u2019 didn\u2019t produce some great stuff or weren\u2019t musically credible but the whole \u2018Who\u2019s in your band this week, Tony?\u2019 was starting to seriously damage the bands reputation especially in the press who were quite merciless in their ribbing of Sabbath (the cheek! You write for Kerrang!). Also the fact that on \u2018Seventh Star\u2019 and \u2018Eternal Idol\u2019 Iommi had used a lot of more lightweight material making those albums the worst since \u2018Technical Ecstasy\u2019 and \u2018Never Say Die\u2019. It\u2019s safe to say it was time for a rejuvenation and a serious return to form\u2026and predictably the two Tony\u2019s and Cozy delivered in the face of adversity and then some, in the same way that \u2018Heaven and Hell\u2019 had done almost a decade ago.\n\nSo what we have here is a heavy fucking metal classic, a consistent one too. This is easily the bands strongest set of songs since the all out amazing \u2018Mob Rules\u2019. Not a trace of the filler that plagued \u2018Eternal Idol\u2019. \u2018Headless Cross\u2019 is the best known song of the Tony Martin era and not without reason, it\u2019s a killer. From that \u2018I play my drums with hammers\u2019 intro, to that classic Iommi riff, to Tony Martin\u2019s awe inspiring vocals, it just sets the tone for the rest of the album; cheesy, epic, heavy and generally wailing on about Satan. \u2018Devil and Daughter\u2019 named after a Dennis Wheatley novel (and a rather mediocre Hammer film) is another top notch song apparently inspired by the truly loathsome Sharon and Don Arden, it\u2019s the fastest song here and driven along by what characterizes this album; pounding drums, excellent melodic guitars and Tony Martin wailing about Satan! And it just gets better! \u2018When Death Calls\u2019 is the rightful successor to the epic Dio era classics (\u2018Sign of the Southern Cross\u2019, \u2018Falling of the Edge of the World\u2019 etc) and it\u2019s the best of a very strong collection from that eerie bass intro that apparently caused so many difficulties for future Sabbath bassists. It has a great atmosphere even by Sabbath\u2019s standard\u2019s and lets face it they are the masters. We even get a lovely bit of galloping, another flawless vocal performance and even Brian May pops round for a solo (I never liked Queen bare a few songs but he\u2019s a great player). So even 19 years into their recording career Sabbath show they can still school everyone. The albums second side (I have this on tape you see, how very 80\u2019s!) while not as strong as the first is still exceptional with no hint of filler. \u2018Kill in the Spirit World\u2019 has Tony Martin adding a touch of class to proceedings, it\u2019s a very cheesy song even on a very cheesy album but still the strong lyrics and soaring vocals really are a treat. \u2018Call of the Wild\u2019 continues the mid album cheese fest and its pretty much in the same vain as \u2018Kill in the Spirit World\u2019 but with a eastern feel in places and as with the bloody album very catchy and atmospheric. \u2018Black Moon\u2019 stands out here as its got a bluesy feel to it, not early Sabbath bluesy but more \u2018feel the wind in your mullet as you drive away from the tall man from Phantasm\u2019 bluesy (maybe that\u2019s just me), we even get some nice touches of organ (or a keyboard pretending to be an organ) from the always underrated Geoff Nichols. Ending on a high note (although to be fair the whole album never let up) is \u2018Night Wing\u2019 which is the only song not about Satan, but owls and bats instead. There are is some damn fine riffs and leads here Iommi certainly lets rip and Laurence Cottle provides some cheesy 80\u2019s lead bass, a nice touch. And then there you have it another metal classic successfully re-establishing Black Sabbath as a major force in heavy metal, well in artistic terms at least as Headless Cross sold well in mainland Europe, England and Japan but America didn\u2019t really \u2018get it\u2019, You Bastards!\n\nLyrically, this album is almost entirely preoccupied with the occult and all though perhaps an acquired taste I find it very much to my liking. Tony Martin does a splendid job here and although cheesy in places its got great atmosphere and the lyrics are generally well done. He really proves himself as a writer on this album, sadly he didn\u2019t get time to write on \u2018Eternal Idol\u2019 but he more than makes up for it here. The title track is perhaps the strongest song here lyrically and it deals with Redditch (a small town where Tony Martin lives) and about the plague in the middle ages where the residents of Redditch went to the hill of the headless cross and prayed for survival and none of them did! Metal or what? So this album has a very high Satan quota, and it really works and lets face it where would heavy metal be without Old Nick?\n\nMusically the whole band is flawless on this release, Iommi is on terrific form and pulls out his best set of riffs in years and then wails, trills and squeals through his always magnificent lead work. New boy Cozy Powell really shouldn\u2019t need an introduction, he was one of the all time great drummers and he shows just why here. Even though it\u2019s not the best drum sound Cozy ever had (Rainbow\u2019s \u2018rising\u2019 and Whitesnake\u2019s \u2018Slide it in\u2019 come to mind) its still pretty damn thunderous and instantly recognisable. Laurence Cottle is essentially a session bassist, but a good one and he plays imaginatively even though I don\u2019t find his clear tight bass sound in keeping with traditional Sabbath. I suppose I\u2019d rather have Neil Murray on this album just for the sake of continuity. Tony Martin fully realises the potential he showed on \u2018Eternal Idol\u2019 and is not only technically excellent but sings with feeling. Sound wise I suppose this is something of a step forward for Black Sabbath but with one foot in the Dio years as its closer to \u2018Mob Rules\u2019 and \u2018Heaven and Hell\u2019 than any other pre-1989 Sabbath release. You can\u2019t really compare this to any of the Ozzy material and if I\u2019ve ever seen a bad review its by 12 year olds who think Black Sabbath is ripping off Kyuss going \u2018This isn\u2019t Paranoid! Meh, meh ,meh\u2026\u2019 So I\u2019m not even going to draw comparisons all I will say is that this, the first six Ozzy era albums and the first two with Dio are all metal classics. Albeit, this isn\u2019t as good as those albums but that\u2019s hardly a criticism. \n\nSo just when everyone had given up on Sabbath after the whole mid 80\u2019s \u2018let\u2019s go to Hollywood, hire hair metal singers, marry Lita Ford and do cocaine\u2019 fiasco Mr Iommi finally got his shit together and delivered what we all wanted to here (no not Paranoid II, you bloody stoner fan!) but a true metal classic of the highest order. Thanks Mr Martin for the Satan factor, thank you Mr Powell for lending your Hammer\u2019s and err its been nice to see you Laurence I hope the jazz fusion goes well. Oh yeah, and if your keeping track this is better than \u2018No Rest For The Wicked\u2019 so that\u2019s Iommi 6, Osbourne 0. And just to help things that little bit more the cover art is great (perhaps my favourite along side the debut and \u2018Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\u2019) and \u2018Headless Cross\u2019 has a great promo video. Further of note what happens if you chop the head off a Cross? A t and t stands for Tyr! hey, don't laugh Tony Martin said that.......I fucking love this album.\n",
        "\nThis album is easily the worst Black Sabbath release of the 80\u2019s and feels like a collection of songs that generally aren\u2019t good enough to have been on the \u2018Seventh Star\u2019 album and what\u2019s more it doesn\u2019t have the masterful Glenn Hughes on vocals, instead we have Tony Martin, whose talents are limited by the fact that he has to sing Ray Gillen\u2019s parts. However I would still consider Tony Martin one of this albums saving graces. Yet still this album is being heralded as \u2018a hidden masterpiece\u2019 and \u2018Sabbath\u2019s best album\u2019, give me a break, it feels like the shaky follow up to \u2018Seventh Star\u2019 which is the second worst of Sabbath\u2019s 80\u2019s output.\n\nAll things considered this album does has its moments the finest of which probably being \u2018The Shining\u2019 which is a complete cheese fest (in the best possible way) and features some great riffs from Iommi, a catchy chorus and some perhaps unintentionally hilarious lyrics such as \u2018the house is gonna haunt you!\u2019. \u2018Ancient Warrior\u2019 is another of the albums stronger tracks which has a slightly middle eastern feeling and a catchy chorus, but not a Sabbath classic by any means. \u2018Born to Lose\u2019 could be the work of pretty much any 80\u2019s metal band and has some very generic riffs but is still a good enough song featuring a very good vocal performance on Tony Martin\u2019s part. My favourite song on this album without doubt is the beautiful instrumental \u2018Scarlet Pimpernel\u2019 which is something we had not heard from Tony Iommi since \u2018Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\u2019 (although there is a little instrumental at the end of \u2018Heaven and Hell\u2019) and its well worth the wait, it serves as a reminder that Iommi is in my opinion the greatest guitarist ever. I can\u2019t help but feel a little bit let down by the albums title track as the verses are great very sinister and creepy not dissimilar to the bands self titled track then the chorus is a complete cheese fest (this time in a bad way) which completely ruins the atmosphere established by the verse, still it stands out as a song.\n\nBut generally this album is a mixed bag with some complete crap the worst of which being \u2018Hard Life to Love\u2019 which features some sub-Zeppelin riffs and very clich\u00e9d \u2018living in the fast lane\u2019 lyrics. \u2019Nightmare\u2019 starts well with some atmospheric keyboards from Geoff Nicholls suddenly descends into dull riffs that in no way help convey the lyrics of being \u2019fooled by the devils hand\u2019 (which perhaps hints a the lyrical direction of the Tony Martin era masterpiece \u2018Headless Cross\u2019). \u2018Glory Ride\u2019 yet again starts promisingly with Iommi deciding he wants to sound like himself again after the Jimmy Page rip-off riffs of the previous song but the song itself soon starts to feel less Sabbath and more generic 80\u2019s rock. Not a bad song by any means but not really Black Sabbath. \u2018Lost Forever\u2019 is the albums fastest song, but fast does mean good (as many thrash fans may fail to understand) and this song is painfully average. \n\nMusically this line up is a rather strange one, I like the addition of Bob Daisley on bass he plays well and could well be the best bass player Sabbath had outside of Geezer Butler, but the other half of the rhythm section, Eric Singer as good a drummer as he is, he\u2019s not suited to this band and he lacks any of the style of the great Sabbath drummers such as Bill Ward, Cozy Powell and Vinnie Appice. This is Tony Martins first Sabbath album and he is one of the albums redeeming features, but he isn\u2019t really aloud an influence on the material that would prove itself successful on the following albums;\n\u2018Headless Cross\u2019 and \u2018Tyr\u2019. \n\n\u2018Eternal Idol\u2019 is one of Sabbath\u2019s weaker albums but its not a complete waste of time it does feature some strong songs and will no doubt be of interest to die-hard Sabbath fans. Thankfully after this album things really began to pick up with the arrival of Cozy Powell and Tony Martin being allowed to contribute more to song writing.\n",
        "\nBlack Sabbath's 1992 album Dehumanizer marked the first reunion of the \"Mob Rules\" lineup of Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, Ronnie James Dio and Vinnie Appice (the second being 2007's tour under the alias Heaven and Hell). A classic version of the band, for sure. But with a decade apart, one wonders if there wasn't a bit of tension surrounding this reunion. It's been said that Iommi wanted to increase Sabbath's profile in the US, and in that aspect the reunion was a success. The album, however, is something of a mixed bag. \n\nDehumanizer fails to capture the vibe of the early Dio-Sabbath albums, \"Heaven and Hell\" and \"Mob Rules.\" The music and production values are more modern, as is to be expected. But maybe the band should have taken more time to become comfortable working with each other again (most evident in the fact that this is the only album they did before breaking up again). Dehumanizer isn't a weak album by any means. Fact is, it's mean as Hell on some tracks. But it's about half-and-half, and the other half kinda bores me. The standout tracks are classic Sabbath, and I'd say those are \"Computer God,\" \"After All(The Dead),\" \"TV Crimes,\" \"Too Late,\" and \"I.\" These five songs pretty much sum up what is best about Dio-Sabbath. Sadly, the other songs don't really measure up to the best songs. They're not bad, but they are somewhat filler. \"Time Machine\" appeared on the Wayne's World soundtrack, but they only played about ten seconds of the song during the movie. Iommi appeared onscreen briefly in Wayne's World 2, but I digress.\n\nRegardless, Dehumanizer is another great album in the Sabbath discography and a must have for Dio-Sabbath fans. The musicianship is superb, but songwriting-wise they should have taken a bit more time to clean the rust off of this legendary heavy metal beast before venturing back into the studio.\n",
        "\nThis was my first purchase of Black Sabbath, after listening to Heaven and Hell at my brother's house. And still, this is one of my favourite Sabbath albums, the one I keep coming back to. I'll try to tell you why. I believe first impressions, if not last forever, but are very important, so here's some thoughts I had when I picked this up. Wow, cool artwork, an angel with burning wings. Maybe not the most outstanding idea, but looks good and fits the album well. Also, really nice booklet with lyrics included. I like lyrics, so that is important to me.\n\nVery well, on with the music, then. The album kicks off with \"I Witness\", a song that's fast from the very beginning, with guitars that goes higher and higher, building up to the point where Tony Martin's vocals come in. The start really works well, it kind of sets the norm of what will be. Lyrically, it's not a masterpiece, but it fit's well in with the theme of the album, which seems very dark if you compare it to other Sabbath releases. I myself have always been a Martin fan, so I guess it's no wonder that I love his technique when it comes to sing with emotion. This is one of the best tracks on the album.\n\nNext out is \"Cross of Thorns\", a kind of ballad-type song.It's much slower than the \"I Witness\", a nice contrast if you like. It starts with Martin singing pretty low and, again, of course, with emotion. He has a feeling to the singing that I felt Ozzy never achieved in his years with Sabbath. While ballads may not be Sabbath's cup of tea, they finish it without shame, and I restrain from calling it crappy, even though it isn't the best track on the album. And again, after a nice switch, we're bombarded with the next track, \"Psychophobia\", a really fast track with immense drumming by Bobby Rondinelli. I must say that I'm impressed by this guy, he does a very decent work, although he never could compete with Ward. The song itself doesn't bring me any special feeling, and somehow it feels like this song would have suited Ozzy's voice better than Martin's. All in all, it feels more like an Ozzy-type of song.\n\n\"Virtual Death\", the fourth track of the album, used to be a regular skipper of mine for a long time. The song starts with incredibly heavy bassplay by Butler. My God, is that bass filly, low and... I don't know. This track really screams doom metal. It's slow, and it doesn't get faster. And damn, the lyrics. So wonderful, you just got to love those. If you're at all in to doom, you should check this album out solely because of this track.\n\nAs for the rest of the album, there's not really much to mentoin. After \"Virtual Death\", the album's going down, with a kind of fill-it-out songs, which is a shame, since it starts out so strong. At least we have \"Dying for Love\", which starts with a beautiful solo by Iommi. It continues to be a full-time ballad, and the lyrics are so sweet it makes my stomach turn. Same goes for \"Immaculate Deception\", odd lyrics, but the song itself is pretty nice with some ok speed.\n\nOnly track that's really worth to mentoin is \"Cardinal Sin\", which is also pretty doomy at the start, but somehow they manage to ruin the atmosphere they have created, and the end it's almost pure shit. And the thing annoying me the most is the last track, \"Evil Eye\", which is basic \"women are evil\" Black Sabbath bullshit that they seem to have to put on every other album. It's a very mediocre song at it's very best.\n\nAt last, I must say that I'm glad I picked this album before I knew anything except the name of the band. That way, I didn't have to put un-realistic pressure on the album. I very well COULD say that it's under-rated, but why would I? I think it'll be better if you pick it up yourself, after telling yourself that it's only a few bucks, and that you could be pleasantly surprised. The chance is there, really. Trust me on that one. And while it isn't a \"Paranoid\", or even a \"Heaven and Hell\", it's most certainly no \"Forbidden\" either. With that knowledge you would think \u00edt's pretty safe to spend your money on this one. And why did I give it \"only 82\" when it's my favourite Sabbath album? Because I'm fucking tired of people that gives 90+ to every single CD they review. It's not THAT good.\n",
        "\nThe greatness of Sabotage is how different it is from any other Sabbath album with Ozzy, it's heavy like the others but what makes it great is the attack and effort on it. Starting with Volume 4, Sabbath began to experiment, however on Volume 4 and Sabbath Bloody Sabbath(which both are great albums) some of the experimenting lacked something. Whereas on Sabotage everything they did worked, and not only worked but worked to perfection, it's pure magic to the ears.\n\nFrom the spell-binding bone crushing riff of Hole In The Sky to the last blissful yet heavy notes of The Writ, everything here deserves praise. But the one thing that sets this album aside from the rest is not Tony Iommi's guitar work, or Bill Ward's heavy-hitting percussion or Geezer's thumping bass work and bizarre lyrics. No in fact it is something you do not commonly praise for being timeless or even classic, it's Ozzy's voice. Never again would Ozzy sound so hard and emotional in his vocals as he does here, sometimes coming across like a completely different man. Captured here in a still youthful age of only twenty-eight Ozzy gives a performance of a lifetime, and considering how he was the only aspect holding Sabbath back on the previous five albums, with him singing great it's no surprise why this album kicks so much ass.\n\nThe most prevalent objection against this record seems to be the production, often regarded as spiritually stagnant, drab and dreary and mundane, none of which are true. However, looking at the album title reminds us what the sound is intended for, malevolent bitterness is not what these songs depict but rather a central structure for the feelings of the protagonist in his tragic aftermath of wretchedness. Therefore, the aural presentation appropriately mirrors the anguish captured in the lyrical themes.\n\nWe begin this atrocious journey into the mind of Geezer Butler with the song Hole In The Sky, which is one of the heaviest songs not only by Sabbath's standards but for the time period. There was nothing more bleak and aggressive in 1975, casting forth touches of thrash metal, which would copied by countless bands ever since. This first track is carried by a wavy guitar line that is strengthened by Ozzy's woeful voice, while the chorus is perhaps the most stunning vocals ever put on record by Ozzy, mixing ruthless rage with sorrowful laments towards heaven. After a short classical piece, which abruptly stops HITS, we are given a riff bound to shake the earth.\n\nSymptom Of The Universe is the natural progression from Hole In The Sky, even more simplistic yet so brilliantly constructed that you can ignore the apparent lack of originality by the reminder that Sabbath single-handedly start all of this. The next fact to shoot down the idea that this song is not the benchmark of it's class is the crushing riff gallop that comes in at 3:36, before Iommi takes off in a piece of guitar wizardry that sets you up for... ...disaster. Not that the song gets bad, but it is the last thing you ever saw coming. From hard thrash to a beautiful acoustic track that sounds almost southern rock song, where Ozzy is still giving a grand performance.\n\nThe next song is summed up perfectly with it's odd title, Megalomania, dark and gloomy in every sense, it is here when the production takes that turn for sonically dreariness. The utter sadness in the words, cast forth by Ozzy's tearful voice brings about the pain, while his aggression in the chorus is a simple, solid rejection to what was believed to be a twisted illusion. Supported all the way up by a haze of delicate guitar lines and atmosphere, Ozzy soars, hitting all sad notes with unfathomable clarity amongst the sharp, piercing clash of ivory keys leading directly up to\u2026Metal. A tinker bell begins what will be another six minutes of all out humbling brutality delivered with a keen sense of melody, while Ozzy takes his aggressive vocals to new heights. In the end, ten minutes of strenuously eloquent rising action resulting in a empyrean combustion of cataclysmic dimensions.\n\nThrill Of It All has the unfortunate fate of following the unbelievable predecessor, so it comes across as a let down, but it is in no way 'filler'. The riffs are crunchy and heavy, the solos destroy and have tons of power, and Ozzy develops his evil vocals while still defying the barriers of possibility with his voice. And the fact that this was recorded in 1975(when it was still ok to be part metal, part undefined) just makes it better. Ozzy's voice at 2:12 is the best yet, only bested by his performance on the Writ.\n\nAfter aggression and ruthless brutality, to sheer depression masked with aggression, to personal story-telling, which is as dark as a story can descend comes a song that is as depressing as it is spiritual. Supertzar is the strangest but most haunting piece of music I think Sabbath has ever laid down, sounding like nothing before or after. It begins with a pseudo-heavy riff that rises and builds with a choir harmonizing beautifully with it, then comes that heavy quasi pentatonic scale at 1:17, but falls short of greatness. The song carries and is believed to get annoying while it portrays the depths of sadness, but at 2:08 that scale returns and this time delivers what it's meant to. The screams and mournful wails is one of the greatest climatic wordless vocals ever sung, simply put this is one of Sabbath's greatest instrumentals and is very underrated.\n\nAm I Going Insane is where the album slowly dips, not from the goofy music. No, the problem rests in the very odd gaping hole and the inability to maintain momentum between the past two points of destination. The mournful lament here ends on such a sad state of stillness that it even brings down the swift 'cheerful' guitar solo, luckily, this instance would be Sabbath's only exception here, as they would entirely redeem themselves on the epic closer... Low and behold, the deranged wails tower over the repeated chorus:\n\nArise the memorable bass riff and an identity starts to take shape, darkness is about swarm over the cell in which the protagonist sits still laughing and screaming from madness at the same time. Then the main riff blasts out of nowhere and we are finally given the reason for this characters fall into the depths of hell, which is saturated in a tale of misery and hate, born from frustration. It is here where Ozzy proves once and for all that he truly can sing, as he vocalizes the poetic lines with a different array of emotions that demand your attention. Rather it be tearful lines of monetary negligence or abuse told with the first few lines or the rageful lines of bitterness and animosity with lines like 'The anger I once had has came to a curse on you' and 'you're gonna get what is coming to you'. It is easy to see where this hopeless character's anger is directed at. Yet when it seems that the character is ready to break the chains and escape his cold bitter Hell he retreats to his now self-inflicted depravity, never able to tell the difference from the world outside his torture cell or the one he's in. This ending is undeniably one you wish would last forever but a disheartened growl, desperate cries of denial, resounding shrieks and a progressive riff later, one of Metal\u2019s most greatest songs and albums has resolved.\n\nI'm hard pushed to find many albums that flow as well as this one does, and even more pressed to find many albums that are as obviously underrated as this one is. It upped the game of heavy metal music in so many ways- production quality, greater musicianship and the vocal style, which you would not hear again by Ozzy until his 1983 solo album Bark At The Moon. This is a true classic album that still sounds truly brilliant to this day, and as such has received the highest rating possible. I highly recommend this to any sane person who likes good music, not just metal....\n",
        "\nThe later career of Black Sabbath is characterised by uneven uncertainty, and 1985\u2019s \u2018Seventh Star\u2019 is the most significant departure of the lot. In its favour, guitarist Tony Iommi wrote the album with the intention of it being his first \u2018solo\u2019 release, the band consisting of an entirely different line-up than was the norm for Sabbath, even in the turbulent revolving door period of the eighties, and the music following a lighter, poppier and more blues-oriented direction than the sludgy heavy metal of Iommi\u2019s previous work. Nevertheless, pressure from manager Don Arden resulted in the \u2018Seventh Star\u2019 release being credited informally as the twelfth Black Sabbath album, but credited specifically to \u2018Black Sabbath feat. Tony Iommi,\u2019 a peculiar choice of phrase considering Iommi is himself the only original Black Sabbath member present, and none apart from keyboard player Geoff Nicholls had been associated with the band prior to this.\n\nThe deliberate departure from the sound Iommi and his previous band members had pioneered and developed throughout the seventies and early eighties makes this a difficult album for long-time fans to appreciate, but the orientation towards a more commercial sounding form of rock would continue through the next three albums, assuring this record\u2019s influential place in the canon. I should probably point out at this stage that this is my least favourite Black Sabbath album for all the common reasons, but still has enough in its favour as a release that was attempting to diversify to rate it at least equally to the albums \u2018Technical Ecstasy\u2019 and \u2018Forbidden\u2019 that capture different incarnations of Black Sabbath at their most tired and apathetic.\n\nGlenn Hughes follows in the footsteps of Ian Gillan on the previous album as the second Deep Purple vocalist to act as temporary Black Sabbath frontman, and he performs about as well as can be expected in his capacity as third-rate sound-alike to the big names. The radio-friendly tone of most of the album, particularly the softer love songs, are sung just as anyone who\u2019s ever heard an Aerosmith or Bon Jovi ballad would expect, while the more traditionally hard rock pieces such as the title track sound the more like Deep Purple under Gillan than the bombastic operatics of earlier Sabbath favourite Ronnie James Dio, and the whole thing is miles from the nasal shrieks of the band\u2019s longest serving vocalist Ozzy Osbourne. Iommi\u2019s guitar is commendably modest for what was intended to be a solo album, primarily seeming content to riff along with the rhythm section and performing the occasional solo, and if anything this album is his least guitar-oriented up to this point.\n\nDave Spitz takes over bass guitar duties from old timer Geezer Butler, who departed along with original drummer Bill Ward after the previous album, and he performs with complete mediocrity. Slightly better is Dave Spitz on drums, although he is relegated to providing a slow beat most of the time, while the necessary dreamy eighties atmosphere is enhanced by Geoff Nicholls\u2019 polished keyboards, occasionally pushed to the forefront. These temporary Black Sabbath line-ups were always fairly disappointing, as a group of unconnected musicians are drafted into the studio and gradually fall off the world tour one by one, and it would take until the end of the decade for Iommi and co. to achieve a level of cooperative stability not seen since the Dio years.\n\nA simple glance at the track-list reveals the formulaic structure of this album, boasting a mix of epic songs lasting over five minutes for the hardcore fans, particularly the enigmatic \u2018Seventh Star\u2019 backed up by its Egyptian sounding precursor, with the fast-sounding \u2018In For the Kill\u2019 and \u2018Turn to Stone\u2019 balanced by the obvious ballads \u2018No Stranger to Love\u2019 and \u2018Angry Heart,\u2019 all edited to running times of 7\u201d perfection. While the album isn\u2019t entirely predictable, sometimes harking back to the old Sabbath sound presumed lost and other times, such as the final two tracks, defying expectation a little bit, this is primarily an album designed to sell well rather than an artistic statement, with recycled pop lyrics avoiding the confrontational pagan and drug themes the band is better known for.\n\nThere\u2019s still enough energy to keep things interesting for rock fans most of the time, particularly with songs like the afore-mentioned \u2018In for the Kill\u2019 and \u2018Turn to Stone\u2019 which play out almost exactly as I had imagined. The chorus vocals in the opening song are light and melodic enough to suit mainstream ears, but thankfully become a little less restrained as the song continues and Hughes starts getting into it. \u2018Turn to Stone\u2019 is even more hard-edged as the third track, keeping the energy levels up between the slower tracks two and four, but the structure and even the production sound make this sound more like classic Deep Purple than classic Black Sabbath, obviously enhanced by Hughes\u2019 delivery. Both songs feature medium length guitar solos that aren\u2019t particularly interesting in of themselves, but work as well as any others that escape Iommi\u2019s stumpy fingertips.\n\nBetween these, sounding very out of place but obviously attempting to snag casual listeners as early as possible, is the single \u2018No Stranger to Love.\u2019 Iommi opens with a slow solo, sounding more like the calculated soaring melodies of Pink Floyd\u2019s David Gilmour than his usual blues improvisation, while a background of keyboards sets the scene for this Hollywood-esque ballad that wouldn\u2019t be out of place in cheesy love scenes of contemporary films. Surprisingly, the music video isn\u2019t a montage of such scenes, but does feature actress Denise Crosby who would soon after star in Star Trek: The Next Generation. The slow drums, Bon Jovi vocals and minimal, always melodic guitars follow the tedious template for all songs of this type, and personally I find that it can\u2019t fade out soon enough.\n\nMy preferred section of the album is the middle, where something of the classic Sabbath sound shines through and Iommi tackles bolder territory. The pointlessly titled \u2018Sphinx: The Guardian\u2019 is a one-minute intro to the title track, ominously setting the scene for the coming storm with keyboards and windy sound effects alone, while \u2018Seventh Star\u2019 sees Iommi returning to the epic style of the classic \u2018Heaven and Hell\u2019 album. The song is slow paced, based on a bluesy riff that still retains elements of Iommi\u2019s much-imitated \u2018stoner\u2019 droning style, with Hughes providing his best vocals that sound more relaxed and casual compared to Dio\u2019s exhaustive falsetto. The keyboard provides an effective backdrop, dark and ominous in contrast to the light and airy backing of the earlier love song, and only resorts to a clich\u00e9d Egyptian melody a little towards the end (you know the one. Every metal band has its own Egyptian song that uses the same bloody tune somewhere, almost as bad as the nine-note ditty used to evoke China). The song perhaps lasts a little too long, not featuring the interesting diversity of previous epics, but is slow and relaxed enough that this doesn\u2019t present a problem.\n\nThe song that follows is even longer, and even more in line with the Dio era, and as such is my favourite song on the album, the only one really up to the standard of \u2018Heaven and Hell.\u2019The pop elements are still there in the vocal delivery and lack of off-putting jam sections or drastic rhythm changes, causing this song to feel a little more restricted than the long-term Sabbath fan is accustomed to, but in this case the accessibility is primarily in the song\u2019s favour. At medium speed, \u2018Danger Zone\u2019 is a faster mover than \u2018Seventh Star,\u2019 and the heavy guitar riffs are right at the forefront. \u2018Heart Like a Wheel,\u2019 the first of two surprising non-ballads with \u2018heart\u2019 in the title, is the most traditionally blues-based song on here, based largely on a plodding bass guitar with nicely dirty sounding production throughout, though it\u2019s a little tedious for my tastes. The good news is that Iommi really lets himself go here, breathing in the heavy stoner atmosphere and setting free those squealy, pointless, enjoyable guitar solos for much of the song. The guitars plod along to such an extent that it\u2019s not uncommon for me to space out completely and forget the song\u2019s even playing as it nears the end, the only clashing element being the contrasting clean vocals that sound out of place on this song only, which would be more suited to a heavy smoker or old man.\n\nThe title \u2018Angry Heart\u2019 implies something of a conflict between the style found earlier in track one with that of track two, and the end result is something like that. It\u2019s not a ballad, that duty falls a little onto the short final song \u2018In Memory...\u2019 which is more of a dreamy acoustic song than a cheesy love song in the vein of \u2018No Stranger to Love,\u2019 but it does commit the sin of including a Hammond organ (grr!), albeit quietly. The chorus is full-on Bon Jovi pop-rock, and the drums are quite nicely catchy. Both this and the next song are joined by the conceit of simply jumping from one to the other, making me question why this wasn\u2019t simply two halves of the same longer piece as I wondered for tracks four and five, but as the album is only thirty-five minutes long at nine tracks in any case, it was probably another stunt to attract customers to this dying band. The pace does slow down for the final song, marking a change after a few seconds, and the blend of acoustic guitar over electric is quite nice, but this song never really goes anywhere. Hughes seems intent on going out with a bang, holding and \u2018warbling\u2019 his notes (for wont of a more technical term), while Nicholls\u2019 keyboards set a pleasant, if unremarkable atmosphere.\n\nSo there you have it, a below-par release from a great band in serious decline, but also one that was unduly over-hyped as something it was not, namely a Black Sabbath album. The deviation would be more forgiveable if \u2018Seventh Star\u2019 was a truly independent anomaly in the Sabbath discography, but essentially this set the style for all of the subsequent albums up until the short-lived Dio reunion in 1992: commercial sounding rock that can barely be classified in the heavy metal genre Iommi and co. created in the early seventies, complete with soppy ballads and watered down guitars. The next vocalist Tony Martin would at least provide some consistency from \u2018The Eternal Idol\u2019 through to \u2018Tyr,\u2019 replacing these fickle Deep Purple throwaways, while Iommi\u2019s solo career wouldn\u2019t really take off for some years to come, eventually evolving into a far heavier form than the stinking MTV-oriented stuff on this record.\n\nAlmost all Black Sabbath albums are greatly inconsistent, which has always acted as part of their charm for me, as the contrast between classic rock songs and embarrassing failures keep the early albums endlessly entertaining. \u2018Seventh Star\u2019 fails so often not because it tries something new, but because it sticks to boring, over-used formulas created by other people, which Iommi, Glenn Hughes and those other blokes are only capable of mimicking, instead of trying something new with. Almost every song fades out after stretching its ideas to breaking point for lack of a strong ending, and the highest praise I can give is that whoever was in charge of these fades, presumably the producer, has a good grasp of average attention span, as nothing really outstays its welcome.\n\n\u2018Seventh Star\u2019 and \u2018Danger Zone\u2019 form a nice central section of twelve minutes or so that almost makes this album worth buying, but the rest is either too unremarkable or too truly terrible to waste time with. I guess \u2018No Stranger to Love\u2019 might not seem so terrible to people who are into that sort of thing, but for me it\u2019s a real abomination in the Sabbath discography. Apparently, this album was never released on CD in America after the original vinyl didn\u2019t sell too well, and like much of Iommi\u2019s output after Dio left the first time, is consigned to the vaults of the Rock \u2019n Roll Hall of Mediocrity.\n",
        "\nI am emotionally attached to this album; it\u2019s the first Black Sabbath album I ever purchased in the early \u201880s. Earlier I had only listened to a few tapes with some \u201cgreatest hits\u201d of Ozzy\u2019s era and I was familiarized enough with the early Sabbath sound.\n\nIn my humble opinion there are actually two heavy metal genres: the slow one and the fast one. The slow (today labeled as doom metal) has been pioneered by Sabbath, whilst the fast one has been popularized by Judas Priest. The artistic and commercial success of the latter inspired the great NWOBHM in the late \u201870s \u2013 early \u201880s. Although Black Sabbath have given us unforgettable pieces of the \u201cfast\u201d genre (remember \u201cParanoid\u201d, \u201cChildren of the Grave\u201d etc.), they are generally admired for their heavy, pondering, doomy works (\u201cBlack Sabbath\u201d, \u201cIron Man\u201d, \u201cHand of Doom\u201d and others). But with Dio as their frontman, whatever remained from their early doominess is gone! \u201cHeaven and Hell\u201d is fast, melodic, elaborated and - occasionally \u2013 even poppy (\u201cWishing Well\u201d and \u201cWalk Away\u201d)! In other words - it\u2019s NWOBHM! \n\nNonetheless \u201cHeaven & Hell\u201d is not merely Sabbath\u2019s attempt to succeed in the genre they invented; it is a great album itself. Iommi performs magnificently \u2013 the guitar work is probably the best he ever produced. The guitar intro to the \u201cChildren of the Sea\u201d is recognized by listeners with no particular interests in Metal. In fact it\u2019s their most recognizable song, coming second only to Paranoid. Yet, the album is rightly credited to Ronnie James Dio. Not only is he a singer (technically speaking, by far superior to Ozzy and arguably the best male Heavy Metal voice), but also an unusually talented songwriter. His literature interests are of course different than Geezer\u2019s, therefore the lyrical themes of Heaven & Hell are equally different that Sabbath\u2019s early works. The \u201cChildren of the Sea\u201d is a superb poetic metaphor (obviously my favorite song), but the album is not beyond criticism: \u201cLady Evil\u201d is apparently the opposite of Rainbow\u2019s \u201cLady of the Lake\u201d; \u201cNeon Knights\u201d is also supposed to be a metaphor, but it is practically meaningless. And talking about \u201cHeaven & Hell\u201d (the track), what the hell is the \u201cdancer\u201d? Apparently a random word to make a rime with the \u201canswer\u201d? Pity, for otherwise the track justifies its reputation and popularity. \n\nLet me conclude this short article with a few words about Sabbath\u2019s cover art. The \u201cHeaven and Hell\u201d cover art has been created by some Lynn Curlee; the painting was not originally purposed to be a cover, yet it fits perfectly and it continues a Sabbath tradition. There are various dreadful Sabbath covers (\u201cSabbath Bloody Sabbath\u201d, \u201cBlack Sabbath\u201d, \u201cMob Rules\u201d and \u201cBorn Again\u201d), but this one is humorous, without lightening the seriousness of the content. Black Sabbath are also well reputed for the names and covers of their live albums \u2013 but let me come to this subject when reviewing \u201cLive Evil\u201d!\n\nI am glad that this album also appeals to my teenager son. I let him pick from the store today\u2019s trends, i.e. weird Scandinavian bands with similar names, covers, lyrics and sounds. But take a piece of advice from a veteran: if you really want to enjoy and understand the genre, buy Black Sabbath (up to and including \u201cBorn Again\u201d), Judas Priest and Iron Maiden (their first four albums). Very little has been added since then (I recognize the originality and inspiration of thrash metal, though it\u2019s not my preference).\n",
        "\nNo living soul in 1970 knew what hit them when, on Friday February 13th, a low-budget recording named after the group of scraggly looking musicians hit the record stores. Critics lambasted every second of this forty minute release, middle-aged folks ignored it completely and those who did hear it wanted it banned forever. However due to the controversy the album everyone thought would join the ranks of obscurity climbed the charts and became forever loved and cherished by any inspiring person who were blessed to read between it's lines.\n\nWhile viewed as being overly satanic in the beginning, many began to see the importance of making music that reflected their opinions about the world for which they choose. A world where little or no light shines, mankind has little or no chance of happiness and the only profitable ones were those causing the chaos to begin with. Long before the age of it being 'acceptable' for people to run around and scream about, 'Conspiracy' or 'political corruption', was an album that was saturated in that very topic.\n\nHowever what this release did do was give hope to those who sought someone who could not only share their woeful tales of hopelessness and brutality, but also give them the right to stand up and make music about it.\n\nThere really is no point in naming the best tracks on the album as they are all pure pleasure to the ears. From the opening thunderstorm of the album/bands namesake to the closing seconds whatever song is on the release you have, there is a sense of hope in the bleak atmosphere this creates. Ozzy's voice is in top-notch shape and delivers a performance for the ages, painting out the woeful tales of drugs, abuse and sorcery with his delivery. Geezer's never-ending bass underlining is prominent throughout and supplies an excellent source of groove and melody for guitarist Tony Iommi to build on, but also gives a highly respected and often copied bass solo before the best song on the album: NIB.\n\nBut the true highlights here are:\n\n1) Bill Ward's Drums. Not just because he is a key figure in the historical importance of this album but he was truly the first drummer to sound like he did. Rather it be him hammering out tremendous heart-stopping drum fills or melodic drum patterns that fit any tempo in the songs, he delivers them with excellent accuracy and emotion. It is true to say he is one of the few drummers in no matter what style of metal who has a huge importance instead of just simply being there to support the band.\n\n2) The Musicianship. While the material may seem primitive or frail compared to nowadays tales of metallic brutality, one could never deny the musicianship the band had at such an early age. Each song is very fine tuned and the band works so well together that each song can be considered the high-point. Even if Warning carries on forever with a guitar solo it's still easy to see how the band could do anything, they could do Gospel or Doris Day, and it would be respected.\n\nIf you have not heard this album, then you are missing out on the best of the three classic Sabbath albums and one of the best of the bands career. It's no surprise why thirty-seven years after it's entrance in music it is regarded by fans and critics(now anyways) as a legendary release. Sure it's important because it started all that we know as metal but because while almost all have tried, no one has ever come close to making a release this important and successful at the same time.\n",
        "\nMost casual Black Sabbath listeners seem to think that Black Sabbath is Ozzy Osbourne, and Black Sabbath without Ozzy never existed. They never look into the 80s, when metal legend Ronnie James Dio joined the band. I love the Ozzy era of Black Sabbath, but Dio is up there. I can't decide which one I like best, since they're both very different.\n\nThis is the perfect album for \"converting\" Ozzy fans into Dio fans. It has Dio singing Ozzy's classic songs, like Paranoid, War Pigs, Iron Man, and more, and singing songs from the albums he's featured on (at the time), Heaven and Hell and Mob Rules.\n\nDio is much different from Ozzy. Dio has a way better voice, and Ozzy is more fit for their \"doom\" era. Both are amazing for the music that was played when they were vocalists. Dio somehow pulls off Ozzy's vocals flawlessly, despite the extreme difference of the two vocalists. He doesn't try to copy Ozzy, but he tries to make the songs his own... and it works.\n\nThe recording quality on this album is good. Typical live album production, with the crowd still audible. Some small chat between each song, and some parts where Dio has the audience sing along (such as Heaven and Hell). There is one medley in here, with Heaven and Hell split with Sign of the Southern Cross in between the two parts of Heaven and Hell. There is a small part with some improvisation by Tony Iommi, and it's great. Definitely sounds like old Sabbath.\n\nThe performance is great. The band nailed all their parts (naturally, it is Black Sabbath after all). Dio stole the show, as I described earlier. \n\nThe best thing about this CD is the track list. Probably the best setlist Black Sabbath could have come up with at the time of this recording.\n\nAny Black Sabbath fan should check this out. Even if you're only into 70s Sabbath. Hear the songs sung by a different vocalist that isn't the local cover band at the bar. It is worth your money, I assure you.\n",
        "\nWhile most people were introduced to Black Sabbath by any of their first six albums, or maybe their most popular compilation: We Sold Out Souls For Rock And Roll or maybe even Heaven And Hell. Few were introduced by the band or even like the albums released after the departure of Ronnie James Dio. I was introduced to Sabbath with this album when the song 'Digital Bitch' was played on the radio and I think this is a mighty fine way to be introduced to the band, as this is the closest album to their most harraled releases. Dark, Morbid and horribly woeful, set against the back drop of a very plain and dated production job. While some will complain that the tracks are bleak and boring or even lifeless, the material is actually quite strong and direct. One only needs to look at the album cover and title to be reminded why this album is saturated in darkness and gloom.\n\nTrashed kicks the album off with a fast jagged riff reminiscent of \"Neon Knights\" or \"Turn Up The Night\" along with Ian's ear-piercing scream to remind us that Sabbath was making a strong statement here. The lyrics are direct and very literal with a tale about heavy drinking and driving that ended up with him trashing a car. The track is pure energy with a killer riff by Tony and fiery vocals from Ian. \n\nMuch like \"E5150\" on Mob Rules, or even 'Embryo' on Master Of Reality. \"Stonehenge\" is used as a segue into the next 'full' track and was also used as the band's intro on the tour and leads into..... Disturbing The Priest, which is perhaps the worst song on the album. It's a throbbing mid tempo number with sludgy riffs, slow atmospheric sections with contrast as we get plenty of evil laughter and demonic cries mixed with some quiet singing. Bill's awesome drum work is the true highlight here\n\nLike previously pin-pointed on \"Stonehenge\", the next track, \"The Dark\" serves as the intro to... Zero The Hero, which is probably the best known track on the album. Tony's primitive chugging riff, which could have easily fit on Paranoid or Master Of Reality, is underlined nicely by Geezer's driving bass. It does become quite repetitive and the idea is beaten into the ground by the length of track, standing at seven-and-a-half minutes. The solo in the middle is pure bliss, complete with cautious effect pedals to add to the snarling tone set forth by Geezer's almost-psychedelic bass line.\n\nDigital Bitch is a fast-paced rocker with lyrics denouncing the idea of someone, whom is born into riches, having any kind of integrity. This is one of the better tracks on the album, and the ending with Ian screaming \"BITCH BITCH BITCH!\" over and over gives this a great atmospheric feel. The verses head bang with authority and Bill is drumming like a madman. Apart from \"Thrashed\" this is a very catchy song.\n\nHot Line is another fast-paced rocker, with a riff borrowed by so many since 1983, with it's amazing simplicity. Geezer has a grooving bass line, Tony has two awesome solos, Bill's drumming seems quite influenced by Jazz and Ian screams like a banshee, especially on the end, which seem to meet brand new heights. This is also a better song on the album and gives further proof that the second side is far better than the first.\n\nKeep It Warm is the obligatory ballad in the same tradition of Heaven And Hell and Mob Rules, ending with a slower song, but this time it's a down tempo ballad. This is a heartfelt tune with a bluesy feel providing a sense of sadness and understanding for a loved one. A nice downtime kind of track to end the album.\n\nYou may notice that the title track is not in the correct spot and this is due to me thinking it would have made a better closer, not just because of it's atmosphere but because it's the best song on the album. I will even go as far as saying this is the third best song on the bands career, only bested by the masterpieces, \"Nightwing\" and \"Cloak And Dagger\" from the \"Headless Cross\" album.\n\nAll I can say for those who haven't heard this track is: Make sure your not depressed when hearing this woeful tales, as it goes through phase after phase of pessimism. Feel your romantic hardships brought to life as you are hammered by the pounding drums. Feel your buried rage manifest with the aggressive screamed chorus, your heart becomes the target of the 'Mutant Gods' as they 'control your mind and use your mind for fortune and fame. You'll likely find your freedom become bloodless, like 'Grey and plastic retards all floating in circles'. And as your soul drifts admist the 'Fruits of new sensations\", the final verses cement the evil deeds with a riff cast forth straight from the depths of Hell. I'm not kidding, the way this track flows is one of the most morbidly beautiful successes in music ever! And remember, this was released in 1983, not 2004, when all music is about is life being 'shitty'. The song ends with a minute and a half guitar solo that is so beautifully meticulous and precise, it's gut wrenching and sorrowful, yet brightly optimistic in it's delivery. Pure slab of taste and class, never bested by anything that preceded it.\n\nBorn Again is Sabbath's darkest, thickest, most evil-sounding slab of metal with Ian adding a maniacal vocal by screaming, howling, and wailing like he's possessed. The classic Sabbath core return to their bluesy roots of the Ozzy-era albums. It's too bad this lineup fell apart, as it probably would have resulted in more great albums. But the only good thing about this being a 'One Off' album is it EVENTUALLY led to the Tony Martin Era, which is arguably the greatest era Sabbath has/will ever see.\n",
        "\nWith TYR, Black Sabbath saw Tony Iommi, Tony Martin and Cozy Powell joined by ex-Whitesnake bassist Neil Murray to form what some consider the most underrated lineup of Sabbath. TYR is certainly the best album to feature Tony Martin as vocalist and is another great album in the long discography of Black Sabbath. Powell delivers some fine performances, and as always Tony Iommi cranks out the best metal riffery this side of Valhalla. \n\nThe album is almost a concept album, as several of the songs link together to form a tale of Vikings and Nordic Gods. As such, TYR is Sabbath's contribution to the \"Viking Metal\" genre. Feeling tired of the devils and demons of previous works, the band gave Martin free reign to work with this lyrical concept. The result is a brilliant and very heavy album.\n\nOpening with \"Anno Mundi,\" the song begins with acoustic guitar before kicking in with Iommi's trademark crunching riffs. Next is \"The Lawmaker,\" one of Sabbath's fastest tracks, with a scorching intro solo and some nice keyboard touches by Geoff Nichols midsong. \"Jerusalem\" is a midtempo power metal song followed by the total doom of \"The Sabbath Stones.\" Iommi's classic riffing is all over this one, certainly one of the strongest tracks on the album. \n\nSide two sees a trilogy of sorts: \"The Battle of Tyr\", \"Odin's Court\", and \"Valhalla\"seem to blend into one long song. This is where the Nordic myth theme appears. Interestingly enough, \"Odin's Court\" seems to have been something of a minor hit is Southeast Asia, don't know if the band knows this. \"Feels Good to Me\" is the power ballad of the album, a melodic song which the band made a video for. The band returns to heaviness for album closer \"Heaven in Black,\" a powerful track about Russian history with a great chorus by Martin. \n\nOne minor complaint about TYR is that the bass guitar is mixed a bit low in the mix (Neil Murray himself has voiced complaint about this). It's not like it's Metallica's \"And Justice For All...\" or anything, just turn the eq on the bass up if it's not enough for you. I've never had a problem with it, and I've regarded TYR highly since it's release. For any fan of traditional heavy metal, TYR is a must!\n",
        "\nRonnie James Dio's brief stint back into Sabbath showed that the master was still able to deliver the goods with an age far beyond the average peak of a metal singer. While Dio has proven many times that he's almost invincible (he still delivers to this day - just check the new Heaven & Hell single \"The Devil Cried\" - but that's another review) \"Dehumanizer\" is definitely one of the best Black Sabbath albums and also one of the strongest in Dio's entire career. \n\nThis is, without a doubt, one of (if not) the best traditional heavy metal album(s) of 1992. We all know that the early 90s were a bad time for heavy metal since the uprising Grunge scene took the mainstream by force, but \"Dehumanizer\" is a gleaming gem amongst the masses of so called \"alternative rock\" artists. \n\nSongs like the grand opener \"Computer God\" are incredibly dark and haunting while being witty in the lyrical department (the whole album features great poetry) and strong in the songwriting. \"Dehumanizer\" is also one of the heavier Black Sabbath albums, featuring crunchy doom-style riffs and a fierce vocal delivery by Dio. \n\n\"After All (The Dead) is probably the strongest song lyrical-wise, featuring awesome lines like: \n\n\"What do you say to the dead? Is there a place where it's burning?\nIt says in a book I once read; yes there's a chance of returning\"\n\nBrilliant. The metaphors and hidden meanings behind many of the songs featured on this album are rare gems of lyrical excellence. Definitely a highlight of this album. \n\nIommi's and Geezer's performances are once again stellar, wiping the floor with many of modern songwriters who simply don't even possess half of their songwriting qualities; Geezer's bass intro in \"Master of Insanity\" and Iommi's guitar solo at the end of \"Computer God\" being great examples of this. The overall guitar work drinks heavily from the doom-style, showing an even darker faceted side of Black Sabbath. Many songs are slow- to mid-paced, filled with a fairly large amount of bludgeoning and delightful riffs. \n\nThere are no bad songs to be found here, but the definitive highlights are \"Computer God\", \"After All (The Dead)\", \"Master of Insanity\" and \"I\". \n\nIf you enjoy classic heavy metal, which is quite a bit darker than usual, then this album is definitely recommended. Another shining moment in Dio's career.\n",
        "\nIt's about time that they came out with a Dio-years greatest hits package; since they have 385 compilations of the Ozzy Osbourne years (give or take). I was nervous when I first heard that they were putting one out, as many greatest hits CD's of bands that didn't really have hit singles typically do a poor job of selecting the band's \"best\" tracks. \n\nThankfully \"The Dio Years\" is nearly perfect in its selection of songs, they even included a song that I figured was one of their lesser-known songs, \"Falling Off the Edge of the World.\" Despite not being as widely publicized as \"Iron Man,\" or even Black Sabbath with Dio's \"Children of the Sea,\" this is probably one of the best songs that the band has ever written, with Dio, Ozzy, or any other singer. Of course, that's not to say that this album is made up of all sleeper songs, and it's kind of hard to screw this up, considering that this basic lineup only did three albums together, but I digress. Classics from all three albums like \"Heaven and Hell,\" \"Voodoo,\" and \"I\" are incorperated; including a live-version of \"Children of the Sea\" from the amazing \"Live Evil.\"\n\nThe only two glaring omissions are \"Sign of the Southern Cross\" and \"Computer God.\" The former isn't even such a bad thing because the album it came off of, \"The Mob Rules,\" is so good that any self-respecting metalhead should own it, even if they get this best-of album. The exclusion of \"Computer God\" isn't so forgivable, however, because not only is it the opener off of \"Dehumanizer,\" it's arguably the best song and by far one of the most diverse. Since \"After All (The Dead)\" and \"I\" were also included, \"Computer God\" would have made the purchase of \"Dehumanizer\" senseless, as the only worthwhile songs on that album would have been included here. Replacing \"Computer God\" is the throwaway \"Time Machine,\" most likely added solely because it was a single off of the album. \n\nThe new songs are fantastic. They were all recorded with the \"Mob Rules\" and \"Dehumanizer\" lineup, minus keyboardist Geoff Nichols. Actually, there aren't any keyboards at all, which makes Tony Iommi's heavy-as-fuck guitar sound all the more potent. \"The Devil Cried\" and \"Shadow of the Wind\" are slow and bludgeoning tracks with several classic riffs and some of Iommi's better leads. \"Ear in the Wall\" is more up-tempo, yet is just as memorable as its two slower counterparts, once again the leads are tremendous. \n\nTony Iommi seemed to be leaning more towards a hard-rock direction with his last solo album with Glenn Hughes, but here he shows he can still destroy any modern guitarist. Compare the quality and heaviness of these riffs with anything Lamb of God or Chimaira are putting out and it is obvious that Tony Iommi, however many albums and countless riffs later, can still destroy any frauds out there with one smooth stroke on his guitar.\n\nWhat we have here is one of those rare instances where the greatest hits album is actually worth purchasing even if you own all of the studio albums from which most of the songs on here are taken from. Get it as something to pop into your car stereo when you want to impress your friends or something to put in your boom box when you're washing your car. Just get it, dammit.\n",
        "\nIn September 1972 Black Sabbath released their fourth album fittingly titled \u201cVol. 4\u201d. \u201cVol. 4\u201d is in many ways more of the same from Sabbath, then again it is completely different. This album is much more of a hard rock album, with many influences of psychedelia, which may explain the experimental nature of this album.\n\n\u201cVol. 4\u201d is the first album to show signs of decline within Sabbath, but put that statement into perspective. This is Sabbath taking 5 steps back after making 100 steps forward. \n\nAnother sign of decline is the lack of utterly memorable riffs. \u201cVol. 4\u201d still has its share of good riffs however this is not the riffing monsters \u201cParanoid\u201d or \u201cMaster of Reality\u201d were. Also, after it seemed that Sabbath had abolished those annoying aimless jams to a minimum on \u201cMaster of Reality\u201d, they fall back and provide us with the electronic exploration that is \u201cFX\u201d. \n\nWhile on other albums it seemed that the band became more proficient as instrumentalists from the last album, that\u2019s not case on \u201cVol. 4\u201d, they tuned down, and slowed down. Ozzy Osbourne\u2019s vocals are beginning to become whiney and electronic, however it is not ad nauseam as it is on later releases. Tony Iommi has seemed to have run out of those amazing riffs he conjured on previous efforts, but his performance hasn\u2019t suffered at all. Bassist Geezer Butler again provides the steady performance which he has always given, and while nothing special, is another rock solid effort under his belt. Bill Ward, reverts to his jam style once again, which on this album, works to a fairly good effect.\n\nThe lyrical themes and mood of \u201cVol. 4\u201d pertains mostly overtly drug influenced chaos of the mind. While other albums pertained to depression, society, and some sci-fi, \u201cVol. 4\u201d goes very little into that area, and it seems to be obsessed with itself and its drugs.\n\nAnd yes while this album has some weaker material compared to its predecessors, it has a handful of very worthwhile tunes from the opener \u201cWheels of Confusion/The Straightener\u201d to the (utterly doomy) closer \u201cUnder the Sun/Every Day Comes and Goes\u201d. But it also has its duds too, namely \u201cFX\u201d and the ballad \u201cChanges\u201d. Also, an unexpected bright spot is the instrumental \u201cLaguna Sunrise\u201d however, the key tracks to this album are the middle two tracks of \u201cSupernaut\u201d and \u201cSnowblind\u201d.\n\nSo, all in all, Black Sabbath\u2019s \u201cVol. 4\u201d is yet another quality release from the Sab Four, even if it doesn\u2019t live up to its predecessors. So while maybe time was catching up with Sabbath this manages to still be very worthy of its namesake.\n",
        "\nHeadless Cross finds Black Sabbath returning to form after several years of unstalbe lineups and some less-than-well-received albums. Along with mainstay guitarist Tony Iommi and singer Tony Martin, the album marks the debut of legendary drummer Cozy Powell. Powell's powerful drumming certainly complements the heaviness of the riffs found on the album, which features some of Tony Martin's best vocal work. Longtime keyboardist Geoff Nicholls is also present. \n\nThe weak link in the player's lineup is bassist Laurence Cottle, who does a decent job of replicating Geezer Butler's bass style (see the title track and \"Nightwing\"), but is really only a session member. Aside from that, Headless Cross marks a return to stability that the band had been lacking for sometime. \n\nMusically, \"Headless Cross\" is in the vein of the classic Heaven and Hell album. After creepy intro \"The Gates of Hell,\" the title track kicks in with a drum intro and some killer riffing from Iommi, followed by the triplet bass sound such as found on the song \"Heaven and Hell.\" Lyrically, the song tells the story of the medieval town called Headless Cross, which was devastated by the black plague. The town's inhabitants went to the hilltop to pray for deliverance, but no god saved them and they died of the plague. Dark lyrics mark this album, indeed one of Sabbath's most Satanic releases. \n\nTony Martin is in fine form on all tracks, and those who consider him little more than a Dio-clone should listen to \"Kill in the Spirit World,\" where he hits and holds some amazingly high notes. \"Devil and Daughter\" is another fine vocal performance, and Martin shines on all the tracks, as does the band itself. The albums shows that the band really took their time in songwriting, to deliver a heavy album that would put them back in the public consciousness. A special treat is the appearance of Queen guitarist Brian May, playing the guitar solo on the excellent track \"When Death Calls\". If you didn't know it was May you wouldn't know it wasn't Iommi, the solo fits Sabbath's style that well. \n\nTony Iommi once again shows why he is the greatest heavy metal riffwriter of all time. \"Black Moon\" sounds like it could've been on Heaven and Hell, and the guitar solo is awesome. \"Call of the Wild\" is a decent track but not as essential as the rest of the album, while album closer \"Nightwing\" is a fine mix of dark moodiness and heavy riffing. \n\nSome fans have said that \"Headless Cross\" is the only Martin-era album which can be considered a classic. This is debateable, but in any case it is a fine album from first-class musicians, and this lineup of Sabbath (with only a change of bass players) would continue to tour and record music through the late eighties. If you like dark and gloomy metal with wicked lyrics and otherworldly imagery, Headless Cross is very well worth your time.\n",
        "\n\"The Eternal Idol\" is then first Black Sabbath album to feature vocalist Tony Martin, who would sing on on several more Sabbath releases. Martin's addition bought some much needed stability to the band, but the rest of the lineup seemed to be in flux at the time. This album comes off as more of a Tony Iommi solo album than a true Sabbath album (the liner notes list Iommi as \"the player\", with other members listed simply as \"players\") but there are some good songs here. \n\nIt's difficult to know who actually played on what track. Both Dave Spitz and Bon Daisley played bass, Eric Singer plays drums while Bev Bevan is listed as having played \"percussion.\" There were even two singers involved: Ray Gillan recorded the vocals but then left before the album's release, Iommi then choosing to bring in Martin to rerecord the vocals. So it's difficult to find any kind of band identity here, a problem which plagued Sabbath through the mid-eighties. \n\nMusically, there are songs that hearkend to Sabbath's previous greatness. \"The Shining\" is an idea originating from Ian Gillan's days in the band, and is a strong opening track. Another personal favorite is \"Ancient Warrior,\" and closing title track reflects the dark mood found in earlier Sabbath works. \"Glory Ride\" has a great chorus and some heavy riffing, as does the very heavy \"Nightmare.\" \"Lost Forever\" is a fast-paced song with a great guitar solo. And instrumental \"Scarlet Pimpernel\" is a fine piece of guitar work from Iommi.\n\nOther songs on the album fall somewhat short of the heaviness Sabbath is best known for. Perhaps Iommi was attempting to fit in with the mainstream metal of the mid-eighties. \"Born to Lose\" and \"Hard Life to Love\" sound like they would've fit better on previous Sabbath album, (originally meant to be released as a Toni Iommi solo album) \"Seventh Star.\" But the songs are decent rockers, and overall \"Eternal Idol\" is a well-written, heavy and at times moody album. The only problem is the instable lineup, which as I've already said makes it difficult to find any kind of band identity. \n\n\"Eternal Idol\" is a good start for Tony Martin, who had the unenvious task of stepping into the shoes of some of metal's best-known vocalists. That he had the courage to do it says much for his strength as a performer and person. This album sees Sabbath finding some solid musical ground after several years of \"revolving door\" lineups, and with Martin as vocalist the band would continue to gather strength through the eighties and into the nineties.\n",
        "\n\"Seventh Star\" was initially to be a Tony Iommi solo album, before pressure from the record company forced it's release under the Black Sabbath name. Musically it doesn't really fit in with the rest of the Sabbath catalog, and the album has somewhat of a bad reputation with some fans. Certainly not the best representation of Black Sabbath, but there are some decent tracks. \n\nAfter a few false starts, 1986 finds guitarist Tony Iommi the sole original member of Black Sabbath. Iommi, along with longtime keyboardist Geoff Nicholls, recruited some impressive musicians for the album: drummer Eric Singer (later of Kiss), bassist Dave Spitz, and former Deep Purple bassist/vocalist Glenn Hughes. The album itself shows some diversity, with typical heavy numbers such as opener \"In For The Kill,\" \"Turn to Stone,\" and \"Danger Zone,\" the mysterious title track and instrumental \"Sphinx,\" the bluesy \"Heart Like a Wheel\" (which shows that Hughes was a logical follow-up to ex-vocalist Ian Gillan), and ballads \"No Stranger to Love\" and \"In Memory.\" \n\nSadly, it seems that the heavier songs lack some punch in comparison with previous Sabbath efforts, or at least aren't as groundbreaking. And \"No Stranger to Love,\" for which a video was made, is probably why this album sometimes gets lumped in with the \"hair metal\" genre, although I'd hardly call the album \"hair metal.\" So the strong points of the album are the title track, \"Heart Like a Wheel,\" and album closer \"In Memory,\" featuring a fine vocal performance from Hughes. \n\nI've always liked \"Seventh Star;\" there are some good songs, and the album featured a competent if unstable band lineup. If we compare this to the heaviness of previous Sabbath albums then we set ourselves up for disappointment. Yet if we can listen to this as the Tony Iommi solo album which it truly is it can be enjoyable. The fact that Iommi and Hughes have recorded two fine albums since this album's release says something about their working chemistry. Ozzy purists will probably forever revile \"Seventh Star,\" but rather than dismissing it because of what you may have been told, give the album a chance. Listen with an open mind and you may be pleasantly surprised by the album's diversity and strong musical performances by the band members.\n",
        "\n\"Mob Rules,\" Black Sabbath's tenth studio album and second to feature former Elf/Rainbow vocalist Ronnie James Dio, sees the band making some changes from it's predecessor, \"Heaven and Hell.\" Most noticeable is the addition of drummer Vinnie Appice, who replaced original drummer Bill Ward. Musically it seems the band is going for faster numbers and tighter song arrangement, although there is no lack of Sabbath's trademark gloom and doom. \n\nMuch like the previous album, \"Mob Rules\" starts off in high gear with the fast-paced \"Turn Up the Night.\" Several classic tracks follow: \"Voodoo,\" \"The Sign of the Southern Cross,\" dark instrumental E5150 and another fast number, title track \"Mob Rules\" These songs demonstrate just why Tony Iommi was (and still is) metal's premiere guitarist. Not only does he crank out the best riffs in metal, but his lead playing in untouchable. Whether it's a fast or slow number, Iommi knows exactly what notes to play, and this album undoubtedly features some of his best solo work. \n\n\"Country Girl\" shows Dio's strength as vocalist, contrasting between the raw verses and melodic vocal section mid-song. \"Slipping Away,\" is on the rockier side of things, and next track \"Falling off the Edge of the World,\" although not the best-known number off the album, is probably it's best song. After an acoustic guitar intro featuring violin (played by whom?), the band crashes into a slow and heavy drum-driven section (Appice is a powerful player and fit Sabbath's style perfectly, bringing some renewed energy to the band), before breaking into a full-speed assault on the senses. Dio's lyrics tell a dark tale of rejection and loss, consistent with Sabbath's works from previous albums. The album finishes with \"Over and Over' another excellent performance by Dio and one of Iommi's most underrated solos. Listen to the end guitar solo and spot the part where the guitar fretboard actually catches fire! Absolutely amazing playing from Iommi, godfather of metal guitar. \n\n\"Mob Rules\" may not be viewed as classic in the way that \"Heaven and Hell\" seems to be, probably because it's impossible to top such a legendary album. But perhaps in some ways it is better. The album certainly contains as many classic songs as \"H&H\". The crunchier production sound is appropriate for the material contained on the album, really bringing out the guitar sizzle. In any case it is a fine follow-up and another triumph for the revitalized, Dio-fronted version of metal's quintessential band, Black Sabbath.\n",
        "\n\"Never Say Die\" is Ozzy Osbourne's studio last album with Black Sabbath (not including a couple of studio tracks found on the live album \"Reunion\"). By the end of the seventies, tensions between band members became so strained that Ozzy would be dismissed from the band after a tour for this album. \n\nThe music on \"Never Say Die\" is a mixed bag, and like underrated predecessor \"Technical Ecstacy\" finds Sabbath exploring some new musical ground. However unlike \"Technical,\" Sabbath has lost the focus on their classic heavy sound. The album features a couple of ballads and jazz experimentations. This digression from the metal style is evident on several of the tracks. Songs on the lighter side include \"Junior's Eyes,\" \"Air Dance,\" \"Over to You,\" and jazz instrumental \"Breakout,\" which features a horn section. \n\nBut just because several of the tracks can't rightly be called heavy metal doesn't mean that the album sucks. All of the aforementioned songs are fine compositions, although \"Over to You\" may be my least favorite Sabbath song ever. \"Beautiful\" wouldn't be a word often used to describe Sabbath's music, but \"Air Dance\" is indeed a beautiful, sad and melancholy track about lost youth and dreams of yesterday. \n\nAnd there's no lack of heaviness:The opening title track is upbeat and features some great riffing and melodic chordwork from Tony Iommi. \"Johnny Blade\" is one of the album's heaviest songs, a misanthropic tale of life on the streets, with a menacing keyboard intro from session keyboardist Don Airey (later of Rainbow and Deep Purple). \"A Hard Road' is a strong rocker which finishes with a singalong chorus, and the very heavy and doomy \"Shockwave\" lyrically could be 'Black Sabbath\" (the song) part two. The album finishes with \"Swinging the Chain,\" a solid if unspectacular rock song sung by drummer Bill Ward (Ozzy is conspicuous in his absence here). \n\nSadly, \"Never Say Die\" has for years been trashed by critics and fans alike. If one approaches the album with an open mind, and enjoys the music rather than focusing on the fact that this is the original lineup's swansong, one will find much variety to enjoy here.\n",
        "\nTechnical Ecstacy,\" Black Sabbath's seventh studio album, is a very misunderstood and underappreciated album. Released at the height of the punk movement and just as disco was beginning it's ascent to popularity, the album was very much out-of-style and commercially was less successful than previous albums.\n\nSad, because there is much heaviness to enjoy here. Side one (of the cassette copy, at least; the CD starts with \"Back Street Kids.\") begins with \"All Moving Parts(Stand Still), a futuristic, Orwellian-themed track and a fine example of the crushing heavy metal sound Sabbath is known for. Featuring some excellent bass playing from Geezer Butler and scorching lead guitar playing from Tony Iommi, the song is a fine example of the \"technical\" style found herein. \"Rock and Roll Doctor\" also lives up to it's name, a grooving, almost boogie-style number. \n\nNext is \"She's Gone,\" which, although a ballad, is the most depressing song ever written! And as such it fits perfectly with Sabbath's doom metal style. \"Dirty Women\" returns to the heavy direction, a tale of Osbourne's late-night search for female companionship. \"Dirty Women\" is another live favorite, featuring at the end of the song an amazing extended guitar solo from Tony. 'Back Street Kids\" is another solid metal song about rebellion and the rock lifestyle. \"You Won't Change Me\" begins with one of Iommi's doomiest riffes ever before mellowing a bit, another fine number and a great vocal performance from Ozzy. \n\n\"It's Alright\" is drummer Bill Ward's debut as lead vocalist, another ballad which may be atypical of Sabbath's style but is a fine song nonetheless. The album ends with \"Gypsy,\" featuring Ward's best drum work on the album and Ozzy's account of a mysterious, fortune-teiing female. \n\nCritics of this album need to listen to the music, rather than comparing it to whatever music was popular in the mainstream or focusing on deteriorating relationships within the band. \"Technical Ecstacy\" does not deserve its somewhat bad reputation, for it is a fine album featuring some great heavy metal songs. The album also displays a growing diversity and need to explore new musical styles while remaining in the context of what Black Sabbath is best appreciated for. Simply put, this album jams and I highly recommend it to any Sabbath/metal fan.\n",
        "\nBuilding upon their groundbreaking debut Sabbath returned with their heralded classic \u201cParanoid\u201d. Even more awe-inspiring than the sheer brilliance of the music, is how quickly they did it, taking less than a year after their debut. \n\n\u201cParanoid\u201d is easily Sabbath\u2019s most popular and instantly recognizable album, which leads to the question of why? Well, while no individual reason can be pointed out, a combination of many may have contributed. \n\nThe improved songwriting skills of the band are the most apparent feature of this album. Not only is there more focus, the aimless jams of their debut are shortened and feel as though they have much more direction than simply being there, but there is more skill. Another notable is the riffs on this album; this contains what might be metals most distinguishable riff in \u201cIron Man\u201d.\n\nAnother improvement of the band is their respective instrumental proficiency; each man has bettered himself on this album. From Ozzy\u2019s voice, which has more power and capabilities than before, to Tony Iommi\u2019s signature guitar sound which is firmly establishes itself on this album, as if the first one wasn\u2019t enough. At this point Geezer Butler still seems to be the most proficient player of the band, while Bill Ward\u2019s drumming is much more rock focused than the jazzy feel it sometimes took on the first album. \n\nAnd as for the sound, it has evolved, but hasn\u2019t been refined. While still in the general area of the same blues based music of their debut, \u201cParanoid\u201d has a distinctly heavier and doomier sound than their debut. This is still technically simple material, but in many ways it adds to the overall mood of the album.\n\nThe lyrical themes of \u201cParanoid\u201d are utterly unrelentingly, depressingly dark and sullen, with the first hand experience of a war torn country helping build this up, and the ever present influence of drugs. Maybe because this was actually hardships that these men went through, they could deliver these lyrics in a convincing fashion.\n\nThe single most signifying part of \u201cParanoid\u201d is the three headed monster of \u201cWar Pigs\u201d, \u201cParanoid\u201d, and \u201cIron Man\u201d. When someone brings up Black Sabbath those three songs are what more than likely come to mind, and to think that they came from one half of one album, let alone a career. That doesn\u2019t mean any of the rest is filler by any means, \u201cElectric Funeral\u201d, \u201cHand of Doom\u201d, and \u201cFairies Wear Boots\u201d are all quality material. \n\nEverything on \u201cParanoid\u201d adds up to become more than just an album, it is a landmark, each song builds upon each other to create something larger and more menacing. Something about the urgency and simplicity that the message is delivered adds to the effect and makes for an honestly brutal listen, in a good way of course. \u201cParanoid\u201d is by far Black Sabbath\u2019s signature defining effort, and for that reason it is worthy of your time and a spot on your collections shelf.\n",
        "\nSabbath, Bloody Sabbath,\" the fifth album from Black Sabbath, is the perfect mix of their metal and melodic sides. The album is almost prog-metal, and even features contributions from Yes keyboardist Rick Wakeman. Much musical growth was evident on this album, yet Sabbath retained their heaviness and their penchant for tales of madness and mysticism. \n\nThe opening title track is a perfect example of where the direction of this album is going to go. Starting off with one of Tony Iommi's classic metal riffs and Ozzy's anguished cries, the song moves between heavy and melodic sections. \"A National Acrobat\" is total doom heaven and one of my personal favorite tracks, and displays excellent leadwork from Iommi. Bassist/ \nlyricist Geezer Butler did a bang-up job of the lyrics to \"Acrobat,\" a tale of death and reincarnation. \"Fluff\" features some beautiful acoustic guitar from Iommi backed by Wakeman's keyboard melodies in an instrumental number very atypical of Sabbath. \"Sabbra Cadabra is a fast-paced love song as only Sabbath can deliver, with more emphasis on rhythm in the second half of the song. \n\nSide two opens with \"Killing Yourself to Live\" a tale of frustration and confusion featuring a strong vocal performance by Ozzy. \"Who are You?\" is probably the most overtly progressive number on the album, with it's emphasis on keyboards (written by Osbourne?!), yet is another very dark number lyrically. \"Looking for Today\" is again on the melodic side, with a flute melody played over the lyrics. The album closes with \"Spiral Architect,\" simply one of Sabbath's greatest and most beautiful songs and a live favorite, clearly demonstrating the musical growth experienced by the band. \n\nThe album cover features some of Sabbath's best artwork, a man caught in the nightmare of a black mass. Musically this was the peak of Sabbath's creativity, but also their unity. \"Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath\" remains one of Sabbath's most influential albums and one of the best of the band's contributions to the metal genre. This stunning release should be experienced by every hard rock/metal fan.\n",
        "\nWith \"Paranoid\", Black Sabbath defined heavy metal as a musical genre. Forget Led Zep, Deep Purple, Hendrix, Blue Cheer, and everybody else. Sabbath took it that one step further with this their second album, pushing the boundaries of heaviness farther than anyone could have imagined. That these songs still stand the test of time almost 40 years later is a testament to the greatness that is Black Sabbath. The only reason I rate it 100 is because I can't rate it 200!\n\nWho doesn't know these songs? The fact is that Iommi is the ultimate metal guitarist: kids still cut their teeth learnihg to play the guitar riffs to these songs. The album is nothing but classic tracks: War Pigs/Luke's Wall, Paranoid, Planet Caravan, Iron Man, Electric Funeral, Hand of Doom, Rat Salad/Jack the Stripper, and Fairies Wear Boots. This album is heavier than the debut, stepping away from the blues jams that had defined the band's style as Earth (an earlier name of the band) and focusing on tighter song arrangements. Lyrically, these songs take the listener into a nightmarish world of nuclear war, mental illness and drug addiction. These themes would become commonplace in metal music, thanks to Sabbath's influence.\n\nThe band's musical ability grew somewhat from the first album. Tony Iommi further defined his lead playing style, recording some classic guitar solos in \"War Pigs\" and \"Iron Man.\" And Iommi's riffs simply can not be beat, they are the heaviest, most doomladen riffs ever recorded. Everything else is simply imitation. \"Iron Man\" is the ultimate metal song, hands down. And title track \"Paranoid,\" which the band thought to be a throwaway number, became the band's biggest (and only) hit. Geezer Butler and Bill Ward proved themselves to be the best rhythm section in heavy music: listen to Ward's inimitable beats on \"Hand of Doom.\" And Ozzy defined his legendary status as metal's best-loved vocalist with this album. Always a bit manaical in his personal life, Ozzy was the perfect voice for Sabbath's tales of madness and despair. \n\nWhat else can be said? This is the album that defines heavy metal. This is the album that broke Sabbath to a worldwide audience. Their career took off from here, and there was much more metal madness to follow.\n",
        "\nBlack Sabbath's 1983 album \"Born Again\" is possibly the most controversial album of the band's lengthly career. After Ronnie James Dio's departure the band enlisted former Deep Purple singer Ian Gillan. Personality-wise Mr. \"Jesus Christ Superstar\" was an inappropriate choice but vocally Gillan is known as one of the best vocalists in hard rock and his powerful voice was certainly befitting Sabbath's legendary status. \n\nThe sole studio output from \"Deep Sabbath,\" as their detractors have called them, begins with \"Trashed,\" a high-speed cautionary tale against the evils of drunk driving. Gillan's powerful high-pitched screams are introduced quickly, and guitarist Tony Iommi lays down some heavy riffing on this one and finishes off with a smouldering guitar solo. \"Instrumental track \"Stonehenge\" is one of underrated keyboardist Geoff Nicholls' best contributions, and segues into \"Disturbing the Priest,\" the album's most evil-sounding track. More than twenty years later this one still sends a chill up one's spine. Geezer Butler breaks out the bass effects for \"The Dark,\" leading into the classic track \"Zero The Hero.\" One of Sabbath's most memorable riffs, this one has seemingly been copped by many artists, including Danzig and Gun's And Roses. \n\nSide two (yes, I still have my well-worn cassette copy) begins with \"Digital Bitch,\" featuring more great lead work from Iommi. Title track \"Born Again\" is a beautifully melodic song and one of Gillan's best vocal performances since his early days in Purple, singing spot-on in his upper range. The heaviness kicks back in with \"Hot Line,\" one of the \"sexier\" numbers on the album and finishes with midpaced rocker \"Keep It Warm\" which features Bill Ward's patented \"thumping\" drum style. \n\nCritics have \"trashed\" this album for it's lack of production value. I beg to differ and in my opinion this is the best production sound of any album ever recorded! Supposedly recorded in a haunted castle, the album's sound perfectly captures the doomy and mysterious mood of the music. Also reviled (even by some band members) is the album cover artwork. I love that little devil and think the artwork was perfectly suited to Sabbath's often controversial music. \n\nSabbath \"purists\" may hate this, but this \"forgotten\" album has some great tunes that should not be overlooked by any Sabbath fan. It is sad that these songs are no longer played in the live setting, but the music of this short-lived lineup is some of the best and heaviest in Sabbth's history.\n",
        "\nI have to concur with most that this is an underrated album, even by those who are steady fans of the earlier Tony Martin albums. This was mostly due to it following \u201cDehumanizer\u201d, which was one of the 6 greatest albums ever put out by Sabbath, resulting in the fate of many good albums of being overlooked as an afterthought from a past era. \u201cCross Purposes\u201d is cut from the earlier Tony Martin years, it doesn\u2019t possess the flaws (though not as severe as some suggest) in production and songwriting that \u201cForbidden\u201d suffered from, and stylistically is very close to the sound heard on \u201cThe Headless Cross\u201d.\n\nOriginal bassist and songwriter Geezer Butler decided not to leave the fold when Dio and Appice did, and consequently his lyrical and musical influence has given a somewhat unique flavor to this album as opposed to previous Martin era albums. This is mostly observed in the lyrical delivery, touching upon some similar subject matter as what was covered on \u201cDehumanizer\u201d. The gloom and doom bass intro to \u201cVirtual Death\u201d, as well as the evil plodding riffs that follow are staples of the Ozzy era, although Tony Martin\u2019s vocal harmonies during the verses almost sound akin to Alice in Chains. The other slow track \u201cEvil Eye\u201d also draws upon these doom influences, but the riffs and vocal delivery are a bit lighter and more rock inspired.\n\nThe ballads on here are where the similarities with the older Tony Martin era comparisons are at their strongest. \u201cDying for Love\u201d is a darker version of \u201cFeels Good to me\u201d with a dreary atmosphere, some solid blues lead playing and a melancholy vocal delivery. \u201cCross of Thorns\u201d also shares the same dark atmosphere, but puts the emphasis on hooks and lyrical content. \u201cThe Hand that Rocks the Cradle\u201d is the most similar to the atmospheric splendor of the ballads found on \u201cThe Headless Cross\u201d, combining a light clean guitar sound and some electric keyboard work before kicking into the louder rocking sections. There\u2019s a little bit of \u201cWhen Death Calls\u201d and \u201cA Kill in the Spirit World\u201d on this one.\n\nThe remaining songs on here are extremely varied, all of them fast, but each deserving special note as they highlight the many opposing influences at work. \u201cCardinal Sin\u201d sounds a lot like a Zepplin song (Kashmir mostly), but with a heavier guitar attack and a brilliant mix of harmonized vocals. \u201cPsychophobia\u201d sounds a little bit similar to the \u201cBorn Again\u201d era material, highlighting a rapid moving chromatic riff contrasted by a subdued break section. \u201cI Witness\u201d is heavily similar to the faster songs on \u201cDehumanizer\u201d, most notably \u201cTV Crimes\u201d. \u201cImmaculate Deception\u201d, which is my favorite song on this album, is a nice mix of hard edged riffing and speed drumming similar to the material on \u201cTyr\u201d, picture a perfect blend of the heavy riffing found on \u201cAnno Mundi\u201d and the hook driven speed of \u201cThe Law Maker\u201d.\n\nThe most astounding feature of this album is the year it was released in, as this approach to metal had fallen out of favor and Grunge was at the forefront of prominent alternative scenes. It is ironic that although most of the Grunge acts claimed to be influenced by Sabbath that Tony Iommi was all but completely oblivious to it by virtue of his songwriting. Although this would mostly be welcomed by fans of the Tony Martin era, I recommend it to any Sabbath fan, because it needs an audience more than any other album put out by the band. It is not quite as consistent as \u201cThe Headless Cross\u201d or \u201cThe Eternal Idol\u201d, but it is definitely worthy of your attention.\n",
        "\nI view this album as sort of an expanded edition of 'We Sold Our Soul for Rock and Roll'. It includes all the material on WSOSfR&R, plus about an albums worth of Black Sabbath's lesser known material. \n\nOne thing that i was dissapointed in, however, was that the bass solo \"Bassicaly\" used as an intro to NIB (which apeared on the WSOSfR&R album) did not appear on this compilation. \n\nThe first disk was awsome featuring most of the classics which i shouldn't have to mention to any one familiar with Sabbath. \n\nThe second disk contains a few fairly well known songs, such as 'Sabbath Bloody Sabbath' and 'Snowblind'. It also contains a few lesser know greats like 'Sabbra Cadabra', 'Symptom of the Universe', 'After Forever', and 'Hole In the Sky'. \n\nThe booklet was much better than I expected, it was really informative, full of interesting facts (including some somewhat humorus trivia) about the band, and all of it extremly well written. \n\nFor any long time Sabbath fans I wouldn't recommend buying this because you've probably heard it all before. However I would strongly recomend this album for anyone who is interested in getting into Black Sabbath, it contains most of the must have Sabbath material, and enough of the lesser known greats to make you feel a bit superior to the people who only know of the songs that they play on the radio. Just don't go around pretending that you know everything about Sabbath just because you've read the booklet. Some long time fans might find that irritating.\n",
        "\nForbidden, Black Sabbath's last studio release (as of this writing), falls far short of the greatness of band's best work. Recorded in only ten days, the album seems rushed, unfocused and generally uninspired. The \"TYR\" lineup of Iommi/Martin/Powell/Murray/Nicholls was capable of better music than this, and I guess I was hoping for \"TYR II.\" That's definitely not what we have here, and this album will go down as one of Sabbath's worst.\n\n\nThere are several problems apparent within this album. Every song might be considered a good song, but where are the GREAT songs? There are too many influences from outside of the classic Sabbath sound. Perhaps Iommi gave up too much creative control to the other band members, this situation not helped by the fact that both Powell (rip) and Murray are former members of Whitesnake. Vocalist Tony Martin borrows a lot from Whitesnake vocalist David Coverdale's style, this being most apparent on the title track. \"Kiss of Death,\" the only song that comes close to being a great song, is ruined near the end by some generic Led-Zep riffing. Iommi is the greatest metal guitarist ever, and has no need to copy Jimmy Page riffs. \n\n\nAnother problem is the lifeless production, courtesy of Body Count's Ernie C. The album sounds thin and weak, and during the lackluster \"Rusty Angels\" one can hear the guitar volume level being pushed up midsong during the clean guitar break. Listen for it, you'll hear. Actually, this song is the closest Sabbath ever came to sounding like Poison! Album opener, \"The Illusion of Power\" has a doomy riff that is rendered ineffective by the thin production. And Ice T's rapping is unwelcome, cliched rap-metal long after the fad had passed. I can imagine that a screaming guitar solo would've been more appropriate. Obviously not much thought was given to production or song arrangement. \n\n\nA lack of songwriting quality plagues the entire album. \"Shaking Off the Chains\" begins with a couple of lame riffs before breaking into a fast bit perhaps reminiscent of Iommi's playing on \"Symptom of the Universe.\" There's a drum intro that sounds like a ripoff of Ozzy's \"Over the Mountain.\" Cheeser \"Get a Grip\" seems aimed at MTV, and I seem to remember Aerosmith having an album of the same title around the time. \"I Won't Cry For You\" is a nice power ballad, but far from heavy. And the album cover is nothing spectacular, a Grim Reaper sitting beside a grave, waiting in boredom as Sabbath is reborn yet again. By listening to this album, one would say the Reaper didn't have much longer to wait!\n\n\nIf tihs is to be the last studio album from Sabbath, then it is certainly a disappointment. Tony Martin has called the album \"total crap,\" and Geoff Nichols has said that \"the album was recorded in ten days and it shows.\" So even the band members aren't behind this release, and it seems the album was recorded just to fulfill contractual obligations to IRS records. On \"Forbidden\" the great monolithic doom metal of Sabbath's past has been traded in for AOR sappiness, and that is what is truly forbidden!\n",
        "\nEvery once in a while a greatest hits collection comes around that will be an absolute must have for any fan of a band, one that contains all the right amount of perks and rarities to entice the most hardcore fan, yet still contain all the necessary hits to rope in the casual listener. \u201cStand Up and Shout\u201d lives up to its name by shouting one thing to the potential buyer, \u201cIf you buy me you will get it all!!\u201d You get every era spanning Dio\u2019s career since the early 70s with Elf up until his last great effort in the 1990s Strange Highways.\n\nAs someone who was an already established enthusiast for Dio\u2019s Sabbath and solo work at the time, my main reason for getting this release was the Elf and Rainbow material, the former of which I was 100% unexposed to while the latter had only been touched upon due to live performances and one greatest hits compilation. \n\nThe Elf material, for its time, is quite an innovative fusion of blues and rock that requires a bit of historical perspective in order to grasp. When you consider that the heaviest thing going on at the time was Black Sabbath and that they were considered an aberration, this is quite hard edged stuff and a path can been seen to where Dio would grow into what he is now.\n\nThe Rainbow stuff includes the obvious tour favorites \u201cLong Live Rock and Roll\u201d and \u201cMan on the Silver Mountain\u201d, as well as the only slightly less well known \u201cStarstruck\u201d. Although these songs are all a great listen and rock hard, I had hoped that more epic tracks such as Gates of Babylon would have made it onto here, but of course those tracks are to be found on Rainbow compilations.\n\nThe Black Sabbath stuff is presented chronologically, which is a breath of fresh air as most Sabbath compilations are dreadfully unorganized. You have all the essentials from both the early 80s era as well as the strongest song from the 1992 reunion in \u201cComputer God\u201d. We also get a great live version of \u201cVoodoo\u201d from the Mob Rules tour back in 1982 that qualifies as a genuine rarity.\n\nDio\u2019s solo material has also been well organized and includes pretty much all the no-brainer tracks from the first two albums. We get a live version of \u201cSacred Heart\u201d from the famous tour that spawned the Video concert carrying the same name, definitely a great perk for the Dio fan that already has most of the discography. To my relief, the Dream Evil material was not given the shaft and the two best songs from it are found on here. Likewise, both Lock up the Wolves and Strange Highways managed to get their title tracks onto this compilation, rounding out the tail end of a career that spanned more than 20 years at that point.\n\nTo the prospective buyer who is looking for some stuff with Ronnie Dio attached to it that is not found on the LPs, as well as the fan of metal who wishes an introduction to the artist, this is the album to go for. It listens extremely well owing to it being well organized and all of the songs being digitally remastered, which is more than what I can say for the majority of the large amount of Dio greatest hits CDs out there. Get yourself a copy today and be prepared to Stand up and Shout.\n",
        "\nI sympathize with the few though determined flock of Sabbath completists out there, with all the damned Sabbath compilations out there it\u2019s really expensive to be a core fan, particularly when everything they offer is already on their studio releases. I would normally be one to shower the industry with praise for finally recognizing that the Tony Martin era of Sabbath was as worthy of a greatest hits compilation as all the others, but I can\u2019t really condone what they\u2019ve done here.\n\nI bought this compilation before owning the \u201cCross Purposes\u201d and \u201cForbidden\u201d releases as a research tool, if the differences that people said these two albums had from the other 3 Tony Martin ones were not to my liking, my loss of money would have been minimized and I would still have a spare copy of some older classics to take with me on road trips. However, upon liking the songs on here from the two latter releases and buying them this CD serves absolutely no purpose at all, because there is no bonus material or rarities included, not to mention that they gave the Eternal Idol the shaft on here.\n\nThe track order of this makes for a poorly paced listen, splitting up all the various material from the 4 albums and reshuffling them in a purely random manner. \u201cThe Battle of Tyr\u201d does not work as an instrumental lead in to \u201cSabbath Stones\u201d, there is a reason why the former appeared after the latter on the studio album it was lifted from. The intro to \u201cValhalla\u201d is completely butchered as the result of being torn from its two fellow movements and sounds so abrupt that the listener might think that the entire Tyr release was poorly conceived. \n\nIf I had been in charge of compiling this, I would have included \u201cCloak and Dagger\u201d as a bonus track, as well as lifted a few tracks off the Eternal Idol album and perhaps even released it as a double CD and combined it with a first even mass recording industry release of the Eternal Idol demo featuring now deceased singer Ray Gillen on vocals. That would not only be worth the money, but would be a better compilation than We Sold Our Souls for Rock and Roll.\n\nTo all prospective buyers, unless you have a quirky obsession driving you to own absolutely everything with Sabbath\u2019s name on it, steer clear of this release. I\u2019m quite possibly the only person on this site that has a copy of this and I have little use for it other than it taking up space on my CD rack. Just take it from me, all the stuff released with Tony Martin singing is top quality and should be owned in their entirety.\n",
        "\nI am generally not a big fan of compilations because they are geared towards something which I am not, a pedestrian metal fan, ergo someone who likes the radio friendly versions of the heavy metal genre. The only exceptions I make are when the artists are directly involved in the process and when there are plenty of rarities included as I tend to already own all of the albums in a particular band\u2019s catalog or plan to if they are worthy of my listening time. This compilation is among those that I am not particularly fond of, but it also suffers due to some other motives that I fear caused the release of the rarities that are present on here.\n\nThe Black Sabbath demos on here are elucidating as to the nature of the early work that Sabbath put together before the final 1st and 2nd albums were produced, but the fact that they are included in this compilation at this time brings about some questions. The famed Black Sabbath reunion of all the original members of the band coincided with this compilations release, suggesting that Ozzy was reaching into the Sabbath well once again in order to establish credibility with older fans, as well as to promote what I personally thought was an overblown reunion, resulting in a handful of tour appearances and 2 rather poorly written new songs.\n\nThe demo songs themselves are obviously of poor sound quality due to obsolete recording equipment being in use at the time, the drums sounding too think and the bass being way too loud. Ozzy\u2019s singing is absolutely abysmal, especially during the verses of \u201cBlack Sabbath\u201d, and sometimes I have a hard time understanding the words due to poor pronunciation. The extra verse present on this song is clearly not necessary both lyrically and musically and makes the song drag on way too long, which was probably due to the influence of overlong hippie rock songs at the time. \u201cWar Pigs\u201d has completely different words, and though at the time I\u2019m sure the things said on here were quite provocative, today it\u2019s quite tame compared to what is often put in songs. \n\nThe Randy Rhodes material on here is obviously quality stuff if you take Ozzy\u2019s inability to sing out of the picture, as well as the fact that these songs are by far the most overplayed of the bunch (not only on radio, but also in Guitar Shops such as the one I work in). The Jake E. Lee material has obviously been given the shaft and only occupies 2 song slots on here (1 if you get the 2002 reissue); the latter song \u201cShot in the Dark\u201d contains Ozzy\u2019s best vocal performance, primarily because he doesn\u2019t go into his high range. \n\nThe Zakk Wylde stuff is a bit of a mixed bag, the earlier stuff being mostly good while the later stuff flirting with pure mediocrity. \u201cCrazy Babies\u201d is a fun and totally 80s cock rock inspired song, while \u201cNo More Tears\u201d (the only good song on that album) is musically interesting despite Ozzy\u2019s singing. \u201cMama I\u2019m coming home\u201d is a boring, redundant, pointless ballad that induces sleep between the lackluster guitar solo and the hypnotically repetitive acoustic theme. \u201cI just want you\u201d is atmospherically interesting, but lyrically it\u2019s so nonsensical that it ruins it. Ozzy says there is no this, he says there is no that, while I\u2019m just thinking there is no point at all. \u201cBack on Earth\u201d is essentially a better version of the last song mentioned with better vocals and a shorter guitar solo, probably the only good rarity to come out of this release.\n\nTo those contemplating buying this album, don\u2019t waste your money unless you want a watered down version of both Randy Rhoades\u2019 and Jake E. Lee\u2019s contributions to Ozzy\u2019s survival as a musician. Zakk Wylde had his moments, but I don\u2019t think it warrants having an equal footing with Rhoades and completely dwarfing Jake E. Lee on a greatest hits release. The Ozzman may have Cometh, but only in the sense of an impotent old man trying to plant his seed in a younger generation of mindless pseudo-metal heads.\n",
        "\nThe turn of the decade saw the continued glory of metal in various forms. Bands such as Judas Priest and Riot were ushering a different speed metal answer to the established thrash genre that had dominated the mid 80s, while other artists such as Dio and Yngwie Malmsteen completely revamped their bands in order to continue the evolution of their sound. In the middle of it all is this forgotten classic, the album which truly captures the spirit of true Viking metal, despite the fact that it was penned by musicians on an island a bit west of where the Norsemen originated.\n\nIt can be plainly stated that Sabbath\u2019s influential status in the 70s and early 80s was obvious, but what is not as well known are the precedents set by this band in the later 80s and the early 90s. Although song by song \u201cThe Headless Cross\u201d has a slight edge, the progressive themes and the ambitious approach to songwriting on here takes this album up to near equal standing with its predecessor. Geoff Nicholls\u2019 keyboard textures, Tony Martin\u2019s voice, Neil Murray\u2019s active bass lines, Cozy Powell\u2019s beats, and maestro Iommi\u2019s riffs all line up perfectly, each linking together to create a grand dragon boat of sound.\n\nThis album begins amazingly with the highly progressive and mystical sounding \u201cAnno Mundi\u201d. The opening riff is slightly reminiscent of \u201cChildren of the Sea\u201d, but is accompanied by a choral chant that sounds like it could only have been accomplished by Freddie Mercury. What follows is a set of hard edged riffs that flirts with sounding like both \u201cZero the Hero\u201d and \u201cThe Eternal Idol\u201d. Although we don\u2019t have a guitar solo to speak of on this track, as was the case with the title track of the first album with Tony Martin, the amount of different themes and ideas going on here completely make up for it,\n\n\u201cLaw Maker\u201d and \u201cJerusalem\u201d follow, the former being a solid speed metal song that cooks equally as fast as \u201cTurn to Stone\u201d on the Seventh Star release, the latter being a solid mid tempo track with a killer signature riff and plenty of amazing vocal moments. \u201cThe Sabbath Stones\u201d is a song that reminds more of classic Sabbath during the Ozzy years, going through a barrage of contrasting sections. You get a quiet acoustic guitar section with keyboard fills that sounds a bit similar to the quiet part of \u201cSabbath Bloody Sabbath\u201d, while the slow verse riffs remind of \u201cThe Wizard. Everything kicks it up a notch towards the end with a drastic tempo change which has that rhythmic triplet feel of the closing to \u201cBlack Sabbath\u201d, but with a sense of triumph that also reminds of the closing section of \u201cHeaven and Hell\u201d.\n\n\u201cFeels Good to Me\u201d is the album\u2019s single and has the most obvious hooks to it. The lyrics are about a troubled relationship, the guitars are mostly quiet during the verses, following with a powerful yet simple chorus riff. Unfortunately if you happen to run into a copy of the single for this song, you will discover that the highlight to the song, the guitar solo at the beginning has been cut. \u201cHeaven in Black\u201d closes off the album on an up tempo note with plenty of wah pedal dominated guitar soloing. It mostly sounds like a less blues driven version of \u201cBlack Moon\u201d, although the vocal lines remind a bit of \u201cDevil and Daughter\u201d.\n\nThe highlight of this album is obvious as it contains the concept of the album. \u201cThe Battle of Tyr/Odin\u2019s Court/Valhalla\u201d is a glowing example of Sabbath\u2019s progressive roots, going through some rather intricate musical changes and ideas. The first track is an instrumental keyboard prelude that could easily be included in a 80s Sci-Fi/Fantasy film score. The middle track is an acoustic and atmospheric ballad with a very exposed yet perfect vocal performance, sounding essentially as any Viking Folk Metal outfit should sound. The 3rd and final track of the opus is where all the best aspects of this album culminate. You have an unforgettable main riff, a riveting guitar solo, and probably the most triumphant chorus ever composed by Black Sabbath. No matter how much praise you steep this song in, it will remain underrated, and it is in a class completely by itself.\n\nIn conclusion, this is Black Sabbath\u2019s musically progressive and melodic answer to the changing world of metal. Although it will probably never get the credit it deserves, this album represented an alternative to the road that metal was going down, one that has still yet to be fully explored. It comes recommended to any fan of Power Metal, Progressive Metal, Traditional Heavy Metal, or any other genre that deals in the concept of Norse myths and legends. I still listen to it once every few weeks, and it stays fresh, forward looking, and a cut above the rest.\n",
        "\nAfter managing to pull off a masterpiece album in the midst of some rather sizable line-up changes, Tony Iommi, his newly recruited front man Tony Martin and keyboardist Geoff Nicholls set out to reclaim the credibility that the Sabbath name still had back in the early 80s. They found it and his name was Cozy Powell, the masterfully insane kit master that brought us the lion\u2019s share of the best music from Rainbow. With his added musical input, Sabbath ceased to be a mere Tony Iommi side project and became a more cohesive metal pounding machine.\n\nThis album is probably among the least evil sounding releases carrying the Sabbath name, despite the dark imagery depicted in the lyrics. Although we have some evil sounding riffs on \u201cNightwing\u201d and \u201cKill in the Spirit World\u201d, this album harkens back to the more epic sound established on \u201cHeaven and Hell\u201d. The title track has a very similar bass line and overall atmosphere to the 1980 classic Sabbath song, and rivals the musical homage paid to it by Dio\u2019s band \u201cHoly Diver\u201d. The segue between it and the opening keyboard and ambience driven instrumental \u201cThe Gates of Hell\u201d is masterfully done, swelling up with an ominous sense of crescendo before Cozy Powell bangs out a classic rock beat.\n\n\u201cBlack Moon\u201d and \u201cDevil and Daughter\u201d are both heavily atmospheric numbers, the former being highly blues driven though with a dark sounding church organ, while the latter is a more speed oriented track with a classic power chord riff reminiscent of the better parts of the Ronnie Dio era. \u201cKill in the Spirit World\u201d and \u201cCall of the Wild\u201d are both cut from the heavily epic vain of the Dio era, complete with memorable verses and choruses and a few dissonant sections. \n\nAlthough everything on here rocks out and reeks of early epic power metal, the two highlights are so exceptional that they demand several listens by themselves. \u201cWhen Death Calls\u201d is probably the closest thing to a scary sounding song on here, with a gloomy keyboard driven verse and a heavy riff driven chorus. The middle section is fast, and contains the best solo on this album courtesy Queen axe man Brian May, a man whose guitar work has had probably the most impact on every lead guitarist in the Power Metal genre who isn\u2019t a Malmsteen worshipper. \u201cNightwing\u201d has all the right elements to make it an obligatory listen for any fan of the Power Metal genre. Iommi has 3 amazing guitar solos, one of them a classical guitar solo, which has rarely been encountered since the Mob Rules release. But this song\u2019s real appeal is the lyrics, describing the vampire the way I\u2019ve always picture him, a powerful yet regal creature of the night, rather than the horrid caricature that is the modern vampire depicted in Blade.\n\nIn conclusion, if you like Power Metal, if you liked the Dio and Gillian eras, this album is a must have. It stands tall as the greatest achievement every realized by Tony Martin in his long career as a vocalist, and it challenges the perfection established on \u201cSabotage\u201d, \u201cSabbath Bloody Sabbath\u201d, \u201cHeaven and Hell\u201d, and \u201cMob Rules\u201d. I listen to it often and I can assure you this, it never gets old, it never waivers, it is a definitive masterwork for the consumption of melodic metal fans.\n",
        "\nThis album has been on the receiving end of some rather harsh criticism in metal circles, mostly due to its extremely rough production and complete departure from the more melodic sound present on the previous Tony Martin era releases. I myself was not a huge fan of Body Count, not due to any lyrical issues that could be compared to Dan Quayle\u2019s ridiculous censorship crusade, but because the sound quality on their work is just plain bad. However, even though Ernie C still has no clue how to make drums sound as they should in a traditional metal mix, this album has some solid work on it that is sadly passed up as being attached to a mediocre release.\n\nStylistically this album is a combination of the Deep Purple inspired attentiveness to melodic and catchy hooks that has been present throughout the Tony Martin era, and some of the creepy sounding elements that can be found \u201cBorn Again\u201d and some of the earlier Ozzy Osboure era material. \u201cIllusion of Power\u201d is probably the spookiest sounding of the lot, containing a dissonant main riff that is comparable to \u201cDisturbing the Priest\u201d as well as the title track to the Eternal Idol release. Ice-T\u2019s spoken narration is actually quite fitting and complements the song well. \u201cRusty Angels\u201d is much lighter sounding up-tempo song; the main riff sounds like it could have been used on the \u201cSeventh Star\u201d release. \n\nThings really pick up a notch with \u201cGet a Grip\u201d, which has a main riff that is heavily reminiscent of \u201cZero the Hero\u201d, not to mention some exceptional lead breaks that take me back to the glory days of the Ronnie Dio era. This one also has a great speed section for the closing with Cozy Powell going steady on the double bass drum. \u201cShaking off the Chains\u201d is our token groove song for this release, having a repetitive yet fun very set of verses and refrains. Groove can be quite fun when it\u2019s kept in moderation, and thankfully Black Sabbath understood this better than the pioneers of the 90s groove style that would write entire albums of the stuff.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t cry for you\u201d is my pick for the best song on here as it sounds the most like the material on the Headless Cross album. It\u2019s not quite as riveting as \u201cWhen Death Calls\u201d, but it qualifies as a new classic for the Tony Martin years. \u201cKiss of Death\u201d is the token epic and has a soft guitar intro reminiscent of \u201cNightwing\u201d, although Tony Iommi doesn\u2019t go nuts and let it all loose the way he did on that masterpiece. \u201cGuilty as Hell\u201d and the title track are both mid-tempo songs with sections similar to such memorable riff monsters as \u201cJerusalem\u201d, \u201cKill in the Spirit World\u201d and \u201cCall of the Wild\u201d. \u201cSick and Tired\u201d is more of a blues driven number and has a good amount in common with Headless Cross b-side \u201cCloak and Dagger\u201d.\n\nAlthough the production is nothing to write home about, there is much here for the post-Ozzy, post-Dio fan of Sabbath to enjoy. Tony Iommi is still cranking out some solid riffs and solos, Cozy is still destroying his kit and rebuilding it again for the next number, and Tony Martin is still lighting up every song with his exceptional voice. Although I would categorize this as the weakest release of the Tony Martin era, when we consider the 4 amazing albums that they put out before this one, the notion that this album is shelf-worthy is hardly justified. 1995 was a tough year for heavy metal, and this album was able to come out and still sound like something worthy of the genre.\n",
        "\nBy 1990, Black Sabbath had already went through some of the most legendary heavy metal singers of all time and a load of other musicians. Regardless of who came in and out of the band, Sabbath was still able to be a powerhouse in the metal scene. Tony Iommi's recruitment of an unfamiliar singer by the name of Tony Martin on \"Eternal Idol\" caused the vocalist to go from an unknown musician to one of metal's most captivating elites. Tony Martin's era in Sabbath continued through the 1980's with the masterful \"Headless Cross,\" which quickly became a cult classic within the band's fan base, but their impressive run didn't end there. The band's fifteenth album,\"Tyr,\" is the valorous continuation of Sabbath's legacy in the form of other Tony Martin albums with epic music, soaring vocals and spell binding lyrics.\n\nThe semi-power metal approach Sabbath began using when Tony Martin entered the band remains intact here along with a few touches of doom metal and atmosphere. \"Anno Mundi\" and \"The Sabbath Stones\" are the most atmospheric songs on \"Tyr\" because they have slow, yet heavy riffs with agile keyboard overtones and slothful drum patterns. Some of the album's faster tracks, like \"The Lawmaker\" and \"Heaven In Black,\" utilize quicker riffs and drum patterns than most of the other songs.\n\nRegardless of what style is being played, Iommi is able to play splendid riffs and otherworldly solos. The majority of the riffs he plays are rather fast, yet some are slow and forceful. The doom influence on \"Anno Mundi\" drives the song with epic and powerful riffs that are just as catchy as they are brilliant. Iommi's solo performance is on par with his fantastic riffs as he rapidly nails several notes in just a couple of seconds to make some wonderful leads. Iommi's guitar show on \"Tyr\" is incredibly good and is one of his best Sabbath performances to date.\n\nBy the time \"Tyr\" was recorded, Tony Martin had found his niche in Black Sabbath and was hailed as one of the band's most exciting members. Martin's ability to match Sabbath's metal attack on \"Tyr\" shows a great display of talent and greatness in his voice. The high notes Martin is able to hit on \"Anno Mundi\" and \"Valhalla\" makes the music seem epic and powerful. His note holding skill also makes some of the song's choruses seem brighter and more energetic. \"The Lawmaker\" applies to this the most when Martin is singing the chorus and he holds the final line with a powerful vocal tone.\n\nCozy Powell's drum performance on \"Tyr\" is substantially more technical and skillful than the percussion on his Black Sabbath debut, \"Headless Cross.\" Unlike his prior album, Powell is occupied with great drum fills and solid patterns. \"The Lawmaker\" and \"Heaven In Black\" each begin with complex drum fills that are stylish and talented. During the solo on \"The Lawmaker,\" Cozy accommodates his double bass pedals with Iommi's solo to make the song seem faster and beautifully animated. \"Tyr\" is definitely Cozy Powell's stand out performance during his short stay in Black Sabbath.\n\n\"Tyr\" is one of the most unique albums in the Black Sabbath catalog due to the fact its the band's sole concept album. The main center point of the lyrics here is the concept and story of Norse mythology. Such songs like \"Odin's Court\" and \"Valhalla\" give strong reference to mythological gods like Odin and Thor while maintaining a stable story line about Norse beliefs.\n\n\"Tyr\" is without a doubt one of the best Black Sabbath records ever made. If you have the slightest interest in Black Sabbath's phase with Tony Martin, you need to get this album. If you aren't familiar with Tony Martin or his time in Sabbath, this is a great place to start.\n\nThis review was written for: http://www.Thrashpit.com\n",
        "\nInitially I viewed Tyr as the weakest of the original Tony Martin-era Black Sabbath trilogy, but these days I\u2019ve been inclined to believe it might be the strongest (it is, at the very least, better than Headless Cross). This is because Tyr is the sound of this Black Sabbath lineup at their most comfortable. Here there is no need to live up to any of the expectations based on the band\u2019s rich lineage, they need only live up to those based off of The Eternal Idol and Headless Cross. The resulting freedom is responsible for one of the most developed Sabbath albums ever made, a record that is both musically enjoyable and artistically satisfying.\n\nAs with the other albums that Tony Martin sings on, it is necessary to mentally detach these works from the Ozzy-era albums to fully appreciate them. The sound is more of a traditional/power metal sound than anything remotely doomish and there is an essential keyboard element (once again provided by Geoff Nicholls) accompanying the band\u2019s sound. This is for atmospheric purposes, obviously, but the results haven\u2019t been this magical since Heaven and Hell (when the 80\u2019s style synths really started making a full-time appearance). Where Headless Cross relied on synth backing to the point of dependence, Tyr blends them flawlessly into the instrumentation, which is also quite strong. Tony Iommi brings the riffage by the barrel; Tyr is one of the heaviest Black Sabbath albums since the Ozzy years. Iommi is the key here, but it is also due in no small part to the incredibly proficient Neil Murray on bass guitar and drummer Cozy Powell, who delivers one of the best performances in his extensive discography. Everything is just incredibly well done, whether the band is performing quick power metal (\u201cThe Lawmaker\u201d), straightforward, catchy traditional metal (\u201cJerusalem,\u201d \u201cHeaven in Black\u201d) or doom-laden epics like \u201cThe Sabbath Stones\u201d or \u201cAnno Mundi.\u201d The latter numbers are where this lineup really excels, and nowhere are they more ambitious than on the \u201cTyr\u201d trilogy. Featuring a keyboard introduction (\u201cThe Battle of Tyr\u201d), a stirring acoustic movement (\u201cOdin\u2019s Court\u201d), and a powerful concluding anthem (\u201cValhalla\u201d), it is one of the highlights of later-period Sabbath. Only \u201cFeels Good to Me,\u201d (the ballad of sorts) feels a bit weaker than the rest: the album just plain rules that much.\n\nOf course, one must mention singer Tony Martin. His performance on the album is not merely one of comfort, but of absolute confidence. Completely shedding the Dio mannerisms that he displayed on The Eternal Idol, Martin gives a powerful, emotional performance from beginning to end. He experiments with layering on \u201cAnno Mundi\u201d and \u201cJerusalem\u201d to good effect and he\u2019s matured as a lyricist: every tale told on this album was penned by him. \n\nUnderrated like all of the Martin-era albums, Tyr is an excellent album nonetheless. Recommended for fans of epic heavy metal bands like Manilla Road, Manowar, etc. minus their speedier stuff\n",
        "\nTony Martin era Sabbath is a thing of beauty. Just when you thought heavy metal's most respected force was about to evolve into some trendy vessel of mainstream 80's garbage, they hire a completely unknown but brilliant vocalist and release a powerful string of albums that are worthy successors not only to the Dio years, but to the classic Ozzy years as well. This is the second in that string, taking the new power metal sound showcased on the masterful Eternal Idol album, making it doomier and gloomier, and adding just a tinge of 80's mainstream rock to produce an album that doesn't quite surpass it's precursor, but at least manages to live up to it. \n\nHeadless Cross is most notable for its killer atmosphere. From the first seconds of the intro track \"The Gates of Hell,\" a solemn, evil mood is set, one that maintains itself throughout the album. The songwriting is varied, but generally sticks to a down tempo version of 80's power metal. The keyboards tend to give this impression the most, making songs like \"Devil & Daughter\" sound like a lot like early Yngwie Malmsteen songs, if you replace the neoclassical aspects with doom metal riffs. The riffs provide a lot of variation as well. A lot of the riffs comply with the 80's power metal sound, with a few that are catchy enough to draw parallels with 80's pop metal, namely the verse riff of \"Kill in the Spirit World.\" But no matter how much the band evolves with the times, there's always a shitload of riffs that could not have logically been written by anyone else than Tony Iommi without constituting thievery, namely the chorus riff of \"Kill in the Spirit World,\" which more than makes up for the catchy verse riff. Iommi's solos are top notch here as well, nothing short of what one would expect. The other instrumental parts are performed competently, but the only other member of the band that stands out here is the mighty Tony Martin. His voice hasn't suffered one bit in between albums. He still gives off the occasional Dio vibe, but his range and tone are still very much his own, perfectly suited for metal of this caliber. Very much appreciated. \n\nThe lyrics on this album are darker than they've been in a while, touching on topics Satanic in origin with a sinister tone throughout. These are perfectly sung by Martin and fit the mood the music sets just as perfectly. Every song on here is pretty sweet, with the only mediocre one being \"Call of the Wild\" (not sure why I don't like it, I just don't). The version I have comes with a bonus track, \"Cloak and Dagger,\" from the \"Headless Cross\" single. It's presence doesn't really affect the album's score, but it's another good example of the songwriting power this Sabbath era had. Highlights include \"Headless Cross,\" \"Devil & Daughter,\" \"When Death Calls,\" and \"Kill in the Spirit World.\" \n\nIn short, another great album from a great lineup of a great band. You can't really compare it to the band's most classic albums, but it's real fucking far from deserving the recycle bin.\n",
        "\nWith any compilation, fans will rant and rave that their favorite tracks weren't included. So here goes. Where the hell are Spiral Architect and The Writ? With all the sub-par tracks that were included, why aren't these two classics in there? And Megalomania would be nice, too. \n\nMy issue with this comp, though, isn't really that it's not a good one. It does a wonderful job of introducing Sabbath to the average unenlightened moron. Classics that people who have only heard Sabbath's five radio hits (NIB, Sweet Leaf, you guess the other three) have yet to discover are all included here. On a side note, Children of the Grave is the best song ever. \n\nMy issue is with all the crappy songs that somehow, someway, made the cut. Big messy jams like Warning, Fairies Wear Boots and A Hard Road, somewhat boring soft pieces Laguna Sunrise, Changes, and Fluff, and the just plain stupid Am I Going Insane weigh this otherwise stellar collection down.However, if you don't want to buy all of Sabbath's albums but want to hear most of the good stuff, this is an excellent buy.\n",
        "\nWhile \u201cParanoid\u201d is the defining album of Black Sabbath\u2019s career, little attention is paid to its follow-up \u201cMaster of Reality\u201d. \u201cMaster of Reality\u201d was, incredibly, produced by Black Sabbath just a few short months after \u201cParanoid\u201d, this is quite extraordinary seeing as almost no band has made so many albums in such a short time, especially albums of this magnitude. \n\nAgain, Sabbath wallows in the bluesy rock that they had on both their debut and \u201cParanoid\u201d, however this is the most hard-hitting of all of them. Gone are the aimless jams of their debut (unless you want to nitpick about \u201cEmbryo\u201d and \u201cOrchid\u201d, acoustic guitar pieces which together come in at less than two minutes), also while just as riff driven as \u201cParanoid\u201d, \u201cMaster of Reality\u201d focus\u2019s on the rhythm to a much larger extent. \n\nContinuing the trend of \u201cParanoid\u201d each member continues to become more proficient in their individual instruments. Ozzy screams and yells, for maybe the most powerful vocal performance of his career, though hints of his signature mechanical, overdubbed vocals appear on \u201cMaster of Reality\u201d. Tony Iommi again shows off his riffing prowess, and possibly the best performance of his career. Bassist Geezer Butler provides the rhythm backbone of the band, and on \u201cMaster of Reality\u201d where there is much more of a rhythmic focus his contributions can\u2019t be given credit enough. Bill Ward, as usually, provides a solid, but jam band-esque, performance, however, it must be noted, is the very John Bonham style slowly creeping into his style.\n\nAnother key factor of \u201cMaster of Reality\u201d is its lyrical theme and overall mood. Well, as usually for Sabbath, this preaches of struggle, drugs, and sci-fi. Also, while \u201cHand of Doom\u201d may have given the genre of Doom Metal its title, \u201cMaster of Reality\u201d contributes much more to the genres sound. \n\nAnd for material contained within \u201cMaster of Reality\u201d, just more classic Black Sabbath, that\u2019s all. \u201cMaster of Reality\u201d contains so many classics, it\u2019s not even funny. From \u201cSweat Leaf\u201d and \u201cChildren of the Grave\u201d, to \u201cInto the Void\u201d and \u201cAfter Forever\u201d and the absolute gem \u201cLord of This World\u201d, \u201cMaster of Reality\u201d packs quite a punch. \n\nOverall, Black Sabbath\u2019s \u201cMaster of Reality\u201d is their single most consistent, strongest effort of their career. While \u201cParanoid\u201d gets much of the fanfare and glory, \u201cMaster of Reality\u201d out does it, and then some. Should you get this? YES! No matter you\u2019re favorite genre of metal is, this one is for you, particularly anyone who has any interest in doom metal.\n",
        "\nThe day is Friday February 13th 1970, and on this day the first metal album graced us all, and changed the course of musical history. \n\nAt first this album was lambasted by critics, or just plain ignored, quite odd for an album the usually pops up on \u201cgreatest album\u201d type lists. But for some people this was the musical equivalent of a breath of fresh air after a much too long Greatful Dead concert (for some, literally). \n\nOf course this isn\u2019t a leap from The Beatles to say, Death. This album contains pretty much blues derived music, which puts this closer to bands like Cream, or Led Zeppelin than a Judas Priest. Then what separated this from its popular counterparts? Subject matter, while some preached love to achieve peace, Sabbath wrote of the harsh realities of living in a worn torn country. They hinted at being much darker and mysterious than they really were, but in reality the biggest theme is society and life.\n\nBeing the first of its kind it is easy to understand that this is not perfect, but more radical (for its time at least). But being perfect wasn\u2019t the point, this music was meant to bludgeon the listener into an almost hallucinatory state, while reveling in its own dazed, druggy state of consciousness. \n\nAnd who could forget about the cast of characters that made this landmark album? Still amateurish 20 year olds this still has all the trademarks of classic Black Sabbath from Ozzy Osbournes a hellish shrieks, to the morbid riffs conjured up by Tony Iommi, and the thundering bass backbone provided by main lyricist Geezer Butler, with Bill Ward filling out the bad with a loose jam oriented drums. Who knew that these kids would one day become the idols of millions and the godfathers of not only a musical genre, but a culture, and this album started it all.\n\nAs for the material on this album, it\u2019s classic. The songs blur together due to the lengthy jam quality to the music. Each riff pounds at and never lets up, until the next equally powerful riff takes over. And as for highlights, it\u2019s all a highlight! Listen to every moment, take it all in, let in run through your veins. \n\nOverall this is absolutely a classic groundbreaking album, and for that reason alone it should belong in your (and every metal-head\u2019s) collection. And if that wasn\u2019t reason enough, get this because it\u2019s good, there\u2019s substance throughout this album that lives strong today. Absolutely essential.\n",
        "\nHoly shit, this album took me by complete surprise. I used to believe that all Black Sabbath's post-Dio albums were complete failures, but this album has forever altered that viewpoint. Eternal Idol mixes Sabbath's classic doom metal glory with a distinct 80's power metal sound, a combination that clearly is capable of producing the best in Black Sabbath's creative genius since Heaven and Hell.\n\nFirst of all, new vocalist Tony Martin is not just a capable singer and worthy addition to the band's lineup, he fucking rules. His voice is somewhat reminiscent of Dio at times, but with his own distinct tone. His performance on \"Ancient Warrior\" is justification enough to purchase this album. The absolute greatest moments on The Eternal Idol are created in the harmony between Martin's vocal melody and Iommi's signature riffing, which has evolved and perfected further. \"The Shining\" and \"Ancient Warrior\" are prime examples of magnificent rhythm work and every song has a killer solo, as would be expected. Whatever hair metal-like influences managed to corrupt the Seventh Star album are long gone; this album is pure Sabbath bliss from start to finish. Not a single weak song. Even the bonus track has its merits. The synthesizer effects are also notable. All the synth work is very tasteful and adds immensely to the atmospheric quality of the album. The songs very in tempo and mood, so the application is quite different for each. It really adds some much appreciated variety.\n\nI'm not going to wax intellectual on the lyrical awesomeness and the instrumental creativity. Rest assured, this album is quality, top shelf metal, even if it's a little different than what Sabbath usually does. Considering the relative shittiness of the albums immediately before this one, that's a damn good sort of different. Naysayers be silenced: Tony Martin is a great singer and The Eternal Idol is a great album. Highly recommended.\n",
        "\nBlack Sabbath have an unusual career arc compared to other long-lived metal institutions, releasing consistently great albums over their extensive career but almost never consecutively. Every other album tends to be a dip (though relatively in many cases, like Vol. 4) between classics and, if we count each era separately and consider Heaven and Hell\u2019s The Devil You Know as an official release, this holds true for all twenty of their studio albums. My preference tends to lie with the odd numbered releases, so following that logic, the second Dio-fronted Sabbath album is weaker than the first, relying mostly on earlier momentum and adding little but a few more likable metal anthems without achieving the same sublimity.\n\nPeering behind the rather disturbing, occultic imagery splattered across the cover, we find a very worthy companion piece to Sabbath\u2019s earlier achievement Heaven and Hell, with fresh drummer Vinnie Appice filling Bill Ward\u2019s shoes in quite the respectable manner given the less ambitious, relatively straightforward nature of this era\u2019s sonic delights. There are a few analogues to the last album that are pretty transparent; for instance, \u201cTurn up the Night\u201d is the cheerier second coming of \u201cNeon Knights.\u201d But there\u2019s a lot of different takes on the metal formula on display. The title track is a more aggressive galloper and an obvious highlight, while \u201cCountry Girl\u201d has an irresistibly heavy groove and dynamic counterpoint comparable to that of the classic \u201cDie Young.\u201d \u201cSlipping Away\u201d is more rock-oriented, and almost Zeppelin-esque save the unequaled heavy it brings, while \u201cOver and Over\u201d resurrects the forlorn bluesy pace that made \u201cLonely is the Word\u201d such an enjoyable finale. As you can see, it\u2019s far too easy to draw parallels to their previous album, leading Mob Rules to look like a little brother than a standalone effort.\n\nNew elements include increased synthesizer integration, resulting in skippable tomfoolery like \u201cE5150\u201d but also adding gravitas to the album\u2019s grand, atmospheric diversions \u201cThe Sign of the Southern Cross\u201d and the first half of \u201cFalling Off the Edge of the World.\u201d It\u2019s debatable whether or not the former piece outstays its welcome, but I\u2019m hard pressed to find a more emotive vocal performance from RJD than on either of these pieces. As always, despite the obvious quality of their proto speed metal works, Sabbath excels at the slowest tempos. And though Dio\u2019s performance is the highlight of this album, both Iommi and Butler tend to be at their most poignant during the slow ones too.\n\nDio\u2019s earliest achievements are so colossal, so monumental, that most all of his later works pale by comparison. Each Sabbath album he led is worthy of owning and playing at high volumes, but each loses some magic that its predecessor possessed and is therefore a clear descent. Mob Rules is an excellent melodic heavy metal record, but outside of a few brilliant moments and a general appreciation for the songcraft, it cannot compare to Heaven and Hell and will not get nearly as many replays.\n",
        "\nAfter Ozzy Osbourne briefly left Black Sabbath, it would have been easy to think that Sabbath's original lineup was done. But, alas he reunited with his comrades in the Sab Four, and one more album was made, titled, ironically, \"Never Say Die!\". \n\nThat said, \"Never Say Die!\" perfectly sums up the band at this point, unfocused, tense, and druggy. Also evident is a complete disinterest of what the band is doing. They seem to no longer be working as a unit, but merely four men waiting to get out of this mess.\n\nBut there are a few bright spots. Most notably is the title track, which is catchy, simple and moreover fun, it isn't a signature Sabbath track, but is actually very good. Quite an encouraging start, sadly everything falls from there. Also, \"Juniors Eye\" is a halfway enjoyable song, besides that there isn't much here.\n\nWhy Black Sabbath ever introduced synthesizer's may never be known, but songs like \"Johnny Blade\" are just kind of boring and are prime examples of where it need not be used.\n\nAlso worth noting is \"Swinging the Chain\", which features drummer Bill Ward on vocals, and it becomes very clear why he became a drummer and not a singer. His singing isn't mediocre, but it's nothing to brag about, and the song just sounds like a Deep Purple b-side.\n\nOverall Black Sabbath's \"Never Say Die!\" is quite a bland end to the original era of the band. As it would happen Ozzy left the band once again and started his solo career with bang. While the band reformed with vocalist Ronnie James Dio and produced 2 more albums, with the original instrumentalists and some may say their dignity still intact. It must be stressed that this is a bland and generic album, and the only reason to get it is to have all the albums by the original lineup.\n",
        "\nIn the beginning, there was nothing. \n\nAnd then there was Black Sabbath. Four humble Englishmen brought heavy metal out of the shapeless void (aka heavy blues and European folk) and into corporeal existence. Who then proceeded to expand and develop it with each successive album. This is why the first six Black Sabbath albums, despite a few characteristic blemishes, are basically above criticism: they were basically inventing the shit that we listen to today. But by the time their seventh album Technical Ecstasy was released, metal was out of its formative stages and its bands were beginning to release some truly amazing stuff (Judas Priest\u2019s albums of the late 70\u2019s). Compared to the albums that preceded it, Technical Ecstasy was not particularly impressive. With its mind-boggling cover (brought to life from the mind of Geezer Butler by Hipgnosis, the studio that would famously work with various progressive rock bands like Pink Floyd and Yes), its frequent keyboard reliance, and its subdued, predictable sound, the album seemed to be sounding the funeral knell for Sabbath, thus leading to its 30+ years of being consistently underrated. But it\u2019s definitely underrated, because even with its crappier moments and different sound, it still has more than its fair share of Sab classics.\n\nFirst of these is album opener \u201cBack Street Kids.\u201d With its upbeat riffs and perfect groove, it\u2019s a wonder people don\u2019t like this song. Ozzy\u2019s voice still carries those distinct melodies and the band still operates as an effective heavy metal machine. Though they\u2019ve stepped back from the ambitious epics of Sabotage into more comfortable territory (\u201cAll Moving Parts (Stand Still),\u201d \u201cGypsy\u201d), it\u2019s still Black Sabbath as we\u2019ve always known them. Ward, Butler, and Iommi perform excellently, even on filler like \u201cRock \u2018n\u2019 Roll Doctor,\u201d a saloon-worthy number complete with honky-tonk piano.\n\nBut it\u2019s not all straightforward rocking numbers. The mysticism of Sabbath past (\u201cSpiral Architect,\u201d \u201cThe Writ\u201d) is not completely abandoned on Technical Ecstasy, as evidenced by \u201cYou Won\u2019t Change Me,\u201d and \u201cShe\u2019s Gone.\u201d The former utilizes keyboards to a more potent effect than on the album\u2019s other tracks to create a much-needed darker tone, as much of the album tends to lean toward the major keys. The latter is the most pristine ballad the band would ever compose, easily ousting \u201cChanges\u201d and the slew of fluff from their later career. Consisting of only Ozzy\u2019s voice and Tony\u2019s incredibly sad-sounding guitar backed by a string arrangement, it is remarkably moving for a Sabbath piece. \u201cDirty Women\u201d is the album\u2019s closer and longest track and, despite not being as profound a piece as say \u201cMegalomania,\u201d is the closest that Technical Ecstasy comes to recalling the doom and gloom of their earliest material. The fact that it\u2019s still pretty upbeat (however grimily so) just goes to show how different this album is from the material that precedes it.\n\nOh, there is also the little matter of \u201cIt\u2019s Alright,\u201d the Bill Ward composed ballad that he sung as well. A better title might have been \u201cIt\u2019s Filler Alright,\u201d as aside from a little Iommi guitar wizardry it\u2019s worthless. And keep that man away from the microphone, ugh.\n\nBut aside from the handful of weak tracks, it\u2019s a pretty good album that I enjoy listening to. It\u2019s just not a particularly good Black Sabbath album and I believe that that is what keeps it low in peoples\u2019 affection.\n",
        "\nNever Say Die is the eighth and final full studio album to be recorded by the original Black Sabbath, a title that it will likely never lose given the members\u2019 ages and current relationship. Ozzy Osbourne had already quit the band at this point; Tony Iommi somehow wrangled him back for a final album and tour, which despite what Sabbath\u2019s Number One Fan will tell you, was most notable as the one where the young whipper-snappers in Van Halen upstaged the crud out of the addled doom legends. The accompanying album fared little better: a spent, burnt out Sabbath farting around with watered down art rock arrangements and senseless experimentation, making the Technical Ecstasy record from two years prior seem positively dazzling by association. To date, it is one of only two Sabbath records I can\u2019t bring myself to purchase, which is quite the feat considering my long-time affection for the band. A new album with Ozzy singing should eventually surface, so let us recall this disasterpiece, and how a new Black Sabbath record probably won't be worse than this one. Although then again, things can always somehow get worse, as this album's tracklist so eloquently demonstrates.\n\nThe titular track is both opener and centerpiece, being perhaps the only song off the album to remain in the public consciousness since its release. That main chord progression is awfully reminiscent of a certain super-famous Thin Lizzy rocker, but what the heck, it was good enough for Dave Mustaine, so it\u2019s certainly good enough for me. It\u2019s straightforward and energetic and doesn\u2019t rely on Don Airey\u2019s keyboard contributions like so many of the album\u2019s later tracks. Not very heavy metal at the end of the day, but it\u2019s good fun for sure, first in a long line of born winners that Ozzy Osbourne would somehow always manage to be a part of, regardless of how terrible any given album of his might manage to be. A strong start indeed: it is immediately afterward that the album begins to unravel. Iommi and Butler\u2019s performance starts to lean away from the outright forward heaviness that had carried them more or less successfully through seven albums and start to blend into the background, highlighting vocals and playing off the keyboard melodies. This isn\u2019t necessarily a recipe for disaster, but when it\u2019s two of metal\u2019s best riff-crafters pulling punches, it\u2019s a serious no-no. \n\nFrom \u201cJohnny Blade\u201d onward, the Sabbath boys seem intent on being like Led Zeppelin: not as far as sonic similarities, but as far as trying to adapt themselves to alien genres. Remember how Zeppelin used to hop around in the back half of their career? Breaking out of their hard rock/blues/folk niche into reggae (\u201cD\u2019yer Mak\u2019er\u201d), calypso (\u201cFool in the Rain\u201d), synth pop (\u201cAll of My Love\u201d), rock and roll (\u201cCandy Store Rock,\u201d er... \u201cRock and Roll\u201d), symphonic rock (\u201cKashmir\u201d) etc., diversity was strived for, achieved, and often made interesting. This is Sabbath attempting roughly the same thing in a less extravagant manner, the key difference being that it\u2019s not Led Zeppelin doing it, but Black \u201cin the fields the bodies burning\u201d fucking Sabbath, and is imaginably inferior. Not that they haven\u2019t earned the right to try something different, but that they are (were) Black Sabbath and have no reason to do anything drastic like this, as Technical Ecstasy so eloquently proved to us. Anyway, \u201cJohnny Blade\u201d is the first diversion into alternative styles, in this case synth rock. Not quite Europe \u201cFinal Countdown\u201d hook depravity, but in the same ballpark. It kind of works, mostly in the slower, regressive bridge, but it requires serious dissociation in the listener\u2019s mind from the Sabbath of old. \n\nSame goes for the rest, but the job gets harder. \u201cJunior\u2019s Eyes\u201d rides a funk-ish bass line for much of its length and features some rather unpleasant attempts by Iommi at psychedelic lead fills. While not yet degrading himself to Heil Talk Box shenanigans, this makes for a rather annoying verse sequence, though even I\u2019ll admit Ozzy\u2019s vocal hook in the chorus is memorable. \u201cA Hard Road\u201d is more conventional, kind of like the blues rock other bands were playing in \u201972 while Sabbath was crushing out \u201cUnder the Sun.\u201d Unlike that killer, this piece overstays its welcome. \u201cShock Wave\u201d is a curious one: it\u2019s a limp-wristed lyrical revival of the evil spirits that haunted past Sabbath classics married to cheery Frampton-esque pop rock. And that \u201cwoo woo\u201d bit at the end\u2026 what\u2019s that sound? Ah yes, here comes the suck train! Whistle\u2019s blowing, all aboard! \n\nAs strange as this journey seems to be already, things get stranger still. \u201cAir Dance\u201d is the first of the Jazz Sabbath mini-odysseys, with Don Airey\u2019s piano taking lead here in such a baffling manner that I can\u2019t decide if it\u2019s bollocks or brilliance. It\u2019s like a sampling of the prog rock band they secretly wished to have been. \u201cOver to You\u201d is the second, playing like a slower, non-transcendental \u201cSpiral Architect.\u201d Again, it\u2019s a pretty bizarre, acquired taste sort of thing that seems to inspire either revelry or revulsion depending on the individual. After this, we finally get the nose dive into an empty pool that this album\u2019s been skirting around from track two. \u201cBreakout\u201d is a non-Sabbath jazz/ska diversion that\u2019s mostly a brass solo, while \u201cSwinging the Chain\u201d is, in a rare moment of good taste, the one track so banal that even Ozzy Osbourne refused to sing on it. Bill Ward does a better job vocally here than on \u201cIt\u2019s Bullshit Alright\u201d from the last album, but it\u2019s still redundant blues rock that, along with the penultimate track, lines the bottom of Sabbath\u2019s songwriting barrel. It would be many, many years with mostly different members before Sabbath would sink this low again.\n\nSatan, laughing, spreads his wings. Black Sabbath, sucking, spreads theirs and promptly tears themselves apart. For the Sabbath completionist, this album should be near the end of your list, right around Forbidden and Cash-Grab Greatest Hits Volume 15. Just because it probably could\u2019ve been worse doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s not still pretty terrible. It can always be worse, after all. Right Ozzy?\n",
        "\nAfter Ronnie James Dio left Black Sabbath, the band began wavering through some tumultuous lineup changes and sonic directions that would eventually lead to the magnificent power metal sound of the Tony Martin era. But before they would get there, they (as well as their fans) would have to wade through the mires of Born Again and Seventh Star, the latter of which is of primary concern for this review. In his drive for self-expression outside of the Black Sabbath moniker (and without his esteemed bandmates), legendary guitarist Tony Iommi would end up recording one of the worst albums in his four decade career, a shallow 80\u2019s hard rock record with only a few moments of glory.\n\nAs the story goes, Seventh Star was supposed to be Iommi\u2019s first solo album, but the Black Sabbath name was applied to sell more records. This would obviously lead most fans to approach this as a legit Sabbath album and it couldn\u2019t be further from the truth in overall sound or lineup. The only original Sabbath member is Tony himself, with part-time keyboardist Geoff Nicholls being the other familiar face. Glenn Hughes (of Deep Purple notoriety) is a welcome addition as vocalist and complements the rock-oriented material better than if it was a metal album. Eric Singer\u2019s plain-spoken drumming is not so welcome (the \u201cIn For The Kill\u201d verses are completely awkward because of his inability to stray from a straight-time beat) but adequate. Least welcome is Dave \u201cThe Beast\u201d Spitz, who plays bass on most of the songs and never even approaches anything \u2018beastly\u2019 in his performance. But this rag-tag lineup was concocted not to play Black Sabbath, but to play hard rock in an 80\u2019s \u2018hair metal\u2019 vein, which I suppose is still less disastrous than if they had attempted to play Sabbath-style heavy metal.\n\nSomething like half of the album is a waste, featuring crappy Deep Purple worship (\u201cIn for the Kill\u201d), crappy Dokken worship (\u201cDanger Zone,\u201d \u201cAngry Heart\u201d), and a really terrible ballad (\u201cNo Stranger to Love\u201d). Highlights consist of Tony\u2019s guitar solos and occasional Hughes melodies. The only redeeming songs are the ones that hearken back to 80\u2019s Sabbath past. \u201cTurn to Stone\u201d has a speed metal vibe that recalls \u201cNeon Knights\u201d or \u201cTurn Up the Night.\u201d Eric Singer\u2019s intro beat is pretty cool (not to mention loud as hell. Punish those drums, fella) and the song just generally rules. \u201cHeart Like a Wheel\u201d is one of those atmospheric, bluesy ones (\u201cVoodoo,\u201d \u201cLonely is the Word\u201d) that gives Glenn Hughes the opportunity to really excel. Lots of Iommi soloing prowess on this one, even if it\u2019s a bit long. The title track, like most Sabbath title tracks, is another one of the highlights, being another down-tempo atmospheric piece that might have musically fit onto Mob Rules somewhere. The little intro piece builds into it nicely and overall, it\u2019s probably the most satisfying musical offering on all of Seventh Star. \u201cIn Memory\u2026\u201d acts as an outro piece and though it\u2019s somewhat plain, it is brief, so for the time that it plays it is effective.\n\nTony Iommi would get another chance at a solo album a decade later (Glenn Hughes would again be asked upon for vocal duties) and the results would be better, but it doesn\u2019t change the fact that this is one of the worst albums to bear the Sabbath name.\n",
        "\nBlack Sabbath has probably been the most imitated band in history, which is a consequence of pioneering any genre of music, let alone one containing so many sub-genres. 1992 is a significant year for this subject as it was loaded with bands that were trying to recreate the spirit of this band during the Ozzy Osbourne years; many of them failing miserably in the process yet were embraced as amazing successes. However, even amongst better imitators such as Soundgarden and Alice in Chains in the grunge scene, all one need do is compare the students to the master and see how big the contrast is.\n\nDehumanizer is extravagant not in that it tries to paint as bleak of a picture as possible by focusing solely on the negative (which is what Alice in Chains\u2019 Dirt did), but in that it deals with darkness with an intellectual and musical flair that is more fitting to metal and all that falls under its umbrella. For example, many grunge bands took to the more doom and gloom approach to religion that was established on Metallica\u2019s rather forgettable MoP song \u201cLeper Messiah\u201d. By stark contrast, the lyrics to \u201cTV Crimes\u201d takes a quasi-satire approach to the issue of televangelism, and paints the less flattering picture of the TV bible-beater as a 2nd rate conman. Voltaire would definitely be proud of this one.\n\nThroughout the entire listen we are treated to a variety of lyrical themes that are quite a departure from RJD\u2019s earlier work with Sabbath. From the futuristic technological tyranny of \u201cComputer God\u201d to the egoistic anthem \u201cI\u201d, we get songs that are poetic, yet still catchy and easy to sing along with in the concert hall. We also get a taste of older Sabbath themes from back when Ozzy was still fronting the band such as the somber introspective song \u201cToo Late\u201d, and the social commentary included on such tracks as \u201cLetters from Earth\u201d and \u201cSins of the Father\u201d.\n\nThe music contained on here is a rather brilliant combination of several eras of Sabbath. \u201cAfter All (The Dead)\u201d sounds a good deal like \u201cDisturbing the Priest\u201d, while \u201cBuried Alive\u201d has an introductory riff that reminds a good deal of \u201cZero the Hero\u201d. \u201cTV Crimes\u201d and \u201cTime Machine\u201d could almost pass for faster tracks from the earlier RJD era of Sabbath, although the riffs do contain a darker tinge that keeps them in line with the subject of this album. \u201cMaster of Insanity\u201d is definitely similar to some of the darker tracks from the Ozzy era, and contains one hell of an evil sounding bass intro. \n\nSome of the music on here is a bit more original sounding, though still in line with the precedents set on previous efforts. \u201cToo Late\u201d starts off with a sad sounding acoustic guitar intro that sounds a tiny bit like \u201cOdin\u2019s Court\u201d off the last album, only to kick into some rather evil sounding electric guitar riffs that seem more in line with the dark title track to \u201cThe Eternal Idol\u201d. \u201cI\u201d has a very blues inspired intro that could pass for Sabbath\u2019s debut album in 1970, though the rest of the song sounds similar to some of Dio\u2019s later solo work.\n\nIf I had to pick the best standout track on this album it would have to be \u201cComputer God\u201d. Although I am a Sci-Fi junkie and am thus partial to the lyrics of this song (TV Crimes is a close second), the true power of this song for me comes from the riffs. Tony Iommi really outdid himself on this one, both in terms of the grand collection of great rhythm guitar lines and two rather amazing solos. Geezer Butler and Vinnie Appice also deserve credit for their efforts on this one, and of course kudos to Ronnie for the dramatic vocal performance.\n\nIn conclusion, this was and will forever be the greatest album of 1992, nothing else that was going on musically during this time period even hopes to come close to this. It is unfortunate that this reunion was short lived, but on the bright side both Dio and Sabbath would go on to have solid releases in 1994. This album is recommended highly to all fans of Sabbath and all fans of metal; it stood tall and told the masses in one gigantic shout what metal was all about, despite the fact that many of the ears that they were shouting at had been deafened by the noise of Nirvana\u2019s Nevermind and a host of other bands vomiting out musical debris.\n",
        "\nThe phenomena of the greatest hits compilation has always been an issue for the core metal fan, the reasons for this are many. The primary one is that such compilations are usually devoid of the more musically ambitious material, particularly the long-winded epics and jam sessions that occupied all 6 of the albums represented on here. Therefore I think it is necessary to point out that, contrary to what the pedestrian metal fans says, this album is defined more by what it leaves out rather than what is included in it.\n\nYou have some longer songs on here, such as \u201cWar Pigs\u201d, \u201cNIB\u201d, and \u201cBlack Sabbath\u201d, but for the most part we see that most of the really long ones that occurred on the latter 3 albums have not been included. There are two reasons for this, the first being that the structures of those songs (Megalomania, The Writ, Wheels of Confusion, Into the Void, et cetera) have highly experimental structures, the second being that many of these other songs have lyrical subjects that contradict the dark/occult theme of this compilation.\n\nMost people who listen to music casually can\u2019t stand it when that chorus doesn\u2019t come back right away or when there is a complete change in feel within the same tune. Mainstream bands usually pander to this fear of change and keep their songs a bit too simple as a result, and if one were to go only by this compilation one would be getting a very narrow view of Black Sabbath\u2019s musical career and assume them to be ones to cater to some sort of mainstream. Even in the longer songs there is a general consistency and a similarity between the varying sections.\n\nAs to the rather clich\u00e9 theme of occultism that is present in the title of this compilation, this defines about maybe 1/3 of their music at best. The drug use and other dark themes probably take it up to about perhaps half of their music up to this point, but still not a full picture of all the amazing things going on in their music. Sometimes I wonder if this so-called Satan worship stuff that this band often gets pegged with is a consequence of the widespread success of this compilation.\n\nHowever, despite this compilation being only about half the story of Sabbath, it does function well as a gateway into their earlier music. The only thing I would suggest is to be prepared to get some music that will not conform to the tone set on here if you choose to purchase their full length albums, particularly \u201cSabbath Bloody Sabbath\u201d and \u201cSabotage\u201d. \n\nIn conclusion, this album is recommended mostly to those who have never heard Sabbath other than what they probably hear on the radio. People who have the money and want a really great listening experience are advised to go straight to the full length studio releases. I bought this album right after purchasing \u201cParanoid\u201d, and I eventually ended up getting every Sabbath album ever released. Consequently this album does not enjoy any play time in my CD player, which is why I did not give it a higher score. Core fans of metal buy entire albums and listen to them all the way through, only pedestrian metal fans settle for a compilation of a band such as this\n",
        "\nBy the year 1975 the rock music community was beginning to take serious notice of the new phenomena known as heavy metal, which was then still defined as an ultra-hard kind of rock with some rather blatant progressive elements. In the following 36 years legions of bands specialized in certain specific areas of the pioneer work of Black Sabbath. The traditional metal crowd looked to the guitar driven early albums that were the debut and Paranoid, while thrash and speed metal groups looked to the harder edged sound of Master of Reality and Vol. 4. For Power Metal fans such as me Sabbath Bloody Sabbath was the grand source of inspiration, though what I choose to focus on with that album is taken differently from the vast community of Progressive Metal outfits. \n\nThe influence of Sabbath did not waver with the end of 80s metal, as a series of other bands would naturally look to them for similar inspiration, most notably the more metal-like bands in the grunge movement, the ones whose only characteristic tying them to that scene was their image. Every genre of metal and the various other sounds associated with it are defined both by what elements of Sabbath are utilized, and what elements are not emphasized. Out of all these genres, the Progressive Metal scene has stayed closest to the spirit that defined Sabbath\u2019s actual mission, which was the pursuit of destroying musical boundaries, of creating something new and great without being tied down to an unnecessary box of arbitrary rules.\n\nSabotage represents the purest display of Sabbath\u2019s progressive tendencies, much in the same vain that Sabbath Bloody Sabbath did, but with a large focus on building a series of musical epics that give a feeling of triumph and power. Many bands have tried to capture the feeling of this album, such acts as Symphony X, Ayreon, Queensryche, Dream Theatre and Fates Warning are probably the most obvious examples. But it is important to note that the large array of choices present in this album provide for a lot of potential directions, and as anyone who has listened to the bands mentioned will tell you, they all have a highly individualized sound and can easily be told apart. This is ultimately a consequence of the complexity and the power of this album, as the consequence of Sabbath itself was the birth of metal as we know it today.\n\nWe kick this album off with the straight-forward rocker \u201cHole in the Sky\u201d, dominated by a powerful guitar sound that rivals the punch sound that was heard on Vol. 4. The lyrics depict a man loosing his grip on reality, something that it quite prevalent in this album. We then move to the somber acoustic interlude \u201cDon\u2019t Start too late\u201d, which is among a host of acoustic interludes that no doubt influenced more progressive acts such as Fates Warning to write similarly short acoustic compositions. \u201cSymptom of the Universe\u201d is a heavier track with loads of emphasis on the guitar, and some amazing lead work. The main riff is pure evil, almost like a horror variation on Zepplin\u2019s \u201cCommunication Breakdown\u201d. We end with an acoustic section, in which Ozzy showcases his newly found high range with flair reminiscent of his surprisingly great vocal work on the last album.\n\n\u201cMegalomania\u201d is one of the more progressive tracks on here, and the most epic one that clocks in at a near 10 minute duration. It has its evil sections, its gloomy sections, and its soothing moments. Nearly every Progressive act that came out of the 80s up to the present have a fair share of songs that most likely take their cues from this one, Symphony X\u2019s \u201cThe Odyssey\u201d and \u201cThrough the Looking Glass\u201d sound highly similar to this. The guitar has its fair share of action on here, but ironically Ozzy\u2019s vocal performance is the highlight. Plenty of vocal effects on here as well, ranging from echo sounds to some vocal processors to give the background voice track a demonic sound.\n\n\u201cThrill of it All\u201d is heavily guitar driven, with a highly distinctive opening riff, and a rather brilliant guitar solo to kick the song off. We do get a piano in the middle section for a brief time, just to change the song up and give it a more progressive feel, but it mostly sticks to the guitar as its dominant force. \u201cSupertzar\u201d is, without a doubt, the most amazing instrumental that this band has ever put out. This is the spirit that every Progressive/Power Metal band has shot for whenever writing either an interlude or an intro to an album with a highly epic subject matter to it. This song was definitely ahead of it\u2019s time, having such a regal spirit to it that almost sounds like it could have appeared on a Rhapsody album. Although I am partial to Sabbath Bloody Sabbath as an album, this song has had at least an equal influence on bands like my own as the main riff of that song\u2019s title track.\n\n\u201cAm I going Insane\u201d has a very prominent synthesizer line at its onset, and flows pretty much as a continuation of the progressive spirit already on full display, though in a simpler structure, making it the obvious choice for a single. \u201cThe Writ\u201d closes off the album with another strong epic that doesn\u2019t quite go as long as Megalomania, but comes fairly close. We kick it off with a rocking guitar riff and Ozzy doing a rather well done Robert Plant style vocal performance. The lyrics deal mostly with introspection, a topic that is largely explored, though in a more intellectual way, by bands such as Dream Theatre and Aryeon. We have some rather heavily contrasted sections, as the keyboards and the guitar seem to be fighting each other for prominence towards the end.\n\nIn conclusion, this is regarded in many fields as the best and most purely metal album that Sabbath has ever released, and there are many good arguments in favor of this. Ultimately which album you gravitate towards the most will determine the genre of music that you will love the most/ will be the most drawn towards as a musician. I gave this album a perfect score because as the most progressive work on here, it embodies the most universal representation of the metal spirit. However, as I am a man who gravitates towards a specific genre more than others, my favorite album is Sabbath Bloody Sabbath. But more important than any individual album, I love this genre of music because of the amazing diversity, the unique manifestations of individuality exhibited by each band in each genre, and it all comes back to 4 men from Birmingham who dared to see a world beyond the old wall of sound.\n",
        "\nIt\u2019s pretty much an accepted fact that after the exodus of Ronnie Dio and Vinnie Appice that the line-up of Black Sabbath was thrown into a state of disarray. However, this time period also reveals the true master and driving force behind the Sabbath machine, Tony Iommi. If he had not been in the band, you would have had just another stoner group who would have been passed off as a slightly angrier version of the hippie scene. \u201cBorn Again\u201d was recorded by all 3 of the instrumentalists that founded Black Sabbath (although Bill Ward didn\u2019t last for the following tour), but the one who really gives this album its unique charm is the man throwing out the memorable guitar riffs.\n\nFor those of you whom are not historical buffs when it comes to Black Sabbath, Ian Gillian was quoted as stating \u201cI was the worst singer Black Sabbath ever had\u201d. To this I only agree in the respect that other than Glenn Hughes, whom is not considered by most to be of an era where Sabbath existed, he lasted the shortest and thus didn\u2019t contribute as much as Ozzy, Ronnie Dio, and Tony Martin did. However, when it comes to his singing, his voice was not at all out of step with what Sabbath does, his banshee wails were right at home in the post-Dio era where Sabbath was more defined by it\u2019s epic pursuits rather than the politically/horror charged elements that defined the Ozzy era. The only thing that really contradicted with Sabbath was Ian Gillian\u2019s image and his inability to see the humor in the album cover they got.\n\nThe songs on this album are highly varied, thus the overall flow of this album is more comparable to the mid-70s Ozzy era (Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, Sabotage), rather than their more recent work. You have your more straight-forward rock metal tracks such as \u201cHotline\u201d and \u201cKeep it Warm\u201d, featuring some inventive pentatonic riffs and some rather sexually charged lyrics. You\u2019ve also got some rather interesting short instrumentals in \u201cStonehenge\u201d and \u201cThe Dark\u201d, both of which provide rather unusual yet powerful sounding segues into the two most memorable tracks on here. You\u2019ve got your more up tempo metal tunes such as the amazingly heavy yet lyrically lighthearted \u201cTrashed\u201d and the equally fun yet slightly less heavy track \u201cDigital Bitch\u201d. We also have what resembles a slow ballad in the title track, although the vocal performance and heavier sections put a more agitated feel to it.\n\nWe have two songs on here that, unlike the former ones, are groundbreaking in their makeup. \u201cZero the Hero\u201d is a rather brilliant riff monster that clocks in at over 7 minutes and features some rather evil sounding keyboard work. This formula to song creation would be brought back in some ways with such tracks as \u201cAnno Mundi\u201d and \u201cThe Eternal Idol\u201d. And the highlight of the album \u201cDisturbing the Priest\u201d is an interesting hybrid of the evil sounds that had disturbed the priests back in the early 70s and the epic feel of the Ronnie Dio era. Ian Gillian\u2019s wails, contrary to what other critics may say, are not in any way out of place on this song, nor are the evil laughs that he throws in at the end.\n\nAlthough this would otherwise be a perfect album, we do have 2 rather noticeable flaws. The primary one is the production, which is a bit too heavy on the drums and doesn\u2019t bring out the heavy guitars enough at times. This is most obvious on a few parts of \u201cZero the Hero\u201d and \u201cDigital Bitch\u201d, though in general I think the production of the drums is a bit overdone. The other flaw is that although Ian Gillian doesn\u2019t sing any sour notes on here, at times he sounds like he\u2019s slightly behind rhythmically. This must have been the result of hearing loss when Ritchie Blackmore pointed his maxed out amplifier right in Gillian\u2019s direction during their lengthy tours in Deep Purple together.\n\nIn conclusion, this is a very misunderstood release that I would hypothesize is the victim of core Ozzy fans ripping on an album without even listening to it carefully. The songs on here are strong, as are the individual performances contained within. I can recommend this album to fans of Sabbath\u2019s Dio and Martin era catalog, as it tends a bit more towards those eras, although we have some obvious references to the early days of the band. Fans of Power Metal may find some things to like, and certain pockets of the Doom base may like this album at moments.\n",
        "\nAfter creating the genre of Heavy Metal with their first album, Black Sabbath decided to move away from the quite noticeable blues and jazz elements of the first album and focus on the heavier side of things. The result was another masterpiece of heavy music, and whilst they had previously released their debut the same year there is such a noticeable leap between styles in the two albums that it is hard to believe that they were released in such short periods of time. There are still blues and jazz elements to be found littered throughout the album but for the most part they have been stripped away. The real progression found here though is how much heavier and improvised it is than it's predecessor, from the solos to the slow, heavy riffs which would later go on to form Doom Metal.\n\nThe album kicks off with War Pigs, one of Sabbath's longest songs which begins with a slow, bass driven intro with sirens in the background and suddenly stops. Ozzy Osbourne comes in with the best performance of his career and some awesome riffing starts after the first verse. Iommi shows off his soloing skills to a great extent in this song towards the end of the song. One of the finer songs of Sabbath's career.\n\nNext up is Paranoid, which sort of reminds me of Highway Star, although slowed down a bit. Although I do agree it is overplayed I still find myself enjoying this song whenever I pop the Paranoid disc in. There's a nice effect with the vocals going on, which sound like they're ecohing.\n\nAlthough I didn't like it at first, after repeated listens I rather enjoy 'Planet Caravan', for its atmosphere and lengthy jazz influenced solo. The trippy effects which are present add to the atmosphere, and although the bass is a little low in the mix it is a rather enjoyable, relaxing song. I suppose it would be good to listen to while under the influence (as some other reviewers said) but I haven't tried that as of yet.\n\nIron Man wakes you up from the trance which Planet Caravan put you in with some guitar noises and that famous scream of Iron Man. Despite having a killer main riff though, the song doesn't hold my attention as much as it used to, probably due to over saturation and me listening to it too many times. The solo in the middle and the end keeps me listening though, and still makes me worship at the altar of Iommi. It is also one of the more catchy songs on the album, I remember when I first heard it I could remember it until I obtained a copy for myself.\n\nElectric Funeral has a somewhat depressing main riff which suits the lyrical themes of nuclear war. Although Ozzy's voice can get a little annoying at times, his performance is still fairly good. At around 1:50 it speeds up into a faster riff with high pitched vocals from Ozzy only to return to the previous part. Probably one of the weaker songs on the album, but then again that could be the case of listening to it too many times again.\n\nHand of Doom is one of the highlights of this album, and listening to it makes you realise how it created and inspired Doom Metal. It goes from a bass driven riff to a heavy chorus which then returns to the verse. It then proceeds to speed up a little into a more upbeat riff which leads into an awesome heavy part, and then into another great solo, after which it returns to the bass driven verse. The lyrical themes are about someone who died of an overdose due to not being able to control his habit. The riffs pummel you into the ground with their heaviness and the vocals go from quiet to loud perfectly.\n\nRat Salad is another song I initially didn't like at first, but then got to love it. Basically consisting of a riff and solo at the start it then has a long drum solo in the middle. Although I usually don't enjoy drum solos that much, this one kept my attention due to not being overlong (which to me is usually the death of drum solos). Jack the Stripper/Fairies wear boots finishes the album well with some great soloing and riffing.\n\nThis album, although containing some ridiculously overplayed songs, stands the test of time and I still find myself listening to it every week or two. I wouldn't say this is overrated in any way, and even today it remains a masterpiece of Metal. It advanced the Metal genre by a large extent, and for that reason alone it is a must have, but what really makes it stand head and shoulders about the crowd is the riffs and soloing present, as well as excellent drumming and great vocals. The fact that it was released in 1970 only further adds to the greatness of it. Essential.\n",
        "\nThis album gets bashed alot, which makes no sense at all because it rocks! Of course, it really isn't traditonal Sabbath at all, as 1983 saw the introduction of frontman Ian Gillian of Deep Purple fame, and he did bring some of the influence with him, which makes for a great album. Now the only 2 bad points of the album here is low production, and the fact that its short on actual songs, with \"Stonehenge\" and \"The Dark\" just being creepy noise tracks, not that theres anything wrong with them, they give off a great feel and do great on the album, but there's still room for a few more songs to be fit on here. Also, there's no real big deal about the cover on this, it looks pretty cool & evil, and is far from offensive unless your a complete dumbass (sorry Gillian, but it's not appalling, if anything it looks like it came from Monty Python). \n\nWith that said, the music on here is great, the riffs are heavy and tear along, Iommi solos at his best, Gillian's voice fits very well, and Geezer's bass thunders along right with Ward's drums, and for the most part this is a great dark & heavy album. The album starts off with the excellent rocker \"Trashed\" that has a great driving riff and it just really rocks out, one of my favorites. It then moves into the above-mentioned \"Stonehenge\" which serves as a great connector piece into \"Disturbing The Priest\" which is a great heavy classic doom song that has some nice guitar playing in it. Gillian's laughter is a little laughable after awhile though. The lyrics here are great though, and very true. \"The Dark\" serves as another piece that segues into \"Zero The Hero\" which has a great riff, and is just a classic song. The solo's are great on all of these songs and it just leaves you wanting more. This would be the end of side 1 on the original album. \n\n\"Digital Bitch\" is the next song up and the songs rocks along, however the lyrics are a little silly. The title track is a ballad, and a great one at that, Gillan's vocals sound excellent on this going from low to high notes. \"Hot Line\" is another song that rocks along with some nice riffs. The album closes with \"Keep It Warm\" which is another slower song whose lyrics arent really typical for Sabbath, but its a good song and ends the album well. \n\nI strongly suggest buying this album, it ranks among their best, and is really the last excellent Black Sabbath album (there's a few good ones to follow, but they never really came back full force), you'll love it.\n",
        "\nIt had been 4 years since the release of their highly innovative debut record, and they had already put out 3 subsequent releases that all featured a uniquely progressive sound, but the true awakening that this band would bring about had yet to fully manifest itself. \u201cSabbath Bloody Sabbath\u201d is a culmination of all that Sabbath came to embody in their glory days of the 70s, heavy music that would refuse to conform to the mainstream norms of the time. Previous reviewers have already made note of the vast number of new instruments that have been included to complement Sabbath\u2019s established sound, but what I think is often missed is the true consequences of what those instruments, along with the usual sounds that the band creates, actually ended up producing.\n\nThis album is often referred to as the first progressive album to grace the metal genre, and for good reason too, as Sabbath has been at the forefront of bringing new technology to rock music. This progression still holds sway with today\u2019s latest metal acts. The violin work found on \u201cSpiral Architect\u201d created a precedent of marrying classical music with metal that would manifest into the fully symphonic style, as spearheaded by bands such as Rhapsody. The heavy amount of synthesizer work on \u201cwho are you?\u201d inspired a whole generation of progressive rockers, although credit must also be given to Rush for perfecting the model that is now used by such bands as \u201cDream Theatre\u201d and \u201cSymphony X\u201d. \n\nWhat is often missed by reviewers is the highly technical elements involved in this album, not only in terms of structure, but in the sheer display of dexterity by the musicians involved. \u201cSabbra Cadabra\u201d has an incredibly inventive and difficult riff at the beginning, one that is well known for being the riff that exposed Kirk Hammet\u2019s flaws as a player. Truth be told, I struggled with this riff greatly when I played this song in my own band, it definitely showcases a strong sense of rhythm on the part of Tony Iommi. The rest of the song is loaded with some rather brilliant musical changes, including some fine piano playing, and the usually active bass and drum work. \n\nOne criticism that is often lobbed at this release is that the guitar is a bit too muddy, to which I will simply state that this the tone is as heavy as the last two albums but it mixes much better with all the extra instruments much better this way. Songs such as the title track, \u201cKilling Yourself to Live\u201d and \u201cA National Acrobat\u201d are heavy enough and also contain some rather interesting sounds in the lead tracks. The latter of the 3 tracks takes my pick for the best guitar solo on this album, as Tony has truly turned his multi-track leads into 2 dueling guitars that go in completely different directions.\n\nOne would wonder why this album would get a perfect score from me when I have passed up such amazing works both before and after this album with Ozzy, but upon listening to this CD, the answer becomes immediately obvious. I don\u2019t know what happened between Vol. 4 and this release but somewhere along the way Ozzy\u2019s voice got a whole lot better. There isn\u2019t a single track on here where I find his voice to be either grating or unpleasant. In fact, in the cases of the title track and \u201cLook for Today\u201d I think his voice is utterly amazing. He has a rather good command of the higher register, and his voice actually manages to transition well between the acoustic and electric sections of both songs.\n\nI also wanted to give special kudos to the band for the long yet highly enjoyable instrumental \u201cfluff\u201d. Unlike previous releases where instrumentals or quiet ballads would either be too repetitive or too musically flat, this one is loaded with amazing moments. The piano and harpsichord work on here is nothing short of spellbinding, to speak nothing of all the great acoustic guitar tracks. If there is a flaw in this song it is that there are so many tracks on here that it would be impossible for 5 people to recreate the dense atmosphere accomplished on this studio recording.\n\nI will now take a moment to single out one particular track on this album, and that is the well known yet often underrated title track. Ever since hearing this song it has remained my favorite of all the songs ever recorded by this band with Ozzy doing the singing (third favorite of this band as a whole). This song\u2019s true impact is not fully realized by many, mostly because it lacks some of the key elements that defined the genre that it helped spawn, particularly the speed that was taken more from Deep Purple, Rainbow and Judas Priest. Yes my friends, I speak of the genre of melodic power metal. This riff is one that would often be used as inspiration for the music of bands such as Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Gamma Ray, and a host of other bands associated with the current explosion of melodic power metal. It is no accident that when invited to appear on the Sabbath tribute album that Bruce Dickinson chose this song. This also is the song that I play most with my own band, and I take lead vocal duties on this one always, because it is the song that inspired my first set of original compositions. This song is absolutely timeless, and will undoubtedly continue to inspire many great heavy metal acts for decades to come.\n\nIn conclusion, although this album is mostly geared towards the Progressive and Melodic side of metal, with a bit less emphasis on the doom, I highly recommend it to all. It presents Sabbath at their most polished and their most powerful. You wouldn\u2019t know by listening to it that the band who recorded it was tiring from 4 straight years of touring and also releasing 4 studio efforts during that period. This band was about as driven as they come, and the music that they have created never ceases to drive young musicians to pick up and instrument and make one hell of a beautiful racket.\n",
        "\nWe have now come to the fourth studio effort of the Black Sabbath journey and things pretty much are going as they have gone. In many ways this album is more comparable to \u201cMaster of Reality\u201d than to the two previous releases, as Tony has his guitar down-tuned even further, resulting in a still heavier sound. Ozzy\u2019s voice is getting better, although when it\u2019s exposed enough it can still grate on the ears. However, the experimental aspect of the band is still going full steam ahead as we have some new ground broken in a few of the tracks.\n\nAmongst the longer and more structurally inventive works on here are \u201cWheels of Confusion\u201d and \u201cUnder the Sun\u201d, the song that opens the album and the one that closes it. The former has a mostly pleasant melodic vibe that is comparable \u201cAfter Forever\u201d off the last album, but at the end it kicks into a more complex figure that sounds a bit like the later work that Sabbath would do with Ronnie Dio, and we have a rather excellent guitar solo to close things out. The latter, by contrast, is one of the heaviest tracks that Sabbath has ever put out, using a set of notes that sound almost as eerie as the ones that compose the main riff of \u201cBlack Sabbath\u201d. \n\nWe also have a rather exceptional collection of straight-forward rockers on here that have the same heaviness to them. \u201cSupernaut\u201d is probably the heaviest out of the shorter tracks, although it is also where the drums get a chance to shine during the long middle section. \u201cTomorrow\u2019s Dream\u201d is probably the most memorable track on here, highlighting 2 very distinctive riffs and a rather simplistic yet riveting solo. \u201cCornucopia\u201d is another very heavy track with some rather cryptic lyrics, I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s some sort of a song about either the horrors of drug addiction or the power of government. \u201cSt. Vitus Dance\u201d is a shorter quasi-doom track that features some rather negative lyrics about love, the only thing I wish is that the put some sort of guitar solo into this or some musical change, this song seems a bit underdeveloped. \u201cSnowblind\u201d has a highly distinctive main riff to it, but the real treats are the primary solo section and the trill happy outro solo that\u2019s loaded with pentatonic shredding. The subject matter of the lyrics deal primarily with cocaine addiction, which was probably the only major drug that they have yet to cover in their songs.\n\nThe lone ballad \u201cChanges\u201d is the obvious weak link on the album. I\u2019m a metal fan who tends to show a lot of tolerance and even approval towards ballads, but in this particular case we have some serious problems. The first is obvious, Ozzy still can\u2019t get his voice to sound good when it\u2019s overly exposed. \u201cPlanet Caravan\u201d worked so well because of the effects on his voice and the atmosphere of the overall song, but on this song we have only a piano to accompany Ozzy, and a piano doesn\u2019t cover up anything. The other problem is that the song is far too repetitive and also lacks any solos or contrasting sections. Ultimately you have 2 different piano lines, both of which are extremely simple, and you have the occasional entry of some background strings.\n\nThe two instrumentals on here are essentially night and day. \u201cLaguna Sunrise\u201d is a fun and enjoyable instrumental with some charming acoustic guitar work and some accompanying orchestral sounds. \u201cFX\u201d is a collection of digital delay steeped sounds made on a guitar that are devoid of anything musical. The obvious function of such a song is to freak out someone who is listening to the album while high, and as I\u2019m not into destroying my own mind, I have little use for such incoherent noise.\n\nTo sum it all up, we have 8 rather excellent songs and 2 that are pretty much throwaways. I\u2019m going to cut the band some slack because it\u2019s obvious that they tried a bit too hard to keep things original with these 2 particular songs, but also keep in mind that there is such a thing is creating something that is both original and horrible. Although this album comes highly recommended, I think the audience for people who would have an interest in this particular album for historical value would be limited to the heavier genres of doom and thrash, as this album is built more upon riffs than melody.\n",
        "\nThe third installment of the work of our heavy metal forefathers sees a lot of evolution both in sound and subject matter. Not ones to be boxed into one specific sound, the 4 horsemen of Black Sabbath have succeeded once again in both maintaining the hard edged sound that they are pioneered and not repeated themselves. It is noteworthy also to note the radically short amount of time that passed in between the first 3 albums, as it is pretty much unheard of today for any band to put out 3 albums in two years.\n\nWhere the first album was built mostly upon a non-conventional approach to structure, and the second one mainly played off of technical intrigue, this album is more straight-forward in structure and focuses on heaviness more than anything else. If you play the guitar parts to \u201cLord of this World\u201d and \u201cInto the Void\u201d through a modern sounding distortion setting, you will have something equally as heavy as what the likes of Pantera and Metallica were doing in the early 90s, although it is far more musical in my view in the case of Sabbath.\n\nMuch of the heaviness found on this album owes to a combination of necessity and purpose. Purpose in the sense that the riffs are constructed very deliberately, focusing less on variation and more on a powerful yet simple pattern of notes. Necessity in the sense that Tony Iommi\u2019s injury to his hand, which occurred before Sabbath recorded their first album, required him to further down tune his guitar in order to reduce the resistance of the strings. While guys like Jimmy Page and Eric Clapton managed to occasionally play something fast and impressive, this guy was shredding up a storm (by the standards of the time), despite often inflicting pain upon himself in the process. This is what being a heavy metal guitar player is all about, ripping it up no matter what tries to stop you.\n\nAs stated before, this album has a more simplistic approach to structure than the previous albums, but this does not mean that we don\u2019t have any progressive moments. \u201cSweet Leaf\u201d has one of the most insane middle sections I\u2019ve heard, and is probably the closest thing to a power metal song. The subject matter of the song would seem a contradiction in the band\u2019s previous message found in \u201cThe Hand of Doom\u201d, although one must consider a few things. Marijuana use historically has not been as menacing to human happiness as other drugs such as LSD and Heroine. Like all the things, the sweet leaf that these guys sing of can do some serious damage in excess, and some might argue that Ozzy\u2019s lack of an ability to speak without stuttering like crazy might be connected to his drug use. Suffice to say, like alcoholic beverages it\u2019s harm is minimal, but I would recommend that you have someone else drive if you\u2019re on the stuff.\n\nOther tracks such as \u201cChildren of the Grave\u201d and \u201cAfter Forever\u201d are a bit faster throughout and loaded with socially conscious lyrics. The former is a call to arms directed at the youth of the world to seek other enterprises aside from self-destruction. Unlike various forms of propaganda that dwell upon specifics, this song takes a very generalized approach and can apply to the world that we live in today. It has a great deal of excellent riffs, particularly the main one which is constantly reused in many variants by bands in both the thrash and power metal genres. The latter song, by contrast, is a very light and melodic number that is comparable to later Sabbath songs such as \u201cNeon Knights\u201d and \u201cTurn up the Night\u201d. The lyrical subject matter borderlines on Christian rock evangelism, and was probably a bit influential amongst certain bands, particularly 80s mainstream Christian hair band Stryper. I\u2019m not one to complain about such things as I myself am a practicing Catholic, but I do wonder if maybe these so-called Black Metal purists who live and die by despising religion can explain to me where they get off on glossing over songs like this when stating that Metal and Religion are not compatible.\n\nThe remaining 2 tracks on here are both acoustic ditties, that surround the heavy anthem \u201cChildren of the Grave\u201d. Many people complain about these tracks as they don\u2019t seem to function well being so close together, let alone including 2 short instrumentals in a song that only has 8 songs and runs less than 40 minutes. To this I can only respond that the songs serve the purpose of showcasing a varied approach to music and a defiance of conventional thinking, and in this particular case it didn\u2019t fully work out as intended. These tracks are pleasing to the ears, but I will admit that they are the lone weak link on this album as they don\u2019t seem to serve much purpose and sort of throw off the album\u2019s structure.\n\nIn conclusion, Sabbath\u2019s \u201cMaster of Reality\u201d sees the sound of metal continuing to blossom and branch out, now encompassing the heavy sound from which thrash and power metal take their cues. We also see a tendency towards brief instrumentals which also are often found in more recent metal efforts. Ozzy\u2019s voice is continuing to improve, and all of the others are continuing to expand the capabilities of their styles. In a universal sense, this is Sabbath\u2019s most metal moment in their original line-up, thought I personally view \u201cSabbath Bloody Sabbath\u201d as their overall finest moment. I recommend this album to all fans of metal, but particularly to fans of Doom, Thrash and Power Metal as it is a pioneering effort that laid the framework for these genres.\n",
        "\nOne need only take a look at the time span between this album and the last to understand how driven this band was. Being able to compose and record this much groundbreaking music within the span of a single year is something that few bands are known for. However, it is important to understand that although we do have some changes, for the most part the approach to non-conventional musical structure and dark imagery is still heavily present.\n\nLyrically this album doesn\u2019t deal much with the occult themes that were present in the previous album. We see references the devil within the context of punishment being delivered towards evil war mongering politicians and the metaphorical application of hell to the state of drug addiction, but nothing that presents the same context that the spooky title track of the last album gave us. We see a more intelligent approach to socio-political issues, as this album is pretty much devoid of the flower power scene, and is closer to the rational criticisms that exposed the philosophical bankruptcy of the time.\n\nAs stated before, we still have the same non-conventional approach to songwriting that was present in the previous album. \u201cWar Pigs\u201d is probably the most long-winded example of this, carrying a rather large collection of varied, though more cohesive musical sections. The main during the last section of the song (I think this is the theme to \u201cLuke\u2019s Wall\u201d) is probably one of the most memorable guitar riffs ever written. \u201cFairies wear boots\u201d is also fairly complex, containing the famous recurring guitar solo section, in addition to a memorable set of quasi-blues driven power chord lines. \u201cIron Man\u201d has probably the most simple structure for the longer tracks on here, but still contains a good deal of changes, and some highly memorable guitar solos. \n\nThe experimentation on this album has been taken a step further with the rather heavily drum oriented \u201cRat Salad\u201d. Being one who is a fan of drums, I appreciate when they are done right, and unlike Zepplin\u2019s rather ridiculous \u201cMoby Dick\u201d this one makes musical sense. If any of you fans of live drum solos wish to get a good studio version of what you like, this is the place to go.\n\nOther tracks such as \u201cElectric Funeral\u201d and \u201cParanoid\u201d are a bit more straight-forward in structure, though still very far removed from anything else going on at the time. The former has a very evil sounding main riff, in addition to a rather abrupt tempo change in the middle. The lyrics are horrific in their description of the aftermath of a nuclear bomb exploding. The latter song is probably the fastest song to come out at the time, and although others like Deep Purple would push the envelope further, this is probably the earliest version of what we now know as thrash/speed metal.\n\n\u201cHand of Doom\u201d is another early incarnation of the doom metal genre, and although not as dark as the title track of the debut, this one has it\u2019s fair share of darkness in both the music and subject matter. Although the guitar tone is not as heavy as what would qualify as doom today, the riff itself transfers quite well into the genre today if put through the right kind of distorted amp setting. The lyrics are a rather graphic description of what drugs do to a human being, and indirectly is a condemnation of the glorification of drug use that was rampant in the 60s counter-culture. Metal has historically had a better history of accurately criticizing what goes on in the world than it\u2018s punk and classic rock counterparts, and here we see an example of how effective it is at it.\n\nWe have one rather interesting outlier on this album, and that is the rather atmospheric ballad \u201cPlanet Caravan\u201d. Ozzy\u2019s voice is at it\u2019s best on this one as it has been loaded with effects, all of which help to cover the flaws in his vocal performance, which are gradually becoming less obvious on this release in comparison to the previous one. But the true prowess of this song is Tony Iommi\u2019s rather jazz influenced guitar solo, which goes on for about 2 minutes and does not get boring. Ladies and Gentlemen, I can say affirmatively and completely that Tony Iommi made this band as great as it was, not Ozzy.\n\nOn a side note, it has been mentioned by many that a large collection of the songs on here have not aged well due to overplay, to this I would make the following suggestions to my friends. Stop listening to the fucking radio, it is the musical manifestation of the tyranny of the majority, hoping that it will conform to what heavy metal is will do nothing but frustrate you. Take all the money that you break your back to procure and buy the songs on CD, and take control of your musical consumption. If you lack the motivation to do this, I would suggest learning to live with the fact that the masses that will the DJ\u2019s hand care not for what you think or believe in. To the DJ and his masters, \u201cIron Man\u201d, \u201cParanoid\u201d and \u201cWar Pigs\u201d are not heavy metal songs, they are token songs from a genre that they prefer not to think about. Copies of albums were built for one purpose, to realize the personal property aspect of music, which is a personal connection between the artist and the individual listener. \n\nIn conclusion, this is another early draft in the history of heavy metal, one that would see a bit more polish and intrigue. This album caries a lot of essential listening, tracks that have furthered the influence of it\u2019s predecessor into a slightly more accessible formula. Like the first release, it is essential for all fans of metal to own it as it provides important historical perspective to where our music comes from. I listen to it often, and although I don\u2019t look to it much for compositional inspiration, I know full well that most of the bands that I do look to for that influence took it from here.\n",
        "\nPeople often shelf this album in favor of the ones that followed due to the inconsistency it possesses. But to all my fellow younger metal heads out there, I will now make an analogy. The original form of democracy of Ancient Athenian Greece was hardly a perfect thing, rights were obviously not distributed fairly, and certain controversial thinkers such as Socrates were put to death by a tyrannical majority for speaking their minds. This album is the first attempt at something different, and later ones would become much more focused on both establishing the identity of metal consistently, and help differentiate it from the other genres of it's time.\n\nAt the time this album was recorded, heavy metal was considered what made the beams of buildings, and all in life was peachy in the music scene. People were smoking, tripping, and doing everything that they could to evade the true nature of the world they lived in at the time. Essentially Black Sabbath grew out of the shadow of the hippie scene, which is ironic because in actuality, the 60s movement was a very dark thing. People basically rendered themselves to the state of madness in a paralyzed fear over the fact that they existed in a material world, one with natural laws and consequences for the actions of all within it. Where Black Sabbath differed from the rock bands of the time, is that they didn\u2019t bother trying to hide from the ugliness that had come about, but instead exposed it.\n\nAlthough the more socio-political side of Black Sabbath did not come fully into effect until they\u2019re second release, this one carries some undertones that deserve addressing. The first one is the rather evil, yet simple riff that dominates the first song. It is revealing of how Black Sabbath used the darker side of music to send out a message to the listener, and the unfortunate thing is that people did not interpret the message correctly. Far from being a song glorifying the occult, this song is actually giving a warning to all to avoid the things that it depicts. And what is the devil according to theological accounts? He is a manifestation of corruption, and the 60s were an extremely corrupt time, both philosophically and culturally. Although the lads from Birmingham probably only intended to write a scary homage to a famous Italian horror film, what they ended up accomplishing was dealing a death blow to a poisonous counter-culture, one that was identified by poisoning oneself with mind-altering drugs in order to evade their own metaphysical identity. There is nothing more evil than self-hatred, and this is one aspect of Black Sabbath\u2019s music that is different, it doesn\u2019t evade reality but exposes it, in a metaphorical sense on this particular album.\n\nTo be fair, Black Sabbath did their share of drug glorification, particularly in the case of \u201cSweet Leaf\u201d. But one thing that they never really did, on this release or any other, was propagate the kind of escapism that the 60s counter-culture was famous for. Not escapism in the sense of track 2 on this album, \u201cThe Wizard\u201d, which is essentially a metaphorical tale about an individual with the power to change things around him, but the self-destructive form of escapism where one fully shuts out the world and sees no place for ideals within it. \n\nPeople often focus on the dark side of Sabbath, but truth be told, they were a highly balanced band that looked to the light often as well. They\u2019re influence is universal in the world of metal, as those whom create the dark and more doom oriented side of metal look to slower tracks like the title track, musicians like myself in the power metal genre often look to the light of songs such as \u201cThe Wizard\u201d. What it represents to me is the power of one person to push away darkness from one\u2019s life, and afterwards he finds that his own example has brought light to others. That is the meaning behind the Power Metal genre, in my view, and hints at it\u2019s lyrical inception can be seen in this track.\n\nIt must also be noted that this album functions musically as a manifesto for every Progressive Metal outfit in terms of structure, which is mostly evident in the last track \u201cWarning\u201d, as it twists and turns through a variety of musical sections. If you ever wonder where bands like Fates Warning and Queensryche got their unique approaches to song structure, this song is probably the earliest example of it. Furthermore, songs like \u201cNIB\u201d and \u201cSleeping Village\u201d highlight the technical chops of both Geezer Butler, who was well ahead of his time in terms of the role of the bass, and Tony Iommi\u2019s tendency to use multiple guitar tracks for his solos, something which would be heavily utilized by two guitar outfits such as Helloween, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, and a host of others.\n\nThere are a couple of tracks on here that showcase a rather simple approach to rock music, that might be credited for helping to pave the way for the more mainstream side of metal, particularly the blues influenced sleaze approach of the early through mid 80s glam scene. \u201cEvil woman\u201d and \u201cBehind the Wall of Sleep\u201d function pretty much this way, although the drum alone fade out to the latter is not something commonly encountered in mainstream metal. \n\n\u201cWicked World\u201d, is lyrically my only complaint on this album, because it is too much a product of it\u2019s time and doesn\u2019t have any value today. While musically it is something well ahead of it\u2019s time, particularly the crazy as hell solo that Iommi rips out, something not commonly seen except maybe on one of Jimi Hendrix\u2019s live performances, but the words are afflicted with the same stupid protests over the successes of humanity that the hippie movement waged. I\u2019m sorry, as I know I\u2019m going to piss off a lot of people by saying this, but the line \u201cThey can put a man on the moon quite easy\u201d is classic textbook ignorance. I challenge Ozzy or Geezer to go over and try to mentally comprehend the years of work it took to solve the equations necessary to formulate how to escape the earth\u2019s atmosphere, not to mention sending a human being out there and then bring him back. Furthermore, it is important to note that NASA is often at the forefront of new cures for the diseases that are killing everyone, and also most of the places where disease is rampant are places where you don\u2019t have modern technology. \n\nUnfortunately there is a side to heavy metal that I do despise, and it is how the focus on the negative side of life causes one to speak with emotion divorced from reason. And this approach to lyric writing is alive and well in nearly every genre within the metal universe. In my personal opinion, it\u2019s a holdover from the 60s generation that should be filtered out because it was part of something that metal was supposed to be rebelling against. I can\u2019t fully fault Sabbath for having some influences from their time in their music, as these cultural flights from rational thought were nearly inescapable, but it is necessary to point out flaws as they tend to be present when a new innovation in music occurs, as in all the other fine arts.\n\nOne further thing to note is that Ozzy Osbourne, though regarded as a decent vocalist, did not realize his full vocal potential on this album. \u201cSleeping Village\u201d and \u201cWicked World\u201d in particular see his voice sounding extremely garbled, I had to read the lyrics sheet in order to understand some of the words on the latter track. He does a better job on the tracks where his voice is not nearly as exposed, particularly the title track and \u201cThe Wizard\u201d.\n\nIn conclusion, this is justly dubbed the first album of heavy metal, it is the foundation of a form of music that prides itself on defying boundaries. Those of us whom continue to create music to this day look to this album as the first foundation of the first building, which rests at the center of the great city of metal. Other more towering structures have been built since, but they owe they\u2019re existence to the formula first explored by these guys. If you are not in possession of this album, I recommend getting it now because you will not be able to fully appreciate whatever brand of metal you love without understanding where it comes from. It is a bit dated, it contains some of the negative elements of the time it came from, but it is also the shiniest of diamonds once the rough is cleared away.\n",
        "\nAfter the exit of Ozzy, many fans dismissed Sabbath. Which is ridiculous to count them out that fast, Dio joined and they churned out two good albums with Heaven & Hell, and The Mob Rules. Then came the great and very underrated Born Again with Ian Gillian of Deep Purple fame. Then Sabbath dropped out of site for awhile, to return with this....\n\nWhile not the worst album Sabbath ever did (that honor falls on one of the many bad Tony Martin albums), the title given above pretty much says it. Black Sabbath does Whitesnake is basically how this feels. While it isn't completely horrible album, the music is pretty decent, bluesy type 80's power metal, it's still mediocre and alot of the songs on here sound like filler. Glenn Hughes is a nice medium between Dio and Gillian's vocals, although on \"In For The Kill\" the chorus vocals are pretty funny, and I just can't picture him doing any Ozzy songs live. On the whole, it fits much better as an Iommi solo album, the bare bones are there, but the song writing seems a little rushed, and like not much effort was put into it, but it is a fun listen. It's not the best Sabbath their is, but it's decent, and the last Sabbath album I'd suggest buying, but remember think more along the lines of Whitesnake musically with different vocals. Standout tracks are: In For The Kill, Turn To Stone, Seventh Star, In Memory. The rest are decent though.\n",
        "\nBlack Sabbath\u2019s \u201cGreatest Hits\u201d is one of the many Black Sabbath \u201cbest of\u201d compilation albums released, however this is one of the better ones, but not the best. \n\nOf Course it contains well known hits like \u201cIron Man\u201d, \u201cParanoid\u201d, \u201cNIB\u201d, \u201cWar Pigs\u201d, etc\u2026 which is great if you are a complete stranger to Black Sabbath (where the hell have you been the last 35 years?). Besides the better known songs it contains fan favorites like \u201cHole in the Sky\u201d and \u201cSupernaut\u201d. Also, the songs have been beautifully re-mastered and sound great! Also it is arranged in chronological order, which is a good way to do \u201cbest of\u201d albums.\n\nIt is a decent sampler of Black Sabbath, however, there is a better Black Sabbath \u201cbest of\u201d album, that came out only a few years earlier. \u201cSymptom of the Universe: The Original Black Sabbath (1970-1978)\u201d has nearly twice as many songs on 2 discs, and is overall a better compilation. So it must be asked; Why did they do this \u201cbest of\u201d only a few years later? \n\nDespite being outdone by a better \u201cbest of\u201d, Black Sabbaths \u201cGreatest Hits\u201d is a fine way to introduce the band into those who really aren\u2019t familiar with them. Long time fans, unless you are a completist, should pass over this, though.\n",
        "\nIn heavy metal history there aren't many breakthroughs, not many legendary bands, not many genius deeds. But those who are like this - are true black pearls. Black Sabbath IS a legend, no need to prove it, you know it, or rather simply feel it. 13th February 1970 is the date which started heavy metal. Then some guys from Birmingham started it all by playing music they liked \u2013 a heavier, darker and rawer rock with elements of jazz and blues. Or simply HEAVY METAL. I didn\u2019t take much time to become famous. It was a real blitzkrieg.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to write about something as classical as this album. On one hand you don\u2019t want to desecrate the cult and on the other there is no sense in writing about something which isn\u2019t true. One thing is sure \u2013 it\u2019s THE first heavy metal album \u2013 and this simply makes it classical to the genre.\n\nWhat puts this album above all the other \u201960 and \u201970 rock albums? Well, almost everything. There\u2019s a lot of jazz and blues in it combined with truly powerful riffs. And it\u2019s all filled with heavy, thick atmosphere, especially the title track. It doesn\u2019t mean that most tracks are doom like. There are also more energetic and faster tracks. Most tracks are simply progressive.\n\nTechnical stuff? What can I say? Ozzy\u2019s voice is known world wide. Guitars? Iommi did brilliantly, he has made metal riffs sound like they do now, just listen to \u2018The Wizard\u2019, smashing. Bass plays a great role (unlike most modern metal albums). It isn\u2019t only background. It\u2019s an integral part of the album. Billy Ward did especially well. He mastered drums perfectly; lots of energy and his compositions are very interesting and complicated.\n\nTracks are very good. Unfortunately some are too long (The Warning), are too simple (Evil Woman). This album simply isn\u2019t prefect \u2013 that\u2019s without a doubt, but some tracks are amazing. Lot\u2019s of progression, great atmosphere, and interesting details.\n\nTo sum up. Great album, living legend, first star on the heavy metal sky. Who cares that it isn\u2019t the brightest.\n",
        "\nThe Black Box covers the most well known era of Black Sabbath, 1970 to 1978, the Ozzy Osbourne years. It comes in a beautiful box, with Digipak-style CD holders, each album having its own respective case, along with two smaller containers, four albums to a container. The book has a really nice suede-like cover, and the information inside is nothing new, but interesting none the less. And last but not least is the DVD, which is a nice bonus but wouldn\u2019t be missed if it were to be included.\n\nI will Review each part (the albums, book, and DVD) in more depth.\n\nThe Albums \u2013 I won\u2019t bore you with \u201cOMG PARANOID IS AN AMAZING ALBUM!!\u201d If you want to get a review of each individual album go check out their own release review section. That said, the sound on these cds is amazing! One of the best re-mastering jobs I have ever heard. The riffs sound more menacing with an added crunch, the vocals soar higher than ever, the bass sound deeper and darker than ever before, and the drums are like thunder! The cds are clearly aimed to evoke emotions of the original vinyl\u2019s with the \u2018side 1/side 2\u2019 track listing style, also the Digipak style cases feel like vinyl holders too. \n\nThe Book \u2013 The book is a really nice add-on, if you are looking for just the music this wont interest you. Most of the information is nothing at all new. One of my favorite parts were they have quotes from the likes of Kirk Hammett and Rob Halford, talking about how Sabbath influenced them. Also included are the lyrics to each track along with some album notes for each one.\n\nThe DVD \u2013 The DVD could have been better (i.e. including more performances, maybe some early interviews). The performances most people have probably seen before and the cover of \u201cBlue Suede Shoes\u201d (which is will have you laughing). If they had added more material to the DVD it would be much better and less of a \u201cnice little bonus\u201d.\n\nOverall this is the way to go if you want to get into Black Sabbath. Even if you have 1 or 2 of their albums get this. The DVD and book just make this so nice and the route to go for any fan.\n",
        "\nThis is the second release that the Ronnie Dio era of Sabbath put out and once again the magic is alive and true. Not much has changed since the previous line-up, other than the replacement of Bill Ward with Vinnie Appice. Unfortunately Mr. Ward was nearing a low point in his life and needed some time to re-assess his goals, but fortunately his replacement fills his shoes nicely and adds a more thunderous tone to the rhythm section of this early metal outift.\n\nAlthough this album is not quite as influencial as it's predecessor, it contains all the same elements that made the first album great. Fast paced cookers like \"Turn up the Night\" and the title track, quasi-blues inspired slower tracks such as \"Voodoo\" and \"Over and Over\", as well as more epic compositions like \"Falling off the Edge of the World\" and \"Sign of the Southern Cross\". There is not a dull moment on this album, everything is made to order for anyone who loves traditional metal.\n\nIommi's lead work has been ratcheted up even further, at times sounding almost as virtuoso-like as stuff put out by Van Halen. The rabid fire wah pedal fill-ins on \"Turn up the Night\", the fast paced riffs on \"Voodoo\", the storytelling on \"Over and Over\" and \"Sign of the Southern Cross\" are all treats that have been taken a step further than their predecessors on Heaven and Hell. But my pic for best solo of the album is the one found in the title track, hands down. This song also gets my pic for best main guitar riff and most intense vocal performance by Ronnie Dio on this release.\n\nTwo rather unique tracks on this album that give this release a more interesting flavor are that of \"Country Girl\" and \"Slipping Away\" The former is a very catchy rock song reminding me somewhat of the thematic elements that made \"Iron Man\" an instant classic, but with some rather unusual lyrics dealing with the dangers off falling in love with country girls. The latter is more of a classic rock tune with a production that makes it almost sound like it's on a completely different album, but with some great guitar and drum work.\n\nRonnie Dio's lyrics are pretty much in line with the same magic that he brought to Rainbow and the previous Sabbath release. However, he completely outdid himself when he wrote the words to \"Sign of the Southern Cross\". What you have here essentially is some masterful storytelling, super-imposed over a beautiful acoustic guitar intro and several minutes of a uniquely textured and driving metal groove.\n\nIn conclusion, you can't go wrong with this album. All of the same characteristics that made Heaven and Hell a success are alive and well on this release. It is unfortunate that Bill Ward did not see fit to stick with his mates for one more release, but the fact that he did probably helped to spawn Dio's brilliant partnership with drummer Vinnie Appice after he exited Sabbath in the early 80s.\n",
        "\nAfter about 4 years of meandering about musically, odd experimentation resulting in dead ends, and a rather lackluster pair of albums in \"Technical Ecstacy\" and \"Never Say Die\", Sabbath emerged with a new singer and the recaptured spirit that originally made them great. The new singer, Ronnie Dio (who has since become a household name with his own solo band) delivers the performance of his life on this fine gem.\n\nMany of today's Traditional, Power and Progressive Metal acts site \"Heaven and Hell\" as a pivotal influence in their work. Axel Rudi Pell is probably the most blatant of this albums enthusiasts, as underscored by his equally long hommage \"Disciples of Hell\" off of his 2004 album Kings and Queens. Furthere back in the mix, Iron Maiden's 1988 album \"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\" also can not escape sounding similar to this album on many tracks. In addition, Queensryche's 1984 release \"Warning\" has several similar elements, particularly on the closing track \"Road to Madness\". Other more recent Power Metal bands sounding similar to this release at times include Gamma Ray, Iron Savior, Gaia Epicus, and Iron Fire. Meanwhile, Progressive and Symphonic acts such as Symphony X and Rhapsody take more influence from the lyrics. \n\nThe sheer amount of variety in the songs is reminiscent of Dio's work with Rainbow before he signed on with Sabbath, in addition to some spooky lyrics that fit well with the original theme of the band. Such fantasy driven songs as \"Neon Knights\", \"Wishing Well\", and the poetic \"Heaven and Hell represent the new injection of Rainbow's rather progressive rock/metal. Meanwhile, slower tunes such as \"Lady Evil\", \"Lonely is the Word\", and \"Walk Away\" are a bit more bluesy and reminiscent of classic Ozzy era Sabbath (though with very different vocals).\n\nThe production of this album, especially considering the year, is quite stellar. The guitars in particular have the right amount of crunch to them to stand out from the more traditional rock acts of the time such as AC/DC and Deep Purple. The bass is highly present and always active, something that has always been the exception and not the rule with older metal acts such as Judas Priest and Riot. The drums are probably the least raunchy sounding of the bunch, though Bill Ward does make a decent racket on \"Heaven and Hell\" and \"Children of the Sea\". But the true strength of this album are the vocal tracks, which are perfectly clean, and blend together perfectly during the harmony sections.\n\nTony Iommi's soloing on this album is nothing short of amazing. He delivers a killer thrill ride with the solo to \"Die Young\". His long-winded improvisation on \"Lonely is the Word\" rivals the insanity heard on such extended Jam sessions as Free Bird and some of Jimi Hendrix's live material. There are strong elements of story telling found in his solo work on \"Children of the Sea\", \"Heaven and Hell\", and \"Wishing Well\". And the leads he provides on \"Lady Evil\" take me back to the glory days of such tracks as \"Fairies Wear Boots\".\n\nIn conclusion, there are no weak links on this album, there are no avenues that are left unexplored. This album functions not only as an early pioneer effort that injected more power into the NWOBHM, but as a manifesto by which today's current Metal faithful continue to wage their war for the greatness of the genre. I can't recommend this album more strongly, if you haven't heard it, get yourself to your local CD store or onto Amazon.com and get yourself a copy quick.\n",
        "\nA decade of stumbling and flailing ended on a high, demonic note with \u2018Headless Cross,\u2019 the finest album from Black Sabbath after a string of mediocrity following Ronnie James Dio\u2019s departure. As guitarist Tony Iommi is the only original member left, this album can\u2019t be expected to live up to the band\u2019s classic period in the early seventies. Nevertheless, the style repeated across these songs represents an excellent fusion of the band\u2019s tried-and-tested strengths with a more contemporary and very eighties edge, resulting in one of the most accessible doom metal albums ever recorded.\n\nThe Black Sabbath line-up was in constant flux over that decade. Original vocaliat Ozzy Osbourne had been kicked out, and replacement Dio departed after a couple of good albums. Deep Purple\u2019s Ian Gillan was involved at one particularly unremarkable point, while old-timers Geezer Butler and Bill Ward left Iommi to struggle alone. At least no one was spontaneously combusting. Tony Martin handles vocals for the second album in a row here, his Dio-esque voice sounding at its very best, aided by over-dubbing effects to make for a really powerful screech. Well-known session drummer Cozy Powell makes less of an impression with his anthemic plodding, but Geoff Nicholls adds an extra quasi-epic dimension to the music with his period synthesisers. Add the unknown Laurence Cottle and you get something that doesn\u2019t really resemble a classic line-up, but could certainly come up with something unique.\n\nThe flaws with \u2018Headless Cross\u2019 lie in its incredibly dated, period-specific sound, although for many this would be a considerable improvement over the increasingly obscure metal the band had previously been playing. The all-English band adopts something of the American hard rock sound, ironically stemming from fellow transatlantic Brummies Judas Priest a decade earlier\u2026 although to less commercial success here. The sludgy guitars are distinctly Iommi (apart from a guest solo by Queen\u2019s Brian May), but the drums in particular and the keyboard varnish overlaid serve to distance this release from classics like \u2018Paranoid\u2019 and \u2018Master of Reality,\u2019 as Black Sabbath look back over the decade and strive to forge the most generic 1980s metal anthems possible. With lyrics about bats and stuff.\n\n\n1. The Gates of Hell\n2. Headless Cross\n3. Devil and Daughter\n4. When Death Calls\n5. Kill in the Spirit World\n6. Call of the Wild\n7. Black Moon\n8. Nightwing\n\nAlmost asking for trouble, Sabbath\u2019s subject matter has never been so deeply entrenched in the occult. Sadly for enthusiastic record burners, the lyrics are all in the uncommitted and objective, \u2018human-speaker-scared-by-demons\u2019 vein of the band\u2019s own \u2018Black Sabbath\u2019 and Iron Maiden\u2019s \u2018Number of the Beast.\u2019 Opener \u2018The Gates of Hell\u2019 is a nice, short interlude to the title track, featuring plenty of distorted guitar and vocal samples amidst a general hum of horror show sound effects. This would remain the band\u2019s live opener for the next few years, as the exciting guitar build-up at the end could conceivably lead anywhere. Here, it opts to give way to a slow and generic drum-beat intro introducing Iommi\u2019s lead guitar riff for \u2018Headless Cross.\u2019 Flooded by synth and featuring an incessantly catchy chorus, it\u2019s no surprise this was selected as a single, despite the slight interchangeability of most of these songs. The production is clear enough to distinguish all the instruments, even the neglected bass in the ambient sections, and despite the long running length, the refrain of Martin\u2019s gruff chorus is nicely done. This is one of the band\u2019s finest songs outside the Osbourne and Dio eras.\n\n\u2018Devil and Daughter\u2019 opts to use the Satanism metaphorically, allegedly a stab at the band\u2019s former producer and his daughter, Sharon Osbourne. The album\u2019s second single release, this is in precisely the same style as its predecessor, but with an increased focus on the guitar. The solo is a tad boring and the drums really go nowhere, but the chorus is cool, and there\u2019s nice use of backing \u2018woahs\u2019 as Martin improvises in the studio. The album thankfully changes direction somewhat with the more sinister \u2018When Death Calls,\u2019 not so much a power ballad as a slow song that\u2019s played very loudly. As expected, the song is dominated by faux-acoustic guitar and the drums are used sparingly, apart from the distorted chorus sections. This track kicks into a faster rhythm half-way through in the classic Sabbath tradition, with some excellent instrumental sections. May\u2019s solo is in there somewhere, but it\u2019s not the best on the album.\n\nPerhaps the most technically interesting track, \u2018Kill in the Spirit World\u2019 moves from the most pop-oriented sound so far to a dingy, chilled-out instrumental section in the middle before returning to the commercial thing for the conclusion. The guitars are at their best here, and although the song\u2019s very uneven, it\u2019s one of my favourites. \u2018Call of the Wild\u2019 has a nice chorus, but that\u2019s not enough to save it from mediocrity; at track six, the album begins to sound really samey. The riff is unfascinating, and the loud bass acts as little more than a metronome. \u2018Black Moon\u2019 opens with an interesting and very doom-laden riff, comparable to some of Iommi\u2019s best work. It\u2019s pretty clear that the guy can come up with them on demand, and he grants himself a few fast solos in this otherwise average song.\n\nThe album ends on a high note (well, not literally), with the mostly-acoustic \u2018Nightwing.\u2019 Iommi really shines on acoustic guitar, especially in the acoustic solo half-way through, and there\u2019s even some acoustic bass to back it up. Martin\u2019s bellowing vocals don\u2019t vary a great deal from the louder songs \u2013 he certainly doesn\u2019t try to sing. Even the keyboards work well here, enhancing the wicked atmosphere as they did for the title track. Iommi\u2019s electric riffs towards the end sound like a nod back to Sabbath\u2019s early days, and this song is certainly comparable to the softer offerings of the seventies.\n\n\nThis album was well-received by fans and critics, despite its position outside the Osbourne and Dio periods, perhaps because Tony Martin\u2019s wails are a passable impersonation of the latter, with an added hint of Michael Jackson-style \u2018breathiness.\u2019 The band snuck their inherently eighties album in right at the end of the decade, before the bland nineties rolled around and the polished synthesisers became conspicuous. The title track and \u2018Nightwing\u2019 are both excellent songs, it\u2019s just a shame that the majority of the album sounds like a second-rate attempt at reproducing them, although some songs are acceptable imitations simply due to the great choruses. This album has potential appeal to both long-time fans and hard rocking Sabbath virgins alike.\n\nDespite possessing the ingredients for a \u2018sell-out\u2019 album, \u2018Headless Cross\u2019 is Black Sabbath to the core, even down to the title track\u2019s focus on a plague in Headley\u2019s Cross, Birmingham. The keyboards and tedious drums might seem a little unnatural in Sabbath\u2019s sludgy music, especially in light of earlier disasters involving both, but Iommi and his newest friends finally got it right, for one time only, in 1989. And never again.\n",
        "\nAfter recording heavy metal\u2019s definitive unholy trinity, Black Sabbath under the helm of guitarist Tony Iommi entered an experimental era that would soon see the band\u2019s popularity and credibility plummet over the course of the decade. The un-cryptically titled \u2018Vol. 4,\u2019 the band\u2019s self-explanatory fourth album, represents a thoroughly impressive and inspired cliff edge from which the band would later throw themselves like a kindle of coked-up Brummie lemmings.\n\nOriginally to be titled \u2018Snowblind\u2019 after the album\u2019s happy cocaine anthem, but soon changed for pretty obvious reasons, \u2018Vol. 4\u2019 is one of Sabbath\u2019s very best albums, paling only in comparison to its immediate predecessor, the gritty \u2018Master of Reality.\u2019 Rather than replicate their established and massively influential sound, Sabbath instead focused on a more hard rock direction incorporating progressive elements, and for the most part it\u2019s a success. The band continued to pioneer heavy metal as an original genre, and this lack of established guidelines granted them enormous freedom to experiment: as such, \u2018Vol. 4\u2019 is more varied and adventurous than most metal albums that would follow, it\u2019s nearly all excellent, and often pleasantly poetic.\n\n\u2018Vol. 4\u2019 is primarily let down by a generally thin production sound, and a lack of imagination as the album draws to a close. Whether the latter was due primarily to fatigue brought about by rapid album releases, disagreements between band members or the increasingly worrying amount of drugs the band was taking, I can\u2019t be sure. Nevertheless, when this album is good, it really rocks. The unimpressive production is especially disappointing after the spectacular sludge of the \u2018Master of Reality\u2019 album, and gives the guitars and drums a more traditional hard rock sound akin to Led Zeppelin. The predecessor\u2019s tightly edited thirty-five-minute playing time is also lost this time around, as the blues influence returns somewhat and causes most songs to over-run with unnecessary jams.\n\nThe lyrics predominantly display fear of an approaching insanity, similar to but less eloquent than Roger Waters\u2019 preoccupation in Pink Floyd, and at a stretch this could be considered an unintentional concept album. \u2018Wheels of Confusion\u2019 and \u2018Tomorrow\u2019s Dream\u2019 both describe a blur between fantasy and reality, while \u2018Changes\u2019 is a more simplistic cry for help after bereavement, perhaps indicating the need to escape, and this is picked up on in \u2018Cornucopia\u2019 and \u2018St. Vitus\u2019 Dance.\u2019 \u2018Under the Sun / Every Day Comes & Goes\u2019 offers the final solution, advocating the escape from \u201ctheir world of make-believe,\u201d and only in the controversial \u2018Snowblind\u2019 are the speaker\u2019s eyes opened thanks to the power of drugs. It may not have been intentional but it works pretty well, and likely provides an insight into the band\u2019s collective psyche at this early and successful point in their career. Life is one big overdose.\n\n\n1. Wheels of Confusion / The Straightener\n2. Tomorrow\u2019s Dream\n3. Changes\n4. FX\n5. Supernaut\n6. Snowblind\n7. Cornucopia\n8. Laguna Sunrise\n9. St. Vitus\u2019 Dance\n10. Under the Sun / Every Day Comes & Goes\n\nLonger Black Sabbath songs have been divided into \u2018movements\u2019 right from the debut album, but this is taken a step further when bluesy, hard rocking opener \u2018Wheels of Confusion\u2019 morphs seamlessly into a piano-led guitar jam from Iommi. The first note is abruptly loud and clear, but sadly acts as a perfect demonstration of the weak production sound. Ozzy sings Geezer Butler\u2019s customarily pointless fantasy lyrics in a noticeably more irritating whine than the lower pitch of the previous albums, but his trademark cringe-inducing singing style wouldn\u2019t properly develop until the next record. Taking this into account, the second (instrumental) half of this song is far more impressive, as Iommi\u2019s seemingly relentless solo plays perfectly over the simplistic repeated bars of the piano. Depending on my mood, this song could be much, much, much longer.\n\n\u2018Tomorrow\u2019s Dream\u2019 is the most commercially viable song on the album, and was rightly selected as the single. Taking cues from the earlier \u2018After Forever\u2019 and predicting all the big numbers on the next few Sabbath albums, this is a relaxed song that veers on ballad territory but is a bit too heavy on distortion to allow it. Ozzy sings inoffensively for a change, and there\u2019s a nice jazz-influenced break towards the end of the song allowing Iommi to show off some groovy guitar and keyboard tricks, in something of a failed attempt to emulate psychedelia in metal. The next song takes the balladic leap, and it\u2019s not a pretty sight.\n\nI\u2019ve heard that Ozzy and his daughter re-recorded \u2018Changes\u2019 a couple of years ago and it somehow got to number one. I haven\u2019t heard it, but I\u2019m very sure it\u2019s godawful. Sabbath\u2019s original is lacking in depth for all the wrong reasons; Ozzy\u2019s echo-enhanced voice is more irritating than it\u2019s ever been before or since, especially when required to fill a vast chasm occupied only by Iommi\u2019s feeble piano ditty that sounds like something a seven-year-old could have come up with. (Then again, much of Basil Poledouris\u2019 soundtrack for \u2018Conan the Barbarian\u2019 was based on melodies his seven-year-old daughter improvised. I\u2019m not sure what point I\u2019m making here, but it\u2019s a funny fact). This is one of my all-time least favourite Black Sabbath songs, including their pitiful output from the eighties and nineties \u2013 and that\u2019s saying something.\n\nConcluding this undemanding sophomore section of the album, \u2018FX\u2019 is nothing but an entirely pointless interlude. The band\u2019s probably trying to sound spacey or surreal, and indeed it might have been pretty cool for the acid-drenched hippies, but two minutes of nothing but random amplifier feedback makes even the most obtuse Tangerine Dream composition sound palatable. I tend to lump it along with \u2018Changes\u2019 as the part of the album that it\u2019s always necessary to skip. Things can only get better, and the off-road swinging \u2018Supernaut\u2019 doesn\u2019t disappoint. Led entirely by a selection of Iommi\u2019s brilliantly simple riffs, a technique we\u2019ve seen does not translate to piano, this is a relatively roundabout and circular four minutes of rolling guitars and sparse vocals with a fantastic steel drum refrain. One of the high points of the album and a genuine Sabbath classic, perhaps because it really doesn\u2019t go anywhere.\n\nThe album takes a more epic turn with \u2018Snowblind,\u2019 the band\u2019s not-so-secret song about cocaine that even features a very loud whisper of \u201ccocaine!\u201d after the first verse. Considering the pressure put on the band to remove most of the more oblique references, this really stands out as an effective mockery of Warner records. Laugh in their hypocritical snow-covered corporate faces. The music is slow and dingy, although not to the extent of past classics like \u2018Lord of this World\u2019 and \u2018Black Sabbath,\u2019 but the tempo and style shift excellently between verses, choruses and instrumental sections. This is the most technically accomplished song on the album and one of the very best, although after the simple fun of \u2018Supernaut\u2019 it may take some time to really grow on the listener. Ozzy\u2019s voice defies expectation by sounding really good in the sing-song verses (akin to \u2018Into the Void\u2019), and Iommi seems to have finally grasped the potential of keyboards in providing effective background ambience.\n\n\u2018Cornucopia\u2019 desperately yearns for the production sound of \u2018Master of Reality\u2019 or \u2018Paranoid,\u2019 and would sound a whole lot more impressive if this had been granted. The trademark sluggish guitars don\u2019t sound anywhere near as powerful in the opening section, and the song doesn\u2019t really pick up until the pace is increased and Iommi adds a couple of solos. Everything about this song sounds like a last-minute re-hash of previous material, but thankfully it doesn\u2019t last too long to become tedious. This is followed by the pleasant but overlong \u2018Laguna Sunrise,\u2019 the only acoustic instrumental on this album following the previous release\u2019s \u2018Orchid\u2019 and \u2018Embryo\u2019 and unfortunately lasts for longer than the combined length of both. At just under three minutes, there shouldn\u2019t be much difference between this repetitive ditty and \u2018The Straightener\u2019 so long before, but this one is a whole lot duller. Iommi plays a single repeated riff on a Spanish-sounding guitar that I\u2019m not technical enough to provide any more information about.\n\nFollowing the instrumental is another below-average-length song, but this time Ozzy contributes some vocals. \u2018St. Vitus\u2019 Dance\u2019 has a bluesy feel to it, and acts as a weaker companion to \u2018Supernaut\u2019 in its focus on repeated riffs. It\u2019s a nice song, especially for its length, but this time the lack of progress acts as a hindrance rather than an advantage as it was earlier. These things work very strangely. The final song is something of a caged beast, again restricted by weak production from being the Sabbath classic it perhaps deserves to be. Ozzy\u2019s vocals over the guitars remind me a lot of several points on \u2018Master of Reality,\u2019 but this song doesn\u2019t work quite as well, sounding repetitive for the most part but saved by some creative guitar by Iommi and a speedy departure into \u2018Every Day Comes & Goes,\u2019 which is effectively a different song in-between two halves of \u2018Under the Sun.\u2019 Butler\u2019s bass can be heard clearly for the first time under Iommi\u2019s solos. The album ends in excellent fashion, with overlapping melodic guitars soloing their way into the fade in a way Iommi would unfortunately never be able to play live, having only two hands. The final crushing note ends as abruptly as the wail that opened the first track forty-four minutes earlier.\n\n\nBlack Sabbath\u2019s first three albums already contained progressive elements, especially in the Medieval-style ballads that remind most strongly of patriotic English prog bands such as King Crimson and Genesis. With \u2018Vol. 4,\u2019 keyboards are introduced and it becomes a lot easier to incorporate established prog traits, most notably the mellotron lurking in the background of \u2018Changes,\u2019 a fond staple of progressive music to this day. Only with \u2018Snowblind\u2019 does the synthetic sound genuinely add to the song, and the piano / guitar outro to \u2018The Straightener\u2019 is a real highlight, if a little self-indulgent at such an early point in the album. The loose and jazzy structures also detract from some of the songs, leaving only \u2018Supernaut\u2019 and \u2018Snowblind,\u2019 and perhaps \u2018Wheels of Confusion / The Straightener\u2019 sounding like true classics, the first of which could quite conceivably be traced as the direct origin of the \u2018groove metal\u2019 scene that dominated much of nineties metal, led by bands like Pantera and Machine Head.\n\nA few too many liberties are taken with unnecessary jams in the weirdest places, and for every cool musical innovation (especially in Bill Ward\u2019s percussion) there follows a blatant rip-off of earlier material. The band would proceed to incorporate synthesisers more strongly in their following albums, especially 1973\u2019s \u2018Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\u2019 which manages to feature both an accomplished cameo by keyboard virtuoso Rick Wakeman and an absolutely abysmal composition by Ozzy Osbourne that\u2019s up there with \u2018Changes.\u2019 Not down here in Hell where all of Black Sabbath\u2019s best songs really belong.\n",
        "\nThere is a fine line that exists between devotion and fetishization, but particularly in the polarizing eras and corresponding personalities that make up one of heavy metal's oldest and longest endured institutions, it is one that all but ceases to exist. The clashing of swords between the Ozzy Osbourne and Ronnie James Dio parties of the Black Sabbath legacy have become the stuff of legends, and occasionally a regiment from the Deep Sabbath days will come along to challenge the other two in the name of Ian Gillian. Relegated to the sidelines of this long enduring debate of which era is the true representation of Sabbath is the latter 80s and early to mid 90s stretch featuring vocalist Tony Martin, a little known quantity when compared against even the likes of Glenn Hughes, yet one that nevertheless deserves consideration. The chaotic circumstances following the semi-solo project turned accidental Sabbath album Seventh Star (owing completely to label pressure) was fertile grounds for a sharp stylistic left-turn and an unknown voice leading the sonic charge, which is probably the best way to sum up exactly what The Eternal Idol is, a departure in just about every respect, save when compared to its immediate and aforementioned predecessor.\n\nThis is not an epic foray into the proto-power metal fringes of the NWOBHM like the Dio albums, nor does it conform to the doom and gloom with an occasional glimmer that was the Ozzy years, though occasional elements of both rear their heads. This is essentially an iconic 80s heavy metal album that somehow manages to sidestep all of the negative stereotypes associated with the concurrent AOR-tinged exploits of Saxon, Twisted Sister and Tygers Of Pan Tang while still exhibiting most of the same production quirks; namely a massive and heavily reverb-laden drum and vocal mix accompanied by a slick guitar tone. Truth be told, apart from Tony Iommi's choppy and meandering guitar solos and an occasional throwback riff here and there, it is a bit difficult to really identify this as the Sabbath sound if going by the precedents set prior to 1983. Though clearly possessed of a Dio-like mixture of soaring majesty and grit, Tony Martin's vocals lean a bit more on that sleazy 80s swagger that was all the rage on MTV in the mid-80s, a direct product of his vocal lines being made to mimic melodic lines and inflections first committed to recording by Ray Gillen. The only thing on here that really deviates from the mainline heavy metal format of the day is Bob Daisley's bass work, which is far fancier and involved than most and reminisces on how Geezer Butler gave the instrument far more time in the sun.\n\nAs with any successful stylistic pivot, be it extreme or slight, things are instigated on a pleasantly familiar note with the mid-paced groove and ultra-catchy anthem that is \"The Shining\". Per Iommi's own testimony, much of this song had been floating around in his unfinished repertoire since the Born Again days, and it definitely functions as a sort of stylistic bridge back to the mid-paced sway of the Dio era with a denser atmospheric backdrop befitting a lost track from the 1983 collaboration with Ian Gillian. The blend of acoustic and distorted guitars over top a thick keyboard line out of longtime unofficial 5th member Geoff Nicholls is a masterful one, setting an atmospheric tone of splendor and mysticism that predicts the ongoing obsession with ghostly tales afflicting Axel Rudi Pell. This blend of atmospheric wonder, iconic riff work and driving melody is displayed in a similar fashion on the ode to war and tragedy \"Glory Ride\" and the haunting rocker \"Nightmare\", all of which reminisce greatly upon the 1980-83 era of Sabbath while still sounding mostly removed from the grittier character of the early 80s. On the opposite side of the coin is the pure 80s rocking swagger of up beat numbers like \"Lost Forever\", \"Born To Lose\" and \"Hard Life To Love\", all of which play a bit better to Iommi's blues box soloing style and showcase a more happy-go-lucky side of the band despite the lyrics avoiding the cliches of sappy love and mindless partying.\n\nIn a sense, this album has a bizarre side to it that comes into greater focus when dealing with the rest of its material, which reveals an album that has one foot planted in early 80s metal and another in later 80s rock and a mutant third member that reaches into a darker and less expected place. Though not really an all out doom metal affair, \"Ancient Warrior\" has a sort of slow paced, Middle Eastern mystique to it that is a bit more befitting of the darker character of this album's successor The Headless Cross, not to mention one of the most memorable principle riffs to come out of Iommi's arsenal since he parted ways with Dio. The charming instrumental offering \"Scarlet Pimpernel\" isn't really a dark affair, but it does take one back to the days of Sabbath Bloody Sabbath where the acoustic guitar work went beyond a stylistic device and became an orchestral force in itself, here adorned with a dense, almost theatrical keyboard backdrop to seal the deal. The coup de grace of musical surprises, however, belongs to the closer number and title song \"The Eternal Idol\", which can be best described as an accidental throwback to the darkest fringes of Sabbath's early years with Ozzy, but translated into something far closer to the epic doom metal fatalism of Candlemass. The foil of Tony Martin's high soaring vocals with the bleak, oblivion-drenched atmosphere like something out of the second Hellraiser film is beyond brilliant, resulting in a song that is arguably among the most original things to ever emerge from Iommi's mausoleum of horrors.\n\nThe charge that this album is simply a jumbled mess held together by Iommi's guitar work and a generally consistent production job out of the studio engineers is a flat out ridiculous one, though maybe understandable if one is religiously locked into the orthodoxy of the Ozzy/Dio paradigm of Black Sabbath. To be fair, this is an album that could be more easily regarded as an Iommi solo album in much the same respect as Seventh Star, though The Eternal Idol is far closer to the dark and forbidding spirit of the Sabbath name and even the earlier eras of this outfit were not a uniform stylistic affair but an ongoing chemistry set of sounds that just so happened to land in consistent territory because of the lineup being such. If nothing else, this album and every other masterpiece bearing the Sabbath name is a testament to Tony Iommi's genius as a songwriter, one that surpasses the commendable yet not terribly prolific efforts of Geezer Butler, and also one that avoided the almost comical campiness that dogged much of Ozzy's solo career following the death of Randy Rhodes. It goes without saying that the formative metallic exploits of Sabbath with Ozzy and Dio at the helm are to be venerated for what they have accomplished, but idolatry and the irrational devotion that it commands tends to rob the individual of experience, and this album, nay the entire Tony Martin era of Sabbath will go down in history as one of the most unjust victims of it.\n\nRewritten on February 20th, 2018.\n",
        "\nThis is pretty much a lost chapter in the Black Sabbath back catalog, mostly because it doesn't really qualify as the Black Sabbath that people came to know with Ozzy. After coming off the heavily rainbow inspired music from his collaboration with Ronnie James Dio, and an attempt at returning to the scary sounds of old with Born Again, Tony Iommi was pretty much left on his own, to find his own sound.\n\nThis album was meant to be a solo project, and as such any whom buy this album should disassociate the Sabbath sound with this album. Once this is done, we are actually left with a rather amazing quasi-blues, quasi-80s metal glory fest. Many knock Tony Iommi's playing as being too blues driven, and in the case of the post Ozzy material, to anti-melodic. I beg to differ with the view that this is a negative for two reasons. (1) Tony Iommi was shredding the pentatonic scale back when Kirk Hammet was still in kindergarten, hense Tony is doing what he is entitled to do and (2) soloing is not all about being able to sing along with what you hear, that's why it's called a GUITAR SOLO!!!\n\nProduction on this album is worlds away from any previous Black Sabbath release. The guitars are crisp and clean, a real departure from the dark and murky sound that Tony is more famous for. There are many prominent keyboard parts, which was an occasional anomally on Technical Ecstacy and Heaven and Hell, but was never a dominant part of an entire album. The drums are very heavily reverbed and thunderous, which is not something that Bill Ward was known for. The vocal harmonies are also noteworthy, as this is the first album where there is really a large amount of vocal overdubbing going on (The single version of \"No Stranger to Love\" is loaded with voice tracks)\n\nThe individual tracks are a bit varied, you have a bunch of really good stand out tracks, and a couple that are mediocre. \"In for the Kill\" is a nice up tempo rocker with a rather attention getting drum intro, and a powerful chorus. \"No Stranger to Love\" is probably the only true Power Love Ballad of the 80s variety ever associated with the Sabbath name, and probably enjoyed some regular airplay on some easier listening stations back in 1986. \"Turn to Stone\" has a very intricant drum intro, and is probably the fastest song ever written by Iommi, very nice solo here as well. \n\n\"The Guardian\" is a rather haunting brief synth instrumental that functions as a prelude for the next track. \"Seventh Star\" is a rather impressive mini-epic with a very catchy main riff, a memorable solo, and the most inspired lyrics on the album. \"Danger Zone\" has some decent guitar work, and a rather weird intro that reminds me of older Sabbath work. \n\n\"Heart like a Wheel\" is an attempt to recapture the spirit of Lonely is the Word with simplistic blues riffing and highly improvised soloing, only here it doesn't work as well and gets boring after the first 3 minutes. \"Angry Heart\" sounds a bit too much like earlier tracks at times, particularly Danger Zone, and doesn't quite push beyond the mediocre category. \"In Memory\" is a slight step up with an acoustic change of pace, and has a rather nuerotic vocal performance on the part of Glenn Hughes, but is way too short.\n\nIn conclusion, you may want to skip tracks 7 and 8, but otherwise there is some good stuff on here, especially if your not boxed into the \"If it's not with Ozzy, it's not Sabbath\" crowd. Even though this album doesn't really blend in with any of the other Sabbath eras, it proves that there was one person that gave Sabbath it's truly unique sound, and it wasn't Ozzy, it was Tony Iommi.\n",
        "\nBlack Box (The Complete Original Black Sabbath 1970-1978) is a box set, containing the 8 CD's sabbath put out in the 70's (Black Sabbath, Paranoid, Master of Reality, Vol. 4, Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, Sabotage, Technical Ecstacy, Never Say Die!), as well as a book and a DVD. \n\nI'll break the review into 3 pieces, and weigh them accordingly. \n\nPart 1: The CD's. \n\nI'm not going to rate the music on the CD's, since they already have their own sections full of reviews on the songs themselves. So what makes these particular CD's better than any other release? SOUND QUALITY! There are no beeps, blank spots or anything of the sort on here (things that have plagued all the previous editions of these albums), they are perfect. The original source tapes were digitally remastered under supervision from the band, and it certainly paid off. Ozzy's vocals soar to new heights on \"Hole In The Sky\", Tony's monster of a riff on \"Children Of The Grave\" has never sounded heavier, Geezer's bass thunders on \"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\" better than ever, and Bill's drumming on \"Symptom Of The Universe\" is so fierce, it scares me. The packaging on the CD's is also very well done. They're the original covers (so they say \"side 1, side 2\" on track listing, which is kinda weird for a CD). They also kept the individual fonts for each album, a nice little touch. On a more amusing note, I seemed to have aquired a copy of Sabbath \"Bloddy\" Sabbath instead of Sabbath Bloody Sabbath. \n\nThe CD's get full marks, so 8 CD's @ 10/10 each is 80. \n\nPart 2: The Book. \n\nThe Book contains two essays tracking Sabbath's first decade of existencer. The first is called \"Lords Of This World\" and details Sabbath 1970-1973. The second is called \"A Hard Road\", and follows up with 1974-1978. Not to many new things to be learned, but it deserves a read nonetheless. The next part is a time line, which is insteresting, but I don't like the layout, they should have had it in point form instead of paragraph form. Last comes the complete lyrics for all 8 albums. Scattered throught are pictures of the band, and quotes from various artists (Rob Halford, Kirk Hammet, Vince Neil among them) extolling the greatness of the mighty Black Sabbath. Overall, the book is pretty decent, though it would have been nice to have more pics of Geezer and Bill, Ozzy and Tony completely steal the show. I also didn't like how they basically gloss over nearly two decades of Sabbath history (1980-1997) in the timeline. I understand this is supposed to be about \"the original lineup\", but why they do they mention Ozzy's, Geezer's and Bill's solo works, but not what Tony was doing at the time ( i.e. keeping Sabbath alive). \n\nStill, the book is pretty good, so I give it 7/10. \n\nPart 3: The DVD \n\nGiven the comprehensiveness of everything else, the CD was quite a let down. It contains 3 music videos (for Black Sabbath, Iron Man and Paranoid), and a live cover of Elvis Presley's \"Blue Suede Shoes\" (which is actually quite amusing). You've probably seen the music videos before, they're the ones with the band playing and all this other crap pasted onto the background. \n\nIt seems as if the band didn't really give a shit about the DVD. It would have been nice to have a concert on it (say, the Paris 1970 bootleg, or that show from 1978's Never Say Die tour). Also, interviews with the band members, some mini-documentary on the band and their influence, or something else, would have been good to have on here. \n\nThe DVD gets 3/10, and 2 of those points are there simply because I laughed my ass off at Blue Suede Shoes. \n\n\nThis gives an overall total of 80 + 7 + 3 = 90. \n\nIf you dont own any Ozzy era Sabbath (or even if you own 1 or 2 CD's), this is the edition you want to buy, it is superior to every other release of these albums. \n\nI've also heard Tony is working with Dio on a Dio-era box set, here's hoping it will come along soon!!\n",
        "\nThis is it, my friends, the pinnacle of the Sabbath food triangle. Simply one of the heaviest records of its particular decade (or ever, really), and a wellspring of inspiration to crafters of malevolent music decades hence, Sabotage is the black goat of the Black Sabbath family of music. The vibe, the sound, the oppression of this slab\u2019s sound is Sabbath at their most obscure and isolated. No thought is given to writing pleasing music, so what remains is the sinister soul of the band\u2019s core itself. Breathe deep and say goodbye to your loved ones before entering the cavern of Sabotage\u2026you might be gone for some time\u2026\n\nBlasting off with the swaggering lope of \u201cHole In The Sky,\u201d we\u2019re in easy view of the band\u2019s chemistry and foul odors here. Ozzy\u2019s voice is detached, the lyrics totally away from any semblance of reality, perhaps only meaningful or indeed profound in the now clandestine collective Sabbath subconscious. A creepy acoustic refrain (\u201cDon\u2019t Start Too Late\u201d) follows before IT. The riff of all riffs, the song of all songs; the Rosemary\u2019s baby of the band\u2019s canon. \u201cSymptom Of The Universe\u201d simply has it all. The heaviest riff ever (no kidding kids, do not attempt writing anything this heavy without adult supervision) some of the most sublimely forlorn lyrics the band ever penned (\u201cCome with me my child of love come step inside my tears, swim the magic ocean I\u2019ve been crying all these years\u201d) with bonus images from the Biblical book of Revelations itself, mind you. And if that wasn\u2019t enough, the acoustic segue that closes the song, complete with impassioned and impressive vocals from the Oz, is perfect as well. Just friggin\u2019 unbelievable. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever get tired of hearing this song, and neither should you. \n\n\u201cMegalomania\u201d is up to bat next, perhaps the most harrowing cut ever from the band (damn close to \u201cBlack Sabbath\u201d itself actually). It\u2019s actually very scary in a very real sense, the lyrical rant of an addict begging to be permitted to drown in his own world of self-obsessed and perpetuated misery. And that second riff! Meaner vibes are dam hard to find here in this mortal world. \n\nSide two can\u2019t compare in any serious fashion, but it does do it\u2019s best. The totally unexpected Satanic ritual background instrumental \u201cSupertzar\u201d is as unexpected as could be, but an enjoyable piece of music all the same, exactly the kind of tune you\u2019d hear playing in the background of the great old British Hammer horror films. \u201cThe Writ\u201d is a long and progressive discussion of the band\u2019s legal troubles, but just doesn\u2019t congeal as well as other similarly expansive Sabbath speeches. \n\nNo worries, though, as the balance of this album is simply untouchable. Black Sabbath would never again make an album this masterful, though they would keep trying for 30+ years to come. If that doesn\u2019t illustrate that Sabotage is a nearly impossible act to follow I don\u2019t know what does. Simply put, my attentive acolytes: if you don\u2019t understand this album\u2019s greatness, you are on the wrong website. Class friggin\u2019 dismissed.\n",
        "\nSabbath Bloody Sabbath was the work of band on a mission to prove itself an act far above the press and media derision that had been liberally cast their way throughout their profitable but notorious past. It features keyboards, tricky arrangements, but above all a nearly perfect balance of progression and weight. Simply put, as evolution-minded as the work here is, it\u2019s also loath to leave the punters behind (of which I am assuredly one of). \n\n\nOpening with the iconic riff of the title song (one of Tony Iommi\u2019s best ever) the track soon takes on a diabolical feel worthy of the band\u2019s most spectral music. \u201cFluff\u201d is just that, a frilly piece of instrumental whatever that\u2019s quickly forgotten. \u201cSabra Cadabra,\u201d however, is a self-conscious riff-mungous monster, and a somewhat forgotten gem in this band\u2019s sea of lost jewels (which gives me pause to observe: it\u2019s odd that a band as popular as Sabbath would boast such a sense of fan ambivalence about the depths of their own catalog). But it\u2019s the latter half of the album that lends itself to the sense of advancement discussed above. True, \u201cKilling Yourself To Live\u201d is another plain old kick-ass Sabbath creation, constructed with perhaps a bit more care for craft than elder work, but still pleasingly brute all the same. It\u2019s with Ozzy\u2019s musical (!) effort \u201cWho Are You\u201d that things get enjoyably odd. Leading with a stilted synthesizer riff (!) it grows into one Sabbath\u2019s unlikeliest keepers ever. \n\n\nThe real treat is saved for last though, as \u201cSpiral Architect\u201d is easily one of the band\u2019s best songs ever, despite it being not particularly heavy. It is lyrically and musically amazing, one of Ozzy\u2019s cosmic observations that make real sense, and the writing is second to none, riveting and memorably dynamic. Another cut that has largely sunk to the bottom \u2018o the Sabbath sea, only to be hailed by malcontents like me (hey, I\u2019m a poet!). \n\n\nA fine job on the production end was provided by Iommi himself, and this stands as perhaps the band\u2019s most mature effort, silencing the quibbles of many a jaded critic who were bound and determined to chastise the band\u2019s work (few of whom ever really bothered to listen to it and not just hear it; there is a universe of difference). But at the end of the day it was another hit for the band, the tour commenced, the fans came out in their barbiturate droves and everybody went home happy.\n",
        "\nThis old warhorse of an album suffers from an all too common condition affecting most bands\u2019 best, or perceived to best, or more popular work: over playing. See, most music journalists and radio programmers are notoriously lethargic, and rather than do the work (if it can really be called work) of truly understanding and assessing an artist\u2019s music, all too often a band\u2019s biggest seller becomes their \u201cbest\u201d album simply by virtue of sales. And so we\u2019ve all had certain albums hammered into our brains until we\u2019re sick to death of them, no matter how good they happen to be. The net result is that classics like Dark Side of the Moon, Nevermind, Abbey Road, Kind of Blue, Are You Experienced, and many others (including the ENTIRE Led Zeppelin catalog\u2026 I mean get over it already) are rendered impotent due to over saturation. \n\n\nIn Sabbath\u2019s case the damage was particularly acute. In my youth when classic radio stations played the band at all, it was invariably material from this album, and then only two of its well-worn cuts. (And I was listening in a major market: NYC!) Now Black Sabbath, to date and in their various incarnations, has issued 18 studio albums, 4 live albums, and I\u2019m sure countless radio broadcasts of concert recordings languish in radio station vaults. And all we get is two measly cuts? This, my friends, is why mainstream music broadcasting (audio and visual) SUCKS SO BAD in our world.\n\n\nBut enough media bashing. Truth be told, while Paranoid is not my favorite Sabbath outing, it is a classic, and should have its place among metal\u2019s legendary texts. The slightly tentative tone of their debut behind them, our heroes began to truly forge a sound all their own here. The RIFF is still king, as it was before, but these riffs are better by a good margin. Also better is the chemistry between the players, a fact that opener \u201cWar Pigs\u201d bears out. The rhythms (part swing, part crush) and the interaction between Bill Ward\u2019s drums and Geezer\u2019s bass is truly impressive, as is the instrumental work during the song\u2019s lengthy CODA, in which Tony Iommi really shows his inventive side as a guitarist. Ozzy for his part gives one of his best performances on record, and the song\u2019s anti-war sentiment (as filtered through Sabbath\u2019s old testament moralist stand and imagery) is potent and even timely some 35+ years hence. \n\n\nThe title cut follows and remains the band\u2019s most famous tune and rightly so. It\u2019s a quick, terse and catchy cut that boasts one of the most infectious riffs in history, as well as suitably depressive lyrics delivered in Ozzy\u2019s now embedded style of following the chord changes with his ever unique voice. The acidic wash of \u201cPlanet Caravan\u201d is pleasant enough to be Sabbath\u2019s first visit to psychedelia, and perhaps reveals the band as still having their foot (or at least a toe) dipped into the Sixties rock styles they were in the process of escaping from. \n\n\nAnd then there\u2019s \u201cIron Man\u201d, surely this band\u2019s \u201cSmoke on the Water\u201d and one of the most recognized guitar riffs ever penned. The rub for me is that I really don\u2019t dig the tune, partly due to over-exposure and part because there are at least 25-30 better songs in the band\u2019s canon. For example, at least three of those cuts follow, so let\u2019s move right into the droning, nearly psych dirge \u201cElectric Funeral\u201d. Iommi really gives his cry baby wah pedal a workout here, and Ozzy\u2019s accompanying nasal whine compliments him perfectly. \u201cFairies Wear Boots\u201d is one of the more dynamic early Sabbath tunes, boasting nice soft/loud contrasts, and bizarre lyrics retelling a tale of Ozzy\u2019s less than pleasant encounter with a crew of skinheads. Finally \u201cHand of Doom\u201d is odd lyrically, as it addresses and clearly questions the wisdom of Sabbath's own drug use, matched with some sweet, slow, syrupy riffs. \n\n\nAll told Paranoid is a metal landmark and certainly deserves the props it\u2019s received over the decades since its release. But to arbiters of taste that tyrannically control the airwaves, please listen to at least one of this band\u2019s other 20 or so recordings\u2026 we\u2019ll settle for even light rotation if that\u2019s all your lazy asses can handle.\n",
        "\nOf all the things one can credit the mighty and ever-looming influence of Black Sabbath for, an inescapable fact should also be hammered into the texts of HM history. Upon their inception, the band didn\u2019t have squat. Their singer, Ozzy Osbourne, was from a desperately poor Birmingham, England family. Their guitarist, Tony Iommi, had learned to play despite accidentally hacking the tops of two of his fingers off in a sheet metal mishap. Their drummer, Bill Ward, soon would evince one of the more harrowing cases of alcoholism in rock history, while bassist Geezer Butler was a reluctant, but enthusiastic occult student who would learn to play his instrument only a short time before the band\u2019s first recording dates. \n\n\nAnd so armed with $600 and a truckload of ambition, Black Sabbath recorded their first LP and subsequently changed the face of rock music. Nothing like having it all on your side, huh? But for their part, Sabbath pushed aside the blues roots that dominated the UK rock scene of the day, and forged a sound built on a somewhat new idea: the riff. Other bands (The Kinks, The Who, and to a lesser degree The Beatles) had played with the concept of a guitar riff being the central building block of a song, but Sabbath put the weight of the entire band behind it, all instruments present firing at full power at a small but imposing collection of chords. And believe it or not, that innovation is the essential component and differentiating factor of heavy metal music, especially the more \u201cextreme\u201d sub-genres.\n\n\nBut enough theory. The album itself is remarkable as presenting a relatively young band with a quite defined sound and very deft interplay between the players. The opening alone can freeze blood in veins, as the sound of rain and a soft, distant church bell chiming set up the mood, just in time for a loud thunderclap to sound and THAT RIFF appears. Only three chords, but the chromatic order of said chords was known during the Middle Ages as \u201cdiablous in musica\u201d. Playing it or writing music containing it could mean you\u2019d find yourself in chains with a hooded dude aiming a branding iron at your privates. But the tune our heroes were using it for was their theme song, \u201cBlack Sabbath\u201d, an ornery tale of demonic possession that can\u2019t help but leave an impression (of whatever type) on any perspective listener. \u201cThe Wizard\u201d is moderately less sinister, but still blasts some wicked (and loud) riffs, and some damn inventive (almost jazz-like) drumming from Mr. Ward. \u201cNIB\u201d steps up after some instrumental noodling \u2013 mostly bass fingering, and fires off another immortal, signature Sabbath riff. A mystery for some time, the song\u2019s title was interpreted by paranoid Bible-humpers to be an acronym for \u201cNativity in Black\u201d, which has nothing to do with the lyrics (more demon possession stuff), and was in fact titled \u201cNIB\u201d after the appearance of Ward\u2019s beard! Only in the wacky world of metal\u2026. Much of the album\u2019s remainder, especially \u201cWarning\u201d, relies on the band\u2019s jazz-blues base, and not for the last time in the band\u2019s music some very swing-type time signatures appear.\n\n\nAll in all, Sabbath may not have invented volume, riffs, and power chords, but they did combine these ingredients into their broth to a level mostly never heard before in rock. This is not their best album, but in heavy metal history it is a Cro-Magnon man taking its primitive tools in hand for the first time for forge the future to whatever end it would lead to. Brave, innovative and loud as a bomb, the Sabbath era had undeniably dawned. On our feet, or on our knees it would flourish amongst us, unstoppable.\n",
        "\nAfter the short lived 1992 Dio reunion which resulted in the excellent album Dehumanizer, Sabbath returns with vocalist Tony Martin like reunion gig never happened after the album TYR. \n\nSabbath also drops the ultra heavy doomy sound from Dehumanizer and returns to more of the tradition sound that was found on the Martin albums of the past. Still Cross Purposes sounds a tad different from those albums as it doesn\u2019t have the full blown keyboard effect. Even though it doesn\u2019t quit sound the same I still feel that this would have been the natural progression of the band even if Dehumanizer never happened. It was the early 90\u2019s and Sabbath modernized their sound nicely for that era with Cross Purposes\n\nIt seems a lot of people were upset when Dio left the group again and that Tony Martin came back. I in fact was very happy as I find Tony Martin to be one of the finest vocalists to grace the genre of metal so I accepted Cross Purposes with open arms.\n\nThe album opens with I Witness, a more up beat track and a perfect way to open the album. The second song Cross of Thorns is a slower track with fantastic emotional lyrics. I\u2019ve always found Tony Martin to write great lyrics and his voice just brings them to life. This track is perhaps the best on the album. The album picks up the beat again with Psychophobia with a monstrous riff by Iommi. What\u2019s interesting is Martin sounds almost like Dio sometimes on this song. Virtual Death is a much slower doomier song with an odd distortion on Martin\u2019s vocals. I wasn\u2019t too hot on this track and its usually a skipper. Immaculate Deception is a decent heavier track right before the nice Sabbath ballad Dying for Love. I\u2019m not sure what it is but with Iommi\u2019s guitar talents and Martin\u2019s vocals\u2026.ballads just seem to work. Good song. The last four songs are nice solid hard rockers.\n\nOverall I didn\u2019t find it to be a bad album at all. I however didn\u2019t like Cross Purposes near as much as Martin\u2019s three previous Sabbath outings The Eternal Idol, Headless Cross, and TYR. I just found those be terrific outings and Cross Purposes doesn\u2019t quit live up to the standards on those release. It just lacks the catchiness and overall greatness found on those (and plus I really dig the 80\u2019s feel of those albums). Even with its very few disappointments, Cross Purposes is still very much worth checking out for fans of the underrated Martin-era Sabbath albums.\n\nI just find it a shame that Sabbath\u2019s next album Forbidden didn\u2019t turn as good or better than this. That album is eternally terrible (check out my review on it and you\u2019ll see how much I despise it) and in my opinion this officially ends the great Tony Martin era of Sabbath.\n",
        "\nSeventh Star is a real anomaly in the Black Sabbath album catalogue. The first thing that makes this album stand out as odd is the long title. The name \"Black Sabbath featuring Tony Iommi\" made more than a few Sabbath fans raise an eyebrow. The cover itself is less than extraordinary with a very blah photo of Tony in a leather jacket. At first glace, this album looks like it's going to be bad...but thankfully it isn't\n\nApparently after the disappointing release of 1983's Born Again the band went their separate ways and began to work on solo projects. Iommi got a new group together (including ex-Deep Purple vocalist Glen Hughes) and began working on a solo project. Sadly due to studio pressure, Iommi was force to release his solo album under the Black Sabbath name. I guess he got back at the studio by adding the moniker \"featuring Tony Iommi\" under the Sabbath name. This could also be a way to warn fans that this isn't a true Sabbath album.\n\nBecause this technically is Tony Iommi's first solo album it shouldn't come as a surprise that this does not sound like Black Sabbath. So it doesn't sound like Sabbath...but does that make it bad? Oh hell no as this album is actually quit good. The music is far from the doomy style Sabbath material and is more upbeat straight ahead 80's heavy metal.\n\nThe album opens with the fast paced rocker In for the Kill. I will admit I am not familiar with Glenn Hughes's vocals when he sang for Deep Purple but he fits the music well. A damn fine voice if you ask me. No Stranger to Love is a power ballad and the albums one single. For a ballad this isn't bad and I actually like it quit a bit. Turn to Stone is another power rocker that has a wonderful 80's style metal ring to it.\n\nSphinx is one of those passable \"atmospheric\" intros into a song and the Song Seventh Star is a slower, more melodic song. Danger Zone isn't bad, but don't worry it's not a cover of the popular Kenny Loggin\u2019s song from the movie Top Gun. The last three songs are rather passable but the first half is top rate. \n\nSome people frown on this release because it doesn't sound like Sabbath but it again it was never meant to. If you go into this album knowing it was supposed to be a Tony Iommi solo album I think more people will find it to their liking.\n\nThough I like this album, I am glad Iommi would reform the Sabbath band for the next album The Eternal Idol and return to more of a doomy Sabbath musical mold.\n",
        "\nI heard this album was bad but I believed it couldn't be as bad as its reputation. I first of all love vocals of Tony Martin. His vocals are magnificent on the albums Headless Cross and TYR and those albums quickly became some of my favorite Sabbath releases. Hell after hearing those albums, he quickly became one of my all time favorite vocalists. After finally purchasing and listening to Forbidden numerous times...I have to admit it is poor. Not just poor...down right terrible.\n\nThe first thing wrong with this album is the ultra shitty production. It's muddy and all the instruments are poorly mixed. Also, not aided by the crap production, is Martin's vocal performance as it is sub par. He a fantastic singer on the Sabbath albums of the past but here he just sucks it up. There is no high rang singing here, just love level garbage that borderlines on whispering in some cases. I can't believe this is the same singer.\n\nSo the first problem is the production, the second is Martin's vocal performance, and the third is just plain and simple shitty songs. I listened to this album straight through three times and nothing stayed in my memory. The album as a whole is just that unmemorable! It than sat on my shelf for about a year and then I popped it out to give it another try. Nope...still the same crap. I struggled very hard to find something positive to say about this release and all I could come up with is that Shaking Off the Chains can be somewhat stomachable and so is the power ballad I Won't Cry for You. These songs are actually poor themselves but they are the highpoints of the album. Illusion of Power is bad song (with additional vocals by Ice-T!?!) but it can work its way into your head. The rest is just boring garbage from a band that has become a shadow of their former selves.\n\nOh, and Tony Iommi. You remember him right? The great guitarist that is the master of writing simple but memorable riffs? Yeah, well he plays on here but it doesn't seem like him. The guitar playing could have been done by a amateur Sabbath die hard as opposed to the once-God like Iommi. Oh and memorable riffs? What memorable riffs? Sorry...not here.\n\nIt's been about 12 years since Forbidden and Sabbath hasn't recorded another studio album since. This is fine because after releasing a monstrosity like this, Sabbath deserved to die. It's an embarrassment to the Black Sabbath name and an insult to fans. This is hands down Sabbath's worst release. People who think Technical Ecstasy, Never Say Die, or Born Again are Sabbath's worst release just plain and simple have never heard Forbidden. It's actually unusually for me to dislike an album so much as I am pretty forgiving....but not with this release.\n\nIf I dislike this album so much...why am I keeping it? Well...it's Sabbath and it is a filler in my collection. I am thinking about purchasing another copy and plopping the CD down on coffee table right next to my Metallica St. Anger CD. Forbidden would make another great addition to my beer coaster collection. Hey, I don't want beer stains on my coffee table!!!\n",
        "\nAccording to the notes in the booklet, Ozzy was quoted saying that \"Born Again is the best album Black Sabbath recorded after my departure.\" This just further proves what a fuckin moron Ozzy really is. Born Again is not a good album and is FAR from being the best Sabbath release after Ozzy. It may not be Sabbath's worst release of the post-Ozzy era (that 'award' goes to 1995's Forbidden) but it is one of the worst.\n\nBorn Again, Sabbath's 11th studio album, introduces their third vocalist into the line-up. This time we get Ian Gillian of Deep Purple fame. I was never big on Gillians vocals when he was in Purple but I still went into this album with an open mind.\n\nThe fist thing that shocked me about the album was the shoddy production. What the hell happened? It's as if the producer fell asleep at the mixing wheels dreaming he was producing Heaven and Hell instead. Shit, I've heard band demos that have better and more balanced mixing than this....and I even have the remastered release!\n\nOne thing that did not shock me was Gillian's vocals. Like I expected they just didn't grab me. His voice just doesn't have the charisma or range of Dio. His performance also just reeks of \"session vocalist\" like he was just hired as a temporary fill-in so he didn't give the album his all. Sorry, but when it comes to all five vocalists that have sang under the Sabbath logo, Gillian is at the bottom of the barrel. I have heard though, but have not witnessed, that Gillian has a good stage presence and maybe that was what Sabbath was going for instead of vocal performance.\n\nGillian isn't the only one at fault as Tony Iommi also seems to be on auto-pilot. His simple but memorable riffs are like small pimples compared to the volcanoes present on Sabbath's past releases. The songs themselves lack substance. It is noticeable in the songwriting that Dio was not present to help write as the music is just average to flat. The album opener Trashed is a decent rocker and so is the more moody Disturbing the Priest, but the rest of the album is just poor. The lyrics are just for the most part lame. Ironically I can barely stand the albums one single Zero the Hero. My finger just inches towards the skip button when that track starts up.\n\nI apparently am not the only one feels this way as the band themselves have talked about their disappointment with the release. Gillian even ended up leaving the band over the outcome of the album, which was just fine with me (bring on Glenn Hughes and Tony Martin!). \n\nThe album may not have impressed me, but the cover art made me chuckle. I found it fitting for Sabbath's British humor. People who are offended by it (as Gillian was) need to get a grip. It's just a shame the album ended up still born.\n\nOverall if you like Sabbath and were wanting to check out material from the band after Ozzy, then get the Dio era albums Heaven and Hell and Mob Rules or the Tony Martin era albums Headless Cross and TYR. Leave Born Again as one of the last....\n",
        "\nAfter 20 best of collections gone wrong, somebody finally got it right! Put the two best Black Sabbath tracks from their sophomore album on a CD and sell it for $3. Actually, I normally hate compilation albums, but I was quite pleased with this CD. Part of it was for the CD case itself. It looked just like the outside of the black box with that awesome little winged Lucifer demon in a grey color with the black background. But there was a semi-circle carved into the side of the cardboard shell, and there was a black tab that invited me to pull it open. And out slid a black plastic tray that held a CD that was decorated in the same fashion as the coverart.\n\nBut on a serious note, it's nice to hear a decent remastering of two classic Black Sabbath songs: Iron Man and Paranoid (in reverse order).\n\nFirst off, you get Paranoid. This song was originally written as filler for their sophomore album, and you can hear everything so clearly. From that awesome beginning hammer-on power chord to the distorted sounding fuzz-box that runs along with Tony's amazingly memorable and perfectly fitting bluesy solo. In fact, I think I've read somewhere that this is one of the few solos that Tony doesn't change live (at least he does it rarely, since I saw him change the last half of it for The Queen's Jubilee in 2002) because of how memorable it is. I also like how you can actually hear the variation in the middle part of the main riff where the bass plays this four note climb when the guitar just shifts down the power chord.\n\nThen secondly, and not to mention lastly, you get Iron Man. I love how clean sounding it is. The bass drum seems even louder in the mix, and the intro behind the nut bend that is like a monster roaring just wails. Same goes for the metallic sounding \"I AM IRON MAN!\" It definitely raises some highly emotional childhood memories for me, being my first heavy metal song I ever heard and all. The solos, Ozzy's singing, even Geezer's bass... It's all so clear and audible! Then kicks in the faster tempo part, and everything is still so clear. Whomever did the remastering deserves many a commendation for their skill.\n\nThat aside, I'd like to point out that basically, this single is good for three types of people:\n\n1. People who think that Black Sabbath only has two songs, and these songs are both it... And you don't want them to think otherwise for the sake of humanity.\n2. People who have never heard Black Sabbath before, but want to know what they are going to be getting into for little money at all.\n3. The hardcore Black Sabbath collectors (like yours truly) who have to have every album (okay, but we don't care about the compilation albums... since they already released the decently inclusive first five album compilation called WSOSFRAR [We Sold Our Souls For Rock And Roll] in the 70s).\n\nSo if you're in one of those three groups, then yeah go ahead and get it. But really, if you don't already own Paranoid (the album)... Then go out and get it. It's THE essential Black Sabbath (and for that matter, heavy metal) album. But they at least captured to two most well known songs and did a very nice job of remastering them for our listening pleasure. And for that, I commend them.\n",
        "\nThis DVD (or VHS, depending on when you got it) is of high picture and sound quality and tells alot of stuff about the band that everyone except the most hardcore of fans probably know. Unlike The Black Sabbath Story Vol 1 which contained alot of stuff people already knew and just a few random video clips that had their moments but weren't too interesting, this one seemed like it had more energy in it. It could have been because it started with Ozzy leaving and the inclusion of Ronnie James Dio into the band as a lead singer for Heaven and Hell and Mob Rules... And then how it had come full circle back to Dio again for Dehumanizer all these years later after everybody had, as Vinny Appice put it \"matured\". This DVD also features scenes of the playing of the late Cozy Powell, who was a very memorable drummer.\n\nFirst off, the interactive DVD menus are killer! Such sweet graphics. And it has band discography from this era, too! The DVD starts with introductions of band members with the song Supertzar (off of Sabotage) playing over it. \n\nThe true story itself starts with video clips being played intermittently between interviews and such. Like Ronnie is talking about how Die Young is the first song they wrote on Heaven and Hell and it was just Tony and Ronnie in a hotel room of some sort playing together when Ronnie went to see about joining the band. And also about how everybody was tossing back a few drinks and they decided to write a fast song, that became known as Neon Knights. \n\nThen comes Trashed and Zero The Hero, which features Ian Gillan on vocals (from Deep Purple fame). Geezer then states how he'd become disillusioned with the whole thing and left after the end of that tour. This is the low point of the DVD, as they don't show too much of the video and it just kind of drags on. But there is a slight interview with Ian Gillan!\n\nAfter that comes the high quality black and white music video for No Stranger to Love off of Seventh Star. It's a different (more soulful) sound for Black Sabbath to go in, thanks alot to vocalist Glenn Hughes. Tony's guitar solo in this song is very tasteful and more melodic than the ones of old that were more bluesy licks.\n\nAfter that comes the promo video for The Shining, where they talk about how they got Tony Martin in at the last minute (after Ray Gillen, R.I.P.) and it is a very high quality song and video that it is a shame that this is the only way that I believe it has ever seen the light of day. It also features Geoff Nichols, the keyboardist in the video. Also a very monumental thing.\n\nAround here, there's an interview with Cozy Powell (in fact, it's called \"Cozy Powell's Last Words\" on the DVD...) that you really just need to watch to get the full effect of what he has to say. But then Tony Iommi talks about how he was trying to renew the band's credibility since he had some good producers and band members again, and they go into the Headless Cross promo video which is kind of like The Shining video in how amazing it is... It's also a very big shame that it was not used publicly more.\n\nFrom here it goes to the promo video for Tyr called Feels Good To Me. Not exactly a great metal video, but the song is kind of catchy and Tony Iommi plays his guitar solo on a spinning platform. It goes from being all arpeggiated and strummy to distorted and back every once and awhile and it makes the song really good.\n\nAfter this is a studio take of Ronnie singing into a microphone with Computer God playing, possibly the best track off of Dehumanizer (since this was done when they were recording the album and touring), and then a small interview and then cutting back to the song.\n\nThen there's TV Crimes, which has two videos. One is a band photo shoot, the other is an awesome studio shot of Tony Iommi laying down some riffage for the album (and some of Geezer later, too). The little ending fill low string fill is amazing and fast as lightning; it's almost scary to watch Tony play it.\n\nAfter that, there's the video for the song I, which is a shot of their tour from Germany when Testament opened for them. Geezer can even be seen playing a five string bass, and the band looks pretty revieved and fresh at this point, with Vinny on drums. That's pretty much it for the DVD when this is over, except they play the solo for I during the ending credits which was very amazing. \n\nThere's alot of lightning effects they did for the scene transitions that are really cool with the album covers too, or Ian Gillan's scream when showing the cover of Born Again. I had hoped they'd include the video for TV Crimes (the music video, anyway) on the DVD, but alas they didn't. But still, if you're going to want to check out stuff about the backstory of Black Sabbath, then I'd say this DVD is a must. You can even hear a little piece of what each album is like, except that Born Again and Live Evil are both really just brushed over. And they left out about Bill Ward leaving mid-way through the Heaven and Hell tour, for some reason. But other than that, this is a pretty good DVD. In fact, I'm surprised they haven't made a third DVD to cover 1992-2006.\n",
        "\nThis 2 CD compilation concentrates on the 'classic' Sabbath days, when Ozzy Osbourne was lead singer, though it contains a couple of notable post-Ozzy tracks such as \"Heaven and Hell\" and \"Turn Up the Night\". It also includes all the tracks you'd expect from such a compilation; \"Black Sabbath\", \"NIB\", \"War Pigs\", \"Paranoid\", \"Electric Funeral\", \"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\" and \"Spiral Architect\" all make an appearance.\n\nThough there's nothing really missing from this collection, there aren't any rare tracks or bonus features either, which would have been nice. It says that the tracks have been digitally remastered, but I can't tell if this makes a difference, not having CD's of the originals. The liner booklet has a concise and reasonably informative history of Black Sabbath, but nothing that half an hour with Google couldn't turn up.\n\nOverall this set is a solid introduction to Black Sabbath - it was in fact this CD set that got me into the band and metal in general, but people who already own a large Sabbath collection won't find anything new here, and people who know they like the band but haven't yet bought much of their music would probably be better off with Black Box.\n",
        "\nLet me first start this review off by saying that this is the best Sabbath albumn with Tony Martin. It just edges out TYR but a hair. His vocals give me goosebumps everytime I listen to this masterpiece. \n\nWell the first track (The Gates of Hell) is an intro leading into the title track Headless Cross which dominates the whole way through. Start off with some drums and add a nice heavy riff and the rest is history. Devil and Daughter picks up the pace and really gets you going. Quite like the material off of The Eternal Idol record. Then we have When Death Calls a more slower approach that shows off Martin's vocals ability and displays it well. Kill in the Spirit World and Call of the Wild are both in the same vein. They both possess mid paced rythyms that show off the whole bands performance. Black Moon - haha this one makes me laugh it is so good. In fact I'll say that this is my favorite track. \"I see a Black Moon rising and its calling out my name.\" Does'nt get any better, and the solo is monstorous! Well the closer Nightwing starts off with Iommi playing a little acoustic intro and then it pulverises with its heaviness. Man who knew you could write something like this amazing!\n\nClassic record all the way around. There isn't a doubt in my mind that this is one of the best of all time.\n",
        "\nThe first \"Metal\" record, end of the story. This however, makes it an extremely difficult work to review. If one doesn't praise it enough, then their credibility seems to be put into question and it's hard to objectively peer into the blueprint for all that follows. That being said I don't think it's perfect by any stretch, but I'll do my best. \n\nThis is the \"archetype\" for Metal music (along with the next five Sabbath offerings) so naturally there's still a few \"bugs\" to be worked out here; most notably the overtly bluesy elements and instrumental noodling here and there. (This is by no means crappy noodling ala Dream Theater but it still feels more like a drugged out jammed session at times) A little crackling of thunder, rain is pouring moderately hard on a gloomy looking church, and then the bell tolls...\n\nThe title track comes crawling it's way into your ears with an ominous and slow sinister movement, until the power kicks in and you are swallowed into the darkness. The whole album seems to alternate between more doomy tendencies and blues-based hard rock. Ozzy Osbourne's vocals are at the most disturbed here for sure; a drunken sounding drone that's occasionally catchy.\n\nThere's plenty of \"non-metal\" qualities to this album as well, like the bluesy \"The Wizard\" or the intro to \"A Bit of Finger\" (Very cool BTW) It's not hard to pick out great moments or interesting parts and it's a definitely must listen if just for a history lesson or curiousity. Some of these parts would be the classic \"N.I.B.\" or the strangely hypnotizing middle section of \"Wicked World\" just to name a few examples. Another thing I must point out though is the great jazzy drumming Bill Ward lays down throughout the entire record, there's great fills everywhere that work around the very prominent bass. In short, this is an essential listen; no ifs, ands, or buts. \n\nAfterthought: I've never heard the tune \"Evil Woman\" that appears on some versions so I can't make any comment about it.\n",
        "\nAfter a string of mediocre albums with Tony Martin, Sabbath regroup with former vocalist Ronnie James Dio. Dio, of course had a succesful solo career but like Sabbath, he had kind of lost his touch over time. I guess both Sabbath and Dio really needed something to get them back on track, and boy this was the album to do it. \n\nThe production is absolutely perfect, Sabbath hasn't sounded this heavy since Volume 4. Dio is back on the top of his game, putting his powerful voice to good use. Geezer is absolutely amazing as usual, there's good reason why this guy is one of the best bassists ever. Appice is solid, his drum sound is pretty bad ass on here. But it's Tony Iommi who really makes a come back, you would think after 20,000 albums Iommi would have ran out of riffs long ago. But this shit is so fresh and heavy you can't help but bow down and give the man his due. His lead work has improved alot too, playing some of his fastest and at the same time most melodic solos to date.\n\n\"Computer God\" starts the album off quite nicely, a really heavy, vocal driven song. Awesome pre-chorus harmonics, nice breakdown about half way through blazing back in at even faster speed for an awesome solo. \"After All(The Dead)\" is a slower song with some menacing layered vocals from Dio, after a while it picks up and turns into a nice plodding head banger. Not the best Sabbath song in the world, but not bad either. \"TV Crimes\" is a fast paced rocker, borderline speed metal. A nice contrast to the slower songs before it, great song, this is what heavy metal is all about. \n\n\"Letters From Earth\" sounds like something that could have been released on Sabbath Bloody Sabbath or Vol. 4. A dark and brutally heavy song, nothing new or special but effective none the less. \"Master of Insanity\" comes up next, that riff that kicks in at about 40 seconds...Oh yeah, that's got Iommi wrote all over it. An insanely catchy chorus, man that thing will get stuck in your head for days. Awesome song. \"Time Machine\" is probably the most well known song from the album, it's more up-beat and VERY catchy. That intro riff sounds like something Manowar would write. A definite highlight. \"Sins of the Father\" is an awesome mid paced epic, Dio sounds exceptionally great at the beginning. Listen to that breakdown at about 2:20....Total fucking ownage, man that riff gets me every time \"They call it mystery, but any fool can see...\" one of the greatest moments in heavy metal history, right up there with \"The world is full of kings and queens, who'll blind your eyes and steal your dreams...\" \n\n\"Too Late\" is really cool song, another epic. Starting off with just an accoustic guitar and Dio's voice, building up to extreme heaviness and ending in the same manner it started. \"I\" seems to be a favorite off the album, and there's no doubt as to why. A fast paced head banger, kick ass riffs and some more menacing vocals, an absolute crusher of a song. Some classic Dio lyrics also. \"Buried Alive\" ends the album in good fashion, fast and heavy. Probably the best solo on the album.\n\nAll in all this is a great \"come back album\" for Sabbath. It's not really anything new or innovative, and it's not the best album in the world. It's just some really kick ass heavy metal, simple as that.\n",
        "\nYes, it's not the tightest, punchiest, most digitally-enhanced record out there, but who cares? It's the original Sabbath line-up getting back to doing what they've done all their lives. Ok, Ozzy's voice isn't quite there for a few high notes, but the feeling is still there. The sound isn't identical to the sound of the records, but why should it be? This was 1997 and the best of their work was early to mid seventies. The warmth between the band is still there, and they've still got their energy. \nIommi's guitar takes on a particularly evil, brutal, particularly during the solos, while Geezer's bass complements it perfectly, fitting underneath with more clarity, although slightly less volume, than on the originals. As I mentioned, Ozzy's voice breaks up slightly on the high notes of songs such as War Pigs and Black Sabbath, but that just makes him sound all the more evil. Bill Ward makes full use of his thunderous, expansive new sound, especially during NIB and Iron Man. \nAs far as standout tracks go, it really depends on perspective. If your favourite song is Children of the Grave, then you'll probably appreciate the explosive new dimension it's got out of the new technology, and the same goes for most of the other songs on there. Of course, if you can't bear to hear War Pigs or Black Sabbath changed, then don't buy it. \nThe two last tracks, recorded in a studio shortly before the gig, are the reason my review is less than 100%. After so much great music, though, I think we can excuse them this little fuck-up. Anyway, they're at the end, so you can just put in the next CD a little early.\n",
        "\nEver onward and upward, Sabbath introduces us to a lighter side after the bristling metal fury of Vol. 4, lighter on the crushing Iommi, more of the experimental side of the band. Every reviewer previous has mentioned that here the drugs have begun to take their toll, and to a certain extent it's true. None but those possessed of earth-shattering genius or mountains of drugs could arrive at a creation so boldly experimental, so schizophrenically varied yet aligned in feel; having seen \"The Osbournes\" I'm forced to conclude that it was probably the latter.\n\nThat said, Sabbath was certainly more successful at experimenting than Deep Purple who, more often than not, appeared to be filled with a pathological hatred of metal to the point that they had to make up for their obligatory speed metal jam with a whole heapin' helping of annoying jazz and horrific white soul. Here Sabbath doesn't have much truck with funk or reggae or any of those other ill-advised muses that most seventies bands succumbed to. Instead we get a pinch of the classic Sabbath trudge mixed in with unique instrumentation, more melody, and yet more brave song choices. It's albums like this that shred the claim that Sabbath were nothing but the musical equivalent of apes swinging their clubs and going 'BAM BAM' on record.\n\nConsider for a start the title track, probably the only song from this record that endures in the collective metal consciousness. Sure, the riffing is pretty damn heavy, but consider the strange melodic breaks, the totally off-kilter song-structures. The lyrics represent a return to the Satanic lyricism of the classic \"Black Sabbath\", but from the feminine perspective of a prospective parent of a \"Rosemary's Baby\". They express empathy for the protagonist, sadness and rage in equal shots all through these inappropriately sunny Wishbone Ash-y hippie acoustics before dropping back into one of the most bald-faced hammer-riffs in the whole catalogue. You bastards indeed.\n\nThis song is a microcosm for the album on the whole in the same way \"Angel of Death\" represents Reign in Blood or \"Black Star\" from Rising Force. That's not to say that the song is a formula though, it's just the feel of it. Really, none of the songs are in any way alike one another save for this pulsing lifeline of experimentation and the excitement of discovery running through the whole record and Geezer Butler's brilliant lyrics.\n\nConsider the drenched cyborgian synths of \"Who Are You\", the white-noise shock of \"F/X\" applied to a real song. In a catalogue full of depressing plodding, it is perhaps this song that plods the most, treads the deepest. The sheer heaviness (in the psychological sense) of Ozzy's distorted vocals as he lays out the destiny of man can put your whole day in a darker mood.\n\nConsider the full-length acoustic instrumental \"Fluff\", the first acoustic passage to resemble a true song in full. Consider the lively bounce of \"Looking for Today\", perhaps the first truly happy Sabbath song. That riff is just so damn bop-able, and the vocal melody is all drooling catchy joy. I love the percussion on this song, crazy Ward completely crazy while the rest of the band accompanies with well-timed claps.\n\nI mentioned bizarre instruments earlier, but I think a list of the instruments used according to the liners might be in order to really sink it into the fleshy pink of your mind.\n\nElectric Guitar\nAcoustic Guitar\nSteel Guitar\nVocals\nDrums\nBass\nFuzz Bass\nHarpsichord\nPiano\nSynthesiser (played by, of all people, Rick Wakeman!)\nMellotrons\nTimpani\nFlute\nOrgan\nBagpipes\nFiddle, a whole orchestra of them\nNose\nHands\nAnvil + Bathtub (yes, really although it's not in the liners)\n\nIt's stupefying that all of these are played on the same album that includes two world-class metal anthems in \"Killing Yourself to Live\" and the godly \"A National Acrobat\" (granted the second main riff is a little lame, but whatever), plus the stoner boogie-woogie metal of \"Sabbra Cadabra\" which is possibly the only Metallica cover that they truly fucked up. Their version has none of the infectious fun of the original, although when they drop the riff from \"A National Acrobat\" into the mix I am in heaven.\n\nAll of this builds up to what remains the most artistic song the band would ever do, and perhaps the best combination of symphony and rock I've ever heard. \"Spiral Architect\" contains perhaps the most poetic and oddly meaningful lyrics Butler ever wrote. The stuff is doggerel, it means nothing, and yet there is something indefinably grand about them, just like the rest of the song. It sounds like what might be played on the path to heaven as one looks back on their life. It sums up the Sabbath experience without being very Sabbathy, it sums up life without being lively. The instrumentation is precise, delicate, and perfect, more reminiscent of flute music than anything generally performed on a guitar.\n\nThere is something oddly delicate about the album on the whole, the production slightly weak, the music vaguely sad and on the whole dreary like an English rain. At the same time it's invigorating to hear such unique music. This is progressive like no other music on the planet, and even on the proggy Sabotage its delicate style has never been re-captured. You know, if the Sabs wanted their respect back an album along these lines rather than absurd, desperately out-of-it attempts at modern thud metal would be the best way to do the job.\n\nStand-Outs: \"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\", \"Spiral Architect\", \"Looking for Today\"\n",
        "\nFrom the half of the 80's and to end of it, Sabbath was stormed by numerous line-up changes. The line-up had been varied from album to album since 1978's Never say die, except the Dio-era albums Mob rules and Live evil, which had the same line-up. Men have entered and left Sabbath too many times to no-one to remember actually how many. But that hasn't stopped Iommi (only original member) to make good music. The post-Dio albums have always been persecuted by the glorious albums of the early 70's and that is a shame.\n\nBlack Sabbath's two previous albums with vocalist Tony Martin are musically similar to Tyr. But the band has made a concept album this time. Christianity is still an important subject for Sabbath to handle, but it has also added themes from Norse mythology to the soup.\n\nTyr's first track is entitled \"Anno Mundi\". The start is dim and cold, then the cold but infernal guitar riff fills the air. Riffmeester Iommi has done it again! If someone thought that Iommi couldn't build clever riffs and combide them to crushing songs, Iommi's raunchy guitar will make the suspicious bastard so little that he could fit into keyhole. Martin's too many times under-rated vocals are clear and loud, backing Iommi's guitar. The storm behind the drums makes this sound even more massive than it was alongside with raging bass sound. \n\n\"The law maker\" speeds the tempo up. It is probably the fastest Sabbath song. The songs in this speed are usual to other bands, not the band like the doomy Sabbath. Fast songs in Sabbath's back catalogue are rare, that is what makes this track special and awesome. \"Jerusalem\" explodes and reveals great riff, what is actually commonplace to Black Sabbath songs. Ordinary Sabbath song, which isn't a bad thing at all. \"The Sabbath stones\" is a classic later-Sabbath song. It is more peaceful and darker song, but the hellhammer blows shatter the silence.\n\nThe next three tracks could be named as \"The Valhalla-trilogy\". \"The battle of Tyr\" is silent ambient track, which could be from any Lord of the Rings-movie. The silence continues with \"Odin's court\", which includes acoustic guitar, a silent electric guitar solos in the back and Tony Martin's vocals. In the middle of the Martin's vocals, the song \"Valhalla\" suddenly starts. The listener doesn't even notice the transition between the three songs. For you who doesn't know what the \"Valhalla\" means, here's some info. The word \"Valhalla\" means the warriors's heaven where warriors fought eternally in Norse mythology. The song, not surprisingly tells about that. \n\nThe album changes course during the song \"Feels good to me\", both musically and lyrically. It could be regarded as an album's mandatory ballad. It doesn't make you cry, the guitar attack prevents it. It's better not to say anymore about this. \"Heaven in black\" is same as the first tracks of the album. The drumming sounds like a groundfall, bass is loud and guitar cries and howls. It's a perfect ending. The album ends fast in complete silence. Was that it?\n\nYes it was. The album is powerful Sabbath stuff packed with good guitar riffs, which are the Sabbath's and especially Iommi's trademark. If you don't buy this album after reading a review mocking this album, burn that review! It's foul! If you belong to those who say that Iommi couldn't have written any good riffs after Mob Rules, I have something to say to you: Fuck you!\n",
        "\nBlack Sabbath's debut LP is generally regarded as the first heavy metal album ever recorded, and while there will never be any definitive way to confirm whether or not that opinion is true or false, I remain in total agreement with the common concensus. To this day, the song \"Black Sabbath\" is in every respect the quintessential metal song, and in my opinion is still one of the only rock songs which successfully conveys an atmosphere of horror. By all accounts, it was Sabbath's express intention to make a kind of \"scary\" music, music which would give people the same sort of experience they looked for in horror films.\n\nSabbath's success resulted from having a clear conception of what they wanted to do, and from being able to creatively execute their vision through musical means. They almost single-handedly invented an entire genre in the process. I say almost, because obviously \"heavy\" music existed before Sabbath: acts like Cream, Hendrix, Zeppelin, The Who, were making a lot of noise and blazing paths into various frontiers; but Sabbath's first album, more than any other classic album from the same era, was more intently focused on a single idea, was more specialized and particular. Sabbath made it very apparent, right from the start, what they were all about. The album art itself is frightening, with that mysterious pale woman lurking in the foreground, half-smiling like some freshly exhumed Mona Lisa. You knew what you were getting before you got the vinyl out of the slip-cover; and if the band's name or the album art didn't convince you, the thunderstorm and the ominous bells, which open up \"Black Sabbath\", would. The three doom-laden notes from that song are justly famous and need no defense at this point: let it suffice to say that they effectively changed the popular music world from that point onwards. \n\nBlack Sabbath: The prototype heavy metal track, hands down. Plodding, doom-laden, darkly melodic riff, atmospheric sound effects, and, more importantly, a voice that sounds genuinely afraid. The \"Oh no, no, please God help me..\" is still amazingly powerful and expressive. Ozzy's voice is deeper here than it is just about anywhere else, and at times he tries for a low note that he can't quite reach; but to me these honest flubs fit the mood of the song, and help to convey a sense of anguish and terror. A faster muted riff finishes out the song, creating a sense of tension and flight, and features some Iommi soloing which demonstrates his skill with vibrato. If I were asked to choose one song which defined the term \"heavy metal\", I would pick this song.\n\nThe Wizard: It seems that every band had their harmonica-songs back then. Personally, I could survive in a world without harmonicas, but it's employed in a decent way in this song. The song is catchy, thanks mostly to Bill Ward's excellent drum-work, which connects a blunt but effective chordal riff. Nothing to rave about as far as the singing: Ozzy's voice breaks up a bit. Thankfully, he found a home in a higher register later on. Over-all I don't get too excited about this song.\n\nBehind the Wall of Sleep: Great song. The title, from horror writer H.P. Lovecraft, is perfect for the atmosphere of the album. Another inventive single-note riff with a bass line that rambles all around underneath the singing parts in a way that is distinctly Geezer. More great work from Bill Ward; passable, but nonetheless inspired, singing from Ozzy, who still hasn't found his comfort zone. \n\nN.I.B.: More people need to learn that the first-person is a literary device. Just as the song, \"Black Sabbath\" is just a narrative, a fictional story and not a personal testimony from one or all of the band-members, so \"N.I.B.\" is just a story: a love song, of sorts, from the Devil's perspective. How anyone could determine that the band were devil-worshippers from the lyrics of their songs is a mystery to me, since Satan is most typically presented in a negative light, especially in forthcoming albums. In this song, however, Lucifer is seen as being dark and seductive: he has this person \"under his power\"; but it's just a story, a type of old-style gothic narrative, not some sneaky advocacy of evil. Musically speaking, the riff is mundane and is reminiscent of Cream's \"Sunshine of Your Love\"; I also don't care for Ozzy's singing right along with the riff. The slow breaks are the high parts of this track, with Ozzy giving a slightly wobbly operatic croon over descending chords. This is an early hint of the kind of things he would do brilliantly on subsequent albums.\n\nEvil Woman/Wicked World: Depending on which version of the LP you have, either one of these two songs opens up side two. To my mind, Wicked World is by far the superior song, and \"Evil Woman\" is essentially a throw-away cover which never generated a great deal of interest for me. Apparently, the American version of the LP put \"Wicked World\" in place of \"Evil Woman\": \"Wicked World\" being originally the B-side to the \"Evil Woman\" single. An excellent choice, but I have no idea at the moment whether or not Sabbath authorized the change. At any rate, \"Wicked World\" is a Sabbath classic, with some nice single-note riffing opening up the track, faster and a bit trickier than the material up to this point. A simple but excellent cue-in fill by Bill Ward sets the pace for the mid-tempo main riff, another single-note affair which is simple yet packs a punch. Geezer flies underneath the vocal line, yet again, and if you hear this tune on a crappy system you'll miss its finer points. Ozzy is still singing in the lower-range which is present throughout the album, but climbs up dramatically (and rather skillfully) in the third line of each verse. This is the only track on the album which makes a political/social statement, and though over-simplified and non-specific, the message is a powerful response to the prevailing flower-power fluff coming out of a lot bands of that era. Though I might get hanged for saying it, I feel the lengthy Iommi solo is rather pointless and distracting. Iommi's genius was as a composer of monumentally original and powerful metal riffs, but his soloing (particularly here, with no musical backdrop) is, at this point, still rather on the rough side. \n\n\"Sleeping Village\": The obligatory soft-touch. Personally, I love this pastoral miniature. The gloomy atmosphere is perfect for the album. It's also one of the very rare times you'll hear a jew's harp (or something that sounds exactly like one) in a metal song. Whether it works or is just plain goofy, is your call. Ozzy's voice is deep and shaky, but emotionally charged and effective. There is sometimes a sincerity in his voice which is all but absent in a lot of metal vocalists, past and present, and I think it's at least partly due to that sincerity that Sabbath made such a strong connection to its fans. Unlike a great deal of subsequent Sab sleepers and fillers, like \"Fluff\" and \"Laguna Sunrise\", I never skip over this song. \n\n\"Warning\": Over-long blues cover, but somehow sits well with this album. Some of the more obvious flubs from Ozzy, who seems, more than ever, to be struggling in a tone he is not suited for. More solo-soloing from Iommi, sometimes inspired and interesting, sometimes not; a lengthy and apparently improvisational jazz-like jam, which is the high-part of the track for me. Over-all, the song seems a bit haphazardly pieced together. It's nonetheless listenable for its doomy atmosphere, and for Iommi's decent tone through the primary parts.\n\nI can't imagine gathering a collection of metal albums without acquiring this historic landmark of a record. Few bands, when all is said and done, will be able to boast of putting out an LP as revolutionary and standard-setting as \"Black Sabbath\".\n",
        "\nBlack Sabbath, the bong-headed dead-beat dads of metal proper, had accomplished virtually everything that they were ever going to according to the mainstream by the end of the Master of Reality record. On every compilation, on every radio playlist in the Sabbath section, every song that non-fans remember are generally from the first three records. According to your mom and dad (excluding those rare parents who rocked and can actually remember doing so) this is Black Sabbath.\n\n\"Paranoid\"\n\"Iron Man\"\n\"Black Sabbath\"\n\"War Pigs\"\n\"Sweet Leaf\"\n\"Children of the Grave\" (maybe)\n\nScary how a catalogue can be diminished to so little, more frightening still when it's a catalogue as deep and rewarding as that of Black Sabbath. For many years people feared the ominous tones of Sabbath, but with Ozzy's recent public castration at the hands of MTV and his wife, sadly, people have forgotten their fear. Ozzy, and his back catalogue, have become accessible.\n\nMaster of Reality trudges out of the primordial ooze to remind them that they should be afraid. This record is a monster, a real state of mind, this boggy swamp monster emerging from the abyss and shedding islands from it's shaggy back. This is Sabbath's first really good production job, Geezer's bass being so loud and so flat-out heavy that Iommi could take the album off and the band would still be heavier than any other band plying their trade as of '71. \n\nFrom the initial choking cough of \"Sweet Leaf\" through the final thump of \"Into the Void\" the album is crushing, Black Sabbath playing on a more acid rock or even blues metal vibe, those almost jazzy structures on some of the songs buried under the deafening cacophony of the trio of master players. Fully five of the albums six full tracks are unabashed bashers on a whole 'nother level from what has come before, a horror unmatched \u2018til the advent of the raw electrics of Vol. 4.\n\n\"Sweet Leaf\" marks the birth of stoner metal, from the obvious lyrical influence to the big hazy riff, one of those murky classics that shows the close brotherhood of doom and stoner, that riff played a less loose (or more dark) way being as much a blackened abyss as any other Sabbatherian nightmare. A steaming side of Hawkwind later and you get Kyuss and Monster Magnet and the other bleary-eyed kings of the scene as it exists today.\n\nNext, \"After Forever\" gives us the creation of white metal, and more specifically Trouble. Everybody thinks \"Black Sabbath\", \"N.I.B\", yeah yeah darkness reigns etc. This song proves that the Sabs were hardly the droopy gothic Satanists that history portrays them as. There is an intelligent lyric here(perhaps a bit too preachy though) questioning those who question religion for the wrong reasons, a pair of memorable riffs the first of which forecasts the 'happier' Sabbath numbers like \"Tomorrow's Dream\", \"Looking for Today\", and \"Never Say Die\", the second which bashes almighty sledge.\n\n\"Children of the Grave\" is one of those rumbly, propulsive forced marches like the \"Black Sabbath\" fast break, the song certainly one part of the Maiden formula (the other part being the Priest/Wishbone Ash harmony leads), that being the trademark Harris gallop. It's also a pretty cool song, the outro slightly long of tooth (about four minutes counting the cool \"Orchid\" instrumental), but Ozzy in top form over another 'the world is going to shit' warning lyric. Furthermore, the drumming here is positively tribal, Bill Ward proving once more to be one of the keys to the Sabbath equation.\n\nThe next track (after \"Orchid\") is a really, really pounding piece of almost southern doom, appropriately given a massive, must-hear cover by Corrosion of Conformity on the Nativity in Black tribute album. \"Lord of the World\" starts out lazy, drooping bass leading to a bouncy rollercoaster riff, except that it's a rollercoaster wherein every hill is small and every fall is long, slowly descending into the smoky lungs of hell. This is one of the Sabbath songs where you get the impression that the band is actually comprised of a few guys who can kick some ass, the terrified and helpless hero of \"Black Sabbath\" replaced by a guy who can grab Satan by the neck and tear his soul out (\"the soul I took you from you was not even missed\"). Yeah cool, arms crossed, eyebrows sloped, asses kicked.\n\nHell, here's a track that didn't really influence anyone. What a relief! \"Solitude\" is like a more fully realized \"Planet Caravan\", an oasis in the midst of the parched purple desert of Master of Reality. It's oddly cold, vacant Ozzy, depressed flute (?!) from Iommi.\n\nAnd finally, \"Into the Void\", a song heavy like all the others but with a special bite, Iommi writing a riff with claws and teeth, a stack of amps with a savagely machine-like tone that I can't recall hearing anywhere else. The lyrically melodies start off a little annoying, but irregardless this is a band operating on a higher level. This song is the apex of the record, the last song and what may as well be the last word in music in general. It's apocalyptic. It's skull-fryingly heavy. It's Master of Reality, and after listening to this whole record, the light just isn't the same for a few minutes.\n\nSo yeah... there are a few problems I might add, spoiling that if I may say so, cool climax of this review, but I gotta say \u2018em. The album is too short, and sometimes Ozzy sounds a little out of breath (the bash 'em up smash 'em up ending section of \"After Forever\"), and the songwriting isn't as strong as Sabbath Bloody Sabbath or Sabotage. Other than that... well, pick this thing up.\n\nStand-Outs: \"Lord of this World\", \"Children of the Grave\", \"Into the Void\"\n",
        "\nNormally this would be a space for yet more of my caterwauling, but the Sabbath compilations seem to be following the road less travelled by of late (reviewing in chronological order, I'm up to '96), this album featuring NOTHING from Black Sabbath or Paranoid, one from Master of Reality and amazingly, no \"Laguna Sunshine\". Odd.\n\nAny compilation of only seven tracks that features \"The Writ\", \"Supernaut\", \"Sabbra Cadabra\", and \"St. Vitus Dance\" is a winner and a half, but I don't need to spell out that this is seven f'n tracks. I don't what to call this, a song sampler, a practical joke? Where did they expect this to find an audience? Greenland?\n",
        "\nWell, my wish to represent the post-Ozzy catalogue has been fulfilled, in fact, this doing me one better by skipping the original Dio records in favour of Martin, Gillan, one late Dio, and uh, more Martin.\n\nWell, I can't really recommend it. There is just waaaaaay too much from of all things, Tyr, and zero Ozzy and one Dio is absolutely unheard of. It's like taking the problems with the previous comps and turning the dial entirely the other way, a greatest hits set with no hits (save \"TV Crimes), and few songs that are familiar to anyone. I don't know what audience this was aiming for, because whatever fans Martin has got should already have bought the bunch he had up this point, but if the initial Sabbath compilation We Sold Our Souls for Rock 'n' Roll was released after an acceptable length of time, than I guess this is too.\n\nSo yeah, points for being strange, said points and more taken away for covering five crappy albums (Born Again, Tyr, Dehumanizer, Cross Purposes, and Forbidden).\n\nStand-Outs: Hmmm...no.\n",
        "\nIt is fucking inexcusable for a compilation from the 90's to cover six albums only out of a catalogue of more than a dozen. This is a regression back to 1977's Greatest Hits, the flaws of that one tenfold. If this had been the first Sab compilation I'd have drooled all over it, but come on. It's got some cool tracks that rarely get any respect like \"Killing Yourself to Live\" and \"Wheels of Confusion\", true, but visions of Heaven and Hell, The Mob Rules, The Eternal Idol, and The Headless Cross keep filling my head with an urge to break stuff.\n\nIt enrages me to see such a blithe dismissal of an incredible series of records, particularly by a no-name sub-distributor of a real record company, these hallowed gems whored out to sharks who just don't give a damn. Fuck 'em.\n\nOh, and dear lord, \"LAGUNA SUNSHINE\" AGAIN!?\n\nStand-Outs: Go to hell.\n",
        "\nNow, why this compilation doesn't include the song \"Heaven and Hell\" I don't f'n know.\n\nI guess I'll inform you of my rules regarding compilations here: I try not to lower the thing's mark for not including songs that don't exist at the time of release, and I don't lower it's mark for being inferior to subsequent comps. If it's worse than compilations that precede it... well, I'll ravage it. Also, I can't give good songs really low marks unless the compilation itself feels cheap or tries to fuck with me in some other way (song edits; curse them!).\n\nSo anyway, this is the first Sabbath compilation that is reasonably fair in representing every album equally (in Sabbath's catalogue, this is kind of a must), each album thus far getting a track in here. To be honest, while I jump for joy at Sabotage, Heaven and Hell, and The Mob Rules getting their fair shake, I feel a little angry that this isn't you know, status quo already.\n\nAnyway, Technical Ecstasy haters should be pumped to see that the universally chosen 'good song' from that album, \"Back Street Kids\" (not Backstreet Boys, say thankya) is here as is the hippy dippy \"Never Say Die\" from that album. Not a bum track here (well, \"Zero the Hero\", but whatever).\n\nSo, as Sab comps go, this isn't bad. Better ones will come, and it lacks of the prestige of the very first one, but hearty salutes for trying.\n\nStand-Outs: Again, I ain't gonna bother.\n",
        "\nNow, other than the sweet cover (We Sold Our Soul responds with the freaky pic of the woman in the glass coffin and the none-more-black cover), this is a redundant weakling, a weazing little sister to the more famous and deservedly revered predecessor in this compilations game.\n\nSo, seeing as it's 1977 and the band has released two more records, one of which was incredibly uhhh... incredible (Sabotage), and the record before that (Sabbath Bloody Sabbath) receieved virtually no attention last time, what do you as a compilation marker do on this blandly named Greatest Hits comp? Well, obviously not what seems pretty fucking obvious to me.\n\nInstead, boredom. You've heard these songs before, and you've heard them inside of much better packages. Also, why in the hell is \"Laguna Sunrise\" on here, again? You get an abbreviated version of a catalogue abbreviation, and considering how rare this probably is, also a more expensive one.\n\nAvoid this piece of crap.\n\nStand-Outs: Meh.\n",
        "\nWell step on down brother, because here's your chance to be too cheap to buy the real albums, which up to this point are all more than worth owning. So yeah, this really does have all the songs Sabbath would ever be known for by the layman, heavily depending on the romping, stomping early records. Fully fifteen of these seventeen are from the first four, meaning you get a lonely two from Sabbath's very best Ozzy records, Sabbath Bloody Sabbath and Sabotage.\n\nI can't question most of these choices, \"Black Sabbath\", \"Paranoid\", \"Iron Man\", \"War Pigs\", \"Children of the Grave\", and \"Sweet Leaf\" their primary source of income, this collection for the most part too concerned with the bonafide hits (or at least songs with lots of airplay, Sabbath didn't have hits really) for album tracks, and when it tries to cover some it fails miserably. Why the hell is \"Laguna Sunrise\" on here? And furthermore, why is it on about 80% of the Sabbath compilations? It's nothing! If I asked you to pick \"Laguna Sunrise\" out of a line-up to the average guy, well, good luck man. Hell, I even understand including total shit like \"Am I Going Insane\" because it was an advance single, and the album was out prior to Sabotage.\n\nIf you're gonna own one Sabbath, be a man and pick one of the records. If you don't have the balls, this is likely the cheapest compilation. However, if you grab the remaster it's two discs, and there are better compilations out there. So, buyer be reasonably aware.\n\nStand-Outs: Goddamit, I can't pick.\n",
        "\nBlack Sabbath, famous for their heavier form of rock and roll at the time had started their career right here with this album. After playing a few shows around england, the Sabbath unit were able to snag a record deal with warner bros. entertainment. Their first album under WB, Black Sabbath, proved to be one of the most creative efforts by the band. This album includes everything from doom metal innovating songs such as the epic \"Black Sabbath\", to the simple jam type songs such as \"WASP\"\n\nThe album begins with Black Sabbath, Black Sabbath is a slow yet powerful piece as the mood for the song becomes really dark. Unlike most rock at the time this song is quite entertaining despite it's 3 constant notes for 4 and a half minutes. Getting better as it speeds up when iommi plays one of the coolest metal riffs i've been able to hear.\n\nThe second track, The Wizard, reminds me a lot of a led zeppelin song, maybe it's the harmonica or the more classic rock type feel to the song, it's an interesting track, but seems really out of place after the darkness of a 6 minute track much like \"Black Sabbath\".\n\nThe third track is three songs in one, the first being a jam called \"Wasp\" which is much like a classic rock song done with a small addition of metal to it. The track fades right into \"Behind the wall of sleep\", a song that reminds me a bit of heavier form of blues. After \"Behind the wall of sleep\", the track goes into \"Bassically\", which is pretty much a drum solo and them a trippy bass solo before going into \"NIB\". N.I.B. continues to show the face of early heavy metal, the lyrics and riff are really catchy every time i hear the song it gets stuck in my head for a few days. A great way to end the 10 and a half minute track, but i think it does no justice for the song in itself.\n\nTrack number 4, Wicked World, Wicked World has a weird, somewhat middle eastern theme to it with the guitars, yet also strange with the other sound effects. Quickly going a simple yet powerful metal type song to jam around to. Not really a song that's catchy but a cool song to chill out with.\n\nAnd then onward with the jams, because that's all the last track is, with the exception of a really cool melody that's found around the 2 minute mark and carries on for less than a minute.\n\nBasically this album is a quite diverse jam with black sabbath. A few teenagers goofing off in the studio and writing two really good and catchy metal tracks as well as one that sounds as if paying homage to the classic rock/hard rock bands of the time in the early seventies. Not as great as later albums such as Paranoid, Master of Reality, and Sabbath, bloody sabbath, but nonetheless an important aspect to the collection of any black sabbath fan. Could have been much better, but it shows the face of early heavy metal in a form that you can't look down upon!\n",
        "\nWhere shall I start? This is a much different sound than the first two Black Sabbath albums. It has a quicker pace, and the use of guitars is much more evident, as opposed to the first two album, but especially the first album, here guitars weren\u2019t a major part of the sound that the band was trying to portray. Sabbath Bloody Sabbath is a great album for those who do not appreciate the more Doom Metal sounding Black Sabbath albums and desire something more melodic.\n\nThe opening track, \u201cSabbath Bloody Sabbath,\u201d is an example of the different sound that Black Sabbath tried on this album. Both Black Sabbath sounds offer a fantastic listening experience as they both accomplish the same factor that makes this album a must hear. That thing is atmosphere. It produces and atmosphere that relaxes you, and an atmosphere that makes you want to listen to this album again and again. Most of the Ozzy-Era Sabbath albums create an atmosphere that is an imperative aspect that makes the albums magnificent. \n\nThe third track is what irritates me. \u201cFluff,\u201d is an example of a track that does not have to be included on the album yet is added for no apparent reason, which ultimately hinders the overall satisfaction one gets after listening to the album. Countless albums throughout the Metal discography have this kind of track. Most notably, Manowar suffers from this tragic disorder that has ill-fated many albums and bands. I am still unsure of why bands do this, but I do know that it certainly does not make the album better. Now, this isn\u2019t the worst case this disorder, but it certainly is not a track that gets much play when I listen to this album. I would have enjoyed a \u201cPlanet Caravan\u201d sounding song much more.\n\n\u201cSabbra Cadabra,\u201d is one of the highlights from the album and has an extremely recognizable sound to it. The guitar solos in the beginning are one of the strong features that this song displays. The lyrical theme of this song also presents a different trait to the general Sabbath lyrical theme. The love theme that this song contains is a very distinctive approach, yet proves to be a well worth effort to break away from the generally monotonous dark theme of the previous albums.\n\nThe weaker tracks on the album are \u201cKilling Yourself To Live\u201d and \u201cWho Are You?\u201d The do offer some great guitar work; yet do not have the same energy that the other tracks are almost in excess of. \u201cWho Are You\u201d is pretty much the filler on the album, with its repetitive sound and not too memorable lyrics.\n\nThe song \u201cSpiral Architect,\u201d like \u201cSabbra Cadabra,\u201d again, offers a brighter lyrical style. It is a much-appreciated feel to the general atmosphere of the album. Songs such as these are what differ this album from the first and second albums. Along the closing track, \u201cLooking for Today,\u201d which is a more cheerful song, the general mood of the album shifts more to the middle, between dark and light offering a well balanced listen. The closing track is very appropriate as it concludes the more melodic Black Sabbath album with a very melodic Black Sabbath tune.\n",
        "\nHighlights:\nTrashed\nDisturbing the Priest\nZero the Hero\n\n-----\n\nOkay first off, I actually like the cover of Born Again. The devil-baby thing. I mean, sure, it just screams Spinal Tap, but it\u2019s still pretty cool. Come on, it\u2019s got yellow fingernails! Yellow fingernails, can you believe it? And yellow teeth! It must be a lifelong smoker.\n\n\u201cTrashed\u201d kicks things off with a bang, but Ian Gillan\u2019s scream soon comes in to ruin things. I mean, he\u2019s not all bad, but this scream is just awful. The lyrics to this song are actually really cool (about drunk driving of course!), and there are some rockin riffs if you ask me. The production is really really really really cheesy. REALLY cheesy. It\u2019s just so\u2026 eighties! And you can\u2019t hear the bass at all. But whatever, \u201cTrashed\u201d is alright. I have the feeling that if it weren\u2019t for the mediocre singing, this would be an all-time classic. Imagine Ozzy singing this. Or even Tony Martin (I would say Ronnie Dio, but I really can\u2019t picture him singing this song). And what the hell is \u201cthere was no tequila, there was no tequila\u201d? Well I\u2019m bashing this song a lot, but I actually like it. I give it 6/10, it would be higher with a more competent singer.\n\nNext off is \u201cStonehenge\u201d which doesn\u2019t count, and then \u201cDisturbing the Priest\u201d. The laughing. The laughing! What is with the laughing!? No but seriously, the laughing sucks. Otherwise, this is one of the album\u2019s better songs. Some interesting melodic stuff going on, although Gillan again wrecks it. His voice seems old and tired compared to his earlier Deep Purple stuff, but even the old Ian Gillan would suck with Sabbath. It just wasn\u2019t meant to be, I guess. Everything else about the song is actually quite good, including a powerful chorus, and an interesting part without guitar. But all in all, I can\u2019t really recommend this song for all audiences, because the singing sucks so bad. 5/10\n\n\u201cThe Dark\u201d is another one that doesn\u2019t count, and then comes \u201cZero the Hero\u201d. The Cannibal Corpse cover of this song is better than the original. Number One way to know if you suck: Cannibal Corpse improved your song by covering it. The intro is cool though, with those ominous bells or whatever they are. In my opinion though, this song is Gillan\u2019s most tolerable performance of the album. The chorus is surprisingly sing-a-long-able, and the overall sound of the song is a vast improvement from most of this album. The main driving riff is ultra-metallic sludge, very unlike anything Iommi and Butler had written before. The opening riff, which is repeated later in the song, is probably the best riff on the album, and it definitely has me headbanging. The guitar solo is decent, but too long with not enough ideas. It\u2019s funny because the lyrics are about being mediocre, and sucking at life. Get it? Because the band sucks? It\u2019s too bad this song is actually alright, because the joke doesn\u2019t work as well. Ah well. 7/10\n\n\u201cDigital Bitch\u201d has a sick main riff that is nearly ruined by the shoddy production. And by the shitty singing (are we noticing a trend here?). The chorus is fairly catchy, but gawd what awful lyrics. And Gillan needs to stop trying to do that power metal scream, because he can\u2019t do it. This tries to be a hard rocker of a song, but the band doesn\u2019t quite pull it off. Really, I feel bad for Iommi, Butler and Ward, because most of the song\u2019s (and album\u2019s) problems are not their fault. Meh. 4/10\n\n\u201cBorn Again\u201d is\u2026 *ugh*\u2026 a power ballad. Black Sabbath did just fine their whole career without doing power ballads, so I do not know why they decided to start. Those two chords (i and VII, how original) really start to get annoying after awhile, and the melody just meanders. It feels like Ian Gillan is just making up this stuff as he goes along, words and tune. Did he just say \u201cthe gray and plastic retards\u201d? Frankly I wouldn\u2019t be surprised. Another boooring-ass solo from Iommi, and I\u2019m yawning so wide I think my jaw might unhinge. It is 3:19 AM, but I have a feeling I\u2019d still get tired listening to this during the day. I\u2019ll give it one point for the first few seconds of the chorus, which actually sound decent. 1/10\n\n\u201cHot Line\u201d tries to be a rocker like \u201cVoodoo\u201d or \u201cLady Evil\u201d or something, but of course\u2026 you guessed it! They can\u2019t pull it off! Some more run-of-the-mill instrumentalism, blah blah blah. It gets one point because someone could conceivably do a decent version of this song. Someone else, I mean. 1/10\n\n\u201cKeep It Warm\u201d opens with a decent riff actually. And Gillan sounds decent too! For a few seconds he sings Deep Purple style, but then soon relapses into his wannabe power-metal nonsense. So never mind. This song sucks. I guess I\u2019ll give it a point for the first few seconds of the song, when you think it might be okay. Before you are sorely disappointed. 1/10\n\nThe first 3 songs on Born Again are actually pretty decent. The band wrote a few good songs, and the strength of those is enough to distract me from the bad singing and production. Actually, I\u2019ve talked enough about the singing, and not enough about the production. The production BLOWS. The bass is muddy at best, and inaudible at worst. The drums sound very processed and unnatural, so much that it may as well be a drum machine. And overall, the whole sound is very distant \u2013 you feel like you\u2019re listening to it from far away. So throw in a few more downright shitty songs, with the same problems that plagued the ones that actually had potential. You do the math. (Note: Math already done. See heading.)\n",
        "\nHighlights (songs for Kazaa before buying the album):\nVoodoo\nThe Mob Rules\nFalling Off the Edge of the World\n\n-----\n\nApart from the cover (which is decidedly more gruesome than ever before), Mob Rules is Heaven and Hell Pt. 2 in many ways. The basic sound of the band has not changed a bit since the previous album, although the production has been kicked up a notch, with a more muscular, driving sound.\n\n\u201cTurn Up the Night\u201d opens with a nice groove that unabashedly mimics the opener of the last album, \u201cNeon Knights\u201d. The song is still excellent though, with precise riffing, an interesting melody, and an overall heavy sound. Tony Iommi has some very nice guitar fills in between Dio\u2019s verses, making good use of the wah pedal. Overall, I really enjoy this song, but because it so obviously stagnates (instead of innovating), I\u2019ll give it an 8/10.\n\n\u201cVoodoo\u201d is one of my favorite songs on here, opening with a sick-ass riff, and not letting up until the end of the song. The lyrics and vocal delivery are near perfect, and that riff after the first verse is downright nasty. Geezer\u2019s bass fills are great as usual, but they really stand out in this song. The guitar solo is very inventive, especially compared to most of Iommi\u2019s other playing from this time period. Also, the extreme use of delay and reverb on everything (especially Dio\u2019s voice) gives the song a dreamy atmosphere. \u201cBring me your children, they\u2019ll burn!\u201d This song contains the true spirit of metal, and I give it 10/10 without hesitation.\n\n\u201cThe Sign of the Southern Cross\u201d has an intro that is a straight knockoff of \u201cChildren of the Sea\u201d, and with the epic length and slow tempo of the song, they were definitely going for another \u201cHeaven and Hell\u201d. However, with these points aside, the song is powerful in its own right. Appice\u2019s drumming style actually fits the style of the song better than Ward\u2019s would \u2013 but I\u2019d still rather have Ward back on this album! Dio\u2019s voice in this song is at its strongest, he just takes you by the neck and forces you into submission. The synthesizers are a nice touch, I think. The long, rather pointless \u201ctrippy\u201d section in the middle is the worst part of the song, along with the unexciting guitar solo. \u201cGather all around the young ones, they will make us strong\u2026\u201d It\u2019s a good thing Ronnie comes back in to carry the song home. 8/10\n\n\u201cE5150\u201d is kind of stupid and pointless, although I admit it works as a concert opener. Since it\u2019s not really a song, and it isn\u2019t too long (that rhymes), I won\u2019t count it in the rating. It\u2019s a hell of a lot better than \u201cFX\u201d, that\u2019s all I can say.\n\n\u201cThe Mob Rules\u201d is definitely worthy of its position as the title track. It does everything a fast rocker should do, and has a great anthemic hook. It\u2019s the kind of song that really makes you want to headbang, which is exactly what metal should do! Containing one of the album\u2019s better guitar solos, and with a bold lumbering drum beat, this song easily scores a 10/10 in my book.\n\n\u201cCountry Girl\u201d is certainly an odd title for a metal song, but it\u2019s a hell of a song. Apparently Geezer Butler hated this song, which I don\u2019t quite understand. The riff doesn\u2019t leave him much room for improvisation, but it rocks hard, so fuck \u2018im! This is one of those overlooked album tracks that didn\u2019t get a lot of concert time, but I think it\u2019s still a great song. When the lead guitar comes in after the slow part, it\u2019s orgasmic. Seriously, I just splooged on my computer screen. 9/10\n\n\u201cSlipping Away\u201d sounds like a Led Zeppelin B-side (something from Coda, maybe). That\u2019s not entirely a bad thing; it definitely gives the album some variance, breaking away from the usual sound of the record. The instrumental part in the middle is sheer brilliance, and it\u2019s only flaw is that it\u2019s waaaay too short! The guitar/bass solo should go on for at least twice as long. Overall, the song has a great sound to it, and gets a welcome 9/10.\n\n\u201cFalling Off the Edge of the World\u201d is one of those classic songs that is hidden away at the end of the album, kind of like \u201cDie Young\u201d from Heaven and Hell. After a rather weird intro, the song quickly picks up into a song of epic proportions. It\u2019s actually not that long, but it feels epic nonetheless. When that first doom metal chord comes in, the song sounds like it\u2019s on the brink of greatness, and then when that wild fast riff starts, it achieves greatness. I consider this the best song on the album, and the only one that truly matches the glory of Heaven and Hell. 10/10\n\n\u201cOver and Over\u201d is the album\u2019s weak point. It\u2019s not bad, just not that interesting. Again, it is an obvious rip of a Heaven and Hell song: this time it\u2019s \u201cLonely Is the Word\u201d. It is supposed to be a slow blues song, but the performance isn\u2019t nearly loose enough to work. The band\u2019s tight playing works well on most other numbers, but not here. Vinnie Appice especially sounds like he has a stick up his ass. Why didn\u2019t Bill Ward stick around for this album? I don\u2019t really know, but he should have. Iommi\u2019s obligatory solo doesn\u2019t emotionally wrench you like \u201cLonely\u201d\u2019s did, and overall the song is pretty average. 5/10\n\nIf you don\u2019t have Heaven and Hell, then by all means pick that one up first: this is definitely a not-as-good version of that album. It still has its merits though, and any devoted fan of Sabbath and/or Dio will eat this up (myself included!). Mob Rules is good to listen to once in a while, if you want to hear something like H&H but you need something a little different.\n",
        "\nFirst of all, this album has one of the coolest covers ever. In fact, it is SO cool that Van Halen decided to rip off the idea for their 1984 album. Boo! But seriously, I have a T-shirt of this cover (home-made, of course!) and I think it rocks. Almost as much as the music.\n\n\u201cNeon Knights\u201d \u2013 Aaaah, I\u2019m so glad Sabbath is alive again in 1980. This song is enough to prove that the band was back in action. It starts with a nice fast rocking riff, almost similar to \u201cBack Street Kids,\u201d but without the crappy overproduction. And then, as soon as Ronnie James Dio\u2019s voice hits your speakers, you know this match was meant to be. Dio is undoubtedly one of metal\u2019s greatest vocalists. This does not necessarily mean a recipe for success (see Born Again *shudder*), but here it works perfectly. This song has everything a metalhead could want: abstract, thought-provoking lyrics, atmospheric riffs, and a fast hard beat. Also, the lead in this song is amazing; it really is one of Iommi\u2019s best guitar solos ever. This was my favorite Sabbath song for awhile, and it\u2019s still one of my favorites.\n\n\u201cChildren of the Sea\u201d \u2013 Containing one of the most beautiful intros in all of metal, this song unexpectedly bursts into a brutal sludge fest. It is based mostly on Dio\u2019s melody, instead of the usual dependence on Iommi\u2019s riffs. Of course, the riffs are prominent as usual (especially the opener), and the strengths of both mix together magically. The guitar solo starts out very nicely, with some chorused vocals to back it up, but then ends kind of awkwardly. Iommi seems to want to play as many notes as possible, and since he\u2019s not the fastest guitar player in the world, this makes for a strange sounding solo. But otherwise, this is one of Sabbath\u2019s, and Dio\u2019s, best songs. \u201cIt\u2019s never never never coming back, look out!\u201d\n\n\u201cLady Evil\u201d \u2013 This song makes good use of an excellent mid-paced groove, and incorporates some guitar fills from Iommi that are so badass, it\u2019s not even funny. The chorus is very strong, and very sing-a-long-able. The lyrics are some of Dio\u2019s very best; about, well, you guessed it! An evil lady. And then the solo! In my favorite Iommi solo ever, he uses the wah pedal like it\u2019s never been used before! This song is obviously influenced by Judas Priest (it has that \u201cbad ass\u201d sound to it), but not too heavily that it sounds like a clone. This is entirely Black Sabbath, and yet another highlight of a strong album.\n\n\u201cHeaven and Hell\u201d \u2013 For many, this is the high point of the album, and it certainly is an amazing song. This is an epic in the best way possible; it is loud, heavy, and LONG. Riding a galloping bass riff for much of the beginning, Dio\u2019s voice is in top form here. The contrast between the subdued verses, and the guitar-driven choruses is wonderful. The section with Dio\u2019s chorused vocals is incredible; this is truly what heavy metal is all about. Every single element of this song is amazing! Every riff, every note is perfect. The song also contains possibly one of the greatest, most monumental guitar solos in history, with some awesome use of delay effects. I\u2019m talking about both parts, the slow part, and then the later fast part. The fast part at the end is the ultimate climax, with Bill Ward\u2019s furious drumming, Geezer\u2019s bluesy bass fills, and of course Iommi\u2019s ethereal guitar playing and Dio\u2019s tremendous voice. Ending on a delicate classical guitar piece, this song is the only reason I need for saying that Dio was right for Black Sabbath.\n\n\u201cWishing Well\u201d \u2013 Another great melodic rocker, Geezer Butler stands out particularly in the beginning with his manic bass playing. This song also has magnificent use of acoustic guitar, overlayed onto the distorted electrics. \u201cDream onn\u2026.\u201d Another creative guitar solo, and overall superb playing from this great band.\n\n\u201cDie Young\u201d \u2013 This song sounds a little cheesy at the beginning, but as soon as that first guitar riff comes crashing in, they fully redeem themselves! This is probably the most overlooked song in Sabbath\u2019s entire catalog. Such power is held within the notes of this song! The \u201cOooh!\u201d in the beginning (you know what I\u2019m talking about) sounds so fucking sweet, and the leads are otherworldly. The \u201cmilitary\u201d riff in the middle is insanely good, and leads back perfectly into the song\u2019s refrain. Oh, the magic! If I could listen to only one mix CD for the rest of my life, this song damn well better be on it.\n\n\u201cWalk Away\u201d \u2013 Ok, they had to do it. An attempt at a pop single. Somehow though, it doesn\u2019t sound cheesy or forced, like previous attempts (\u201cChanges,\u201d \u201cAm I Going Insane?\u201d). The song still rocks relatively hard, and has quite a strong melody and structure. The lyrics are a little below the rest of the album\u2019s standards, but overall this is a very good song. Luckily, the style of the song isn\u2019t too much of a departure from the rest of the album. \n\n\u201cLonely Is the Word\u201d \u2013 Allegedly one of Tony Iommi\u2019s personal favorite songs, it\u2019s easy to see why. He had an admitted affection for the blues, and this is bluesy as hell. Also, there is a quite extended solo section that sounds accomplished. The whole song sounds like such a dirge, depressing and heavy the whole way through. This song has an emotive quality that earlier Ozzy Sabbath didn\u2019t have. Instead of sounding creepy or dark, it sounds human in a way never before expressed by Iommi. While it isn\u2019t a highlight of the album, it still is an excellent song, and a great way to close the album. And what could possibly compare to the first batch of songs on this album anyway?\n\nThis is one of my very favorite Black Sabbath albums. Here, in their new refreshed state, they achieve a glory that they hadn\u2019t seen since their Paranoid days. The instrumentation is pulled back a little from the previous few releases, making for a much more guitar-driven record, much like the Black Sabbath of the past. There still is some acoustic guitar, and even synths, but they are restrained. This is a hard, heavy metal album that states clearly what the genre is all about. Not liking this record is like not liking food. It just doesn\u2019t make sense. If you don\u2019t own this already, buy it! Really, it\u2019s one of the best things that ever happened to my CD collection.\n",
        "\nThe best of Black Sabbath needs no introduction. These are truly the best songs, the band put out until that point. The sons from the albums, Black Sabbath, Paranoid, Master of Reality, Vol. 4, and Sabbath Bloody Sabbath. These four excellent albums are summed up into one essential album.\n\nThe album is well organized rightfully beginning with the song Black Sabbath. From that point on, the best songs Sabbath has put out captivate the listener. The indispensable tracks, such as \"War Pigs,\" \"Paranoid,\" and \"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, \" are obviously included on this album, but also, lesser known tracks are put onto the compilation, such as Changes and Sweet Leaf. Also on the remastered, the song Laguna Sunrise is added onto the list, along with Warning and Wicked World. The first two being lesser know than the rest of the tracks.\n\nThis album is a crucial piece of the Black Sabbath discography. I suggest that if you are just getting into Black Sabbath that this is the album for you. If you are a die-hard fan, than you should get the first 5 albums first then get the best of, as it sums up the general atmosphere that Black Sabbath is known for, exceptionally well. This album is very well organized and the songs that were chosen are very worthy to be on this album. Some of the weaker songs are \u201cLaguna Sunrise\u201d and \u201cChanges.\u201d They are not as classic as the remainder of the tracks. This is the best of, and surely deserves the praise that it receives.\n",
        "\nThe second classic by Black Sabbath is just as required as the first album. It is just as classic yet offers a very different \u2018cup of tea.\u2019 It is probably just as influential as the first album while providing a much different approach musically and lyrically. The first track proves the different approach that Black Sabbath took on this album.\n\nStarting off with \u201cWar Pigs/ Luke\u2019s Wall,\u201d it is a much faster opening track than the previous album\u2019s \u201cBlack Sabbath.\u201d Although still a bit slow it does offer more of a melody and much more diversity in the sound. More riffs and melody are how this album differs from the first one. Songs such as \u201cParanoid,\u201d demonstrate the faster paced characteristic of Black Sabbath that the first album has but only scraped upon. \n\nThe intended filler, \u201cParanoid,\u201d has become the most revered Sabbath song amongst many fans. The song is perhaps one of the most memorable songs in Metal and therefore has a very high replay value. It is very difficult to describe this song, even though I have heard it countless amounts of times. It is pretty useless as well, as pretty much every Metal fan has heard this song as well.\n\nNow I\u2019m not a big fan of songs that don\u2019t fit into the overall feel and represent the overall atmosphere that the album brings about, but the third song, \u201cPlanet Caravan,\u201d is one of my favorite songs that hold such characteristics. This is what I see when I listen to this song:\n\n\u201cAt night, my caravan and I are wandering about the Mid-American desert and it is getting cold, we stop and create a fire in order to keep warm. I unfold my Indian rug and rest it on the rough soil below me. The moon is over me as I lay back and gaze upon the infinite stars that populate the night sky. A coyote howls in the distance as I roast a rabbit above the open fire. I place Paranoid into my Cd-payer, fast forward to the third track and fall asleep to the knowledge that I am living in never-ending bliss.\u201d\n\nAtmosphere!!! Oh the Atmosphere that this album incites is indescribable. This is what makes this album such a great listen. From the first to the last track atmosphere and lyrical and musical genius captivate the listener\u2019s interest. Nothing else matter when I listen to this album. The world might be coming to an end, yet I will have this in my stereo till Judgment day.\n\nThe underrated tracks would be track five and six, \u201cElectric Funeral\u201d and \u201cHand of Doom,\u201d respectively are great songs that don\u2019t get as much attention as \u201cParanoid\u201d or \u201cIron Man,\u201d even though they are great songs that have much to offer. Both of the songs encompass the slower and faster attributes of the Black Sabbath sound and the tempo interchange is done perfectly and doesn\u2019t contain a repetitive feeling to the songs.\n\nThe concluding track is a very fine selection. A better tack, in my opinion, would have been \u201cPlanet Caravan,\u201d just because of the atmosphere it creates and would add a great \u2018fade out\u2019 feel to the album. No big deal, as it is a grand track for a classic album. Great lyrics and riffs, but most of all great drum work by Bill Ward. Tony Iommi and Bill Ward create a perfect melody that is very adequate to the overall impression that the album portrays.\n\nThis is the album that has introduced me to Heavy Metal music. Righteously so it was one of the greatest albums that I have heard. For every fan of Metal, this is the album for you. Your Metal journey will not be complete without this marvel of an album in your collection. Listen to it, love it and bow before the genius that is Black Sabbath\u2019s Paranoid.\n",
        "\nThis is the record that is proclaimed by many, to have started Heavy Metal music. The historic importance of this album cannot even be conceived, as it is probably the most important album in the metal discography.\n\nRighteously so, the first song is entitled \u201cBlack Sabbath.\u201d It is a very powerful song, with a mellow, yet controlling sound. It is simple lyrically yet complex in many ways and unhurried musically but heavy as hell. With a constant sound the lyrics are being spoken more than they are being sung. The progression from the Doom Metal sound to a faster paced guitar sound is very well done and offers a pleasurable experience.\n\nThe title track is probably the most important track on the album as it defines the bands sound for years to come. The overall feel and atmosphere of the album, but especially the title track, is unquestionably something that for many years has gone unduplicated until the late 80\u2019s with the introduction of Black Metal into the Metal world.\n\nThe album truly redefined the genre of rock music in the late 1960\u2019s as it added a dark vibe and an \u201cevil\u201d side to rock & roll. Songs such as \u201cN.I.B.\u201d were unthinkable to be played on the radio in an era where morality was the question of wrong and right even more so than it is today. Even though the album is a gem of creativity it was a very under appreciated album. Times have passed and fans everywhere are still listening to this album, just as in 1969. It is truly a classic among Metal albums and should be owned by anyone that calls himself or herself a Metal enthusiast.\n\nPart of this album displays the Doom Metal characteristic of early Black Sabbath albums and the other display faster paced, high-pitched guitar melodies which enhance the replay value of this album. The song \u201cWicked World,\u201d which is also the underrated song from the album is an example of the faster paced trait that the band demonstrates throughout this album.\n\nThe pure historic value of this album deserves a 100% score, yet, musically; it is not a perfect album. All of the songs are remarkably done and are very memorable, yet they are not perfect. For example the fourth track gets a bit recurring after a while, not in any major way, such as Cannibal Corpse, but does get dull when almost the same riff is being played with a high pitched guitar, over and over again. The guitar solos are great, don\u2019t get me wrong, but it does get a bit monotonous after a while. It\u2019s not a totally bad thing, but it\u2019s not the greatest of things either.\n\nOverall this album is a classic among classics. There is no way that one can truly appreciate Metal music without hearing this album. Very memorable and very powerful are the best adjectives that I can use to describe this album. Black Sabbath has created something extraordinary AND YOU WILL BOW BEFORE IT!\n",
        "\nNever Say Die! isn\u2019t the same tripe-filled bore fest that Technical Ecstasy is, but it\u2019s not exactly terrific, either. Instead of saving their one standout song until the end, they hit you with it upfront. So basically, instead of leaving you on a positive note, they have you listen through the whole album wondering \u201cwhen\u2019s the next good song?\u201d until \u201cSwinging the Chain\u201d just leaves you depressed and having to take a shit. But hell, let\u2019s talk about the title track! It is one mighty good song if you ask me, and certainly one of the highlights of the later Ozzy years of Black Sabbath. Its main driving riff is a LITTLE too close for comfort to Thin Lizzy\u2019s \u201cThe Boys Are Back in Town,\u201d but I can look the other way, due to the awesome nature of the song. A strong melody, a well-grounded structure, and a killer guitar solo at the end \u2013 it\u2019s great even when he goes \u201cnever say diiiiiieeeee\u201d at the end! I love this freakin\u2019 song.\n\n\u201cJohnny Blade\u201d is a decent song, although not up to the standard set by the title track. It seems that Sabbath has somewhat regained their ability to ride a nice groove, probably due to the easing up of synths on this album in general. This isn\u2019t the greatest thing in the world, but it\u2019s good to see something good come out of this band before they break up (the following year). The lyrics, while not up to the usual Sabbath standard, are at least interesting (about something you can actually understand and follow).\n\n\u201cJunior\u2019s Eyes\u201d is next, not really offering much variation in terms of the flow of the album, but still an enjoyable song. It sounds pretty much like the song before it, which is a definite negative. Also, the riffs can be a little dry at times, and the performance certainly isn\u2019t as spot-on as earlier Sabbath. However, I do enjoy listening to this song, and I would be proud of it if I had written it. It\u2019s just that I tend to hold Black Sabbath to a higher standard than I hold myself. \n\n\u201cA Hard Road\u201d was one of the intended singles of the album (along with the title track), and ironically it starts to drag the album down a little. It starts out quite nicely, with a bluesy guitar riff and a decent melody. There are a few problems with this song, though: first of all, the lyrics are atrocious. They are pure clich\u00e9, nothing but tripe. The other major problem is that it is way too repetitive, and by the end you\u2019re just like, \u201cShut up already!\u201d And also, I could do without Bill Ward\u2019s backing vocals.\n\n\u201cShock Wave\u201d is another song, pretty much like the others. I feel like I\u2019m repeating myself, but it has everything the other songs have: bad lyrics, decent but flat riffs, and a definite cheesy overtone. By this time, I\u2019m getting a little tired of listening to the album, and I could still do without Bill Ward\u2019s backing vocals.\n\n\u201cAir Dance\u201d is the song that regains my attention after the first few same-y songs. Opening with a delicious dual guitar riff, it quickly turns into a soft, jazzy ballad with piano. The piano here actually complements the song, rather than bogging it down (like EVERY other time they have used piano in the past). And there is some sick power metal shit in the middle there. I\u2019ve got to admit, I wholeheartedly enjoy this song, down to the final synth-filled fadeout. It shows that the band was still trying to branch out and try new creative things, even at this late, tired stage in their career.\n\n\u201cOver to You\u201d - *yaaawwwn* Yep, this song sucks the big one. I don\u2019t know what killed it \u2013 Ozzy\u2019s annoying vocals, the blatantly bad guitar riffs, or the incessant overproduction. Whatever it was, the song turned out to be a stinker.\n\nWhat the hell is \u201cBreakout\u201d??? If they mean to break out of the mold, I guess they succeeded, but it\u2019s still a pretty awful song. I cannot possibly understand the motive behind creating this song. \u201cLet\u2019s make a song with horns in it!\u201d Well fine, that\u2019s a swell idea, but first you have to WRITE A SONG!!! There is really nothing good I can say about this song, except maybe that they tried to make something different. This really is nails on a chalkboard.\n\n\u2026Well folks, if you thought \u201cBreakout\u201d was bad, wait till you hear \u201cSwinging the Chain\u201d! Bill Ward sings this song, poorly. The riffs aren\u2019t *terrible*, but they definitely have a high cheese factor. And those falsetto screams are atrocious. What was he thinking? This song sounds like Deep Purple on crack. No, not on crack \u2013 in the hospital with brain cancer. Actually, I\u2019m sorry I even brought Deep Purple into this. When he sings \u201cWe\u2019re so sorry that it happened that way,\u201d I feel like he\u2019s apologizing for how bad the song is. Ugh.\n\nOverall, Never Say Die! is a little better than its predecessor Technical Ecstasy, but not by much. \u201cAir Dance\u201d and the title track are truly worthy of the Black Sabbath title, but the rest of the album ranges from mediocre to unlistenable. I would recommend this album only if you really NEED all the Sabbath albums. Otherwise, just download the two songs worth hearing. I hate to endorse illegal activity, but this album fucking deserves it.\n",
        "\nMeh. This album is just a meh. I can\u2019t wholeheartedly decry it, because it has its moments, but on the whole it is a pretty boring listen. Take, for example, the leadoff track, \u201cBack Street Kids.\u201d The band is obviously going for a more pop-oriented approach, with the synths and the upbeat tempo. I don\u2019t immediately discredit it for this, but the songwriting is pretty bad. The tune is flat and unemotional, and the lyrics are just really stupid. Black Sabbath never had the greatest lyrics, but this is just bad. The guitar solo in the end is all right I guess, but a lot of the time it just seems like he\u2019s trying to play really fast, and the individual notes aren\u2019t very thought out. There\u2019s nothing about this song I really object to, but it\u2019s not really too hot either. \n\n\u201cYou Won\u2019t Change Me\u201d \u2013 Booooriiiing. Supposed to be one of their trademark bluesy, snail paced riffs, but it just doesn\u2019t work. A horrible synthesizer riff drives much of the song, and the words again are ridiculous. I don\u2019t know what happened between the last album and this, but it wasn\u2019t good. \n\nThey let Bill Ward sing a song a few years back with \u201cSolitude,\u201d and it wasn\u2019t that great. So, they gave him another shot. Well, \u201cIt\u2019s Alright\u201d is\u2026 alright. It definitely has a higher production value than the aforementioned, with the piano and strings. However, the song itself pretty much sucks. It\u2019s a cheesy ballad, and I thought they learned their lesson after \u201cChanges.\u201d Cheesy ballads don\u2019t work for Black Sabbath.\n\n\u201cGypsy\u201d is a little better. After the initial drum-driven verse, they lock into a nice little groove, something we haven\u2019t heard yet on this record. The song is too drawn out, though, and it seems like they just added in extra sections to make it longer. Poor organization is the major problem here, as they have some decent musical ideas. This is, sadly, one of the album\u2019s best songs.\n\n\u201cAll Moving Parts (Stand Still)\u201d \u2013 Okay, what the hell is with the disco thing? We already had to deal with \u201cAm I Going Insane\u201d on the previous album, which was borderline. At least that had the strength of its songwriting, and some powerful vocals. This song has neither. \u201cTeacher\u2019s burned the school / He\u2019s had enough of sticking to the rules\u2026\u201d This is just ridiculously bad. Apart from its bad lyrics and bad disco beat, the song is listenable, although nothing special. We\u2019re still waiting for that knockout song that will surprise us and fill us with joy.\n\n\u201cRock and Roll Doctor\u201d is horrendous. This is the worst attempt at a pop hit I think the band ever came with out. It\u2019s supposed to be some sort of Southern rock bluesy boogie type of thing. And yes, it has cowbell. That\u2019s not why it\u2019s bad. It\u2019s bad because Black Sabbath doesn\u2019t do boogie rock. And never should.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s Gone\u201d is the low point of the album, which is quite a feat. It is so fucking lame. Talk about cheeeeeese. Ozzy, you are such a douche bag. And the rest of the band, how could you let him make this stupid-ass song? \u201cOoooh, my baby!\u201d Yeah, shut the fuck up.\n\nOkay, FINALLY. A DECENT SONG!! If the whole album were as good as \u201cDirty Women,\u201d I would have a much different opinion of it. This song rocks, and I\u2019m not afraid to admit it. It tells a story about Ozzy and how horny he is, and how he lusts for a hooker. It actually works better than it sounds! At about 1:54 the song goes from being pretty good, to damn fucking awesome. What a riff! It definitely has a more 80s sound than earlier Black Sabbath, but here they use it to their advantage, instead of being shitty. And when he goes \u201cOh, dirty women / They don\u2019t mess around!\u201d he actually has conviction in his voice (just like the old days!), and the guitar solo over the ending fadeout is the best on the album by far. I knew you had it in you, guys!\n\nSo if you are a hardcore Black Sabbath fan, you probably have this. If you are not, avoid this. If you don\u2019t have this yet, but you lust for more Black Sabbath past the first 6 albums, get Heaven and Hell, but you might want this also. Get it at least for \u201cDirty Women,\u201d you don\u2019t have to listen to the rest of the album.\n",
        "\nDehumanizer reminds me of a really, really fat man. When the fat guy is walking, running even, it\u2019s immensely entertaining to watch because you get the sense of all this weight moving, swinging plunging and indeed rippling in ways God never intended. However, when said fat guy just sits there though, he just wallows and bores the hell out of whoever is watching because their ain\u2019t nothing to do except to watch with morbid fascination and try to guess when it\u2019ll collapse under it\u2019s own weight. Dehumanizer is like that fat man friends, because it is an album possessing ridiculous density and weight (but not true doom) but a lack of drive and inspiration.\n\nThe word \u2018ponderous\u2019 was coined for albums like this. On every Sabbath album there are slow songs (\u201cBlack Sabbath\u201d, \u201cHeaven and Hell\u201d), mid-tempo songs (\u201cInto the Void\u201d, \u201cFairies Wear Boots\u201d), and songs that do some pretty brisk business (\u201cThe Mob Rules\u201d, \u201cSymptom of the Universe\u201d), but here the album seems shrouded in a hazy fog in which a bunch of immovable objects reside with no hope of an unstoppable force to upset their mouldering and slow petrifaction. There are islands of hope in this sea of muck, including one track I consider a classic, but even amongst these few measure up to even mid-rangers from Sabbath\u2019s early catalogue (both the Ozzy and Dio years, hell even the first two Martins) and so Dehumanizer is little more than a footnote, a good anecdote when telling the whole sordid Black Sabbath story to a newcomer to this massive coven.\n\nDehumanizer, along with the other two studio records, really suggests that Dio is really in charge of the band to a degree most wouldn\u2019t guess. Consider that Heaven and Hell and Mob Rules are much more Rainbow/Dio than Black Sabbath records, the HaH tracks particularly being of a make and model that wouldn\u2019t be out of place on either a fictional Dio-fronted post-Long Live Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll Rainbow project, or a long lost pre-Holy Diver Dio record. Dehumanizer apes the Dio records that bookend it in the same way, the change in sound from Lock up the Wolves through Dehumanizer to Strange Highways not being particularly jarring.\n\nThe similarities of this trio of records are not hard to see, big wallowing riffs and Ronnie trying to focus on more \u2018mature\u2019 themes, as well as using the same (or very similar) vocal melodies on every damn song. Listen close to \u201cAfter All (The Dead)\u201d (or \u201cStrange Highways\u201d even) and you\u2019ve got the idea, a thickening up of the song \u201cDream Evil\u201d stretched over a whole album, Ronnie crooking his finger at you and snarling in a more snarly fashion than usual. One or two of these songs per album are good, an infusion of vein-coagulating red meat, but it gets to the point where you just lay there and let this roll off you back and mostly can\u2019t remember a damn thing about what just happened.\n\nHowever, there are some breaks in the mediocrity. \u201cMaster of Insanity\u201d starts out like a Sound of Perseverance-era Death track, some very tricky-sounding rhythm-section fireworks before launching into a great stomping mid-tempo crunch with an unconventional and aurally pleasing chorus, Dio leaving the \u201cto eleven!\u201d growl behind for a few minutes. It\u2019s great how the solo actually has some build-up too, restrained wankery if you will. There is a ballad (\u201cToo Late\u201d) that isn\u2019t going to give \u201cFalling Off the Edge of the World\u201d a run for it\u2019s money, but at least it gives your mind a break from the sludgy non-event \u201cTime Machine\u201d and the back half of \u201cSins of the Father\u201d. \u201cComputer God\u201d, like the best tracks from Dio\u2019s other \u2018heavier-than-thou\u2019 records, manages to make the wallowing work by making it only a small part of the song, slowly creaking open the door to a labyrinthine power drumfest and some really nice guitar work throughout that belies Tony\u2019s age. The best track in my opinion is among the more conventional, \u201cI\u201d a great rebellious fist pumper that pounds the floor and gives one of the albums very few shout along chorus opportunities, and also the giggle-factor of Dio proclaiming \u201cI\u2019m a whore\u201d in his most metallic call-to-arms style.\n\nHowever these highlights (in the case of \u201cToo Late\u201d, minor breaks in the monotony) are tempered by the sheer suffocating boredom songs like \u201cAfter All (The Dead)\u201d, \u201cLetters from Earth\u201d, and \u201cTime Machine\u201d (twice!), songs that remind you that Dio, Butler (the G//Z/R project), Appice (WWIII with Tracy G), and Iommi were all in one of the most sludgy reactionary \u2018more metal than metal\u2019 phases of their careers, like one giant shared mid-life crisis from hell that further buried their collective reputations (arguably Dio\u2019s uber-heavy records are an exception) under a surge of fat riffs and subterranean (when existent) grooves. So yeah, Dehumanizer has highlights (\u201cI\u201d, \u201cTV Crimes\u201d, \u201cMaster of Insanity\u201d, and \u201cComputer God\u201d) but a few songs don\u2019t make a record, they can only heroically attempt to salvage it, and this album is lurching , battery-drained proof of that.\n\nHighlights: \u201cI\u201d, \u201cMaster of Insanity\u201d, \u201cComputer God\u201d\n",
        "\nYes, yes - As already pointed out, Sabbath was pioneers, and did undoubtedly forge the metal genre as it is today, so I'll restrain from praising them in that sense. Heh. \n\nNo, my main point when it comes to MoR is how it really shows the thing that made Black Sabbath so incredibly great in my eyes - Their way of handling musical contrast. From the droning grooves of \"Sweet Leaf\" and \"After Forever\" to the short, (and from this album on, traditional) acoustic Iommi-guitar leads, \"Embryo\" and \"Orchid\". From the relentless galloping pace of \"Children of the Grave\" to the static riffing in \"Lord of This World\" and on to the soothingly and incredibly beautiful \"Solitude\". \n\nAnd right there I'd like to state a point. \"Solitude\" is one of my favourite songs ever. Not my favourite Sabbath song, och my favourite \"soft\" Sabbath song, but one of the songs that has affected me more than most things in life has. Maybe it's just because it has an personal meaning for me, but then again, it is an incredible song. Ozzy shows off his range as a vocalist, proving everybody wrong who said he could't sing - And everything instrumental is just perfect. The eerie flutes, guitars and pianos creates an athmosphere uncompelled in any song I've ever heard. It gives me images of a very suicidal person, sitting in a misty forest, bleak and misguided by love, ready to take his life. Chilling. beautiful and brilliant.\n\nAnd if we get back to contrast, could there be a better way to break that bleak and foggy cloud that is \"Solitude\" by kicking off the beast that is \"Into the Void\"? A song which feels like it's built up into three phases, each one getting on top of the other when it comes to heavy riffing. \nThe perfect closer on the album.\n\nSo? What then? How do I rank it? Well, It may sound harsh after such and total fanboy praisal as the one above, but I have to place Master of Reality as number three on my list of Sabbath Records... I hate to even think of placing them on a list, but if I have to, It'll be number three. \n\"Paranoid\" is still undisputed nr. 1, and \"Sabotage\" is a very good second. \nMoR is definately among them, one of the best records ever, without a doubt.\n",
        "\n...and here is where Sabbath pulls off the greatest trick in their grim metal existence, (seemingly) effortlessly switching singers without skipping a beat, in fact vastly improving themselves when all is said and done and dragging themselves from the mire of Technical Ecstasy (essentially the overblown logical conclusion to the train of thought proposed by Sabbath Bloody Sabbath and Sabotage) and Never Say Die (uninspired wastrel of a record) to a new metal plateau once more at the forefront of the genre.\n\nThis is a totally new Sabbath, nimble and forceful to a degree that belies their years, this looming maturity and new-found zest for life leaving virtually everything else released in the year 1980 in the dust, smoking the NWOBHM, steamrolling the new simplified Priest, really only AC/DC's landmark \"Back in Black\" and Ozzy's \"Blizzard of Ozz\" (honourable mention: the first Maiden) matching it's longevity and quality.\n\nIt's also a Sabbath tired of experimentation, more concerned with making a shiny, rock-solid album that will bring them back to prominence and succeeding unreservedly.\n\nHeaven and Hell hits the back of the net at least five times on this one, and though one song could be called a stumble (\"Walk Away\") it's engulfed in the sheer brilliance of the rest. \"Die Young\", \"Lonely is the Word\", \"Children of the Sea\", \"Neon Knights\", and high upon high title track \"Heaven and Hell\" are in that rarified class of pure musical genius, all five easily finding their way into the top one or two hundred rock songs ever released in my book.\n\nThis album is great for many reasons, all of which are centered on the band. Tony Iommi is writing light-years away from Sabbath and ahead in time, pre-power metal derived more from Purple and Rainbow than anything else and also with a real epic feeling that Sabbath had never had, even on their considerable epics like \"The Writ\" and \"War Pigs\", a feel of cinematic scope that was the realm of basically Priest, Rainbow, and a burgeoning Maiden alone and screaming in the night (okay, Purple, Heep, and particularly Zeppelin did contribute quite a bit to this field as well) that this is the way metal SHOULD feel. Ward is tight as a drum (ironically) despite his horribly wasted state, more of a standard time-keeping player than the progressive drumming monster last seen on Sabotage. Bill Ward is as dynamic as ever sporadically, like Ward more inside the box (probably something to do with Ronnie's writing) but just amazing within the confines of a normal band. Last but not least, the short little feller filling in for the Ozz is a breath of fresh air, Dio being an obviously more talented singer and a writer and a half, his usual magic making this band more Rainbow than Sabbath, more modern than retro, more brilliant than ever.\n\nThis album would be worth it for the title track alone, probably my favourite song ever, out of all styles and all times. There's no use talking about the thespian grandeur of it all, the incredible slow-build and the level of BAM!-connection that is instantaneous and unshakeable. In short, it's the crowning classic of both the Sabbath catalogue and the rock genre entirely, that's how much I fucking love the song.\n\n\"Lonely is the Word\" is the most insistently metallic track on the album, otherworldly soloing powerful vocals, and most pertinently a raw scraping guitar tone that cuts the ear and wrings the neck. \"Die Young\" is emotional and unconventional speed metal, the soulful (!) vocals of RJD in the slow break and the passion of Iommi's playing lifting this soaring and piercing speedster into the pantheon and above the whole wallowing power metal genre struggling to reach this high and be this damn good. \"Neon Knights\" is like a cleaned up \"Symptom of the Universe\" or \"Kill the King\" (Rainbow) part 2, hyper and clean with some amazing soloing from Tony and catchier-than-thou melodies up the wazoo.\n\nOkay enough, I don't want to repeat the obvious. If you want more (and why wouldn't you...), e-mail me or something and I'll talk your ear off about this or any other album I've reviewed and a good many I've yet to. Suffice to say, Heaven and Hell is the last Sabbath classic (there are a few more good ones to go though) and maybe just shy of being the best damn thing they or anyone else ever recorded. Just buy the damned thing, it's essential Dio, Dio at his best, and also Dio in the middle of quite possibly the greatest hot-streak in metal history.\n",
        "\nSabbath\u2026 Bloody\u2026 Fucking\u2026 Sabbath! This album did so many things for heavy metal. No longer was heavy metal only about power chords, plodding drum beats, and rocking you nonstop. The textures and the subtleties on this album are leagues ahead of their time. The acoustic guitars, flutes, crazy percussion, they all come together to form Black Sabbath\u2019s crowning achievement: Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, motherfucker. Bow down and worship this recording, because otherwise you don\u2019t fucking deserve to live. This album humbles the best of us, and enlightens the worst of us.\n\nSabbath Bloody Sabbath, the song, is first on the tracklist here, and damn, son. This is Black Sabbath\u2019s greatest song ever, and if you don\u2019t agree, then you\u2019re just\u2026 wrong! There\u2019s nothing else to it. With those opening VI-VII-i chords, and Ozzy\u2019s maniacal voice (which is better than ever before), the band practically invented power metal. Then the acoustic guitars come in, and they change the face of metal again. Oh man, what a song. You thought that was enough? No way, man. You think the song is about to wind down, and in comes a crushing sludge riff that is heavier than the heaviest modern band. So far ahead of its time, it\u2019s amazing. And the song as a whole is just awe-inspiring. Lock any Mormon in a room with this song turned up to volume 10, and I guarantee they\u2019ll come out worshiping Satan. This is some pretty powerful stuff.\n\nA National Acrobat is probably my favorite Sabbath song. It doesn\u2019t have the monumental leap of the title track, but it just kicks so much ass. It opens with one of Sabbath\u2019s sickest grooves, and then in comes one of the universe\u2019s sickest guitar harmonies. The lyrics are top notch, although very abstract. The words Ozzy sings are perfectly fitting to the evil music underneath, and the entire experience of this song is definitely \u201cevil.\u201d This is some bad-ass heavy metal, and a masterpiece of a song. The whole funky middle part is wah-licious, and the whole instrumental part at the end is killer. And I love the ending! Two guitars climbing and climbing in a jumble of notes, reaching that final note to close the song as awesomely as possible.\n\nFluff is Tony Iommi\u2019s best instrumental. Embryo and Orchid sucked, Laguna Sunrise was good but too repetitive, but Fluff really hits the spot. A good part of its greatness comes from the production, which is lush as hell, with a lot of different instruments, including piano, harpsichord, and acoustic guitar. This song was created entirely for atmosphere, and it works so good. It makes you want to float away on a cloud. Or maybe on a giant piece of fluff.\n\nProbably the heaviest flat-out love song ever written, Sabbra Cadabra is also an optimum dose of the Sabbath experience. Based on a loose blues tempo, the song rocks in a way that a lot of Sabbath songs don\u2019t. It swings, and it swings hard. Well, except for the synthesizer-blast part. But that\u2019s cool in its own way! The outro jam is so loose and funky, it makes me want to get up and dance. And I\u2019m not one to usually dance.\n\nAnd then just when you think you\u2019ve heard it all, they decide to throw in Killing Yourself to Live, the most technically advanced, multi-sectioned Sabbath composition to date. This song is just another testament to how the band can be both brutally heavy, yet magnificently epic in scope. And of course, it contains a great message for all the kids: \u201cSmoke it! Get high!\u201d accompanied by inhaling noises. Nice.\n\n\u201cWho Are You?\u201d \u2013 ok, this song is fucking weird as hell. Nobody could have expected this in 1973. This is synthesizer OVERKILL, but strangely it works. The main part of the song is downright evil, and you don\u2019t even notice the fact that there isn\u2019t any guitar in the whole song. I\u2019ve heard this song covered a few times, and all of them SUCKED majorly. Only Black Sabbath can pull this kind of weird-ass song off, and I really like it.\n\n\u201cLooking for Today\u201d \u2013 This song is decidedly \u201chappier\u201d than the rest of the album, although the band continues to experiment with different sounds and instruments. I must admit, the flute does not seem out of place at all, it fits in very nicely. The main drum beat is very cool, I think Bill Ward uses brushes. This song is not very Sabbath-y, but it is a very strong song, and a welcome addition to this great album.\n\n\u201cSpiral Architect\u201d \u2013 What a song. What a fucking song. This is one of Black Sabbath\u2019s wildest experiments, and I consider it their greatest. It sounds so entirely epic, but it really isn\u2019t that long, not even 6 minutes. What is it about this song that makes it so powerful? It could be the lush string section, or the spacey guitar chords, or the wailing vocals\u2026 but it\u2019s probably a mixture of all those. This is a great close to an even greater album, and that final string part is just mind blowing.\n\nSabbath Bloody Sabbath is my favorite Black Sabbath album, and I also want to call it their greatest, but I just can\u2019t\u2026 the glorious Paranoid takes the cake on that one. But even so, this is the album where Sabbath proved that they weren\u2019t just playing heavy metal anymore, they were creating art. The world is a better place for this album, and if you don\u2019t like it, then you have serious issues.\n",
        "\nThe fourth volume of Black Sabbath songs doesn\u2019t disappoint. The production is obviously a bit more expensive than before, which is a trend the band would continue to follow into next few years. The music itself is top notch Sabbathry, starting with the monumental \u201cWheels of Confusion.\u201d The opening bit of this song has a brand new, psychedelic quality that launches me into a different universe (in which I remain for the rest of the album). When Ozzy says \u201c\u2026in the land of fairy tales and stories,\u201d that is the moment when you know for sure that you are in for a ride. Nothing has really changed about the way Black Sabbath plays, but it still sounds so fucking good. It is also commendable that they start the album off with an epic 8-minute masterpiece, which is definitely not radio-friendly. I think that\u2019s a bold move, because it\u2019s going to turn off anyone who doesn\u2019t like metal. Sucks for those losers. But regardless, this song is a brilliantly constructed metal symphony that continues where the band left off with Master of Reality, still pushing those boundaries of heavy metal. This song is most representative of the creative advancement in this album, I think.\n\n\u201cTomorrow\u2019s Dream\u201d shows very well that the band can still play shorter length, more pop-oriented metal songs in the vein of Paranoid. And while this song is maybe not quite as good as Paranoid, it comes damn close. Starting out with a bold, mid-paced, stooooned riff, the song simply rides along, fueled by the immense talent of the band members. Best part: \u201c\u2026and let tomorrow\u2019s dream / become reality to MEEEEEEE\u2026\u201d Oh man, this shit is so good.\n\n\u201cChanges\u201d is the inevitable attempt at a pop hit, and I\u2019m going to assume it was a failure, because it sucks. It is a piano-based ballad with mellotron and bass, but no guitar or drums. I don\u2019t really MIND it that much, except that it is intensely boring. The lyrics are nothing but clich\u00e9s, and there are long passages where the background instruments just play without vocals, resulting in a pretty tedious listen if you ask me. The album loses points for this one. It\u2019s too bad, because there\u2019s some strong stuff on the rest of the record; it\u2019s a shame throwing a stinker like this in to slow it down.\n\n\u201cFX\u201d is pointless filler. It\u2019s probably supposed to mess with you when you\u2019re high, but I can tell you it doesn\u2019t even really do that very well. Guitar effects have advanced so much in the last 30 years that DELAY isn\u2019t making my jaw drop. I\u2019m glad it\u2019s short.\n\nWell it\u2019s about time they picked things up around here after tracks 3 and 4, and they do that quite nicely with \u201cSupernaut,\u201d a fast rocker that is based on a strong, almost sing-songy main riff. The verse riff is very creative, using a seventh chord and a lot of sliding around on that sixth string (which is dropped to D flat). The middle section is mostly percussion, along with some acoustic guitar, and it just ROCKS the hell out of you. And then when the main riff comes crashing back in, it\u2019s like, \u201cDamn!\u201d It sounds like it\u2019s about tripping. Why am I not surprised?\n\n\u201cSnowblind\u201d is a bona fide metal classic, and one of my favorite Sabbath songs. Slowing things down a bit from \u201cSupernaut,\u201d the band is in their full glory here. Bill Ward stands out on this track actually, with his light strokes and rolls that carry the song along in a very stable groove. Also notable is the oddly syncopated fast part in the middle, with a rhythm that would be directly imitated by many future metal bands. \u201cCocaine\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cCornucopia\u201d is a shorter song, and this is where the album starts to feel a little same-y and dare I say it, formulaic. Don\u2019t get me wrong: the song rocks like a mofo, but it doesn\u2019t really bring anything new to the album, it simply uses elements from the rest of the songs. Everything about it is good, however, and it does well as a hard rocking album track.\n\n\u201cLaguna Sunrise\u201d is a sequel of sorts to Master of Reality\u2019s \u201cEmbryo\u201d and \u201cOrchid.\u201d It is a guitar-based instrumental that works really well, compared to the mundane instrumentals on the previous album. It is a tad repetitive, but that is a small complaint \u2013 this really is a good song, and a surprising one too. The string section manages to NOT be cheesy, which is amazing after hearing \u201cChanges.\u201d\n\n\u201cSt. Vitus Dance\u201d is a throwaway filler song, but it is still pretty good. It is notable for having a significant part in a major key, which is unheard of in Black Sabbath country. As a whole, the song is not the best in the world, but it still works as a near-the-end-of-the-album song.\n\n\u201cUnder the Sun\u201d is another deathly slow number, which I like a lot. However, it suffers from the same difficulty as the rest of the songs on the second side of this album: it just sounds the same. Taken on its own though, it is a very good song, in the same vein as much of their previous work. The ending is spectacular, where they repeat a riff a bunch of times, slowing down dramatically each time, until the song finally ends with a *thunk*. This song is a good note to end the album on, and the \u201cEvery Day Comes and Goes\u201d part in the middle is pretty sick, too.\n\nThe album could have used some work, some of the songs toward the end sound uninspired or under-rehearsed, but at least half the album is pure classic Sabbath material. This is some of the best heavy metal ever made, so sacrifice a goat to this album! You can skip \u201cChanges\u201d if necessary.\n",
        "\n*cough cough* Upon listening to Master of Reality, it is immediately apparent that this album is a darker, heavier affair than the first 2 Black Sabbath albums. The guitars are dropped 3 steps on every string, and the mix is much sludgier. This, of course, is a good thing; it is one of the band\u2019s all time best records. The opening riff of \u201cSweet Leaf\u201d was the band\u2019s loosest, most stoned groove to date, and it was probably the first popular song ever to be a flat-out tribute to smoking the ganj. Ozzy\u2019s voice is in top form as he expresses his undying love for marijuana, and the band sounds equally confident. All 3 instrumentalists are noticeably improved since Paranoid, and Bill Ward in particular has a furious drum segment in the middle of the song. This music is more Sabbathy than ever before, and damn it\u2019s good.\n\n\u201cAfter Forever\u201d starts with an ominous synthesizer, but soon unfolds into an upbeat, major-key guitar riff. This song is downright happier than anything else they had recorded at the time, and Ozzy especially sounds more confident than ever as he shouts out his lyrics. This song is about Christianity, but it isn\u2019t really praising God as much as it is deriding those who don\u2019t praise God. The words must have been shocking to those people at the time who thought the band was all about devil worship or whatnot. Regardless of whether I personally agree with the message of the song, I have to say that it sounds absolutely great. Some more monster riffs that only Iommi and Butler could have come up with, and good interplay between the two of them in the beginning sequence. This is another song that is simply fun to listen to, and that is what Sabbath is all about.\n\n\u201cEmbryo\u201d is kind of weird because it seems very unpracticed. It is a clean guitar solo piece written by Tony Iommi, but he messes up and stuff. But it\u2019s only 28 seconds long, so I\u2019ll give him a break.\n\nAnd now we come to \u201cChildren of the Grave,\u201d what many consider to be not only the highlight of the album, but also one of the very best early Sabbath songs. It is probably the darkest song ever to come out of this era for Sabbath, with the possible exception of \u201cInto the Void.\u201d With a main driving riff that is simply indescribable in its power, and strong, rebellious lyrics, this song is truly a masterpiece of heavy metal. Of note are Bill Ward\u2019s strange drumming (what is that, a trash can?) during the wordless chorus, and the first appearance of synthesizer in a Black Sabbath song toward the middle (if you don\u2019t count the intro to \u201cAfter Forever\u201d). The feelings of paranoia and the imagery of all these children brimming with fury and rebellion\u2026 all I can say is that this song is perfect in every way. Even the outro: \u201cChildren of the gra-gra-grave\u2026..\u201d\n\n\u201cOrchid\u201d suffers from the same plight as \u201cEmbryo,\u201d except it is a little more developed. The bowed bass is pretty cool. Meh.\n\nBy this time in the album, you pretty much know what to expect, which is the only thing that hampers \u201cLord of This World.\u201d It has a similar sound to the rest of the album, but it is still an amazing display of the talent that this band possessed. The lyrics are a little vague, and the main verse riff is a little same-y, but overall this is another great Sabbath classic. And it\u2019s awesome when he says \u201cThe soul I took from you was not even missed!\u201d The instrumental section of the song sounds particularly inspired, and there is some typically sweet guitar playing by Iommi. And the part where it goes \u201cDuh-duh-duh-duh-duh! Lord of this world!...\u201d etc. is really awesome. This song is often overlooked, but it really shouldn\u2019t be. Come on, it has cowbell! No but really, no joke, it\u2019s freakin\u2019 amazing.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s \u201cSolitude,\u201d which kind of sucks. Bill Ward sings it, and when you have a singer as good as Ozzy Osbourne, you\u2019d better learn to stick to your own instrument. This is basically an attempt to recreate \u201cPlanet Caravan\u201d from Paranoid, but it pales in comparison. I\u2019ll give them some credit I guess for the nice atmosphere the song creates \u2013 the backwards piano and flute are nice touches. Iommi\u2019s clean soloing is not as exciting as usual though. Overall the song is pretty uninteresting, musically and lyrically. \u201cThe world is a lonely place when you are alone.\u201d Come on. That lyric sucks. This song is all that keeps the album from being perfect.\n\n\u201cInto the Void\u201d is my favorite song on the album, maybe even my favorite all-time Black Sabbath song (although \u201cWar Pigs\u201d is hard to beat). The opening riff, which they never return to, is just so creepy and\u2026 heavy! What I like best about this song is Iommi\u2019s very creative guitar playing. The entire atmosphere and mood of the song just enraptures you when you hear it. Also, it seems way ahead of its time: the fast part in the middle sounds like the precursor to thrash metal. And that part\u2026 oh man you probably know what I\u2019m talking about. The stop-start thing in the middle of the guitar solo. That is just incredible.\n\nMaster of Reality is proof that Black Sabbath were brave pioneers, constantly pushing the boundaries of heavy metal. After the success of Paranoid, you\u2019d think they would start to sound formulaic, but hell no! With the exception of \u201cSolitude,\u201d every song is a masterpiece, and I have a hell of a lot of fun listening to this record. If nothing else, get this for \u201cInto the Void.\u201d\n",
        "\nMy first metal album, without question my favorite, and unarguably one of the best ever recorded. This is the album that broke heavy metal through to a wider audience, and proved that it actually had something to say as a musical genre. In 8 songs, Black Sabbath told the story of heavy metal from beginning to end, and it is a story that will never be forgotten.\n\nFirst of all, any album with \u201cWar Pigs\u201d on it is automatically the greatest metal album ever. Ozzy\u2019s vocals on this song compete only with his own on Black Sabbath\u2019s self titled song. Musicians far outside of metal have covered this song, including Phish. Come again? Yeah you heard me the first time. Phish. During its verse, the song employs the hands-down-simplest guitar riff ever (but it works so good!), and Ozzy Osbourne\u2019s brilliant ascending-then-descending melody remains unmatched in the annals of metal. The song definitely has some anti-war stuff going on, although I\u2019m not quite sure which war (Viet Nam maybe? I\u2019m no history buff). And god damn, the droning, almost psychedelic guitar segment that dominates the last half of the song is just\u2026 jaw dropping. Well I don\u2019t know about you, but my jaw drops when I hear it. I\u2019ll admit the ending is kind of silly, though. \u201cBuuudiiidiiibuuudiidiibuudubidubidiididuudfuufi!\u201d That\u2019s what it sounds like, kind of.\n\nThe album\u2019s biggest radio hit was \u201cParanoid,\u201d and apparently it was written in about 20 minutes, when they realized they had some extra studio time to kill. For me, this song works perfectly as a concise pop song and a metal anthem. The chorus is instrumental\u2026 I can just imagine if a later metal band wrote this song, the chorus would be \u201cYeeeahhh! I\u2019m paaaaranoooiiid!\u201d in a power metal scream. Which would be awesome, actually. But this song is perfect as it is, 3 minutes of pure metal goodness.\n\n\u201cPlanet Caravan\u201d is strange; it has only clean guitar, bass, and bongos. And vocals of course, which are processed through some sort of modifier. The lyrics in this song are awesomely trippy, and they totally make the song. The atmosphere of the instrumentation is incredible. Once I was listening to it with my friend who doesn\u2019t like metal, and he was like \u201cThis track is awesome.\u201d Or something like that. The guitar solo in the end is so calm and graceful, it\u2019s a jazzy type of thing. Bongos!\n\nAnd well, of course, there\u2019s \u201cIron Man.\u201d What some have called the greatest and most memorable guitar riff of all time, it is endlessly parodied (but still hasn\u2019t lost its purity and raw power). This was probably the heaviest rock song that had come out at the time (1970), and I bet people were like, \u201cWhooaaa!\u201d Oh man, the Way Iommi switches from chords to single notes in the verse. This song is a particular standout for Iommi actually. The extended solo section at the end is some of his best work ever. Listening to this song makes you imagine this big iron dude. Walking. Loudly.\n\nWaa-waa-wa-wa-waaaoohhh \u2013 This song has wah pedal in it. And it ROCKS. The main guitar riff is very evil, probably the most evil sounding song on the album. This is the traditional slow crawling Black Sabbath riff, that they tried endlessly to recreate, but never could. \u201cLike electric funeral pyre!!\u201d Ozzy was a genius (I said WAS). Some cool tom drumming from Bill Ward here. The song picks up in the middle, and gets real fast and cool. Not that it wasn\u2019t cool before. But now it\u2019s ultra cool. And of course the classic moment when he\u2019s all like, \u201cElectric fun-ral! Electric fun-ral!\u201d Aw man, that rocks. And I always thought the ending fadeout sounds especially evil and restrained. It sounds like a beast that wants to fucking tear your eyes out, but there\u2019s a cage holding it back. Geezer Butler\u2019s harmony in this part is simply\u2026 chilling.\n\n\u201cHand of Doom\u201d is classic because it switches between a mellow, quiet verse and a violent, electric chorus. The quiet part has an awesome drum beat. And then the LOUD PART shows clearly that Bill Ward was no chump. And Ozzy\u2019s all like, \u201cNow it\u2019s killing yoouuu!\u201d This song seems to be about heroin, Black Sabbath was all about the drugs. The middle fast part has one of the best guitar riffs on the album, I think. Oh man it rocks so hard, I can\u2019t even describe it! I just think it\u2019s amazing how every riff on the whole record is one of the best riffs you\u2019ve ever heard. It\u2019s like, you think they\u2019re done cranking out awesome guitar riffs, and then HERE COME SOME MORE! One of my favorite parts of the song is when he goes \u201cYou need someone to help you take the needle in, yeah!\u201d and then Iommi goes off into this Eastern-sounding solo. This song is probably the best display on the album of Sabbath\u2019s ability to change dynamics on the spot, and make it sound convincing.\n\nAaaah, \u201cRat Salad,\u201d Black Sabbath\u2019s answer to Led Zeppelin\u2019s \u201cMoby Dick,\u201d which came out earlier the same year. Well it is an instrumental which starts out with some sick riffs (is this surprising anymore?), and then goes into a rather long drum solo (this was the 70\u2019s, folks). Actually I hate to say it, but comparing the recorded versions of the solos in Salad and Moby, Bill Ward beats John Bonham. However, one watch of the How the West Was Won DVD and you\u2019ll see that Bonham was indeed better. Sorry, Bill. This song still rocks my socks though.\n\nThe trippiest, absolutely coolest guitar sequence opens \u201cFairies Wear Boots.\u201d Oh man, where does he come UP with this shit? Some cool drumming from Ward as usual leads into yet another sick mid-paced solo by Iommi. The lyrics in this song are incredibly strange. In the story, Ozzy is tripping on acid so hard that he sees dancing fairies wearing boots, along with some other strange sights. So then he goes to the doctor, and the doctor says \u201cSmokin\u2019 and trippin\u2019 is all that you do\u2026 Yeeeaaaahhhhhh!\u201d This is simultaneously the coolest and most hilarious lyric in all of heavy metal. Iommi\u2019s solo in the middle has some sick bends and it is one of the best on the record, in my humblest of opinions. This song is absolutely perfect. I wouldn\u2019t change a thing.\n\nI hesitate giving anything a score of 100%, but I just HAD to. Because Paranoid is the greatest heavy metal record of all time, the only metal album that REALLY matters in the grand scheme of things. I wouldn\u2019t give Master of Puppets 100%, nor would I bestow that honor upon The Number of the Beast. It\u2019s just that this is the one album that says \u2013 Black Sabbath is nobody\u2019s bitch.\n",
        "\nWhat is this that stands before me? It can't be four guys in hippie clothes playing rock music... The opening song on this album is simply immense. There is no other word to describe it. Well, maybe I can think of some more. MONSTROUS. STUPEFYING... You get the idea. Nowhere else has so much been hidden within 3 notes (2 of which are the same note, an octave apart). Amazing. Glorious. Bill Ward clunking away at those drums, no faster than a cancerous snail, Geezer Butler tempting those soothing slow notes out of his bass. Tony Iommi roaring on his guitar, and of course... Ozzy Osbourne. \"Ohhh no, no, no! Please, God help me!...\" Aah, what a line. That has got to be my favorite lyric in any song, ever. When the song picks up and gets faster, it still rocks my socks. \"No, no, no, please no!\" leads into Tony's solo, which makes you think \"The pentatonic scale has never sounded so good!\" Topping it all off with a syncopated stop-start ending, and oh man! A metal classic. \n\nThe rest of the album is not up to the standards of that first song, but \"The Wizard\" comes close. Harmonica? Yeah that's right, harmonica, bitch. You better believe it. This song opens with some superb riffing from Iommi and Butler, and the verse section has some great drumming from Ward. And yes, he has a cowbell. You got a problem with that? The lyrics are classic Sabbath: about a wizard who has magic powers... that's pretty much it. There isn't much detail, but that's what makes it so damn awesome. Basically, Ozzy becomes the wizard with his demonic voice. Also, this song has a sick guitar solo, followed by a well, less impressive harmonica solo. \n\n\"Behind the Wall of Sleep\" starts out real good, with a great atmospheric beginning in *gasp* 3/4 time! Breaking down into a sort-of-funky riff, this is classic Sabbath goodness. Ozzy, as usual, delivers his lyrics where you can't understand half of them. And even the ones you can understand, you don't actually understand. But oh man, he sounds so awesome! After another superb solo from Iommi, the verse is repeated, and yada yada yada. Unfortunately, the song starts to decompose at this point. About 30 seconds are given over to a rather boring bass solo. Now, here comes \"N.I.B.\", one of the most overrated Sabbath songs (or... part of a song). It starts out allright, nothing special, but they repeat it about 506 times more than they need to. Yeah I guess the story is pretty cool, about the devil seducing a woman, but whatever. Basically, I would probably like this song a hell of a lot more if it were a hell of a lot shorter. And the guitar riff? Come on. The main hook of the riff (the first 4 notes) are the same as \"Sunshine of Your Love\" by Cream, and well, that song was really really famous at the time. So... Black Sabbath isn't perfect, apparently. Who knew? \n\nAnd then the mystery of \"Wicked World.\" It wasn't included in the original British LP, but we Americans get to enjoy this shitty B-side instead the single at the time \"Evil Woman.\" Instead of hearing one of the songs that made Sabbath famous, we get this bore-fest. First of all, it was obviously recorded at a different time, possibly in a different studio. Or maybe in a closet, because the sound quality sucks. Ozzy's vocals were recorded at too high an input level, or something, because they crackle. There is an interesting little guitar interlude in the middle of the song which captures Iommi at some of his best playing at this early stage of Sabbath's career. But still, this song is pretty boring. \"A woman goes to work every day of the day (or something) she goes to work just to earn her pay...\" I mean, COME ON. \n\nSomeone please clarify this for me... what is \"A Bit of Finger\"??? I don't think this song actually exists, they just put it on the label to psych us out. But anyway, \"Sleeping Village\" is pretty cool, going from a creepy acoustic thing to a full onslaught. I am now reminded of why I love this album so much after listening to \"Wicked World.\" The usual awesome riffing combined with awesome drumming, well... you know. That's what Sabbath does. A couple of minutes into the song there is a cool double guitar solo that rocks my world. \"Warning\" gets a little boring, though. I don't think Black Sabbath can do blues. No matter what they think they are, no matter how they started out, they can't do blues. So, \"Warning\" gets a thumbs-down in my book. Yeah I guess the guitar work is okay, but it seriously goes on for way too long. I'm not normally one to say that a guitar solo is \"too long\", but this song has too many extended solo parts. Iommi was good, but not *THAT* good. I mean, there is soloing from about 8 minutes to about 13 minutes into the song. That's five god damn minutes of pentatonic scale. Remember when that scale sounded so good? Well it doesn't anymore. Also, a good chunk of this solo is unaccompanied (that's right folks, no other instruments are playing). Then at the end of the song, the band goes back into that same blues figure, which I didn't really like the first time, and 15 minutes later, I still don't really like it. \n\nOh well, it's a shame to end on such a bad note, because there is some pretty strong stuff on this record, not to mention that it is probably the first true \"heavy metal\" album (if you don't count Led Zepplin I). Most of the first 3 songs are a superbly rockin' experience, and so maybe there's some filler. They created heavy metal! I'll cut them some slack.\n",
        "\nOne of the most underrated Black Sabbath albums happens to be one of the best. Dehumanizer welcomes back the vocal god Ronnie James Dio, and one of his best performances is put on this album. For the most part we have a very similar vocal production from Dio, his straight out power wielding vocals. However, there are some songs where pure evil reigns in his voice. What I mean is that on some songs Dio's voice is very low and with the powerful sounds of doom riffing makes it sound evil. Best song that shows this is After All, which is one of the best songs on this album.\n\nFor the most part, the riffs are typical doom metal oriented. Very slow and at times melodic, but there is so much more to it on this album. The way the crunch is worked, and the distortion puts an evil edge upon the songs, something Black Sabbath has been lacking for awhile. I agree with Ultra Boris, Black Sabbath got back to a familiar tone of the Ozzy years. They got back the dark and evil sound that made Black Sabbath, Black Sabbath. Dio even sounds a lot like Ozzy on the song Sins of the Father.\n\nAll the songs are pretty exceptional with awesome Iommi riffs. Dio's vocals shine high on this album, and can well be placed up with Mob Rules and Heaven and Hell. There are two types of songs, semi-fast paced and the slow doom metal tunes. Drumming, the bass, production, everything comes together on this album. If everything didn't come together, it would probably be a good album still because the song structures are solid and just really that good.\n\nAnd with awesome songs and dark lyrics I wonder why this is an underrated album. Plus if you got the US version it comes with Time Machine the Wayne's World mix. If you love Black Sabbath then you probably own this album and already know what I am talking about. If you haven't heard this album...well shame on you, because it is a masterpiece of heavy metal.\n",
        "\nThis little live record managed to capture Black Sabbath at their peak with then-new vocalist Ronnie James Dio. Coming off of two highly successful albums it looked as if Black Sabbath were ready to release the live record of a lifetime. The legends are abound with the drama over mixing this record that caused the band to split with this line-up and at this point nobody really cares. The end result is a slightly sound-challenged (mix could have been a bit better) but well performed document of the highly successful \"Mob Rules\" tour.\n\nThe best songs on the record are the blistering \"Neon Nights\", the dominating \"N.I.B.\" and a scarring take on \"Mob Rules\". The rest is all very good as well, with these tracks standing out above the overall mix. The only complaint is a silly spoken section in the middle of the otherwise brilliant \"Voodoo\" and the exclusion of such strong Dio-era tracks like \"Die Young\". These can all be seen as middling complaints though. as the band had done more than enough to make this record a classic addition to the already stacked Sabbath catalog.\n\nI suggest that any fans of metal purchase this and NOW. If you want to hear what perfect proto-doom metal with a summoning vocalist sounds like you NEED to own this. This is quite possibly a better record in playing and feel than the Ozzy fronted \"Reunion\" record. I've owned it for nearly six years...and I've NEVER stopped spinning it.\n\nBUY OR DIE KIDDIES!\n\nhttp://www.black-sabbath.com\n",
        "\n\"Born Again\" marks the last of the great \"doom\"-era Sabbath records. Building still on the Ward-Iommi-Butler line-up that was still producing the familiar \"Sab-crunch\" before the band decided to drift into a more \"modern\" sound. The only new element here is a big one, being Deep Purple screamer Ian Gillan! While the mix may have seemed odd, Gillan pushed the band back into their 1970's prime in terms of writing and provided a multi-octave vocal assault to many of the classic tracks they produced together. Sadly, the production is anyhow as disjointed as a 1970's release but this matters little. The grooves, riffs and lyrics all work together to form a couldron of occult weirdness that Sabbath had been lacking since \"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\". For me, this is the last of the great and truly \"Sabbath\" era recordings before the band went wandering into an enjoyable, but entirely different style of music.\n\nThe feature tracks on this include the epic \"Born Again\", the howling \"Disturbing the Priest\" and the doom-lurge of \"Zero the Hero\". The lyrics were more relevant to the world (in classic Sab form) than they had been with Dio and the mood reflects real discontent with life, women and religion that brought the band BACK to what they did best. (That being the observation and frustration with the world around them.) Black Sabbath delivered the goods on ALL of the songs and brougth metal to a point of street-cred that the Dio era had lost them. While not perfect in promotion and production...the songs on this record were the best suited to Sabbath since the \"Sabotage\" record. (Ozzy could have easily taken part in this record as the lyrics/music stood out as being in that era.)\n\nThis would be the last time in a long time that Sabbath held true to their original vision. From then on out they would expiriment with more \"gothic\" styles of metal and they would do so well. Sadly though, the name Sabbath would lose it's original meaning and this record stands (until the reunion) as the last time Sabbath was seen as they were born and meant to be seen.\n\nIt's a classic indeed...\n\n\"Born Again\" has some of the best metal EVER released lying in it's wax grooves (or plastic if you're digging it on CD). Despite the disorganized production it should be said that NOBODY can deny the howling fury locked in these songs. Ian Gillan could only have done it once...but he did it well.\n\nBUY OR DIE!\n\nhttp://www.black-sabbath.com\n",
        "\nAs essential as this album is in the history of things, I cannot wholeheartedly endorse it, because some of the songs on here are complete crap. It's hard to say exactly why this happened... this was not the primitive origin of the debut album, where half the songs were blues because the rest of the world was entirely blues. This just seems to be a concerted effort to not make any sense. When this album is on, it is dead on - unfortunately when it is off, it is pretty much unlistenable.\n\nThis stands in stark contrast to an album like Sabotage, which is brilliant all around, including in the interludes... or Master of Reality, which only has a little bit of off kilter stuff. Here, the off-kilter stuff comes in when you least want it, and just ruins the continuity of the album.\n\nThe opener, Wheels of Confusion/The Straightener, is completely brilliant... it starts with a little melodic acid-rock riff before suddenly and abruptly switching gears into that godawfully triumphant metal stuff that only Iommi could execute so perfectly. This is probably the first of the later-Ozzy era epic style numbers (see: Megalomania, for the quintessential example), in that it's more complicated than an earlier number like Hand of Doom or Black Sabbath. Both of those songs go through their mood changes as well, but Wheels of Confusion completely takes this to a new level - starting slow, then speeding up (Iron Man, Black Sabbath, etc) and then slowing down again (Hand of Doom, Into the Fucking Void), and then throwing in the outro piece, which is far more complex than anything that came before it... I'm pretty sure The Straightener comes in when you'd expect it (it's one track, so I'm not sure exactly where the break is, but I have a good idea), when you get another really cute acid-rock Ten Years After style riff, and then a lot of midpaced soloing and heavy riffage over it. Imagine the closer of \"Layla\" (Eric Clapton) gone horribly, horribly wrong. There's quite a bit of instrumentation going on here, with the line between 'riff' and 'solo' getting quite badly blurred - and it all works brilliantly well. Along with Black Sabbath and Into the Fucking Void, this song is the highlight of Sabbath's career up to this point.\n\nThe rest? Well, nothing will top the brilliance of that one song, but there are certainly a few others here that are quite good. Pretty much, all the heavy songs, which feature Tony's masterful riff work, are all very good. When they want to be Black Fucking Sabbath, they are that, and they are good at that. The highlight for me is probably the closer, Under the Sun, which also brings in a few acid-rock sounding moments, but makes them so much more unbearably heavy than a band like Cream ever could've imagined sounding. When the verses kick in, it's a typical Iommi riff, and then the song gets faster and faster, with Ozzy's vocals more and more desperate. This album is about an average Ozzy performance, meaning that it isn't as brilliant as Sabotage, but it is listenable, unlike some of the later efforts. There's a riff in here that reminds me of the fast riff in Paranoid, before the whole thing turns back into a midpaced assault, and then the outro solo is a bit War-Pigs-like, but sufficiently twisted inside out (see that break riff out of nowhere around 5:25) as to be completely interesting.\n\nThe other heavy songs... Tomorrow's Dream, Cornucopia - both good Sabbath songs in their own right; easily recognisable for what they are. There's no one else that writes riffs like this. Snowblind's intro riff is actually the same note sequence as the intro riff in Heaven and Hell, except the notes are different lengths. Another great song, and the use of the subliminal \"cocaine!!\" vocal line is there just in case someone's retarded and thinks the song is about skiing or something. Hah. \n\nThen Supernaut is also a morbidly heavy song, though there's a bit of an interlude that seems somewhat overlong. Still, probably the fastest song on here, and very well done, with a nice gallop riff that screams Judas Priest before Judas Priest ever screamed. Though the song is a bit simplistic, with the only real change coming in the way of a drum interlude. Wheels of Confusion, this is not.\n\nSaint Vitus Dance is the last of the heavy songs... a cute little song that spawned a great doom band. Sort of an average little song, though, that has an atmosphere of late 60s hippie rock. Not even acid rock, but general happy-go-lucky stuff they play on the oldies station. Then throw on the lyrics. Hah! The song alternates between one heavy riff and one happy one, and in general it's not bad, but the worst of the actual songs on here.\n\nThe rest? These are pretty much completely worthless. Changes, F/X, and Laguna Sunrise. Laguna Sunrise actually seems like it was designed with some effort in mind, but it just does nothing for me. It's an acoustic number, that doesn't work nearly as well as the acoustic stuff bookending Symptom of the Universe (Don't Start/Too Late, and the end of that track itself). Then F/X is just a terrible string of noises whose purpose eludes me, and Changes is a completely worthless ballad, that makes their other completely worthless ballads actually seem not completely worthless. Puke.\n\nSo there are SEVEN heavy songs on here, which is more than there are on some of the other albums, and all of them range from 'pretty good' to 'completely brilliant', but the fact remains, that I can't listen to the entire album from beginning to end. Putting the godawful Changes after the excellent Tomorrow's Dream? Sorry, but that doesn't work at all. Then preceding the riff monster Supernaut with the stupid F/X? Welcome to planet Not Making Sense. Population: Black Sabbath, circa 1972. Then Laguna Sunrise is probably the most sensible of the poor songs, and it doesn't sound all THAT out of place, but it just sucks, and I would have no problem with Cornucopia leading into Saint Vitus Dance.\n\nWorth getting? I suppose, but don't start with this one. If you're new to Sabbath, you've probably heard most of Paranoid (who hasn't?), so start with that, Sabotage or Master of Reality.\n",
        "\nBorn Again is often mentioned as one of the worst, if not the worst, of all of Black Sabbath's recording. This is a very unfair and misguided judgement since there is a LOT of prejudice against it for various reasons. First, Ozzy Osbourne is not the singer, that in itself is enough for many fans to disregard any album that doesn't contain the \"classic\" lineup, this I find absurd. Second, it follows two fantastic studio albums, Heaven and Hell and Mob Rules, both of which raised the bar for Black Sabbath musically. Third, the absolutely horrid, almost cartoony album cover, that tries to look \"evil\" but ends up looking corny. Fourth, Ian Gillan's vocals which sound almost black metal in nature in some parts as he really shrieks and howls, much different from Ronnie James Dio's classic metal style. And last, but definetly not least, the main reason this albums is considered crap: the sound mix. Rumor has it that bassist Geezer Butler tampered with the mix for some reason, some say to bring up his bass parts, this is unconfirmed. Also the drum sound is very faint and lacking in power.\nBut aside from all that, lets focus on the music at hand. This is NOT a bad album. Certainly it's no Sabbath Bloody Sabbath but there is a lot of great stuff here. There is a lot of variety, from the fast paced Thrashed to the doomy epic song Disturbing the Priest (the album's best track IMO). Also of note is the slow paced, atmospheric Born Again which Ian Gillan sings with much passion. Zero The Hero has a great hypnotic riff with an almost industrial feel. All of Sabbath's trademarks are here crushingly heavy riffs of Tony Iommi, the occult-tinged lyrics and the overall doomy feel. This would be the only album with Ian Gillan (he left to rejoin Deep Purple) and from here onward there would be other singers. Born Again remains as a very unique work in the Sabbath discography since it resembles nothing the band ever did before or after.\n",
        "\nOh man... so this album starts off almost promising. There's a few times where you grate your teeth and think \"holy fuck this is cheesy\", but you keep hanging on, because you hope that if it maintains this constant level of quality, it will stay okay... except unfortunately, this is like what happens in the cartoons, where Wile E. Coyote gets dropped off a cliff, and it takes him two songs to figure out that he's fucked, no matter what, and from that point on it's complete anguish all the way down.\n\nWell, there's the title track... sorry, but this song is fucking awesome. I have no idea why I like it so much, because the middle part \"don't you... ever say die\" features Ozzy at his most pathetic, but somehow it just plain works. Then again, I like the \"shout it out, we are together now\" part in Ram it Down, so maybe I'm just fucking stupid, and what do I know, honestly. Oh yeah, the very end, the pitch-shifted \"never say die...\" thing sucks, but hey, that's only one second, so it's all good. \n\nJohnny Blade is actually a cool song... then again, I like Aldo Nova, and this sounds similar, so of course I'm expected to like it. It's got some nifty keyboard parts, and the final solo rules. The vocals are totally phoned-in, and the chorus is kinda forced, especially with the total dynamic abuse of turning up EVERYTHING by 9dB in the chorus (brilliantly backwards sound engineering there), but ya know, for a late-70s keyboard rocker, this is okay. Of course, the cheese factor is maximal. Black Sabbath begat heavy metal on their first 6 albums. On this one, they gave rise to the runt of the litter: Bon Jovi. Oh yeah and the song could have two minutes taken out of the middle of it, and it would be a lot better. \n\nThe rest of the album... oh Jeebus creeping monkey-scrotum appendage flagellating me repeatedly!!! \n\nI can't quite pinpoint what's wrong with Junior's Eyes, other than the fact that it relies on one bass riff to carry it for over six minutes, and thus ends up being flat out boring. Also, Ozzy cannot pronounce the word \"junior\" correctly. Heh, heh, he said \"wiener\". That's right, Beavis.\n\nHard Road just fucking sucks. Oh, it's a hard road. Isn't that from Little Orphan Annie or something?? Gimme a break. \n\nShockwave starts out pretty cool, although if you listen to the bass carefully, you can hear Back Street Kids. Then, when it slows down, disaster happens. It's here that you hear that, by this point in his career, Ozzy is no longer \"the dude from Black Sabbath that sang on Sabotage\" - it's FECES FECEBOURNE!!! \n\nHEEYYY KIDDSS!!! Who do you love????\n\nFECES FECEBOURNE!!!!!\n\nHow much do you love me????\n\nWITH ALL OUR HEARTS!!!!!\n\nWhat would I do if I got replaced with Ronnie James Dio????\n\nWE'D KILL OUR... no wait, we would rejoice, motherfucker. \n\nThis is the Ozzy that brought down Randy Rhoads's appearances on his first two solo albums... the same Ozzy that flips himself over on a dirtbike in the name of entertainment. This isn't the guy that sang \"what is this.... that stands before me??\" This is Sharon's manslut.\n\nYeah, Shockwave sucks, when all is said and done. Hoo hoo. Isn't that that terrible song from Steve Miller that has that \"hoo hoo\" part in it? Yes, I do believe it is. If you listen carefully, you can pinpoint the exact moment where Tony Iommi decides it absolutely necessary that Dave Walker be brought into the band!\n\nAir Dance takes one really really shitty riff and plays it over and over again for a while, before going into a dumb keyboard-ballad thingey. This is horrendous. This is disastrous. Could it be that it was only 20 minutes ago that I was listening to Johnny Blade and thinking \"this could be better if the sound engineer's brain hadn't been replaced with antifreeze\"? This is some lounge-music shit, and oh how the mighty have fallen.\n\nWHAT IS THIS? THAT STANDS BEFORE ME???\n\nOver to You... \"so keep on rockin' me, baby...\" I forget which song that is, or which band, but it's a classic rock staple, and this song sounds EXACTLY like it, except dumber and having the most annoying human being on the planet at the vocals helm. Then - and I am not making this up - it descends into keyboard-based lounge-music. WHAT, AGAIN?? Elections, Quimby! Elections! Quality increase necessary to maintain credibility!\n\nSpeaking of credibility (Insufferable Blows Thereto department) Break Out is Black Sabbath's foray into disco music. I wish I were kidding. I wish \"Black Sabbath's foray into disco music\" were just a Regurgitated Cow Fetus song title, with absolutely no bearing in physical reality, sorta like \"being anally violated with an entire warehouse\". This is worse, because this is true. But it kinda feels similar.\n\nSwinging the Chain sounds like a fourth-rate Deep Purple ripoff. It's got Bill Ward on vocals, and it sounds really like someone attempted to try doing Warpig, which is an early-70s band that sounded a bit like Deep Purple, except not nearly as good... and doing Warpig not nearly as well as Warpig did Warpig. Entirely forgettable bullshit, and the random squeaky noises in the background don't help. Oh man, this album really takes a fucking dive.\n\nAVOID AVOID AVOID... you know the drill. This is Black Sabbath's Point of Entry, except it's worse than Judas Priest's Point of Entry.\n",
        "\nBefore discussing the music, I would like to take a minute to talk about the album cover... that is some seriously fucked up shit right there. A chance meeting on an escalator between a robotic maidservant out of the Jetsons meeting with a smallish building-shaped entity. At this point, the robot proceeds to both shoot a laser at the poor building, as well as urinate some dark foul gunk out of the top of its head at it. Perhaps the robot is jealous that the building gets to ride the escalator, while it has to take the stairs immediately parallel to it. \n\nThe actual album... there is a LOT of 70s rock to be found here. Lots of keyboards, lots of random stuff that sounds not unlike Kansas or at times even Foreigner. There's Backstreet Kids, which is indeed an awkward attempt at speed metal, though it's kind of a fun song. But yes, the keyboard solo in the middle is a bit goofy. Then, You Won't Change Me is heavy as fuck, while also relying on the keyboards to carry the main theme, which should immediately be noted by the reader as being a departure from, say, Master of Reality.\n\nThe third song is kinda cute, though downright pathetic. It's not Black Sabbath, it's a piano ballad. But, it eats Changes alive, that I'll tell you right now. It's something I'd expect to hear on the adult contemporary station, and would be pretty nice if not for the \"oooh oooh\" parts in the middle. Home Sweet Home, this ain't. \n\nThen, we have Gypsy, which I think is actually a decent song. The bridge section (\"she took my hand...\") is amazing, even if the main guitar riff sounds a whole lot like Blue Morning (Foreigner)! Again, this is 70s rock, and certainly not what we had been expecting on Sabotage, but still it's a nice song. \n\nAll Moving Parts... I can't tell you what this sounds like, but again 70s rock is something accurate. I swear, the vocal line is something out of a disco song! I forget which, but usually I'm pretty correct on these things, so just take my word on it. The main problem of the song is that I can't really make out what the guitar is doing underneath the verses - there is a definite bass riff, but otherwise... again, this is NOT Master of Reality. \n\nThe next two songs are complete fucking garbage. Rock 'n Roll Doctor starts off sounding like it'll be decent, though still kinda 70s-rock-ish, before going into a cheesy riff that sounds half Grand Funk Railroad, half Aerosmith, and all regression. Wasn't this what Black Sabbath PURPOSELY moved away from in the early 70s? Argh. Also, that dang cowbell, and that repeated chorus. \n\nShe's Gone is the second coming of Changes. Cunting death-avoid. \n\nThen there's the last song, which indeed, as everyone has correctly pointed out, is a real fucking masterpiece of SABBATH-ness. I can't remember what that opening riff sounds like, but it's yet another 70s rock song, except distorted and warped into something morbidly heavy. Good job, Tony Iommi. A great song.\n\nSo what do we have here, overall? A decent album, really, but not something that you'd expect, given that this is Black Sabbath. You look at that damned album cover, and you could totally slap any 70s-rock band name on there instead of the generic lettered Black Sabbath, and the album content would make just as much, if not more sense.\n\nThat's a bad thing, folks. After the masterful Sabotage, this is really disappointing. Apologies to VileRancour for pretty much aping his review, except mine is not nearly as well-written. Sorry, folks. I'm just not inspired.\n",
        "\nRaise no objections, put down your Deep Purple, your Judas Priest, your Metallica, your good-fucking-God-no Led Zeppelin, this album is it. Black Sabbath created metal with three songs on the debut, but Paranoid is 100% metal, every song clawing at your mind, tearing your sanity to the brink of madness, scaring the shit out of your parents.\n\nIt's not without weakness, hence the 88 (it's not even close to their BEST album), but it's their greatest. After this, they could've just sat back and ended their career, two pieces of revolutionary noise beyond all criticism under their belts. Instead, they made a good fifty more classics (songs not albums, although it seems that way sometimes) that your life would not be complete without. Thank them. Get down on your knees and worship these fumbling stoned gods of metal. Now, onto the actual content.\n\nThe band has advanced a frightening degree from record one, eschewing the outdated and awkward suite-based songs of the debut for tight, focused genius, riffs, leads, fills, and lyrics that will be burned into your brain for eternity. In all the came before, there was nothing to account for \"Iron Man\", that opening sledge, a non-musical scream of agony and rage that spiritually fathered extreme metal. Can you imagine listening to those first thirty seconds in 1970, with only a few noisy Cream concerts and insufferably dull Zeppelin plodders to prepare you? And after that, what a song! Black Sabbath gives us TWO monstrous riffs that every aspiring guitarist must learn, and a fearsome break, lessened only by the fact that it is somewhat similar to that of \"Black Sabbath\" and \"War Pigs\". If there was ever a riff designed to liquefy the brains of the impressionable youths, it\u2019s the opening howl of \u201cIron Man\u201d.\n\nSpeaking of \"War Pigs\", it's got a great bid for greatest heavy metal song ever. It's epic, almost progressive in scope, those wide-yawning spaces filled only by an impassioned Ozzy giving us the first metal protest song, oh lord yeah! And oh lawd, testify to the mad air drumming godliness of those Bill Ward fills, like nothing on earth \u2018til Rush\u2019s \u201cTom Sawyer\u201d a good dozen years hence. Brilliant jammy break too, Iommi soloing like mad while that perfect rhythm section scowls and lopes along underneath. Plus, it's Side 1, Track 1 of metal's crowning album, making it quite the standard bearer through the accumulating ages of rust and disgust.\n\n\"Paranoid\" is galloping proto-speed, as UltraBoris pointed out not the high metal science of \"Highway Star\", but looked upon favourably by metal heads everywhere. That starting gun of a riff, fading into the maddeningly sing-songy melody is the stuff of metal legend. I mean damn, I know every word of that song, like some sort of mantra or rap to the metal cause; more specifically to the cause of metal, which must\u2019ve been the result of brain damage. It's burned into my brain. Gotta love that bubbly bass tone and behaved drumming, plus one of Iommi's more fun lead breaks.\n\n\"Planet Caravan\" (given an able, if uninspired, cover by Pantera in later years) is a mellow 'trippy' number, feeling like a cool balm on your pressure cooked brain before \"Iron Man\" gives you another scalding. Illegible singing by Ozzy, subterranean drumming and guitar, this song is all about bass. Good, unique, track, and perhaps an indicator of Sabbath's future experimentation on later songs like \"Spiral Architect\" and the Technical Ecstasy record.\n\n\nAlas, \"Electric Funeral\" is just weaksauce, a plodding and limp-wristed metaphor for nuclear war. Still, an able update of the doomy power demonstrated on \"Black Sabbath\". Ozzy's voice is much too faded out and electronic though.\n\n\"Hand of Doom\" is brilliant, Geezer Butler giving the track its name with his unholy bass work, Bill Ward afire with alchemical genius in that fast break, Ozzy Osbourne really top-flight despite the barebones lyrics he's working with. Tony is of course Tony, but he's actually made somewhat peripheral here by the power of the rest of this band.\n\n\"Rat Salad\", is a fair instrumental, nothing really special save for more percussion pyrotechnics. [To the person who said this track ripped off \"Moby Dick\", this came out first pal]\n\nFinally, \"Fairies Wear Boots\", a lumbering stoner metal classic, the final gem on an album full of them. The lyrics are hilarious, either as a 'harrowing' tale of the stoner who cried wolf (or fairy in this case), or as a biting send-up of the English skinhead movement. Either way, chunky riffery and a nice almost staccato rhythm, particularly when it starts picking up towards the end. This is one of those tracks that makes you appreciate the Ozzy years. I mean, can you imagine Ronnie James Dio singing this? If you can, try to stop laughing/crying. It's another big piece of the metal puzzle, but if lacks the depth of the other crunchy classics on here in some way, really a bit too loose and ill-constructed.\n\nStand-Outs: \"War Pigs\", \"Hand of Doom\", \"Iron Man\"\n",
        "\nWell, metal ground zero right here. You'll notice my score is a bit less than most everyone elses for this(deservedly) legendary album, but I have to think a lot of those high scores are almost obligatory, praising this album to the heavens for it's stunning metal innovation, for it's foundation of the genre nearest and dearest to our blackened metal hearts.\n\nIt's certainly one of the top five sludgy slabs in metal history, and when you compare this to Led Zeppelin, oft bandied about as first metal band, you realize how silly this makes everything that came before. No matter the volume or the crunch, nobody in the 60's had this focused. sloped-brow cudgelling sound. Nobody used power chords like this, or had that ludicrously evil bass, or even the utterly focused military march of one Bill Ward. True, there were Moon and Bonham earlier, but Ward was just so damn...metal. And lets not forget Ozzy, his tonedeaf bleat wavering and wandering over the unshakeable foundation, his hopeless cries not only signalling the end of the trippy, hippie 60's but announcing that a new generation was here, and they were not happy.\n\nStill, hard to call this the number 1, grade A, metal-personifing record. First, there are really only three metal songs here(\"Black Sabbath\", \"N.I.B\", \"The Wizard\"), and fully half of the album is arranged into aimless jamming that owes more to electric blues than the hand of doom. Secondly, 1970 also brought us seminal cuts from Deep Purple(\"In Rock\"), arguably Uriah Heep(\"Very 'Eavy Very 'Umble\"), and Sabbath themselves(\"Paranoid\") that stomp all over the majority of this record and being released within six months of the thing.\n\nMan though, when they're metal they are undeniably so, planting the black seeds of vengeance that would give us so much skullcrushing metallic magic in the years to come. \"Black Sabbath\" is no less than the be-all end-all doom metal song, that poisonous riff slowly seeping into your mind, almost coagulating and smothering under it's own weight, only Ward's drumming giving it the occassional force to inch forward. On top of all this, Ozzy is perfect, showing us a dramatic side we rarely see these days, really selling a lyric that would be painfully hackneyed coming from anyone else. Instead it's practically terrifying.\n\n\"N.I.B\"[a moment here. \"N.I.B\" does not stand for Nativity in Black. It's the word \"nib\" with dots between, a band in-joke relating to Bill Wards nickname at the time] is pure demon wax excellence, Geezer Butler demonstrating an off-kilter sense of humour (and crazy bass chops) with a funny little ditty about the devil falling in love. But man, that's some dramatic music under there, the band marching along at a sensible pace while still causing earthquakes, the chorus lifting up, the verses plunging, the bass almighty. And man, don't forget that \"Bassically\" awesome intro.[For an even more basstastic experience, be sure to check out Primus and Ozzy's cover from Nativity in Black II]\n\nFinally on the true metal side, there's my fav song on the album, \"The Wizard\". Man, what an awesome riff, Tony just cranking up the crunch and dueling with that strangely out of place yet perfect harmonica. And man, Bill Ward never seems to get credit for how awesome he is. I mean, check out those totally air-drummable fills. It's genius, genius! Also of note, Sabbath beats Zeppelin to the mystic punch, \"The Wizard\" going all fantasy before those fucking \"hammer of the gods\" fanclubbers that get all the credit.\n\nThe rest of the album, it's a good listen, Iommi doing some fine soloing, \"Wicked World\" being a non-metallic, yet unarguably fun track. It's really hard to point out some moment you like from the suite-style track arrangements, but \"Behind the Wall of Sleep\" is unarguable a fine little song. Still, it's gonna get much better one album hence.\n\nStand-Outs: \"The Wizard\", \"Behind the Wall of Sleep\", \"N.I.B\"\n",
        "\nAll of Tony Martin's stuff.... well, except maybe that last album from '95 (Forbidden) is must-hear material. This era is indeed the ultimate in classic power-metal of the Purple/Rainbow/Dio/Yngwie vein. Combine Iommi's monster guitar work with the sense of style borrowed from Rainbow via a certain former vocalist, and from Purple via another certain former vocalist, and then throw in the most underrated singer in the history of the world... combine all that with epic song constructions about vikings and other cool stuff, and you are all set.\n\nHighlights.... first off, the uber-song Battle of Tyr/Odin's Court/Valhalla, which bursts open on the third track... VALHALLA!!!! Then of course The Sabbath Stones harks back to some of the more traditional years of Sabbath, with the heavy-as-fuck riffage... there's also the catchy, speedy, 80s-metal sounding Lawmaker, and then THE HIGHLIGHT... the opener is just completely amazing... Anno Mundi. Spiritus Sanctus, Anno Mundi, whatever the fuck he's saying. Also the lyrics are perfect... DO YOU FIGHT FOR THE CAUSE??? Throw in the subtle keyboard track, and the ever-building-up intensity, and we've got ourselves a winner. And the sands of time grow old! One of the best songs Black Sabbath has ever done.\n\nThe album kinda dies a bit at the end... Feels Good to Me is kinda empty and seems like a mishmash centered around one second-class Iommi riff, and Heaven in Black is pretty decent, but just not quite spectaular as some other fast songs that Sabbath has toyed with over the years.\n\nStill, a great album... the second-best album of the Martin years, after the unforgettable Eternal Idol.\n",
        "\nWhile not quite as good as its legendary predecessor (Eternal Idol), this is still quite a decent album. Unfortunately, it fades a bit at the end, but when it's on, it's dead on, and some of the best stuff Sabbath has ever done. \n\nThose highlights are the tracks Headless Cross (with its absolute soul-crushing main riff... sure at times the production is 80s-metal, but by the gods, that's TONY FUCKING IOMMI on the lead guitars, so ... fucken A this is HEAVY!)... then there's the slower, more atmospheric When Death Calls, with its completely amazing \"don't look....\" part at the end, which could be THE highlight of Sabbath's career, though Into the Void and the concerts with Rob Halford want to be mentioned too. \n\nOther than the guitar, the other great positive thing to notice is the vocals. Tony Martin is THE MAN - his vocal tone is perfect for this, and he can hit pretty much any note that he wants to. Other highlights include the closer, Nightwing, and probably the most commercial sounding song on here, Devil and Daughter, with its first notes after the drums sounding a bit like Blondie's \"Call Me\"! Still, a great fucking song.\n\nUnfortunately, the album isn't quite perfect... at times it seems to meander along, especially on Kill in the Spirit World - still, not a bad song at all, especially that \"murder!\" part. While the previous album (to which it will perpetually be compared, damn it) is just coherent as fuck, this one is more a collection of songs than a masterpiece as a whole. But that said, it is still a VERY good album, and certainly worth hearing... don't slag the Martin era, you punks!\n",
        "\nI can't stop listening to this album... beginning to end, no breaks, which is actually sometimes hard to do for Ozzy-era Sabbath. This is just one of those albums that defines Heavy Fucking Metal so clearly that anyone that has no idea about it can be given this album, and no others, and have a reasonably good concept of what the genre is and entails. There are of course several other albums that satisfy this criterion, but this is possibly the first (maybe, maybe, I could make a case for Master of Reality). There were five other LPs before this by Black Sabbath, but this is definitely the first one that bowls you over, beginning to end, with no frills and no distractions. \n\nThe historical importance of this one cannot be understated. Black Sabbath introduced us to evil, with its three-note opener, and its sheer massive despair and death. Master of Reality can still be quoted - a verse here, a riff there - as an example of \"HEAVY\", with the monster riffage of Into the Void being a landmark, 1971 or otherwise. Then, there is this one - as I mentioned before, this is a COMPLETE metal album, that both reaffirms previously established ideals, and breaks new ground too. From the straight-up doom of Hole in the Sky to the absurdly violent proto-thrash of Symptom of the Universe... to even the dynamic component added by bookending it with \"Don't Start\", and that closing section... then of course the two epics, my favourites on here, Megalomania, and The Writ. Slabs of epic, progressive doom, clocking in at nearly ten, and nearly eight, minutes respectively, without getting boring. \n\nThe album opens with Hole in the Sky, and immediately when Tony turns on the distortion and six-string insanity, and Ozzy sings \"I'm looking through... a hole in the sky!\" you know that this is still Black Sabbath the way it was meant to be. This could have been a track from the Paranoid or Master of Reality era - which of course is a very glorious thing to be, with its classic 70s heavy/doom riffage, and Iommi's particular concept of groove - so abused in the 90s, but so glorious when done right... when the right-minded individuals of the world, in 1975, first got the album the day it came out, I'm sure they were questioning what was happening to Black Sabbath, what with the kinda strange Sabbath Bloody Sabbath from two years before, and the stories of record-label troubles, and of course the endless drugs and debauchery. Well, the riff set right here completely answers all the questions. We are Black FUCKING Sabbath, and we are here to beat you to death.\n\nMegalomania features layers of Ozzy's demented vocals, and here he turns in the performance of a career. Not whiny, not annoying, rather flat out insane... obsessed, obsessed, obsessed... feeling it slipping away... throw in the first three minutes (concluding with the keyboard echoing the riff), and then the remaining seven (starting with that power-metal-esque Iommi masterpiece), first despairing bleak heaviness, and then headbanging, crushing, \"congratulations, you have been fucked with a brick\" heavy fucking metal. Iommi is the master of riff construction - here, he shows off his work like no other. It's drug-induced warfare - ten minutes of insanity, and over all too fast. \n\nIt's followed up by The Thrill of it All, which goes through several moods, each highlighted by a particular riff. Kids, metal is all about riffs... not just kinda having them there, but having them the main backbone of the song. And this song demonstrates how to use riffs to further the message. Even in the \"softer\" parts, with the keyboards or the acoustic guitar, there is a definite guitar part, and if you isolated just that track, you could still get a good idea of what the song was supposed to mean.\n\nThe album closes with the Writ, which is also an excellent riff monster, as it lumbers through its destructive path, with the monster guitars, and then the little subtle things, like the backmasked high-hat... and another great example of Ozzy sounding fiendish. If you ever want to show the MTV kiddies what Mr. Sharon was doing when he wasn't bumbling around, breaking his neck for reality TV, play them THIS. ARE YOU MENTAL, ARE YOU MAD??? Fuck yes, this is some heavy shit. \n\nSymptom of the Universe is probably the most ahead-of-its-time song on here. The others I could picture for 1973, maybe, but this one I just cannot. The simplicity of that opening riff, which just set so many standards for what metal was to become. Judas Priest must have been paying attention, because I doubt it's entirely coincidental that Rocka Rolla transitioned to Sad Wings of Destiny in such an effective manner. The band themselves of course worship Black Sabbath more than properly in every interview, when they are asked about the 1970s - I would not be surprised if THIS particular song really got them especially necroejacuiative. I'm gonna give this album one more point than Sad Wings, just to emphasise this fact.\n\nThe oddball track is Am I Going Insane, which is actually a pretty decent song, in and of itself, and is completely within the realms of heavy metal. Soundwise, it sounds like a British Invasion song from the 60s that you hear on the oldies station, but the general atmosphere of evil turns this one inside out and absurd. Like that Destruction cover of My Sharona, sometimes even happy rock can be made into total death. Geezer's bass is most prominent on this song, and provides a constant reminder that this is still Black FUCKING Sabbath, through the many layers of guitar and keyboards. I am totally convinced that Iommi wrote the bass riff, and told Geezer to play it. It is, indeed, borderline metal, but if the WASPs of the world can do songs like Rock and Roll to Death, then Black Sabbath can do this, and get away with it just fine.\n\nThe only thing that prevents this from getting a rating in the 90s is Supertzar, which is just a bit on the over-the-top side. It has riffs, and then it has that chorus. Don't confuse it with the far superior Supernaut. It's not a BAD song, but unlike the aforementioned bookends of Symptom, this one just doesn't quite make as much sense. Still, the opening riff is very very enjoyable, so I can't really declare the song a loser. \n\nSupertzar or not, I still declare this album to be brilliant. It's not perfect in the can-do-no-wrong \"Priest in the East\" sense, but for 1975, its amazingness is beyond question. Completely, wholeheartedly recommended. If you do not own this on LP, you are not metal.\n",
        "\nThe Dio line-up is less famous than the Ozzy-fronted band, but amongst the metal community it is beloved like little else. Although they only released two albums, both of them were undeniably highlights of the catalogue, stomping flat everything that came after and a good deal of what came before.\n\nWhile I hold Heaven and Hell in the highest esteem, it really didn't feel like a Black Sabbath record, Ronnie really bringing a whole Rainbow vibe to the proceedings to wonderful results. On album number two though, the band decided to fuse the classic Sabbath stomp with the gothic tones of Rainbow, and for the most part they succeeded.\n\nOpener \"Turn Up the Night\" is spiritual brethren to \"Neon Knights\", but where that song is nimble and quick TUTN is slow and moody. Seriously, rhythm section is all mud and the riff is a real earthshaker. Ronnie is rather subdued, the song actually one of my least favourites on the record because it occasionally feels mechanical. But man, those solos are seriously unique in the Sabbath cannon, Iommi going all musical and light in the midst of the titanic murk.\n\n\"Voodoo\" is a mid-paced cruiser not unlike say, \"Wishing Well\" from the last album, only much better than that sour note. Still, one of Ronnie's less coherent lyrics is carried off by his performance alone, much more angry and growly this time around, a persona he would neglect until Lock Up the Wolves a decade hence. A nice diddler of a solo, solid again. It seems Sabbath inverted the Heaven and Hell formula and stuffed the front end with weaker tracks while powering up the back end.\n\n\"E5150\" is like an electric \"Fluff\" or a second \"F/X\", both of little purpose except to get us from one track to another. Appropriate then that Sabbath used them to bookend their quasi-legendary Live Evil release. Not much to say, just squealing electronics.\n\nI have trouble calling \"Sign of the Southern Cross\" one of the great Sabbath songs as some would have you believe. It's a song I like very much, but when you compare it to \"Heaven and Hell\", it's blown out of the water. And those lyrics are atrocious. When I hear \"Southern Cross\" I expect the KKK burning crosses, not some besotted ramblings about yet another crystal ball. And there are so many spaces...but hot damn if Ronnie doesn't make you forget it's inadequacies with that wizardry of his, and Iommi's silent death-from-above riff that just gives the chorus the feeling of a roiling cauldron ready to overspill. Bloody brilliant soloing too. And let us not forget the master, Vinnie Apice, ably filling in for Bill Ward with some truly \"War Pigs\"-worthy fills acrobatically shoving this song along when it might have simply dragged without him. I think this song is just Sabbath doing an epic for the sake of doing an epic, sort of checking off the required epic portion of the record in a hurry to move along to something a little more fun to do.\n\nNow, here's the only track any non-metal traditionalist might have heard of, and deservedly so. \"The Mob Rules\" is a hot slab of \"Kill the King\"-y speed metal. Ronnie is top-flight, Geez and Tony metal incarnate, and Vinnie is Vinnie, i.e. a percussion machine. This also has to rank amongst the top Ronnie lyrics, another of his \"people be dumb\" songs, but at least based on a reality that does not include spell-casting warlocks or dumbass blues light. An unabashed but bashed out classic.\n\n\"Country Girl\" has all the makings of a terrible song like a notable two songs on Heaven and Hell, but despite it's Elf-ed lyric it becomes reminiscent of \"Lady Evil\" from Heaven and Hell, one of my fav tracks from that album despite it's insipid blues-gone-wrong lyric. Anyway, \"Country Girl\" harkens back to classic Sabbath, those iron-y (no pun intended) riffs pummelling the ear and Ronnie doing an Ozzily simple vocal melody that simply follows the riff in a near monotone. And that breakdown is heavenly, or perhaps hell-worthy.\n\nI consider \"Slippin' Away\" to be the unheralded classic of this record, by hook or by crook sticking in your head, the band tight as a drum, the riff supreme, the singer on top of his game. No chorus to speak of, only a refrain that screams crowd participation. A shame this never really got the respect it deserved.\n\nYou may have noticed a pattern of comparison to the last album here, and one of the most direct is \"Children of the Sea\" and \"Falling Off the Edge of the World\". However, it's such a great formula that deserves to be repeated (see \"Fade to Black\"/\"Sanitarium\", \"Hallowed be thy Name\"/\"Infinite Dreams\"/\"Mother Russia\"/the rest of the catalogue really). Ronnie going back to his grab-bag of tricks to a very \"Beyond the Realms of Death\" lyric, Ronnie all tragedy and pathos (bathos?) as he details the fate of the isolated and ignored. And damn if this isn't one of the highpoints of this incarnation of the band(really, the last period save for selected Tony Martin moments, that didn't suck).\n\n\"Over and Over\", well, \"Lonely is the Word\" smacks this runt and around and tosses it aside handily. It's dull and uninspired, definitely not something to listen to over and over.\n\nStand-Outs: \"Slippin' Away\", \"Falling Off the Edge of the World\", \"The Mob Rules\"\n",
        "\nBlack Sabbath were enjoying the longest break of their career at that point. At this point the band was burned out from constant touring, and the drugs (mostly cocaine) were also taking their toll. They eventually reconvened and tried to work on their fifth effort, but writer's block prevented any further part of it. They retreated to an English castle later on, and reportedly came up with some of their most classic riffs, Sabbath Bloody Sabbath in particular. That same night, after Ozzy was almost incinerated when his room caught fire, an encounter with a ghost, and plenty of scary stories, they eventually got\nso scared that they ended up leaving! Later on the band enlisted the services of Rick Wakeman (Yes, among others) and finished recording their fifth record Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, which was released to the public in December of 1973.\n\nThis is regarded as perhaps the finest hour of the original lineup. It features some of the most progressive and inventive work yet, while still retaining a darker, heavier and more oppressive sound than their competition. Many fan favourites eminated from this album, including Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, Sabbrea Cadabra, Killing Yourself To Live and Spiral Architect. This album catapulted them to even greater heights, including a reluctant appearance on the California Jam (which the band protested against, but consented to after learning of a possible $100,000 lawsuit if they didn't comply). To this day, it's\na fan favourite to this day (along with their first six recordings) and it's not difficult to see why. \n\nThe Cast\n\nJohn \"Ozzy\" Osbourne (vocals, keyboards) - Ozzy's voice comes across as a little more fragile than in previous releases, but the makes up for it with an increased range that he uses to great effect. He also starts overdubbing vocal harmonies, as seen on A National Acrobat and Sabbra Cadabra. This is trademark Ozzy that would be seen more extensively throughout his solo \ncareer. \n\nFrank \"Tony\" Iommi (guitars, keyboards, flute) - Tony really steps up to the crease for this one. His riffing has become even more intense in certain areas, most notably Sabbath Bloody Sabbath. He also continues with his experiments with acoustic guitar, as seen in Fluff and Spiral Architect. His 'twin-guitar' solos are more frequent on this album, most notably on \nKilling Yourself To Live.\n\nTerence \"Geezer\" Butler (bass) - Geezer has become increasingly less fill-happy, with his licks showing up less on this album. However, he lends a huge backbone to the sound, supporting Iommi with his thick bass. In some areas he experiments with distortion as well. Highlights include the slow section in Sabbra Cadabra, which sees him playing highly active basslines\ntypical of his style, \n\nBill Ward (drums, various percussion instruments) - Bill Ward's playing takes on a more funky feel, especially on cuts like Sabbra Cadabra and A National Acrobat. He still plays some inventive patterns, such as the fill-happy chorus of Killing Yourself To Live, and then using the snare to keep time on Looking For Today.\n\nRick Wakeman (keyboards) - Rick Wakeman only plays on one cut, Sabbra Cadabra, lending a nice funky piano solo that fits in extremely well. \n\nProduction was handled by Black Sabbath themselves, and the sound is a little different from previous efforts. The guitar sound is slightly heavier and more prominent, Geezer's bass is slightly more prominent without being overbearing (a problem associated with the low tunings they used). Bill's kit is also mixed evenly, and Ozzy is mixed to the front as always. \n\nChoice Cuts\n\nSabbath Bloody Sabbath - Quite possibly the heaviest song of 1973, Sabbath waste no time kicking heads with this punishing cut. The song is driven by one of Iommi's heaviest riffs, and a rather high vocal melody is present here as well. The riff that begins at 3:19 is totally murderous, far heavier than anything else at the time (and quite a lot of material from today as well!). This is intensified by Geezer's distorted bass. Excellent headkicking song and one of Sabbath's most treasured cuts.\n\nSabbra Cadabra - A driving pulsating cut driven by Geezer's bass, and featuring one of Iommi's catchiest riffs. Ozzy's voice sounds a little different here. It continues along in this fashion until about 1:58, where a couple of synthesisers and an arpeggiated riff signal a transition into a funky Zeppelin-esque section. Ozzy's voice is in top form, showing off some vocal harmonies. This section also features an excellent piano solo from guest musician Rick Wakeman. \n\nKilling Yourself To Live - We're taken back to earth with this aggressive track. This opens up with Iommi's snarling guitar, before going into a cleanish tremolo-pedalled section, before going into perhaps the most aggressive chorus on the album. Iommi chips in with a trademark 'twin guitar' solo on the second chorus, with Bill Ward going off underneath as well. Around 2:47 the song changes into a half-time feel with an arpeggiated riff, which is periodically broken up with Ozzy and Tony's guitar in unison. A quick fill from Ward at 4:07 signals the transition into the final phase of the song, a nice pulsating riff with some of Ozzy's angriest vocals, plus another 'twin guitar' solo from Iommi. An excellent multifaceted cut and perhaps the best song on the disc.\n\nSpiral Architect - Opening up with an acoustic guitar intro, before going into the opening, a little reminiscent of The Who's Won't Get Fooled Again (that acoustic guitar underneath has Pete Townshend written all over it). It goes into a slow section which leads into another section featuring strings and Ozzy harmonising with himself. The section in the middle is totally string led underpinned by a pulsating hihat pattern from Ward and the recurring acoustic guitar figure. The strings are now featured from herein until the end, where the opening is reprised, before heavy-strings bring the track to a close. This track is quite unlike Sabbath, but it works so well. \n\nRaw Sewage\n\nWho Are You - 4:10 of annoying plodding synths. No guitar or heaviness whatsoever. A complete waste of time which serves no useful purpose.\n\nClosing Comments\n\nThis album reaffirmed Sabbath's position as the heaviest darkest band of their time. It also showed that they weren't afraid to experiment and add to their sound. This is widely considered to be their finest hour. Any fan of heavy metal owes it to themselves to have at least one copy of this in their collections.\n",
        "\nBlack Sabbath had released a trilogy of classic metal albums, and had been on numerous tours since. The band temporarily relocated to Los Angeles for the recording of the album, and got promptly caught up in the rock-and-roll lifestyle. Somewhere amongst the chaos, Vol 4 was concieved and release to the public in September 1972.\n\nThis album seemed a little unfocused, probably due to the partying and drugs the band did during the recording of this album. Some of the band's most brutal cuts are here, but there are some songs that plod along without much direction. The instrumental performances are all well done, but are detracted from by meandering song structures. However, these songs are well-performed, and act as a sort of precursor to their next effort, with more keyboards and acoustic guitars being used throughout the album. \n\nThe Cast\n\nJohn \"Ozzy\" Osbourne (vocals) - Ozzy is in top form on this release as usual. His improving voice is evident throughout the album. Top points include a slightly more aggressive feel on Supernaut, and the melancholy performance on Snowblind. \n\nFrank \"Tony\" Iommi (guitars, keyboards) - Tony picks up keyboards on this release to add a little extra to some of the songs, such as the strings on Snowblind and Laguna Sunrise, the latter being another acoustic track that improves on past performances by Iommi. More classic riffs are found here, such as Supernaut, Snowblind and Under The Sun. The only downside\nis that Iommi's patented 'twin guitar' solos are far less prevalent here, as his lead playing takes a more conventional feel.\n\nTerence \"Geezer\" Butler (bass) - Geezer still continues in his signature style on this album, punctuating songs with his basswork when necessary. Best examples include Wheels Of Confusion, Snowblind and Under The Sun. \n\nBill Ward (drums) - Bill still continues in his style, but is becoming a steadier timekeeper in the process. He adds some deft snare fills to Snowblind, and adds an impressive percussion section to Supernaut, driving it along with a vengeance. Another noteworthy performance can be seen on Under The Sun, in the fast section where he adds quick fills when everyone drops out.\n\nProduction was handled by Patrick Meehan in conjunction with Black Sabbath, and the difference is instantly apparent. Geezer's bass isn't as dominating, and Tony's guitar sound has become fuller, heavier and more aggressive. The drums are mixed nicely, with just a little more hihat presence than before. Ozzy's voice is also slightly lower in the mix as well. \n\nChoice Cuts\n\nWheels Of Confusion - This track feels like 3 different tracks pieced together as one. It starts out with a really bluesy section built upon an arpeggiated riff, before going into a powerchord riff. The vocal melody here has a slight \nmiddle-eastern tinge here. About 2 and a half minutes in it gives way to a stomping uptempo section featuring some nice chord-melody work, eventually giving way to an aggressive chord riff, which is then laden with lead melodies. It then returns to the powerchord riffing established earlier in the song. This eventually gives way to another crushing power chord riff\nwhich is used as a base for some nice harmonised lead work. This song fades out with a patented Iommi 'twin guitar' solo ... or so we think until it fades in with a melody line based on the previous chord progression drenched in reverb.\n\nSupernaut - Quite simply one of the most aggressive tracks they'd done up until this point. That verse riff is crushingly heavy, and is accented by Geezer's bass and Bill's drumming. This contains one of Ozzy's catchiest vocal melodies. An extended lead from Iommi comes in later, which is soon followed by a percussion-only section from Bill Ward. An excellent track that is a huge fan favourite even today.\n\nSnowblind - Apparently this song was intended to be the title track of the album, but the record company refused to release the album until the album title was changed. Continuing in the tradition of bleak cuts such as Electric Funeral, this song is quite possibly the most desolate cut on the album. It begins with an arpeggiated riff before going to a power-chord riff in the verse. About 1:40 into the song there begins a rather melancholy arpeggiated riff underpinned by Geezer's active playing and some nice snare and kick work from Ward. This is used for a solo by Iommi a little later. About 3:27 into the song it speeds up slightly featuring an atypical drum pattern with a hyperactive kick pedal. Totally bleak track that has deservingly become a fan favourite. \n\nUnder The Sun - This thunderous track in places brings to mind Children Of The Grave from the previous album. It begins with a slow heavy chord progression before locking into a thick chugging riff that could be seen as one of Iommi's finest. At 1:56 the song speeds up a little (a section reputedly called Every Day Comes And Goes), dropping out every now and then for a \nquick fill from Ward, before going into a guitar solo. The end is a slowish section built on nice guitar line, featuring a patented 'twin guitar' solo from Iommi reminiscent of the one in N.I.B. and some kickdrum abuse from Ward. Excellent way to cap off the album.\n\nOff Cuts\n\nChanges - This one doesn't really fit in with the rest of the album, being entirely piano-driven, in stark contrast to the guitar-driven nature of the rest of the album. This is not to say that this isn't a good song, as it captures a feeling of despair quite well, but it drags on a bit and doesn't fit well with the rest of the songs. \n\nSt Vitus Dance - This one doesn't seem as memorable as the other tracks on the album, as the riffs don't seem to stack up to others found elsewhere on the album. \n\nRaw Sewage \n\nFX - Unfortunately the first blemish in Black Sabbath's illustrious career, it consists of nothing but 1:43 of random effects (as the title implies). Totally pointless and worthless track.\n\nClosing Comments\n\nAlthough not as good as the two that preceeded it, due to it's inconsistency, it is still an album that holds its own against the rest of the Ozzy-era output, and marks the transition toward the sound on Sabbath Bloody Sabbath. Do not hesitate to buy this.\n",
        "\nBlack Sabbath were enjoying a high unlike most metal bands. The band were seen at the forefront of the hard rock movement, along with other bands such as Deep Purple and Led Zeppelin. This was so much so that they were often compared to their closest rivals Led Zeppelin. This would be where the comparisons would end. Led Zeppelin's third effort consisted mainly of\nacoustic-based music. Black Sabbath on the other hand promised to deliver their heaviest effort yet.\n\nAnd deliver it they did. Black Sabbath's third album was their heaviest most uncompromising effort yet, and arguably of their entire output with Ozzy at the helm. The riffs were more aggressive, Ozzy's voice was developing further, Geezer's bass was more powerful and the drumming of Bill Ward was as great as it had ever been. This album contains some of their most famous\ncuts, and was an enduring instant classic on release. \n\nThe Cast\n\nJohn \"Ozzy\" Osbourne (vocals) - Ozzy's voice is continually improving, gaining a little strength and some range. The change is evident on Sweet Leaf. Of particular not is the rather un-Ozzylike performance on Solitude, which has even real fans in disbelief that it's really him.\n\nFrank \"Tony\" Iommi (guitars) - On this album Tony starts experimenting with downtuning, with most of the songs performed tuned 1 1/2 steps down (the exceptions, Solitude and After Forever, are tuned down 1 step). This results in extra weight being lent to the riffs, and a heavier sound because of it. Plenty of excellent riffs show up here, in particular Children Of The Grave, After Forever, Sweet Leaf, Lord Of This World and Into The Void. He also shows some dexterity on the acoustic guitar, as seen in Orchid, Embryo and Solitude. An excellent performance here. \n\nTerence \"Geezer\" Butler (bass) - With the mentality \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it,\" Geezer continues in his trademark fashion. His detuned bass (relatively matching Iommi's tuning) lends a heaviness to the album not seen in other bands around the time. Highlights include Sweet Leaf, in particular in the under the guitar solo (more like band solo)\n\nBill Ward (drums) - Bill Ward's performance is similar to his previous works. He is instrumental in propelling Children Of The Grave, with the tom-work moving the song along nicely. He also goes completely insane in the middle of Sweet Leaf (along with everyone else), laying down blistering drum lines. On this album he shows what an accomplished (and to an extent underrated) drummer he really is. \n\nProduction was once again handled by Roger Bain, and this one sounds a little different. What is immediately apparent is that Tony's guitar is a little crunchier than previously. The other more obvious difference is that the album is heavier and more bass-driven than before, due to Geezer being slightly more prominent in the mix, along with the lower tunings used on the album. Bill's kit sounds as clear as ever, and Ozzy is mixed to the fore. \n\nChoice Cuts\n\nSweet Leaf - Starting off with a looped cough (rumoured to be Tony Iommi after a bong hit), the song kicks off with the signature riff. When Ozzy's voice starts up you can hear the difference in his voice is instantly evident. The mid-song breakdown takes the form of one of Sabbath's trademark 'band solos' before returning to the sludgy riffing of before. \n\nAfter Forever - This track carries a sort of gospel feel to it. This one features a catchy riff and a slow funky verse section. Geezer's bass is especially heavy in this track, driving the song along nicely. This also features a nice churning\nmidsection where Geezer's rumbling bass makes it presence really felt. \n\nChildren Of The Grave - This cut gave birth to all headbanging cuts. This song features a pulsating chug that will make you beat your head against a wall for hours. This song also features nice tomwork from Ward. About halfway through there's an ominous breakdown, before returning to the pulsating rhythm and capping it off with a nice solo toward the end. \n\nInto The Void - Starting with the slowest and heaviest of riffs (heavily accented by Geezer's bass), it later morphs into a slightly faster section featuring Geezer's bass prominently. This chugs on nicely until about 3 minutes in until a triple-time section drops in to shake things up a little. After this we return to the heavy chug previously established. There's also a nice patented Iommi 'dual guitar' solo in here as well. \n\nClosing Comments\n\nThis is the album where Sabbath's early sound comes into form, and the possibly the most consistently heavy album of their work with Ozzy. Plenty of fan favourites show up here, and all are played excellently. There's no excuse for you not to own this album.\n",
        "\nBlack Sabbath were on a roll after their debut hit in early 1970. They had enjoyed the success of a number 8 record in the UK and some success in Europe, reaching number 23 in Europe. However, success in the US had eluded them thusfar. The band then returned to the studio to record their followup, this time recorded in three days as opposed to the one day effort of the debut. Paranoid was released on September 18 1970, delayed a few days because of demands for another more accessible song (Paranoid), along with a request to change the title, then called War Pigs, for fear it may offend US buyers, still smarting from the Vietnam war. As a result, the name was changed, but the artwork wasn't, explaining the rather strange cover.\n\nNot only did this record surpass the quality of their debut, it was so good that it finally got them success in the states. The feeling here is a less laid-back and more aggressive, being centered around Iommi churning out classic riff after classic riff. All members of the band have improved on their first album, and the songs are more structured and less meandering. The loose feel of the first album however is still present, just not as overtly so. The title track went straight to number four in the UK, and the album reaching number 1 in the UK and number 12 in the US, making it their most successful effort. \n\nThe Cast\n\nJohn \"Ozzy\" Osbourne (vocals) - Ozzy's voice changes notably on this release, becoming less throaty and higher pitched. He lays down some of his best performances on this album, most notably on Hand Of Doom and War Pigs. His vocal melodies, apparently all written by Ozzy himself, are some of the catchiest of his career. \n\nFrank \"Tony\" Iommi (guitars) - Tony's riffing comes into it's own, with a large amount of his most popular riffs making their appearance here. His lead style is similar to his debut, although deviating slightly, with more flurries of notes being used.However, he's at his best when he slows it down and works around memorable phrases. This is best evidenced by his jazz-influenced outro solo on Planet Caravan\n\nTerence \"Geezer\" Butler (bass) - Geezer continues in the style that he forged on the first album, and doing so with more confidence. His booming bass adds extra weight to plodding cuts like Electric Funeral and Hand Of Doom, and he even briefly experiments with a pick, lending a tremolo-picked bass section to the outro of Iron Man.\n\nBill Ward (drums) - Bill's jazz-influenced and rather fill-happy style comes into the fore on this album. He's all over the kit on War Pigs, particularly in the all out jam in the middle, but his best work is in on Rat Salad, not only being built mostly on his violent drumming, but featuring a drum solo right in the middle. A truly electric performance from Ward.\n\nProduction was handled by Roger Bain, and is similar to the first album. The main emphasis is on Tony Iommi's guitar, with the other instruments seemingly positioned around it. Bill's kit sounds excellent, and Geezer's bass is prominent without being overbearing. Ozzy's vocals are mixed to the fore as well.\n\nChoice Cuts\n\nWar Pigs - A seven and a half minute monster, War Pigs begins with a slow section replete with air raid sirens, before going into the verse section which sees Ozzy singing a cappella, before going into a rather loose and funky section. The lead section at the end is complete instrumental chaos, with each instrument seeming to do something completely unrelated to the \nother. It should sound like a complete cacophony, and yet it avoids this completely. Excellent stuff. The outro section consists of a nice riff containing arpeggiated seventh chords, before launching into another trademark \"band solo\". An excellent opening cut.\n\nParanoid - This is the song that brought them into the big time. Not bad for a song that was reputedly written in less than five minutes at the end of the sessions. This cut features Iommi's most well known riff that powers the song from start to finish, and Bill Ward plays an uncharacteristic role as a timekeeper. There is an unusually tight feel to this song, as the loose jammy feel of the rest of the album is totally absent here. \n\nPlanet Caravan - The lightest cut here. This one sees Iommi on a clean guitar, Bill Ward on bongos and Ozzy recording his vocals through a Leslie rotating keyboard amplifier. Although easily being the lightest cut, it is their most atmospheric, as this song contains an engulfing sense of doom. Of particular note here is the exceptional outro lead of Tony Iommi. A dark,\nmelodic, almost jazzy lead that adds immeasurably to the atmosphere present. \n\nIron Man - One of Black Sabbath's most famous cuts, this starts off with a discordant guitar figure with Ozzy's heavily synthesized voice before launching directly into its signature riff which powers most of the song. There's a nice solo section in the middle as well. The outro is fueled by tremolo-picked bass from Geezer, over which Tony puts forth a guitar \nline before going into one of his patented \"twin-guitar\" solos. Excellent work\n\nElectric Funeral - This cut is so bleak and oppressive you can picture in your head the devastated radiation-scarred landscape that serves as the lyrical topic. This is the sort of atmosphere that doom bands have been striving to recreate for years. Powered by one of Iommi's heaviest riffs and a menacing vocal performance from Ozzy, this cut is punishing from start to finish.\n\nClosing Comments\n\nThis is the release that brought them into a league of their own, and played a critical role in the development of metal. There are no weak cuts at all on this album, and it's so revered that it's an unwritten law to have a copy of this (and the rest of their first six). No metalhead should be without this album!\n",
        "\nThis is the culmination of the work of four motley young men from Birmingham England. The lead singer was a dyslexic who had spent some time in jail for breaking and entering with a thin banshee-esque wail. The guitarist had lost the ends of two of his fingers, using thimbles made from a melted plastic bottle and leather straps. The bass player had switched from rhythm guitar upon hearing the music of Cream, and the drummer was apparently incapable (on his own admission) of playing a basic 4/4 rhythm. These four young men seemed not to have a hope in hell. Their initial lineup was formed from the ashes of two local bands, Mythology and Rare Breed, becoming the six-man entity The Polka Tulk Blues Band. After shedding two members, they re-named themselves Earth, and after some time when their new style started to take shape, the group rechristened themselves Black Sabbath, and promptly got a record deal, recording a single (a cover of Crow's Evil Woman) before being fobbed off onto a smaller label. The recording of this album supposedly took place in its entirety on November 11 1969. On February 13 1970, Black Sabbath's first effort was released and the world would be changed forever.\n\nThe record was something completely different to what had previously been heard anywhere. There had been numerous experiments in Hard Rock, the most notable being Cream, The Who, Deep Purple and Blue Cheer, but this was an entity unto itself. This was something even darker, heavier and more intimidating, although it had a rather loose and jammy feel to it. This album gave birth to heavy metal, with the title track itself spawning a subgenre, doom metal. Predictably showing how out of touch they were with music at the time, the critics quickly panned the album, with The Village Voice even going so far as to refer to it as \"the worst of the counterculture on a plastic platter.\" However, the fans knew they liked it, and the album ended up going \nstraight into the UK Top 10, peaking atnumber 8.\n\nThe Cast\n\nJohn \"Ozzy\" Osbourne (vocals, harmonica) - Ozzy's vocal performance here isn't at all pretty. He shows here a lack of range and a throaty wail. What makes this performance so good though is the way he uses his voice to convey emotion. On the title track, he sounds genuinely fearful for his life. He also shows quite an impressive ear, being responsible for the rather catchy vocal melodies on the album. Perhaps one of the finest performances of his rather lengthy career.\n\nFrank \"Tony\" Iommi (guitar) - Tony's guitar style here is metal in it's purest form, laying down riff after riff with considerable power. Most of the riffs here are quite simple, but extremely effective. His lead style is a more focused structured one, mostly centered around catchy motifs. Another one of his trademarks, double-tracked leads to give the illusion of two lead guitars, also appears here, most notably on N.I.B.\n\nTerence \"Geezer\" Butler (bass) - Building on the work of fellow bassists Jack Bruce (Cream) and John Paul Jones (Led Zeppelin), Geezer plays a rather loose pattern adding in fills, rather than just playing basic root notes. He also shows some of his talents in the small bass intro to N.I.B. (also known as Bassically). He has since become one of the most influential bass players in metal, from Steve Harris to Jason Newsted.\n\nBill Ward (drums) - By his own admission, Bill Ward cannot play a straight rhythm or keep time, a problem that would usually be disastrous in a band setting. However, Bill solves this problem by being fill happy, using his drums to complement Iommi's riffing. The result is an emphasis on the loose and jammy feel of the album. \n\nProduction was handled by Roger Bain, and is mixed well. The drums are evenly mixed, and the bass is quite prominent in the mix as well (given that it's Geezer, that's pretty much required). The most notable aspect is that the guitar sound is full and heavy, providing most of the power for the band (as opposed to other bands where the drums were the main power). The way that the guitar was mixed on this album is unique to almost any other band around that time. Ozzy's vocals are mixed to the front, as is his harmonica.\n\nChoice Cuts\n\nBlack Sabbath - Quite a few metalheads have memories of putting this song on late at night for the first time and promptly being scared shitless by it. This track opens with the sound of rain and church bells ringing, before diving straight into one of the most ominous riffs ever put to record. The song quiets down a little, punctuated by tom fills from Ward, then Ozzy chips in with a rather melancholy and fearful delivery. Truly fearful stuff. Around 4:36, the song picks up with Ozzy getting more and more frightened, before he screams \"NO, NO, PLEASE NO!\" After that the solo section kicks in, featuring an equally scary solo from Iommi until the song ends violently. Truly hair-raising stuff.\n\nN.I.B. - This is a cut that got them into trouble, due to the line \"My name is Lucifer, please take my hand.\" This starts off with an impressive bass solo from Geezer, before going into a signature Iommi riff. A signature aspect of early Sabbath comes to the fore during Iommi's solo, in which Geezer and Ward are also doing something different, playing plenty of fills. This sort of thing seems totally nonsensical, but somehow it makes total sense. This also features one of Iommi's signature double-tracked leads. \n\nWicked World - The final cut on this album (apparently not on all versions of the originals), it opens with a hihat figure modeled on Gene Krupa (betraying Ward's jazz influence), going into a jazzy section ending with some punishing fills from Ward. The song then goes into a slow riff, then into palm-muted chugging under Ozzy's vocal lines. Ozzy's voice sounds strange on this track, sounding a lot more piercing here. That part of the song fades out, leading to a finger-picked open string figure from Iommi supported by Geezer. This leads into an a capella guitar solo a la Heartbreaker. The song then \nreprises the verse before ending with the jazzy section that it started with. An excellent and varied song from Black Sabbath.\n\nOff Cuts\n\nThe Warning - This one, built around a 12-bar blues figure, seems to meander on quite aimlessly for 10 minutes, making for a rather uninteresting listen. \n\nClosing Comments\n\nThis is where it all began. It is not a perfect album (nothing is ever perfect the first time around), but this album is still revered far and wide, and is required listening for any metalhead.\n",
        "\nAfter six great outings with Ozzy, and two more with Ronnie Dio, Sabbath seemed nearly invincible. Some people might have been sceptical, but hey if one Ritchie singer worked why shouldn\u2019t another? Well, Joe Lynn Turner definitely wouldn\u2019t have fit, but that\u2019s beside the point. So enter Ian Gillan, preternaturally gifted Deep Purple screamer.\n\nImagine, a combination of the first two metal bands ever! Well, imagine no longer, because here\u2019s is Born Again to rock your world! Err, maybe not. Problem is, Born Again is terrible. We\u2019re talking worst Sabbath album yet, with maybe \u201cTechnical Ecstasy\u201d challenging it. And that artwork\u2026dear lord. Some of the worst in rock history.\n\nAnd why is it so terrible? A number of reasons. For a start, the mixing. Gillan has sworn up and down that the original mixes were great, before Geezer got his paws on them and cranked up the bass. Whatever the reason, the result is a noxious ball of toxic sludge that swallows any memorable songs here and belches them out as plain crap.\n\nGillan is obviously not really feeling it here, as if he just can\u2019t get in touch with the traditional Sabbath doom and gloom. Tony sounds bored out of his skull, and the whole thing is just bleh. Oh, and the songs themselves? What can I say, just read the titles. \u201cDigital Bitch\u201d, \u201cKeep it Warm\u201d, \u201cZero the Hero\u201d\u2026come on folks. There are a few nearly good songs here (\u201cTrashed\u201d, \u201cDisturbing the Priest\u201d) but this attempt at extremity is no \u201cPainkiller\u201d (song, not beleaguered album). No surprise that \u201cStonehenge\u201d and its accompanying live centerpiece is the basis for one of Spinal Taps greatest moments.\n\nIt\u2019s like they decided to try to out-heavy everyone else, and as a result they sunk to the absolute bottom. This is a synthetic version of heavy, no Saint Vitus pure and unadulterated doom, just knock-off\u2019s of the Dio era played way too low, Kyuss without the inspiration.\n\nReally, it\u2019s no wonder after extreme metal failed Tony went with AOR. And you know who sung on Seventh Star? Glenn Hughes, another Ritchie Blackmore singer (a member of Purple mk.III record).\n",
        "\nI have the Danny Saber Remix version of this song on the compilation album entitled No Boundaries, which is a benefit album for the Kosovar refugees. It's much different from anything I've ever heard from the band on Paranoid and has a unique sing-song quality like that of a campfire song. Lyrically, it deals with a psychotic person who is obsessed with killing and enjoys hearing his victims scream for mercy.\n\nBlack Sabbath has, for very long, been about evil, dark, grim subjects and I'm not surprised that this song is that way either. It's just that I was surprised that they would put a song with this subject matter on a Kosovar refugee benefit album. With their lyrical and musical innovation in later albums, I would think they would put a song on the disc that better exemplifies its cause.\n\nAnyhow, it's still an awesome song, with shrieking, wailing vocals and wicked soloing. Nothing too technical, but it's very doomy. Anyone who's a diehard Sabbath fan should either pick up the aforementioned compilation album or this single. Good stuff.\n",
        "\nNow THIS is more like it! After reviewing Ozzy's decent \"Blizzard of Ozz\", this album just completly blows the shit out of it. With only 5 songs (2 of which being close to/over 10 minutes), this is a fairly quick ride, but is memorable and a keeper of an album. The guitar tone is very heavy and the bass work is incredible, especially on the aptly-titled \"Bassicly\". Ozzy's vocals are better than most other times, with his voice sounding a bit deeper. \n\nThe album opens with Black Sabbath, the best Sabbath song ever. The evil opening riff, the calm into chaos verse and chorus and the breakdown into the outro, this is without a doubt Black Sabbath's best work. The Wizard follows, and it is nearly as good. More cool riffs with an Ozzy harmonica intro. This album does not drag like other Sabbath/Ozzy albums tend to do. The next song is a 4 part, with the mood changing with every part. The opener (forgive me, I forgot the names) is pretty short, but very sweet. The next part is equally as cool, which then goes into the bass solo and into NIB, which is another kick ass Sabbath song that everybody knows the words to. This goes into the worst song on the album, it is far to bluesy for me and the band just doesn't sound as strong. The final track is another multi-part song, and it is decent at best. Although it rocks for the first 6-7 minutes, it quickly loses steam and turns into a lame solo for what seems like 295435 hours.\n\nEven though the last 2 tracks are not up to par with the rest of this masterpiece, the other songs more than make up for it. This CD is really cheap due to it being re-released approximatly 4 billion times, so if for some unknown reason you don't have it, GET IT.\n",
        "\nFor once I actually agree with UltraBoris, while this is one of Sabbath's most \"forgotten\" albums, it is certainly one of their best, no matter how odd that may sound. Ok, it doesn't sound a bit like old Sabbath - but honestly, so fucking what? That's REALLY not the issue here.\n\nJudging from the song quality, musicianship, vocals and so on, this is top-notch. Sure, some of the lyrics in the hands of let's say Jon Bon Jovi or Joey Demaio would be a nightmare (ie. Glory ride), but here it doesn't matter thanks to heavy-as-fuck riffs and vocal lines that makes you go \"whoah\". In fact, I've always been a fan of Tony Martin ever since I got into Sabbath 9 years ago (actually, Cross purposes was one of the first albums purchased, and then it was brand new). The problem with being a fan of his is that the albums he participates in doesn't really make him justice. Except this. He's capable of some really high screaming, without taking it too far so to say. When I think about it, he's the perfect power metal singer.\n\nAnyhow, my point is that there is no such thing as bad tracks on here, no soft glam songs which many times destroy the Sabbath albums he does vocals for. The only soft touch here is \"Scarlet pimpernel\", it's a nice little acoustic instrumental and serves as intro to the fast rocker \"Lost forever\", which makes me wanna grab my air-guitar and thrash the fuck around.\n\nThis album's eliteness is because of a already named reason. It doesn't suffer from inconsistency like most other late(r) Sabbath albums, take Headless cross for example - it has like one great track, the rest sucks ass.\nBut all songs here are more or less great. You got heaviness, little doses of speed here and there, awesome vocals.. what else do you need?\n\nFinally I'm gonna admit that I'm ashamed - I had this album for a long time, then I sold it. Recently I bought it again though. Don't repeat my mistake. Buy this and fucking keep it.\n",
        "\nThe 3 \"big\" Sabbath albums to many people are Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, Master of Reality and Paranoid. Personally, I think if you're gonna own 3 Black Sabbath albums only, get this, Volume 4 and Sabbath Bloody Sabbath. These three are absolute essentials, and this album is a fucking monster.\n\nPeople who don't like Ozzy-era Sabbath should seriously still check this out, Ian Gillan is an awesome singer, the music is very good chunky heavy metal, great lead work too. The album has it's doomier moments like Disturbing the Priest and Zero The Hero which have really huge guitar riffs and a \"big\" sound, then there's catchy heavy metal with a bouncy tempo like Digital Bitch and Hot Line. One of my fave Sabbath ballads, Born Again, is on here too, and it's excellent.\n\nThe lead work is actually quite similar to Ritchie Blackmore's in places. Tony seems to throw in his whammy bar and a few licks Blackmore could have used. As well as Ian's yelling in places, there's a distinct Deep Purple vibe. But the rest of the music is just great heavy metal done the Sabbath way. Awesome guitar riffs. \n\nSo yeah, anyone who gave up on Sabbath after Ozzy or anyone who thinks all Black Sabbath albums sound like the ones with Ozzy need to give this a listen, because it's a fantastic album. The album cover is a little, well, shit but the music is absolutely amazing.\n",
        "\nThis is one of the best live albums that I\u2019ve heard. This album has the and best live material Sabbath has ever put out. The 17 minuet wicked world that encompasses bits and pieces of other later Sabbath tracks is just stellar. Other high points of this album are the 1975 recordings of \u201csabotage\u201d material. Personally I much prefer the first disc to the second despite the live sabotage material. \nIommi\u2019s solos are incredible on this album and hearing a young Ozzy belt the most classic of Sabbath tracks is a thing to be heard.\nThe iron man, behind the wall of sleep and black sabbath recordings are unimpressive due to the lack of sound quality but still pretty good.\nOne thing I would have liked to see included in this album is the drum solo on \u201crat salad\u201d that was absent on the \u201cHand of doom/rat salad\u201d track.\nOverall this album is amazing and I suggest it over the \u201creunion tour\u201d album if you are looking for live Sabbath material. \nTruly Sabbath at their best.\n",
        "\nThey released this one on, 73? For it's time is quite an extraordinary album. Hell, for any time. Any metalhead should know and hear this album as it stands as one of the genre's most overlooked gems (not as much as Sabotage, but that's another review).\n\nThis full-lenght follows the tradition of lethal-as-fuck riffs that Black Sabbath was famous for, not to mention the display of musicianship of every member (Tommy Iommi was mostly recognized as a rhythm guitar player, but people don't acknowledge his soloing very much. Some of his lead guitar work deserve praises). The best song (IMO), \"A National Acrobat\", combines some crushing riffing giving a shitload of heavyness and finishes with some fast guitar runs that are no less remarkable. Ozzy gives a great performance. The title track is good, not as good as \"A National Acrobat\", but it pleases, nonetheless, and i like it very much. \"Fluff\" is a nice and \"romantic\" acoustic interlude that opens it's way to the rocking \"Sabbra Caddabra\". A good song, but it doesn't crush your head until the middle part where they include a piano to counterpoint the crushing riff below it (when reviewing a Sabbath album, i'm always gonna refer to the heavy riffs as \"crushing\", because that's the best description for them. And my english is kinda limited, unfortunately :P). \"Spiral Architect\" is a nice experiment with an orchestra. It sounds both glorius and emotional, and is a nice variation on all the bludgeoning heavyness of the previous songs. Don't expect any softness here, though, you will find some great riffs here, too. \"Killing Yourself to Live\" and \"Looking for Today\" are good also, but not that great, so i'm not gonna write about them. Buy the fucking album and hear these for yourself.\n\nOh and, BTW, \"Who are you?\" is awful. A crappy experiment with sinthesizers, plus the songwriting is pretty bad. There, you have been warned.\n",
        "\nMost people tend to overlook this album, which to me is quite a shame. Whilst the first 3 albums are indeed heavy metal classics, the material on this album is just total lightyears ahead of anything else Sabbath has done. It has it all, the doom, the heavy, the slow, the weird, the folk, the blues...it's just everything Black Sabbath has ever been associated piled into 43 minutes of complete sonic bliss.\n\nFrom the bluesy and lethargic intro of \"Wheels of Confusion\" to the down right doom of \"Cornucopia\", this album is absolutely perfect, aside from one glitch. I understand it's probably something of a drug induced experiment, \"FX\" just isn't necessary to the album. Had the album progressed from the tear jerking \"Changes\" straight into the raucous \"Supernaut\", I think the contrast between the two songs would have made a much welcome change as opposed to having to skip \"FX\" in between. But all that garbage aside, what we have here is Iommi has his absolute prime, Bill Ward as his most technical and Geezer Butler with some of the best bass work you'll ever hear. And not to forget Ozzy's vocal performance, I don't think this album would have worked had Dio done vocals on it, in the same way Ozzy just wouldn't sound right on the Dehumanizer album. \n\nTo me this album is the definitive album in the \"classic Sabbath\" era with Ozzy, it covers all they done together, from their doomy and gloomy beginnings, to their more progressive and technical sound on their later albums together. If the classic line up ever does another album together, one can only hope it's half as good as Volume 4, which to me stands as an absolute giant in the heavy metal genre.\n",
        "\nThis is the only live Black Sabbath album you need. It's the only official live release with the original Osbourne/Iommi/Butler/Ward lineup, because this is actually the first American release of the previously UK-only live album 'Live At Last', plus a bonus disc of other live material culled from the same era up through (just a shot in the dark) the Sabotage tour I guess, since the latest material on here is from Sabotage (and man does it rock-\"Megalomania\" is awesome to hear live). This is the often-sought Live At Last with an extra disc basically of quality material from the same era, sold generally for the same price as a normal single CD (around here, anyway). Get the first 6 Sabbath albums and this one, and you're set.\n",
        "\nThis is were Sabbath begins to take a step, albeit in the wrong direction. All in all, its not that bad, but its not really a metal album, it sounds more bluesy than anything and even has a few punk elements.\n\nBack Street Kids is a probably the most punk-like song on the album both lyrically and musically. Pretty fast paced, but rather simplistic notes make this interesting to some, but pure garbage to the fans of the earlier doomier Sabbath. IMO it is still one of the better songs on the album.\n\nYou Won't Change Me is pretty nice. Sounds like it would fit really well on other albums like Sabotage or Sabbath Bloody Sabbath. Once again, it is kind of punkish on the lyrics, but this one is played with more like traditional Sabbath.\n\nIt's Alright is my personal favorite song on the album. Although its sung by Bill Ward, its a rather emotional and well sang tune. Doesn't sound much like anything Sabbath has ever done, but then again, trying something new isn't always bad.\n\nGypsy is probably my least favorite track on Technical Ecstasy. Its rather repetitive and sounds kind of meaningless lyrically. Thank god for cd players, at least I'm able to skip this track. I've tried giving it more chances, but just can't get into it.\n\nAll Moving Parts would probably be my favorite heavy track. From the get go it lets you know that you are gone to get straight up balls out Black Sabbath doom and gloom. Fits rather nicely on this album, but would also fit on a wide array of their other albums.\n\nOne could probably tell by the name that Rock and Roll Doctor isn't much of anything special. For a synopsis of this, refer to the opinions of Gypsy. They are very much alike.\n\nI have skipped the remaining tracks so many times that I don't even really remember how they go. If my memory serves me correctly they aren't much of anything worth listening to, hints why I tend to skip them. Reading the lyrics didn't refresh my memory, but I can at least concur that She's Gone and Dirty Women are lyrically poorly written, just like many songs on Technical Ecstasy. This album isn't a complete waste. There are a few rather nice songs on here, but you have to sort through a few that are mediocre.\n",
        "\nFirst of all, I wonder why the band was still called Black Sabbath at this era, Iommi was the only original left in the band. Most oldschool Sabbath fans will probably find this album disappointing, but it showcases a few things that Black Sabbath isn't know for such as virtuosic drumming and extremely technical guitar work. Cozy Powell shows something that bands of this stature rarely use and that is double-bass. Compared to other Tony Martin Sabbath albums, this is not the best, but still IMO better than anything that they ever realeased with Ozzy. Shaking Off the Chains is probably one of the most powerful songs on this album, followed up closely by I Won't Cry For You. Guilty as Hell is also a rather good song, with yet another first for Sabbath, the use of the word f*ck. I never really thought Sabbath would sink to using profanity or simplistic choruses like on Forbidden, but I guess they were looking for a new edge. This album is very different from albums with Martin, it sounds like a second rate version of Dehumanizer, but IMO that is not necessarily a bad thing, since Dehumanizer ended up being some of Sabbath's finest work.\n",
        "\nI expected to be disappointed with Cross Purposes, because some Wal-Marts carry this album and at an extreme discount. Reading that Tony Martin was in the band surprised me, because I thought he had left earlier and would never return. Headless Cross was a pretty decent album, so I thought I'd give this a shot. There really is no weak link to this album. IMO, Tony Martin is probably the most talented vocalist that Sabbath has ever had. I Witness is probably one of the strongest songs on the album, but songs such as Cross of Thorns and Cardinal Sin rank right up there. What separates this album from alot of other Sabbath albums is the extended use of the keyboard. This era of Sabbath doesn't even sound like the same band, because they adapt a rather unique structure for their songs. Some Iommi's best solos fall on Cross Purposes. I was also really pleased with the competence of drummer Bobby Rondinelli, who had been in Rainbow and is now currently in Blue Oyster Cult. He as well deserves to be mentioned along with other great Sabbath drummers such as Bill Ward and Cozy Powell. Most mallcore fans that only know of Sabbath because Ozzy was in the band and only know Ozzy from the Osbournes often fail to realize that Sabbath released some of its best work without the godfather of heavy metal.\n",
        "\nThis is an album that sounds very different from its predecessors, both the Tony Martin era and the previous RJD albums. This harkens back to a certain time when Tony Iommi wrote the heaviest riffs on earth, by far. The whole album sounds as heavy as the 70s, while coming up with subtle bits that recall the best of the band's 80s output, pretty much combining the best of all eras.\n\nMost of the stuff has been summarised here - there tend to be two major categories of songs here. There are a few uptempo numbers like TV Crimes and Time Machine (there are two versions of this song, they seem to be not fundamentally different). Of these \"TV Crimes\" is the utter speed metal song, while Time Machine is more a midpaced song. \n\nThen, the rest of the album is made up of slow-to-midpaced CRUSHERS. Stuff that fits the style of the old masters (of reality!), stuff like \"Buried Alive\", and the epic \"Too Late\", which is just the finest doom metal has to offer. Each riff is like being hit on the head by one or two warehouses full of hammers. This is excellent stuff here. More great songs include \"Computer God\", which is a bit faster but no less heavy. Yes, this is what this album is - really fucking heavy! The riffs just completely pummel you, and force you to to obey or die.\n\nHighlights... probably the opener, \"Computer God\", which creaks and lurches its way into prominence before culminating with a classic solo that is all Iommi - early 80s style, with those bizarre note sequences that easily identify him. Also, \"TV Crimes\" is a fun basher that sounds like a Mob Rules song with extra crunch, and the intro riff set of \"Letters from Earth\" recalls all that is good about the early 70s - from Into the Void to Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, while the first fast riff is total Eternal Idol.\n\nEssential Sabbath - THIS is really the return to the Ozzy era, even though it's got Ronnie on vocals. This is on par with the 70s stuff as far as pure riff bludgeonry goes.\n",
        "\nOddly enough, this is where Sabbath seemed to fuck around uselessly the least, of all their first five albums (before Sabotage, where they really just put their shit together with a fucking nailgun)... there are no really overly short interludes thrown in (well, other than that Jack the Stripper bit, and Rat Salad), and the riff work is as usual phenomenal. However, it seems to have aged poorly, mainly due to overplay of some songs (Hell, I was familiar with the Iron Man riff by the time I was SIX), and also some rather weak ideas.\n\nWe start with War Pigs, which everyone has heard - but they need to hear again. The riff set at the end is apparently called Luke's Wall (didn't find that out until I got the album, and to this day I still have no idea where the split is, probably when the song speeds up...). After all these years, it still owns. Then the title track, which is almost speed metal. Not quite, though - it's above midpaced but no Highway Star.\n\nPlanet Caravan is kinda cute. I used to hate it, but then I listened to it while drunk... maybe that's the secret - to be under the influence of substances not occuring naturally within the body ;-) Then, there's Iron Man. It's really worn on me after a while (more so than War Pigs) but the ending solo/riff set is still a total monster. Electric Funeral is okay but it features probably Ozzy's worst vocals on here - he is a really crappy singer and at times brings the album down a lot. Other times he is tolerable, like on Iron Man, but not here. It's got a nice riff, though.\n\nHand of Doom, this is a song that cemented the genre that Black Sabbath spawned. Slow, heavy... instead of getting beaten by ten bricks every second like with a thrash album, this time the beatings occur only once every three seconds (well, a bit more often in the faster middle section)... but the bricks are a thousand times as heavy (even in the middle section, whoo!). Either way, you lose. Or win, if you actually like metal.\n\nRat Salad - what the fuck. Fucken drum highlights. Metal is about guitars. Enough said, here's Fairies Wear Boots, which starts off kinda average (it's also worn on me) but then at the end has a really simple but really nifty guitar solo that Metallica later borrowed to good effect. It's the most classical-sounding solo of all old Sabbath, and goes well as an outro piece. Who ever said Iommi couldn't play lead?\n\nSo do you need this album? Maybe, if just for Hand of Doom - that is the song on here that few people have heard, because all the other great heavy shit is a classic rock staple... it's a decent album, though it still is missing the drive and consistency that would mark heavy metal of later years. Too much drugs, kids.\n",
        "\nThis is easily Sabbath's heaviest album, and still one of the heaviest albums EVER made. Some of the riffs on here absolutely crush and slay all in sight. If the album were \"Children of the Grave\" and \"Into the Fucking Void\" four times, it would be totally fucking perfect. Alas, it has its weak moments, mainly in the fact that Sabbath seem to be on a silly acid trip half the time and can't chain Iommi's amazing riffwork into total SONGS consistently. Witness the fact that there are two little interludes, and one really long ballad which seems quite out of place, especially when placed between Lord of this World and Into the Fucking Void...\n\nAlso, the opener... this is one of the weakest of the \"essential\" Sabbath songs, if not the weakest. It rides a below-average riff into the ground and is just too late-60s-rockish for me... it does not crushingly advance the cause of heavy metal like the totally evil Black Sabbath (from another album you may have heard of) or the previously mentioned Into the Fucking Void, which is just brutal. Nothing knocked you on your ass this hard before, and few things have done so since.\n\nHighlights... so did I mention Into the Fucking Void? (Like Dark Fucking Angel, the expletive denotes heaviness and must be used at all times.) The best Ozzy-Sabbath song. Ever. THIS is pretty much where thrash metal took root. Also the excellent Children of the Grave... those are the two that make this album essential. Lord of this World is very nice, and After Forever, which is not nearly as Christian as it looks at first glance (it skewers both those who blindly bash, and those who blindly obey), is decent quality as well. The ballad and interludes do little for me, though - Sabbath still hadn't found consistency to go with their occasional flashes of sheer fucking bludgeonment.\n",
        "\nSince Dio left quite soon after \"Dehumanizer\" (which remains a shame - that line-up still had some good albums in them as far as i'm concerned) Sabbath was (once again) without a singer, resulting in the come-back of Tony Martin.\n\nLess heavy and dark then \"Dehumanizer\" this album more or less picks up where Martin left the band with the \"Headless Cross\" and \"Tyr\" albums - excellent, melodic hardrock / metal with a shining spot for the vocals and songwriting and it remains a mystery for me why a lot of people generally overlook or underrate it.\n\nSongwriting is perhaps even more varied than on most of the Sabbath releases - varying between faster tracks like the opener \"I Witness\" and \"Immaculate Deception\", the very doomy \"Virtual Death\" and \"Evil Eye\" and ballads such as \"Crown Of Thorns\" and \"Dying For love\". There really isn't a weak spot to be found on here.\n\nIn all more than a worthy Sabbath album - and af far as I'm concerned definitely in the top 10...\n",
        "\nWell I can be relatively short on this live-album from the Sabs - even though it has been about 13 years since their last one (\"Live Evil\"), I can't help but feel a little bit disappointed with it - not so much by the performances of the band - which are pretty good - but mainly thanks to the choice of setlist.\n\nFace it - when you have an excellent singer like Tony Martin in the band, who sang on at least 4 excellent albums - it is really quite laughable if you manage to fill more than half of the album up with songs from the Ozzy era. Of course all of the songs on offer remain great - but they could have at least played something a little bit more recent (where the hell are classics like \"The Shining\", \"Nightwing\", \"Evil Eye\" or \"When Death Calls\" - or even Dio classics like \"Heaven And Hell\", \"Computer God\" or \"I\" ? ! ?).\n\nVisually the band looks competent - but certainly not spectacular and even a bit boring in the long-run after several viewings. \n\nPersonally I find this release a wasted opportunity - although it still is worth tracking down if your a fan of the band...\n",
        "\n\"Reunion\", although perhaps not very spectacular - is a more than worthy attempt at capturing a Black Sabbath concert on cd in the original line-up (and imo certainly tons better than the \"Live At Last\" release).\n\nOf course you can hardly say that musically this is \"the best\" Sabbath line-up but it's a nice, nostalgic look back on the Ozzy era and it has to be said that all of the band-members give it their utmost best, resulting in a fairly decent live album with practically all of the \"classics\" featured. \n\nCouple this with 2 very decent new (!) tracks, which although perhaps not as strong as some of the bands other tracks, did make me curious as to what the \"reunited\" line-up could come up with album-wise (as it seems now - nothing - the reunion has turned out to be a complete disgrace and only interesting for nostalgia's sake - thank you very much guys but perhaps it's time to lay Sabbath to rest once and for all) and a very nice booklet and you get a release which is well worth buying (and certainly more so than the xxxth \"best off\" compilation).\n\nNot bad at all...\n",
        "\nThis album cannot be slagged in anyway. The component are; Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler, Vinny Appice, and Ronnie James Dio. This lineup in a sense, is perfect. Ronnie came back into the fold after jamming at a concert one night with Geezer, and so it just seemed like a good idea from a financial standpoint, since the maximum NON-DRAWING power of Tony Martin was leading Sabbath into onlivion. I respect Tony, but ANYONE could've been better than him. So here we are in 1992, and the Sabbs release their last true piece of art....Dehumanizer. The songs aren't the same phoned in riffs and cliche imagery that dominated Headless Cross -> Tyr era Sabbath, hell no. The band gives us an almost concept album on the future, with a production job that captures this theme immensely. This is the sound Sabbath is best in, and it shows clearly as their simply is no low point on the album. I've tried to find it, as I've looked to see which was my least favorite song, listened to it a few times and began to love it. My biggest suprise was Dio's lyrics, because he'd been on a creativity drought since Sacred Heart and here he's got totally new themes and a great new angry growl that would go on to rule his DIO follow-up \"Strange Highways\". The drumming is perfectly matched with the music, and Geezer's bass fills in \"Computer God\" make the song work and flow nicely. Words cannot describe the long term value of this album, I am still finding new things to appreciate in it. Sure addicts to \"Heaven And Hell\" and \"Mob Rules\" might not like the production, but this album in my opinion is stronger than either of those, and its a shame both Ronnie and the band have forgotten this classic in their setlists.\n",
        "\nSo this is it. The classic of all classics, Black Sabbath's second studio effort Paranoid. This album is so damn legendary that it can't be put into words.\nBut is it really that good? No, I wouldn't say so. But you'll have to keep in mind that this was only the second metal album ever, which makes it so damn more impressive.\nOne thing that is for certain is that the musicianship on this album, and any classic Sabbath album really, is out of this world. Guitarist Tony Iommi, bassist Geezer Butler and drummer Bill Ward compliment eachother perfectly, blasting out well-refined performances with that unmistakable bluesy groove of old Black Sabbath. Iommi plays some really nice solos that stay well within the context of each song and always manages to add very much, but it was his awesome riffwork that made him legendary. Butler is as you all know, a fantastic bassist, and his work gives the album a more down-tuned, darker vibe. Black Sabbath uses the bass like it should be used, adding alot to the music, while many for most other bands the bass is just there, without doing anything at all. And then we have the insanely catchy drumwork of Bill Ward, whose varied yet very bluesy style fits perfectly in with the dark and groovy sense of the entire album.\nFinally, of course, we have the vocals of Ozzy Osbourne. He was never a great vocalist, but I can't think of any other voice that would at all work along with the material of old Black Sabbath.\nSo these four excellent musicians here put out their second studio album, which was made legendary by such classics as War Pigs, Iron Man and of course the title track.\n\nWar Pigs is a long, evil and catchy motherfucker, with incredibly cool verses and that manic end solo sticking out as highlights. Iron Man has that immortal main riff, which is some of the catchiest shit ever. It must be heard to believe- then again, if you haven't heard it already, you totally suck.\nThe title track has catchy but simplistic almost-speed metal riffwork, fun vocal lines and a wicked solo. But the rest of the album isn't quite as effective.\n\nElectric Funeral and Hand of Doom are pretty average, midpaced heavy numbers that don't really do much for me. The former, though, has that wicked speeded up section towards the end, which somewhat redeems it. The latter has very nice basslines and alternates in heaviness, which is kinda cool at times, but eventually it gets quite boring and overlong.\n\nThe rest is also pretty damn average. Rat Salad is a mediocre instrumental with fun drum highlights, Fairies Wear Boots seems to just plod along and never get anywhere.\nAnd then we have Planet Caravan, one of the shittiest songs in the history of mankind. This is what happens when you take too much fucking weed.\n\n\nSo in conclusion, this is of course a legendary album, which you definitely need to own, if only for historical value. While the songwriting is pretty average and inconsistent at times, the highlights are incredibly high, and the incredible musicianship definitely does impress.\n",
        "\nThis is easily Sabbath's best album. The atmosphere created by all the instruments is just amazing - the tasteful use of keyboards combined with Iommi's masterful guitar tone, and also Tony Martin's ideal power metal vocals... not too shrieky, but very emotional. The most apt comparison this album can get is really Fates Warning \"The Spectre Within\", and possibly \"Awaken the Guardian\" to a lesser extent, as well as some Deep Purple and Rainbow works.\n\nFirst, \"The Shining\" - a great combination of fast and midpaced parts here. The chorus has a definite epic feel to it - just the vocal delivery, quite impressively done here. Great production on this album. Usually you just want the production to not destroy everything so you can't hear the riffs correctly - but here, it actually ADDS something to the album.\n\n\"Ancient Warrior\" is a bit slower, and even more epic, especially the chorus again. The songs do tend to sound a bit similar in that manner, but really the differences between them are quite evident, so much so that the album remains very interesting. \"Hard Live to Love\", lyrically, doesn't go along with the previous two, but still the song maintains the similar qualities. The verses again go by faster than the choruses, both are backed up by very very solid riff work (it's Iommi, what do you expect). \n\n\"Glory Ride\" is probably the fastest song on here - it really doesn't exceed midpaced by too too much, but the song is far more adventuresome, and Tony M. gives his greatest effort on the vocals on this song, soaring through \"lets take a chance!!!\" on the chorus and \"Hear them call!\" right before the guitar solo.\n\n\"Born to Lose\" reminds me of Malice, simply because \"you think you're chasing shadows in the dark\" is similar in the vocal melody to \"Shifting shadows, in a demon race\" from Hellrider. But that's where the similarities end. There is a really cool driving riff in this song, in fact several, but one definitely stands out - the intro riff which is featured prominently after the choruses as well.\n\n\"Nightmare\" (which, for the longest time I thought was called \"Dream Within a Dream\" since I listened to a CDR over and over again while my vinyl sat collecting dust... errr, keeping its good state of preservation!) is more of a ballad, with lyrics harking back to \"Heaven or Hell\" (\"fool forever, don't get fooled by the devil\") It's the slowest song on the album, but again, the epic qualities make it very, very interesting.\n\n\"Scarlet Pimpernel\" is the intro to \"Lost Forever\", which is another fast one. This one starts out at \"Efficient speed\" and definitely grabs you and forces you to listen, especially in the middle part, that almost has a thrash break to it. \"I'm burning!! With fire!\"\n\nThen finally, the title track. This is just absolutely fucking eerie. Black Sabbath have always written totally evil songs, this is one as well. The beginning sounds like total death, it's the kind of thing to play on Halloween to scare kids away so you don't have to buy candy. The song slowly builds up to a killing machine, never quite speeding up but forcing you to your knees one last time before the album ends.\n\nDefinitely the best Sabbath album. All of their previous \"good ideas\" have come together to create a masterpiece: great riffs, evil atmosphere, everything - no fucking around, this is pretty much a winner from beginning to end, with not a weak moment.\n",
        "\nAnother great Sabbath album - this time with Ian Gillan on vocals. Maybe it didn't work out personality-wise, but his vocals are absolutely PERFECT for the band (find some bootlegs from '83 tour and hear him nail Ozzy and Dio classics as well - only Halford has done a better job all-around singing all eras of Sabbath!)\n\n\"Trashed\" is pretty nice speed metal to start the album. A few hideous shrieks, before the whole song moves along very quickly, the vocals strung together over the riffs, complementing each other perfectly, before the slightly slower middle break comes in, and then the solo. Nice song, the best on here.\n\n\"Stonehenge\" is a bit of an introduction that leads into \"Disturbing the Priest\". Now this song is fucking insanely evil. Gillan sounds like a man possessed by three or four above-average demons at the same time. Very heavy riffs as well, this is yet another classic. THIS is the sound Sabbath were trying to go for with Ozzy on vocals - they got it on Sabotage, and they came back with a vengeance here.\n\n\"Zero the Hero\" is the next full song (after another little interlude) - the lyrics aren't quite as evil this time around, but the song still crushes all in its path, spurred on by yet another demented Iommi creation. \n\n\"Digital Bitch\" is the most controversial song here. It's \"Heavy Metal Hamsters\" - the lyrics are utter crap, but the music is totally great. This is pretty much power-metal for the most part, very nice with a cool solo too. Then, the title track. More fucking depraved insanity from the depths of Hell. Satan gives this two pitchforks up. Way up. Midpaced and brooding, without becoming bumbling and going nowhere. \n\n\"Hot Line\" is again generally quicker, and very nicely done. Not a complicated thing, but throw in a nice solo and all is well. Then, \"Keep it Warm\" is the ballad, and sounds more like something Deep Purple would've done at some point in their careers. Nice way to close the album. \n\nThere really are no bad songs on here - a few aren't quite as great as some others, but nothing demands immediate skipping. Quite an underrated release.\n",
        "\nThis is where Black Sabbath really gets their shit together, after wandering aimlessly through the desert for five years. Before that, there was the godly Sabotage, and before that five LPs that are historically unquestionable, but at times full of noise. Sabotage seemed like a real start, but then there were the two after it, which drank heavily from the jar of What the Fuck. Starting here, they'd release a series of albums that varied in style somewhat, but all were consistently very good.\n\nEnter Ronnie James Dio, and we get a collection of songs that are at worst average, and at best immensely spectacular. We start with \"Neon Knights\" - with Dio on vocals, the band sounds much more power-metal. This is possibly the best album that Dio has done vocals on - very powerful, and the riffs are quite marvellous, thus I prefer it to his solo career, which also started out pretty well. Total speed metal, and Iommi also throws in a very cool solo. Then, the ballad \"Children of the Sea\". The best song on here - though the first time I heard it is still the best: with Rob Halford on vocals from 11/15/92 - I strongly encourage you to track down that version, it is quite amazing.\n\n\"Lady Evil\" is a bit more pedestrian, and then we get to the title track, which comes in a very close second for best song nominations. The guitar solo, especially the first few seconds, is completely out of this world. \"Wishing Well\" is kinda ordinary but not at all bad, with some nice guitar work again (Iommi's best solos are definitely on this album), and then we get to \"Die Young\" - the fastest song on here (well, except the \"someone stopped the flame\" section, which is slow and has keyboards, but still works brilliantly). Dio's vocals are in top form - just runs rings around Ozzy, enough said. Then, \"Walk Away\" is decent, and \"Lonely is the Word\" is actually quite nice - it is long, but not overlong. The last 2 minutes or so are all soloing - maybe it borrows from Stairway to Heaven (I read that somewhere, I haven't heard the two songs in close enough proximity to notice), maybe it does not... in any case, as I said, the best lead work Iommi has ever done, combined with some awesome riffs and Dio's killer vocals, make this an indispensable Sabbath album.\n",
        "\nWell kids, here it is. The first EVER heavy metal album. Sure it doesn't sound like much when compared to, say, Eternal fucking Nightmare, but still, you guys have to realise that on February 13th, 1970, when this album was released, there was really NOTHING out there that was this evil, this fucked up, this... HEAVY!\n\nOh yes, Tony Iommi has managed to lay down some of the most morbidly twisted riffs ever, and combined with Geezer's ideals for lyrics, we have here a true masterpiece of Pure Fucking Satan. \n\nBut, it's not perfect. Some of the song structures leave a bit to be desired, and Ozzy's voice is average at best, and just pretty damn crappy for the most part. The album really can't make up its mind sometimes if it wants to be evil or not - sometimes the lyrics are too happy, at other times it's the music. But when it gets it right... oh good lord, hold on to your Bibles, kids, Satan's coming and he don't look all too pleased.\n\nWe start off with THE song - Black Sabbath. This is definitely the highlight of the album - it starts off slowly, with a monster doom riff (to anyone else that wants to write a slow crushing riff, let's face it, the be-all end-all of slow crushing riffs has been done. No way to improve it.) and then speeds up by the end, by the \"Satan's coming around the bend\" part. Yes, some of the lyrics are just a little bit silly, I must admit. But the overall effect is incredible... from the slow heavy stuff, to the galloping guitar-and-bass as Vic mentioned (listen carefully in headphones, it's two different riffs on two instruments that are distorted to sound kinda similar) part, and then the final cacophany of despair. \"Oh no, no nono!!!\"\n\nNext is \"The Wizard\", which, if you were to just look at the lyrics, you would think this were a silly power metal song. It's about wizards and dragons and little prancing elves. Well, not really. It's also pretty happy lyrics, which kind of stand in stark contrast to both the first song, and also the music of the second. Again, even the first wheels were kinda squarish - this album isn't an allout focused attack, but it is the FIRST, and you can't deny that.\n\nWe go back to being evil with \"Behind the Wall of Sleep\". More riffs here, including a bit of an intro. Then, \"NIB\" is probably the most generally famous song on this album, it's got more Satan lyrics, though the way the song is structured, it sounds just a bit upbeat. \"Oh yeah!\" The only really heavily morbid part is the middle part... \"Your love for me has got to be real...\" \n\nThen, \"Wicked World\". Some versions have \"Evil Woman\" - mine has \"Wicked World\", so we will comment on that. Another song that's generally okay, with some decent riff construction - I have to keep reminding myself, this is 1970, not 1976, and that way it stands out more.\n\nThen we have the last song - I can never remember where the songs tend to track themselves, as I have a tape copy, so I don't know where what starts and what ends... there is \"A Bit of Finger/Sleeping Village/Warning\" - we'll just call it that. I think I know roughly where they begin and end, but one can't be too sure, especially with the first two. The first two are mostly instrumental, sounding like a really tripped out jam session (good heavens, could you believe it probably WAS a really tripped out jam session???) - lots of riffs here being worked, with some great soloing too, but somehow it's a bit incoherent. Sorta like Priest's \"Rocka Rolla\" album - it's like, guys what are you DOING? Play a song already.\n\nAnd the song is \"Warning\", which ends up being a twisted love song. Not evil in the Great Satan sense, though.\n\nSo overall, what's there to think about this? Some really great ideas are being developed here - Tony Iommi's riff construction is like nothing ever seen before, and that is the greatest contribution to heavy metal. \"Guys, this is heavy metal.\" But it is pretty inconsistent - if you're going to be vicious and Satan, you may as well be that 100 per cent of the time... I'm not sure why it took music that long to realise it... it really wasn't until Sabotage (1975), Sad Wings of Destiny (1976) and Stained Class (1978) that we had an album that grabbed you by the balls at the beginning and didn't let you go. \n\nBut hey - a first time for everything!\n",
        "\nIt would be so easy to be cynical about this album - four 50-year-old guys re-hashing stuff that's been done over 20 years ago (most of it closer to 30). It would also be easy to gush about this album (c'mon, it's THE Black Sabbath - the only one that really mattered, anyway...). Of course, the truth is somewhere in the middle, and depending on what you value most about Sabbath this album could really go either way, so I'll try to be as fair as I can be. \n\nThe good view: A great two-disc set featuring the bulk of Sabbath's more popular tunes (i.e. most of Paranoid and the more name-worthy ones off of the first and third ones, and a smattering of the later ones that have been endlessly covered by other bands). The sound quality is excellent - nice and clean, but still quite obviously live, and the renditions are almost completely faithful to the originals. There are only minor variations in solos, song arrangements, and only once does Ozzy change a vocal melody to accommodate his vintage voice. What's more, there are two bonus NEW STUDIO tracks of the classic lineup. The booklet is also FULL of old pictures and one of the most complete histories of the band I've ever read. (I also managed to get one of the rare digipak versions, which has a very nice layout throughout). \n\nThe cynical view: This could've been a lot better. Sure, you've got to expect the band to play Paranoid, Iron Man, etc., but they really didn't go deep often enough. The only really unexpected tracks are Spiral Architect, the full arrangement of WASP/Behind the Wall of Sleep/Bassically/NIB, and Lord of this World (nicely led into by Orchid) - other than those songs, it's ALL their 'hits' (well, yeah, except for \"Dirty Women\" from Technical Ecstasy, but that's another down point...). And faithful though these may be, missing is the earlier wildness, out-of-control distortion, and spontaneous jam-session flights they used to take off into (for comparison, check out the \"Live at Last\" live album, recorded in 74, released in 79, and for the most part still available...). And speaking of sounds, this could've used a lot more dirt - the guitar is a bit too washed-out in reverb (the 'live feel', you know?), and the bass is far too clean and modern-sounding (Bassically is almost an embarrassment, sound wise - the coolest part was the fuzz-wah on it). And finally there are those studio tracks - one of the most obvious moves, and as expected they only serve to show that whatever collective chemistry they had back then seems to have spoiled after far too many years apart (and I probably shouldn't even mention that Bill's timing was so off in one song that they replaced him with a drum machine, but this is the cynical half of the review...). I can't fault the layout/packing though, even being cynical... \n\nSo, considering all of the above, CAN I boil it down to a bottom line? Only that it really depends on your attitude towards Sabbath. It should definitely be given a chance, that's for sure, and if you're in the mood for what basically amounts to a 'live-best-of', then this is right up your alley. However, if you miss what TRULY made Sabbath such a great band, I'd recommend checking out the \"Live at Last\" album instead. For what it is, it's great, but it could've been quite a bit better. \n\n(Originally published at LARM (c) 1999)\n"
